        "title": "Second XI (Australian cricket competition)",
        "text": "The Second XI (currently known as the Toyota Second XI under naming rights) is a men's cricket league competed for primarily by Australian state and territory first-class cricket reserve teams. The competition is administered by Cricket Australia and is considered part of the national development pathway.\nOrdinarily a low-fanfare competition that exists purely as a bridge between the Sheffield Shield and grade cricket, the tournament reached its peak of public consciousness ahead of the 2009–10 season, when it rebranded to the Futures League. This coincided with a focus on youth, driven by a restriction on teams to field only three players over 23 years of age. This proved unpopular, and age restrictions were relaxed for the 2011–12 season before being removed entirely ahead of the 2013–14 season.\nAfter 21 seasons of consecutive competition, the 2020–21 Second XI was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic preventing play. Upon its resumption in the 2021–22 season, the Second XI abstained from publishing official points tables, meaning that champions are no longer awarded. League champions were previously calculated based on a points quotient that accounted for the varying numbers of matches that each team may play in a season. The most recent championship was awarded in 2019–20 to the Queensland Academy of Sport.\nHistory.\nThe Second XI competition was established in the 1999–2000 season on an experimental basis as the ACB Cup, named after the then Australian Cricket Board (ACB). Competing teams were divided into two groups and played a series of three-day and one-day matches against each other. The competition schedule grew in 2000–01 as each team would play a minimum of four matches per season, with a winner awarded based on a ratio of matches played to matches won. The competition was renamed the Cricket Australia Cup ahead of the 2003–04 season in line with the ACB's rebrand to Cricket Australia.\nIn 2009, ahead of the 2009–10 season, Cricket Australia revamped the competition to become a youth-focused under-23 tournament. Now known as the Futures League, it limited teams to just three overage players in their squad, and restricted matches to three days. While the format still allowed for two innings per side, each team's first innings overs were limited to 96 and total overs to 144. A week-long Futures League Twenty20 tournament was also added to the schedule.\nBeginning in the 2011–12 season, the Futures League returned to four-day matches with no over restrictions and increased the amount of overage players per team to six. However, the age restrictions remained controversial, with West Australian all-rounder Theo Doropoulous describing the league as a \"glorified juniors competition\" in a July 2013 Tumblr post. This prompted Cricket Australia to remove age restrictions entirely in November 2013.\nAhead of the 2019–20 season, the competition rebranded to the Second XI to better reflect the purpose of the league.\nCompetition format.\nThe Second XI competition began in the 1999–2000 season as an experimental tournament conducted by the Australian Cricket Board. Teams played a combination of three-day and one-day matches. As the teams were divided into two groups, no overall champion was awarded. As the tournament expanded the following season, teams now played four-day matches exclusively, although the numbers of matches per season per team did vary.\nFour-day cricket continued up until the competition overhaul ahead of the 2009–10 season, which introduced age restrictions and capped overs to the tournament. Matches were reduced to three days for the following two seasons. During this time, a Twenty20 (T20) tournament ran concurrently, and a winner was crowned separately to the full-length competition. Four-day cricket returned from 2011–12 onwards, and the T20 tournament would continue in its own right until the end of the 2014–15 season.\nAfter a three-year hiatus, a T20 component returned to the then-Futures League for the 2018–19 season. Rather than contributing to the overall win-loss ledger, pairs of teams had either eight, six, four or two points added to their full-length season points total depending on their performance in the T20 carnival. This continued in the 2019–20 season, leading to a situation where although Western Australia won the most total matches for the year, they finished second in the overall standings due to T20 results carrying less weight.\nFollowing a year's break in competition due to the COVID-19 pandemic preventing play, the Second XI resumed in the 2021–22 season without official points tables, meaning that champions are no longer awarded."

The side does not take part in any international competitions, but rather in inter-regional competitions in the Caribbean, such as the Regional Four Day Competition and the Regional Super50), and the best players may be selected for the West Indies team, which plays international cricket. Guyana has participated in the South American Cricket Championship for some editions, but were represented by an overage \"masters\" team. The team competes under the franchise name Guyana Harpy Eagles.\nProminent cricketers who have played for Guyana include Devendra Bishoo, Basil Butcher, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Colin Croft, Roy Fredericks, Lance Gibbs, Roger Harper, Carl Hooper, Leon Johnson, Alvin Kallicharran, Rohan Kanhai, Clive Lloyd, Veerasammy Permaul and Ramnaresh Sarwan.\nHistory.\nThe cricket team has been known under two other names – first as Demerara (until 1899, but also during 1895), then as British Guiana until 1966 when Guyana became independent. As Demerara, they played in the first first-class cricket game in the West Indies, against Barbados in 1865. From 1971 until the mid-1980s two Guyanese regional sides competed in an annual first class match for the Jones Cup, later renamed the Guystac Trophy.\nGuyana has won the West Indian regional first-class title a total of ten times (plus one shared title) since its inception in 1965–66, which ranks third Jamaica and Barbados.\nIn List A cricket, Guyana reached the final of the domestic competition four times in the early 2000s, but the last victory was in 2005–06. They have won a total of nine regional List A titles, including two shared titles, which is second only to Trinidad and Tobago with 12 titles (including one shared).\nIn June 2018, Guyana was named the Best First-Class Team of the Year at the annual Cricket West Indies' Awards. Guyana won the 2022–23 West Indies Championship to clinch their 12th title. They won four out of their five matches gaining 84 points in total.\nGrounds.\nGuyana's main home ground used to be the Bourda ground in Georgetown, where they played 131 of their 181 first class home games, and where 30 Test matches were hosted. As of 2007 Guyana have played most of their home matches at the Guyana National Stadium at Providence, East Bank Demerara. Other grounds include the Albion Sports Complex in the Berbice region, which has hosted 24 Guyana matches and five ODIs, and from 1997–98 the Enmore Recreation Ground, East Coast Demerara, where they have played five games.\nSquad.\nListed below are players who have represented Guyana in either the 2018–19 Regional Four Day Competition or the 2018–19 Regional Super50.

Houston was also second overall in the NL with a 3.51 ERA in 2005, and led the league with the fewest runs and walks allowed.\nOn November 18, , Hickey was announced as the new pitching coach for the Tampa Bay Rays, replacing Mike Butcher. After the 2017 regular season, the Tampa Bay Rays and Hickey parted ways.\nIn the 2017 offseason, Hickey joined the Chicago Cubs as their pitching coach, coming along with two new coaches. Hickey reunited with manager Joe Maddon as the two were together at Tampa Bay until 2014. Hickey replaced Chris Bosio, who had been with the Cubs the past six seasons. Hickey did not return to the Cubs after the 2018 season. In May 2019, Hickey joined the Los Angeles Dodgers as a special assistant in player development.\nIn October 2020 it was announced that Hickey would join the Washington Nationals as their pitching coach for the 2021 season."

        "title": "Tony Bennett (basketball)",
        "text": "Anthony Guy Bennett (born June 1, 1969) is an American former professional basketball player and since 2009 the head coach of the University of Virginia men's team, with whom he won the NCAA Championship in 2019. Bennett is a three-time recipient of the Henry Iba Award, two-time Naismith College Coach of the Year, and two-time AP Coach of the Year. Bennett is the all-time wins leader at Virginia, and holds or shares records for single-season wins and career winning percentage at both Virginia and Washington State. He is one of three coaches in history (with Dean Smith and Mike Krzyzewski) to lead his program to ten or more consecutive winning ACC records and is one of three coaches (also with Smith and Krzyzewski) to be named ACC Coach of the Year four or more times.\nAs a 5'11\" point guard, Bennett ranks first in NCAA history for career three-point field goal accuracy at 49.7%, shooting above 50% from range in both his junior and senior seasons. He started for the United States national team at the 1991 Pan American Games, was awarded the Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award as the nation's top player under six feet tall, and was named Academic All-American of the Year. Bennett starred for the Green Bay Phoenix under his father, Dick Bennett, who later took Wisconsin to the 2000 Final Four using an earlier version of the packline defense seen today at Virginia.\nBennett played three years in the NBA for the Charlotte Hornets and after an injury, several more professionally in Australia and New Zealand where he started coaching. He has since coached several players at the college level who've gone on to be known for shooting prowess in the NBA, such as Malcolm Brogdon (eighth 50–40–90 shooter in NBA history), Joe Harris (led NBA in three-point accuracy in 2018–19 and in 2020–21) and Klay Thompson (one-half of the Splash Brothers). Both Harris and Thompson have won the Three-Point Contest at the NBA All-Star Game.\nFrom his first day at Virginia, he set the goal of building \"a program that lasts.\" Originally inheriting the worst UVA team since 1967, his Cavaliers have had four 30-win seasons, won the with a 35–3 team , won ACC tournaments in 2014 and in 2018, and have won or shared 6 ACC regular season titles. Known for coaching defensive intensity, Bennett has been ranked the top defensive coach in college basketball by \"ESPN Insider\" and a CBS Sports poll of head coaches. The style of basketball he teaches has often been compared to a boa constrictor choking out opponents, and his teams are known for their unselfish play, defense-first philosophy, and tempo control.\nBiography and playing career.\nCollege.\nBennett, a point guard, played for his father Dick Bennett at the University of Wisconsin–Green Bay (UWGB) following his high school career at Stevens Point Area Senior High and Preble High School. The Bennetts led the Phoenix to an NCAA tournament berth and two appearances in the NIT. During his time there, the Green Bay Phoenix had a record of 87–34 (.719) en route to Bennett being twice named as the conference's Player of the Year. He was awarded the Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award given to the nation's most outstanding senior under six feet tall and was named the 1992 GTE Academic All-American of the year. He also started for a bronze medal-winning 1991 Pan-American Games team led by Gene Keady. He finished his collegiate career as the Mid-Continent Conference's all-time leader in points (2,285) and assists (601), and still ranks as the entire NCAA's all-time leader in 3-point field goal accuracy. He made 80 of 150 (53.3%) three-point field goal attempts in his junior season and repeated the feat of hitting over half of his three-point attempts during his senior season, making 95 of 186 (51.1%). He was also incredibly accurate on two-point field goal attempts for a guard, connecting on 502 of 917 (54.7%) two-point attempts for his college career.\nProfessional.\nBennett went on to be selected in the 1992 NBA draft by the Charlotte Hornets. He spent three seasons (1992–1995) with steadily increasing playing time for the Hornets as the backup point guard to Muggsy Bogues (the Hornets' all-time leader in assists and steals) before a foot injury ended Bennett's NBA career. With an eye toward returning to the NBA, Bennett left for Australia in 1996 to play for the Sydney Kings of Australia's National Basketball League while rehabbing his ankle but the contract fell through within ten days of arriving and Bennett soon moved to New Zealand to briefly play for a team called the \"Burger King Kings\" in Auckland. Bennett has joked that the team was paid in Whoppers. He then joined the North Harbour Vikings, became its star player, and in his second year there became a dual-role player and head coach. He completed his playing career as a two-time New Zealand NBL All-Star Five honoree and a two-time Keith Carr Trophy winner for being the league's Most Outstanding Guard in both his years there.\nCoaching career.\nBennett wanted to understand everything about the game of basketball to the point that, even as an NBA player, teammates felt he would rather learn and study the game than participate in it. Bennett's teams, especially at Virginia, are known for their motion offense and stifling defense which features his version of the \"pack line\" defensive strategy famously devised by his father. The pack line is designed to clog up potential driving lanes to the paint by forcing ball handlers to the middle of the floor where more \"help\" is concentrated. It forces opposing teams to pass and shoot well, while limiting dribble penetration and post play.\nCoaching beginnings.\nIn 1998, Bennett continued as head coach of the North Harbour Kings (who had changed their name from Vikings) but retired early as a player. His time there taught him he was able to coach without the anxiety he had seen his father experience coaching back in Wisconsin, and convinced him that he could undertake the stressful life of a coach while maintaining his integrity and peace of mind. After the 1999 season, he returned to the U.S. to become his father's team manager so that they could spend time together. Tony Bennett was then able to get a firsthand experience of Wisconsin's run to the 2000 Final Four as a part of the staff under Dick Bennett.\nAfter his father retired, Bo Ryan retained Bennett on his staff and there he remained until 2003, when Dick Bennett came out of retirement to coach Washington State. After one season as assistant coach, Bennett was designated as his father's successor and promoted to associate head coach.\nWashington State.\nTony Bennett accepted the position of head coach at Washington State when his father retired in 2006. Washington State's success immediately skyrocketed under the younger Bennett, and his 26 wins in both the 2006–07 and 2007–08 seasons tied a 66-year-old school record set by the team that reached the Championship Game of the 1941 NCAA tournament.\n2006–07: School record 26 wins.\nBennett led the 2006–07 Cougars basketball team to a 26–8 (13–5 Pac-10, second place) record and the second round of the NCAA tournament. The Cougars earned a No. 3 seed and defeated Oral Roberts in the opening round before falling to Vanderbilt in double overtime in the second round. The NCAA tournament appearance was the first for the Cougars since 1994, breaking a 13-year March Madness drought for the Cougars.\nAfter the 2006–07 season, Bennett was given the prestigious Henry Iba Award by vote of the United States Basketball Writers Association, and was named the AP college basketball Coach of the Year and the Naismith College Coach of the Year. He was also named the Rivals.com Coach of the Year.\n2007–08: 26 wins and Indiana offer.\nDuring the 2007–08 season, Bennett finished with a 26–9 record (11–7 in the Pac-10). He also went on to lead the Cougars to the Sweet Sixteen after beating Winthrop and Notre Dame in the first and second rounds. After losing to North Carolina in the Sweet Sixteen, Bennett's team had again reached the school record for wins, with 26.\nAfter the season, Bennett reportedly turned down an offer to become head coach at Indiana, a job which eventually fell to Marquette coach Tom Crean. He also discussed the LSU (his wife's alma mater) vacancy at that year's Final Four, a job that eventually went to Stanford coach Trent Johnson. Bennett decided to remain loyal to WSU.\n2008–09: Rebuilding and budget constraints.\nBennett went back to work at Washington State with a need to replace NBA draft pick Kyle Weaver. He brought in Klay Thompson, a talented four-star recruit out of California (and son of former NBA player Mychal Thompson). Thompson rapidly improved on the offensive side of the court as a freshman, but the team struggled more than in the two previous years on the defensive end and finished 17–16.\nCanceled recruiting flights and Final Four trip for staff.\nWashington State dropped charter flights for Bennett and his staff for use in recruiting to the remotely located school and cancelled a trip for his staff to the 2009 Final Four (held ten years and two days prior to the 2019 Final Four which would be won by a Bennett team) due to ongoing budgetary constraints in the WSU athletics department. As this was happening, Bennett was contacted about the open Virginia job and traveled to Charlottesville to interview. While very impressed with John Paul Jones Arena and the potential advantages of coaching in the ACC, he initially decided to once again remain loyal to WSU. However, when Bennett went to call Virginia athletic director Craig Littlepage and decline the offer, Bennett's wife Laurel stepped in and said \"put the phone down,\" as she could sense a great uncertainty in his voice when he said he would pass up UVA.\nBennett then accepted the Virginia offer on March 29 exactly one year, to the day, after turning down the Indiana job.\nVirginia.\nBennett was named head coach at Virginia on March 31, 2009. Ritchie McKay, head coach of the Liberty Flames, stepped down to become Bennett's associate head coach before returning to the Flames in 2015. \nDuring the rebuilding process, Bennett's teams increased their win total in every successive season. After inheriting a 10–18 squad that had the worst record in program history since the 1966–67 season, Bennett's Virginia won 15, 16, 22, 23, 30, and 30 games in his first six seasons. Under his guidance, Virginia had four of the five teams with records of 16–2 or better in the 18-game era (2012–2019) of ACC play, and only Virginia had a team finish 17–1 (none went undefeated).\nBennett worked from Day 1 to build \"a program that lasts\" at Virginia. He has found in Charlottesville a fanbase that has really \"bought in\" on his defense-first mentality and tempo control, and John Paul Jones Arena is regarded as one of the toughest places to play for opposing teams of the ACC. Thousands of fans lined the streets to JPJ from Charlottesville–Albemarle Airport in 2019 to congratulate the Virginia team and Bennett on winning the program's first NCAA Championship.\n2009–10: Five-win improvement.\nIn their first season under Bennett his new team finished the season 15–16 (5–11 in the ACC), an improvement of 5 wins (+50%) versus the prior year under Bennett's predecessor (former and current DePaul coach Dave Leitao). Sophomore Sylven Landesberg, a former McDonald's All-American recruited by Leitao, led the team in scoring before getting suspended for the final game of the season after failing to meet academic obligations. It was soon announced that Landesberg and the program mutually parted ways, and he turned pro but went undrafted.\n2010–11: Personnel losses but continued rise.\nDespite every disadvantage, including one star player (Landesberg) leaving because of academic struggles and another (Mike Scott) going down with an early-season injury and taking a medical redshirt, the Cavaliers started the season with a bang by knocking off No. 13 Minnesota on the road, in Minneapolis, during the 2010 ACC-Big Ten Challenge. UVA improved to 7–9 in the ACC and had a winning record overall. They were passed over for postseason consideration.\n2011–12: Most wins at UVA in 17 years.\nThis season began much like the last had, with unranked Virginia dismantling No. 15 Michigan in the 2011 ACC-Big Ten Challenge. In just Bennett's third year at Virginia, he led the Cavaliers to 22 wins and an NCAA Tournament berth. It was the most wins the program had tallied in 17 years and its first NCAA Tournament game (a lopsided loss to Billy Donovan and Florida) in five years. After rapid development under Bennett over the past three years (of which he played only two because of injury), Mike Scott was taken 43rd overall by the Atlanta Hawks in the 2012 NBA draft.\n2012–13: Establishing the dominant nucleus.\nBased on his early successes, \"Athlon Sports\" named Bennett one of the four best ACC coaches (with Mike Krzyzewski, Roy Williams, and Leonard Hamilton) before the season. The Cavaliers would tally one more win (23) than the previous season, despite losing Mike Scott to the NBA, and establish nearly all the pieces to take the program even higher. Justin Anderson, Malcolm Brogdon, Anthony Gill, Joe Harris, Darion Atkins, Mike Tobey, and Akil Mitchell all started or played extensively for the young team. All they were missing was a controlling point guard, which Bennett found on the recruiting trail in \"diamond in the rough\" three-star London Perrantes from California.\n2013–14: #1 ACC finish and ACC Championship.\nIn 2013–14, Perrantes started as a freshman and joined the top players from the previous season as the Cavaliers won their sixth ACC regular season title, clinching it with a statement 75–56 home win against highly touted ACC newcomer No. 4 Syracuse, a team which had started the season 25–0. It was also their first outright regular season title since 1981. Virginia also won its second-ever ACC Tournament title (their first since 1976), defeating second-seeded No. 7 Duke in the final game, 72–63. The Cavaliers received their third (but first since 1983) No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament and advanced to the Sweet Sixteen for the first time since 1995. Bennett was a finalist for the Naismith Coach of the Year, as well as runner-up for AP Coach of the Year. Bennett signed a new seven-year contract to extend his employment with Virginia through 2021. It included a $1.924 million base salary package, with additional longevity and achievement bonuses. Part of his contract negotiations included long-term contract renewals for his staff.\n2014–15: #1 ACC finish and 2nd Henry Iba Award.\nVirginia got off to a 19–0 start, reaching an AP No. 2 ranking for the first time since 1983. Much was made in the press that of the top three teams, each dominating the competition and remaining undefeated well into January (Kentucky, Virginia, and Duke) the Cavaliers were doing so with no McDonald's All-Americans on the roster, whereas the Wildcats and Blue Devils had teams filled with \"nine\" each. Highlights included holding Georgia Tech, Rutgers, and Harvard to under thirty points each and actually \"doubling up\" the scores of Georgia Tech (57–28) and Wake Forest (70–34) – unprecedented dominance for any team of the past 50 years against ACC competition. The Harvard game was notable for a near-\"tripling\" score, 76–27 and limiting the Crimson, an NCAA Tournament team, to one field goal in the first half which tied the NCAA record for the shot clock era. Two injuries to Justin Anderson near the end of the season dampened NCAA Tournament hopes before he turned pro for the 2015 NBA draft. Bennett was awarded his second Henry Iba Award as the nation's top coach, joining ACC peer Roy Williams as the only coaches ever to win the award at two different schools. Bennett signed a new contract through 2024, later extended through 2026 and beyond.\n2015–16: NCAA Elite Eight.\nUVA started the season with impressive wins against eventual national champions Villanova, West Virginia, and California. The number of home-and-away series with programs from other power conferences such as these was virtually unprecedented in the ACC. Bennett was recognized for having one of the most elite offenses in the nation as well as one of the best defenses once more, and ESPN writer Jeff Goodman chose Bennett as the ideal head coach of his mythical \"Dream Team\" before the season... stating \"I'm going with Bennett, who ... has owned the ACC the past two seasons. Just imagine what he could do with this group of players and this level of talent. Bennett will make sure these guys defend (yes, even you Niang!) and he also has the ideal, even-keeled temperament.\" UVA later defeated Iowa State in Niang's final collegiate game in the Sweet Sixteen, before Bennett's first loss (starting 3–0) to Jim Boeheim's Syracuse in the Elite Eight.\n2016–17: 250 career wins.\nUVA brought in a well-rounded recruiting class which included Bennett's first McDonald's All-American, a consensus top 50 recruit, Kyle Guy. Former five-star recruit and transfer Austin Nichols became eligible after sitting out the previous season, but was suspended for two weeks including the season opening game for an undisclosed incident and dismissed entirely for a second undisclosed incident after playing (and starting) in one game. UVA nonetheless broke its record for consecutive weeks ranked in the AP Top 25 poll with a streak of 64 polling weeks spanning more than three years, breaking its previous best of 49 in the 1980s. Bennett recorded his 250th win as a head coach against No. 14 Notre Dame, in South Bend, 71–54, while extending his record against Mike Brey to 5–0. The Cavaliers notched impressive double-digit victories over eventual national champions No. 5 North Carolina, 53–43, and No. 4 ranked Louisville, 71–55. This completed Bennett's head-to-head rivalry record against Hall of Famer Rick Pitino at 5–1 before Pitino was dismissed for NCAA rules violations in the off-season.\n2017–18: Unranked to AP #1 and ACC Championship.\nUVA was viewed as a rebuilding team after departures of London Perrantes, Marial Shayok, and Darius Thompson, and the first AP poll had Virginia unranked for the first time since 2013. A \"Winston-Salem Journal\" reporter projected the worst season of Bennett's career at 5–13 in ACC play. UVA was ranked after winning the NIT Season Tip-Off. They defeated No. 12 North Carolina 61–49 to continue a home streak of 5–0 against the Heels since 2013. No. 2 Virginia then overcame No. 4 Duke on the road for Bennett's first victory at Cameron Indoor Stadium. The \"Winston-Salem Journal\" reporter literally \"ate his words\" about Virginia, ingesting a copy of his previous article with barbeque sauce. UNC prepared for their Duke rivalry game by reviewing tape of UVA suffocating No. 18 Clemson 61–36; Joel Berry II explained, \"We want to be like [Virginia] defensively.\" UVA attained its first AP No. 1 ranking since 1982. With a 66–37 victory at Pitt, Virginia won its third outright regular season title in five years. The Cavaliers won the 2018 ACC tournament, defeating North Carolina 71–63 in the ACC Championship Game. UVA earned the first overall seed in the NCAA tournament, but the next day lost ACC Sixth Man of the Year De'Andre Hunter to a broken wrist. The \"New York Daily News\" changed their pick from Virginia winning the national title to losing in the Sweet Sixteen after the injury. Virginia then notoriously lost to UMBC in the opening round, the first time since expansion in 1985 that a No. 1 seed lost to a No. 16, in the first ever regional to have its No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4 seeds all lose in the opening weekend. Bennett's even-keeled reaction was featured in \"Inc.\" magazine as a lesson in emotional intelligence and leadership. For defying rebuilding expectations to finish 31–3, Bennett won a third Henry Iba Award.\n2018–19: The Redemption National Championship.\nUVA opened the season with consecutive wins over ranked Big Ten teams, No. 25 Wisconsin (Battle 4 Atlantis) and No. 24 Maryland (ACC–Big Ten Challenge), the latter of which improved Bennett's record in the Challenge to 8–2. Diminutive (5'9\") point guard Kihei Clark, an unheralded three-star recruit who had initially committed to the UC Davis Aggies of the Big West Conference, started both games as a true freshman. The No. 4 Cavaliers routed No. 9 Virginia Tech 81–59 in the first time in series history that the two rivals met while both ranked in the top ten of the AP Poll. Virginia started the season 16–0 before falling at No. 1 Duke, 72–70. The game was viewed by 3.8 million people as the highest rated televised game of college basketball in the regular season, and was just the fourth in NCAA history between two teams both ranked number one as No. 4 Virginia was ranked first in the Coaches Poll before the loss. After a 16–2 ACC record, Virginia won a share of their fourth ACC regular season title in the past six years. UVA attained a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament, along with Duke and North Carolina, only the second time in NCAA history that three No. 1 seeds came from the same conference. Virginia was the only No. 1 seed to reach the Final Four after dispatching Gardner-Webb 71–56, Oklahoma 63–51, Oregon 53–49, and Purdue 80–75 in overtime. The Virginia–Purdue game in particular was called an \"instant classic\" by \"Sports Illustrated\" and \"USA Today\" after Carsen Edwards threw up extremely long-distance three pointers well beyond NBA range and seemingly could not miss, scoring over half the total for the red-hot Boilermakers with 42 points and, by far, a new scoring record against Bennett-coached teams. Mamadi Diakite and Clark played the heroes to save the season with a backtap rebound to Clark and his subsequent bullet pass and game-tying shot from Diakite with under 1 second left to force overtime. In the Final Four, Virginia defeated the Auburn Tigers by a single point, 63–62, as Kyle Guy drained three free throws with 0.6 seconds on the clock after an Auburn player undercut his lower body on the release of a corner three-pointer just as time expired. Reigning NCAA football champion and friend Dabo Swinney sent Bennett a text prior to the title game which he shared with the team: \"let the light that shines \"in\" you be brighter than the light that shines \"on\" you.\" Virginia did just that in a back-and-forth physical 2019 NCAA Tournament Championship Game to outlast fellow defensive stalwarts Texas Tech in overtime and win it by a score of 85–77. NABC Defensive Player of the Year redshirt sophomore De'Andre Hunter scored a career-high 27 points while holding Red Raider star Jarrett Culver to 15 points on 5-for-22 shooting. Thousands of fans lined the streets from Charlottesville–Albemarle Airport to John Paul Jones Arena the next day to welcome the team and Bennett back home. In light of the previous year's loss to UMBC, ESPN called Virginia's championship run \"the most redemptive season in the history of college basketball,\" and NBC Sports took it a step further by calling it \"the greatest redemption story in the history of sports.\" With little left to prove in the college game, Hunter, Jerome, and Guy forwent their remaining eligibility and all three were selected in the 2019 NBA draft; both Hunter and Jerome went in the first round. Bennett was named to a list of the World's 50 Greatest Leaders by \"Fortune\" magazine alongside such names as Special Counsel (and UVA Law alumnus) Robert Mueller, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, and Tim Cook of Apple.\n2019–20: COVID-shortened season, 11–1 down final stretch.\n\"The Athletic\" named Bennett the 2019 College Basketball Person of the Year in the article \"Tony Bennett: Humility and Grace made him a most deserving Champion\", lauding the five pillars and the foundation they set for the Virginia program. Bennett declined a raise when extending his contract before the season and UVA President James Ryan called him \"one of the most selfless people [he's] ever met.\" In \"CBS Sports\"' pre-season ranking, Matt Norlander opined Virginia has \"arguably the best coach going in the sport.\" The Cavaliers won the Hall of Fame Tip Off by defeating Arizona State in the championship game. After a wrist fracture injury to Braxton Key the team was blown out at Purdue, 69–40, in an Elite Eight rematch from the previous season. It was Bennett's first loss in the ACC–Big Ten Challenge since 2013. His Cavaliers rebounded to defeat No. 7 North Carolina, 56–47, continuing a home streak of 6–0 against the Tar Heels since 2013. Virginia also defeated No. 5 Florida State, No. 7 Duke, and No. 10 Louisville. In the Duke game, Durham native Jay Huff had 10 blocks to spur the Cavaliers to victory against the Blue Devils. By the end of the season, the No. 17 Cavaliers were 23–7, had won eight straight games, 11 of their final 12, and had earned the No. 2 seed in the cancelled ACC tournament. In the last game of the season the team defeated No. 10 Louisville, 57–54, and a subsequent \"FiveThirtyEight\" article revealed this squad's defense to be the most effective of any Tony Bennett coached team thus far. \"The Athletic\" called this team Bennett's true \"masterpiece\", succeeding with far less talent after the previous season's NCAA Championship team lost four starters to professional basketball. Mamadi Diakite and Braxton Key graduated on an 8-game ACC winning streak but without a chance to play in the unfinished 2020 ACC tournament or to defend their NCAA Championship.\n2020–21: ACC title and COVID troubles.\nVirginia opened as an early favorite to win another NCAA title two years out. However, Virginia was surprised 61–60 by unranked San Francisco in their second game, and the vaunted Cavalier defense broke down against No. 1 Gonzaga in a December neutral site game (in Fort Worth, Texas) allowing 60% shooting and 50% three-point shooting in a 98–75 loss. The program faced several postponed and canceled games due to COVID-19 outbreaks within the UVA and other basketball programs. The team rebounded to shut down No. 12 Clemson 85–50 on the road, Virginia's largest margin of victory in ACC games since 2015. When No. 9 Virginia defeated North Carolina for the seventh straight time, 60–48, it was the first time since 1966 that no UNC players scored in double figures. With that win, Bennett became the third ACC coach in history to have ten straight winning ACC seasons. Virginia clinched Bennett's fifth ACC regular season title in eight years with a victory at Louisville in the last game of the season, and was seeded No. 1 in the ACC tournament. One player had a positive COVID test following the team's quarterfinals victory over Syracuse, forcing a forfeit against Georgia Tech, which then received an effective bye to the championship game and won it. Nearly the entire UVA team was required to sit out of all team activities for seven days in quarantine after results of contact tracing; arriving a day late to the NCAA Tournament and without having practiced. Virginia's rival Louisville, which narrowly missed an NCAA bid, was put on standby in case UVA was unable to assemble a team with at least five eligible players against MAC champions Ohio. While cleared to play after being woken up for tests at 1:30 AM on the day of the game, the week in quarantine and late arrival did Virginia no favors as they shot 35% from the field and lost the game 62–58. After a highly productive 50–40–90 shooting output on the year and effective defensive play, junior Trey Murphy III was drafted 17th in the first round of the 2021 NBA draft.\n2021–22: Delivering a \"Punch in the Mouth\".\nThe \"Arizona Daily Star\" called Bennett the \"gold standard of college basketball coaching\" and the modern equivalent of Arizona's late Hall of Famer Lute Olson, but said Arizona fans needed to \"lower [their] expectations\"; Tommy Lloyd, coach-in-waiting at Gonzaga, took the job. Bennett signed transfers Armaan Franklin from Indiana and Jayden Gardner from East Carolina, after losing \"eight\" players to graduation, the NBA, and the transfer portal. The Cavaliers got off to their roughest start in a decade, losing 66–58 to Navy, 52–49 to James Madison, and 75–74 to Iowa in the ACC–Big Ten Challenge, dropping Bennett's Challenge record to 8–4. A 67–50 loss at JPJ to Clemson snapped an 11-game winning streak against the Tigers. Virginia returned the favor with a 10-point victory at Clemson, continuing a 6-game winning streak for UVA at Littlejohn Coliseum. A 74–58 road loss to North Carolina snapped a 7-game winning streak against the Tar Heels. Regaining composure, Bennett's Cavaliers held Paolo Banchero to single-digit scoring for the first time of his career as the team emerged from Cameron Indoor Stadium with a 69–68 win over AP No. 7 Duke in Mike Krzyzewski's final home game against Virginia, delivered by Reece Beekman's last-second three-pointer; Trevor Keels remarked that UVA had \"punched [them] in the mouth.\" The Cavaliers finished 12–8 in-conference, good enough for an 11th straight winning ACC season, but the 12 regular season losses were the most yielded by UVA during that span.\n2022–23: 6th ACC season title.\nVirginia opened the season by winning the Continental Tire Main Event championship belt, taking the opening game over No. 5 Baylor, 86–79, and defeating No. 19 Illinois in the championship game, 70–61. UVA defeated Michigan 70–68 at Ann Arbor in UVA's final ACC–Big Ten Challenge matchup, leaving Bennett with a 9–4 record in the Challenge, and Virginia at 14–8; tied for the 2nd-most Challenge wins out of 29 participating basketball programs in the ACC and Big Ten. The Cavaliers recorded an 8th consecutive home win in their rivalry with (pre-season AP No. 1) North Carolina, 67–58, in January, then defeated the Tar Heels again, 68–59, in the 2023 ACC Tournament quarterfinals. For the season, Virginia tied with Miami at 15–5 in ACC play to share the regular season title but lost to Duke, 59–49, in the ACC Tournament championship game; they lost to Furman in the NCAA Tournament, 68–67, on an errant pass and opposing three pointer with 2 seconds left.\n2023–24: Unusual Inconsistency.\nUVA was more inconsistent this year than in recent memory, but still finished 23–11 with a 13th straight winning (13–7) record in the ACC and a 12–1 record in games decided by less than 10 points. The team also lost ten games by double digits including blowout losses of 20 or more points to Wisconsin, at Memphis, at Notre Dame, at Virginia Tech, at Duke, and in the NCAA First Four to Colorado State. In particular, extreme shooting woes from several starters allowed defenses to focus entirely on locking down true threats like Reece Beekman and Isaac McKneely. Player development remained strong, as McKneely took several key steps toward becoming a more complete all-around player in addition to being an excellent catch-and-shoot sharpshooter.\nPlayer development.\nOnly the fourth former NBA player to win the NCAA Championship, Bennett has developed many of his players into NCAA All-Americans and NBA draft picks. Part of Bennett's philosophy is that it's a gift to be able to play (or coach) basketball at a high level and \"to give anything less than your best is to sacrifice the gift.\" To convey that to his players in the off-season, he's asked, \"if you played [last year's version of] yourself one-on-one, could you dominate yourself now? If you can't say yes, then you have not done your job improving.\"\nAn opposing coach discussed Bennett's reputation for player development to CBS Sports in 2016, stating that he \"gets the bigger picture that it's more than just basketball, and his players develop at a high level and become pros.\" Bennett's methods of recruiting and development have been compared to the San Antonio Spurs (because of that NBA franchise's commitment to unselfishness and \"team\" success under Coach Popovich).\nNBA.\nEleven of Bennett's players at Virginia and Washington State have been drafted into the NBA. Three of them have become widely known for their shooting prowess. Joe Harris is one of the NBA's All-Time Top 5 shooters in three-point field goal shooting percentage, led the league in 2018–19 and 2020–21, and won the Three-Point Contest over Stephen Curry at the 2019 NBA All-Star Game. Malcolm Brogdon is a member of the NBA's exclusive 50–40–90 club for extreme shooters, and Klay Thompson is, with Curry, one of the Splash Brothers of the four-time NBA champion Golden State Warriors. \nBoth of Bennett's players who won NABC Defensive Player of the Year (Brogdon and De'Andre Hunter) later became NBA starters.\nUndrafted Bennett players to see significant NBA minutes include Mamadi Diakite (Milwaukee Bucks and Cleveland Cavaliers), Anthony Gill (Washington Wizards), Sam Hauser (Boston Celtics), Braxton Key (Detroit Pistons), and Aron Baynes (5 teams).\nProfessional.\nOther Bennett players to play in professional basketball leagues around the globe include London Perrantes, Mike Tobey, Jack Salt, Akil Mitchell, Darion Atkins, Marcus Capers, Mustapha Farrakhan Jr., Sylven Landesberg, Laurynas Mikalauskas, Jerome Meyinsse, Austin Nichols, Taylor Rochestie, and Sammy Zeglinski.\nCollege.\nSix Virginia Cavaliers have developed under Bennett into winning NCAA All-America honors and/or national awards.\nNABC Defensive Player of the Year\nLefty Driesell Award\nNCAA Tournament Most Outstanding Player\nFirst Team All-American\nSecond Team All-American\nThird Team All-American\nOff-court.\nThe Bennett family has pledged $500,000 to fund a career development program specifically for current and former members of the Virginia basketball program who are beginning or advancing careers away from basketball.\nPersonal life.\nBennett is married and has two children, one son and one daughter. Bennett met his wife Laurel (née Purcell) at a church in nearby North Carolina, while he was playing for the Charlotte Hornets. He is a Christian and would likely have become a pastor if not a college basketball coach. He has spoken about his faith saying, \"When you have a relationship with the Lord, there's a peace and perspective you have. The world didn't give it, and the world can't take it away.\" Bennett has also cited his faith as impacting his coaching philosophy, in particular his use of his father's \"Five Pillars\": humility, passion, unity, servanthood, and thankfulness.\nThe best known member of a talented coaching family tree, he is the son of former head coach Dick Bennett (Washington State, Wisconsin, Green Bay, and Wisconsin–Stevens Point) and brother of former head coach Kathi Bennett (Northern Illinois and Indiana). The frustrating \"pack line\" defense that the younger Bennett has perfected at Virginia was first implemented in an earlier form by the elder Bennett up until Tony took over head coaching duties from his father at Washington State.\nCareer playing statistics.\nSources\nNCAA.\n^ NCAA Record\nHead coaching record.\nAgainst rivals.\nBennett has a winning record against each of the team's ACC rivals and has drawn praise from rival coaches. Hall of Famer Rick Pitino (1–5 against Bennett) of Louisville said, \"there is no such thing as post-play against Virginia\"; similarly former Virginia Tech coach Buzz Williams (3–8 against Bennett) called Virginia's system \"offensively \"and\" defensively elite.\"\nBennett is 60–26 in UVA's rivalry games versus Virginia Tech, Louisville, Maryland, and North Carolina. Bennett has \"flipped the script\" against North Carolina in particular, winning a majority of those rivalry games, including the 2018 ACC tournament championship, against a program that had continually frustrated Virginia (in several ACC tournaments and the 1981 Final Four) when the two conference rivals perennially topped college basketball polls of the early 1980s. Bennett's UVA teams went a perfect 7–0 in his final seven games against Hall of Famer Roy Williams (7–12 against Bennett) to close out a friendly rivalry during the final five years of Williams' tenure at UNC (during which period both Williams, in 2017; and Bennett, in 2019; won NCAA Championships with their respective programs). The prior best streak for Virginia against North Carolina was six straight wins, more than a century earlier, from 1911 to 1916 under program founder Pop Lannigan."

        "title": "Red Horse Racing",
        "text": "Red Horse Racing was an American professional stock car racing team that last competed in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series. The team was based in Mooresville, North Carolina. It was co-owned by former Mobil 1 marketing executive Tom DeLoach and \"Fox NASCAR\" broadcaster Jeff Hammond, who bought the team from the family team of Brandon Whitt, Clean Line Motorsports. The team last fielded the No. 7 Toyota Tundra full-time for Brett Moffitt, and the No. 17 Tundra full-time for Timothy Peters. The team was noticeably known for often having no sponsors on their trucks despite fielding multiple full-time entries for many seasons. This situation could only last so long as on May 22, 2017, DeLoach announced that the team would shut down effective immediately due to a lack of funding.\nCamping World Truck Series.\nTruck No. 1 history.\nThe No.1 team originated in 2009 at Daytona with 2008 Truck Series champion, Johnny Benson behind the wheel. Benson would score 4 Top 10 finishes with a best of 2nd at Kansas. He would be released after a 4th place finish at Texas due to lack of sponsorship. He was 7th in the Standings. Caitlyn Shaw would drive the No. 1 at Indianapolis Raceway Park to a 24th place finish. Timothy Peters would move from his usual No. 17 to the No. 1 to win the Kroger 200 at Martinsville Speedway.\nTruck No. 7 history.\nThe No. 7 team originated in 2012, when John King drove the No. 7 to win the NextEra Energy 250, despite him being in two crashes. On March 23, 2015, Gray Gaulding joined the team on a limited schedule, making his debut at Martinsville. That race would be his only start with the team. The No. 7 took the place of the No. 11 entry in 2017, with Brett Moffitt driving.\nTruck No. 11 history.\nThe No. 11 truck debuted in 2009 as the No. 1 truck with defending champion Johnny Benson at the wheel. On June 8, 2009, the team announced that the No. 1 truck would be shut down due to a lack of sponsorship, leaving Benson without a ride to defend the title he won in 2008. Peters would join Red Horse after the Texas race after merging his team, Premier Racing with Red Horse. The team returned in 2010 as the No. 7 Tundra, fielding 2009 ARCA RE/MAX Series champion Justin Lofton who competed for Rookie of the Year honors. Lofton would finish second to Austin Dillon in ROTY points, but was released at season's end. He was replaced by Brazil native Miguel Paludo, who brought sponsorship from Stemco Duroline. Paludo managed a few top tens but was outpaced mostly by Peters. Paludo left after 2011 to join Turner Motorsports. Paludo was replaced by rookie John King for the 2012 season. During the first race of the season, the NextEra Energy Resources 250, King won his first Camping World Truck Series race. After the first five races, Red Horse was forced to shut down the No. 7 team due to a lack of sponsorship. The team was revived to field Parker Kligerman after his release from Brad Keselowski Racing. Kligerman would score his first career win at Talladega and finished 5th in points. Kligerman moved up to the Nationwide Series with Kyle Busch Motorsports, and would be replaced by John Wes Townley for 2013. As Townley moved to the Wauters Motorsports No. 5 Zaxby's Toyota Tundra for 2014, Brian Ickler took over the seat of the No. 7 truck with Bullet Liner as the primary sponsor. However, on May 20, the team announced the No. 7 will be suspended due to lack of funding, and to increase focus on Quiroga and Peters' teams. Ickler returned for one-race deal in Las Vegas.\nOn December 17, 2014, Red Horse announced Ben Kennedy would drive in 2015, reviving the No. 11. Kennedy left the team on April 15, 2016. Five days later, Matt Tifft was announced as Kennedy's replacement in the No. 11. Tifft would run a few races before being sidelined with disc problem in his back, as well as having surgery to remove a tumor in his brain. German Quiroga drove at Texas in June. Brett Moffitt also drove the No. 11 and won his first career Camping World Truck Series race at Michigan, passing his teammate Timothy Peters and William Byron on the final lap of the race.\nTruck No. 17 history.\nMidway through 2009, Timothy Peters joined RHR from Premier Racing with Strutmasters sponsorship, and earned his first win at Martinsville Speedway. Peters returned to the team in 2010 and scored his second win at Daytona en route to finishing 6th in points for the year. Peters returned to the team for 2011 but had Butch Hylton as crew chief. The team won at Lucas Oil Raceway at Indianapolis and finished fifth in points. For 2012, Peters stayed in the top 5 in points for the whole season scoring wins at Iowa and leading flag-to-flag at Bristol. Peters would finish 2nd in points. In 2013, Peters had a rough season, finishing 10th in points only winning at Iowa. He rebounded the following year, leading the point standings for three weeks in the early stages of the year and triumphing at Talladega Superspeedway en route to a fifth place finish in points. Taking on a leadership role within the organization in 2015 as the veteran on the team, Peters rebounded from early-season struggles to record two wins (one from the pole) and again finish fifth in points. Driving alongside a varying driver rotation in 2016, Peters qualified for the inaugural Truck Series Chase, made it to the final round, and finished fourth.\nTruck No. 77 history.\nRed Horse Racing debuted in 2004 as Clean Line Motorsports. It was owned by Daniel Whitt and fielded the No. 38 Ford for his son Brandon. The team debuted at Mesa Marin Speedway finishing 19th. Clean Line was purchased by retired Mobil Oil executive Tom DeLoach, and championship crew chief/sports commentator Jeff Hammond before the 2005 season and was renamed Red Horse Racing. Whitt grabbed the team's first win at Memphis from the pole.\nFor the 2006 season, David Starr, former driver of the No. 75 Spears Chevy Silverado, drove the team's Toyotas, which switched from No. 38 to No. 11. Starr then won the fourth race of the season at Martinsville and finished fourth in the standings. Despite their success, the team was forced to release Starr at the end of the year due to a lack of sponsorship. He was replaced by Aaron Fike in 2007, and the team switched numbers again, to No. 1. After Fike was arrested in Ohio for drug use, Busch Series drivers David Green and Jason Leffler rounded out the season for the team, and Whitt returned at Atlanta. For 2008, David Starr returned to RHR after departing for Circle Bar Racing, with the team running the No. 11. The team's reunion would garner them four top fives and eight top tens but only a 12th-place points finish. Starr would again depart the team, taking new sponsor Zachry Holdings with him to HT Motorsports. Red Horse would bring along former ARCA driver T. J. Bell, who had five top-tens and finished fifteenth in points. The team switched to the No. 1 and hired former Formula 1 driver Nelson Piquet Jr. briefly. The team returned as the No. 11 truck in 2012, with Todd Bodine. Though the deal was originally intended for Daytona, the team ran the full season with limited sponsorship, with Bodine returning to victory lane at Dover. At the end of the season, Bodine was unable to come up with the sponsorship to return, and left the team.\nFor 2013, 3-time NASCAR Toyota Series champion Germán Quiroga would replace Bodine in the renumbered 77 truck, with Net10 Wireless sponsoring 12 races. OtterBox would sign on as a nine race sponsor in June. In July, Quiroga became the first Mexican-born driver to win a pole in a NASCAR national series race, breaking the Truck Series qualifying record at Iowa Speedway. Quiroga earned two third-place finishes and six total top tens to finish 13th in points.\nQuiroga returned to the 77 truck in 2014 with veteran crew chief Butch Hylton, and came close to winning on several occasions. In June, Quiroga battled Darrell Wallace Jr. in the closing laps at Gateway Motorsports Park, ultimately finishing second. In August, Quiroga would battle Ryan Blaney at Canadian Tire Motorsports Park, passing Blaney through the final two turns before Blaney got back around him on the front stretch. At Martinsville in October, Quiroga made a daring three-wide pass with 13 laps to go, spinning out and settling for 10th place. At Texas in November, Quiroga led 12 laps late in the race before being passed by Kyle Busch on a green-white-checker restart, then spinning out racing his teammate Timothy Peters on the last lap. Quiroga scored three top fives and 10 top tens en route to a 6th-place points finish. Quiroga didn't return with Red Horse Racing in 2015, and moving the No. 77 points to the No. 11 points.\nNationwide Series.\nCar No. 71 history.\nThe team has made one Nationwide Series start with Truck Series driver, Justin Lofton in the No. 71 WeekendWarriorsTV.com Toyota Camry at Texas Motor Speedway in the 2010 O'Reilly 300 and finished 37th after starting 31st."

        "title": "Kyle Wright (American football)",
        "text": "Kyle Wright (born October 18, 1984) is a former American football quarterback. He was signed by the Minnesota Vikings as an undrafted free agent in 2008 and was also a member of the San Francisco 49ers. He played college football at the University of Miami.\nEarly years.\nWright began his high school career as starting quarterback on the Vintage High School JV team, in Napa, California. Following his freshman year, he transferred to Monte Vista High in Danville, becoming the second-string quarterback for his first year and the starter his remaining 2 years. Wright was widely regarded as the nation's top high school quarterback for the 2002–2003 season, during which he was named the Gatorade National Player of the Year and SuperPrep National Player of the Year, as well as being ranked the fifth best overall player in the nation by both Scout recruiting magazine He participated in the 2003 U.S. Army All-American Bowl game.\nAdditionally, Wright was ranked the best pro-style quarterback in the class of 2003 by rivals.com while his cross-town rival, San Ramon Valley High School quarterback Sam Keller, future quarterback of ASU and Nebraska, was ranked ninth.\nUltimately, he chose Miami over offers from many other schools including Florida State, Southern California, and Tennessee.\nCollege career.\nWright graduated from high school a semester early and enrolled at the University of Miami for the 2003 spring semester amidst great expectation that he would be the next great quarterback at “Quarterback U.” and continue in the lineage of Jim Kelly, Bernie Kosar, Vinny Testaverde, Steve Walsh, Craig Erickson, Gino Torretta, Ryan Clement and Ken Dorsey. Wright was redshirted for the 2003 season and spent the following season as Brock Berlin's backup before an ankle injury and an allergic reaction to a bee sting effectively ended his season after only a few games. With Berlin having graduated, Miami's starting quarterback job was open heading into the 2005 season. During spring practice, Wright performed well and earned the starting position over redshirt freshman Kirby Freeman.\n2005 season.\nWright's first season as a starter showed his potential. A highlight came on November 12, 2005, when Wright tied a school-record by tossing 5 touchdown passes in a 47–17 blowout victory against Wake Forest.\nWright led Miami to a 9–3 record, the same as the previous season season, including wins over nationally ranked Clemson and Virginia Tech. In the opening 10–7 loss to FSU, despite multiple dropped passes, Miami outgained FSU 313 yards to 170. Two missed field goals and a botched snap on a third fg attempt from 28 yards out to tie the game did them in. Wright and the Hurricanes rebounded by winning 8 straight games (including a 27–7 win over previously unbeaten Virginia Tech in Blacksburg) and climbed to the #3 spot in both polls. However, Wright struggled against some of the better teams on Miami's schedule (12 of his 18 touchdown passes came against teams with a losing record: Duke, Temple, and Wake Forest), and the 3-loss season included a 40–3 blowout loss to LSU in the Peach Bowl.\nWright had a promising and productive season, as he led the ACC in touchdown passes (18), was second in pass efficiency to Virginia Tech's Marcus Vick, and was the only Honorable Mention All-ACC selection at quarterback.\n2006 season.\nExpectations were big for Wright heading into the 2006 season. Miami changed offensive coordinators, hiring Rich Olson, and implemented a new offense. Wright was selected as the quarterback on the Preseason All-ACC team, and finished second to Georgia Tech receiver Calvin Johnson in balloting for the ACC Preseason Player of the Year. Wright was also named to the Maxwell Award watchlist, and was projected as a potential Heisman Trophy candidate.\nWright played well at times but failed to meet the big preseason expectations for him, his struggles mirroring those of the team in general, which fell out of national championship contention by the third game of the season. In 9 games, Wright threw for 1,655 yards, 8 touchdowns, and 7 interceptions, and completed 60.8% of his passes.\nWright was booed during Miami's 17–10 homecoming loss to Virginia Tech, a game in which he threw two critical interceptions and played what was viewed as the worst game of his career. As Wright left the field, angry Miami fans berated him. Wright's father, who was in the area and hearing the vulgar insults, then engaged in a profanity laced tirade with those fans, and was restrained by Orange Bowl security and threatened with arrest by Miami Athletic Director when he started to exhibit aggressive behavior. After cooling off, Mr. Wright stated he was merely trying to stick up for his son.\nWright fractured his thumb during the loss to Virginia Tech, and the injury kept him out of the team's game the next week, a loss at Maryland. He underwent thumb surgery a week later, which caused him to miss the remainder of the 2006 season. He was replaced by Kirby Freeman for the remainder of the season. Freeman led Miami to a 2–2 record including a season ending upset of Boston College and a narrow win over Nevada in the MPC Computers Bowl on New Year's Eve.\n2007 season.\nThe University of Miami promoted Randy Shannon to head coach and hired their third Offensive coordinator in three years, Patrick Nix from Georgia Tech. On August 28, 2007, Head Coach Randy Shannon named Kirby Freeman the starting quarterback over Kyle Wright for the season-opening game against Marshall. In two starts, Freeman went 12-of-30 for 98 yards with one touchdown and one interception, placing Miami 118th out of 119 major college schools in passing offense both in average yards per game and yards per attempt. On September 11, 2007, Shannon announced that Wright would reclaim his starting role for the September 15th game against FIU. The Hurricanes were 4–2 with Wright as the starter, including wins over FSU and nationally ranked Texas A&amp;M, compared to 5–7 overall that year. An injury forced Wright to miss the team's final 4 games, the Hurricanes lost all four. Kyle Wright finished his final season with Miami by passing for 1,747 yards, and 12 touchdowns, and rushing for 66 yards and 3 touchdowns.\nAt the conclusion of his collegiate career, Wright's final statistics were as follows: 5,835 passing yards, 38 touchdowns, 31 interceptions. He rushed for −99 yards and 4 scores.\nProfessional career.\nMinnesota Vikings.\nFollowing the conclusion of his Miami career, Wright worked out with quarterbacks coach Tom Martinez in Northern California. In April 2008, Wright told the \"Miami Herald\" he expected to be selected in the NFL Draft, most likely on day two.\nWright was not drafted, but on April 28, 2008, signed a free agent contract with the Minnesota Vikings. He was waived by the team on July 2.\nSan Francisco 49ers.\nOn July 7, it was announced that the San Francisco 49ers had claimed Wright off waivers from the Vikings while waiving quarterback Drew Olson to make room."

        "text": "Elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame for 2006 proceeded in keeping with rules enacted in 2001, augmented by a special election; the result was the largest class of inductees (18) in the Hall's history, including the first woman elected, Effa Manley.\nThe Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) held an election to select from among recent players, voting Bruce Sutter into the Hall. On July 26, 2005, the Hall announced that its board of directors had approved a special election to be held in 2006, by the Committee on African-American Baseball, of Negro leagues and pre-Negro leagues candidates. The Committee selected 17 players and executives for induction.\nThe Veterans Committee did not hold an election; the 2001 rules changes provided that elections for players retired over 20 years would be held every other year, with elections of non-players (managers, umpires and executives) held every fourth year. The Committee voted in 2005 on players who were active no later than 1983; there was no 2005 election for non-players. Elections in both categories were held in 2007.\nInduction ceremonies in Cooperstown were held July 30 with Commissioner Bud Selig presiding.\nThe BBWAA election.\nThe BBWAA was again authorized to elect players active in 1986 or later, but not after 2000; the ballot, announced on November 28, 2005, included candidates from the 2005 ballot who received at least 5% of the vote but were not elected, along with selected players, chosen by a screening committee, whose last appearance was in 2000. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote.\nVoters were instructed to cast votes for up to 10 candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall. Results of the 2006 election by the BBWAA were announced on January 10. The ballot consisted of 29 players; 520 ballots were cast, with 390 votes required for election. A total of 2933 individual votes were cast, an average of 5.64 per ballot. Those candidates receiving less than 5% of the vote will not appear on future BBWAA ballots, but may eventually be considered by the Veterans Committee.\nPete Rose, who last played in 1986, was again not included on the ballot due to his banishment from baseball in what was theoretically his final opportunity, as players retired over 20 years can not be considered by the BBWAA under current rules; however, Hall of Fame chair Jane Forbes Clark indicated prior to the ballot announcement that if Rose is ever reinstated by Major League Baseball, the Hall's board of directors might review the rules in light of the fact that Rose never had an opportunity to appear on a BBWAA ballot.\nCandidates who were eligible for the first time are indicated here with a dagger (†). The candidate who received at least 75% of the vote and was elected is indicated in bold italics; candidates who have since been selected in subsequent elections are indicated in \"italics\". The candidates who received less than 5% of the vote, thus becoming ineligible for future BBWAA consideration, are indicated with an asterisk (*).\nThe newly eligible candidates included 18 All-Stars, six of whom were not on the ballot, representing 46 selections. Only two players were named to five or more All-Star Games: Will Clark (six times) and Albert Belle (five). Included in the class were three Rookie of the Year Award winners (Dwight Gooden, Ozzie Guillén and Walt Weiss) and two Cy Young Award winners (Orel Hershiser and Dwight Gooden).\nPlayers eligible for the first time who were \"not\" included on the ballot were: Rich Amaral, Tim Belcher, Stan Belinda, Gerónimo Berroa, Sean Berry, Mark Clark, Dave Eiland, Kevin Elster, Eric Gunderson, Juan Guzmán, Carlos Hernández, Thomas Howard, Jeff Huson, Lance Johnson, Scott Kamieniecki, Roberto Kelly, Jim Leyritz, Mike Maddux, Mickey Morandini, Mike Munoz, Jaime Navarro, Charlie O'Brien, Steve Ontiveros, Luis Polonia, Jim Poole, Jeff Reed, Heathcliff Slocumb, Mike Stanley, Lenny Webster, and Mark Whiten.\nThe Committee on African-American Baseball.\nIn July 2000, the Hall was given a $250,000 grant from Major League Baseball to begin a comprehensive study on African Americans in baseball from 1860–1960, with the hope of enhancing the Hall's collections in these areas. In February 2001, the Hall selected three historians – Dr. Larry Hogan, Dick Clark and Larry Lester – to conduct the study, which involved over 50 other researchers and authors. The resulting study was a narrative, bibliography, and statistical database, including 3,000 day-by-day records, league leaders and all-time leaders, collected from box scores in 128 newspapers of sanctioned Negro league games played from 1920–1954. The box scores reflect almost 100% of games of the 1920s, over 90% of the games played in the 1930s, and 50-70% of games in the 1940s and 1950s. In February 2006, \"National Geographic\" published a book featuring material from the study, in conjunction with the Hall, called \"Shades of Glory\"; it covers not only the development of the game, but also its impact within the African American community. \"Pride and Passion\", an exhibit focusing on the history of African American baseball, debuted at the Hall's museum in April 2006.\nScreening process.\nIn July 2005 the Hall's board of directors appointed two expert committees, a screening committee of five and a voting committee of twelve. Former Commissioner of Baseball Fay Vincent served as the non-voting chairman of both committees and Hall of Famer Frank Robinson served as an advisor and assistant to Vincent and the committees. Written recommendations from fans and non-committee members were accepted through October 2005 (stage one). From the many candidates recommended, 94 were selected for consideration by the screening committee. These second-stage nominations were the first ones published (stage two). \nNewt Allen – Walter Ball – Sam Bankhead – Bernardo Baró – John Beckwith – William Bell – Ed Bolden – Chet Brewer – Chester Brooks – Dave Brown – Larry Brown – Ray Brown – Willard Brown – Bill Byrd – Rev Cannady – Bill Cash – Phil Cockrell – Pancho Coimbre – Andy Cooper – Bingo DeMoss – Rap Dixon – John Donaldson – Frank Duncan – José Fernández – Bud Fowler – Jelly Gardner – Charlie Grant – Frank Grant – Gus Greenlee – Vic Harris – Pete Hill – Bill Holland – Sammy T.

The committee members and listed areas of expertise were Adrian Burgos (Latin America), Dick Clark (Negro leagues), Larry Hogan (overall history), Larry Lester (Negro leagues) and Jim Overmyer (eastern teams and 19th century). They cut the 94 nominees to ten pre-Negro leagues and 29 Negro leagues candidates (stage three).\nThe following candidates appeared on the two final ballots:\nNegro leagues:\nNewt Allen – John Beckwith – William Bell – Chet Brewer – Ray Brown – Willard Brown – Bill Byrd – Andy Cooper – Rap Dixon – John Donaldson – Sammy T.

Wilkinson – Jud Wilson\nPre-Negro leagues:\nFrank Grant – Pete Hill – Home Run Johnson – José Méndez – Spottswood Poles – Dick Redding – Louis Santop – Ben Taylor – Sol White\nAccording to Hall president Dale Petroskey, \"The screening committee did a great job of handling the first step of narrowing the list of candidates to those who should be seriously considered for election to the Hall of Fame.\" Vincent added, \"I'm very satisfied with the work done by the screening committee. The committee members had some difficult choices to make, but because they are extremely knowledgeable, had strong research at their disposal and spent a great deal of time reviewing all candidates thoroughly, they did a tremendous job. The final ballots represent players, managers, executives and builders who are top-tier candidates and worthy of review for consideration for election to the Hall of Fame.\"\nFinal ballots.\nThe 39 candidates on the final ballots were announced on November 21. The voting committee met in Tampa, Florida on February 25 for two days of discussion, after which they cast paper ballots with a \"yes\" or \"no\" for every candidate. Those who received \"yes\" votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be elected. The seven additional voting committee members and listed areas of expertise were Todd Bolton (Latin America), Greg Bond (19th century), Ray Doswell (overall history), Leslie Heaphy (women's history, Negro leagues), Rob Ruck (Negro leagues eastern teams), Sammy Miller (eastern and western teams), and Robert W. Peterson (overall history). Ruck replaced Neil Lanctot, author of two books on Negro league baseball. Peterson died on February 11, but he had submitted an absentee ballot two days earlier and the other committee members voted unanimously to accept it.\nThe results were announced February 27: seventeen new members had been elected to the Hall. All were deceased. The Newark-based executive Effa Manley would be the first woman in the Hall of Fame. \nVote counts were not announced but the twelve-person committee evidently cast at least 153 \"yes\" votes (seventeen times nine) or at least 13 per voter on average. The inductees brought to 35 the number of Negro leagues and pre-leagues figures elected to the Hall, the first being Satchel Paige in 1971.\nAccording to the contemporary press release by the Hall of Fame [\"Seventeen ...\"], \nits chairwoman Jane Forbes Clark stated, \"The Board of Directors is extremely pleased with how this project has evolved over the last five years – culminating in today's vote. Over the last two days, this committee has held discussions in great detail, utilizing the research and statistics now available to determine who deserves baseball's highest honor – a plaque in the Hall of Fame Gallery in Cooperstown.\" Major League Baseball had funded the prior scholarly study. Its commissioner Bud Selig said, \"I applaud the National Baseball Hall of Fame for conducting this special election of former Negro league stars, and I heartily congratulate those who were elected. ... Eighteen Negro league stars had been elected prior to today's vote, but previous committees had overlooked many who were deserving. Major League Baseball is proud to have played a part in a process that has corrected some of those omissions.\"\nJ. G. Taylor Spink Award.\nTracy Ringolsby received the J. G. Taylor Spink Award honoring a baseball writer. (The award was voted at the December 2005 meeting of the BBWAA, dated 2005, and conferred in the summer 2006 ceremonies.)\nThe Spink Award has been presented by the BBWAA at the annual summer induction ceremonies since 1962. It recognizes a sportswriter \"for meritorious contributions to baseball writing\". The recipients are not members of the Hall of the Fame, merely featured in a permanent exhibit at the National Baseball Museum, but writers and broadcasters commonly call them \"Hall of Fame writers\" or words to that effect. Living recipients were members of the Veterans Committee for elections in odd years 2003 to 2007.\nThree final candidates, selected by a BBWAA committee, were named on July 12, 2005 in Detroit in conjunction with All-Star Game activities; the finalists were: Joe Goddard of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\"; the late Vern Plagenhoef, who covered the Detroit Tigers for Michigan's Booth Newspaper Group; and Tracy Ringolsby, who has covered the Colorado Rockies for the \"Rocky Mountain News\" since 1993 and has written on baseball for 30 years. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to cast ballots in voting conducted by mail in November.\nOn December 7, Tracy Ringolsby was announced as the recipient, having received 225 votes out of the 429 ballots cast, with Goddard receiving 128 votes and Plagenhoef receiving 76.\nFord C. Frick Award.\nGene Elston received the Ford C. Frick Award honoring a baseball broadcaster.\nThe Frick Award has been presented at the annual summer induction ceremonies since 1978. It recognizes a broadcaster for \"major contributions to baseball\". The recipients are not members of the Hall of the Fame, merely featured in a permanent exhibit at the National Baseball Museum, but writers and broadcasters commonly call them \"Hall of Fame broadcaster\" or words to that effect. Living honorees were members of the Veterans Committee for elections in odd years 2003 to 2007.\nOn December 6, 2005, the ten finalists were announced. In accordance with guidelines established in 2003, seven were chosen by a research committee at the museum: Tom Cheek, Ken Coleman, Dizzy Dean, Gene Elston, Tony Kubek, Denny Matthews, and Graham McNamee. Three additional candidates – Bill King, Dave Niehaus, and Jacques Doucet – were selected through results of voting by fans conducted throughout November at the Hall's official website; more than 105,000 votes were cast. Photos and profiles of the ten candidates can be found at the Hall's website.\nOn February 21, Gene Elston was announced as the 2006 recipient ; best known for his 25 years of broadcasting Houston Astros games from 1962 to 1986, he was selected in a January vote by a committee composed of the 14 living recipients, along with six additional broadcasting historians or columnists: Bob Costas (NBC), Barry Horn (\"The Dallas Morning News\"), Stan Isaacs (formerly of New York \"Newsday\"), Ted Patterson (historian), Curt Smith (historian) and Larry Stewart (\"Los Angeles Times\"). The ballots were cast prior to the death of Curt Gowdy on February 20. The members voted by mail, and based the selection on the following criteria: longevity; continuity with a club; honors, including national assignments such as the World Series and All-Star Games; and popularity with fans.\nFurther reading.\nHall of Fame publications (from the Internet Archive):"

        "text": "The Denmark men's national basketball team () represents Denmark in international basketball competition. The national team is controlled by the Danish Basketball Association.\nThe Denmark national team competed regularly at the EuroBasket in the 1950s, the top European tournament. Their best appearance came in 1951. Although since then, the team has struggled to maintain consistency to challenge the international elites. Denmark also has yet to reach qualification to play on the global stage at the FIBA World Cup.\nHistory.\nEuroBasket 1951.\nDenmark debuted in the European championships at the EuroBasket 1951 in Paris. They were defeated in all of their preliminary round games, going 0–4. They ended up in last place in their group. In a direct elimination match against Luxembourg, Denmark took a 46–45 lead with 5 seconds left. A final half-court shot by Luxembourg bounced off the rim, giving Denmark its first ever win at the EuroBasket tournament and advancing the team to the first classification round. They picked up another win there, against Scotland, finishing in third place in the group at 1–2. Their third win of the tournament came against Portugal in the 13th–16th place classification semifinal. Denmark then lost to Switzerland in the 13th/14th place match to finish 14th of the 18 teams with a record of 3–7.\nEuroBasket 1953.\nTwo years later, at the EuroBasket 1953 in Moscow, Denmark did not fare as well. They dropped eight of their matches (three in the preliminary round, three in the first classification round, and the two-second-round classification games) on their way to a 16th-place finish out of the 17 teams in the tournament.\nEuroBasket 1955.\nAt the EuroBasket 1955 in Budapest, the national team struggled there as well just as they did at the prior EuroBasket. Losing all eight of their matches in non competitive fashion, this time they finished in last place of the 18 teams at the event.\nLater years.\nAfter the EuroBasket 1955, the Danish national team regressed and never qualified for a major tournament again. Though, they did achieve some success on a lower level, at the European Championship for Small Countries, where they won Gold in 2010.\nTeam.\nCurrent roster.\nRoster for the EuroBasket 2025 Pre-Qualifiers matches on 23 and 26 February 2024 against Georgia and Finland.\nPast rosters.\n1951 EuroBasket: finished 14th among 18 teams\n3 Knud Lundberg, 4 Knud Norskov, 5 Erik Korsbjerg, 6 Erik Wilbek, 7 Peter Tantholdt, 8 Belger Can, 9 Bent Sondergaard, 10 Erik Melbye, 11 Sven Thomsen, 12 John Christensen, 13 Ove Nielsen, 14 Kai Sogaard, 15 Erik Carlsen, 16 Niels Mygind (Coach: ?)\n1953 EuroBasket: finished 16th among 17 teams\n3 Kai Sorensen, 4 Knud Norskov, 5 Knud Lundberg, 6 Peter Tantholdt, 7 John Christensen, 8 Erik Madsen, 10 Torben Starup-Hansen, 11 Ivan Rasmussen, 12 Ove Nielsen, 13 Erik Wilbek, 14 Pierre Meilsej, 15 Willi Mouritsen, 16 John Nielsen (Coach: ?)\n1955 EuroBasket: finished 18th among 18 teams\n3 Kai Sogaard, 4 Erik Korsbjerg, 5 Peter Tantholdt, 6 Pierre Meilsej, 7 An Lillelund, 8 Ivan Rasmussen, 9 Ove Nielsen, 10 T Storup, 11 P Hintz, 12 T Malmquist, 13 Willi Mouritsen, 14 S Sparre (Coach: ?)"

        "title": "Portugal men's national basketball team",
        "text": "The Portugal men's national basketball team () represents Portugal in international basketball competition. The team is controlled by the Portuguese Basketball Federation.\nPortugal doesn't have much history on the international stage, although they have qualified for the EuroBasket three times (1951, 2007, 2011).\nWhile Portugal has made multiple appearances at the continental level, they continue their quest to qualify for the global stage at the FIBA World Cup.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nThe Portuguese Basketball Federation was founded in 1927, with the national team playing in their first match on 24 May 1931, a 9–32 defeat to France. Portugal would become a co-founder of FIBA in 1932. Three years later, in 1935, Portugal played in the only qualifying game for the first European Basketball Championship. The Portuguese lost the game 33–12 against Spain, which eliminated the team from qualification.\nEuroBasket 1951.\nAfter Portugal's failed attempt to qualify for the European Championship in 1935, and declining to enter the competition multiple times thereafter, Portugal made their debut at the Euros for EuroBasket 1951 in Paris. The national team got off to a lethargic start to begin the tournament, as they lost 35–81 in their first ever match in the event to Greece. In Portugal's final two games of the preliminary round, the team would fall once again to Bulgaria, but would pick up their first official victory in the competition with a walkover win after Romania withdrew. With a record of (1–2), and sitting in third place in the group, Portugal could not progress any further; and was relegated to the classification rounds. In the classification phase, Portugal lost its first two matches against West Germany and Austria, but would pullout a close win over Switzerland 49–52. Finishing with a duplicate record of (1–2) once again, Portugal was sent to the classification play-offs to determine 13th–16th place. The national team would go on to lose their match to Denmark, before turning around to defeat Scotland, to end the event placing 15th overall out of the 18 teams.\nEuroBasket 2007.\nAt the conclusion of Portugal's first appearance at the European Championship in 1951, the national team would fail to make it back to the competition for the next five decades. However, Portugal would end their drought when they made their second appearance on the continental stage at EuroBasket 2007 (\"first time through qualification\") by finishing first in their group during the qualifiers.\nEntering the preliminary round, Portugal's first match of the tournament came against the hosts Spain, where the team suffered a heavy defeat 56–82. After dropping their second game of the competition to Croatia, Portugal earned a crucial victory in their final preliminary phase match against Latvia 77–67. The important win over Latvia ultimately was enough to propel the team into the second round of the tournament for the first time.\nPortugal began the second round with a loss against Russia, who eventually went on to become champions of the competition; before picking up a solid victory in their second game of the round versus Israel 94–85. Although with an opportunity to advance to the quarter-finals all but gone, Portugal would easily be defeated by Greece 85–67 in their final game of the event. Nevertheless, the performance displayed by Portugal throughout the tournament was their best showing at the Euros ever to that point; which ensured the national team a top ten finish.\nEuroBasket 2011.\nAfter missing out on qualification for the EuroBasket in 2009, Portugal was successful during the qualifiers for EuroBasket 2011. Portugal was placed into Group A to begin the tournament, where they would meet Turkey in their first match. However, the team was outplayed from start to finish, in a 79–56 loss. At a record of (0–1), Portugal's task of winning their next match would be even tougher, with a date against Spain. Even with a valiant effort put up by the national team, Spain were just too much to overcome in the 73–87 defeat. For Portugal's final three group stage matches, the team was unable to put together an efficient stretch of basketball for a full game; which resulted in three more losses to prevent the team from advancing.\nEuroBasket 2017 qualification.\nIn the attempt for Portugal to reach the European Championship once again, after failed opportunities to qualify in 2013 and 2015; the national team was placed into Group D during the qualifying process. However, Portugal struggled in their first five matches in the qualifiers (0–5), to come away with their only win against Belarus 77–62 before being eliminated.\n2019 World Cup qualification.\nDuring qualification for Portugal to advance toward making their first appearance in the FIBA World Cup, the team first had to make it through European Pre-Qualifiers in order to realize their chance. Unfortunately, the national team was unable to improve on their performance they would display during qualifying for the prior EuroBasket, and would fail to progress further with a record of (1–3).\n2020s–present.\nAfter Portugal's failure to qualify for the EuroBasket on multiple occasions after their last appearance in 2011, the team began the procedure to try to qualify for EuroBasket 2022. Portugal began their journey with the Pre-Qualifiers, being drawn into Group C for the first round. In their opening game, the team would lose in a narrow contest to Cyprus, before defeating Luxembourg. With two games left to go in the first round, Portugal put away Cyprus in the rematch before cruising past Luxembourg once again to advance into the second phase of pre-qualifiers at (3–1). In the second round, however, Portugal's fortunes would completely be reversed as the team went (1–3) in this phase to need the third and final round to determine their fate. There, Portugal would only manage to achieve slightly better results at (2–2), but still finished at the bottom of their group again to be eliminated.\nTeam.\nCurrent roster.\nRoster for the EuroBasket 2025 Qualifiers matches on 22 and 25 February 2024 against Israel and Ukraine.\nPast rosters.\n1951 EuroBasket: finished 15th among 18 teams\n3 Mário Almeida, 4 Bernardo Leite, 5 Rui Duarte, 6 Avelino Carmo, 7 Máximo Couto, 8 Lenine Santos, 9 José Oliveira,&lt;br&gt;10 Antonio Cardoso, 11 César Cardoso, 12 Domingos Diogo, 14 José Almeida, 15 João Coutinho (Coach: Fernando Amaral)\n2007 EuroBasket: finished 9th among 16 teams\n4 Miguel Minhava, 5 Mário Gil Fernandes, 6 Sérgio Ramos, 7 Paulo Cunha, 8 Francisco Jordão, 9 Filipe da Silva, 10 João Gomes,&lt;br&gt;11 Jorge Coelho, 12 Paulo Simão, 13 Elvis Évora, 14 Miguel Miranda 15 João Santos (Coach: Valentin Melnychuk)\n2011 EuroBasket: finished 21st among 24 teams\n4 António Tavares, 5 José Costa, 6 Miguel Minhava, 7 Fernando Sousa, 8 Cláudio Fonseca, 9 Filipe da Silva, 10 Carlos Andrade,&lt;br&gt;11 José Silva, 12 Elvis Évora, 13 Marco Goncalves, 14 Miguel Miranda, 15 João Santos (Coach: Mário Palma)"

The Scotland national team used to compete in the FIBA Europe's Division C. Scotland's direct affiliation to FIBA ended on 30 September 2016. To date, Scotland's main accomplishments were two qualifications to the EuroBasket, Europe's main basketball event. Further, the team won five bronze medals at the FIBA European Championship for Small Countries.\nHistory.\nEuroBasket 1951.\nThe Scottish team's first European championship competition was at EuroBasket 1951 in Paris. They lost their eight games and finished 16th place out of 18. They outranked Luxembourg, who had had the misfortune of being in a five-team preliminary group instead of a four-team group (and losing all of their games), and Romania, who had dropped out of the tournament at the last minute.\nEuroBasket 1957.\nSix years later, at the EuroBasket 1957 in Sofia, Scotland competed much better. There, the squad won one of its three preliminary round games to be relegated to the classification round. The first match in that round pitted Scotland against Albania, who had also not yet achieved a victory in EuroBasket competition. The Scots proved the better, 69–56. Afterwards, they lost their next six matches but showed considerable improvement from the last tournament. They competed against Austria and West Germany the whole game until they finally ceded by one point and five points respectively to finish the classification round 1–6 in 15th place overall, ahead of Albania which they beat twice.\nLast roster.\nThe following is the Scotland roster in the men's basketball tournament of the 2018 Commonwealth Games.\n \nPast rosters.\nAt the FIBA EuroBasket 2010 Division C:"

        "text": "André Joseph Lacroix (born June 5, 1945) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player in the National Hockey League and the World Hockey Association, and is the WHA's all-time leading career scorer.\nPlaying career.\nA centre notable for his playmaking, penalty-killing, and faceoff skill, Lacroix played junior hockey for the Peterborough Petes, leading the league in assists in both the 1964–65 and 1965–66 seasons and in points the latter season. He then played two seasons for the minor-league Quebec Aces of the AHL, playing brilliantly in the 1968 season before being recalled by the Philadelphia Flyers of the NHL in the spring of 1968. Paired on a forward line with fellow ex-Quebec wingers Jean-Guy Gendron and Simon Nolet, he was an immediate star, leading the Flyers in scoring in both 1969 and 1970.\nAfter the 1971 season, Lacroix was traded to the Chicago Black Hawks and was dismayed at the change of scenery, playing poorly the next year. However, in the fall of 1972, the upstart World Hockey Association began play, and he wasted no time returning to Philadelphia and signing with the league's Philadelphia Blazers franchise. Despite the team going through much tumult and controversy, Lacroix was an immediate star for the squad, leading the WHA in points that season with a 50–74–124 mark.\nHowever, in the offseason, the franchise was transferred to Vancouver, and Lacroix refused to move with the team. Thus, he was traded to an even shakier team, the New York Golden Blades for the 1974 season. Again, despite payrolls being missed, ownership folding, and the league moving the team to New Jersey on November 21, as the Jersey Knights, he was a standout, leading the WHA in assists with 80. That fall, Lacroix was named to Team Canada for the 1974 Summit Series against the Soviet Union, scoring one goal and six assists for seven points in eight games to be the team's fourth-leading scorer. His lone goal was the game-winner in Canada's only win of the series, Game 2 at Maple Leaf Gardens.\nThe New York-New Jersey team moved yet again for the 1975 to California to become the San Diego Mariners, and Lacroix continued his success. In that first season in San Diego, he achieved his second league scoring title and racked up 106 assists, the professional record at the time and the only player other than Bobby Orr (who scored 102 assists in 1970 - 71) who had ever reached 100 assists in a single season of professional hockey. This professional record would stand until Wayne Gretzky scored 109 assists in 1980 - 81. As of 2013, only Orr, Lacroix, Wayne Gretzky, and Mario Lemieux have accumulated 100 assists in a season. Lacroix scored over 100 points the next two seasons with the Mariners as well, before the franchise folded.\nIt was during this time that Lacroix began to be referred to in broadcasts of the games, as \"The Magician\". This was in reference to his ability to make the puck disappear --- and then reappear, like a magician pulling a rabbit out of his hat. The opposing goalie would lose track of the puck, only to have it reappear in his net.\nHe continued to star in two more seasons before the end of the WHA, for the Houston Aeros in 1978 and the New England Whalers in 1979. His skills diminishing at last, Lacroix played briefly and respectably for the Whalers after their move to the NHL in the 1980 season (with Gordie Howe and Bobby Hull) before retiring.\nRetirement.\nLacroix has been involved with hockey since retiring, creating the André Lacroix Power Hockey Academy, and he was the Director of hockey programs at the Oakland Ice Centre until 2005. He provided color commentary for the official Hartford Whalers radio broadcasts for several seasons.\nLacroix currently owns and operates The Pond ice rink in Bainbridge/Auburn Township, Ohio. The Pond is notable for deriving part of its electrical power from wind turbines located at the rink.\nOn May 28, 2014, Lacroix was named the head coach of the University School varsity hockey team.\nAwards.\nRed Tilson Trophy\nEddie Powers Memorial Trophy (MVP):\nW.D. (Bill) Hunter Trophy:\nIn 2010, he was elected as an inaugural inductee into the World Hockey Association Hall of Fame."

It represents over 1,900 golf clubs with over 740,000 members and is affiliated to The R&amp;A, the joint global governing body of golf. It was formed in 2012 as a merger between the English Golf Union, the governing body for men, and the English Women's Golf Association, the equivalent body for women. England Golf is a member of Council of National Golf Unions (CONGU).\nHistory.\nThe English Golf Union was founded in 1924 and is based at the National Golf Centre in Woodhall Spa, Lincolnshire. It was run as a non-profit-making organisation and is funded mainly by affiliation fees paid by golfers as part of their club membership fee. The English Women's Golf Association was founded in 1952 as an offshoot of the Ladies Golf Union (LGU), and handled local events, the handicapping system and liaised with golf clubs. The EWGA was also responsible for promoting golf to girls and women in England.\nThe two organisations decided to merge in 2011, in order to better promote the game in England, increase the commercial appeal of the amateur game, and increase equality in the sport. County unions of both organisations overwhelmingly voted in favour of the merger, which took effect from the beginning of 2012. The move also allowed Sport England to provide £13 million of annual funding from 2013, which can be used to increase participation. England Golf continues to be run as a non-profit organisation, funded from affiliation fees and government grants.\nResponsibilities.\nEngland Golf is responsible for the general promotion and administration of amateur golf within England. It organises individual and team championships for all age groups, and has inherited the running of the premier events from the male and female unions, including the English Amateur Championship (a match play event), and the English Open Amateur Stroke Play Championship (Brabazon Trophy). The larger all-Britain and Ireland events for men and women remain run by The R&amp;A and the Ladies Golf Union respectively. It also administers the handicapping system for golf in England and works to increase the interest and participation in golf among adults and juniors."

        "text": "The Buenos Aires Rugby Union (), usually referred as URBA, is the Argentine governing body that organises and controls the rugby union in the Buenos Aires Province (including the main district, Buenos Aires autonomous city and one team from Rosario, Santa Fé). The remaining clubs from the province are distributed amongst four other unions: Unión de Rugby del Oeste de Buenos Aires in the west, Unión de Rugby del Centro de la Provincia de Buenos Aires in the centre, Unión de Rugby de Mar del Plata in the east, and Unión de Rugby del Sur in the south.\nURBA is the largest union of Argentina, with 76 clubs directly affiliated and 15 competing as guests. Those teams compete in 7 competitions organised by the body, including the Top 13, the oldest competition in Argentina with the first championship being held in 1899.\nThe Union also controls its representative team, which is the most winning side of defunct Campeonato Argentino with 37 titles.\nHistory.\nThe \"River Plate Rugby Union\" (RPRU) was established in 1899 in Buenos Aires by four clubs, Buenos Aires F.C., Belgrano A.C., Lomas A.C. and Rosario A.C. The body organized the first edition of the Buenos Aires' inter-club competition that same year, with Lomas being the first Argentine champion. In 1951, the change of name to Spanish \"Unión Argentina de Rugby\", was after a request by the Argentine Olympic committee and it continued at the same time to work as local federation of Buenos Aires clubs, and national federation, recognized by International Rugby Board.\nAs a result of a restructuring of the Argentine rugby in 1995, the \"Unión de Rugby de Buenos Aires\" was created with the purpose of organising competitions in the city district and nearest towns like San Isidro and La Plata, while the remaining part of the Buenos Aires Province (including populous cities like Mar del Plata or Tandil) remained under other provincial unions. Therefore, the RPRU championship was renamed \"Torneo de la URBA\" and continued with the same format, while the Argentine Union (UAR) took over national teams only.\nCompetitions.\nAs of 2023, several competitions are organized by the URBA. The first division is the Top 12, contested by 12 clubs of the Buenos Aires area and also the oldest rugby competition in Argentina, with its first edition held in 1899.\nThe URBA league system completes with Primera A (unlike its name indicates, it is the second division), Primera B (third), Primera C (fourth), Segunda (fifth), Tercera (sixth) and Desarrollo (seven, the lowest level).\nPrimera A to Segunda have 14 teams competing in each division, while there are 12 teams in Tercera and 11 in Desarrollo.\nOther competitions organized by the URBA are \"Universitario\" (with 22 University teams playing in two divisions), \"Femenino\" (16 female teams in two divisions), and \"Empresarial\" (27 teams in two divisions). The URBA has also competitions for U19, U17, U16 and U15 teams.\nUnion team.\nThe Buenos Aires team –nicknamed \"Las Águilas (The Eagles)\"– is the most successful within the provincial teams in Argentina, having won a record 37 Campeonato Argentino titles.\nInternational friendly competition.\nThe URBA team has also played several international friendly matches against national teams that were touring Argentina, with several wins against some of them. Below is the list of matches won:"

        "title": "Table tennis grips and playing styles",
        "text": "Table tennis is unique among racket sports in that it supports a wide variety of playing styles and methods of gripping the racket, at even the highest levels of play. This article describes some of the most common table tennis grips and playing styles seen in competitive play. The playing styles listed in this article are broad categories with fuzzy boundaries, and most players will possess some combination of these styles while leaning towards a \"favorite\". Many advanced players will also add some \"special\" shots of their own.\n, shakehand grips and attack-oriented playing styles are the most popular styles in high-level play. While many argue that this is because shakehand grips and attacking styles have a competitive advantage, it is also true that the shakehand grip is easier to learn as a beginner, and attack-oriented playing styles have broader aesthetic appeal than defensive playing styles. Regardless, players with a variety of playing styles and grip techniques still manage to play and win tournaments at the highest level.\nIn the 1970s, most European teams focused on training all of their players with the same equipment and playing style: shakehand grip with inverted rubber on the racket, playing a loop-focused attacking style, using the forehand to cover 2/3 of the table and backhand to cover 1/3 of the table. In contrast, the Chinese team maintained a wide variety of playing styles, equipment, and grip variations among their players. The diversity maintained by the Chinese team is no doubt a factor in their dominance of the sport over the past several decades, and European teams have recently figured this out and followed suit.\nRacket grips.\nCompetitive table tennis players grip their rackets in a variety of ways. Almost all competitive players grip their rackets with either the shakehand grip or a penhold grip. Numerous variations on gripping styles exist. The rules of the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) do not prescribe the manner in which one must grip the racket.\nShakehand (aka \"Handshake\") grip.\nShakehand is possibly the oldest surviving grip since the table tennis racket took its current shape. It is named because one holds the racket as if they are shaking hands with it: thumb on one side of the racket, index finger on the other side, and the remaining three fingers wrapped around the handle. This grip allows nearly even power distribution over forehand and backhand shots, but suffers from an awkward crossover point in the middle of the body, where the player must switch from forehand to backhand. This crossover point between the forehand and backhand is an area of weakness for shakehand players, but penhold players do not have such a crossover point because they can cover the middle of their body by simply swinging their forehand down like a pendulum. The main advantages of a shakehand grip are the ability to make fast topspin attacks on both the forehand and backhand sides, and the ability to create extremely spinny balls, particularly those with pure topspin and pure backspin. \nVirtually all European players and roughly two thirds of Asian players use the shakehand grip.\nPenhold grips.\nThe penhold grips are named because of the similarity to the way that pens are held: with the thumb and index finger wrapped around the front side of the handle, and the remaining three fingers on the back of the blade. Penhold styles have one notable advantage over shakehand in that they do not have an awkward crossover point in the middle of the body. Penhold styles also allow around 270° of wrist mobility around the axis of the plane of the blade, making it much easier for penhold players to create both directions of sidespin as well as hybrid sidespin-topspin or sidespin-backspin shots. It is also easier for penhold players to disguise what kind of spin they are putting on the ball, as well as in which direction they are going to hit the ball. It is typically hard for penhold players to create pure topspin or pure backspin, as both their forehand and backhand strokes tend to hit the ball at a side-angle, so most of their shots will have some sidespin. \nPenhold grip styles have become less popular in recent years, since it is hard and awkward to perform backhand topspins and backhand attacks, and the game has become much more attack-oriented as of late. The backhand weakness makes it much harder for penhold beginners to perform well against their shakehand counterparts, and so few stick with it to develop better technique. However, this has not stopped top penhold players from winning the World Championships, the World Cup and the Olympic Games regularly, as the backhand weakness can be covered adequately by putting in the effort to learn good backhand technique (as Ryu Seung-Min has), with excellent footwork allowing forehand coverage of most of the table (exemplified best by Ryu Seung-Min and Xu Xin), or by supplementing with the more modern Reverse Penhold Backhand innovation (exemplified best by Wang Hao).\nUnusual grips.\nAlthough the vast majority of table tennis players grip the racket in one of the three styles above, there are some outlier grips which are very rare.\nPenhold playing styles.\nForehand looper.\nPenhold loopers utilize the forehand topspin loop as their primary shot. A loop is a topspin stroke in table tennis, usually performed with the forehand, where the player starts the stroke below the ball and brushes the ball upwards. A looper usually exhibits excellent footwork, trying to use the forehand to cover most or all of the table. Because of this, penhold loopers have a shorter reach than shakehand loopers and generally try to stay close to the table even during powerful loop exchanges. \n\"Notable penhold loopers\" include 1981-83 World Champion Guo Yuehua, 1988 Olympic Gold Medalist Yoo Nam-kyu, 1992 Olympics Men's Doubles Gold Medalist Lü Lin, 1992 Olympics Bronze medalist Kim Taek-soo, 2001-03 World Men's Doubles Champion Yan Sen, 2004 Olympic Gold Medalist Ryu Seung-min, 2008 Olympic Gold Medalist Ma Lin, and 2015 Men's and Mixed Doubles Champion Xu Xin.\nTwo-sided looper.\nTwo-sided penhold loopers almost exclusively play with the modern Chinese penhold style, where they use the Reverse Penhold Backhand to make powerful hybrid sidespin-topspin loops. RPB shots are often difficult to return because of the sidespin, and difficult to predict the direction of until the ball is already hit. \nTraditional penhold players \"can\" be two-sided loopers, but the backhand loop is a very difficult shot, requiring lots of training and extreme shoulder flexibility. Ryu Seung-Min has a good backhand loop for a traditional penholder, but still very much favors his powerful forehand.\nThe most notable two-sided looper is Wang Hao, who uses the Reverse Penhold Backhand for almost all of his backhand shots. Other prominent two-sided penhold loopers are Félix Lebrun and Xue Fei.\nCounter driver.\nThe penholder's advantage of a small crossover is fully utilized in this style. Staying close to the table, counter drivers block and drive the opponent's topspins back across the table at speed, trying to force them out of position, abruptly change the pace of the game, or look for the opportunistic forehand kill. Counter drivers usually have a safe forehand loop as well, in case the opponent is a chopper and doesn't give topspins or easy kills readily. This style works well for short pips hitters.\n\"Notable penhold counter drivers\" \"include 2000 Asian Champion Chiang Peng-lung and South Korean player Moon Hyun-jung.\" Ma Lin, an incredibly well-rounded player, is also known to utilize this strategy when the opponent is lobbing the ball far from the table. \nShort pips hitter.\nThis penhold style utilizes a short pips out rubber, usually on only one side of the racket with no backside rubber. Short pips hitters play over the table, hitting the ball very flatly as soon as it bounces off the table with the pips being largely unaffected by (or even negating) the majority of the opponent's spin. The advantage of hitting the ball flatly is that all of the player's power is transferred into the linear velocity of the ball, without expending any energy on creating spin. This means that the shots are very fast, and typically hard to block for the inexperienced player. However, the lack of a topspin Magnus effect means that the shots are harder to place on the table since they don't follow a downward arc trajectory, and the lack of angular momentum on the ball means that shots are less consistent and more sensitive to small amounts of wind or air pressure, often giving a knuckle ball effect. \n\"Notable penhold short pips hitters\" \"include 1996 Olympic Champion Liu Guoliang, 1985 and 1987 World Champion Jiang Jialiang, three-time Olympian Toshio Tasaki, Yang Ying, Kwak Bang-bang, Seok Eun-mi, He Zhi Wen, Lee Eun-hee, Wang Zeng Yi and Rory Cargill.\"\nShakehand playing styles.\nForehand looper.\nShakehand loopers apply pressure and win points primarily with fast and spinny loops from the forehand. After the opening exchanges, when the first attack has been made, loopers will attack with a variety of topspin shots varying in speed and spin, maneuvering their opponents around the table and looking for outright winners. The power and reach of a shakehand looper means that they can counterloop even when forced back from the table, which can be quite a spectacle when a lobbing looper forced back by smashes suddenly attacks in an attempt to regain initiative.\n\"Notable shakehand loopers\" \"include Jean-Michel Saive, Werner Schlager, Wang Liqin, Ma Long, Zhang Jike, Ding Ning.\" Forehand looper is the most prominent style of play in men's table tennis, as it is a playing style that favors very powerful shots.\nTwo-sided attacker.\nLike a forehand looper, the two-sided attacker uses the loop as a primary weapon, though often from the backhand side. The advantage of the backhand attack is that it is often more controlled and precise than a forehand loop, and having a powerful backhand increases the chances of having the first attack as well as the variety of angles that could be attacked. Two-sided attackers often also employ a very fast and powerful backhand flick. They may even favor their backhand side over their forehand, but maintain a good forehand loop as well. \n\"Notable male two-sided attackers include Dimitrij Ovtcharov, Fan Zhendong, Liang Jingkun, and Darko Jorgić.\" Two-sided attacker is the most prominent style of play in women's table tennis, since the women's game focuses more on precision and less on power, as compared to the men's game.\nCounter-driver.\nThe shakehand counter driver blocks and drives various attacks back at the opponent, forcing errors through changing angles and rhythm. A series of quick drives and blocks between counter drivers can look quite impressive, with balls seeming to fly everywhere. This style is popular among female players, since the relatively weaker attacks are easier to block compared to the men's game. \n\"Notable counter-drivers include multiple-time Olympic champion Zhang Yining, as well as Fukuhara Ai, Tie Yana and He Zhuojia.\"\nAll-rounder.\nAn all-round player is the closest thing modern table tennis has to a pure defensive player. Typically these players will have excellent reflexes for returning the ball, often from close to the table, and will use their defensive skills to place the ball in inconvenient locations for the opponent, or simply continue to return the ball until they find a good opportunity to attack. This playing style combines tactics from the counter-driver and the forehand looper.\n\"Notable all-round players include Vladimir Samsonov, Oh Sang-eun, and Jan-Ove Waldner.\"\nChopper.\nThe single most distinctive style in table tennis is the chopper. The chopper is defensive in the sense that, while other styles look to attack and gain initiative, the chopper gives up the initiative, using the chop to return an attack with backspin and/or sidespin. The chopper returns repeated attacks with slow, floating backspin chops executed as late as possible, taking as much time as necessary to tire out and frustrate the opponent. These chopped balls are often hard to return correctly because they have heavy backspin on them, and the slow floating returns make it necessary for the opponent to start the attack all over again. Chops can vary in the amount of backspin (from no spin to floating), sidespin (curving into the table or away from the attacker), and position, making it hard to continuously attack. Because chopped balls are hard to return well, they are often returned poorly and give the chopper a good opportunity to attack. Inverted rubber is usually employed on the forehand side of the racket, and the backhand is usually reserved for long pips rubber or antispin rubber, which is insensitive to spin (and sometimes even negates spin). The inverted rubber is used for attacking, and the long pips / antispin rubber is used for chopping. Some choppers twiddle their rackets in order to switch which side of the racket has pips, adding another layer of confusion for their opponent.\n\"Notable twiddle-choppers include Koji Matsushita, Svetlana Ganina, Irina Kotikhina and Viktoria Pavlovich\". \"Notable non-twiddle choppers include Chen Weixing, Joo Sae-Hyuk, Ding Song, Kim Kyung-ah, Park Mi-young and Tan Paey Fern.\" \"Very few players choose to defend with inverted rubber on both sides, a notable example of which is Wang Tingting.\"\nPoints between a chopper and an attacker are usually the easiest for non-players to appreciate, because of the slowness of the ball and the spectacular chop stroke."

The Links was founded in originally laid out by Old Tom Morris in 1891, with Castletown Golf Club founded in 1892. Dr Alister MacKenzie made significant improvements and alterations to the course in 1913. After the war the course was updated by Mackenzie Ross.\nCastletown has been independently rated within Rolex's Top 1,000 Golf Courses in the World and in 2015 was voted as the 75th Best Links in Great Britain &amp; Ireland by National Club Golfer. It offers a 17th hole which drives \"over the Irish Sea\". The links has hosted, among other events, the PGA Cup (1979), Europro Tour 2002, Manx Classic Pro Am and the Duke of York Young Champions Trophy in 2003 and again in 2005.\nCastletown Golf Links came under new ownership in November 2011; since then the development of a new clubhouse along with renewed equipment has resulted in significantly better course conditions and a steady increase in membership. The current professional is [Charlie Simpson] providing lessons and a great range of clothing and equipment. The restaurant at the clubhouse is called [Bay Green], is open to the public and has proven very popular with an array of fresh dishes utilising the great ingredients available on Island.\nThe 7th hole is named the Race Course because, a century and a half before the first ever English Derby, the Isle of Man and the then Earl of Derby also the Lord of Mann held the first ever Manx Derby there over three furlongs. The 18th hole at Castletown Golf Links overlooks the historic St. Michaels Isle, a small island joined to Langness Peninsula via a short causeway built in the mid-18th century. The island's notable features are St Michael's Chapel, dating back to the 12th century, on the south side of the island, and a circular fort built in 1540.\nThe [Castletown Golf Links Hotel] was sold to Dandara in 2011, who have subsequently allowed the building to fall into a state of ruin. Their planning application (17/01265/B)to build apartments has received substantial opposition from local residents. In spite of numerous efforts by the owner of the golf course to buy the property and redevelop a hotel-only development, these efforts have not been successful to date."

First played in 2001, the event was supported by The R&amp;A and their affiliated national governing bodies and counts towards the World Amateur Golf Rankings and the American Junior Golf Association's performance based entry system. It had a 54-hole stroke play format.\nHistory.\nThe event was created by The Duke of York and John Simpson. This highly rated invitational event, supported by The R&amp;A, and aims to promote the development of junior golf, encourage competitiveness and friendship between individual champions whilst also offering a unique opportunity for boys and girls to compete for the same Trophy on a top quality UK links course. The standard of competition continues to be incredibly high with the average handicap for last year's event being an impressive +1.5.\nThe tournament has grown from having just 11 competitors from six countries in 2001, to a field of 55 champions from 32 countries in 2013. \nThe Duke of York Young Champions Trophy is organised in many ways like a professional tournament in order to give the potential stars of the future a chance to experience what life as a golf professional might involve; hence the inclusion of sponsors and official functions, including the Official Dinner hosted by the Duke of York, as well as an educational talk. Past players include Rory McIlroy, Anna Nordqvist, Matteo Manassero and Tom Lewis.\nThe tournament was wound up in 2020 when the Prince Andrew Charitable Trust ceased operations following the Jeffrey Epstein scandal.\nAcademic and golf scholarships.\nThe Duke of York Sports Foundation is a registered charity established in 2004 to promote amateur sports. Academic and golf scholarships have been awarded since September 2007 to provide under 18 boys and girls with the opportunity to receive a high standard of education whilst at the same time focusing on their golf and offer an alternative to studying and training in the USA.\nWellington College in Berkshire was chosen as the school that met all the criteria required to support both aspects of the scholarship. As one of the best co-educational independent private schools in Britain, it offers the International Baccalaureate, a good standard 9-hole golf course and practice facilities on site. It is also located near many excellent courses (including Wentworth and Sunningdale), coaches and major airports.\nCandidates must meet Wellington College's academic standard, demonstrate a high level of golfing ability with clear signs of potential and are selected on a case-by-case basis. To date, the Foundation has awarded five academic and golf scholarships. All the scholars are aged between 14 and 17, with handicaps ranging from three to plus-two. The Foundation's aim is to award eight to ten scholarships to individuals by 2011.\nCourses.\nThe Duke of York Young Champions Trophy used to be held at links courses across the UK. Dundonald Links and Royal Liverpool played host to the tournament four times.\nParticipating countries.\nAs of 2014, 50 countries have participated in the Duke of York Young Champions Trophy."

        "title": "Gunner (American football)",
        "text": "In American football, a gunner, also known as a shooter, flyer, headhunter, or kamikaze, is a player on kickoffs and punts who specializes in running down the sideline very quickly in an attempt to tackle the kick or punt returner. Gunners must have several techniques in order to break away or \"shed\" blockers, and have good agility in order to change their running direction quickly. Gunners on the punt team also must be able to block or catch.\nGunners typically also play positions as defensive backs, wide receivers, or running back when not on special teams, often as backups.\nThe counterpart on the return team is called the jammer, who is assigned to block the gunner of the punting team.\nThe NFL Pro Bowl features a \"Special Teamer\" position, along with a kicker, punter, and kick returner. This is often a gunner considered to be among the best. Steve Tasker, a 7-time Pro Bowler, is considered to be one of the top gunners in NFL history. Pro Bowler Bill Bates of the 1980s–1990s Dallas Cowboys was a well known gunner, known for daredevil plays. Ten-time Pro Bowler Matthew Slater of the New England Patriots is considered a top gunner who contributed greatly to the Patriots winning the Super Bowl in 2014, 2016 and 2018.\nRole.\nOn punts there will be two offensive players on the punting team lined up close to the sideline. These are called gunners. According to the NFL Rules Digest:\nDuring a kick from scrimmage, only the end men, as eligible receivers on the line of scrimmage at the time of the snap, are permitted to go beyond the line before the ball is kicked.\nThese two eligible receivers on the kicking team―the gunners―are allowed to start running down the field as soon as the ball is snapped. The gunner's job is to try to get down the field as fast as the kicked ball and tackle whoever catches it. In the best case, they get there just before the ball and make the other team afraid to try to return it, leading to a fair catch. When a team lines up to punt, the other team lines up in a defense that is designed to also receive a punt. There typically will be one player lined up about 40 yards back; he is the punt returner, the player designated to catch the punt. There will also be a few players lined up on the gunners; these players are called jammers. If the defense lines up two defenders on each gunner, then they are hoping to slow the gunners down, catch the punt, and try to run the punt back for a long gain or even a touchdown. If there is only one defender lined up on each gunner, then the receiving team has extra players rushing the punter, and they hope to block the punt. If no defenders are lined up on the gunners, the punting team may throw the ball to one of the gunners to pick up the first down.\nGunners typically play a similar role in kickoff coverage, in that like other members of the coverage group, they try to evade the blockers and tackle the kick returner."

This was the first UEFA Champions League edition to feature a new format with a 16-team knockout round instead of a second group stage.\nThe competition was won by Portugal's Porto, who defeated Monaco of France 3–0 at the Arena AufSchalke in Gelsenkirchen, Germany. This was Portugal's first win since 1987, and Porto's second European trophy in two years, following their UEFA Cup success from the previous season. This was the second consecutive victory in a European cup for Porto coach José Mourinho, who beat Monaco coached by Didier Deschamps, a two-time winner of the competition as a player.\nAC Milan were the defending champions, but were eliminated by Deportivo de La Coruña in the quarter-finals.\nQualification.\nA total of 72 teams from 48 UEFA member associations participated in the 2003–04 UEFA Champions League. Liechtenstein (who does not have their own domestic league) as well as Andorra and San Marino did not participate. Also not admitted was Azerbaijan, which was suspended by UEFA.

        "title": "1990 NBA Finals",
        "text": "The 1990 NBA Finals was the championship round of the 1989–90 National Basketball Association (NBA) season, and the conclusion of the season's playoffs. The series pitted the defending NBA and Eastern Conference champion Detroit Pistons against the Western Conference champion Portland Trail Blazers.\nThis was the first NBA Finals since 1979 that did not feature either the Los Angeles Lakers or the Boston Celtics, and one of two NBA championships of the 1990s (the other was won by the San Antonio Spurs in 1999) won by a team other than the Chicago Bulls (6 wins) or the Houston Rockets (2 wins).\nThe Pistons became just the third franchise in NBA history to win back-to-back championships, after the Lakers (first accomplished in 1949, 1950) and Celtics (first accomplished in 1959, 1960).\nBackground.\nPortland Trail Blazers.\nThe Trail Blazers last made the NBA Finals when they won the NBA championship in 1977. In between finals appearances, the Blazers made the playoffs every year except 1982, but most of the time were eliminated in the first or second round. Along the way, Portland built a core that would turn the team into title contenders, adding Clyde Drexler, Terry Porter and Jerome Kersey through the draft while signing or trading for players such as Buck Williams and Kevin Duckworth. The addition of Williams cost Portland once-promising center Sam Bowie, whose career had been curtailed by a series of leg injuries after being drafted second overall in the 1984 NBA draft. Early in the 1988–89 season, the Blazers fired head coach Mike Schuler and replaced him with assistant Rick Adelman, who would go on to win over 1,000 regular season games in 23 NBA seasons.\nEntering the 1989–90 season with modest expectations, the Trail Blazers surprised the NBA by posting a 59–23 record, good enough for the third seed in the Western Conference. In the playoffs, they swept the Dallas Mavericks in the first round, defeated the San Antonio Spurs in seven games during the second round, and eliminated the Phoenix Suns in six games in the conference finals.\nDetroit Pistons.\nThe Pistons won their first NBA championship a year earlier. However, they entered the 1989–90 season without rugged forward Rick Mahorn, who had been selected by the Minnesota Timberwolves in the 1989 NBA Expansion Draft and was later traded to the Philadelphia 76ers.\nDespite the loss of Mahorn, the Pistons still managed to post a 59–23 record to lead the Eastern Conference. With Mahorn gone, Defensive Player of the Year winner Dennis Rodman picked up the slack, keeping the Pistons in true \"Bad Boys\" form all season. On their way to the Finals, Detroit swept the Indiana Pacers in the first round, defeated the New York Knicks in five games during the second round, and overcame their archrival Chicago Bulls in seven games in the conference finals.\nRegular season series.\nBoth teams split the two meetings, each won by the home team:\nSeries summary.\nThe Pistons became the first team in Finals history to win Games 3 through 5 in the 2–3–2 series format which was used between 1985 and 2013.\nThis would be the last series to be played on a Tuesday–Thursday–Sunday rotation until the 2004 series. (Which was, coincidentally, also won by Detroit in 5 games.) From 1991 to 2003, the series were primarily on Wednesday–Friday–Sunday. Game three is the most recent NBA Finals game to tip off earlier than 8:30 p.m. Eastern/5:30 p.m. Pacific time.\nGame 1.\nThe Blazers led 90–80 with seven minutes left and looked poised to steal one on the road. But, after a timeout, Isiah Thomas got the Pistons going with a layup and a jumper. Then Joe Dumars completed a three-point play and Aguirre scored on an offensive rebound. In less than three minutes, Detroit had tightened the game to 92–89.\nBuck Williams hit a jumper to make the score 94–89, but then Thomas scored seven straight points on two free throws, a three-point shot, and an 18-footer to give the Pistons their first lead. With 1:49 left, Thomas put a final dagger into the Blazers by sticking an open three-pointer for a 99–94 lead. The Pistons went on to win, 105–99.\nThis was the first Finals assignment for referee Dick Bavetta, who had been an NBA official since the 1975-76 season. He would go on to set the league record for most games officiated and was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 2015.\nA little under a month after the release of her debut single \"Vision of Love\", future best selling recording artist Mariah Carey performed a heavily acclaimed rendition of \"America the Beautiful\".\nGame 2.\nThe Blazers, playing surprisingly well on the road, had control of the game past the third quarter. Behind Bill Laimbeer, however, the Pistons made a comeback in the fourth period. Laimbeer, who had scored only seven points over the first three periods, went wild in the fourth and overtime, making 19 points over the last 17 minutes. For the game, he successfully converted six three-pointers, tying a Finals record set by the Lakers' Michael Cooper in 1987.\nThe Pistons had a 94–91 lead with 49 seconds left after a John Salley tip-in. Five seconds later, Clyde Drexler, who would finish with 33 points, made a free throw. With 23 seconds left, Isiah Thomas missed a potential game-clinching layup. Terry Porter tied the game at 94 with a pair of free throws with 10 seconds left, and the game went to overtime when Thomas missed an 18-footer at the buzzer.\nA hook shot by James Edwards and two three-pointers by Laimbeer gave the Pistons a 102–98 lead with 1:30 left in overtime. Porter hit another set of free throws to trim the lead to two; then Drexler tied it at the one-minute mark with a 17-footer.\nPortland took the lead at 104–102 when Thomas fouled out with 1:10 left. Laimbeer promptly bailed the Pistons out with 4.1 seconds remaining by hitting a 25-foot three-pointer for a 105–104 lead.\nPortland gave the ball to Drexler, who was fouled by Dennis Rodman, playing on a sore ankle, with two seconds left. Drexler made both foul shots to give the Blazers the 106–105 lead. The Pistons quickly passed the ball to Edwards, who tried a shot from the left of the paint, but rookie Clifford Robinson blocked it at the last second. With that, the Blazers won the game and took away the home-court advantage.\nGame 2 of the 1990 Finals marked the first time in six years that a Finals game went into overtime, the last being Game 4 of the 1984 NBA Finals.\nThe Pistons lose their first playoff game in the Palace at Auburn Hills, snapping their 14-game winning streak.\nGame 3.\nJoe Dumars' father, Joe Dumars II, died of congestive heart failure hours before the tipoff of Game 3. He had had severe diabetes, which resulted in the amputation of both of his legs in 1985. As his father's condition worsened, Dumars realized that the news of his father's death might come before or during an important game. So he asked Debbie, his new wife, not to inform him of any news until after the game had ended. His father had instilled such professionalism in Dumars, and his wife kept his wish.\nTwo things were stacked against the Pistons. One, they had not won in Portland since October 19, 1974, the second game of Bill Walton's career. Two, they would be without Dennis Rodman, whose ankle had stiffened. But, Vinnie Johnson found his range for the first time, making 9 of 13 shots for 21 points. The consummate professional Dumars was the most potent, however, leading Detroit with 33 points on an array of shots. One such shot was a three-pointer that stifled a Blazer run after they had cut the Piston lead to 68–60 in the third.\nDetroit won, 121–106. Dumars' wife then used a courtside phone to inform Joe of his father's death. Dumars decided he would play the next game but declined press interviews.\nGame 4.\nThe Pistons were plagued with shooting problems as the Blazers raced off to a 32–22 lead at the end of the first period. But Vinnie Johnson and Joe Dumars took over, leading a 9–0 run that pulled the Pistons to 32–31 with 7:49 left in the half. The Pistons led 51–46 at intermission as the suffocating Detroit defense held the Blazers to 14 second-quarter points.\nIsiah Thomas scored 22 points in the third and capped his onslaught with a three-pointer at the 2:15 mark that gave the Pistons an 81–65 lead and seemed to quiet the Portland crowd.\nBut, over the next eight minutes, the Blazers suddenly remembered the pressure defense and running game that had gotten them to the NBA Finals. They went on a 28–11 run of their own, and Terry Porter drove for a layup to give them a 93–92 lead with 5:20 left.\nThe game became a nip-and-tuck affair until Detroit led 106–102 on a jumper by Dumars at 1:16, but the Blazers fought back and had a chance to tie it with 35 seconds left. Buck Williams missed one of two free throws and Portland trailed 106–105.\nFour seconds later, in a scramble under the Pistons' basket, Bill Laimbeer drew his sixth foul, disqualifying him for the remainder of the game. Clyde Drexler made both free throws to give Portland the lead, 107–106, with 31.8 seconds left. But Thomas responded by sinking a 22-footer that returned the edge to Detroit 108–107.\nWith nine seconds left, Porter attempted to drive on Dumars, but Joe blocked his path. Thomas scooped up the ensuing loose ball and headed the other way. Danny Young quickly fouled him as he let fly a 55-footer that went in. The officials quickly ruled it no good, as the foul occurred before the shot, but Thomas made the free throws for a 110–107 lead with 8.4 seconds showing.\nMark Aguirre then fouled Porter with 6.5 seconds left, and he made both, drawing Portland to 110–109. On the ensuing play, James Edwards got the ball downcourt to a wide-open Gerald Henderson for an easy layup and a 112–109 lead. Portland now had the ball and 1.8 seconds to get a shot.\nThe Blazers whipped the ball upcourt to Young, who promptly knocked down a 35-footer from the right sideline. Immediately players from both benches came onto the floor, the Blazers believing the game was now tied and the Pistons believing otherwise. Veteran referee Earl Strom, calling his final NBA game, huddled the officials amid the din and signaled that the shot was too late. Videotaped replays later confirmed the accuracy of the call. The Blazers were down, three games to one.\nGame 5.\nFor much of Game 5 it appeared Portland would at least send the series back to Detroit. The Pistons shot poorly starting out, missing seven of their first 11 shots, but still led 26–22 after one quarter. They held the same four-point edge at the half, 46–42, but the Blazers rallied in the third period, and with 10 minutes to play in the game, they led 76–68.\nVinnie Johnson then went on the first of two scoring streaks. \"The Microwave\" scored all of Detroit's points in a 9–0 run to give his team a 77–76 edge with 6:35 to go. The Blazers stepped up their pressure and again built a 90–83 lead with 2:05 left. But, when Clyde Drexler fouled out, Portland could not score the rest of the way and \"The Microwave\" heated up again. Johnson scored seven points in Detroit's astounding 9–0 run to close the game and the series. His last shot was a 15-footer from the right sideline with Jerome Kersey draped all over him and 0:00.7 showing on the clock. Terry Porter had a last chance to force a Game 6, but his three clanked off the rim.\nIsiah Thomas was named the Finals MVP. He had scored 33, 23, 21, 32 and 29 points, respectively, in the five games. From three-point range he had made 11 of 16 shots. For the series, he had averaged 27.6 points, 8.0 assists, and 5.2 rebounds, a performance that caused him to unleash his full smile afterward.\n\"You can say what you want about me,\" he said, \"but you can't say that I'm not a winner.\"\nMedia coverage.\nTelevision.\nCBS Sports covered the Finals for the seventeenth consecutive and last time, as the new television contract taking effect the following season would see the games move to NBC. Dick Stockton led the commentary team as play-by-play for the ninth straight year, with Hubie Brown serving as analyst for the second consecutive year. Pat O'Brien anchored the network’s coverage, working on his seventh and last Finals for CBS and his first as anchor since Brent Musburger was fired in April 1990. Lesley Visser and James Brown reported from courtside with Visser following the Pistons and Brown the Trail Blazers.\nAfter CBS' run with the NBA ended, Brown moved to Turner Sports to fill the same role. Stockton would not call another NBA game until , when he also joined Turner. Stockton and Brown would occasionally be paired together on TBS and TNT until , when Brown was hired to coach the Memphis Grizzlies.\nRadio.\nFor the sixth and final time, ABC Radio provided national coverage of the Finals. Fred Manfra was the lead, with Dick Vitale and Earl Monroe as analysts.\nWWJ (AM) and KEX (AM) were the local radio broadcasters for the Pistons and the Trail Blazers with George Blaha and Bill Schonely as the lead broadcasters.\nAftermath.\nThe Pistons would not make a fourth consecutive Finals championship visit in the 1990–91 NBA season. Dealing with an injured Isiah Thomas for 34 games, they went 50–32, but a matured and stronger Chicago Bulls team swept them in four games of the Eastern Conference Finals. The Bulls won the championship that season. Within a few seasons, the Pistons dynasty broke up, with key players, including Thomas, retiring or moving on as free agents to other teams. They would not return to the Finals until 2004. Dennis Rodman, James Edwards and John Salley would win a championship in 1996 with the Bulls.\nThe Trail Blazers won the Pacific Division title by winning a franchise-record 63 games in 1991, acquiring the league's best record. They were, however, denied a second straight trip to the NBA Finals, losing to the Los Angeles Lakers in six games at the Western Conference Finals. The Blazers returned to the Finals the year after that in 1992, but lost to the Bulls in the championship series, four games to two."

        "text": "The 1989 NBA Finals was the championship round of the 1988–89 National Basketball Association (NBA) season, and the conclusion of the 1989 NBA Playoffs. The series was a rematch of the previous year's championship round between the Eastern Conference playoff champion Detroit Pistons and the defending NBA champion and Western Conference playoff champion Los Angeles Lakers. This, along with the 1983 NBA Finals, were the only two NBA championships of the 1980s not to be won by either the Lakers or the Boston Celtics; every NBA Finals of that decade featured either the Lakers or Celtics, and sometimes both (1984, 1985, 1987). Coincidentally, the Lakers were also swept in the 1983 NBA Finals, that time by the Philadelphia 76ers.\nDuring the season, the Lakers had won their division, with Magic Johnson collecting his second MVP award. The team swept the first three playoff series (Pacific Division foes: Portland, Seattle, and Phoenix), resulting in a rematch with the Detroit Pistons in the Finals.\nThe Pistons had dominated the Eastern Conference, winning 63 games during the regular season. After sweeping the Boston Celtics and Milwaukee Bucks, the Pistons beat the Chicago Bulls in six games, earning a second straight trip to the NBA Finals. In the season before, the Lakers had beaten them in a tough, seven-game series.\nThe Pistons won the series in a four-game sweep of the injury-riddled Lakers, marking the first time a team (Lakers) had swept the first three rounds of the playoffs, only to be swept in the finals. As of today, the Pistons are the most recent Eastern Conference team to sweep an NBA Finals. The Pistons teams clinched all four series on the road, which were later followed by the 1999 San Antonio Spurs and the 2016 Cleveland Cavaliers.\nFor their rough physical play, and sometimes arrogant demeanor, Pistons' center Bill Laimbeer nicknamed the team 'The Bad Boys'. The name became an unofficial 'slogan' for the Pistons throughout the next season as well.\nFollowing the series, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar announced his retirement at 42, after 20 years with the NBA.\nPistons' guard Joe Dumars was named MVP for the series.\nPrior to the 2014 NBA Finals, the Pistons were the last Finals champion to have been runner-up to the same opponent the previous season as they did in the 1988 Finals.\nBackground.\nDetroit Pistons.\nBefore the season began, the Pistons moved from the Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan to the brand-new The Palace of Auburn Hills, Michigan. The new arena was envisioned by Pistons owner William Davidson. The arena consisted of luxury boxes and club seating, which added profits compared to older arenas. The Pistons sold out all 41 games at The Palace.\nThe team itself was also an improvement, highlighted by a mid-season trade that sent Adrian Dantley to the Dallas Mavericks for Mark Aguirre. With Aguirre taking over the starting small forward spot, the Pistons went on a tear, winning 31 of its final 37 games to finish with a league-best 63–19 record.\nTheir second-half momentum carried over to the playoffs, sweeping both the Boston Celtics and the Milwaukee Bucks in the first two rounds. However, they lost two of the first three games to their archrival Chicago Bulls in the conference finals, but after devising the Jordan Rules scheme to contain Michael Jordan, the Pistons won the final three games to earn another Finals berth.\nLos Angeles Lakers.\nPrior to the season, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar announced that the 1988–89 season was to be his last. Therefore, his 'retirement tour' consisted of pregame tributes in every arena to pay homage to the retiring Lakers captain.\nSeeking to become the first team since the Boston Celtics dynasty of the 1960s to win three consecutive championships, the Lakers managed to put up a conference-best 57–25 record. The team's core remained mostly intact, save for veteran forward Kurt Rambis, who was drafted by the Charlotte Hornets in the expansion draft. Their most notable addition was former Chicago Bulls forward Orlando Woolridge.\nIn the playoffs, the Lakers turned it up a notch. They became the first team to win their first 11 playoff games, as they swept the Portland Trail Blazers, Seattle SuperSonics and Phoenix Suns in each of the first three rounds. Magic Johnson won the MVP award that year.\nRegular season series.\nThe Detroit Pistons won both games in the regular season series:\nGame summaries.\nGame 1.\nJust before Game 1, Lakers guard Byron Scott suffered a severe hamstring injury in practice; he would miss the series. His absence would especially be felt on the defensive end. Magic Johnson had a size advantage, but was too slow to defend against the Pistons' three-headed backcourt monster of Joe Dumars, Isiah Thomas, and Vinnie Johnson. Super-sub Michael Cooper would have to log more minutes than he was accustomed to, and rookie David Rivers was inexperienced. Another option was Tony Campbell, but he played very little during the season.\nWithout Scott's quick switches and help defense, the Piston guards smoked the Lakers in Game 1. Thomas had 24 points, Dumars 22, and Johnson 19. With six minutes left, Detroit led 97–79, and the final score was 109–97.\nGame 2.\nThe short-handed Lakers snapped right back in Game 2, pounding the boards and taking a strong first-quarter lead. Joe Dumars had a hot first half with 24 points (he would finish with 33) to keep Detroit close. Los Angeles held a 62–56 lead at halftime.\nWith about four minutes left in the third period, a major misfortune would befall the Lakers, leading 75–73. John Salley blocked a Mychal Thompson shot, which started a Detroit fast break. Magic Johnson dropped back to play defense, and in so doing, pulled his hamstring. Magic was visibly hurt and frustrated, and had to be coaxed into leaving the floor. Dick Stockton, commentating for CBS, said, \"I've never seen him (Magic) look like that\", referring to Magic's look of intense pain combined with resignation.\nThe Pistons had made the bucket on the break to tie the game at 75–75, but the Lakers, minus Johnson, charged to a 90–81 lead late in the period. In the fourth, however, the Lakers missed three easy baskets and committed an offensive foul as Detroit first tied the game, then went up 102–95. The gritty Lakers charged back and cut the lead to 106–104. The Pistons committed a 24-second violation, giving the Lakers the ball with eight seconds left.\nJames Worthy drove to the basket and was fouled, giving him an opportunity to tie the game. But the 1988 Finals MVP missed the first free throw. He made the second, bringing the Lakers within one, 106–105. Isiah Thomas then hit two free throws with one second remaining to give the Pistons a three-point lead and the Lakers, who called timeout to advance the ball to midcourt, one last chance to force overtime, but Jeff Lamp lost the ball on the inbound pass, and the horn sounded, ending Game 2 with the Pistons winning, 108–105, to take a 2–0 series lead.\nGame 3.\nThe Pistons had a 2–0 series lead, but knew it would be tough going in L.A. Magic Johnson tried to play, but the pain of his hamstring injury was just too great. He left Game 3 after just five minutes with the Lakers leading, 11–8.\nWithout Magic, the Lakers made a heroic effort. James Worthy scored 26 points, and the 42-year-old Kareem Abdul-Jabbar found the fountain of youth, contributing 24 points and 13 rebounds. Michael Cooper, the last remaining backcourt veteran, had 13 assists and 15 points. But it wasn't enough.\nDennis Rodman, despite suffering from painful back spasms, pulled down 19 rebounds between trips to the sideline for rubdowns. But the main effort came from the guards. Joe Dumars scored 31, including a remarkable third quarter in which he scored 17 consecutive points (21 in all for the period). Vinnie Johnson added 17, including 13 points in the fourth. Isiah Thomas pitched in with 26 points and eight assists, including six and three in the final period.\nThe Pistons led 113–108 with 15 seconds left when Thomas allowed A.C. Green to tie him up and steal the ball. Thomas then fouled Lakers rookie point guard David Rivers, who made both free throws, pulling Los Angeles to within three at 113–110 with 13 seconds left. Dumars then lost the ball out of bounds with nine seconds left, giving the Lakers a shot at the tie.\nThe Lakers then ran a play where Rivers got free for an open three-pointer in the corner. Dumars lunged and blocked the shot, and saved the ball from going out of bounds. The Pistons then ran out the clock after Bill Laimbeer's free throw to close the game with a 114–110 win, putting them on the verge of an unexpected sweep.\nGame 4.\nWith the Lakers' backs to the wall, coach Pat Riley admonished key offensive player James Worthy to step up his game. Worthy responded with a championship effort of 40 points on 17-of-26 field-goal shooting with Rick Mahorn in his face every step of the way. The Forum crowd was also anticipating Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's possible curtain call. During the pregame warmups and introductions, Kareem received several ovations.\nWith Worthy playing out of his mind, the Lakers took a 35–23 lead at the end of the first period. Despite trouble at the free-throw line (11 missed), the Pistons began to claw back as Los Angeles led 55–49 at intermission.\nThe Pistons started fast in the third quarter, beginning with a three-point basket by Bill Laimbeer. Mahorn then scored four quick points, and the Pistons took a 59–58 lead moments later. Dumars hit a driving bank shot, drew the foul and made the free throw, giving him 19 points on the evening. Mahorn followed that with another bucket and the Lakers called timeout. Worthy led the Lakers back into a 78–76 lead at the end of the third, but they knew the Pistons were coming on.\nThe Pistons took control of the game in the fourth, with James Edwards scoring particularly well. With 3:23 left and the Pistons leading 100–94, the crowd rose to a standing ovation as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar left the game. For the next two minutes, it seemed nobody wanted to hit a shot. Abdul-Jabbar reentered the game and spun and hit a bank shot with 1:37 left, his last two NBA points, cutting the Pistons' margin to 100–96. Kareem went out of the game with 47 seconds remaining amid thunderous applause.\nLaimbeer hit a jumper at the 28-second mark, and the Pistons began celebrating. Riley sent Abdul-Jabbar back in after the timeout, but Michael Cooper missed a three-pointer and Isiah Thomas was fouled. Riley then sent Orlando Woolridge in for Abdul-Jabbar, this time for good, prompting a standing ovation from the crowd and acknowledgment from the players on both the Lakers and, in a rare show of sportsmanship, the Pistons. Thomas then hit the foul shots, closing out the 105–97 win and the championship. Dumars was named Finals MVP.\nThis was the first NBA Finals that ended in a four-game sweep since the Finals went to the 2–3–2 format in 1985.\nTelevision coverage.\nThis series was aired on CBS. Dick Stockton and Hubie Brown called the action. Stockton also narrated the season-ending documentary \"Motor City Madness\" for NBA Entertainment.\nThat year, Pat O'Brien filled in for Brent Musburger for Game 2 as pre-game, half-time and post-game host as Musburger was on assignment for CBS Sports, the same thing that happened in 1988. CBS used three sideline reporters which were O'Brien (the Pistons' sideline), Lesley Visser (the Lakers' sideline) and James Brown (both teams). This was Musburger's last NBA Finals assignment for CBS, as he was fired on April 1, 1990, months before NBA's television contract with CBS expired. Musburger moved to ABC and ESPN, and later called nine NBA Finals series for ESPN Radio between and .\nFor the start of 1989 NBA Finals CBS completely revamped their opening montage for their NBA broadcasts. The computer-generated imagery (once again set in and around a virtual arena) was made to look more realistic (live-action footage was incorporated in the backdrops). Also, the familiar theme music (an uptempo series of four notes and three bars composed by Allyson Bellink since the 1983 NBA Finals) each was rearranged to sound more intricate and to have a more emotional impact, along the lines of the network's later World Series coverage. Between the 1989 NBA Finals and the 1990 NBA Finals' intros, the theme music was slightly revised; the 1989 Finals intro incorporated more of a guitar riff, while the 1990 Finals intro featured a little more usage of trumpets.\nAftermath.\nThe Pistons would repeat as champions in 1990. The Pistons won 59 games that season, then defeated the Indiana Pacers (3–0), New York Knicks (4–1) and Chicago Bulls (4–3) in the first three rounds, before overcoming the Portland Trail Blazers 4–1 in the Finals.\nThe Lakers earned the league's best record with a 63–19 record in the 1989–90 NBA season, despite losing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to retirement. However the Lakers fell to the Phoenix Suns 4–1 in the Western Conference Semifinals (a team that featured former Laker Kurt Rambis), after which head coach Pat Riley resigned and became the head coach of the New York Knicks. Riley would lead the Knicks to the finals in 1994 only to lose in a hard-fought seven games to the Houston Rockets. Riley would leave the Knicks after the 1994-95 season to become the head coach and president of the Miami Heat. The Lakers did make it back to the finals in 1991 but fell to the Bulls in five games.\nThe Pistons and Lakers met again in the 2004 NBA Finals. Much had changed since they last met, but they still took on the personalities of their respective teams: the more physical, defensive Pistons against the finesse, offensively-minded Lakers. In the rematch, the underdog Pistons, led by Ben Wallace, Chauncey Billups, Richard Hamilton, Rasheed Wallace and Tayshaun Prince, and coached by Larry Brown, upset the star-studded future Hall-of-Fame Lakers team of Kobe Bryant, Shaquille O'Neal, Karl Malone and Gary Payton, and coached by Phil Jackson, in five games."

        "text": "The 1988 NBA Finals was the championship round of the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s 1987–88 season, and the culmination of the season's playoffs. The Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Eastern Conference champion Detroit Pistons 4 games to 3 to win their eleventh title.\nOne of Los Angeles Lakers head coach Pat Riley's most famous moments came when he promised the crowd a repeat championship during the Lakers' 1987 championship parade in downtown Los Angeles. With every team in the league now gunning for them, the Los Angeles Lakers still found a way to win, taking their seventh consecutive Pacific Division title. While the 1988 Lakers did not produce as many wins in the regular season as the 1987 Lakers, they were just as successful in the playoffs, becoming the first team in 19 years to repeat as champions.\nOne of Pistons guard Isiah Thomas's career-defining performances came in Game 6. Despite badly twisting his ankle midway through the period, Thomas scored an NBA Finals record 25 third-quarter points, as Detroit fell valiantly, 103–102, to the Lakers at the Forum.\nThomas still managed to score 10 first-half points in Game 7, as Detroit built a 5-point lead. In the 3rd quarter, the Lakers, inspired by Finals MVP James Worthy and Byron Scott (14 3rd-quarter points), exploded as they built a 10-point lead entering the final period. The lead swelled to 15 before Detroit mounted a furious 4th-quarter rally, trimming the lead to two points on several occasions. The Lakers ultimately prevailed and captured their 5th championship in the last 9 seasons.\nThis was the first NBA Finals since 1983 not to feature the Boston Celtics.\nBackground.\nLos Angeles Lakers.\nDuring the 1987 championship parade in Los Angeles, Lakers coach Pat Riley guaranteed a repeat championship, a feat that had not been achieved since the Boston Celtics won the 1969 NBA Finals. Motivated by their coach's boast, the Lakers once again earned the league's best record in the 1987–88 season (62–20), despite winning three games less than the previous year. They also had a 15-game winning streak from December 11, 1987, until the Lakers were beaten by the LA Clippers (109–110) on January 13, 1988. They also had another double-digit winning streak (10-game winning streak) from February 11 until February 28.\nThe playoffs proved to be a difficult climb for the Lakers, however. They swept the San Antonio Spurs in the first round. They came back from a 2–1 deficit against the Utah Jazz in the semifinals round before beating them in Game 7. They then defeated the Dallas Mavericks in 7 games in the Conference Finals round. The Lakers eventually prevailed in both series thanks to their championship experience.\nDetroit Pistons.\nThe Pistons of head coach Chuck Daly were an up-and-coming team that gradually moved up the Eastern Conference ranks. Known as the \"Bad Boys\" for their physical and defensive-minded style of play, the Pistons' core featured guards Isiah Thomas and Joe Dumars, forwards Adrian Dantley and Rick Mahorn, center Bill Laimbeer, and bench players Vinnie Johnson, Dennis Rodman and John Salley. Midway through the season, Detroit gained a valuable backup to Laimbeer and Mahorn when they acquired James Edwards.\nThe 1987–88 season marked a further ascension for the franchise, as Detroit won the Central Division title with a 54–28 record. The second-seeded Pistons overcame the Washington Bullets and the Chicago Bulls in five games each, before facing the Boston Celtics once again in the conference finals. This time, the Pistons were the better team, eliminating the Celtics in six games for their first NBA Finals appearance since .\nRegular season series.\nThe Los Angeles Lakers won both games in the regular season series:\nSeries summary.\nGame 1.\nThe Pistons had just dispatched the Celtics in six games, while the Lakers were coming off back-to-back seven-game wins over the Utah Jazz and Dallas Mavericks. The Lakers were tired, and it showed. Adrian Dantley scored 34 points, hitting 14 of 16 shots from the field. The Pistons took control of the game with four seconds left in the first half when Bill Laimbeer hit a three-point shot to put the Pistons up 54–40. Isiah Thomas then stole Kareem's inbound pass at half court and let fly with another three-pointer which hit nothing but net at the halftime buzzer. The Pistons had a 57–40 halftime lead and never looked back, stealing Game 1 with a 105–93 win.\nGame 2.\nFacing the possibility of going down 2–0 with three games to play in Detroit, the veteran Lakers found resolve with a 108–96 win. James Worthy led the Lakers with 26 points, Byron Scott had 24, and Magic Johnson 23 despite battling the flu.\nGame 3.\nWith Magic still battling the flu, the Lakers got a key win in Detroit, 99–86, to go up 2–1 in games. The Lakers took control of the game in the third period, outscoring the Pistons 31–18. Despite his illness, Magic had 18 points, 14 assists, and six rebounds.\nGame 4.\nIn front of their home fans, the Pistons tied the series at 2–2 with a 111–86 win. The Pistons decided to attack the basket and make Magic Johnson defend. Johnson wound up on the bench early in the second half with foul trouble.\nWith Magic out of the game, the Pistons built a substantial lead. During timeouts, Bill Laimbeer was almost frantic. He kept saying, \"No letup! We don't let up!\" They didn't, and blew out the defending NBA champions by 25 points.\nLeft open by the trapping Lakers defense, Dantley led the team with 27 points. Vinnie Johnson came off the bench to add 16 while James Edwards had 14 points and five rebounds off the bench.\nGame 5.\nThe Pistons' 104–94 victory was a perfect farewell to the Pontiac Silverdome. Bill Laimbeer told Joe Dumars with a minute left in the game to \"look around and enjoy this because you'll never see anything like it again\". He went on to say, \"Forty-one thousand people waving towels and standing. It was awesome.\"\nThe Lakers opened Game 5 with a fury of physical intimidation, scoring the game's first 12 points. But that approach soon backfired, as the Laker big men got into foul trouble.\nDantley played a major role in the turnaround, scoring 25 points, 19 of them in the first half, to rally the Pistons to a 59–50 halftime lead. Vinnie Johnson added 12 of his 16 points in the first half to keep Detroit moving.\nJoe Dumars added 19 points on 9-of-13 shooting to send the Pistons back to Los Angeles, one win away from their first NBA title.\nGames 3, 4, and 5 were the last NBA Finals games to be contested in a domed stadium built primarily for football until the 1999 NBA Finals in which Games 1 and 2 were played at the Alamodome in San Antonio. The Pistons left the Pontiac Silverdome after the 1987–88 season and moved into The Palace of Auburn Hills for the 1988-89 NBA season.\nGame 6.\nThe Lakers led 56–48 in the third quarter when Isiah Thomas suddenly began a classic performance. He scored his team's next 14 points, hitting two free throws, a driving layup, four jump shots, and a running bank shot.\nWith a little less than 5 minutes left in the period and the score 70–64, Lakers, Thomas rolled his right ankle while passing off to Joe Dumars for a basket. Thomas tried to run upcourt, but collapsed while the Lakers scored again. Despite a severe sprain, Thomas returned to the game with 3:44 left and the Lakers up 74–66. Thomas, with his bad ankle, scored 11 of the Pistons' last 15 points of the quarter to finish with 25, an NBA Finals record for one quarter, on 11-of-13 shooting. During this time, the Pistons outscored the Lakers 15–5 to take an 81–79 lead.\nThe fourth quarter was nip-and-tuck; with 1:30 left, Thomas, sore ankle and all, hit a baseline jumper for his 42nd and 43rd points to give the Pistons a 100–99 lead. The Lakers came down and Magic Johnson got the ball inside to James Worthy, but his layup attempt was blocked by Dennis Rodman. Joe Dumars penetrated inside on the ensuing possession, was fouled, and hit the two free throws for a three-point lead at 102–99 with a minute left.\nThe Lakers called timeout, and on the next possession, Byron Scott drove by Thomas from the top of the key and hit a 14-footer from the right elbow to cut the lead to one with 45 seconds left. Thomas then missed another baseline jumper and Worthy rebounded with 27 seconds remaining. The Lakers then set up and Scott got it to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who drew a foul on Bill Laimbeer (his sixth) as he wheeled for a skyhook on the right baseline with 14 seconds left. This foul has remained controversial to the Pistons and their fans, who claim that Laimbeer never made contact with Jabbar on his shot attempt. Abdul-Jabbar then proceeded to sink two high-pressure free throws providing the Lakers with a one-point lead.\nAfter a time out, the Pistons set up for a final shot. Thomas collided with Dantley after inbounding the ball, but Dumars penetrated in the paint and put up a shot that missed after he was forced to by A.C. Green to alter it. After a scramble, Scott came up with the ball for the Lakers and was shoved out of bounds by Rodman, inciting a near-fight, with 5 seconds left on the clock. Scott missed both free throw attempts, but the Pistons, who had no timeouts remaining, lost precious seconds trying to secure the loose rebound and could not get a shot off before time expired.\nThomas would end up with 43 points and eight assists in a heroic performance.\nGame 7.\nThis was the first Game 7 since , and the first to be played under the 2–3–2 format, adopted in .\nIn the final game, Thomas' ankle was still sore, as evidenced by his limping badly in warm-ups. He did manage to play the first half, scoring 10 points and leading the Pistons to a 52–47 halftime lead. But, the delay between halves caused the ankle to stiffen, and Thomas played little in the second half. With Isiah on the bench, the Lakers turned the halftime deficit into a 90–75 lead early in the 4th quarter. A key factor was Laker guard Michael Cooper; he had been mired in a terrible shooting slump all series, but suddenly caught fire, hitting three 3-point baskets.\nChuck Daly then went to a faster lineup with Dennis Rodman, John Salley, Joe Dumars, and Vinnie Johnson that created matchup problems for the Lakers and enabled the Pistons to score at a torrid pace. With 3:54 left, Salley canned two free throws to cut the Laker lead to 98–92, making the Forum fans nervous.\nWith 1:17 left, Dumars hit a jump shot to cut the lead to 102–100. Magic Johnson then hit a free throw after a Rodman foul to put the Lakers up by three. After the two teams exchanged turnovers, Rodman took an ill-advised jumper with 40 seconds left. Byron Scott rebounded and was fouled. His two free throws pushed the lead to 105–100. After another Pistons' turnover, Michael Cooper had a chance to essentially clinch the victory after being fouled, but he missed both free throws, and the Lakers' lead remained at five.\nAfter Dumars made a layup, James Worthy hit a free throw and Bill Laimbeer canned a 28-foot three-pointer, pushing the score to 106–105 with six seconds showing. A.C. Green completed the scoring with a layup off a length-of-the court pass from Magic, making it 108–105. Laimbeer made a long desperate pass to Thomas who caught the ball trying to shoot a three to send the game to overtime, but Thomas fell to the floor in a collision with Johnson, losing the ball as time ran out. Fans were already beginning to storm onto the floor even though time had not expired, but the officials ignored this. Pat Riley and the Laker players hurried back to their dressing room as the players and coaches on both teams were pummeled by the storming fans.\nWorthy racked up a monster triple-double: 36 points, 16 rebounds and 10 assists. It would prove to be the only triple-double in Worthy's Hall of Fame career. For that and his earlier efforts in the series, he was named the Finals MVP, cementing his nickname \"Big Game James\".\nMichael Cooper, Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar are the only members of all 5 Lakers championship teams from the 1980s. Pat Riley is the only coach that was on all 5 Lakers championship teams from the 1980s, he was an assistant coach on the 1980 championship team, and head coach on the other four championship teams.\nThis was the Lakers' first Game 7 Finals victory since 1954; however, it was their first ever Game 7 win in the championship series since moving to Los Angeles in 1960; they were 0–5 in previous Game 7's since moving (1962, 1966, 1969, 1970, 1984). This would end up being the Lakers' last home win in the championship series until 2000.\nTelevision coverage.\nThe Detroit Pistons season documentary \"Bad Boys\", narrated by George Blaha recaps Detroit's run to the Finals and how they garnered the \"Bad Boys\" moniker while the Los Angeles Lakers documentary \"Back To Back\", narrated by Chick Hearn recaps the Lakers quest to become the first team since the Bill Russell-led Celtics to achieve NBA championships in consecutive years.\nThat year, CBS Sports used three sideline reporters which were Pat O'Brien (the Pistons' sideline), Lesley Visser (the Lakers' sideline) and James Brown (both teams). Dick Stockton and Billy Cunningham served as the play-by-play announcer and color analyst respectively. After the season, Cunningham left CBS to join the Miami Heat ownership group, and Hubie Brown was promoted the following season."

        "text": "The 1987 NBA Finals was the championship round of the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s 1986–87 season, and the culmination of the season's playoffs. The Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Eastern Conference and defending NBA champion Boston Celtics 4 games to 2. The key moment of the series was Magic Johnson's Junior sky hook in Game 4. This was the tenth time that the Celtics and Lakers met in the NBA Finals (more than any other Finals matchup). It would be the Celtics' last Finals appearance until the two teams met in 2008.\nThis was the first NBA Championship Series conducted entirely in June. The last time there were no NBA Championship Series games in May was in the 1970–1971 season, when the finals (a four-game sweep that year) ended on April 30. It is also the first NBA Finals series to be conducted on a Sunday-Tuesday-Thursday rotation, which was in use until 1990 and revived since the 2004 NBA Finals; in between the NBA Finals were conducted on a Sunday-Wednesday-Friday rotation.\nBackground.\nBoston Celtics.\nThanks to the 1984 trade of Gerald Henderson and the subsequent fall of the Seattle SuperSonics, at the end of 1985–86 the Celtics were not only the best team in the NBA but also owned the second pick in the 1986 NBA draft. They chose Len Bias with the pick and had high hopes that the presence of the young Maryland Terrapins star would ensure that the franchise would remain a powerhouse after Bird, McHale, and Parish retired. Unfortunately, Bias died 48 hours after being drafted, after using cocaine at a party and overdosing.\nThe Celtics finished the regular season with a 59–23 record, best in the Eastern Conference. Despite retaining the core of the team that won the championship a year earlier, Boston endured numerous injuries to its roster. Their bench, an asset of the previous year's team, was decimated by injuries to Scott Wedman and Bill Walton. With limited options, head coach K. C. Jones was forced to give his starting five of Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, Robert Parish, Dennis Johnson and Danny Ainge extended minutes, but the lengthy playing time took its toll on the players' health, and by the start of the playoffs, the Celtics were a roster full of walking wounded.\nAfter sweeping the Chicago Bulls in the first round, the Celtics were pushed to a Game 7 in the next two rounds by the Milwaukee Bucks and the Detroit Pistons, only to advance each time. Still, the Celtics' health became a question mark as they entered the Finals.\nLos Angeles Lakers.\nThe Lakers finished the regular season with a league-best 65–17 record. Head coach Pat Riley made a strategical move, shifting the offensive focus to Magic Johnson. The Lakers acquired center Mychal Thompson via trade midway through the season. Both moves helped alleviate the load off of the aging Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who turned 40 during the playoffs. A.C. Green supplanted Kurt Rambis in the starting lineup.\nDuring the Lakers' path to the Finals they swept the Denver Nuggets in the first round, defeated the Golden State Warriors in five games during the second round, and swept the Seattle SuperSonics in the conference finals.\nThis 1987 Lakers team is widely considered both Magic Johnson's best team, and one of the greatest teams in NBA history. There are many reasons for this besides Magic Johnson being league MVP this year instead of Larry Bird: Kareem was still in late prime condition, the Lakers had many scoring options, they had an excellent defense which included defensive player of the year Michael Cooper, and Mychal Thompson's elite post defense Meant they had another body to throw at the likes of McHale and Parish of the Celtics.\nRegular season series.\nThe Los Angeles Lakers won both games in the regular season series:\nSeries summary.\nGame 1.\nThe Lakers were coming off a four-game sweep of the Seattle SuperSonics, while the Celtics were coming off a grueling seven-game win over the Detroit Pistons. Magic Johnson led a 126–113 victory with 29 points, 13 assists, eight rebounds and no turnovers. James Worthy, on the receiving end of many of Johnson's passes, had 33 points and nine rebounds. The Lakers ran 35 fast breaks in the first two quarters and led by 15 at intermission.\nGame 2.\nThe Celtics plan for Game 2 was to concentrate on stopping Magic Johnson. Danny Ainge, at 6'5\", could not deal with the 6'9\" Magic. In this game, Michael Cooper emerged as a great 3 point shooter. He hit six 3 pointers, a playoff record. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar added 23 points on 10 of 14 shots, while Magic posted 20 assists and 22 points. It all added up to a 141–122 rout, Boston's sixth straight road loss in the playoffs.\nGame 3.\nThe Celtics recovered from their two knockout blows in Games 1 and 2 with a counterpunch of their own. A little-used backup center, Greg Kite, provided the spark. Kite, entering the game late in the first quarter when Robert Parish encountered foul trouble, played 20 minutes, and while he failed to score, he grabbed nine rebounds, blocked a Magic Johnson layup, and did solid body work on Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The defensive minutes Kite gave Boston from the bench were just enough, as Larry Bird scored 30 points and Dennis Johnson hit 11 of 22 attempts from the field to finish with 26 points. The resurgent Celtics shot 17 of 21 from the floor in the second quarter.\nKevin McHale Celtics' forward bounced back in Boston with 21 points and 10 rebounds while letting the air out of James Worthy's game, limiting the Lakers' forward to only 13 points and three rebounds. Magic led the Lakers with 32 points in the 109–103 loss.\nGame 4.\nAfter their Game 3 win, Larry Bird said, \"This (Game 3) was the most important game of the series for us. If we lost, it might've been tough to get up for Game 4. Now it's going to be easy.\"\nThe Celtics took it right to the Lakers, controlling the boards and taking a 55–47 lead into halftime. The Celtics had a balanced scoring attack with Kevin McHale, Robert Parish, Danny Ainge, and Dennis Johnson all scoring in double figures. In the 3rd quarter, Bird finally got hot by scoring 12 in the quarter and helping the Celtics lead by as many as 16 points. But Los Angeles fought back to cut the Celtics lead to 85–78 going into the 4th.\nIn the 4th quarter the Lakers continued fighting back until they managed to tie the game at 95–95 on a Kareem Abdul-Jabbar skyhook with 5:30 remaining. The Celtics responded on both ends of the court by going on an 8–0 run, helped by good defense which led to 2 fast-break lay-ups to take a 103–96 lead with 2 minutes left. Then the Lakers called time out. On the Celtics' next possession, Robert Parish lost the ball to Michael Cooper. Cooper passed the ball ahead to Magic Johnson, who started a break. Cooper spotted up in 3-point territory, while Magic drove, forcing Cooper's defender to help out. Magic then kicked the ball out to a now wide open Cooper who drilled the three to cut the lead to 103–100.\nOn the Celtics next possession, Larry Bird forced a pass to Kevin McHale in the post, which instead sailed out of bounds, giving possession right back to the Lakers. James Worthy then hit a tough fade-away over Kevin McHale and Robert Parish in the lane to cut the deficit to one. On the very next possession, Bird missed a step-back jumper over the outstretched frame of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and the Lakers got the ball back with just under 45 seconds remaining. The Lakers called a timeout to set up a pick for Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The pass was there for an alley-oop dunk, and the Lakers took a 104–103 lead, their first lead since early in the 1st quarter. The Celtics called timeout with 29 seconds left in the game.\nOut of the timeout Bird threw the ball inbounds and was immediately face-guarded by James Worthy. In fact, Worthy had a fist-full of Bird's jersey to make sure Bird would not score. With Worthy's defense, the Celtics could not get their best player the ball and instead went through the motions of their offense until Danny Ainge got open. That forced Worthy to let go of Bird and help out on Ainge. Bird immediately got himself open by going to the 3-point line right in front of the Lakers' bench. Ainge found Bird wide open and Bird hit the three point bomb with 12 seconds left, to put Boston up 106–104 and sent the Boston Garden crowd into a frenzy.\nOn the next possession, Abdul-Jabbar was fouled and went to the line, where he made the first and missed the second. The officials ruled that McHale fumbled the ball out of bounds with seven seconds left.\nWhat followed was another play for the ages. Magic set a pick on Kevin McHale, which almost opened up a lay-up for Worthy, but Dennis Johnson was able to switch over in time on help defend. However, that left McHale scrambling to guard Magic who just got open and received the inbounds pass near the left sideline. Twenty feet from the basket, Magic had the advantage on the post-defender McHale, who was also playing through a bad ankle injury. Magic dribbled, hesitated to get McHale off-balance, then drove into the paint. Magic then lofted a hook shot, which just cleared the fingertips of both McHale and Parish, and swished through the net giving the Lakers a 107–106 lead with only 2 seconds left.\nThe Celtics still had one last shot: Dennis inbounded the ball to Bird, who had broken to the corner. Larry, to his surprise, found himself wide open behind the 3-point line right in front of the Lakers' bench. Bird caught the inbounds pass from Johnson, turned, and put up a fall-away jumper as time expired. The shot barely missed as the Boston crowd let out a collective groan and the Lakers' bench danced off the court to celebrate the victory. The win gave the Lakers a commanding 3–1 series lead.\nGame 5.\nThe Celtics had to win Game 5 in the Garden, and would control most of the game. Danny Ainge set the tone by nailing 5 of 6 from 3-point range to give Boston early control, including a halfcourt heave at the buzzer before halftime.\nMagic countered for Los Angeles with 29 points, 12 assists, eight rebounds, and four steals, but he received little help. Before the game Bird had told his teammates, \"If they want to celebrate, let's not let them do it on the parquet.\" The Celtics had incentive enough. They got their second win, 123–108, and the series jetted back across the continent.\nGame 6.\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar arrived for Game 6 with a shaved head and a determination to close out this series. For a while, though, it appeared like the Celtics would steal it. Magic Johnson had only four points at the half and Dennis Johnson poured in 18 for the Celtics on his way to a game-high 33 as Boston led 56–51 at intermission.\nThe Lakers scored the first two baskets of the second half to cut it to 56–55. On the Celtics' ensuing possession, James Worthy deflected a pass and gave chase. Worthy went to the floor, batted the ball inbounds to a breaking Magic Johnson, and Magic slammed home a breakaway dunk. This gave the Lakers their first lead of the game 57–56, since early in the first quarter, and they never trailed again. The Lakers outscored the Celtics 30–12 in the third quarter for an 18-point turnaround, mostly on fast breaks. The score at the end of three quarters was 81–68, Lakers. The Celtics only scored 12 points in the third quarter, one more than the record for the lowest scoring quarter in playoff history.\nWorthy would finish with 22 points, and Mychal Thompson had 16 points and 10 rebounds off the bench, but the play of the Lakers' two superstars, Magic and Kareem, would be the dagger that finished off the Celtics. Magic recovered from his cold first half to post 16 points, 19 assists, and eight rebounds, and Kareem would pump in a team-high 32 points.\n\"Magic is a great, great basketball player,\" Bird stated flatly, settling the issue for the moment. \"The best I've ever seen.\"\nIndeed, Magic would gain the NBA Finals MVP award and his fourth championship ring.\nFor the Lakers, this would be their last NBA Finals series triumph over the Celtics until 2010.\nTeam rosters.\nLos Angeles Lakers.\n \nTelevision coverage.\nThe Boston Celtics season documentary \"Home of the Brave\", narrated by David Perry, recaps Boston's 1987 season while the Los Angeles Lakers documentary \"Drive for Five\", narrated by legendary Lakers announcer Chick Hearn, recaps the Lakers' magnificent 1987 season in route to a fourth title of the 1980s.\nCBS' James Brown filled in for Pat O'Brien when he attended the birth of his son. Brown was on for Games 3 and 4. Both Brown and O'Brien reported on the Lakers' sideline. While Lesley Visser was on for all the games as sideline reporter for CBS as she reported on the Celtics' sideline.\nDick Stockton and Tom Heinsohn worked play-by-play and color commentary respectively. It was the fourth consecutive and last Finals series to pair Stockton and Heinsohn together; Heinsohn was demoted in favor of Billy Cunningham following the series. At the time, Stockton and Heinsohn had worked the most number of NBA Finals series together. ESPN/ABC's Mike Breen, Mark Jackson and Jeff Van Gundy later broke the record for the most complete NBA Finals series called by a single television play-by-play/color commentary team following the 2011 NBA Finals, and called a record 14 complete NBA Finals series in total (the 2022 NBA Finals did involve the trio of Breen, Jackson and Van Gundy, but Mark Jones filled in for Breen on play-by-play in Games 1 and 2 due to his recovery from COVID-19, and Van Gundy missed Game 1 for the same reason).\nAftermath.\nThe 1987 Finals would be the Celtics' last until their championship season, but would be the last for the 'Big Three' of Larry Bird, Kevin McHale and Robert Parish. In K.C. Jones' final season as Celtics' coach they still won the Atlantic Division title by winning 57 games, but the Celtics fell in six games to the Detroit Pistons, in the rematch of their Eastern Conference Finals showdown in 1988. The Celtics would not reach that far again for the next 14 years.\nFollowing their championship win, Lakers coach Pat Riley guaranteed a repeat championship during the team's championship parade a few days after winning the NBA Finals. The 1987-88 NBA season, despite winning three games less than the previous year, was still a success for the Lakers. However their playoff run would not be as smooth as expected. With the exception of a three-game first round sweep of the San Antonio Spurs, the Lakers were pushed to a Game 7 by the Utah Jazz, Dallas Mavericks, and Detroit Pistons before claiming the first repeat championship since the Celtics of .\nPrior to 2008, the Celtics and Lakers came close to renewing their rivalry in the 2002 NBA Finals. But while the Lakers defeated the Sacramento Kings 4–3, the Celtics lost to the New Jersey Nets 4–2 in their respective conference finals."

        "text": "The 1986 NBA Finals was the championship round of the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s 1985–86 season, and the culmination of the season's playoffs. It pitted the Eastern Conference champion Boston Celtics against the Western Conference champion Houston Rockets, in a rematch of the 1981 NBA Finals (though only Allen Leavell and Robert Reid remained from the Rockets' 1981 team). It was the second and last NBA Championship Series of the 1980s not to feature the Los Angeles Lakers, who were eliminated by the Rockets on both occasions.\nThe heavily favored Celtics defeated the Rockets four games to two to win their 16th NBA championship. The championship would be the Celtics' last until 2008. Larry Bird was named the Finals MVP.\nOn another note, this series marked the first time the \"NBA Finals\" branding was officially used, as they dropped the \"NBA World Championship Series\" branding which had been in use since the beginning of the league, though it had been unofficially called the \"NBA Finals\" for years.\nUntil the 2011 series, this was the last time the NBA Finals had started before June. Since game three, all NBA Finals games have been played in June. Starting with the following year, the NBA Finals would be held exclusively in the month of June. It was also the last NBA Finals series to schedule a game on a Monday until 1999 and also the last NBA Finals game to be played on Memorial Day. Until the 2018 series, it was the last to conclude before June 10.\nCBS Sports used Dick Stockton and Tom Heinsohn as the play-by-play man and color commentator respectively. Meanwhile, Brent Musburger was the host and Pat O'Brien (the Rockets' sideline) and Lesley Visser (the Celtics' sideline) were the sideline reporters.\nBackground.\nBoston Celtics.\nThe Celtics made the 1985 NBA Finals, but lost in six games to the Los Angeles Lakers. The series exposed some of Boston's weaknesses, such as the lack of bench scoring, which was exploited after Kevin McHale moved to the starting lineup with Cedric Maxwell bothered by knee injuries. In addition, Larry Bird played through an elbow injury, which severely affected his shooting. In the offseason, president Red Auerbach decided to tweak the roster, trading Maxwell to the Los Angeles Clippers for off-injured center Bill Walton. He also made a trade with the Indiana Pacers, acquiring Jerry Sichting for Quinn Buckner. These moves would pave the way for the Celtics' greatest season yet.\nEntering the 1985–86 season, the Celtics surged to a league-best 67–15 record, powered by an NBA record 40 victories at home. Their incomparable home record alone (since tied by the San Antonio Spurs in the regular season) put the Celtics in the conversation among the NBA's greatest teams in a single season.\nIn the playoffs, Boston needed just three games to defeat the Chicago Bulls in the first round, despite a playoff record 63 points by Michael Jordan in Game 2. When asked about Jordan's performance in Boston's 135-131 2OT victory, Boston's coach K. C. Jones said, \"I don't have a word for today.\" In retrospect, this game is considered to be a classic clash of the NBA's (arguably) greatest player, Jordan, and the NBA's (arguably) greatest team, Bird's 1985–86 Celtics. In the second round, Boston eliminated the Atlanta Hawks in five games, with the clinching Game 5 a no-doubter as Boston outscored Atlanta 36–6 in the third quarter in route to a 132–99 victory. Then in the conference finals, Boston swept the Milwaukee Bucks in four games, a direct reversal of their second round meeting in the 1983 NBA Playoffs.\nHouston Rockets.\nFollowing their previous Finals appearance in , the Rockets entered a brief rebuilding period. Long-time Rockets Calvin Murphy and Rudy Tomjanovich retired, while Mike Dunleavy, Sr., Bill Willoughby, Tom Henderson and Billy Paultz moved on to different teams. But the biggest move came during the 1982 offseason, when the Rockets traded Moses Malone to the champions Philadelphia 76ers. The loss of Malone sent the Rockets to a league-worst 14–68 record in the 1982–83 season, after which the Rockets were awarded the top pick of the 1983 NBA draft and selected Ralph Sampson.\nAfter a 29-win season in 1984, the Rockets were once again rewarded with the top pick in the 1984 NBA draft. They selected another center in Akeem Olajuwon, and paired alongside Sampson, they were dubbed as the \"Twin Towers\". Houston also added some valuable role players to complement the duo and holdovers Allen Leavell and Robert Reid, acquiring Rodney McCray, Lewis Lloyd, Craig Ehlo, Mitchell Wiggins and Jim Petersen.\nUnder third-year head coach Bill Fitch (the head coach of the 1980–81 Celtics championship team), the Rockets posted a 51–31 record and won the Midwest Division title. In the first round, they swept the Sacramento Kings, then eliminated the Denver Nuggets in six games during the second round. In the conference finals, they were matched up against the defending champion Los Angeles Lakers, and after losing Game 1, the Rockets stunned the Lakers by winning the final four games, highlighted by a series-clinching buzzer beater by Sampson in Game 5.\nRegular season series.\nThe Boston Celtics won both games in the regular season series:\nThe Finals.\nThe Larry Bird–led Celtics defeated the Rockets again 4 games to 2 in the 1986 NBA Finals. The Celtics won the first two games at the Boston Garden, where they had gone 40–1 during the regular season. The Rockets had been almost as good at home during the regular season, and they defeated the Celtics 106–104 in game three. Game 4 was a tense battle at the Summit, which the Celtics won 106–103, with Bill Walton coming off the bench for a tired Robert Parish to score a crucial basket. The infamous fifth game featured the signature moment of the series, when 7'4\" Ralph Sampson ignited a brawl with Jerry Sichting, a player shorter than Sampson, leading to his ejection. While Jim Petersen led the Rockets to a decisive victory, Sampson's actions motivated the Celtics to end the series in six. Bird dismantled the young Rockets in game 6; the raucous Garden crowd booed every time Sampson touched the ball. The Celtics eliminated the Rockets 114–97 in a game that wasn't as close as the score would indicate.\nWith backup forward Scott Wedman sidelined due to a wrist injury, Bird got very little rest during the six-game series, logging 269 out of a possible 288 minutes of floor time. Bird was named the Finals' MVP for that year, averaging 24 points, 9.7 rebounds, 9.7 assists, and 2.7 steals per game for the series. The Celtics' victory capped off a 29-year period that had seen them win 16 championships and it was their last championship until 2008.\nSeries summary.\nGame 1.\nThe \"Twin Towers\" Ralph Sampson and Akeem Olajuwon were saddled with foul trouble for much of the game. Sampson got three quick fouls just 4:45 into the game and scored only two points; Olajuwon picked up five fouls despite scoring 33, 25 of which came in the first half. The backcourt tandem of Dennis Johnson and Danny Ainge provided the third quarter spurt for the Celtics, combining for 22 points, while Boston held Houston to just 17 points in an expected victory.\nGame 2.\nThe third quarter again proved decisive for the Celtics, outscoring the Rockets 34–19 in the quarter. Sampson and Olajuwon combined for 32 points in the first half, but only seven in the second. Larry Bird paced the Celtics with 31 points on 12-for-19 shooting, while Kevin McHale added 25 in another Boston rout. It was Boston's 40th consecutive victory at home, regular season and playoffs combined.\nGame 3.\nThe Rockets rallied from eight points down in the fourth quarter before escaping to a much-needed two-point win at home, despite another third quarter meltdown. Sampson and Olajuwon combined for 47 points and 30 rebounds, Robert Reid added 20, while reserve guard Mitchell Wiggins tipped in off an Olajuwon miss late in the fourth to put the Rockets ahead for good. The Celtics only managed one more shot in their final two possessions, a missed 5-footer by Robert Parish. Kevin McHale and Larry Bird both scored 28 points in the loss, but Bird was held to 3-for-12 shooting in the second half due to Reid's defense.\nGame 4.\nLarry Bird's three-pointer with 2:26 remaining gave Boston the lead for good, while holding the Rockets to just one basket in the final four minutes, keyed by Kevin McHale forcing three turnovers on Houston's final three possessions. Robert Parish scored 22 while hauling 15 rebounds. Dennis Johnson also added 22, while Bird scored 21 and dished out 10 assists. Ralph Sampson led the Rockets with 25 points, while Akeem Olajuwon, Robert Reid and Rodney McCray added 21, 19 and 17 respectively. The Rockets suffered their first home loss of the 1986 playoffs.\nGame 5.\nThe game was highlighted by Ralph Sampson's ejection early in the second quarter. With 9:40 remaining in the second, Sampson threw punches at the Celtics' reserve guard Jerry Sichting, 16 inches shorter than Sampson, leading to his ejection while the benches were cleared. The Rockets were leading 34–33 at the time of the brawl, and would lead by as many as 25 points in the second half to score a lopsided victory. Akeem Olajuwon scored 32 points while blocking 8 shots. Though Kevin McHale scored 33, Larry Bird was held to only 17 points, ultimately leading to one of the worst losses suffered by the Celtics that season.\nAs of 2022, this remains the last NBA Finals game to be played by the Celtics in a state other than Massachusetts or California.\nGame 6.\nLarry Bird recorded a triple-double of 29 points, 11 rebounds and 12 assists to pace a lopsided Boston win that clinched their 16th NBA championship. Kevin McHale added 29 points, 10 rebounds and four blocks. Olajuwon paced the Rockets with 21 points and 10 rebounds, but Ralph Sampson was held to only eight points on 4-for-12 shooting, visibly distracted by an angry Boston Garden crowd in the aftermath of Game 5. The Celtics led by as much as 30 in the fourth to put away the Rockets.\nFollowing the conclusion of the 1986 NBA Finals, a video documentary of the 1985–86 NBA season, known as \"Sweet Sixteen\", was released. David Perry was the narrator after Dick Stockton narrated the last three NBA season documentaries.\nThis would be the city of Boston's last professional sports championship until 2002 when the New England Patriots won Super Bowl XXXVI. Had the 1985 Patriots and the 1986 Boston Red Sox won Super Bowl XX and the 1986 World Series, respectively (the Patriots lost 46–10 to the Chicago Bears, while the Red Sox lost in seven games to the New York Mets), it would have given Boston three different professional sports championships in the same calendar year. In 2007–08, the city came very close to achieving this, as the 2007 Red Sox and 2007–08 Celtics won titles, but the 2007 Patriots lost Super Bowl XLII to the New York Giants. A Houston–Boston World Series was also a possibility; however, the Mets defeated the Houston Astros in six games of the 1986 National League Championship Series. In 2018–19, the 2018 Red Sox won the 2018 World Series, while the 2018 Patriots won Super Bowl LIII, giving Boston two different professional sports championships within a year, while the 2018–19 Boston Bruins reached the 2019 Stanley Cup Finals, but lost to the St. Louis Blues in seven games.\nThe closing song following Game 6 was \"Whatever We Imagine\" by James Ingram."

        "text": "The 1985 NBA World Championship Series was the championship round of the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s 1984–85 season, and the culmination of the season's playoffs. It featured the defending NBA champion and Eastern Conference playoff champion Boston Celtics against the Western Conference playoff champion Los Angeles Lakers.\nThe Celtics were looking to repeat as NBA champions for the first time since the season. The Celtics had home court advantage for the second year in a row as they finished the regular season with a 63–19 record while the Lakers compiled a 62–20 record. The Lakers looked to bounce back from the previous year's painful loss to the Celtics in the championship series, and were still seeking to beat Boston for the first time ever in NBA Finals history. Also for the first time since 1955, the Finals implemented a 2–3–2 format with Games 1 and 2 in Boston while the next three games were in Los Angeles. The final two games of the series would be played in Boston, if required. This change of format came after David Stern had a conversation with Celtics legend Red Auerbach in 1984, who disliked the frequent traveling between games. The 2–3–2 format would be used until the 2013 NBA Finals, after which the 2–2–1–1–1 format returned in 2014.\nWith the help of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Magic Johnson, the Los Angeles Lakers achieved their first NBA Finals victory over the Boston Celtics in nine meetings, four to two games. The Lakers recovered after losing in a rout in game 1, dubbed as the \"Memorial Day Massacre\". The series was the last time the NBA World Championship Series branding would be in use as the NBA Finals branding would replace it for 1986. The video documentary \"Return to Glory\" recaps the 1985 NBA playoffs action.\nBackground.\nLos Angeles Lakers.\nAfter losing to the Celtics in the previous year's finals, the Lakers entered the 1984–85 NBA season with a mission. Once again using the effective Showtime offense, they ran away with the Western Conference-leading 62 wins. The team as a whole underwent a slight evolution, as James Worthy supplanted Jamaal Wilkes as the starting small forward, while Byron Scott began to earn more minutes as the backup to both Magic Johnson and Michael Cooper.\nIn the playoffs, the Lakers eliminated the Phoenix Suns, Portland Trail Blazers and Denver Nuggets, going 11–2 in the three playoff rounds.\nBoston Celtics.\nThe Celtics repeated with the NBA's best record by winning 63 games. For the second straight season, Larry Bird won the MVP award, while Kevin McHale won Sixth Man Award for the second year running, despite making the transition from bench cog to starter late in the season with Cedric Maxwell nursing a knee injury. Danny Ainge also emerged as the team's starting shooting guard, after the Celtics traded Gerald Henderson to the Seattle SuperSonics in the offseason.\nThe Celtics defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers, Detroit Pistons and Philadelphia 76ers, finishing with an 11–4 record heading into the finals. By that point, Boston's classic starting five under head coach K. C. Jones was solidified, featuring Bird, McHale and Robert Parish in the frontcourt, and Ainge and Dennis Johnson in the backcourt.\nRegular season series.\nBoth teams split the two meetings, each won by the home team:\nSeries summary.\nGame 1.\nThe Celtics defeated the Lakers 148–114. It was dubbed the \"Memorial Day Massacre\" and a profound embarrassment for the Lakers team. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar had only 12 points and 3 rebounds, while Magic Johnson pulled down only one rebound. Danny Ainge of the Celtics started hot, scoring 15 points in the first quarter. Scott Wedman made all 11 shots he took from the field. Afterwards, Abdul-Jabbar apologized to his teammates for his terrible performance.\nThe 34-point differential set a new record for a Finals game between the Celtics and Lakers in their rivalry. This record would stand until the 2008 NBA Finals, when the Celtics defeated the Lakers, 131–92.\nGame 2.\nThe Lakers recovered from the Game 1 loss behind Abdul-Jabbar's 30 points, 17 rebounds, 3 blocks, and 8 assists. Lakers swingman Michael Cooper finished with 22 points on an 8 for 9 shooting performance, including several clutch outside jumpers down the stretch. The series was evened at 1–1.\nGame 3.\nThe Celtics held a 48–38 lead in the second quarter before the Lakers rallied and led, 65–59, at halftime. The Lakers pulled away in the second half and won the game 136–111. Abdul-Jabbar scored his 4,456th career point and became the league's all-time leading playoff scorer, which had previously been held by Lakers guard Jerry West. Larry Bird's shooting slump from game 2 continued. He shot a combined 17 of 42 from the field in games two and three. James Worthy led the Lakers with 29 points.\nGame 4.\nThe Celtics tied the series in the fourth game with a 107–105 win with a buzzer-beating jumper by Dennis Johnson, who scored 27 points. Kevin McHale led all players with 28 points to go along with 12 rebounds for the Celtics.\nGame 5.\nIn this game, the Lakers stomped out the Celtics by jumping out to a 64–51 lead and stretched it to 89–72 before the Celtics cut the deficit to 4 points, late in the 4th quarter. The Celtics would cut the lead to 4 points several times, but the Lakers answered each time. Magic Johnson made three shots, Kareem added four more shots, and Cooper hit 2 outside jumpers, and the Lakers came away with a 120–111 victory to take a 3–2 series lead.\nGame 6.\nIn the series clincher, the game was tied at halftime. The Lakers would hold the Celtics to just 18 third quarter points to pull away. Abdul-Jabbar scored 29 points and James Worthy scored 28 of his own, as Los Angeles became the first team to clinch a title at the Boston Garden. Magic Johnson dished out a game-high 14 assists. Celtics' forward Kevin McHale scored 32 points and grabbed 16 rebounds—both game-highs—before fouling out in the fourth quarter. Larry Bird's dismal shooting continued as he hit just 12 of 29 shots.\nThe 38-year-old Abdul-Jabbar was named MVP of the series, his second Finals MVP award and first since 1971 (back when he was known as Lew Alcindor), averaging 25.7 points, 9.0 rebounds, 5.2 assists and 1.5 blocks in six games. Worthy averaged 23.7 points for the Lakers, while Magic Johnson scored 18.3 points per game to go along with 14.0 assists and 6.8 rebounds. Los Angeles shot 51.2% as a team for the series.\nMcHale led Boston in scoring (26.0) and rebounding (10.7) while shooting 59.8% from the floor. Bird averaged 23.8 points and 8.8 rebounds on just 44.9% shooting. Celtics' guard Dennis Johnson led both teams in minutes played (247). Boston shot 47.6% from the floor while out-rebounding Los Angeles 259–256.\nIt was the first time (and only time until 2022) in NBA Finals history where the other team clinched the championship against the Celtics in Boston. It was also only the Celtics' second Finals series defeat, having previously lost to the St. Louis Hawks in 1958.\nTelevision coverage.\nThe Finals were telecast by CBS in the United States, with its coverage anchored by Brent Musburger. Dick Stockton did play-by-play with Tom Heinsohn as color analyst, working their second Finals together. Pat O'Brien worked sideline duties for both teams.\nCelebration.\nThe Lakers were invited to a reception at the White House with President Ronald Reagan, where Kareem Abdul-Jabbar presented the President with a jersey. The following Tuesday would be declared \"Laker Day\" by Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley with a parade beginning at 9th in Broadway.\nAftermath.\nAfter appearing in and winning both the 1981 and 1984 NBA Finals, this finals championship marked the first loss for the Larry Bird-led Celtics. Boston would appear in two more NBA Finals before the decade was over winning it all the next year (against Houston), only to lose in a rematch to the Lakers in 1987. It would take another 22 years before the Celtics would make another NBA Finals appearance again (which by that time the \"Big 3\" of Bird, Kevin McHale, and Robert Parish had long since retired) which they won against the Kobe Bryant-led Los Angeles Lakers in 6 games."

        "text": "The 1984 NBA Finals was the championship round of the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s 1983–84 season, and the culmination of the season's playoffs. The Eastern Conference champion Boston Celtics defeated the Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers in seven games. Celtics forward Larry Bird averaged 27 points and 14 rebounds a game during the series, earning the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP).\nThis series was a rematch of the Los Angeles Lakers and Boston Celtics after their rivalry was revived in 1979 with the Magic Johnson–Larry Bird pair entering the league. After alternating wins with the Lakers, the Celtics won Game 7 and the series with a score of 111–102.\nThis was the last NBA Finals to use the 2–2–1–1–1 format until 2014. The following year, the NBA Finals format was changed to 2–3–2 after Red Auerbach complained about the constant travelling during the Finals. Although the 2–2–1–1–1 format remained intact for the remainder of the playoff rounds, the 2–3–2 format would be used until 2013.\nBackground.\nThe seeds of the 1984 Finals were first sown five years earlier, during the 1979 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. In the final game of the tournament, Larry Bird and his erstwhile unbeaten Indiana State Sycamores lost to Magic Johnson and his Michigan State Spartans by the score of 75–64. After the tournament, both entered the NBA in the 1979–80 season with high expectations. Bird, who was selected 6th in the 1978 NBA draft but committed back to Indiana State for his senior season, was named Rookie of the Year after leading the Celtics to a 32-game turnaround from the previous year, going from 29 to 61 wins. The expected Celtics–Lakers finals, however, never happened. The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the Celtics in the conference finals before losing to the Lakers in the 1980 NBA Finals, with Johnson earning Finals MVP honors for his Game 6 performance. Since then Bird won a championship in 1981, then Magic led the Lakers to the finals in 1982 and 1983, winning in the former.\nBoston Celtics.\nIn the 1983–84 season, the Celtics won 62 games to lead the league. The Celtics were led by Bird, who won his first MVP award, and was complemented by 1981 Finals MVP Cedric Maxwell, first-time all-star and Sixth Man Award winner Kevin McHale, Robert Parish, Gerald Henderson and Danny Ainge. Boston's most crucial addition was Dennis Johnson, whom they acquired from the Phoenix Suns in the offseason in hopes of addressing their porous back-court defense.\nIn the playoffs, the Celtics defeated the Washington Bullets in four, the New York Knicks in seven, and the Milwaukee Bucks in five.\nLos Angeles Lakers.\nThe Lakers were coming off a four-game sweep by the Philadelphia 76ers in the previous year's finals. Before the season began, the Lakers traded long-time guard Norm Nixon to the San Diego Clippers in exchange for the draft rights to Byron Scott. The trade signaled a transition period, as some of the key players from the first two championships gave way to younger talent. Despite the changes, it did not stop the Lakers from finishing with the best record (54–28) in the Western Conference, powered by their one-two punch of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Magic Johnson.\nDuring the playoffs, the Lakers defeated the Kansas City Kings in three, the Dallas Mavericks in five, and the Phoenix Suns in six. However, the Lakers suffered a key injury when their 3rd leading scorer, Jamaal Wilkes (17 PPG) was ruled out of the finals. This cost the Lakers valuable depth, as James Worthy, a key contributor off the bench, would now have to start in Wilkes' place.\nRegular season series.\nThe Los Angeles Lakers won both games in the regular season series:\nSeries summary.\nGame 1.\nThe Lakers opened the series with a 115-109 victory at Boston Garden.\nGame 2.\nIn Game 2, the Lakers led 113-111 with 18 seconds left when Gerald Henderson stole a James Worthy pass to score a game tying layup. The Lakers then inbounded the ball and Magic Johnson inexplicably dribbled the clock out during regulation time. The Celtics eventually prevailed in overtime 124-121, thanks to Scott Wedman's game-winning shot from the baseline with 14 ticks left.\nGame 3.\nIn Game 3, the Lakers raced to an easy 137-104 victory as Magic Johnson dished out 21 assists, an NBA Finals record. After the game, Larry Bird said his team played like \"sissies\" in an attempt to light a fire under his teammates. It was Boston's worst playoff defeat in franchise history to that date.\nGame 4.\nIn Game 4, the Lakers had a five-point game lead with less than a minute to play, but made several execution errors, including Magic Johnson's bad pass to Robert Parish late in the fourth quarter, and missing two crucial free throws in OT as the Celtics tied the game and then came away with a 129-125 victory in overtime. Johnson was called \"Tragic Johnson\" by Celtics fans due to the two crucial errors he committed in Game 4 (the Parish steal, followed by two botched free throws in OT). The Lakers took an early lead in overtime, but a controversial foul call on Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, with 16 seconds remaining in regulation, had been his 6th foul, and he was out of the game. The Laker momentum was stalled, and Larry Bird came up with a crucial jumper over Magic Johnson with 16 seconds remaining in overtime, then M.L. Carr stole James Worthy's inbounds pass followed by a dunk to seal the win. The game was also marked by Celtic forward Kevin McHale's clothesline take-down of Laker forward Kurt Rambis on a breakaway layup which triggered the physical aspect of the rivalry. Larry Bird would go after Kareem Abdul-Jabbar later on in the third quarter, and 1981 Finals MVP Cedric Maxwell further antagonized the Lakers by following a missed James Worthy free throw by crossing the lane with his hands around his own neck, symbolizing that Worthy was \"choking\" under pressure. Also, Bird pushed Michael Cooper to the baseline following the inbound play during the second quarter.\nGame 4 of the 1984 Finals marked the last Finals game to go into overtime until Game 2 of the 1990 NBA Finals.\nGame 5.\nIn Game 5, the Celtics took a 3-2 series lead with a 121-103 victory, as Larry Bird scored 34 points and grabbed 17 rebounds. The game was known as the \"Heat Game\", as it was played under heat, and without any air conditioning, at Boston Garden. The Celtics did not warm up with their sweat pants on because of extreme heat, and an oxygen tank was provided to give air to an aging Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Referee Hugh Evans became dehydrated and fainted at one point in the first half. He worked the first half, but was replaced by John Vanak for the second half. It was also the last time that a team with home court advantage in the NBA finals played Game 5 on its own floor until 2014. The next year, the NBA Finals switched to the 2-3-2 format with Game 5 going to the team without home-court advantage, which continued through 2013.\nGame 6.\nIn Game 6, the Lakers evened the series with a 119-108 victory. In the game the Lakers answered the Celtics' rough tactics when Laker forward James Worthy shoved Cedric Maxwell into a basket support. After the game a Laker fan threw a beer at Celtics guard M.L. Carr as he left the floor, causing him to label the series \"all-out-war.\"\nGame 7.\nIn Game 7, the heat that was an issue in Game 5 was not as bad (indoor temperatures hovered around during the game, due to additional fans being brought in to try to cool the air). The Celtics were led by Cedric Maxwell who had 24 points, eight rebounds and eight assists as they came away with a 111-102 victory. In the game, the Lakers rallied to cut a 14-point-deficit to three with one minute remaining when Cedric Maxwell knocked the ball away from Magic Johnson. Dennis Johnson responded by sinking two free throws to seal the victory. Larry Bird was named MVP of the series.\nThe series was the eighth time in NBA history that the Celtics and Lakers met in the NBA finals, with Boston winning each time, and the first championship that the Celtics claimed at home since 1966.\nTelevision coverage.\nThe 1984 championship series scored high TV ratings. All the playoff action was documented on the 1984 NBA Season documentary \"Pride and Passion\", narrated by Dick Stockton. Stockton, the play-by-play announcer for the series, was joined by Tom Heinsohn, and the duo would call the next four NBA Finals until .\nAftermath.\nReflecting back on the series, Magic Johnson said \". . . (the Lakers) learned a valuable lesson. Only the strong survive. . . talent just don't get it. That's the first time the (80's) Lakers ever encountered that, someone stronger minded.\" The teams met again in the 1985 finals, which the Lakers won 4–2.\nIn 1986, they failed to meet in a third straight NBA Finals (it was later accomplished 31 years later by the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Golden State Warriors), as the Lakers were eliminated in the Conference Finals by the Houston Rockets. The Lakers and the Celtics met again in 1987 where the Lakers won in six games."

        "text": "The 1983 NBA World Championship Series, also known as Showdown '83, was the championship round of the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s 1982–83 season, and the culmination of the season's playoffs. It was the last NBA Championship Series completed before June 1. The Eastern Conference champion Philadelphia 76ers defeated the Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers four games to zero to win their third NBA championship. After their previous four final meetings, they beat the Lakers for the first time in NBA Finals history. 76ers center Moses Malone was named the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP). This, along with the 1989 NBA Finals, were the only two NBA championships of the 1980s not to be won by either the Lakers or the Boston Celtics; every NBA Finals of that decade featured either the Lakers or Celtics, and sometimes both (1984, 1985, 1987). Coincidentally, the Lakers were also swept in the 1989 NBA Finals, that time by the Detroit Pistons.\nBackground.\nPhiladelphia 76ers.\nThe 76ers lost their first two Finals meetings with the Lakers in and . While Julius Erving played superbly in both series, their frontcourt of Darryl Dawkins, Caldwell Jones, and Bobby Jones couldn't neutralize Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. So in the off-season, the 76ers acquired Moses Malone from the Houston Rockets in an effort to counter Abdul-Jabbar, in addition to providing some offense and rebounding to the team. They parted ways with Caldwell Jones, Dawkins, and Lionel Hollins before the season, while giving greater responsibility to high-scoring guard Andrew Toney and backup playmaker Clint Richardson, and adding forwards Clemon Johnson and rookie Marc Iavaroni.\nMalone's acquisition paid dividends, as the 76ers won 65 games in the 1982–83 NBA season. Prior to the playoffs, Malone predicted the team would win in four games in each of the three rounds, ending it with the statement \"Fo, Fo, Fo\". The 76ers would steamroll through the playoffs, sweeping the New York Knicks 4–0 in the conference semifinals, before overcoming the Milwaukee Bucks in five games.\nLos Angeles Lakers.\nThe Lakers earned the top pick of the 1982 NBA draft, becoming the only defending champion to earn the top overall pick in the same season. This was because Cleveland Cavaliers owner Ted Stepien traded their first round pick and Butch Lee to the Lakers for Don Ford and draft pick Chad Kinch three years earlier. Because the Cavaliers earned the worst record at 15–67, they would have earned the top overall pick via a coin toss with the 17–65 San Diego Clippers. Instead, the Lakers would earn the top pick and ultimately selected future Hall of Famer James Worthy first overall.\nThe Lakers won 58 games the next season. Worthy was a strong contender for Rookie of the Year when he broke his leg late in the season, therefore missing the rest of the season and the playoffs. Despite Worthy's absence, Magic Johnson, already a top-level guard, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, 35 and still in his prime, led the Lakers back to the Finals. They beat the Portland Trail Blazers 4–1 and the San Antonio Spurs 4–2 in the second and third playoff rounds, respectively.\nRegular season series.\nThe Philadelphia 76ers won both games in the regular season series:\nSeries summary.\nThe final piece of the Philadelphia 76ers' championship puzzle was completed before the 1982–83 season when they acquired center Moses Malone from the Houston Rockets. They went on to capture their third NBA championship as they won 65 games, and stormed through the playoffs, first sweeping the New York Knicks, and then beating the Milwaukee Bucks in five games. They finally finished it off with a four-game sweep of the Los Angeles Lakers, who had defeated them the season before.\nSaid head coach Billy Cunningham, \"The difference from last year was Moses.\" Malone was named MVP of the 1983 Finals, as well as league MVP for the third time in his career. The 76ers completed one of the most dominating playoff runs in league history with a 12–1 mark after league and NBA Finals MVP Moses promised \"Fo', fo', fo\" (as in \"four, four, four\"—four wins to win round 1, four wins to win round 2, etc.), but it actually wound up as \"Fo', fi', fo.\" (four, five, four). The 76ers were also led by Julius Erving, Maurice Cheeks, Andrew Toney, and Bobby Jones.\nWith 59 seconds to go in Game 4, it was Erving who made a three-point play to hold the lead for good, crushing the Lakers in a four-game sweep and ending the last NBA Finals to end before June.\nUntil the Phillies won the 2008 World Series over the Tampa Bay Rays 4-1, this was the last time a team from Philadelphia in the Big Four leagues won their league's championship.\nTelevision coverage.\nThe 1983 NBA Finals was broadcast by CBS. Dick Stockton and Bill Russell were the commentators and Brent Musburger was the host, with Kevin Loughery as a pre-game, halftime and post-game analyst. It also introduced a new theme music (composed by Allyson Bellink) for the CBS Sports coverage of the NBA, used an introduction of the NBA arenas (similar to the Boston Garden) until the 1989 Playoffs and later revived the second theme beginning in the 1989 Finals.\nRussell departed CBS following the series, and was replaced by former Celtics teammate Tom Heinsohn. Russell would later resurface as a color analyst on TBS until 1986."

        "text": "The 1982 NBA World Championship Series was the championship round of the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s 1981–82 season, the top level of competition in men's professional basketball in North America. The series saw the Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers face the Eastern Conference champion Philadelphia 76ers. It was a rematch of the 1980 NBA Finals. The Lakers won 4 games to 2.\nThe 1982 NBA Finals documentary \"Something to Prove\" recaps all the action of this series. It was the last NBA video documentary to exclusively use film in all on-court action. Dick Stockton narrated the documentary, with the condensed USA Network version narrated by Al Albert.\nThis was the first Finals to be claimed on the winning team's home court since 1977. The series ended June 8, later than any previous NBA Finals. The previous record was June 7, 1978. This record was eclipsed two years later when the finals ended on June 12, 1984.\nBackground.\nLos Angeles Lakers.\nThe Lakers were stunned in the 1981 NBA Playoffs by the Houston Rockets in a 3-game mini-series. The previous season saw the Lakers in a state of uncertainty, after Magic Johnson missed 45 games due to a knee injury. Their problems continued early in the new season, and with the team at 7–4 the Lakers decided to fire head coach Paul Westhead. Taking over as head coach was Pat Riley, and his promotion to the job led to the birth of the Showtime offense.\nWith a healthy Johnson and the additions of Kurt Rambis and Bob McAdoo, the Lakers rallied to finish with a 57–25 record, best in the Western Conference. They were even more flawless in the playoffs as they both swept the Phoenix Suns in the Western Conference Semifinals, and the San Antonio Spurs in the Western Conference Finals.\nPhiladelphia 76ers.\nLike the Lakers, the 76ers were coming off a heartbreaking playoff defeat, as they blew a 3–1 lead and lost to the eventual champion Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference finals. Not much was changed for the 76ers roster-wise and record-wise in the new season, however, as the team finished second behind the Celtics in the Atlantic Division for the third straight year.\nDue to a then-existing rule where division winners would earn a first-round bye, the 76ers were forced to play a best-of-three miniseries, even though their 58–24 record was three games better than the Central Division champion Milwaukee Bucks. Nevertheless, Philadelphia easily swept the Atlanta Hawks 2–0 in the first round, then ousted the Bucks in the next round 4–2. In the Eastern Conference finals, the 76ers blew out the Celtics twice at The Spectrum to take a 3–1 lead, only to lose the next two games in a harrowing replay of the 1981 playoffs. But led by Andrew Toney's 34 points, the 76ers exorcised the demons of 1981 by blowing out the Celtics 120–106 in Game 7. As time wound down, the Boston Garden crowd began to chant \"Beat L.A.!\", encouraging the 76ers to defeat the hated Lakers in the championship round.\nRegular season series.\nBoth teams split the two meetings, each won by the home team:\nGame summaries.\nGame 1.\nFresh from holding off the Celtics in the conference finals, the Sixers worked their offense to precision and held a 15-point lead midway through the third quarter 83-68. But, then, the Lakers began to turn it up on defense and the result was many fast breaks. The Lakers went on a 40–9 run over the game's next 11 minutes. Wilkes scored 10, Kareem and McAdoo scored 8 each, Nixon and Cooper scored 7 each, and Nixon had 4 assists during the run, on the way to a 124-117 Game 1 win, thereby stealing the home-court advantage.\nAfter the game, Sixers coach Billy Cunningham commented that the Sixers weren't affected that much by the trapping Laker defense, just cold shooting and sloppy play. However, he also questioned whether or not it was a \"zone defense\", which was illegal at the time.\nGame 2.\nIn this game, Laker coach Pat Riley took a different defensive approach, assigning Magic Johnson to cover Julius Erving straight-up on defense. While Magic couldn't match the Doctor's athleticism, the move did keep Erving from the offensive boards.\nIn Game 2 that wasn't quite enough, as Erving brought the Sixers back with 24 points and 16 rebounds, mostly defensive. Billy Cunningham used all his centers, Caldwell Jones, Darryl Dawkins and Earl Cureton at different points to guard Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The Sixers got 38 offensive rebounds for 50 second-chance points, while the Lakers only had six offensive boards.\nThe Sixers used that advantage to take a 110–94 win that evened the series. In a balanced scoring attack, Maurice Cheeks had 19 points and eight assists, Jones added 12 points and 11 rebounds, and Bobby Jones and Clint Richardson each scored 10. This was the Lakers first loss in the 1982 post season.\nGame 3.\nBack at home at The Forum, the Lakers completely dominated Game 3. Norm Nixon scored 29 points as the Lakers marched to a 129–108 victory. Andrew Toney scored 36 and Julius Erving 21, but no one else came through.\nGame 4.\nThe Lakers controlled the tempo in Game 4 by going to their half-court game, passing down low to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. On the defensive end, they kept up the pressure with their zone trap. The Lakers went up, three games to one, with a 111–101 win. Jamaal Wilkes and Magic Johnson had 24 points each, while Abdul-Jabbar added 22 and Bob McAdoo 19 off the bench. Hard-charging bruiser Kurt Rambis pulled down 11 rebounds, matching Abdul-Jabbar's output.\nGame 5.\nBack in Philadelphia, the Sixers took out their frustrations and destroyed the Lakers, 135–102. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was held to just six points, a career playoff low, thanks to the spirited defense of Darryl Dawkins. In the midst of the offensive explosion, Dawkins also contributed 20 points and seven rebounds to the effort.\nThis was the Lakers' most lopsided playoff defeat up to this time. It was eclipsed when they were routed 148-114 by the Celtics in Game 1 of the 1985 Finals. Coincidentally, the Lakers also won that series in six games despite the blowout loss.\nGame 6.\nThe Sixers' strong showing in Game 5 gave them hope for Game 6 in the Forum, but the Lakers got the early lead and were up, 66–57, at the half.\nIn the third period, the Sixers' defense turned it up a notch. They held Los Angeles to 20 points for the quarter and several times cut the lead to one point. Super-sub Bob McAdoo, known more for his offense, made a key defensive play late in the third when he blocked a Julius Erving layup on a breakaway that would have given the Sixers the lead.\nThe Lakers came back and surged early in the fourth period to boost their lead to 11. Erving, who led all scorers with 30 points, and Andrew Toney, who had 29, responded by trimming the lead to 103–100 with about four minutes left, but then Kareem Abdul-Jabbar scored and was fouled and made the free throw to put Los Angeles up by six. Moments later, Wilkes got a breakaway layup to close it out, 114–104.\nJamaal Wilkes led the Lakers with 27 points, and Magic Johnson, with 13 points, 13 rebounds and 13 assists, was named the series MVP. McAdoo, who had 16 points, nine rebounds and three blocks, was pretty much reborn as a player in this series after being cast off by several teams as a selfish, non-team player.\nAside from the Doctor's and Toney's efforts, no one else stepped up for the Sixers. Darryl Dawkins fouled out and only had 10 points and one rebound in 20 minutes played. Dawkins would soon be shipped to the New Jersey Nets, and the 76ers acquired the final piece of their championship puzzle: Moses Malone, an MVP center from the Houston Rockets.\nTelevision coverage.\nUnlike previous years, where weeknight games were shown on tape delay, all games in the Finals were televised live by CBS. As a compromise to CBS to allow the live telecasts, the NBA returned the start of its season to late October after starting it earlier in October the previous two seasons, meaning the finals would start after the conclusion of the mid-May sweeps period. The later date also eliminated the back-to-back games on Mother's Day weekend, which was used in 1980 and 1981 to avert another tape delay broadcast.\nThis was also the first of nine straight NBA finals (1982-1990) that Dick Stockton would call for CBS Sports. Stockton also announced the starting lineups of the 1982 NBA Finals in lieu of P.A. announcers Dave Zinkoff (for the 76ers) and Larry McKay (for the Lakers; McKay would be replaced the next season by Lawrence Tanter).\nAftermath.\nBoth teams would meet in the Finals again in 1983. The Sixers, bolstered by the addition of league MVP Moses Malone, won 65 games, and steamrolled through the playoffs, in which they lost only once (completing Malone's famous \"Fo, Fo, Fo\" prediction, stating that the Sixers needed to win 4 games in each of the three series) in route to their third NBA title overall (they won in 1955 as the Syracuse Nationals, and in 1967). The Lakers finished the regular season with 58 wins, but were overmatched by the hungrier Sixers in the Finals. Then-rookie and future Hall of Famer James Worthy did not play in the series because of a late-season leg injury."

        "text": "The 1981 NBA World Championship Series was the championship round of the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s 1980–81 season, and the culmination of the season's playoffs. It pitted the 62–20 Eastern Conference champion Boston Celtics against the 40–42 Western Conference champion Houston Rockets. This series has the distinction of featuring for the third time in NBA history, and last to date, a team with a losing record in the Finals. They were the first team since the Minneapolis Lakers in 1959 to reach the championship round despite having more regular season losses than wins. This, along with 1986 (which was also played by the Celtics and the Rockets), was one of the only two NBA championships of the 1980s not to feature the Lakers.\nBackground.\nHouston Rockets.\nPrior to the season, the NBA moved the Rockets and San Antonio Spurs from the Central Division of the Eastern Conference to the Midwest Division of the Western Conference. The Rockets and Spurs traded places with the Chicago Bulls and Milwaukee Bucks. The Midwest Division also took in the expansion Dallas Mavericks.\nThe Rockets that season were led by Moses Malone, who practically carried the Rockets to the NBA Finals. Meanwhile, Calvin Murphy, the shortest player in the league at the time, set two NBA records, sinking 78 consecutive free throws to break Rick Barry's mark of 60 set in and achieving a free-throw percentage of .958, breaking Rick Barry's record set with the Rockets in . Other key contributors of the 1980–81 team were Rudy Tomjanovich, Robert Reid, Mike Dunleavy Sr., Allen Leavell, Billy Paultz, Bill Willoughby, Calvin Garrett, Tom Henderson, and Major Jones. The Rockets clinched the last spot in the playoffs on the final night of the regular season following a loss by the Golden State Warriors to Seattle, as Golden State had the tiebreaker over Houston. Houston tied with Kansas City for second place in the Midwest behind San Antonio with a regular season record of 40–42 (this would be only the second time that an NBA team with a losing record would make the Finals, after 1959).\nHouston's playoff run began by drawing the defending NBA champion Los Angeles Lakers and Magic Johnson in the first round. The Rockets upset Los Angeles, two games to one, with the Rockets winning both games in Los Angeles. The Western Conference Semifinals matchup featured the Rockets against the Spurs and multi-year scoring champion George Gervin in a Texas Shootout. The Rockets would win the series in seven games behind strong contributions from Murphy and Reid, including Murphy's career playoff high of 42 points in the climactic Game 7 at San Antonio. This set up an unlikely Conference Finals matchup with Kansas City, being that both teams finished the regular season with identical losing records, together compiling just 80 total victories of 164 games played. The Kings, led by Otis Birdsong, Scott Wedman, and Phil Ford fell to the Rockets in five games, and the Rockets would break into the NBA Finals for the first time, the first of four in franchise history. It would be the only time two conference finalists in the playoffs both had losing records, and the second and last time to date a team with a losing record made it all the way to the Finals round (the first being the 1959 Minneapolis Lakers).\nBoston Celtics.\nThis was the Celtics' first appearance in The Finals since their 1976 championship winning team against the Phoenix Suns. The Celtics were not quite the same team as five years before, as they added the likes of Larry Bird, Robert Parish, and Kevin McHale, a trio that would come to be known as \"The Big Three.\" M. L. Carr, Cedric Maxwell, and Nate Archibald were also capable players off the bench, and key cogs in Boston's balanced offensive attack. However, the Celtics lost future Hall of Famers Dave Cowens and JoJo White to retirement. Still, the Celtics, led by Bird, won 62 games and managed to squeak past Philadelphia for the league's best record due to tiebreakers.\nThe Celtics's playoff run started with a first-round bye, straight into the conference semifinals. Despite the layoff, the Celtics easily swept the Artis Gilmore-led Chicago Bulls, and then faced the defending Eastern Conference champion Philadelphia 76ers for the right to advance to The Finals. After a hard-fought and physical series, the Celtics eventually came back from a three-games-to-one deficit to defeat the Sixers, repeating a feat they accomplished in 1968. Five of the games in the series ended with the winning team on top by two points or less, including a 91-90 nail-biter in Game 7.\nBoth teams had met in the playoffs the year earlier, when the Rockets were in their final season in the Eastern Conference. The 1980 Eastern Conference Semifinal matchup had a slightly different Celtics team, with Hall of Fame center Dave Cowens still playing for the team, as well not featuring perennial stars Kevin McHale and Robert Parish, both of whom would not arrive in Boston until the 1981 season. Rick Barry for Houston was also in the final season of his career in 1980. The Celtics blew out the Rockets in a four-game sweep, by a total of 74 points in the 1980 Eastern Conference Semis.\nRoad to the Finals.\n(*)The Celtics were tied with the Philadelphia 76ers for the NBA's best record, but the Celtics earned the division title and the overall top seed based on tie-breakers.\nRegular season series.\nThe Boston Celtics won both games in the regular season series:\nGame summaries.\nGame 1.\nNo one figured this series to be much of a Finals. Houston, in fact, had lost its previous dozen games to the Celtics, including a 4–0 series sweep in the previous years' playoffs. But Malone, who had averaged nearly 28 points and 15 rebounds over the season, would have none of the \"Boston Curse\". He came into the series fired up, going so far as to call the Celtics \"chumps\". The Celtics, meanwhile, were coming off three close games in the Eastern Conference Finals in upsetting the heavily favored Philadelphia 76ers. So, the Celtics were understandably flat.\nHouston led 57–51 at the half and kept that intensity through the game. Late in the fourth period, with the Celtics trailing 87–84, Bird put up an 18-footer from the right side. As soon as he turned it loose, he immediately rushed in for the rebound. He caught the ball in midair as his momentum was carrying him out of bounds on the baseline just right of the lane. In an instant, he switched the ball to his left hand (a right-handed shot would have hit the side of the backboard) and flipped it in the basket. Bird would finish with 18 points, 21 rebounds, and nine assists. Moses Malone would grab 15 rebounds, but was held to 13 points.\nThe crowd went nuts over Bird's shot, with general manager Red Auerbach leading the cheers. Bill Russell, who was broadcasting the game for CBS, looked on in disbelief.\n\"Larry was able to make the play\", said Russell, \"because he not only knew where the ball was going to land, he knew that he knew.\"\nThe shot carried Boston to a 98–95 win and Auerbach proclaimed, \"It was one of the best shots I've ever seen a player make.\"\nGame 2.\nMalone would come up big in this game, scoring 31 points and pulling down another 15 boards. Bill Willoughby would add 14 off the bench to make up for poor shooting by Robert Reid (0 for 7) and Calvin Murphy (4 for 13). Reserve guard Allen Leavell's late basket would give the Rockets the 92–90 victory. Bird would lead the Celtics once again with 19 points and 21 rebounds. The victory was Houston's eighth road win of the playoffs, a record that stood until the 1995 Rockets won nine playoff games en route to winning the championship.\nGame 3.\nWith the series back in Houston, Robert Reid, matched up with Larry Bird, would begin to garner attention for his defense on the Celtics star, holding him to three baskets and eight points. But, the Celtics would not need Bird's scoring in this one. The Rockets shot a paltry 3 for 17 in the second quarter, fell behind by 17, and never recovered.\nCedric Maxwell led six Celtics in double figures with 19 points. His teammates, meanwhile, played some pretty good defense of their own, holding the Rockets to 71 points, the lowest output for an NBA team in a Finals game since the Syracuse Nationals scored 71 in the 1955 NBA Finals (which was, incidentally, the year the shot clock was introduced). The record low stood until it was embarrassingly shattered by the Utah Jazz in Game 3 of the 1998 Finals when they lost 96–54 to Chicago Bulls.\nGame 4.\nReid continued his air-tight defense on Bird, holding him to another eight points, while scoring 19 himself. The star of this game was Mike Dunleavy, Sr., who had 28 points. Malone would add 24 points and 22 rebounds as the Rockets tied the series. Another key was the Rockets' relentless offensive rebounding and second-chance opportunities; they grabbed 28 offensive rebounds (Reid had 10 and Malone nine with four put-back dunks) on the way to out-shooting the Celtics in attempts, 103 to 74.\nGame 5.\nThe Rockets had a losing regular season record at 40–42, but, up to Game 5, they showed they definitely belonged in the finals with the Celtics. So, no one could blame Moses Malone for doing some trash-talking. Earlier, he had simply declared, \"Boston ain't that good.\" Before Game 5, though, Malone went a little too far, saying, \"I could get four guys off the street in Petersburg (Virginia, Malone's hometown) and beat them.\" This was all coach Bill Fitch would need to motivate his troops.\nWith Bird still struggling offensively, Cedric Maxwell shouldered the load, scoring 28 points and pulling down 15 rebounds and sparking several fast breaks to a Celtics rout, 109–80.\nThe infamous on-air incident between Rick Barry and Bill Russell occurred early in the third quarter of this game.\nGame 6.\nMotivated from Malone's previous barbs, the Celtics took it right to the Rockets back at The Summit, leading 84–67 in the final period. However, as coach Fitch looked on in disgust, the Celtics went five minutes without a basket as the Rockets, led by Calvin Garrett, reeled off 13 unanswered points in a furious comeback and eventually cut the lead to only three, with the Houston crowd erupting louder after each basket. Larry Bird then finally broke out of his shooting doldrums to personally blunt the Rockets' rally. Bird hit a 15-foot jumper, fed series MVP Maxwell for a basket, and hit a back-breaking, 24-foot, three-point shot to put the Rockets away for good and send Boston to its 14th NBA Championship, and at last a championship ring for 11-year veteran Nate Archibald."

        "text": "The 1980 NBA World Championship Series was the championship round of the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s 1979–80 season, and the conclusion of the season's playoffs. The Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Eastern Conference champion Philadelphia 76ers 4 games to 2 to win their seventh championship.\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar was the league's MVP, but midway through Game 5, the Lakers center suffered a severely sprained ankle. He managed to come back in the game in the fourth quarter to lead the Lakers to victory and a 3–2 lead in the best-of-seven series. But the Lakers still had to travel to Philadelphia for Game 6. Abdul-Jabbar was listed as out of Game 6, although 76ers coach Billy Cunningham was quoted as saying \"I won't believe he's not playing until their plane lands and he's not on it.\" As it turned out, Kareem did not make the trip and was listed as doubtful if Game 7 had been needed.\nIn Game 6, Magic Johnson played what may have been the greatest game of his career. Playing on the road, Johnson (a 6'9\" rookie point guard) started the game at center and eventually played all five positions in a dominating performance. Scoring a game-high 42 points and grabbing a game-high 15 rebounds—and handing out seven assists— Johnson led the Lakers to the NBA crown. The Lakers also received strong performances from Jamaal Wilkes with 37 points and 10 rebounds, and Norm Nixon. Jim Chones played strong defense on 76ers center Darryl Dawkins, while Mark Landsberger provided rebounding off the bench, and little used Brad Holland chipped in eight key points.\nMagic Johnson's performance in Game 6 and the series earned him the 1980 NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP). What made Johnson's performance even more remarkable was that he was an NBA rookie—and, indeed, one who had left college after only two years, and was only 20 years old. \"Jamaal Wilkes had an unbelievable game\", said Johnson in 2011. \"Everybody talked about my 42 points, but it was also his 37-point effort.\"\nIn Game 4 of the 1980 Finals, Julius Erving executed the legendary Baseline Move, a behind-the-board reverse layup that seemed to defy gravity. Play-by-play announcer Brent Musburger has noted that Erving made such moves almost routinely in his ABA days—but the ABA had no national TV contract in those days. This Game 4 move, played to a national audience in a title game, has probably become Julius Erving's most famous move.\nThis was also the first NBA Finals to make use of the three-point line, which debuted that season.\nMany consider this victory as the birth of Showtime.\nBackground.\nLos Angeles Lakers.\nThe last time the Lakers had won the NBA championship was in 1972. In the eight years between championships, the Lakers made the NBA Finals again in 1973 and lost to the New York Knicks in five games. Then Wilt Chamberlain and Jerry West retired, and the Lakers missed the playoffs in 1975 and 1976. In between, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was acquired, and the Lakers returned to prominence in 1977, but Kareem couldn't do it alone.\nThe Lakers earned the top pick of the 1979 NBA draft (traded as compensation by the New Orleans Jazz after signing Gail Goodrich in 1976) and selected Magic Johnson from Michigan State. It was one of then-owner Jack Kent Cooke's final acts before selling the team to Jerry Buss during that summer. While Magic dazzled in his rookie season, Kareem would enjoy an MVP campaign in the Lakers' 60–22 regular season. The Lakers began the season being coached by Jack McKinney as owner Jerry Buss, who had recently acquired the team, wanted games to be entertaining, and hired the coach to install a running offense. On November 8, 1979, the Lakers were 9–4 after 13 games, when McKinney suffered a near fatal head injury after falling while bicycling. Assistant coach Paul Westhead, who also worked under McKinney at St. Joseph's, was named the interim head coach. However, the length of the recovery and lingering doubts about the complete return of McKinney's mental faculties, combined with the team's level of success under Westhead, ultimately meant that McKinney would never get the chance to return to the job. Westhead continued to use McKinney's offense, a creative and spontaneous offense that came to be known as Showtime, and the team finished the season with a record of 60–22. The Lakers advanced to that year's NBA Finals and McKinney was fired by Buss mid-series on May 13, 1980. After the Lakers won the series for their first of five NBA titles in nine seasons, Buss hired Westhead to permanently replace McKinney, who was hired by the Indiana Pacers as successor to Slick Leonard.\nBehind Johnson's passing, Abdul-Jabbar's post play and Michael Cooper's perimeter shooting and defense, the trio formed the core of the Lakers' Showtime-era teams. The chemistry between the three was evident early on, as the Lakers eliminated the Phoenix Suns and defending champions Seattle SuperSonics in a pair of five-game playoff series to advance to the NBA Finals.\nPhiladelphia 76ers.\nJulius Erving arrived before the 1976–77 season, and with him as the focal point of the offense, the 76ers soon transformed into a title contender. But after losing to the Portland Trail Blazers in the 1977 NBA Finals, the 76ers realized that a fancy and one-on-one style of play would not take them all the way. Thus they hired former player Billy Cunningham as head coach, and in 1978 the team traded for defensive stalwart Bobby Jones and drafted Maurice Cheeks, while letting go players such as George McGinnis and World B. Free.\nIn the 1979–80 season the 76ers finished 59–23, two games behind the Boston Celtics in the Atlantic Division. In the playoffs, they eliminated the Washington Bullets in two games, and the Atlanta Hawks in five games. In the Eastern Conference Finals, the 76ers faced NBA Rookie of the Year Award winner Larry Bird and the 61–win Celtics, and owing to the core's three consecutive playoff appearances, the more experienced 76ers were favored to win the series. Proving the prognosticators right, Philadelphia won in five games, preventing the first Celtics–Lakers final since 1969.\nThe 76ers were the first of the four Philadelphia professional sports teams to play for their respective sports' championships in the 1980 season. The Flyers lost the Stanley Cup Finals against the New York Islanders in overtime of Game 6, eight days after the 76ers fell to the Lakers in their Game 6. The Phillies beat the Kansas City Royals, themselves in six games, in the World Series. The Eagles lost Super Bowl XV to the Oakland Raiders in January 1981.\nOf note, this marked the first of the ten NBA Finals played in the 1980s, all of which featured either the Boston Celtics or the Los Angeles Lakers (three Finals featured both teams).\nRegular season series.\nBoth teams split the two meetings, each won by the home team:\nGame summaries.\nGame 1.\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar, playing on a mission and finally with an effective supporting cast around him, scored 33 points, pulled down 14 rebounds, and had six blocks and five assists on the way to a 109–102 win in the Forum. Norm Nixon had 23 points and Jamaal Wilkes finished with 20 while the Lakers did an excellent job double-teaming Julius Erving. Rookie Magic Johnson contributed 16 points, 10 assists and 9 rebounds.\nGame 2.\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar continued to dominate, with 38 points in Game 2. But, this time, he got very little help as the Laker break never got going.\nJulius Erving scored 12 points in the first quarter on his way to 23, beginning the game with a dunk over Abdul-Jabbar. Maurice Cheeks matched Erving's total of 23 points, while Bobby Jones added 13 off the bench. The key was Darryl Dawkins, who had one of his best games of the season by scoring 25 points, many of them on outside shots trying to draw Abdul-Jabbar away from the basket.\nThe Sixers led by as much as 20 in the fourth period, but the Lakers roared back, trimming the lead to 105–104 late in the game. Then, Jones popped in a jumper with seven seconds left, and that was enough for a 107–104 Philly win that tied the series at a game apiece.\nGame 3.\nWith a split in L.A., the Sixers were hoping to take command of the series with the next two games in Philadelphia. The Lakers, however, ended those hopes by taking a 15-point lead in the first quarter. Julius Erving led a short comeback in the second, but a 9–0 run by the Lakers extended their lead to 14 at the half.\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar once again had a big game with 33 points, 14 rebounds, four blocks and three assists as the Lakers cruised to a 111–101 win. Julius Erving scored the only three-pointer of the series (and first in NBA Finals history) in this game.\nGame 4.\nThis game was a nip-and-tuck affair that was highlighted by Julius Erving's signature \"Baseline Move\" in the fourth quarter. The Sixers went on to even the series with a 105–102 win. Darryl Dawkins led the Sixers with 26 points and Erving added 23.\nGame 5.\nBack at the Forum, the Lakers held a two-point lead late in the third quarter when Kareem Abdul-Jabbar stepped on Lionel Hollins' foot as he was running upcourt after a Laker basket and twisted his ankle. At that point, Kareem had scored 26 points and was carrying the Lakers, but now he was in the locker room. Magic Johnson then asserted himself by scoring six points and added an assist as Los Angeles moved up by eight at the end of the third.\nAbdul-Jabbar then limped back onto the floor. His appearance aroused the Forum regulars and, despite the bad ankle, scored 11 points and had two key blocked shots down the stretch. The Sixers, however, had Julius Erving who scored 11 of the Sixers last 13 points to complete an 8-point comeback, and tie the game at 103–103 with only 43 seconds remaining.\nOn the Lakers possession, Darryl Dawkins was trying to front Abdul-Jabbar but to no avail as Magic threw a pass overhead so only Erving stood between Kareem and the basket. Abdul-Jabbar, bad ankle and all, dunked emphatically over Erving and drew the foul with 33 seconds left. He converted the 3-point play to take a 106–103 lead.\nAfter a timeout, the Sixers put the ball in the hands of Erving, who tried a spectacular, scooping finger-roll, but missed. Magic got the rebound to seemingly seal the win, but the Lakers tried to force the fast-break and ended up turning the ball over, out-of-bounds. However, the Sixers turned the ball right back over by stepping out of bounds on a desperation 3-point attempt. Norm Nixon would finally seal the game at the foul line by making both of his foul shots. The victory gave the Lakers the crucial 3–2 series lead heading back to Philadelphia.\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar's 14 point 4th quarter on a bad ankle capped an overall 40-point performance. After Game 5 Abdul-Jabbar was averaging 33.4 points per game as compared to eventual MVP Magic Johnson's 17.4.\nGame 6.\nThe Lakers' team doctors declared Abdul-Jabbar and his bad ankle unfit for Game 6 (he wasn't even allowed to make the trip to Philadelphia with the team because of the swelling), so Laker coach Paul Westhead made a bold move by asking Magic Johnson to jump center. Johnson had no problem and was up to the challenge, although he would lose the famous opening tip to Caldwell Jones. Early on, the Sixers seemed unsure how to counter the matchup problem. The Lakers went up 7–0, then 11–4. Finally, the Sixers used their newfound size advantage in the second quarter to take a 52–44 lead. The Lakers countered by collapsing more in the paint and rallied for a 60–60 tie at the half.\nLos Angeles opened the third period with a 14–0 run, keyed by Jamaal Wilkes, who had 16 points in the quarter. In the fourth with a little over five minutes left, the Sixers rallied to cut the Laker lead to 103–101. After a timeout, the Lakers went on one last run, with Magic scoring nine points down the stretch on the way to a final 123–107 margin.\nWilkes had a career-high 37 points and added 10 rebounds. Jim Chones effectively shut down the middle in place of Abdul-Jabbar and finished with 11 points and 10 rebounds, and held Darryl Dawkins to 14 points and a scant four rebounds. Michael Cooper, in a rare start, scored 16 points, and Mark Landsberger contributed 10 boards.\nMagic Johnson scored 42 points, including all 14 of his free-throw attempts. He added 15 rebounds, seven assists, three steals and a block and was elected MVP of the series. \"It was amazing, just amazing\", said Erving, who led Philly with 27 points.\nTelevision coverage.\nThe series-deciding Game 6 became the most notorious example of CBS's practice of showing even the most important NBA games on \"tape delay\" broadcasts. Because May 16, 1980, was a Friday, the network did not want to preempt its two highest-rated shows, \"The Dukes of Hazzard\" and \"Dallas\", even though both shows were already in reruns: the 1979–80 TV season had ended early, back in March (\"Dukes\" and \"Dallas\" both aired their season finale March 21), in anticipation of a strike that summer by the Screen Actors Guild. So Game 6 was shown at 11:30pm Eastern (10:30pm Central) in all but eight US cities: Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Portland, Las Vegas, Seattle, San Francisco, Sacramento and Reno, who carried it live; all but Philadelphia are located in the Pacific Time Zone, thus could show the game live at 6 p.m. local time, then carry CBS's prime time lineup, delayed by a few minutes for the ending of the game. In Atlanta, the CBS affiliate didn't show Game 6 at all, bumping it to independent station WATL-TV, who at least carried the contest live. (This is often cited as an example of TV's lack of interest in the NBA in the \"pre-Magic and Bird\" era.)\nHad Game 7 been played, it would have tipped off at noon Pacific (3 p.m. Eastern).\nThe 1980 Finals would mark the last play-by-play assignment for Brent Musburger, who was joined on color commentary by Utah Jazz play-by-play announcer Hot Rod Hundley and Boston Celtics legend Bill Russell. Musburger would remain involved with CBS' NBA coverage until 1989, but his duties for later NBA Finals were as a studio host, though he continued to call play-by-play on various occasions. Musburger later called NBA Finals games from to for ESPN Radio."

        "text": "The Basketball Diaries is a 1995 American biographical crime drama film. The movie deals with drug addiction and its unfavorable outcome in lives of common people. Directed by Scott Kalvert in his feature directorial debut and based on an autobiographical novel by the same name written by Jim Carroll. It tells the story of Carroll's teenage years as a promising high school basketball player and writer who develops an addiction to heroin. Distributed by New Line Cinema, \"The Basketball Diaries\" stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Carroll, along with Bruno Kirby, Lorraine Bracco, Ernie Hudson, Patrick McGaw, James Madio, Michael Imperioli, and Mark Wahlberg in supporting roles.\n\"The Basketball Diaries\" premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 27, 1995. The film was widely released in theaters on April 21, 1995, to mixed reviews and grossed $2.4 million at the box office.\nPlot.\nTeenager Jim Carroll is a drug-addicted high school basketball player who regularly gets into mischief with his friends Pedro, Mickey, and Neutron on the streets of New York City and at school. Outside of basketball, Jim shows an artistic interest in writing; keeping his work in his journal while expressing his thoughts and creating poetry. \nJim's best friend, Bobby, is dying of leukemia. Jim frequently visits him in the hospital. Later, after a trip to a strip show cut short by an annoyed Bobby, he dies, and Jim and his friends attend his funeral days later. Following the funeral, Jim and his friends go to the basketball court and reminisce about Bobby's life. Depressed over Bobby's death, Jim begins to use heroin.\nAt basketball practice, Jim's coach Swifty sees Jim in the bathroom showers when he takes a short break to get high, where he then gropes him and offers to pay him for sex. Jim refuses and pushes Swifty headfirst into a wall. As Jim's frustrations with school and life grow over time, he imagines shooting his classmates. The next day, before a game, Jim, Pedro, and Mickey take pills from Pedro's hat, hoping they are uppers. Neutron refuses the pills and confronts Jim about his growing habit. The pills are downers, and they cause the boys to perform disastrously during the game. Father McNulty, who notices the boys engaging in drug use, tells Jim and Mickey that they are suspended for a week, while Swifty tells Jim that he is now banned from playing basketball for his school again. Jim and Mickey, in response, resign from the team and drop out of school, while Neutron stays on.\nAfter exposing his stash of drugs, Jim's religious mother disowns him and exiles a depressed Jim out of their apartment. Jim, Mickey, and Pedro from then on only live for their next score as homeless addicts; one later excursion has them break into a candy shop for money. Mickey finds a gun in the cash register and takes it. Hearing sirens, Jim and Mickey escape, but Pedro, too high and hungover to realize the situation, is left behind and arrested. Jim continues a desperate life of shady dealings and getting high with Mickey, and by the coming winter, passes out in the snow high on heroin. Jim's friend Reggie, who sympathizes with Jim over his predicament having been in a similar situation, finds him, takes him to his apartment, and forces him to detox, but Jim relapses.\nBack on the street, Jim is desperate for more drugs and resorts to prostituting himself at a public restroom. Later, Jim and Mickey buy heroin, but discover that the dealer ripped them off. Enraged, Mickey corners the dealer on the roof of an apartment building. He accidentally pushes him off the roof to his death. Mickey tries to escape, but is beaten by a gang and then arrested; he is later tried as an adult and convicted. After escaping, with nowhere else to go, Jim returns to his mother’s apartment. After refusing to give the money for Jim, she reports him to the police. He breaks down into crying before he gets dragged away by police. Jim is arrested, convicted, and sentenced to six months' incarceration at Rikers Island for assault, robbery, resisting arrest, and possession of narcotics. There, he spends the time in jail getting clean.\nSix months later, Jim approaches a stage door to give a poetry reading. He encounters Pedro, who has been released from reform school. Pedro offers him a bag of drugs, which Jim refuses. Jim later recites his work before an audience and receives applause.\nReception.\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 47% based on 43 reviews and with an average rating of 5.3/10. The websites critical consensus states \"In spite of its young leading man's heroic efforts to hold it all together, a muddled message prevents \"The Basketball Diaries\" from compelling as a cautionary tale.\" Metacritic gave the movie a score of 46 based in 19 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\nRoger Ebert gave the film two stars out of four. Ebert remarked: \"At the end, Jim is seen going in through a 'stage door' and then we hear him telling the story of his descent and recovery. We can't tell if this is supposed to be genuine testimony or a performance. That's the problem with the whole movie.\"\nLawsuits.\nThe film became controversial in the aftermath of the 1997 Heath High School shooting and the 1999 Columbine High School massacre. Critics noted similarities between those shooting attacks and a dream sequence in the film in which the protagonist (Leonardo DiCaprio) wears a black trenchcoat and shoots six students in his school classroom. The film has been named in lawsuits brought by the relatives of murder victims. In 1999, activist Jack Thompson filed a $33 million lawsuit claiming that the film's plot (along with two internet pornography sites, several computer game companies, and makers and distributors of the 1994 film \"Natural Born Killers\") caused the Heath High School shooting. The case was dismissed in 2001.\nSoundtrack.\n\"The Basketball Diaries\" soundtrack was released in 1995 by PolyGram to accompany the film, featuring songs from Pearl Jam and PJ Harvey. \"AllMusic\" rated it three stars out of five."

        "title": "South of Scotland District (rugby union)",
        "text": "The South of Scotland District is a Scottish amateur rugby union team which plays in the amateur Scottish Inter-District Championship. It draws its players from the South of Scotland, mainly the Scottish Borders where there has always been a proud tradition of rugby union. Historically the South team played matches against touring teams visiting Scotland from abroad, and also competed in the Scottish Inter-District Championship. After rugby union became a professional sport in 1995, the team was replaced in 1996 by the new Border Reivers team based in the same geographical area as the South and who wore the same colours as the old team.\nWhen the professional Border Reivers provincial side folded in 1998, the South amateur district was resurrected and renamed Scottish Borders. The team played as Scottish Borders in three seasons of an amateur Scottish Inter-District Championship from 1999 to 2002. However when the amateur district championship was again revived in the 2022-23 season, the team reverted to its old South of Scotland name.\nThe professional side Border Reivers was resurrected in 2002 to play in the new Celtic League. It folded again in 2007.\nThe amateur district is still used for the representation of amateur players in the Inter-District Championship; and this amateur championship guides the selection of Scotland Club XV international players.\nThe South region also plays at age-grade as the Borders side. The region now includes the Scottish Borders and East Lothian. It contributes professional players to the provincial Edinburgh Rugby side.\nEarly years.\nThe SRU wanted North and South districts to complement its West and East district sides. Happily for them, the Borders were producing fine sides - and rugby union was spreading northwards into Aberdeenshire. It was the provincial clubs though that ultimately forced the Union's hand; led by the arguments of the Aberdeenshire club. Nat Brewis , as honorary secretary of the SRU approved the North-South match in 1880 and sides were named, but owing to the weather the fixture was not played. It was though played the following season.\nThe first North v South match came off on 31 December 1881; the North winning by 1 goal and 1 try to 2 tries. Along with players from Melrose, Hawick, Roxburgh County, Hawick St. Cuthberts and Galashiels, were players from Paisley and Greenock Wanderers for the South.\nThe North v South match came off again on 30 December 1882; the North winning by 1 try to nil.\nThe South played Edinburgh District in December 1890 drawing 2 tries a piece.\nThe South prop Jock Allan was the first married man to play for Scotland in 1934.\nRugby union in the Borders Regions.\nBorders Rugby has many long and proud traditions. The Border League was the first rugby union league to be set up anywhere in the world, and the South team used to regularly compete against touring sides from the Southern Hemisphere.\nMany Borders clubs have helped train and nurture many of Scotland's current internationals.\nTouring sides.\nAs many of the Border sides, most notably Melrose, Gala, Hawick, Selkirk and Jed Forest, produced many international players and even Lions, the South proved worthy competition for the touring sides from the Southern Hemisphere. The South twice drew with South African touring sides (1931–32 and 1969–70) and twice beat Australian touring teams (1966–67 and 1984–85).\nAttendances at 'South' games often numbered well into the thousands (and a crowd of 10,000 attended the Rest of Scottish Districts versus All Blacks (New Zealand) match in 1972 at Hawick) and before the onset of professionalism, The South would often play touring national sides, such as Australia, New Zealand and South Africa before they played the national side\nScottish Inter-District Championship.\nThe Scottish Inter-District Championship began in season 1953–54.\nThe South competed in the annual Scottish Inter-District Championship, playing against the district teams of Glasgow District, Edinburgh District, North and Midlands and sometimes Anglo-Scots. The district championship was played in the autumn and provided a level of representative rugby above club competition but below the full Scottish national team. The best performing players were then picked for a large Scotland squad which would form around New Year, ready for the 5 Nations Championship. Often there was a \"Red vs Blues\" game at Murrayfield to decide the smaller squad.\nSevens tournament.\nThe district used to run a Sevens tournament in April.\nEffect of professionalism.\nWith the advent of professionalism after 1995, the Scottish Rugby Union realised that not even the best semi-professional Scottish club teams could compete in the new Professional Era in rugby union, which was beginning to gain great momentum in the professional leagues of the Southern Hemisphere and the Northern Hemisphere. In an attempt to stay in touch with the leading nations the Scottish Rugby Union (SRU) formed four professional teams, that would compete in the Heineken Cup and later a new Celtic League. These teams were based on the 4 former District Unions in Scotland, and a team now known as the Border Reivers began playing games in Galashiels and Hawick, the team wore the traditional white and red stripes, favoured by The South for their home games.\nFor subsequent history of professional teams representing the South of Scotland, see Border Reivers. However, the Border Reivers were amalgamated with Edinburgh to form the Edinburgh Reivers, who later dropped Reivers and are now known simply as Edinburgh Rugby. The Reivers were resurrected as \"The Borders\" in 2002, only to be disbanded in 2007.\nAmateur revival.\nThe South team itself was revived in December 2009 for a game with Northumberland which the South won 37–3 and in the 2011–12 season beat the Barbarians 22–15 at Hawick. It now plays in the revived Amateur Scottish Inter-District Championship.\nRenewed hope for a professional rugby team in the Borders came when Sir Moir Lockhead, the Chairman of the SRU, declared in May 2012 that \"the Irish model is what we are trying to replicate now\". The Irish model has four Provinces, much like the four Districts of Scotland in the early professional years, implying a return for the South/Borders and North/Caledonia.\nRebirth of the amateur district.\nThe South of Scotland District as an amateur district, returned in the 2022–23 Amateur Scottish Inter-District Championship. Its Head Coach is Matty Douglas, of Hawick, aided by assistant coaches Andrew Clark (Musselburgh), Iain Chisholm (Peebles) and Robert Grigg (Melrose Rugby).\nDouglas noted:\nIt’s great to be given the opportunity to lead the South as Head Coach. The competition is steeped in tradition, and I know how much the South means to a lot of people. To have the Inter-district back gives the top players in the Premiership and National leagues an opportunity to showcase their ability and push for Scotland Club XV selection in the future. We have a great coaching team selected along with a fantastic management team in the background. I know we will all work hard to make sure we give the South the time and effort it deserves.\nHonours.\nThe South won the Scottish Inter-District Championship 17 times outright, more than any other District.\nIn addition, it also shared the Championship with other Districts 10 times.\nSeason standings.\nScottish Inter-District Championship.\nFor the South's professional championship results from 1996 see Border Reivers.\nProfessional Era.\nThe Amateur Scottish Inter-District Championship has been restarted twice in the professional era. The first restart was from 1999 to 2002; the second restart from the 2022-23 season."

        "text": "George Robert Woodruff (March 14, 1916 – November 1, 2001) was an American college football player, coach, and sports administrator. Woodruff was a native of Georgia and an alumnus of the University of Tennessee, where he played college football. He was best known as the head coach of the Baylor University and University of Florida football teams, and later, as the athletic director at the University of Tennessee.\nEarly life and education.\nWoodruff was born in Athens, Georgia, in 1916, and attended high school in Savannah, Georgia. After high school, he enrolled at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, where he played tackle for the Tennessee Volunteers football team under head coach Robert Neyland. Woodruff graduated from Tennessee in 1939.\nCoaching career.\nTennessee, Army and Georgia Tech assistant coach.\nWoodruff stayed in Knoxville after he graduated from the University of Tennessee, working as an assistant coach under Neyland during the 1939, 1940 and 1941 football seasons. During World War II, he was an officer in U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and served as an assistant football coach under Earl Blaik at West Point in 1944 and 1945. He was discharged from the Army as a major in 1946, and accepted an assistant coaching position under Bobby Dodd at Georgia Tech. The 1939 and 1940 Volunteers teams had ranked among the top five in the final Associated Press (AP) football poll; the AP declared the Cadets national champions in 1944 and 1945. Woodruff gained the experience of being a part of three great college coaching staffs.\nBaylor Bears head coach.\nWoodruff became the head football coach at Baylor University in Waco, Texas in 1947. He coached the Baylor Bears football team for three seasons from 1947 through 1949, compiling a 19–10–2 record. His 1948 Bears posted a 6–3–2 record and finished with a 20–7 win over Wake Forest in the Dixie Bowl. Woodruff coached his 1949 Bears to a final AP Poll top-20 ranking and an 8–2 record, but the Bears did not receive a bowl bid. In early December 1949, Woodruff became embroiled in a dispute with the Baylor athletic director, Ralph Wolf, which became public when both Woodruff and Wolf resigned their positions within twenty-four hours on December 9 and 10. Although the subject of their dispute was never publicly disclosed, the university announced that Woodruff had withdrawn his resignation and would keep his position on December 14, but Woodruff resigned a second time on January 6, 1950 to become the head football coach and athletic director at the University of Florida.\nFlorida Gators head coach.\nAfter the 1949 season, Woodruff replaced Raymond Wolf as the head football coach at the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida. In order to induce Woodruff to coach the Florida Gators football team, the Florida Board of Control offered him a seven-year guaranteed contract at $17,000 per year. Woodruff's annual salary was $5,000 more than that of University of Florida President J. Hillis Miller. He was only 34 years old.\nWoodruff's coaching philosophy reflected that of his mentor, Tennessee Volunteers coach Robert Neyland, who emphasized defense and the kicking game. Ironically, his first Gators team in 1950 had a stellar offense and a weak defensive squad. The Gators offense was led by quarterback Haywood Sullivan, the first sophomore in Southeastern Conference (SEC) history to throw for more than 1,000 yards in a season, under Woodruff's offensive coordinator, Frank Broyles. Florida managed to upset the thirteenth-ranked Vanderbilt Commodores in Nashville, Tennessee, propelling the Gators into the top twenty teams of the Associated Press (AP) Poll for the first time. With the addition of Rick Casares to the backfield, Woodruff's 1951 Gators scored a 30–21 upset of the heavily favored Alabama Crimson Tide in their homecoming game in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.\nThe 1952 Gators were Woodruff's most successful team, and the 1952 season included some of his most inspired coaching. After quarterback Haywood Sullivan left school early to accept a professional baseball contract with Boston Red Sox, Woodruff experimented with fullback Rick Casares at quarterback, but after three games it was apparent that Casares was not the solution. Woodruff's unconventional replacement, defensive back Doug Dickey, turned out to be exactly what the Gators needed at quarterback—a talented athlete and savvy game manager. Woodruff led his 1952 Gators team to the program's first top-twenty finish in the AP Poll, their first NCAA-sanctioned bowl game, the Gator Bowl, and a 14–13 bowl win over the Tulsa Golden Hurricane. At the conclusion of the 1952 season, senior defensive tackle Charlie LaPradd became the Gators' third first-team All-American.\nAlthough Woodruff was a talented administrator, he sometimes had difficulty expressing himself verbally. He would often stop mid-sentence to collect his thoughts, which Charlie LaPradd once described as \"With [Woodruff's] long periods of silence, he would make you wonder if he was thirty minutes ahead of you or thirty minutes behind.\" Team manager Hill Brannon remembered one of Woodruff's many Yogi Berra-esque pre-game exhortations as \"Remember, the team that makes the fewest mistakes, makes the fewest mistakes.\" In a moment of self-deprecating humor, Woodruff once described himself as \"the oratorical equivalent of a blocked punt.\"\nWoodruff also developed a reputation for identifying and fostering talented young assistant coaches. His Gators assistants included Frank Broyles, future head football coach of the Arkansas Razorbacks; Hank Foldberg, future head coach of the Texas A&amp;M Aggies; Dale Hall, future head coach of the Army Black Knights; John Sauer, future head coach of The Citadel Bulldogs; John Rauch, future head coach of the Buffalo Bills and Oakland Raiders; and Tonto Coleman, former head coach of the Abilene Christian Wildcats and future commissioner of the Southeastern Conference. His Gators players included Doug Dickey, the future head coach of the Tennessee Volunteers and Florida Gators.\nIn the competitive SEC of the 1950s, Woodruff's Gators would not win more than six games again in a season, but they were ranked in the top twenty teams of the final AP Poll in each of 1957, 1958 and 1959. Woodruff coached the Florida Gators football team for ten seasons from 1950 through 1959, finishing with a 53–42–6 record. During his tenure, Woodruff's Gators scored notable upsets, suffered close losses, received their first two NCAA-sanctioned bowl game invitations and their first four final AP poll rankings, but Woodruff's greatest legacy in Gainesville may have been rebuilding the Gators into a team that was consistently competitive against the other major football programs of the SEC, and thereby laying the groundwork for the future successes of Ray Graves' 1960s Florida Gators teams that followed.\nWoodruff was inducted into the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame as an \"honorary letter winner\" in 1983.\nAthletic director.\nDuring his time as the Gators football coach, Woodruff also worked as Florida's athletic director. From 1963 to 1985, Woodruff served as the athletic director at his alma mater, the University of Tennessee. As Tennessee athletic director, Woodruff oversaw the rise of the Volunteers' athletic program as a nationally recognized power and was responsible for the renovation, expansion and construction of the university's state-of-the-art athletic facilities. Between 1963 and 1985, the Volunteers won national championships in cross country, swimming and diving, and track and field, and participated in fifteen football bowl games, eight NCAA men's basketball tournaments and four NIT basketball tournaments. Woodruff also served on the U.S. Olympic Committee for the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, Germany. When he retired in 1985, he was succeeded as Tennessee athletic director by another former Gators football coach and his former Gators quarterback, Doug Dickey.\nDeath.\nWoodruff died in Knoxville on November 1, 2001; he was 85 years old. He was survived by his second wife, Gertrude \"Trudy\" Handley Woodruff, three sons, a daughter, a stepson, and four grandchildren. His first wife, Margaret Artley Woodruff, died in 1977."

He found some success playing with twin brothers Henrik and Daniel Sedin in his first full season with the team, registering 12 goals in 2003–04, the bulk of which came in the team's first few games. This led him to being awarded the NHL Rookie of the Month award for the month of November. The line quickly earned the nickname \"The Mattress Line,\" due to its members figuratively composing \"two twins and a king.\" He spent the 2004–05 season playing for Vancouver's then-AHL affiliates, the Manitoba Moose, where he suffered a serious concussion - one that took him many months to recover from.\nAfter refusing to sign the Canucks' qualifying offer for the 2006–07 season, King opted to play for Skellefteå AIK in the Swedish elite league Elitserien. His rights were traded to the Anaheim Ducks on June 23, 2007, in exchange for Ryan Shannon. In the 2007–08 season, King made his return to the NHL playing in four games with the Ducks although he primarily played for their affiliate, the Portland Pirates, of the AHL.\nKing went back to Europe in 2008 and played three seasons in the German elite league, one with Adler Mannheim and two with the Hamburg Freezers. After returning from Germany, King played two seasons with the St. John's IceCaps, the minor league affiliate of the Winnipeg Jets.\nCoaching career.\nKing announced his retirement as a player in August 2013 and was subsequently hired by the IceCaps as an assistant coach.

        "title": "International rule (sailing)",
        "text": "The International rule, also known as the Metre rule, was created for the measuring and rating of yachts to allow different designs of yacht to race together under a handicap system. Prior to the ratification of the International rule in 1907, countries raced yachts under their own national rules and international competition was always subject to various forms of subjective handicapping. \nBackground.\nThe word 'ton' and hence 'tonnage' originates from the word 'tun' which is a measure of volume equivalent to the size of a barrel which could contain 252 gallons of wine. In the UK, merchant sailing vessels were historically measured using Builder's Old Measurement to measure tonnage and taxed according. Due to the complications with accurately measuring of the internal volume of a sailing vessel (think of the calculus that would be involved to determine the 3 dimensional area (or volume) of a ship's hull and its continually changing curvature from the bow to the stern) a set of distances at points on the hull was defined to be measured and entered into a formula which then defined the tonnage and hence the taxes to be paid to the government of the day. As each ship was measured on the same basis it did not matter that the tonnage measurement was not a 100% accurate measure of volume as all vessels were measured on the same basis which led to an equitable basis of allocating tax.\nThis system of measuring or rating merchant sailing ships has a long, well established history, so tonnage, and the calculus involved was naturally also used to measure or rate a sailing yacht.\nYacht handicapping.\nDuring the early part of the 19th century interest in yacht racing had achieved sufficient momentum to need an agreed handicapping system to allow different types of yacht to race on an equitable basis. The method of measuring merchant sailing ships carried over into the world of yacht racing so that a yacht also now had a measured tonnage which allowed size comparisons and hence performance comparisons to be made between yachts on the basis that a properly designed big yacht will sail faster than a properly designed small yacht.\nEach yacht fell within a Class based upon its measured tonnage. In the early 19th century four ranges of tonnage and hence four Classes were defined. Based on experience gained from the results of numerous races each Class was allocated a distance allowance that the Class had to give away to the next lower Class. This was equivalent to a Class 1 having to sail more distance than a Class 4 yacht during a race.\nIn 1834 handicapping by distance was changed to handicapping by time.\nAs yacht racing in particular became more and more popular designers started to look for and found loopholes in the measurement rules to enable a design to get a better rating. Whilst this encouraged designers it discouraged owners from participating in handicap racing because designs were being outdated almost before the yacht was launched.\nIn order to restore the equilibrium, work began on new formulas, which resulted, in the Thames Measurement which was the first formula defined for yachts.\nThe adoption of the British Thames Measurement by the Yacht Club of France in 1870 may mark the beginning of international rating rules. In 1893, the Germano-Scandinavian Union was formed and it developed its \"Union Rule\". Starting in 1902, under the leadership of the New York Yacht Club, U.S. yacht clubs agreed to a \"Universal Rule\" in 1905 which was based on a formula developed by Nathanael Herreshoff.\nDevelopment of the International rule.\nInitial Impetus.\nBy the early 20th Century yacht racing had spread across Europe but each country had its own different rating rules but they all typically used similar principles. International competition was always subject to various forms of handicapping which was often subjective and certainly open to protest\nWhat was needed was a common rating or an agreed International rule, which would enable yachts from one country to race competitively in a different country.\nThe leading yacht racing countries came together and laid down a system that calculated the rating of yachts, measurement rules, construction regulations (scantlings) and rules for racing. This was largely driven by the United Kingdom. The then Secretary of the YRA (now called the Royal Yachting Association), Brooke Heckstall-Smith had been in discussion with Scandinavians German and French yacht clubs and a conference was held at the Langham Hotel in London in July 1906. Representatives from eleven countries attended, together with an observer from the United States, plus several respected nautical engineers and designers and they started to formulate the International rule.\nA committee met again in October 1906 in Berlin to elaborate on the application of the Rule. The conference delegates met finally again in Paris in October 1907 and ratified the first International rule which defined not only the rating of yachts and measurement rules but also construction regulations (scantlings) and racing rules. Delegates from this meeting went on to form the International Yacht Racing Union (IYRU); the precursor to the present International Sailing Federation (ISAF).\nThe USA sent observers to the meetings but did not initially adopt the first International rule and continued with the Universal Rule based on the formula developed by Nathanael Herreshoff.\nEvolution of the rule.\nThe International rule eventually became the backbone of yacht racing. The Rule created a formula that took into account most problematic areas that had previously caused dissent among the racing nations. It does not restrict size—many individual classes were created. It allowed designers a degree of latitude—yet controlled unsafe extremes. It laid down construction rules and governed the use of materials—yet understood that the Rule must develop.\nFirst International rule.\nUsed from 1907 to 1920\nwhere\nSecond International rule.\nUsed from 1920 to 1933.\nwhere\nThird International rule.\nUsed from 1933 to 1939.\nwhere\nRule forms.\nIt is important to note the term Metre does not refer to the length of the yacht; it is the product of a formula and denotes the class. A Six Metre yacht can be from 10 to 12 metres in length.\nMetre rule has proven to be successful and enduring, seeing only minor revisions over the years. Whilst many different Metre Class yachts were constructed during those first heady years, three sizes have maintained their popularity; the 6, 8 and 12 Metre Classes. The year after the ratification, the 12 Metre Class were chosen for the Olympics—the 6 and 8 Metres were also used at different stages. The 12 Metre Class was used for the America's Cup events until 1987. A relatively new arrival is the one-person 2.4 Metre Class, currently active as a Paralympics class.\nInternational rule should not be confused with Square Metre Rule.\nWhy \"Metre\" is in the names International rule yachts.\nIt is commonly believed that the term Metre refers to the units of measurement used for the input values entered into the formula. This has led to the idea that the use of metric units for the formula represented a major concession on the part of the British whose preeminence in yachting at the time could have justified using imperial units. In fact, the formula works equally well with imperial units. The relation between the length and area components of the formula are preserved whether in metric or imperial units.\nThe use of the term Metre refers to the unit of length (the metre) used in the expression of the result of the calculation. If one uses imperial units, the result for a Six Metre yacht is 19.685 feet. The London Conference preferred the term \"Six Metre\" yachts to \"19.685 foot\" yacht.\nWhy doesn't the \"number\" correspond to a yacht's length?\nFor the International rule, the rating number is approximately equal to the sailing length of the hull. These boats have long overhangs which allow the waterline length to increase as the boat heels over. A displacement hull's maximum speed (the hull speed) is directly proportional to the square root of its waterline length.\nThe first rating rules were first expressed as the weighted sum of various speed factors such as length and sail area. Later rules included resistance factors, such as draught or freeboard. These resistance factors could either be subtracted from the speed factors or used as divisors of the speed factors. Some rules thus took the form of fractions—some \"trivial\", where the divisor was merely a constant, and others \"non-trivial\", where the divisor was a resistance factor.\nThe Union Rule was a trivial fraction (the divisor being \"150\") and the Universal Rule non-trivial (the divisor being 5 times the cube root of the draught).\nIt was the illustrious architect, Dixon Kemp, who began the tradition of expressing British rules as trivial fractions with a divisor of \"2\", thus starting the tradition of the age old question:\n\"Since your boat is a Six metre, why is it 12 metres long?\"\nMetre classes.\nWhile many different Metre Class yachts were constructed during those first heady years, of the sizes specified in the original rule, four have maintained their popularity; the 5.5, 6, 8 and 12 Metre Classes. The year after the ratification, the 12 Metre Class were chosen for the Olympics—the 6 Metre and the 8 metres were also used in different years. The later 5.5 Metre was also used in the Olympics. The 12 Metre Class was used for the America's Cup events from 1958 through 1987.\nIn 1936, Cornelius Shields, used the International Rule as the basis for a new one-design class. Designed by Norwegian Bjarne Aas, and modeled after his classic 6 metre Saga, the International One Design sloop, or IOD, is today raced in fleets based in Norway, Sweden, the UK, Canada, Bermuda and the United States of America. The IOD is a very tightly regulated variation of a 6 metre.\nA recent development has been the 2.4 Metre Class—a Metre class boat designed for a solo sailor. As a keelboat, and unlike a dinghy, it does not require the crew to balance his weight to keep the boat from capsizing. Therefore, it has become a very popular class for the physically disabled, and is currently used in the Paralympics.\nA group of Metre Class yacht owners, friends and enthusiasts celebrated the centenary of the International rule, in July, 2007, in Cowes UK, by organising a regatta for all Metre Class yachts.\nMetre boats built and afloat.\nAbout 6000 of the larger metre rule boats have been built since 1907. About half of them still exist, which is a remarkable number considering that most of them were built before World War II. Partly this is a result of the fact that the R-metre boats had to adhere to Lloyd's strict scantling rules, that has given them longevity that very few other traditional classes have been blessed with.\n Numbers without references are estimates.\nIn addition, over four thousand 2.4 m have built since the classes introduction in the 1980s.\nMetre boats in the Olympics.\nFrom 2000 to 2016, the 2.4 m was used for the sailing at Paralympic Games."

        "text": "The Greece men's national basketball team () represents Greece in international basketball. They are controlled by the Hellenic Basketball Federation, the governing body for basketball in Greece. Greece is currently ranked 14th in the FIBA World Ranking.\nGreece have appeared nine times at the FIBA World Cup, with their best result coming in 2006 as runners-up, after beating the United States 101–95 in the tournament's semi-final. Greece have taken part in the EuroBasket 28 times, winning the tournament twice; while also coming away with one silver (1989), as well as two bronze medals (1949, 2009). Some of the team's highlights at the competition were beating the Soviet Union 103–101 in the final in Athens to win their first title in 1987, and defeating Germany 78–62 in the final in 2005. Greece have competed four times at the Olympic Games, their best results being fifth place finishes on three occasions (1996, 2004, 2008).\nGreece is the only national team in the world to have defeated the United States during Mike Krzyzewski's era (2005–2016), as the latter had an undefeated record both before and after the 2006 FIBA World Cup semi-final, all major competitions included.\nHistory.\nBasketball has a long tradition in Greece, as the country was one of the eight founding members of the International Basketball Federation, more commonly known by its French acronym FIBA, in 1932. However, the men's national team was considered as a second-class power in international basketball for several decades and came into prominence in the mid-1980s by winning the EuroBasket 1987. It was the first ever major international title won by a Greece national team in any sports. Basketball became extremely popular in the country and since then Greece has been placed in the high level on the basketball stage.\nInternational debut and first successes.\nGreece was to take part in the EuroBasket 1935, the inaugural FIBA European Championship held in Geneva, but were not able to travel to Switzerland due to financial problems. Thus, Greece made their international debut fourteen years later in the EuroBasket 1949 in Cairo, Egypt. That tournament has been marked as the weakest in the history of the competition, as most of the leading European basketball nations at the time refused to travel by plane to Egypt. Greece entered the tournament as a newcomer and got through to make their first major success in their very first appearance in the competition, finishing in third place behind hosts Egypt and a strong side French team.\nAfter their first international success, the Greeks participated in the next tournament at EuroBasket 1951, where they reached the semi-final round ending up eighth among the eighteen nations that participated. They also made their first appearance at the Summer Olympic Games, taking part in the Summer Olympic basketball tournament in 1952. They were narrowly eliminated in the preliminary phase, finishing at the bottom of the table along with other six teams and also bringing to an end the first period in the history of Greek basketball as they did not enter any major tournaments for the rest of the 1950s.\nDuring the 1960s, the 1970s, and the first half of the 1980s, Greece appeared in most of the EuroBasket tournaments, with their best performances being 8th place in 1965 and 9th place in both 1979 and 1981. They did not qualify for the Summer Olympic Games or to the FIBA World Cup, but they did win two regional gold medals. They won the gold at the 1979 Mediterranean Games by beating Yugoslavia by a score of 85–74 in the final, and the 1979 Balkan Championship, again by beating Yugoslavia, 66–62.\nRise to the top level: European champions.\nThe history of the national team was fairly pedestrian until the mid-1980s, when Greece arrived as a powerhouse in international basketball, spearheaded by elite players like Nikos Galis, Panagiotis Giannakis, Panagiotis Fasoulas and Fanis Christodoulou. The arrival began with their qualification to the 1986 FIBA World Cup, a first in their history. The national team went on to finish 10th among the twenty-four nations at the tournament, but it was a catalyst for the future.\nThe following year, Greece faced their biggest challenge, as the country hosted the EuroBasket 1987 with the national team entering the tournament with a formidable line-up. After advancing through the group stages, they eliminated Italy and Yugoslavia, both among the favorites to win the tournament, in the quarter-finals and the semi-finals respectively. In the final, Greece faced the defending champions and heavily favored Soviet Union. In front of 17,000 Greek fans at the Peace and Friendship Stadium, the hosts won the gold medal after a thrilling win 103–101 over the Soviets, with Nikos Galis scoring 40 points. It was the first time that the Greek national team won a major tournament in any sport, instantly making basketball the national sport while the national team became cherished throughout the country.\nThe European champions failed to qualify for the 1988 Summer Olympic Games for a first time in 36 years, despite a decent performance in the pre-Olympic tournament. At the EuroBasket 1989, the defending champions were under pressure to prove that they could repeat the level of excellence they displayed at their last EuroBasket appearance, and they did so in a convincing way. After they had advanced to the knockout stages, the Soviet Union stood in their way in the semi-finals, but Greece defeated them once again and reached the final. In contrast to 1989, this time Greece had to overcome Yugoslavia and the latter's home court advantage in Zagreb. Greece would take home the silver medal, repeating their feat from the previous tournament to at least finish in a medal position at EuroBasket, making it their third medal in their basketball history.\nFirmly among the best in the world but no medals.\nIn the 1990s there was a series of successful results for the national team, which was present in all major international tournaments every year except for the 1992 Summer Olympic Games. In the period between 1990 and 1998, Greece never fell below 6th place and usually ended up 4th. They also qualified for a second Olympic appearance in 1996, where the team finished in 5th place.\nAt the 1990 FIBA World Cup, the team would face a new challenge as they would have to compete without their leading scorer Nikos Galis who was injured, but performed better than four years ago and eventually placed 6th in the tournament. For the next two competitions in 1994 and 1998 Greece finished 4th. In 1994, the team reached the semi-finals but were eliminated by the United States and played for the third place against Croatia to which they lost and were placed 4th, a result that was considered to demonstrate the continued prominence of the team. In 1998, the tournament was held in Athens and the Greeks hoped to qualify for the final. Although in the semi-final they were eliminated by FR Yugoslavia in extra time, and their disappointment of missing the chance to reach the final led to an easy defeat to the United States in the bronze medal game, once more leaving Greece 4th.\nAt the EuroBasket 1991 Greece finished 5th and just out of reach at 4th place of the medal position in 1993, 1995 and 1997. Greece acted as host at the 1995 tournament, failing to repeat the triumph of 1987 when defeated in the semi-final by FR Yugoslavia, something that happened again in 1997, while hosts Germany had eliminated Greece in 1993.\nThe years 1999–2002 were marked by an obvious decline of Greece. The beginning of this era was the shocking 16th and last place of the team in the final standings of the EuroBasket 1999, having suffered three defeats in the preliminary round. Consequently, Greece was absent from the 2000 Summer Olympic Games. At the next European championship in 2001, the Greek team was placed 9th, thus failed to qualify for the 2002 FIBA World Cup.\nEuropean champions and FIBA World Cup runners-up.\nThe revival of Greece started at the EuroBasket 2003, where an overhauled team finished 5th. The experiment was partly successful, but the public was not very enthusiastic. The 2004 Summer Olympic Games in Athens, were considered as the biggest chance for the hosts Greece to win their first Olympic medal. But in a close 69–64 loss to the eventual gold medalists Argentina in the quarter-finals, stopped any chance of it becoming reality. The team would go on to place 5th in the standings at the event overall.\nGreece were considered a strong outsider for the medals at the EuroBasket 2005. They advanced from the group stage with two wins in three games and eliminated Israel and Russia to reach the semi-finals, where they faced France. The French side were leading the score by seven points with only one minute left, Greece appeared to have no chance to pull out the win and one more lost semi-final was coming. However, the Greeks managed to get within a two-point deficit and won 67–66 with a three-pointer by Dimitris Diamantidis with three seconds remaining, setting off a joyous celebration from the Greek side. In the final and in front of a raucous pro-Greece sold-out crowd of 20,000 at the Belgrade Arena, the Greeks defeated Germany in a convincing way 78–62, winning the gold medal for the second time in their history.\nThe following year, the European champions won the 2006 Stanković Cup going undefeated in the tournament and defeating Germany again in the final with an impressive 84–47 win. At the 2006 FIBA World Cup, Greece were determined to win a medal they had closely missed in their last two appearances in the tournament. They reached the semi-finals with a record of (7–0), with some of their wins coming in grand fashion. In the semi-finals, Greece defeated the popular odds-on United States in a 101–95 upset, rallying back from twelve points down, and qualified for the final. But, they ultimately ran out of gas from their dramatic game with the Americans and lost 70–47 to Spain, ending up with the silver medal. Despite the loss the players were greeted enthusiastically by celebrating fans on their return to Greece, due to their first ever medal in a World Cup and their victory over the United States.\nAt the EuroBasket 2007, the defending European champions advanced to the semi-finals where they faced the hosts and reigning World champions Spain, in a rematch of the final one year prior. Greece came close to take revenge but eventually lost 82–77, and played in the bronze medal game where they succumbed to Lithuania. At the 2008 Summer Olympic Games, another last-second defeat 80–78 to Argentina in the quarter-finals led Greece to a 5th-place finish once again. At the EuroBasket 2009, the national team was potently changed, with a bunch of young players and without key players Thodoris Papaloukas and Dimitris Diamantidis, as well as Panagiotis Vasilopoulos and Kostas Tsartsaris, the tournament was perceived as the turning point for Greece after their major recent achievements. However, after their fourth consecutive defeat to Spain in the semi-finals and sixty years after their first, and last, bronze medal they managed to take the podium in the third position against the odds, with a thrilling 57–56 win over Slovenia, ceasing the curse of being defeated in all bronze medal matches in their history.\nBefore the 2010 FIBA World Cup, the team exhibited impressive performances during friendly preparation matches, beating Germany 82–54, Russia 101–63, Croatia 90–81, Canada 123–49, Slovenia 96–72, and Serbia 74–73, in a game that ended up in a brawl. That brawl exposed problems within the team, which showed a different face in crucial matches in the World Cup. In the group stage, Greece lost to Turkey and Russia, (being accused of purposely losing the game with Russia, to avoid playing with Spain in the knock-out stage). France's loss to New Zealand meant that Greece had to face Spain anyway in the round of 16. The two teams met once more, in a dramatic game that Spain won in the last minutes (a game that lead to Greek complaints about critical referee calls). That loss meant that the Greek team was eliminated from the next stage, ending up 11th (its worst performance in a World Cup). That game led to the fifth consecutive Spanish victory over Greece in major international competitions (Greece would stop Spain's winning streak 3 years later at EuroBasket 2013, beating them 79–75, with Vassilis Spanoulis scoring 20 points). That actually represented a reversal of the previous situation, as Greece had previously defeated Spain in every game they played against each other at the four major international competitions (1990 FIBA World Cup, EuroBasket 1993, EuroBasket 1995, and the 1998 FIBA World Cup). After the elimination in the 2010 FIBA World Cup, Dimitris Diamantidis announced his retirement from the national team, at age 30.\n2011–present.\nDuring preparations for EuroBasket 2011, new head coach, Ilias Zouros, faced one of the greatest challenges in the history of the Greek basketball team, with the absences of no less than 9 key players (including star players: Dimitris Diamantidis, Thodoris Papaloukas, Sofoklis Schortsanitis, and Vassilis Spanoulis). Zouros had to assemble a team mostly made of young players (half of the team's players had never participated in the EuroBasket, with little time to prepare. The new national team, featuring some of the next generation Greek players (\"Generation X\"), exhibited promising signs during friendlies, beating Russia 83–80, Germany 69–56, and Turkey 62–38. At the EuroBasket, Greece managed to reach the quarterfinals, where they lost to the eventual silver medalist France 64–56. Subsequently, the victory against Serbia 87–77, and the loss to Lithuania 73–69, led Greece to 6th place, thus securing participation in the 2012 FIBA World Olympic Qualifying Tournament. At the 2012 FIBA World Olympic Qualifying Tournament, Greece failed to qualify for the Olympics, after an 80–79 loss to Nigeria.\nParticipation at the EuroBasket 2013 with its new head coach, Andrea Trinchieri, didn't bring any consolation to its fans. The team once again exhibited superb performance during preparation games (including commanding victories against both eventual finalists France and Lithuania) earning the top spot on the FIBA EuroBasket power rankings before the tournament. Their start in the EuroBasket was equally fruitful, with comfortable victories against Sweden (79–51), Russia (80–71) and Turkey (84–61). However, serious injuries to (Spanoulis, Mavrokefalidis, Papanikolaou, Zisis) plagued the Greek team, despite the impressive win against the defending champions Spain. Losses in critical games (especially those against Italy and Finland in their preliminary phase group), led to the failure to reach the quarterfinals for the first time since the EuroBasket 2001. They were, however, selected as a wild card for the 2014 FIBA World Cup, being placed in Group B consisting of the Philippines, Senegal, Argentina, Croatia and rivals Puerto Rico.\nThe national team once again introduced a new head coach in Fotios Katsikaris, and once more had to face what had become a chronic problem of missing key players (this time Vassilis Spanoulis, Kosta Koufos, Antonis Fotsis, Stratos Perperoglou and Sofoklis Schortsanitis). Greece ended up first in its group, after defeating all the above teams (being, along with USA and Spain, one of three undefeated teams in the Group Stage), but lost to Serbia in the Round of 16, and ended up in ninth place overall. Greece participated in EuroBasket 2015, in Group C consisting of Netherlands, Croatia, Slovenia, Georgia and rivals North Macedonia. The national team with Fotios Katsikaris as head coach, ended up first in its group, after defeating all the above nations (being, along with France and Serbia, one of three undefeated teams in the Group Stage). In the Round of 16, they defeated Belgium (75–54), but in the quarterfinals, they lost to Spain (73–71). Two days later (17 September 2015), they defeated Latvia (97–90), ending up in fifth place overall, and qualified to one of the three 2016 FIBA World Olympic Qualifying Tournaments. At the 2016 Turin FIBA World Olympic Qualifying Tournament, Greece defeated Iran (78–53), and Mexico (86–70), but lost to Croatia (66–61), and failed to qualify to the Summer Olympic Games, for the second time in a row. However, they qualified for EuroBasket 2017.\nGreece began their EuroBasket 2017 campaign with a victory against Iceland, but lost their next three games against Slovenia, France, and Finland. However, they defeated Poland, by a score of 95–77, to clinch a spot in the knockout rounds. In the round of 16 Greece had a dominant performance in defeating Lithuania, by the score of 77–64, and advanced to the quarterfinals. There, they were eliminated in a hard-fought battle against Russia 74–69.\nTeam.\nCurrent roster.\nRoster for the Eurobasket 2025.\nDepth chart.\nBased on the recent calls and selections\nPast

        "text": "The Turkey men's national basketball team () represents Turkey in international basketball tournaments. They are governed by the Turkish Basketball Federation. Their nickname is the \"12 Dev Adam\", meaning 12 Giant Men.\nTurkey has competed at every major international basketball tournament. Their greatest achievements are winning two silver medals on home soil at the EuroBasket (2001), and FIBA World Cup (2010) respectively. Turkey has also won two gold (1987, 2013), one silver (1971), and three bronze (1967, 1983, 2009) medals at the Mediterranean Games. They also won the gold medal at the 1981 Balkan Championship.\nCurrently, Turkey stands 24th in the FIBA World Ranking.\nHistory.\nAhmet Robenson was known as being the first organizer of basketball in Turkey. In 1936, Turkey played its first ever basketball match against Greece, winning 49–12. For many years basketball was a little-known sport in Turkey, but when the American drama The White Shadow started airing in the country, it gained popularity. However, the national team at the time lacked experience and could not win any international tournaments until the 1980s, when Turkey won the gold medal at the 1981 Balkan Championship and the 1987 Mediterranean Games. At the club level, Efes Pilsen was the first Turkish club to win a European Cup in any team sport, the 1995–96 FIBA Korać Cup. Since then, basketball in Turkey has grown immensely, as the national team began to play a major role in international tournaments. The Turkish national team won the silver medal at both EuroBasket 2001, and the 2010 FIBA World Cup.\n1930s–1940s.\nTurkey's European Championship debut came at the EuroBasket 1949. The Turks split their six matches in the seven-team round robin tournament, finishing with three wins and three losses for fourth place.\n1950s.\nTurkey competed again at the EuroBasket 1951 in Paris. Their only loss in the preliminary round was to the Soviet Union as Turkey earned the second-rank spot with a 3–1 record. Their single loss to Bulgaria in the semi-final round, however, was enough to bump them from championship contention as they came out on the bottom of a three-way tie with a 2–1 record. They won their classification 5–8 game, but lost the 5/6 game to Italy.\nTurkey returned after missing 1953's edition to the EuroBasket 1955 in Budapest. They went 1–2 in their preliminary round group, taking third in the pool and moving to classification play. There they lost only to France on their way to a 3–1 record in classification round 1. They lost their 9–12 semi-final by 1 point to Finland, but defeated England 77–54 in the next game to take 11th place of the 18 team tournament.\nTurkey appeared again at the EuroBasket 1957 in Sofia. Losing to the Soviet Union and Poland in the preliminary round, Turkey took third in the group to be sent to the classification pool. They defeated each of the other seven teams in the classification round in order to take 9th place of the 16 teams.\n1960s–1980s.\nThe 1960s, 1970s and 1980s were in general a barren period for the Turkish national basketball team. They were, however, successful at the Mediterranean Games, winning two bronze medals in 1967 and 1983, one silver medal in 1971, and one gold medal in 1987. Turkey also won the gold medal at the 1981 Balkan Championship. The team was led by notable coaches like Yalçın Granit and Mehmet Baturalp in the 1960s and 1970s, and by Aydan Siyavuş during the Balkan and Mediterranean triumphs of the 1980s, which marked the dawn of a successful new era in Turkish basketball (especially in European club competitions) starting from the late 1980s and early 1990s. Efe Aydan and Erman Kunter were among the notable players of this period in Turkish basketball. Erman Kunter, who still holds a number of all-time records in the Turkish Basketball League as a player, later became a successful coach in the Turkish and French basketball leagues, and led the Turkish national team at the EuroBasket 1999.\n1990s.\nTurkey appeared again at the EuroBasket 1993 after 12 years of absence, but finished 11th among 16 teams. Turkey finished 13th among 14 teams at the EuroBasket 1995, 8th among 16 teams at the EuroBasket 1997, and again 8th among 16 teams at the EuroBasket 1999.\n2000s.\nAs the host country of the EuroBasket 2001, the Turkish national basketball team, led by coach Aydın Örs, reached the EuroBasket final for the first time in their history. Turkey defeated Croatia in the quarter-finals and Germany in the semis, before their showdown with FR Yugoslavia in the final. Turkey would ultimately lose the game {69–78}, finishing the Euros with the silver medal. Furthermore, Turkish stars İbrahim Kutluay scored 19 points in the final game, while Hidayet Türkoğlu was named to the All-Tournament team.\nDue to their surprising finish at EuroBasket 2001, Turkey qualified for their first appearance to the FIBA World Cup in 2002. Turkey, however, would accumulate just four wins against four defeats at the World Cup to finish the tournament in ninth.\nAt the EuroBasket 2003, Turkey reached the second round where they got eliminated by Serbia and Montenegro.\nTurkey qualified for the EuroBasket 2005 held in Serbia and Montenegro, but lost to Lithuania (87–75) and Croatia (80–67), defeating only Bulgaria (94–89) in the preliminary round. This win brought Turkey to the knock-out stage, where Germany eliminated the team 66–57. Turkey ended the tournament with a 9–12 rank.\nTurkey was awarded one of the four wild cards by FIBA for the qualification to the 2006 FIBA World Cup in Japan.\nThe Turkish squad completed the preliminary round in Group C in second place behind the Greek team, and was entitled to play in the Round of 16. There the team defeated Slovenia 90–84, to advance into the quarter-finals of the World Cup for the first time in their history. However, In the quarter-finals, Turkey lost to Argentina, and was relegated to the classification round. There, Turkey would go on to defeat Lithuania once again, before losing to France to finish the tournament in sixth place.\nAfter their surprising results at the tournament, a new nickname, \"12 Cesur Yürek\" (12 Brave Hearts) was proposed after the young and inexperienced teams' fearless performance at the 2006 FIBA World Cup, despite not having star players Hidayet Türkoğlu, Mehmet Okur, Mirsad Türkcan, Kerem Tunçeri and Hüseyin Beşok.\nAt the EuroBasket 2007, Turkey played in Group C with Lithuania, Germany and the Czech Republic. Turkey began by losing 86–69 to Lithuania and was then blown out 79–49 by Germany. The team ended group play with an 80–72 win over fellow bottom-of-the-group team Czech Republic. With that win Turkey advanced to the next round, although the team lost all of its games (66–51 to Slovenia, 84–75 to Italy and 85–64 to France) in that phase. The three results eliminated Turkey from the EuroBasket 2007 with an (1–5) record and an 11th-place finish.\nAt the EuroBasket 2009, Turkey played in Group D with hosts Poland, Lithuania and Bulgaria. The Group D matches took place in Wrocław, Poland. Turkey won all three of its group matches and qualified for the second round. Turkey enjoyed a strong start in the second round, as they won their first match against World Champions Spain 63–60; when Ömer Aşık and Ersan İlyasova rejected a last-second shot by Sergio Llull. Turkey then beat Serbia in overtime. Turkey's winning streak came to an end against Slovenia, when, despite a 19-point comeback, Engin Atsür missed a desperation three pointer in a 69–67 loss. In the knockout stage, Turkey were against Greece and lost a close game in overtime, finishing the tournament 8th. Yet, in the same year, Turkey won the bronze medal at the 2009 Mediterranean Games.\n2010s.\nAs the host country, Turkey, led by coach Bogdan Tanjević, automatically qualified for the 2010 FIBA World Cup. Turkey topped their group, winning all of their games against the Ivory Coast, Russia, Greece, Puerto Rico and China. In the knockout stages Turkey managed to defeat France, Slovenia and Serbia in a thrilling semi-final match which Turkey won 83–82. The national team enjoyed their greatest success to date on the international stage going undefeated in group play and progressing to the final, where they eventually lost to the United States to come away with the silver medal. Each player was awarded a prize of 1,500,000 TL (approximately $1,000,000 in September 2010) from the Turkish government for being the runner-up in the competition.\nOrhun Ene, who was the assistant coach of Turkey next to Tanjević and had a successful career as a player, was appointed the head coach to lead Turkey during the EuroBasket 2011. The team had a bad tournament as they got eliminated in the second group phase after losing three straight games. Turkey and Serbia were the only teams that managed to defeat the eventual EuroBasket 2011 champions Spain during the tournament.\nTwo years later, Turkey won their second gold medal at the 2013 Mediterranean Games by defeating Serbia in the final. A few months later at the EuroBasket 2013, Turkey managed to defeat only Sweden, before finishing the competition with a (1–4) record to fail making it out of the group stage.\nOn 22 March 2014, the Turkish Basketball Federation announced that Ergin Ataman would lead Turkey during the 2014 FIBA World Cup, EuroBasket 2015 and the 2016 Summer Olympics. After receiving a wild card bid, Turkey qualified for the 2014 FIBA World Cup. The team was slotted into Group C, to begin their tournament run. Turkey would eventually accumulate a (3–2) record during the group phase to advance into the knockout rounds. In the Round of 16, Turkey earned a hard-fought victory over Australia 65–64. In the quarter-finals, Turkey's tournament appearance would come to an end as the national team fell to Lithuania 73–61.\nAt EuroBasket 2015, Turkey arrived on to the continental stage with confidence, after their solid play at the 2014 FIBA World Cup. Although the team would suffer a setback after getting past the group stage, as they were thoroughly outplayed in their Round of 16 match against France 76–53. After the disappointment for Turkey in 2015, head coach Ergin Ataman still had the responsibility to guide Turkey to the 2016 Olympic Tournament. The national team would once again have a let down, coming away with a (1–2) record during qualifying and being eliminated.\nOn 19 January 2017, Ufuk Sarıca succeeded Ergin Ataman as Turkey's new head coach. Sarıca was among the star players of Efes Pilsen in the 1990s, winning the 1995–96 FIBA Korać Cup and reaching the final of the 1992–93 FIBA Saporta Cup with the Istanbul-based club under head coach Aydın Örs.\nTurkey was named one of four co-hosts for the EuroBasket 2017. However, the national team put up a near identical performance as they did at the 2015 edition. Turkey was knocked out in the Round of 16 both times, although winning one fewer game in 2017.\nIn qualification for Turkey to make it to the 2019 FIBA World Cup, the national team posted an (8–4) record during European Qualifiers to make it to their fifth consecutive World Cup finals appearance. Entering the 2019 FIBA World Cup, Turkey was placed into Group E where they defeated Japan in their first match 86–67. In their next game the national team were up against the United States. In the highly competitive back and forth battle between the two sides that needed overtime to decide a winner, it was the Americans who pulled out the narrow 93–92 victory. After the demoralizing loss, Turkey would go on to lose their final match of the preliminary phase 76–91 to the Czech Republic, which relegated the team to the classification round to finish out the tournament.\nHonours.\nThe Turkish national team's all-time medal record:\nTeam.\nCurrent roster.\nRoster for the EuroBasket 2025 Qualifiers matches on 22 and 25 February 2024 against Italy and

The squad is governed by SBF, and is part of the FIBA Asia zone. Based on the number of overall medals won, Syria is a major force among basketball teams of WABA and ABC. The team has won eight medals at the WABA Championship and five at the Arab Basketball Championship.\nSyria has qualified for the FIBA Asia Cup seven times and one time for EuroBasket throughout their history. Their best tournament result was the 4th place finish at the 2001 FIBA Asia Cup. However, Syria still seeks qualification for their first appearance to the FIBA World Cup and Olympics.\nHistory.\nIt was created in 1948 and is one of the oldest FIBA Asia teams on the continent, although in its first years of existence it only managed to participate in the Pan Arab Games. Syria participated in the EuroBasket 1949, winning only match out of six against Lebanon.\nIts first appearance at the FIBA Asia Championship was at the 1999 edition in Fukuoka, Japan where they finished in eighth place.\nThe team had its best year in 2001, when it finished in the \"Final Four\" of the Asian Basketball Championship in Shanghai, China.\nIn November 2021, FIBA lifted the ban on Syrian stadiums, which was issued due to the war in the country, and therefore for the first time in 10 years, an international match could take place. It took place on November 29, 2021 at the Al-Fayhaa Sports Arena in Damascus, where a men's basketball team played 2023 FIBA World Cup qualification match against Kazakhstan.\nIn early December 2021, the Syrian Basketball Federation confirmed Syria's return to the Arab Nations Championship in the UAE which will take place 9 to 16 February 2022. Syria had been absent from the event for ten years because of the Syrian war.\nCompetition record.\nEuroBasket 1949.\nSyria once appeared at the European championships, namely at the Eurobasket 1949, held in Cairo, Egypt. The refusal of the Soviet Union to host the competition and FIBA Europe's unwillingness to ask Czechoslovakia to host consecutive tournaments meant that 1947 bronze medallist Egypt hosted the competition. Due to travel difficulties and fears, few European teams would travel to the African country to compete. Syria, as well as Lebanon, were asked to compete in the European championship despite being Asian countries.\nIn the seven team round robin tournament, the Syrians finished with a 1–5 record and finished in sixth place.\n4 Shawki, 5 Khayat, 6 Nashawi, 7 Fo.

        "title": "East Bowling",
        "text": "East Bowling is an area of Bradford, West Yorkshire, England located to the south of Bradford city centre. It forms the eastern half of the historic township and manor of Bowling. Bowling became a ward of the newly created Borough of Bradford in 1847. In 1882 the ward was split into the wards of East and West Bowling. In the north the boundary was along the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway. To the south it was along Hall Lane and Bolling Hall Lane.\nThe southern/southeastern boundary follows Rooley Lane and Sticker Lane. The northern boundary follows Bowling Back Lane. East Bowling forms a roughly triangular area with its southern apex near Croft Street about 350m from the city centre. Wakefield Road is its main thoroughfare.\nEast Bowling is now a part of the Bowling and Barkerend ward\nEarly history and topography.\nWilliam Cudworth published his \"History of Bowling\" in 1891. The opening sentence sets out his difficulty. \"In attempting an historical and topographical sketch of the township of Bowling, we are confronted with a .. difficulty .. namely, that no published record previously existed upon which to base our efforts\". Cudworth triumphed over the difficulty. Although subsequent authors have added greater detail his account has never been bettered. It is the main source of information for this section.\nThe township contained 1561 acres. The total acreage of the borough of Bradford at that time was 10,776. Cudworth describes the small becks which drain the area (see Map 1) noting that some do not have definite names. John James in his history of Bradford (1841) has to refer to \" a nameless beck arising to the west of Dudley Hill\" - which is shown in Map 3 contributing water to the Lady Well Pool. This, Bowling Beck and Law Beck (also known as Claw Beck and Low Beck) had leets which sent their water to the Bowling (manorial) corn Mills - which were nevertheless often stopped by shortage of water.\nIn the north, Bowling came within a few hundred yards of the centre of Bradford. This was the lowest point of the township at an altitude of about above sea level. To the south the township boundary followed the watershed between Bradford Dale (draining to the north) and tributaries of the Aire and Calder draining to the south and south west. Map 1 shows that the watershed was at an altitude of at Laisterdyke (in the east) rising to at Odsal Top.\nMost of Bowling was above the 500 ft contour and much of it above the 600 ft contour. The soil cover was boulder clay, unsuitable for arable farming. Altitude and poor soil limited the available crops. Little wheat could be grown. Grains were either barley or oats. Cudworth could find scant evidence that the \"three open field\" system had ever been used in Bowling, though it was a major feature of Bradford, Manningham and Horton. Outside of the parks of Bowling Hall the land was divided into small walled closes in pastoral use, a pattern which had prevailed since ancient times. There was no common land in Bowling, and there had never been an enclosure act.\nReferring to John Smith's estate map of 1776 Cudworth notes that Bowling was almost devoid of trees (apart from some new planting around Bolling Hall) although place names such as Oaks Fold, Oaks Lane, The Parks, Coppice etc. suggested it was once well wooded. Cudworth laments the substitution of \"Bowling\" for \"Bolling\" but is unable to say when it occurred except that it was \"early\". \"If in this sketch we used the modern spelling and pronunciation it will be as a concession to modern notions.\"\n\"In ancient times the township appears to have been known as Great and Little Bolling corresponding probably to the present distinctions of East Bowling and West Bowling which are generally speaking divided by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway\". The distinction long predated the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, opened 1850. The traditional line of demarcation was probably the Bowling Beck and its tributary beck which arose in The Roughs, as shown on maps 1 and 4. This was close to the railway and also the route of the coal tramway from the Burras engine to Britannia Mills staithes, (shown on map 2) opened c 1840. In 1847 Bowling became one of the 8 wards of the newly created Municipal Borough of Bradford. In 1881 Bowling ward was divided into East and West Bowling wards. The ward boundary in the north was the Bowling Beck but in the south was Bolling Hall Road. Colloquial usage still recognised, and still does recognise, the traditional boundary described by Cudworth rather than the administrative boundary of 1881.\n\"The township is well furnished with roads leading from Bradford and passing from north to south but is deficient in means of communication between east and West Bowling. The map of 1757 \"shows Rooley Lane to be the only highway or road from one part of Bowling to the other.\" This remains true in 2014. Rooley Lane was part of the turnpike road from Leeds to Halifax. It was of little use to residents of Bowling. It was one of four turnpike Roads through Bowling\nAll were built in the early 18th century - and were subsequently the scene of protests and riots and breaking down of toll bars. \nThe turnpike roads helped establish Bradford's position as a centre of the textile trades- The Bradford Piece Hall was built in 1770 - but they had little impact on life in Bowling. On the eve of the industrial revolution this still followed a centuries-old pattern of small pastoral farmers supplementing their earnings by home handloom weaving and wool combing and small scale coal mining. Most were tenants. Land ownership was still concentrated in the hands of Wood, the owner of Bolling Hall, who was also Lord of The Manor. In 1780 virtually all the land between Wakefield Road and the boundary with West Bowling belonged to him, besides many parcels in West Bowling. Between Back Lane, Sticker Lane and Wakefield Road Rawson (Lord of the manor of Bradford) was the principal landowner. South of Rooley Lane the principal landowner was Richardson of Bierley Hall. Bierley Church, built on land donated by Richardson, was in East Bowling. In the west of the township were a number of smaller landlords.\nThis pattern of landholding is reflected in the pattern of land use to the current day.\nThe industrial Revolution - coal and iron.\nWilliam Cudworth pointed out that Bradford was \"Ironopolis\" long before it became \"Worstedopolis\". Gary Firth writes\n\"As early as 1796 the Bradford ironworks produced 4,390 tons of Yorkshire's 21,984 tons of pig iron. At the peak of Bradford's coal output in 1866 its forty six collieries produced 1,875,000 tons of coal or twenty per cent of the Yorkshire output of 9,714.000 tons. Thus the economic development of these important and interdependent mineral resources, linked with the advance of cheap water transport, provided Bradford with a broad commercial and financial base upon which to build a new industrial economy in the years after 1800\".\nFor centuries Bradford coal had been mined on a small scale for local consumption. The trigger for expansion was the opening of the Bradford Canal in 1774. With its link to the Leeds and Liverpool canal this opened up markets for coal in Craven and the Aire valley. Abraham Balm, principle proponent of the canal and a major shareholder, owned coal mines in Bowling. By return limestone was transported to Bradford from Skipton, where a branch canal provided a link to the limestone quarries. The limestone was burned and used to improve the poor soils of the district.\nThe trigger for the exploitation of ironstone deposits was knowledge of the use of coke for iron smelting. From the 1780s ironworks were founded in and around Bradford. The Birkinshaw works was established in 1784. The Shelf works was established in 1785, the Bowling iron works was founded in 1787, the Low Moor works in 1788 and the Bierley works in 1810.\nThe imported limestone was essential as a blast furnace flux. The local coal measures contained two very notable seams. The low sulphur better bed coal was used to make a blast furnace coke of very high quality. The black bed coal, 130 feet above it, was a good general purpose coal overlain with seams of ironstone with a 32% iron content. The seat earths of the seams yielded ganister (needed for furnace linings) and fire clay. There were intermediate seams of good brick making clay and building stone.\nThe partnerships which founded the new works had access to large scale capital, scientific knowledge and expert engineers, far beyond the resources of local landowners. They also had the good fortune to enter production at the right time. From 1793 the French wars produced an insatiable government demand for iron and armaments.\nIn 1787 John Sturges and partners acquired the East Bowling estates of Benjamin Rawson. By 1790 they had constructed and brought the Bowling Iron Works into production and were seeking to gain access to additional mineral reserves outside the works boundaries. The first tramway was constructed in 1792.\nIn 1792 Francis Lindley Wood (owner of Bolling Hall and Lord of the manor) attained his majority and proceeded to sink sunk coal mines on his estates. He delegated management of the mines to his energetic land agent, Isaac Wells. Isaac Wells only operated the New Heigh pit directly (It provided Sir Francis with a profit of £1200 pa.) and sub let other mines to \"pit takers\". In 1794 Sir Francis leased 93 acres of ironstone in Hall Lane to the Bowling Iron works. He subsequently leased mining rights on other parts of his estate. In 1801 mining activity had encroached on his house of Bolling Hall and disliking the despoiled landscape he decided to move to another of his houses at Hemsworth, leaving his Bradford affairs in the hands of Isaac Wells. From 1803 most of the mineral rights of Sir Francis's estates were leased or sold piecemeal to the Bowling Iron Works. In February 1816 he sold all his remaining landholdings and mineral rights in Bowling and Bradford to the iron works. In 1821 the ironworks also bought the lordship of the manor with the manorial lands and mineral rights. The Ironworks thus became the dominant landowner in East Bowling - owning nearly all of it - and the major landowner in West Bowling.\nThroughout the 19th century the ironworks expanded its mining operations - and in the process developed an extensive network of tramways and narrow gauge railways from its mines to the iron works and also to staithes in Bradford. (see map 2) From 1850 these were extended across the watershed to access to reserves to the south of Bradford. The ironworks eventually had collieries as far south as Gomersal and Cleckheaton and over 20 miles of tramway. In 1854 the \"Bradford Avoiding Line\" was built by the GNR to link its Leed-Bradford railway via a junction at Hammerton Street to the L&amp;YR line to the south of Bowling Tunnel. Later that year the Bowling Ironworks opened an extensive set of standard gauge private lines and sidings with a junction to the \"Avoiding Line\" at Bowling Bridge station, making the works much less dependent on its tramways and canal transport.\nFrom about 1850 reserves in Bowling were becoming exhausted and some landholdings were sold off. This process was not straight forward as mining had rendered much of the surface too unstable for building development. Map 3 shows an area near the Parks which was so unstable it remained undeveloped until the very end of the 20th century and which still (2014) suffers from periodic shaft collapses. One of the most important land sales occurred in 1849 when Messrs Ripley and Son of the Bowling dye works purchased the freehold of the site, about 100 acres of land surrounding it (later expanded to 130 acres) and the pumping shafts of several former collieries. The pumping shafts provided a constant supply of high quality soft water to the dye works of 1.25million gallons per day with a surplus of about 0.6 million gallons per day which was distributed via Ripley's water works to domestic and other industrial consumers. At that date the Bradford Waterworks company (purchased by the Borough Council in 1854) could only provide a very intermittent supply of about 0.5 million gallons per day. In 1854, the dye works, like the ironworks built its own standard gauge internal private railway with a junction with the GNR near Hall Lane.\nIn addition to scattering the landscape with spoil heaps and rendering the ground too unstable for building the ironworks had a disastrous effect on the atmosphere. A constant pall of smoke and foul smelling fumes hung over the works and surrounding area \"The Bowling Hell\" with a high incidence of respiratory diseases. Within the works a huge smoking spoil heap \"the Bowling Coke Hill\" grew continuously until the ironworks ceased production in 1906. It continued to burn and smoke for many years. It towered nearly 250feet above Wakefield Road and dwarfed the nearby St John's church. In the second world war an anti aircraft bunker was built on its summit. It was not cleared until the late 1950s when Hepworth and Grandages acquired the site and levelled it to expand their engineering works. The iron works also used the area north of Lower Lane as additional tipping space; eventually it was covered by a plateau of slag and clinker about 50 feet deep. Clearance for re-development has only recently started. Map 4 shows the locations of these sites.\nDemographics.\nEast Bowling is ethnically diverse, including South Asian residents.\nHouses and land use in the 21st century.\nMost of the 19th century and earlier housing of East Bowling was demolished under the 1951 \"Bradford Development Plan\". The existing housing stock in the area is mainly late Victorian and early 20th century Terrace houses, built between 1895 and 1914, with some more modern houses. Most of these houses are concentrated in the relatively small area between Wakefield Road and Bowling Hall Road and between Paley Road in the north and Lister Avenue in the south. The area was developed at a time when the city was thriving and it was a quite well-to-do part of Bradford. In recent years East Bowling has become rather run-down.\nThere are smaller but more recently built concentrations of houses in two other areas; between Fenby Avenue and Wakefield Road and between Broad Lane and Wellington Street in the Cutler Heights area.\nMost land in East Bowling is either in commercial or industrial use A significant area on Lower Lane is unused brownfield land: it was originally used by the Bowling Iron Works as a slag and cinder tip. Bowling Park and the adjacent \"green area\" of allotments and sports fields are mostly in East Bowling but the Park also has a main gate to New Cross Street - easily accessible to East Bowling residents.\nLandmarks.\nIn the centre of East Bowling is Bowling Park, Bradford with its fossil tree, and the nearby Bolling Hall museum. Bowling Cemetery is situated to the south on the ring road.\nChurches of several faiths fall within the area. These include St John's Anglican, and New Hey Road Methodist.\nSt. Ann's Roman Catholic Church was closed in 1996 and the parish amalgamated with St Joseph, Manchester Road.\nSt Ann's was the centre of the Irish community of Broomfields, once one of the most densely populated areas of Bradford and with some of the worst slums. By contrast in the north of Broomfields was the model village of Ripley Ville with spacious four bedroom houses for the upper levels of the working classes.\nPictures of East Bowling \nTransport links.\nEast Bowling lies approximately 1 mile north-east from the end of the M606 motorway. \nPublic Transport is provided by the 635 TLC Transport service to and from Bradford Interchange, also connecting with Morrisons Supermarket, Mayo Avenue (BD5), and in the evenings, First Bradford service 621 to Haworth Road via Bradford City Centre."

        "title": "George Thomas (baseball)",
        "text": "George Edward Thomas Jr. (born November 29, 1937) is a retired American professional baseball player. Primarily an outfielder, he played at least one game at every position except pitcher during a 13-year career in Major League Baseball for the Detroit Tigers (1957–58; 1961; 1963–65), Los Angeles Angels (1961–63), Boston Red Sox (1966–71) and Minnesota Twins (1971). He also was an assistant coach (1972–78) and head baseball coach (1979–81) at his alma mater, the University of Minnesota, after his active career ended. The native of Minneapolis threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed .\nPlaying career.\nThomas signed a $25,000 bonus contract with the Tigers in 1957 after playing one season of varsity baseball with the University of Minnesota. Prohibited by the bonus rule of the time from being sent to the minor leagues, he appeared in only one big-league game in his first pro season, striking out as a pinch hitter against Ted Abernathy of the Washington Senators on September 11, 1957. Inserted into the game at third base, he made an error on his only fielding chance, but the miscue and the unearned run it produced were harmless, as Detroit won, 12–2. Thomas then spent most of 1958 and all of 1959–60 in the Tigers' farm system, rapidly rising from Class B to Triple-A.\nThomas made the 1961 Tigers' roster out of spring training, but he appeared in only 17 games, with only six at bats, for the contending Tigers and his contract was sold to the Angels, then a first-year expansion team, on June 26. Given the chance to play frequently (he started 38 games as an outfielder and 35 more at third base), Thomas hit 13 home runs, collected 79 hits and hit .280 in a Los Angeles uniform. During the off-season, he was called to United States Army service, and he missed spring training and the first months of the season. He returned to the Angel lineup on July 29, going two for four against his old Detroit teammates and hitting a home run off Frank Lary. But Thomas slumped to .238 in 56 games for the rest of 1962, and was batting only .210 in 53 games for the Angels in when he was sent back to the Tigers at the June 15 trading deadline for pitcher Paul Foytack and utilityman Frank Kostro. He played sparingly for Detroit, mostly spelling veteran Bill Bruton in center field for the rest of 1963.\nSplitting the Tigers' center-field job with Bruton and Don Demeter in , Thomas reached a personal best in hits (88) and batted a career-high .286. But his playing time diminished in , his average sank to .213, and on October 4 he was traded to the Red Sox with second baseman George Smith and a player to be named later (catcher Jackie Moore) for pitcher Bill Monbouquette. Thomas platooned in center field with the left-handed Jim Gosger during the season's early weeks, but his average dipped below .200 on May 17, Demeter was acquired from the Tigers to play center field in June, and Thomas reverted to a backup role. A strong September lifted his average to .237, but his MLB career as a starting player was over. He appeared in all or parts of five more MLB seasons, but never started more than 15 games.\nHowever, Thomas was a utility man and pinch hitter on the 1967 \"Impossible Dream\" Red Sox, appearing in 65 games, including 43 in the outfield, three at third base and one as a catcher. He also appeared in the 1967 World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, striking out as a pinch hitter against Nelson Briles in game 3 and grounding out in game 6 against Hal Woodeshick after entering the contest as a defensive replacement in right field. St. Louis won the series in seven games. He then spent most of in Triple-A, but after his recall to the Red Sox in September, he got into three more full seasons in the Majors from 1969 to 1971. He was briefly listed as a coach for the Red Sox in 1969 and 1970 before returning to active status, and finished his career with his hometown Twins after Boston released him, June 28, 1971.\nIn his 685-game big-league career, Thomas collected 430 hits, including 71 doubles, nine triples and 46 home runs. He batted .255.\nCollege coach.\nAfter drawing his release from the Twins on October 27, 1971, Thomas—who had also attended Wayne State University in Michigan during his tenure with the Tigers—returned to the University of Minnesota as assistant baseball coach for seven years. Then he became head baseball coach in 1979, and led the Golden Gophers to a 95–43 (.688) win–loss record over three seasons. His last team won a Big Ten Conference divisional championship and a berth in the 1981 NCAA Division I baseball tournament.\nExternal links.\n "

        "text": "The FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup is a biennial international women's association football tournament for female players under the age of 17. It is organized by \"Fédération Internationale de Football Association\" (FIFA) since 2008. The current champions are Spain, who won its second title at the 2022 edition in India.\nHistory.\nIn 2003, after the inaugural success of the 2002 FIFA U-19 Women's World Championship, held in Canada, FIFA proposed adding a second youth tournament for girls. Continental confederations told FIFA it would be difficult to create a second championship, with the age limits in place at the time. Therefore, FIFA created the U-17 Women's World Cup and the U-20 Women's World Championship (renamed the \"U-20 Women's World Cup\" in 2007), the same age groups as its men's youth tournaments. Accordingly, the age limit for the U-19 championship was increased to 20, effective with the 2006 FIFA U-20 Women's World Championship in Russia. FIFA committed to creating a U-17 women's championship, stated to begin in 2008.\nThe first tournament was held in 2008 in New Zealand from 28 October to 16 November. Four cities hosted matches during the inaugural tournament – North Shore City (North Harbour Stadium), Hamilton (Waikato Stadium), Wellington (Wellington Stadium) and Christchurch (QEII Park). New Zealand won hosting rights at the same time that Chile received hosting honours for the 2008 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup; Ecuador also bid for the event.\nOn 4 April 2020, FIFA announced the decision of postponing the 2020 World Cup which was originally scheduled in five venues to be held from 2 to 21 November in India. The tournament was initially postponed to 2021, subject to further monitoring. On 17 November 2020, FIFA announced that the 2020 edition of the tournamenth would be cancelled, and India were appointed as hosts of the next edition of the tournament in 2022. However, on 16 August 2022, India were stripped of their hosting rights for 2022 as the All India Football Federation was suspended by FIFA. The rights were given back to India on 26 August 2022 as the AIFF was reinstated by FIFA.\nDominican Republic was selected as host for the 2024 edition on 23 June 2023.\nStarting from 2025 the U-17 Women's World Cup and its men's counterpart will be held annually, with the women's tournament it takes effect from 2029 onwards. Morocco was selected to host these edition on 14 March 2024 becoming the first African country to host the event.\nQualification.\nQualifying tournaments are:\nOverall team records.\nIn this ranking 3 points are awarded for a win, 1 for a draw and 0 for a loss. As per statistical convention in football, matches decided in extra time are counted as wins and losses, while matches decided by penalty shoot-outs are counted as draws. Teams are ranked by total points, then by goal difference, then by goals scored.\nComprehensive team results by tournament.\nFor each tournament, the flag of the host country and the number of teams in each finals tournament (in brackets) are shown.\nResults by confederation.\n — Hosting confederation"

        "title": "2005–06 Australian cricket season",
        "text": "The 2005–06 Australian cricket season took place from October 2005 to March 2006.\nEvents.\nThe 2005–06 Australian cricket season began on 2005-10-05 with the first official ICC Super Series match, and the home season lasted until 2006-03-27 when the Pura Cup final concluded. The national team are, however, playing away matches until 2006-04-28. Australia played six home Tests during this season – three against West Indies and three against South Africa – and also hosted the three-team VB Series, between Australia, South Africa and Sri Lanka. The team also toured New Zealand for One Day Internationals in December, played five ODIs and three Tests in South Africa in February and March, and visited Bangladesh for the first time in April. Also, the season included a new domestic competition, for the first time in 36 seasons – a Twenty20 tournament called the Twenty20 Big Bash was held in January 2006, with two groups of three teams and the group winners proceeding to the final.\nAustralia won both their home Test series in November and December, winning the Frank Worrell Trophy by virtue of a 3–0 whitewash of the West Indies before defeating South Africa 2–0. Meanwhile, in domestic cricket, New South Wales Blues assumed the ascendancy in both competitions, followed by the Victorian Bushrangers; at the beginning of the New Year, the Blues were four points ahead of the Bushrangers in the Pura Cup, and six points ahead in the ING Cup. The Blues beat the Bushrangers in a top-of-the-table battle in the ING Cup on 2 January, leaving the Bushrangers eleven points adrift in second place, but the Bushrangers came back later in the month with three unbeaten matches against the Blues in the space of a week; a win in the ING, was followed up with a draw with first-innings points in the Pura and finally a win in the Twenty20 Big Bash final.\nThe Blues only won two matches from then on, falling all the way to last place in the Pura Cup, but one of the two ING Cup wins was a one-wicket win in the final against the Southern Redbacks, which secured them one title for this season as well. Australia came from one match down in the three-match final of the VB Series to beat Sri Lanka 2–1, and shortly afterwards began their winter tour of South Africa. South Africa won the Twenty20 International and the first two One-day Internationals, but Australia came back to 2–2, before the fifth match where the record for highest team total was broken twice. South Africa won that, but were brought down in the Tests, where Australia won the first and declared in the second.\nThe Pura Cup was rounded off in March; Queensland Bulls qualified for their eighth successive final with a match to spare, while the Bushrangers and the Warriors fought for the last spot at the Junction Oval. The Bushrangers successively chased 360 in that game to book their ticket for Brisbane and the final, where they conceded 900 runs in the first innings to lose by an innings and 354 runs.\nRoll of honour.\nTest series:\nODI series:\nTwenty20 International:\nPura Cup:\nING Cup:\nKFC Twenty20 Big Bash:\nWomen's Test:\nWomen's ODIs:\nWomen's National League:\nOctober.\nSuper Series ODIs.\nThe first official match of the season was held on 5 October at the Telstra Dome between the ICC World XI and Australia, although there had been a one-day friendly match between the World XI and Victoria which did not have List A status three days earlier, and the Cricket Australia Cup begun on 26 September. The first ODI was won by Australia, who bowled the World XI out for 162 to win the first match by 93 runs, and on the second ground in the second ODI they batted to 328 for 4 on their way to a 55-run win and securing a series victory. The final, dead-rubber match was also played at the Telstra Dome, and once again Australia batted first, making 293 for 5 before bowling the World XI out for 137.\nSupertest.\nThe domestic competitions began on 14 October, with Queensland Bulls losing the first game as they posted 99 in reply to the NSW Blues' total of 243 for 7 in the one-day ING Cup, at the same day as the six-day Supertest between Australia and the World XI began at the SCG. Australia took care of the Supertest as well – after making their way to 260 for 4 due to 111 from Matthew Hayden, Adam Gilchrist continued with 94 as Australia posted 345. The Aussies then dismissed six men in single figures, as the World XI were bowled out for 190 – Virender Sehwag making 76, while spinners Shane Warne and Stuart MacGill shared seven wickets – but Hayden and Ricky Ponting added 122 for the second wicket, and though Australia lost their last eight wickets for 47 runs, the World XI were set a target of 355 to win. Five World batsmen were then dismissed for ducks, MacGill took five for 43, and Australia completed a whitewash of the World XI with their 210-run win.\nPura Cup begins, and first full ING round.\nOn 17 October, the Pura Cup began, with the Bulls taking on the Tasmanian Tigers. Tasmania were effectively 17 for 7 in the second innings when rain intervened, ending the match in a draw. A day later, Victorian Bushrangers completed a four-wicket victory at the WACA Ground to go top of the Pura Cup table. The week-end from 22 to 23 October saw a full round of ING Cup games, the Blues beating the Southern Redbacks to go top of the table, while the Bulls and the Western Warriors also chased down targets to record wins.\nLast week of October.\nOne Pura Cup game was played in the last week of October, the Blues facing the Redbacks at the Sydney Cricket Ground, and New South Wales prevailed for their fourth win of the season. They declared twice – in the first innings at 515 for 9, in the second at 187 for 2 – and took the 20 required wickets to win by 187 runs. The West Indies also started their tour with a drawn first-class match against the Bulls, where Marlon Samuels hit a career-best 257 before taking five for 87 in the second innings. Queensland led by 89 with one wicket in hand when the match ended.\nThe final matches of October saw the Bushrangers face the Warriors for the third time of the month, this time for an ING Cup clash at the Junction Oval in Melbourne, and the Bushrangers took advantage of home soil to win by eight wickets to go second in the table behind the Blues, whose one-day match with the Tigers was rained off.\nNovember.\nFirst Test v WI.\nThe first match in November was the Test match between Australia and the West Indies at the Brisbane Cricket Ground, which began on 3 November, and after a hundred in each innings from Australian captain Ricky Ponting, and five-wicket-hauls from Shane Warne (first innings) and Brett Lee (second innings), Australia hauled home a 379-run win. While the Test was on, the Redbacks recorded their first win of the season, beating the Bulls in the ING Cup after an unbeaten 109 from Mark Cosgrove, while the Blues' total of 309 for 8 was enough to beat the Warriors and widen the top-of-the-table in the other match on 4 November. The women's National Cricket League began the following day, with Southern Scorpions overcoming Queensland Fire, though the Scorpions' captain and number three batter, Karen Rolton, was dismissed for a golden duck. The following day, Rolton made 151 off 144 balls in chase of 254 in 50 overs, but the Scorpions still finished on 247 for 8 after Kirsten Pike took three wickets for the Fire.\nDomestic matches, first half of November.\nThe Tigers and the Bushrangers also began a Pura Cup game on 4 November – the Tigers took a 180-run lead on first innings and forced the Bushrangers to follow on, but the Bushrangers turned the game around to win by 109 runs and went first in the Pura Cup table. NSW regained the Pura Cup ascendancy two days later, however, completing a victory at the Warriors' ground as they chased 88 to win by eight wickets despite a second-innings 161 from Western Australia's Chris Rogers. On the same day, the Bulls completed their second draw of the season against the Redbacks, in a match where nearly two days' play were lost to rain. Two days later, on 11 November, Victorian Bushrangers began a three-day tour match with the West Indies – it was drawn, as each team only completed one of two innings, with Victoria making 571 in their 122.4 overs. The West Indies were bowled out for 302 in the reply. The teams agreed to play a Twenty20 match at the end of the match, which Victoria won in the last over, despite six sixes and a 40-ball 81 from West Indian batsman Dwayne Smith.\nIn the ING Cup, the Warriors recorded a win to go second in the table, while the Bulls followed in third after they became the first team to beat the Blues in the season – despite 152 not out from Blues' opener Phil Jaques, the Bulls had Clinton Perren and Matthew Hayden respond with a 113-run second wicket stand on their way to a three-wicket win. The Warriors went straight from ING Cup success to Pura Cup disappointment – their third loss in a row in that competition came at the Redbacks, who won by 129 runs after Darren Lehmann hit a career-best 301 not out to send the Redbacks to a first-innings total of 552 for 7 declared. The Redbacks did not enforce the follow on after bowling them out 271 behind, but after setting a target of 411 in three and a half sessions, Dan Cullen took five for 92 to help bowl out the Warriors for a total of 271. Warriors wicket-keeper Ryan Campbell hit 186 runs in two innings in the match.\nSecond Test.\nThe second Test began on 17 November, and this time the West Indies lasted all five days – one more than in Brisbane – despite falling for 149 in two sessions after choosing to bat. Matthew Hayden and Mike Hussey put on 231 for the first wicket, as Australia made 406, and the West Indies were 140 for 6 midway through the morning session on day four. Then Dwayne Bravo hit his highest Test score thus far with 113, and with the help of wicket-keeper Denesh Ramdin who made a career-best 71 and shared a 182-run stand with Bravo, he helped the West Indies to set a target of 78. Australia lost one wicket in the chase, that of Hayden, who was caught for 46 in the over before Hussey ended the match.\nPura Cup Week Four.\nIn the Pura Cup, the Blues took care of the Tigers inside three days, posting 522 for 9 declared before Stuart Clark took six wickets as Tasmania were bowled out for 294 and 138 in an innings-and-90-run defeat. Queensland also got their first win of the season, rain staying away from the 'Gabba as Queensland recovered from a 28-run first-innings deficit against the Bushrangers to make 405 in the second innings, before Michael Kasprowicz got the best first-class bowling figures in Australia all season with eight for 44. Victoria were bowled out for 155, despite number three Lloyd Mash making 83 in his second first-class match. The weekend also saw four matches in the women's National League, the Southern Scorpions and the Victoria Spirit winning one match each, while the NSW Breakers started the season unbeaten with two wins over Western Fury.\nThird Test.\nThe last ING Cup match of the month was on 25 November between the Warriors and the Tigers at the WACA Ground, a match that was decided on the last ball – the Warriors batted to 262 for 7 after 72 from Chris Rogers and 66 from Shaun Marsh, but Michael Di Venuto hit a hundred for the Tigers, before three wickets fell for 21 to leave the Tigers at 255 for 7 with an over to spare. After two runs came off the first four deliveries, Scott Kremerskothen hit Steve Magoffin for four off the penultimate ball before taking two off the last to win the game. On the same day, West Indies batsman Brian Lara hit 202 unbeaten runs in the third and final Test to become the second batsman to pass 11,000 Test runs, and he broke Allan Border's Test record of most runs on the following day, making 226 out of the West Indies total of 405. However, Australia replied with 428 after Hussey hit another century, and despite the efforts of Bravo (six for 84 in the first innings, 64 with the bat in the second), West Indies lost by seven wickets after Warne took six wickets in the West Indies' second innings and Hayden hit an unbeaten 87 to take Australia to the target and the whitewash.\nPura Cup Week Five.\nMichael Clarke had been dropped from the Australian team, but responded to the selectors with 201 not out for the NSW Blues in a rain-hit game with the Bulls at the SCG, which ended in a draw, the Bulls' third of the season. The Redbacks also had the help of a dropped Test player as they climbed to third place – Jason Gillespie took seven wickets in the first innings, and nine for 125 in total, before half-centuries from Matthew Elliott and Callum Ferguson gave the Redbacks a win in the final session. The last match of the month was in the Pura Cup, where the Warriors batted first against the Tigers and took a 171-run first-innings lead to take their first points of the season, before being bundled out for 176 in the second innings and losing by two wickets after George Bailey made a century and the Tigers made it to eight for 348 – their highest total thus far in the season.\nDecember.\nChappell–Hadlee Trophy.\nAustralia's national team travelled to New Zealand for a one-week, three-match ODI series called the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy – at the first match in Auckland, Australia made eight for 252 after Ricky Ponting and Simon Katich hit half-centuries, and though the opposing captain Daniel Vettori took two wickets and let away 29 runs in ten overs (the third-most economical bowler in the match), it was Australian bowler Brett Lee who became Man of the Match due to his bowling. He bowled four maidens with the new ball, taking three wickets for five runs including both the Marshall twins, Hamish and James, and ended with the bowling analysis of 6–4–5–3. Stuart Clark, playing in his second One-day International, got three for 19, and New Zealand were bowled out for 105 in a 147-run loss.\nThe first match of December was an ING Cup match between the Redbacks and the Bushrangers. The Bushrangers could go second in the table with a win, but after rain delayed the start for 90 minutes and shortened both teams' innings to 41 overs, spinners Dan Cullen and Darren Lehmann shared seven wickets and limited the Bushrangers to a total of eight for 204 in their rain-shortened innings. Michael Klinger notched up 103, the Bushrangers' first one-day century of the season, but Greg Blewett and Mark Cosgrove shared an unbeaten 143-run partnership for the third wicket to guide the Redbacks home after two wickets from Peter Siddle had seen the Redbacks to two for 62. In the women's league, the Breakers extended their run of victories to four, while one bonus point and a win in the first match against Western Fury was enough to see Victoria Spirit into the second place, despite losing the second match.\nSouth Africans arrive.\nSouth Africa began their tour of Australia on 5 December, 11 days before the first Test match, with a three-day tour match against Western Australia. After a century from Adam Voges, the Warriors declared on eight for 391, before bowling out South Africa from 179 and 164 in their two innings to take the win by an innings and 48 runs. Meanwhile, the Blues travelled to Victoria and the Bushrangers for a Pura Cup match scheduled to start on 6 December, but heavy rain in Melbourne saw the first day's play called off. After play started at 2pm on the second day, Phil Jaques hit 124 not out as the Blues closed on two for 217, but after he was dismissed no Blues batsman made 25, and the Blues lost their last eight wickets for 80, Allen Wise taking a career-best six for 89 along the way. The Bushrangers then had four top-order batsmen hit half-centuries, and Test bowler MacGill bowled 22 wicketless overs as the Bushrangers racked up a first-innings lead, making 462. Six batsmen were then dismissed for sub-15 scores, with Shane Harwood notching up four scalps and Wise two, but Brad Haddin hung on to make 71 not out, and Matt Nicholson batted with him for 90 minutes for 9 to see the Blues close on seven for 139 and draw the game.\nEnd of New Zealand tour.\nThe final two ODIs of the Chappell–Hadlee Trophy saw four team scores above 320, and a record chase in the final dead rubber match. The second match between Australia and New Zealand saw Australia bat first, and after Australia had been four for 101 after Simon Katich was run out, an Australian record partnership between Michael Clarke and Andrew Symonds followed. The pair who added 220 for the fifth wicket, Symonds hitting eight sixes and twelve fours on his way to a record score in ODIs between the two sides. His 156 was the third-highest by an Australian against any opponent, and the stand with Clarke paved the way for a total of 322 for 5. New Zealand needed 53 from the last 33 balls, and New Zealand still needed 24 off the final two overs. However, Brett Lee's penultimate over yielded 18 runs, as Brett Lee bowled a no-ball and a wide, and another ball was adjudged a no-ball as Australia had too few players inside the circle. Mick Lewis was left to bowl the last over, and with six runs required the last two batsmen were run out, leaving New Zealand on 320 – two runs short of victory. Australia thus won the Chappell–Hadlee Trophy with a match to spare.\nA warm-up match without List A status saw South Africa beat the Cricket Australia Chairman's XI at Lilac Hill, with medium pacer Garnett Kruger taking four wickets and Herschelle Gibbs hitting an unbeaten 91 in the chase. A day later, in the last match of the Chappell–Hadlee Trophy, Mitchell Johnson was given his debut as Super Sub, coming in after Australia had batted to seven for 331 with four half-centuries. Johnson bowled nine overs for 64, without taking a wicket, and Scott Styris hit a hundred as New Zealand chased down the target for the highest successful run chase in ODI cricket thus far. Meanwhile, in the ING Cup, the Redbacks went second after beating the Tigers, former Test bowler Jason Gillespie making up for his wicketless match by taking part in an unbeaten eight-wicket stand of 34 to see the Redbacks to the target, and in the final match of the week the Bushrangers, including Shane Warne, beat the Bulls after Grant Lindsay had taken three wickets and the Bulls were bowled out for 185, Liam Buchanan and David Hussey hit half-centuries and the Bushrangers won by five wickets, taking a bonus point.\nThird week of December.\nThe third match of the South Africans' tour was also against Western Australia, but this time against a team containing only two of the players they had played the previous week, and none of the players that had players the Warriors' recent Pura Cup game. South Africa still failed to win, and conceded an eight-run first innings deficit in a drawn game. Meanwhile, in the Pura Cup, the Tigers batted to six for 311 on the first day against the Redbacks, with 292 of the runs coming in a fourth-wicket stand between Travis Birt (who made 140) and George Bailey (155). Sean Clingeleffer also made a half-century, as the Tigers declared on eight for 421, but the Redbacks batted to a total of 638 after five batsmen passed 50 and eight passed 30. The Tigers, however, batted to four for 291 and a draw, as opener David Dawson batted for six and a half hours for 144 not out, a career best score and his second century in 14 first-class games.\nLast matches before Christmas.\nAustralia went into the Test at the WACA Ground as favourites, but still conceded a first innings lead, before Brad Hodge scored a maiden Test century in the second innings. He went on to convert it to a double, ending with 203 not out, and Australia declared on eight for 528. South Africa were left to chase 491 for the victory, or bat for four sessions for the draw; the latter was achieved and the teams would go into the Boxing Day Test with the series tied at 0–0. The Melbourne Herald Sun claimed that the Australian captain Ponting \"was dealing with one of the biggest blunders of his career\", after Australia failed to win the match.\nWith the Warriors out of their own stadium due to the Test match, they travelled east to Queensland and the Gabba, where Brett Dorey and Beau Casson helped them restrict the Bulls while in the field. In the first innings, Dorey bowled the most of any Warriors bowler, and in his 31 overs he took a career-best seven for 87. The Bulls lost their last eight wickets for 116, but still posted 308 after a century from opener Lachlan Stevens, his first ton in first-class cricket. Another seven-for came in the Warriors' innings, when the Bulls' Michael Kasprowicz took seven for 103, as the Warriors lost their last eight wickets for 114, two less than Queensland. However, with three half-centuries from Clinton Heron, Marcus North and Damien Martyn having sent the Warriors to three for 217, they took a lead of 23. The Bulls were then bowled out for 242, spinner Casson taking five for 88 including two ducks, but with the seventh ball of the Warriors' innings they lost Chris Rogers for three, and after Clint Heron hit a half-century, seven balls from Andy Bichel yielded three wickets and sent the Warriors from 129 for 3 to 130 for 6. Bichel then held a catch at gully to dismiss Campbell, but with 47 required and three wickets in hand, Sean Marsh and Dorey combined to give the Warriors the winning runs.\nThere were four matches in the Women's National League this weekend; New South Wales and South Australia won one each of the two matches played at Newcastle, with Karen Rolton hitting an unbeaten 141 in the second match for the Southern Scorpions, while Queensland Fire won both matches against Western Fury. Two ING Cup matches were also played out on 18 December; the Bushrangers chased down a target of 247 set by the Tigers after David Hussey and Cameron White shared a fourth-wicket stand of 162, while Phil Jaques hit an unbeaten 158, a career-best in List A cricket, to give the Blues a total of 282 for 4 before Stuart Clark (7.3–0–36–4) and Michael Clarke (8–0–27–3) helped to bowl out the Redbacks for 209, which gave the Blues a 73-run win and five points in this top-of-the-table battle. The Blues now had a seven-point lead over the second-placed Bushrangers. Four days later, the round of games was completed, with the Warriors posting 226 against the Bulls after Damien Martyn, Marcus North and Dave Bandy hit half-centuries. Pete Worthington then claimed the first five wickets, as the Bulls were five for 113, and they eventually needed ten off the last over. However, Chris Hartley hit a six off the first ball, and with two needed to win off three balls he hit another six to secure the victory.\nBoxing Day Test.\nThe second Test began at Melbourne Cricket Ground on 26 December, Boxing Day, with Australia batting to two for 154 before Shaun Pollock and André Nel started taking wickets; Nel finished with bowling figures on the day of four for 58 as Australia lost seven wickets for 96 and were nine for 248. However, 107 runs were added between Mike Hussey and Glenn McGrath for the tenth wicket, a record in Australia–South Africa Tests , and Australia took a lead of 44 on first innings. A century from Matthew Hayden and 72 off 54 balls from Andrew Symonds gave Australia a total of seven for 321 before they declared, and South Africa were bowled out for 181, with Shane Warne taking four second-innings wickets.\nJanuary.\nFinal Test.\nSouth Africa came back from their deficit to be in the advantage, according to Cricinfo commentator Peter English , on the second day of the third Test at Sydney. Jacques Kallis and Ashwell Prince broke an 80-year-old record for the highest fourth-wicket partnership for South Africa against Australia. Ricky Ponting then scored a century to bring Australia within 97 runs of South Africa, and rain cut 70 overs off the fourth day before South Africa declared 286 runs ahead midway through the morning session on the fifth. Ponting then hit another century, becoming the first batsman to hit centuries in both innings of his 100th Test, and guided Australia to an eight-wicket win.\nMeanwhile, in the ING Cup, the Blues defended a total of 259 to beat the Bushrangers in the top of the table clash despite an unbeaten 123 from Michael Klinger, as spinner and former Test player Michael Clarke took three for 20, while the Bulls failed to take the opportunity to go into second place as they were limited to nine for 186 by the Tigers, who proceeded to chase down the target in the very last over after a sixth-wicket stand worth 100 between Michael Bevan and 21-year-old wicket-keeper Tim Paine.\nTwenty20 Big Bash.\nThe group stage of this tournament began on 6 January and ran until 10 January, three days before the VB Series began. The Bulls opened against the Tigers at the Gabba in the first group, losing their first four wickets inside five overs with Ben Hilfenhaus taking two, but a 79-run partnership between Jimmy Maher and Steve Paulsen took the Bulls past the 15-over mark. Hilfenhaus got another wicket, ending with three for 17, and Paulsen was caught off the very last ball to end with 45 of the Bulls' total of seven for 136. In the fourth over of the Tigers' innings, heavy rain stopped play with the score on one for 15, and play was not restarted. In Group A, the Bushrangers batted to nine for 163 in 20 overs, though the Warriors' Ben Edmondson conceded only 16 in his four overs, taking three wickets. Cameron White and Liam Buchanan then put on 69 for the fourth wicket, and the last 43 balls yielded 74 runs for the Bushrangers. Adam Voges made a half-century, but after three run outs the Warriors needed eight off the last five balls. They got five, thus losing by two runs.\nBetween the first and second round of Twenty20 matches, there were two women's games between Victoria Spirit and New South Wales Breakers in Melbourne. New South Wales won them both to end with seven wins, while Victoria fell down to fourth place in the table after the two defeats.\nThe Bushrangers made it two from two and qualified for the final two days later, after bowling the Redbacks out for 113 with Shane Harwood getting the best figures with three for 13. 14 extras and an unbeaten 41 from Jonathan Moss took the Bushrangers past the target in 12.1 of the allotted 20 overs. In the other group, the Bulls hit at a rate of 9.5 runs an over against the Blues, but were bowled out 15 balls before the end to end with a total of 167. Ian Moran took three for 21 for the Blues, getting numbers 6, 7 and 8 out, and also hit 12 not out in the chase. David Thornely shared a 59-run sixth-wicket stand with Moran to see the Blues to the target with two overs and five wickets to spare.\nOn 10 January, the Warriors and the Redbacks played out a match which had little significance, as the Bushrangers had already qualified from the group, yet 15,000 people came to the WACA Ground. They saw the home side bat to six for 174 after opener Ryan Campbell made a half-century, before the Redbacks lost their first five wickets for 33. Ken Skewes and Shane Deitz added 38 for the sixth wicket, before Dave Bandy and Campbell shared four of the last five wickets to bowl the Redbacks out for 120. In the other match, a virtual semi-final, Phil Jaques hit 61 off 30 balls for the Blues, the highest contribution to the Blues' total of six for 188. Adam Polkinghorne took three for 31 for the Tigers, but made 13 runs in the reply, as six Blues' bowlers got a wicket and helped bowl out the Tigers for 119 to send the Blues to the final meeting with the Bushrangers.\nVB Series Warm-ups.\nThe South Africans scored almost twice as much as the Bulls in their warm-up match, as Boeta Dippenaar and Jacques Rudolph outscored Queensland's first eight partnerships. The two added 88 for the fourth wicket, helping to total 205, and Garnett Kruger and Shaun Pollock then shared six wickets with the first 61 balls of the match. Eventually, Queensland were bowled out for 111. The following day, the Bushrangers bowled out Sri Lanka for 120, with Allan Wise taking five for 25, before Michael Klinger hit a half-century and Victoria won with seven wickets and 15.4 overs to spare, and in a final warm-up the South Africans beat the Queensland Academy by 46 runs after 80 from Jacques Kallis.\nAustralia's first home loss.\nFive matches were played from Friday to Sunday; the VB Series began with two matches, while a full round of ING Cup matches was played on the Saturday. On Friday the 13th, Australia beat Sri Lanka by 116 runs in the tri-series opener, with Sri Lanka's two most experienced bowlers, Chaminda Vaas and Muttiah Muralitharan, yielding combined bowling figures of 20–1–140–0, while in the ING Cup, the Warriors won and earned a bonus point at home after chasing down 198 to win in the fortieth over, with Justin Langer getting a half-century. The following day, the Bushrangers beat the Blues to cut the deficit at the top of the table to six points, with Gerard Denton and Cameron White sharing six wickets between them. Chasing 188 to win, the Bushrangers were three for 160, but lost four wickets in 23 balls before Andrew McDonald's 14 not out took them across the line. In the final match, the Tigers and the Redbacks tied in a match that was cut from 50 to 35 overs a side following rain. Michael Bevan made 54 for the Tigers, who chased a revised target of 172 to win, and when Bevan was dismissed the Tigers required 13 off 14 balls. Three more wickets fell, Shaun Tait taking two in an over, and both teams had to be content with the tie. Finally, South Africa beat Australia by five wickets on a Sunday game in Brisbane, with Brett Lee conceding 17 off his final over after South Africa had needed 47 off 30 balls.\nPura Cup Week Six.\nThe sixth round of matches began on 15 January, with the Warriors hosting the Bulls at the WACA, and after the Warriors had elected to bat and were bowled out for 190, centuries from Martin Love and WA-born Brendan Nash gave the Bulls a lead. Wicket-keeper Hartley also hit 73 for the Bulls, who took a 280-run lead on first innings, and though the Warriors replied with 407 after Adam Voges' 178, they were bowled out shortly before tea on day four to set Queensland 128 in 40 overs. After half-centuries from Jimmy Maher and Love, they broke that target with nine wickets to spare.\nIn the VB Series match at Brisbane, South Africa were sent back to earth by Sri Lanka, so that all teams had one win after the first round of matches. Jehan Mubarak and Kumar Sangakkara shared a 112-run stand for the second wicket on the way to a total of eight for 282, and though Jacques Rudolph and Mark Boucher hit half-centuries South Africa were bowled out for 188 in the chase.\nThe Blues and the Bushrangers had started a day later in their game at Lismore, and at the close of the third day's play the Bushrangers were in their second innings, leading by 92 with ten wickets in hand. Opener Jason Arnberger had batted for nine hours to secure a double century, ending on 235 not out before the Bushrangers declared, but despite a first innings total of 519 their eventual lead was 82 runs on first innings. With the last day rained off, the match ended in a draw.\nFurther south, the Redbacks and the Tigers avoided that fate, as the Redbacks rode on a 369-run first innings lead to win by 194 runs, bowling the Tigers out six overs after tea. Two people named Bailey took centre stage in the final innings – chasing 563 to win, Tasmania's George Bailey hit 130, but Redbacks' spinner Cullen took five for 146 as the Tigers were bowled out for 368. The Redbacks' win sent them second in the table, but four teams were within four points at this point.\nFirst Twenty20 winners.\nSouth Africa suffered their second loss in three days in the VB Series, in a match with eleven single-figure scores. However, Phil Jaques made 94, the highest score by an Australian on ODI debut , and Brett Lee took career-best figures of five for 22 to help bowl South Africa out for 186, two less than in Brisbane three days earlier.\nThe Bushrangers and the Blues, the two teams that had topped the ING and Pura tables at New Year, also faced off in the Twenty20 final at the North Sydney Oval. Despite the match being played in front of a home crowd, the Bushrangers accumulated the highest total in Australian Twenty20 cricket thus far, ending with seven for 233 after Brad Hodge made 106 in 54 balls and Cameron White hit six sixes to end with 46 not out. White also took three for eight with the ball, as the Blues were at nought for 64 but then lost all their wickets for 76 runs to hand the title to the Victorians.\nThe last four matches in the regular season stage of the women's National League were also completed; Queensland hosted Victoria for two games, and qualified for the final after a 42-run win in the first match (where they restricted Victoria to 109 for 9 in 32 overs chasing 152 to win), and a century from 21-year-old Kasee Marxsen helped them set a target of 97 to win against the Bushrangers. The Scorpions travelled to Perth, but despite winning both matches, they finished third in the overall standings, and did not qualify for the final series against the Breakers. Queensland Fire finished second in the regular season ladder, qualifying thanks to more bonus points.\nIn the VB Series, Sri Lanka batted first at the SCG, and posted seven for 309 against an Australian team without Phil Jaques or Glenn McGrath. The Sri Lankan team, meanwhile, included Sanath Jayasuriya who returned from injury by hitting 114 off 96 balls to be named Man of the Match, as Australia were bowled out for 258. However, Sri Lanka failed to back up their winning run, as South African opener Boeta Dippenaar hit 125 not out against them two days later and helped set a target of 264. Sri Lanka were 224 for 4 in reply, but Mahela Jayawardene was bowled by Johannes van der Wath, and Andrew Hall then claimed two wickets in two balls and followed up with a maiden 50th over when Sri Lanka needed 11 to win.\nING Cup Wednesday.\nAll six state teams were in action in the ING Cup on Wednesday 25 January, with Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia recording wins. Victorian Bushrangers batted first against the Bulls, and after losing the first three wickets for 59, David Hussey added 205 with Cameron White to set a new state record partnership for the fourth wicket . White backed up his 85 with four wickets for 23 as the Bulls were 13 runs short of victory at the 'Gabba. In Hobart, there were two centuries in the match between Tasmania and New South Wales; Phil Jaques, who had been left out by Australia three days earlier, hit 138 as New South Wales posted 311 for 7, but Tim Paine responded with 111, sharing an opening stand of 179 with Travis Birt. After the opening partnership, however, Tasmania ended on 299 for 9, with Stuart MacGill and Aaron O'Brien claiming three wickets each. Another century came at the WACA; Mark Cosgrove hit 121 for the visiting Southern Redbacks, who set a target of 272 for the hosting Western Warriors to chase, but only Shaun Marsh and Chris Rogers passed 30 as the Warriors were bowled out for 163.\nLast week of January.\nAustralia, again without the resting Ricky Ponting notched up consecutive victories over Sri Lanka; on 26 January in Adelaide, they successfully chased down 219 to win by five wickets after a half-century from Simon Katich, while makeshift captain Adam Gilchrist shared an opening stand of 191 with Katich at Perth three days later, when Australia needed 234 to win. In the two ING matches on 29 January, the Redbacks went unbeaten for their third 50-over match in a row after chasing 223 successfully against the Bushrangers, while the Warriors defended 236 against the Tigers despite 105 from Tigers captain Michael Di Venuto. To round off the month, South Africa and Sri Lanka entertained the Perth crowd, and a spell of 10–3–17–2 from Shaun Pollock limited Sri Lanka to 221. South Africa chased that down with five overs to spare and took another step towards the three-match final series. The win also meant Australia were assured of a place in the final. \nFebruary.\nConclusion, VB Series group stage.\nA round of three-day games started at Hobart on 1 February, with the Warriors bowling out the Tigers for 86 on first innings, as Steve Magoffin took bowling figures of 17–12–15–3. Chris Rogers then outscored the Tigers by hitting 135 in the Warriors' total of 215, and though the Tigers posted 276 the second time around, the Warriors chased it down with seven wickets to spare after a partnership of 106 between Rogers and Shaun Marsh. On 2 February, play began at the 'Gabba, where Queensland built a 287-run lead on first innings after 116 from Martin Love and half-centuries from numbers eight and nine, Andy Bichel and Daniel Doran. The Blues responded with 378, but Love and Shane Watson took Queensland past the target of 92 inside 17 overs after the first two wickets fell for 20. The Redbacks also surrendered a first-innings lead at Adelaide, though Victoria fell from one for 164 to 249 all out, and despite 68 off 64 balls from Shaun Tait of the Redbacks, the Bushrangers chased down the target after a half-century from Jason Arnberger.\nIn the VB Series, Australia played South Africa twice, winning both games after batting first; in the first game, they totalled seven for 281 after a 109-run sixth-wicket partnership between Mike Hussey and Andrew Symonds, and Brett Lee then took four wickets as South Africa were bowled out for 201. In the second, Australia batted to a total of six for 344, with Adam Gilchrist, Ricky Ponting and Damien Martyn all making half-centuries at rates quicker than a run a ball. Despite 37 off 16 balls from Johannes van der Wath South Africa made six for 287 in reply, losing again to make the 7 February match in Hobart a play-off match for the right to play Australia in the final.\nThe weekend between 3 and 5 February also saw the final stages of the women's National League, with New South Wales Breakers playing Queensland Fire in three matches at the North Sydney Oval. In the first match, the Breakers bowled out the Fire for 174, then chased down the target thanks to half-centuries from Leah Poulton and Alex Blackwell; the following day, it was the Breakers who batted first and made a sub-200 total. Chasing 155 to win, the Fire were six for 70, but wicket-keeper Jodie Purves made 61 and added 49 with Megan White for the eighth wicket to bring the series to a final decider. The Breakers batted first in that match, and made the lowest score of the series with 146 all out, as Jude Coleman took four for 28; and with another top-score from Purves, this time for 37, the Fire needed three with three wickets in hand. However, Charlotte Anneveld, who had taken her first wickets in National League cricket earlier on , took two wickets in the 47th over to complete a haul of four for 29, and Sarah Andrews broke the final partnership when she had White bowled for 13, leaving New South Wales winners by two runs.\nIn the international matches, South Africa led by three points before the final group stage match, but still needed at least a tie or a no-result to qualify. Sri Lanka batted first, and made nine for 257 after a century partnership between Marvan Atapattu and Sanath Jayasuriya, and Sri Lankan seamer Chaminda Vaas then took two South African wickets in the seventh over. Graeme Smith rebuilt with Mark Boucher (partnership of 58) and Ashwell Prince, but another double strike, this time from substitute Malinga Bandara set South Africa back to five for 114. Bandara took two more wickets, was named Man of the Match, and Cricinfo journalist Peter English described his performance as \"stunning\" . South Africa were eventually all out for 181, with Jayasuriya, Muttiah Muralitharan and Tillakaratne Dilshan chipping in with a wicket each, and Sri Lanka qualified for the three-match final series.\nVB Series Finals.\nIn the first match of the three-match final series Sri Lanka pulled off a \"convincing\" loss to inflict the first defeat on Australia since 22 January. Set 275 to win after half-centuries from Marvan Atapattu and Kumar Sangakkara, Australia scored 51 without loss in the first ten overs, but a total of five run outs and three for 40 from Muttiah Muralitharan sent them all out for 252.\nThe second match saw Chaminda Vaas take three wickets as Australia were three for 10, but Ricky Ponting shared a 237-run stand with Andrew Symonds, an Australian all-wicket record partnership . Michael Clarke made his half-century in 27 balls, and Australia scored what was then their highest score in a limited-over international (five for 368). In reply, Nathan Bracken took four for 30 off six overs, and though Russel Arnold hit an unbeaten 64, Sri Lanka were bowled out for 201.\nHaving opted to bat in the third match, Sri Lanka set a target of 267 after half-centuries from Sangakkara, Arnold and Mahela Jayawardene, while Bracken got three for 44 for Australia. However, the target was no match for Adam Gilchrist and Simon Katich; the two shared an opening stand of 196 before Gilchrist was bowled by Muralitharan for a 91-ball 122. Katich also reached his century, ending on 107 not out, and with Ricky Ponting he guided Australia past the target.\nPura Cup Week Eight.\nThe Tigers began their match one day before Australia and Sri Lanka faced off in the VB Series, and recorded their first win since November; the Bushrangers, by contrast, hadn't lost since November. The first-innings third-wicket stand between Michael Di Venuto and Travis Birt of the Tigers was worth 143, eight more than Victoria managed in their first innings, and though Cameron White and Shane Warne scored half-centuries for Victoria the second time around, they fell 121 short of their target of 409. In Sydney, the Warriors batted to nine for 508 thanks to centuries from Marcus North (151 not out) and Luke Ronchi (100), and Steve Magoffin and Brett Dorey then took three wickets each as the Blues were bowled out for 117. The second time around, the Blues made 478, but despite three wickets from spinner Jason Krejza the Warriors made it home with six wickets to spare.\nING Cup conclusion.\nThe final round of the ING Cup was opened in Brisbane, where the Redbacks posted nine for 313 after a century from Greg Blewett. Despite 12 wides from Redbacks fast bowler Shaun Tait, the Bulls were bowled out for 245, and the Redbacks secured a bonus point and a six-point lead over the third-placed Bushrangers, who needed six points in their match the following day to draw level with the Redbacks. On the same day, Australia Under-19 played their final match in the U-19 World Cup, losing their semi-final to Pakistan Under-19 by 163 runs to finish joint third with England Under-19.\nTwice the run rate of the opposition was needed in order to obtain six points, and after Tasmania won the toss and batted to seven for 242, the Bushrangers needed 485 to be able to qualify for the final. Instead, they lost both wickets in the opening over to Adam Griffith, who got career best ING figures of four for 36 as the Bushrangers were bowled out for 128. This meant that the Blues and the Redbacks had qualified for the final before the final match between the Blues and the Warriors, which the latter won by a margin of one run; the Blues had needed seven off Ben Edmondson's last over, but two wickets fell on the first two balls, and Aaron Bird and Stuart MacGill could only add five from the last four.\nIn the only women's Test match of the season, the hosts won inside three of the scheduled four days; captain Karen Rolton opted to bat first, and made 63, and a half-century from Lisa Sthalekar took Australia to 250. Fast bowler Cathryn Fitzpatrick then got the best figures with three for 24 as India were bowled out for 93 and made to follow on, and in the second innings, Sthalekar got five for 30 and India were bowled out for 153, four short of making Australia bat again.\nThe final match of the Pura Cup's eighth week was also concluded; the Bulls earned a 138-run lead on first innings, then added 365 in their second with Clinton Perren making 168 not out before they declared. Andy Bichel and Michael Kasprowicz then shared eight of ten Redback wickets as the visitors were bowled out for 209.\nTour of South Africa begins, and ING Cup final.\nAustralia embarked on their second set of matches against South Africa this season, this time in South Africa. The tour began with a Twenty20 international at the Wanderers, where South Africa won by two runs after half-centuries from Graeme Smith and Herschelle Gibbs. Australia needed 19 off the final over, but could only get 10 off the first five balls, and despite Brett Lee hitting the last ball for six over midwicket South Africa took the first spoils.\nThe women's team played a series of three One-day Internationals over four days in the last week of February; they began at St Peter's College, Adelaide, where two of the three matches. Australia won the first after being bowled out for 173 in 49 overs, with Karen Rolton taking four for 29 and helping to stop India for 161 despite 66 from Anjum Chopra. The second match saw no such efforts from Chopra, as India were bowled out for 89 with Cathryn Fitzpatrick taking five wickets, and Karen Rolton hit 47 as Australia won by four wickets.\nOn the same day as Australia's women secured the One-day Internationals, the men's tour of South Africa continued, this time with a One Day International win at Centurion. Australia batted first, making eight for 229 after half-centuries from Michael Clarke and Michael Hussey, and the recalculated target under the Duckworth–Lewis method was 204 in 41 overs. Graeme Smith hit 119 not out to take South Africa home with six wickets to spare. Back in Australia, the Redbacks hosted the Blues for the ING Cup final, and aimed to take their first win in 19 years . However, despite a match top-score of 49 from Mark Cosgrove and six wickets from Shaun Tait, the Redbacks could not defend their total of 154. Stuart MacGill secured the trophy with a leg glance off Darren Lehmann, the second time he'd hit the winning runs for the Blues in as many seasons .\nThe final women's One-day International saw India bat out 50 overs, but their total of seven for 128 was not enough, as Alex Blackwell and Rolton both hit half-centuries and took Australia to a nine-wicket win.\nMarch.\nPura Cup Week Nine.\nNew South Wales followed up their ING Cup trophy with a three-day defeat at the Bellerive Oval, after totalling 141 and 157 in their two innings. Tasmanian bowler Ben Hilfenhaus took ten for 87 in the match, including seven in the second innings, while Travis Birt top scored, hitting seven sixes and nineteen fours in a four-hour 160. Meanwhile, in South Africa, Australia suffered their second-highest loss by runs in One-day Internationals, Makhaya Ntini taking six for 22 as Australia were all out for 93 to lose by 196 runs. The result meant Australia had to win their three last matches to take the series.\nOn 5 March, Queensland Bulls won the league stage and made sure the Pura Cup final would be held in Brisbane after beating Victoria by 106 runs . Jimmy Maher and Matthew Hayden opened by adding 153 for the first wicket, and despite seven for 100 from Shane Warne, Queensland totalled 408 after an unbeaten 76 from Andy Bichel. The Bushrangers barely made half of that, ending on 212 with Jonathan Moss top scoring with 60, and Queensland declared shortly before the close of play on day three on five for 189. All five Bulls' bowlers got at least one wicket on the final day, and though Nick Jewell and Cameron White put on 100 for the fifth wicket, a double strike from injured leg spinner Daniel Doran after tea saw the Bushrangers to seven for 239. Michael Kasprowicz and Andy Bichel took the last three wickets to give Queensland their eighth successive Pura Cup final appearance. Australia also came back to 1–2 in the five-match ODI series in South Africa, successfully defending 255 to win despite half-centuries from Shaun Pollock and AB de Villiers. Brett Lee took four for 48 for Australia.\nThe Warriors could have gone second in the Pura Cup table if they had managed to force a win on the final day against the Redbacks, having earned a three-run first innings lead when Steve Magoffin had Dan Cullen caught behind for six midway through day three. Effectively 88 for three overnight, the Warriors lost nightwatchman Beau Casson and Adam Voges in the first session, but Marcus North and Dave Bandy batted out four hours in a 211-run fifth-wicket partnership. The Warriors batted out the day to draw the game, and were thus third, with a chance to qualify with a win in the final round at the Bushrangers.\n\"The greatest match ever\".\nThose were words used by iafrica.com columnist Dan Nicholl following the fifth One-day International between Australia and South Africa. Australia had won the fourth match, taking victory by one wicket after Nathan Bracken and Stuart Clark added 23 for the ninth wicket and Clark and Mick Lewis batted together to secure victory in the last over, which left the series tied at 2–2 with one to play. Australia won the toss, chose to bat first, and amassed runs off the South African bowlers. Their total of four for 434 was the highest team total thus far in ODI cricket, leaving South Africa to chase 435 to win – over 100 runs more than any team had chased before.\nYet, they did it. Herschelle Gibbs and Graeme Smith added 187 in 20.5 overs for the second wicket, and though Nathan Bracken took five wickets and South Africa were down to the last man, Mark Boucher won them the game by hitting a four off the fifth ball of the final over. Gibbs and Ricky Ponting (164) were jointly awarded the Man of the Match award, but Ponting declined .\nPura Cup Week Ten.\nThe final round of the Pura Cup was also played out; the winner of the Bushrangers–Warriors match at Junction Oval in Melbourne would join the Bulls in the final, while a draw would see it come down to quotient with other sides. The Tigers finished first, winning their third match in succession after bowling the Bulls out for 176 and 140, while Michael Bevan scored a century and captain Daniel Marsh made 96 not out. The Redbacks and the Blues played out a match with three declared innings at Adelaide; South Australia batted first, making seven for 541 after centuries from Shane Deitz, Cameron Borgas and Mark Cosgrove, and the Blues responded with six for 314 before declaring, knowing that their only chance of qualifying for the final would be a win in this game. The Redbacks batted for 27 overs, making three for 115 before setting the Blues 343 in a minimum of 100 overs. The Blues were five for 233 after 80 overs, when the Redbacks took the new ball , but Paul Rofe took three wickets in thirteen balls. In the last hour, the Redbacks needed two wickets, and claimed the last when Aaron O'Brien was bowled for 48 by former Australian Test bowler Jason Gillespie with seven balls remaining.\nHowever, the result from Melbourne meant that the Redbacks' total of 26 points was not enough. The Warriors had earned a 19-run lead on first innings, though the Bushrangers' last three wickets had added more than their first seven (7–92 to 206 all out), and eight double-digit figures with a high of 66 from Chris Rogers gave the Warriors a lead of 360 with 15 overs left on the third day. Before this match, the highest fourth innings total to win at the Junction Oval was six for 209 by Western Australia in 1956–57. The final day was delayed by rain , but after four half-centuries and 46 not out from captain Cameron White, the Bushrangers totalled five for 361 to win the match by five wickets and qualify for the final. Warriors pacer Brett Dorey, leading wicket-taker for the season in the Warriors , ended with nought for 102 off 25 overs.\nSouth Africa Tests and Pura Cup final.\nThe first Test of the three-match series in South Africa, at Newlands, was over inside three days after Stuart Clark claimed nine for 89 on Test debut to be named Man of the Match in Australia's seven-wicket win. South Africa batted first, making 205 with Nicky Boje's 31 from number nine the highest score, and Matthew Hayden and Ricky Ponting then brought Australia within 30 of that before Ponting was caught off the bowling of Jacques Kallis. Another half-century, from Andrew Symonds, took Australia to a lead of 103, and Clark was leading wicket-taker in the second innings to bowl South Africa out for 197, and despite three wickets from Makhaya Ntini, Australia made it to the target and won their third successive Test against South Africa.\nIn the second Test, Ricky Ponting scored centuries in both the first and second innings to pass Don Bradman's mark of 29 Test hundreds , while a five-wicket-haul from Brett Lee helped Australia take a lead of 108 on first innings despite 114 from Jacques Kallis. Half an hour before tea on day four, Ponting declared with a lead of 409, but weather conditions stopped play after tea and meant Australia had one day to bowl out South Africa and take the Test series win . AB de Villiers added 91 with Graeme Smith for the first wicket, but Shane Warne accounted for them both and four more to take his first five-wicket-haul of the series and end with six for 86. South Africa were seven for 181 at one point, but Mark Boucher put on 72 with Nicky Boje for the eighth wicket and 39 with André Nel for the ninth to give South Africa a chance of the draw; however, with six overs remaining, Makhaya Ntini was given lbw to Warne and Australia could cheer.\nThe final match of the domestic season was played at the 'Gabba, and after the Bushrangers had made 344 in the first innings (with three batsmen, Brad Hodge, Nick Jewell and David Hussey, making over three-quarters of the score), it was the hosts' turn to bat. They overtook the Victorian score with just one wicket lost, that of Lachlan Stevens for 66, and continued to bat well past it. In fact, they batted past the previous state record of 687 from 1930–31, with Jimmy Maher (223), Shane Watson (201, retired hurt), Clinton Perren (173) and Martin Love (169) all passing 150 for Queensland. They lost three wickets in four overs to Dirk Nannes after passing 850, but eventually declared on six for 900, the eleventh highest first class score of all time . The Queensland innings was also the first time in first-class cricket history that four individual scores of 150 occurred in the same innings. Mitchell Johnson then took two wickets before stumps on the third day, and four on the fourth, to help bowl the Bushrangers out for 202 and secure the Pura Cup for Queensland. Daniel Doran also took three wickets in the second innings."

        "text": "The Albania men's national basketball team () represents Albania in international basketball competitions. The national team is governed by the Albanian Basketball Association.\nAlbania has competed at the EuroBasket twice throughout their history, in 1947 and 1957. While the team has appeared on the continental level in the past, Albania still looks to obtain qualification to reach the FIBA World Cup.\nHistory.\n20th century.\nBasketball was introduced in Albania in the early 20th century, and it became popular in the 1920s following the end of World War I as sports societies and clubs were being formed all over the country, and basketball was soon introduced to the major towns and cities in Albania. Basketball was played informally by teams representing different sports clubs, and it wasn't until September 1945 that a National Basketball Committee was formed that would be responsible for dealing with the issues basketball teams in the country faced. The committee paved the way for the creation of the Albanian Basketball Association (ABA) a year later in 1946, which became a member of FIBA in 1947. Their main goals were to enable clubs to compete in national competitions, as well as to promote the sport. The first National Championship in Albania was held in 1946, and a year later the first Women's National Championship also took place. In 1951 the ABA created the Republic's Cup, which was a competition open to all professional and amateur basketball clubs in Albania, with the women's and youth versions of the competition both starting in 1952. During the Communist regime in Albania, the National Spartakiad was held between 1959 and 1989, where basketball was one of the more popular sports on display at the country's biggest sports events. In 1999, the ABA held the first Albanian Basketball Supercups for men and women, which is played between the winners of the league and cup.\nAlbania first competed in a European Championship at EuroBasket 1947 held in Prague, Czechoslovakia, shortly after joining FIBA as an affiliate national team. In the preliminary round of the competition Albania was placed in Group D, with Italy, Belgium and Egypt. Albania's first game in a major tournament came against Italy, which was a 15–60 loss.\nIn their next two matches, Albania would suffer heavy defeats at the hands of Belgium 114–11 and to Egypt 19–104. In the next round, Albania were placed in the lower bracket Group 3 to determine who finishes between 7th and 10th place. There, the national team were up against Romania and Austria. Albania would go on to lose 19–73 to Romania and 27–44 to Austria. The team then went on to face Yugoslavia in the final game to determine 13th and 14th place, where they would lose 13–90 to Yugoslavia to finish in last place out of 14 teams. During the tournament, Albania registered a record of (0–6), while averaging just 17.3 points per game. Their highest point tally came against Austria where they scored 27 points, which was also the match where the team had its smallest margin of defeat at 17 points. Albania conceded an average of 80.3 points per game, with their highest scoring opponent being Belgium.\nTen years after their debut tournament appearance at the Euros, Albania competed at EuroBasket 1957 in Sofia, Bulgaria. Albania were placed in Group A in the preliminary round with Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and Scotland. The national team lost 57–89 to Yugoslavia in their opening match, and then went on to lose 71–37 to Czechoslovakia and 65–42 against Scotland to finish bottom of the group. During the classification round, Albania faced Turkey, Italy, Finland, Belgium, West Germany, Austria and Scotland. Albania would lose all seven games in the classification round, which sent the team toward finishing at the bottom of another EuroBasket tournament, this time out of 16 teams. Albania during the competition averaged 47.6 points per game, with their highest points tally coming against Turkey in a 64–97 defeat. Albania conceded an average of 78.4 points per game during their ten games played at the event. Despite putting up better statistical numbers than those in 1947, Albania could not manage to earn a victory at the Euros for the second consecutive tournament. After the EuroBasket 1957 Championship. \nAlbania almost failed to reach an major tournament again throughout the rest of the 20th century, although Albania were able to take place at the 1970 Summer Universiade in Torino, Italy. In which the Albanians finished 24th after being able to win matches against Luxembourg even twice with 84-67 and 90-60 aswell as beating Sudan an record 116-74 and against Senegal with 83-71 to secure four wins in their campaign being Albania's most successful tournament in Basketball. Notable for Albania by almost upsetting one of the strongest national basketball teams Yugoslavia by losing only by two points difference with an result of 74-72 respectively. So far Albania's only participation at the Summer Universiade.\n Although the national team did go on to attempt to qualify on numerous occasions, including for the 1972 Summer Olympics. That was where Albania competed in qualification to reach the Olympic Games for the first time. However, the team was defeated in all three of its games during qualifying to come up short. Also, during qualifying for EuroBasket 1975, where Albania put up record feats in their attempt to make it back on to the continental stage. It was where the team earned their highest margin of victory versus an opponent to that point, against Iceland 112–77; as well as earning their first three game winning streak. Although even behind heroic performances, Albania would narrowly miss out on clinching qualification.\n21st century.\nIn 2002, Albania entered a smaller competition, the 2002 European Championship for Small Countries. Albania would begin the tournament in Group A, where the team would eventually earn a (2–1) record. However, due to point differential, Albania missed out on advancing to the knockout phase and were relegated to the classification round. There, the team defeated Gibraltar, but lost to Moldova to finish the tournament in sixth place.\nAfter achieving nearly similar results at the competition in 2004, Albania were poised to change the narrative at the 2006 tournament. The national team quickly set the tone, as they went undefeated (3–0) in the group stage to advance. In the semis, Albania won a high scoring affair against Andorra 111–101, to send the team into the final. Although the team would fall short of winning the competition, losing a tightly contested match to Azerbaijan to finish as the runners-up.\nEntering qualification for EuroBasket 2017, Albania struggled to a (1–5) record during the qualifiers, picking up their lone victory against Slovakia and missing out to qualify. During the process for Albania to qualify for the 2019 FIBA World Cup, the national team went through European Pre-Qualifiers. However, Albania were overwhelmed in all four of their matches in the pre-qualifying stage, and failed to advance.\nFollowing Albania's lost attempt to qualify for the 2019 World Cup, the team directed their attention toward EuroBasket 2022 qualifying. Although Albania would display similar results which caused the team to miss out on the World Cup, and being eliminated.\nTeam.\nCurrent roster.\nRoster for the 2027 FIBA World Cup Pre-Qualifiers match on 25 February 2024 against Armenia.\nPast rosters.\n1947 EuroBasket: finished 14th among 14 teams\n3 Muntaz Peshkopia, 4 Naim Pilku, 5 Bajram Kurani, 6 Çerçiz Zavalani, 7 Dilaver Toptani, 8 Ferdin Toptani, 9 Vlash Koljaka,&lt;br&gt;10 Dhimitraq Goga (Coach: Naim Pilku)\n1957 EuroBasket: finished 16th among 16 teams\n3 Ilo Teneqexhi, 4 Feti Borova, 5 Dhimitraq Goga, 6 Kiço Gjata, 7 Ferdinand Qirici, 8 Muhamet Përmeti, 9 Fatmir Meka,&lt;br&gt;10 Muhamet Sokoli, 11 Salvador Sotiri, 12 Muhamet Moursakou, 13 Jorgji Çako (Coach: Naim Pilku)"

Initially, the team struggled and lost both of their preliminary round matches, along with their first semifinal round match. Then they defeated Albania to place second in the group and set up a match against the Netherlands for 11th and 12th place, which Austria lost after a long battle.\nEuroBasket 1951.\nAustria made their second appearance on the continental stage at EuroBasket 1951 in Paris. The national team was eliminated from championship contention after finishing 1–3 in pool play and fourth in their group. They won all three of their first round classification games, however, advancing to the 9th–12th place classification semifinals. A loss to the Netherlands, but a win over West Germany propelled Austria into 11th place of the 18 teams in the tournament.\nEuroBasket 1955.\nAustria's appearance at EuroBasket 1955 in Budapest began with a 2–2 showing in preliminary round play. This was good enough for third place in the pool, and Austria was pushed to classification play. There, they were able to win only 1 out of 4 games (the win coming against West Germany), placing fourth of the five teams in the group. Playing against Luxembourg and then Switzerland in classification for the 13th–16th place playoffs, Austria won both games to finish 13th of the 18 teams.\nEuroBasket 1957.\nIn Sofia for the EuroBasket 1957 competition, Austria was defeated three times in the preliminary round.

        "text": "The Soviet Union men's national basketball team () was the national basketball team that represented the Soviet Union in international competitions. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the successor countries all set up their own national teams.\nBased on the number of medals, the basketball program of the former Soviet Union remains one of the most successful in the history of international basketball competitions, behind that of the United States but ahead of Spain.\nHistory.\nEuroBasket 1947.\nThe Soviets first competed in the European championship at EuroBasket 1947. They quickly established their dominance of the European field, winning both preliminary round games, all three semifinal round games, and the championship match against defending gold medallists Czechoslovakia. The Soviets outscored their opponents by an aggregate 126 points over their 6 wins, an average margin of victory of 21 points.\nEuroBasket 1951.\nAfter refusing to host EuroBasket 1949 as was FIBA Europe's expectation of the Soviet Union and skipping the tournament entirely, the Soviets returned to European championships in EuroBasket 1951. They dominated the early portions of the tournament, outscoring opponents 312–117 in their four preliminary round wins. The three games of the semifinal round also posed little problem for the Soviet team, as the closest any opponent came was the Czechoslovak team losing by only 16. In the first game of the final round, which was essentially a semifinal game, the Soviets defeated Bulgaria 72–54 to advance to the championship game, a rematch against Czechoslovakia.\nIn that match, the Soviet team faced its first true close test in European play. A 44–44 tie was broken by Soviet Ilmar Kullam from the free throw line with 1 second left on the clock to give the Soviets a 45–44 win. Even that was called into question, however, as one of the referees initially signaled that Kullam had stepped on the free throw line during the shot and therefore the point would be disallowed. After consultation with another referee, however, the free throw was upheld and the Soviets had won their second European championship.\nEuroBasket 1953.\nThe Soviets maintained their domination at EuroBasket 1953, which they hosted in Moscow. They had no trouble in a 3–0 preliminary round that included a 104-point slaughter of Denmark. An eight-team final round also posed little difficulty for the squad, with the closest of the 7 wins being a 29–24 slog against Hungary as the Soviets extended their streak to 3 championships with 25 wins and no losses.\nEuroBasket 1955.\nThrough four preliminary round games and the first three final round games, the Soviets extended their winning streak to 31 games. With four games left in the final round robin of EuroBasket 1955, the Soviets were facing the pesky Czechoslovakia team, which was so far had been the closest to defeating the Soviet Union, in 1951. Czechoslovakia, however, had already lost twice in the round, and had a record of 1–2 to the Soviets' 3–0 going into the game.\nIn a shocking result, the 81–74 final score did not favor the Soviet Union. They did so once more before the tournament was over, losing to Hungary in a game that essentially determined the gold medal despite being only the 6th of 7 matches each team played. The Soviets' 5–2 record in the round matched that of Czechoslovakia, and the Soviets finished with only a bronze medal.\nEuroBasket 1957.\nTwo years later, at EuroBasket 1957 in Sofia, the Soviets returned to form. They won their three preliminary round games and then their seven final round games, including an exciting final match of the round robin against similarly undefeated hosts Bulgaria. The Soviets trailed 23–19 at halftime, but battled back to a 60–57 victory to take their 4th European championship.\nRosters.\n1947 EuroBasket: finished 1st among 14 teams\nStepas Butautas, Connor

        "title": "Wimbledon Windmill",
        "text": "Wimbledon Windmill is a Grade II* listed windmill situated on Wimbledon Common in the London Borough of Merton (originally in Surrey), in the west of South London, and is preserved as a museum.\nHistory.\nAn application to build a windmill on the Common was denied in 1799 when the applicant, one John Watney, failed to produce plans for the proposed mill when requested. In 1816, Charles March, a carpenter of Roehampton applied for permission to build a windmill. The request was granted the following year and the mill was built. The mill stopped working in 1864, when the miller was evicted by the Lord of the Manor, Earl Spencer, who wanted to enclose the common for his own use. The miller insisted on removing most of the machinery so that the mill could not be operated in competition with his other mills at Kingston. The main mill building was rebuilt with brickwork to provide living accommodation.\nThe enclosure of the common was strongly opposed by the local people, who successfully got the 1871 Wimbledon and Putney Commons Act passed, handing the care of the commons to elected and appointed conservators. In 1892, tenders for the repair of the mill were sought by the Commons Conservators, and Messrs. Sanderson &amp; Sons tender of £240 was accepted. Royal Wimbledon Golf Club contributed £50 towards the cost of the repairs. During repairs, it was discovered that the main Post and Crosstrees were rotten and Sandersons proposed converting the mill to a smock mill, at a total cost of £350. The work was reported as being complete in November 1893. The original Patent sails were replaced by a shorter set of sails with fixed shutters. After the loss of a sail in the 1920s another set of sails with fewer shutters was placed on the mill.\nDuring World War II, the mill was camouflaged with a drab green scheme to reduce its visibility and one of its sails was removed, as it was in close proximity to army camps set up on the Common. The mill was repainted after the war ended, but the sails were stopped in 1946 due to excessive wear in the gearing. In 1952, the mill was inspected and a list of repairs drawn up. After a public appeal in 1954 to raise funds, the mill was restored and the sails turned again on 25 May 1957. The mill was restored again in 1975 and turned into a museum. In 1999 a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund enabled the Patent sails to be restored to working order. The museum, initially only on one floor but extended to two in 1999, depicts the story of windmills from their early origins up to the present day, using models, examples of machinery and tools of the trade. A room from one of the smaller apartments is preserved to illustrate how the building was used as accommodation. It is no longer a working mill, but a finely detailed model shows the machinery as it was in its working days.\nOn 2 August 2015, a sail fell from the mill, damaging the base below. The collapse of the sail was caused by long-term water ingress. The sails were restored in 2016.\nDescription.\nWimbledon Windmill was built as a hollow post mill, with the drive to the stones passing through the centre of the main post. It was a hollow post mill for its entire working life, but was rebuilt as a smock mill when it was preserved in 1893. The mill has double Patent sails and is winded by a fantail. The windmill has an octagonal brick base of two stories, above which is a conical tower formerly housing the main post. The cast-iron windshaft carries four double Patent sails, and a diameter cast iron Brake Wheel with about 60 wooden cogs, which formerly drove the cast-iron Wallower carried on a cast iron Upright Shaft. A Spur Wheel at the lower end of the upright shaft would have driven the millstones on the upper floor of the mill. The conversion from Hollow Post mill to a Smock mill was done by Sanderson's, the Louth millwrights.\nCulture and media.\nThe Mill House of Wimbledon Windmill is where Robert Baden-Powell stayed in 1902 and wrote parts of \"Scouting for Boys\", which was published in 1908. Wimbledon Windmill also featured in the Doctor Who episode titled \"The Massacre of St Bartholomew's Eve (Bell of Doom)\" which was filmed in 1966. It also appears in the 1952 film \"Hammer the Toff\". It also appears briefly in the 1970 Peter Sellers Film \"Hoffman\".\nPublic access.\nThe windmill is now a museum, detailing its own history, as well as the history of windmills in general. The museum is open at weekends and Bank Holidays from March to October. It features interactive exhibits, such as push-button models and grain-grinding activities, in addition to visitors being able to explore the layout and use of the actual mill. The windmill and the nearby café are situated on the Common adjacent to both open spaces and woodland."

He played college basketball for Michigan State, and then played parts of eight seasons in the NBA. He also served as an assistant coach for the Iowa Wolves of the NBA G League. and as an assistant coach for the Texas Legends of the NBA G League.\nHigh school.\nBell began playing basketball at Flint Southwestern Academy High School, in Flint, Michigan.\nCollege career.\nBell had an excellent college basketball career at Michigan State, appearing in three NCAA Final Fours, and being named Michigan State Defensive Player of the Year, in each of the four years he played there.\nProfessional playing career.\nBell wasn't selected in the NBA draft, but he was signed by the Phoenix Suns, on July 23, 2001, as a free agent, and played five games for them. After being released by the Suns, he signed with the Phoenix Eclipse of the ABA and played four games for them. He initially signed a 10-day contract with the Dallas Mavericks on January 10, 2002, and was then signed for the remainder of the season on January 15, but only appeared in two games.\nAfter a rather brief stint in the NBA, Bell took his career to Europe to play in the Italian and Spanish Leagues where he was regarded as a star. In March 2002, he signed with Benetton Treviso, of the Italian League, and he won the Italian League championship with Treviso. In the 2002–03 season, he played with Virtus (Kinder) Bologna, but he was injured in December 2002, and was sidelined for most of the season. In August 2003, he signed with Mabo Livorno, also of the Italian League. In July 2004, he signed with Leche Rio Breogan Lugo, of the Spanish League, and he was named to the All-Spanish League First team for the 2004–05 season. He was also the top scorer of the Spanish league, and he was a three time Spanish League player of the month.\nBell signed with the Milwaukee Bucks for the 2005–06 season, and on March 28, 2006, had his best performance since entering the league, recording his first career triple-double in the Bucks' 132–110 win over the Suns. Bell had then-career highs of 19 points, 13 assists, and 10 rebounds to lead Milwaukee. Bell, who played only seven games in his prior NBA season in 2001–02, appeared in 59 games (starting in six) for the Bucks in the 2005–2006 regular season, and finished with averages of 8.4 points, 2.2 assists, and 2.0 rebounds in 21.7 minutes per game. That postseason, Bell led the Bucks in scoring with a postseason career-high 13 points in 24 minutes of playing time during their first game, a 92-74 Game 1 loss to the Detroit Pistons. The Bucks would end up losing the series four games to one.\nThe following season, to 13 points, 3 rebounds and 3 assists per games in 35 minutes on average, while appearing in all 82 games.\nOn September 17, 2007, being a restricted free agent, Bell signed an offer sheet from the Miami Heat worth $18,500,000 over five years. Although he stated that he did not want to play for Milwaukee, they decided to match the offer three days later.\nOn June 22, 2010, Bell, along with Dan Gadzuric, was traded to the Golden State Warriors for Corey Maggette. He was waived by the Warriors under the amnesty clause prior to the 2011–12 NBA season.\nBell's final NBA game was on February 22, 2011 in a 93 - 115 loss to the Boston Celtics where Bell played for only 2 minutes and recorded no stats.\nIn January 2012, he signed with Pepsi Caserta.\nCoaching career.\nOn November 3, 2016, Bell was hired by the Texas Legends of the NBA Development League to be an assistant coach.

        "title": "List of Super Bowl broadcasters",
        "text": "The following is a list of Super Bowl broadcasters, encompassing all national American television and radio networks, as well as sports announcers who have covered the first four AFL-NFL World Championship Games and subsequent championship games of the National Football League. It excludes announcers who may have appeared on local radio broadcasts produced by participating teams' flagship stations.\nSuper Bowl I stands out as the only Super Bowl simultaneously broadcast in the U.S. by two different networks. At the time, NBC held the rights to nationally televise AFL games, while CBS had the rights for NFL games. Both networks covered the game using their own announcers, but NBC could only use the CBS feed instead of producing its own. Starting with Super Bowl II, NBC televised even years, and CBS odd years. This rotation continued until the 1970 AFL–NFL merger, when NBC gained the rights to televise AFC games, and CBS to broadcast NFC games. Despite ABC broadcasting \"Monday Night Football\" in 1970, it joined the Super Bowl rotation only from Super Bowl XIX, in January 1985. ABC, CBS, and NBC then continued to rotate the Super Bowl until 1994, when Fox replaced CBS as the NFC broadcaster. CBS then assumed NBC's place in the rotation after CBS replaced NBC as the AFC broadcaster in 1998. Due to new contracts signed in 2006, NBC took over \"Sunday Night Football\" from ESPN, took ABC's place in the Super Bowl rotation, and \"Monday Night Football\" moved from ABC to ESPN. It continued until new contracts took effect in 2024, allowing not only ABC to return and initiate a four-network rotation but also ESPN to air their first two Super Bowls.\nThe four-year rotation starting with Super Bowl LVIII also allows each broadcaster to offer simulcasts or alternative broadcasts on its sister networks and platforms. CBS's sister network Nickelodeon aired an alternate children-oriented telecast of Super Bowl LVIII. ABC's rights include ESPN simulcasts and alternative broadcasts on other ESPN networks.\nThe NFL broke the traditional broadcasting rotation at least twice, both times involving NBC, CBS, and Winter Olympics. NBC originally had broadcasting rights for Super Bowl XXVI, and CBS for Super Bowl XXVII. However, the NFL allowed the networks to switch the two games to provide CBS with a significant lead-in to its coverage of the 1992 Winter Olympics. Similarly, NBC was set to air Super Bowl LV and CBS Super Bowl LVI, but the networks agreed to swap the broadcasting rights. Therefore, CBS benefited from holding rights to the Super Bowl and the 2021 NCAA Final Four, while NBC paired its Super Bowl coverage with the 2022 Winter Olympics. Under the four-network rotation starting in 2024, the league awarded NBC the Super Bowl during Winter Olympic years.\nCBS has televised the most Super Bowl games, with Super Bowl LV being its 21st, and it just completed the broadcast of its 22nd with Super Bowl LVIII in February 2024."

        "title": "Newlands Cricket Ground",
        "text": "Newlands Cricket Ground (known as Six Sun Grill Newlands for sponsorship reasons) is a cricket venue in Newlands, Cape Town. One of the oldest sporting stadiums in South Africa, the ground is owned by the Western Province Cricket Association (WPCA) and is the home of Western Province and MI Cape Town.\nRegarded as one of the most iconic and beautiful international cricket grounds in the world, Newlands is overlooked by both Table Mountain and Devil’s Peak, a view which has become celebrated for a visually stunning backdrop during play.\nEstablished in 1888, Newlands has undergone significant redevelopment in recent years with capacity having been increased to 25,000, largely due to portions of the grass embankments being replaced by modern pavilions. In 2019 WPCA announced a joint venture with Sanlam Properties to further upgrade and redevelop the ground, transforming it into a sustainable mixed-use sport, commercial, education and leisure-orientated area, but where cricket continues to enjoy preference.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nIn 1887, acting on behalf of the Western Province Cricket Club (WPCC), a sub-committee inquired into the possibility that part of Mariendal Farm, situated near Newlands village, might be made available via renting or purchase for use of a cricket ground. On inspection, the sub-committee agreed that Lot 27, although partly wetland and heavily wooded, was potentially an ideal cricket site. By coincidence, the Western Province Rugby Union (WPRU) also found Mariendal Farm to be the preferred site for their own ground, leasing a 150-yard by 150-yard plot and later becoming the Newlands Stadium.\nThe title deeds for the land had originally been acquired in 1845 by Jacob Letterstedt, a local brewer, with Newlands becoming closely associated with numerous commercial brewing companies. Original Mariendal Brewery buildings still stand today, located just behind the stadium as part of Newlands Brewery. \nAfter the death of Jacob Letterstedt, his daughter Lydia (Vicomtesse de Montmort) continued to manage the business and in 1887 agreed a £50 rent with WPCC for use of the land. The following year, in 1888, a long-term lease agreement of 25 years was signed, with the rent increasing to £100 (£10,700 in 2023). Each of the Club's life members contributed £25 towards costs, with further donations of £350 being allocated for the construction of a pavilion. \nEarly history.\nOn 2nd January 1888, Newlands was officially 'opened' with a Mother Country v Colonial Born two-day match - an event which had become a regular fixture since 1862.\nBefore the arrival of the Australians in 1902, which included Victor Trumper, the pine trees, which extended from the \"B\" field along Camp Ground Road and around the pavilion, were replaced by oak trees. This is the site of the current Oaks Enclosure, one of the most popular vantage points. A then-record crowd of 10 000 arrived to see the Test.\nTest cricket.\nThe ground hosted its first Test match on 24 March 1889 when England defeated South Africa by an innings and 202 runs. There have been 56 Test matches played at the ground of which South Africa has won 23, their opponents 22 and 11 which ended in a draw. The last team to beat South Africa in the stadium was India in January 2024.\nLimited over cricket.\nThe first One Day International played at the ground was on 7 December 1992 when South Africa beat India by 6 wickets. As of June 2019, there have been 41 One Day Internationals played at the ground including five in the 2003 Cricket World Cup. South Africa has won 30 of its ODI games here and lost 6 (India being the most recent opposition victor in February 2018).\nNewlands is one of the few cricket grounds in South Africa that tends to favour spinners. Most grounds tend to favour pacemen or batsmen, but the Western Cape has had a history of having very good spinners, a recent example being Paul Adams.\nOffice block development.\nIn July 2016, the City of Cape Town approved the rezoning application to transform the Newlands Cricket Ground into a sustainable mixed-use sport, commercial, education and leisure-orientated precinct. The cricket field and surrounding seating were specifically excluded from any form of development.\nIn March 2019, it was announced that an office block development would be added to the historic cricket ground, as an addition to the existing stadium, making Newlands Cricket Ground a mixed-use precinct. The mixed-use precinct is owned by South African investment company, Sanlam (51%) and the Western Province Cricket Association (49%).\nThe first phase of the development is expected to be completed in December 2020, whilst the long-term plan for the Newlands Cricket Ground development will see further upgrades to the historic cricket ground that will take the project into 2024.\nAccording to the official website for the commercial development, JSE-listed AdvTech is the anchor tenant for the redevelopment.\nOther sports.\nThe ground has also hosted exhibition matches in Australian rules football. In 1998, a crowd of 10,123 saw the play ."

        "title": "Overarm bowling",
        "text": "In cricket, overarm bowling refers to a delivery in which the bowler's hand is above shoulder height.\nWhen cricket originated all bowlers delivered the ball underarm, where the bowler's hand is below waist height. However, so the story goes, John Willes became the first bowler to use a \"round-arm\" technique after practising with his sister Christine Willes, who had used the technique, as she was unable to bowl underarm due to her wide and huge skirt impeding her delivery of the ball.\nA roundarm delivery is where the hand is between shoulder height and waist height;\nAfter roundarm was legalised in 1835 with the bowler allowed to deliver the ball at shoulder height, it was not long before some bowlers began to raise the hand above the shoulder. The Laws of Cricket at that time directed that such a delivery be called a no-ball. In 1845, the law was strengthened by removing the benefit of doubt from the bowler in height of hand questions, the umpire's view of the incident being final.\nEven so, it was only a matter of time before confrontation occurred. The problem was that many umpires were themselves bowlers and believed that the bowler should be allowed to bowl with a fully raised hand. The watershed was reached on 26 August 1862 at The Oval when Surrey hosted All-England. The England bowler Edgar Willsher deliberately bowled overarm and was no-balled six times in succession by umpire John Lillywhite, ironically the son of William Lillywhite, the famous bowler who had done so much to have roundarm legalised in 1835.\nIn what was surely a pre-rehearsed demonstration, Willsher and the other eight professionals in the England team staged a walk-off, leaving their two amateur colleagues looking non-plussed in the middle. Play continued next day, but Lillywhite diplomatically withdrew and was replaced by another umpire.\nMCC responded to this \"crisis\" with rather more haste than they had to roundarm, and changed the Laws of Cricket in time for the 1864 season. Law 10 was rewritten to allow the bowler to bring his arm through at any height providing he kept it straight and did not throw the ball. This completed the evolution of bowling and the overarm style has remained predominant ever since, though some conservatives (including W G Grace, no less) did continue to bowl roundarm till the end of their careers; and even underarm itself was still seen occasionally.\nAn interesting historical development of the legalisation of overarm was that for many years, 1864 was deemed to mark the start of \"first-class cricket\" which suggested that earlier cricket was \"second-class\". The 1864 origin has been strongly challenged: \"see also\" First-class cricket."

        "title": "Boardwalk and Baseball",
        "text": "Boardwalk and Baseball was a theme park built near Haines City, Florida, at the southeast corner of the Interstate 4-US 27 interchange. It replaced Circus World at the same location, and was owned by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Park Group (now Harcourt, a division of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt). It opened in April 1987, and closed January 17, 1990.\nThe park reused many of Circus World's rides and exhibits. The petting zoos were removed, the rides and shows were rethemed, and Baseball City Stadium was built on the site. There were several exhibits that borrowed artifacts from the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. HBJ attracted the Kansas City Royals from Fort Myers, Florida, to make Baseball City Stadium their new spring training home and the site of their Class A Florida State League affiliate, the Baseball City Royals. They also had a Rookie-level affiliate in the Gulf Coast League, one of two lowest level minor leagues in the U.S. (along with the Arizona League).\nIn addition, ESPN taped a quiz bowl-style game show, \"Boardwalk and Baseball's Super Bowl of Sports Trivia\", on the site which aired in 1988 and 1989.\nAlthough the park was considered superior to its predecessor, it was predicted to fail by industry observers at the grand opening. It mostly reused Circus World's relatively standard rides, which were considered no match as a Walt Disney World competitor. Industry observers were proved correct, as the project was quickly falling into financial ruin within 18 months of its grand opening, at which point, employee layoffs and reduced hours were used to try to cut costs. To further limit expenses, the park closed before sunset for almost the entire year, rendering its antique style gas lighting (that cost over $1 million to install) useless.\nHistory.\nJim Monaghan sold Circus World for stock to Harcourt Brace Jovanovich on May 10, 1986. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, which had just bought several parks including the SeaWorld parks and Cypress Gardens, had a new idea for the area, and closed the park at opening time that day to rebuild it into Boardwalk and Baseball. The company expected to have the park open in December 1986. With Circus World's poor reputation, Boardwalk and Baseball was expected by HBJ to restore the park's stature, and would have the expertise available through its purchase of other theme parks, Sea World and Cypress Gardens, the year before. HBJ spent $50 million transforming the park and adding the baseball stadium.\nThe Class A Florida State League Royal affiliate was purchased by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich in early 1987 with the team to move here.\nBoardwalk and Baseball opened in April 1987 with two baseball diamonds. Ted Williams, Don Drysdale, and Mel Allen participated in the opening day festivities. In June, the three HBJ Orlando area parks offered three-day passes with one day at each park, priced below Walt Disney World combo tickets. Baseball City Stadium opened for its first event, the seventh annual Pizza Hut All-Star Softball game, on February 7, 1988 and televised live on NBC. Attendance in 1988 was 1.35 million, but dropped 24% in 1989 to 1.03 million. In August 1989, HBJ put its theme parks up for sale as a group.\nDecline and closure.\nHarcourt Brace Jovanovich sold its theme park assets (which included SeaWorld and Cypress Gardens) to Busch Entertainment Corporation in September 1989 due to mounting debt, and they closed the park on January 17, 1990. The stadium would continue its operations, while the park and stadium were up for sale. The Kansas City Royals had a spring training contract until 2002 and the Baseball City Royals would also continue regular play at the stadium. With 876 employees at closure, the park was one of Polk County's largest employers. Most of it was demolished except for the stadium and a building that held an IMAX theatre (the very first one at Circus World). The Baseball City Royals (FSL) were sold following the 1992 season and moved to Daytona Beach, Florida, becoming the Daytona Cubs (now the Daytona Tortugas), where they remain to this day. The Gulf Coast League Royals, who had moved at the same time to Ft. Myers, returned in 2000 for their final three years in Florida before being replaced by the Arizona League Royals. The Kansas City Royals moved their spring training home and entire Florida operations department to Surprise, Arizona in 2003. The stadium and theatre were demolished soon afterward.\nAfter sitting idle for over a decade, the site was sold to developer Victor Posner in 2001. Posner Park, a large retail complex with several big box stores, opened on the site in 2008, eliminating the final traces of the long-gone park.\n\"Super Bowl of Sports Trivia\".\n\"Boardwalk and Baseball's Super Bowl of Sports Trivia\" was a sports trivia show in a College Bowl format taped at a Boardwalk and Baseball studio by Ohlmeyer Communications and broadcast on ESPN from 1988 to 1989.\nThe show was hosted by Chris Berman and featured single-elimination tournaments of three-person teams representing U.S. colleges and universities. The first season of \"Super Bowl of Sports Trivia\" was filmed over five days at a studio at the theme park in January 1988. Washington State University won the 1988 tournament."

        "title": "Billy Smith (rugby league, born 1942)",
        "text": "William John Smith (born 12 July 1942 in Fremantle, Western Australia) is an Australian former rugby league footballer. He was the leading in Australian rugby league during the late 1960s, and a keystone of the latter part of the St. George Dragons' eleven consecutive premiership victories between 1956 and 1966. He represented Australia in eighteen Tests and eight World Cup games between 1964 and 1970. He captained Australia in a World Cup game against Great Britain in 1970.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Fremantle, Western Australia, the son of a Scottish fisherman, Smith grew up in Mortdale, New South Wales in the St George area. After playing rugby union and Australian rules football, he took to junior league early playing with Mortdale and the Renown club. \nHe starred in his junior football, was spotted by St. George talent scouts and was first graded at age 16. He played in third grade in 1959 for the Dragons before his father objected and he returned to Renown for two more seasons in the juniors.\nClub career.\nHe returned to St. George in 1960 as a . After a few games in 1961 and 1962 he established a permanent place in 1963 when Reg Gasnier's first and second-choice partners (Johnny Riley and Dave Brown) were both forced out by injury. Billy Smith went on to play fifteen seasons at St. George Dragons between 1963 and 1977.\nIn 1964, Smith was shifted to halfback and adapted quickly under Norm Provan's coaching and on-field practice. His was a pivotal member of the Dragons' Premiership winning sides of 1963, 1964, 1965 and 1966. In 1966 he was named New South Wales Player of the year and won \"The Sun-Herald\"'s Best and Fairest Player award.\nBy 1967 the St George side had lost many of its stars and all of its pack of fearsome forwards. Smith's abilities and his uncanny partnership with Graeme Langlands are credited with enabling the club to remain competitive through to the mid seventies.\nDue to injury he missed the first half of the 1971 season. His three vital field goals in the final won St. George a place in the 1971 Grand Final where they were beaten by South Sydney.\nHalfway through 1972 he was injured and played in third grade when he returned. By 1976, Smith was suffering from severe leg problems and his previously brilliant kicking game was gone. He captained the reserve grade side to a Grand Final win in 1976 and spent most of 1977 in reserve grade. At the end of the 1977 season he was cut from the club after a prank on a sponsor's bus trip to the Penfolds Vineyard went wrong. Smith was 35 and had played a record 296 games in all grades with St. George – the club's standing record.\nBilly Smith was awarded Life Membership of the St. George Dragons in 1973.\nPlaying style.\nSmall in size compared to most rugby league players, Smith was renowned for his toughness. He was capable of challenging any opponent head-on on the field, and his organising and kicking skills were a vital part of St. George's success during his career.\nLegendary rugby league hardman John Sattler is quoted as follows in the Writer reference:\nRepresentative career.\nHe made his Test debut against France in 1964 in his first season as a halfback. In 1966 Smith won the Harry Sunderland Medal when Australia retained the Ashes at home for the first time. His tackling of the heavyweight English forwards was the decisive factor in this win, and was praised heartily by the press. For the next five years Smith missed (due to injury) only one Test match in which Australia was involved.\nIn 1967 Smith won the Harry Sunderland Medal again (this time for his performance against New Zealand and was an automatic selection for the Kangaroo tour later that year. He played in five Tests and ten minor tour matches but misbehaviour on that tour threatened his international career. He was however chosen in Australia's World cup squad in 1968, toured New Zealand in 1969 and was picked against Great Britain in 1970 for all three Tests of the domestic Ashes series.\nIn spite of having been fined half his 1967-68 tour bonus, when it came time to pick the 1970 World Cup squad, Smith was selected as vice-captain and, after injury to captain Ron Coote, Smith enjoyed the honour of leading his country in a tournament match against Great Britain at Headingley in October 1970 in which he was also named as man-of-the-match.\nHe featured in Australia's 1970 World Cup Final (the \"Battle of Leeds\") won 12–7 and was sent off in the 78th minute. Further injuries prevented Smith retaining his Test spot despite his 110% effort every time he took the field.\nAll up Smith appeared in seven Tests against Britain, five against New Zealand and six against France. He appeared in eight matches across the 1968 and 1970 World Cups. He is listed on the \"Australian Players Register\" as Kangaroo No. 392.\nCoaching and post-playing accolades.\nAfter Smith retired as a player, he joined former Dragon teammate Norm Provan as an assistant coach with Cronulla. Provan took the Sharks to the grand final in 1978, only to be crushed in a replay by the unstoppable Graham Eadie, and to third at the end of the 1979 home-and-away season. Smith concurrently coached the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks reserve grade side to two grand finals in 1978 and 1979. It was thought in 1979 that Smith would be likely to succeed Provan, his former captain, mentor and long-time friend, as Cronulla first-grade coach, but he resigned controversially after a preliminary semi-final thrashing by Parramatta. Provan would be succeeded by Tommy Bishop, under whom in 1980 Cronulla fell to ninth with only four wins in their final fifteen matches.\nSmith was named in Australia's best team from 1970 to 1985 by \"Rugby League Week\", and gained two votes in 1995 as best halfback of the limited-tackle era.\nIn February 2008, Smith was named in the list of Australia's \"100 Greatest Players\" (1908–2007) which was commissioned by the NRL and ARL to celebrate the code's centenary year in Australia.\nOn 20 July 2022, Smith was named in the St. George Dragons District Rugby League Clubs team of the century at halfback."

        "title": "Chinese Professional Baseball League",
        "text": "The Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL; ) is the top-tier professional baseball league in Taiwan. The league was established in 1989 and played the first season in 1990. CPBL eventually absorbed the competing Taiwan Major League in 2003. As of the 2024 season, the CPBL consists of six organizations, all of which have teams in the main league and farm league.\nThe CPBL consists of Major () and, since 2006, Minor () leagues, with the Minor league team rosters consist of developmental and injury-recovering players.\nCPBL TV is CPBL's official paid live-streaming and video-on-demand platform. It receives signals from each team's broadcasting partners and is available worldwide.\nHistory.\nBaseball was first introduced to Taiwan during Japanese rule, and gained popularity when the national little league baseball teams won numerous Little League World Series championships in the 1970s and 1980s. The national baseball team also performed exceptionally well in many international competitions. However, the development of baseball in Taiwan was limited due to the lack of a professional league, and therefore many players were reluctant to commit to the sport.\nThe idea of forming a professional baseball league in Taiwan was first suggested by local Brother Hotel's chairman Hung Teng-sheng (洪騰勝). He formed his amateur Brother Hotel baseball team in 1984, and intended to professionalize his team and form a professional league within a few years. Throughout 1988 and 1989, Hung visited numerous Taiwanese businesses, trying to convince them to form professional baseball clubs. Most of his requests were rejected, but Wei Chuan Corporation, Mercuries Chain Stores, and Uni-President Corporation all supported the idea and formed teams. The Chinese Professional Baseball League was established on October 23, 1989, with Hung Teng-sheng acting as secretary-general. Because of his contribution to professional baseball in Taiwan, Hung is sometimes referred to as the \"Father of the CPBL.\" Chung Meng-shun (鍾孟舜) designed every original logo of the four founding teams.\nExpansions in the 1990s.\nWith the popularity rise in the first few years, the Jungo Bears and China Times Eagles joined in 1993. The Koos Group Whales joined in 1997.\nThe league consisted of seven teams in the 1997 season which is the maximum in CPBL history.\nGame-fixing scandals and decline in popularity.\nThe Black Eagles Incident in 1997 resulted in a major popularity decline. The China Times Eagles became defunct after the 1997 season. The Wei Chuan Dragons and Mercuries Tigers also became defunct after the 1999 season, prior to which the Dragons had won all championships from 1997 to 1999.\nMerger with Taiwan Major League.\nIn 1997, the newly founded Taiwan Major League began to compete with the CPBL. The two leagues were often competing with each other, but eventually, the TML merged with the CPBL.\nRecent expansions.\nIn May 2019, Commissioner John Wu announced that CPBL had reached agreement with Ting Hsin International Group to join the league by reactivating a former team, the Wei Chuan Dragons. The Dragons participated in the minor league in 2020, and returned to the major league in 2021.\nAfter Tsai Chi-chang became commissioner in 2021, he proposed that Kaohsiung serve as the location for a new team since it was the only major city in Taiwan without a CPBL team at the time. In February 2022, Tsai announced that the sixth team would either be formed by Chunghwa Telecom or Taiwan Steel Group. It was later announced that the expansion team would be by Taiwan Steel Group. The proposed team name is TSG Hawks, and their home field would be Chengcing Lake Stadium in Kaohsiung.\n2020 season and COVID-19.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the opening day of the 31st CPBL season on March 14 was delayed. It was originally brought earlier compared to previous seasons to accommodate the final qualifying tournament of 2021 Tokyo Olympics.\nOn 1 April, the CPBL announced that the season would begin from 11 April as the Rakuten Monkeys hosted the Chinatrust Brothers with the games being playing without live fans. This received international coverage because other major baseball leagues such as the MLB in North America, the NPB in Japan, and the KBO in South Korea, which were still severely impacted by the virus outbreak were unable to confirm the dates of their respective season openings. The annual CPBL All-Star Game was cancelled for the first time to accommodate to the compact schedule.\nNaming issue.\nThe name \"Chinese Professional Baseball League\" has attracted debate among Taiwanese baseball fans. Owing to the ambiguous political status of Taiwan and the Nagoya Resolution, the Republic of China (Taiwan) was forced to use the name of \"Chinese Taipei\" under pressure from the People's Republic of China. Many have called to for the name of CPBL be changed, with suggestions including the replacement of “Chinese” with “Taiwan”, “Formosa” or “Chunghwa”.\nIn the 2018 Taiwanese referendum, CPBL officials publicly rejected the proposal for Taiwan to compete as \"Taiwan\" in the 2020 Summer Olympics, for fear that Taiwanese athletes may risk losing eligibility. The league received criticism for holding this stance while selling official merchandise that said \"Team Taiwan.\"\nIn April 2020, Premier Su Tseng-chang said that in order to elevate Taiwan's visibility in the world, there was a need to distinguish Taiwan from China in the naming of China Airlines and CPBL. A New Power Party survey showed that 62% of Taiwanese people support changing the name of the league to distinguish itself from Chinese baseball and avoid confusion.\nIn January 2021, CPBL commissioner Tsai Chi-chang agreed that spectators should be made aware that the league was being played in Taiwan and not China, but that a name change was not a top priority.\nOrganizations.\nAll teams are owned by and named after large Taiwanese corporations, a similar practice seen in Japan's NPB and South Korea's KBO. Each team manages a regional market with a home city, but does not play its games exclusively in that market. Other than the home cities, regular season games are also held in Hsinchu, Douliu, Chiayi, Pingtung, Luodong, Hualien, and Taitung with less frequency.\nEach season spans from March to October, with a one-week all-star break in June or July, which separates the season into first and second half-seasons. Playoffs are held in late October or early November, with three teams competing in two rounds. A team may qualify for playoffs either by winning a half-season title, or be awarded a wild card berth by attaining the highest place in the seasonal ranks. If a team wins a half-season title, it will not be considered in the seasonal ranks when the winner of the wild card is being decided. If both half seasons were won by the same team, another wild card berth will be given through the same mechanism after the first berth has been awarded\nBetween 2005 and 2013, the champion team will represent Taiwan in the Asia Series to compete with other champion teams from Nippon Professional Baseball (Japan Series), KBO League (Korean Series), Australian Baseball League (Claxton Shield), and the WBSC Europe (European Champion Cup).\nForeign players.\nA typical monthly salary for a foreign player is in between 25,000 and 50,000 USD, these positions are normally filled by AA, AAA, or Japanese minor leaguers. The number of foreign players allowed on a team's roster is limited to four. Of the four players only three are allowed to be activated on the major league roster, the remaining foreign player can practice and prepare with the team or play in the minors. A foreign player, once sent to the minor league team, must wait a week before being allowed to be recalled to the major league.\nForeign players, from regions other than Japan and South Korea, are given Chinese epithets to increase familiarity with Taiwanese fans. These epithets, usually two to three characters in length, are generally loose transliterations of the players' names and are generally chosen as terms meant to convey strength or might. One example is Jeff Andra, whose epithet is \"Feiyong\" (飛勇) — meaning, literally, a flying brave man. Recently however, most foreign players are just simply given a direct Chinese transcription. Some players (mostly foreign players) have now adopted the custom in the rest of the world by placing their surnames on the back of their jerseys using the Latin alphabet. Some teams now have adopted Latin alphabet jerseys, a trend that has picked up in recent years. The Fubon Guardians only have uniforms with such, and the other teams are adopting such jerseys on occasion.\nMinor League.\nThe CPBL Minor League took shape in late 2003 as a result of cooperation with Chinese Taipei Baseball Association. Alternative service draftees, players deemed eligible to complete their national service obligation in the field of baseball, were sent to the CPBL member organizations to fill their roster. There are currently 6 minor league teams, each plays about 80 games annually. Similar to the NPB's minor leagues, the minor league teams are each owned by CPBL member clubs as reserve teams rather than independent organizations.\nLeague Champions.\nTitles by teams as of the end of the 2023 CPBL season:\nThe Taiwan Series was not held in 1992, 1994 and 1995 because the Brother Elephants and the Uni-President Lions had won the titles by virtue of winning both half-seasons.\nAll-star game.\nAn all-star game has been held since 1990. \nHome Run Derby.\nA home run derby has been held since 1992. It is usually held the day before the all-star game.\nCulture.\nCheersticks are a pair of plastic sticks, often seen at baseball games in Taiwan. They are banged together to make noise."

        "title": "Bob Elliott (baseball)",
        "text": "Robert Irving Elliott (November 26, 1916May 4, 1966) was an American third baseman and right fielder in Major League Baseball who played most of his career with the Pittsburgh Pirates and Boston Braves. He also briefly managed and coached in the Majors. Born in San Francisco, California, the right-handed batting and throwing Elliott stood tall and weighed .\nElliott contributed some of the happiest memories to the Braves' final Boston years, winning the National League Most Valuable Player Award and earning the nickname \"Mr. Team.\" The following season, his power hitting helped lift Boston to its second National League pennant of the 20th century, the team's first in 34 years, and last before relocating to Milwaukee. He was the second Major League third baseman to have five seasons of 100 runs batted in, joining Pie Traynor, and retired with the highest career slugging percentage (.440) of any NL third baseman. He also led the National League in assists three times and in putouts and double plays twice each, and ended his career among the NL leaders in games (8th, 1262), assists (7th, 2547), total chances (10th, 4113) and double plays (4th, 231) at third base.\nEarly career with Pirates.\nRaised in El Centro, California, he attended El Centro Junior College and signed with the Pirates in 1936. Elliott came to the Major Leagues as an outfielder in 1939. As a right-handed batter, his power hitting was hampered by the spacious left field at Forbes Field, but in eight years with the team he compiled more than 100 RBI three times, and he batted .315 in 1943. Manager Frankie Frisch shifted him to third base after the 1941 season, seeking to take advantage of his strong arm while compensating for his lack of speed. Exempted from World War II military service due to head injuries from being hit by a batted ball in 1943, Elliott was named to the NL All-Star team in 1941, 1942, 1944 and 1945, and finished among the top ten players in the MVP voting from 1942 through 1944, placing second in the league in RBI the last two years.\nOn July 15, 1945, he hit for the cycle. After the 1946 season, he was traded to the Braves in a lopsided deal for 37-year-old second baseman Billy Herman, a future member of the Baseball Hall of Fame who was named Pittsburgh's playing manager for 1947. But Herman was aghast at the price — Elliott — the Pirates had paid for him. \"Why, they've gone and traded the whole team on me\", he said. Herman played only 15 more Major League games and the other three players made a total of 127 appearances with the Pirates.\nBoston's \"Mr. Team\".\nWith a friendlier hitting environment at Braves Field, Elliott exceeded the 20 home run mark three times in his five years in Boston, equalling Whitey Kurowski for the most 20-HR seasons by an NL third baseman. In his 1947 MVP campaign, Elliott did not lead the NL in any offensive category; however, he batted .317 (second in the NL), with 22 home runs and 113 runs batted in, all team highs. In 1948, when the Braves won the pennant, Elliott batted .283 with 23 homers and 100 RBI and made his sixth All-Star team. He also led the Major Leagues with 131 walks, breaking the club record of 110 set by Billy Hamilton in 1896; it remains the franchise record. Batting cleanup, he hit .333 in the 1948 World Series, which Boston lost in six games to the Cleveland Indians; he had a pair of home runs in his first two at bats in Game 5, an 11–5 victory, and was 3 for 3 with a walk in the final 4–3 loss in Game 6.\nAlthough his numbers declined somewhat thereafter, Elliott enjoyed productive years from through , including a season batting .305 with 24 home runs and 107 RBI in , his sixth 100-RBI campaign. He was named to his last All-Star squad in 1951, his final year with Boston. By the early 1950s he had broken Kurowski's NL record for career home runs at third base, though Eddie Mathews surpassed him within a few seasons.\nLate playing career.\nElliott's playing career began to wind down in 1952, as he struggled with the New York Giants following an April trade, and ended after a 1953 campaign split between the St. Louis Browns and Chicago White Sox. Over 15 years (1939–53) and 1,978 games, Elliott batted .289 and collected 2,061 hits, 170 home runs, 382 doubles, 94 triples, 1,064 runs, 967 bases on balls and 1,195 RBI. Elliott's last highlight was two home runs on opening night for the Giants in 1952, both off Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Robin Roberts. His final Major League game occurred on September 16, 1953, for the White Sox.\nElliott then returned to California in 1954 and played for his hometown team, the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League, for the second half of the season. He hit two home runs and drove in five runs in the final game of the year, helping the Padres to win the pennant for the first time since 1937, the team's second year in the PCL (when they were led by 19-year-old San Diegan star Ted Williams).\nManager and coach.\nHe became the Padres' manager in 1955 and managed them through the first 35 games of the 1957 season. He also managed the Sacramento Solons of the Pacific Coast League in 1959. After a third-place finish in Sacramento, Elliott received his only Major League managing opportunity when he took over the Kansas City Athletics for the season. But the Athletics were one of the weakest teams in the American League, and the team's owner, Arnold Johnson, died suddenly just before the season began. The A's won only 58 games while losing 96 (.377) in Elliott's only season at the helm, finishing in last place. He was fired by new owner Charles O. Finley at season's end, and replaced by Joe Gordon. In , Elliott was a coach for the expansion Los Angeles Angels during their maiden AL campaign.\nLess than five years later, Elliott died at age 49 in San Diego after suffering a ruptured vein in his windpipe. He was survived by his wife, Skippy, two daughters, Judy Gale and Cheryl Townsend, and grandchildren Daren Klum, Chris Townsend and Bob Townsend. Elliott is buried at Greenwood Memorial Park in San Diego.\nElliott was posthumously inducted into both the San Diego Hall of Champions (1967) and the Boston Braves Hall of Fame (1997)."

        "title": "Spirit of Surfing",
        "text": "Spirit of Surfing is a low-key initiative started in 1995 by longtime surfer, Peter Cuming, surf elders Rob Conneelly, and Nat Young, and surf artist Roscoe Kermode. Spirit of Surfing was established to promote the traditions of free surfing; respect for the ocean, the land, and indigenous and local cultures wherever surfers are and travel; fostering community spirit; and an harmonious relationship with the natural environment. These key messages are shared and encouraged in the water amongst surfers and through other opportunities such as festivals, forums, gatherings and local surfing communities. It was first presented to the Angourie Boardriders in late 1995, at Yamba, in NSW. They adopted the general Spirit of Surfing (SoS) principles in their approach to their activities including a stronger focus on active beach restoration work as part of their regular surfing sessions and competitions. Peter Cuming liaised with Nat Young, past world short and longboard surfing champion, who supported the aims, and raised the concept in his working relationship with the World Longboard Championship Tour to engage in adopting the principles.\nThe Surfers Code, or Tribal Law (Lore) as it was initially called, was developed as an SoS project by Rob Conneelly, based on the verbally shared \"Gentlemen's Rules\" of old; seeded by ideas and discussion of the concept between Conneelly and Cuming, liaison with Aboriginal musician-surfer, Merv Graham, surfer Wayne Murphy, and design support from Roscoe Kermode. This resulted in a “Tribal Law” poster which emerged under Roscoe's skilled hands, and was launched at the Margaret River Surfing Classic in 1996, which also included an “expression session” to promote creative ‘free’ surfing. It was again part of the Margaret River Masters Surf Classic in 1997, and the focus of a project with local community healthcare groups in Margaret River, sponsored by the W.A Health Promotion Foundation, in response to growing surf related injuries, and promoting the necessary safety aspects of surfing along the powerful South-Western Australian coastline. In October 1998, at Margaret River in Western Australia, the group erected a Tribal Law (Tribal Lore) plaque at Surfer's Point, explaining surfers' principles of right-of-way, safety and respect in the water. Follow-up plaques at ‘Lefthanders’ and other well-known nearby breaks in the South West were planned, as well as at Perth surf beaches, and plaques created however didn't eventuate. To this daythe plaques haven't resurfaced and must truly be valued by those that have them! \nHearing of the Surfer's Code and the Margaret River plaque, a group of surfing interests from the West Coast of Victoria-based around Bells Beach-Winkipop contacted SoS trust members and with Roscoe Kermode's artistic support, a code was developed for Bells Beach and launched as the Bells Beach Surfers Code in 2000. The Bells Beach Spirit of Surfing committee was formed to further develop projects at Bells Beach. This committee includes the Surf Coast Shire, Torquay Boardriders, Surfers Appreciating the Natural Environment (SANE), Surfing Victoria Inc. Surfrider Foundation, and the Bells Beach Surfing Reserve Advisory Committee. Victorian-based Mornington Peninsular Surfriders, hearing of the surfers code, liaised with the Bells Beach group and arranged distribution of the general surfer's code poster as a guide for surfers on the East Coast Peninsular.\nSoS supported and facilitated the Spirit of Surfing/ Surf Elders Gathering held at Broken Head, Byron Bay, New South Wales, in June 2000, organised by and held at the home of longtime surfer and Greens New South Wales Senator, Ian Cohen. The 2-day weekend gathering of 30 people, facilitated by Peter Cuming, represented around 700 years of personal surfing experience. It included representatives from the Surfrider Foundation, Australian Professional Surfing Association, and surfers from Southern Queensland, Sydney, NSW North Coast and Central Coasts, and Bells Beach/Victorian West Coast regions. Surfing elders such as George Greenough, Nat Young, Dick Hoole and Rusty Miller shared visions and stories. The gathering discussed the growing interest in the sport and lifestyle of surfing, concerns about commercialisation, ‘surf rage’ and the Spirit of Surfing concept. As a result of the gathering the principles and establishment of the Spirit of Surfing Trust was supported. A number of media releases presented the key issues that the Spirit of Surfing concept was tackling and commitments were made to promote the SoS principles.\nLater that year, the Surfrider Foundation in NSW, launched a version of the Surfers Code, under the guidance of Neil Lazarow with support from the formative Spirit of Surfing Trust, A ‘Law of the Ocean’ forum, sponsored by Southern Cross University, was also held in Byron Bay in 2001, and discussed a range of issues, implications and responses related to ‘surf rage’ events, including the Surfers Code and Spirit of Surfing concept.\nIn 2000 when Nat Young was seriously assaulted in a \"surf rage\" incident at Angourie Point, he gifted $7000 he received as payment from a television interview on the incident to the SoS initiative. These funds were used to support the work of the movement including development of the Bells Beach, Victoria, Spirit of Surfing (SoS) project. Through 2000 to 2002 the Bells Beach SoS working group, supported by SoS consulted with local surfing groups, Aboriginal traditional owners and the local council, Surf Coast Shire to design and erect key standing stones reading \"Respect the Ocean\", \"Respect the Land\", \"Respect each Other\", as a local interpretation of the surfing spirit. These stones are seen by all surfers who use the path to the famous Bells Beach break. The project involved locating and installing hand carved sandstone plaques, and a signing ceremony involving some of the first surfers to surf Bells Beach, local Aboriginal custodians, Surf Coast Shire, Bells Beach Surfing Reserve, SoS, Surfrider Foundation, SANE and Torquay boardrider club representatives.\nThe Pacifique Boardriders, near Bundaberg, in Central Queensland established an SoS Project at their focus beach at Bargara. Initially established in 1963 the Pacific Boardriders were renewed in the early 2000s with a membership of over 200. The group's aims and objectives as well as surfing guidelines include the Spirit of Surfing's principles of safe and free surfing, and respecting the ocean, the land, and each other. A broader Spirit of Surfing project committee was also formed develop a creative signage installation at Bargara, to include representatives from the local indigenous Murri and South Sea islander community, local residents and Chamber of Commerce, and the Burnett River Shire Council.\nLynne Hulme from the Surf Coast Shire, Surf Coast Shire Council based at Torquay (and member of the Bells Beach SoS project) contacted SoS Trust to hold a 2nd Spirit of Surfing Gathering at Torquay, in April 2003, just before and as part of the iconic Bells annual surfing contest. Facilitated by Peter Cuming and Elizabeth Bragg, it was attended by over 70 people including surf elders, surfing industry representatives, surfboard designers, shapers, academics and government agencies, surf psychologists and educators, Surf Coast Shire representatives and regional surfers. Workshop proceedings were prepared from the forum which focused on the need to develop a more sustainable surfing industry, including codes of practice and sourcing of materials; educating travelling surfers about impacts on local cultures; encouraging surfers to play a greater role in protecting and regenerating coastal areas, dealing with anger/anger management in the water, and modern surfers developing more sustainable lifestyles.\nNat Young has continued to fund the development and erection of Surfers Code signage at a range of locations in Australia, Europe, and the USA (e.g. Rincon). This includes Byron Bay, where Cuming introduced the concept and a representative of the Bells Beach SoS working group to Ben King, president of the Byron Bay Boardriders Club, around 2005. Ben then worked with Nat Young, Byron Shire Council and Cape Byron Trust, to help establish Surfers Code signage at Clark's Beach near well known break The Pass, and at Broken Head.\nThe Surfers Code, and articles on its development and importance given increasing numbers of surfers in the water and ongoing commercialisation, have been printed to promote awareness in a wide range of surfing magazines, in Australia and internationally. This includes Tracks, Surfing World, Surfers Path, Surf Session (France), and Wave Surfgirl. A range of books and other publications such as Nat Young's 'Surf Rage' Nat Young, and 'Surf's Up - The Girl's Guide to Surfing' by Louise Southerden include the Spirit of Surfing and Surfer's Code principles.\nThe SoS has not accepted sponsorship at this stage on the basis that it may dilute or affect the capacity to promote the messages, however encourages industry and business participation in applying the principles. SoS has supported action by and participated in organisations such as the National Surfing Reserves Committee, which has established surfing reserves in key and iconic surfing locations, such as Angourie and Lennox Head, New South Wales.\nCuming was a forum panel speaker at the Byron Bay Surf Festival in 2014, on the impact of surfing culture in the developing world including indigenous communities. The forum was facilitated by surfer Lauren Hill, representing the SoS principles related to the influences surfing has, both positive and negative, on existing cultures, and the potential for surfing to support and strengthen the connection people have to their land, local communities, and cultures.\nSoS is in the process of developing a website which provides information on the range of SoS and Surfers Code projects, as well as surf elders, well-known surfboard designers, shapers, professional, recreational and free surfers, artists, musicians and activists expressing what the 'spirit of surfing' means to them."

        "title": "Frank Thomas (American football)",
        "text": "Frank William Thomas (November 15, 1898 – May 10, 1954) was an American football player and coach. He served as the head football coach at the University of Chattanooga from 1925 to 1928 and at the University of Alabama from 1931 to 1946, compiling a career college football record of 141–33–9. During his tenure at Alabama, Thomas amassed a record of 115–24–7 and won four Southeastern Conference titles while his teams allowed an average of just 6.3 points per game. Thomas's 1934 Alabama team completed a 10–0 season with a victory over Stanford in the Rose Bowl and was named national champion by a number of selectors.\nThomas's total wins and winning percentage at Alabama rank third all-time among Crimson Tide football coaches, behind only Nick Saban and Paul \"Bear\" Bryant, whom Thomas coached in the mid-1930s. Thomas never coached a losing season, and twice his teams had undefeated, 10-win campaigns. Thomas was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1951.\nEarly life.\nThomas was born in Muncie, Indiana. His parents, James and Elizabeth Williams Thomas, were recent immigrants from Cardiff, Wales. He was a star athlete in high school.\nCollege athletics.\nAfter spending two years at Western State (MI), Thomas transferred to Notre Dame and played quarterback for coach Knute Rockne from 1920 to 1922. According to Rockne, Thomas was the smartest player he ever coached. Thomas's roommate and best friend at Notre Dame was George \"The Gipper\" Gipp.\nCareer.\nAfter graduating from Notre Dame, Thomas became an assistant coach at the University of Georgia for two years before earning his first head coaching job in 1925 at the University of Chattanooga, where his teams' record was 26–9–2 in four seasons. In 1931, he accepted the head coaching job at the University of Alabama, where he established himself as one of the top coaches in the nation. His bowl record at Alabama was 4–2, with wins at the Rose Bowl (1935, 1946), Cotton Bowl Classic (1942), and Orange Bowl (1943). He became the coach and mentor to future Hall of Fame coach Paul \"Bear\" Bryant. Other notable players included Don Hutson, Vaughn Mancha, Harry Gilmer, Johnny Cain, and Riley Smith.\nA frequent smoker, Thomas commonly smoked cigars on the sidelines during games. Thomas fell ill with heart and lung disease. Too weak to both coach and take care of his mentally ill daughter, his declining health finally forced his resignation from coaching in 1946. He remained Alabama's athletic director.\nDeath and legacy.\nIn 1951, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. Thomas died in 1954 at the age of 55 at Druid City Hospital in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. An illustrated book published later that year told his story. The football practice fields at the University of Alabama are named for Thomas and his successor, Harold Drew.\nIn 2006, a bronze statue of Thomas was erected outside of the University of Alabama's Bryant–Denny Stadium alongside the statues of Wallace Wade, Bear Bryant, Gene Stallings and now Nick Saban, the other head coaches who have led Alabama to national championships."

        "text": "The Northeastern University women's swimming and diving team debuted in the Fall of 1978 under the coaching staff of NU hall of fame member Janet Swanson. Since its inception, the Boston-based team has grown into one of the most respected and competitive Division I aquatics programs in New England. Northeastern was a member of the America East Conference from 1990 to 2005 and is currently a member of the Colonial Athletic Association.\nHistory.\nIn 1993, former Dartmouth College Swimming head coach Roy Coates took over the Northeastern University program. Under Coates, the team built a solid foundation to set the tone for America East Conference dominance in the early 2000s. This included an undefeated 2001-02 season capped off by a final in season win over cross town rival Boston College. The team won the AE conference championship in 2000 and successfully defended the title 5 years in a row until the University of New Hampshire narrowly broke its streak.\nDuring this time period NU was bolstered by a large group of versatile swimmers that eventually broke an unprecedented 13 of the 15 school swimming records between 2002-2005. These athletes included Katie Schmaling (50 Free, 100-200 Back), Sarah Reddick (100 Free, 100 Fly, 100-200 IM), Kelly McIsaac (200 Freestyle), Jesse Coxson (500 Freestyle), Emily White (200 Butterfly), Katie Kane (100 Breaststroke), Kristen Kane (200 Breaststroke), and Kerby Lewis (400 IM). All five relay records were re-established during the 2004 season as well.\nEqually successful was the diving portion of the team coached by Brad Snodgrass. After following the lead of NU legends Katie Mailman and Jane deLima, Romania native Adela \"Dea\" Gavozdea dominated in her three-year tenure at NU qualifying for the NCAA championships 3 years in a row and was named the America East Most Outstanding Diver in the 2003-04 season."

        "title": "Super Bowl ring",
        "text": "The Super Bowl ring is an award in the National Football League given to the team members of the winning team of the league's annual championship game, the Super Bowl. The Super Bowl ring offers a collectible memento for the actual players and team members to keep for themselves to symbolize their victory. There are also rings provided to the runners-up team of the Super Bowl.\nRings are also awarded to members of the team which wins the AFC or NFC championship. The NFL also provides postseason pay to all players as long as they have spent at least three games on their team's active or reserve list; the playoff bonus money is spread evenly within a team among starters, backups, and injured players.\nDetails.\nThese rings are typically made of yellow or rose gold with diamonds. They usually include the team name, team logo, the phrase, \"World Champions,\", and the Super Bowl number (usually indicated in Roman numerals). Many rings feature diamonds in the shape of the Vince Lombardi Trophy or a football, to illustrate the number of Super Bowls that the franchise has won. Also, the rings are customized with the player's name and uniform number. The NFL contributes approximately $5,000-$7,000 per ring for up to 150 rings for the winning team; any additional costs are borne by the team. Most rings are manufactured by memorabilia company Jostens. The rings are normally presented in an elegant box and/or display case.\nThe winning team can typically present any number of rings to whomever they choose, including usually, but not limited to: players (active roster, inactive roster, or injured reserve), coaches, trainers, executives, personnel, and general club staff. Some teams have given rings to former players and coaches that were on the team at some point during the season, despite not having been on the winning roster for the Super Bowl itself. Sometimes a team will make rings available to fans as part of a charity raffle. A recent trend over the last 15–20 years has been to present lesser-valued rings to non-player and front office staff. These are commonly called \"B\" and \"C\" level rings (while the player rings would be considered \"A\" rings) and are smaller and contain fewer diamonds or imitation diamonds. The first instance of this was the Redskins Super Bowl XVII ring when many in the front office received rings that were not solid gold and contained cubic zirconia stones (which resemble diamonds). When Tampa Bay won Super Bowl XXXVII, the players and coaches received \"A\" rings with a diamond-centered Lombardi trophy. Some staff received rings with a metal Lombardi trophy substituted, with real diamonds surrounding the trophy, while the \"C\" level ring did not contain any diamonds. Per the CBA, players that were on the winning team's practice squad at the time of the Super Bowl victory are also entitled to a ring, but it can be one of lesser value.\nThe Green Bay Packers' Super Bowl XLV ring contained more than 100 diamonds. The Packers logo, in the center of the ring, was made up of 13 diamonds, one for each championship title the team has won, dating back to 1929. The New England Patriots Super Bowl XLIX rings reportedly cost $36,500 each, making them the most expensive rings Jostens had ever produced at that time, only to be surpassed by the rings awarded for Super Bowl 50 and Super Bowl LI. The New England Patriots' Super Bowl LI ring has 283 diamonds, to commemorate their comeback from being down 28–3 versus the Atlanta Falcons late in the 3rd quarter, about which Falcons owner Arthur Blank reportedly confronted Patriots owner Robert Kraft in August 2017 over his perceived \"insult-by-karat\". The Philadelphia Eagles' ring for Super Bowl LII contains 127 diamonds on the bezel, which is the total from the numbers of the jerseys of the three players who handled the ball after the snap on the Philly Special trick play—Corey Clement (30), Trey Burton (88) and Nick Foles (9). The Tampa Bay Buccaneers ring for their Super Bowl LV victory contained 319 diamonds on the face to symbolize their 31–9 victory over Kansas City. That ring was also the first to have a removable top, which when opened reveals a hand-carved replica of Raymond James Stadium, where they became the first team to win a Super Bowl on their home field.\nIn recent years, rings are typically presented in ornate display cases. After winning Super Bowl 50, the Denver Broncos rings were handed out in large, ornate boxes, complete with a decorative padlock and commemorative game ball.\nValue and resale.\nReplicas of the rings for various years are popular collectibles, along with genuine rings. Dave Meggett is known to have placed his ring for sale on eBay. Two Super Bowl rings from the 1970 Steelers sold on eBay for over $69,000 apiece in mid-2008. Patriots safety Je'Rod Cherry raffled his ring from Super Bowl XXXVI in November 2008 to benefit several charities working to help children in Africa and Asia. Tight end Shannon Sharpe, meanwhile, gave his first Super Bowl ring to his brother Sterling, who had his career cut short by injury.\nIn 2005, a minor international incident occurred when it was reported that Russian President Vladimir Putin had taken a Super Bowl ring from New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft. Kraft quickly issued a statement saying that he had given Putin the ring out of \"respect and admiration\" he had for the Russian people and Putin's leadership. Kraft later said his earlier statement was not true, and had been issued under pressure from the White House. The ring is on display at the Kremlin, along with other \"gifts\"."

        "text": " is a golf-based sports simulation video game developed and released by Nintendo in 1984 for the Famicom in Japan. Later the same year, it was ported to the Nintendo VS. System as VS. Golf or Stroke and Match Golf, released in arcades internationally, followed by another arcade version called VS. Ladies Golf. The original was re-released for the NES in North America in 1985, and for the Famicom Disk System in 1986 in Japan.\n\"Golf\" was the best-selling sports game on the NES/Famicom, and was re-released across many years for different Nintendo consoles. It was hidden in the Nintendo Switch firmware as an Easter egg as a tribute to the game's programmer, the late Satoru Iwata.\nGameplay.\nThe main player wears a white shirt and shoes with blue pants and uses a white ball, while the second player wears a red shirt and shoes with black pants and uses a red ball. The player selects either single stroke play or the two-player selections of doubles stroke play or match play. The player is then placed at the tee of the first of 18 holes.\nIn 1991, Nintendo identified the golfer as Mario in a gameplay guide book. Nintendo's Wii game \"Captain Rainbow\" identifies the golfer as \"Ossan\", which happens to be one of the generic hero names during the development of \"Donkey Kong\". The Game Boy conversion would feature Mario on the Western cover art, but not the Japanese version.\nDevelopment and release.\nIn 1983, the Famicom had only three launch games, and its library would soon total seven, including \"Golf\". Shigeru Miyamoto said he was \"directly in charge of the character design and the game design\", and Satoru Iwata said he was the only programmer.\n\"Golf\" has been re-released on many other consoles after its release. Hudson Soft released a conversion of the game for the Japan-only PC-88 and Sharp X1 in 1985. \"Golf\" was converted to the Japan-only Family Computer Disk System on February 21, 1986. It was re-released for the Nintendo e-Reader for the Game Boy Advance in 2002. Both the NES and Game Boy versions were released on the Virtual Console. It was re-released on the Nintendo Switch via Nintendo eShop on October 25, 2019, by Hamster Corporation as part of its \"Arcade Archives\" series.\n\"Golf\" can be unlocked in the 2001 video games \"Dōbutsu no Mori\" for Nintendo 64 and \"Animal Crossing\" for GameCube. The latter supports Advance Play using a GameCube – Game Boy Advance link cable, allowing \"Golf\" to be played on a Game Boy Advance.\nThe game is a hidden Easter egg in the pre-4.0 firmware of the Nintendo Switch, in tribute to Satoru Iwata. Iwata was the sole programmer of \"Golf\" (as one of his first projects for Nintendo) and later became Nintendo's CEO.

        "text": "The Daren Sammy Cricket Ground, previously the Beausejour Cricket Ground, is a cricket ground located near Gros Islet, Saint Lucia standard seating capacity of 15,000. It was completed in 2002 and currently accommodates 13,000 spectators.\nOriginally named after the Beausejour hills and situated in the outskirts of Rodney Bay, the stadium was completed in 2002 and hosts domestic matches for the Windward Islands cricket team. It staged its first international Test match in 2003 against Sri Lanka and became the first venue in the Caribbean to host a day-night game.\nThe sporting facility was constructed on 22 acres consisting of about 18 hospitality suites and a pavilion that offers each team its own gym and lounge apart from a balcony and conference room. It is located in the driest area of Saint Lucia, making it most suitable for hosting cricket.\nOn 21 July 2016, it was formally renamed the Daren Sammy Cricket Ground after Daren Sammy who captained the West Indies side in winning the 2016 ICC World Twenty20 in India. He also captained the West Indies to victory in the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka, making him the second West Indian captain after Clive Lloyd with multiple ICC world championships. One of the stands will also be named in honour of Johnson Charles, who was also part of the side in both 2012 and 2016.\nThe first international match played at the renamed ground took place on 9 August 2016, when India played the West Indies as part of a four-match Test series.\nLocation.\nThe cricket ground is located at the north-eastern end of the tourist resort of Rodney Bay, approximately 6 minutes drive from the town of Gros Islet on the scenic Castries-Gros Islet Highway. The stadium is close to the residential enclaves in Beauséjour and Epouge Bay.\nFacilities.\nThe cricket ground is known for its high standard facilities and is regarded by the West Indies Cricket Board as a standard for current and future venues in the Caribbean. Its outfield, a perfect oval, is predictably lush green. It also became the first international ground in the Caribbean to receive floodlighting with the installation of 6 floodlight towers in 2006, enabling the hosting of day/night matches. In May 2006 it hosted the first ever international Day/Night ODI match in the Caribbean when the West Indies took on Zimbabwe. Due to the unfavourable time zone differences between the Caribbean and the large cricket markets in the far east international day/night matches have been few and far between.\nThe facility has 18 hospitality suites, a permanent seating capacity of 13,000 with bucket-type seating which can be increased to 20,000 for international matches. There are also two artificial pitches and two turfs for practice and warm-ups.\nList of centuries.\nTest centuries.\n a total of 18 centuries have been scored in international test cricket on the ground.&lt;ref name=\"Statsguru: Test matches / Batting records / Innings by innings list\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nOne-Day International centuries.\n a total of seven centuries have been scored in one-day international cricket on the ground.&lt;ref name=\"Statsguru: One-Day Internationals / Batting records / Innings by innings list\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nList of five wicket hauls.\nTests.\nTwelve five wicket hauls in Test matches have been taken at the venue.\nOne Day Internationals.\nThree five wicket hauls in One-Day Internationals have been taken at the venue.\nEvents.\n2007 Cricket World Cup matches.\nIt was one of the venues of the 2007 Cricket World Cup, the most important tournament in international cricket, hosting 7 matches, including all 6 Group C matches. New Zealand went the round unbeaten, twice scoring a total beyond 300 runs. The second semi-final between the defending champions Australia and South Africa was played here with an official attendance of 13,875.\n2010 World Twenty20 matches.\nIn 2010, the stadium hosted 10 matches of the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 along with two other stadiums in Caribbean. Four of the matches were Group stage games, four Super 8 matches and both semi-finals of the tournament (one of the semi-finals due to bad weather preventing matches from being held at the Providence Stadium in Guyana).\nThe stadium saw the third international Twenty20 century scored by Indian batsman Suresh Raina in the Group match between India and South Africa.\n2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup matches.\n "

        "title": "Papua New Guinea national cricket team",
        "text": "The Papua New Guinea men's national cricket team, nicknamed the Barramundis, is the team that represents the country of Papua New Guinea in international cricket. The team is organised by Cricket PNG, which has been an associate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) since 1973. Papua New Guinea previously had One-Day International (ODI) status, which it gained by finishing fourth in 2014 World Cup Qualifier. Papua New Guinea lost both their ODI and T20I status in March 2018 after losing a playoff match against Nepal during the 2018 Cricket World Cup Qualifier, a result that earned ODI and T20I status for their opponents. On 26 April 2019, Papua New Guinea defeated Oman to secure a top-four finish in the 2019 ICC World Cricket League Division Two and reclaim their ODI status.\nPapua New Guinea is the strongest team in the ICC East Asia-Pacific region, winning most ICC regional tournaments and having a similar record in the cricket tournament at the Pacific Games. The team has also played in every edition of the World Cup Qualifier (previously the ICC Trophy). Papua New Guinea holds the world record for the highest score in a one-day match, making 572/7 against New Caledonia in 2007.\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its Members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Papua New Guinea and other ICC members since 1 January 2019 have the full T20I status.\nHistory.\nBeginnings.\nCricket was introduced to the Territory of Papua by missionaries in the 1890s, and the local population soon took up the game. Matches were not always played to strict rules, with teams of more than fifty players a common occurrence. Cricket did not arrive in the Territory of New Guinea until Australia took over the administration of the territory under a United Nations mandate.\nCricket in rural areas tended to be played mostly by the indigenous population, whilst in urban areas such as Port Moresby the game was played mostly by the British and Australian expatriate population, and a competition for clubs in the city was started in 1937. A team of nine expatriate and two indigenous players played in Papua New Guinea's first international, against Australia in 1972.\nSince its beginnings cricket was picked up naturally in the Motuan areas of Papua New Guinea, most recognisably the village of Hanuabada. Hanuabada village is located on the outer suburbs of Port Moresby, here cricket is played everyday from small children to their national stars, every afternoon the streets are flooded with boys playing cricket, this was also where the Liklik Kricket Competition was started in PNG. It may be for these reasons more than half of the PNG national cricket team is from Hanuabada village.\nICC Membership.\nPapua New Guinea became an associate member of the ICC in 1973, shortly before the country gained independence in 1975. The West Indies cricket team visited the country that year, beating the national side by four wickets. The team for that match contained six indigenous players, and from this point on, indigenous players began to dominate the national team.\nThey played in the first ICC Trophy in 1979, though they failed to progress beyond the first round. They won the gold medal at the first South Pacific Games cricket tournament later in the year and have won the gold medal every time since. After a tour of Australia in 1981, Papua New Guinea had their best international performance in the 1982 ICC Trophy where they finished third after beating Bangladesh in a play-off.\nPapua New Guinea again failed to progress beyond the first round at the 1986 ICC Trophy, though they did record the highest total in the tournament's history in their match against Gibraltar. They bounced back to win the gold medal at the South Pacific Games in New Caledonia the following year. They reached the second round of the 1990 ICC Trophy in the Netherlands and the gold medal when they hosted the South Pacific Games in 1991.\nThey reached the plate final of the 1994 ICC Trophy, but did not play the match as they had already booked a flight home, not expecting to qualify. This has been an occasional problem for Papua New Guinea, as flights to and from the country are infrequent. They also left the 1998 ACC Trophy in Nepal early after losing their first two games, forfeiting their match against the Maldives as otherwise they would have had to have waited more than a week for the next flight. This has also meant they have rarely played overseas outside of official tournaments, the only exceptions being a visit to Fiji in 1977, a tour of Hong Kong in the early 1980s and the aforementioned tour of Australia.\nModern era.\nAnother international outlet for Papua New Guinea team opened up in 1996 when they participated in the first ACC Trophy in Kuala Lumpur. They reached the semi-final, where they lost to Bangladesh. They played in the tournament again in 1998, but left the tournament early. They have not played in the tournament since due to the establishment of the ICC's East Asia/Pacific development region. Between the two ACC Trophy tournaments, Papua New Guinea finished 13th in the 1997 ICC Trophy. They failed to progress beyond the first round of the 2001 tournament in Ontario. They finished third in the 2001 Pacifica Cup and won the same event in 2002, beating Tonga in the final.\nThey again won the gold medal at cricket tournament of the 2003 South Pacific Games, and in 2005 played in the repêchage tournament of the 2005 ICC Trophy. They won the tournament, beating regional rivals Fiji in the final. This qualified them for the 2005 ICC Trophy, where they finished 11th. In 2007, Papua New Guinea played in Division Three of the World Cricket League in Darwin where they finished third. They played in the cricket tournament of the 2007 South Pacific Games, where they again won the gold medal.\nIn late January 2009, Papua New Guinea travelled to Buenos Aires to take part in Division Three of the World Cricket League where they played Argentina, the Cayman Islands, Uganda and the top two teams from Division Four in 2008. A top-two finish in this tournament would have qualified them for the 2009 ICC World Cup Qualifier in South Africa later in 2009, from which they could have qualified for the 2011 World Cup. Papua New Guinea narrowly missed qualification, ending up in third place behind Afghanistan and Uganda.\nIt was third time lucky for Papua New Guinea when they contested Division Three of the World Cricket League in January 2011. Winning their first 4 matches of the tournament, they had assured themselves a top-two finish, before losing the final round robin match and then the final, both against Hong Kong.\nIn April 2011, Papua New Guinea took part in Division Two of the World Cricket League, held in the United Arab Emirates and came third, thus qualifying for the 2014 Cricket World Cup Qualifier in New Zealand.\nIn February 2013, Papua New Guinea travelled to Auckland, New Zealand, for the EAP Championship and went through the group stages unbeaten before defeating Vanuatu in the final. As a result, they participated in the 2013 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier in the UAE in October.\nODI and T20I status.\nPapua New Guinea finished 4th in the final qualifying tournament for the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup, in New Zealand in 2014. While missing out on qualification for the World Cup, their final position allowed them to gain One Day International (ODI) status for the first time. By having ODI status, the International Cricket Council (ICC) also granted Papua New Guinea Twenty20 International (T20I) status.\nThe team played their first ODI match in a two-match series against Hong Kong in Australia in November 2014.\nThey won the first by 4 wickets, the second by 3 wickets. As on date (November-2016), they are the only country that has won its first two ODIs.\nPapua New Guinea's first scheduled T20I match was against Hong Kong on 13 July 2015 at the 2015 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier. However the match was abandoned without a ball bowled due to rain, with no toss taking place. They played their first full match two days later, against Ireland, beating them by 2 wickets. With their victory against Nepal on 17 July, they became the first team to qualify for the play-off section of the tournament.\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Papua New Guinea and other ICC members since 1 January 2019 have the full T20I status.\nPapua New Guinea crashed out early from the race of qualification for the 2016 ICC World Twenty20 slated to be held in India. They finished eighth during the ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier in Ireland and Scotland.\nIn September 2017, then team coach Jason Gillespie suggested that Papua New Guinea should be added to the Australian domestic limited-overs cricket tournament.\nPapua New Guinea qualified for 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup to be held in India.\nOn the 30th of March 2021, it was announced that Carl Sandri was to be the new national coach and high performance manager for all three national squads and will oversee the high performance department and the development of talent in PNG. \nPapua New Guinea Cricket Board.\nPapua New Guinea Cricket Board is the official governing body of the sport of cricket in Papua New Guinea. Its current headquarters is in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea.

        "title": "Gary Collins (American football)",
        "text": "Gary James Collins (born August 20, 1940) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver and punter for the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League (NFL) from 1962 to 1971.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Williamstown, Pennsylvania, Collins attended Williamstown High School and was recruited by the University of Maryland. During his three seasons (1959–61) with the Terrapins, he established a number of school records, and left his mark on the Atlantic Coast Conference record book as well. In 1961, he finished eighth in the Heisman Trophy balloting.\nNFL career.\nThe Browns chose Collins with the fourth draft pick in the 1962 NFL draft and immediately made him the starting punter, while also using him as a reserve for veteran receiver Ray Renfro. In 1963, he moved into the starting lineup and led the team with 43 receptions and teamed with quarterback Frank Ryan to pace the league with 13 touchdowns catches. The latter mark broke a team record of nine, established by Dante Lavelli in 1947.\nThe following year, rookie Paul Warfield became Ryan's top receiver, but Collins developed a knack for coming through in the clutch. The first instance came in the season's second game, when he caught a fourth-down pass from Ryan to set up a go-ahead touchdown against the St. Louis Cardinals. Saving the best for last, Collins sparkled in the 1964 NFL championship game, when he was on the receiving end of three touchdown passes from Ryan and won the game's Most Valuable Player award in the 27–0 upset over the Baltimore Colts.\nBuilding on the spectacular ending to that season, Collins followed with two more excellent campaigns in which he caught more than 50 passes and again finished in double digits in touchdown receptions. In 1965, he led the Browns with 50 receptions for 884 yards, and his average of 46.7 yards per punt topped the NFL. His 56 catches for 946 yards again led the team in 1966.\nIn 1967, Collins saw his numbers for both receiving and punting drop, but he made his second straight Pro Bowl appearance. The following year, Collins gave up his punting duties, but suffered a severe shoulder injury in the October 5 game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. The injury kept him out of action until the final week of the regular season and limited him to just nine receptions. While he made the most of those catches by averaging over 25 yards per grab, Collins caught no touchdown passes for the only time in his career.\nCollins bounced back in 1969 with 54 catches and 11 touchdown receptions and helped the Browns reach the NFL Championship game for the fourth time in six seasons. In 1970, the punishing life of an NFL receiver began to catch up with him as he suffered from a number of rib injuries that limited him to 26 catches. In the team's December 12 game against the Dallas Cowboys, played in a driving rainstorm which turned the Cleveland Stadium surface into mud, a costly fumble by Collins after being hit in the ribs stopped a key drive and played a role in the team's 6–2 loss, a defeat that helped keep the team out of the postseason.\nThe ascension of new head coach Nick Skorich in 1971 would eventually develop into a personality conflict between Collins and the new mentor. After just 15 receptions that year, Collins announced during the offseason that he would retire unless he was traded to either the Washington Redskins or New York Jets.\nPost-NFL career.\nWhen neither team was able to work out a deal, Collins retired and took an assistant coaching position with Lebanon Valley College in Annville, Pennsylvania. He signed as a player-coach with the WFL's Florida Blazers in 1974, but sustained a broken collarbone in preseason and saw only limited action later in the season, recording 3 catches. After then leaving football altogether, he worked as an insurance agent in Hershey, Pennsylvania, and did some broadcasting. Married in 1980, Collins has two children and six grandchildren.\nLegacy.\nCollins retired with 339 receptions for 5,299 yards and 70 touchdowns. Collins was the sixth receiver to have 70 touchdowns in NFL history, behind Don Hutson, Don Maynard, Tommy McDonald, Lance Alworth, and Art Powell. Four of those five above Collins are in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He did so while being 39th all-time in receiving yards and 31st in receptions. He remains the Browns' leader in career receiving touchdowns, and his reception total ranks second behind that of Ozzie Newsome. As a punter, he averaged 41.0 yards per attempt. He had 336 punts, 25th best upon retirement.\nThose numbers have led some of Collins' supporters to launch a quiet campaign for election to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, citing the similarities between Collins' career numbers and those of Pittsburgh Steelers wideout Lynn Swann, as each had over 330 receptions with a yards per reception average of just over 16.0 yards.\nGary Collins is a member of The Pigskin Club Of Washington, D.C. National Collegiate All-American Football Players Honor Roll.\nIn 2016, the Professional Football Researchers Association named Collins to the PRFA Hall of Very Good Class of 2016."

        "text": "Volleyball England is the national governing body for indoor volleyball, sitting volleyball and beach volleyball in England. It selects the national teams and coordinates several national competitions, including the National Volleyball League, National Cup, Student Cup and Sitting Volleyball competitions. For beach volleyball it partners with the UK Beach Tour (UKBT) to deliver tournaments across the UK and a national ranking system for players. Volleyball England also coordinates national junior development squads via the Volleyball England Talent Pathway, and organises the training and assessment of referees and coaches. It is a member body of the FIVB and has its offices at SportPark, Loughborough University, Loughborough, Leicestershire. Volleyball England works closely with, and is supported by, the Volleyball England Foundation, which is a charity providing financial support to volleyball development projects. It also partners with the governing bodies for volleyball from the other UK Home Nations to form the British Volleyball Federation.\nVolleyball England is the trading name for the English Volleyball Association Limited, which was formed in 1972.\nNational Volleyball Centre.\nWith £3.5million of funding from both the UK Government and the UK National Lottery in the run-up to London 2012, in 2007 Volleyball England signed an agreement to accommodate the National Volleyball Centre within the Kettering Conference Centre. Made possible with a grant from Kettering Borough Council, Northamptonshire Enterprise Ltd, and the East Midlands Development Agency, the four-year agreement came into place on the opening of the centre in November 2010.\nThe facility houses both National Volleyball Centre, as well as home of Volleyball England's national men's and women's volleyball squads, and several national competitions.\nNational Volleyball League.\nNVL organisation.\nThe National Volleyball League (NVL) is an indoor volleyball league, split into men's and women's competitions, each with 4 levels. In season 2018–19, the top three levels are the same for men and women: National Super League, Division 1 and Division 2 (North &amp; South). Men's Division 3 is divided into North, Central and South. Women's Division 3 is divided into North, Central, South-East and South-West.\nThe latest information on National Volleyball League participants and ranking can be found in the National Volleyball League Tables on the Volleyball England website The information below is a snapshot showing the numbers of teams in each division for the 2018–19 season, though this varies from year to year:\nNVL History.\nIn the past, men's volleyball in England has been dominated by London Malory, led by Canadian coach Jefferson Williams. In recent years, IBB Polonia London have been the most successful team winning 3 of the last 4 editions.\nWomen's volleyball in England has also been dominated by London Malory in the past, again led by Jefferson Williams. However, in 2008, the University of London Union (ULU) women's team defeated London Malory in the Cup quarter-finals and left them out of the Final for the first time in 13 years. The student side, which competes in the London Premier League and is led by coach Mark Kontopoulos, then defeated Wessex-Team Bath in the semi-finals and London Polonia in the Final to become the first ever non-national league team to win the National Cup. In recent years, women's volleyball has been dominated by northern sides with Team Northumbria winning the title five times in a row from 2012 to 2016, followed by Team Durham's two consecutive titles in 2017 and 2018. In 2019, Tendring VC Ladies won their first National league championship to bring the trophy to Essex."

        "text": "The Sharjah Cricket Stadium () is in Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates. It holds the record for being the venue that hosted the highest number of international matches, 294 matches, up to March 17 2024. It was originally constructed in the early 1980s and has been much improved over the years. The stadium hosted its first international matches in April 1984, in the Asia Cup. \nIt was at this stadium in 1998 that indian batsman Sachin Tendulkar single handedly took the India team with 143 runs, winning an international game against the Australia. \nIn 2010, at the behest of local cricketing patron Abdul Rahman Bukhatir, the Sharjah Cricket Stadium became the home ground for the Afghanistan cricket team for One Day International and first-class matches. In 2016, Afghanistan changed their home ground to Greater Noida Sports Complex Ground in Noida, India. The Multan Sultans and the Quetta Gladiators used the Sharjah Cricket Stadium for most of their home games in the most recent PSL season.\nThe cricket stadium also hosted the inaugural edition of the T10 cricket league, which is a 90-minute cricket league from 14 to 17 December 2017 featuring several international cricket players.\nThe stadium also hosted the final of the 2018 Blind Cricket World Cup. \nThe Sharjah stadium was one of the dedicated venues for the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup.\nIt has 62 metre boundaries in long on and 58 metre in straight. It has 65 metre boundary in mid wicket.\nTest matches.\nSharjah cricket stadium is one of the few Test Cricket Grounds at which a Test match has been played not involving a home country participant (and the only one in a non-Test playing country) Sharjah was the venue for four Test matches in 2002. Because of security and safety concerns in Pakistan and its aftermath) the ground was chosen as a neutral venue to host two Test matches between Pakistan and the West Indies in February and two Test matches between Pakistan and Australia in October.\nThe fifth Test match held at the ground took place in November 2011, as the third Test between Sri Lanka and Pakistan. The other games in the series were played at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium, Abu Dhabi and Dubai International Cricket Stadium.\nOne Day Internationals.\nBetween 1984 and 2003, the Sharjah ground was the venue for 206 One Day Internationals held as part of commercially sponsored one day tournaments involving three or four international teams. Sharjah was a popular venue attracting good crowds mostly from the South Asian population of the United Arab Emirates. The tournaments were organised by \"The Cricketers Benefit Fund Series (CBFS)\" which had been established in 1981 by Abdul Rahman Bukhatir, and whose main aim was to honour cricketers of the past and present generations from India and Pakistan, with benefit purses in recognition of their services to the game of cricket. The stadium initially started with a few limited seats and very modest facilities but by 2002 had a 17,000 capacity and floodlights.\nSince 2003 the increasingly crowded cricket calendar has precluded the holding of any major international matches at Sharjah although the stadium has been the venue for certain other matches, for example in the 2004 ICC Intercontinental Cup. It has also been used by the Afghanistan national team since 2010. In 2011, the Guinness Book of Records recorded the Sharjah stadium as hosting the greatest number of one-day matches. , 240 ODIs had been played at the ground.\nICC Men's T20 World Cup.\nThe venue hosted 11 group-stage matches during 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup.\nIndian Premier League.\nThe UAE has hosted matches in the Indian Premier League, with matches being played on the ground on each occasion. The 2014 season was played in the UAE due to the 2014 Indian general election and parts of both the 2020 and 2021 season were played in the country due to the widespread outbreak of COVID-19 in India.\nThe Sachin Tendulkar Stand.\nIn April 2023, On Sachin Tendulkar's 50th birthday, the West Stand at the iconic Sharjah Cricket Stadium has been renamed the 'Sachin Tendulkar Stand in a special ceremony in the UAE, honouring the Indian cricket legend."

        "title": "NCAA basketball tournament selection process",
        "text": "The selection process for college basketball's NCAA Division I Men's and Women's Basketball Tournaments determine which teams (68 men's and 68 women's) will enter the tournaments (the centerpieces of the basketball championship frenzy known as \"March Madness\") and their seedings and matchups in the knockout bracket. Currently, thirty-two (32) teams gain automatic entry through winning their conference's championship. The remaining teams (36 men's, 36 women's) rely on the selection committee to award them an at-large bid in the tournament. The selection process primarily takes place on Selection Sunday and the days leading up to it. Selection Sunday is also when the men's brackets and seeds are released to the public. Beginning in 2022, the women's championship brackets and seeds are also announced on Sunday. Prior to the expansion of the bracket from 64 to 68 teams the women's championship brackets and seeds were announced one day later, on Selection Monday.\nThe selection committees.\nThe twelve-member basketball selection committee is made up of athletic directors and conference commissioners throughout Division I men's and women's athletics with separate committees for the men's and women's tournaments. The committees consist of one member selected from each of the five autonomy conferences and three members selected from the seven highest-ranked nonautonomy conferences based on basketball success. The remaining four members are selected from the 20 other conferences. All appointments are for five years. Historically the men's selection committee consisted of all men, and the women's selection committee consisted of all women. However, recently women have been serving on the men’s committee (including Judy Rose, Lynn Hickey, Janet Cone, and current member Bernadette McGlade), and men have been serving on the women’s committee (including Richard Ensor and current member Jeff Konya). The tournament selection is only part of the committee members' duties; the panels meet year-round (in-person or through conference calls) to discuss the tournament and its administration, evaluate teams, assign tournament game officials, and determine future tournament sites.\nTo avoid potential conflicts of interest, committee members must leave the room when their own school is being discussed (or schools in the case of the conference commissioners). The member may be invited to answer factual questions regarding his or her team or teams (e.g., status of player injuries). Athletic directors may be present when other schools from their conference are discussed, but may only speak if asked.\nCurrent men's committee members.\n₳current chairman&lt;br&gt;\n฿current vice-chairman&lt;br&gt;\nCurrent women's committee members.\n₳current chairman&lt;br&gt;\n฿current vice-chairman&lt;br&gt;\nSelecting the field.\nThe selection committee must first decide which teams will compete in the tournament. As of the 2016–17 season, thirty-two teams receive automatic bids to the tournament by winning their conference tournament.\nThe selection committee only selects the teams (36 for men and women) who receive at-large bids. Though each conference receives only one automatic bid, the selection committee may select any number of at-large teams from each conference. The at-large teams generally come from college basketball's top conferences, including the ACC, Big 12, Big East, Big Ten, Pac-12, SEC and to a lesser extent, the American, A-10, Mountain West and WCC. Many of these at-large teams, however, are \"on the bubble\", meaning that their chances of gaining a tournament berth are borderline, and they will not know if they have gained entry until the Selection Sunday bracket announcements.\nThrough the 2018 men's tournament and 2019 women's tournament, the RPI rating was often considered a factor in selecting and seeding the final few teams in the tournament field. However, the NCAA selection committee in 2015 said the RPI was only utilized for grouping the teams into groups such as top 50 and top 100 teams, to value the wins and losses, and not as a factor for selection. Additionally, the committee officially considers predictive computer rankings, such as ESPN's BPI, Sagarin, and Pomeroy Ratings, which use additional factors considered by the committee, such as injured players in the case of the BPI. Additionally, committee members consider how teams do on the road and at neutral courts, strength of conference and schedule, non-conference strength of schedule, record against other selected tournament teams, and other extenuating factors. Finally, the \"eye test\" is often quoted by pundits as something the committee uses, however ncaa.org's sparse description of the selection process doesn't officially mention the \"eye test\". For instance, in 2016 Oklahoma athletic director Joe Castiglione, the NCAA selection committee's chair, said that the stark contrast in Syracuse's performance in 2015-2016 with Jim Boeheim present versus absent was considered the same as missing a key player during the slump.\nA number of teams are assured an at-large berth no matter their performance in their conference tournament. Most teams in the Top 25 in the national polls or RPI are essentially guaranteed at-large berths even if they do not win their respective conference tournaments. However, teams that have been ranked heading into Selection Sunday but didn't win a weaker conference's tournament have been essentially penalized (or \"snubbed\") by the selection committee despite computer rankings or public opinion. One example was Utah State in 2004, when Utah State completed the regular season with a record of 25-2 but was snubbed after losing in their conference tournament, even though they were ranked in the polls. The factors in their snub were the soft non-conference schedule which included Mountain West Conference foes BYU (close home win) and Utah (road loss) as well as the road loss to Pacific on February 14, 2004. Pacific went on to earn the Big West Conference's automatic berth and advanced to the 2nd round of the 2004 tournament.\nThe committee also selects four additional teams, the \"First Four Out,\" who do not qualify for the tournament. Since 2015, the NCAA has placed the \"First Four Out\" from the men's field as the top seeds in the National Invitation Tournament. The NCAA carried this policy over same policy to the inaugural Women's Basketball Invitation Tournament in 2024.\nDuring the 2018 offseason, the NCAA announced that the RPI would no longer be used in the selection process for the Division I men's tournament. The RPI has been replaced by the NCAA Evaluation Tool (NET), a new metric that includes the following input data:\nThe NET was initially adopted only for men's basketball. Starting with the 2020–21 season, the NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament also began using the NET. The women's NET uses input data exclusively from the women's game, but will otherwise operate identically to the men's version. All other sports that use selection committees to determine NCAA tournament entries, continue to use their own versions of the RPI, as the Division I women's basketball tournament had done prior to 2020-2021.\nPredictions and speculation.\nWhile the selection committee assembles to do the official work, many predictions are made by various people and organizations. Speculations and buzz can come from anywhere from random college basketball fans to senior bracketologists and experts on the selection process and the seedings, such as ESPN's Joe Lunardi. Other well-known experts in this field include Ken Pomeroy of kenpom.com, Jerry Palm of CBSSports.com, Gary Parrish of CBSSports.com, and Dean Oliver of ESPN's BPI. The ESPN's BPI also considers injured key players, which is also considered by the NCAA selection committee.\nBracketology is conducted extensively for the men's tournament, although a few bracketologists also make projected brackets for the women's tournament, the most prominent being Charlie Creme's weekly projections on ESPN.com.\nSeeding.\nThe selection committee's work to seed the teams is just as vital as their work to select the at-large teams. While the selection process starts before the seeding process, the two often overlap. Some conference tournaments do not finish until Selection Sunday itself, and there is only one hour between the end of the last game (usually the Big Ten tournament championship game) and when the brackets are officially unveiled, so the committee cannot wait until after all the games are played to start determining the seeds. While nothing is set in stone until after all the games are played and the brackets are established, the committee may have a good idea of where a team is and where they could rise or fall to depending on their showing in the later stages of their conference tournament.\nThough the brackets only feature the seed numbers 1-16 in each region, the committee first assembles a overall seed ranking of selected team from 1 through 68, formatted as an \"S-curve\". The selection committee uses a number of factors to rank teams for the S-curve, including record, strength of schedule, and the NET in the Division I men's tournament and the RPI in all other championship tournaments. Relative subjective comparison of individual teams close on the S-Curve are also considered. \nThe \"S-curve\" table in the guidelines displays four teams to a row, alternating left-to-right and right-to left. In theory, the teams 1-4 on the seed list will all be #1 seeds in their regions (the #1 \"seed line\"), 5-8 will be #2 seeds in their regions (the #2 seed line), and so on; however, bracketing rules allow minor deviation from this when necessary to meet other bracketing requirements. (Also, the teams in the \"first four\" teams that share a seed number place lower table rows out of sync with seed numbering.)\nThe S-curve rankings are most important for keeping each region balanced, the ideal being that each region will be equally strong. Theoretically the committee would try to ensure that the number 1 team on the seed list, the national #1 seed, will be in the same region as the weakest #2 seed (and they are not permitted to put them with the strongest #2 seed, #5 overall).\nThe committee tries to ensure that the top four seeds in each region are comparable to the top four teams in every other region. For example, if one region has the best #1 seed (#1 overall), the weakest #2 seed (#8 overall), the best #3 seed (#9 overall), and the weakest #4 seed (#16 overall), its seeds add up to 34, the ideal number. But if a region has the best team for every given seed, its seeds would add up to 28, and a region with the weakest team in every seed would add up to 40, making the two regions very unbalanced. Guidelines intend for these totals to vary by five or less.\nThis balance extends to the national semi-finals, where the regions containing the national #1 and #4 seeds meet in one game and regions containing the national #2 and #3 seeds are in the other game.\nIt is extremely unusual that an at-large bid can be lower than a #12 seed, but it has occurred, most recently with BYU and Iona being #14 seeds in the 2012 Tournament, and Boise State and La Salle as #13 seeds in 2013. While the seeds are almost never perfectly balanced throughout the four regions, the committee strives to ensure that they differ from each other by only a few points. The process is identical for the women's tournament.\nMaking the brackets.\nOnce the S-curve is established, the committee must place the teams throughout the four regions. They were originally referred to as East, Mideast, Midwest, and West. In 1985, the Mideast designation became the Southeast, and later the South Regional in 1998. The women's tournament continued to use the Mideast terminology through 2004. In 2004, the NCAA started to identify the men's regions only by the city in which the regional semifinals and finals were played, with the same change being made for the women's tournament in 2005. The NCAA reverted to the East/South/Midwest/West designations for the men's tournament starting in 2007, but continues to designate women's regionals by their cities. \nTypically the cities selected will be spread throughout the country and conform roughly to the old geographic distinctions. While the regions are named for certain cities, the first and second round games are played in different cities which need not be anywhere near the regional finals. In 2005 the Austin, Texas men's regional was fed by games in Indianapolis, Indiana; Tucson, Arizona; Charlotte, North Carolina; and Worcester, Massachusetts. This is due to the \"pod\" system enacted before the 2002 tournament to minimize travel for as many teams as possible, especially in the early rounds. Any team may be sent to any region and any pod, although the tournament does try to keep teams, especially the top-seeded teams, closer to home. However, in 2004, Pittsburgh played its first two tournament games in Milwaukee and not in Buffalo or Columbus, cities to which it was closer. This was done to keep a lower-seeded team, the Wisconsin Badgers, close to its campus. Similarly, two east-coast teams, Maryland and Syracuse, traveled to Denver, where their opening round opponents were BYU and UTEP, both of which were geographically closer to Denver. In addition, in 2009, Kansas and West Virginia, the two higher seeds, traveled to Minneapolis to play their opponents North Dakota State and Dayton, although Dayton and North Dakota State are geographically closer to Minneapolis than Kansas and West Virginia. To make matters worse for both latter teams, Kansas City (Kansas) and Greensboro NC (West Virginia) were both 1st-2nd round sites that year.\nA number of complex rules govern the seeding process, so it is not as simple as merely following the S-curve, although that is the top priority according to the NCAA's rules. Better teams have priority in remaining close to home, but no hosting institution's team can actually play at the location where the institution is hosting tournament games (generally, games are hosted on neutral courts, so this is not usually a problem). Sometimes a top team may be a short drive away from its games; in 2006 Villanova played its first and second round games in Philadelphia at an arena where they had played three games that year, one fewer than the four required for a site to be considered a \"home court\" for a team, and in 2002 the Pitt Panthers played their first and second round games in the city of Pittsburgh at Mellon Arena (which was not their home court after the opening of their on-campus arena). \nIn the women's tournament, this criterion does not apply, and a team that is hosting is automatically assigned its home arena, regardless of seed. Thus, occasionally, lower seeded teams will host games. For example, in 2006 Old Dominion, although a 10th seed, played at its home court in the first round and also would have played there in the second round had the Lady Monarchs won that game. At present, the top 16 seeds (top 4 in each region) host the first and second rounds on campus, although there have been situations where scheduling conflicts result in a lower seed hosting.\nOne major controversy during the 2014 that erupted was #1 seed South Carolina being forced to make two cross-country trips for the tournament, with many charging the Gamecocks were punished as a result of a home game ban by being forced to travel to Seattle for the first two rounds in a regional Washington was hosting, and Palo Alto where they were eliminated in the Sweet 16 in the Stanford regional. The following year, the NCAA allowed South Carolina to host its first two games, determining that since sites for the opening two rounds were (at least theoretically) determined on merit, those games were not covered by the NCAA's ban on holding its own championship events in that state (which has since been lifted after the Confederate battle flag was removed from the state capitol grounds).\nTeams are spread out according to conference. The first three teams within the top 4 seeded lines selected from each conference must be placed in different regions (with a slight exception in 2014, when 11th seed play-in team Tennessee was placed in the Midwest Region with conference foe 8th seed Kentucky). When a conference has more than three teams in the tournament, the committee tries to seed the teams so that they cannot meet until the regional final. Before 2006, this was an absolute rule. However, in the summer of 2005, the NCAA changed its rules to allow intraconference matchups as early as the second round of the tournament, assuming that all measures to keep the teams apart until the regional finals have been exhausted. The NCAA was preparing for the chance that a conference would place more than eight teams in the tournament, which became a realistic possibility when the Big East, already a power conference, expanded to 16 members, with several of the new members having traditionally strong programs. The Big East placed a record eleven teams in the 2011 Tournament and nine teams in the 2012 Tournament. Although the Big East split into two leagues in 2013, the issue of conferences placing more than eight teams in the tournament remained, due to several other leagues expanding in the early 2010s (notably the ACC to 15, and the Big Ten and SEC to 14 each).\nThe committee may move a team up or down one seed from its seed line in the S-curve in order to preserve other principles. While this may be seen as unfair in some instances, the seeding process is an inexact science anyway, and a slight move in seeding is unlikely to significantly affect the chances of any team.\nThe committee also takes into consideration other non-basketball factors. In 2003 the tournament mistakenly placed BYU, a Latter-Day Saint school which has a policy of not playing games on Sunday, into a region where the team could be forced to play on a Sunday if they advanced to regional play. The NCAA then announced that they would switch BYU's region if they won their first two games and reached the regional semifinals; since BYU did not go that far, however, no action was taken. \nFor 2011, the region names were slightly adjusted based on the locations of the regionals. The Midwest and South regions were replaced with the Southeast and Southwest regions, held in New Orleans and San Antonio respectively (sites that were determined when the NCAA was using city names as regional names). The regions reverted to the previous ones in 2012.\nSelection Sunday.\nSelection Sunday is the day when participants are selected, seeded, placed accordingly, and announced. Both CBS and ESPN cover the selections for the men's tournament live; ESPN also covers selections for the women's tournament live. The NCAA committee gathers to select and place 68 men's teams and 68 women's teams that secured automatic berths or are deemed worthy of an invitation to the NCAA Division I men's and women's basketball tournaments that take place in March and April. Selection Sunday is currently the Sunday before the third Thursday of March, when the first round games begin. It is never before March 11, or after March 17. \nCBS has the official rights to cover the selection of the men's tournament field as they are the TV network which covers the vast majority of the tournament. (CBS held exclusive TV rights to the men's tournament from 1991 to 2010, and have shared rights with Turner Sports since 2011.) For this reason, CBS announces each bracket first, with ESPN passing on the brackets to its viewers seconds later. Both networks' coverage is augmented by discussion of the selections and predictions about how teams will fare once the tournament begins. ESPN has exclusive rights to cover the women's tournament selection announcements, as that network has sole rights to the women's tournament. Before 2006, the women's matchups were made in a selection show airing one hour before the men's matchups. However, from 2006-2021, the women's matchups had been announced by ESPN on Selection Monday. Beginning in 2022, owing to the addition of the First Four into the women's tournament, selections for the women are now announced Sunday evening after the men's announcement. Currently the men's announcement is scheduled for 6:00 PM ET with the women's announcement scheduled for 8:00 PM.\nBoth CBS and ESPN send camera crews to schools around the nation to capture the teams' (and occasionally fans') reactions during the moment when they find out what seed they received or if they made the tournament at all. Once the teams are announced, the teams and their fans begin to make game plan and travel preparations. Additionally, millions of college basketball fans begin to fill in their brackets, usually as part of March Madness pools conducted through websites, gambling-related contests, or simply through a group of family members, friends, or co-workers.\nTurner Sports (through TBS) aired the Selection Show in 2018 in their first year of holding the rights to the Final Four and National Championship. Negative reaction to the network move and format changes imposed by Turner resulted in the show reverting back to CBS and its previous format the following year."

        "title": "Australia at the 2006 Winter Olympics",
        "text": "Australia competed at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. The team of 40 athletes was the largest ever for Australia, surpassing the team of 31 that participated at the 1960 Winter Olympics.\nPrior to the Olympics, Australia had set a goal of winning one medal. They were able to win two medals – one gold and one bronze – and had several other top 10 finishes.\nAlisa Camplin served as flag bearer at the opening ceremonies.\nAlpine skiing.\nFive Australian skiers competed in Turin, but only one, Craig Branch, finished a run. Branch was the first starter for the men's downhill, and his 32nd place was the highest finish for an Australian alpine skier since Calgary '88.\nNote: In the men's combined, runs 1 is the downhill, and runs 2 and 3 are the slalom. In the women's combined, run 1 and 2 are the slalom, and run 3 the downhill.\nBiathlon.\nCameron Morton, a primary school principal, and the only Australian biathlete in Turin, was aiming for a top-fifty finish, but failed to make the top 80 in either of his two events. He was the fifth Australian to compete in an Olympic biathlon.\nBobsleigh.\nThe men's pair of Rolleston and McKenzie equalled the best Australian finish in the event by placing 22nd, while Loch-Wilkinson and Reed were the first to represent the country in women's bobsleigh. Australia also attempted to enter a four-man team in Turin, appealing to the IOC and the CAS after it was revealed a Brazilian athlete had tested positive for nandrolone in a pre-Olympic test. The athlete in question had competed in a qualifying race won by Brazil, with New Zealand second and Australia third, with the top two teams advancing. The disqualification of the Brazilian entry from that race could have allowed Australia to compete, but the IOC, FIBT and CAS rejected the appeal.\nCross-country skiing.\nAustralia sent 3 skiers to compete in the cross country events, its largest contingent at a Winter Olympics.\nFigure skating.\nJoanne Carter, who had placed 12th at the 1998 Olympics, finished 25th in the women's short program, failing to advance to the free skate.\nKey: CD = Compulsory Dance, FD = Free Dance, FS = Free Skate, OD = Original Dance, SP = Short Program\nFreestyle skiing.\nCanadian-born Dale Begg-Smith entered the Games as the top ranked man in moguls, and won Australia's only gold medal in Turin. 2002 Winter Olympics gold medallist Alisa Camplin also won a medal, bronze in the women's aerials. This made her the first Australian athlete to win back-to-back medals in a winter sport. Camplin won a medal despite having major surgery on her knee four months before the Turin games. Jacqui Cooper set a world record in qualifying for the women's aerials, but ended up 8th in the final.\nLuge.\nHannah Campbell-Pegg was the lone lugist representing Australia in Turin. She finished 23rd overall.\nShort track speed skating.\nFour years after Stephen Bradbury won a gold medal in short track, Australia's first, no Australian skater managed to advance to an A final. The best performance came from the men's relay, which won the B final to finish sixth.\nSkeleton.\nMichelle Steele, who was recruited to participate in the skeleton just 14 months before the Games, finished 13th in the women's event. Steele was part of a program created by the Australian Institute of Sport to develop Australian winter athletes by converting athletes from summer sports.\nSnowboarding.\nNine snowboarders represented Australia across each of the three disciplines, but only one, Torah Bright qualified for a medal final. Bright was touted as a medal threat, and though she failed to qualify in the first round, she finished 1st in the second to make the final. She struggled in her first run of the final, ending up 10th, but improved to 5th after the second run.\nNote: In the final, the single best score from two runs is used to determine the ranking. A bracketed score indicates the run in the final that wasn't counted.\nKey: '+ Time' represents a deficit; the brackets indicate the results of each run."

        "text": "The 100 metres hurdles at the 2005 World Championships in Athletics was held at the Helsinki Olympic Stadium on August 9, 10 and 11.\nThe top four runners in each of the initial 5 heats automatically qualified for the semifinals. The next four fastest runners from across the heats also qualified. There were three semifinal heats, and only the top two from each heat plus the next two fastest runners advanced to the final.\nSummary.\nOlympic champion Joanna Hayes was out the fastest, gaining about a foot over the first barrier. That advantage didn't last long as there were six women dead even over the second. By the third hurdle Michelle Perry had emerged with a fractional lead. By the fourth, Delloreen Ennis-London began to separate by inches from the wall as Mariya Koroteyeva and Kirsten Bolm began to lose ground. Ennis-London was much faster to the sixth hurdle, capturing a slight lead. Running virtually stride for stride, immediately to Ennis-London's left, Hayes also pulled even with Perry, with Brigitte Foster-Hylton just inches behind the three. But Ennis-London lost her quick snap over the hurdles, instead gliding, relinquishing her hold on the lead while Hayes again was matching Perry stride for stride until Hayes hooked the ninth hurdle. She lost her balance between hurdles so much she never jumped the tenth hurdle, instead carrying it some seven metres down the track before pushing it away and striding over the finish line in last. With her last challenger suddenly out of the race, Perry ran in to the finish with a 1-metre lead over Ennis-London, who was less than a half metre ahead of her teammate Foster-Hylton across the line for silver.\nResults.\nAll times shown are in seconds.&lt;br&gt;\nQ denotes qualification by place.&lt;br&gt;\nq denotes qualification by time.&lt;br&gt;\nDNS denotes did not start.&lt;br&gt;\nDNF denotes did not finish.&lt;br&gt;\nAR denotes area record&lt;br&gt;\nNR denotes national record.&lt;br&gt;\nPB denotes personal best.&lt;br&gt;\nSB denotes season's best.\nRound 1.\nAugust 9\nSemifinals.\nAugust 10\nFinal.\nAugust 11\nOlympic champion and favorite Joanna Hayes stumbled in the hurdles."

        "title": "Australia at the 1952 Winter Olympics",
        "text": "Australia sent a delegation to compete at the 1952 Winter Olympics from 14 to 25 February 1952 in Oslo, Norway. This was the nation's second appearance at the Winter Olympic Games with their first being in 1936.\nThe Australian delegation consisted of nine competitors in four sports. This included the nation's debut in alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, and figure skating, and their second appearance in speed skating. Australia's best result from the 1952 Games was a tenth-place finish in men's singles figure skating. Nancy Hallam and Gweneth Molony became Australia's first women athletes at the Winter Olympics as they competed in the ladies' singles figure skating; they finished 14th and 21st respectively.\nBackground.\nThe Australian Olympic Committee was formed on 1 January 1895 with the nation making their debut at the first Olympics in Athens; Teddy Flack was the first representative of the country. 1952 was Australia's second appearance at a Winter Olympics and the first since 1936. It was also the 13th overall Olympics that Australia had sent a delegation in. The 1952 Winter Olympics was held at Oslo in Norway and took place from 14 to 25 February; a total of 694 athletes competed from 30 nations. The Australian delegation consisted of nine athletes, three in figure skating and alpine skiing, two in cross-country skiing and one in speed skating.\nAlpine skiing.\nAustralia entered three skiers in the alpine skiing events, with Bob Arnott and Barry Patten competing in their only Olympics, and Bill Day competing in his first of three Olympics. The first event for the trio was the men's giant slalom which was making its debut at the Games. Bill Day finished the best of the Australians as he placed 67th, forty-five seconds behind gold medalist Stein Eriksen from Norway. Arnott and Patten finished 78th and 80th out of the eighty-two that finished the course. The following day, the three Australians competed in the men's downhill, which was held at the same venue as the giant slalom. Bill Day was the leading Australian out of the three entries as he finished 60th, a full minute off the pace from Zeno Colò from Italy who won the gold medal. Patten placed 67th while Arnott ranked 71st out of the 72 that finished.\nThe final event was the men's slalom which took place on 19 February. None of the three Australian competitors qualified for the second round, with Day once again being the best performing of the Aussies, finishing 54th. Arnott finished 65th and Patten 76th.\nCross-country skiing.\nAustralia entered two athletes in cross-country skiing at the 1952 Olympics with Bruce Haslingden and Cedric Sloane being selected for the nation in what was their only appearance at an Olympics. Paying for their own expenses relating to the Games, Haslingden and Sloane competed in two events.\nThe first event for the duo was the men's 18 kilometres which was held on 18 February. After being held under excellent snow conditions, Haslingden would finish one place higher than Sloane as they placed in 74th and 75th respectively; Hallgeir Brenden from Norway took the gold medal in the event. Two days later, the duo competed in the men's 50 kilometres, where they would not finish the event; they retired after falling 12 kilometres behind the leaders. Veikko Hakulinen from Finland claimed the gold medal with a time of 3 hours and 33 minutes.\nFigure skating.\nAustralia entered three figure skaters in the 1952 Games with Adrian Swan, Nancy Burley and Gweneth Molony representing the nation. In the men's singles, Swan, for whom 1952 would be his only Olympics, was initially refused to be entered by the Victorian Skating Association, but was later allowed by the International Skating Union. After completing the compulsory figures in 12th place, he would go on to finish in 10th place with a score of 1,248.2, while Dick Button from the United States won the gold medal.\nIn the ladies' singles, Burley and Molony, who both only competed in the 1952 Games, were selected on 14 October 1951 as part of the announcement that included the skiing reveal as well. Heading into the Olympics, Molony was the two-time defending national ladies' singles champion who had won at the Glaciarium. At the event, held 16–17 February (compulsory figures) and 20 February (free skating), Burley would go on to finish the higher of the two Australian athletes, placing 14th with 1220.7 points. Molony would finish seven spots behind, in 21st, with 1119.1 points. The gold medal was won by Jeannette Altwegg from Great Britain.\nSpeed skating.\nIn the first of three Olympic appearances, Colin Hickey was the only speed-skater to compete for Australia at the 1952 Games. He competed in three speed skating events with those being the 500m, 1500m and the 5000m. His first event of the games was the men's 500 metres which took place on the 16 February. From a field of 42 competitors, Hickey finished 29th with a time of 46.2 seconds, three seconds behind the gold medallist in Ken Henry from the United States. The following day, he competed in the men's 1500 metres where he came in 30th position out of 39 with a time of 2:30.4, ten seconds behind the gold medallist in Hjalmar Andersen from Norway. His final event of the Olympics was the men's 5000 metres where he finished 28th out of 35 skaters with a time of eight minutes and 57 seconds. He was forty seconds behind Anderson who claimed the gold."

It is within the Badminton House estate, and the deer park surrounding the house hugs the eastern edge of the hamlet.\nThe church of St Michael and All Angels was begun in the early 13th century, altered in the 14th and restored in the 19th. It is a Grade I listed building. Its parish has been merged with that of Badminton, and is now part of the Badminton Benefice grouping.\nLittle Badminton was designated as a Conservation Area in 1983. Little Badminton farmhouse, on Church Lane, is from the 18th and 19th centuries but is probably a remodelling of a 17th-century house. A late medieval dovecote on the village green is Grade II* listed and has been called \"probably the best early dovecote in the country\".\nThe 1965 romantic drama movie \"Sky West and Crooked\" (known in the United States as \"Gypsy Girl\"), directed by John Mills and featuring Hayley Mills, was filmed entirely in and around Little Badminton."

        "text": "James Bradley Johnson (born September 13, 1968) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback for 17 seasons in the National Football League (NFL), Johnson played for the Minnesota Vikings, Washington Redskins, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and Dallas Cowboys. He is best known for his time with the Buccaneers, whom he led to their Super Bowl XXXVII title over the Oakland Raiders.\nJohnson is also notable for being the first player in the NFL to complete a touchdown pass to himself, doing so in a 1997 game against the Carolina Panthers. He remained the only player to do so until Marcus Mariota repeated the feat in .\nEarly life and college.\nBorn in Marietta, Georgia, Brad Johnson attended Charles D. Owen High School in Black Mountain, North Carolina. At Owen High School, Johnson played football and basketball; he received All-American honors as quarterback on the football team and all-state honors as a member of the basketball team.\nAfter graduating from Owen High School in 1987, Johnson attended Florida State University. From 1987 to 1989, Johnson played on the Florida State Seminoles men's basketball team and started 11 games as a freshman. In 1988, Johnson joined the football team (under coach Bobby Bowden) at Florida State as a redshirt freshman and served as holder in every game and played two games as quarterback.\nIn 1989 as a sophomore, Johnson was third-string quarterback behind Peter Tom Willis and Casey Weldon; Johnson completed 7 of 12 passes for 67 yards. Johnson won the 1990 Fiesta Bowl title with the Seminoles. As a junior in 1990, Johnson started the first six games of the season before being replaced by Weldon. With a 4–2 record starting those games, Johnson finished the 1990 season with 109-for-163 passing for a career-high 1,136 yards with 8 touchdowns and 5 interceptions. For the third consecutive season with Johnson, Florida State won a bowl game, the Blockbuster Bowl. Johnson would play nine games (with one start – a win) as a senior in 1991. On 37-for-61 passing for 462 yards, Johnson passed for 5 touchdowns and 3 interceptions, and Florida State won the Cotton Bowl Classic in 1992.\nProfessional career.\nFirst stint with Minnesota Vikings (1992–1998).\n1992–1993.\nIn the 1992 NFL draft, the Minnesota Vikings drafted Johnson in the ninth round as the 227th overall pick. As third-string quarterback behind starter Rich Gannon and backup Sean Salisbury, Johnson dressed for only one game as a rookie in 1992 but did not play. In 1993, Johnson continued to be the third-string quarterback for the first 10 games of the season and was inactive for the final six.\n1994 season.\nIn 1994, Johnson became backup to starter Warren Moon and played his first NFL regular season game in Week 3 (September 18). The Vikings won 42–14 over the Chicago Bears in that game, and Johnson completed 3 of 3 passes for 16 yards. Johnson would play in three more games in 1994. In Week 8 (October 30), a 36–13 win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Johnson completed 5 of 5 passes for 30 yards. Johnson had his first significant playing time in Week 15 (December 17), a 41–19 loss to the Detroit Lions. In that game, Johnson completed 14 of 29 passes for 104 yards.\n1995 season.\nIn the spring of 1995, Johnson joined the London Monarchs of the World League, an American football league based in Europe. With London, Johnson completed 194 of 328 passes for 2,227 yards, 13 touchdowns, and 14 interceptions. Johnson had the most completions of all World League quarterbacks in 1995. For his season with the Monarchs, Johnson earned £12,000. Back with the Minnesota Vikings in 1995, Johnson played five games that season. In a 44–24 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 4 (September 24), Johnson completed one 36-yard pass. However, Minnesota lost 38–21 to the Green Bay Packers in Week 7 (October 22), a game in which Johnson completed 10 of 17 passes for 94 yards and one interception. In that game, Johnson also rushed once for 3 yards. In Week 11 (November 19), Johnson completed 5 of 7 passes for 70 yards in the Vikings' 43–24 win over the New Orleans Saints. Johnson had 9-for-11 passing for 72 yards but one interception in Week 14 (December 9), and Minnesota defeated the Cleveland Browns 27–11.\n1996 season.\nJohnson started eight of twelve games in 1996. Twice, Johnson earned NFC Offensive Player of the Week honors, and he finished third in the NFC with an 89.4 passer rating. In the season opener against the Detroit Lions on September 1, Johnson played in the second half after starter Warren Moon suffered an ankle injury amid 5-for-14 passing. With 1:06 remaining in the fourth quarter, Johnson threw his first career touchdown pass, a 31-yard pass to Cris Carter that would clinch the 17–13 victory for Minnesota. Overall that game, Johnson completed 16 of 23 passes for 157 yards and rushed three times for 14 yards. Johnson started his first game of his career the following week on September 8 and led Minnesota to a 23–17 road win over the Atlanta Falcons. This victory marked the first time Minnesota started 2–0 since 1987. With 15-for-26 passing for 275 yards, Johnson threw for two touchdowns and one interception. Warren Moon would return as starter the following week. Johnson played again in Week 4 with one incomplete pass and saw significant playing time next in Week 8 (October 28), a 15–13 loss to the Chicago Bears. Again replacing an injured Warren Moon, Johnson completed 10 of 15 passes for 79 yards. In the final play of the game, Bryan Cox forced a fumble from Johnson. This was Johnson's only lost fumble of Johnson's five fumbles in 1996.\nJohnson started the next game in Week 9 (November 3), and the Vikings lost to the Kansas City Chiefs 21–6. With 22-for-42 passing, Johnson passed for 218 yards, 1 touchdown, and 2 interceptions and rushed three times for 12 yards. In a backup role in Week 10 (November 10), a 42–23 loss to the Seattle Seahawks, Johnson completed 8 of 12 passes for 123 yards and 1 touchdown and ran twice for 3 yards. Starting Week 11 (November 17), Johnson became the regular starter for the Vikings after Moon was again injured. Johnson led Minnesota to a 4–2 record to end the season. With a Week 15 (December 15) victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 21–10, Minnesota clinched a playoff berth for the season. Johnson clinched the win for Minnesota with a 36-yard touchdown pass to Cris Carter, part of a 99-yard drive. Minnesota finished the regular season 9–7, second place in the NFC Central. Johnson made his postseason debut in the Vikings' game against the defending Super Bowl champion Dallas Cowboys on December 28, 1996. Minnesota lost to Dallas 40–15, as Johnson completed 15 of 27 passes for 208 yards, 1 touchdown, and 2 interceptions and rushed 14 yards on three carries for one touchdown.\n1997 season.\nStarting the first 12 games of 1997, Johnson led Minnesota to an 8–4 record, including a six-game winning streak from September 28 (Week 5) to November 9 (Week 10), before suffering a season-ending neck injury in Week 13. By Week 6, Johnson set a team record with 15 straight games with a touchdown pass. Johnson also had no interceptions in 109 consecutive passes in four consecutive games from October 12 to November 9. In the Vikings' 21–14 win over the Carolina Panthers on October 12 (Week 7), Johnson caught his own deflected pass and ran 3 yards for a touchdown. Johnson became the first player to complete a pass to himself for a touchdown in NFL history. This play won the ESPY award for NFL Play of the Year. In three games, Johnson led the Vikings to fourth-quarter comeback wins. Johnson finished 1997 fourth in the NFC with 20 touchdown passes and 3,036 passing yards.\nOn the morning of the Week 13 \"Monday Night Football\" game, Johnson woke up with a sore neck and saw a chiropractor to be cleared to play. After Johnson passed only 15-for-30 for 117 yards and one interception and was sacked six times, coach Dennis Green benched Johnson and put in Randall Cunningham. The Vikings would lose to the Green Bay Packers 27–11. Cunningham would start the final three games of the season, and Minnesota finished the 1997 season 9–7, won the NFC Wild Card game, and lost the NFC Divisional round.\n1998 season.\nJohnson started the first two games of 1998 for the Vikings, both victories. In the season opener, a 31–7 win over Tampa Bay, Johnson threw for 4 touchdowns and 1 interception over 189 yards and completed 15 of 25 passes. However, Johnson would complete only 18 of 31 passes the following game and throw for 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions before leaving the game during the fourth quarter with a sprained ankle. Randall Cunningham replaced Johnson, and Minnesota won Week 2 (September 13) over the St. Louis Rams 38–31. By Week 8, with Cunningham as starter, the Vikings had a perfect 7–0 record. Johnson returned to action in Week 9 (November 8), in a 31–24 win over the New Orleans Saints, after Cunningham injured his knee. With 28-for-38 passing over 316 yards, Johnson had one passing touchdown and 2 interceptions. However, Johnson broke his thumb on the first play of the third quarter. Cunningham returned as starter the following week, and Johnson next played in the Week 15 50–10 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars. Minnesota finished the 1998 season a franchise-best 15–1 and advanced to the NFC championship game, where they came a field goal short of the Super Bowl against the Atlanta Falcons. Following the season, Vikings coach Dennis Green formally named Randall Cunningham as starting quarterback and traded Brad Johnson to the Washington Redskins for a first, a future second, and a third-round draft pick.\nWashington Redskins (1999–2000).\n1999 season.\nWith 4,005 yards, 24 touchdowns, 13 interceptions, and a 90.0 passer rating, Johnson achieved career highs in passing yards, completions, touchdowns, and passer rating in 1999. His 316 completions set a Washington team record and his 4,005 passing yards ranks fifth all-time in Redskins history. He was also NFC Offensive Player of the Week twice that year again. One such Player of the Week honor came after Week 4 (October 3) after Johnson rallied the Redskins to a 38–36 win over the Carolina Panthers; the Panthers led 21–0 during the game.\nJohnson made the NFC squad of the 2000 Pro Bowl, his first career Pro Bowl appearance.\n2000 season.\nThe following year in 2000 the Redskins went 8–8, Johnson threw more interceptions than touchdowns, and signed with Tampa Bay as a free agent during the offseason while Jeff George started in Washington for 2001. George would go on to have the worst stats in the league and was released for Tony Banks after the second game with a 0–2 start, while Johnson had a strong season in Tampa Bay and won a Super Bowl the following year.\nTampa Bay and the Super Bowl (2001–2004).\nIn 2001, Johnson was pursued by the Baltimore Ravens in the offseason (coached by Brian Billick, his former offensive coordinator with the Vikings) but he spurned them to join the Buccaneers. Johnson was reunited with former Vikings assistant-coach Tony Dungy for his first season with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. That year, he broke the Buccaneers team records for passing yards with 3,406, completions with 340, and attempts with 540. In the 2002 season, he led the Buccaneers to their first Super Bowl championship and earned his second Pro Bowl appearance. He was helped in the Super Bowl by a defense that scored 21 of their 48 points. That year, Johnson also became the first Buccaneers QB to lead the NFC in passer rating at 92.9 and set new team records for passing touchdowns with 22, completion percentage with 62.3, consecutive passes without an interception with 187 and lowest interception percentage with 1.3%. He was NFC Offensive Player of the Week twice.\nOn January 21, 2015, Johnson later admitted to bribing ball boys to alter the footballs used during the Super Bowl. According to Johnson: \"I paid some guys off to get the balls right. I went and got all 100 footballs, and they took care of all of them.\" He also stated that he \"did nothing wrong\", and that he talked to opposing Oakland Raiders QB Rich Gannon beforehand and both agreed that they preferred not to use the slick, brand-new balls that the league provided for the game.\nIn 2003, he won the NFL's \"Quarterback Challenge\" competition, in which he beat Pro Bowl QBs Tom Brady, Matt Hasselbeck, Jeff Garcia, Mark Brunell, Marc Bulger and others like Byron Leftwich and Joey Harrington in a skills competition with four parts involving accuracy, speed and mobility, long distance throw, and \"No Huddle.\" Former teammate Sean Salisbury said that despite having big, strong arms and a great deep ball, Brad always played it safe and went for the fast and easy completion which earned him the nickname \"Checkdown Charlie\" among friends.\nAfter the Super Bowl, the Buccaneers ran into some problems. Although Johnson had good passing stats in 2003–2004 the year after the Super Bowl (3,811 yards, 26 touchdowns to break the Buccaneers' record again, 21 interceptions, and named 2003 Buccaneers MVP by the Tampa Sports Club) and 2004 (63% completion rate) they benched him the fourth game into the 2004 season because the team had gone 4–11 for the last 15 games Johnson started. When the backup quarterback, Chris Simms was injured they started third string quarterback Brian Griese instead of Johnson partly because of salary cap problems. Johnson asked out and was cut from the team at the end of the season. When he couldn't find a starting quarterback job, he signed with the Minnesota Vikings to be the backup quarterback.\nBack in Minnesota (2005–2006).\nIn 2005, Minnesota was struggling with now three-time Pro Bowler Daunte Culpepper starting at quarterback. Randy Moss had been traded in March of that year, and four-time Pro Bowl Center Matt Birk was injured so Culpepper was expected to carry the offense against the top defenses in the NFL. While playing without any offensive weapons, and falling behind early in games the Vikings began the season at 2–5 with Culpepper throwing twice as many interceptions – twelve – as touchdowns – six – and five fumbles (three lost) before tearing his MCL, ACL, and PCL in the seventh game.\nJohnson then took over as starting quarterback and the team then finished the season 7–2 with a six-game winning streak needing only one more win to go to the playoffs. Brad played very well and set a team record for lowest interception to attempt ratio (1.3% – same as his record in Tampa) which was the lowest in the NFL among starting QBs. While starting against teams that included the second (Bears), fourth (Ravens), fifth (Steelers), and seventh (Packers) ranked defenses in the NFL his passer rating was the third best in the NFC among starting quarterbacks, and was also better than three QBs selected to the Pro Bowl. But he struggled in those particular games with the exception of the Bears game in which the Bears had already clinched the division and played all of their 2nd and 3rd stringers. He also scored more touchdowns per game than four selected to the Pro Bowl. And despite his age he threw just as many 40+ yard passes as top 29 yr old QB Peyton Manning – six – in seven fewer games, which was the same amount as his Super Bowl year which had four more games.\nJohnson was named the starting quarterback for the Vikings 2006 season, and a few days before the second game he turned 38 which made him the oldest starting quarterback in the league. Many felt his quick-release style was a good fit for then-new coach Brad Childress's highly touted West Coast system. The knowledge he had acquired from going to the playoffs under four different coaching systems and having winning records with seven different head coaches seemed to be an asset for first time head coach Childress. In the preseason, Johnson had a passer rating of 110.7, one of the top 10 in the league out of more than 100 quarterbacks who performed.\nHowever, in the regular season, Johnson struggled worse than Daunte Culpepper did in 2005, throwing eight touchdowns to fifteen interceptions. Midway through the season, he had already set an NFL record for passes completed short of a first down on third down in a season. Many fans grew restless for the benching of Johnson because of his conservative checkdowns, immobility, and at the same time reckless decisions which plagued the Vikings offense. His quarterback-rating on 3rd downs, with a lead, from behind, and in the red zone were the worst in the entire league. 31 QBs threw more touchdown passes while only 10 threw more interceptions than Johnson in the 2006 NFL season.\nOn February 28, 2007, the Vikings released Johnson in favor of rookie quarterback Tarvaris Jackson.\nDallas Cowboys (2007–2008).\nOn March 5, 2007, Johnson signed a three-year deal with the Dallas Cowboys to back up Tony Romo. Johnson played little in the 2007 season. He played in week 17 against the Washington Redskins, going 7-for-11 for 79 yards in the 27–6 loss.\nDuring the 2008 season, Romo suffered a broken pinkie finger on his throwing hand in week 6 against the Arizona Cardinals. Johnson started for the Cowboys during the next three weeks until the injury healed. In Johnson's week 7 start against the St. Louis Rams, he completed 17 of 34 passes for 234 yards with one touchdown and three interceptions. He also had one fumble in the 34–14 loss. In week 8, in a 13–9 win against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, he passed for 122 yards and one touchdown to Roy Williams, and the Cowboys had the lowest total offensive yards in a winning game: 172 yards. In the week 9 game against the New York Giants, he completed 5 of 11 passes for 71 yards and had two passes intercepted. He was replaced by third-string quarterback Brooks Bollinger at the start of the second half. After the Cowboys' bye week, Romo returned from the broken finger to reclaim the starting role.\nThe Cowboys released Johnson on February 26, 2009.\nLegacy.\nJohnson ranks 63rd in career passer rating in NFL history as of January 2022, above Troy Aikman and Warren Moon, who are 71st and 77th respectively. Johnson went 72–53 as a starter and completed over 60% of his passes for 13 straight seasons (1995–2007), the first quarterback in NFL history to do so.\nJohnson eclipsed the 3,000-yard passing mark five times. In 1999, he became only the second Washington Redskins quarterback in franchise history to eclipse 4,000 yards. He had the top passer rating in the NFC in 2002 and he has earned NFC Offensive Player of the Week honors seven times in his career. He has also broken almost every passer record at Tampa Bay. To date, Johnson and Marcus Mariota are the only NFL quarterbacks to have thrown touchdown passes to themselves (Mariota doing it in the 2018 NFL playoffs). Johnson accomplished this against the Carolina Panthers in 1997, catching his own deflected pass, juking, and running three yards for a touchdown.\nPersonal life.\nJohnson has two sons with his wife, Nikki. His brother-in-law is Mark Richt, former head football coach at the University of Georgia and the University of Miami. Johnson's father is Rick Johnson, who helped establish the Winshape Camps after working several years at Ridgecrest Camps. He currently resides in Athens, Georgia. Both of Johnson's sons, Max and Jake play for the North Carolina Tarheels football team.\nJohnson has also joined the popular social media platform, TikTok, where he is verified and has developed a sizable following under the username @bigbadbrad14. He regularly posts videos of himself performing various trick shots using footballs and basketballs. He starts nearly every video with the phrase “Big bad Brad here, back by popular demand…” and follows it with a humorous phrase followed by the trick shot."

        "text": "Philip Arnold Smith (April 22, 1952 – July 29, 2002) was an American professional basketball player who played for 9 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for various teams, including the Golden State Warriors, and Seattle SuperSonics. Smith played college basketball for the San Francisco Dons.\nCollegiate career.\nA 6'4\" All-American guard from the University of San Francisco (USF), Smith was not heavily recruited out of George Washington High School. After graduating from high school a semester early, Smith followed his older brother and enrolled in night classes at USF. Having been seen playing in a pickup game on campus, he was recruited by coach Bob Gaillard, who enlisted him on the freshman squad (the NCAA did not allow freshmen to play on varsity at this time) where he averaged 16.7 ppg. He went on to lead the team in scoring in each of his three varsity seasons, 15.0, 18.7, and 20.7 ppg, for a career average of 18.1 ppg and was an all-West Coast Conference selection all three years. The Dons made appearances in the 1972 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament placing 4th in the Western Regional after losing to Weber State, and finished in the elite eight in the 1973 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament and 1974 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, where they lost both times to UCLA under John Wooden. As a result, he was drafted #1 in the 1973 ABA draft by the Virginia Squires, but declined leaving college early. He was named to the All-American team his senior year. Scoring 1,523 career points, he excelled at USF becoming the ninth-leading scorer in school history. On February 17, 2001, his number 20 was retired at halftime during a home game against the University of San Diego. He is one of only five players to have their number retired by USF. He was named one of the Top-50 WCC athletes of all time in 2001.\nProfessional career.\nAfter his senior year, Smith was selected by the Golden State Warriors with the 11th pick in the 2nd round of the 1974 National Basketball Association (NBA) draft (29th overall), spending six seasons with them. As a rookie during the 1975 season, he averaged 7.7 points on 48 percent shooting in 74 games and was a member of the Golden State Warriors' first NBA championship team. The following year, he stepped into the starting lineup and averaged a career-best 20.0 points while playing in all 82 games. Smith was a two-time NBA All-Star (1976 and 1977), an All-NBA second-team selection in 1976 and a 1976 All-NBA defensive second-team selection. He played for 9 seasons (1974–1983) in the National Basketball Association (NBA), for the Warriors, the , and the Seattle SuperSonics. Smith finished his NBA career with 9,924 total points and a 15.1 ppg career average. A ruptured Achilles tendon prior to the start of the 1979–80 campaign caused the decline of his career.\nPersonal life.\nWas the third of nine children born to Ben and Thelma Smith of San Francisco. He is survived by his wife of 27 years, Angela, and their five children: Alicia, Philip, Amber, Martin and Peter, and 11 grandchildren. Martin played collegiately for the California Golden Bears from 2002 to 2006; Peter played for his parents' alma mater, the University of San Francisco before transferring to Concordia University (class of 2012).\nSeptember 27 is Phil Smith Day in San Francisco, California as decreed by former Mayor Willie Brown.\nA scholarship endowment in Smith's name and the name of Arthur Zief Jr. was established at the University of San Francisco by Art Zief.\nDeath.\nPhilip Smith died at Palomar Medical Center in Escondido, California from complications with multiple myeloma cancer, after a five-year battle with the disease.

        "text": "Alpine skiing at the 1984 Winter Olympics consisted of six alpine skiing events, held 13–19 February in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia. The men's races were at Bjelašnica and the women's at Jahorina. Due to weather delays (a blizzard), both downhill races were postponed several days and run after the giant slalom races.\nThis was the first Winter Olympics since 1936 which did not also serve as the world championships for alpine skiing. It was the last Olympic program with just six events for alpine skiing; ten events were held in 1988 with the return of the combined event and the addition of Super G.\nBanned from competition at these Olympics by the International Ski Federation (FIS) were top World Cup racers Ingemar Stenmark of Sweden and Hanni Wenzel of Liechtenstein, both double gold medalists at the 1980 Winter Olympics and leading the World Cup in 1984. They had accepted promotional payments directly, rather than through their national ski federations. Also absent was Marc Girardelli, who had not yet gained his citizenship from Luxembourg and was not allowed to compete for his native Austria.\nMedal summary.\nEight nations won medals in alpine skiing, and the United States led the medal table with three gold and two silver. Perrine Pelen was the only racer to win multiple medals, taking a silver and a bronze.\nHost nation Yugoslavia won its first alpine medal in the Winter Olympics with Jure Franko's silver in the men's giant slalom. Czechoslovakia's medal, won by Olga Charvátová in the women's downhill, was its only Olympic medal ever won in alpine skiing.\nParticipating nations.\nForty-two nations sent alpine skiers to compete in the events in Sarajevo. Egypt, Mexico, Monaco and Senegal made their Olympic alpine skiing debuts. Below is a list of the competing nations; in parentheses are the number of national competitors."

        "title": "Uruguay v Brazil (1950 FIFA World Cup)",
        "text": "The match between Uruguay and Brazil was the decisive match of the final stage at the 1950 FIFA World Cup. It was played at the Maracanã Stadium in the then-capital of Brazil, Rio de Janeiro, on 16 July 1950.\nUnlike in other editions of the tournament, which conclude with a one-off final, the 1950 winner was determined by a final group stage, where four teams played in a round-robin format. With Brazil topping the group, one point ahead of Uruguay going into the final round of matches, Uruguay needed a win while Brazil needed only to avoid defeat to become the world champions; neither of the other two teams, Spain and Sweden, could finish first. The match is often regarded as the \"de facto\" final of the 1950 World Cup.\nUruguay won 2–1; Brazil took the lead shortly after half-time thanks to a goal by Friaça, but Juan Alberto Schiaffino equalised midway through the second half, and Alcides Ghiggia completed the comeback with 11 minutes remaining. A victory of an underdog over a heavily favoured side, the result is considered one of the biggest upsets in the history of football. The term Maracanaço (in Portuguese) or Maracanazo (in Spanish), roughly translated as \"The Maracanã Smash\", became synonymous with the match.\nSpectated officially by 173,850 people and possibly by over 200,000, the \"Maracanazo\" is usually seen as the most highly attended football match ever played, though the 1923 FA Cup final may have been attended by up to 300,000 people.\nBackground.\nThe road to the title in the 1950 World Cup was unique; instead of a knockout stage, the preliminary group stage was followed by another round-robin group. Of the 16 teams slated to compete, only 13 arrived. The final four teams were Brazil (the host country and joint-top scorers from the group stage, coming from wins over Mexico and Yugoslavia and a draw against Switzerland), Uruguay (who only had to play one match in their group, an 8–0 win over Bolivia), Spain (who won all three of their group matches, against England, Chile and the United States), and Sweden (who qualified ahead of Paraguay and the defending world champions, Italy).\nBrazil won both of their first two matches convincingly, beating Sweden 7–1 and Spain 6–1 to go top of the group with four points going into the final match. With three points, Uruguay were close behind in second place, although they had to come back from 2–1 down to draw 2–2 with Spain and beat Sweden 3–2, the winning goal coming just five minutes before the end of the game. The match between Brazil and Uruguay, on the other hand, would decide the title; a victory or a draw would grant Brazil the title, whereas Uruguay had to win the match in order to win the championship. Brazil had scored 21 goals in five games before the match with Uruguay, and had defeated both Spain and Sweden with larger margins than the Uruguayans had. As a result, Brazil was extremely confident of victory in the deciding match, with newspapers and politicians declaring victory before the game even began. \nThe 1950 FIFA World Cup was the only version of the tournament to be played with a round-robin final round, and as such is the only FIFA World Cup to date to not have a deciding knock-out final. However, as it was the last game of the tournament (beside Sweden vs Spain), and the result of the match directly determined the champions, the match has come to be commonly referred to as the final, including by FIFA itself.\nAnticipated celebration.\nThe specialised press and the general public were so confident of victory, based on Brazil's almost indomitable form, that they had already started declaring Brazil the new world champions for days prior to the match. Newspapers such as the \"Gazeta Esportiva\" in São Paulo and \"O Mundo\" in Rio de Janeiro proclaimed victory the day before the game. Brazil had won their last two matches (Spain and Sweden) with a very successful attack-minded style of play. Uruguay, however, had encountered difficulties, managing only a draw against Spain and a narrow victory over Sweden. The comparison of those results seemed to show that the Brazilians were set to defeat Uruguay as easily as they had defeated Spain and Sweden.\nMoreover, in the Copa América, also held in Brazil the previous year, the hosts had won by scoring 46 goals in just eight matches. Ecuador was beaten 9–1, Bolivia 10–1, and runners-up Paraguay were defeated with a margin of 7–0. Further, Brazil beat Uruguay 5–1.\nTwenty-two gold medals were made with each player's name imprinted on them and the mayor of Rio, Angelo Mendes de Moraes, delivered a speech on the day of the game with the words: \"You, players, who in less than a few hours will be hailed as champions by millions of compatriots! You, who have no rivals in the entire hemisphere! You, who will overcome any other competitor! You, who I already salute as victors!\" A victory song, \"Brasil Os Vencedores\" (\"Brazil the Victors\"), was composed and practised, ready to be played after the final.\nHowever, Paulo Machado de Carvalho, then a São Paulo FC leader, but later head of the Brazilian squad that won the World Cups of 1958 and 1962, opposed such premature claims of victory. During a visit to the training session at the Estádio São Januário on the eve of the game, Paulo found several politicians making impassioned speeches to the players, as well as journalists, photographers and others arriving to join the \"future champions\". When he warned coach Flávio Costa about the risk of upsetting the players' concentration, Paulo was ignored. Frustrated, he told his son Tuta, who was with him, \"we are going to lose\".\nOn the morning of 16 July 1950, the streets of Rio de Janeiro were bustling with activity. An improvised carnival was organised, with thousands of signs celebrating the world title, and chants of \"Brazil must win!\". This spirit was maintained right up until the final minutes of the match, which filled the Maracanã Stadium with a paid attendance of 173,850 and an actual attendance of up to 220,000 by some estimates, including thousands who entered the stadium illegally. This is an all-time record attendance for a football match that is unlikely to be broken in an era when practically all high-profile matches are held in all-seater stadiums; until its first great remodelling in 1999, the Maracanã was mostly concrete grandstands with no seats.\nUruguay's preparation.\nThe Brazilian newspaper \"O Mundo\" printed an early edition on the day of the final containing a photograph of Brazil with the caption \"These are the world champions\". Disgusted with the premature assumption, Uruguay's captain, Obdulio Varela, bought as many copies as he could, laid them on his bathroom floor and encouraged his teammates to spit and urinate on them.\nIn the moments prior to the match, coach Juan López informed his team in Uruguay's dressing room that their best chance of surviving the powerful offensive line of Brazil would come through adopting a defensive strategy. After he left, Varela stood up and addressed the team himself, saying \"Juancito is a good man, but today, he is wrong. If we play defensively against Brazil, our fate will be no different from Spain or Sweden.\" Varela then delivered an emotional speech about how they should go against all odds and not be intimidated by the fans or the opposing team. The speech, as was later confirmed, played a huge part in the outcome of the game. In response to his squad's underdog status, the captain delivered the memorable line, \"\" (\"Boys, outsiders are just stickdolls. Let's start the show.\" or \"Outsiders don't play. Let the show begin.\")\nMatch.\nSummary.\nThe game began as form predicted, with Brazil attacking against the Uruguayan defensive line for the majority of the first half. Unlike Spain and Sweden, however, the Uruguayans managed to maintain their defence and the first half ended scoreless. Brazil scored the first goal of the match only two minutes after the interval, with São Paulo forward Friaça shooting low past goalkeeper Roque Máspoli. After the goal, Varela took the ball and disputed the validity of the goal to the referee, arguing that Friaça was offside. Varela drew out this argument, going so far as to demand that the referee listen to him through an interpreter. By the time the conversation ended, the crowd had calmed down, then Varela took the ball to the center of the field, and shouted to his team, \"Now, it's time to win!\"\nUruguay managed to take control of the game. When faced with a capable Uruguayan attack, Brazil showed their frail defense, and Juan Alberto Schiaffino scored the equaliser in the 66th minute. Later, Alcides Ghiggia, running down the right side of the field, scored another goal, with a low shot that went just under goalkeeper Barbosa (who, having anticipated a cross from Ghiggia's position, dived a moment too late to stop the ball from rolling under him), with only 11 minutes remaining on the clock. The crowd went virtually silent after the second Uruguay goal until English referee George Reader signalled the end of the match with Uruguay winning 2–1.\nDetails.\n&lt;section begin=FR-6 /&gt;&lt;section end=FR-6 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=Lineups /&gt;\n&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;section end=Lineups /&gt;\nMatch rules\nAftermath.\nWhen the match ended, the stadium was filled with \"disturbing and traumatic absolute silence,\" and famous radio journalist Ary Barroso (briefly) retired after the match. A group of Brazilian fans started a fight with Uruguayans in a hotel lobby, and 8 Uruguayans died as a result of celebrations in Uruguay. However, the players and most Brazilian fans behaved well in defeat; the Uruguayan newspaper \"El Dia\" declared Brazil \"the other winner\" and said \"if before the match we respected the Brazilian sporting power, after the encounter our respect grew and we even more profoundly admired the great spirit demonstrated by the Brazilians in adversity.\" \nBrazil did later rebound and win back-to-back World Cups in 1958 and 1962. Two unused squad members of the 1950 team, Nílton Santos and Carlos Castilho, were also members of the victorious Brazil squads that were to come. Santos played in both finals whereas Castilho only played in the 1954 FIFA World Cup and in 2007 was posthumously awarded the 1958 and 1962 winning medals as a squad member, having been Gilmar's reserve in both tournaments. Four members of the 1950 team—the captain Augusto, Juvenal, Bigode and Chico—never played for Brazil again.\nBrazil's white shirts with blue collars that were worn in the final game were, in the wake of the defeat, subject to criticism by the country's sports federation for being \"unpatriotic\", with pressure mounting to change the colours. In 1953 and with the support of the Brazilian Sports Confederation, a competition was held by the newspaper \"Correio da Manhã\" to design a new outfit, with the rule being that it must incorporate the colours of the national flag. Eventually, the competition was won by newspaper illustrator Aldyr Garcia Schlee, who came up with the design of a yellow shirt with a green trim, blue shorts with white trim, and white socks. Schlee had initially been deterred from using all four colours, believing that yellow and white was too similar to the Holy See.\nThe new kit was first used in March 1954 against Chile, and has been used ever since. The runner-up design was a green shirt, white shorts, and yellow socks. When Brazil first won the World Cup in 1958, they wore their second kit as the new colours clashed with those of hosts Sweden.\n\"Phantom of '50\".\nThe term \"Phantom of '50\" was later used to refer to the fear that Brazilians and Brazil national football team feel of the Uruguay national football team due to this loss. Each time Brazil and Uruguay play at Maracanã Stadium, the theme resurfaces.\nIn 1993, after losing points in important matches (two draws with Ecuador and Uruguay themselves, and a loss to Bolivia in first round of the qualifiers), Brazil was struggling to qualify for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. The final match of the qualifying South American group between Brazil and Uruguay was tense, surrounded by fear, as Brazil needed to win the game to qualify. Brazil beat and eliminated Uruguay by 2–0, with two goals by Romário at the end of the second half, who had been ignored in the tournament and was urgently called in to save Brazil.\nThe theme reappeared in the Brazilian press as Uruguay qualified for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Uruguay often emphasized the theme, giving the team motivation and encouragement in matches against Brazil. When Brazil hosted the 2014 World Cup and again had a hard defeat, this time a 1–7 humiliation in the semi-final with Germany in Belo Horizonte, the game was subsequently known as \"Mineirazo\", given it took place at the Mineirão stadium and echoed the same sense of defeat as in 1950. Tereza Borba, adoptive daughter of goalkeeper Moacir Barbosa, who was scapegoated for the defeat for years, said the 2014 loss was enough to redeem her father's legacy, and most of the Brazilian media took the opportunity to contrast the 2014 semi-final as an embarrassment compared to the close defeat in the Maracanazo. Ghiggia himself stated that while both games were traumatic, they could not be compared as the 1950 game had more at stake.\nGhiggia was the last surviving player from the game; he died on 16 July 2015, exactly 65 years after scoring the decisive goal, at the age of 88. Schlee died on 17 November 2018, aged 83."

The club was formed in 1863, although cricket is recorded as having been played by seamen since at least the 17th century.\nBetween 1912 and 1929 some of the Navy's matches had first-class status, particularly those against other branches of the services, although they also played Cambridge University, MCC, and - in 1927 - the touring New Zealanders. Additionally, in both 1910 and 1911 a combined Army and Navy side played a first-class fixture against a combined Oxford and Cambridge side.\nThe inter-services competition against the Army and RAF still continues, although it no longer has first-class status. Another competition, the Navy Cup, is competed for within the Navy itself. In the 21st century, the Navy has also set up a women's cricket team."

        "text": "Brian John Dowling (born April 1, 1947) is a former American football quarterback in the National Football League (NFL) for the New England Patriots and Green Bay Packers. He also was a member of the Charlotte Hornets in the World Football League (WFL). He played college football at Yale University.\nEarly years.\nDowling attended St. Ignatius High School, located in Cleveland, Ohio, where he was a multi-sport standout.\nAs a junior in 1963, he led the team to the City Championship Charity Game, where they lost 16-30 to Benedictine High School, after a broken collarbone and a bruised kidney forced Dowling to go to the hospital at halftime and miss the rest of the game. It would be the only game his teams would lose in his high school football career. As a senior in 1964, he avenged that loss against Benedictine in the same City Championship Charity Game in a 48-6 rout, passing for 4 touchdowns and running for a 71-yard score. His teams finished with a 36-1 record.\nIn basketball, he led the team to a City title by making 4 free throws in the championship game's last 34 seconds to help turn a 13 point deficit into a 53-50 victory. In tennis, he made the state doubles finals as a sophomore and the regional singles finals as a senior. He also practiced baseball.\nIn 2001, he was inducted into the Cleveland Sports Hall of Fame.\nCollege career.\nAlthough he had multiple NCAA Division I scholarship offers and nearly decided to attend USC, his father convinced him to enroll at Yale University and also paid his full tuition. As a freshman, he led the junior varsity team (Yale Bulldogs) to a 6-0 record. He also averaged 24.5 points per game in basketball and competed in tennis.\nAs a sophomore, he was named the starter at quarterback. He suffered a season-ending knee injury in the first quarter of the second game against Rutgers University. He finished with 12-of-22 completions (54.5%) for 89 yards, 10 carries for 51 yards and 2 passing touchdowns. He was replaced by Pete Doherty.\nAs a junior, he suffered a broken right wrist in a preseason practice and missed the first 3 games. He was reinserted as the starter in the fourth game against Columbia University. He led the team to an Ivy League championship, which included a 24-20 come-from-behind victory over Harvard University, with a 66-yard touchdown pass in the last 2:16 minutes of the game. He registered 44-of-98 completions (44.9%) for 684 yards, 46 carries for 226 yards, 9 passing touchdowns, 4 rushing touchdowns, one receiving touchdown (a 60-yard reception) and 10 interceptions.\nAs a senior, he set school single-season passing marks with 92-of-160 completions (57.5%) for 1,554 yards, 82 carries for 313 yards, 19 passing touchdowns, 6 rushing touchdowns, one receiving touchdown (a 30-yard reception) and 10 interceptions. In his final collegiate game, his 1968 Yale team was undefeated, nationally ranked and heavily favored going into The Game against Harvard University at Cambridge. Although likewise unbeaten and untied, the Crimson were unheralded. Harvard, trailing 29–13 with 42 seconds remaining, rallied to tie the game, while Dowling stood helplessly on the sideline. As a result, both schools shared the Ivy League title and inspired the \"Harvard Crimson\" the next day to print the headline, \"Harvard Beats Yale, 29-29\". Dowling ranked ninth in the Heisman Trophy voting, with the fourth-most first-place votes.\nHe finished his college career with a 16-1-1 record and two Ivy League titles. The 14–17 loss came in the Rutgers game he couldn't finish because of injury as a sophomore.\nProfessional career.\nDowling was selected by the Minnesota Vikings in the 11th round (277th overall) of the 1969 NFL draft. He was tried at 3 different positions (mostly at running back) during training camp. He was waived on September 6. After being cut, he played for the Bridgeport Jets of the Atlantic Coast Football League.\nOn February 9, 1970, he was signed by the New England Patriots. He spent two seasons on the practice squad. In 1972, he was the backup behind Jim Plunkett, playing enough to complete 29 of 54 passes (53.7%) for 2 touchdowns and one interception. In 1973, he remained as a reserve player behind Plunkett and didn't record any stat. He was released on August 14, 1974.\nOn June 28, 1974, he was signed by the New York Stars of the World Football League, becoming one of the first NFL players to join the new league. After the thirteenth game of the season, the team was relocated and renamed as the Charlotte Hornets. He was the third-string quarterback behind Tom Sherman and Gary Danielson. He registered 14-of-38 completions (36.8%) for 140 yards, one touchdown and 5 interceptions.\nIn 1975, he was the backup behind Sherman, tallying 30-of-55 completions (54.5%) for 383 yards, one touchdown and 6 interceptions. The league ceased operations 12 weeks into the regular season on October 22.\nOn February 12, 1976, he was signed by the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League. He was released on July 12.\nOn April 11, 1977, he was signed as a free agent by the Washington Redskins. On September 9, he was released after the team opted to keep only 2 quarterbacks. On November 14, he was signed by the Green Bay Packers to provide depth after starter Lynn Dickey suffered a broken leg. He was cut on July 5, 1978.\nOn July 10, 1978, he was signed by the Los Angeles Rams, reuniting with George Allen who was also his head coach with the Redskins. He was released on August 22.\nPersonal life.\nDowling was a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity and the Skull and Bones Society. The character B.D., in the \"Doonesbury\" comic strip, was originally based on and named after Dowling, a Yale classmate of cartoonist Garry Trudeau. In 1969, he appeared on \"The Dating Game\" television show with former Harvard quarterback Frank Champi.\nHe was involved with the Ivy Satellite Network, which specialized in closed-circuit telecasts of sport games between smaller colleges. In 1983, he was hired as the director of sports marketing at Boston University. Dowling was an insurance industry consultant and worked with a venture capitalist in the Boston area."

His most notable was as chief scout.\nDavidson is considered by many to be one of the best hockey scouts of all time and was credited with building the Toronto Maple Leafs teams during the 1960s which dominated the NHL by winning the Stanley Cup four times (1961–62, 1962–63, 1963–64, 1966–67) within a six-year period. His name was engraved on the cup for 1962 and 1967, though was a member of all four cups wins by Toronto in the 1960s.\nIn 1995 the board of directors of the Maple Leafs organization awarded Davidson with the J. P. Bickell Memorial Award."

        "title": "John Hart (baseball)",
        "text": "John Henry Hart Jr (born July 21, 1948) is an American former professional baseball executive who served as the general manager in Major League Baseball for the Cleveland Indians and Texas Rangers and president of baseball operations for the Atlanta Braves. He also was the interim field manager of the Indians in 1989, third-base coach of the Baltimore Orioles in 1988, and a studio analyst for the MLB Network.\nEarly life.\nHart was born in Tampa, Florida, and graduated from Winter Park High School. He attended Seminole Junior College where he was catcher on the baseball team. In 1969 he won All-American honors and began his professional career as a catcher in the Montreal Expos organization where he played under the name John Reen. He caught with them for three seasons before leaving the organization and returning to Florida. He graduated in 1973 from the University of Central Florida with majors in history and physical education.\nBaseball career.\nBaltimore Orioles.\nHart then coached baseball at William R. Boone High School in Orlando, Florida before joining the Orioles organization in 1982 as a minor league manager. He managed in their minor league organization for six seasons before joining the major league team as third base coach in 1988.\nCleveland Indians.\nIn 1989, John Hart joined the Cleveland Indians as a special assignment scout, then later replaced Doc Edwards as manager for the final 19 games of the regular season (the team put up an 8–11 record during those games). For the next two seasons, Hart served as director of baseball operations for the club.\nIn September 1991, John Hart replaced Hank Peters as general manager and executive vice president of the Indians. During the next ten years, the Indians were 870–681 under Hart. They won six of the seven possible American League Central division titles, which was introduced for the 1994 strike shortened season (1995–99 and 2001) with appearances in the World Series in 1995 and 1997. Hart built the team's core through the draft, successful scouting and trades. He signed young players before the arbitration process got underway and thus enticed veteran players to stay with the team.\nTexas Rangers.\nAt the beginning of the 2001 season, Hart announced it would be his last season as general manager of the Indians. After the season, Hart stayed true to his word and assistant GM Mark Shapiro took over as general manager on November 1. But, rather than take another position with the club or retire, Hart instead took the general manager position which had opened up with the Texas Rangers after the departure of Doug Melvin.\nOn February 15, 2004, the Rangers traded Alex Rodriguez (the AL Most Valuable Player of the 2003 season and only the second MVP on a last place team) to the New York Yankees for Alfonso Soriano and Joaquín Árias. They also had to pay over a third of the $179 million remaining on his contract (signed in 2000). \nOn July 21, 2004 the Rangers announced a contract extension for Hart for a guaranteed two more years and an annual mutual option to extend the contract each year thereafter. In addition, the contract stipulated that once it was terminated by either side, it automatically converted to a five-year agreement for Hart to serve as senior advisor to the owner.\nJust over a year after agreeing to the extension, on October 4, 2005, Hart stepped down as general manager and was replaced by Jon Daniels. Hart then became a senior advisor to Daniels. During his four years as general manager, the Rangers compiled a record of 311–337, never advancing to the playoffs. After other teams showed interest in hiring Hart as their general manager during the 2005 off-season, the Rangers extended his senior advisor contract for three more years. He would serve in that post through 2013. In return, he agreed not to consider any other GM positions with rival clubs.\nAtlanta Braves.\nSoon after his Rangers contract expired, the Atlanta Braves announced Hart had signed with the organization as senior advisor for baseball operations, similar to the position Hart held with the Rangers. Hart and long-time Braves executive John Schuerholz had been friends since long before the Braves and Indians met in the 1995 World Series.\nOn September 22, 2014, Hart was named as the Braves interim general manager after the Braves released incumbent Frank Wren.\nOn October 23, 2014, the Braves promoted Hart to president of baseball operations. The team, at the time stuck in the lower reaches of the National League East Division, was in the midst of a \"reset\" which saw them significantly strengthen their young pitching talent, though the rebuild came at a cost. Major League Baseball began to investigate the club's practices in signing amateur players from international markets. The probe resulted in the resignation and subsequent lifetime ban of Hart's subordinate, general manager John Coppolella, who was later reinstated, and the one-year suspension of the club's scouting director. Hart was not directly implicated in nor sanctioned for the scandal; however, he resigned in its wake on November 17, 2017. The following season, , saw the Braves improve significantly on the field, winning 90 games (an 18-game upswing from ) to capture the division championship under their new management team.\nPersonal life.\nHart and his wife Sandi have been married since 1970."

        "title": "New South Wales rugby league team",
        "text": "The New South Wales rugby league team has represented the Australian state of New South Wales in rugby league football since the sport's beginnings there in 1907. Also known as the Blues due to their sky blue jerseys. This annual event is a series of three games competing for the State of Origin shield. As of 2023, the team is coached by Michael Maguire and captained by James Tedesco.\nPrior to 1980 when the \"state-of-origin\" selection criteria were introduced, the New South Wales team, in addition to playing annually against Queensland, played matches against foreign touring sides and occasionally toured overseas themselves. They have played all their home matches at ANZ stadium in Sydney, New South Wales in the largest stadium in the state, since it was built in 1999 for the 2000 Sydney Olympics. The New South Wales team retained the 2019 Holden State of Origin Shield after beating Queensland 2–1 after being down 1–0, becoming the first NSW team to win a decider since the 2005 side, and were victorious again in the 2021 series.\nHistory.\nPre-Origin era (1907–1980).\n The New South Wales rugby league team pre-dates the Australian national team, playing their inaugural match against a rebel New Zealand rugby team on the 1907–08 New Zealand rugby tour of Australia and Great Britain under existing rugby union rules. That inaugural \"All Blues\" side, the first football team assembled by the newly formed NSWRFL was:\nBacks: Charles Hedley · Johnno Stuntz · Ed Fry · Dally Messenger · Frank Cheadle · Albert Rosenfeld · Lou D'Alpuget\nForwards: Harry Hamill · Arthur Hennessy · Bob Mable · Peter Moir · Sid Pearce · Billy Cann · Robert Graves · Herb Brackenreg\nTwo further matches were played against New Zealand before their tour took them to the Northern Hemisphere, with Jim Devereaux also featuring for the Blues. The visiting \"All Golds\" won all three games. However, on the return leg of their tour, almost a year later, with the New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership established, the Blues won the first two matches they ever played under 13-a-side rules against New Zealand. Later in 1908 the Queensland team, whose first taste of rugby league football was also against the visiting Kiwis, traveled to Sydney for the first series of games between the two states. New South Wales won all three matches, setting a precedent for interstate dominance that would continue throughout most of the 20th century.\nIn 1910 New South Wales defeated the touring England team in two of their three games. After that they became the first Blues side to travel to Queensland for the annual interstate series.\nIn 1912 the New South Wales team first toured New Zealand. They also visited New Zealand in 1913. During the 1913 New Zealand rugby league tour of Australia New South Wales played four matches against the Kiwis, winning three of them.\nThe New South Wales team lost its first game against Queensland in 1922. In 2019 the Blues also toured New Zealand.\nDuring the 1951 French rugby league tour of Australia and New Zealand New South Wales played one match against the successful France national rugby league team, a 14-all draw.\nThe New South Wales team hosted 2 matches of the 1953 American All Stars tour of Australia and New Zealand at the Sydney Cricket Ground, winning 62–41 and 27–18.\nIn a 1954 tour match between Great Britain and New South Wales the referee left the field in disgust at the players' persistent fighting after 56 minutes so the match was abandoned.\nState of Origin era (1980–present).\nNew South Wales' dominance over Queensland came to an end with the introduction of 'state of origin' selection rules in the early 1980s.\nDuring the Super League war, in 1997 New South Wales was represented by two teams: one made up of players from clubs that remained loyal to the Australian Rugby League, which competed in the 1997 State of Origin series; another made up of players from clubs that joined the rebel Super League which competed in the one-off Super League Tri-series.\nRicky Stuart, who had previously coached New South Wales in 2005, was announced as the first full-time Blues coach in November 2010. Following the 2012 series, the Blues' seventh consecutive loss, Stuart resigned the role. Stuart took a role as the Parramatta Eels head coach in 2013, citing family reasons for his move. Although the Blues continued their losing streak during Stuart's tenure, he is credited with restoring passion and pride to the NSW jersey and closing the gap between the two states. He was replaced by former Canberra, NSW and Australia teammate Laurie Daley. Daley's appointment as NSW State of Origin coach was announced in August 2012 and effective from season 2013. Daley got job over candidates including Trent Barrett, Brad Fittler and Daniel Anderson. Daley coached the Blues to a series win in 2014, their first since 2005 and over his coaching rival and long time Canberra &amp; Australian teammate Mal Meninga. Daley ended Meninga's and Queensland's run of eight series wins with victories in Game I and Game II of the 2014 series. In 2015, New South Wales suffered its biggest origin loss losing 52–6 against Queensland in the decider. In 2016, New South Wales lost the series 2–1 but managed to win the third and final dead rubber game. In 2017, New South Wales were widely tipped to win the series as Queensland had a number of key players injured. In Game 1, New South Wales beat Queensland in convincing fashion 28–4 and in Game 2 were leading the maroons 16–6 at halftime before Queensland won the game in the final two minutes to win 18–16. In Game 3, New South Wales lost the series losing 22–6 in Brisbane. In August 2017, Daley was terminated as coach of New South Wales.\nIn 2018, Brad Fittler was appointed as the new coach and left out established players such as Aaron Woods, Josh Jackson, Blake Ferguson and Josh Dugan. The Blues went on to win the series 2–1. In 2019, the Blues were widely tipped to win the series owing to the retirement from representative football of Queensland Origin greats Cooper Cronk, Billy Slater and Cameron Smith. However, Queensland had an upset win 18–14 over the Blues in Game 1 forcing Fittler to make seven changes to the Blues starting line-up. Though he was roundly criticised for the move, the Blues went on to win the series 2–1, easily defeating Queensland 38–6 in Game 2 in Optus Stadium in Perth Western Australia, the greatest winning margin of a Blues squad since Game 3, 2000. Finally, in a thrilling Game 3 at ANZ Stadium in Sydney, winger Blake Ferguson and fullback James Tedesco combined to score the winning try with just 32 seconds to go in the game to secure the series, off the back of play started from recalled halfback Mitchell Pearce. In the 2020 State of Origin series, New South Wales narrowly lost game 1 against Queensland 18–14 before bouncing back in game 2 winning 34–10. In game 3, New South Wales travelled to Brisbane for the decider, the blues would lose the match at Suncorp Stadium 20–14. The 2021 State of Origin series was one which had been interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic with all three matches being played in Queensland. New South Wales would win convincingly in game 1 defeating Queensland 50–6 in Townsville before defeating Queensland 26–0 in Brisbane to claim the series. Queensland managed to avoid a series clean sweep by winning game 3 20–18. New South Wales started the 2022 State of Origin series with a narrow 16–10 loss in Sydney before a convincing 44–12 victory over Queensland in Perth during game 2. In game 3, the blues once again needed to play a decider in Brisbane. New South Wales lead the game 12-10 at half-time but conceded two late tries in the second half and lost 22-12.\nColours and badge.\nThe primary colour of New South Wales Blues is sky blue, which represents the state colour of New South Wales.

        "text": "Eric Ray Turner (September 20, 1968 – May 28, 2000) was an American professional football player who was a safety for the Cleveland Browns, Baltimore Ravens and Oakland Raiders in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the UCLA Bruins, earning All-American honors in 1990. Turner was selected by Cleveland with the second overall pick of the 1991 NFL Draft. He died of stomach cancer at the age of 31.\nCollege career.\nTurner attended Ventura High School and then played college football for the UCLA Bruins, where he was an All-American in 1990. Nicknamed \"E-Rock\" by his teammates, Turner drew comparisons to former Bruins great Don Rogers. He was the 2nd overall pick in the 1991 NFL Draft—the highest choice for a defensive back in football's modern era (technically the highest since Jerry Stovall in 1963).\nProfessional career and death.\nOriginally drafted by the Cleveland Browns in the first round with the second overall pick, signed a four-year, $6 million contract, which included a $3.15 million signing bonus, making the first-year compensation a record for a National Football League rookie. In 1994, Turner had his finest NFL season. He recorded a league-leading 9 interceptions on his way to being named First-team All-Pro. One of those interceptions included a 93-yard return for a touchdown against the Arizona Cardinals in a 32–0 victory. In week 15 against the powerful Dallas Cowboys, Turner tackled Jay Novacek at the one yard line on the game's final play to seal a 19–14 victory. Turner was an integral part of the Browns' number one ranked defense.\nAfter the Browns moved to Baltimore in 1996, Turner played one season for the new Baltimore Ravens. He made his second Pro Bowl and was second on the team with 112 tackles and tied for lead with five interceptions, although those numbers went largely unnoticed on a defense that allowed 441 points, third-highest in the league. Following the 1996 season Turner, who had the most expensive contract among all NFL safeties, was cut by the Ravens and became an unrestricted free agent for the first time in his six-year career. Turner then signed a four-year, $6 million deal with the Raiders in 1997.\nTurner recorded 30 interceptions in just 109 career games, including returns for touchdowns of 93 and 94 yards.\nIn the 2000 NFL offseason, after missing April mini camp with the Raiders, rumors would start circulating that Turner was suffering from stomach cancer after it was reported that Turner had lost about 70 pounds from the 215-pounds he was at during the 1999 season. Two weeks before his death, Turner would release a statement through his agent attempting to dispute any rumors about his health stating “I realize people are concerned, but I have chosen to keep this issue within my family…” “…Contrary to published reports, I have not lost 70 pounds and am not gravely ill.”\nOn May 28, 2000, Turner would be rushed to Los Robles Hospital &amp; Medical Center in Thousand Oaks, California via ambulance after reportedly having trouble breathing. He would be admitted into intensive care and died six hours after arrival at the age of 31. The cause of Turner’s death was listed as “complications of abdominal cancer.”\nUpon his death, teammate Napoleon Kaufman said \"He was compassionate and a class act. It was truly a pleasure to have known Eric and I will miss him.\" Another teammate, Greg Biekert, said \"He always brought his competitive nature to the team, especially on defense. He was truly someone who you wanted around, I mean in life, too.\" In 2001, he was named to the Ventura County Sports Hall of Fame. The football field at Ventura High School is named in his honor."

He played ten seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the New York Rangers from 1972 to 1982. He won the Calder Memorial Trophy in 1973.\nPlaying career.\nSteve \"The Sarge\" Vickers played junior hockey with the Toronto Marlboros of the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) and was named a First Team league All-Star. He was drafted 10th overall by the New York Rangers in the 1971 NHL Amateur Draft. He spent a season in the minor leagues with the Omaha Knights of the Central Hockey League before the Rangers called him up in 1972.\nVickers, centre Walt Tkaczuk and winger Bill Fairbairn formed a line that proved to be one of the 1970s' best two-way forward trios. Vickers scored 30 goals and 23 assists for a total of 53 points and was awarded the Calder Memorial Trophy as rookie of the year. He played all of his NHL career with the Rangers, scoring thirty or more goals in each of four seasons. He was later moved to the Rangers' first line with Rod Gilbert and Jean Ratelle. Vickers' best season was 1974-75, when he scored 41 goals and was named to the NHL's Second all-star team. He remained effective until his final season, in which his production dropped sharply; he finished the year in the minor leagues with the Springfield Indians, after which he retired.\nVickers played in the NHL All-Star Game in 1975 and 1976. He made NHL history in 1972 when he became the first rookie, as well as the first New York Ranger, to score hat tricks in two consecutive games (12 November versus the Los Angeles Kings and 15 November versus the Philadelphia Flyers). In February 1976, Vickers set the Rangers team record for most points in a game, with seven, against the Washington Capitals.\nLegacy.\nIn the 2009 book \"100 Ranger Greats\", the authors ranked Vickers at No. 18 all-time of the 901 New York Rangers who had played during the team's first 82 seasons."

        "text": "The Metropolitan Basketball Association (MBA), also shortened as Metroball, was a professional basketball league in the Philippines that ran from 1998 until 2002.\nThe league used a home-and-away system, in which teams represent companies, the MBA teams represented a particular city, province or island in the country.\nHistory.\nThe MBA played its first game on March 7, 1998 at the Don Narciso Ramos Sports Complex in Lingayen, Pangasinan. The MBA was widely viewed as broadcast giant ABS-CBN's attempt to undermine the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA) after failing to snatch its broadcast rights in 1998, even as far as raid the PBA for talent in order to compete.\nMetroball allowed foreigners to play for their teams, not requiring Philippine passports of them, nor requiring those foreigners to have Filipino blood. All the league required was that these players be born in the Philippines.\nAs a direct result of this practice, the MBA and its foreign-born players began attracting attention away from the PBA, forcing the PBA to escalate their own players' salaries and practically rendering the PBA draft useless through a \"direct hiring\" process. This allowed PBA teams like Talk 'N Text and Tanduay to negotiate directly with MBA players or MBA prospects (like Asi Taulava and Sonny Alvarado) for their services.\nThe league then folded on July 26, 2002, due to the high expenses in funding a regional basketball league, with ABS-CBN also withdrawing the funding for the league. Several players went to the semi-professional Philippine Basketball League en route to the PBA.\nFormat.\nThe MBA had a format similar to that of North America's National Basketball Association (NBA). The teams were divided into two conferences: the Northern Conference composed of Luzon-based teams, and the Southern Conference composed of Visayas- and Mindanao-based teams. The season concluded with the MBA National Finals, where the champions of both conferences face off to determine the season champions.\nAfter the league adapted a semi-commercial format, in which teams are sponsored by companies, several methods were used to in determining the champion. In their final season, they have adapted a three-conference format, similar with the PBA.\nRules.\nThe MBA had a set of its unique rules compared to the PBA:\nMBA Champions.\nTeams in bold won the MBA National Championship."

        "text": "The 1997 NBA Finals was the concluding series of the 1997 NBA playoffs that determined the champion of the 1996–97 NBA season. The Western Conference champion Utah Jazz took on the defending NBA champion and Eastern Conference champion Chicago Bulls for the title, with the Bulls holding home court advantage. The series were played under a best-of-seven format, with the first 2 games in Chicago, the next 3 games in Salt Lake City, and the last 2 games in Chicago.\nThe Bulls won the series 4 games to 2. For the fifth time in as many Finals appearances, Michael Jordan was named NBA Finals MVP.\nThe Bulls and Jazz won a combined 133 regular season games, second most in Finals history. Until 2016, the 1997 NBA Finals was the last to feature teams that won a total of at least 130 regular season games.\nBackground.\nChicago Bulls.\nFor the Chicago Bulls, the campaign was almost identical to their record-breaking 1995–96 season. They began the season 12–0, and by the All-Star break, were 42–6, putting them on pace to win 70 games for a second year in a row. But some late-season injuries and poor play, including Scottie Pippen's failed attempt at a game-winning three-pointer in the Bulls' final regular season game against the New York Knicks, denied them another 70-win season, and the Bulls settled for a league-best 69–13 record. This tied the 1971–72 Los Angeles Lakers for the third-best regular season, only behind the 1995–96 Bulls (72–10) and the 2015–16 Golden State Warriors (73–9).\nIn the playoffs, the Bulls swept the Washington Bullets in the first round, dispatched the Atlanta Hawks in five games in the second round, then defeated the Miami Heat in five games in the Eastern Conference Finals.\nUtah Jazz.\nThe Jazz emerged as a force in the Western Conference during the 1990s, powered by its All-Star duo of point guard John Stockton and power forward Karl Malone. They advanced to the Western Conference Finals three times between 1992 and 1996, (1992, 1994 and 1996), but lost on each occasion.\nHowever, a different story was written for the 1996–97 season. Powered by league MVP Karl Malone, along with the talented John Stockton, the Jazz finally asserted themselves atop the Western Conference, finishing with a franchise-record 64 wins.\nIn the playoffs, Utah swept the Los Angeles Clippers in the opening round and eliminated the Los Angeles Lakers in five games in the second round. Then, with John Stockton's buzzer-beating, three-point shot in Game 6 of the Western Conference Finals, eliminated the Houston Rockets to advance to their first NBA Finals in franchise history.\nRegular season series.\nBoth teams split the two meetings, each won by the home team:\nSeries summary.\nThe Finals were played using a 2–3–2 site format, where the first two and last two games are held at the team with home court advantage's (Chicago's) home court (United Center).\nHad the Western Conference Finals between the Jazz and the Houston Rockets reached a game 7, the Finals would have started on Wednesday, June 4 and followed the similar Wednesday-Friday-Sunday rotation.\nGame 1.\nDespite injuring his foot in the Eastern Conference Finals against Miami, Scottie Pippen helped the Bulls to an 84–82 victory over Utah on Sunday. He scored 27 points while Jordan scored 31. The Bulls trailed by one in the 4th, yet were able to grab an 81–79 lead after Pippen blocked Antoine Carr, then made his third 3-pointer with 1:11 remaining. However, John Stockton answered with a 3 of his own with 51.7 seconds left to give Utah an 82–81 lead. Michael Jordan made 1 of 2 free throws with 35.8 seconds left to tie it at 82. Then, Karl Malone was fouled by Rodman with 9.2 seconds left and had a chance to give Utah the lead. Scottie famously psyched him out, saying, \"Just remember, the mailman doesn't deliver on Sundays, Karl\", before he stepped up to the line. He missed them both. Jordan got the rebound and quickly called a time-out with 7.5 seconds left. With the game on the line, the Bulls put the ball in Jordan's hands. He dribbled out most of the waning seconds, then launched a 20-footer (game-winning shot) that went in at the buzzer to give Chicago a 1–0 series lead, after which he pumped his fist in triumph. The fist-pumping often draws comparisons to another famous Jordan reaction to a buzzer-beater, when he leaped into the air after hitting The Shot that eliminated the Cleveland Cavaliers in Game 5 of the 1989 Eastern Conference quarterfinals.\nGame 2.\nThe Bulls simply dominated Game 2. After a hard-fought first quarter, the Bulls took control of the game with a 12–0 second-quarter run. Utah's 31 points in the first half was only one point above an NBA low. Karl Malone, who missed those two key free throws in Game 1, had another bad night, making only 6 of 20 field goals. Dennis Rodman nailed a late 3-pointer to put the Bulls up 97–85.\nGame 3.\nUtah's fans welcomed their proud Western Conference champs with force. During the introductions of the Jazz's starting lineups, the Bulls players plugged their ears, due to the loud cheers and fireworks within the Delta Center. The Chicago Bulls started off the first three quarters with mediocre play, despite Scottie Pippen tying a then-Finals record with seven 3-pointers. Utah was led by Karl Malone, who scored 37 points and had 10 rebounds. Chicago attempted a 4th-quarter comeback, cutting a 24-point deficit down to 7, but Utah ultimately won its first game of the series. With the Bulls trailing by 18 points in the second quarter, Michael Jordan threw down an alley-oop slam which drew loud boos from the crowd. Dennis Rodman defended his poor performance in Game 3 with a vulgar remark denigrating Mormons and was fined a then record $50,000 for this remark and CKE Restaurants dropped his television commercials permanently. He apologized, claiming he was not aware that Mormon referred to a religion and intended his remark at obnoxious Jazz fans.\nGame 4.\nDue to the extremely loud Jazz fans in Game 3, Bulls coach Phil Jackson wore a pair of ear plugs. A tight game with many lead changes throughout, the Jazz led by 5 after the first quarter, but trailed by 5 at halftime. The score was tied going into the fourth quarter. Late in the game, Michael Jordan made a fast break dunk to give the Bulls a 71–66 lead, but John Stockton made a momentum-shifting 3 at the top of the key to cut the deficit to 71–69. Jordan made a jumper to give the Bulls a 73–69 lead, but the Bulls would not score again. The Jazz pulled to within 1 when Stockton stole the ball from Jordan and made 2 free throws at the other end. On the next possession John Stockton grabbed a rebound from a Jordan miss and threw a full-court pass to Karl Malone for a layup with 44.5 seconds left that put Utah in front for good, 74–73. After Stockton made the assist, he jumped up into the air several times pumping his fist. After some Bulls misses, Karl Malone made two free throws with 17 seconds left to put the Jazz up by 3. On the next possession, Michael Jordan's potential game-tying 3 with less than 10 seconds left rattled out; Stockton grabbed the rebound and threw another full-court pass to Bryon Russell, who escaped the intentional foul and dunked with 5 seconds left in the game to seal it, drawing a huge roar from the crowd. The Jazz's 12–2 run tied the series at two games apiece. The Delta Center grew so loud that during the final moments of the game when Bryon Russell made the dunk that iced the game, Marv Albert was unable to be clearly heard. The 78–73 score was one of the lowest scores in NBA Finals history.\nGame 5.\n \nGame 5, known by its misnomer as \"The Flu Game\", was one of Michael Jordan's most memorable games. At 2:30 a.m. on Tuesday morning, Jordan woke up and began to experience vomiting and diarrhea, and called his personal trainer to his hotel room at a Marriott, where he was found lying curled up in the fetal position, shaking, and sweating profusely. He hardly had the strength to sit up in bed and requested a doctor. He was diagnosed with a stomach virus or food poisoning, likely caused by a pizza ordered the night before. Jordan eventually claimed it was food poisoning in the 2020 docuseries \"The Last Dance\". The Bulls' athletic trainers told Jordan that there was no way he could play the next day, but Jordan insisted that he play. The Jazz were a perfect 10–0 at home in the postseason up until that point, and a third consecutive win would give them the series lead. The Bulls needed their leader for this critical game, and despite his sickness, Jordan got out of bed at 5:50 p.m. on Wednesday, just in time for the 7 o'clock tip-off at the Delta Center.\nJordan was weak as he stepped on the court for Game 5, and missed team warmups. At first, he displayed little energy, and John Stockton, along with reigning MVP Karl Malone, led the Jazz to a 16-point lead (36–20) in the second quarter. But Jordan slowly began to make shots despite lacking his usual speed. He scored 17 points in the quarter as the Bulls ended the half with a large run cutting the Jazz lead to four (53–49). While Jordan was fatigued in the third and sitting on the bench, Utah was able to reclaim the lead and stretched it to 8 points (77–69). Jordan shot well again in the fourth quarter, scoring 15 points. With 46.4 seconds left and Chicago down 85–84, he was fouled and went to the free throw line. He made the first to tie the game, but missed the second. Toni Kukoč got the offensive rebound to Jordan, who dribbled back to allow the offense to set up. He passed the ball to Pippen, who was quickly double-teamed. Pippen then passed the ball back to a now-unguarded Jordan, who made a 3-point shot to give the Bulls an 88–85 lead with 25 seconds remaining in the game. A Greg Ostertag dunk brought the Jazz back within one point, but Luc Longley answered with a dunk of his own, and Chicago held on for a victory when John Stockton missed the first of two free throws in front of the stunned crowd. With only a few seconds remaining and the game's result safely in Chicago's favor, Jordan collapsed into Scottie Pippen's arms, creating an iconic image that has come to symbolize The Flu Game.\nMalone was the high-scorer for the Jazz with 19 points but shot poorly during the game, air-balling an off-balance shot on the possession prior to Jordan's 3-pointer. Malone finished the second half 1-for-6 from the field. Jordan played 44 minutes, finishing the game with 38 points, 7 rebounds, 5 assists, 3 steals and 1 block.\nGame 6.\nMichael Jordan hadn't fully recovered from his illness, but he was feeling much better and led the Bulls with 39 points. Chicago struggled in the first half, scoring just 37 points and making only 9 of 27 field goals. With the Bulls struggling in the third quarter, Jordan dunked after a steal, bringing the crowd to its feet and Jud Buechler buried a 3 to help give the Bulls the momentum. The Bulls trailed by 9 early in the fourth quarter, but went on a 10–0 run to take their first lead since the opening minutes when Steve Kerr hit a 3-pointer, but the Jazz regained the lead and the game remained one possession until the final score. In the final minutes, Jordan's fadeaway jumper extended the Bulls lead to 3, before Bryon Russell hit a 3-pointer with 1:44 left to tie the game at 86. The two teams failed to score on their next possessions. Shandon Anderson then missed a reverse layup. The Jazz argued that this was due to Pippen grabbing the rim before the shot, causing the basketball standard to shake. However, the officials ruled that the ball had no chance of going in. Dennis Rodman grabbed the rebound and called time-out with 28 seconds left in a tie game. The Jazz expected Jordan to take the final shot. Instead, Jordan drew a double-team, then passed to a wide-open Steve Kerr, who hit a 17-footer with 5 seconds left to send the United Center into a frenzy. The Jazz looked for a final shot to stay alive, but Scottie Pippen made a significant defensive play as he knocked away Bryon Russell's inbound pass intended for Shandon Anderson and rolled the ball over to Toni Kukoč, who dunked the final 2 points of the game before the roaring crowd to bring the Finals to an end, despite there being 0.6 seconds left in the game. Jordan finished with 39 points to go along with 11 rebounds and four assists, and he was named Finals MVP for the 5th time. This would also be the last United Center championship celebration until the NHL's Chicago Blackhawks beat the Tampa Bay Lightning to win the 2015 Stanley Cup.\nBroadcasting.\nMarv Albert was the play-by-play announcer for his seventh straight NBA Finals for the \"NBA on NBC\". It was his third straight NBA Finals working with color analysts Matt Guokas and Bill Walton. This would be the last NBA Finals that Albert would announce in the 1990s because of a sex scandal that would force NBC Sports to fire him later in 1997.\nDuring these NBA Finals, NBC Sports' Hannah Storm became the first woman to serve as pre-game host of an NBA Finals. She would continue in this role for the next three NBA Finals.\nNBC Sports also used Ahmad Rashad (Bulls sideline) and Jim Gray (Jazz sideline) as the sideline reporters.\nThis would be the only NBA Finals on NBC during the 1990s that would not include Bob Costas in any capacity. He had served as the pre-game host from 1991 to 1996. The next year, during the 1998 NBA Finals, Costas served as the play-by-play announcer, a role in which he would continue until after the 2000 NBA Finals.\nAftermath.\nBoth teams met again in the Finals in 1998, the first time the same two teams met in the NBA Finals since 1989, when the Lakers and Pistons went up against each other. Only this time, the Jazz had home-court advantage. The Bulls won that series in 6 games, highlighted by Michael Jordan's last shot as a Bull in Game 6."

        "title": "1999 NBA Finals",
        "text": "The 1999 NBA Finals was the championship round of the shortened 1998–99 NBA season, and the conclusion of the season's playoffs. The Western Conference champion San Antonio Spurs took on the Eastern Conference champion New York Knicks for the title, with the Spurs holding home court advantage. The Spurs defeated the Knicks 4 games to 1 to win their first NBA championship. Until 2023, this was the only NBA Finals to feature a #8 seed.\nBackground.\nThe 1998-1999 NBA season was shortened due to a labor dispute that led to a lockout. The owners and the National Basketball Players Association reached an agreement to end the dispute on January 20, 1999. The 1998–99 season, which began on February 5, 1999, was shortened from the usual 82-game schedule to 50 games per team.\nSan Antonio Spurs.\nThe 1998–99 season was the second season of the \"Twin Towers\" pairing of David Robinson and star second-year forward Tim Duncan. Robinson and Duncan had been teammates since the Spurs drafted Duncan with the first overall pick in the 1997 NBA draft. The Spurs earned this draft pick through the draft lottery due to a 62-loss 1996–97 season in which Robinson had a season-ending injury and the team collapsed. During the 1996–97 season, veteran coach Bob Hill was fired and replaced by then-general manager Gregg Popovich. In the 1997–98 season, the Spurs won 56 games, but were eliminated in the second round of the playoffs by the Utah Jazz.\nIn the 1998–99 season, the Spurs recovered from a 6–8 start to the season to win 31 of their last 36 games. The Spurs qualified for the playoffs as the top seed in the Western Conference and tied the Utah Jazz for the league's best regular-season record (37-13).\nAfter defeating the Minnesota Timberwolves in four games, San Antonio recorded back-to-back sweeps in the second round and the conference finals, defeating the Los Angeles Lakers and Portland Trail Blazers. The victory over Portland gave the Spurs their first-ever trip to the NBA Finals.\nNew York Knicks.\nThe Knicks had a more difficult time reaching the playoffs than the Spurs did. Toward the end of the season, with the team teetering on the brink of making the playoffs, New York fired general manager Ernie Grunfeld. The Knicks barely qualified for the playoffs and received the eighth and final seed in the Eastern Conference.\nThe Knicks faced the Miami Heat, the top Eastern Conference seed, in the first round. When Allan Houston made a shot with 0.8 seconds remaining in Game 5 of that series, the Knicks were victorious and became the second team in NBA history after the 1993-94 Denver Nuggets to win a playoff series as the eighth seed.\nThe Knicks faced the Atlanta Hawks next. Hawks center Dikembe Mutombo guaranteed a victory, but the Knicks prevailed in a four-game sweep to set up a matchup with the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals.\nKnicks center Patrick Ewing was lost for the series after the first two games against Indiana. In the third game, with 11.9 seconds left and the Knicks trailing 91–88, the Knicks' Larry Johnson made a three-point shot while being fouled and converted the subsequent free throw for a game-winning four-point play; the victory gave the Knicks a 2–1 lead in the series. The Knicks won Game 6 and prevailed in the series.\nRegular season series.\nThe Knicks and Spurs did not play each other in the regular season.\nSeries summary.\nThe Finals were played using a 2–3–2 site format, where the first two and last two games are held at the team with home court advantage. The NBA, after experimenting in the early years, restored this original format for the Finals between 1985 and 2013. In 2014, the Finals returned to a 2–2–1–1–1 site format.\nResult.\nThe Spurs won the NBA Finals 4 games to 1. Spurs forward Tim Duncan was named the Most Valuable Player of the finals. On June 25 (two years to the day that Duncan was drafted by the Spurs), with 47 seconds to go in Game 5, Avery Johnson hit the game-winner. The Knicks scored 39 points in the second half, and Sprewell scored 25 of them, with fourteen of his points coming in the fourth quarter. However, he could not hit either of his couple of jump shots in the last half-minute of the game that could have affected the outcome. Tim Duncan scored 31 points and nine rebounds in the decisive Game 5 while averaging 27.4 points and fourteen rebounds with 2.4 assists and 2.2 blocks in the Finals.\nBroadcasting.\nThe 1999 NBA Finals was aired in the United States on NBC, with Bob Costas and Doug Collins on play-by-play and color commentary respectively. Hannah Storm served as the studio host while Isiah Thomas, Bill Walton and Peter Vecsey served as studio analysts. Ahmad Rashad and Jim Gray served as sideline reporters.\nLocally, the Finals also marked the comeback of Marv Albert following his infamous sex scandal two years prior. Albert served as the Knicks' radio play-by-play announcer on WFAN with long-time partner John Andariese. NBC Sports rehired Albert shortly after and he eventually returned to the lead play-by-play role in 2000.\nAftermath.\nIn 2000, the Spurs became the first NBA champion since the 1985–86 Celtics to fail to win a second consecutive title. The Spurs won 53 games in the 1999–2000 season, but were severely impaired by Sean Elliott's early season kidney transplant and Tim Duncan's late-season knee injury. The Spurs were eliminated in the first round of the 2000 NBA Playoffs by the Phoenix Suns. The team went on to win NBA titles in 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2014.\n, the 1999 NBA Finals remains the Knicks' last NBA Finals appearance. The following season, the Knicks won 50 games but fell to the Indiana Pacers in six games in the Eastern Conference Finals. After that season, the Patrick Ewing era came to an end when he was traded to the Seattle SuperSonics.\nThe next No. 8 seed to make the NBA Finals was the Miami Heat in . The result was the same, with the Heat losing to the Denver Nuggets in five games."

        "title": "2003 NBA Finals",
        "text": "The 2003 NBA Finals was the championship round of the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s 2002–03 season, and the culmination of the playoffs. The Western Conference champion San Antonio Spurs played the Eastern Conference champion New Jersey Nets for the title, with the Spurs holding home court advantage. The series was played under a best-of-seven format. The Spurs defeated the Nets to win the series 4–2 for their second championship. Spurs forward Tim Duncan was named the Most Valuable Player of the championship series. The series was broadcast on U.S. television on ABC, with Brad Nessler, Bill Walton and Tom Tolbert announcing.\nThe 2003 Finals documentary was narrated by Rodd Houston, who later narrated three other NBA Finals series.\nBackground.\nThe 2002–03 season had already started as a memorable one for the San Antonio Spurs, as it was the team's first season in their new arena, the SBC Center. However, as this season was one of beginnings, it was also one of endings. During the season, Spurs star David Robinson announced that it was his last season. The NBA Finals also marked the end of Steve Kerr's career as well—he was on the Spurs, having already won three titles with the Chicago Bulls.\nOver the last few seasons, injuries had slowed down Robinson's productivity to the point where he missed 18 games in his final season while averaging only 8.5 points per game. Nevertheless, Robinson retired holding Spurs franchise records in points, rebounds, steals and blocks. The Spurs had a very successful season, finishing 60–22, tying for the best record in the NBA that year.\nThe playoffs started off shaky for the Spurs as they lost game 1 of the first-round series against the Phoenix Suns in overtime. However, the Spurs bounced back to take the series in six games. The second round put the Spurs face-to-face with the three-time defending champion Los Angeles Lakers. After splitting the first four games, the Spurs eked out a win in game 5, benefitting from a rare, last-second in-and-out miss from the Lakers' clutch-shooter Robert Horry (who helped the Spurs win a title two years later). The Spurs eventually disposed of the Lakers in game 6, ending the Lakers' championship run. In the Conference Finals, the Spurs faced their in-state nemesis, the Dallas Mavericks. The Spurs started off slow again, losing game 1 by three points, but took control of the series from there, taking the next three straight. After losing game 5 at home 103–91, the Spurs came from 15 points down in the fourth quarter in game 6, as Steve Kerr buried four three-pointers in a row to take the series in six games with a 90–78 win in Dallas, advancing to their second NBA Finals in franchise history.\nIn the meantime the New Jersey Nets, who lost to the Lakers in the finals the previous year, were out to prove that they were serious title contenders, despite the lack of competition in the Eastern Conference. The Nets finished the regular season 49–33, good enough to win the Atlantic Division and clinch the number 2 seed in the East. After splitting the first four games with the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round, the Nets took control, winning the series in six games. From then on, the Nets had no trouble making a return to the NBA Finals, sweeping the Boston Celtics and the Detroit Pistons to win their second straight Eastern Conference championship. With their 49–33 record, the 2003 Nets were the last team with under 50 wins to reach the NBA Finals in a fully-played season until the 2022-23 Miami Heat, who went 44–38 in the regular season.\nRegular season series.\nBoth teams split the two meetings, each won by the home team:\nSeries summary.\nThe Finals were played using a 2–3–2 site format, where the first two and last two games are held at the team with home court advantage. The NBA, after experimenting in the early years, restored this original format for the Finals in 1985. So far, the other playoff series are still running on a 2–2–1–1–1 site format.\nGame 4 at Continental Airlines Arena was a sellout.\nThis was the last Finals' series to be played on a Wednesday–Friday–Sunday rotation, which was used starting in 1991 when NBC began carrying the NBA. Starting with the 2004 NBA Finals, all games were played on Thursday–Sunday–Tuesday format until 2016, when it was changed to allow for two days off each time teams traveled.\nFeatures.\nWhile the series received the usual hype of any Finals, it was not heavily anticipated due to the absence of the Lakers, who had won the previous three finals. The Spurs did have a star in Tim Duncan, but at the time he was criticized as being boring compared to flashier players such as Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal.\nThe series largely centered on the half-court offense and defense of each team, with only one team breaking 100 points in the series. The Nets constantly double-teamed Duncan, often allowing him to find open teammates.\nNets point guard Jason Kidd, second to Duncan in MVP voting during the 2003 season, was in the last year of his contract with the team, leading to speculation that the Spurs, a team that could afford to sign him, would pursue him in the free agency following the 2003 Finals despite already having future All-Star Tony Parker on the roster. The underlying story of whether or not Kidd would be in a Spurs uniform the following season continued into the off-season. Kidd visited San Antonio and spoke with team officials, but ultimately re-signed with the Nets.\nPerhaps the lasting memory of the series is David Robinson retiring as a champion. In the clinching game 6, Robinson had 13 points and 17 rebounds to complement Duncan on the inside. In that game, the Spurs trailed at one point 72–63 before going on a 19–0 run to put the game away and take the series. Stephen Jackson's three-pointer during the run held the lead permanently. The Spurs' win denied New Jersey from having both NBA and NHL titles in the same year.\nDuncan became the 8th player in NBA history to win the Finals MVP award a second time. He joined the list of Willis Reed, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Michael Jordan, Hakeem Olajuwon and Shaquille O'Neal. In the series-clinching game, Duncan came two blocks shy of a quadruple double in an NBA Finals game, an extremely rare feat, finishing with 21 points, 20 rebounds, 10 assists and 8 blocks. Robinson recorded the last quadruple double in NBA history with the Spurs. Duncan and Robinson grabbed 37 rebounds between them, more than the total rebounds of the entire Nets team combined (35).\nSteve Kerr joined Dennis Johnson, Bill Walton, Dennis Rodman, Ron Harper and Robert Horry as the only players to win at least two championships with two franchises. Kerr won three with the Chicago Bulls (1996–98) and another with the Spurs in 1999. Robert Horry won two with the Houston Rockets (1994–95) and three with the LA Lakers (2000–02), and later went on to win two more with the Spurs in 2005 and 2007.\nAftermath.\nThe Nets had an inconsistent start to the 2003–04 NBA season, and with a 22–20 record early in the season they fired head coach Byron Scott. Lawrence Frank took over and led the Nets to another Atlantic Division title by winning 47 games, highlighted by a 13–0 start, the best start for a rookie head coach in sports history. Despite that, however, the Nets lost to the eventual NBA champion Detroit Pistons in seven games of the conference semifinals. , the 2003 Finals remain the Nets' most recent Finals appearance and is their last in New Jersey. The franchise moved to Brooklyn, New York prior to the 2012–13 season. The Nets have also not made the Conference Finals since 2003, having lost five times in the Semifinals, with the last being in 2021.\nJason Kidd remained with the Nets until he was traded in February 2008 to the team he was originally drafted to, the Dallas Mavericks. Kidd, along with teammate Dirk Nowitzki, led the Mavericks to the NBA title in 2011. Kenyon Martin was sent to the Denver Nuggets after the 2003–04 season, while Richard Jefferson eventually joined the Spurs in the 2009–10 season, after a one-year stint with the Milwaukee Bucks. He later won a championship with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2016.\nDespite the departures of Robinson, Jackson and Kerr, the Spurs still managed to win 57 games, aided by Tim Duncan's strong play. However, they were ousted in six games by the Los Angeles Lakers, highlighted by Derek Fisher's game-winner with 0.4 seconds left in game 5 of the conference semifinals. In the years following Robinson's retirement, Duncan led the Spurs to three more NBA titles in 2005, 2007 and 2014.\nTelevision coverage.\nThe 2003 NBA Finals was the first to be aired on ABC, taking over after a 12-year run on NBC. As part of ESPN’s new media deal with the NBA, ABC's telecasts were produced by ESPN. Until 2007, it was the lowest-rated finals in NBA history.\nThis was also the only year that ABC broadcast both the NBA and the Stanley Cup Finals that involved teams playing in the same arena during each series. During ABC's broadcast of game 3, Brad Nessler stated that ABC was in a unique situation getting ready for both that game and game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals between the Devils and the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim the following night. Gary Thorne, ESPN/ABC's lead NHL voice, mentioned this the following night and thanked Nessler for promoting ABC's broadcast of game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals.\nThis was the only NBA Finals worked by Nessler and Tolbert, while this was Walton's last Finals assignment. All three were demoted from ABC's lead role after the Finals. Though Nessler remained the lead voice for ESPN's NBA broadcasts for another season, his position at ABC was relegated to a backup role after the network convinced Al Michaels of \"Monday Night Football\" fame to take over the lead position. Michaels was later joined by recently deposed Orlando Magic coach Doc Rivers on ABC's lead team."

        "title": "1994 NBA Finals",
        "text": "The 1994 NBA Finals was the championship round of the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s 1993–94 season, and the culmination of the season's playoffs. The Western Conference champion Houston Rockets played the Eastern Conference champion New York Knicks for the championship, with the Rockets holding home-court advantage in the best-of-seven series. The Rockets defeated the Knicks 4 games to 3 to win the team's first NBA championship.\nThis matchup was Hakeem Olajuwon's second NBA Finals appearance, his other being in 1986, when Larry Bird and the Boston Celtics defeated the Rockets, four games to two. The series was Patrick Ewing's first NBA Finals appearance. The Rockets came in with strong determination to win not only the franchise's first NBA championship, but the city's first championship in a league that still existed. The Knicks, who had been recently acquired by Viacom when it bought Paramount Communications (formerly Gulf+Western), were looking to win their third NBA championship and first since .\nThe series was hailed as a meeting of the two great centers who had previously played for a championship in college. In 1984, while Olajuwon was with the University of Houston and Ewing was with Georgetown University, Georgetown beat Houston 84–75 in the 1984 NCAA Championship game. But in this series, Olajuwon outperformed Ewing, outscoring him in every game of the series and posting numbers of 26.9 ppg on 50.0% shooting compared to Ewing's 18.9 ppg on 36.3% shooting. However, Ewing set an NBA finals record in the series with a total of 30 blocks, and tied the single-game record of 8 blocks in Game 5. Tim Duncan later set the record for most blocks in a Finals series () with 32 blocks in six games, while Dwight Howard set the record for most blocked shots in a Finals game with 9 blocked shots in Game 4 of the 2009 Finals with the Orlando Magic.\nDuring the series, the Rockets played seven low-scoring, defensive games against the Knicks. After splitting the first two games in Houston, the Knicks won two out of three games at Madison Square Garden. In Game 6, Olajuwon blocked a last-second three-point shot attempt by John Starks that would have given the Knicks their third NBA title, instead giving the Rockets an 86–84 victory and forcing a Game 7, which made Knicks Coach Pat Riley the first (and to this date, the only) coach in a Game 7 NBA Finals on two teams, having been with the Los Angeles Lakers in and . In addition, the Knicks set a record for most playoff games played in one season, with 25. The Detroit Pistons tied this record in . The Boston Celtics, coached by Doc Rivers, surpassed it during their championship season when they played 26.\nThe Rockets beat the Knicks in Game 7, 90–84, enabling the city of Houston to celebrate its first NBA and fifth professional sports championship (first in an existing league). For his efforts, Olajuwon was named NBA Finals Most Valuable Player. Riley had the unfortunate distinction of becoming the first (and to date, the only) coach to lose a Game 7 NBA Finals on two teams, having lost to the Celtics in 1984. It also denied him the distinction of being the first coach to win a Game 7 NBA Finals with two teams, having defeated the Detroit Pistons in 1988.\nIt was the first championship series since 1990 without the Chicago Bulls.\nNBC Sports used Ahmad Rashad (Knicks sideline) and Hannah Storm (Rockets sideline). Marv Albert and Matt Guokas called the action.\nBackground.\nHouston Rockets.\nThe Rockets chose Hakeem Olajuwon as the first overall pick in the 1984 NBA draft. Olajuwon's first nine NBA seasons included numerous All-Star, All-NBA and All-Defensive selections, but the closest he got to a championship was in , when the Rockets fell two games short of a title against a powerful Boston Celtics team.\nBy his tenth season, Olajuwon became a more complete player, and he led the Rockets to a 15–0 start en route to a 58–24 record. But after a four-game defeat of the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round, they blew a pair of big fourth-quarter leads at home and lost to the Phoenix Suns to begin the second round (in the process earning the derisive nickname \"Choke City\" from the \"Houston Chronicle\").\nIn response, the Rockets used the headline as motivation, overcoming a 0–2 deficit to defeat the Suns in seven games (earning the nickname '\"Clutch City\"). In the conference finals, Houston defeated the Utah Jazz in five games to claim their third conference title. Olajuwon won the MVP and Defensive Player of the Year awards at season's end.\nNew York Knicks.\nLike Olajuwon, Patrick Ewing was a first overall pick of the NBA draft. Ewing was picked by the Knicks in the 1985 draft, and won Rookie of the Year that season. But despite earning All-Star accolades of his own, the Knicks teams he played with only made it past the first round twice during his first six seasons (in 1989 and 1990).\nIn the 1991 off-season, the Knicks hired Pat Riley as head coach. In contrast to the fast-paced style of Showtime he used with the Los Angeles Lakers, Riley took a more deliberate and physical approach in New York. Aided by the likes of Charles Oakley, Anthony Mason, John Starks and Charles Smith, Ewing and the Knicks rose to prominence under Riley, and in 1994, they won 57 games to finish second in the Eastern Conference.\nTheir playoff run began with a 3–1 victory over their cross-river rival New Jersey Nets. They had a hard time disposing of a Chicago Bulls team that had lost Michael Jordan to retirement (which lasted until the final months of the following season), but managed to win all four home games to advance. In the conference finals, they were pitted against the upstart Indiana Pacers, led by Reggie Miller. The Pacers gave the Knicks a scare, but the latter's experience proved too much as they won the series in seven games.\nRegular season series.\nThe Houston Rockets won both games in the regular season series:\nOlajuwon vs. Ewing.\nAlthough most fans in New York, and some members of the national media, considered John Starks, who shot 2-for-18 from the field in Game 7, a contributing factor in the Knicks' loss in the series, another important factor was Olajuwon's performance. Olajuwon outscored Ewing in every game of the series, while Ewing outblocked (4.3 to 3.9 bpg) and outrebounded him (12.4 rpg to 9.1 rpg). Ewing set a then NBA Finals record with a total of 30 blocks.\nBreaking news interruption.\nDuring Game 5, most NBC affiliates split the coverage of the game between NFL Hall of Famer O. J. Simpson's slow speed freeway chase with the Los Angeles Police Department. At the time, Simpson was an NFL analyst on NBC.\nNBA studio host Bob Costas acted as the anchor for both events, tossing to Marv Albert for the game and then to Tom Brokaw of NBC News for updates on the chase. Costas, a colleague of Simpson's on the network's NFL coverage, later learned that Simpson had called 30 Rockefeller Plaza during the chase and asked to speak to him but Costas had been on site at the Garden.\nKNBC in Los Angeles, serving the media market where the police were tracking Simpson, left the Game 5 broadcast completely for the chase with local coverage narrated by Paul Moyer and Colleen Williams; the station did not put up a split screen until the end of the game, which was still close. By that point, Simpson had returned to his mansion in Brentwood and surrendered to police.\nA complete re-broadcast of Game 5, with natural crowd audio substituting for the parts for which NBC did not provide audio, is part of the DVD release of this series from Warner Home Video.\nAftermath.\nThe Rockets repeated as NBA champions in 1995 although their season record was worse. Plagued by a lack of chemistry, the Rockets were stuck in the middle of the conference standings most of the year. Then, as the NBA's trading deadline approached, on February 14, 1995, the Rockets acquired Olajuwon's \"Phi Slama Jama\" teammate Clyde Drexler. The Rockets finished the regular season as the 6th seed but the team on the court at season's end was clearly better than its 47–35 record. The new Rockets team had only had about two months to gel. The playoffs started rough for Houston, the team down 2 games to 1 to Utah in the First Round. But the Rockets battled back and won that series, stealing the deciding Game 5 in Utah. The Rockets' ability to overcome adversity became more evident as the postseason wore on. They beat four 50-win squads (Utah, Phoenix, San Antonio and Orlando) to win the championship, becoming the lowest seed ever to win it all.\nDuring the Finals, Viacom stepped up in trying to sell their Madison Square Garden properties, which included the Knicks and the New York Rangers. In August 1994, Viacom sold the Knicks to Cablevision Systems and the ITT Corporation (the latter sold its shares years later). Also in 1995, the Knicks enjoyed another strong season, with 55 wins, but were eliminated in seven games by the Indiana Pacers during the second round as Pacers guard Reggie Miller's \"Knick Killer\" legacy continued. After the season, Pat Riley left the Knicks after they balked at his request for a stake in ownership and the role of team president in negotiations for an extension. He departed for the Miami Heat, with whom he won three championships, one as head coach and two as president. The Knicks made the NBA Finals again in 1999 as the first eighth seed to make the Finals, but fell to the Spurs in five games, and have not returned since.\nBefore this victory, the Houston Oilers' AFL two championships at the close of the 1960 season and 1961 season and the Houston Aeros' two WHA Avco World Trophies in 1974 and 1975 represented Houston's only professional championships. The 1994 NBA Championship represented the city of Houston's first professional championship since those two teams, and the first in a league that did not later merge.\nThis was the last NBA Finals for three of the league's longest-tenured and most recognizable referees: Darell Garretson, Jack Madden and Jake O'Donnell. Garretson and Madden retired after the 1994 Finals, while O'Donnell worked the 1994-95 season, but did not work past the second round of the playoffs, marking the first time since 1971 he did not officiate in the championship series. O'Donnell retired in December 1995 following the end of a lockout of NBA referees by Commissioner David Stern.\nOverall, as of 2019, Houston's teams in the \"Big Four\" major professional sports are 6–1 over their New York City counterparts in playoff series. The Rockets, in addition to their 1994 triumph, also defeated the Knicks in the 1975 Eastern Conference First Round. The NFL's Houston Oilers (now Tennessee Titans) followed with a victory over the New York Jets in the 1991 AFC wild card round, and the Houston Astros later prevailed over the New York Yankees in three MLB postseason series during the 2010s (the 2015 ALWC, 2017 ALCS, and 2019 ALCS). The only New York-based team that prevailed over Houston was the New York Mets, who won over the then-NL member Astros in the NLCS in their championship season."

        "title": "2002 NBA Finals",
        "text": "The 2002 NBA Finals was the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s championship series for the 2001–02 season. The best-of-seven playoff was contested between the Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers (who were also two-time defending NBA champions), and the Eastern Conference champion New Jersey Nets. The Lakers swept the Nets, four games to none, to win the franchise's 14th NBA championship and third consecutive NBA championship. The 56th edition of the championship series was played between June 5 and 12 and was broadcast on NBC — the last NBA games broadcast on the network to date. Lakers coach Phil Jackson won his ninth ring, tying him with Red Auerbach for most all-time. During the series, he surpassed Pat Riley for most career playoffs wins with 156. Shaquille O'Neal of the Lakers was named the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) for the third consecutive year, after averaging 36.3 points, 12.3 rebounds and 2.8 blocks per game.\nBackground.\nRegular season series.\nThe Los Angeles Lakers and New Jersey Nets split both games in the regular season, each winning on their home court. \nNew Jersey Nets.\nEntering the 2001–02 season, the New Jersey Nets were enduring a three-year playoff drought and had a 73–141 record over that span. In 1999, the Nets hired Rod Thorn as team president and immediately, he hired the recently retired Byron Scott to coach New Jersey. Thorn then dealt for Stephon Marbury in a three-team trade with the Milwaukee Bucks and Minnesota Timberwolves, trading Sam Cassell away to the Bucks. Due to the Nets' 31–51 season in 1999–2000 season, they had the first overall pick in the 2000 NBA draft, which they used to select power forward Kenyon Martin out of the University of Cincinnati. Despite the reshuffling of the roster and an NBA All-Rookie Team season for Martin, New Jersey struggled, ending the season with a 26–56 () record, and owned the 7th pick in the upcoming draft.\nWith another lottery pick, Thorn dealt it to the Houston Rockets for draftees Richard Jefferson, Jason Collins and Brandon Armstrong. The next day, Phoenix Suns owner Jerry Colangelo announced a franchise-shaking trade; Phoenix would swap their point guard Jason Kidd for his New Jersey counterpart Stephon Marbury.\nWith the Princeton offense installed from the coaching staff, the Nets rebounded to a 52–30 () mark, a twenty-six-win improvement from the last season, and clinched the number-one seed in the Eastern Conference. Kidd finished the season awarded with first team spots on both the All-NBA and All-Defensive Teams and was selected for his fifth All-Star game. He also finished runner-up to San Antonio Spurs power forward Tim Duncan in the Most Valuable Player voting. Richard Jefferson was an All-Rookie second team selection and Thorn, the architect of the franchise's resurgence, was awarded NBA Executive of the Year.\nIn the first round of the playoffs, New Jersey survived a scare against the Indiana Pacers, escaping game five in double overtime to advance. It was the Nets' first playoff series win since 1984. They then dismissed the Charlotte Hornets in five games before meeting their Atlantic Division rivals, the Boston Celtics, in the conference finals. The Nets and Celtics split the first two games in New Jersey before moving to Boston. In Game 3, the Nets were dominating the Celtics, leading by as much as 21 in the fourth quarter. However, Boston, led by small forward Paul Pierce, then proceeded to outscore New Jersey 41–16 in the final period, rallying to win 94 to 90. Pierce himself scored 19 points, more than the Nets combined in the fourth, to complete the greatest fourth-quarter comeback in NBA playoff history.\nThe Nets rebounded in a 94–92 Game 4 victory, that saw another Boston comeback, albeit one that fell short because Pierce missed crucial free throws late. New Jersey then took control of the series and won the next two games in large fashion to finish off Boston in six games, earning the franchise's first NBA Finals appearance and becoming the third former American Basketball Association (ABA) team to make the Finals (the Spurs and the Pacers being the first two). With averages of 17.5 points, 11.2 rebounds, and 10.2 assists per game during the six-game conference finals, Kidd become only the fourth player in NBA history to average a triple-double over a course of a series and the second to have at least three.\nLos Angeles Lakers.\nIn stark contrast to New Jersey, the Los Angeles Lakers entered the season with high expectations, having won the last two NBA championships. In addition, Los Angeles was coming off of a 15–1 ( winning percentage) run through the 2001 NBA Playoffs, the greatest in NBA history, besting the 1983 Philadelphia 76ers' 12–1 () run and were the first team to go undefeated on the road in the playoffs. Since Phil Jackson had arrived to coach the Lakers in 1999, they had a 123–41 mark in the regular season and a 28–9 record in the postseason.\nAmid tensions between co-captains Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, the franchise had another stellar season, finishing 58–24 (), good for second in the Pacific Division and earning the third seed in the Western Conference. Bryant and O'Neal were voted starters in the 2002 NBA All-Star Game, where Bryant won the game MVP trophy in his hometown Philadelphia. The duo appeared on the All-NBA First Team and Bryant was honored with a Second-Team All-Defensive Team selection.\nThe Lakers shot out to another quick start in the playoffs, finishing the Portland Trail Blazers in three games with a Robert Horry game-winner. The San Antonio Spurs were dispatched in five games before Los Angeles met their biggest challenge in the duration of their championship reign in the Western Conference finals: the Sacramento Kings. With the best record in the West, the Kings held home court advantage against the Lakers and split the first two games in ARCO Arena before the series shifted to Staples Center, where Sacramento blew out Los Angeles in Game 3 and led as much as 27 before settling with a 103–90 decision.\nGame 4 did not give the Lakers any more hope, as Sacramento led Los Angeles 40–20 at the end of the first quarter and held a lead as large as 26. But, the Lakers staged a furious second-half comeback to win 100–99, punctuated by Horry's buzzer-beating three-point shot. Back in Sacramento for Game 5, the Kings staged some late-game heroics of their own as Mike Bibby nailed a jumper with 8.2 seconds remaining, giving his team not only a 92–91 win, but a 3–2 series advantage.\nWith their season on the line, the Lakers returned home for Game 6. In a controversial contest, one in which the Lakers attempted 27 free throws in the fourth quarter to Sacramento's 9, O'Neal and Bryant had one of their most dominant performances as a duo. O'Neal recorded 41 points and 17 rebounds while Bryant contributed 31 points, 11 rebounds and 5 assists to force a Game 7 in ARCO Arena. The outrage was such that politician Ralph Nader demanded an investigation. In Game 7, the Lakers prevailed in overtime 112–106 to earn their third straight NBA Finals berth.\nGame summaries.\nGame 1.\nLos Angeles's Staples Center sold out for the inaugural game of the 2002 NBA Finals, with nearly 19,000 on hand. The Nets trotted out a lineup of Jason Kidd, Kerry Kittles, Kenyon Martin, Keith Van Horn, and Todd MacCulloch to hold up against the two-time defending and heavily favored champions. The Lakers brought out Derek Fisher, Rick Fox, Shaquille O'Neal, Robert Horry, and Kobe Bryant, who drew the assignment of guarding Kidd. New Jersey head coach Byron Scott, a member of the Showtime Lakers, received a standing ovation.\nTaking advantage of a late arrival to the arena by New Jersey, L.A. dominated the first 17 minutes of play with a 42–19 score by the 6:41 mark in the second quarter. From that point on, the Nets went on a 17–6 run to close the lead to a respectable 12. They had no answer for O'Neal, however, who had bullied MacCulloch into 16 points and 6 rebounds by half-time. The Nets outscored the Lakers in the third but stood steadfast as Bryant scored 11 of his 22 in the third.\nNew Jersey battled back, coming as close as three several times in the final quarter. Desperate to take the lead, they utilized the \"Hack-a-Shaq\" strategy midway in the fourth. It backfired, as O'Neal was 5–8 from the free throw line and had 16 points and 9 rebounds in the period alone.\nNew Jersey was doomed by their late start and poor shooting. The Nets, who shot 45% from the field and 74% on free throws were 39% and 57% respectively. Kidd finished with a triple-double, the 26th in Finals history and the first since Charles Barkley's in the 1993 series.\nMedia coverage.\nThe Finals were produced and televised in the United States by NBC. Marv Albert provided play-by-play calling. Basketball Hall of Famer Bill Walton and Steve \"Snapper\" Jones handled color duties. Jim Gray and Lewis Johnson roamed the sidelines for the Lakers and Nets respectively. Bob Costas hosted pregame and half-time shows with analyst Tom Tolbert. Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith, and Charles Barkley from TNT's Inside the NBA made special guest appearances during halftime of Game 1. Brent Musburger and Jack Ramsay called the four games on ESPN Radio. Hannah Storm hosted the post-game show.\nThe finals also had Spanish-language television and radio broadcasts in the United States.\nAs previously mentioned, this series was the last broadcast by NBC. In January 2002, the league's broadcast rights were awarded to ABC/ESPN in a six-year deal, which was renewed for an additional eight years in 2007.\nAt the conclusion of Game 4, NBC presented highlights of the twelve years of their NBA broadcasts; among them the Chicago Bulls' dynasty led by Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen, the retirements of Larry Bird and Magic Johnson and the Los Angeles Lakers' current Shaq/Kobe reign, as the credits rolled. NBC also played \"Winning It All\" by The Outfield, which they had used for the close of their NBA Finals broadcasts from 1992 to 1996. The last image displayed was of an empty gym, showing a basketball bouncing into the background, as \"To The Flemish Cap\" from the soundtrack to the film \"The Perfect Storm\" played. NBC ended the broadcast (and their 12-year run broadcasting NBA basketball) by displaying over the shot the message \"Thanks for the memories\".\nThe 2002 Finals was also Marv Albert's last NBA Finals assignment. After the series, Albert's national TV duties continued with TNT and remained with the network until his retirement in 2021, but only called games until the conference finals each season.\nWill Lyman narrated the season-ending documentary for NBA Entertainment.\n2002 NBA Finals Ratings\nImpact and aftermath.\nLakers.\nThe Lakers victory in this year's Finals would also mark the beginning of what would become a successful year for professional sports teams in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The nearby Anaheim Angels would later claim their first World Series championship four months later. It marked the second occurrence that a city/metropolitan area won both NBA and Major League Baseball championships in the same calendar year. The last time this occurred was in 1988, when the Lakers won that year's NBA Finals in June; the Dodgers followed suit with a World Series victory four months later. In relation to sports of smaller leagues, the Los Angeles Sparks won the WNBA Finals two months after the Lakers' 2002 Finals victory; the Los Angeles Galaxy won the MLS Cup exactly one week prior to the Angels' World Series victory in October. The successes of Los Angeles area teams led \"Sporting News\" magazine to declare Anaheim/Los Angeles as \"Best Sports City\" in 2003. , the Lakers are the last team to pull off a 'three-peat' in North American professional sports. No other team won a \"three-peat\" since this year's Finals. Since then, only two teams are close to doing so, the Miami Heat and the Golden State Warriors. Whereas the Heat, led by the Big Three of LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh, made four consecutive NBA Finals appearances since 2011, won back-to-back titles in 2012 and 2013 against different teams (Oklahoma City Thunder in 2012 and San Antonio Spurs in 2013), but lost in 2014 to the Spurs, the Warriors, led by the Splash Brothers (Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson), Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala, and Kevin Durant, won back-to-back titles in 2017 and 2018 against the Cleveland Cavaliers, but ended their 3-peat journey in 2019 as they fell to the Toronto Raptors in six games.\nThe Lakers were off to a slow start in the 2002–03 NBA season. By this time, the relationship between Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal began to show cracks. Injuries were also starting to slow the Lakers down. Nevertheless, the Lakers won 50 games, but would only earn the fifth seed, thereby not earning the home-court advantage. Still, the Lakers took down the fourth-seeded Minnesota Timberwolves in six games. However, they were eliminated by the San Antonio Spurs, who finally earned revenge after their previous two defeats to the Lakers in the 2001 and 2002 NBA playoffs. In Game 5, Robert Horry, a perennial clutch threat in the playoffs, missed a game-winning three that would've given the Lakers a 3-2 lead. The miss eventually led to Horry's free-agent defection to the Spurs the following season.\nNets.\nThe Nets made it back to the Finals in 2003. They won 49 games and the Atlantic Division title, and heading into the Finals they won ten straight games, two in the six-game first round win over the Milwaukee Bucks, and two four-game sweeps of the Boston Celtics and Detroit Pistons. However, they still came up short, losing in six games to the Spurs, in the first NBA finals series featuring former ABA teams."

        "text": "The 2000 NBA Finals was the championship round of the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s 1999–2000 season, and the conclusion of the season's playoffs. The Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Eastern Conference champion Indiana Pacers 4 games to 2. The series was played under a best-of-seven format, with the Lakers holding home court advantage. The series featured the number one seeds from both conferences. Lakers center Shaquille O'Neal was named the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the series, his first of three consecutive honors, in arguably one of the best NBA Finals performances in history putting up 38.0 points, 16.7 rebounds and 2.7 blocks per game.\nBackground.\nLos Angeles Lakers.\nAlthough the Lakers were one of the more talented teams in the NBA the previous year, they failed to win a single game against the San Antonio Spurs in the 1999 NBA playoffs. Twenty-four days after being swept by the eventual league champion, the Lakers signed Phil Jackson as head coach. Jackson, famous for coaching Michael Jordan and the six-time champion Chicago Bulls, would build his triangle offense around Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant. General Manager Jerry West surrounded O'Neal and Bryant with effective role players such as Glen Rice, Ron Harper (who had experience with Jackson's triangle offense as part of the 1996–1998 Bulls), and A.C. Green (member of the last two Lakers championship teams).\nAlong with these starters, the Lakers also possessed a strong bench. Robert Horry not only had championship experience with the Houston Rockets but also was a threat on the perimeter and a defensive star. Derek Fisher was a defensively minded point-guard with the ability to shoot well from long range. Rick Fox, acquired after being released by the Boston Celtics, was the Lakers' sixth man.\nWith a healthy O'Neal, the Lakers dominated the regular season. They posted a 33–7 record after 40 games, the second-best record after 40 games in franchise history, trailing only the 1971-72 Lakers who posted a record of 37-3 after 40 games. They posted winning streaks of 11, 16, and 19 en route to a 67–15 record, tying the 1992 Chicago Bulls and 1986 Boston Celtics as the fifth best record in NBA regular season history.\nAlthough many expected the Lakers to reach the Finals, the road would be a rocky one. In the first round, the Lakers won the first two games against the Sacramento Kings, only to drop the next two games in Sacramento. The Lakers then defeated Sacramento in Game 5, 113–86, to face the Phoenix Suns in the conference semifinals. The Lakers clobbered the Suns, winning the series 4–1 (with their only loss coming in Game 4). In Game 1 of the Western Conference Finals against the Portland Trail Blazers, Rasheed Wallace earned two technical fouls and was ejected; the Lakers took advantage of Wallace's absence and secured victory. The Trail Blazers stormed back in the next game, giving the Lakers their worst home loss of the season in a 106–77 shellacking. This setback did not affect Los Angeles, as they assembled a 3–1 series lead by winning the next two games in Portland. The Lakers underestimated the Trail Blazers, however. Led by former Jackson linchpin Scottie Pippen, Portland won back-to-back elimination games and forced a series-deciding Game 7. Amid several controversial foul calls by referee Dick Bavetta against members of the Trail Blazers, Portland relinquished a 75–60 fourth quarter lead. Rallying back with a 25–4 run, the Lakers won the game and secured a berth in the NBA Finals.\nIndiana Pacers.\nIn the 1997–1998 NBA season, the Chicago Bulls narrowly defeated the Pacers, 4 games to 3, in the Eastern Conference Finals. The 1998–1999 NBA season began with a lockout but saw Indiana return to the Eastern Conference Finals, where they lost to the New York Knicks. The 1999–2000 NBA season brought several major changes to the Pacers. It was their first season at Conseco Fieldhouse, as well as their first since 1993 without center Antonio Davis, who was traded for the rights to the No. 5 overall pick in the 1999 NBA Draft. Jalen Rose replaced Chris Mullin in the starting line up, winning the NBA Most Improved Player award, while Austin Croshere replaced him as the sixth man.\nThe Pacers started the season 7–7 but eventually finished with an Eastern Conference best 56–26 record, including a franchise-best 25 game win streak at home. The Pacers, like the Lakers, struggled in the playoffs. They needed a clutch Travis Best three-pointer to dispatch the Milwaukee Bucks in five games. Indiana faced the Philadelphia 76ers in the second round and took the series in six games, earning a trip to the Eastern Conference Finals. The Pacers would face their rival Knicks, winning a memorable six-game series in a reversal of fortunes from years past. With the victory, Indiana advanced to the first NBA Finals in franchise history, becoming the second former ABA team to do so after the Spurs the previous season.\nRegular season series.\nBoth teams split the two meetings, each won by the home team:\n2000 NBA Finals rosters.\nLos Angeles Lakers.\n \nSeries summary.\nThe Finals were played using a 2–3–2 site format, where the team with home court advantage would receive the first two games and the last two games at home. The NBA, after experimenting in the early years, restored this original format for the Finals in 1985. So far, the other playoff series are still running on a 2–2–1–1–1 site format. The Finals returned to a 2-2-1-1-1 format in 2014. Additionally, both teams in the Finals featured newly built arenas, as the Lakers' Crypto.com Arena and the Pacers' Gainbridge Fieldhouse opened at the beginning of the 1999–2000 NBA season.\nThis was the second time a Finals game was played on a Monday night since the NBA switched to the Wednesday-Friday-Sunday rotation in 1991. In the previous five series (1992–94, 1996, 1998) that needed a Game 6, the game was played on a Sunday. In this series, however, the NBA chose to play the game the Monday night after Father's Day. The previous Finals game played on a Monday night was Game 3 in 1999.\nGame 1.\nThe Lakers dominated from the start. The Lakers shot 15-for-20 (75%) in the first period while the Pacers shot only 7-for-20 (35%). Reggie Miller would miss all of his shots in the first quarter to give the Lakers a 15-point lead. Austin Croshere came off the bench to keep the Pacers alive in the 2nd quarter, scoring 9 points and grabbing 4 rebounds in the quarter. Although the Pacers attempted a comeback in the 2nd quarter, they were still down by 12. In the 3rd quarter, it would be Mark Jackson who led the Pacers to a comeback, cutting the Lakers lead to 2. Reggie Miller also hit his first field goal in the 3rd quarter, though it would be his last. The Lakers handled the Pacers in the final quarter, with a 13–2 run winning by 17 points. Shaquille O'Neal scored 43 points and grabbed 19 rebounds.\nGame 2.\nLos Angeles and Indiana were evenly matched for the first quarter, both scoring 28. However, Los Angeles suffered a major setback when Kobe Bryant left the game in the 1st quarter due to a sprained ankle and did not return. Jalen Rose later admitted that he intentionally stuck out his foot when Kobe shot a jumpshot in order to trip him when he landed. Ron Harper went in for Bryant and scored 21 points for the game. Desperate to try to gain the lead, Larry Bird resorted to the \"Hack-a-Shaq\" strategy. Shaq shot 39 free throws, making only 18, an NBA record for most free throws attempted. Despite this low percentage, Shaq made 9 of 16 in the 4th quarter to keep a Lakers lead. The Pacers cut the lead to 99–96 and were looking to foul Shaq, but when Shaq got the ball he passed to Robert Horry who converted not only the layup, but the foul shot as well giving them a 102–96 lead en route to a 111–104 Lakers victory.\nGame 3.\nTaking advantage of Kobe Bryant's ankle injury, Indiana restored a semblance of parity to the proceedings. Kobe's absence was felt as the Pacers had an 11–2 run in the first quarter to take an 8-point lead. Austin Croshere once again had another huge 2nd quarter, scoring 8 points as the Pacers shot 61% from the field. The Lakers tried to make a run to get back into the game, but upon doings so, Indiana answered with 12 straight points and led by 17. The Lakers were desperate and attempted another run to get within 3 points, but Reggie Miller nailed all his free throws at the end of the game to give Indiana a 9-point win.\nGame 4.\nThe Pacers took a quick 9–2 lead due to Rik Smits hitting his first four shots. Kobe Bryant attempted to play with his sore ankle but only managed to score 6 points in the first half. Even though Bryant and O'Neal were in foul trouble in the first half (each picking up his third with 5 minutes remaining in the second quarter), Indiana could not take advantage and did not extend their lead. This would be a problem as Kobe Bryant scored 10 points and the Lakers took a 62–60 lead due to a Glen Rice three-pointer. The game remained close going into the fourth quarter, when O'Neal and Reggie Miller scored 14 and 13 points respectively, sending the game into overtime. Midway through overtime, O'Neal committed his sixth foul but 21-year-old Bryant delivered three clutch shots, as the Lakers were able to overcome back-up center John Salley's inability to effectively defend Smits. Smits and Miller scored all 14 of Indiana's OT points, but it was not enough to overcome as Miller missed a last-second three-pointer, and L.A. was able to pull one out in Indianapolis. Shaquille O'Neal was the first final NBA MVP player to foul out in the NBA Finals until Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors fouled out in Game 6 of the 2016 NBA Finals.\nGame 5.\nReggie Miller and the Pacers dominated the game from the start in what would be Larry Bird's last game as a coach in the state of Indiana. Reggie Miller came out and made 5 straight shots including a 4-point play. The Pacers hit their first 6 three point shots in the game. The Pacers would have a 20-point lead in the 2nd quarter, and eventually won by 33 – it was the worst Lakers NBA Finals loss since the 148–114 loss to Boston in the 1985 NBA Finals, known as the \"Memorial Day Massacre.\"\nWith their loss in Game 5, the Lakers record in close-out games dropped to 3–6 in the 2000 NBA Playoffs (the other losses coming in Games 3 and 4 in the first round against Sacramento, Game 4 in the series against Phoenix, and Games 5 and 6 versus Portland). As a result, the series returned to California.\nGame 6.\nAfter the two teams traded blows in the first quarter, Mark Jackson concluded the period with a turn-around half-court shot at the buzzer to give the Pacers a 26–24 advantage. They would not relinquish their lead until the fourth quarter. In the first half, the Pacers would lead by as many as twelve points. However, the Lakers chipped away and entered intermission trailing 56–53. Indiana added two more points to their lead, and entered the final period in a position to force a decisive seventh game.\nIn the fourth quarter, the momentum shifted. The Lakers got four timely three-pointers from Derek Fisher, Robert Horry, and Rick Fox. The turning point occurred on a play where Brian Shaw stole the ball from Jalen Rose, leading to a fast break where Shaquille O'Neal hit an off-balance shot to give the Lakers the lead. The Pacers never led after that point.\nThe Lakers would build a seven-point lead, but the Pacers fought back to tie the score at 103. After a timeout, the Lakers scored six unanswered points to regain control. The Pacers made one final valiant effort, but it fell short and the Lakers clinched their first championship in twelve years. Shaquille O'Neal led all scorers with 41 points and also pulled down 12 rebounds. He was awarded the Finals MVP.\nBroadcasting.\nThe 2000 NBA Finals was aired in the United States on NBC, with Bob Costas and Doug Collins on play-by-play and color commentary respectively. Even though Marv Albert had been rehired by NBC Sports in 1999 following his infamous sex scandal, NBC opted to keep Costas as the lead play-by-play man to avoid any negative publicity. Albert was eventually promoted back to the lead role before the succeeding season.\nHannah Storm served as the studio host while Isiah Thomas, Bill Walton and Steve \"Snapper\" Jones served as studio analysts. Ahmad Rashad and Jim Gray served as sideline reporters.\nAftermath.\nThis was the first NBA championship for the Lakers since . It was also the first major professional sports championship for the city of Los Angeles since that same year, when the Dodgers won the 1988 World Series. This championship came in the Lakers’ first year in their new arena, Staples Center. The Lakers held a championship parade on June 21, 2000.\nThe Lakers went on to score a “three-peat” when they won the NBA championship in and , making them the first team to open a new arena with three straight NBA championships. However, the Lakers were unable to score home-court advantage throughout the playoffs in the latter two, yielding them to the San Antonio Spurs and Sacramento Kings, respectively. In addition, the Lakers were able to beat both of those teams in the Conference Finals. They won the championship over the Philadelphia 76ers and New Jersey Nets, respectively.\n, the series remains the Pacers’ only NBA Finals appearance. The Pacers would rebuild in the subsequent season. Retiring center Rik Smits was replaced by future NBA All-Star Jermaine O'Neal, acquired from Portland in the deal for Dale Davis. Mark Jackson and Chris Mullin both left as free-agents. Larry Bird resigned as head coach; he would later resurface as President of Basketball Operations in . The Pacers continued to make the playoffs every season until 2006, the year after Reggie Miller retired.\nThe Lakers and the Pacers would meet again 23 years later in the championship game of the inaugural NBA In-Season Tournament, with the Lakers winning 123-109.\nRiots.\nDuring the Lakers' victory on June 18, an estimated crowd of over 6,000 fans gathered outside Staples Center to view the game and later celebrate the victory. However; as the crowd grew during the night following the victory, fans began acting unruly until the celebrations devolved into a riot. Fans began lighting numerous bonfires or torching nearby cars in the street, things devolved quickly as vandals also began looting and vandalizing nearby buildings. LAPD was criticized for its late response hours after the damage began, there was no released total of the overall property damage but 70 cars and a local dealership were destroyed. Upon seeing the destruction following the victory, owner Dr. Jerry Buss and Magic Johnson would heavily condemn the vandalism and urge fans to leave the area and celebrate in peace. LAPD were forced to re evaluate their security plans for that election year's Democratic National Convention following the destruction."

        "text": "The 2001 NBA Finals was the championship round of the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s 2000–01 season, and the conclusion of the season's playoffs. The defending NBA champion and Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers took on the Eastern Conference champion Philadelphia 76ers for the championship, with the Lakers holding home-court advantage in a best-of-seven format. After losing the first game at home, the Lakers won the next four games to clinch their second consecutive title and 13th overall. By the end of the series, the 2000–01 Lakers held the record for the best postseason record with 15–1. It was later surpassed after the NBA extended the first round series to a best-of-seven series by the 2016–17 Golden State Warriors. Lakers center Shaquille O'Neal was named the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) for the second consecutive year, after averaging 33.0 points, 15.8 rebounds and 3.4 blocks per game.\nBackground.\nThe Los Angeles Lakers entered the 2000–01 NBA season as the defending NBA champions. The club lost a few players to free agency, but they signed veteran players like Isaiah Rider and Horace Grant. The Lakers began the season struggling on and off the court, as they were losing games at the beginning with the Shaq–Kobe feud. Injuries also riddled the team as they struggled through the season. But by April 1, 2001, the Lakers last loss was to the New York Knicks and they never looked back as the team closed out the season on an eight-game winning streak, thus finishing the season 56-26 and closing out as the number 2 seed in the West behind the San Antonio Spurs.\nThe Lakers began the 2001 NBA Playoffs versus the team against whom they played the previous year in the Western Conference finals, the Portland Trail Blazers. The Trail Blazers were a team that struggled throughout the season but battled back to claim the 7th seed. The series wasn't close, as the Lakers swept the Trail Blazers by double digits in all three games. In the semifinals the Lakers took on the Sacramento Kings, a team who had also given the Lakers a tough series the previous season, but the Lakers took two close games at home and went to Sacramento to finish the Kings off with a 4–0 sweep as well. In the conference finals the Lakers went up against the number 1 seed San Antonio Spurs, who were expected to be more competitive than the Lakers' previous opponents. But the Lakers took games 1 and 2 in San Antonio, and then blew them out in games 3 and 4 in Los Angeles in another complete sweep as they became the second team in NBA history to sweep the conference playoffs at 11–0, the 1988-1989 Los Angeles Lakers being the first.\nBut the Lakers met a snag on their quest to the first NBA sweep in playoff history as they went up against Allen Iverson and the Philadelphia 76ers. The 76ers, seeded number 1 in the Eastern Conference, had just come out of two straight seven-game series against the Toronto Raptors and Milwaukee Bucks. During the first game, the trio of Iverson, Dikembe Mutombo and Eric Snow, coming hot off a long Eastern Conference championship road, beat the Lakers in overtime, showcasing their endurance.\nThe Lakers then took Game 2. Afterwards, Kobe Bryant was quoted as saying he was coming to Philadelphia to cut their hearts out. The Sixers dropped all three games in Philadelphia, giving the Lakers their second straight championship.\nRegular season series.\nBoth teams split the two meetings, each won by the home team:\nSeries summary.\nGame 1.\nThe Lakers dominated early, in what looked like to be their fourth series sweep. Scoring 16 straight points, the Lakers took a 21–9 lead over the Allen Iverson-led 76ers. Despite this major lead, Iverson began dominating at the half of the 2nd quarter scoring 30 first half points. The 76ers turned the game around and even went up by 15 points during the third quarter before the Lakers started a comeback. Shaquille O'Neal was a major factor in the comeback, scoring 18 points in the quarter.\nThe Lakers played fantastically during the 4th quarter, and Tyronn Lue came off the bench and limited Iverson to merely 3 points and had 3 assists and 2 steals of his own. The game was eventually tied at 94, and when Dikembe Mutombo missed two free throws and Eric Snow's desperation three-pointer at the buzzer bounced off the rim, the game went to overtime.\nThe Lakers scored the first 5 points in the first half of overtime. Raja Bell then hit a tough layup to answer, followed by Iverson scoring 7 straight points, including a three pointer to give them the lead. Iverson followed up with a step back 2-pointer over Lue which is famously known as he stepped over Lue after hitting the shot. The 76ers finished with a 6-point win to take the first game of the series.\nGame 2.\nKobe Bryant started off the game with 12 points in the first quarter, while Shaq scored 12 points in the second quarter. Despite their points, the 76ers kept a close lead as Larry Brown ran over 10 plays searching for the right quartet, and the fact that all the Lakers besides Bryant and O'Neal were shooting only at 27%. The Sixers were down by 13 in the fourth quarter, and were making a comeback due to Shaq sitting out with 5 fouls, which helped the 76ers to score 7 straight. Even though the 76ers were within 3 points of the Lakers, the 6 of 16 foul shooting in the fourth quarter put them behind permanently. O'Neal finished with 28 points, 20 rebounds, nine assists, and eight blocks, coming close to a quadruple double. Before the game, Lakers coach Phil Jackson had growled at O'Neal, \"Don't be afraid to block a shot!\" after O'Neal failed to block a shot in Game 1.\nBroadcasting.\nThe 2001 NBA Finals was aired in the United States on NBC, with Marv Albert and Doug Collins on play-by-play and color commentary respectively. Albert, who last worked the Finals for NBC Sports in , had been rehired by the network in 1999, two years after a sex scandal led to his dismissal. Albert also began working for TNT during this period, a role he continued until 2021. Collins departed NBC following the series to serve as head coach of the Washington Wizards.\nAhmad Rashad served as the studio host in place of Hannah Storm, who took a maternity leave during the finals. Kevin Johnson and P. J. Carlesimo served as studio analysts, while Lewis Johnson and Jim Gray served as sideline reporters.\nAftermath.\nThe Lakers won their third straight championship in a four-game sweep of the New Jersey Nets the following year.\nAlso for the Lakers, their 15–1 postseason record was the best in NBA history. This record would later be broken throughout the 2017 NBA playoffs by the Golden State Warriors, who had a 16–1 record en route to their 2017 NBA Championship. By this point, the first round series became a best-of-seven series, which began in 2003.\n, the series remains the 76ers’ last NBA Finals appearance. The Sixers would win only 43 games in the 2001-02 NBA season, as injuries were the story of their season. Nevertheless, they made the playoffs as the sixth seed, but were defeated by the Boston Celtics in five games. The Celtics themselves came within two games of returning to the NBA Finals for the first time since , but were ousted by the upstart Nets, who made the NBA Finals for the first time, denying a possible Celtics-Lakers final. As for the Sixers, they would never challenge for the title again in the Allen Iverson era, with the team reaching the playoffs only twice for the next four years, winning only one series.\nLarry Brown later coached the Detroit Pistons to their third championship in the 2004 NBA Finals, defeating the Lakers 4–1."

        "text": "The 1996 NBA Finals was the championship series of the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s 1995–96 season, and the culmination of the season's playoffs. The Western Conference champion Seattle SuperSonics (64–18) played the Eastern Conference champion Chicago Bulls (72–10), with the Bulls holding home court advantage. The teams' 136 combined regular season wins shattered the previous record of 125, set in 1985 between the Los Angeles Lakers who won 62 games and the Boston Celtics who won 63 games in the past regular season. The series, the 50th NBA finals in league history, was played under a best-of-seven format. This was the first championship in the Chicago Bulls' second three-peat.\nChicago won the series 4 games to 2. Michael Jordan was named NBA Finals MVP, his fourth time winning the award.\nBackground.\nChicago Bulls.\nThe Bulls were coming off a season where they lost in the second round of the playoffs to the Orlando Magic. Heading into the upcoming season, Chicago was no longer the same team as they were in their most recent championship season of , having lost key members of their first three-peat core in John Paxson who retired, while Bill Cartwright, Horace Grant, B. J. Armstrong, Stacey King, Will Perdue, and Scott Williams left via free agency.\nIn their place was a new core of players such as Luc Longley, Toni Kukoč, Steve Kerr, Ron Harper, Jud Buechler, Bill Wennington and Randy Brown. But perhaps their biggest addition to the team was Dennis Rodman, a nine-year veteran who had been a rebounding champion for four straight years, and whose controversial lifestyle has been well-documented.\nThe result of this ensemble was perhaps the greatest regular season of any team in NBA history at the time, as the Bulls won a record-high 72 games, which would be broken by the Golden State Warriors in the 2015–16 season. They continued to gain momentum in the playoffs, beginning with a sweep of the Miami Heat in the first round, followed by a five-game defeat of the New York Knicks in the second round. The conference finals was a rematch of the previous season's series with the Orlando Magic, but it was a no-contest, as the Bulls swept the Magic to gain entry into the Finals.\nSeattle SuperSonics.\nThe SuperSonics were led by Gary Payton and Shawn Kemp, with George Karl as head coach. The team was considered a perennial title contender throughout the mid-1990s, but the closest they came to reaching the finals was in 1993, when they lost to the Phoenix Suns in seven games in the Western Conference Finals.\nTwo straight first-round exits followed, including the stunning 1994 loss to the eighth-seeded Denver Nuggets (the Sonics were the first seed in that playoffs). Motivated by a successive string of early playoff losses, Seattle finished the 1996 regular season with a franchise-record 64 wins.\nSeattle began its playoff run with a four-game win over the Sacramento Kings, followed by a dominant sweep of the defending champion Houston Rockets, headed by a 33 point win in Game 1 where they held Hakeem Olajuwon to 5 points. They then beat the Utah Jazz in seven games in the western finals to advance to its first NBA championship round since .\nRegular season series.\nThe teams split their two meetings, each game won by the home team:\nSeries summary.\nGame 1.\nAlthough Chicago was not playing well offensively, they were able to compensate with superb defense. Frustration set in for Seattle when Frank Brickowski was ejected after committing a flagrant foul against Dennis Rodman, then promptly getting charged with two consecutive technical fouls. Chicago was leading by only 2 at the end of the third quarter, but in the final quarter, shots by Toni Kukoč and 2 key steals by Ron Harper clinched the Bulls' Game 1 win. Shawn Kemp was a bright spot for Seattle, scoring 32 points, but ended up fouling out midway through the fourth quarter. Michael Jordan led the way for the Bulls with 28 points, while Scottie Pippen chipped in with 21 points. Seattle captain Nate McMillan ended up leaving the game due to a debilitating back injury in the 2nd quarter. Dennis Rodman pulled down 13 rebounds for the Bulls, while Toni Kukoč chipped in off the bench with 18 points.\nGame 2.\nGame 2 started well for Seattle with a 27–23 first quarter lead. However, Seattle would once again lose the lead before halftime. Despite Shawn Kemp's 29 points and 13 rebounds, Chicago triumphed with a final score of 92 to 88. In the victory, Dennis Rodman tied an NBA Finals record with 11 offensive rebounds and made a clutch free throw near the end of the game to seal the Bulls victory. Michael Jordan once again led the Bulls with 29 points, while Shawn Kemp continued his strong play by scoring 29 points for Seattle.\nGame 3.\nThe Sonics, owners of a 44–5 home record (including playoffs), suffered a 22-point blow-out in their return to Seattle, giving the Bulls a seemingly insurmountable 3–0 series lead. Frustration would once again set in for the Sonics, as Frank Brickowski was ejected for committing a flagrant foul on Dennis Rodman. Michael Jordan led the way for the Bulls with 36 points.\nGame 4.\nSeattle did not want to suffer the ignominy of a sweep. In an attempt to spark his team, Coach George Karl gave Jordan's defensive assignment to Gary Payton, a move which showed immediate results. Seattle succeeded with a 107–86 win over the Bulls, and Sonics fans taunted the Bulls players with homemade signs reading \"\"Sweepless in Seattle\".\" The Sonics were helped by the return of team captain Nate McMillan whose presence entering the game brought the KeyArena crowd to its feet.\nSeattle's victory prevented the NBA Finals from being swept in two consecutive years (something which, as of 2023, has never occurred).\nGame 5.\nSeattle would once again deny the Bulls the championship, stretching the series to six games. Payton had this to say: \"We feel great. We knew we could play with this team. It just took too long. We should have come with this a little earlier.\" Shawn Kemp's performance in this game was considered by many to be his best in a Seattle uniform.\nGame 6.\nChicago won the series four games to two on Father's Day, in what would be the last time the Sonics played a Finals game before relocating to Oklahoma City and being renamed the Thunder. The Bulls' victory was partly due to the stellar performance of power forward Dennis Rodman, who delivered a repeat of his Game 2 performance with 19 rebounds, tying his own NBA Finals record. Bulls star Michael Jordan finished the game with 22 points and collected his fourth Finals MVP.\nAs of 2023, no NBA team has ever overcome a 3-0 playoff series deficit, and only four teams have forced a Game 7 after dropping the first three contests: the New York Knicks (1951), Denver Nuggets (1994), Portland Trail Blazers (2003), and Boston Celtics (2023).\nBroadcasting.\nThe Finals was aired in the United States on NBC. Bob Costas hosted the pre-game, halftime and post-game show with analysts Julius Erving and Peter Vecsey. Games were called by Marv Albert, Matt Guokas and Bill Walton, while Ahmad Rashad and Hannah Storm served as sideline reporters.\nAftermath.\nThe 1996 NBA Finals would be the last Finals appearance of the Seattle SuperSonics. The Sonics would win the Pacific Division again in 1997 and 1998, but fell in the second round of the playoffs each time. The series was George Karl's only Finals appearance in his coaching career to date. In 2008, the Sonics franchise moved to Oklahoma City and became the Thunder. They would make the finals four years later after the move, losing to the Miami Heat in five games.\nThis was also the last time a Seattle-based team played for a major professional sports championship until Super Bowl XL in 2006, when the Seattle Seahawks lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Seahawks would go on to handily defeat the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XLVIII in 2014 and lose to the New England Patriots the following year in Super Bowl XLIX. In terms of overall sports leagues, the city would later enjoy six additional championships: the WNBA's Seattle Storm, a one-time SuperSonics sister team, won the 2004, the 2010, the 2018, and the 2020 WNBA Finals, and the MLS's Seattle Sounders FC won 2016 MLS Cup and 2019 MLS Cup.\nTeams from Chicago and Seattle would meet three more times in postseason competition among the \"Big Four\" leagues. The only time Seattle won over Chicago was in the 2000 American League Division Series, when the Seattle Mariners swept the Chicago White Sox 3–0. Meanwhile, the Seahawks lost to the Chicago Bears in the divisional round of both the and NFL playoffs.\nThe Bulls came close to winning 70 games for the second straight year, instead settling for a 69-win campaign in 1997. They won their second straight title over the Utah Jazz in six games of the 1997 NBA Finals. In the off-season that preceded Scottie Pippen became the first person to win the NBA championship and an Olympic gold medal in the same year twice, playing for Team USA at the Atlanta Olympics. The Bulls would also defeat the Utah Jazz in six games in the 1998 NBA Finals.\nThe Bulls' combined 87 wins in the regular season and postseason would stand as an NBA record until the 2015-16 Golden State Warriors, coached by former Bull Steve Kerr, broke it with 88 total wins (thanks to the first round using a best-of-7 format instead of the best-of-5 in 1996), including a 73-9 regular season mark. However, the Warriors lost to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2016 NBA Finals, failing to repeat as champions after beating the same Cavaliers in the previous Finals."

        "title": "1995 NBA Finals",
        "text": "The 1995 NBA Finals was the championship round of the 1994–95 National Basketball Association (NBA) season. The series pitted the Eastern Conference champion Orlando Magic against the defending NBA champion and Western Conference champion Houston Rockets. The pre-series hype and buildup of the Finals was centered on the meeting of the two centers opposing each other: Shaquille O'Neal of the Magic and Hakeem Olajuwon of the Rockets. Going into the series the matchup was compared to the Bill Russell–Wilt Chamberlain matchup of the 1960s.\nThe Rockets became the first team in NBA history to beat four 50-win teams in a single postseason en route to the championship. The Rockets would win a playoff-record nine road games in the 1995 playoffs. It was the second NBA Finals sweep in the 2–3–2 Finals format (after the Detroit Pistons did so against the Los Angeles Lakers in 1989). The Rockets also became the first repeat NBA Champion in history to keep the title with a sweep. In addition, the Rockets became the first team in NBA history to win the title without having home-court advantage in any of the four playoff rounds since the playoffs was expanded to a 16 team format in 1984. Coincidentally, this feat would also be achieved in the NHL by the New Jersey Devils that same year, when they won the Stanley Cup over the Detroit Red Wings. This is also the first time in both the NBA and NHL history where both finals consist of the heavily favored number one seeded team both being swept.\nThe Orlando Magic, making their first NBA Finals appearance, began the series at home, hosting the defending champion Houston Rockets. With the Magic up 110–107 late in Game 1, Nick Anderson missed four consecutive free throws in the closing seconds of the game, and Kenny Smith hit a three-pointer, tying the game and sending it to overtime as well as setting a new record at the time, with the most three-pointers in an NBA Finals game with seven. The more experienced Rockets went on to win in overtime and eventually swept the Magic, winning their second consecutive NBA Championship. In achieving this, they earned the distinction of being the only team to win both championships during Michael Jordan's first retirement (although Jordan did return in the closing months of the 1994–95 season), in addition to being the only team other than the Chicago Bulls to win multiple championships in the 1990s. This was also the second consecutive 90s championship series not featuring the Chicago Bulls, a streak the Bulls would end in 1996.\nThe season-ending documentary \"Double Clutch\" by Hal Douglas, was released by NBA Entertainment to coincide with the Rockets' championship season.\nBackground.\nHouston Rockets.\nThe Rockets entered the 1994–95 season as defending champions. They had won their first eight games of the season, the first defending champions to have won their first eight games of their season since the 1987-88 Lakers. However, they struggled to maintain last season's form due to injuries and off-court-distractions. On February 14, the Rockets acquired Clyde Drexler from the Portland Trail Blazers, but the trade of a hometown hero (Drexler was a teammate of Olajuwon at the University of Houston) did not improve matters, and the Rockets settled for the sixth seed with a 47–35 record.\nHowever, Houston once again lived up to its Clutch City reputation come playoff time. En route to the Finals, the Rockets defeated three teams with 55 or more victories. They began by ousting the Utah Jazz in six games (the Rockets trailed 2–1 after three games), then repeating last season's comeback effort over the Phoenix Suns (wherein the Rockets trailed 3–1 after four games). In Game 7 of that series, Phoenix led Houston 51-42 after the first half before Houston mounted a comeback to get the series win, 115-114. After dispatching the Suns, the Rockets outclassed the top-seeded San Antonio Spurs in six games of the conference finals.\nOrlando Magic.\nThe Magic were only in their sixth season of existence, but they were a team on the rise. Led by All-Stars Shaquille O'Neal and Penny Hardaway, new acquisition Horace Grant, and franchise cornerstones Nick Anderson and Dennis Scott, the Magic rolled through the Eastern Conference, winding up with a then-franchise best 57–25 mark.\nOrlando's road to the Finals began with a convincing 3–1 series win over the Boston Celtics. They followed it up with a six-game ouster of Michael Jordan (returning from an 18-month retirement) and the Chicago Bulls in the second round, and in the conference finals, they vanquished the Indiana Pacers in a tough seven-game series.\nRegular season series.\nThe Orlando Magic won both games in the regular season series:\nSeries summary.\nThis was one of only two NBA Finals in which the team who did not have home court advantage swept the series, (the other being the 1975 Finals, in which the Golden State Warriors swept the Washington Bullets).\nGame 1.\nOrlando led 110-107 with 10.5 seconds left, when Nick Anderson was intentionally fouled to send him to the free-throw line. Normally a respectable free-throw shooter (70.4 percent in the regular season), Anderson missed both of his free throws, but was able to grab the offensive rebound after the second miss and was fouled again. Anderson shockingly missed the next two free throws, and Houston grabbed the rebound, and would tie the game with 1.6 seconds left on Kenny Smith's 3-point shot. The shot was one of Smith's seven made 3-point shots, setting a then-Finals record. In overtime, Hakeem Olajuwon tipped in a missed finger roll by Clyde Drexler with three-tenths of a second left to win the game. Hakeem Olajuwon finished the game with 31 points, 6 rebounds, 7 assists and 4 blocks while Kenny Smith recorded 23 points and 9 assists. The four consecutive missed free-throws by Nick Anderson would haunt him for the rest of his career. After the Finals, Anderson would shoot only 60.5% on free-throws for the rest of his career.\nGame 2.\nHakeem Olajuwon recorded a double-double with 34 points and 11 rebounds to lead the Rockets to a 117-106 victory and a 2-0 series lead. The Magic, on the other hand, became the 2nd team in NBA Finals history to lose the first two of their four home games.\nGame 3.\nRobert Horry hit a three-pointer to give Houston a 104-100 lead with 14.1 seconds left. Orlando's Anfernee Hardaway then missed a three-pointer, and the rebound deflected off Dennis Scott and out of bounds with 6.8 seconds left, turning the ball over to Houston. Clyde Drexler was immediately fouled. He missed his first free throw and made the second for a 105-100 Rockets lead with 5.9 seconds left. Nick Anderson hit a three-pointer with 2.7 seconds left to bring the Magic within two points, and then Sam Cassell was immediately fouled. He needed to make both free throws to likely seal it, but missed the first. He made the second to give the Rockets a three-point lead with 2.2 seconds left. After a timeout to advance the ball to midcourt, the Magic had one last chance to tie the game and force overtime, but Hardaway missed a three-pointer as the buzzer sounded. The Rockets held on for a 106-103 win in Game 3 to take a 3-0 series lead and were one win away from their second consecutive NBA title.\nGame 4.\nAt the end of the first half, the Magic had a 4-point advantage over the home team, Rockets. However, the Rockets had another notable comeback as they outscored the Magic 66-50 in the second half, thus winning their second consecutive NBA championship. Olajuwon outscored O'Neal by 10 points and capped off the sweep by hitting a memorable yet uncharacteristic 3-pointer in front of O'Neal. When accepting the Larry O'Brien Trophy on the floor of The Summit, Rockets head coach Rudy Tomjanovich said \"Don't ever underestimate the heart of a champion!\" Olajuwon, with his 35 point and 15 rebound performance, was named Finals MVP for the second straight year.\nOlajuwon v. O'Neal.\nAlthough both centers played well, Olajuwon outscored O'Neal in every game of the series and became one of the few players in NBA history to score at least 30 points in every game of an NBA Finals series:\nBy winning his second straight NBA Finals MVP award, Hakeem Olajuwon became the sixth player to win the award on multiple occasions, joining Willis Reed, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, and Michael Jordan. Jordan and Olajuwon at the time were the only players to win the award consecutively.\nMedia coverage.\nIn the United States, the NBA Finals was broadcast on NBC television, with Marv Albert, Matt Guokas and Bill Walton calling the action. Ahmad Rashad, Hannah Storm, and Jim Gray served as sideline reporters, and studio coverage was handled by Bob Costas, Julius Erving and Peter Vecsey.\nNational radio coverage was provided by the NBA Radio Network, with Joe McConnell and Wes Unseld on the call. After the season, NBA Radio was dissolved and subsequent national radio broadcasts of the NBA Finals would be handled by ESPN Radio.\nAftermath.\nThe Rockets' title reign ended in 1996, when they were swept by the Seattle SuperSonics in the second round. The Sonics were also the last team to beat the Rockets in the playoffs prior to their championship run, having eliminated them in the second round in 1993. That year, the Rockets won 48 games and achieved the fourth seed. The following offseason, they acquired former NBA MVP Charles Barkley in a trade, but age and injuries would take its toll and the closest the Rockets would achieve after their two-year championship reign was a six-game loss to the Utah Jazz in the 1997 Western Conference Finals. As of 2023, this remains the most recent Rockets finals appearance.\nThe Magic won a franchise-record 60 games in the 1995–96 NBA season, but were swept by the Chicago Bulls in the 1996 Eastern Conference Finals. During the offseason, Shaquille O'Neal signed with the Los Angeles Lakers, with whom he went on to win three championships; he later added a fourth title to his resume with the Miami Heat in . The Magic would not return to the Finals until , which they lost to the Lakers in five games."

        "title": "1993 NBA Finals",
        "text": "The 1993 NBA Finals was the championship round of the 1992–93 NBA season, and the conclusion of the season's playoffs. It featured the two-time defending NBA champion and Eastern Conference champion Chicago Bulls, led by Michael Jordan, and the Western Conference playoff champion Phoenix Suns, winners of 62 games and led by regular season MVP Charles Barkley. The Bulls became the first team since the Boston Celtics of the 1960s to win three consecutive championship titles, clinching the \"three-peat\" with John Paxson's game-winning 3-pointer that gave them a 99–98 victory in Game 6.\nBackground.\nChicago Bulls.\nWith two consecutive NBA championships, the Bulls aimed at an elusive 'three-peat'. No team had won a third consecutive NBA title since the Boston Celtics achieved a run of eight titles in a row from 1959 to 1966.\nIn the offseason, Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen played for the Dream Team at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, winning the gold medal. They entered the new season with little rest, but it did not stop both Jordan and Pippen from leading the Bulls to a 57–25 record, good for second in the Eastern Conference.\nChicago began its push for a 'three-peat' with back-to-back sweeps of the Atlanta Hawks and Cleveland Cavaliers. But against the top-seeded New York Knicks, the Bulls fell behind 2–0, before winning the next two games in Chicago, tying the series. In a crucial Game 5 at Madison Square Garden, the Bulls stole a rare road victory, aided by an array of blocks on Charles Smith in the final seconds, before wrapping up the series in Game 6 at Chicago Stadium.\nPhoenix Suns.\nThe Suns were a team on the rise, led by their All-Star point guard Kevin Johnson. Johnson arrived via trade in 1988, and propelled the Suns to two consecutive trips to the conference finals in his first two full seasons.\nIn the 1992 offseason, the Suns made a blockbuster trade, acquiring Charles Barkley from the Philadelphia 76ers in exchange for Jeff Hornacek, Tim Perry and Andrew Lang. They also hired Paul Westphal as head coach, unveiled new logos and uniforms, and moved to the brand new America West Arena from the Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum.\nThe Suns made the most of these moves, winning a franchise record 62 games. Barkley's efforts won him the MVP award. However, in the first round of the Western Conference playoffs, the Suns fell down 2–0 to the Los Angeles Lakers, before rallying to defeat them in five games. In the second round the Suns defeated the San Antonio Spurs in six games, and were again pushed to a decisive game seven by the Seattle SuperSonics before ultimately winning the conference finals. For the Suns, it was their first NBA finals appearance since 1976 and second overall.\nRegular season series.\nBoth teams split the two meetings, each won by the road team:\nSeries summary.\nGame 1.\nPhoenix displayed an introduction animation in the vein of Chicago's well-known intro animation, set to the same song, before the game, which was remarked upon by the commentators. Before the game, a moment of silence was observed in memory of New Jersey Nets guard Dražen Petrović, who had been killed in a car accident two days earlier. The Bulls led the game from start to finish, and were able to quell several rallies from the Suns throughout.\nGame 2.\nBoth teams were locked in battle throughout the first half until Chicago took over in the 2nd quarter, shooting with a higher shooting percentage. In the second half, the Suns began to pressure the Bulls, but ran into trouble when Kevin Johnson fouled out, and Charles Barkley suffered an elbow injury. Late in the 4th quarter with time running out, it came down to a battle of determination. Scottie Pippen blocked Danny Ainge's 3-point attempt to seal the win and Phoenix became the first team to lose their home-court advantage twice in the first two games of the NBA Finals (the Orlando Magic did this two years later).\nGame 3.\nThe Phoenix Suns won Game 3 in triple overtime, 129–121. Horace Grant hits the game-tying 3-point play with 1:33 left in regulation to force the first OT; Tom Chambers hits the game-tying lay-up with 50.9 seconds left in the first OT to force the second OT; Dan Majerle hits the game-tying shot with 3.2 seconds left in the second OT to force the third OT. Suns Head Coach Paul Westphal became the only person to appear in two triple-overtime finals games: the first was the classic 1976 Game 5 contest against Boston as a player. His Suns also became the only team to appear in two triple-overtime finals games, the first of which they lost 126–128. Westphal made a surprising move that paid off, helping to get Kevin Johnson back on track after Johnson had two terrible performances in Games 1 and 2, by having him guard Michael Jordan. KJ played much better all-around basketball for the rest of the Finals.\nSuns: Kevin Johnson 25, Dan Majerle 28, Charles Barkley 24, Mark West 11, Richard Dumas 17, Danny Ainge 10, Tom Chambers 12, Oliver Miller 2, Frank Johnson 0, Jerrod Mustaf 0\nBulls: B. J. Armstrong 21, Michael Jordan 44, Scottie Pippen 26, Horace Grant 13, Bill Cartwright 8, Scott Williams 4, Trent Tucker 3, Stacey King 0, John Paxson 2, Darrell Walker 0\nGame 4.\nIn Game 4, Michael Jordan was unstoppable, scoring 55 points at Chicago Stadium and making a tough driving layup late in the game while getting fouled. The Bulls won 111–105. Scott Williams, who like MJ played his college basketball at UNC for Dean Smith, joked afterwards about \"being proud that the two former Tar Heels combined for 57 points.\"\nSuns: Charles Barkley 32, Dan Majerle 14, Kevin Johnson 19, Richard Dumas 17, Mark West 8, Tom Chambers 7, Danny Ainge 2, Oliver Miller 2, Frank Johnson 4\nBulls: Michael Jordan 55, Scottie Pippen 14, Horace Grant 17, B. J. Armstrong 11, Bill Cartwright 3, John Paxson 6, Scott Williams 2, Stacey King 3, Rodney McCray 0, Darrell Walker 0, Trent Tucker 0\nGame 5.\nBefore Game 5, Charles Barkley told the press he had announced to his teammates that they needed to win to \"Save the City\", a reference to the riots anticipated in Chicago if the Bulls won the championship at home. Both Paul Westphal and Kevin Johnson later expressed amusement about Barkley taking credit for the line because Westphal had made a tongue-in-cheek comment to that effect in a pregame meeting.\nThe Suns won 108–98 and headed home for Game 6 down 3–2.\nSuns: Dan Majerle 11, Charles Barkley 24, Kevin Johnson 25, Mark West 5, Richard Dumas 25, Danny Ainge 8, Oliver Miller 8, Frank Johnson 2, Tom Chambers 0, Jerrod Mustaf 0 \nBulls: Michael Jordan 41, Scottie Pippen 22, Horace Grant 1, B. J. Armstrong 7, Bill Cartwright 2, John Paxson 12, Scott Williams 4, Stacey King 4, Will Perdue 0, Trent Tucker 5, Darrell Walker 0\nGame 6.\nThe Bulls got off to a good start in Game 6 but struggled in the fourth quarter, squandering a double-digit lead to trail 98–94. Michael Jordan made a layup to cut the lead to 2 points, and Dan Majerle's 30-foot three-pointer fell short on the Suns' next possession. Trailing 98–96 and playing a Game 7 on the road if they lost that day, Chicago ran a play that Phil Jackson called \"Blind Pig\" that had them increasing the play's \"thrust\" by bringing the ball from 3/4 back of the basket. Although Westphal's sole instruction on the play was for none of the players to double-team any of the Bulls (even Michael Jordan), Danny Ainge left John Paxson to try and either steal the ball or foul Horace Grant, who had missed all five of his shot attempts in the game and wasn't a good crunch-time free throw shooter. Grant saw Paxson alone 25 feet from the basket and fired a perfect pass, and Paxson then made a three pointer with 3.9 seconds left, giving the Bulls a 99–98 lead. Paxson's three-point field goal was the only score by any Bulls player other than Michael Jordan in the entire fourth quarter. The victory was secured by a last-second block from Grant on Kevin Johnson, thanks to Paxson's game-winning 3-point field goal.\nBulls: Michael Jordan 33, Scottie Pippen 23, B. J. Armstrong 18, Horace Grant 1, Bill Cartwright 2, John Paxson 8, Scott Williams 5, Trent Tucker 9, Stacey King 0\nSuns: Dan Majerle 21, Kevin Johnson 19, Charles Barkley 21, Richard Dumas 8, Mark West 4, Tom Chambers 12, Danny Ainge 9, Oliver Miller 4, Frank Johnson 0\nMichael Jordan, who averaged a Finals-record 41.0 PPG during the six-game series, became the first player in NBA history to win three straight Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Awards. He joined Magic Johnson as the only other player to win the award three times. The NBA started awarding the Finals MVP in 1969.\nMedia coverage.\nThis series was aired on NBC with Marv Albert, Bob Costas (hosts), Mike Fratello, Magic Johnson (who missed Game 6 due to attending his brother's wedding), Quinn Buckner (analysts), Ahmad Rashad (Bulls sideline) and Hannah Storm (Suns sideline) (reporters) calling the action. After the series, Johnson soon left NBC and returned to the Lakers for various roles, while Fratello was hired by the Cleveland Cavaliers as their head coach. Both were replaced by recently departed Orlando Magic head coach Matt Guokas. Albert and Fratello later reunited in 1999, this time calling NBA games on TNT, and would continue to do so for several more years.\nThe 1993 NBA championship documentary, \"Three-Peat\", marked the first time since 1982 that NBA Entertainment used film in on-court or off-court action, although most of it used videotape. It was narrated by Hal Douglas, who narrated the NBA Championship documentaries of the NBA Finals from 1992–1997.\nAftermath.\nA month after the Bulls' third straight championship, Michael Jordan's father, James R. Jordan, Sr., was murdered. Distraught by the murder of his father, Jordan announced his retirement from basketball a few weeks before the 1993–94 NBA season began, citing a loss of desire to play basketball. Even without Jordan, the Bulls still managed to win 55 games behind the All-Star efforts of Scottie Pippen; however the loss of Jordan was steep to overcome, and following a controversial call that gave the New York Knicks a win in Game 5, the Bulls lost to Knicks in the conference semi-finals of the 1994 NBA Playoffs in Game 7. Jordan returned from retirement in March 1995, following a brief baseball career and made the 1995 NBA Playoffs, losing to the Orlando Magic in six games.\nThe Phoenix Suns finished with 56 wins in the 1993–94 season, but were eliminated from the playoffs by the Houston Rockets after leading 2–0 in the Western Conference semifinals. The following year, Phoenix took a commanding 3–1 lead against a sixth-Seeded Houston team only to lose again, losing Games 5 and 7 on their home court, the last of which was decided on a 3-pointer by Mario Elie and an ensuing free throw session. The Rockets went on to win both the 1994 and 1995 NBA Finals. In a last-ditch attempt to win a championship, Barkley was soon traded to the Rockets in 1996 for Sam Cassell, Robert Horry and Chucky Brown. Despite forming a \"Big Three\" with Clyde Drexler and Hakeem Olajuwon, the Rockets failed to make the NBA Finals in Barkley's four seasons. The 1993 Finals was the only appearance of Charles Barkley's Hall of Fame career. This would be the last Finals appearance for the Suns until 2021, which they would also lose in six games to the Milwaukee Bucks.\nThe 1993 NBA Finals marked the only instance in the \"Big Four\" professional sports in which a Chicago team defeated a Phoenix/Arizona team in a playoff series. In the 2007 National League Division Series, the Arizona Diamondbacks swept the Chicago Cubs 3–0, while in the 2012 Stanley Cup playoffs, the Phoenix Coyotes defeated the Chicago Blackhawks 4–2."

        "text": "The 1992 NBA Finals was the championship round of the 1991–92 NBA season, and the conclusion of the season's playoffs. The defending NBA champion and Eastern Conference champion Chicago Bulls took on the Western Conference champion Portland Trail Blazers for the title, with Chicago having home court advantage, as they had the best record in the NBA that season.\nThe two teams appeared headed to face each other for most of the season and comparisons were made between Clyde Drexler and Michael Jordan throughout the season. A month earlier \"Sports Illustrated\" had even listed Drexler as Jordan's \"No. 1 rival\" on a cover the two appeared on together before the playoffs. The media, hoping to recreate a Magic Johnson–Larry Bird type rivalry in Jordan-Drexler, compared the two throughout the pre-Finals hype.\nThe Bulls went on to win the series in six games, becoming the fourth NBA team to win back-to-back championships after the Boston Celtics, Los Angeles Lakers, and Detroit Pistons. Michael Jordan was named Finals Most Valuable Player for the second year in a row, to go with his sixth straight regular season scoring title.\nBackground.\nChicago Bulls.\nThe Bulls won their first NBA championship the previous season and finished the 1991–92 season with a 67–15 record, surpassing last season's record by six games. Jordan won his second consecutive MVP award with a 30.1 points/6.4 assists/6.1 rebounds season.\nAfter sweeping the Miami Heat in the opening round, they played the New York Knicks, who were now coached by Pat Riley and won in seven games. Then they played the Cleveland Cavaliers, whom they had beaten in two prior postseason meetings, in the conference finals. The Bulls won in six games.\nPortland Trail Blazers.\nThe previous season, Portland was coming off a Finals loss to the Detroit Pistons. The 1990–91 Trail Blazers won a franchise record 63 games and, as the top seed in the Western Conference, appeared destined to meet the Bulls for the championship. However, the Los Angeles Lakers upended the narrative, defeating Portland in six games of the conference final. However, the Lakers would lose to the Chicago Bulls in the Finals. Of note, the upset marked a final hurrah for the \"Showtime\"-era Lakers, as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar had retired two years prior, and Magic Johnson would retire unexpectedly in the first week of the 1991–92 season, after learning he had tested positive for HIV.\nFor the 1991–92 season, the Blazers retained the same core from the previous two seasons; the team won the Pacific Division title with a 57–25 record. In the first round of the playoffs, they avenged the previous year's loss, dispatching a weakened Lakers team, 3–1. Portland followed that up with a five-game defeat of the Phoenix Suns in the second round, before booking another trip to the Finals with a six-game elimination of the Utah Jazz in the conference Finals.\nRegular season series.\nThe Chicago Bulls won both games in the regular season series:\nSeries summary.\nGame 1.\nMichael Jordan dominated from the beginning, breaking the record for most points in a first half in the playoffs once held by Elgin Baylor (Michael had 35, Baylor had 33). This included six first-half threes (also a record). It was after the sixth three-pointer that Jordan turned towards the broadcast table and famously shrugged to indicate his surprise. Jordan's shrug became a highlight reel mainstay. Portland held their final lead at 45–44 in the second quarter before Chicago went on a 22–6 run to grab a 66–51 halftime lead and take control. The Bulls finished with a 122–89 win over the Portland Trail Blazers.\nGame 2.\nWith the Chicago Blackhawks playing for the Stanley Cup when the Bulls reached the Finals, Game 2 would have had conflict with Game 6 of the Blackhawks' series, as both teams would have played on the same day at Chicago Stadium. However, the Blackhawks series ended in 4 games, so no rescheduling was needed.\nPortland built an eight-point lead in the first quarter, and held a nine-point lead at the half. However, as in Game 1, their lead started to disappear as the Bulls made their run – Jordan scored 14 points while Paxson scored 9, taking a seven-point lead by the end of the third quarter. Chicago was looking to take a commanding 2–0 lead in the series when Clyde Drexler fouled out with 4:36 remaining. With the Bulls up by 10, Jordan started to lose his poise, committing a foul and then a technical foul. This helped Portland build a 15–5 run, pushing the game into overtime after Jordan narrowly missed at the buzzer. In overtime, Portland dominated, especially Ainge, who scored six points with one minute remaining as the Blazers won 115–104 – the Bulls' worst home defeat in an NBA Finals game.\nGame 3.\nChicago had lost home court advantage, but dominated Portland, holding them to numerous franchise playoff lows: 84 points in a game, 39 second-half points and 28 field goals. Chicago would go on a 30–13 run in the first half to gain a 44–30 lead which Portland would cut to three with 7:09 left in the third before the Bulls went to another 12–3 run. Portland would then go on a field goal drought, not scoring from the 4:33 mark in the third quarter until the 9:36 mark of the fourth, a 6:57 stretch.\nGame 4.\nPortland was still playing as they were during Game 3, not scoring for four minutes and finding themselves down 10–0. The Bulls were up 22–9 before the Blazers rallied and cut the deficit to three at the half, but found themselves down again in the third quarter. While Jordan scored 13 points in the third quarter, he would not score in the game's final 10:26. Portland went on a 15–6 run to even the series at two games apiece.\nGame 5.\nThe Bulls jumped out to a 10–2 lead and never looked back, answering every Blazers comeback attempt with a run of their own. Chicago opened the second half on a 16–8 run to give the Bulls a 20-point lead. Portland didn't pull back within single digits until less than four minutes were left in the game, and ended up losing 119–106.\nMichael Jordan, who briefly sat with a bad ankle, finished with 46 points on 14-of-23 from the field and 16-of-19 from the line. Scottie Pippen fell just short of a triple-double, with 24 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists. Clyde Drexler scored 30 points to lead six Portland players in double figures. However, Portland had 18 turnovers and shot just 43.8 percent from the field, compared to 54.8 percent for the Bulls.\nGame 6.\nPortland started strongly as they held Michael Jordan scoreless for the game's first 11 minutes, and took a 43–28 lead midway through the second quarter before Chicago went on a 16–7 run and cut the deficit to only six points. Portland also dominated the third quarter, building a 79–64 lead. Phil Jackson went with four reserves and Scottie Pippen to start the fourth quarter, cutting Portland's lead to three after only three minutes. Jordan returned and had two steals and converted them to hoops to give Chicago a permanent lead. With 11.8 seconds left and the Bulls up by 2, Jordan virtually clinched the title by hitting 2 free throws bringing him to 12 points in the fourth quarter. Kersey then missed a 3 which was rebounded by Paxson who dribbled out the clock. The Bulls' defense held Portland to only six points in the final four minutes, leading the Bulls to their second straight championship. Jordan finished with 33 points and was named Finals MVP for the second consecutive year.\nMedia coverage.\nNBC Sports used commentator Marv Albert, analysts Mike Fratello and Magic Johnson, and sideline reporter Ahmad Rashad (both teams' sidelines). Bob Costas and Quinn Buckner hosted the pre-game, halftime and postgame reports.\nJust months later, the 1991–92 NBA season documentary \"Untouchabulls\" was released. Narrated by Hal Douglas, it recaps the Bulls' championship season. \"Jam\" by Michael Jackson was used as the theme song for the documentary. That same year, Jordan was featured in Jackson's music video for \"Jam\".\nAftermath.\nThe Bulls won their third straight championship in the season, winning 57 games and defeating the Phoenix Suns in the 1993 NBA Finals. In the offseason that preceded Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen played for the Dream Team that won the gold medal in the Barcelona Olympics, making them the first players to win NBA championship and Olympic gold medal in the same year (Pippen would achieve this feat again in 1996, and LeBron James would accomplish this in 2012). That team also included Blazers guard Clyde Drexler. This made Jordan, Patrick Ewing of the New York Knicks and Chris Mullin of the Golden State Warriors the only players to have won Olympic gold medals as both amateurs and professionals, having played for Team USA in Los Angeles.\nThe 1992 Finals would prove the Blazers' last Finals appearance . In the next three seasons, the Blazers rebuilt the team, hiring general manager Bob Whitsitt in 1994 and lost the core of their 1992 Finals team to free agency and trades, beginning with Kevin Duckworth's departure to the Bullets in the 1993 offseason. The last remaining piece of the team, Clyde Drexler, was traded and went on to win the NBA championship with the Houston Rockets in .\nThe 1991–92 Bulls, along with the 1995–96 Bulls, were named one of the 10 greatest teams in NBA history during the league's golden anniversary.\nThe 1992 championship marked the only time the Bulls celebrated their title at the Chicago Stadium. Following the awarding ceremony by commissioner David Stern, they returned to the court to show their newly won title in front of Bulls fans. This act eventually led to Stern's decision to present the NBA championship to the winning team at center court in front of the fans, starting in ; the only exception was when the Lakers won in at Philadelphia's First Union Center, but decided to hold the ceremony in their locker room. Two other home championship celebrations followed in the and Finals, this time at the similarly-constructed but bigger United Center."

        "title": "1991 NBA Finals",
        "text": "The 1991 NBA Finals was the championship round of the 1990–91 National Basketball Association (NBA) season, and the conclusion of the season's playoffs. It was also the first NBA Finals broadcast by NBC after 17 years with CBS.\nThe Eastern Conference champion Chicago Bulls took on the Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers for the title, with Chicago having home court advantage. It was Michael Jordan's first NBA Finals appearance, Magic Johnson's last, and the last NBA Finals for the Lakers until 2000. The Bulls would win the series, 4–1. Jordan averaged 31.2 points on 56% shooting, 11.4 assists, 6.6 rebounds, 2.8 steals and 1.4 blocks en route to his first NBA Finals MVP Award.\nThe series was not the first time that the Bulls and Lakers faced off in the playoffs. Prior to 1991, they met for four postseason series (1968, 1971, 1972 and 1973), all Lakers victories. Chicago was a member of the Western Conference at the time and moved into the East in 1980. The 1991 Finals marked the first time the Bulls defeated the Lakers in a playoff series.\nThis series would mark the end of the Lakers Showtime era and the beginning of the Bulls' dynasty. After winning five championships in eight finals appearances in the 1980s, the Lakers would struggle for the rest of the 1990s before winning five championships between the 2000 and 2010 seasons.\nThe 1991 Lakers were led by Johnson, who was 31 and playing in what would be his last full season, as well as fellow All-Star teammate James Worthy; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar had retired two seasons earlier. The Bulls, led by Jordan and small forward Scottie Pippen, would win five more championships after 1991 in a seven-year span, cementing their status as a dynasty. Jordan became only the fourth player in NBA history (after Joe Fulks, George Mikan, and Abdul-Jabbar) to capture the scoring title and a championship in the same season.\nBackground.\nChicago Bulls.\nThe 1990–91 season marked the Bulls' 25th in franchise history. The team was coming off a grueling seven-game loss to the Detroit Pistons in the 1990 Eastern Conference Finals, and in the six years since Michael Jordan joined the Bulls, they were showing signs of improvement.\nThey managed to put it all together that season, winning a then-franchise record 61 games. Jordan won the scoring title for a fifth consecutive season, but the team was no longer a one-man show of years past. Instead, Jordan distributed the ball with regularity, thanks in large part to the triangle offense instituted by head coach Phil Jackson and assistant Tex Winter. This gave the Bulls additional offensive weapons to choose from, ranging from wingman Scottie Pippen and post players Horace Grant and Bill Cartwright to shooters such as John Paxson and B. J. Armstrong. Jordan's improved all-around play earned him his second MVP award.\nIn the playoffs, the Bulls lost only once in the first three rounds. They swept the New York Knicks in the first round, then eliminated the Philadelphia 76ers in the second round. Their much-awaited rematch with the Detroit Pistons in the Conference Finals showcased the maturity and poise that the Bulls displayed all season, as they swept the Pistons. In a last show of defiance, most of the Pistons walked off the court with :08 left on the clock in a blowout loss at home so as not to congratulate the new Eastern Conference champions, though Joe Dumars, Vinnie Johnson, and John Salley did remain to shake the Bulls' hands.\nLos Angeles Lakers.\nThe Lakers were coming off a second-round loss to the Phoenix Suns in prior season's playoffs. Even though the Lakers won 63 games that season, and Magic Johnson won league MVP and surpassed Oscar Robertson for the all-time career assist record, it was clear that the team was growing weary of head coach Pat Riley's intense approach.\nThe Lakers replaced Riley with Mike Dunleavy, Sr., formerly an assistant coach with the Milwaukee Bucks. Dunleavy then abandoned the trademark Showtime offense in favor of a more deliberate style of play, but despite the change in playbook, the Lakers still enjoyed an impressive season, winning 58 games.\nIn the playoffs, the Lakers swept the Houston Rockets in the first round, then eliminated Run TMC and the Golden State Warriors in the second round. Next up for the Lakers were the Portland Trail Blazers, who were coming off a trip to the NBA finals the previous year. The Lakers stunned the Blazers in Portland to open the series, and went on to win the conference finals in six games.\nRegular season series.\nBoth teams split the two meetings, each won by the home team:\nSeries summary.\nGame 1.\nMichael Jordan started dominating with 15 points, 3 rebounds and 5 assists in the first quarter alone. In the second quarter, the Lakers continued to stay competitive despite Magic Johnson not attempting one field goal in the second quarter. Despite this, Magic Johnson would hit back-to-back 3 pointers in the third quarter to give the Lakers their largest lead, and also Magic Johnson's 29th career playoff triple-double. Jordan made a comeback in the fourth quarter with 13 points, but it was Scottie Pippen's two free throws that would give the Bulls a 91–89 lead. Each team ran the shot clock down but neither could hit a shot until Sam Perkins hit a 3-pointer (the potential game winner) with 14 seconds left to give the Lakers a 92–91 lead. Michael Jordan's 17-foot jumper then rattled out and was rebounded by Byron Scott, who was fouled with 2.7 seconds remaining. Scott missed the first of his two free throws and made the second for a 93–91 Lakers lead. The Bulls, out of timeouts, had a final chance, but a midcourt heave from Pippen at the buzzer caromed off the back of the rim.\nThis was also the last time any game of the NBA Finals aired in the afternoon (Eastern Time Zone), with every game of the NBA Finals since this game in 1991 airing in prime time, including all weekend games. To date, this is the most recent time any finals game in any of the four major American sports leagues started before 6:00 p.m. Eastern.\nGame 2.\nThe biggest decision of the game was putting Scottie Pippen on Magic Johnson, while Michael Jordan guarded Vlade Divac. For the Bulls, the hero was Horace Grant who led the Bulls with 14 first half points, while Jordan only had 2 points for the first 20 minutes; however, for Jordan, this shooting drought would only prove to be temporary and Jordan would hit his next 13 shots in compensation. The Lakers were in the game even when Chicago was leading 58–51 until Byron Scott fouled Pippen, and the Bulls would make 17 of their next 20 field goals in the third quarter despite Jordan spending time on the bench with foul trouble. By the time Jordan returned, their lead was 16 and then Jordan led the Bulls to an 11–0 run to a Bulls victory. The signature moment of the series came when Jordan accelerated towards the basket, raised the ball in his right hand for a dunk, then, to avoid a potential Sam Perkins block, switched the ball to his left and banked in a layup that caused a booming standing ovation at Chicago Stadium.\nGame 3.\nThe Bulls were having trouble in the frontcourt (in Game 1, the Lakers frontcourt outscored Chicago's 60–31). In Game 3, the Lakers would be the ones having trouble, setting a rebounding low in the Finals. Despite this problem, the Lakers went for an 18–2 run that brought them from 3 down (49–52) to 13 up (67–54). The Bulls would answer with a 20–7 run that would tie the game in the 4th quarter at 74. Horace Grant's layup gave the Bulls a 90–87 lead with 1:07 to play. Perkins then scored to cut the Bulls' lead to 90–89 with 49 seconds left. After a Bulls' miss, Divac scored on a layup and was fouled. He made the free throw to give the Lakers a 92–90 lead with 10.9 seconds remaining. Jordan made a 14-foot jump shot just inches away from Divac's fingertips with 3.4 seconds left to tie the game at 92 and force overtime. In overtime, Jordan would score half of the Bulls' 12 points to win the game.\nGame 4.\nThe Lakers had a 28–27 lead in the first quarter; only the second time in the 1991 playoffs that a team led the Bulls at the end of the first quarter. This did not matter as Chicago went on a 19–9 run to start the second period and gain a 46–37 lead. While Michael Jordan scored 11 points in the second quarter, the Lakers only made 12 of their 41 shots in the second and third quarters. The Lakers faced a huge blow as Worthy and Scott left the game (and eventually the series) with ankle and shoulder injuries, respectively (Worthy's ankle injury from the Conference Finals against Portland had flared up, and Scott injured his shoulder after slipping on a wet spot on the floor). With the lack of Worthy and Scott, and bad shooting (especially from Sam Perkins), the Bulls were able to take a 16-point lead in the third quarter. The Lakers refused to go down and shrank the deficit to 7 points in the fourth quarter, but it was the closest they would get, as Pippen and Jordan led the Bulls on a 19–8 run to put them one game away from their first NBA Championship.\nGame 5.\nThe Lakers were facing elimination, and the absences of James Worthy and Byron Scott were not any help to the Lakers. This would not stop Magic Johnson as Johnson had 20 assists in the game. Despite that while Johnson also got 11 rebounds, Jordan guarded Magic Johnson in Game 5 which led Magic to struggle by scoring 16 points on 33% (4/12) shooting with 6 turnovers. Elden Campbell outscored Michael Jordan with 13 points in the first half. The Lakers still fought and even led 93–90 in the fourth quarter, but the Bulls went on a 9–0 run, and Paxson's 10 points in the final half of the fourth quarter helped secure the Chicago Bulls', and Jordan's, first NBA title. It was the only one of the Bulls' six Finals appearances to end in four games to one. This was also the last NBA Finals game to be played in The Forum (by the time the Lakers returned to the NBA Finals, they had moved to the new Staples Center).\nScottie Pippen led the Bulls with 32 points and collected 13 rebounds. Jordan, who was named the Finals MVP, added 30 points and 10 assists.\nMedia coverage.\nAs previously stated, this was the first Finals to be telecast in the United States by NBC. NBC Sports used Marv Albert on play-by-play and Mike Fratello as color analyst. Ahmad Rashad (for the Bulls) and Steve \"Snapper\" Jones (for the Lakers) served as sideline reporters.\nThis was the only NBA Finals series in which recently departed Lakers coach Pat Riley worked as a broadcaster; he was paired with Bob Costas in the pre-game, half-time and post-game presentations. Riley was then hired as head coach by the New York Knicks in the 1991 offseason and would eventually win another title with the Miami Heat in 2006.\nIn Chicago, this was Jim Durham's only Finals appearance as the Bulls' radio announcer (he also announced Bulls games on television via simulcast during the regular season and playoffs). He would later announce several NBA Finals games on ESPN Radio. Neil Funk succeeded Durham the following season and was the radio voice on five NBA Finals involving the Bulls (1992, 1993, 1996, 1997 and 1998). The simulcasts would also end after the season, with Wayne Larrivee (on WGN-TV) and Tom Dore (on cable) becoming the Bulls' television announcers the next season; by the 2008–09 NBA season Funk was calling television play-by-play on both networks while Chuck Swirsky called radio play-by-play. This was also the only NBA Finals to feature Johnny Kerr on color commentary, as he would become exclusive to television after the Finals.\nAftermath.\nThe Bulls championship started the dynasty that lasted through the 1990s. In the 1991-92 NBA season the Bulls won their second straight NBA title, winning a then-franchise record 67 wins and defeated the Portland Trail Blazers in six games of the 1992 NBA Finals.\nThe Lakers' Showtime era would end on November 7, 1991, as Magic Johnson announced his retirement due to the HIV virus. He did, however, play in the 1992 NBA All-Star Game and eventually with the Dream Team in the 1992 Summer Olympics. The Lakers would decline in the years following Magic's retirement, being eliminated in the first round of the playoffs two straight years (1992 – 1993) before missing the playoffs entirely in 1994. It would be nine years before the Lakers returned to the NBA Finals; by then they had moved to the new Staples Center (now Crypto.com Arena), marking the 1991 Finals the last to be held at the Forum.\nBoth teams came close to facing each other anew in the 1998 NBA Finals; however, the Lakers (by then led by Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant) were swept by the Utah Jazz in the Western Conference Finals.\nThe Chicago and Los Angeles have been Major professional sports leagues for the other sports league. The MLB's Chicago White Sox and Los Angeles Angels in 2005 ALCS. With the White Sox win over Angels in 5 games. While Chicago Cubs and Los Angeles Dodgers have three postseason meetings in 2008, 2016 and 2017. The NHL's Chicago Blackhawks and Los Angeles Kings have three playoff meetings in 1974, 2013 and 2014."

        "text": "James Edward \"Tip\" O'Neill (May 15, 1860 – December 31, 1915) was a Canadian professional baseball player from approximately 1875 to 1892. He began playing organized baseball in Woodstock, Ontario, Canada, and later played ten seasons in Major League Baseball, principally as a left fielder, but also as a pitcher, for four major league clubs.\nWhile playing with the St. Louis Browns (later renamed The St. Louis Cardinals) from 1884 to 1889, O'Neill helped the club compile a 516–247 record while also winning four pennants and the 1886 World Series. O'Neill won two American Association batting championships during those years and became the second person in major league history to hit for a triple crown, leading the league in 1887 with a .435 batting average, 14 home runs and 123 runs batted in (RBIs). He also rewrote the major league record book, establishing new records in at least eight categories, including the highest batting average (originally .492, adjusted to .435), on-base percentage (.490) and slugging percentage (.691), and the most hits (225), runs scored (167), doubles (52), extra base hits (84), and total bases (357) in a single season. His adjusted .435 batting average in 1887 remains the second highest in major league history.\nO'Neill, dubbed \"Canada's Babe Ruth\", was posthumously inducted into both the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame and the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame. Each year since 1984, the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame has presented the Tip O'Neill Award to the best Canadian baseball player.\nEarly years.\nO'Neill was born in 1860 at Springfield, Ontario, Canada, a village in Southwestern Ontario that was later incorporated into the city of Malahide. While O'Neill was a boy, his family moved approximately 30 miles northeast to Woodstock, Ontario, where his parents operated a hotel.\nProfessional baseball player.\nMinor leagues.\nIn 1875, O'Neill began playing organized baseball in Woodstock, Ontario, Canada, and became known as \"The Woodstock Wonder.\" He also traveled with barnstorming teams. In 1881, he reportedly played in Detroit, and in 1882, he played for the New York Metropolitans in the League Alliance.\nNew York Gothams.\nO'Neill made his major league debut on May 5, 1883, as a pitcher for New York Gothams (later renamed the Giants) of the National League. Shortly after his major league debut, \"Sporting Life\" wrote: \"O'Neill, the New York change pitcher, seems to have but one element of effectiveness in his delivery, viz.: fast and slow. This is a very weak reliance nowadays, as batsmen have only to note the speed of the ball and wait for a good one. O'Neill's delivery is wild and erratic -- hard work for the catcher and busy work for the field.\" O'Neill appeared in 19 games as a starting pitcher for the Gothams and compiled a win–loss record of 5–12 and a 4.07 earned run average (ERA).\nSt. Louis Browns.\n1884 season.\nIn 1884, O'Neill joined Charlie Comiskey's St. Louis Browns (later renamed the Cardinals) of the American Association. He was signed by Comiskey to replace pitcher Tony Mullane, who left the Browns after the 1883 season. O'Neill compiled an 11–4 win–loss record with a 2.68 ERA and led the league with a .733 winning percentage as pitcher. However, his arm reportedly \"went back on him\" during the 1884 season, requiring him to switch from pitching to playing in the outfield. He ended up playing 64 games as an outfielder in 1884 and was exclusively an outfielder thereafter.\n1885 season.\nIn 1885, O'Neill missed much of the season, suffering an injury on June 10 and not returning to the lineup until September 3. Despite the injury, O'Neill established himself as the Browns' best batter, hitting .350 in 52 games, nearly 80 points higher than any other player on the team. The 1885 Browns won the American Association pennant with a 79-33 record and tied the Chicago White Stockings in the 1885 World Series. O'Neill scored four runs but hit .208 in his first World Series.\n1886 season.\nO'Neill played his first full season as a position player in 1886 and became one of the most valuable players in baseball. He appeared in 138 games, all as an outfielder, and led the league with 107 runs batted in (RBIs). He was also among the league leaders with a .328 batting average (5th), .385 on-base percentage (5th), .440 slugging percentage (6th), 190 hits (2nd), 255 total bases (2nd), 45 extra base hits (5th), and a 4.9 Wins Above Replacement (WAR) rating (2nd among position players).\nO'Neill's hitting helped lead the Browns to the American Association pennant with a 93-46 record. The team also went on to defeat the Chicago White Stockings of the National League in the 1886 World Series. O'Neill hit .400 with a .500 on-base percentage, five runs scored, five RBIs, two home runs and two stolen bases in the World Series.\n1887 season.\nIn 1887, O'Neill rewrote the major league batting record book in just 124 games. That year, he won the American Association triple crown with a .435 batting average, 14 home runs and 123 RBIs. His batting average was originally recorded at .492, bases on balls having been counted as hits during that season. At the time of his death in 1915, his unadjusted .492 average was recorded as the highest in major league history. Subsequently, batting averages for the 1887 season were adjusted by removing bases on balls from the calculations. Even after that adjustment, O'Neill's 1887 batting average of .435 was a major league record until 1894 when Hugh Duffy established the current major league record by hitting .440. O'Neill's adjusted average for 1887 remains the second highest single season batting average in major league history.\nO'Neill's batting performance in 1887 also established new single season, major league records in at least seven other categories, including the highest on-base percentage (.490), slugging percentage (.691), most hits (225), runs scored (167), doubles (52), and extra base hits (84), and total bases (357). He also led all position players across Major League Baseball in 1887 with a 6.9 WAR rating.\nO'Neill's hitting in 1887 helped lead the Browns to their third consecutive American Association pennant with a 95-40 record. The Browns lost the 1887 World Series to the Detroit Wolverines, as O'Neill hit .200 in 65 at bats against Detroit's pitching in the World Series.\n1888 season.\nIn 1888, O'Neill won his second consecutive American Association batting title by hitting .335. He also ranked among the league leaders in multiple hitting categories for the third consecutive year with a .390 on-base percentage (2nd), .446 slugging percentage (3rd), 177 hits (1st), 236 total bases (3rd), 98 RBIs (4th), and 225 times on base (3rd).\nWith O'Neill again leading the club in hitting, the Browns won their fourth consecutive pennant in 1888 with a 92-43 record. The Browns lost the 1888 World Series to the New York Giants, though O'Neill compiled a .349 on-base percentage with eight runs, 11 RBIs and two home runs in his final World Series.\n1889 season.\nO'Neill had his fifth consecutive strong season as a batter in 1889. He appeared in 134 games in the outfield and compiled a .335 batting average, the second highest in the American Association. He again ranked among the league leaders in multiple batting categories with a .419 on-base percentage (4th), .478 slugging percentage (4th), 179 hits (4th), 255 total bases (3rd), 33 doubles (4th), nine home runs (5th), 110 RBIs (3rd), and 50 extra base hits (3rd). The Browns compiled a 90-45 record in 1889 but finished in second place, two games behind the Brooklyn Bridegrooms.\nIn O'Neill's first six seasons with the Browns from 1884 to 1889, he appeared in 656 games, scored 585 runs, compiled a WAR rating of 22.5, and hit .347 with a .407 on-base percentage, .498 slugging percentage, 925 hits, and 538 RBIs. During those six seasons, he was the Browns' dominant hitter and helped the club win four pennants and compile a record of 516 wins and 247 losses.\nChicago Pirates.\nO'Neill followed Charlie Comiskey to the Players' League in 1890, appearing in 137 games as an outfielder for Comiskey's Chicago Pirates. He hit .302 in the Players' League with a .377 on-base percentage. He led the league in games played and ranked second with 647 plate appearances and seventh with 174 hits and 244 times on base.\nReturn to St. Louis.\nO'Neill followed Comiskey back to the Browns in 1891. He appeared in 127 games in the outfield and was among the league leaders with a .323 batting average (3rd), .404 on-base percentage (6th), .451 slugging percentage (8th), 166 hits (6th), 232 total bases (6th), 28 doubles (3rd), 10 home runs (4th), 95 RBIs (6th) and 42 extra base hits (8th).\nCincinnati Reds.\nIn 1892, Charlie Comiskey jumped to the Cincinnati Reds of the National League, and O'Neill again followed Comiskey. In nine of ten years of O'Neill's career, he played on teams managed by Comiskey. O'Neill appeared in 109 games as an outfielder for the Reds in 1892. At the start of spring training, Ban Johnson, then the Cincinnati correspondent to \"The Sporting News\", expressed hope that O'Neill would help the Reds to a pennant: \"Tip O'Neill is big, hearty and strong, and gives promise of doing great things for the club in the near-approaching campaign for pennant honors.\" However, his batting average in 1892 dropped 72 points from the prior season to .251, his lowest season since his rookie year as a pitcher in 1883. O'Neill began the season slow, but in mid-May, Comiskey expressed confidence that O'Neill would \"come back to his old form after a while.\" The following month, the New York \"Sun\" reported that O'Neill was one of the most frequent recipients of Comiskey's mid-game \"lecture, without any curtain.\" By mid-July, \"The Sporting Life\" reported: \"Tip O'Neill has lately been playing so poorly that the Cincinnati cranks have soured on him.\" He appeared in his last major league game on August 30, 1892, at age 34.\nIn December 1892, Comiskey told \"The Sporting News\" that O'Neill had left the club without permission and had not been heard from since. However, Comiskey added: \"If he can play ball for me as well as he did at St. Louis I should like to have him. Last year Tip was in poor health, and that is the reason I assigned for his weak stick work.\"\nCareer statistics.\nOver 10 major league seasons, O'Neill appeared in 1,052 games (1,022 as an outfielder) and made 4,712 plate appearances and compiled a .326 batting average, .392 on-base percentage, and .458 slugging percentage. He totaled 879 runs scored, 1,385 hits, 222 doubles, 92 triples, 52 home runs, 757 RBIs, 161 stolen bases, 420 bases on balls, and 1,947 total bases.\nO'Neill is one of only 15 players in baseball history to have won the Major League Baseball Triple Crown. Of the 14 triple crown winners who are eligible for the Baseball Hall of Fame (Miguel Cabrera is not yet eligible), O'Neill and Paul Hines are the only two who have not been inducted. At the end of the 2013 season, O'Neill's .326 career batting average was the 36th highest in major league history. Of the 35 players with higher career batting averages than O'Neill, only five eligible players (Dave Orr [.342], Pete Browning [.341], Jake Stenzel [.337], Riggs Stephenson [.336] and Mike Donlin [.332]) have not been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.\nLater years and honours.\nShortly after O'Neill retired from baseball, \"The Sporting Life\" reported in July 1893 that he was \"making book\" at Sheepshead Bay, a horse racing track in New York City. He also worked as a \"big league umpire\" and as a scout for various baseball clubs, including the Chicago White Sox. He moved to Montreal, Quebec where he lived with his brother and assisted in acquiring a minor league baseball club for the city.\nOn New Year's Eve 1915, O'Neill died suddenly at age 55 while riding on a Montreal streetcar. The cause of death was an \"attack of heart disease.\" He was buried at St. Mary Cemetery in Woodstock, Ontario.\nIn 1983, O'Neill was posthumously honoured as one of the first inductees of the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame. The Canadian Hall each year presents the Tip O'Neill Award in his honour to \"the player judged to have excelled in individual achievement and team contribution while adhering to baseball's highest ideals.\"\nA municipal baseball field in Woodstock, Ontario is named Tip O'Neill Field in his honour.\nJames \"Tip\" O'Neill was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 1997.\nOther \"Tip\" O'Neills.\nDuring the late 19th century and early 20th century, there were several other athletes who went by the name \"Tip\" O'Neill. In 1898, O'Neill wrote to \"The Sporting Life\" to correct a report that he was managing a baseball team in Montgomery, Alabama. He noted: \"It seems strange that every ball player whose name happens to be O'Neill should call himself Tip. One Tip died in London, Can., a few years ago, and when I would meet friends that I had not met for some time they would take me for a ghost. The Chicago \"Record\" last spring had me dying of consumption.\"\nThe confusion of \"Tip\" O'Neills continues as some sources erroneously state that O'Neill served as the president of the Western League, a minor league based in the Midwestern United States. To the contrary, the individual who served as president of the Western League was Norris \"Tip\" O'Neill.\nYears later, the future American politician and Speaker of the House, Thomas \"Tip\" O'Neill (1912–1994), was given the nickname \"Tip\" as a boy, due to his shared surname with the 19th century baseball player.\nExternal links.\n, or Retrosheet"

        "title": "Intercolonial cricket in Australia",
        "text": "Intercolonial cricket matches were the first-class cricket matches played between the various colonies of Australia prior to federation in 1901. After federation, they became known as \"Interstate\" matches. By the 1880s regular intercolonials were being played, generally with intense rivalry. Matches against visiting professional teams from England also attracted public interest.\nThe beginnings.\nIn March 1850, the Melbourne Cricket Club issued a challenge to the Launceston Cricket Club for a match between representative cricketers of Port Phillip district (to become Victoria the following year) and Van Diemen's Land (to become Tasmania in 1856). Launceston sent an acceptance, but it was not received in time and so a new challenge was issued and accepted for the following 1850-51 season. Meanwhile, news that legislation for the long-awaited separation of the Port Phillip district from New South Wales had been passed in England was received which prompted a declaration by the Superintendent of the Port Phillip District, Charles La Trobe, for celebrations from November 1850. This legislation and the enabling legislation which was passed in New South Wales on 1 July 1851 created the Colony of Victoria, of which La Trobe later become the first Lieutenant-Governor. The long anticipated cricket match was considered to be a significant part of the euphoric mood within the Victorian colony at the time.\nThe match finally commenced on 11 February 1851 at the Launceston Racecourse, later to become the Northern Tasmania Cricket Association Ground. The first ball was bowled (underarm) by William Henty for the Launcestonians, to Duncan Cooper of Port Phillip. About 2500 people watched the locals win the match by three wickets.\nThe following February, nine Tasmanians sailed to Melbourne and joined with three Melbourne based Launcestonians for a return match which was held at the Emerald Hill Ground on the south bank of the Yarra River, which was the then home ground of the Melbourne Cricket Club. The Victorians won this by 61 runs. Possibly due to distractions from the discovery of gold in Victoria in 1851, the deciding match was not held until March 1854. The MCC moved to the present Melbourne Cricket Ground in September 1853.\nNew South Wales at the MCG.\nAfter issuing a \"challenge to all-comers\" with a £500 purse in 1855, Victoria hosted its first big game in March 1856 against New South Wales at the newly occupied Melbourne Cricket Ground. Initially the purse was to be played for, but the New South Welshmen had declined this as they were uncertain of their ability to match the bet. It was a low scoring match in which 5000 people watched the first day's play which included a dramatic batting collapse by the locals who were all out for 63 in their first innings. NSW made 76 in their first innings and Victoria followed with a paltry 28. NSW lost seven wickets in making the required 16 runs. The match was also notable for a dispute which arose after the umpires had tossed and which Victoria had won. New South Wales insisted that, as the visiting team, they had the choice of batting or bowling. Victoria eventually relented and were sent in.\nEnglish tours.\nIn March 1861 the first visiting English side toured Australia, dominated by Surrey players. This tour was followed by another in 1863-64, led by George Parr and including the amateur EM Grace. In 1876-77 James Lillywhite brought a professional tour out to Australia which played New South Wales in a two-day match at the Albert Ground in Sydney on 15 &amp; 16 January 1877. This was followed by a timeless match at the MCG commencing on 15 March 1877 which was later designated as the first Test, played between Australia and England.\nAttendance at some of these touring matches were similar to the intercolonials which suggests that the local competition was fairly well supported and that there was a healthy intercolonial rivalry. Regular fixtures of New South Wales v. Victoria and Victoria v. Tasmania continued until 1875 with at least one match per season being played.\nIn 1877-78, South Australia played Tasmania for the first time in a match at the newly created Adelaide Oval in which the attendance of 1870 over two days saw South Australia win comfortably by an innings and 13 runs. The following season saw the infamous Sydney Riot of 1879, in which the visiting English team of Lord Harris was faced by a pitch invasion whilst playing New South Wales at the Sydney Cricket Ground. The cause of the riot is at least partly attributed to the rivalry between Victoria and NSW, as Victoria had supplied the umpire to the English team and an unfavourable decision by him against the local team had incensed the crowd.\nSheffield Shield.\nIn 1891-1892 the Earl of Sheffield was in Australia as the promoter of an English team led by W. G. Grace. The tour included three Tests played in Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide. At the conclusion of the tour, Sheffield donated £150 to fund a trophy for an annual tournament of intercolonial cricket in Australia. After his departure there was some debate between the organising committees in South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales about how to use the donation, including serious consideration of a proposal to split the money between the committees of the three colonies. This was rejected.\nUltimately a new tournament was decided upon and named the Sheffield Shield in honour of its benefactor. It commenced in the 1892-93 season between New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. That season also marked the inclusion of Queensland and Western Australia in the intercolonial matches, though they were not admitted to the Shield competition until much later. 4500 people watched Queensland win by 14 runs in its first intercolonial against New South Wales at the Exhibition Ground in Brisbane and Western Australia played its first intercolonial against South Australia in Adelaide. The Western Australians had a miserable tour with a loss to South Australia in Adelaide, being beaten by 10 wickets and a loss to Victoria at the MCG by an innings and 243 runs. The Sheffield Shield competition was effectively played in parallel with other intercolonial matches as Tasmania, Queensland and Western Australia did not join the Sheffield Shield competition until well into the 20th century.\nAs well as matches between two colonies, frequent combined team matches, (and also classified as first-class) were played such as \"Smokers v Non-Smokers\", \"Australian XI v Combined XI\" and \"New South Wales and Victoria v Australian XI\".\nFrom the second Shield competition in 1893/94 each of the Shield teams were playing each other twice each season, both home and away. This format continues today, though with six teams the season now contains 31 matches, including the final.\nTeams.\nVictoria.\nThe Melbourne Cricket Club (MCC) was formed in 1838, within three years of the establishment of the colony. Early Victorian teams were virtually MCC teams. In 1858 The Victorian Intercolonial Cricket Committee was formed by the leading clubs, to arrange and administer matches between the colonies.\nNew South Wales.\nIn 1826 the Australian Cricket Club was formed.\nThe first match between New South Wales and Victoria was played at the Outer Domain, Sydney on 26 March 1856."

        "title": "Cardiac skeleton",
        "text": "In cardiology, the cardiac skeleton, also known as the fibrous skeleton of the heart, is a high-density homogeneous structure of connective tissue that forms and anchors the valves of the heart, and influences the forces exerted by and through them. The cardiac skeleton separates and partitions the atria (the smaller, upper two chambers) from the ventricles (the larger, lower two chambers).The heart's cardiac skeleton comprises four dense connective tissue rings that encircle the mitral and tricuspid atrioventricular (AV) canals and extend to the origins of the pulmonary trunk and aorta. This provides crucial support and structure to the heart while also serving to electrically isolate the atria from the ventricles. \nThe unique matrix of connective tissue within the cardiac skeleton isolates electrical influence within these defined chambers. In normal anatomy, there is only one conduit for electrical conduction from the upper chambers to the lower chambers, known as the atrioventricular node. The physiologic cardiac skeleton forms a firewall governing autonomic/electrical influence until bordering the bundle of His which further governs autonomic flow to the bundle branches of the ventricles. Understood as such, the cardiac skeleton efficiently centers and robustly funnels electrical energy from the atria to the ventricles.\nStructure.\nThe structure of the components of the heart has become an area of increasing interest. The cardiac skeleton binds several bands of dense connective tissue, as collagen, that encircle the bases of the pulmonary trunk, aorta, and all four heart valves. While not a traditionally or \"true\" or rigid skeleton, it does provide structure and support for the heart, as well as isolate the atria from the ventricles. This is why atrial fibrillation almost never degrades to ventricular fibrillation. In youth, this collagen structure is free of calcium adhesions and is quite flexible. With aging, calcium and other mineral accumulation occur within this skeleton. Distensibility of the ventricles is tied to variable accumulation of minerals which also contributes to the delay of the depolarization wave in geriatric patients that can take place from the AV node and the bundle of His.\nFibrous rings.\nThe right and left fibrous rings of heart (\"annuli fibrosi cordis\") surround the atrioventricular and arterial orifices. The right fibrous ring is known as the \"annulus fibrosus dexter cordis\", and the left is known as the \"annulus fibrosus sinister cordis\". The right fibrous trigone is continuous with the central fibrous body. This is the strongest part of the fibrous cardiac skeleton.\nThe upper chambers (atria) and lower (ventricles) are electrically divided by the properties of collagen proteins within the rings. The valve rings, central body, and skeleton of the heart consisting of collagen are impermeable to electrical propagation. The only channel allowed (barring accessory/rare preexcitation channels) through this collagen barrier is represented by a sinus that opens up to the atrioventricular node and exits to the bundle of His. The muscle origins/insertions of many of the cardiomyocytes are anchored to opposite sides of the valve rings.\nThe atrioventricular rings serve for the attachment of the muscular fibers of the atria and ventricles, and for the attachment of the bicuspid and tricuspid valves.\nThe left atrioventricular ring is closely connected, by its right margin, with the aortic arterial ring; between these and the right atrioventricular ring is a triangular mass of fibrous tissue, the fibrous trigone, which represents the \"os cordis\" seen in the heart of some of the larger animals, such as the ox.\nLastly, there is the tendinous band, already referred to, the posterior surface of the conus arteriosus.\nThe fibrous rings surrounding the arterial orifices serve for the attachment of the great vessels and semilunar valves, they are known as The \"aortic annulus\".\nEach ring receives, by its ventricular margin, the attachment of some of the muscular fibers of the ventricles; its opposite margin presents three deep semicircular notches, to which the middle coat of the artery is firmly fixed.\nThe attachment of the artery to its fibrous ring is strengthened by the external coat and serous membrane externally, and by the endocardium internally.\nFrom the margins of the semicircular notches, the fibrous structure of the ring is continued into the segments of the valves.\nThe middle coat of the artery in this situation is thin, and the vessel is dilated to form the sinuses of the aorta and pulmonary artery.\nOs cordis.\nIn some animals, the fibrous trigone can undergo increasing mineralization with age, leading to the formation of a significant \"os cordis\" (heart bone), or two (\"os cordis sinistrum\" and \"os cordis dextrum\", the latter being the larger one). The os cordis is thought to serve mechanical functions.\nIn humans, two paired trigones (left and right) are seen in this essential view of anatomy. As a surgical purchase point, the Trigones risk much in AV propagation.\nIt has been known since Classical times in deer and oxen and was thought to have medicinal properties and mystical properties. It is occasionally observed in goats, but also in other animals such as otters. It was recently also discovered in chimpanzees, the only great ape so far to known to have os cordis. \nAgainst the opinion of his time, Galen wrote that the os cordis was also found in elephants. The claim endured up to the nineteenth century and was still treated as fact in Gray's \"Anatomy\", although it is not the case.\nFunction.\nElectrical signals from the sinoatrial node and the autonomic nervous system must find their way from the upper chambers to the lower ones to ensure that the ventricles can drive the flow of blood. The heart functions as a pump delivering an intermittent volume of blood, incrementally delivered to the lungs, body, and brain.\nThe cardiac skeleton ensures that the electrical and autonomic energy generated above is ushered below and cannot return. The cardiac skeleton does this by establishing an electrically impermeable boundary to autonomic electrical influence within the heart. Simply put, the dense connective tissue within the cardiac skeleton does not conduct electricity and its deposition within the myocardial matrix is not accidental.\nThe anchored and electrically inert collagen framework of the four valves allows normal anatomy to house the atrioventricular node (AV node) in its center. The AV node is the only electrical conduit from the atria to the ventricles through the cardiac skeleton, which is why atrial fibrillation can never degrade into ventricular fibrillation.\nThroughout life, the cardiac collagen skeleton is remodeled. Where collagen is diminished by age, calcium is often deposited, thus allowing readily imaged mathematical markers which are especially valuable in measuring systolic volumetrics. The inert characteristics of the collagen structure that blocks electrical influence also make it difficult to attain an accurate signal for imaging without allowing for an applied ratio of collagen to calcium.\nHistory.\nBoundaries within the heart were first described and greatly magnified by Drs. Charles S. Peskin and David M. McQueen at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences."

Also, Eurosport broadcast the event, marking the first time that the event was broadcast outside the continent. 21 competition venues were used for the Games including the newly constructed Aspire Indoor Sports Complex. The opening and closing ceremonies of the Games were held at Khalifa International Stadium. The trampoline discipline of gymnastics, as well as chess and triathlon made their debut at the Games.\nThe final medal tally was led by China, followed by South Korea and Japan. Qatar finished in ninth place. Tajikistan, Jordan and United Arab Emirates won their first ever Asian Games gold medals. 7 world and 23 Asian records were broken during the games, while South Korean swimmer Park Tae-hwan was announced as the most valuable player.\nBidding process.\nDoha, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur and New Delhi submitted their formal bids by the deadline 30 June 2000. Prior to the voting, evaluation committee of the OCA, headed by the then vice-president of the association Muhammad Latif Butt inspected Doha on 13 and 14 July 2000, New Delhi on 15 and 16 July 2000, Kuala Lumpur on 17 and 18 July 2000, and Hong Kong on 19 and 20 July 2000.\nOn November 12, 2000, voting for the 2006 venue took place during the 19th Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) General Assembly held in Busan, South Korea. The voting involved the 41 members of the Olympic Council of Asia and consisted of three rounds, each round eliminating one of the bidding cities. After the first round, New Delhi was eliminated, with only two votes. The second round of voting, with three remaining candidates, gave Doha as the result.\nUnder the regulations of the OCA, a candidate which gains more than half of the available votes (at least 21 out of 41 votes) will automatically be selected as the host, and the remaining rounds of voting will be cancelled. When Doha gained 22 out of 41 votes this meant they were selected to host the 2006 Asian Games. Most of Qatar's votes came from the unanimous support from West Asian countries.\nAfter the major upset, Malaysia and Hong Kong, China expressed their disappointment. Malaysia said that the selection of Doha was ridiculous and that the selection of Doha was influenced by Qatar's economic wealth.\nDevelopment and preparations.\nCosts.\nQatar spent US$2.8 billion on preparing venues, including a major upgrade to the 50,000-seat Khalifa Stadium from its original 20,000-seat capacity and the construction of the Aspire indoor sports complex, the world's largest indoor multi-sports dome.\nVolunteers.\nVolunteering programme of Doha 2006 Asian Games which began in July 2004 targeted 12,000 volunteers and over 30,000 applications were received. The volunteers wore a specific uniform and are grouped at the Uniform Distribution and Accreditation Centre at the Al-Gharafa SC.\nTorch relay.\nThe torch relay has been integral to the Asian Games since 1958. The plans for the Doha 2006 torch relay were revealed by the Doha Asian Games Organising Committee on 20 January 2006. It engaged EFM Global Logistics to handle all the logistics for the relay.\nThe torch of the 2006 edition weighs 1.5 kilograms and is 72 centimetres tall. Its design was inspired by the curvaceous horns of the Arabian Oryx, featuring maroon and white colours which are the colours of the Qatari national flag. It symbolises the unifying spirit of competition and friendship throughout Asia.\nThe relay itself started on 8 October 2006 with a brief ceremony at the Doha Golf Club where the torch was lit with the theme of \"Flame of Hospitality\". With the involvement of over 3,000 people, the torch crossed eight former Asian Games host cities and the four Gulf Cooperation Council member states. The torch travelled back to Doha held by Sheikh Joan Bin Hamad Al-Thani, and the journey around the city itself started on 25 November 2006 and lasted until the opening ceremony of the Games. The first stop was in New Delhi, the birthplace of the Asian Games on 11 October 2006 where the torch's flame was fused together with the Eternal Asian Games Flame that burn at the Dhyan Chand National Stadium. During the fourth stop in Hiroshima on 21 October, the torch's flame was fused again but now with the Peace flame that burns at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park. In total the relay passed through 13 countries and 23 cities, visited several landmarks such as Taj Mahal and the Great Wall of China along its way to Qatar. The relay, which totaled a distance of 50,000 kilometres in 55 days, was until today, the longest in the history of the Asian Games.\nMarketing.\nEmblem.\nThe emblem of the 15th Asian Games is an image of an athlete in motion which represents fearless manner of a sportsperson in face of challenges and obstacles. The colours used in the emblem represent Qatar's landscape. Yellow represents the crescent-shaped sand dunes of the desert, blue represents the calm sea of the Gulf and red represents the sun and warm spirit of Asia.\nMascot.\nAn Arabian oryx named Orry served as the official mascot of the games. It was unveiled at the Doha waterfront on 1 January 2005 in conjunction with the start of the 700-day countdown to the games. He represents energy, determination, sportsmanship spirit, commitment, enthusiasm, participation, respect, peace and fun; he is also described as a great sportsman.\nMedals.\nThe medals of the games were designed by Dallah advertising and Gulf Media agency. Around 3,000 medals in gold, silver and bronze were made for the games. They featured Orry, the official Games mascot, as well as the Al Zubara Fort on the obverse and the official logo on the reverse.\nPromotion.\nTo promote the games, the organisers built a countdown clock and a giant statue of the official mascot, Orry, at the Doha Corniche. In addition, they also decorated the city with banners and 30 life-size versions of the mascot in a variety of different sporting poses. Touchscreen kiosks were set up at hotels, malls and businesses in the city to provide users with Qatar tourism and the games' information and details. On 3 April 2005, Qatar's flag carrier, Qatar Airways signed a US$10 million agreement with the Doha Asian Games Organising Committee (DAGOC) to become the event's official airline. The airline painted seven of its Airbus A330 in three distinct Asian Games liveries namely blue, red and yellow and produced television commercials and a special 80-page guide on the sporting event in its in-flight magazine \"Oryx\" as part of its Global Advertising Campaign to promote the sporting event.\nMerchandising.\nDuring the games, merchandises were sold at various locations in the city, including competition venues.\nVenues.\nThe Games used mostly new venues within the city. There were a total of 23 venues for the games, with 21 of them being competition venues and others being Main Media Centre and Athletes' village. After a major upgrade, Khalifa Stadium had a new running track, a new tensile fabric roof structure on its western seating and an arch on its east part. A temporary velodrome was built at Aspire Academy for track cycling events.\nThe Athletes’ Village was built on a 330,000 square metres site in the city centre, which had 32 residential buildings with 811 five-bedroom apartments for athletes and 45 for Chef-de-Missions and could accommodate 11,500 athletes and team officials.\nTransport.\nDoha International Airport was expanded with the cost of US$1 billion in the run-up to the games to handle increasing air traffic volume and facilitate an estimated arrival of 10,500 athletes from 45 Asian countries, while Qatar's state-owned public transport service, the Qatar Transport Company (Mowasalat) provided bus, taxi and limousine services in the city to spectators, athletes, officials and volunteers during the games.\nThe Games.\nOpening ceremony.\nThe opening ceremony was viewed by 50,000 spectators in the Khalifa International Stadium, including VIP guests like Jacques Rogge from the International Olympic Committee, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad from Iran, Ismail Haniyeh from Palestine and Bashar al-Assad from Syria. The opening ceremony was directed and produced by the Australian David Atkins, who also helmed the 2000 Summer Olympics opening ceremony in Sydney.\nThe opening ceremony showcased the importance of the culture of the Arab world in the history of Asia and referenced the region's contact with other Asian cultures. Several musical artists such as Hong Kong's Jacky Cheung, India's Bollywood star Sunidhi Chauhan, Lebanon's Majida El Roumi and Spanish tenor José Carreras performed at the ceremony. The ceremony ended with the lighting of the cauldron at the main stadium by Mohammed Bin Hamad Al-Thani, son of the emir and captain of the Qatar equestrian endurance team. At the same time, another cauldron was lit at the top of the Aspire Tower.\nThe games was officially opened by the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani.\nParticipating National Olympic Committees.\nAll 45 OCA members participated in the Games, including Iraq which returned to compete after its suspension was lifted. Iraq last competed at the 1986 Asian Games and was suspended from 1990 until 2004 due to the Gulf War. The number in parentheses indicates the number of participants that the National Olympic Committee contributed.\nSports.\nThe sport events contested at the 2006 Asian Games are listed below. Officially there are 46 disciplines from 39 sports in contention. All events listed started after the opening ceremony except badminton, baseball, basketball, football, table tennis, and volleyball, which had preliminaries before the opening ceremony. Trampoline discipline of gymnastics, and the sports of chess and triathlon made their debut at the event.\nCalendar.\nIn the following calendar for the 2006 Asian Games, each blue box represents an event competition, such as a qualification round, on that day. The yellow boxes represent days during which medal-awarding finals for a sport were held.\nClosing ceremony.\nThe closing ceremony featured an homage to classic Middle Eastern stories and served as a continuation of the opening ceremony. The artistic programme starred the same young boy who played the \"Seeker\" in the opening ceremony. In the first segment, the boy flew on a magic carpet and entered a magical storybook world that paid tribute to the classic folktales of \"One Thousand and One Nights\". This segment included references to stories featured in \"The Nights\" like \"Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves\", \"Sinbad the Sailor\" and \"Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp\". An array of dancers, horses, and special effects were used to portray the different stories. In one scene, the games cauldron was extinguished when the magic carpet left the stadium. Afterwards, there was another segment called \"\"Land of the Oryx\" in which various dances were performed.\nAll 45 nations' athletes entered the stadium after the artistic programme was finished. South Korean swimmer, Park Tae-hwan was announced as the best athlete of the Games, having won seven medals, three of them being golds from the swimming competitions.\nAfter that, the OCA President Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah officially announced the Games closed. As per tradition, the Qatari Armed Forces personnel lowered the OCA flag, which would then be carried by the students of Aspire Academy out of the stadium. Later, the Chinese flag was raised to the Chinese National Anthem. Sheikh Ahmad then passed the OCA flag to the mayor of Guangzhou, Zhang Guangning, as the city was to be the next Asian Games host in 2010.\nA special 10 minute handover segment called \"Oriental Charm\"\" was then presented to showcase Guangzhou as the next host city. This segment fused the traditional dances of China's performing arts with a modern setting. Afterwards, the theme song of the games, \"Triumph of the One,\" was performed by Lea Salonga from the Philippines. The ceremony ended with a fireworks display that also marked the conclusion of the Games.\nMedal table.\nThe top ten ranked NOCs at these Games are listed below. The host nation, Qatar, is highlighted.\nBroadcasting.\nA joint venture between Host Broadcast Services and IMG Media named the Doha Asian Games Broadcast Services (DAGBS), now International Games Broadcast Services (IGBS), was set up in September 2004 and served as the games' host broadcaster after being appointed by the organiser the following month. It distributed 2,000 hours of the Games content to its international rights holders. The International Broadcast Centre was constructed in Qatar International Exhibition Centre (QIEC). Viewers in the European continent watch the event for the first time with Eurosport as the region's broadcaster.\nControversies.\nAthlete's death.\nSouth Korean equestrian athlete Kim Hyung-chil died after falling off his horse on the morning of December 7 during the cross country competition which took place in the rain. The accident occurred at jump number eight during the cross-country stage of the three-day eventing competition. After the horse, named Bundaberg Black, rolled over him, he was taken to Hamad General Hospital, with his death later confirmed by the organizing committee.\nKim died at around 10.50 am, shortly before noon Qatar time. During the accident, he suffered from severe trauma to his head, neck and upper chest. Kim's horse suffered a serious injury during the fall and was euthanised after the accident.\nAccording to South Korea National Olympic Committee president Kim Jung Kil, sources on the course said that the horse mistimed his jump in the wet conditions and slipped. South Korean officials are asking for an inquiry to determine if mismanagement or rain was the cause of the death.\n\"In my professional opinion, neither the weather nor the footing had any bearing on this accident. If the horse falls, it's like two tons of bricks falling on you. There is nothing you can do about it,\" said Andy Griffiths, the Games event's technical overseer. Christopher Hodson, vice president of the International Equestrian Federation, said the course was fit to ride when a full investigation into the accident was conducted.\nKim's father was an equestrian athlete for South Korea in the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo and the younger Kim won a silver medal at the 2002 Asian Games in Busan on the same horse.\nThis is the eighth death linked to the 2006 Asian Games, and the first involving an athlete. The accident came four days after the road accident which killed Jagadammamdhu Sudanan Thampi, a 60-year-old female volunteer from India.\nCriticism.\nDespite the spectacular opening ceremony, which received high praise, there was some criticism by some delegations and athletes. Heavy rain poured down just after the end of opening ceremony, and many believed that the organizers did not have plans to deal with it, creating a chaotic situation. Chef de Mission of the Philippines, Butch Ramirez, said that some of the members of the Philippine delegation, including athletes, were soaked in the rain because the organising officials did not allow them to re-enter the covered stadium for shelter; instead they had to stay in the heavy rain for more than 30 minutes. He went on to say that the breakdown in transportation protocols due to the rain caused the athletes to rush to the nearest bus station, exposing them to rain. Ramirez said that he himself was a victim of pushing and shoving due to this chaos, and that because of it, he suffered from an asthma attack.\nAccording to one IOC insider who arrived back at his hotel soaked, this incident hurt the chances of Doha hosting the 2016 Summer Olympics, which Doha applied for on 25 October 2007, and lost on 4 June 2008 when they were eliminated from the pool. Transportation was one of the crucial factors involved in the decision process. Doha would have its own metro system in 2019.\nPersian Gulf naming dispute.\nIn brochures published in the lead-up to the games, the Persian Gulf was referred to as the \"Arabian Gulf.\" In response, Iranian state television accused the naming conventions to be influenced by a \"Zionist\" plot. Subsequently, Iran threatened to boycott the games if the brochures were not changed. The organizers relented and Iran competed.\nDoping.\nThe list of athletes who failed the doping test during the Games:\nBed shortage.\nThe Games' organizers faced significant bed shortages due to the record number of more than 13,000 athletes and officials who attended the 2006 Games. The Athletes' Village had space for only 10,500 people and was not large enough to accommodate the record amount of attendees. To resolve the problem, organizers contracted with three cruise ships to provide sleeping quarters.\nLast minute withdrawals.\nThe Football competition lost three teams due to withdrawals and a suspension, which resulted rescheduling of the format and draws. Following the withdrawal of Maldives women's football team in early November, the women's football competition was forced to redraw to ensure both groups had an equal number of teams. Not much later, Turkmenistan announced their withdrawal due to the lack of options available in Qatar. Yemen also withdrew because the team was unable to afford a drug test after some of their players were accused of doping.\nIndia made big changes to its team close to the opening ceremonies. On November 22, 2006, the Indian sports dropped eight of the 32 events they had previously announced that they would be contesting in the Games. The dropped events were basketball, handball, sepak takraw, triathlon, ten-pin bowling and rugby sevens. The events were dropped due to the lack of medal hopes and to cut costs. As a result, 387 athletes were sent to Doha instead of the original 589 proposed by the Indian Olympic Association.\nWhile volleyball also had three teams withdraw from the Games, Palestine withdrew due to the travelling difficulties caused by the closure of the Gaza Strip border. Indonesia and Turkmenistan also withdrew from the tournament, for unknown reasons, just hours before their first preliminary round match."

        "text": "The Sweden men's national basketball team () represents Sweden in international basketball competition. The national team is controlled by the Swedish Basketball Federation.\nSweden has qualified for the EuroBasket ten times throughout their history. Their best tournament result was the 11th place finish at the 1995 edition. The Scandinavian squad has also qualified for the Olympic Games once, in 1980, finishing in 10th place. However, Sweden still seeks qualification for their first appearance to the FIBA World Cup.\nHistory.\nEuroBasket 1953.\nSweden's European Basketball Championship debut came at EuroBasket 1953 in Moscow. Although the Swedes did not fare well in their first tournament appearance. As they lost all seven of their matches to finish in last place in the 17 team tournament.\nEuroBasket 1955.\nSweden's second appearance on the continental level came at EuroBasket 1955 in Budapest. The team got off to an demoralizing start by losing to Switzerland in their first match. Although Sweden would achieve their first ever win at the EuroBasket against Luxembourg in their second match of the preliminary phase. However, they followed it by losing their next two matches in the round as well to Romania, and the Soviet Union. They finished 4th out of the 5 teams in the group with an (1-3) record, and found themselves in the classification rounds. There, the team once again finished with an (1-3) record in their pool, with their only victory coming against Denmark. Two losses in the classification 13th–16th place semifinals and the 15th/16th place final (a rematch against Luxembourg) put Sweden at 16th place of the 18 teams.\nLater years.\nSweden qualified for the EuroBasket eight more times with their three best finishes coming in 1969, 1983 and 1995. They also made their lone Summer Olympics appearance in 1980. But overall the national team has struggled to reach an elite level of consistency to become a serious medal contender at major international tournaments. At some events, however, the team displayed potential. E.g. at the EuroBasket 2013 they beat the heavily favored former champion Russia 81-62.\nTeam.\nCurrent roster.\nRoster for the EuroBasket 2025 Qualifiers matches on 22 and 25 February 2024 against Bulgaria and Montenegro.\nPast rosters.\n1953 EuroBasket: finished 17th among 17 teams\n3 Rune Erkers, 4 Kjell Eliasson, 5 Sture Herrman, 6 Staffan Widén, 7 Bo Widén, 8 Örjan Widén, 9 Åke Larsson, 10 Lars Olsson, 11 Erik Sundell, 12 Bengt Gustafsson, 13 Lars-Erik Keijser, 14 Per-Åke Hallberg (Coach: Lars-Åke Nilsson)\n1955 EuroBasket: finished 16th among 18 teams\n3 Staffan Widén, 4 Bo Widén, 5 Örjan Widén, 6 Jan Holmberg, 7 Alvin Tornblom, 8 Lars Helgostam, 9 Sture Herrman, 10 Per-Åke Hallberg, 11 Palle Cardell, 12 Bengt Gustafsson, 13 Jan Oldenmark, 14 Anders Renner, 15 Gustaf Ragge, 16 Nils af Trolle (Coach: Lars-Åke Nilsson)\n1961 EuroBasket: finished 18th among 19 teams\n4 Svante af Klinteberg, 5 Staffan Widén, 6 Udo Tohver, 7 Bo Widén, 8 Torbjörn Langemar, 9 Alvin Törnblom, 10 Bjorn Lundberg, 11 Lars Andersson, 12 Curt Wennström, 13 Örjan Widén, 14 Gunars Kraulis, 15 Lennart Dahllöf (Coach: Juris Reneslacis)\n1965 EuroBasket: finished 16th among 16 teams\n4 Hans Albertsson, 5 Jörgen Hansson, 6 Anders Grönlund, 7 Rune Leinas, 8 Per-Olof Svensson, 9 Ulf Lindelöf, 10 Björn Lundberg, 11 Torbjörn Langemar, 12 Lars Cullert, 13 Per-Olof Lefwerth, 14 Kaj Håkansson, 15 Egon Håkanson (Coach: Rolf Nygren)\n1969 EuroBasket: finished 12th among 12 teams\n4 Kjell Gunna, 5 Bo Lundmark, 6 Anders Grönlund, 7 Ulf Lindelöf, 8 Arturs Veigurs, 9 Ebbe Edström, 10 Janos Fugedi, 11 Jan Hjorth, 12 Per-Olof Lefwerth, 13 Kjell Rannelid, 14 Hans Albertsson, 15 Jörgen Hansson (Coach: Arne Jansson)\n1980 Olympic Games: finished 10th among 12 teams\n4 Peter Andersson, 5 Thomas Nordgren, 6 Peter Gunterberg, 7 Göran Unger, 8 Torbjörn Taxén, 9 Joon-Olof \"Jonte\" Karlsson, 10 Jan Enjebo, 11 Bernt Malion, 12 Roland Rahm, 13 Sten Feldreich, 14 Leif Yttergren, 15 Åke Skyttevall (Coach: Mike Perry)\n1983 EuroBasket: finished 12th among 12 teams\n4 Bill Magarity, 5 Bernt Malion, 6 Peter Nyström, 7 Jerry Sehlberg, 8 Thomas Nordgren, 9 Joon-Olof \"Jonte\" Karlsson, 10 Kenny Grant, 11 Bo Faleström, 12 Roland Rahm, 13 Sten Feldreich, 14 Göran Eriksson, 15 Åke Skyttevall (Coach: Sven Jensen)\n1993 EuroBasket: finished 13th among 16 teams\n4 Olle Håkanson, 5 Magnus Tegel, 6 Örjan Andersson, 7 Henrik Evers, 8 Henrik Gaddefors, 9 Peter Borg, 10 Martin Jansson, 11 Jens Tillman, 12 Torbjörn Gehrke, 13 Anders Marcus, 14 Per Stümer, 15 Mattias Sahlström (Coach: Rolf Nilsson)\n1995 EuroBasket: finished 14th among 14 teams\n4 Olle Håkanson, 5 Örjan Andersson, 6 Christian Larsson, 7 Henrik Evers, 8 Henrik Gaddefors, 9 Jonas Larsson, 10 Oscar Lefwerth, 11 Joakim Blom, 12 Torbjörn Gehrke, 13 Anders Marcus, 14 Vincent Lundahl, 15 Mattias Sahlström (Coach: Rolf Nilsson)\n2003 EuroBasket: finished 16th among 16 teams\n4 Paul Burke, 5 Hakan Larsson, 6 Jens Stalhandske, 7 Mats Levin, 8 Oluoma Nnamaka, 9 Jonas Larsson, 10 Lesli Myrthil, 11 Joakim Blom, 12 Fredrik Jonzen, 13 Christian Maråker, 14 John Pettersson, 15 Daniel Dajic (Coach: Jan Enjebo)\n2013 EuroBasket: finished 13th among 24 teams\n4 Ludvig Håkanson, 5 Jonathan Skjöldebrand, 6 Joakim Kjellbom, 7 Dino Pita, 8 Anton Gaddefors, 9 Brice Massamba, 10 Kenny Grant, 11 Jonas Jerebko, 12 Thomas Massamba, 13 Erik Rush, 14 Jeffery Taylor, 15 Viktor Gaddefors (Coach: Brad Dean)"

Israel is currently ranked 42nd in the FIBA World Ranking.\nIsrael has qualified for the EuroBasket 30 times throughout their history. They have also made two appearances at the World Cup, and one at the Summer Olympics. Israel also participated at the Asian Games from 1966 to 1974. The most success Israel has had on the international stage to date, is finishing as the runners-up at EuroBasket 1979, as well as winning two gold medals (1966, 1974), and one silver medal (1970) at the Asian Games.\nHistory.\n1952 Olympic Games.\nThe Israeli national team played in their first international competition at the 1952 Olympic Games. However, the team would quickly be ousted in the preliminary tournament, with an (0–2) record and loses to the Philippines, and Greece.\nEuroBasket 1953.\nIsrael made their European Basketball Championship debut at EuroBasket 1953 in Moscow. In the preliminary round, the Israeli squad won their group by tie-breaker after being one of three teams to finish with a (3–1) record.

Although Greece would have none of it, as they dominated Israel 82–61, dropping the team to a record of (1–1). Israel would eventually get things on track, as they finished the rest of group play at (3–3), enough to advance to the second and final round of qualifying.\nFor the second round of World Cup qualifying, Israel was placed into Group L. Their first two matches of group play were tough loses against Georgia, and Germany. Although they eventually picked up an impressive win in their third game at home versus Serbia. Unfortunately, the national team would only earn one more victory during the rest of the qualifiers, which saw their hopes at (5–7) and clinching qualification vanish.\nHonours.\nMedals

        "title": "United States Navy Baseball",
        "text": "The modern United States Navy Baseball Club was founded by retired U.S. Navy Commander Terry Allvord in Pensacola, Florida in 1990 before moving to San Diego for the 1993 season. This program is the leader in armed forces baseball in the modern era. Allvord went on to establish over 40 single-service armed forces teams in every branch of the military around the globe. Tryouts are held every year to form the most talented military and first responders team to compete as the U.S. Military All-Stars during the annual \"Red, White and Blue Tour\" The team features active duty, reserve, veterans, Delayed Entry Program and first responders. The continuation of two wars has limited the availability of armed forces players. As a result, beginning in 2010, the team will be known as the \"Heroes of the Diamond\" allowing a limited number of former MLB, current professional, summer collegiate and first responders the opportunity to join the tour. Players interested in the military and willing to support the mission will continue to pay their own expenses while off-duty to compete against the finest professional, independent and summer collegiate programs in the world. \nMission statement.\nTo promote the awareness of Americans in support of the honorable sacrifices our armed forces make at the tip of the spear.\nHistory.\nThe origin of United States Armed Forces Baseball has been traced as far back as the American Civil War (1860–1865). For over a century, military baseball has been utilized as a successful tool to improve recruiting efforts and the morale of both the armed services and the American people.\nFollowing World War I, major league stars such as Ty Cobb and Christy Mathewson served their country while playing on teams overseas and at home. Military baseball reached its peak of popularity during World War II (1941–1945) as baseball legends Ted Williams, Joe DiMaggio, Hank Greenberg and Bob Feller headed the list of major league professionals playing on service teams. Military baseball also served as a conduit to post-war reconstruction efforts and international relations most notably in Japan. \nMilitary baseball support was extremely limited in scope during the Korean War (1950–1952) and finally, the Vietnam War (1965–1974), when politicians began the systematic dismantling of the military infrastructure and force strength. Baseball was slowly phased out and went dormant along with the decline of the armed forces.\nModern era.\nIn 1990, the United States experienced a renaissance of organized military baseball in the “modern era”. Determined re-organization efforts began after a U.S. Navy program was founded in Pensacola, Florida. That initial navy program launched nearly two decades ago, led Allvord to establish teams in every branch and ensure the growth and success of teams around the world.\nWith tensions in the Middle East and the current war in Iraq, the global War on Terrorism continues to be a factor in lives of Americans each day. As a way to capture the same spirit during World War II a historic effort led by the navy team provided a unique and patriotic arena for Americans to support their armed forces at home and abroad.\nToday, the [Heroes of the Diamond] are the largest, fastest growing and most successful \"joint\" military program in the world. Over 25,000 personnel have participated since 1990. In 2003, an episode of the CBS television show \"JAG\" was based on the programs annual Navy-Marine Corps All-Star Game featuring 2002 Cy Young award winner and Oakland Athletics pitcher Barry Zito. In 2006, the team posted an impressive 41 and 6 record. This remains the best performance in the history of the program and featured a 4 and 2 overall record against teams in the independent professional Golden Baseball League.\nFollowing the 2008 season, the founder of the \"Red, White and Blue Tour\", retired U.S. Navy Commander Terry Allvord joined forces with Dan Duquette, former general manager of the Boston Red Sox, Buddy Lewis and Jerry O'Connor, executives of Nocona Athletic Goods Company (also known as Nokona) to create a new ownership group dedicated to providing opportunities for members of the U.S. Armed Forces and military academies. The new alignment created five teams at every level of baseball to create a unique \"farm system\" which includes: \nAmerican Defenders of New Hampshire of the Can-Am Professional League managed by former Red Sox Brian Daubach, the U.S. Military All-Stars \"Red, White and Blue Tour\" (Domestic) managed by former major league first baseman Ivan Cruz, the U.S. Military All-Stars \"Red, White and Blue Diplomacy Tour\" (International) and the newly minted Latin Stars led by Ramssey Ochoa. The tour teams continued their solid reputation with an impressive .720 winning percentage built over two decades while delivering patriotic entertainment. In 2009, over 20 tour players were offered professional contracts, making it an ideal source for future talent while posting a record of 31, 6 and 1 against professional and summer collegiate programs. \nThe Pittsfield American Defenders, whose name has a double meaning as defenders of America, and for a new glove made by Nokona, called the American Defender.[2]In their inaugural season, The Defenders were led by former ABCA chairman and collegiate baseball legends Dr. Carroll Land and coach Bob Warn assisted by coach Ron Swen. Due to the timing of the new partnership and the desire to hold as many spots as possible for players from military schools and service academies the roster was extremely late in taking shape. The military academies had a hard time believing a premier New England Collegiate Baseball League team was interested in dedicating their efforts to provide an opportunity for their players. Add to that, a stadium under construction and at one point submerged under two feet of water, and Pittsfield was faced with many challenges.\nNavy-Marine All-Star Game.\nFor 10 years, the Navy-Marine All-Star Game was played each summer immediately following a San Diego Padres contest and dedicated to Pearl Harbor survivor Commander Lawrence S. Jackman, U.S. Navy. The most valuable player award is dedicated to Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Wayne Kidd, USMC, who was killed in the line of duty while stationed at Camp Pendleton in March 1996. The current record for the annual contest is a 9–9 tie between the Navy and Marine Corps. The most recent contest in 2007 was claimed by the U.S. Military All-Stars defeating the Marine Corps 12–1 and played at Tony Gwynn Stadium, San Diego State University."

It was ported for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) by Hudson Soft in 1991 as Bill Laimbeer's Combat Basketball. It was the first basketball game released for the SNES. The game stars Bill Laimbeer, who played for the Detroit Pistons of the NBA during a time when the team was notorious for aggressive and dirty, physical play.\nThe game takes place in the year 2031. Bill Laimbeer has become commissioner of a basketball league, fired the referees and created a style of play without rules. There are no fouls and use of weapons is perfectly legal.\nGameplay.\nThe game utilizes an uncommon overhead view of the court. Unlike real basketball, players can physically check each other on the court without the threat of personal or team fouls. Destructive items such as bombs frequently appear on the court.\nA season lasts 14 games without any playoff games. After each season, the top two teams in each league advance to the league above, and the bottom two teams in each league get moved down to the league below. Ties are broken by beginning season standings. If two teams finish the season with the same record, the one that was ranked higher at the beginning of the season will be ranked highest. The player starts out his career in the Third Division and must work his way up to the Super League; where the best teams vie for league supremacy.\nReception.\nAmiga, Atari ST.\n\"Future Basketball\" was compared negatively to \"Speedball\". \"CU Amiga\" said: \"But where it really comes second [...] is in its scrolling which is not quite as smooth making things a little difficult to focus on at times. \"Zzap!64\" wrote: \"Future Basketball looks like Speedball, but doesn't play like it. Zinging balls off the walls in this game leads to a dull throw-in, and scoring baskets isn't as exciting.\"\nSNES.\nBret Alan Weiss, writing for Allgame, gave the game a negative review, criticizing the graphics, sounds and controls. Scoring the game one star out of five, he commented that these and other faults \"mar what could have been a guilty pleasure.\" \"Game Informer\"s Jeff Marchiafava had a more positive view of the game on his list of \"Weirdest Celebrity-Based Video Games.\"\n\"Time Extension\" listed \"Combat Basketball\" as one of the worst SNES games."

        "text": "Ronald Lee Wilson (born May 13, 1956) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey centreman and current assistant coach with the Hamilton Bulldogs of the Ontario Hockey League. Wilson's professional playing career spans twenty seasons, including fourteen in the National Hockey League. Following his retirement, he turned to coaching and held assistant and head coach positions for various American Hockey League teams. On August 9, 2011, the Montreal Canadiens announced that they had hired Wilson as the assistant to the Hamilton Bulldogs' coach Clément Jodoin.\nEarly life.\nWilson was born in Toronto and played junior hockey in the Ontario Hockey Association with the Toronto Marlboros, Hamilton Red Wings and St. Catharines Black Hawks. He also played three stints with the Markham Waxers during his time with the OHA. \nCareer.\nPlaying.\nWilson was drafted 133rd overall by the Montreal Canadiens in the 1976 NHL Amateur Draft and started playing for the Canadiens' American Hockey League affiliate, the Nova Scotia Voyageurs. After three seasons with the team, Wilson was traded to the Winnipeg Jets who had just joined the National Hockey League following the NHL–WHA merger. He made the team and played nine seasons in Winnipeg with minor league stints with the Tulsa Oilers and Sherbrooke Jets. Wilson spent the entire 1988–89 season and part of the 1989–90 season with the Moncton Hawks (the Jets minor league affiliate) before being traded to the St. Louis Blues for Doug Evans. He spent four seasons with the Blues before signing as a free agent with the Montreal Canadiens. Wilson's season in Montreal was his last in the NHL but he played two more years in the International Hockey League (Detroit Vipers and San Diego Gulls) and the East Coast Hockey League (Wheeling Thunderbirds). In total, Wilson played 832 NHL games over fourteen seasons, scoring 110 goals and 216 assists for 326 points and amassing 415 penalty minutes.\nCoaching.\nWilson retired as a player after the 1995–96 season and took an assistant coach position with the AHL Springfield Falcons the following season. After four seasons with the Falcons, he joined the Saint John Flames as the assistant to Jim Playfair. During the 2002–03 season, Playfair was promoted to the assistant coach position for the Calgary Flames and Wilson became the Saint John Flames' head coach. The team disbanded at the end of the season and Wilson became an assistant coach with the Hamilton Bulldogs and coached for five seasons. In 2008–09, Wilson was named head coach when Don Lever promoted to the assistant coach position for the Montreal Canadiens after the firing of Guy Carbonneau. His contract was not renewed and Guy Boucher took over as head coach. Wilson accepted an assistant coaching position with the Chicago Wolves, after Don Lever obtained the head coaching position, at the early stages of the 2009–10 season. After two years with the Wolves, both Wilson and Lever lost their job following the relocation of the Atlanta Thrashers to Winnipeg.

        "text": "United League Baseball was an independent baseball league that operated in Texas. The league operated from 2006 to 2009. The league then temporarily merged with the Northern League and the Golden Baseball League to form the North American League from 2011–2012. However, after the North American League folded at the end of the 2012 season, ULB was reformed. It dissolved for a second time in January 2015.\nHistory.\nThe league began its first season on May 16, 2006, with six teams: the Alexandria Aces, Amarillo Dillas, Edinburg Coyotes, Laredo Broncos, Rio Grande Valley WhiteWings and San Angelo Colts. The San Angelo franchise previously played in the now-defunct Central Baseball League, while the Amarillo Dillas previously played in the now-defunct Texas–Louisiana League. The United League was originally owned by an investor group United Sports Equity LLC followed by former Congressman John Bryant.\nIn 2013, following the dissolution of the North American League, United League Baseball was reincorporated. The league played an 80-game season from late May to the middle of August, and featured the Edinburg Roadrunners, the Fort Worth Cats, the Rio Grande Valley WhiteWings, the San Angelo Colts, the Texas Thunder, and the Alexandria Aces. Alexandria and Texas were shut down mid-season. Edinburg did not field a team for 2014 and they were replaced by the Brownsville Charros.\nThe San Angelo Colts announced on July 2, 2014, that they had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Although it was stated at the time that operations would not be affected, the team announced on August 11, 2014, that the final eight games of the 2014 regular season would not be played. Originally scheduled to end August 24, the league's 2014 regular season ended August 15, with the best-of-five championship series between the Cats and the WhiteWings starting August 16. The United League Baseball was looking into possibly expanding to Del Rio, Texas, and was scheduled to meet with city officials in October 2014.\nIn November 2014, it was announced that the City of Ft. Worth had not renewed the lease at LaGrave Field for the Ft. Worth Cats, thus leaving them without a home for the 2015 season. Through the mismanagement of the league by Bryant and Pierce and having one remaining stadium lease in Harlingen the league was formally disbanded in January 2015.\nStandings.\n2007 season.\n\"^ Clinched Playoff Spot\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"* Clinched 1st Half Title\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"** Clinched 2nd Half Title\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"*** Clinched Regular Season Title\"\n2008 season.\n\"* Clinched 1st Playoff Seed\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"** Clinched 2nd Playoff Seed\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"*** Clinched 3rd Playoff Seed\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"**** Clinched 4th Playoff Seed\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"^ Clinched Regular Season Championship\"\n2009 season.\n\"* Clinched 1st Playoff Seed\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"** Clinched 2nd Playoff Seed\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"*** Clinched 3rd Playoff Seed\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"**** Clinched 4th Playoff Seed\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"^ Clinched Regular Season Championship\"\n2010 season.\n\"* Clinched 1st Playoff Seed\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"** Clinched 2nd Playoff Seed\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"*** Clinched 3rd Playoff Seed\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"**** Clinched 4th Playoff Seed\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"^ Clinched Regular Season Championship\"\nPlayoffs.\n2013 Playoff Results.\nFormat: When the league returned for the 2013 season the United League paired the top two regular season teams in a best of 5 ULB Championship series.\n2010 Playoff Results.\nFormat: for the 2010 season the United League playoffs consisted of 4 teams competing in 2 rounds, with the top 4 regular season teams making the playoffs.

Its format in 2008 featured the United League all-stars versus the Golden League all-stars. In 2006 the first All-Star Game pitted the best team against the all-stars from the rest of the United League. In 2007 the second All-Star Game pitted Team North (All-Stars from Alexandria, Amarillo and San Angelo) against Team Rio Grande (All-Stars from Edinburg, Laredo and Rio Grande Valley).\nThe ULB's all-star festivities were a two-day event, the first day featuring various celebrations and recognitions, followed on the second day by the Home Run Derby and the All-Star Game."

He previously played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Vancouver Canucks and the New York Rangers. His older brother, former NHL superstar Sergei Fedorov, is the general manager of CSKA Moscow.\nPlaying career.\nFedorov was drafted by the Tampa Bay Lightning in the sixth round, 182nd overall, in the 1999 NHL Entry Draft. The Lightning did not sign within the two-year period of owning his rights, so he re-entered the NHL draft in 2001. He was drafted by the Vancouver Canucks in the third round (66th overall).\nHe played 15 NHL games with Vancouver Canucks, and 116 games with the Manitoba Moose, the minor-league affiliate of the Canucks.\nOn 24 March 2004, Fedorov was involved in an off-ice incident with teammate Kevin Bieksa. According to then-Canucks General Manager Brian Burke, several Moose players had gone out together when Bieksa accidentally spilled Fedorov's beer. While Bieksa apologized and offered to buy him another beer, Fedorov challenged him to a fight outside of the establishment, resulting in Bieksa knocking him down with one punch. This eventually led to Bieksa getting signed to a contract with the Canucks, where he would spend 10 seasons of his career.\nOn 7 October 2005, the Canucks traded Fedorov to the New York Rangers for Jozef Balej and a sixth round pick in 2008. He played just three games for the Rangers, playing mostly with their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Hartford Wolf Pack.\nOn 25 July 2006, he signed with Lokomotiv Yaroslavl of the Russian Superleague (RSL). Later in the 2006–07 season, he signed with the Malmö Redhawks of the Swedish Elitserien.\nOn 4 July 2008, Fedorov signed an NHL contract with the New Jersey Devils. Fedorov did not make the Devils' NHL roster and, after choosing not to report to AHL affiliate Lowell Devils, he was released by the team.\nOn 22 October 2008, Fedorov signed with Nizhnekamsk Neftekhimik of the newly formed Russian Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). He signed subsequently with Metallurg Magnitogorsk of the KHL. He played the 2011-2013 seasons with SKA Saint Petersburg, also of the KHL. During the 2013 offseason, Fedorov signed a contract with CSKA Moscow. After one season in Moscow, on 2 October 2014, Fedorov was on the move again after he signed as a free agent with HC Lada Togliatti on a one-year contract."

The OHL team moved to Hamilton for the 1989-90 season, becoming the Dukes of Hamilton. The name \"Dukes\" originated as a nickname for the Toronto team coming from its namesake, the Duke of Marlborough.\nThe Dukes were chosen to host the Memorial Cup their first season in Hamilton. However when the team finished last overall in the standings, the Dukes declined the automatic invite given to the hosts of the Memorial Cup tournament. The OHL sent the league finalist Kitchener Rangers instead.\nThe second season for the Dukes was only marginally better even after switching from the Leyden Division to the Emms Division. The Dukes qualified for the last playoff spot, but lost in four games straight. Following the 1990–91 season, the team was relocated to Guelph where it became the Guelph Storm.\nPlayers.\nThree Dukes alumni went on to play brief NHL careers. Alek Stojanov played 107 games, Chris Govedaris played 45 games, and Shawn McCosh played 9 games. Also of note are Jeff Bes (Captain), Dino Felicetti, Rob Leask and Kayle Short for their careers in other professional leagues.\nBill Armstrong started the 1989–90 season playing defence for the Dukes, but two mid-season trades later he wound up playing for the Oshawa Generals, and scored the winning goal in double overtime of the Memorial Cup final, played at the Dukes' home arena, Copps Coliseum.\nUniforms and logos.\nThe Dukes colours were red, white &amp; blue. The home jerseys had a white background with red &amp; blue trim. The road jerseys were a red background with white and blue trim. Their uniforms were similar to those worn at the time by the National Hockey League's Washington Capitals. The colour of the top of the crown on the logo was either red or white, opposite or the background of the home or away jersey.\nArena.\nThe Dukes played their home games at Copps Coliseum, which hosted the Memorial Cup in 1990."

He was lettered four times in football and gained more than 1,900 yards receiving and 700 yards rushing for his high school career.\nCollege career.\nCarter played college football at Troy State University (now Troy University). He played only two seasons of college football at Troy State, totaling 46 catches for 869 yards and 11 touchdowns. Carter was an All-Southland Football League selection after starting every game as a senior in 2000, compiling 40 receptions for 632 yards and eight touchdowns, as well as ten kickoff returns for 286 yards and another score. He added seven carries for 88 yards, giving him an average of 91.5 All-purpose yards per game for the season. He also had a career game against Alabama State, gaining 111 yards on seven catches with two touchdowns. He played in 11 games in 1999, totaling six catches for 237 yards and three touchdowns. He recorded a career-long catch of 65 yards on a touchdown strike against Middle Tennessee State.\nProfessional career.\nCarter was drafted in the fifth round of the 2001 NFL draft by the New York Giants. As a rookie with the Giants, Carter appeared in two games and returned eight kickoffs for 155 yards and led the team with a 19.4-yard average per return. In 2002, he returned one kickoff for 14 yards in the Giants’ opener against San Francisco, but was waived by the Giants on October 8, 2002 and claimed by the New York Jets the next day.

He went instead to the NFLEL's facility in Birmingham to recover from his injury.\nThe Buccaneers were allowed to use Carter's roster exemption on another player from the NFL Europe League who was not already affiliated with an NFL team. Eventually, that exemption would have to be assumed by only one of the two players. Tampa Bay signed defensive end/long-snapper Jordan Hicks in June. When Carter returned to full health, the Buccaneers chose to leave the exemption with Hicks and released Carter.\nPersonal.\nCarter majored in Business at Troy State. He also served as a volunteer for the Jets’ JV Clinic, assisted in the Jets’ Blood Drive in May 2003, and participated in Santana Moss’ event with Operation SCORE (Seizing Control of Right Eating), where he manned one of six stations. The New York Jets players manned each station and taught children about stretching, aerobic exercise and conditioning. Carter also participated in the Club's Football Fanfare/Kid Reporter of the Week Program with The Star Ledger by interviewing with a kid reporter after the Club's 9/28 game vs. Dallas.\nCarter also has a son named Jace and a daughter named Jaylee."

In a departure from that policy, for 1911 the management decided to instead schedule a single, large-scale event attracting widespread attention from both American and European racing teams and manufacturers.

Throughout the remainder of the season, however, the crowds grew progressively smaller, and after seeing a second decline in attendance in as many days for Labor Day, September 5, 1910, the final day of the concluding meet, Speedway co-founders Carl Fisher, James Allison, Arthur Newby and Frank Wheeler conferred to decide on a new course for the following year.\nWhile the appearance on Monday of some 18,000 was reasonable enough, given both the rain showers occurring early that morning and the large parade held downtown during the afternoon, neither the two days of the Labor Day meet nor the July 4 weekend races had come near to equaling the Memorial Day turnout. While potential explanations for the decline included the high heat of summer and the women of the city making family holiday plans that did not include automobile racing, one of the most likely, they reasoned, was an overabundance of the very events they exhibited: too many races had diluted turnout down to only those most interested in the sport.\nTiming.\nBy the next day, Tuesday, September 6, 1910, local newspapers had already heard rumors of the decision, and reported that the four partners would likely soon choose to concentrate on a singular, major event for 1911. Most strongly considered were either a 24-hour contest — anticipating the 24 Hours of Le Mans, itself inaugurated just a dozen years later — or a endurance race, with a spectacular purse of $25,000; equivalent to of pure gold, and more than high enough to attract global as well as national and regional competition. The endurance event was favored by several manufacturers, but debate soon proceeded as to what would be most beneficial to the spectators as well as the participants. While a 24-hour race would be possible on a technical level despite its extreme nature, all agreed that potential ticket-buyers would inevitably depart the grounds well before its conclusion. Deciding on a \"race window\" extending from 10:00AM to late afternoon, local time, early estimates placed the planned race distance at . The race winner, with purse estimates ranging toward $30,000, could expect to see as much as $12,000.\nIn choices for a specific date to hold the race, Memorial Day, already the occasion of the largest attendance, was always foremost. As suggested to the Speedway owners by business associate Lem Trotter, the time coincided with the completion of a late-spring agricultural practice known as \"haying,\" after which the farmers acquired an effective two-week break. While the intention, Trotter argued, would certainly be to draw from far more than just the local farming community, simple business sense called for as little interference as possible with the regional economy. That such an opportunity to avoid a conflict of interest fell on a major national holiday sealed the decision: within two days, formal announcement was made of a , marathon-distance motor race, to be held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, May 30, 1911.\nPreparation, and the \"Month of May\".\nAs desired and expected, news of a contest of such distance evoked strong enthusiasm both within and without the motorsport community. Newspaper and trade magazine articles used ever-new superlatives for the challenges expected to soon face both drivers and engineers, and continuing discussion throughout the spring and winter kept the race as the primary conversation piece of the average citizen. Everyone, it seemed, had something to say about it.\nDue to the publicity thus created, Speedway management, which had for the previous two seasons of meets charged the effectively nominal entry fee of one dollar per mile of scheduled race distances, took measures to ensure that the likely large entry list did not include any that were frivolous: at an accordingly heightened fee of $500 per car, participation became a nominally risky proposition to teams and manufacturers, since, although the high finishers were due to receive record purse money and accessory prizes, no money at all was offered to finishers below tenth place. Interest, however, was far from dampened, with entry blanks distributed over the course of the following month quickly returning filled, the first of which being an automobile built by the J. I. Case Threshing Machine Company of Racine, Wisconsin, to be driven by Lewis Strang. By May 1, 1911, the final day for entry filing, a high total of some 46 cars had been nominated to compete.\nMay 1 also marked the beginning of a long tradition of the opening of the Speedway, on the first day of the month of the race, to free practice on the circuit during daylight hours by any and all participants. A policy originally established so as to allow teams unfamiliar with the , recently brick-paved high-speed course as much time to acclimate as necessary, the \"Month of May\", as it came to be called in future years, ultimately proved most advantageous in the short-term to the locally based teams, given that many of the entries from abroad did not even set out for the city until well into the month. One such example, the double-entry Pope-Hartford team based in Springfield, Massachusetts, came by way of the team's actual racing cars themselves simply being driven cross-country, while loaded up with toolboxes and as many spare parts as they could hold, making overnight stops in New York City, Buffalo, Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio, before finally arriving, where they were duly met at the city's East Washington Street by Frank Fox, who was not only the slated driver of one of the two cars but also the company's local agent.\nUltimately, of the full forty-six entries originally submitted, only the two cars of the Falcar team from Moline, Illinois failed to appear, due to an inability to acquire critical chassis pieces.\nSetting the field.\nTo further refine the entry list as the date of the race approached, a qualification system was implemented whereby each car would be required to demonstrate a sufficiently competitive pace. With several of the top entries having already recorded, during the \"unofficial\" practice time of the month, complete laps at up to , a minimum required speed of , based on a flying start over a section of the main straightaway, was considered to be within reason. Thus, all cars successfully completing an officially-timed run of the quarter-mile distance at or under 12 seconds would be accepted into the starting field; those that did not would be given two additional attempts before being rejected, a policy that began the tradition of three qualification attempts allotted to each entered car.\nIn the years following these inaugural qualification sessions, which were held on May 27 and 28, 1911, anecdotes would occasionally arise, and thereafter be steadily embellished in their retelling, regarding the purported qualifying times and speeds of given competitors, and how they compared to one another. In reality, no records of the sessions were kept at all, let alone publicized, with the sole objective being the confirmation of each car's capability to achieve the minimum speed. Also in contrast to later eras, both the starting order and the car numbering of the participants were determined not by respective speeds or previous seasonal point totals, but by entry date, with the Strang-driven Case entry being assigned #1 in the first starting position.\nThe 500-mile race.\nThe largest racing purse offered to date, $27,550, drew 46 entries from the United States and Europe, from which 40 qualified by sustaining along the quarter mile-long main straight. Grid positions were determined by date of filing of official entry forms, rather than speed, a difference from the contemporary European practice of lottery. Entries were prescribed by rules to have a minimum weight of 2,300 lb (1,043 kg) and a maximum engine size of 600 cubic inches (9.83 litres) displacement.\nThe 40 cars lined up five to a row, except for the first and last. In the first row, the Stoddard-Dayton pace car was situated on the inside (driven by IMS owner Carl Fisher), with four competitors cars rounding out the row. Rows 2-8 had five cars each, while the final row had only one car in it. Fisher's use of the Stoddard-Dayton is believed to constitute the first use of such a vehicle, for the first known mass rolling start of an automobile race.\nAmid roiling smoke, the roar of the 40 machines' engines, and the waving of a red flag which signalled 'clear course ahead', American Johnny Aitken, in a National, took the lead from the fourth starting spot on the extreme outside of the first row, and held it until lap 5 when Spencer Wishart took over in a Mercedes, himself soon overtaken by David Bruce-Brown's Fiat which would go on to dominate the first half of the race. Sadly on lap 12 tragedy would strike as Sam Dickson (the riding mechanic for Arthur Greiner) was the first person killed in history during the Indianapolis 500. One of the front wheels came off the American Simplex car Greiner was driving, causing him to lose control and both men to be thrown from the car. While Greiner escaped with a broken arm, Dickson flew into a fence 20 feet (6.1 m) from the car. Reports state that Dickson was killed instantly, although the crowd evidently swarmed around the body, requiring the state militia who were acting as security at the event to use their guns as clubs to clear a path for the attending doctors. Nearing the halfway point, Ray Harroun, an engineer for the Marmon-Nordyke company and defending AAA national champion, and the only driver competing without a riding mechanic due to his first-ever-recorded use of a cowl-mounted rear-view mirror, passed Bruce-Brown for the lead in his self-designed, six-cylinder \"Marmon Wasp\" (so named for its distinctively sharp-pointed, wasp-like tail).\nOthers faltered during the marathon event, 14 cars fell out of the race.\nHarroun, relieved by Cyrus Patschke for 35 laps (87.5 miles / 140.82 km), led 88 of the 200 laps, the most among the race's seven leaders, for a race-average speed of 74.602 mph (120.060 km/h) in a total time of 6:42:08 for the 500-mile (804.67 km) distance to win.\nDuring the midpoint of the second half the race, Harroun and Lozier driver Ralph Mulford had fought an intense duel, with Harroun holding a small advantage near the 340 mile (550 kilometer) mark, whereupon one of the Wasp's tires failed. Harroun's forced stop allowed Mulford to move to the front, before Mulford also pitted for new rubber. After Mulford came back onto the track, Harroun was scored in the lead with a 1-minute 48 second advantage, and victory.\nAfter the race, and collection of $10,000 for first place, Harroun returned to the position he had taken at the end of the 1910 racing season: retirement. He would never race again.\nControversy.\nUpon Harroun's declared victory, second-place finisher Mulford supposedly protested, contending he had lapped Harroun when the Marmon limped in on the torn tire, an argument appearing plausible to some, due to an accident disrupting the official timing and scoring stand at nearly the same time. However, race officials were quick to note Mulford's subsequent pit stop forced the Lozier crew to spend several minutes themselves changing a tire which stuck to the wheel hub; Mulford's protest was thus denied.\nAccording to track historian Donald Davidson, no protests were filed at the end of the race and Mulford offered congratulations to Harroun in the \"Detroit Free Press\" newspaper on June 4. Davidson has also pointed out that Mulford was reported by contemporary publications to have changed 14 tires during the course of the race, including one from a blown tire in turn one. Changing tires at the time was a lengthy and painstaking process, as the wheels were typically not removable. Tires had to be pried off of the rims, remounted, and inflated - all using hand tools, and in the precarious confines of the primitive pit stalls. Mulford himself even understood and admitted that he lost at least 14 minutes of track position due to his numerous pit stops.\nAfter blowing the tire on turn one, Mulford had to limp around the track for almost an entire lap, and subsequently bent the rim. That necessitated an even longer pit stop at that juncture to hammer out the damage. The accounts from the newspapers claim that Harroun changed only four tires all day during only three pit stops. Harroun's team changed the right rear tire three times, and one other unspecified tire. Harroun's shorter elapsed time in the pits is alone considered sufficient to more than overcome any track position advantage Mulford might have been thought to have. But the undermining evidence to support Harroun as the rightful winner was the team strategy to run a constant 75 mph pace, regardless of position, in order to save tire wear. During the 1910 Wheeler-Schebler Trophy Race, as well as during test runs in May 1911, Harroun discovered that by merely running a constant 75 mph pace instead of an 80 mph (or faster) pace, he would substantially reduce his tire wear and increase tire life.\nDavidson contends that Mulford did not make serious claims to victory later in life, as some have suggested. And in fact the controversy itself did not begin to inflame until decades after the race. Likewise, internet-based urban legends, and a book published in 2011, have fueled the controversy. It is also possible that Mulford's statements in the \"Detroit Free Press\" interview were misunderstood or purposely misconstrued. While giving full credit to Harroun for winning the race, Mulford did for himself claim the world record for 500 miles driven solo (Harroun had relief help from Cyrus Patschke). He also made the largely inconsequential claim that minus the stoppage time needed for pit stops (over 14 minutes), he likely completed the 500 miles (running time only) in less elapsed time than Harroun &amp; Patschke.\nStarting grid.\nEntries were required to maintain an excess of over a quarter-mile distance to qualify. However, the starting grid determined by order of entry date. No qualification times or speeds were recorded, only pass or fail.\nNote: All drivers were Indianapolis 500 Rookies\nBox score.\nNote: Relief drivers in parentheses\nNote: (*) Due to an accident at the timing and scoring stand, laps 138 through 176 were unofficially recorded.\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nStatistics.\nRace field average engine displacement:\nRace field average qualifying speed:\nFinishing entries average time and finishing speed:"

        "title": "John Mitchell (rugby union)",
        "text": "John Eric Paul Mitchell (born 23 March 1964) is a New Zealand professional rugby union coach and former player who has been coaching the England Women's national team since 2023. His son is New Zealand International cricketer Daryl Mitchell. \nPlaying career.\nEarly career.\nBorn 23 March 1964 in Hāwera, New Zealand, Mitchell was a pupil at Francis Douglas Memorial College in New Plymouth when he made the first XV; he was a member of the NZ secondary schools basketball team from 1981 to 1983. He represented NZ Juniors in basketball in 1982–83, but then decided to concentrate on rugby. From here, he earned a place at King Country RFU aged 19 before playing for Fraser-Tech from 1984. He was soon selected provincially for the Waikato Colts.\nProvincial.\nHe made his Waikato senior debut in 1985 and played at number eight, blindside flanker and lock before he became firmly established at number eight. Equal top scorer in first division rugby in 1989–90, he thus scored more tries over these seasons than any other NZ first division player.\nMitchell was given the Waikato captaincy in 1989. In 1990, because of a broken leg, he could only play half the games. He was reappointed captain in 1991 and led from that time on until his retirement just prior to the start of the 1995 season. Overall, he played 134 games for Waikato, including a record 86 times as captain, scoring 335 points from 67 tries. In the off-season, Mitchell played club rugby in France and Ireland, which included a stint with Garryowen in the All-Ireland League. He was part of the team that finished second in the 1990–91 season to Cork Constitution.\nAll Blacks.\nThough Mitchell never played for the All Blacks at test level, he did represent the team on 6 occasions in 1993. He travelled as part of the 1993 tour of Britain squad, where he featured in six uncapped matches. His first was against a Midland Division side on 26 October 1993 where the All Blacks came out victors 12–6. He later captained the side three times, all resulting in victories - against a Scottish Development XV 31–12, England Emerging Players 30–19 and Combined Services 13–3.\nHonours.\nWaikato\nCoaching.\nDespite not retiring from playing until 1995, Mitchell featured as a player/coach at Fraser Tech until his retirement. When Murray Kidd was named the new Ireland coach in 1995, he hired Mitchell as a technical adviser/forwards coach in January 1996.\nIn May 1996, he was brought into Sale Sharks by coach Paul Turner who later stood down at the end of the 1995–96 season. Mitchell subsequently became in charge of Sale until 1999. Following problems at Sale, his contract was bought out and he left the club.\nIn 1997, Mitchell was targeted by newly appointed head coach of England, Clive Woodward, to be the new forwards coach. He left the national set-up in 2000.\nNew Zealand.\nIn late 2000 Mitchell returned to New Zealand for his appointment as the new head coach of the Chiefs in the Super 12, and he led the side to sixth in the table.\nIn October 2001, Mitchell was named the head coach of the New Zealand national side.\nJust a month after being appointed as head coach, Mitchell's first match in charge was against Ireland in Dublin, which saw the All Blacks win 40–29, before going onto beat Scotland 37–6, and Argentina 24–20. In 2002, Mitchell was unable to lead the All Blacks to reclaim the Bledisloe Cup, having not won the trophy since 1997. The All Blacks reclaimed the trophy a year later, however, winning both games.\nMitchell led the All Blacks to a third-place finish at the 2003 Rugby World Cup, with victories over Italy, Canada, Tonga and Wales in the group stage to finish top of Pool D. The All Blacks beat the Springboks 29–9 in the quarterfinals, but lost to hosts Australia in the semifinal 22–10. Following that loss, Mitchell lost his job as All Blacks coach. The NZRU cited Mitchell's difficult relationships with the media and with sponsors as the main reasons for searching for other head coaching candidates, rather than the performance of the team.\nWaikato.\nAfter leaving the All Blacks, Mitchell took over Waikato ahead of the 2004 National Provincial Championship. In his first season in charge, Waikato bowed out at the Semi Finals after losing to Wellington 28–16, while in 2005, they failed to make the play-offs at all, finishing seventh after the regular season.\nWestern Force.\nIn 2006, Mitchell became the first ever New Zealander to coach an Australia Super Rugby franchise when he took over the Western Force in their debut season of the expanded Super 14. In their first season they finished last with just a single victory, coming in Round 13 against the Cheetahs, winning 16–14. In their second season, they jumped up to seventh on the table picking up 6 victories before falling back down the table across the 2008, 2009 and 2010 seasons. Mitchell was released as coach in 2010.\nSouth Africa.\nMitchell took up a role in South Africa as Golden Lions head coach, before returning to the Super Rugby in 2011 with the Lions. On 29 October 2011 it was Kiwi against Kiwi in the 2011 Currie Cup final when Mitchell's Golden Lions hosted a star-studded The Sharks rugby team under fellow Kiwi John Plumtree in Johannesburg. The team included the full Springbok front row as well as seven more Springboks. The Golden Lions won the match 42–16 to win their first Currie Cup Championship in 12 years and also winning their first Currie Cup title on their home field in 61 years.\nOn 22 June 2012, he was suspended after complaints from Lions players regarding the manner in which they were treated by Mitchell. In November, he was found not guilty of all charges against him and reinstated as Lions head coach. However, on 23 November 2012, he quit as coach to take over as a technical adviser at the Lions. On 28 November 2012 after two seasons with the Lions, Mitchell then accepted a position at Sale Sharks in the UK towards the end of 2012. However, on 29 December 2012, Sale announced Mitchell had returned to South Africa citing \"personal reasons\".\nFollowing the 2015 Rugby World Cup, Mitchell applied for the vacant head coach position of the England national team, but Eddie Jones got the role instead.\nUnited States.\nUSA Rugby announced Mitchell on 4 January 2016 as the new head coach of the USA Eagles, taking over from Mike Tolkin on a four-year contract.\nMitchell's first match in charge was an uncapped match against Argentina XV in the inaugural Americas Rugby Championship. The game was drawn 35–35 in a game that included 11 uncapped players in the USA's team. Those 11 uncapped players were later officially capped a week later when Mitchell led USA to a 30–22 victory over Canada, the American's fourth consecutive victory over the Canadians. On 20 February, USA went top of the table with a 64–0 victory over Chile, however the States failed to keep hold of that position a week later when they were surprisingly beaten by Brazil in Barueri 24–23, with a last minute penalty to the Brazilians. It was the first ever meeting between the two nations, with Brazil earning their first ever victory over a tier 2 nation. On 5 March, Uruguay earned their first victory over the Americans since 2002, when they defeated the Eagles 29–25 in Montevideo. USA finished the Championship in second place with 15 points, 7 points behind Champions Argentina XV.\nIn June 2016, the United States put up a convincing display against Italy, going down 24–20. A week later, the United States beat rivals Russia 25–0. During the 2016 November internationals, Mitchell handed 6 players their international debut, across two test matches. The United States lost both test matches, 23–10 to Romania and 20–17 to Tonga. They were also defeated by the Māori All Blacks 54–7 at Toyota Park.\nIn March 2017, Mitchell led the United States to their first ever Americas Rugby Championship title, with victories over Brazil (51–3), Canada (51–34), Chile (57–9) and Uruguay (29–23) heading into the final week. Both the United States and Argentina XV were level on points leading into the Championship decider in the final week, which saw them draw for the second consecutive year - a bonus-point try in overtime to level the score and see the United States finish with 22 points on the table to Argentina's 21.\nMitchell helped the United States qualify for the 2019 Rugby World Cup as Americas 1, the first time they had done so with previous attempts seeing the States qualify as Americas 2 or 3. This came after they drew the first leg, Canada at home, 28–28, before the return fixture the following week in San Diego, which saw the Eagles win 52–16.\nIn 2017 he led the Eagles to winning the Americas Rugby Championship, the US first major tournament victory since the 1924 Olympics.\nBulls / Blue Bulls.\nOn 25 May 2017, it was announced that Mitchell would return to South Africa to become the Executive of Rugby at the , and that he would replace Nollis Marais as the head coach of the Super Rugby franchise. In August 2017, he also replaced Marais as the head coach of the Blue Bulls Currie Cup side.\nIn what turned out to be his only season with the Blue Bulls and Bulls, he led the Currie Cup side to fourth on the table.\nEngland.\nIn September 2018, Mitchell left his post with the South African franchise, and became defensive coach for the England national team. He experienced tremendous success and helped England mount an incredible World Cup campaign that saw them reach the final in 2019. Mitchell was then credited with being a rare and versatile coach who could coach both attack and defense at an elite level.\nJapan.\nIn February 2022, Mitchell joined Japan as defence coach\nEngland (Women).\nMitchell became the head coach of the England women's team after the 2023 Men's Rugby World Cup. He joined up with the team during the 2023 WXV tournament but did not officially take over as head coach until after the tournament. \nHonours.\nNew Zealand\nUnited States\nPersonal life.\nHis son Daryl has played international cricket for New Zealand."

        "title": "Dwight Foster (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Dwight Alexander Foster (born 2 April 1957) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player. He was drafted into the National Hockey League (NHL) in the first round, 16th overall in 1977 by the Boston Bruins. Besides Boston, he played for the Colorado Rockies, New Jersey Devils and Detroit Red Wings, before retiring in 1987 because of knee injuries.\nAmateur career.\nFoster was born in Toronto, Ontario. As a youth, he played in the 1968 and 1969 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournaments with minor ice hockey teams from Toronto.\nWhile playing for the Kitchener Rangers, he led the tough Ontario Hockey League in scoring, Foster was a highly rated prospect going into the 1977 NHL Entry Draft. The New York Islanders seriously considered selecting him 15th overall, but settled on future Hall of Fame forward Mike Bossy instead. Foster was known as a strong defensive forward with marginal offensive ability (his OHL scoring title notwithstanding), while Bossy was a prolific scorer who was not very physical. In the end, Islanders coach Al Arbour convinced general manager Bill Torrey that he should pick Bossy, arguing that it was easier to teach a scorer how to check.\nFoster went next to Boston. That same year, he helped Team Canada win the silver medal at the World Junior Championships.\nProfessional career.\nBoston Bruins.\nFoster's career got off to a great start when he scored a goal in his first NHL game but things came crashing down just 14-games into the season when he tore the cartilage in his left knee requiring season-ending surgery. The following year he boosted his games played to 44, with another 22 spent with the Bruins' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Rochester Americans. Foster had a hard time earning the trust of Bruins coach Don Cherry. While he dressed for all eleven playoff games that spring he was used sparingly, including a three-second appearance in Boston's Game 7 semifinal loss versus Montreal which ended their season. After splitting time between the NHL and the AHL his first three seasons, Foster finally earned a full-time job for the 1980–81 season and chipped in 24 goals and 52 points for the Bruins. Foster centered Bruins' top scorer Rick Middleton and veteran winger Stan Jonathan but the next year Foster signed a free agent contract with the Colorado Rockies that summer and left Boston.\nColorado Rockies/New Jersey Devils.\nAs compensation to the Bruins for signing Foster, the Rockies agreed to a trade that sent their second round pick in the 1982 NHL Entry Draft to Boston along with the option to swap first round picks in 1982. The deal proved costly for Colorado when the Rockies finished in last place, gifting the Bruins the first overall draft pick, which they used to select Gord Kluzak.\nFoster struggled in Colorado while battling shoulder and groin injuries that limited his effectiveness; his goal total dropped by half from the previous season and his 31-points placed him eighth on the team. The franchise relocated to New Jersey for the following season but after just four games with the newly minted New Jersey Devils, the organization cut their losses and he was traded to the Detroit Red Wings with the Devils receiving one US dollar in exchange.\nDetroit Red Wings.\nInjuries continued to plague Foster with the Red Wings, but he did bounce back to score 17-goals his first year in Detroit, while being limited to 58 games. It would prove to be the high-water mark for games played during his time in Motown while he battled shoulder and knee injuries. During his fourth season with the Red Wings, he was shipped back to Boston in a late-season trade for Dave Donnelly.\nSecond stint with Boston.\nFoster was held off the score sheet in the 13-games he played for the Bruins to wrap up the 1985–86 season but he did chip in two points in three playoff games that spring. He returned to the Bruins for the 1986–87 season but struggled with just four goals in 47-games and suffered yet another knee injury that required surgery. When the Bruins did not offer him a contract for the 1987-88 campaign, Foster retired, finishing with 274 points in 541 career games.\nPersonal life.\nFoster is a father of four: Dwayne, Peter, Alex and Genevieve. Foster's son Alex is also a professional ice hockey player. Foster's son Peter received a scholarship to the United States Air Force Academy as a goaltender and played for the Air Force Falcons for four years."

        "title": "Luke Easter (baseball)",
        "text": "Luscious \"Luke\" Easter (August 4, 1915 – March 29, 1979) was an American professional baseball player in Major League Baseball and the Negro leagues. He batted left-handed, threw right-handed, was , and weighed 240 lb.\nEarly life.\nLuke Easter was born in Jonestown, Mississippi to parents James and Maude Easter. His father was a graduate of the Tuskegee Institute.\nHis mother, Maude, died in 1922 and the family moved to St. Louis, Missouri where his father worked in a glass factory. Prior to that time, the Easters had been farmers in the Mississippi Delta. Luke Easter attended the same high school as fellow Negro league star, Quincy Trouppe, before dropping out in the ninth grade. For the next few years, Easter worked a variety of jobs such as shoeshiner, hat making, and for a dry cleaner.\nAlthough Easter was good enough to be a professional player, there was no Negro league franchise in St. Louis. So, in 1937 Easter joined the top team in the area, a semipro outfit called the St. Louis Titanium Giants. The team was made up of African-Americans employed by the National Lead Company. Players would work their factory jobs during the week, often with time off to practice, then play baseball for the company on weekends. Easter earned $20 per week plus another ten to twenty on the weekends playing baseball. Luke Easter was a very large man, standing in height and weighing around . A left-handed hitting first baseman, he was known for towering home runs. During his five years with the Giants, they fielded a very competitive team. Also featuring Sam Jethroe, they went 6–0 in exhibitions against teams from the Negro American League in 1940.\nWith World War II raging and America soon to enter the fray, Luke Easter planned to enlist in the United States Army in 1941. However, while returning from a trip to Memphis, Tennessee with Sam Jethroe, Easter was involved in an auto accident that left him with a fractured leg. Luscious \"Luke\" Easter, serial number 37 368 805, was finally inducted into the Army at Jefferson Barracks in St. Louis on June 22, 1942. Assigned to the Quartermaster Corps after basic training, he was stationed at Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri, about southwest of St. Louis. Easter was separated from the Army at Fort Leonard Wood on July 3, 1943, and thereafter worked in the defense industry.\nFollowing the war's end in 1945, Luke Easter had tryouts with two Negro National League teams, the Kansas City Monarchs and the Chicago American Giants. Both teams felt he was too big and awkward to be a good ballplayer despite his previous success with the Titanium Giants. Manager \"Candy Jim\" Taylor of the American Giants elected not to sign Easter, but referred him to promoter Abe Saperstein—famous for being the founder of the Harlem Globetrotters. At that time, Saperstein was founding a new touring baseball team, the Cincinnati Crescents. Saperstein signed Easter, and after a successful 1946 season, sold him to the Homestead Grays.\nNegro and Major Leagues.\nEaster was a solid contributor to the Grays in 1947, and excelled in 1948. That year, he batted .363, tied for the league lead in home runs, and led the league in runs batted in. He led the Grays to a victory over the Birmingham Black Barons in the 1948 Negro World Series. His success attracted the attention of Bill Veeck, owner of the Cleveland Indians, who purchased his contract from the Grays. A knee injury in spring training in 1949 cost Easter a spot on the major league roster at the start of the season. He started the year in the Pacific Coast League with the San Diego Padres despite a mid-season operation on the knee, and continued to be a star, prompting coach Jimmie Reese to remark, \"Easter is the only player I ever saw who can hit a baseball as far as Babe Ruth.\" He again batted .363, along with 25 home runs and 80 RBIs. This performance impressed the Indians so much that they called Easter up for a brief appearance at the end of the season, and, early in 1950, traded All-Star Mickey Vernon to open up first base for him.\nAs a 34-year-old rookie, Easter continued his power hitting, ranking among the league leaders in home runs and RBIs, and led the league in times hit by pitch. He continued to produce in 1951 and 1952, finishing 13th in Most Valuable Player voting in the latter year, but ongoing knee and ankle problems, as well as advancing age, brought his major league career to an end. He played in only 68 major league games in 1953, spending part of the year at Triple-A, and finished his major league career with six games in 1954.\nEaster continued to play professionally at Triple-A, even though the leg injuries had reduced his running speed to a limp. He played regularly for the Ottawa Athletics, Charleston Senators, Buffalo Bisons, and Rochester Red Wings, and won the International League's MVP award with the Bisons in 1957. He ultimately retired as a player in 1963 at the age of 48 and worked for several years thereafter as a coach. The Rochester Red Wings retired his uniform number used while playing for them (36), as did the Buffalo Bisons (25).\nIn 2008, Easter was inducted into the International League Hall of Fame.\nNotable home runs.\nAs a player, Easter was best known for his powerful home runs, colloquially known as \"Easter Eggs.\" On July 18, 1948, while with the Homestead Grays, Easter became the first player to hit a home run into the center field bleachers at New York's Polo Grounds during game action, a drive estimated at 490 feet. During his rookie season, he also hit the longest home run in the history of Cleveland's Municipal Stadium, a 477-foot blast over the auxiliary scoreboard in right field. The only other player to match that feat was Mickey Mantle, who did it in 1960. Finally, during his twilight days with the Bisons, he became the first player to hit a home run over the center field scoreboard at Buffalo's home park, Offermann Stadium, doing so twice in 1957. On June 14 he cleared the board, and newspapers reported the blow at an estimated 500 feet. On August 15, he hit the board near the top, and it went through a space between the board and a sign just above it.\nWhen told by a fan one time that the fan had seen Easter's longest home run in person, Easter is reported to have replied, \"If it came down, it wasn't my longest.\"\nPost-playing career.\nWhile playing with the Red Wings, Easter also began to serve as a coach, and, after his playing days were over, he continued in this role. Future major leaguers Boog Powell, Curt Blefary, and Canadian-born Pete Ward were among the players who credited Easter as a positive influence on their careers.\nAfter his days as a coach, Easter returned to the Cleveland area and went to work for the Aircraft Workers Alliance in 1964, eventually becoming the chief union steward for TRW in the east-side suburb of Euclid, Ohio.\nMurder.\nOn March 29, 1979, Easter was shot and killed outside a bank at East 260th Street and Euclid Avenue while transporting over $5,000 from payroll checks. Easter was approached by two robbers armed with shotguns and was shot twice at close range after refusing to turn over the funds.\nTributes.\nIn 1980, Woodland Hills Park in Cleveland's Mount Pleasant neighborhood was renamed Luke Easter Park in memoriam. A statue of Easter was also dedicated at his now namesake park.\nHistorical analysis.\nEaster was generally well-liked by teammates during his career, and most printed recollections by them refer to him as a good-natured practical joker. He owned and operated a sausage company while in Buffalo, and gave five pounds of sausage to every teammate who hit a home run. He was inducted into the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame in 1997, with that body citing his \"grace and dignity on and off the field\" and his \"legacy as a friend to the community, a generous soul with plenty of time for any cause.\" He had already become a charter member of the Buffalo Baseball Hall of Fame in 1985, and of the Rochester Red Wings Hall of Fame in 1989. Ned Garver remembered that his favorite type of pitches to hit were ones \"out over the plate and down\" in the strike zone.\nIn \"The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract\", baseball writer and statistician Bill James rated Easter as the second-best first baseman in the history of the Negro leagues, behind only Buck Leonard. He described Easter as \"an amiable, fun-loving man who gambled, wasn't 100% honest, and had a temper,\" with \"shoulders that crossed three lanes of traffic,\" but also claimed that \"if you could clone him and bring him back, you'd have the greatest power hitter in baseball today, if not ever.\"\nExternal links.\n and Seamheads, or Retrosheet"

        "title": "Baseball Bugs",
        "text": "Baseball Bugs is a 1946 Warner Bros. \"Looney Tunes\" theatrical animated cartoon directed by Friz Freleng. The short was released on February 2, 1946, and stars Bugs Bunny.\nPlot.\nA baseball game takes place at the Polo Grounds in New York City, featuring the Gas-House Gorillas and the Tea Totallers. The former, a burly and intimidating team reminiscent of the real-life Gashouse Gang, dominates the elderly players of the home team and intimidates the umpire with their aggressive play. Bugs Bunny, observing from his burrow in the outfield, becomes incensed by the unfair tactics of the Gorillas and challenges them.\nForced to play all positions against the Gorillas, Bugs employs clever strategies to level the playing field. Despite initial setbacks, Bugs showcases his athleticism and wit, thwarting the Gorillas' attempts to maintain their dominance. Through comedic antics and resourcefulness, Bugs manages to score runs and outsmart his opponents, much to their chagrin.\nAs the game progresses, Bugs finds himself in a decisive moment in the final inning, with the Gorillas closing in on victory. In a dramatic climax, Bugs embarks on a daring pursuit to retrieve a home run ball launched out of the stadium. With ingenuity and determination, Bugs ultimately secures the ball atop the Umpire State Building, ensuring victory for his team.\nProduction notes.\n\"Baseball Bugs,\" directed by Friz Freleng and written by Michael Maltese, features voice characterizations by Mel Blanc, along with additional uncredited performances by Bea Benaderet, Frank Graham, and Tedd Pierce. The title serves as a double entendre, playing on the term \"Bugs\" as both a nickname for eccentric individuals and a nod to sports fandom. This cartoon also draws inspiration from a previous Columbia Pictures production, \"Football Bugs,\" released in 1936.\nReception.\nAccording to animation historian Michael Barrier, there was a noticeable shift in the portrayal of Bugs Bunny's adversaries before and after World War II. Prior to the war, his foes were often portrayed as bumbling fools whom Bugs held in disdain. However, in films directed by Freleng and others post-war, the antagonists became more formidable and menacing. This change added an extra layer of satisfaction to Bugs' clever maneuvers and triumphs. In \"Baseball Bugs\" specifically, the antagonists take the form of the Gas-House Gorillas. \"A whole team of interchangeable ... hulking, blue-jawed, cigar chewing monsters\".\nBugs launches a fastball from the pitcher's mound, accelerates past it, and moves in position at home plate to catch it. This is a demonstration of cartoon physics, since such acceleration would be impossible in real life.\nHome media.\nVHS:\nLaserDisc:\nDVD:\nBlu-ray:\nDVD/Blu-ray:"

        "title": "Chris Anderson (rugby)",
        "text": "Christopher Anderson (born 2 May 1952) is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1970s and 1980s, and coached in the 1990s and 2000s. An Australian Kangaroos and New South Wales Blues representative winger, he featured in Canterbury-Bankstown's third grand final win and captained Halifax to both League and Cup success.\nAs a coach, Anderson took Australia to victory in the 2000 World Cup victory and coached both Canterbury-Bankstown and Melbourne Storm to premiership wins. He is also a member of the Halifax Hall of Fame. His nickname was \"Opes\". \nPlaying career.\nAnderson was a who was recruited by Peter Moore from Forbes, New South Wales, where he attended Red Bend Catholic College. As a flankman for the Canterbury side, Anderson gave the club a vital tryscoring power which had been quite absent from Belmore throughout the 1950s and 1960s. In 1974, when Canterbury-Bankstown reached the Grand Final, Anderson broke Morrie Murphy's 1947 record of sixteen tries for the club.\nHe also played in England for Widnes. Anderson played left wing in Widnes' 2–3 defeat by Bradford Northern in the 1974–75 Player's No.6 Trophy Final during the 1974–75 season at Wilderspool Stadium, Warrington on Saturday 25 January 1975. Also during the 1974–75 Northern Rugby Football League season he was flown to England to play on the wing for Widnes in their 14–7 victory over Warrington in the 1975 Challenge Cup Final at Wembley Stadium, London on Saturday 10 May 1975.\nAnderson surpassed Eddie Burns' club record for Canterbury-Bankstown of 65 tries in 1978.\nAnderson represented Australia in eight tests, including the 1975 World Cup and two Kangaroo Tours in 1978 and 1982. He also represented New South Wales in the experimental 1980 State of Origin game. In the third Origin encounter of 1983 (his last representative match), Anderson became the first ever player to score a hat-trick of tries in a State of Origin match, although the Blues lost 22–43. That season Anderson scored nineteen tries for the Bulldogs, a club record until Nigel Vagana scored twenty-three in 2002.\nAfter struggling with a broken arm during 1984, and being dropped to reserve grade for the latter part of the NSWRL season, Anderson became captain-coach of Halifax between late 1984 and May 1988 where he enjoyed great success, including winning the Championship during the 1985–86 season, and played in the 19-18 victory over St. Helens in the 1987 Challenge Cup Final during the 1986–87 season at Wembley Stadium, London on Saturday 2 May 1987. He played stand-off in almost all his games for Halifax.\nCoaching career.\nAnderson is one of the few people to play and coach competition winning sides in both Australia and England. He is also one of the few people to coach two different clubs to NRL/NSWRL Premiership success. Anderson returned to Australia after playing/coaching in the British 1987–88 season and was appointed coach of the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs Under 21s team for the 1989 season.\nAnderson was quickly appointed as Canterbury's first grade coach for 1990 and enjoyed eight fruitful seasons at Canterbury, including the 1995 Premiership triumph over the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles.\nThe formation of the Melbourne Storm saw Anderson become their first coach. His son, Ben, played 17 games for Melbourne. Anderson was appointed coach of the Australian national team in March 1999, replacing Wayne Bennett. Then he guided the Storm to Premiership success when they defeated the St. George Illawarra Dragons in the 1999 NRL Grand Final. Anderson was coach of the Australian team to compete in the end of season 1999 Rugby League Tri-Nations tournament. In the final against New Zealand the Kangaroos won 22–20.\nAfter seven rounds (and only two wins) of the 2001 NRL season Anderson quit as Melbourne Storm coach. On the 2001 Kangaroo Tour, when coaching Australia, Anderson, was taken to a Wigan hospital after complaining of chest pains during the first half of the deciding third test match against Great Britain at the JJB Stadium. He had suffered a non-fatal myocardial infarction but made a full recovery.\nAnderson was appointed coach of the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks for two seasons in 2002 and 2003, getting them one game short of the Grand Final in 2002. Anderson was sacked in dramatic circumstances over disagreements with the club's management on the future direction of the team, largely centred on his decision to replace the existing , Preston Campbell with new signing Brett Kimmorley in the starting side. He also continually picked his son, Jarrad, at the expense of Matt King, who ended up moving to the Melbourne Storm where his career blossomed. At the end of the 2003 NRL season, he went on the 2003 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France, coaching Australia to victory over Great Britain in what would be the last time the two nations contested an Ashes series. After five successful seasons Anderson's tenure as coach of Australia came to a halt following the successful 2003 whitewash of Great Britain.\nIn July 2004, Anderson was appointed coach of the Newport Gwent Dragons – a Welsh rugby union team for a 2 year deal despite having never previously coached a rugby union team. Despite finishing fourth in the Celtic League that season, his one-year contract was not renewed.\nAnderson accepted a two-year contract with the Sydney Roosters as their first grade coach for the 2007 and 2008 NRL seasons. However, Anderson stepped down from the job late into the 2007 season, after eleven losses from sixteen matches – including a horrific 56-0 loss to Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles. He was replaced by former Sydney Roosters Brad Fittler.\nRecognition.\nAnderson is a Halifax Hall of Fame Inductee and was awarded the Australian Sports Medal on 24 October 2000 for his contribution to Australian rugby league."

        "text": "A cricket or saddle is a ridge structure designed to divert water on a roof around the high side of a large penetration, typically a skylight, equipment curb, or chimney. In some cases, a cricket can be used to transition from one roof area to another. On low-slope and flat roofs with parapet walls, crickets are commonly used to divert water to the drainage, against or perpendicular to the main roof slope.\nThe pitch of a cricket is sometimes the same as the rest of the roof, but not always. For Steep-slope roofs, it is most common to have the cricket pitch to be equal to or less than the main roof, however for low-slope or flat roofs, it is more common to see the cricket be at least 50% greater slope than the roof, to minimize ponding. Smaller crickets (on steep-slope roofs only) are covered with metal flashing, and larger ones can be covered with the same material as the rest of the roof."

        "title": "Anthony Carter (American football)",
        "text": "Anthony “AC” Carter (born September 17, 1960) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver for 13 years in the United States Football League (USFL) and National Football League (NFL). He made three-consecutive Pro Bowls for the Minnesota Vikings and was honored by Minnesota as one of the 50 Greatest Vikings of all time. Carter played college football for the Michigan Wolverines, finishing his career as a three-time All-American, and a two-time unanimous All-American selection. He is currently third all-time in receiving yards, and second all-time in receiving touchdowns for the University of Michigan.\nCollege career.\nCarter played at the University of Michigan from 1979 to 1982. Although the Wolverines employed an offense that relied mostly on its running backs, he was one of the most productive receivers in the school's history. Standing 5 feet, 11 inches tall and weighing only 160 pounds, Carter relied on his speed to make plays and provided an effective counterpoint to coach Bo Schembechler's running game plan. In addition to his duties as a receiver, he was also the team's kickoff and punt returner for most of his career.\nDuring his freshman season, Carter was used sparingly. He caught more than two passes in a game only once that season, but made the most of it when the ball was thrown to him. Seven of his 17 receptions were touchdowns, and he averaged 27.2 yards per catch.\nHis 45-yard TD catch and run against Indiana as time ran out to give Michigan a 27–21 victory is considered one of the greatest plays in Michigan football history, and the radio call by the legendary Bob Ufer is also considered a classic. In that game, Lee Corso's Indiana Hoosiers had tied it up with about a minute to go. At that time, college games could end in a tie, and Michigan had a 6–1 overall record, 4–0 in the Big Ten. While a tie was essentially as good as a win from Indiana's perspective, a tie was as good as a loss from Michigan's perspective. On the ensuing drive, Michigan was only able to get to the Indiana 45-yard line with time fast running out. Things looked grim, but with six seconds remaining, Carter told quarterback John Wangler in the huddle, \"Hey, Johnny. Throw the ball to me. I'm going to be open.\" On the next play, Carter, sprinting left to right, met Wangler's pass in a seam over the middle at the Hoosier 25. He made a one-step cutback to his left to avoid one tackle and slipped another tackle at the 5-yard line before bounding into the endzone after time had expired.\nBy his sophomore year, Carter was the Wolverines primary option at receiver. That season, he became the first second-year player to be voted Michigan team Most Valuable Player. A three-time All-American, he was named Big Ten Conference MVP his senior season, and finished fourth in voting for the Heisman Trophy. He was the third NCAA Division I FBS athlete to total 1000 career yards on both kick returns and punt returns. He holds the NCAA career record for highest average gain per play (Min. 5,000 yards, 275-374 plays, 5,197 on 298).\nIn 2001 Carter was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame.\nOn December 12, 2014 the Big Ten Network included Carter on \"The Mount Rushmore of Michigan Football\", as chosen by online fan voting. Carter was joined in the honor by Charles Woodson, Tom Harmon, and Desmond Howard.\nRecords.\nWhen he graduated, Carter held nearly every Michigan career receiving and return record. He was the school's all-time leader in:\nHis average of 17.4 yards-per-play was an NCAA record.\nProfessional career.\nUpon graduating from college, Anthony Carter chose to play in the upstart USFL, rather than in the NFL. The league employed a territorial draft, aimed at sending players to teams whose fans were already familiar with them. Because of this unique system, the Michigan Panthers were allowed to select Carter prior to the league's traditional draft.\n1983 was Carter's first season with the Panthers and one of his most successful as a professional. Although the team started 1-4, they finished the regular season 12-6 and went on to defeat the Philadelphia Stars to win the first USFL championship. With his team behind late in the fourth quarter, he scored the game-winning touchdown on a 48-yard pass from Bobby Hebert. He finished the game with nine receptions for 179 yards. For the season, he gained 1,081 yards on 60 catches, nine of them touchdowns.\nCarter's 1984 season was cut short after only six games when his arm was broken in a game against the San Antonio Gunslingers. Before the 1985 season the Panthers merged with the Oakland Invaders. In his last USFL season, he led his team in receiving yards (1,323), receptions (70), and receiving touchdowns (14).\nAfter the 1985 USFL season, Carter signed with the NFL's Miami Dolphins, who drafted Carter back in 1983 in order to secure his NFL rights. However, he was traded to the Minnesota Vikings before playing a game with the team. He led the Vikings in receptions five of his first six seasons with the team, and was selected to the Pro Bowl in 1987, 1988, and 1989. In the 1987 season, Carter helped his team reach the NFC championship. He set an NFL playoff record (since surpassed) with 143 punt return yards in their wildcard win over the New Orleans Saints, and caught 10 receptions for a then NFL playoff record 227 yards, along with 1 carry for 30 yards and two punt returns for 21 in the Vikings 36-24 upset win over the 13-2 San Francisco 49ers in the divisional playoff round. The 642 all purpose yards he gained in the 1987 playoffs remain a single postseason record.\nThe following season, he caught 4 passes for 102 yards in a 28-17 wild card round win over the Los Angeles Rams. Although Cris Carter became the team's number one receiver in 1991, Anthony Carter remained an effective offensive weapon through 1993, his final season with the team.\nThe final two years of Carter's pro career were spent in the same state where it began, this time with the Detroit Lions. Most of his time with the Lions was spent attempting to come back from injury. He played in only four games in 1994, and failed to catch a pass in 1995.\nCarter finished his 11 NFL seasons with 486 receptions for 7,733 yards and 55 touchdowns. He also rushed for 289 yards and 2 touchdowns, returned 15 punts for 165 yards, and returned 4 kickoffs for 65 yards."

        "text": "Wilbur Gary Bell (born November 17, 1936), nicknamed Ding Dong, is an American former Major League Baseball pitcher. He pitched from 1958 to 1969 for four teams in his career, but is noted primarily for his time with the Cleveland Indians. During a 12-year baseball career, Bell compiled 121 wins, 1,378 strikeouts, and a 3.68 earned run average in 519 games (233 starts).\nIn his first two years, Bell compiled a 28–21 record as part of the Cleveland pitching rotation. In 1960, his record was 5–1 after the first month of play, but shoulder problems developed, causing him to win just four of his last 13 decisions. In late August, he was shut down for the remainder of the season. The following year, Bell got off to a slow start with an 0–4 record, and finished with a 12–16 record and a 4.10 ERA in 34 starts. Physical problems as well as issues with pitch control were tabbed as the main reasons for his continued struggles.\nIn 1962, Bell was converted into a reliever, helping the Indians by picking up over 10 saves in and . In , Bell went 8–5 with five saves and a 2.95 ERA in 58 appearances (seven starts). Despite this, the Indians finished the season under .500 (79–83). Bell was a fastball pitcher early in his career and then developed a slider and curveball.\nAfter 10 seasons with Cleveland, Bell was traded to the Boston Red Sox on June 4, 1967, for Tony Horton and Don Demeter. In his final full season with the Indians, he had gone back to being a starter and went 14–15 with a 3.22 ERA in 40 games (37 starts). He became a part of the Red Sox 1967 World Series hopes, but they lost to the St. Louis Cardinals. Bell pitched in three games (one start), going 0–1 with a 5.06 ERA. After two fairly solid seasons with Boston, he became a draftee of the expansion Seattle Pilots in . After going 2–6 with a 4.70 ERA in 13 games (11 starts) for the Pilots, he was traded to the Chicago White Sox in exchange for Bob Locker on June 8, 1969. Bell was released by the White Sox at the end of the season.\nTommy John became friends with Bell while both pitchers were with the Indians. John described Bell as \"a free-spirited, happy-go-lucky righthanded starter and one of the biggest drinkers on the team.\" He was a serious competitor with a great sense of humor.\nBell is a current resident of San Antonio, Texas."

        "text": "Colin John Campbell (born January 28, 1953) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey defenceman, coach and current executive vice president and director of hockey operations of the National Hockey League (NHL). As a player, he featured in the 1982 Stanley Cup Finals with the Vancouver Canucks.\nPlaying career.\nCampbell spent his junior career with the Peterborough Petes of the Ontario Hockey Association (later the Ontario Hockey League). He was taken in the second round of the 1973 NHL Amateur Draft, 27th overall by the Pittsburgh Penguins, and also in the first round of the 1973 WHA Amateur Draft, 5th overall, by the Vancouver Blazers. After one season with the Blazers, Campbell signed on with Pittsburgh.\nCampbell went on to play for the Penguins, Edmonton Oilers, Vancouver Canucks, and Detroit Red Wings. A scrappy, physical defender, Campbell scored just 25 goals in 11 NHL seasons while accumulating almost 1300 penalty minutes.\nIn his 11-year NHL career, Campbell appeared in 636 NHL games, posting 25 goals and 103 assists for 128 points, along with 1292 penalty minutes. He also played 78 games in the WHA, recording 3 goals and 23 points along with 191 PIM.\nCoaching career.\nImmediately following his retirement in 1985, Campbell joined the Red Wings coaching staff under head coach Jacques Demers. During the 1988 Stanley Cup Playoffs, Campbell and assistant general manager Neil Smith discovered several Red Wings players, including Bob Probert and Petr Klima, out past curfew. The incident occurred at a suburban Edmonton bar called \"Goose Loonies\", and led to an apology being issued by Demers. Campbell left the Red Wings after the dismissal of Demers in 1990.\nCampbell then joined the New York Rangers as an associate coach for 1991–92, parts of 1992–93, and 1993–94. He was the head coach for the Rangers' top affiliate; the Binghamton Rangers of the American Hockey League for half of the 1992–93 season.\nAfter head coach Mike Keenan left the Rangers after their Stanley Cup win in 1994, Campbell was promoted to take over for him.\nIn the strike-shortened NHL season that followed, Campbell led the Rangers to a fourth-place finish in the Atlantic Division. That was good enough to get the Rangers into the playoffs as the 8th and lowest seed, where they faced the Eastern Conference regular season champion and top-seeded Quebec Nordiques in the first round. The Rangers won the series in six games and handed the franchise its final series defeat in Quebec. The Rangers faced the Philadelphia Flyers in the second round and were promptly swept out of the playoffs.\nCampbell led the Rangers back to the playoffs in 1995–96, as the team finished second behind the Flyers in the division. They then defeated the Montreal Canadiens in the opening series in six games after losing the first two but fell to the Pittsburgh Penguins in five games in the conference semifinals.\nIn 1996–97 Campbell's Rangers had their best and longest playoff run. Finishing fourth in their division but fifth in the conference, the Rangers knocked out the defending conference champion Florida Panthers in five games in the Eastern Conference Quarterfinals. They then upset their divisional rivals, the New Jersey Devils, in five games to advance to play the Flyers in the Eastern Conference Finals, where their run ended in five games.\nAfter losing captain Mark Messier to free agency in the offseason and losing out on Joe Sakic in their quest to bring him to the team after the Colorado Avalanche matched the offer sheet the Rangers signed him to in 1997, Campbell's Rangers struggled out of the gate the next season and he was fired as coach after 57 games, and John Muckler replaced him. The Rangers would not make the playoffs that season, nor would they again until the 2005–06 season under head coach Tom Renney. Furthermore, the team also did not win another playoff series, nor mere postseason game until they swept the Atlanta Thrashers during the 2007 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals.\nExecutive career.\nShortly after being fired by the Rangers, Campbell was hired by the NHL as the league's Senior Vice President and Director of Hockey Operations, taking over from the departed Brian Burke. During Campbell's tenure, the NHL has faced a number of high-profile incidents that required Campbell's attention, most notably the Marty McSorley/Donald Brashear stick-swinging incident, which resulted in a year-long suspension for McSorley, and the Todd Bertuzzi hit on Steve Moore.\nDuring the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Campbell chaired a committee that looked into adjusting NHL rules, resulting in major changes for the 2005–06 NHL season.\nOn November 1, 2006, Campbell rejected a five-year, $7.5 million offer from the Philadelphia Flyers to be their general manager. There was speculation that he was holding out for the general manager job with the Toronto Maple Leafs (a position eventually filled by Brian Burke) after general manager John Ferguson Jr.'s contract was terminated in January 2008.\nOn November 15, 2010, TSN and various other media outlets reported on a string of emails from Colin Campbell. The email correspondence became a matter of public record in the wrongful dismissal case of referee Dean Warren against the NHL and the emails were entered into evidence in the case, although specific references to names and dates were blacked out. In these emails, Campbell calls Boston Bruins centre Marc Savard a \"little fake artist\" after Warren assessed Colin Campbell's son, Gregory Campbell, a high-sticking minor on Savard and sending further emails to director of officiating Stephen Walkom complaining about the work of referees who gave Gregory a late-game penalty that resulted in a tying goal. In a follow-up interview with TSN, Colin Campbell admitted \"it (the email content) was inappropriate. But no one told me or maybe told you five years ago that you can take your emails and read them all.\" Despite the controversy and the admission of inappropriate content and accusations of bias, the NHL posted a strong backing of Campbell on their website and he continued in his role as the Senior Vice President until stepping down on June 1, 2011, Brendan Shanahan replaced his position as Vice President of Player Safety. He stepped aside just prior to his son playing in the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals.\nDuring voting for the 2016 NHL All-Star Game, career enforcer John Scott was leading fan voting as captain of the Pacific Division. In a piece for the \"Players' Tribune\", John Scott revealed that one NHL executive attempted to shame him out of competing, asking how his children would feel about his participation. It was revealed many months later in a Twitter tirade from player Steve Downie that Colin Campbell was this executive.\nHe currently continues his role as Director of Hockey Operations."

        "text": "The 2006 World Series of Poker (WSOP) began on June 25, 2006, with satellite events, with regular play commencing on June 26 with the annual Casino Employee event and the Tournament of Champions held on June 28 and 29. Forty more events, in various disciplines including Omaha, seven-card stud and razz, plus ladies' and senior tournaments, led up to the 10,000 US$ no-limit Texas hold 'em main event starting July 28 and running through the final table on August 10.\nAll events were held at the Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, which marked the first time that a casino other than Binion's Horseshoe (now \"Binion's\") hosted the final table of the main event. Six days reserved for the first two rounds of play for the main event were established by Harrah's Entertainment, which has run the annual event since its purchase from the Binion family in 2004.\nThe first prize in the main event was $12 million (US$), at that time the richest prize for the winner of any sports or television event in history. The top 12 players became millionaires. The record prize was surpassed at the 2012 WSOP, when the winner of the $1 million buy-in Big One for One Drop, Antonio Esfandiari, received a first-place prize of $18.3 million.\nThe 2006 World Series featured a much-anticipated HORSE tournament with a $50,000 buy-in, the highest ever for a single WSOP event.\nHumberto Brenes, Phil Hellmuth, Chris Ferguson, and Alex Jacob tied for the most cashes during the WSOP, with eight each. Jeff Madsen, who won two events and made two other final tables (finishing 3rd both times), was named the 2006 WSOP Player of the Year (POTY). He barely edged Hellmuth, who also made four final tables.\nMain Event.\nThe 2006 Main Event (event #39) remains the largest tournament in poker history by prize pool with a total prize pool of $82,512,162. The tournament, like every WSOP Main Event, is a $10,000 No-Limit Texas Hold'em event. Due to the 8,773-player field, there were four separate starting days (1A-1D), each playing down to 800 people. They were later combined into one other set of separate days (2A and 2B) before becoming one whole group. The field was whittled down to 9 players on August 8, and Jamie Gold was crowned World Champion on August 10. The final table of the \"Main Event\" was offered live on Pay-Per-View, but unlike ESPN telecasts, viewers at home could not see the hole cards of the players unless the player turned their cards over.\nAlong with the usual $10,000 chip stacks, a new feature to the WSOP was the \"All-In\" button. Tournament directors have informed the participants that the coin could be used in lieu of pushing all of one's chips into the pot.\nThe beige $50,000 chips that were used in 2005 were not used in 2006. Instead, tangerine and yellow $25,000 chips, in the design of the current $25 chips, were used. And for the first time in World Series of Poker History, a $100,000 chip was introduced on day 7. The chips were mint green with black edge spots in the design of the current yellow/black $1,000 chip.\nOther high finishes.\n\"NB: This list is restricted to top 30 finishers with an existing Wikipedia entry.\"\nControversy.\nEvent 5.\nWhen play resumed during day 2 of this event, a table with players, Daniel Negreanu, Gavin Smith, and Kathy Liebert were given extra chips after tournament officials had misplaced Mirza Nagji's chips in the wrong seat. Unknowingly, the rest of the players assumed that this stack was someone else's who was late and blinded off the stack. Eventually a player noticed that the stack was Mirza Nagji's chips, who by that time had been given replacement chips. Players estimate that out of the extra 120,000 in chips that were put into play, around 10,000–11,000 in chips had already been blinded off from the empty stack.\nEvent 20.\nMany poker players who entered into the HORSE event discovered that the cards they were playing with were marked or easily markable. Andy Bloch was assessed a 10‑minute penalty for crumpling a card when a dealer refused to replace the deck after the new deck that came in was rife with markings. When asked for comment, WSOP Commissioner Jeffrey Pollack said, \"I hadn't heard anything about the cards being marked until today. I am looking into getting more fresh setups and I am definitely working on solving the problem.\"\nEvent 25.\nDuring Event 25, the $2,000 NL Hold 'em Shootout, the structure was changed mid-tournament from a full table into a 6-handed table event. Harry Demetriou, who had been playing in the event, objected to the change in format citing that a shootout should be 9, 10 or 11 handed, yelling about the unfair change in structure. Harry was eventually ejected from the tournament and was later refunded his money. Daniel Negreanu missed the event completely because he assumed that the event would be a full table and he would be able to come into the tournament a little bit later after sleeping in. However, by the time he showed up David Singer had won his table after blinding off Negreanu's stack."

He played 11 seasons in the NHL with the St. Louis Blues, Detroit Red Wings and the original Winnipeg Jets.\nPlaying career.\nBorn in Grostenquin, France, while his father was serving with the Canadian Armed Forces, MacLean moved to Canada at the age of two and grew up in Antigonish, Nova Scotia. \nAs a youth, he played in the 1971 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Borden. Once, during a QMJHL game in which he was playing for the Hull Olympiques, a deal was made to send MacLean to the Quebec Remparts, but the trade was called off before the game ended, after he had scored five goals. In the 1978–79 season, MacLean led the Dalhousie University Tigers to the AUHC championship with 12 goals, 17 assists and 71 penalty minutes in 18 games.\nMacLean was drafted by the NHL's St. Louis Blues.

The experience helped MacLean to excel when he finally did crack the NHL — he scored 36 goals in his rookie season after being traded to the Winnipeg Jets. He continued to enjoy success in Winnipeg on a line with Dale Hawerchuk, tallying three 30-goal seasons and three 40-goal seasons before being dealt to the Detroit Red Wings in exchange for Brent Ashton.\nMacLean was a member of the Campbell Conference All-Star Team in the 1985 NHL All-Star Game. After another 30-goal season for Detroit, he was traded back to St. Louis together with Adam Oates in exchange for Tony McKegney and Bernie Federko. In 1990–91, MacLean suffered a rib injury and retired after ten seasons with 324 goals and 349 assists for 673 points. His best season statistically was the 1984–85 season, where he scored 41 goals and 101 points. MacLean has the distinction of being the highest-scoring NHL player born in France, with 673 points. The second-highest scoring French-born player is Antoine Roussel (124 points) who moved to Canada as a teenager. Paul MacLean ranks 3rd all time in NHL Shooting percentage at 21.4% \nCoaching career.\nBefore becoming an NHL coach, MacLean served as the head coach of the Peoria Rivermen of the International Hockey League (IHL) from 1993 to 1996. For the 1996–97 season, he served as an assistant coach with the Phoenix Coyotes. From 1997 through 2000, MacLean returned to the IHL to serve as the head coach of the Kansas City Blades. From 2000 to 2002, he served as the head coach of the Quad City Mallards of the United Hockey League (UHL). In 2001, MacLean led the Mallards to the Colonial Cup Championship. The Mallards had a record of 112–27–9 (.787 winning percentage) in MacLean's two seasons behind the bench. MacLean was then hired as an assistant coach for the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim under Head Coach Mike Babcock. Babcock would bring MacLean with him to the Detroit Red Wings when he was hired to coach the Red Wings. In the 2007–08 NHL season, MacLean won the Stanley Cup as assistant coach of the Red Wings.\nOn June 14, 2011, the Ottawa Senators announced that MacLean had been hired for their head coaching job, his first head coaching job at the NHL level. On October 11, MacLean won his first NHL game as a head coach as the Senators defeated the Minnesota Wild 4–3 in a shootout.\nOn April 30, 2012, MacLean was named a finalist for the Jack Adams Award for NHL Coach of the Year alongside John Tortorella of the New York Rangers and Ken Hitchcock of the St. Louis Blues; Hitchcock would go on to win the award.\nOn May 17, 2013, MacLean was again nominated for the Jack Adams Award, his second in a row, alongside Bruce Boudreau of the Anaheim Ducks and Joel Quenneville of the Chicago Blackhawks. On June 14, 2013, MacLean was announced as the winner of the 2013 Jack Adams Award. On July 4, 2013, the Senators announced that MacLean had been signed to a three-year contract extension with the team.\nOn December 8, 2014, MacLean was fired from his position as head coach of the Senators as the team appeared poised to miss the playoffs. He was succeeded by Dave Cameron.\nOn June 30, 2015, MacLean was named the assistant coach of the Anaheim Ducks, working under head coach Bruce Boudreau.\nOn June 1, 2017, MacLean's contract with the Ducks expired, and was not renewed.\nOn November 21, 2019, the Columbus Blue Jackets announced that he has joined the organization as an Assistant Coach.\nOn September 25, 2020, MacLean was named the assistant coach of the Toronto Maple Leafs, working under head coach Sheldon Keefe. He then became an senior advisor to the team, until his departure upon the end of the 2021/22 NHL season.\nPersonal life.\nMacLean and his wife Sharon have three children — A. J., David and Erin. A.J. played professional hockey from 2004 to 2013, including a two year stint as captain and player-coach of the Dundee Stars of the EIHL. He is currently an assistant coach with the Toronto Marlies of the AHL. David is currently a professional scout for the Montreal Canadiens. Paul's brother Jerome lives in Ottawa, as does his sister Karen. He has a summer home in Antigonish, Nova Scotia. MacLean was born at RCAF #2 Fighter Wing (the Wing on-Base Hospital Grostenquin) in, Lorraine, France, to Canadian parents while his father was stationed there as part of NATO's RCAF #1 Air Division in Western Europe. \nHoward Cornfield, the former owner, president and general manager of the Quad City Mallards, said he hired MacLean on the spot after interviewing him in 2000. \"He has a look to him and he looks you in the eye,\" said Cornfield. \"It's hard to explain, but we came to call it 'The Grizz Look' as in grizzly bear. He looked you in the eye and you knew he was being very honest. He was speaking from the heart. He had incredible intensity and you walked away saying, 'This guy is serious.' When he came in and told me, 'I'm going to win you a championship,' you walked away knowing that this guy was going to do it.\""

        "title": "Major League Baseball on ABC",
        "text": "National television broadcasts of Major League Baseball (MLB) games have aired on ABC in various formats. The network first aired Saturday \"Major League Baseball Game of the Week\" games between 1953 and 1955, in 1960, and in 1965. ABC then televised MLB games from 1976 to 1989, airing \"Monday Night Baseball\", \"Thursday Night Baseball\", and \"Sunday Afternoon Baseball\" in various years during that period.\nMLB games aired on ABC again in 1994 and 1995 as part of The Baseball Network, the short-lived time-brokered package of broadcasts produced by Major League Baseball and split with NBC. After not televising MLB since The Baseball Network folded, and after the ABC Sports division merged with ESPN in 2006, ABC has aired selected games as part of its sister cable network's contract since 2020. The broadcasts since 2020 have been produced by ESPN, and have primarily used the \"ESPN Major League Baseball\" branding and graphics instead of the Major League Baseball on ABC branding.\nHistory.\nFrom 1953 until 1955, and again in 1960, ABC aired \"Major League Baseball Game of the Week\" telecasts, usually on Saturdays. In 1959, ABC broadcast the best-of-three playoff series (to decide the National League pennant) between the Milwaukee Braves and Los Angeles Dodgers.\nIn 1965, ABC returned to \"Game of the Week\" broadcasting with 28 regional Saturday and Holiday games.\nIn 1976, ABC began a new four year rights deal with MLB that included 16 new Monday night games, which increased to 18 in the next three years of the deal, as well as half the postseason (both League Championship Series in even numbered years and World Series in odd numbered years) and the All-Star Game in even numbered years. This contract was modified for the 1980, \"Monday Night Baseball\" telecasts were reduced to just five, with the rest of the games moved to Sunday afternoons.\nIn 1984, ABC agreed to a new six year rights deal with MLB. The playoff and All-Star Game television structure remained the same, while ABC increased their regular season games to 20. In 1989, the final season of ABC's deal before CBS took over, ABC moved their games to Thursday nights.\nIn 1994, ABC returned to MLB coverage with another six year rights deal. Under the deal, as part of The Baseball Network, ABC would air six weeks of regular season games on Saturday and Monday nights. In even numbered years, ABC had the rights to the World Series and Division Series, while in odd numbered years ABC had the rights to the All-Star Game and League Championship Series. However, these plans changed because of the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike. Because of the strike, which began on August 12, a significant amount of games were cancelled, including the 1994 World Series. ABC and NBC consequently, wound up sharing the rights to the 1995 World Series. Also because of the strike, The Baseball Network, a joint production between NBC and ABC, collapsed, and ABC ended their MLB rights following the 1995 season.\nIn 2020, ABC returned to MLB coverage once again. This time it was part of ESPN's Wild Card Series coverage, which was expanded due to the COVID-19 pandemic (ESPN and ABC are both primarily owned by The Walt Disney Company, and Disney integrated the ABC Sports division with ESPN in 2006). ABC aired three Wild Card Series games as part of this coverage. All coverage primarily used ESPN or ESPN on ABC branding. In 2021, ABC aired their first regular season game since 1995, an August 8 \"Sunday Night Baseball\" game between the Chicago White Sox and Chicago Cubs. That same year, ESPN and Major League Baseball agreed to a contract extension that included the exclusive rights to a new Wild Card Series. ABC will have the rights to air select games from the Series, as well as the rights to air select ESPN regular season games. ABC aired one game from the 2022 Wild Card Series.\nProduction overview.\nIn 1965, ABC brought forth such innovations like isolated instant replay, field microphones, and a separate camera for each base runner. After ABC's contract for the \"Game of the Week\" expired after a single season, NBC felt compelled to dramatically alter their own baseball coverage. So for NBC's coverage of the 1965 World Series, it featured videotaped replays, prerecorded audio analysis from key players, and enhanced animated graphics.\nWhen ABC resumed broadcasting Major League Baseball games in 1976 after an eleven-year hiatus, they were immediately accused of having ill-prepared production crews and announcers on their \"Monday Night Baseball\" telecasts. William Leggett of \"Sports Illustrated\" would in particular, note that ABC seemed to try to hoodwink viewers with commentary that may sound insightful, but was often dead wrong, and with fancy camera work that was frequently used at inappropriate times during the action. Leggett also criticized ABC for far too often losing batted balls and base runners from view and employing split screens with the wrong men on base. Not only that, but the starting lineups were not being given at the beginning of the games.\nAccording to James Walker, professor in the department of communication at Saint Xavier University and co-author of the book \"Center Field Shot: A History of Baseball on Television\", ABC brought the techniques it had perfected in its football coverage, including far more extensive use of replays, isolated cameras, and different angles. In contrast, when looking at NBC's production of the 1969 World Series, very few replays were utilized and it was a much more static broadcast than what you saw later.\nFor their coverage of the 1979 World Series in Baltimore, ABC brought two trucks (and rented a third), 14 cameras, a helicopter and nearly 100 technicians. According to producer Chuck Howard, that was just about twice the number of cameras used during the regular season, and at twice the cost. Director Chet Forte's team of cameramen was, in his words, \"built around the camera position high behind home plate (C-2).\" Their \"coverage camera\" was designed to follow the flight of the ball. ABC intended on using this camera 75 percent of the time and was according to Forte, the toughest camera in TV sports.\n1980s.\nABC, under the watch of director Joe Aceti, brought some innovations in time for their coverage of the 1980 National League Championship Series between the Houston Astros and Philadelphia Phillies, such as putting the camera in the gondola in the Astrodome looking straight down on the field. For tight shots, Aceti wanted to see the face of the pitcher and the face of the batter. He didn't want them shown in a split screen but separately in a close-up. He also didn't want to shot players head to toe in a long shot, not even in a medium shot.\nChet Forte's directing performance would come under scrutiny when ABC next broadcast the World Series in 1981. For one thing, ABC's replay cameras, which were placed strategically around the park, don't always catch the play. For example, ABC only showed one replay from the main feed camera of New York Yankees third baseman Graig Nettles making a diving, eighth-inning catch of Los Angeles Dodgers first baseman Steve Garvey's liner in Game 1. ABC was also criticized for frequently showing all those players' wives cheering instead of giving viewers a wide- angle view of how the outfielders are playing the hitters.\nDavid Remnick of the \"Washington Post\" felt that Howard Cosell while broadcasting the 1983 World Series alongside Al Michaels and Earl Weaver, developed a few \"human interest\" tags and rammed them home in his inimitable ecclesiastical rhythms instead of actually sharing his knowledge with viewers. To put things into perspective, Remnick noted that Cosell had more to say about the way the Baltimore groundskeepers combated the outfield's \"slippage factor\" with a miraculous \"drying agent\" than about Mike Boddicker's pitching. Remnick also said that Cosell had more to say about the refurbished buildings in downtown Baltimore and along the Schuylkill River than about Mike Schmidt's hitting. Or Cosell would talk about John Denny's family problems more often than his ability to strike out Eddie Murray. Remnick in particular, criticized ABC for featuring interviews interspersed with the game action, which would sometimes cause them to miss a double off the wall while a prerecorded player is gabbing up in the corner of the screen. Not only that, but Remnick accused Howard Cosell of did his best to ruin a great camera shot of John Lowenstein's theft of a home run in Game 1 by simultaneously praising the shot and rapping other networks for praising their own shots.\nGame 6 of the 1985 World Series would become rooted in controversy when the bottom of the ninth, Jorge Orta, the leadoff batter for the Kansas City Royals, hit a slow roller to St. Louis Cardinals first baseman Jack Clark, who tossed the ball to the pitcher, Todd Worrell, who was covering first base. Umpire Don Denkinger called Orta safe, even though television replays and photographs clearly showed that he was out by half a step. The Royals went on to win Game 6 by the score of 2–1. The first replay that ABC showed was a faraway shot from high along the third base side that froze upon Worrell's catch, with Orta's foot still seemingly in the air.\nNBC Sports executive producer Michael Weisman said that while he thought that ABC's coverage of the 1986 League Championship Series was overall fine, he didn't think that they held on with the stories long enough. For instance, Weisman thought that ABC should have kept a camera on California Angels third-base coach Moose Stubing longer in Game 2 of the American League Championship Series. Weisman thought that the camera should've followed Stubing into the dugout to see how his teammates reacted to him after he failed to give Bobby Grich a sign. Weisman also felt that ABC should have stayed with New York Mets first baseman Keith Hernandez longer after he was called out on strikes in Game 1 of the National League Championship Series against the Houston Astros and argued vehemently with umpire Doug Harvey.\nMeanwhile, Harry Coyle, NBC's coordinating producer and director of baseball also said that while he thought that ABC's 1986 LCS coverage was for the most part fine, he also said \"A shot of a wife can be a great shot, if you use it once or twice a game, like in the ninth inning of a close game and the pitcher is in trouble. But to show a batter, then his wife, then the batter, then his wife, then the batter, then his wife . . . well, that's ridiculous.\" When asked about ABC's use of a roof camera at the Astrodome, Coyle said \"If that shot is so great, why don't they sell seats up there.\"\nIn June 1987, ABC director Craig Janoff said that they didn't do quite the same thing as NBC since they would go two months without doing a game that season, and then they would do the World Series in October. Janoff added that baseball was the most challenging sport that he has directed for television because timing is critical. In other words, you have to think about where a fan's eyes move, and constant cutting from camera to camera is necessary.\nCome the World Series in 1987, Norman Chad of the \"Washington Post\" said that ABC's cameras miss nothing and offered unmatched replays. Meanwhile, ABC's graphics in Chad's eyes, provided better reading than some best sellers, while the announcers knew the game and talked intelligently about it. Furthermore, Chad said that ABC's cameras always showed runs as they were scored. In contrast, NBC sometimes failed to show players crossing the plate during their coverage of the League Championship Series. And whereas ABC's announcers almost always pulled back when the Metrodome crowd went into a frenzy in Minnesota, NBC's announcers according to Chad, sometimes added to the noise (except to go silent at game's end). Chad even believed that ABC captured the quirky nature of the Metrodome better than NBC, from intriguing camera shots to Al Michaels' play-by-play.\nWhen assessing ABC's coverage of the 1988 NLCS between the Los Angeles Dodgers and New York Mets, the \"Chicago Tribune\"s Steve Nidetz praised their camera work. Nidetz in particular, gave credit to producer Curt Gowdy Jr., who was responsible for calling all the shots for ABC's NLCS coverage. Instead of subjecting viewers to long-range angles of baseballs floating into the air, ABC had closeups everywhere, from the dugout to the field to the stands. In contrast, ABC's production of the 1988 ALCS between the Oakland Athletics and Boston Red Sox under director Steve Danz, cameramen kept missing plays and according to Jim Sarni of the \"South Florida Sun-Sentinel\", seemed to be preoccupied showing the Harvard rowing crew on the Charles.\nAgain as previously mentioned, Game 3 of 1989 World Series was scheduled to begin at San Francisco's Candlestick Park on October 17 at 5:35 PDT, ABC began its pre-game show at 5:00 PDT. When the Loma Prieta earthquake struck at approximately 5:04 PDT, Tim McCarver was narrating taped highlights of Game 2, which had been played two days prior across the Bay Bridge in Oakland. Television viewers saw the video signal begin to break up, heard McCarver repeat a sentence as the shaking distracted him, and heard Al Michaels exclaim, \"I'll tell you what, we're having an earth – .\" At that moment, the signal from Candlestick Park was lost. The network put up a green ABC Sports \"World Series\" technical difficulties telop graphic while it scrambled to repair the video feed (the broadcast cameras and mics were powered by the local power supply), but audio from the stadium was restored after a few seconds via a telephone link:\nAl Michaels: Well, heh, I don't know if we're on the air... We are in commercial, I guess.\nJim Palmer: Yes, yes, we hear you.\nTim McCarver: I guess...\nMichaels: I don't hear a thing.\nMcCarver: I guess Dave Parker...\nMichaels: Well, heh, I don't know if we're on the air or not, and I'm not sure I care at this particular moment but we are. Well, folks, that's the greatest open in the history of television! Bar none!\nMcCarver: Started with a bang!\nMichaels: Yes, it certainly did! Heh! We're still here! Heh! We are still, as we can tell, on the air, and I guess you are hearing us, even though we have no picture and no return audio, and we will be back, we hope, from San Francisco, in just a moment.\nThe combined screams of excitement and panic from fans who had no idea of the devastation elsewhere could be heard in the background. ABC then switched to episodes of \"Roseanne\" and \"The Wonder Years\", which was on standby for a rain delay situation, while attempting to restore electricity to its remote equipment. With anchorman Ted Koppel in position in Washington, D.C., ABC News began continuous coverage of the quake at 5:32 p.m. PDT, with Al Michaels, in the process, becoming a de facto on-site reporter for ABC. The Goodyear Blimp had already been overhead to cover the baseball game, and ABC used it to capture images of damage to the Bay Bridge and other locations.\n1995.\nJerry Trecker of the \"Hartford Courant\" praise ABC's production of the 1995 All-Star Game in Arlington. He said that the broadcast crew of Al Michaels, Tim McCarver, and Jim Palmer paced their broadcast as if they had never been away, and the different looks, especially ground level cameras, had always been a trademark of effective work by ABC. ABC also according to him, made effective use of graphics to recap season leaders. ABC Sports' technical coverage as a whole, included 21 cameras from all vantage points, including one in the Goodyear Blimp, and an unmanned camera directly above home plate. Coaches would wear wireless microphones.\nTrecker did, however, point out that times, the broadcasters seemed to be ahead of the production people, especially when they wanted to talk about Raul Mondesi's speed getting to a drive into the right field corner. They never showed it. Trecker also believed that ABC's usage of dugout reporters (in this case, Lesley Visser, John Saunders, and Rick Dempsey), even in showcase games like the All-Star Game, was overkill. Visser in particular, was singled out for asked such lengthy questions of Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Hideo Nomo that it was almost farcical when his answers came back in translation.\nFor the 1995 World Series, ABC and NBC shared 17 cameras and 13 tape machines, two of the \"Super Slo-Mo\" variety.\nMajor League Baseball coverage on ABC's owned-and-operated television stations.\nHistorically, KTRK was the original television home of the Houston Astros, from the team's inaugural season in 1962 until 1971; however, the station only aired the team's Sunday afternoon road games. It also broadcast any Astros games that were part of ABC's broadcast contract with Major League Baseball from 1976 to 1989.\nOn December 12, 2014, WLS-TV signed a new five-year broadcast agreement with the Chicago Cubs, in which WLS would televise 25 of the Major League Baseball team's games per year, starting with the 2015 season. The arrangement partially replaced one with WGN-TV (which had broadcast Cubs games since its inception in April 1948), which voluntarily pulled out of its existing broadcast deal with the team for the 2015 season and subsequently agreed to carry a reduced slate of 45 games. The WLS broadcasts were seen on DirecTV's version of MLB Extra Innings, and the feed provided is the WLS signal seen in the Chicago market (unlike with the feeds of WGN broadcasts, where public service announcements were seen in place of local commercials and station promos). As ABC had a limited sports programming schedule during the Major League Baseball season prior to September (when the MLB regular season and college football season overlap), the station mainly carried the team's weekend daytime games in order to limit pre-emptions of the network's prime time programming."

Out of his 17 games with the Toronto Raptors he started 12, averaging 9.6 points per game in 27.1 minutes. He re-signed with the Raptors on July 30, 2012. During his time with the Raptors, Anderson became a bit of a polarizing figure amongst fans. Some praised his defensive efforts, while others referred to him as a ball-hog, the latter was especially evident after his overtime performance against the Miami Heat on January 24, 2013. Upon making two baskets in overtime, Anderson proceeded to shoot on every offensive possession afterwards, missing his next six shots (5 of those attempts and misses were 3-point attempts).

        "text": "Australia sent a delegation to compete at the 1956 Winter Olympics from the 26 January to 5 February 1956 in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy. This was the nation's third appearance at the Winter Olympic Games with their last appearance being in 1952.\nAustralia delegation consisted of eight competitors in three sports. Australia competed in alpine skiing, figure skating and speed skating. Australia best result from the 1960 Games was a seventh-place finish from Colin Hickey in the men's 500 metres and men's 1500 metres speed skating. This performance also was Australia's best result until the 1976 Winter Olympics, where Colin Coates came sixth in men's 10000 metres speed skating.\nBackground.\nThe Australian Olympic Committee was formed on 1 January 1895 with the nation making their debut at the first Olympics in Athens with Teddy Flack being the first representative of the nation. This was the nation's third appearance at an Winter Olympics. It was also the 15th overall Olympics that Australia had sent a delegation in. The 1956 Winter Olympics was held at Cortina d'Ampezzo in Italy and took place from the 26 January to 6 February: a total of 821 athletes competed from 32 nations. The Australian delegation consist of eight athletes, five in the alpine skiing, two in the figure skating and one in the speedskating."

Australia's best result was Christine Smith's 27th place in downhill.\nThe games were marred by tragedy due to the deaths of Australian skier Ross Milne and Kazimierz Kay-Skrzypecki a Polish-born British luge athlete during practice.\nA minute's silence was given for them in the opening ceremony. Peter Brockhoff withdrew from the downhill event, saying \"I simply cannot compete on this course where I lost my best friend\". Australian reserve Peter Wenzel competed in the downhill along with Simon Brown.\nInvestigation into Ross's death.\nAn inquiry held by the organising committee said that Ross \"caught an edge\". Hugh Weir reported to the Australian Olympic Federation that\nDr Blaxland said that he was wrong about his age (he was nineteen), and that the IOC was wrong to suggest he was inexperienced:\nManager John Wagner said that Milne had found the path 150 metres ahead of him obscured by contestants congregating because the top part of the downhill course was overcrowded, and tried to slow down \"on a spot which was not prepared for stopping or swinging\". He argued that the accident might have been prevented by stricter management of the downhill course, which had a hundred racers on it. He also said that \"any of the top skiers would probably have been in difficulty in a similar situation\".\nHis brother Malcolm Milne competed in the 1968 and 1972 Winter Olympics. He said that the suggestion that skiers from Australia and New Zealand should not compete on downhill courses gave him motivation to prove that they were capable of doing so.\nAlpine skiing.\nPeter Brockhoff withdrew from the downhill event, but Simon Brown and Peter Wenzel competed in the event, with John Wagner saying \"They wanted to prove Australians can handle the difficult downhill course\"."

Hailing from Aigburth, Merseyside, England, Hemmings became known for his commentary partnership with Mike Stephenson from 1988 to 2017. He is widely recognised as \"the voice of rugby league\" after a career spanning over 30 years in the sport.\nHe and Andrew Voss are the two commentators for the video game \"Rugby League Live 4\". \nHemmings is a supporter of St Helens RFC.\nEarly career.\nHemmings began his career on the now defunct Liverpool Weekly News, before moving to BBC Radio Merseyside, where he became sports editor, proceeding to become a sports reporter/commentator on BBC Radio 2 in the 1980s. Hemmings and Stephenson actually first met up for commentary duties at the station; Stephenson was invited to be Hemmings' summariser during Great Britain's tour of Australia in 1988.\nTelevision career.\nHemmings joined satellite broadcaster BSB as the anchorman/commentator for its rugby league coverage at the network's launch in 1990. Stephenson was brought in to be Hemmings' regular sidekick. The pairing were kept together when BSB and Sky Television merged to form BSkyB; the combined satellite TV network inherited BSB's rugby league TV contract. Before this he was a Sports Reporter on the BBC regional news programme North West Tonight and was a presenter/co-presenter on the Saturday Teatime sports round-up Sport North West where he co-presented with Richard Duckenfield, Paul Craven, Andy Wyatt and sometimes presented on his own and the Friday Night BBC2 regional sports programme Sportsround and on network BBC an occasional reporter on Grandstand and Sportsnight \nHemmings was the main caller for nearly all live Super League matches broadcast on Sky Sports; the two matches broadcast live each week, plus all the play-offs and Grand Final matches. \nOn 1 March 2019, Hemmings announced his retirement from commentary and on 19 April 2019, he commentated on Wigan vs St Helens, his final Super League game for Sky Sports before retiring.\nInfluence.\nOn 13 February 2009, commentating on a St. Helens and Warrington match, Hemmings called for the names and numbers on the back of the Warrington away jersey to be changed as he found it hard to read. Warrington recognised this and two weeks later, in a match between Wakefield Trinity Wildcats and Warrington, Warrington altered their away jersey through having a white background behind the numbers."

        "text": "The Wanderer is a 14-foot (4.3 metres = 14.1 feet) Fibreglass hull Bermuda rigged sailing dinghy designed by Ian Proctor. One of the main objectives of the design was to produce a robust safe and versatile dinghy that could be used for knockabout day sailing and cruising as well as racing, but was light enough to be handled ashore.\nOn the water the boat can be recognised by its Sail logo of a white W in a blue circular background. Over 1600 boats have been produced. It should not be confused with its larger cousin, the Wayfarer (dinghy), which also sports a \"W\".\nDesign.\nThe initial design brief was given to Ian Proctor by Margaret Dye who wanted a lighter dinghy than the \"Wayfarer\" that she had sailed with her husband Frank. Margaret and the late Frank Dye had a wealth of dinghy cruising experience, and their adventures have been captured in Margaret's book \"Dinghy Cruising – The Enjoyment of Wandering Afloat\". .\nThe \"Wanderer\" has Main and Jib sails; it can also be fitted with a Spinnaker. Reefing of the main sail is by slab reefing. The jib can be fitted with a roller furling system. The boat is by design an aft main boat rather than a center main boat, although often converted to center main. It has high intrinsic stability, and the normal wooden centreplate can be replaced with an steel centre board which makes it even harder to capsize. The relatively light weight of the boat contributes to its ease of launching and recovery. The design allows for fitting of a long shafted outboard motor of up to 3.3 hp. There is very ample storage and on Pre-Hartley built hulls an in built waterproof locker, or \"Wanderbox\", for storage of the outboard motor when not in use.\nThe \"Wanderer\" dinghy design and construction has evolved during the years of manufacture, one of the most significant early changes was the introduction of the MD modification. This was a modification to the distribution of buoyancy resulting in a reduction in the floating height of the boat after a capsize thus aiding recovery (and propitiously making the boat less likely to turn turtle).\nIn 2006 Hartley Laminates took over the copyright and manufacturing licence for the design. They secured the services of Phil Morrison to redesign the deck plug to modernise the appearance of the boat, allow the hull to self drain through transom flaps and to reduce the complexity of building the hull and thus production costs while retaining the same hull shape and rig.\nClass Association.\nThe \"Wanderer\" has an active class owners' association (WCOA) which is based in the UK and is responsible for maintaining the class rules . The WCOA organises racing and cruising events all over the United Kingdom including an annual Festival; \"WandererFest\", which has been held at Cobnor near Chidham_and_Hambrook for the last 10 years. \nThe association website hosts all the details of the class rules, constitution, boat history, technical details and events. \nThe association also publishes a magazine three times a year of news of the Owners' Association."

        "text": "The International Cricket Council (ICC) was founded at Lord's on 15 June 1909 as the Imperial Cricket Conference, with Australia, England, and South Africa as its founding members.\nIn the beginning, only countries within the Commonwealth could join. India, New Zealand and the West Indies joined in 1926, and Pakistan joined in 1953 after the partition of India. In 1961, South Africa resigned from the Conference due to their leaving the Commonwealth, but they continued to play Test cricket until their international exile in 1970.\nThe Imperial Cricket Conference was renamed the International Cricket Conference in 1965, with new rules permitting countries from outside the Commonwealth to be elected into the governing body for the first time: Fiji and the USA became the first associate member nations that year.\nIn 1981, Sri Lanka became the first associate member to be elected a full member, returning the number of Test-playing nations to seven. In 1989, the ICC was again renamed, this time to the International Cricket Council. South Africa was re-elected as a full member of the ICC in 1991, with Zimbabwe elected in 1992, and Bangladesh elected in 2000.\nOn 22 June 2017, Ireland and Afghanistan were granted full member (and Test) status, bringing the number of full members to 12.\nAs of November 2023, there are 108 ICC members, with 12 full members and 96 associate members. \nThe membership committee will consider all future requests for membership – full and associate – against an objective set of criteria. There was previously a third level, affiliate membership, which was abolished in June 2017, with all existing affiliate members becoming associate members, and introducing a two-tier hierarchy (full members and associate members): any new member elected to the ICC would be an associate member, with the possibility of promotion to full member status based on ongoing performance in international competition.\nFrom July to October 2019, the ICC suspended Zimbabwe Cricket due to government interference, the first time this had occurred with a full member side. From November 2023 to January 2024, the ICC suspended Sri Lanka Cricket due to government interference in the board. \nFull members.\nFull members are the governing bodies for cricket in a country or a group of associated countries representing a geographical area.\nAll full members have a right to send a representative team to play official Test matches, have full voting rights at meetings of the ICC, and are automatically qualified to play ODIs and T20Is. The West Indies cricket team is a combined team representing 15 countries and territories from the Caribbean, while the English cricket team represents both England and Wales and the Irish cricket team represents all of the island of Ireland.\nOf these 12 nations, Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Ireland played as associate members before being elected as full members.\nIn April 2021, ICC granted permanent Women's Test status to all the full member nations.\nAssociate members.\nAssociate members are countries where cricket is firmly established and organised, but do not qualify for full membership. There are 96 associate members.\nAll associates were eligible to play in the World Cricket League, a series of international one-day cricket administered by the ICC until 2019. This was replaced by the ICC Cricket World Cup League 2 and ICC Cricket World Cup Challenge League from 2019 onwards. There are also ICC Men's T20 World Cup Qualifier events that works as a qualification process for ICC Men's T20 World Cup: until April 2018, only the qualified teams were awarded Twenty20 International status.\nIn April 2018, the ICC announced T20I status for all its members from 1 July 2018 for the women's game, and from 1 January 2019 for the men's game.\n\"Denotes members that are currently suspended by the ICC.\"\nAssociate members with ODI status.\nThe ICC granted men's One Day International status to its associate members based on their success in the World Cricket League; the World Cricket League was replaced in 2019 and ODI status now goes exclusively to all teams in the newly created ICC Cricket World Cup Super League and ICC Cricket World Cup League 2.\nThe Associate teams who currently hold men's ODI status are:\nNetherlands ensured they would regain ODI status after the completion of the 2018 World Cup Qualifier, by winning the 2015–2017 World Cricket League. The next three highest placed associates in the qualifier (UAE, Scotland and Nepal) also gained ODI status. In June 2018, Scotland and UAE were added to the main ODI rankings list, with Nepal joining them in January 2019. Netherlands were also added afterwards after playing enough games to gain a ranking.\nFour additional teams gained ODI status after the conclusion of the World Cricket League Division Two tournament in April 2019. These teams were Namibia, Oman, Papua New Guinea and USA.\nIn April 2021, ICC granted permanent Women's One Day International status to all the full-member teams. On 25 May 2022, five Associate teams were granted Women's ODI status by the International Cricket Council.\nAssociate members with T20I status.\nIn April 2018, the ICC announced T20I status for all members from 1 January 2019. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between ICC members since 1 January 2019 have been eligible for full T20I status.\nFormer members.\nExpelled members.\nThere are six countries who were associate and/or affiliate members of the International Cricket Council, but were expelled from the ICC:\nDissolved members.\nThere were two combined teams who were associate members of the International Cricket Council, but were subsequently dissolved.\nRegional bodies.\nRegional bodies aim to organise, promote and develop the game of cricket in their respective ICC regions.\nThese are the current bodies:\nThe regional body for Europe was disestablished following which ICC took over operations:\nTwo further regional bodies were dissolved following the creation of the African Cricket Association:"
