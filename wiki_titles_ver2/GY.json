He won two national championships with Boston University before embarking on a professional career in various German leagues.\nCareer.\nFlynn debuted as a varsity player on Boston University in the fall of 1970. While he was a depth player and only provided 3 assists in his first season, he had arrived just in time to be part of the Terriers' first national championship team. While he tripled his point total in year two, Flynn remained a role player for the team as it won the NCAA championship once more.\nHe left BU after the two titles and signed a professional contract with the Port Huron Wings. His scoring remained modest but he proved to be a solid defensive player, enabling him to continue his career the following year with the Dayton Gems. Flynn saw a significant jump in his offensive production with the Gems but he had few opportunities to move up in the North American leagues so he traveled across the Atlantic in 1974.\nSG Nürnberg was Flynn's first stop and he immediately became a star play for the team. He averaged more than a goal per game and performed so well that he earned a contract with EV Füssen of the top German league. His stay there was brief as Flynn signed up to play with RSC Bremerhaven. He helped the club earn a promotion to the 2nd Bundesliga in 1978 and remained with the club until 1981. He spent his final two years between three teams before retiring as a player in 1983."

He played college football for the Ole Miss Rebels and has also been a member of the Cincinnati Bengals.\nEarly life.\nBrown was born on May 19, 1998. He attended St. Aloysius High School in Vicksburg, Mississippi, where he played offensive tackle and defensive tackle and earned first-team all-state honors, as well as second-team All-American honors, as a senior while compiling 37 tackles and a sack and helping St. Aloysius gain 2,596 rushing yards with an average 7.2 yards-per-carry. \nRanked a three-star recruit, Brown committed to play college football for the Ole Miss Rebels and became the seventh member of his family to do so, following in the steps of his father Tim (offensive guard, 1988–1989), maternal grandfather Bobby Robinson (left guard, 1962–1964), paternal grandfather Allen (end, 1962–1964), uncle Burkes (offensive tackle, 1991–1992), great uncle Jerry (tackle, 1959–1961), and father's cousin Alton (defensive tackle, 1971–1972).\nCollege career.\nAs a true freshman at Ole Miss in 2017, Brown redshirted. The following year, he became a starter at right guard and started every game, not allowing any sacks on 446 pass plays while earning Southeastern Conference (SEC) All-Freshman honors while being one of three freshmen nationally to start every game at his position. In 2019, Brown started all 12 games, allowing only one sack, while playing a total of 765 snaps at offensive guard and 99 at center.\nBrown transitioned to being a center full-time in 2020 and started all 10 games, being named to the watchlist for the Rimington Trophy as best center nationally. He continued starting as a senior in 2021, but ended up missing the final half of the year after tearing his biceps in the final minutes of Ole Miss' game against Tennessee. He finished his collegiate career having started 40 consecutive games.\nProfessional career.\nCincinnati Bengals.\nBrown had been commonly projected to be a fifth-to-sixth round pick in the 2022 NFL Draft prior to his injury, but afterwards went unselected. He signed with the Cincinnati Bengals as an undrafted free agent. He injured his biceps in the first preseason game and was placed on injured reserve, ending his first season. The following season, he was released at the final roster cuts on August 29, 2023.\nSeattle Seahawks.\nTwo days after being released by Cincinnati, Brown was signed to the practice squad of the Seattle Seahawks. He was signed to the active roster on September 4. He was waived on October 21, 2023 and re-signed to the practice squad. He was released on November 26.\nArizona Cardinals.\nOn January 1, 2024, Brown was signed to the Arizona Cardinals practice squad. He was not signed to a reserve/future contract after the season, and thus became a free agent upon the expiration of his practice squad contract.\nLas Vegas Raiders.\nOn January 16, 2024, Brown signed a reserve/future contract with the Las Vegas Raiders."

        "title": "Ice hockey in Nebraska",
        "text": "Nebraska had more failures than success in ice hockey for much of its history. However, since the 1990s the sport has seen a massive amount of growth in the cornhusker state.\nHistory.\nAll efforts to start ice hockey in Nebraska were focused in and around Omaha for most of the 20th century. The first real attempt was towards the end of the depression when the Omaha Knights began play as members of the AHA. The Knights were able to play only three seasons before the league ceased operations due to World War II but they did return after the war. When they restarted play in 1945, the Knights sported a then-unknown player by the name of Gordie Howe who would go on to have one of the most storied careers in the history of ice hockey. Omaha would be one of the league's top teams (now renamed the USHL) winning three regular season titles before finally capturing the postseason crown in 1951. Unfortunately, that was the final season for the league and the Knights were disbanded along with the rest of their contemporaries. At the same time the University of Nebraska Omaha had attempted to field a program after World War II but those efforts never surpassed the club level.\nAfter spending most of the 50s without a team, ice hockey returned to Nebraska in the form of a new Omaha Knights franchise. This club played its first season in 1959 and were member of the IHL, a AA-league at the time. The Knights only lasted 4 years before moving eastwards for greener pastures. Not willing to give up on the market so easily, a third Knights franchise was founded the very next season and played in the brand new CPHL. This time the team lasted just two seasons before moving away. After a year without a team, a fourth attempt was made with the Omaha Knights when the Minnesota Rangers relocated in 1966. This iteration of the Knights found much greater success, winning three league championships in 9 seasons. Unfortunately, the team's on-ice success wasn't able to translate into financial security and the Knights withdrew from the league in 1975.\nNebraska was left without any established team for over a decade until the mid-1980s when the state received its first established junior team; the Omaha Lancers. Because the franchise was at the junior level and the players could not be paid a salary if they wanted to retain their college eligibility (the primary reason for the league was to funnel players into the college ranks), the Lancers had a much lower operating budget than the earlier professional teams and were able to establish a foothold in the region more easily. it took the team just 4 years to win their first championship and they reeled off three more titles before the franchise was a decade old. Building upon the triumphs of the Lancers, a second expansion team was added in 1996 when the Lincoln Stars began play. This new franchise wasted no time and won the league title in their inaugural season. A third junior team was added in 2000 when the Twin Cities Vulcans moved to Kearney and became the Tri-City Storm. As of 2023, all three continue to call Nebraska home and each has won the league championship.\nWhile the junior level was flourishing, Nebraska–Omaha was finally able to follow through on their plans to establish a varsity ice hockey program. The team began play in 1997, using the Omaha Civic Auditorium as its first home. Within 2 years they were able to secure a place in the CCHA, vital for the long-term success of a program, and made a surprise run to the league championship in their first season. However, the team was not able to build on that early success and have only once made the conference semifinals since (as of 2023). Despite those shortcoming, the team was able to establish itself in the community. After moving to the CenturyLink Center Omaha in 2003, the school built the first on-campus home in 2015 and the Mavericks continue to play in the Baxter Arena, one of the larger venues in college hockey at a capacity of 7,898.\nWith the popularity of the sport expanding, pro hockey attempted another revival in the early 21st century when the Calgary Flames moved their dormant AHL franchise to Omaha. The Omaha Ak-Sar-Ben Knights began play in 2005 and won a division title in just their second season. However, both years saw poor attendance figures and the fifth team to possess the 'Knights' moniker picked up stakes after just two seasons.\nTeams.\nTimeline.\n \nPlayers.\nThough Nebraska has had a passing relationship with ice hockey until late, the state has been able to produce a few notable players."

Each team will play the six nations in their opposing conference across the July and November Test windows, with a grand final to be played at the end of the November window between the first-placed teams in each conference in order to decide the tournament champion.\nA second division (Challenger Series), run by World Rugby, will take place concurrently and is due to consist of 12 further teams, with promotion and relegation between the divisions commencing from the start of the third edition in 2030.\nThe creation of the Nations Championship has received criticism for 'ring-fencing' smaller nations outside elite competition and narrowing their opportunities to play against top nations. It has also been criticised for potentially devaluing the Rugby World Cup. World Rugby's Chief Executive Alan Gilpin has defended against this criticism by stating “the suggestions that this just makes the rich richer are misplaced. This creates a better landscape” whilst adding that there will be “50% guaranteed more crossover fixtures” in non-tournament years."

        "text": "Katherine Gordon Harrison (born 1934) is an American former college tennis coach who was the head coach of the North Carolina Tar Heels women's tennis team from 1976 to 1998. She attended the University of Texas at Austin at a time when the school did not field a women's team. She studied classics as a postgraduate at Texas and North Carolina before becoming a professional tennis instructor. She was the all-time winningest Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) women's tennis coach at the time of her retirement.\nEarly life and education.\nHarrison grew up in Austin, Texas. Her father, Dr. Thomas P. Harrison, went to college at the University of North Carolina. She took up tennis at age seven or eight and received instruction from University of Texas classics professor and longtime men's tennis coach D.A. Penick. She played high school tennis for Austin High School and competed in local and state junior tournaments. After a year of attending Sweet Briar College in Virginia, she transferred to the University of Texas, where she joined groups such as Kappa Kappa Gamma, the Mortar Board, the Orange Jackets, and Phi Beta Kappa. There was no intercollegiate women's tennis program at Texas at the time, so she played on a club team. She majored in history and philosophy, graduating with honors in 1956.\nAfter college, Harrison worked as a secretary in cities across the country. She eventually returned to the University of Texas to earn a master's degree in classics. In 1970, she enrolled in a classics PhD program at the University of North Carolina, but she left in the summer of 1974 after seeing how few teaching positions were open in the field. She became certified as a tennis instructor after training at Dennis Van der Meer's tennis academy in Hilton Head, South Carolina, and began working as an assistant instructor at the Hollow Rock Racquet &amp; Swim Club in Durham, North Carolina.\nCoaching career.\nHarrison began coaching the women's tennis program at the University of North Carolina in 1976–77, succeeding longtime coach Frances Hogan. This was initially a part-time job, and she continued to work at the tennis club in Durham, until she was hired full time for the 1979–80 season. Under Harrison, North Carolina won the first four ACC Championships, from 1977 to 1980, and finished runner-up four other times. Eight times, they finished the season ranked within the top 25 nationally, and she had only four losing seasons. Notable players for Harrison include Kathy Barton; Cinda Gurney, the 1993 NCAA Women's Singles Championships runner-up; and Alisha Portnoy. She retired after the 1997–98 season, succeeded by Kansas coach Roland Thornqvist. Sportswriter Mary Garber described her as \"quiet and soft-spoken, but with a passion for tennis\".\nLegacy.\nAt the time of her retirement, Harrison was the winningest women's tennis coach in ACC history by dual match wins (with a record of about 360 wins, 225 losses). This record was eventually broken by fellow North Carolina coach Brian Kalbas in 2017. She was inducted into the North Carolina Tennis Hall of Fame in 2004.\nThe Kitty Harrison Invitational is an annual preseason women's college tournament held at the University of North Carolina since 2004. Also named after Harrison is the North Carolina women's tennis team's most valuable player award."

The first competition was played by three teams, Vichy, Roanne and Beauvais, as part of a French Téléthon. Meetings establishing the official rules of the sport took place in 2002 and in the same year a Trophy of France tournament took place in Vichy with six teams taking part. The sport spread to the south of France with the establishment of teams from Perpignan, Cahors, and Montauban in 2004, and the inclusion of the wheelchair rugby league in a national development program that provided equipment to numerous regional sports centres. The French competition was the world's first thought it is unknown at what point the league became the Elite One Championship, named after the highest tier of the French running game. In the 2006–07 season, the three-team Championship was won by Vichy. In the 2011–12 season, six teams competed in the Championship and six more took part in development tournaments. The following season there were four teams in the Elite 1 competition and six in Elite 2. In the 2013–14 season this was restructured as a single Championship of ten teams, but the growth of the sport meant that the following season there were 15 teams divided between Elite 1 and 2 as well as several reserve teams. For the 2023–24 season, it was announced that Elite 1 would have six teams below which would be the Elite 2 and National divisions.\nFormat.\nThe competition runs as a double round robin finishing with playoffs and a grand final.\nTeams.\nAs of 2023–24 the six teams are:"

In June 2022, a new Sports Pavilion was opened on the site.The facility includes changing rooms for players and match officials, a communal area and toilets. The facility was heavily influenced by the club Chairperson, Phil Abbott, who raised in excess of £125,000 of funds for the project. \nThe record, capacity crowd of 500 was achieved in May 2023 when the club hosted the Midlands Rugby League Junior Festival.\nHistory and notable firsts.\nThe club was founded in 2018 by Phil Abbott, a long-time servant of the community game, having previously co-founded Brentwood RLFC in Essex in 2004.\nBassetlaw Bulldogs RLFC has provided a number of firsts in the game of rugby league. In June 2018, alongside fellow Midlands Rugby League members, Immingham Wasps, the club played the first ever Player Development League fixture in England as part of the Rugby Football League's sport expansion plan.\nFurthermore, the Bulldogs club is the only Nottinghamshire-based team who are affiliated with professional Rugby League team Wakefield Trinity, with whom they hold Ambassador Club status.\nIn 2023, a further notable first came in the shape of the inception of an U13s girls team, who became the only Nottinghamshire-based girls team to play in a formal national league, administrated by the Rugby Football League. On 1 July 2023, the team became the first from outside the traditional rugby league heartlands to win a game in the National League (East Division B) when they beat Batley Girls by 32-30.\nIn November 2023, the club was named Midlands Junior League Club of the Year in the inaugural awards. The Girls U13s team also became the first ever recipients of the Team of the Year award, made by the Rugby Football League. This particular award was presented by Jodie Cunningham, captain of both the England women's national rugby league team and St Helens RFC Women's Rugby League team.\nThe season closed with the first games of the recently formed Masters Rugby League side, for players over the age of 35 years old. Games against Doncaster Toll Bar and Rebel Masters saw the Bulldogs become Nottinghamshire's one and only Masters team.\nClub Development.\nSince its establishment in 2018, the club has grown at a strong rate. This growth was stunted by the Covid-19 pandemic, which brought disruption to all sport through lockdowns and restrictions, however this did not stop the club pushing forward with its activity when allowed.\nIn August 2023, the club introduced its 8th different team, with the inception of an over-35s Masters Rugby League team.\nRoll of honour.\nMidlands Junior League Team of the Year (U13s girls) 2023\nMidlands Junior League Club of the Year 2023"

        "title": "India national football team at the Asian Games",
        "text": "The Asian Games is Asia's multi-sport event, normally held every four years. The games are regulated by the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) and recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Football was first introduced as a sport at the inaugural edition of the Asian Games, which was held in India in 1951. The India national team hosted five other national teams, winning the competition to become the first Asian football champions; the AFC Asian Cup began in 1956, two years after the formation of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC). India competed in eleven Asian Games between 1951 and 1998, missing the 1990 and 1994 games. The team won a gold medal at the 1962 Games and a bronze in 1970. For the 2002 Busan Asian Games, the rules were changed so that only under-23 national teams were allowed to compete. India's U-23 national team has not yet won a medal at the Asian Games.\nBackground.\nThe Asian Games is Asia's continental multi-sport event, held every four years. The Asian Games Federation (AGF) organizing the games from the first edition in New Delhi until 1978. After the breakup of the AGF, the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) has organized the games since 1982. The games, recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), are described as the world's second-largest multi-sport event (after the Olympic Games). The 1951 Asian Games are considered the successor of the Far Eastern Games and the Western Asiatic Games. The Far Eastern Games were held nine times between 1913 and 1938 in Japan, the Philippines, and mainland China. The 1938 games in Osaka were cancelled due to the Second Sino-Japanese War (which became part of World War II), and the Far Eastern Games were then discontinued. During the early 1930s, efforts were made to organize a multi-sport event to include the countries of West Asia. This gave birth to the Orient Championship Games, which was renamed the Western Asiatic Games before its first inception. The games' geographic scope included the countries east of Suez and west of Singapore. The first edition was held in Delhi in 1934 at the Irwin Amphitheater, and four countries—Afghanistan, British India, Palestine Mandate, and Ceylon—participated. The decision was made to hold these games every four years, at the midpoint between the Summer Olympics. The 1938 Western Asiatic Games, scheduled to be held in Tel Aviv, were cancelled and abandoned with the outbreak of World War II. Football was one of eight sports played at the inaugural edition of the Asiad in New Delhi, and has been part of every edition since.\nGolden era.\n1951: Host and champion.\nDraws and rules.\nGuru Dutt Sondhi, chair of the executive committee for the first Asiad, hosted a New Delhi conference on February 25, 1951, where the draw for the 1951 Asian Games was held. At the conference, it was announced that Afghanistan, Burma, India, Indonesia, Iran and Japan would participate in the tournament. Matches would be played in two 30-minute halves with a five-minute interval, and 15 minutes of extra time with a one-minute interval when a result is not produced within regulation time. Japan and Afghanistan received byes to the quarterfinals. The winner of the Iran-Burma match would play Japan, and the winner of the India-Indonesia match would play Afghanistan. The Philippines withdrew from the tournament before the draw. All matches were played at National Stadium in New Delhi.\nFirst Asia champion.\nIndia played barefoot on a pitch that measured , slightly narrower than international standards. However, FIFA had granted prior approval for the use of the pitch. On 5 March 1951, India made its Asian Games football debut against Indonesia with Sailen Manna as captain and Syed Abdul Rahim as coach. India's off season lacked match practice, and their passing and understanding were poor in the opening quarter. Indian forwards Sheoo Mewalal and Pansanttom Venkatesh pressured the Indonesian defense from the start, however, with good passes by center–half Chandan Singh Rawat. The score remained goalless until the 27th minute when Singh passed to Venkatesh, who sent the ball into the six-yard box towards Mewalal. Mewalal headed the ball past the goalkeeper to give India the lead, the first Indian goal-scorer at the Asian Games. India settled down in the second half; in the 42nd minute a corner kick by Mewalal was deflected off Indonesian right–back Chairuddin Siregar into the net, giving India a 2–0 lead. Three minutes later, Indian outside–left Puthanparambil Saleh ran down the wing; his shot rebounded off the bar. Mewalal tapped the ball to Venkatesh, who scored his first goal to give India a 3–0 victory and a place in the semi-finals.\nRahim made three changes to his team for the semi-final match against Afghanistan on 7 March. Kenchappa Varadaraj replaced Berland Anthony in goal, T. Shanmugham replaced Muhammad Noor in midfield, and Santosh Nandy replaced Saleh at left wing. Afghanistan had a physical, rough playing style; two players were sent off the field, and two more were cautioned by the referee. India forwards Mewalal and Venkatesh continued to impress with their runs, passing, ball control, and shooting, resulting in another 3–0 victory before about 15,000 spectators.\nThe first goal came in the 10th minute when Mewalal passed to Venkatesh, who shot from outside the penalty box. They reversed roles for the second goal, with Venkatesh setting up Mewalal for a shot to the far corner of the net in the 16th minute. India continued to dominate in the second half, but several shots hit the crossbar. The third goal for India followed a goalmouth melee, with Nandy scoring to send India to the final.\nIndia played in a 2–3–5 formation throughout the tournament. In the final against Iran on 10 March, goalkeeper Anthony was brought back into the starting lineup. The match was dull and scrappy from the start, with the barefooted Indian players reluctant to tackle the booted Iranians. The 25,000 spectators were disappointed with India's first-half performance. The defense of captain Manna, T. Papen and goalkeeper Anthony, however, was praised for saving three goal-scoring chances. Rawat was clinical in his tackling and clearances, and his consistent passes to the forward line were valuable. Inside-right Guha Thakurta and Mewalal kept the Iranian defense busy in the first half. India scored in the 34th minute; Thakurta sent in a cross from the right wing, which Mewalal trapped and volleyed into the net. India defeated Iran in the final for their first-ever Asian Games gold medal and Asia championship. Mewalal was the tournament's highest goalscorer.\n1954: Early exit.\nThe 1954 Asian Games were held in Manila in May. On 1 May, the draws for the tournament were announced. Twelve teams participated, seven for the first time. India was drawn in Group C with Indonesia and Japan. The winners of each three-team group would advance to the semifinals; the winners of the semifinals would play for the gold medal, and the losers of the semifinals would play for the bronze medal. Match length was increased to 80 minutes, with two 40-minute halves. India were the defending champions. Memory of the squad's worst defeat (1–10 against Yugoslavia at the 1952 Olympics) was still fresh, although they had won the 1953 Colombo Cup a few months earlier. The team was led by Manna and managed by Balaidas Chatterjee.\nIndia won the first group match against Japan, 3–2. Centre-forward Syed Moinuddin scored two goals, and right-out Joe D'Sa scored one. Japan's two goals were scored by right–in Takashi Takabayashi and centre-forward Taizo Kawamoto. On 3 May, however, India was defeated in the next (and final) group match by Indonesia 0–4. Indonesia forwards Djamiat Dhalhar and Andi Ramang scored a brace, giving India an early exit from the tournament.\n1958: Misfortune.\nIndia bounced back at the 1958 Asian Games under coach T. Shome. Fourteen teams participated, with Israel and Malaya making their debut. The matches had two 45-minute halves, with an additional 30 minutes if tied in a knockout game. India was drawn in Group B with Burma and Indonesia, and the top two teams advanced to the knockout stage. They began the group stage with a 3–2 win against Burma, with Chuni Goswami, Tulsidas Balaram and D. Damodaran scoring. In the second match, Indonesia repeated their 1954 Asiad victory with a 2–1 win; Thio Him Tjiang scored twice for Indonesia, and Mohammed Rahmatullah scored for India. India defeated Hong Kong 5–2 in the quarterfinals, with Rahmatullah scoring twice and Goswami, Balaram, and Damodaran scoring once. This gave India a medal chance, since Hong Kong was the third-seeded team in the tournament.\nIndia lost to South Korea 1–3 in the semifinals, unable to overcome tired legs from the previous matches. The players lacked coordination, and strikers could not convert passes from the wingers. Few chances were created by India, and the Korean defense (including goalkeeper Ham Heung-chul) was well-organized. Rahmatullah scored India's only goal in the first half, and Choi Chung-min, Lee Soo-nam and Moon Jung-sik scored for South Korea in the second half. India faced Indonesia again in the bronze-medal match, losing 4–1 before 45,000 spectators. Although India attacked well in the first half, their execution failed. Indonesia scored their first goal in the 10th minute with a corner kick by Saari, who curled the ball into the net; Balaram equalized for India in the first minute of the second half from a penalty kick. However, Omo Suratmo and Wowo Sunaryo scored two goals in the 59th and 60th minutes for Indonesia. Phwa Sian Liong finished off a solo run to score Indonesia's fourth (and final) goal in the 88th minute.\n1962: The Golden Trio.\nOverview and draws.\nThe Ministry of Finance nearly pruned the football team from the Indian contingent for the 1962 Asian Games as an austerity measure. After several rounds of talks with the Indian Olympic Association (IOA), however, the ministry approved the team's participation.\nThe initial draw was conducted on 14 August 1962. Eleven teams were drawn in four groups, including defending champion Republic of China. Indonesia, the host country, denied visas to the delegations from Israel and the Republic of China for political and diplomatic reasons; this led the International Amateur Athletic Federation and the International Weightlifting Federation to withdraw their sanction for the games.\nIndian sports administrator Guru Dutt Sondhi, vice-president of the Asian Games Federation (AGF) and the IOC observer at the 1962 games, said that they should not be called the \"Fourth Asian Games\" to safeguard the competition's status. This was misinterpreted by the game organizers, the Indonesian press and government and the people, who became hostile towards the Indian contingent. A revised draw was held on 24 August 1962, with eight teams divided into two groups. India was in Group B with Thailand, Japan, and South Korea. The draw included provisions for the possible participation of Israel and the Republic of China.\nSecond gold: Indian football's greatest achievement.\nAfter Balaidas Chatterjee and T. Shome failed to give India a medal in the previous two outings, Syed Abdul Rahim was again given responsibility for the team in the 1962 Asiad. Since Rahim guided India to the first Asian Games gold medal and the semi–finals of the 1956 Olympics (India's best Olympics result to date), the team was expected to perform well. Rahim (who had cancer) had the best possible forward line of P. K. Banerjee, Chuni Goswami, Tulsidas Balaram, who became known as the \"golden trio of Indian football\". Rahim's squad also had the best defense line, which included Jarnail Singh, Arun Ghosh, Chandrashekar Menon and Tarlok Singh.\nHe used the 3–2–5 formation in the first match against South Korea, who had won the 1960 AFC Asian Cup. South Korea dominated the match, defeating India 2–0. In the early minutes, Indian forward Goswami failed to convert several chances when Balaram passed him the ball at the goalmouth. Korea impressed the 95,000 spectators with better ball control, tactics and quick passes. Forward Chung Soon-choon volleyed the ball from a corner kick in the 30th minute for their first goal. In the second half, Korean inside–out Cha Tae-sung beat Indian goalkeeper Pradyut Barman for his team's second goal. In the second match, against Thailand, India had better gameplay and won 4–1. Center–back Jarnail Singh was injured in a head collision, however; he was stretchered off, needed several stitches, and India was one man down.\nP. K. Banerjee scored a brace, and Chuni Goswami and Tulsidas Balaram scored one goal each; Thailand scored one goal. For the last group-stage match, India faced Japan. Although India won, their performance was less impressive than the previous match. During the first half, Japanese forward Saburō Kawabuchi and midfielder Shozo Tsugitani troubled defender Chandrasekhar Menon and goal-keeper Barman several times. India began attacking in the second half, but several chances were missed. Their first goal was in the 54th minute, when Ram Bahadur lobbed the ball in front of the goal to Banerjee, who put it in the net. Balaram scored India's second goal in the 71st minute, when confusion between Japanese goalkeeper Tsukasa Hosaka and his defenders placed the ball at Balaram's feet.\nIndia faced South Vietnam, who topped group A, in the semi–final on 1 September. Rahim used a 3–2–5 formation and made two changes; Prasanta Sinha replaced injured Ram Bahadur, and Jarnail Singh was brought in. Singh was positioned as center–forward instead of defender, which helped the team to win the match. India's golden trio began attacking from the start; their first goal was in the 13th minute, when inside-left Goswami scored from a pass from left winger Balaram. Balaram again created a chance in the 18th minute, but the ball hit the post. He continued his attack, dribbling the ball through the Vietnamese defense and taking a 20th-minute shot which went wide of the net. P. K. Banerjee took a 30th-minute free kick, which was saved by Vietnamese goalkeeper Pham Van Rang. The Indian forwards then increased their attacks, and a Banerjee header barely missed the net. India scored their second goal in the 41st minute, when defender-turned-striker Singh rushed through the defense and tapped the ball from three yards out. In the second half, Vietnam began attacking to even the score. Vietnam's first goal was in the 52nd minute, when left–back Phan Duong Cam scored from a penalty kick. Inside–right Do Thol Vinh shot several times before finding success in the 64th minute, when he flicked a ball into the net after a melee with the Indian defenders. Goswami scored the final goal of the match in the 75th minute, when his soft lob cleared goalkeeper Van Rang and sent India to the Asiad final for the second time.\nIn the final, on 4 September, India again faced South Korea. Rahim played a 2–3–5 formation with goalkeeper Peter Thangaraj. Thangaraj played an important role in the match, saving several shots from Koreans attacking from all directions. The crowd of 100,000 was generally hostile to India, booing throughout the match but cheering Thangaraj's saves. He was beaten in the 85th minute by Korean inside–right Cha Tae-sung for Korea's only goal. India had had a 2–0 lead, with both goals scored in the first half. The first was in the 17th minute, when team captain Goswami scored from a melee at the goalmouth. Jarnail Singh, who had been switched to forward from defense, had a bandaged head from a previous-match injury. He scored the second goal, lobbing the ball over Korean goalkeeper Ham Heung-chul. India won 2–1, for the team's second Asian Games gold medal. It is considered the greatest achievement of the Indian national team, which overcame participation uncertainties, a hostile host, injury, and the defending Asian champion South Korea.\n1966: Setback.\nAfter the 1962 victory, India did well in the Merdeka and was runner-up at the 1964 AFC Asian Cup. With Rahim's untimely death and the early retirement of Goswami and Balaram, however, they were not the 1966 Asiad favorites despite their status as defending champions. India was drawn in a difficult group with Iran, Japan and Malaysia, playing for coach Mohammed Hussain and captained by Jarnail Singh. They won one match, 2–1, against Malaysia. India lost to Japan and Iran by scores of 2–1 and 4–1, respectively, and did not move up to the knockout stage.\n1970: Swan song.\nFour years later, at the 1970 Bangkok Games, India won the bronze medal. It was the team's last hurrah before its performance declined for almost four decades. The team was coached by G. M. H. Basha and managed by 1962 gold medalist P. K. Banerjee; Syed Nayeemuddin was team captain. The games were originally scheduled to take place in Islamabad, Pakistan, but nine months before they began they were moved to Bangkok. The tournament was shortened to ten days, with India playing six matches in nine days. For the preliminary round, India was drawn with host Thailand and South Vietnam. With a 2–2 draw against Thailand and a 2–0 win against South Vietnam, India moved to the quarter–final round. The 10 December match against Thailand, before 50,000 spectators on a pich slippery from drizzle, was critical for India. The squad were two goals down by the 21st minute before forward Subhash Bhowmick scored a brace to equalize and barely missed a match-winning hat trick. In the second match, against South Vietnam the following day, Mohammed Habib and Magan Singh Rajvi scored one goal each.\nThe quarter–final was played in two groups. India was placed in group A with Indonesia and Japan. They dominated the first match 3–0 against Indonesia on 15 December, with Doraiswamy Nataraj, Rajvi and Shyam Thapa scoring a goal apiece. India lost the 17 December match against Japan when forward Takeo Kimura scored the lone Japanese goal in the 88th minute. With one win and one loss, India was runner–up in the group and moved on the semi–final against group B winners Burma the following day.\nBurma, the defending champions, were the favorites; as expected, their better skills, passing and attacking won the match against India. Burmese striker Ye Nyunt scored a brace for his team to reach the final, and India moved on to the 19 December bronze-medal match against Japan. Japan was the favorite, since they had defeated India in the group match. India won by a solitary goal, however, scored by Manjit Singh. The result was helped by India's defenders; right–back Sudhir Karmakar marked Japanese striker Kunishige Kamamoto so skillfully that FIFA president Stanley Rous called Karmakar \"Asia's best defender\" and India \"the most skillful team of the tournament\". This was the India senior national team's last medal at the Asian Games.\nDecline.\n1974: Worst outing.\nIndia's performance sharply declined after 1970, so much so that the senior national team never finished in the top four from the 1974 to the 1998 Asiads. The decline began with a bad outing at the 1971 Merdeka Tournament, where they were defeated 9–0 by Burma on 6 August 1971. This was followed by a poor performance at the 1972 Summer Olympics qualifications. They did not even take part in the 1972 AFC Asian Cup qualification. India was not among the favorites for the 1974 tournament, despite their 1970 bronze medal. Although coach Basha and manager Banerjee remained with the team with players Bhowmick, Habib, Thapa, Nataraj and Rajvi, their poor performance continued in 1974. India was drawn in Group B for the preliminary round with Iraq, China and North Korea. India lost all the three matches: 0–3 to Iraq, 1–7 to China and 1–4 to North Korea. The match against China was the team's worst defeat in the Asian Games; the 1974 games were the team's worst, with 14 goals conceded. Rajvi scored two goals, one each against China and North Korea.\n1978 to 1994.\nIn 1978, India was coached by Arun Ghosh and Gurdev Singh Gill was the team captain. India was drawn in Group A of the preliminary round with Malaysia and Bangladesh, losing 0–1 to Malaysia and defeating Bangladesh 3–0 victory. Bidesh Bose, Harjinder Singh and Xavier Pius scored one goal each. With one win and one loss, India moved to the next round and faced Kuwait, North Korea and Iraq. Kuwait defeated India 6–1, North Korea defeated India 3–1 and Iraq also won, preventing India from advancing. Surajit Sengupta scored the lone goal for India against Kuwait, and A. Devraj Doraiswamy scored their only goal against North Korea.\nIndia hosted the 1982 Asian Games in New Delhi. P. K. Banerjee was appointed coach, and Bhaskar Ganguly became team captain. Sixteen teams participated in the football tournament. India was drawn in Group C for the preliminary round with Bangladesh, China and Malaysia. They defeated Bangladesh 2–0, Malaysia 1–0, and drew 2–2 against China to move to the knockouts. Prasun Banerjee scored in the early and final minutes against Bangladesh, and Kartick Seth scored the lone goal against Malaysia in the 68th minute; Shabbir Ali and Seth scored in the 53rd and 60th minutes, respectively, against China. India faced Group A runner–up Saudi Arabia in the quarter–finals. Despite the home advantage, India was defeated; Ahmed Bayazid scored the winning goal in the 89th minute to reach the semi–finals.\nThe team's poor performance continued in 1986. India lost all its group matches (conceding eight goals) for the first time since 1974. South Korea won 3–0 on 20 September, China won 2–1 on 22 September, and Bahrain won 3–0 four days later. Debashish Mishra scored India's only goal, against China.\nOne reason for the downfall of the Indian football team was a rift between the All India Football Federation (AIFF) and the Calcutta clubs, players and coaches. Since India would host the 1982 Asian Games, the AIFF began preparations by giving international exposure (with longer camps) to the senior team near the end of 1980; this led to a dispute between the Calcutta Football League clubs and the AIFF, which did not realize that if the players remained with national team instead of representing the clubs, they would incur a financial loss. Most of the players from Bengal left the national camp and, although the matter was later resolved, preparations were hampered. Before the 1986 Asian Games, controversy arose about the selection of team captain. Coach P. K. Banerjee appointed defender Sudip Chatterjee captain, but midfielder Prasanta Banerjee said that he should have been given the position because of his seniority. Chatterjee remained captain; Banerjee claimed an injury and did not want to play, which divided the team. Manager P. P. Lakshmanan wrote a report critical of the Bengal players' attitude, and the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) withdrew the national team from the 1990 and 1994 games.\n1998: Last senior-team participation.\nAfter missing the 1990 and 1994 games, the senior national team took part in the Asian Games in 1998 for the last time. The IOA authorized the team if the government would not bear the expenses. Syed Nayeemuddin was the coach, and the team was managed by Chuni Goswami; I. M. Vijayan was the team captain. India began well in the preliminary round. In the first match, on 3 December against Japan, they lost by a solitary goal scored by Japanese forward Kenji Fukuda. In the second match, on 5 December, India earned three points from a win against Nepal and moved to the second round; Carlton Chapman scored India's only goal. India then lost all their second-round matches: a 3–2 loss to Turkmenistan, a 2–0 defeat by Uzbekistan, and a 2–0 loss to North Korea. Vijayan and Tushar Rakshit scored for India against Turkmenistan.\nUnder-23 team.\n2002: New rules.\nAs the turn of the century, the OCA changed the participation rules for the Asian Games. The age of the players was limited to 23, with three over-age players allowed on each squad; this was similar to the participation rules for the Summer Olympics. The 2002 Asian Games were held in Busan, South Korea, in September. The football tournament was the first in which under–23 teams participated. Similar to the 1998 games, the team was allowed to participate if the government did not have to pay. India was drawn in Group C with Bangladesh, Turkmenistan and China and defeated Bangladesh and Turkmenistan 3-0 and 3–1, respectively. Captain Bhaichung Bhutia played well, scoring two goals against each team. In the third match, on 3 October, India lost to China and finished as group runner-up. Despite earning six points from the two wins, the team did not move on to the knockouts due to a lower goal differential than other second-place teams.\n2006–present.\nThe Indian football team almost missed a place in the 2006 Guanzhou games because a criterion was adopted allowing squads for team sports only if they had a fourth–to–sixth-place finish in the previous edition. The team was allowed, however, under condition that the AIFF would pay its expenses. Bob Houghton was the coach, and Bhutia was the team captain. India was drawn with Hong Kong, the Maldives and defending champion Iran. India had a 1–1 draw against Hong Kong, a 2–1 victory against the Maldives, and a 2–0 defeat by Iran.\nFour years later, at the 2010 Doha games India again played poorly. The team was drawn in Group D with Kuwait, Qatar and Singapore. Kuwait defeated India 2–0, and Qatar won 2–1. Dharmaraj Ravanan scored India's only goal. In the third match, against Singapore, India won 4–1. Jewel Raja, Balwant Singh, Jibon Singh, and Manish Maithani each scored one goal. India reached the round of 16 as the best third-place team. In the knockouts, however (their first appearance since 1982), they lost 5–0 to Japan.\nThe Indian Sports Ministry was initially reluctant to send the team to the 2014 Asian Games, but later relented. India had their worst outing since the under-23 team competed, conceding seven goals in two matches against the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Jordan in Group H. In the first match, the UAE defeated India 5–0. Jordan defeated India 2–0 in the second match, preventing them from moving on to the round of 16.\nThe IOA did not allow the team to participate in the 2018 Asian Games, saying that they were incapable of winning a medal. The association did not allow the AIFF to pay the team's expenses. Four years later, a similar situation arose. The national football team almost missed a place at the Hangzhou Games, held in September 2023. The Sports Ministry allowed squads for team sports only if they were among Asia's top eight. The India senior national team was ranked 18th in Asia, but FIFA does not rank under–age national teams.\nIndian football fans began a campaign on social media, with hashtags supporting their cause. India team coach Igor Štimac reached out to the government of India for intervention with an open letter on social media. This led to a meeting of the AIFF and the ministry, which allowed the team to participate in light of their performances at the 2023 Tri-Nation Series, Intercontinental Cup and SAFF Championship. Although the team was allowed, the main under–23 squad was missing; 11 of 22 players originally named to the final squad withdrew because of their club's refusal to release them. The AIFF asked Football Sports Development Limited to postpone the 2023–24 Indian Super League so the players could participate and have a practice camp before the games; the company refused, and the team played without a single practice session.\nThe 19th Asian Games, scheduled for 10–25 September 2022 in Hangzhou, was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and was held from 23 September to 8 October 2022. However, the group stage of the football tournament began on 19 September. The draw for the Hangzhou Games was held on 27 July, and India was drawn in Group A with host China, Bangladesh and Myanmar.\nIn the group stage, India lost 5–1 to China. They won 1–0 against Bangladesh and drew 1–1 draw against Myanmar, earning four points to reach the knockouts. India ended their tournament with a 2–0 loss to Saudi Arabia in the round of 16.\nRecord.\nFrom its inception in 1951, the football tournament at the Asian Games was played by the senior teams until 1998. The IOC and AFC changed the rules of participation in 2002, and allowed under-23 players (and three players over age 23) on a squad.\nMatch summary.\nIndia has scored the most goals against Hong Kong in a 5–2 victory in the quarter-finals of the 1958 Asiad. The most goals the team conceded were in a 1–7 loss against China in the preliminary round of the 1974 Asiad. "

        "text": "The 2023–24 Bentley Falcons men's ice hockey season was the 47th season of play for the program, the 25th at the Division I level and the 21st in Atlantic Hockey. The Falcons represented Bentley University, played their home games at the Bentley Arena and were coached by Andy Jones in his 1st season.\nSeason.\nAfter More than 25 years with the program, Ryan Soderquist announced that he was stepping down as coach after the 2023 season. A few months later, the school hired Andy Jones as the program's 7th head coach.\nUnder their new coach, the Falcons had a solid season. The team lost most of their non-conference matches but several came against ranked teams, including an overtime contest with Boston University to kick off the season. The Falcons hovered around .500 for the entire season, and entered the postseason at exactly even. Bentley's 6th-place finish forced them to play in the conference First Round but game the team the best possible matchup.\nThe Falcons were set against Robert Morris, who were playing their first season after a two-year hiatus, and were expected to win the match. Unfortunately, the Falcons got into power play trouble and allowed RMU to take the lead on the strength of two man-advantage goals. Garrett Horsager came to the rescue in the third, scoring and then assisting on the game-tying goal to force sending the match into overtime. Neither team had much of an advantage in the extra session and, as the period progressed, the match seemed destined for a second overtime. With just 10 seconds left, Conner Hasley grabbed the puck behind his cage and tried to made a reverse-pass to Tucker Hodgson. The Colonial skater who was forechecking predicted the play, intercepted the pass, and wrapped the puck around the front before Hasley could get back into the net. The costly mistake ended the game and the season for the Falcons.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \nRankings.\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "text": "The 2023–24 RPI Engineers Men's ice hockey season was the 104th season of play for the program and the 62nd in ECAC Hockey. The Engineers represented Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, played their home games at Houston Field House and were coached by Dave Smith in his 6th season.\nSeason.\nFrom the very start of the season, Rensselaer encountered a problem that would plague them all year long. In their first four games, the defense surrendered a veritable avalanche of shots to the opposing teams. While their opposition at this time would all end up finishing the year ranked in the top 20, the porous defense persisted. Their three goaltenders, who weren't brilliant to begin with, suffered as a result. RPI allowed at least 4 goals in ten of their first twelve games and gave the team little chance to win from night to night. At one point, the team turned to Brett Miller, a senior who had seen very little playing time in his college career, as starter but that experiment lasted just a few games. It wasn't until after Christmas that the Watson was able to settle down and string together some decent performances.\nAfter winning four of five coming out of the winter break, Rensselaer miraculously found itself in the middle of the conference standings. The reprieve, however, was short-lived. The defense faltered and team won just twice in its final fourteen games. The Engineers stumbled to a last-place finish in ECAC Hockey and entered the postseason with no momentum or expectations. However, once the postseason began, RPI found itself with an opportunity. Rensselaer was pitted against its long-time rival, Clarkson, and they relished the chance to ruin the Golden Knights' season. The Engineers scored twice in the first period to take an early lead all the while letting Clarkson sleep-walk through the opening 40 minutes. After Sutter Muzzatti increased the team's lead in third, the Knights finally fought back and ended up firing 22 shots in the third period. They managed to get the puck past Watson twice but he held up over the final two minutes and carried the Engineers to victory.\nThe rather surprising upset caused RPI to be set against defending national champion Quinnipiac in the quarterfinals. The first match was entirely controlled by the Bobcats but RPI gave a good performance in the rematch. The match remained close throughout until Quinnipiac scored two-empty-net goals in the final 70 seconds.\nRensselaer finished the season with one of its worst defensive performances. RPI had allowed more than 4 goals against on average and were the second-worst defensive team that season. Only Stonehill, who was in the process of transitioning from Division II, was worse.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 ! style=\"\"; | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \nRankings.\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "text": "Rugby was a 1894 residential development of 60 acres straddling the border between what was then the western section of the Dorchester district of Boston and the eastern part of the town of Hyde Park, Massachusetts. Described by the developer Wood, Harmon &amp; Co. as a \"new Dorchester suburb, commands fine views of Blue Hills\", the area was purchased from the estate of Charles L. Flint and others. The area is now part of the Boston neighborhoods of Mattapan and Hyde Park.\nStreets.\nA unique alliterative feature of Rugby was that each street was designated a road and began with the letter \"R\". Many of these streets have since been renamed:\nRugby station.\nA major selling point of the development was its close proximity to the New York and New England Railroad with access to downtown Boston. The developers constructed a station for the development and promised to pay the 5¢ fare to Boston for the head of the household until 1900. A temporary platform was used in April 1894 during sales of lots in the development. Rugby station was built later in 1894. It had a small wooden station building on the north station of the tracks just east of Randolph Road (now Greenfield Road), with two side platforms.\nThe station building was closed after a mere three months, but trains continued to stop. The disused building was damaged several times by fires – both accidental and intentional – and was destroyed on April 24, 1908, by a fire caused by sparks from a passing locomotive. With the station building gone, only the platforms remained. Rugby was served by only a single train in one direction by 1915, and abandoned entirely by 1924. A pedestrian underpass was built between Greenfield Road and Rector Road (both formerly Randolph Road) at the former station site in 1932. Passenger service on the line ran until 1944 and resumed in 1979; it is now the Fairmount Line of the MBTA Commuter Rail system."

The Blue Devils were led by second year head coach Jon Scheyer. The Blue Devils played their home games at Cameron Indoor Stadium in Durham, North Carolina, as a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference.\nThe Blue Devils started the season ranked second in the nation and dominated Dartmouth in their season opener. The schedule became more difficult as they lost by four points to twelfth-ranked Arizona. They followed the loss with a defeat of eighteenth-ranked Michigan State in the Champions Classic. They went on to win three straight games before losing at Arkansas in the ACC–SEC Challenge. They were defeated by Georgia Tech by four-points in their ACC opener. After back-to-back defeats, the Blue Devils went on to win eight straight games. This included wins over tenth-ranked Baylor and a defeat over Georgia Tech to avenge the previous loss. The winning streak was broken with a four-point loss to Pittsburgh. They won their next three games before a rivalry matchup with North Carolina. North Carolina won by nine-points, but the Blue Devils would win their next five straight games. Duke lost two of its last five games, with one of the losses coming at in-state rival Wake Forest and the other being a final day loss to North Carolina.\nThe Blue Devils finished the season 27–9 and 15–5 in ACC play to finish in second place. As the second seed in the ACC tournament, they earned a bye to the Quarterfinals where they were upset by in-state rival and tenth-seed NC State. They received an at-large bid to the 2024 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament where they were the 4th seed in the South Region. They faced Vermont in the First Round. They won this matchup to move onto the round of 32, where they routed 12th seed James Madison. Duke then faced the number one seed, Houston, whom they defeated 54–51, advancing to the Elite Eight for the first time under head coach Jon Scheyer. There they were upset by 11th-seeded and ACC rival NC State to end their season.\nPrevious season.\nThe Blue Devils finished the 2022–23 season 27–9, 14–6 in ACC play to finish a three-way tie for third place. As the No. 4 seed in the ACC tournament, they defeated Pittsburgh, Miami, and Virginia to win the tournament championship. The championship was their 22nd ACC tournament victory in program history.

        "title": "Ice hockey in Oregon",
        "text": "Oregon was one of the first states in the union to have an established ice hockey team. The state continued to have a low but consistent level of engagement for many years afterwards.\nHistory.\nIn 1914, the New Westminster Royals relocated to Portland and renamed themselves the Rosebuds. The club was a member of the PCHA, the main competitor to the NHA and played at the highest level of the sport. In just its second season in Portland, the Rosebuds won the league championship and met the Montreal Canadiens for 1916 Stanley Cup Finals. Despite playing the entire series in Montreal, Portland pushed the series to a deciding 5th game and had a 1-goal lead before surrendering 2 goals and losing to the home team. Unfortunately, Portland wasn't able to build on that success folded just two years later.\nIn the mid 20s, a second relocation brought the Rosebuds back, this time as a member of the WHL (the successor to the PCHA). Portland finished 4th in the standings out of 6 teams, however, the league collapsed after the season when all three west coast teams dissolved. The player contracts from that team were sold for $100,000 and used as the basis for a new NHL expansion team, the Chicago Black Hawks.\nImmediately after the end of the Rosebuds, the Portland Buckaroos were founded and used the Rosebuds' old venue, the Portland Ice Arena. The team would play in several different minor leagues over the next 15 years but were finally killed off in the early years of World War II. Near the end of the war, professional hockey returned to Portland in the form of the Portland Eagles. The team was less successful than the Buckaroos and played its final season in 1951.\nThe state was devoid of a major ice hockey team for nearly a decade but the completion of the Memorial Coliseum allowed the sport to return. The Buckaroos were resurrected and won the league championship in their first year back on the ice. Two more championships followed and the team was successful enough to sign an affiliation deal with the Los Angeles Kings in the 1970s. Unfortunately, the Western Hockey League folded in 1974 and left the Buckaroos scrambling to find a new home. Portland played in the WIHL for a year before attempting to found a fully professional league with 6 other teams in the region. The effort failed and the Northwest Hockey League couldn't complete one season of play.\nIn the wake of Buckaroos dissolution, the Memorial Coliseum was looking for a new tenant. At the same time, the presence of the WHA's Edmonton Oilers made finances difficult for the Edmonton Oil Kings and the team saw relocation as a solution to their problem. The franchise changed its name to Winterhawks and took up residence in the Coliseum. despite playing junior hockey, the team was an instant hit and became one of the top teams in the WHL. Portland had won three league titles and three Memorial Cups, the most recent coming in 2013.\nThe success of the Winterhawks led to an increased interest in junior hockey in the state and several other teams were founded in the early 21st century. The River City Jaguars made their debut in 2004 and were followed by the Eugene Generals and Rogue Valley Wranglers. All three initially played in the Northern Pacific Hockey League, a Tier III junior league but by 2010 River City had moved to nearby Vancouver, Washington. Two years later Rogue Valley, who had since ben renamed the 'Southern Oregon Spartans', joined the Western States Hockey League. They continued with that league until 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic caused the league to suspend operations. Southern Oregon attempted to forge ahead the following year by playing on outdoor rink with limited capacity (mandated by COVID protocols) but they would only able to play six games before folding. The WSHL announced that it would return in 2021–22 with a new franchise in Medford, the Rogue Valley Royals. However, the return never materialized and the Royals ended up joining the USPHL.\nIn the meantime, the Generals continued with the NPHL until the league dissolution in 2016. They then joined the USPHL for two years before playing as an independent during the 2018–19 season. The Generals announced that they were suspending operations in 2019 and would return the following year after promoting out of Tier III, though no formalized plans were given at the time. Their return coincided with the arrival of the pandemic and no further announcements have been made regarding the team, leaving effectively defunct as of 2023.\nTeams.\nTimeline.\n \nPlayers.\nNotable players by city.\nOregon has had a few player of note hail from the state over the years. While several have gone on to play at the highest levels of the sport, many were born in the state but raised elsewhere."

The event has been organized by the Monégasque Tennis Federation ever since 2021, when it began being held in Monte Carlo.\nIt is the most significant tennis event in the U14 circuit of the Tennis Europe calendar year after the five Super Categories and the European Junior Championships, as it features the top eight boys and girls in the under-14 and under-16 categories based on their results throughout the season. Future world No. 1s Kim Clijsters and Rafael Nadal capped their best seasons on the U14 circuit by winning the event in 1997 and 2000 respectively, while players such as Andy Murray, Alexander Zverev, Simona Halep and Belinda Bencic are all former medalists.\nHistory.\nThe season-ending Junior Masters was launched in 1996 with the purpose of rewarding the best-performing players of the year. The Masters officially brings the season to an end, and features the six best European players of both the U14 and U16 circuits based on that season's rankings, plus the finalists of the European Junior Championships. Reggio Calabria hosted the event until 2021, when it began being held on the clay courts of the Monte-Carlo Country Club, also home to the ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Monte-Carlo, under the High Patronage of HSH Prince Albert II of Monaco. From 2023, four Junior Masters players are selected to receive a once-in-a-lifetime stay at the Red Bull Athlete Performance Centre, where they will have a unique opportunity to hone their performance and potential.\nThe Masters, which has worldwide media coverage and is seen as the scouting event for future stars, is broadcast on national television in Monaco and live-streamed online. In 2022, Alena Kovačková became the first player to finish at No. 1 in both Race Rankings age categories. She ultimately chose to play in the U16 competition (which she won), giving the ninth-ranked player of the girls’ U14 list a spot in the event.\nFormat.\nThe 2023 edition featured a revised format, adopting a round-robin phase in line with the ATP and WTA Finals. The eight qualifiers are separated into two groups of four, ensuring three live matches before the two group winners face off in the grand final."

They lodge a protest against the appointment of American tactician Tim Cone as Alaska head coach in 1989. Cone would return to the PBA after acquiring permanent residency. Foreigners could only normally take coaching jobs in the PBA as an active consultant due to the BCAP case.\nThe BCAP has expressed preference for Filipinos in head coaching positions for PBA teams although they insist they remain open for foreigners to fill such roles \"provided that no Filipino is qualified for the job. They do not have the same stance for the head coach position of the national team which they deem as not a permanent role.\nActivities.\nThey organize clinics for local basketball coaches in the Philippines. The BCAP has partnerships with the Philippine Sports Commission, the Philippine Sports Institute, and the International Basketball University of Lithuania."

The Huskies represented the University of Connecticut and were coached by Mike Cavanaugh in his 11th season.\nSeason.\nHopes were high for UConn entering the season but the Huskies had trouble getting off the ground. While the goaltending rotation of Ethan Haider and Arsenii Sergeev performed well in the first month, the offense did not. Matthew Wood, the team's top prospect, had just 3 goals through the first eight games while the rest of the team wasn't much better. Then, when they least could afford it, the Huskies had to contend with a crisis in goal. Once November rolled around, Sergeev appeared to play properly in goal and a pair of very poor performances landed him on the shelf for two months. Haider was able to shoulder the load in the interim thanks to a modest improvement in scoring.\nConnecticut was unable to find any consistency in the first half and they were hoping to remedy that with a strong performance after the winter break. They were able to improve their position with a pair of split series against ranked teams, which included Sergeev's triumphant return against Maine. A second place finish in Connecticut Ice didn't do them many favors but the team had a great opportunity to make a charge for the postseason with six straight games against ranked opponents. Unfortunately, Connecticut won just one of those games and had no hope of securing an at-large bit by the end of the season.\nUConn was given a date with Vermont to start the conference tournament and Sergeev, who had played very well down the stretch, was given the starting job in goal. UConn was able to use a pair of power play markers to capture the match and reach the quarterfinals. The nation's top team, Boston College, was their next opponent but the Huskies didn't appear to be intimidated in the least. Even when BC built a 3-goal lead just 8 minutes into the game, UConn didn't quit. Hudson Schandor got his team back in the game, contributing on a pair of goals, before Matthew Wood scored two in the third period to tie the game 4–4. However, UConn was unable to keep the momentum and a fifth goal from the Eagles was one too many for Connecticut.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 ! style=\"\"; | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \nRankings.\n&lt;br&gt;"

This five game stretch included a win over eleventh-ranked Tennessee and a rivalry win over Florida. Their first loss of the season came in the Ball Dawgs Classic to fourth-ranked Stanford. The Seminoles also lost their ACC–SEC Challenge game to Arkansas and their only other non-conference loss came against second-ranked UCLA. They finished the non-conference season 9–3. They started off their ACC regular season schedule with winning five of their first six games, with the only loss being at third-ranked NC State in overtime. The Seminoles were ranked as highly as number fifteen in the nation before going on a three-game losing skid. They followed that with winning six of their next seven games, with the only loss being in double overtime to twelfth-ranked Notre Dame. They would split the last two games of the regular season, losing to twenty-second-ranked Louisville and defeating Clemson in the final game of the season.\nThe Seminoles finished the season 23–11 overall and 12–6 in ACC play, to finish in a tie for fifth place.

        "text": "The 1926–27 Union Skating Dutchmen men's ice hockey season was the 14th season of play for the program. The Skating Dutchmen represented Union College and were coached by Harold A. Larrabee in his 2nd season.\nSeason.\nThe situation for Union's ice hockey team looked to be improving this season as not only was the Central Park Rink still available to the Dutchmen but H. A. Larrabee returned as coach, the first time the program had the same leader since the end of the war. The player hit the ice as soon as the weather turned cold enough and got as much practice time in as they could before the match with Syracuse. While expectations were for a close game, Union surpassed those predictions with a resounding victory. The returning forward line of Clifford, Gilmour and Hyland played just as well as they had in '26 with the speedy Hyland recording a hat-trick. A big boost to the team was the return of Bruce Mulqueen to the blueline. After missing all of the previous season, Mulqueen was a bulwark on defense and helped new starter Cunningham post the first shutout of his college career.\nUnion faced a much toucher challenge in its second game when the team travelled to take on Williams. Despite being played in a snowstorm, the game was an exciting match that saw both teams have a chance to win all the way until the end. Clifford opened the scoring early and the two then played scoreless for nearly two periods. Beale raised Union's lead at the start of the third but the Ephs finally broke through the pair of goals in quick succession. Hyland gave his team the lead once more but that too was swiftly erased by Williams. The offense continued to press but was unable to secure another goal, leaving Williams' final tally at the end of the period as the game-winner. The team had two home games scheduled before the exam break, however, warm weather forced the cancellation of both.\nThe team was looking forward to a home game after the break but weather intervened once more. This time, however, the team was prepared for the situation and moved the game to their opponent's rink. With Gilmour injured and Mulqueen lost to graduation, the Garnet played one of their finest games to date at Amherst for the second win of the season. Cunningham was particularly notable for his outstanding play that kept his time in long enough for Clifford's second of the match to decide the outcome. A third cancellation was made after the match and left the team with but one home game left on the schedule.\nThe conditions were so bad at the time that even the game with Hamilton was at risk despite their possession of a covered rink. Fortunately, however, the ice was in good enough shape when Union arrived. Union went down to defeat in the game but, after losses of 2–13 and 1–8 over the previous two seasons, the scores were at least getting closer. Following the loss the fifth and final home game was also cancelled. Union was able to play the last game on their schedule when they headed down to Brooklyn to face NYU. The Violets were a very large team, averaging over 180 lbs. per player but that size came at a cost. Union was able to skate rings around the home team and the return of John Gilmour saw the Garnet win their final match of a very trying year.\nThis was the last winning season for the Dutchmen for 13 years.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

The Dolphins, led by fourth-season head coach Nate Champion, played their home games on Ted Grant Court in the Le Moyne Events Center in DeWitt, New York as first-year members of the Northeast Conference and NCAA Division I. This was the 75th season of Le Moyne Dolphins men's basketball.\nPrevious season.\nThe Dolphins finished the 2022–23 season 15–15, 11–9 in Northeast-10 play to finish in a four-way tie for fifth place. As the no. 6 seed in the NE10 tournament, they defeated Saint Michael's in the first round, before falling to Bentley in the quarterfinals. This was Le Moyne's final season as a member of the Northeast-10 Conference, as on May 10, it was announced that they would begin their transition to Division I, joining the Northeast Conference. They officially joined the conference on July 1.\nOffseason.\nFollowing the 2022–23 season, Le Moyne lost Xavier Wilson, who graduated. Wilson was third on the team in points per game with 9.7 and minutes per game with 24.\nZy'Ever Wingfield and Jeremiah Washington were regular members of the Dolphins' rotation, both appearing in all 30 games and playing about 17 minutes per contest. Wingfield had seven starts, and Washington had 10. Wingfield averaged 7.6 points per game, and Washington averaged 5.3. Wingfield transferred to Virginia–Wise, and Washington transferred to Texas A&amp;M International.\nPrior to the announcement of Le Moyne moving to Division I, Jamel Melvin transferred in from Northern Colorado. Melvin played only 11 games with the Bears in 2022–23, and averaged just six minutes per appearance.\nTwo weeks after the move to Division I was announced, Le Moyne signed Ball State transfer Kaiyem Cleary and junior college transfer Ocypher Owens. Cleary appeared in 21 games for the Cardinals in 2022–23, averaging just five minutes per appearance. Owens was named to the all-conference second team in the NJCAA Southern Conference.\nIsaiah Elmore appeared in the Dolphins' first 18 games of the 2022–23 season, starting 17 of them, but he did not play the rest of the season.

        "title": "Telegraph Messengers Rugby League Club",
        "text": "The Telegraph Messengers Club was a rugby league club in Auckland, New Zealand which existed from 1916 to 1919. They competed in the Auckland Rugby League lower grade competitions. They were initially affiliated to the Ponsonby United club before amalgamating with the Maritime Football Club during the 1920 season. They were composed of telegraph messengers for the Post and Telegraph organisation hence their name.\nHistory.\n1916 formation and debut season.\nOn May 8, 1916 “the Telegraph Messengers Club wrote nominating a team for the sixth grade, and the secretary was instructed to make the necessary arrangements for affiliation”. The Observer newspaper said that they were “messenger boys”. They were affiliated with the Ponsonby United club which was common for lower grade teams when forming. Ultimately they entered a Fifth grade team and played their first match against Grafton Athletic at Devonport No. 1 at 2pm on May 20. The score was not reported however they lost the match. The Telegraph Messengers club had protested the result arguing that Emiraldi who played for Grafton was in fact a member of the North Shore Albions. The protest was initially upheld by the junior board but then reversed by the ARL board as Emeraldi was not a member of the North Shore side.\nTheir next match was against North Shore Albions at Victoria Park at 12:45 on May 27. They lost 7 to 6. Their team was listed for the first time and included the following names: Bykers, Foster, Herd (captain), Dodds, Tooley, Knowles, Donaldson, Jones, Tracey, Sharp, Munro, Baker, and Powley. It was reported in late May that the Auckland Rugby League chairman, Dick Benson was having a busy time as an instructor of the junior clubs and he was presently working with the Telegraph Messenger side. The Observer newspaper wrote in early June that “Mr. Sinclair, the organiser of the Telegraph Messengers’ Football Club, is a recent arrival to Auckland from Christchurch, where he has played in the senior grade in past seasons. At present Mr. Sinclair is assisting in coaching the messenger boys, and in all probability will shortly be found donning the jersey for one of the Auckland city teams”.\nThe Star (Christchurch) wrote that “from a private letter received in Christchurch, I learn that C.R. Sinclair, who played for the Northern Suburbs Junior team last season, and who has since been transferred to Auckland, has been successful in forming a League club among the telegraph messengers, with a membership of fifty, and the majority of them players. Mr. Sinclair pays tribute to the league officials in Auckland, who he says, are keen and wide awake, and gave him every assistance”. He was Charles Sinclair and had transferred to Auckland from the Telegraph Dispatch in April, 1915. He also wrote that the Ponsonby Club (which Telegraph Messengers were affiliated with) “is doing everything possible for the youths and schoolboys”. On June 10 the side played Ōtāhuhu Rovers. The behaviour of the Ōtāhuhu team was remarked on at the Wednesday, Auckland Rugby League meeting with chairman Benson saying “this kind of thing will have to be dealt with firmly” when commenting on the ”unruly conduct of the Ōtāhuhu players in the fifth grade match against Telegraph Messengers on Saturday”. It was then decided to caution the entire side. The side struggled to get results, losing to North Shore, Manukau 7–8, Grafton Athletic 2–3, and Ōtāhuhu 5–8, though they were competitive in most matches. Their scorers were rarely reported in the newspapers though their loss to Ōtāhuhu said their try scorer was Dodd, and Knowles converted the try. Heavier defeats followed against North Shore (2-19), and Manukau (7-14) though the later match was awarded to Telegraph Messengers after they protested against a refereeing decision and the Auckland Rugby League agreed. This was the only recorded ‘win’ of their season and following an unreported score against City on August 5 their debut season came to an end. They finished having played 11 matches, with 1 win, 7 losses and 3 unreported results. They scored at least 29 points and had at least 59 scored against them finishing approximately last of the 6 sides. At the end of the season their secretary, Sinclair wrote a letter to the league thanking them for their assistance during the season. In Ponsonby's annual meeting at the start of the following season their annual report recorded that “the club entered one team in each of the first, second, fourth, and sixth grades, and the Telegraph Club, which is affiliated, entered one team in the fifth grade: although no honours came their way, they put up a good performance, which is a credit to the club”.\n1917, Fifth and Sixth Grade teams.\nThe 1917 saw the Telegraph Messengers fielding two teams, once again a fifth grade side was entered, joined by a sixth grade team. The fifth grade side for their opening game against City Rovers A at Victoria Park was: Mathieson, Herd, Richards, Dodds, Knowles, Paris, Donaldson, Campbell, Munro, Bennett, Shaw, Baker (captain), and Powley. While the sixth grade team to play Richmond was: Clayton, Page (captain), Mackey, Cooke, Keefe, Curson, Curtis, Otway, Lee, O’Brien, Churton, Smith, and Pound. The Observer reported at the beginning of the season that \"the Telegraph Messengers are entering two teams this year. Manager Sinclair is proving his worth and is to be congratulated on the way he controls his lads. At a recent meeting of the league it was mentioned that not one complaint was raised against the team during last season. Truly a good record\".\nThe fifth grade side had what was possibly their first on field win when they beat City A by 12 points to 3. However the sixth grade side lost their first ever match going down to Richmond Rovers 7–3. In late May two players joined their sides; Walter George Caddy registering from Richmond to join their 6th grade team, with S Grinlinton joining their 5th grade side from the Newton Rangers club. Towards the end of the season their team lineups were published and the Sixth grade side featured two players named “Cooke”. It is highly likely that one of them is Bert Cooke who went on to become a famous New Zealand rugby international and then later a New Zealand rugby league international. He would have returned to Auckland from his schooling in Hamilton around this time aged 15–16 and was a messenger for the Post and Telegraph Department. He was also known to have played rugby league in the 1910s before joining the Grafton rugby club around 1920.\nThe Fifth grade side only had 3 of their 12 results reported with the win over City and 2 losses to North Shore and City Rovers B. While the Sixth grade side won 1, lost 7 from 11 games with 3 results unreported.\n1918, Three teams and a Fourth Grade championship title.\nThe 1918 season saw the Telegraph Messengers field three teams for the first time and also saw them win their first and only grade championship. Their Fourth grade side won the competition when they defeated Newton Rangers 15 to 2 on September 7. Cliff and Knowles each scored 2 tries, while Bennett kicked a goal. Of their 12 games played they won 8, lost 1, and had 3 scores unreported. Their Fifth Grade side was not so successful, playing 10 games and winning 1 and losing 4 of the games that had results reported. Several of their losses were heavy (0-42, 0–19, and 0–16). While the Sixth grade side also struggled, with 1 win, 6 losses and 7 scores unreported. They had trouble on attack with scores of 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, and 2, before a 13–5 win over Richmond to end their season.\nIn mid season the Herald published all three teams to play in the July 20 matches. The Fourth Grade side included: N. Dodds (captain), E. Smith, G. Baker, H. Munro, W. Tracey, Herd, A. Bennett, B. Daly, H. Knowles, D. Campbell, S. Sharpe, R. Cliffe, and L. Manley. The fifth grade team named was A. Page, Caddy, W. Whittington, L, Baker, Walker, Menzies, Keefe, Daly, Pearce, Clayton, Dean, Troup, O’Brien, Smith, and McIntosh. While the Sixth grade side was: B. Sweeney, W. Somers, G. McLean, C. Moore, L. Moore, R. Grantly, R. Kelly, S. Dowle, R. Sandford, Wigg, Sleave, Brown, G. Sutherland, D. Sallen, Sampson, and Clark.\nAt the end of the season the Telegraph Messengers fourth grade side travelled to Thames by the Wakatere Steamer to play an exhibition game. The match was played on October 12 and saw the Messengers side win 12 to 10. Richmond had finished runners up in the championship to them. For the winning side Daly, Cliffe, Herd, and Shark scored tries with Seagar and Grigg scoring for Richmond, with J. Henderson kicking 2 goals.\n1919, Three teams and affiliation with Maritime.\nIn 1919 the Post and Telegraph club again fielded three teams in the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth grades. It was to be their last season as a standalone organisation as in the middle of the season they affiliated with the Maritime Football Club. The Fourth grade team fared best of the 3 sides finishing one point behind City Rovers in second place, tied with Ōtāhuhu Rovers. At the start of their season their team was named and was virtually identical to the side which won the competition the previous season; Manley, Cliff, Sharpe, Dodds, Campbell, Bell, Bennett, Baker, Smith, Tracey, Herd, and Munro. Their Fifth and Sixth grade teams were also very similar to the 1918 teams.\nOn June 14 the Post and Telegraph Football Club held a meeting in the Auckland Rugby League ‘League Rooms’ during the evening. This was unusual and indicated that there was a serious issue to be discussed. They went so far as to publish an advertisement in the New Zealand Herald. It asked “all members to attend a THIS (SATURDAY) NIGHT, to be held in the League Rooms, 5 Swanson Street, at 7:30 p.m. Business: Urgent and important”, and was sent in by W. Pearce, their honorary secretary. It seems that there was a dispute within the club about who had control over it. Messrs Charles Sinclair (their original secretary and organiser of the club), and W. Pearce travelled to the Auckland Rugby League officers on June 25 to the weekly meeting there. They reportedly “waited on the committee to discuss misunderstandings in connection with the Post and Telegraph Club. One stated that the P. and T. Football Club was, or had until recently been under the control of the P. and T. Social Club and asked the league to recognise that social body; while the other gentleman contended otherwise. The committee decided that the matter was one outside its jurisdiction, as it could recognise only registered and affiliated bodies, but the deputation was advised by Mr. Carlaw as to the course most likely to avert further friction”.\nOn July 12 all three team lists were published for their July 13 matches. Significantly these were to be their last games as a Telegraph Messengers/Post and Telegraph named club. They made an application to be affiliated with the Maritime Football Club and it was granted at the board meeting on July 17. Interestingly at the start of the 1920 season W. Pearce of the Telegraph club was appointed the honorary secretary of the Maritime club.\nAppearances in midweek competitions.\nIn 1922 a Post and Telegraph rugby league competition was played midweek in Auckland. They played for the Engineers Cup of the Post and Telegraph Department with matches played on Thursday afternoons at Victoria Park. The teams involved were Postmen, Linesmen, Telegraph, Messengers, Workshops, and Faultmen. Then in 1923 Post and Telegraph entered a side in the Wednesday competition. They won it with 7 wins from 8 games, beating Tramways in the final 16-15. Their side featured the likes of Arthur Singe and Wally Somers. Somers was a New Zealand representative from 1919 to 1928, while Singe played for New Zealand in 1925 and 1926. They both worked for the company. Throughout the same time period there was also a Post and Telegraph Rugby Football Club which played rugby union, and in 1922 they amalgamated with the Technical College Old Boys to become known as United. However in 1927 the club reverted back to the name Technical College Old Boys and in 1950 they moved to Cornwall Park and took on the name Cornwall. In the 1980s they became Carlton Rugby Football Club and in 1996 merged with Grammar, with further mergers following they are now part of the Grammar TEC RC.\nThe Post and Telegraph Department occasionally fielded rugby league teams into the 1930s before ceasing to do so at some point. In 1929 they played in a one off match against the Trotting Trainers. The in 1931 they played in the midweek competition at Carlaw Park.\nRecords.\nThe results are incomplete. The \"New Zealand Herald\" and \"Auckland Star\" published the fixture list each week with details, but results were only sent to the newspapers sporadically during the season, so these records have been compiled from the known results."

The Hurricanes were led by nineteenth-year head coach Katie Meier and played their home games at the Watsco Center as members of the Atlantic Coast Conference. \nThe Hurricanes started the season with eight straight wins. During the win streak, they won their early season tournament, the Miami Thanksgiving Tournament, and defeated a ranked Mississippi State team on the road in the ACC–SEC Challenge. Miami was ranked 24th for their match up with number 10 Baylor, but they lost 57–75. That would be Miami's only loss of their non-conference schedule as they finished 10–1. The team could not carry their momentum from non-conference play into the ACC schedule as they lost four of their first five games. They followed that with a win over number 4 NC State. They would go on from there to win four of their next six games, including an overtime victory over Clemson. The Hurricanes then went on a three game losing streak before winning two of their last three games.

The Fighting Illini were led by second-year head coach Shauna Green, and they played their home games at State Farm Center. This season marked the program's 42nd season as a member of the Big Ten Conference.\nPrevious season.\nThe Illini finished the 2022–23 season 22–10 overall, with a 11–7 record in Big Ten play to finish in sixth place. As the sixth seed in the Big Ten women's tournament, they defeated eleventh seed Rutgers in the first round before losing to third seed Maryland in the second round. \nThe team was invited to the 2023 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament as one of the First Four teams to play, losing to Mississippi State. This marked their first appearance in the NCAA tournament since 2003.\nThe Illini's turnaround in 2022–23 was considered \"remarkable\" given the program's history since 2003. The 2022–23 team broke multiple records and streaks, including their first 6–0 start to a season since 1986–87, and their first six game winning streak since 2009. They finished the non-conference portion of their schedule with a 10–1 record. The team won four straight conference games from December 7, 2022, through January 1, 2023, including a dramatic victory over eventual national champion runner-up Iowa; this conference winning streak tied the fourth best streak in program history.\nOn January 8, 2023, the Illini earned a spot in the AP Top-25 poll for the first time since 2000. Their 11–7 conference record was its most in league play since 1999–2000, and their 10-win improvement in conference games matched the largest turnaround in Big Ten history.\nOn December 19, 2022, coach Green was named the ESPN Women's Basketball Coach of the Week. In the post-season, transfer player Makira Cook earned First-team All-Big Ten honors, the first Illini to be named to that team since 2010. Cook was also named to the Associated Press' All-American Honorable Mention list, the first Illini to make that list since 2013. Players Kendall Bostic and Genesis Bryant were named to the All-Big Ten second team, and Adalia McKenzie received an All-Big Ten honorable mention; these conference honors marked the first time since the 1986–87 season that four Illinois players earned all-conference accolades.\nOffseason.\nAssistant coach Ryan Gensler left the Illinois program on March 29, 2023, to become the head women's basketball coach at the University of Akron. On April 20, 2023, Green announced that former Stanford University assistant coach Britney Anderson had been hired as an assistant coach at Illinois.\nTwo non-starting players from the 2022–23 Illinois team, Jayla Oden and Liisa Taponen, entered the NCAA transfer portal after the end of the season and moved on to other programs, and Geovana Lopes exhausted her collegiate eligibility.\nThe Illini added two players from the transfer portal, center Camille Hobby from North Carolina State University and forward Shay Bollin from Duke University. They also added freshmen guards Cori Allen and Gretchen Dolan to the roster. \nAll five of the 2022–23 starting lineup returned for the 2023–24 season. The team was ranked number 23 in the Associated Press preseason Top 25, their first preseason ranking since 1999.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=\"6\" style=| Exhibition\n!colspan=\"9\" style=| Regular season\n!colspan=\"6\" style=| Big Ten Women's Tournament\n!colspan=\"6\" style=| WBIT"

However it was not until 1963 that a formal \"circuit\" was organised. In its first season it was held in late August and September but from 1964 it was moved to a later date, generally starting in mid-November. Initially the New Zealand PGA Championship, was not included in the circuit but from 1968-69 it was added, together with the Spalding Masters, extending the circuit into January.\nThe circuit enjoyed considerable success for a number of years, but by 1979–80 it had been reduced to just three events.

Fencing was done to 15 touches or to the completion of three three-minute rounds if neither fencer reached 15 touches by then. At the end of time, the higher-scoring fencer was the winner; a tie resulted in an additional one-minute sudden-death time period. This sudden-death period was further modified by the selection of a draw-winner beforehand; if neither fencer scored a touch during the minute, the predetermined draw-winner won the bout.\nResults.\nThe following are the results of the event. \nQualification.\nAll 18 fencers were put into three groups of six athletes, were each fencer would have five individual matches. The top 14 athletes overall would qualify for next round."

        "title": "1945 Auckland Rugby League season",
        "text": "The 1945 Auckland Rugby League season was its 37th. Ōtāhuhu Rovers achieved several milestones in the 1945 season. They won the Rukutai Shield for the second time but the first as a stand-alone club with their win in 1942 season coming as a combined side with City Rovers due to senior teams being depleted by the war effort. They won it by earning the most competition points during the first round. Ōtāhuhu went on to win the minor championship for the first time when they finished 1 competition point ahead of the Richmond Rovers. In a somewhat confusing format the top 4 teams then played off for the major championship. Ōtāhuhu were defeated in the semi final by Ponsonby United, who then lost the final to Richmond. The league then declared that Ōtāhuhu as minor champions and Richmond as 'major' champions should play off to find the major champion for the season. Ōtāhuhu won 11–5 to become the official senior club champion for the 1945 season. At a meeting on September 26 several delegates “expressed the opinion that the minor and major competitions had been a muddle and more consideration should be given to them next season”. With chairman Watson saying a conference would be arranged for a “more definite policy after consultations with all senior clubs”. The Dickson medal for the most sportsmanlike player was awarded to Jim Fogarty of the Ōtāhuhu side, while V. Fredatovich won the same for the City 3rd grade team. Brian Nordgren set a record for the most number of points scored in a season in all games and was presented with a silver cup. At the same time Colin Riley (Ōtāhuhu) was presented with the Painter Trophy for the most successful goal kicker.\nIn representative competition matches Auckland had two wins over South Auckland (Waikato), another over West Coast, and two against Wellington. Auckland Māori lost to Huntly District at Davies Park in Huntly, while they also went down to Auckland Pākehā at Carlaw Park. Auckland had a strong representation in the North Island side as always in their inter-island match with South Island with 11 players selected for the team which won 18–8.\n \n \nNews.\nAnnual Meeting.\nAnnual report.\nDays prior to the Auckland Rugby League annual meeting their annual report of the previous [1944] season was released. The Auckland Star reported \"after a 1944 season which is officially described as a trail of wet Saturdays, the Auckland Rugby League finished with a record revenue of £5295, an increase of £975 on the 1943 season. The thirty-fifth annual report, which will be presented at the annual meeting, states that following a deputation and conference with the Senior Officers’ Association, the Board of Control decided as a trial for the 1945 season that the senior competition be played on a minor and major scheme, which will allow more Saturdays for the playing of representative football. The report states that the working expenses show an increase of £477 over the previous year. The amount paid to clubs and for the benefit of players for the past two years, with the figures for 1943 in parentheses are; Grants to clubs, £772 (£474); insurance to players, £172 (£180); injured players, £236 (£256); total, £1180 (£910). Principal revenue items are:- Grandstand receipts, £679; gates, £3539; revenue from two minor representative games totalled £465, ground rents, £186; representative matches, £455. The total assets are £11,667 and liabilities £1542. Investments in war loans amount to £1690. The report mentions that the Junior Control Board conducted a full schedule of grade championships, but a difficulty was experiences in getting sufficient playing grounds. The trustees of the Injured Players’ Fund dealt with a large number of cases during the season. Since the inauguration of the fund over £2000 has been paid to disabled players.\nAnnual General Meeting.\nThe 35th Annual General Meeting was held on Wednesday, March 28 at 7.45pm in the League Rooms in the Chamber of Commerce Building, Courthouse Lane. The honorary secretary prior to the meeting was Ivan Culpan. At the annual meeting the president, Mr. J.F.W. Dickson said “there was a splendid response from the Auckland public, and the past season was one to be proud of”. He also paid tribute to the work of the former president, the late Mr. George Grey Campbell. Chairman of the Board of Control, Mr. J.W. Watson said “that there was a feeling of great satisfaction over a record past season. The teams had given the public the class of football that was needed, and great credit was due to the club members, players and officials. The Junior Control Board had functioned well, and for schoolboy football. The league owed a lot to the people who took an interest in the schoolboys. The standard of play had been good, and there was every reason to anticipate a successful coming season”. Watson then went on to discuss the shortage of playing grounds, commenting that “there had been short-sightedness on the part of the local authorities in providing sufficient playing grounds for sport. There was a great difficulty, and it was deplorable that in a city like Auckland that all kinds of sport should be in a bad position about grounds. The war had been partly responsible, as some of the playing areas had not been restored, and there was no indication that there would be any more grounds available in 1945, with the possible exception of Waikaraka Park in Onehunga. The following officers were elected: Patron, Mr. James Bell Donald; vice patron, Mr. J.F.W. Dickson; president, Ernest John Osborne (newly elected); senior club delegates to the board of control, Messrs. Jim Clark, William John Probert, M. Horan, David Wilkie; chairman of the board of control, Mr. J.W. Watson, E.J. (Ted) Phelan, Archibald Stormont; referees's delegate, Mr. William Mincham; auditors, Messrs. Garrard and Bennett; hon. solicitor, Mr. H.M. Rogerson. The following officers were elected at a meeting of the Board of Control, which followed: Deputy-chairman, Mr. Ted Phelan; hon. secretary, Mr. Ivan Culpan; time-keepers, Messrs. T. Hill and G. McCowatt; hon. treasurer, Press steward and delegate to the New Zealand Rugby League, Mr. Robert Doble. They also decided to open the season on April 14, with nominations closing on April 4. On May 16 at the league meeting it was announced that Mr. Edward (Ted) Knowling, who had been away from New Zealand with the Armed Forces was reappointed as the treasurer to the league.\nSenior competition.\nAt the board of control meeting on April 4 it was decided to play the senior competition with the same ten teams which had competed in it the previous season. On April 11 chairman J.W. Watson said that there would be a new format with major and minor championships being competed for in the second round. After the first round the competition would be split into a top half and a bottom half. At the same meeting the president of the Referees’ Association protested against the present method of appointments of referees for senior matches and that qualified referees were in a better position to make the appointments”. In mid May the league decided that the Senior B competition should fall under the control of the Junior Control Board, though it took the casting vote of the chairman to pass. They did however decide that the players should receive senior insurance.\nAt the May 23 board meeting, chairman Watson raised concern about the continued lack of form shown by the Newton and Pt Chevalier sides. He said “that the Newton team had not shown improvement. The Point Chevalier team was now in its second year, and it did not seem to have made a serious step forward”. Mr. William Mincham said that the Point Chevalier team was endeavouring to improve its position. It had put up some good performances against other teams and had not been annihilated”. The league decided to ask both clubs to send representatives to the next meeting. Following the meeting on May 30 which involved a discussion in committee, the chairman reported that “the officials of the clubs were working hard, and that there was every prospect of considerable improvement in the standard of play in the near future”.\nGoal kicking trophy.\nAt the April 18 board meeting it was decided that the Lance Painter Cup for goal kicking should be awarded for the most points gained in the 14 matches for the minor championship. As in the previous season, Colin Riley of the Ōtāhuhu side would go on to win it in a closely fought battle with John Anderson neck and neck with him until the final round.\nCarlaw Park.\nAt the annual meeting chairman, Mr. Watson said that “it was necessary to improve the condition of the terraces at Carlaw Park. It was their intention to do concrete work once building restrictions were lifted. And it was proposed as an urgent matter to rebuild the gate entrances in the form of a memorial to fallen soldiers and a number of past officials”. It was also proposed that the future home of the Auckland Rugby League management committee be at Carlaw Park with rooms to be constructed. On April 4 word was received that the district building controller had not approved of an application in connection with the proposed improvements to the main entrance gates. However they were prepared to approve of work to make the existing ticket boxes structurally safe and weatherproof. The prices for entry to weekly club matches were set at 1/ for ground admission, 6d for entry to the railway stand. Returned Servicemen with the New Zealand Shoulder Badges would be admitted to the ground for free. On May 18 it was reported that attendances were up 28 percent on the previous season. On June 20 the board thanked Mr. A. Stormont for the gift of Acmena trees to “beautify Carlaw Park”, while Mr. D. Stormont gifted £10 10/ for the same purpose. In July it was reported at a weekly meeting that £524 had been given to the injured players’ fund from gate receipts. It was reported in the Auckland Star on September 28 that a glass bottle had been thrown at Carlaw Park on July 21 which struck a female spectator in the terraces. The police investigated at the time and found two empty bottles “close to where the defendant (William J. Gemmell) was standing”. It had occurred during the Auckland – Wellington match following Wellington's first try. It was prohibited to take liquor into the ground, though Mr. Teape said at the trial that the notices were disregarded. The Senior Magistrate, Mr. J.H. Luxford said he was “very surprised to hear that. If it is generally done I have not seen it any time I have been there”.\nGrounds.\nWaikaraka Park (Onehunga).\nIn April the Onehunga Borough Council advised the league that the playing area at Waikaraka Park would not be available for use by the league this year. The park had been handed back to the council by the Army authorities after they had used it for war time activities and it was now being reconstructed by the Works Department. They were hopeful that part of the ground might be ready for use by 1946. There was a large amount of metal that “would be left to work through the soil”. \nJellicoe Park (Manurewa).\nIn early May the Manurewa Borough Council advised the Auckland Rugby League that Jellicoe Park would be available for rugby league matches on alternate Saturday's.\nMatches at Ellerslie, Mount Wellington, and Glen Eden.\nOn May 16 the Ellerslie club requested that two senior matches be played in the area. One at Ellerslie and one at Mount Wellington. “It was pointed out that the Mount Wellington area was a growing district, which covered Mount Wellington, Penrose, and Panmure. The chairman, Mr. Watson said it was “a very good idea” and that they might as well play matches there as at Point Chevalier and Mount Albert. It was also indicated that rugby league might be “revived” in Mount Wellington in 1946. A senior match between City and Pt Chevalier was played at the Glen Eden Recreation Ground on August 18. At the July 25 meeting the Pt Chevalier club protested the decision to play their match at Glen Eden as they had been made to play at an outside ground on 6 of the 11 weeks of the competition. Mr. R. Doble said that “Walker Park was the club’s home ground”. Chairman, Mr. J.W. Watson said that it was the club's first year and did not feel that it had suffered any hardship”.\nAuckland clubs on tour.\nLate in the season permission was granted for Ōtāhuhu to travel to the West Coast, Richmond to New Plymouth on October 6, and Ponsonby to play an exhibition game in Cambridge on October 13.\nSocial evening and dance.\nOn Thursday, August 2 the Ladies’ Social Committee organised a dance at the Peter Pan Cabaret. The special guests were the West Coast rugby league team. Mrs. Rowe was the honorary secretary of the Ladies’ Social Committee. On August 8 Mrs. I Scott on behalf of the Ladies’ Committee presented a cheque for 100 guineas to the injured players fund. Then on October 4 they held the Auckland Rugby League Dance at the Peter Pan Cabaret with the South Island team being the quests for the evening.\nVisit of Balmain.\nIn late June the Balmain club side from Sydney sent a proposal to the Auckland Rugby League to play a series of matches. It was decided to discuss it at the next board meeting on July 4. The Balmain side had won the championship the previous season and had five players in the New South Wales side which had recently played Queensland. After meeting, the Auckland Rugby League offered to arrange matches for Balmain on October 12, 20, and 22, with the possibility of a match on Wednesday, October 17. Plans later firmed to begin the tour on October 13. It was originally attended to try and fly the team to and from New Zealand but this was not possible due to a lack of space so they would travel by boat. The tour was abruptly cancelled however on August 1 when the Balmain club notified the ARL that they were unable to secure confirmed return transportation. Their secretary, Mr Harold Matthews wrote “we can get over all right, but because of lack of regular shipping facilities there is no guarantee we can get back”.\nPlayer news.\nBrian Nordgren.\nIn December it was reported that Brian Nordgren had been signed by Wigan following a magnificent, record breaking season in Auckland rugby league. He was also a well known sprinter and co-holder of the New Zealand junior 100 yards record. Nordgren transferred from the Manukau Rovers rugby club towards the end of the 1944 season and joined the Ponsonby rugby league club for their last few games. He scored 267 points across all teams and was the first player in New Zealand to ever score 100 points from tries alone in a single season. After moving to England he played 294 games for Wigan from 1946 to 1955 scoring 312 tries and kicking 109 goals. After returning to New Zealand following his playing retirement he practices law in Auckland and Hamilton and also coached Ponsonby.\nAllan Wiles switches codes.\nIn March rumours surfaced that Allan Wiles was going to switch from rugby union to rugby league. Wiles had been one of the best centre three-quarters in Auckland Rugby the previous season and played for New Zealand Services against New Zealand. Wiles had also represented the Auckland rugby side. He was rumoured to be going to play for Mount Albert United and the rumours turned out to be true. Wiles would go on to become Kiwi #312 in 1948. Wiles also played 5 first class cricket games for Auckland in the 1946/47 season while representing the Ponsonby-Balmoral club.\nTransfer wrangle with George Mitchell.\nOn April 19 it was reported that a request had been made for George Mitchell to be allowed to play for Ponsonby, having previously been a member of the Richmond club. Ponsonby had appealed after Richmond had decided not to give permission for him to transfer. Mitchell said that he “had been in the Armed Forces for the last three years For two seasons he played rugby, but he did not play any football last season. He decided to have a spell, in view of getting a clearance to play for Ponsonby this season. As he had not played for 12 months he considered that he was entitled to ask for a clearance”. Mitchell, a Pacific Island born player had represented New Zealand in 1939, while his older brother Alf Mitchell also played for New Zealand in 1935. A week later it was announced that Mitchell would be allowed to play for Ponsonby after Richmond no longer objected.\nOpai Asher testimonial match.\n On September 8 a testimonial match was played for Opai (Albert) Asher who was the groundsman at Carlaw Park. He had been a well known New Zealand international playing 7 matches for them from 1910 to 1913. Prior to that Asher played rugby union for the All Blacks in 11 matches in 1903, scoring a remarkable 17 tries. After switching to rugby league Asher played 63 matches for City Rovers from 1909 to 1917 scoring 16 tries and kicking 22 goals. His representative rugby league career included 22 appearances for New Zealand Māori, 2 for Australasia in 1910, and 18 for Auckland. At the end of the 1945 season he was retiring and moving back to Tauranga to spend his retirement years with his family. The match was a Roope Rooster replay between Ōtāhuhu and City who had drawn 7-7 the previous week despite 20 minutes of extra time being played. It was reported after the match that £150 had been received and that more money was expected to come in. He was eventually presented with a cheque for £164 by Ted Phelan.\nRepresentative season.\nIn April the Auckland representative selectors were appointed and were Jack Kirwan, J Clark, and Dougie McGregor. On the motion of Mr. Watson it was decided that admission to representative matches in 1945 the charge would be 1/6, plus 1/ to the grandstand. On July 26 Auckland beat Wellington 46 to 7 at Carlaw Park. While the result was extremely one sided the match drew 12,000 spectators and earned £744 in gate takings with the net being £709. This was divided equally among the two league's which would receive £354 each.\nSchoolboy tour and news.\nIn August the Auckland Schoolboys toured the south with L Rout and Maurice Wetherill travelling with the side. Their first match was played against Canterbury in Greymouth and was won 14 to 3. They lost their next match to West Coast on August 26 by 14 points to 2. On September 19 at the ARL board meeting the lack of a grade between primary school and post high school was lacking for boys of that age. L. Rout from the Schoolboys grade management committee was part of a deputation to the board meeting and he said “school football in New Zealand is at sixes and sevens, and there is a need for uniformity about weights and ages”. He went on to point out that “when the boys left the schoolboy ranks and went to secondary school no provision was made for them. The Schoolboys’ Board asked the league to provide a grade to take care of those boys. The Junior Control Board, it was stated, was in agreement with the proposal. They wanted to cater for boys up to 16 years in the secondary schools, with a weight limit of 8st 9lb. The Junior Control Board could then carry on. At present there was a big gap and it should be filled. Maurice Wetherill said that at present there was a gap between schoolboy football and the seventh grade”. The chairman, Mr. J. W. Watson suggested that further discussion on the matter. It was decided a week later that the School Control Board be given permission to organise a secondary schools’ competition for 1946 with the maximum age to be 16 on May 1, and the maximum weight 8st 9lb. At an Arl meeting on October 16 Mr. E.J. Osborne said that “it was necessary to get the game into the schools to make a real success of the code in the Dominion”. Maurice Wetherill said that they had “450 schoolboys playing the code. The aim now was to get the game going in the secondary schools, and to start a competition with a weight limit of about 8st 9lb”. Mr. I Stonex said that in the past season they had 55 teams in the schoolboy competition.\nObituaries.\nPhillip George Thomas Donovan.\nOn March 10, 1945, Phillip (Phil) Donovan was accidentally killed in Italy aged 28. He went to school at St. John's Convent and Parnell School where he had lived with his parents who predeceased him. He played juniors for Marist and then for Marist Old Boys seniors from 1937 to 1941 as a five eighth along with his brother Jack who had retired and become a senior referee. The Auckland Star wrote “he was a powerful attacking back and perhaps best known by his fine sportsmanship”. His other brothers, Alan and Eugene were current players for City. Phil joined the Army in 1941 and left New Zealand in May, 1943. While in the Middle East he “played good football in games between the divisional teams”.

He died “as the result of injuries received when he fell into a hot pool” near Tarewa Road on the morning of December 3. It was “understood that he was cooking his breakfast over a pool in the morning when the ground on which he was standing suddenly caved in.

Roosevelt. The season was opened with Auckland Rugby League president E.J. Osborne kicking off. The Marist side featured former New Zealand international, and prodigious goal kicker, John Anderson who had transferred back to the club after a season with Point Chevalier. He scored a try and kicked 4 goals in their win over City. For Mt Albert there were three rugby transfers making their debut, including future Kiwi, Allan Wiles. The Ōtāhuhu side featured 4 brothers in the forward pack. They were Joffre Johnson who would become a Kiwi in 1947, Ivan, Mick, and Norm. Norm had previously represented Auckland and weighed 14 stone. While the North Shore match with Manukau saw the debut of Jack Russell-Green who was said to have played gamely at halfback against the huge Manukau forward pack. In 1949 he was selected for the New Zealand side and became Kiwi #321. The others were Ray Neary and Des Pike. Richmond had Des Ryan on debut in their game against Pt Chevalier. Ryan had switched from rugby union where he had represented Auckland three years earlier. In the same match Pt Chevalier had promoted Doug Anderson from their 4th grade side. He was said to have shown promise and would go on to represent New Zealand from 1947 to 1954. Following the matches it was reported that the gate takings for the opening round were the highest for years.\nRound 2.\nWifred Brimble debuted for Ponsonby after having returned from the war. He had previously played for Newton from 1935 to 1939, and represented Auckland in 1939 and New Zealand in 6 matches in 1938. It was reported following the second round that the gate takings had thus far been more than double the amount from the corresponding period in 1944. Chairman Watson said that “it was an augury of a successful season and showed the great interest being taken in sport”. Arthur Desmond (Des) Pike scored a try for Mt Albert. He had switched codes and had represented Auckland rugby previously, as well as being an Auckland junior cricket representative. He was heavily involved in the war effort, making specialist equipment for the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and midway through the year began playing rugby union once more for Army sides. He later represented Wellington at rugby union.\nRound 3.\nThe match between Richmond and Newton on Carlaw Park 2 saw Richmond win by an Auckland senior club record score of 70 points to 0. The score at halftime was 34–0. H Hobman was on debut as a senior grade referee in the same match. The main match saw the two best goal kickers in Auckland going head to head with John Anderson representing Marist, while Colin Riley was kicking for Ōtāhuhu. They each kicked 3 goals, though Riley was to go on to kick the most in the season, a feat he achieved the year prior also. In the match between Manukau and Mt Albert Tommy Chase was forced into the fullback role for Manukau in the absence of Ralph Martin who had transferred to Ōtāhuhu. Chase had first “come into prominence as a rugby union player in the Whanganui district when, at 17 years of age he was a member of the New Zealand Māori team which visited Australia in 1935”. He moved to Auckland and joined the Manukau club along with his brother Rangi Chase. George Mitchell had joined Ponsonby and scored for them in their loss to City. He had come to Auckland from Feilding Old Boys rugby side in 1937 along with his brother Alf Mitchell and joined the Richmond club. In 1939 he was selected for New Zealand to tour England. Both brothers were born in the Pacific Islands to a Samoan mother and English father and were two of the first ever Pacific Island representatives in the New Zealand rugby league side.\nRound 4.\nPonsonby had suffered a large number of injuries early in the season and had a weakened side in their loss to Ōtāhuhu. It included Don Mullett, who was also a well known champion heavy weight boxer. Dick Hull, their captain was also out injured with a bad leg injury. Arthur Kay had broken ribs in their final practice match and had not played thus far but hoped to back a week later. While Wilfred Brimble was also thought to be a spectator as well. The Auckland Star wrote a piece on match day about the various hookers in the competition. Kenneth Finlayson was back playing for Marist after having played for them several seasons earlier (1937–41) before a move to Ōtāhuhu (1942–43) and then to Manukau (1944). He was the son of Charles Finlayson who had played cricket for New Zealand and also rugby league for New Zealand in 1913. The merry-go-round continued with Owen Hughes starting his career with City now playing for Ponsonby after having played for Ōtāhuhu in between, Raymond Lohenet moving from Ponsonby to City. It was also rumoured that the veteran Bert Leatherbarrow, who had represented City in 1944, would turn out for them later in the year, after stints with North Shore (1931–34) and Mt Albert (1937-43). Ron Neary scored his first try for Mt Albert. He had switched from rugby union at the start of the season from the Marist club and had previously played centre for the Auckland representative team.\nRound 5.\nRon McGregor made his first appearance of the season for Richmond after having been injured.\nRound 6.\nRound 6 was originally scheduled for May 19 but due to very wet weather the grounds were “sodden” with “large pools of water on the No. 2 ground at Carlaw Park, and the decision was made to postpone the round early on Saturday morning. It was then played on the following weekend.\nRound 7.\nIn the match between Richmond and Ponsonby Travers Hardwick and James Morrell both left the field injured for Ponsonby. They were replaced by former New Zealand internationals George Tittleton and Arthur Kay.\nRound 8.\nDes Ryan, an ex-Auckland rugby union representative played a good game for Richmond in their win over Manukau. John Anderson had a very rare off day with the boot for Marist. He missed all 7 shots for goal in a 2-point loss to Mt Albert. With Ōtāhuhu's heavy defeat of North Shore at Ellerslie Reserve they passed the 1,000 points scored mark for first grade rugby league matches in the championship. They had first played in the grade in 1914 but struggled during the war years to field competitive teams and it wasn't until the 1943 season that they became properly established again in the top grade.\nRound 9.\nBoth Ron McGregor and Bernard Lowther were absent for Richmond however they still managed to defeat Marist 13 to 5. Following City's 7-7 draw they became the first club in senior rugby league in Auckland to pass 6,000 points scored in first grade championship matches.\nRound 10.\nW Topia scored for Manukau in their 21–13 loss to Ōtāhuhu. He had recently moved to Auckland from the Hokianga District.\nRound 11.\nRound 11 saw Puti Tipene (Steve) Watene turning out for City. He had debuted in 1929 for City and also spent time playing for Manukau, and Newton before returning to City for the 1945 season playing over 170 club matches in total and 38 representative matches. The match between Richmond and Pt Chevalier was played in Mount Wellington in inner east Auckland as an exhibition match. Richmond won 15 points to 7, though like several of the matches played on suburban grounds no individual scoring was reported in the Monday newspapers. R Merrick debuted as a senior grade referee in the game between Newton and North Shore at Carlaw Park.\nRound 12.\nThe match between Newton and Marist was played at Fowlds Park in Morningside in a “sea of mud”. Newton who had been having a terrible season caused an upset by winning 5–4. Leo Davis made his first appearance for Richmond in the season against Ōtāhuhu. He was an Auckland representative from 1941 to 1943. Royce Speedy was missing for Ōtāhuhu through injury while L Williams for Richmond had to leave the field due to an injury and was replaced by Rennie. Frank Furnell was reported to have played his best game for Richmond since his return from service in the Middle East where he was serving in the war. In the same match referee Stuart Billman became the first ever referee in Auckland to officiate 150 senior rugby league games.\nRound 13.\nRound 13 saw ‘Chairman’s Round’, an initiative started in 1944. The chairman (Mr. J.W. Watson) was given the task of choosing a head to head match up to be the main game at Carlaw Park with Richmond and Manukau selected. Mr. Joseph Patrick Moodabe, who was a well known sportsman had donated a ”handsome trophy for the winning side”. An unprecedented situation unfolded following the match. An inquiry was held post match due to an injury received by former New Zealand international, Jack Satherley who was playing for Richmond. A scrum had been set and he saw seen to “reel and fall” and stayed down “on the ground for some time receiving attention” from an apparent headbutt. At the inquiry referee Jack Hawkes and some players gave evidence. After their Wednesday board meeting the Auckland Rugby League suspended Joseph Zimmerman of Manukau for the remainder of the season. Given the referee had not witnessed the incident and no action was taken on the field against him it must have only been through the statements of players that he was found guilty of misconduct which had never happened before in the code in Auckland. At Ōtāhuhu the local team played North Shore and won 18–7. They were missing some of their regular players but fielded D Smith at fullback. In somewhat of an unusual cross over he was the Auckland B grade table tennis champion. In the same match Ivor Stirling, the former New Zealand international made his first appearance of the season at halfback for North Shore.\nRound 14.\nThe final round of the competition had Richmond sitting on 22 competition points and Ōtāhuhu on 21 points. A win to Richmond would have seen them declared ‘minor championship’ champions however they lost to Mt Albert 12-7 while Ōtāhuhu beat Marist 10–0 to claim the title. The curtain raiser badly cut up the field for the main match. Ahead of the matches Marist's John Anderson, and Ōtāhuhu's Colin Riley were equal with 43 goals each for the season. Anderson did not kick any goals in their 10–0 loss, while Riley kicked 2 goals in Ōtāhuhu's win thereby giving him the Lance Painter Trophy for goal kicking for the second consecutive season.\nMajor Championship.\nFollowing the completion of the minor championship rounds Auckland Rugby League played major championship semi finals. This was the first ever time they had done such a thing in the history of the competition and it had an element of being made up as the season went along. Ōtāhuhu were knocked out in the semi finals, and then belatedly later in the season the ARL decided that they, as minor champions would play the winner of the major championship to decide the ARL champion for the season and winner of the Fox Memorial Shield.\nSemi finals.\nBrian Nordgren continued his record breaking point scoring season with 16 points in Ponsonby's 28–18 win over Ōtāhuhu with 2 tries, 3 conversions and 2 penalties. Veteran player, and former New Zealand international George Tittleton played at scrum half for Ponsonby, with Arthur Kay, another former New Zealand representative and long serving Ponsonby player taking the field at first five eighth. He was in his 13th season for them and to this point was their second highest ever scorer with approximately 531 points points, behind only Frank Delgrosso with 767.\nMajor Championship Final.\nThis match was played to find the overall 1945 senior club champion and winner of the Fox Memorial Shield. Ōtāhuhu had won the regular season competition while Richmond had won the ‘major championship’ playoffs. Auckland Rugby League then decided that these two teams should meet to find the best side.\nRoope Rooster.\nThe game between City and Ōtāhuhu was tied at 7–7 at full time. An unprecedented 4 periods of extra time were played of 5 minutes each but no winner was found. It was the only time that many minutes had been played with no victor. In the past 10 minutes extra had been played with no winner. It meant that the two teams had to play a replay the following weekend. Another of the matches also went to extra time with North Shore and Pt Chevalier tied 15–15 at the conclusion. Horace Hunt kicked a penalty for North Shore to take the match for the Devonport side.\nRound 1.\nRoope Rooster Round 1 Replay (Opai Asher Testimonial).\nThe round 1 replay also doubled as the main match in a testimonial day to Opai (Albert) Asher who had played rugby union and rugby league for New Zealand, as well as New Zealand Māori rugby league, Auckland, and represented the City Rovers from 1909 to 1907 in 63 matches. He later became the custodian of Carlaw Park but was retiring to return to his home area of Tauranga. He paraded in red and black (City's colours) and kicked off. There were also two curtain-raisers played between City and Glenora 3rd grade sides (won 13-6 by City), and the City and Pt Chevalier 4th grade teams (won 19-4 by Pt Chevalier). The main match saw City win 13–10. Ōtāhuhu lost Pattilo and Ralph Martin in the first half, meaning Seymour had to play fullback and D Harris, a forward, moved to the wing. Norm Johnson, another forward shifted to five eighth.\nRoope Rooster Round 2.\nWith his 7 points in Ponsonby's 19–13 loss to Mt Albert, Brian Nordgren passed Jack Hemi's point scoring record of 218 points which he achieved in 1941 through 206 points for Manukau, and 12 for Auckland. Nordgren moved to 227 points. Flags flew at half mast at Carlaw Park due to the death of Mr. G.J. Chapman, who was a life member of the Ellerslie club, and Lou Hemi who died in Wellington. In Richmond's match with Marist, 36 year old former international George Tittleton was concussed with a possible fractured jaw and was taken to Auckland Hospital.\nRoope Rooster Semi-Finals.\nNorth Shore were said to have fielded their best team of the season after being reinforced by Verdun Scott who had returned from the war. He had been selected for New Zealand for the aborted tour of England and France in 1939. In 1946 he would become the first and only player to also play test cricket for New Zealand when he debuted against Australia on March 29, 1946. Joining him in the side were other former New Zealand players Jack Smith, and Ivor Stirling. Smith converted 2 of their 3 tries and also kicked 2 penalties in their 17–12 win.\nRoope Rooster final.\nJack Smith kicked 5 goals in North Shore's 22–12 win. Roy Clark also scored 2 tries for the winners in a match described by chairman J.W. Watson as being “the best game seen at Carlaw Park for a long time”.\nStormont Shield final.\nNorth Shore claimed the champion of champions title for 1945 when they beat Ōtāhuhu in the Stormont Shield final. C.S Peterson, the representative forward turned out for North Shore after returning from the war effort. North Shore led at halftime 15-5 after playing with a strong wind, however Ōtāhuhu came back strongly with two tries including one to Jim Fogarty on fulltime. Unfortunately for the south Auckland team Colin Riley's conversion attempt which caused the crowd to gather near the posts missed. During the second half Joffre Johnson was sent off for Ōtāhuhu at a stage when they were getting on top. After winning the match each member of the North Shore side was presented with a medal by the family of William (Bill) Stormont whom the trophy was in honour of.\nPhelan Shield Semi Finals.\nReferee A Stevenson officiated in his debut first grade match in the Pt Chevalier game against Ponsonby.\nTop try scorers and point scorers.\nThe scoring includes Fox Memorial matches including the playoff type matches, the Roope Rooster and Phelan Shield competitions and also the Stormont Shield final. It does not include the exhibition matches that Ōtāhuhu played in the West Coast or the match between Ponsonby and Mt Albert at Cambridge on October 13.\nOther notable senior level matches.\nJimmy Chalmers Benefit Match.\nOn June 4 a benefit match was arranged for former Marist player James (Jimmy) Chalmers. He had played for their senior side from 1935 to 1940 before enlisting in the armed forces. He was seriously wounded in the Middle East and had his leg amputated at the hip. The match was played between a Town side made up of players from the Marist and City clubs and a Country side made up of players from Ōtāhuhu and Manukau. Robert Grotte made his first appearance for the year in the Town side.\nInter-Port Challenge Cup.\nOn September 26 the Auckland Watersiders played in an Inter-Port Challenge Cup match against the Wellington Watersiders at Carlaw Park. The Auckland side were the current holders and they retained the Cup with a 14-6 win which included the clinching try late in the match to representative player John Anderson. A curtain-raiser was played between another Auckland Waterside team and Glenora.\nŌtāhuhu tour of the West Coast.\nThe Ōtāhuhu senior side travelled as a party of 23 to the West Coast to play 2 matches against very strong opponents. Otahuhu was coached by Con Hall who was formerly of Greymouth. They were at full strength except that Ralph Martin replaced the injured Royce Speedy at full back. Ōtāhuhu arrived on Thursday, September 27 and departed on October 2. They were officially welcomed at the Trotting Pavilion on the evening of the 27th and an official dinner was held on the 30th following their second match. A welcome dance was held for them on the Saturday night also, at the Miners' Hall. They lost both of them to Blackball, the local champions, and then Runanga. After the match with Blackball their opponents travelled to Auckland as the majority of them were in the South Island side to play the North Island. Following their second match, against Runanga, the team was hosted by the West Coast Rugby League at the Club Hotel for a dinner.\nBlackball v Ōtāhuhu.\nThe Blackball side featured future New Zealand internationals Bill Mountford, Bob Aynsley, Charlie McBride, Ray Nuttall, Ken Mountford, and Ces Mountford who signed with Wigan two months later.\nPonsonby v Mount Albert (exhibition match in Cambridge).\nOn October 13 the Ponsonby and Mt Albert senior sides played an exhibition match at Victoria Square in Cambridge, Waikato. It was the first rugby league game played in Cambridge for 22 years. A crowd of 800 paid for admission to witness the match which was won by Ponsonby 40 to 28. Frank Delgrosso coached the Ponsonby side as he had done during the season and his son, Francis (also known as Frank) possibly made his debut for Ponsonby. \"K Hardrave\" was listed as coaching the Mt Albert side which was possibly Roy Hardgrave as there were several spelling errors in the article. Brian Nordgren scored a try and kicked 7 conversion and a penalty, while for Mt Albert, Basil Cranch converted 5 of their 6 tries. A local league committee had organised the match along with the two Auckland clubs and the Frankton club. Following the match the teams were entertained at the Oddfellows' Hall in Cambridge. The following day on Sunday the Auckland sides were taken to visit the Karapiro Hydro Works and then traveled to the Frankton Club. The match raised money for the \"Kiwi\" Flats fund and gathered £40-£50.\nLower grades.\nSenior B.\nNewton, North Shore, City, Pt Chevalier, Mt Albert, Marist, Manukau, North Shore, Ellerslie, Papakura, and Otahuhu.\n3rd Grade.\nWon by City Rovers.

Bernard Lowther played on the other wing and kicked 3 conversions before retiring injured and being replaced by Roy Nurse. The South Auckland side was missing L. Allen through injury and then O. Brookes, their star back was forced off through injury. Future New Zealand representative Albert Hambleton played at prop for South Auckland. N Dowling, who had played for Richmond in 1944 also turned out for the visiting side. In a curtain raiser the South Auckland 4th grade representative side beat Auckland 6 to 3.\nHuntly District v Auckland Māori.\nErnie Asher selected the Auckland Māori team. At the conclusion of the game at a social function life membership was conferred to Brownie Paki.\nAuckland Māori v Auckland Pākehā.\nA feature of the match was the goal kicking on each side. For the Māori team Silva kicked 5 goals, while Brian Nordgren did likewise for the Pākehā team. Nordgren also scored a try from halfway after Allan Wiles had made a “brilliant burst down the middle of the field” to create an overlap for his winger. The Māori team found themselves down by 15 points in the second half before a strong comeback made the game close following a try to Pita Ririnui with 10 minutes to go. Then with 5 minutes left Joe Murray came close to levelling the scores but the Pākehā defence hung on for the win.\nAuckland v Wellington.\nAuckland won comfortably and would have won by more but only 3 of their 12 tries were converted. There was a good deal of interest in the appearance of Jack Hemi, the great player who had represented New Zealand in 10 matches, New Zealand Māori (2), Auckland (2), Auckland Māori (12), and Manukau (103). His younger brother Lou played at full back for Wellington. They both lived in the Wairarapa but travelled to Wellington in the weekends to play for Randwick. As it stood they could do little to stem the flow of Auckland tries. There was surprise before the match when it was found out that Pita Ririnui had been dropped from the Auckland side after failing to attend training. He was replaced in the starting side by Abbie Graham. Les Clement and A Rogers had been unavailable due to injury. The Wellington side fielded Harvey Kreyl at lock, he would go on to represent New Zealand 7 years later in 1952.\nAuckland v West Coast (South Island).\nThe West Coast team was the first to play in Auckland since 1933. Auckland won a very hard-fought match in front of a large crowd of 13,000. During the second half Brian Nordgren and Jack Forrest were injured in a tackle. Despite protests St Johns said that neither player could carry on after both received head cuts. This meant both sides had to play on with 12 players. For Auckland Travers Hardwick moved from the forwards to play in the wing, while Ken Mountford did the same for the West Coast. After the match Nordgren and Forrest both went to Auckland Hospital to be treated. Earlier in the match B Lowther was injured and was replaced by Roy Nurse at halftime. During the following week the “local” (Auckland) replacement rule was clarified as typically players could not be replaced at halftime unless they were in the hands of St Johns or a doctor at the conclusion of the first half, which in this case Lowther was. This differed from the English rules where replacements at halftime were not allowed. The referee also needed to be notified that a replacement was happening which he was. However the opposing captain, Ces Mountford was not told as “everything was done in a rush”. It was also stated during the week that the gate receipts of £435 were a record since the outbreak of the war in 1939, and were a record for such a fixture.\nWellington v Auckland.\nBrian Nordgren had scored 9 tries in 3 games for Auckland already in the season and followed up with a remarkable 5 more in Auckland's easy win over Wellington. With the 7 conversions he kicked his personal tally was an extraordinary 29 points. His last try came in the second half when he “pounded past the Wellington defence for 75 yards for an unconverted try which brought the crowd to its feet”. Allan Wiles and Roy Nurse were originally chosen amongst the traveling reserves for Auckland but were unavailable and their places were taken by Jack Zane-Zaninovich (Mt Albert), and Gordon Prenter (Richmond). The match saw 2,239 tickets sold at the gate with gross takings of £143 with the Auckland share being £49. It was pointed out by Auckland treasurer that when the Wellington team played in Auckland the share for Wellington was £354.\nSouth Auckland (Waikato) v Auckland.\nBrian Nordgren was once again in scoring form, crossing for 3 tries and kicking 3 conversions and a penalty in Auckland's 26–13 win. In a surprise selection Jack Smith was selected in the reserves for Auckland over Warwick Clarke at fullback. He had only recently returned from the war and had only played 2 games. Allan Wiles collided with another player in the second half and went off to get stitches. Reserve Rex Cunningham played at five eighth and scored a try for Auckland. As replacements were not allowed during the second half it is possible that he started the match in the halves ahead of H Grady as the New Zealand Herald stated that Auckland played a man short for most of the second half.\nNorth Island v South Island (inter-island match).\n The South Island team featured 2 Wellington players (F Moses and Hector Mallinder) for the first time in its history, rendering it a South Island team in name only. G Moyes, chosen at lock from Waikato was unavailable as he was feeling unwell so his place was taken by Fred James of the City side and he played well scoring 2 tries. Veteran Arthur Kay played for the North Island in the centre position. He was in his 13th season of senior rugby league having debuted for Ponsonby in 1933. The crowd was estimated at between 15 and 20,000 which was the largest seen at the ground for many years.\nGames played and scoring.\nAuckland Māori.\nThere were patchy newspaper reports of the team named to play Huntly District and not all players were mentioned in reports so the list is incomplete.\nNorth Island.\nOf the thirteen players selected for the North Island, 11 of them were from Auckland. \nAnnual General Meetings and Club News.\nAuckland Junior Management Committee.\nThe Junior Control Board held their first meeting at the ARL League Rooms on Tuesday, March 15 at 8pm.

        "text": "South Carolina has a passing relationship with ice hockey. With professional hockey not being introduced until 1993 and very little junior system framework to speak of, South Carolina is an example of the overall dearth of ice hockey in the deep south.\nHistory.\nDue to South Carolina location in the American sun belt as well as its low overall population and the lack of any major media market (Charleston is the largest city with approximately 150,000 people in 2022), South Carolina was largely ignored by the ice hockey community for decades. The state's first professional team arrived in 1993 when the South Carolina Stingrays franchise was founded in North Charleston. The team was an instant success with the fans, drawing more than 9,000 fans on average for its inaugural season. While the team did not sustain those numbers the franchise was given the opportunity to jump from the ECHL (AA hockey) to the AHL (AAA hockey) in 1995. Management eventually declined the offer, believing it better to keep its operating costs and ticket prices low so that their fan base could still attend games.\nIn the succeeding years, the Stingrays win three Kelly Cups and have been one of the ECHL's most success full teams. As the flagship franchise for the state, the Stingrays have inspired several other attempts at professional hockey in the state but few have succeeded. The Pee Dee Pride (1997), Greenville Grrrowl (1998) and Columbia Inferno (2001) all attempted to expand the reach of ice hockey in the state but none were able to reach their 10-year anniversary. Greenville received its second franchise when the Johnstown Chiefs relocated in 2010 and became the Road Warriors. Though the team underwent a second name change to become the 'Swamp Rabbits', the franchise established itself and signed an affiliation deam with the Los Angeles Kings in 2022.\nNo college in South Carolina has ever fielded a varsity ice hockey team, nor does the state have any official junior program. Youth ice hockey is conducted at local levels within the bounds of the Southeastern District of USA Hockey.\nTeams.\nTimeline.\n \nPlayers.\nNo ice hockey player raised in South Carolina has yet to distinguish themselves. Only one player born in the state, Ryan Hartman, has achieved a level of notability but he was raised in Illinois. Only 3,008 players were registered with USA Hockey in 2023, accounting for just 0.053% of the state's population. By percentage, South Carolina ranks 42nd in the nation terms of engagement, well in line with many other southern states."

Hopes for a good winter appeared to be dashed when the team was forced to use the Mohawk Golf Club's rink for practices because theirs was still out of commission in early January. Sure enough, the first two home games of the season were cancelled and the team opening with a delayed match at Rensselaer. Once they hit the ice, Union shot out of the gate and scored three goals in the first. Hyland finished off his hat-trick in the third but the team was unable to hold their lead and saw RIT answer every score. Bob Beale nearly netted the game winner in the waning moments of the match but a spectacular save kept the game tied. Due to fading light, no overtime was played and the two settled for a draw. Weather forced the postponement of the rematch with RPI and the team's next game required them to travel to Williams. The Garnet fought hard despite their lack of practice time but they were unable to overcome the early 2-goal lead by the Ephs. Hyland recorded the only goal for the Dutchmen.\nDuring the exam break, he team finally got the cold weather needed for a home game and managed to meet Rensselaer for a rematch. Unfortunately, the absence of Bob Beale hampered the team's offensive ability while a broken skate for Jack Beale, his brother, kept an apt replacement out of the lineup for the first half. In that period, the team's defense was unable to stop the Engineers' offense and RPI rung up 3 goals in the first period. Rensselaer was then able to play defense for the rest of the match and skate away with a victory over Union. One bright spot was the appearance of Foster in goal for the Garnet. While the game started rough, he rounded into form as the match progressed and played a solid game in his first outing.\nUnfortunately, the weather didn't hold and the team was unable to get any on-ice practice heading into their game with Hamilton. Despite their handicap, the Garnet kept he game close and were tied with the Continentals entering the third. In the final period the lack of conditioning proved fatal and the Dutchmen surrendered 3 goals for the third consecutive loss. A few days later, Union ended its season with a 4–7 loss to Cornell with poor weather ruining what could have been a solid season.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The 2023–24 Niagara Purple Eagles men's ice hockey season was the 28th season of play for the program, the 26th at the Division I level and the 14th in Atlantic Hockey. The Purple Eagles represented Niagara University, played their homes games at the Dwyer Arena and were coached by Jason Lammers in his 7th season.\nSeason.\nNiagara lost more than half of its players in the offseason but the biggest void was in goal. In losing their starter and likely replacement, the team brought in graduate transfer Jarrett Fiske to compete with Ryan Ouellette for the starting role. Fiske had a rather poor start to the season, surrendering 5 goals in 40 minutes to Omaha. Ouellette then became the starter for about a month but could not establish himself in the position. Fiske regain the starting job in early November and performed much better the second time around. He remained the primary netminder for the remainder of the year with Ouellette and Mitchell Day filling in now and again.\nThe offense, too, was in need of new leadership and got a boon with freshman forwards Tyler Wallace and Jack Richard. The two newcomers combined with upperclassmen Jay Ahearn and Carter Randklev to lead the offense and keep the team competitive on most nights.\nAfter an up-and-down opening to the year, Niagara went through a very poor stretch in December and January, going 1–6 and putting themselves behind the 8-ball. They were able to arrest their slide with a win over RIT, the best team in the conference, and went 8–3–2 down the stretch. The improved play didn't quite get the team a bye into the quarterfinal round but it did afford them with home ice in the opening round of the playoffs.\nNiagara opened its postseason with a fairly easy win over Army despite Richard being ejected for slew-footing in the first period. The major penalty resulted in the only goal for Army but otherwise didn't affect the outcome of the game. Niagara then faced Sacred Heart in the quarterfinals and found a opponent in the midst of a losing skid. The Eagles took full advantage and flew through the Pioneers' defense. Niagara scored 11 goals in two games, give Fiske all the goal support he needed for a sweep. Randklev was particularly outstanding, recording 6 points in the two games.\nIn the semifinals, Niagara found itself opposite RIT, who had lost the season series to the Purple Eagles despite finishing first in the standings. Niagara was hoping for more of the same but the Tigers did not take the underdogs lightly and kept to their defensive structure. Niagara piled on the shots in the opening game, recording 39 in regulation, but were only able to get one into the RIT cage, and even then they needed an extra attacker. The second saw RIT jump out to a 3–0 lead in the first period and Niagara had no answer. The Eagles were able to cut into the advantage in the final frame but it was too little too late and Niagara ended its season with a pair of losses.\nDue to a snowstorm, the game against Mercyhurst scheduled on January 13 was postponed to a later date.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \nRankings.\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "title": "2023–24 RIT Tigers men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 2023–24 RIT Tigers men's ice hockey season was the 60th season of play for the program, the 19th at the Division I level and the 18th in Atlantic Hockey. The Tigers represented the Rochester Institute of Technology, played their home games at the Gene Polisseni Center and were coached by Wayne Wilson in his 25th season. Forward Caleb Moretz was named team captain entering the season.\nSeason.\nAfter a disappointing loss to end the previous season, the vast majority of RIT's players returned. The only major loss to the lineup was Kobe Walker, who had finished fifth in scoring, but the Tigers brought in several new recruits to shore up the offense. While the outlook appeared good for the team, putting their plans into practice was another matter entirely. The Tigers started the season at St. Lawrence and they were doomed by an issue that had plagued them all of the previous season: taking too many penalties. RIT took six minor penalties in their opening game and though they only allowed one goal during the disadvantages, that marker was the game-winner in a 1-goal game. Additionally, the team was unable to get to their offense while on the penalty kill and they spent much of the waning moments of the match defending rather than trying to get a tying goal.\nAfter that inauspicious start, the team hosted Notre Dame at the Blue Cross Arena for their homecoming game. In front of a sellout crowd of over 10,000, RIT played a staunch defensive game and shutout the Irish. While the team couldn't help itself and took 27 minutes in penalties, they were able to hold off a lackluster power play and earn a very important win for the team's postseason hopes. Tommy Scarfone was the hero of the match, stopping all 36 shots that were sent his way. After their first win, the team began its conference schedule early and quickly jumped to the top of the Atlantic Hockey standings. Scarfone continued to play well in goal and was named the national goaltender of the month for October by the Hockey Commissioners Association. He was not the only reason for the Tigers' success, however, as the team had raised its already potent offense to another level. While several of last year's point leaders got back into the swing of things swiftly, the team received a boots from the return of Elijah Gonsalves after he was forced to sit out two weeks with a lower body injury. The team was also beginning to see two of its new arrivals contribute offensively with Matthew Wilde and Tyler Fukakusa getting up to speed by Thanksgiving.\nDuring the holiday, RIT was given an unexpected opportunity when their opponent, New Hampshire arrived in town with the #12 ranking. Not only was it a chance to prove their mettle against a good team but both games were carried by NESN and could help to raise the visibility of the program. The first match was a bit of a mixed bag for the Tigers, with penalties being called left and right but the RIT power play proved to be the difference. The home team went 3 for 7 on the man-advantage, including twice on a 5-minute major, to win the match. The second saw fewer penalties but just as many minutes with both sides being given a match penalty in the game. This time it was RIT's turn to suffer for their infractions and New Hampshire scored twice on their major advantage. The Tigers were still able to push the game into overtime after tying the game with 5 seconds to play but they were unable to stop the Wildcats from winning the game in overtime. The split series gave the Tigers a huge boost to their rankings and saw them just up into the top third of the PairWise. Two weeks later, with a little help from teams ahead of them losing, RIT entered the winter break in the top 16 and in line for a potential at large bid, a rarity for Atlantic Hockey.\nAfter Christmas the team reconvened for the Ledyard Bank Classic and were presented with yet another tough test. Their semifinal opponent was #8 Maine and even a close loss to the Black Bears could help the Tigers' cause. Unfortunately, penalties torpedoed the team's chances and three infractions in the second (one being a match penalty for grabbing a face mask) led to total domination by Maine in the second half. While RIT didn't surrender a power play marker, the Black Bears outshot the Tigers 30 to 7 in the final 40 minutes. The team recovered to win the consolation game, albeit with seven more penalties, but weren't punished too harshly in the national rankings, falling just one spot. After a solid weekend against a pair of ECAC Hockey teams, RIT finished its non-conference slate with a winning record. Though they had beaten New Hampshire, that only countered the opening loss to St. Lawrence and gave the Tigers effective a neutral mark against the other leagues. If RIT hoped to remain in the top-15 and be in line for an at-large bid by the end of the season they could not afford many losses in the second half of their season. Unfortunately, that's exactly what happened when they resumed conference play.\nRIT's offense faltered a bit in early January and scored 4 goals over a 3-game span. Despite firing 42 shots against Niagara the team lost 1–3. Due to a snowstorm, the next game against Canisius was postponed for three days. When the team got onto the ice they continued their recent barrage, getting 46 shots on goal but still fell in overtime. The back-to-back losses dropped the team into the low-20s and, with no games against good teams remaining, the Tigers had almost no chance to recover their former position. Even after going undefeated over the next three weeks, RIT could only climb up one spot in the rankings. When the Tigers split successive weekends in the middle of February, it made it all but impossible for the team to get an at large bid and they found themselves in the same position that they were in 2023.\nWhen the regular season ended, RIT was clearly the best team in their conference. Not only had the Tigers won the DeGregorio Trophy by 8 points but they also possessed the #1 offense and #3 defense in Atlantic Hockey. Six of the top thirteen scorers were on the Tigers and they were the only conference member in the national polls. However, because their strength of schedule was far below other teams vying for the NCAA tournament, RIT could only reach the national postseason by winning their conference championship. As part of their reward for winning the regular season title, RIT received a bye into the quarterfinal round. The other benefit was playing the lowest available seed when the did begin their postseason and, by a twist of fate, the Tigers opened with a home stand against last-place Robert Morris. The Colonials proved to be no match for RIT and the home team easily swept the RMU off the ice. The next weekend brought another underdog to Rochester and, though they received a tougher challenge from Niagara, RIT was able to complete a second sweep thanks in large part to their penalty kill and goaltender. In the championship match, only American International stood in the Tiger's way and the two fought a tight-checking game. After exchanging leads in the first, The second period began with both tied at two goals apiece. Wilde swiftly scored his 18th of the season on the power play and the Tigers then had to rely on the heroics of Scarfone to carry them the rest of the way. RIT was called for three minor penalties afterwards but the defense held and the team retained their 1-goal lead for the final 38 minutes. As the final buzzer was approaching, AIC pulled their goaltender and the Tigers popped in two empty-net markers to seal the game and send them back to the national tournament for the first time in eight years.\nWhen the NCAA field was announced, RIT found itself in an unusual position for an Atlantic Hockey team and they were not set against the #1 overall seed. However, despite this the Tigers still faced an daunting task as they were placed opposite the #2 team in the nation, Boston University. RIT was sent to the western regional, held in Sioux Falls, South Dakota and played in front of a not-quite hostile crowd. When play began the Tigers were skating fast and matched the speed of the Terriers. They ended up getting the lions share of chances in the first 10 minutes but, unfortunately, none of their shots found the target. In the back half of the opening period, RIT witnessed the talent of BU and they suddenly found themselves down by a pair. Elijah Gonsalves managed to cut the lead in half with a power play marker before the end of the period but the Tigers still had to find a way to stop the Terrier's attack. Boston University regain the 2-goal edge in the second and it took seemingly everything the Tigers had to match the goal seven minutes later. Conversely, the Terriers were playing loose and in less than two minutes they got their third 2-goal lead of the match. A further goal from BU at the start of the third made RIT's chances dwindle further and seemed to take the urgency out of their attack. To that point the Tigers had played well in the game but they just did not have the horses to match Boston University who sported 14 NHL draft picks and likely #1 selection in the upcoming draft. After surrendering an empty net goal in the later stages of the period, Cody Laskosky was able to score the final goal of the season for the Tigers but that didn't affect the outcome.\nRIT had put together one of the best seasons the team had seen, falling one shy of the program record with 27 wins while finishing as the #6 offense in the country with 3.9 goals per game.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \nRankings.\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "text": "The 2023–24 Yale Bulldogs Men's ice hockey season was the 128th season of play for the program and the 62nd in ECAC Hockey. The Bulldogs represented Yale University, played their home games at the Ingalls Rink and were coached by Keith Allain in his 17th season.\nSeason.\nThough Yale began the season with a win, the team had a rather poor start by losing eight of the next nine games. The two main causes for the defeats was a subpar goaltending performance from returning starter Nathan Reid and an almost total lack of offense. In the first five weeks of their season, Yale was limited to less than 2 goals in more than half of their games and had only managed to get 30 shots on goal in one contest. The team wasn't able to get on track until mid-December when both the offense and defense began improving. After struggling through his first few starts, Jack Stark grew accustomed to the college game and the rest of the team responded in kind.\nAfter returning form the winter break, the offense came to life and won three games in a row to put the Bulldogs right in the middle of the ECAC standings. Unfortunately, scoring remained inconsistent and the team lost the next four games to put them back near the bottom of the conference. A brief at the start of February put the Elis into contention for a home stand in the postseason but Yale went winless in its final five games and sentenced the team to travelling for the playoff matches.\nIn the middle of another cold spell for their offense, Yale met St. Lawrence for a First Round matchup. While the Elis had no trouble getting the puck on net, they were faced with a stellar performance from the Saints' netminder. Yale scored twice but Stark was unable to match his counterpart and the Elis fell 2–4 to end their season.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 ! style=\"; | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \nRankings.\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "text": "The 1921–22 Union Skating Dutchmen men's ice hockey season was the 9th season of play for the program. The Skating Dutchmen represented Union College and were coached by Ambrose Clark in his 2nd season.\nSeason.\nAfter suspending the program last year, the school's athletic board approved the return of the ice hockey program as a minor sport in mid-January. The late start meant that it would be nearly impossible for the team to schedule any games against intercollegiate opponents. However, in order to help the team get onto the ice, Union agreed to participate in the city's hockey league. Unfortunately, the weather didn't help conditions at the open-air Central Park Rink and the team's first game with Schenectady High School had to be cancelled.\nThe scant number of player who tried out for the team got as much practice in as they could on the poor ice and finally got to play their first match in mid-February. On the Mohawk Golf Club's Rink, Union played a decent game against the high schoolers, however, their lineup had a fatal flaw. Abrahamson, the team's netminder, had never played goal previously and was only used because there were no other options. He tried his best but Abrahamson allowed four goals on long shots, one more than the Dutchmen were able to score. Team captain Rod Davis called out for more students to try out for the team and the Dutchmen saw their chances buoyed by the addition of Jimmie La Pan and Don Dold.\nThe two new arrivals couldn't have come at a better time as the team was preparing to play four games in as many days. While the first match with Palumet was postponed, the second saw the team record its first win of the year when they downed the local golf club. Dold and defense continued to play strong in the succeeding two games, however, the offense dried up and the Garnet were shutout in back-to-back matches. The next week the team was supposed to play a doubleheader but both matched were delayed due to poor ice conditions. A hasty rearrangement of the schedule set Union against the Palumet Athletic Club and the Dutchmen played their fastest game of the season. David was moved up to right wing and helped Union's scoring return. The team notched 4 goals while Dold blanked the amateurs to give Union its second win of the season.\nThe final game of the year was a rematch with the High School and Union was eager to finish the year with a win. Clark replaced Dolan on the wing but that didn't stop the Dutchmen from being able to score. Union played a solid game but the high schoolers wouldn't go away. The teenagers overcame a Union lead in the third to force overtime and the Dutchmen couldn't answer their opponent's marker in the extra session.\nDick Meyer served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

The Wolfpack were led by seventh-year head coach Kevin Keatts and played their home games at PNC Arena in Raleigh, North Carolina as members of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). \nThe Wolfpack finished the regular season on an uninspiring four-game losing streak, consequently posting a regular season record of 17–14 (9–11 in conference play) and slumping to the ACC tournament as the 10th seed. They then went on a miraculous run in the ACC tournament, winning five games in the span of five days (including a victory over ACC regular season champion and rival North Carolina) to win their first ACC tournament since 1987. They became the first team to win their conference tournament with five wins in five days since the 2010–11 Connecticut Huskies (of the Big East) and the second team overall to do it since the NCAA tournament began in 1939. This is the first time the Wolfpack made the NCAA tournament in consecutive years since they made the 2014 and 2015 tournament. \nEarning an #11 seed in the South region of the NCAA tournament, they continued their Cinderella run from the ACC tournament by defeating #6 Texas Tech in the first round, #14 Oakland in overtime in the second round, #2 Marquette in the Sweet Sixteen, and their ACC rivals #4 Duke in the Elite Eight. The Wolfpack made their first Final Four appearance since 1983 as a result, having won nine straight games since the end of the regular season. They became the sixth #11 seed to reach the Final Four and the first since UCLA in 2021. Their miraculous run came to an end with a Final Four loss to Purdue, closing their season with a 26–15 record.\nPrevious season.\nThe Wolfpack finished the 2022–23 season 23–11, 12–8 in ACC play to finish in sixth place. They defeated Virginia Tech before losing to Clemson in the ACC tournament. They received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament as the No. 11 seed in the South region.

        "text": "The 1922–23 Boston University Terriers men's ice hockey season was the 3rd season of play for the program. The Terriers were coached by John O’Hare in his first season.\nSeason.\nAfter two abortive attempts to start the program, Boston University was finally able to secure an arrangement to use the Boston Arena as its home venue. Not only did this give the program a home rink for the first time but it also allowed the Terriers to schedule more than a handful of games. The school brought in John O’Hare to head the program but, with no experienced players on the roster, the team had limited chances for wins.\nBU opened the season with a pair of games in December against local colleges. The opening match, against MIT served as a poor omen for the Terriers as BU managed to score 4 goals, more than they had in their earlier two seasons combined, but allowed 7 in the loss. Though it was an unfortunate result, it was far better than the team had fared in either of their matches in 1920. Less than a week later, the team was set against three-time defending intercollegiate champions, Harvard. The Crimson scored twice in the first period, however, the BU defense tightened afterwards and didn't allow the mighty Harvard squad another goal. The surprising performance was not enough to give the Terriers a chance to win, however, as the Crimson defense was its typically impenetrable self.\nIt was nearly a month before the team's next game and the Terriers did what they could to work on the issues that had been revealed in the first two games. The time off appeared to work wonders for the team as they dominated a Massachusetts Agricultural team upon their return. Kontoff and Sterling were stellar on defense, breaking up many an attack from the Aggies. Almer scored the first hat-trick in program history to lead the team to its first ever win. The following Week the team got its chance for revenge against MIT. While the defense remained in fine form, The offense could only summon up a single goal. With the score even at the end of regulation, two 5-minute overtime periods were agreed to but, unfortunately, it was MIT who got the final marker.\nA week or so after the near miss, BU met Boston College at the Arena. The Eagles were in the middle of a championship run and were expected to roll over the Terriers, however, BU had other ideas. Beauchemin played probably his best game of the season, repeatedly preventing BC from scoring what looked to be a sure goal and kept his team in the contest. Provost opened the scoring in the second, and the defense then tried to hold on to its 1-goal lead until the end of the match. The Eagles did eventually even the score but overtime was needed to settle the score. In the first of two 5-minute overtime periods, Almer gave BU its second lead of the game but the withering attack from Boston College tied the game for a second time. After the first two extra sessions, a third sudden death period was instituted. BU kept to its game, holding off the Eagles for about 15 minutes, but the both teams were looking increasingly exhausted as time went on. Eventually a tired Kontoff lost the puck to Len Morrissey who skated up the ice and wired a shot past Beauchemin for the winning goal. About two weeks later the two had a rematch and BC was not going to give the Terriers a second chance at an upset. The Eagles pumped 7 goals into the BU cage and put to rest any pretensions from the scarlet skaters.\nA day after their second loss to Boston College, BU was in New Haven for its first road game and took on a local semi-pro outfit. Despite being vastly over-matched in terms of age, experience and size, the Terriers played well and only surrendered 4 goals to the New Haven Bears. After that, the team returned home and trained for over two weeks before hitting the road for their final game of the season. BU met Bates at the Winter Carnival in Auburn and showed out with a 6–0 win. Kontoff and Almer each scored a pair to end BU's first full season on a high note.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "title": "IMG Grading for the British Rugby Football League",
        "text": "IMG Grading for the Rugby Football League is a set of proposals set out in 2022 by the British Rugby Football League's new strategic partner IMG, in which all clubs playing in the professional levels of the British rugby league system will be graded, with their rank determining which division each club will play. The proposals were accepted by a majority vote of British rugby league stakeholders in 2023 with implementation starting in the 2024 season.\nThe grading in the new system will see:\nGrades will be reassessed annually.\nThis will be the second attempt to introduce a \"Super League licence\", with the first being introduced in 2009 and scrapped in 2014 after two cycles.\nVoting.\nVoting for this proposal occurred on 19 April 2023. All 35 British RFL clubs of the 2023 season received a vote, with Super League clubs' votes being more heavily weighted. A further seven votes were given to representatives from the community game in tiers 4 and 5 of the British rugby league system. With an overall majority needed to pass, along with a majority in each voting block (Super League, Championship/League One, and Community Game). The proposal passed 86% to 14%.\nOpposition.\nChampionship sides Barrow, Batley, Featherstone Rovers, and Keighley, and League One sides Hunslet, Dewsbury, and West Wales voted against the proposals, Whilst Salford and Whitehaven abstained from the vote.\nKeighley, who had been extremely vocal in their opposition of the proposal since the start, and the only club who voted against the plans even being discussed, released a statement accusing IMG of \"blinding\" rugby league with \"nice presentation[s] and big words\", citing that their proposals \"will be the death of Championship, League One, and other heartland clubs\" and that the proposal was \"underfunded\" and had zero marketing plans, in addition to accusing IMG of \"masquerad[ing] on false promises\" and \"lies\".\nDespite voting in favour of grading, London Broncos owner David Hughes released a statement opposing the grading system in January 2024. He cited that the inclusion of grading had \"[condemned the] club to relegation before a ball has even been kicked\" and as a result removed the \"jeopardy and drama\" from the sport. Hughes was particularly agreved with the points the club gained for catchment, being \"the lowest possible\", despite being the only professional team in the South East. He also affirmed that \"promotion and relegation should be a staple of all sports\".\nCriteria.\nEach club will be awarded a maximum of 20 points across five categories:\n15 points is needed for Grade A status, while 7.5 is needed for Grade B.\nUnknowns.\nIMG main aim is to have the Super League made entirely of Grade A clubs and by grading clubs it highlights areas they are to improve on. Having expressed plans to expand Super League it is possible that if and when more than 12 clubs were Graded A then the league would expand to keep these clubs out of the Championship as Grade A clubs are exempt from relegation. Following a statement where the IMG claimed that the chances of the Championship Grand Final winners being denied promotion were \"very remote\", doubts were shed over how the system would work, as initially it was understood that the remaining Super League places would be taken up by the highest ranked Grade B clubs, however this statement suggested that so long as the Championship winner and bottom placed Super League club were both Grade B promotion and relegation would occur as normal. Neither IMG nor the RFL have clarified either of these issues.\nGrades.\nAlthough the system will not determine clubs' places in leagues until after the 2024 season, an indicative grading was released after the 2023 season. Seven Super League clubs were awarded an 'A' grade, 17 clubs in the system received a 'B' grade, and 11 received a 'C' grade. London Skolars withdrew from League One after the 2023 season and did not receive a grade, while Newcastle Thunder, who had also announced a likely withdrawal after being relegated to League One but were aiming to keep a place in the league, still received a grade.\nCriticism.\nTelegraph &amp; Argus wrote an article applauding the system in principle but claimed it would be financially unfeasible to make the improvements for any clubs outside the 2024 top 14."

        "text": "The 1921–22 Dartmouth Indians men's ice hockey season was the 16th season of play for the program. The Indians were coached by Chippy Gaw in his 1st season.\nSeason.\nDartmouth had every intention of making 1922 one of the best seasons yet for the program, unfortunately, the weather would no cooperate. After opening with two solid victories in the first half of January, the team had to cancel every game over a 3-week period due to a complete lack of ice. By the time the Indians were finally able to get back on the ice, the state of the team was a mystery. To the Green's benefit, their opponent, Yale, was in the midst of an up-and-down season and weren't able to press Dartmouth as they did in years past. The Indian's offense had a bit of trouble getting to their game but the defense was sound. No scoring occurred in the first two periods and the tie was broken by Yale at the start of the third. It onto took Foster a few minutes to get the Greens their first goal and that was soon followed by a second from Osborne. The rapid succession of goals ended abruptly and the defenses took over for the remainder of the match. The win kept Dartmouth's championship hopes alive despite their dearth of games played.\nThe Indians continued their successful road trip with a win at Army before heading home. By then the weather in Hanover had cooled enough for their rink to be usable and the team welcomed Columbia for the first home game in nearly a month. 1,500 people were in attendance to see the Indian team that might finally deliver an ice hockey championship at the winter carnival. Unfortunately, the game was marred by heavy snowfall that caused drifts to build up along the ice. The game was slowed due to the precipitation and wind but that didn't stop either team from trying their best. The lions nearly got the opening goal after 9 minutes but the score was disallowed due to the Dartmouth net being knocked out of place. The pace slowed further in the second period and with the storm refusing to let up, The referee called a halt to play at the 9-minute mark. Though the tie was hardly a desired outcome from either side, the result and its necessity meant that Dartmouth still had a chance for a title as they entered their final game of the year with 2-time defending champion, Harvard.\nIn a game that would likely decide the championship (Harvard was also undefeated in intercollegiate play), Dartmouth found itself outmatched by a faster Crimson sextet. The Greens weren't able to contend with the constant pressure from the Harvard offense and were routinely forced to pull back to defend their cage. Though the Indians managed to break up many a passing play, three shouts found their way behind Tobin which more than doubled his goals against for the season. The offense, on the other hand, was at a total loss on how to break through the stout Harvard defense. Hall tried time and again to skate into the Crimson's end but he was quickly set upon by defenders. Even when he tried to pass the puck there always seemed to be a Harvard stick in the way. Dartmouth's offense could find no traction in the game and the team couldn't stop the Crimson from ending their dreams of a championship.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n&lt;br&gt;"

On his debut against Scotland, he fumbled a likely try in the last play of the game which would have given Wales a kick to win. He also faced off with Ireland and France, before Holmes returned for the final fixture.\nIn the 1990s, Douglas played for English clubs Northampton and Coventry\nDouglas was still competing in first-class rugby into his 40s with his local club Lampeter Town. He comes from the village of Cwmann near Lampeter and runs an abattoir business there with his brothers"

The aim of Thoda is for two opposing teams to shoot arrows at the legs of the other team (which are wrapped in thick cloth); Thoda competitions take place in Himachal Pradesh annually.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Thoda\" refers to the round block of wood that is fixed ahead of the arrow to blunt it.\nRules.\nThe two teams comprise 500 participants each, most of whom are dancers. The teams stand 10 metres apart, and attempt to shoot each other below the knee. Points are deducted for shooting an opponent above the knee."

In order to prevent one of the biggest problems from reoccurring, the team scheduled most of their games to be on the road as Occom Pond could not be counted on for consistent ice. Leon Tuck returned as coach after a year's absence and found a roster waiting for him that was already well experienced. While the Indians lost a few players to graduation, they got a boost from the return of Lloyd Neidlinger, who had been the starting goaltender in '21. The biggest problem was the ineligibility of Colder and Hall who would not be able to return to the team until at least February.\nThe team opened the season against Columbia at Lake Placid. The Greens found themselves in a tough fight at times but overall they proved that they were the better team. Dartmouth swept the three-game series and then took a week break over Christmas. The players then travelled to Buffalo for a two-game series with the Nichols Hockey Club. The Green found the semi-pros to be a stronger opponent than Columbia but were still able to keep their record spotless.\nA few weeks later, the team was back on the road to New York for a pair of matches. After a relatively easy win over Hamilton, the Indians were stunned by the pushback they received from Cornell. Despite this being the Big Red's first game of the season, the typically weak squad fought hard against the undefeated greens. Goals from Sheehy and Foster were swiftly matched by the Cornell and regulation ended in a tie. Team captain Osborne made sure that Dartmouth would not lose its perfect record to the Reds with the first goal in overtime. Sheehy's second a few minutes later made sure that Dartmouth would return home with the record unblemished.\nThe team's narrow escape apparently did nothing to prepare them for their next match the following week because the Indians found themselves down by 4 goals midway through the second period. Dartmouth got off to a poor start in the match, allowing 3 goals to Williams in the first minutes of the game. Foster cut into the lead before the end of the period but that still left the Greens down by a pair. The sluggish play continued in the middle period and two more goals from the Purple made the game's result almost inevitable. However, the 5th goal from Williams appeared to light a fire under the team and Dartmouth began to resemble the dominant team that warranted their record. Sheehy, Lyon and Osborne all tallied before the end of the second to shrink the deficit to 1. Both defenses tightened in the third period and only one goal was scored. Fortunately for Dartmouth, it was Sheehy's second goal of the game and the two would need overtime to settle matters. Two 5-minute overtimes resulted in no further scoring so a third, sudden death period of 15 minutes (maximum) was adopted. About halfway through the third extra period, Foster fired the puck from center ice which then deflected off of Osborne's shoulder into the net, giving Dartmouth one of the most dramatic victories in its history.\nDartmouth had a few week off before the next game in which to relax and they returned against Massachusetts Agricultural with a more determined game. Playing at home for the first time, the team was able to demonstrate that they were worth of their undefeated record. The Aggies got on the scoresheet first but then Dartmouth's superior experience and training led them to take over for the rest of the game. Four different players joined in to score 5 goals for the Indians. The team was in such control that coach Tuck was able to let Ed Learnard get a turn in goal. With 9 wins already under its belt, Dartmouth headed south for the big showdown with Yale. Though the Elis were already out of the running for an intercollegiate title, they were still a dangerous team. Luckily, both Colder and Hall were now able to play for the Indians once more and the two were needed against a very fast Bulldog sextet. Yale opened the scoring early but, despite furious attempts by both teams, neither was able to score in the next 20 minutes. Sheehy finally tied the score in the second and, after the Elis regained the lead, Lyons potted two more before the period was over to give his team a 1-goal edge. The third saw Yale put all of their skaters on the offense but the Greens held and skated away with a 3–2 victory.\nOn the way back to Hanover, Dartmouth made a stop in New York to face Army. Still jubilant over their 10th win of the season, the Indians didn't take the Cadets seriously as their opponents had lost 4 out of their last 5 games. That hubris came back to haunt the Greens as Army played possibly the finest defensive game in its history and shutout Dartmouth. The lone goal from the Cadets was all they needed to end the Indians' perfect season and put in doubt their intercollegiate title. Because Dartmouth still had two of the other teams vying for a championship left on its schedule the team would be able to overcome the single loss but Dartmouth could not afford a second defeat.\nThe second and final home game of the year came against MIT. Just like the first, the Indians were no match for their opponent and Dartmouth was able to set a new program record with its 11th win of the year. After a week off to catch their breath, the team returned with a match against St. Paul's School. Despite being one of the top prep teams in the country, the teenagers were hopelessly outmatched by Dartmouth and gave the Indians their biggest win on the season. A few days later, Dartmouth headed south for the first of two games that would conceivably decide the championship. First up was Harvard and the three-time defending intercollegiate champions were loath to give up their crown. The two juggernauts fought a defensive battle with Harvard platooning wave after wave of fresh troops against Dartmouth to overwhelm the visitors. Dartmouth absorbed the attack and then countered with a single goal. Neidlinger and the defense made sure that lone tally held up and Dartmouth exorcised the Crimson demon, giving the Greens their first win over Harvard since 1915.\nAt 13–1, Dartmouth only had Princeton left on its schedule. Though the Tigers were having a bit of a renaissance season, they had lost twice to Harvard in the interim and were no longer in competition for the intercollegiate title. The only thing that Princeton could do in their final match was ruin Dartmouth's chances for the Indians' first title. Similar to the Harvard game, the two teams began with a defensive struggle that was vitally important for Dartmouth as Neidlinger was unavailable for the match and Learnard replaced him as the starting netminder. Dartmouth played a fairly rough game and was whistled for several penalties in the first two periods, however, rather than cost the Indians, the aggressive style put Princeton on the defensive and enabled Dartmouth to get a lead. The Greens did what they could to make Perry's goal early in the second stand up like that had against Harvard. Unfortunately, Princeton's offense fought back in the third. Less than a minute into the final frame, the score was tied and that caused Dartmouth to cease its overly-physical play. With the extra space needed, the Princeton forwards scored twice in the second half of the period and then played a 5-man defense over the last few minutes. Dartmouth was caught off-guard by the sudden turn of evens and the Indians were unable to mount a comeback.\nThe loss to Princeton was akin to a torpedo in the side of Dartmouth's championship hopes. While the Indians still had wins over Harvard and Yale, they did not have a match with the other team vying for the title: Boston College. BC had an undefeated record against intercollegiate opponents but they had only played 5 games and had not faced any of the ivies during the season. Unfortunately for Dartmouth, the two did have several opponents in common. Both had defeated the Nichols Hockey Club twice; both had shut out wins over MIT; both had sizable road victories at Hamilton. However, while Dartmouth had lost to Army, BC had smashed the Cadets 9–1 and finished the year with one loss to a western semi-pro team. In spite of the otherwise glorious season, Dartmouth would have to settle for second place once more.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n&lt;br&gt;"

A total of 15 divers from nine countries took part. \nQualification.\nA total of up to 80 divers (40 per gender) across all events qualified to compete. A nation may enter a maximum of 10 divers (if entering teams in synchronized diving) or 6 athletes (if not entering teams in synchronized diving), with the exception of the winners of the 2021 Junior Pan American Games, provided that these athletes participate only in the event in which they qualified in Cali. The host nation (Chile) automatically qualified a full team of 10 athletes (five per gender). The top 18 men and women in individual events in the 2022 and 2023 FINA World Championships will secure spots for their NOCs. In addition, at each of the CONSANAT Championships (Zone 1) and the PAQ Qualifying Diving Championships (Zone 2), divers from federations competing in such events may earn a quota position for their NOCs provided that the total number of divers from such Zones do not exceed 24 divers on all boards (including those who are ranked in FINA from such competing federations but excluding any divers from CHI). Zone 3 and 4 divers do not have separate qualifiers within their zones. National championships or trials events in Zones 3 and 4 may be used to name divers to already qualified positions. \nResults.\n\"Green denotes finalists\""

        "text": "The 2023–24 NCAA Division I women's basketball season began on November 6, 2023. The regular season ended on March 17, 2024, with the 2024 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament beginning on March 20 and ended with the championship game at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse in Cleveland, Ohio, on April 7.\nThis season was the first for the Women's Basketball Invitation Tournament, a secondary national tournament operated by the NCAA as a direct parallel to the men's National Invitation Tournament.\nRule changes.\nOn May 5, 2023, the NCAA Basketball Rules Committee proposed a suite of rule changes for the 2023–24 season. These changes were approved by the Playing Rules Oversight Panel during its June 8 conference call:\nConference membership changes.\nNineteen schools joined new conferences, became independents, or dropped athletics.\nThe 2023−24 season was the last for at least 19 Division I schools in their current conferences and at least two Division II schools in their current conferences before reclassification to Division I. It was also the last season for Chicago State as the only Division I independent.\nSeasonal outlook.\nThe Top 25 from the AP and USA Today Coaching Polls.\nTop 10 matchups.\nRankings reflect the AP poll Top 25.\nRegular season.\nUpsets.\nAn upset is a victory by an underdog team. In the context of NCAA Division I women's basketball, this generally constitutes an unranked team defeating a team currently ranked in the top 25. This list will highlight those upsets of ranked teams by unranked teams as well as upsets of No. 1 teams. Rankings are from the AP poll. Bold type indicates winning teams in \"true road games\"—i.e., those played on an opponent's home court (including secondary homes). \"Italics\" type indicates winning teams in an early-season tournament (or event). Early season tournaments are tournaments played in the early season. Events are the tournaments with the same teams in it every year (even rivalry games).\nIn addition to the above listed upsets in which an unranked team defeated a ranked team, there have been six non-Division I teams to defeat a Division I team so far this season. Bold type indicates winning teams in \"true road games\"—i.e., those played on an opponent's home court (including secondary homes).\nConference winners and tournaments.\nEach of the 32 Division I athletic conferences will end its regular season with a single-elimination tournament. The team with the best regular-season record in each conference receives the number one seed in each tournament, with tiebreakers used as needed in the case of ties for the top seeding. Unless otherwise noted, the winners of these tournaments will receive automatic invitations to the 2024 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament. \nPostseason.\nTournament upsets.\nPer the NCAA, \"Upsets are defined as when the winner of the game was seeded two or more places lower than the team it defeated.\"\nWomen's Basketball Invitation Tournament.\nThe 2023–24 season was the first for the WBIT, created by the NCAA as a direct parallel to the men's National Invitation Tournament. Like the NIT, the WBIT features 32 teams. The NCAA extends WBIT bids to all regular-season conference champions that fail to reach the NCAA tournament (if eligible), a practice that it abandoned for the NIT after that tournament's 2023 edition. All games before the semifinals are at campus sites, with the semifinals and final at Hinkle Fieldhouse in Indianapolis.\nWomen's National Invitation Tournament.\nThe 2023–24 season was the 26th for the WNIT, which featured 48 teams that were not selected for either the NCAA Tournament or the WBIT.\nAward winners.\nAll-America teams.\nThe NCAA has never recognized a consensus All-America team in women's basketball. This differs from the practice in men's basketball, in which the NCAA uses a combination of selections by the Associated Press (AP), the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC), \"The Sporting News\", and the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA) to determine a consensus All-America team. The selection of a consensus team is possible because all four organizations select at least a first and second team, with only the USBWA not selecting a third team.\nBefore the 2017–18 season, it was impossible for a consensus women's All-America team to be determined because the AP had been the only body that divided its women's selections into separate teams. The USBWA first named separate teams in 2017–18. The women's counterpart to the NABC, the Women's Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA), continues the USBWA's former practice of selecting a single 10-member (plus ties) team. The NCAA does not recognize \"The Sporting News\" as an All-America selector in women's basketball.\nCoaching changes.\nMany teams will change coaches during the season and after it ends."

        "text": "The 1924–25 Union Skating Dutchmen men's ice hockey season was the 12th season of play for the program. The Skating Dutchmen represented Union College and were coached by Henry Gardner in his 1st season.\nSeason.\nSeeking to raise the profile of the program, Union brought in a former college star player to lead the team. Henry Gardner was a standout goaltender for Harvard a dozen years earlier and had recorded the only shutout against Princeton during the Hobey Baker years. Gardner had the advantage of experience with his players as well since most of last year's team was returning. The troubles with temporary rink the team had used could have been an issue for the club but the school sought to address the problem with a new arrangement. D. J. Sweeney agreed to build a special rink on the picnic grounds in Schenectady's central park. The rink would be for the exclusive use of the Union hockey team and would be maintained by the park board. The rink would have dimensions of 100' by 200' and be outfitted with floodlights. The daily practices held by coach Gardner had observers expecting the team to continue improving and they were supposedly set up for success with their opening game against Rensselaer.\nUnion had soundly defeated RPI to end their season last year, however, the Engineers took to the opportunity to exact their revenge and handed the Dutchmen a 0–4 drubbing. While Union didn't play particularly poorly in the match, loose play in the middle frame allowed Rensselaer to notch three goals in rapid succession. Slattery and Mulqueen had several chances to score but were unable to get through the staunch defensive work of the home team. The team had little change to work on their issues as the second game was just few days away. Though the Dutchmen looked better despite the quick turnaround, they still lost the match at Army. Slattery missed the trip due to an illness, which hampered the efforts of the defense, however, Gilmour was able to get the first goal of the season for the team.\nAfter poor weather caused the next game with Williams to be cancelled, the team got some practice time in before their match with Clarkson. In their only home game of the season, Union easily defeated the Golden Knights. The Dutchmen racked up three goals in the first and were then slowed by poor ice for the remainder of the match. After the exam break, the team received some very unwelcome news when Hall, Kerst, Kaiser, Mattern, Slattery and team captain Bishop were all ruled ineligible for the remainder of the year. While some had yet to play in any of the games, the loss of four starters would have a severe impact on their chances at winning. To make matters worse, poor weather continued to plague the program and caused a second cancellation, this time against Amherst. Clfford, who had been out for the first half of the year, was now eligible after the exams and arrived to help the team in its hour of need. He was joined by newcomers Hyland and Walker as well as several others who had failed to make the team during the December tryouts.\nDespite their best efforts, the park board was unable to keep the rink in a usable condition on account of the warm weather. Two additional games were cancelled and Union was unable to get any practice time for their new lineup. Due to the total lack of ice, the team tried to cancel its final game but Hamilton would not agree. The Continentals demanded that Union fulfil its contract since Hamilton's rink was still in working order. The Garnet team that arrived in Clinton was short on experience, familiarity and hadn't been on the ice in nearly a month. Hamilton, meanwhile, had an on-campus indoor rink and had access to fresh ice whenever the mood took them. The game, unsurprisingly, was a debacle for Union from start to finish. The defense was completely helpless in front of the blue and buff attack, surrendering 13 goals in one of the worst games in program history.\nFrank Long served as team manager with Don Shannon as his assistant.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "title": "Ice hockey in Rhode Island",
        "text": "Rhode Island is one of the traditional centers of ice hockey in the United States. Located in New England, the font of American ice hockey, teams from Rhode Island have played organized hockey as far back as the late-19th century and many residents have played at the highest levels of the sport.\nHistory.\nWhen ice hockey began to be introduced to the United States in the 1890s, there were no artificial ice rinks in the state. When nearby colleges Yale, Penn and Columbia began fielding teams of their own, their traditional rival Brown followed in short order. Brown played its first game on January 19, 1898, and defeated Harvard 6–0. The team, led by Irving O. Hunt, would go on to win the intercollegiate championship that season, the first time a collegiate ice hockey championship was ever awarded. Despite its early success, Brown was hamstrung by the lack of a local rink and the team was forced to construct a temporary surface atop the school's baseball diamond, Aldrich Field. This situation was untenable for the Bears and caused the team to plummet in the college hockey rankings. By 1906 the school knew that there was no impending remedy for the team and the program was shuttered.\nVery little happened in the sport over the next 20 years but that was changed in February 1926 when the Rhode Island Auditorium opened its doors. The arena was located in downtown Providence and was the first indoor ice rink in the state. Almost immediately after opening, it served as the home venue for a host of teams. First a foremost was the Providence Reds, one of the founding members of the Canadian–American Hockey League, a precursor to the American Hockey League, both minor professional leagues that send many players into the National Hockey League. Other tenants that first season also included two college teams. Brown returned after a 20-year absence and used the building as its home until 1962 while Providence also inaugurated its ice hockey program. Financial difficulties would force the Friars to cease after that one season but the team would eventually return after World War II.\nWhile Brown saw little success after their return, the Reds became one of the top minor teams in the country. Providence won three league titles in both the 1930s and 40s to establish the bonafides of ice hockey in Rhode Island. During this time the grassroots of hockey were beginning to take hold and several home-grown players would go on to achieve notoriety. George Pulliam, Bob Monahan and Ed Zifcak grew up during this period and each would eventually become an All-American. Ralph Warburton became the first home-grown player to play for the US national team at the Olympics and was one of the top performers with 21 points in just 8 games.\nIn 1972 the Reds moved out of the old Auditorium and into the Providence Civic Center but the change of venue did not help their ailing finances. The team had been mired in mediocrity for most of the previous decade and attendance numbers had fallen. A resurgence in their new venue was unable to get enough interest back into the team and in 1977, the team moved to Binghamton, New York. The state was left without a professional team for 15 years until the Boston Bruins relocated their AHL affiliate from Maine. The Providence Bruins played their first season in 1992–93 and shot out of the gate by winning a division title in their first year. The team would remain as one of the better teams in the league and went on to win the Calder Cup in 1999, the first league championship for a Rhode Island team since Brown's win more than a century before.\nIn the meantime, Rhode Island was one of the early adopters of women's ice hockey. Brown was the first school to field a varsity women's team, playing its first games in 1967. Providence was not far behind when it started its women's program in 1974. Brown's women's team reached the national championship game in 2002, losing to Minnesota Duluth.\nTeams.\nTimeline.\n \nPlayers.\nAs of end of the 2022–23 season, Rhode Island had 3,566 registered with USA Hockey. This placed Rhode Island as 14th in the nation in terms of population percentage (0.316%).\nDue to the state's low population (approximately 1.1 million as of 2020), fewer players from Rhode Island are seen at high levels of the sport. However, some have gone on to achieve notoriety."

        "title": "Tennis Europe Junior Tour",
        "text": "The Tennis Europe Junior Tour is the European tennis tour for players who are in the age range recognized by Tennis Europe as junior athletes. The Tour was organized by the European Tennis Association (ETA), now known as Tennis Europe.\nThe Tennis Europe Junior Tour is now universally recognized as the first stepping stone for talented young players across Europe as they transition from domestic to international events. Several future world No. 1 displayed their talents to an international audience for the first time on the European Junior Tour, including Steffi Graf, Monica Seles, Amélie Mauresmo, Boris Becker, Stefan Edberg, Ivan Lendl, Marat Safin, and Mats Wilander.\nHistory.\nWith the emergence of the ATP Tour in 1990, the Tennis Europe Junior Tour was also created. Founded in 1990 with 43 tournaments over two age groups, the Junior Tour has since grown and been divided into three age groups; 16 &amp; Under, 14 &amp; Under and 12 &amp; Under, and as of 2022, these three categories combined for a total of some 450+ tournaments, staged across almost all 50 member nations of Tennis Europe, and with the participation of over 12,000 players, including non-European players, such as Lleyton Hewitt, Kei Nishikori, Juan Martín Del Potro, Guillermo Coria, and Sania Mirza, who all got their first taste of European competition on the Junior Tour.\nOverview.\nAfter playing national junior events in their home countries, talented young players then usually proceed to compete internationally, on the Tennis Europe Junior Tour. Players begin their pathway with Category 3 events and work their way up to competing at the U14 Super Category tournaments (dubbed as the 'grand slams' of the U14 circuit), the European Championships, and the season-ending Junior Masters. The Tennis Europe Junior Tour also boasts a cumulative weekly ranking, 'Player of the Year' awards (former recipients include Rafael Nadal, Grigor Dimitrov, and Kim Clijsters), and a season-ending Masters tournament for the top eight performers in each category (the equivalent of the ATP Finals).\nThe best players from the Junior Tour then join the ITF Junior Circuit, which allows them to compete for the Junior Grand Slam titles, establish a world junior ranking and give them a chance to get an ATP or WTA ranking. The ITF Junior Circuit is thus basically the player pathway between the junior game of the Tennis Europe Junior Tour and the elite levels of professional tennis of the ATP.\nTwo team events also exist for the top players from each age category (U12/U14/U16): The Tennis Europe Winter Cups and the Summer Cups, which provide youngsters with an early opportunity to compete for their countries. These events are where many future Davis and Billie Jean King Cup champions earned a first taste of team competition. The U14 events serve as the European qualifying for the ITF World Junior Tennis tournament, while the U16 events are the European qualifying for the Junior Davis Cup and Junior Billie Jean King Cup. All three of them date back to the founding of Tennis Europe in the mid-1970s.\nTournament grades.\nU12 Circuit.\nThe 12 &amp; Under Tour differs in that no rankings are produced, and there are no Masters or European individual championship events, though the summer team event has been widely acclaimed. From 2021, the top U12 players end the season at the 12 &amp; Under Festival, an invitational event for the national squads of European boys and girls hosted by the Rafa Nadal Academy.\nU14/16 Circuit.\nThe 14/16 &amp; Under Tour events are played at three levels, ranging from the elite Category 1 events, which attract the strongest draws, to the more numerous and accessible Category 2 and 3 events. In 2019, Tennis Europe announced the introduction of a new ‘Super Category’ in the Junior Tour events, which would award increased ranking points and provide other increased benefits and services for participants. The Super Category status was awarded to 5 of the Tour’s best-performing and most prestigious events in recognition of their extraordinary performance: The ONE-SGM Christmas Cup held in Khimki, \"Les Petits As\" held in Tarbes, \"Kungens Kanna &amp; Drottningens Pris\" held in Stockholm, the \"Taça Internacional Maia\" held in Maia, and the U14 International German Tennis Championships held in Düren.\nBefore the addition of the Super Categories, the most important and prestigious tournaments in the U14 Junior Tennis calendar were \"Petits As\", Tim Essonne, the European Junior Championships, and the season-ending Junior Masters. No one has ever won all of them, but Richard Gasquet and Rafael Nadal have both won three of them, with Gasquet only missing the Masters while Nadal only failed to win the Championships. The only players who have won both Petits As and the U14 European Junior Championships are Reinhard Wawra in 1987, Maxime Boyé in 1990, Răzvan Sabău in 1991, Julien Maigret in 1997, Richard Gasquet in 1999, Carlos Boluda in 2006, Nikola Milojević in 2009, Vojtech Petr in 2019, and Thijs Boogaard in 2022. In 1991, the finalists of \"Petits As\", Răzvan Sabău and Juan Antonio Saiz, also reached the final of the U14 European Junior Championships, with Sabău winning both of them. Furthermore, Todor Enev reached both finals in 1996, but lost both of them.\nIn the U14/16 Circuits, boys and girls events in both singles and doubles events are held at all tournaments, with some offering additional consolation tournaments for early losers. In addition to their results, some juniors are more focused on player parties, cultural exchanges, and tourist trips during the events."

With the emergence of the ATP Tour in 1990, the Tennis Europe Junior Tour was also created, and the European Junior Championships are now a part of its Junior calendar year.\nThe only players who have reached two finals in the U14 events are Kent Carlsson (1981/82) and Răzvan Sabău (1990/91), with the former winning both while the latter lost in 1990, but won in 1991. The only players who have won both the singles and doubles tournaments in the U14 events are Johan Sjogren in 1977 (paired with Jörgen Windahl), Florian Loddenkemper in 1984, Kamil Čapkovič in 2000 (paired with Peter Miklusicak), Novak Djokovic in 2001 (paired with Bojan Božović), Jérôme Inzerillo in 2004 (paired with Nassim Slilam), Bogdan Borza in 2011 (paired with Nicolae Frunză), and Thijs Boogaard in 2022.

He joined Gloucester in 1974 and soon earned his first England call up, for the 1975 tour of Australia, where he started in both Tests. The tour was a disappointment for England and Kingston was one of the players discarded, only to return for three matches in the 1979 Five Nations Championship.\nKingston continued to play with Gloucester into the mid-1980s and won two County Championship titles representing Gloucestershire. He had a stint with Welsh club Pontypool in 1984.\nFor 33 years, Kingston was a PE, history and sports teacher at Pate's Grammar School. He retired in 2009."

The Skating Dutchmen represented Union College and were coached by Elmer Oliphant in his 1st season.\nSeason.\nThe hockey team received welcome news early in the year when the school decided to build a new temporary skating rink on the campus tennis courts. Unfortunately, poor weather conditions delayed the start of practice and caused the surface to be rough and slow. The season was set to begin just a few days after the first session was finally held but the team had more to play for than wins alone; the very future of the program was at stake. In 1920, the school had reportedly spent several hundred dollars on the program with little to show for their investment. After returning in '22, the team had drawn enough interest for Union to try once more and would need to see some potential for them to sign of on setting up an intercollegiate schedule.\nKnowing what was on the line for the program, the team kicked off the season in style with an impressive win over the Schenectady Wanderers, a local amateur club. After the two other Schenectady teams were forced to cancel games, the rematch with the Wanderers a week later became an impromptu championship match. Though the score was closer, the second win by Union gave the Dutchmen the city championship. Union had a few weeks to prepare for their final game of the season, a trip to Albany to play the local country club. While the team lost its final match, and had several more canceled due to poor weather, the team had made enough of an impression on the athletic department for the team to return the following year.\nDick Meyer served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

This was the 76th season in which an NCAA ice hockey championship is being held, and is US college hockey's 130th year overall.\nConference realignment.\nAfter Robert Morris suspended its program in the summer of 2021, a successful fundraising campaign allowed the team to return for this season. The program rejoined Atlantic Hockey, bringing the number of conference members back up to 11.\nThe same summer, Augustana University proceeded with plans to promote its athletic department to Division I. In concert with that decision, the school finalized the addition of a new ice hockey program that would begin with this season. In the interim, the program was accepted into the CCHA as the ninth member team and would play its first two seasons using a transition schedule before becoming a full member in 2025.\nOn July 5, 2023, Arizona State University was accepted as the ninth member of the National Collegiate Hockey Conference (NCHC) beginning with the 2024–2025 season. This will mark the Sun Devils' final season as an independent program.\nPairWise Rankings.\nThe PairWise Rankings (PWR) are a statistical tool designed to approximate the process by which the NCAA selection committee decides which teams get at-large bids to the 16-team NCAA tournament. Although the NCAA selection committee does not use the PWR as presented by USCHO, the PWR has been accurate in predicting which teams will make the tournament field.\nFor Division I men, all teams are included in comparisons starting in the 2013–14 season (formerly, only teams with a Ratings Percentage Index of .500 or above, or teams under consideration, were included). The PWR method compares each team with every other such team, with the winner of each “comparison” earning one PWR point. After all comparisons are made, the points are totaled up and rankings listed accordingly.\nWith 64 Division I men's teams, the greatest number of PWR points any team could earn is 63, winning the comparison with every other team. Meanwhile, a team that lost all of its comparisons would have no PWR points.\nTeams are then ranked by PWR point total, with ties broken by the teams’ RPI ratings, which starting in 2013–14 is weighted for home and road games and includes a quality wins bonus (QWB) for beating teams in the top 20 of the RPI (it also is weighted for home and road).\nWhen it comes to comparing teams, the PWR uses three criteria which are combined to make a comparison: RPI, record against common opponents and head-to-head competition. Starting in 2013–14, the comparison of record against teams under consideration was dropped because all teams are now under comparison.\nPlayer stats.\nLeading goaltenders.\n&lt;br&gt;\"GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\""

The River Hawks represented the University of Massachusetts Lowell in the 2023–24 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season, played their home games at Tsongas Center and were coached by Norm Bazin in his 13th season.\nSeason.\nEntering the year, Lowell was having to replace several of its key players; The top three scorers from last year were all gone, which was not ideal for a team that already had a hard time scoring. However, more critically, the River Hawks needed to find a way to replace its starting goaltender. Henry Welsch had shared the crease in '23 and was expected to compete for the job with Massachusetts transfer Luke Pavicich. At the start, the goaltending rotation looked like it was working when Lowell won 4 of its first 6 games while allowing less than 2 goals per. The tandem continued to play well in November, however, that when the lack of offense began to cost the team. The Hawks faced a gauntlet of highly-ranked opponents and lost four consecutive games, three by just a single goal. The losses dropped the squad to the bottom of the conference but there was still plenty of time to recover.\nUnfortunately, from Thanksgiving on, the offense never could get on track. Over the final 24 games, Lowell managed 3 goals in just eight of their games and 4 goals in only two. They were shutout four separate times in that span and ended the regular season with just 39 goals in Hockey East play, by far the lowest mark in the conference. To make matters worse, Pavicich struggled in the second half of the season and his numbers ballooned. While Lowell's average goals against wasn't much much worse than their contemporaries, their nearly invisible offense left the team with no margin for error. The River Hawks finished last in the conference and ended with just 8 wins on the year, by far the worse season under Bazin.\nIn the conference tournament, the team continued the same trend and were unable to score a single goal. Even with Welsh holding New Hampshire to 1 goal, the team suffered its third consecutive blanking and quietly ended a forgettable year.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \nRankings.\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "text": "The 1968 South Africa rugby union tour of France was a rugby union tour of France by the South Africa national team in October and November 1968. The tour was South Africa's first sole tour of France, having previously played France on joint-European (Great Britain, Ireland) tours. South Africa's tours of Europe over the previous decades (1906–07, 1912–13, 1931–32, 1951–52, 1960–61, 1965) were extremely successful, holding a win ratio of 88.16%, played across 150 matches.\nSouth Africa won the two-match tour-series 2–0, with both matches being within a five-point margin (20–28 on aggregate). Overall South Africa won five of the six matches on tour.\nBackground.\nAll of France's three previous victories over South Africa were on South African soil. South Africa's previous match against France on French soil finished 0–0 at the Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir in the Paris suburb of Colombes. The tour and two-match series held great significance in that, before the match, France was the only team that South Africa had a negative win ratio against (40%). Every other team, including the British Lions, who had only recently toured South Africa months prior, kept South Africa to a neutral win ratio (New Zealand) or a positive one. Furthermore, although one team (France) kept South Africa to a negative win ratio, no team had a positive win ratio against South Africa, the highest being New Zealand with a win ratio of 42.31%.\nMatches.\nFirst match.\nThe first match on the Springbok tour was against a combined team from the South-eastern coastal region of France, with the majority of the team playing with Toulon in the French Championship. South Africa won the match in convincing fashion, scoring six tries to one drop goal.\nFirst test.\nThe fourth match, and first test, of the Springbok tour was against France, played in the south-western city of Bordeaux. The story of the match was the missed kicks from South African errors. One try scored by France to three penalty goals kicked via South Africa's Piet Visagie gave the visitors a 3–9 lead at half-time. However, by full-time, although scoring two late tries to bring themselves back into the match (9–12), France had failed to kick seven penalty goals, three conversions, and a drop goal. A total of thirty points. The final score finished France 9, South Africa 12.\nSecond test.\nThe sixth match, and final test, of the Springbok tour saw the South Africans play France again, in the Paris commune of Colombes. Trailing 6–3 at half-time, the South Africans fought back early in the second half, scoring three tries to one. South Africa won by five points, and took the series 2–0."

        "text": "The Castle Snooker Club was a billiard hall at 57-59 Castle Way, Southampton, England, opened in 1970 by professional snooker player Bernard Bennett. Snooker historian Clive Everton described it as \"the earliest of the new-style snooker establishments which were to replace the dingy, disreputable billiard halls of old.\"\nIt was the venue for Bennett's 1971 challenge match against Rex Williams for the World Billiards Championship. Williams retained the title, winning by 9,250 point to 4,058. The 1972 World Snooker Championship qualifying match between Bennett and Graham Miles was held at the club; Miles won 15–6.\nAs of 1999, professional player Duncan Moore coached at the club. Bennett died in 2002, having seen the Club resognised as an accredited centre by snooker's governing body. The club closed in June 2007.\nCastle Open.\nThe Castle Open was a pro-am snooker tournament staged at the Club several times during the 1970s.\nThe Billiard Association and Control Council's official magazine \"Billiards and Snooker\" described the first edition, which commenced in October 1970, as \"the most ambitious Open Snooker tournament ever promoted in Britain\". Six professional players entered: Bennett, Ron Gross, Pat Houlihan, Jack Rea, David Taylor, and Rex Williams. Chris Ross was among the amateur participants.\nThe 1978/79 edition, which had a prize fund of £3,500 attracted almost all of the professional players who were in the country at the time. Terry Griffiths, who had turned professional that season, later wrote that, \"The matches were short and the prize money not all that much but because the proprietor, Bernard Bennett, is a professional who is well liked in the snooker world, there was a good turn-out of professionals to support his tournament.\" Fred Davis reached the final at the age of 65, having eliminated Willie Thorne and Cliff Thorburn during the tournament. He lost 1–5 to Alex Higgins.\nCastle Professional.\nThe Castle Professional featured three professional players in a round-robin competition. Known results are shown below."

The contributors continued to be coaches until 1994, when the AP took over administration of the poll from Greenberg, and switched to a panel of writers.\nUSA Today Coaches Poll.\nThe Coaches Poll is the second-oldest poll still in use after the AP Poll. It is compiled by a rotating group of 31 college Division I head coaches. The poll operates by Borda count. Each voting member ranks teams from 1 to 25. Each team then receives points for their ranking in reverse order: Number 1 earns 25 points, number 2 earns 24 points, and so forth. The points are then combined and the team with the highest points is then ranked No. 1; second highest is ranked No. 2 and so forth. Only the top 25 teams with points are ranked, with teams receiving first-place votes noted the quantity next to their name. The maximum points a single team can earn is 775."

        "text": "The 1922–23 Princeton Tigers men's ice hockey season was the 23rd season of play for the program. The Tigers were coached Chippy Gaw in his 1st season.\nSeason.\nThe season began with drastic changes for the Tigers. Aside from the typical roster turnover, the team was welcoming in a new head coach for the third consecutive season. Chippy Gaw was coming off a successful season with Dartmouth and the Princeton faithful were hoping he could turn around a program that had flagged recently. The other big change, and one that was sure to provide a boost to the team, was the opening of the Hobey Baker Memorial Rink. The facility was the second on-campus ice rink in the country, being completed one year after the Russell Sage Rink. The call for candidates pulled in a bumper harvest of 80 students for the first practice, however, the team encountered an unforeseen problem early in the season. The new ice rink would need approximately 150,000 gallons of water over 3 days for the ice surface and the town's water supply wasn't able to handle that request. Princeton, New Jersey was experiencing a drought at the time and the school's allotment of water was already being used for other pursuits. The school asked the student body to try and conserve as much water as possible so that the ice could be formed, believing that a concerted effort would allow the rink to be usable within 3 or 4 days. Princeton was hoping to have this completed bY December 16, the day that the rink was set to be dedicated in honor of Hobey Baker. In the meantime, plans to build a cooling plant that would recycle water through the pipes was already underway but it could not be finished until at least the end of the month.\nHoping that the early-season plans would come to fruition, the team had its first game tentatively set for December 16 with potentially a few more during the winter break. The team ended having to travel to New York for their first on-ice practice as the water conservation did not yield the needed results. The rink's opening was rescheduled to January 5 and the opening game with the St. Nicholas Hockey Club was cancelled since the players would not have enough practice time ahead of the game. The Hobey Baker Memorial Rink was finally ready for use on the 15th and the team held its first practice on the new rink. Due to the nearly three week delay, the team ended up scrapping all of its games in December and set its first match for just after New Year's.\nPrinceton began the year at the Iceland Rink on the corner of Broadway and 53rd. They met McGill on January 2 and looked to be a far better unit than they had been the year before. With a forward unit of Davis, Norrie and Stout, the team was relying on a pair of new players for their offensive punch. The defense was composed of Van Gerbig and Wall, both returning players who would be expected to hold off the opposition while another new player, Gleason, got use to starting in goal. While they opened the scoring and held the lead for much of the game, an injury to Wall allowed the Redmen to claw their way back and eke out a 1-goal victory. A few days later, 2,700 spectators crammed into the Hobey Baker Memorial Rink for the first game ever held under its roof. The team's play was loose and ragged in the early portion of the match, allowing St. Nicholas to built a 2-goal lead after the first period. Coach Gaw moved Van Gerbig to Right Wing at the start of the second and the adjustment paid dividends with the team's captain netting 2 goals in the middle frame. Davis joined in with a marker just before the second intermission and the defense then held off the amateurs for the remainder of the contest.\nIf the team was experiencing any jitters in the first two games, all those were forgotten when they took the ice against MIT. The Tigers skated rings around the Engineers and completely shut down the visitor's offense. Van Gerbig recorded 5 goals in the game and was joined on the scoresheet by Davis, Norrie and Sadler. The game went so well for Princeton that coach Gaw was able to give all 15 members of the team some time on the ice, including all three goaltenders. Princeton continued the torrid play a few days later when Penn arrived. The Tigers fired goal after goal into the cage, racking up a total of 13 markers in the match against a team that was hamstrung by a lack of practice time. This time Van Gerbig finished the game with 6 goals to his name while Davis wasn't far behind with 5. The lone goal scored by the Quakers came at the end of the third with most of the Tigers' starters having long been swapped out for their understudies.\nWith the next game coming against the vaunted Harvard Crimson it was all but certain that the team would not be able to keep up its scoring pace. Sure enough, once the game started, Harvard put up a far stronger defensive front than their other opponents, however, Princeton's inspired play continued and the Tigers' defense shut down the Crimson attack. Van Gerbig was again the star for Princeton, scoring the team's second and third goals before putting up a defensive wall that made sure one would stand as the game-winner. This was the first road win for Princeton against Harvard since 1912, when Hobey Baker was playing for the Tigers.\nPrinceton didn't lose an ounce of its power after the biggest win in nearly a decade and romped over Columbia a few days later. Davis recorded a hat-trick in the first four minutes of the match and paced the team to an 8-goal opening period. Davis finished the match with 5 markers while Van Gerbig and Stout each had hat-trick of their own. The team scored 14 in all and didn't allow a single goal in retaliation. The win tied the program record for the largest margin of victory, matching the previous record that was set during the Hobey Baker-era. The end of the week saw another overpowering performance from Princeton, this time by swamping Hamilton 10–2. Stout had his best game of the year, leading the pack with 5 goals and the team didn't even appear to miss Van Gerbig who was absent due to a minor injury.\nWith Yale up next, the Tigers had a chance to make themselves the favorite for the Intercollegiate championship. In order to curtail Princeton's offensive advantage, Yale essentially played with three defenseman during the game as one of the forwards would stay back to stop any counterattack from the Tigers. Early on, at least, that didn't appear to help the Bulldogs as Stout got the ball rolling early in the first period. After Van Gerbig made it 2–0 a minute later. O'Hearn and Bulkley scored before and after the first intermission to tie the score but Davis put Princeton back into the lead in the middle of the second. Yale tied the game once more at the end of the period and then played total defense for the remainder of the match in order to prevent another Princeton goal. While the tactic worked, it also stopped Yale from being able to do much on offense and both goaltenders began to turn in stellar performances. with no goals in the third, two 5-minute overtime periods were agreed to but the score stubbornly refused to change. A third, sudden death overtime was then called for and at about the 6-minute mark, Wall fired home the winning goal.\nPrinceton rounded out the month in style, dominating Bates with another outstanding game for the home fans. Davis netted 4 goals while Van Gerbig and Stout each had a pair. The team hit the road for the last match, meeting Army for another easy win, though the team was a bit slowed due to the absence of Van Gerbig and Stout.\nWith the team at 9–1 and possessing wins over their conference rivals, Princeton was the class of college hockey and was in position for the thirst championship since 1914. Unfortunately, due to the exam schedule, the team did not have another game scheduled for over two weeks. The team arranged a trip during the 3-day vacation period after the exams and met the Nichols Club of Buffalo for an away game. While the score was close, that was entirely due to the herculean efforts of the opposing goaltender, who stopped at least 50 shots in the game. The team then practiced at Lake Placid before taking an early train to New Haven for the rematch with Yale. Princeton was missing Norrie from their starting lineup but was otherwise the same team that had defeated the Elis earlier. Yale continued their defensive style from earlier and succeeded in stopping the Princeton offense cold; the Tigers were unable to get anything into the Bulldog cage. Fortunately, Gleason was just as stingy in Princeton's end and regulation ended without a goal on either side. Just like the earlier match, two overtime periods resulted in no scoring so a third and final session was needed. This time it took 13 minutes before the winning goal was scored but now it was the Elis who had reason to celebrate. Yale's winning goal was the first loss for Pricneton against a collegiate opponent but it didn't end their pursuit of a championship as a third and deciding game between the two would be played later.\nPrinceton then returned home and played host to another Canadian college. Montreal gave the Tigers a stiff challenge and it took seeming all they had to overcome an early deficit and force a tie. The Carabins led by 2–1 and 4–2 before a stellar third period saw Princeton tie the match. Van Gerbig and Stout each scored twice to save the Tigers from defeat. Because Montreal had a train to catch, the team was unable to play any overtime sessions and the game was declared a draw. The ten was sent into a collision course with Harvard. The Crimson, three-time defending champions, had already suffered three losses and a further defeat to the Tigers would end any chance of their winning a championship. Harvard followed the Yale blueprint and played a stifling brand of defense against the Tigers. The tactic resulted in 0 goals through the first two periods but Harvard got into the lead at the start of the third. Davis tied the game just 30 seonds later and the two went back to battling for the lead. In the middle of the period, Davis had the puck in front of the Harvard net before the Crimson captain, George Owen stole the puck, skated the length of the ice, and scored the winning goal. Princeton tried to even the score a second time but the Harvard bulwark was too much for the Tigers to overcome.\nThe loss to Harvard was only a minor setback since the two would play the deciding match just 4 days later. Up in Boston another defensive battle ensued and, once more, Princeton could not overcome the oppressive play of Harvard. Harvard opened the scoring when Beals scored off of a rebound in the first period and then were content to nurse their slight advantage to the end of the game. Despite a desperate attack, none of Princeton's shots were able to get past the Harvard netminder and the Tigers saw their chances at a championship dwindle away to nothing.\nWhile the team was no longer in the running for a championship, the Tigers could still play spoiler. After a relatively easy win over Williams, Princeton hosted Dartmouth, who had vaulted into the top spot after Princeton's poor February. The game followed an almost identical pattern that their last few games had as Dartmouth got a lead early in the second and then played a staunch defensive game to retain the advantage. It wasn't until the start of the third that Princeton was finally able to break through and scored just 32 seconds into the frame. The goal seemed to turn the tide in Princeton's favor with Scull and Van Gerbig adding goals to give the black and orange the victory. For Dartmouth the loss was catastrophic as it ended up costing the Indians the intercollegiate championship.\nThe following week saw Princeton travel south for a rematch with Penn. The score was much closer than the first meeting but the result was the same. After a slow opening period, Davis and Stout combined for 5 goals in the second and effectively ended the game. The Quakers were able to get two on the board in the third, once coach Gaw began substituting players, but that hardly changed the character of the match. The game saw the first appearance on the year for Jackson, who had played with the team the year before. The rubber match with Yale was the final game of the year for Princeton and the Tigers looked to be the better squad for most of the game. The defensive style continued to perplex the Tigers, who were only able to get a single goal in the game, but they had a lead by the midway point of the match. Unfortunately, a brief offensive flurry at the end of the second doomed the Tigers. After the game had been tied, Yale recorded 2 goals in 23 seconds to take the lead and Princeton was unable to answer. Despite desperate attempts by Davis and Van Gerbig, Princeton could not break through the Eli defense and ended their best season in almost a decade with a loss.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

The Skating Dutchmen represented Union College and were coached by Ambrose Clark in his 3rd season.\nSeason.\nWith the school's administration signing off on a limited travel budget for the team, the Skating Dutchmen were finally able to put together an intercollegiate schedule. Despite plans of starting the season early, however, wearm weather caused the cancellation of the first game. The loss of that match did not put a damper on what turned out to be the season-opener as Middlebury arrived in town. The Rink was in decent condition for the match and the team had welcomed the addition of floodlight which had allowed the players to practice long after the sun set. The large size of the rink also enabled the game to me moved to a different section if one part was unsuitable for play. The inaugural intercollegiate match for the program turned out better than the Dutchmen could have hoped as Union downed Middlebury 3–0. Bishops pair was interrupted by one from Bates and Mattern earned the first official shutout since the end of the war.\nThe weather and exam break had the team on the shelf for most of the next month and they finally returned to play in mid-February. The team met the Schenectady Golf Club for a warm up match before returning to intercollegiate play and won their second game on the season on the strength of a solid defensive performance. The team travelled down to West Point for a match with Army and, at least early on, the Garnet held their own. Due to several players being ruled ineligible, three freshmen were inserted in the lineup. Union had difficulty handling Army's star forward, Marinelli, but team captain La Pan was able to tie the match in the second. Slattery, who had been pressed into service as a goaltender held up in the first two periods but the Dutch defense collapsed in the third. The team surrendered 4 goals to turn what had been an even game into a rout. The same lineup was used in the next game just a few days later and the team was about as successful against Amherst. Though the team was able to use substitutions for the home game, none of the additional players managed to help on the offensive side of the puck. Clifford scored the only goal in the loss to the Lord Jeffs and had the Dutchmen on the cusp of a losing season.\nThe final game of the season saw Union resume its rivalry with Rensselaer. The game quickly tilted in favor of the Dutchmen with Union displaying a much more cohesive brand of hockey. A hat-trick from Clifford was more than enough as Union won the match 7–0. Slattery earned the shoutout, perhaps becoming the only player to start the season as a forward and blank an opponent for an entire game.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

He was capped in 10 Tests for England during the late 1970s. His first call up in 1977 came on the day of his 31st birthday and he scored a debut try, against Scotland at Twickenham. He was also part of the \"Rest of the World\" that toured South Africa in 1977."

        "title": "1975 NCAA Division I basketball championship game",
        "text": "The 1975 NCAA Division I basketball championship game was the final of the 1975 NCAA Division I basketball tournament and determined the national champion for the 1974–75 season. The game was held at the San Diego Sports Arena in San Diego, California, on March 31, 1975. The UCLA Bruins defeated the Kentucky Wildcats 92–85 to win the program's 10th title in 12 seasons. The 1975 national championship game was the last in the career of UCLA head coach John Wooden, who had been in charge of the Bruins throughout their title-winning run.\nBackground.\nUCLA Bruins.\nThe Bruins entered the 1974–75 season coming off a loss in the Final Four of the 1974 NCAA tournament, which ended a streak of seven consecutive national championships. The team had won titles in nine of the previous 11 seasons, all of which were earned under head coach John Wooden, who was in his 27th season with UCLA. Following the team's defeat against North Carolina State, multiple Bruins players were selected in the 1974 NBA draft, including Bill Walton—who had been chosen as the national player of the year—and Jamaal Wilkes. Senior forward Dave Meyers led the 1974–75 Bruins in scoring with an average of 18.3 points per game, and had a team-high 7.9 rebounds per game. Richard Washington, a sophomore center, added 15.9 points and 7.8 rebounds per game. Sophomore forward Marques Johnson and senior center Pete Trgovich also had double-figure scoring averages, with 11.6 and 10.2 points per game respectively. Other regulars in the Bruins' roster included center Ralph Drollinger and guard Andre McCarter.\nUCLA opened their 1974–75 campaign as the second-ranked team in the country in the AP Poll. Their first game of the season, against Wichita State on November 29, 1974, was an 85–74 victory. That game began a long winning streak for the Bruins, and was the first of seven straight wins by margins greater than 10 points. The Bruins defeated two ranked teams during that stretch: 11th-ranked Memphis State on December 20, and 12th-ranked Notre Dame one day later. Lopsided wins over Davidson and Oklahoma brought the Bruins to 10–0 entering Pac-8 conference play.\nOn January 9, the Bruins defeated Washington by 10 points in their first conference game. Two days later, a 77–69 win over Washington State brought them to 12–0. Stanford then beat the Bruins, 64–60, giving UCLA their first loss of the season. After a pair of wins, the Bruins had their second loss, in a rematch with Notre Dame. The team then went on a six-game winning streak, which included four games against ranked teams: two against Oregon, and one each against Oregon State and USC. At Washington, the Bruins took a 22-point loss, which left them at 9–2 in the conference. UCLA then won their final three regular season games, concluding with a 72–68 win at USC, then ranked 11th in the country. Entering the tournament, the Bruins were the second-ranked team in the AP Poll, and had a 23–3 record (12–2 in Pac-8 play).\nIn the first round of the tournament's West region, against Michigan, the Bruins were forced into overtime before emerging with a 103–91 win. The next round also proved competitive, as they defeated Montana by three points, 67–64. That win put the Bruins into the regional final, where they clinched a Final Four appearance with a 14-point victory over Arizona State.\nAgainst Louisville in the Final Four, the Bruins were locked in a tight game late, trailing 65–61 with under a minute remaining. UCLA was able to tie the score and force overtime; it was the second straight year that the Bruins reached overtime in a Final Four game. The Bruins trailed 74–73 as Louisville's Terry Howard shot a one-and-one free throw with 20 seconds on the clock in the extra period. His attempt missed and the Bruins gained possession of the ball. After a timeout and multiple passes, Washington made a jump shot eight feet from the basket for what proved to be the winning points in a 75–74 UCLA win. Following the game, Wooden publicly announced that he would retire after the end of the national championship game.\nKentucky Wildcats.\nThe Wildcats were coached by Joe B. Hall, who was in his third season at the position. The previous season, the team finished at 13–13, failing to qualify for the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1967. Senior guard Kevin Grevey was the Wildcats' leading scorer, with a 23.5 point-per-game average in 1974–75; he also averaged 6.4 rebounds. The top rebounder on the team was freshman center Rick Robey, who had an average of 6.9 per game while contributing 10.4 points per game. Jimmy Dan Connor, a senior guard, was second on the team in scoring at 12.4 points per game. Forward Jack Givens averaged 9.4 points per game, while guard Mike Flynn had 9.0. Other players on the Kentucky roster included forward Bob Guyette, center Mike Phillips, guard Larry Johnson, and forward James Lee.\nNorthwestern, Kentucky's first opponent in the 1974–75 season, fell by a 97–70 margin on November 30. After a road win over Miami (Ohio), the Wildcats traveled to Indiana to face the third-ranked Hoosiers, and were defeated 98–74. The Wildcats rebounded with a 12-point victory over North Carolina, who were ranked eighth in the country. It was the start of a seven-game winning streak, which included a 113–96 result over 13th-ranked Notre Dame and the first two games in the Southeastern Conference (SEC) schedule. Following a 90–85 loss to Auburn, the Wildcats had a nine-game run of victores, including a pair of wins against ranked schools: a six-point win over number 18 Tennessee and a five-point win over number six Alabama.\nKentucky had a pair of defeats in their next four games, although one of the wins was a second victory over Alabama. The team's regular season concluded with wins over Vanderbilt and Mississippi State. The Wildcats' record stood at 22–4 overall, and they finished in first place in the SEC with a 15–3 conference record. They were the number five team in the AP Poll entering the NCAA tournament.\nHaving been placed in the Mideast region of the tournament, the Wildcats' first round game against Marquette ended in a 22-point win. In the regional semifinals, Kentucky posted a 90–73 result over Central Michigan to advance to the regional final, where the team faced Indiana, the top-ranked team in men's college basketball before the tournament. The Hoosiers had a record of 30–0 entering the game, but were short-handed; All-American Scott May, feeling the effects of a broken arm suffered earlier in the season, was limited to seven minutes of game time. In a rematch against a team that had beaten them by 24 points in the regular season, Kentucky prevailed 92–90. That victory got the Wildcats into the Final Four, where they defeated Syracuse, 95–79, to book a place in the national title game against UCLA.\nGame summary.\nThe crowd for the 1975 national championship game, held at the San Diego Sports Arena, was announced as 15,153. The contest was preceded by a third-place game between the losing Final Four teams, Louisville and Syracuse; it was the last year that the NCAA held a consolation game. Louisville had a 16-point lead at halftime before Syracuse rallied to tie the score and force overtime, where the Cardinals outscored the Orangemen 18–10 to clinch a 96–88 victory. In the first half, the game proceeded at what \"Sports Illustrated\"s Curry Kirkpatrick called a \"furious pace\". During the half, there were five ties and the lead changed hands 15 times. The Wildcats had the advantage for the majority of the period; the \"Los Angeles Times\"s Ben Bolch later wrote that \"UCLA appeared tight early, its shots mostly missing, as if the Bruins wanted too badly to send Wooden out a winner.\" However, the Bruins grew into the game in the latter stages of the half. Twelve of the lead changes occurred in the opening six minutes, as the teams remained within a single point of each other. Kentucky's Grevey went on a scoring run, accounting for two field goals and two free throws that pushed the Wildcats to a five-point lead. A Meyers basket for UCLA was countered by a three-point play from Givens.\nSeven minutes into the game, Kentucky held a 20–14 advantage, the team's largest lead of the game. UCLA responded by scoring the next six points to force a tie, and the teams traded scores until the scores were even at 27–27. Kentucky's Grevey tallied the next four points, part of his 18 points in the first 12 minutes of play, which helped the Wildcats to a four-point lead at that point. In response to Grevey's play, Wooden inserted Drollinger into the game; he was the only reserve who saw action for UCLA. With the change, Washington was assigned to help defend Grevey; he was three inches taller than Grevey's previous defender, Johnson, and it took 18 minutes for Grevey to score again. The Bruins went on an 8–3 scoring run, and a basket by Trgovich gave them the lead with just over four minutes remaining in the half, 35–34. Trgovich hit five baskets in the latter stages of the half. During the rest of the period, UCLA slightly increased its lead, ending the half on top 43–40.\nTwice in the early part of the second half, UCLA took a six-point lead, only for Kentucky to rally to within two points. By the middle of the second half, UCLA had extended its lead, and scores by Meyers and Washington brought their margin to 10 points, 66–56, with 12 minutes remaining on the clock. The Wildcats then rallied with three three-point plays, two by Grevey and one by Flynn. A successful 20-foot shot by Grevey brought Kentucky to within 76–75, with under seven minutes left. Then came what Kirkpatrick called a key turning point in the game. Meyers was called for an offensive foul on a shot attempt during which he bumped into Grevey. Meyers responded strongly to the call and was hit with a technical foul, which prompted Wooden to run onto the court and call referee Hank Nichols a \"crook\". Kentucky would have a technical foul shot and one-and-one free throws from the original foul call, and would retain possession; this gave the Wildcats a chance to gain the lead, with the three free throws and a potential basket afterwards. However, Grevey missed on both the free throw from the technical foul and the front end of the one-and-one. On the Wildcats' subsequent possession, Lee was called for an offensive foul for setting a pick, leaving Kentucky scoreless from the series of plays.\nThe teams exchanged points on a pair of free throws by Meyers and a successful bank shot attempt by Guyette, before a missed shot by Johnson was tipped in by Washington to put UCLA up 80–77. Two Trgovich free throws stretched the Bruins' advantage to five points, with under five minutes left. Although the Wildcats cut their deficit to three points on three occasions, and twice had possession of the ball while down three, they were unable to come any closer than that. After holding an 88–85 lead, UCLA tallied the last four points to earn the win, 92–85.\nStatistical summary.\nUCLA converted 38 of its 78 field goal attempts, for a 48.7% rate, and made 16 of its 25 free throw attempts. The Bruins' shooting outpaced that of Kentucky, which made only 38.4% of its shot attempts (33-for-86). The Wildcats did make three more free throws than UCLA, in the same number of attempts.\nGrevey led all scorers for both teams with 34 points on 13-of-30 shooting from the field. Guyette made seven of his eleven field goal attempts and had 16 points, including 14 in the second half, while Flynn added 10 points. Those were the only three Wildcats players to score in double figures. Of the six Bruins players to appear in the game, four had 10 points or more. Washington led UCLA with 28 points on 12-of-23 shooting from the field; he was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. He was followed by Meyers, who had 24 points and made half of his 18 shots. Trgovich contributed 16 points, while Drollinger came off the bench to score 10 points in 16 minutes.\nUCLA had a narrow rebounding advantage over Kentucky, 50–45. Drollinger led the team with 13 rebounds, while Washington and Meyers had 12 and 11, respectively. Robey had nine rebounds to lead the Wildcats. The Bruins had 23 assists, seven more than the Wildcats; McCarter had 14 of the Bruins' assists, the most of any player in the game.\nAftermath.\nGene Bartow succeeded Wooden as the Bruins' head coach for the 1975–76 season. UCLA went 27–5 and reached the 1976 Final Four, The team did not return to the national championship game until 1980, and has won the title once since Wooden's tenure, in 1995 under Jim Harrick.\nHall's Wildcats had a 20–10 record in 1975–76 and did not qualify for the NCAA tournament. After a regional final appearance the following season, the Wildcats ended up winning the national title in 1978, which was the program's first championship in 20 years."

The team was coached by Leroy Clark in his 6th season.\nSeason.\nAfter a terrible season, particularly on the offensive side of the puck, Rensselaer entered its twentieth season looking for a better effort from its ice hockey team. They didn't see much in the way of improvement in the first game against Williams and the team lost 0–3 and managed just a single shot on goal for the entire game. The second match a week later saw the team take on Middlebury, which was a welcome relief for the beleaguered Engineers. Not only were the Panthers playing their first varsity season, but the team had only been able to practice for a few days ahead of the match. Even with those shortcomings, Middlebury gave RPI a fight and it wasn't until the second half that the Cherry and White got on the scoresheet. Reuther recorded a hat-trick in the match, single-handedly surpassing the team's scoring totals from '22 and gave the Engineers their first win in almost two calendar years.\nUnfortunately, the team didn't have a chance to build upon their win as the next game for the Engineers didn't come for almost 3 weeks. In the interim the Engineers practiced as much as they could so by the time they hit the ice in West Point the team looked bit more composed than they did in January. RPI lost to Army, however, they were playing a squad that had just taken down one of the best teams in the country and the fact that RPI could hold its own was a testament to the team's improvement. Unfortunately, whatever positive signs was shown against the Cadets vanished in the final two games. Rensselaer was hammered by both Amherst and Williams, losing by a combined score of 1–15.\nEven with the embarrassing loses, Rensselaer had shown modest improvement. However, it was not enough for the team's head coach as Leroy Clark stepped down from his post after the season. \nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

It will run alongside the 2023–24 Top 14 competition; both competitions are operated by the Ligue Nationale de Rugby (LNR).\nCompetition format.\nThe regular season uses a double round-robin format, in which each team plays the others home and away.\nThe LNR uses a slightly different bonus points system from that used in most other rugby competitions. It trialled a new system in 2007–08 explicitly designed to prevent a losing team from earning more than one bonus point in a match, a system that also made it impossible for either team to earn a bonus point in a drawn match. LNR chose to continue with this system for subsequent seasons.\nFrance's bonus point system operates as follows:\nStarting with the 2017–18 season, Pro D2 conducts a play-off system identical to the one currently used in Top 14, with the top six teams qualifying for the play-offs and the top two teams receiving byes into the semi-finals. The winner of the play-offs earns the league championship and automatic promotion to the next season's Top 14; the runner-up enters a play-off with the second-from-bottom Top 14 team, with the winner of that play-off taking up the final place in Top 14.\nThis replaced the previous system in which the top team at the end of the regular season was declared champion, also earning a Top 14 place, while the second- through fifth-place teams competed in promotion play-offs. The play-off semi-finals were played at the home ground of the higher-ranked team. The final was then played on neutral ground, and the winner earned the second ticket to the next Top 14.\nPromotion.\nPro D2 to Top 14.\nAs noted above, both promotion places will be determined by play-offs from 2017 to 2018 forward, with the winner of the Pro D2 play-offs earning promotion and the runner-up playing the second-from-bottom Top 14 team for the next season's final Top 14 place.\nNationale to Pro D2.\nStarting with the 2021–22 season, the FFR created a third professional league, slotting between Pro D2 and Fédérale 1 in the league system called Nationale.\nRelegation.\nNormally, the teams that finish in 15th and 16th places in the table are relegated to Nationale at the end of the season. In certain circumstances, \"financial reasons\" may cause a higher-placed team to be demoted instead, or bar a Fédérale 1 team from promotion.\nTable.\n&lt;section begin=table/&gt;\n&lt;section end=table/&gt;"

        "text": "The 2023 \"League of Legends\" World Championship was an esports tournament for the multiplayer online battle arena video game \"League of Legends\". It was the thirteenth iteration of the \"League of Legends\" World Championship, an annual international tournament organized by the game's developer, Riot Games. The tournament began in South Korea on October 10 until November 19. Twenty-two teams from nine regions qualified for the tournament based on their placement in regional circuits; defending champions DRX failed to do so after losing to Dplus KIA in the 2023 LCK Regional Finals. JD Gaming were in contention to become the first team to complete the \"Golden Road\", but lost to eventual champions T1 in the semifinals of the knockout stage. \n\"Gods\" (stylized in all caps), performed by NewJeans, was announced as the tournament's theme song. A virtual boyband named \"Heartsteel\" (stylized in all caps) was unveiled by Riot Games during the event, with Baekhyun from Exo and SuperM, ØZI, Tobi Lou and Cal Scruby representing the group as its human counterpart and in the live performance of their debut song, \"Paranoia\".\nThe final took place on 19 November 2023 at the Gocheok Sky Dome, where T1 defeated Weibo Gaming by a 3–0 score, marking the organization's record-extending fourth World Championship. The event's concurrent viewership reached a peak of 6.4 million viewers, breaking the all-time viewership record for a single esports event, not accounting for Chinese viewership.\nFormat changes.\nStarting from 2023, teams from LCL (CIS), TCL (Turkey), and LCO (Oceania) region no longer qualified directly for Worlds due to their leagues being cancelled (LCL, by the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine) and downgraded (TCL became a regional league for EMEA Masters, LCO was merged into PCS).\nThe number of teams was decreased from 24 to 22 compared to 2022. For seedings, first-seeded teams from PCS (Asia-Pacific) and VCS (Vietnam) were relegated to start in the play-in stage, while fourth-seeded teams from LCK (South Korea), LPL (China) and third-seeded from LEC (EMEA) and LCS (North America) were promoted to the main event. Prior to the kick off of the tournament, a \"Worlds Qualifying Series\" match between the fourth-seeded teams from LEC and LCS was played to decide the last team for the play-in stage.\nPlay-in groups were changed to a GSL-style double-elimination format, while main event's first stage was changed from a double round-robin group stage to a Swiss format.\nQualified teams.\nThe following teams qualified for the event:\nVenues.\nSeoul and Busan were the two cities chosen to host the tournament. The LoL Park, which hosted the play-in stage of the tournament, is the only venue that hosted a Worlds tournament, having hosted the same phase during the 2018 League of Legends World Championship.\nKnockout stage.\nQualified teams.\nEight teams qualified for the playoff portion of the tournament from the swiss stage.

        "text": "The 1922–23 Minnesota Gophers men's ice hockey season was the 2nd season of play for the program. The Gophers represented the University of Minnesota and were coached by both I. D. MacDonald in his 2nd season and Emil Iverson in his 1st season.\nSeason.\nAfter a good first year, Minnesota began its second official season with increased attention and saw 60 men try out for the team. Once the weather cooled off enough, the prospective players hit the ice for the first time in early December at Como Park. Coach MacDonald had hoped to use the Hippodrome but that venue was being occupied by the St. Paul Athletic Club. While the schedule was being put together, the players were being conditioned by hard practices and slowly whittled down into a varsity unit.\nOnce the team returned from the winter break, they get back to work preparing for the first game. Minnesota was able to secure the Hippodrome for the match with Ramsey Tech, a new school in the Saint Paul area. Coach MacDonald settled on the roster just before the opening tilt but the team had yet to elect a captain. Loren Jacobson had been selected to be this year's leader at the conclusion of the previous season, however, he did not return to campus in the fall. With the Gophers still looking for their next captain and the starters still unannounced, Minnesota was still very much a team in flux. Leland Bartlett, a returning player, got the team off on the right foot when he scored a hat-trick in the first period. New entry Frank Pond added 2 more while Addie Wyatt finished off the scoring. The defense allowed just one goal and the lopsided nature of the game allowed MacDonald to make several substitutions to get all of his players some ice time in the match.\nThe Following week the team took on St. Thomas for the first time. Jacobson was inserted as a starting defenseman in place of Wyatt for the game and the move provided the Gophers with a rock-solid defense. While the offense continued to score at a decent clip, the team didn't allow a single goal and earned their first shutout of the season. A few days later the team opened its conference season with the first ever match against Michigan. While both teams had stellar defenses, Minnesota possessed a far superior offense and goals from Pond and Wyatt led the team to victory. The rematch the following evening was almost a carbon-copy of the first with Wyatt netting 2 goals to Pond's 1 in the team's third consecutive shutout.\nMinnesota Hit the road in February and ended up playing their next 6 games outside of the state. Up first was a weekend series with Wisconsin, who were looking for revenge after being swept the year before. Fortunately for the Gophers, their hot play continued and the team recorded another blanking, tying Harvard for the collegiate record. The Badgers fought back in the rematch and ended Minnesota's shutout streak. While Wisconsin was only able to secure one goal, their defense stiffened and held the Gophers to the same mark. The tie was the first dent in Minnesota's record but still left the team undefeated.\nThe following week, Minnesota was in Ann Arbor and got right back to their offensive game with a 6-goal performance. However, now without Higgins on the back end, the team's defense appeared weaker than normal and allowed more goals in that game then had in the previous six combined. That trend continued in the final match with Michigan and saw the Wolverines had Minnesota its first loss on the year. Despite having a 2–0 lead with just 10 minutes to play, The Gopher defense collapsed and allowed 3 goals to Michigan. The final goal happened just before the end of regulation and set the home crowd into an uproar.\nThe loss put Minnesota championship hopes on the ropes as Notre Dame, the defending champions, had one loss as well. The only saving grace was that the Irish had lost their game to St. Thomas, who the Gophers had dispatched fairly easily. Minnesota, however, could not afford any further defeats and had 4 games remaining on their schedule. Next was a 2-game series against Marquette and Minnesota got a tough fight from the new program. Still hamstrung on the blueline, the Gophers were only just able to win the two games, surrendering a pair to the Blue and Gold in each match. Minnesota returned home for the final two games with only Wisconsin left in their way. The Gophers had to fight through another close game to keep their title chances alive but finally recovered their early-season form in the final match to post one final shutout and capture the Western Intercollegiate championship.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862334; \" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The 2023 Super League Grand Final, was the 26th official grand final, and championship-deciding rugby league game of Super League XXVIII. The match was contested between Wigan Warriors and Catalans Dragons, at Old Trafford.\nSt Helens were the defending champions, having won 4 consecutive titles in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022, but they were eliminated in the Semi-final, losing 6–12 to Catalans Dragons in a repeat of the 2021 Final, which St Helens won 12–10.\nRoute to the final.\nCatalans Dragons.\nCatalans ended the regular season in 2nd place, thus earning them a bye to the semi-finals, where they would play the highest ranked winner of the eliminators, which was St Helens.\nCatalans thought they had scored the first try of the game on 18 minutes, as Tom Johnstone touched down in the corner, but the referee decided the on field decision was NO TRY, with the video referee confirming this, as Johnstone was deemed to have pushed Jonny Lomax off the ball, while chasing the kick.\nSt Helens then got possession back, with Lewis Dodd putting a high kick up. As the ball bounced, Tom Johnstone somehow fumbled it 20 metres out, attempting to pick the ball up.\nOn 28 minutes, Catalans were awarded a penalty, as Sione Mata'utia was penalised for a high tackle on Sam Tomkins, with Catalans opting to kick for goal.\nAdam Keighran successfully kicked the goal, to give Catalans a 2–0 lead with 10 minutes until half time.\nThe first TRY of the game, came on 50 minutes, as Catalans knocked on, inside their own 40-metre line, and Will Hopoate touched down next to the posts.\nMark Percival successful with the conversion, and St Helens lead 6–2.\nCatalans were awarded another penalty on 64 minutes, as Moses Mbye was penalised for a high tackle. Despite being 4 points down, Catalans opted to go for the 2 points, to which Keighran was successful again, and Catalans were back to within 2 points.\nWith 8 minutes of the match remaining, things got worse for St Helens, as Matty Lees was sent to the sin bin, for what seemed to be holding down on Tom Johnstone, but replays show that his leg was trapped in the tackle.\nKeighran again opted to kick for goal, to which he was successful, and both teams were level at 6–6.\nOn 75 minutes, Saints knocked the ball on, near the halfway line to give Catalans possession 40 metres out.\n2 minutes later, Tomkins looked like he was going for a drop goal attempt, but decided to run with the ball. From the resulting kick through, saints had to clear the ball for a goal line drop out.\nWith 3 minutes remaining, Tomkins attempted to kick a drop goal, but his effort was short, and saints got the ball back, only for Mata'utia to drop the ball 20 metres out.\nAs the game looked to be heading to extra time, Sam Tomkins scored the winning try, with less than 1 minute remaining, and hand saints their first play-off defeat since 2018. Final score: Catalans 12–6 St Helens\nWigan Warriors.\nWigan finished the regular season in as league leaders, thus earning a bye to the semi-final. They played the lowest ranked winner from the eliminators, which was Hull KR.\nWigan got off to a fast start, as 3 tries in 10 minutes from Liam Marshall (2), and Jai Field, gave Wigan an 18–0 lead. \n21 minutes on the clock, and Hull KR got their first try of the game, with Elliott Minchella touching down next to the posts. \nHalf time: Wigan 18–6 Hull KR.\n3 minutes into the 2nd half, Marshall got his hat trick, as Bevan French put up a high kick for Marshall to touch down, and Wigan lead 24–6.\n5 minutes later, Toby King crossed for Wigan, to put them even further ahead. Smith successful with the conversion (5/5).\nOn 54 minutes, Field got his 2nd try of the game, with Smith again successful with the conversion (6/6).\n3 minutes later, Abbas Miski scored his 28th try of the season – Smith successful with the conversion.\nWith 3 minutes remaining, Jez Litten scored a consolation try for KR, but it wasn't enough.\nFinal score: Wigan 42–12 Hull KR\nMatch details.\n&lt;section begin=gfmatch/&gt;\n&lt;section end=gfmatch/&gt;\nFirst Half.\nThe first real chance of the first half came on 5 minutes, as Sam Tomkins put a kick into the corner, for Tom Johnstone to collect, but Wigan managed to defend it, and turned the ball over.\nOn 19 minutes, Catalans' Adam Keighran was shown a yellow card, for a dangerous tackle on Kai Pearce-Paul, and 2 minutes later, Liam Farrell almost got the first try of the game, but he was stopped just short of the line on the last tackle.\nCatalans were penalised again on 25 minutes for a high tackle on Liam Marshall, and from the resulting penalty, Harry Smith opted to go for goal, to which he was successful, and Wigan lead 2–0 with less than 15 minutes to go until half time.\nWith 5 minutes of the first half remaining, Catalans were awarded a penalty, as Wigan were caught offside, with Adam Keighran opting to kick for goal, to which he was successful, and the scores were level at 2–2.\nFirst half ends: Wigan 2–2 Catalans\nSecond Half.\n4 minutes into the 2nd half, Tom Davies was shown a yellow card, for pulling back Liam Marshall without the ball.\nOn 49 minutes, Wigan thought they had scored the first try of the game through Bevan French, but it was disallowed, for a forward pass, but 2 minutes later, Wigan scored again through Marshall, and this time it was awarded. Smith successful with the conversion, and Wigan lead 8–2, with just over 30 minutes to play.\nOn 62 minutes, Wigan were awarded another penalty for a high tackle, with Smith again, opting to kick for goal, to which he was successful, and Wigan now lead 10–2.\nFinal score: Wigan 10–2 Catalans."

        "text": "The 2024 Big West Conference men's basketball tournament was the postseason men's basketball tournament for the Big West Conference of the 2023–24 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. It was held March 13–16, 2024, at the Dollar Loan Center in Henderson, Nevada. The winner, #4 seed Long Beach State, received the conference's automatic bid to the 2024 NCAA tournament.\nSeeds.\nIn June 2023, the Big West Conference board of directors voted to reduce the tournament field from 10 teams to 8 teams. In the new format, the top two seeds would receive automatic berths in the semifinals, the next two seeds would be placed in the quarterfinals, and the remaining four seeds would play each other in the first round. Big West commissioner Dan Butterly stated that the decision was made to improve the regular season champion's odds of winning the tournament and thus receiving the automatic bid to the NCAA tournament.\nOf the 11 conference teams, 10 were eligible for tournament spots. UC San Diego was ineligible for the tournament, as it was in the final year of the four-year transition required for teams transferring to Division I from Division II. Teams were seeded based on their performance within the conference, and teams with identical conference records were seeded using a tiebreaker system.\nAs was the case with tournaments since 2020, reseeding of teams did not occur at any point."

Following a third-place finish in the 2022 playoffs, the Outlaws released the entirety of its roster, aside from damage player Oh \"Pelican\" Se-hyun. The team then picked up veterans to fill its roster, signing hitscan damage player Lee \"Happy\" Jung-woo, tank player Lee \"Fearless\" Eui-seok, and support players Kim \"Shu\" Jin-seo and Park \"Viol2t\" Min-ki. Just a week before the beginning of the preseason pro-am, the Outlaws picked up tank player Lee \"Gargoyle\" Beom-jun.\nIn the Spring Stage qualifiers, the Outlaws went 7–1, the second-best record in the Western region.

At the start of the Summer Stage, the Mayhem released Sauna and signed support Oh \"Maka\" Eun-seok. The Mayhem went a perfect 8–0 in the Summer Stage qualifiers, bringing their overall record to 14–2 for the season, tied for first with the Reign, but finished second in the West due to map differential. Tank Someone received multiple accolades at the end of the regular season, being commentated as a Role Star, being awarded the Dennis Hawelka Award, and earning the Most Valuable Player award. Head coach Jordan \"Gunba\" Graham was also named the coach of year.\nWith a balance patch going into effect just before start of the playoffs, the Mayhem signed DPS Lee \"WhoRU\" Seung-jun, a player known for their play on Genji.

It was the first time that the Grand Finals were held live outside of the United States. The location had been chosen in conjunction with a sponsorship deal made between the Overwatch League and the Toronto Defiant, wherein the Defiant had agreed to host the event.\nThe Maple Leaf Gardens, now also known as the Mattamy Athletic Centre, first opened in 1931 as an indoor arena to host Toronto Maple Leafs ice hockey games. For decades after opening, the Maple Leaf Gardens had been Canada's largest indoor venue for cultural, political, and religious events. Aside from ice hockey, the venue had hosted many other events, including a 1932 speech given by Winston Churchill, two 1964 shows from The Beatles during Beatlemania, and the 1966 boxing match between Muhammad Ali vs. George Chuvalo. The venue also hosted Overwatch League events in the past, including the 2022 Summer Showdown. Its arena has a seating capacity of 2,549 seats on its arena level and 1,000 seats in its multi-purpose court.\nTickets for Grand Finals went on sale starting July 21, 2023, and subsequently sold out.\nBroadcast.\nThe Grand Finals match was live-streamed on YouTube. \"Overwatch\" players who watched the live broadcast of the playoffs and Grand Finals could earn \"viewership rewards,\" including an in-game currency that allowed them to purchase in-game cosmetics, twelve Overwatch League-themed skins, battle pass tier skips, and other cosmetics.\nPrior to the start of the championship final, \"Overwatch\" game director Aaron Keller and executive producer Jared Neuss showcased the game's upcoming new map, Samoa. A showmatch between analysts, casters, content creators, and Canadian OWL players took place to feature the new map.\nAt the conclusion of the Grand Finals, Overwatch League host Soe Gschwind delivered a message on broadcast reflecting on the 2023 season and the uncertainty surrounding the league's future. At the end of the 2023 OWL season, team owners will vote on whether to accept an updated operating agreement. A vote against the new agreement could potentially lead to the end of the league, resulting in a $114million termination fee for Activision-Blizzard. In her address, Gschwind stated, \"The 2023 season has come to an end, and we can now look back on six years filled with memorable moments. This was more than just a show; it was a shared dream that brought together people from different countries, languages, and backgrounds. It was the hard work and commitment of everyone involved that consistently delivered the best experience for both teams and fans, and that is truly remarkable.\" As Gschwind continued to speak, both she and the Overwatch League team appeared emotional at the prospect of the league's potential end. She concluded with a thank you to the fans for their support."

        "title": "Agnes (Russian sailing ship)",
        "text": "Agnes was a Russian three-masted sailing ship, in Dutch sources stated as a full-rigged ship, during the first half of the 19th century. The vessel foundered on the shore of Texel, the Netherlands, in 1894 towards the end of a passage from New York City, United States, to Bremen, Germany.\nFate.\nIn late 1894 the ship with a draft of was on a voyage from New York City, United States to Bremen. There were officially 63 people onboard of which 41 passengers, but it is likely there were more people onboard, up to 71, because women were not counted. The passengers onboard were wealthy people who made a fortune in the United States and went back to Germany to visit family during Christmas time. The cargo of the ship contained wood and 400 barrels and baskets of tobacco. The captain of the ship was August Henrich Arensfeld.\nOn 19 December 1894, the ship ended up in a northwesterly storm. The crew adjusted the sails, however between 4am and 5am the ship became unmanageable and wrecked north of De Koog, Texel, at the level of (kilometre-interval beach mark) 22. The launch of their own lifeboat failed due to the heavy storm, the lifeboat broke and some crew members fell overboard. Due to the swirling water, crew had to climb the mast to stay out of the water.\nRescue operation.\nPeople from De Koog went to Den Hoorn (1.5 hour) and to De Cocksdorp (2.5 hour) to call for lifeboats. The rowing boat from Decocksdorp arrived at 12:00 and the boat from Den Hoorn at 13:30. The first attempt of the boat from De Cocksdorp to board failed; and due to the storm the boat drifted away from the \"Agnes\". The boat from Den Hoorn also failed to safe people. Eventually, the boat from De Cocksdorp managed to reach the boat successfully. It was described that were risking their own lives due to the bad weather to save the survivors. During the rescue attempt, the exhausted captain August Henrich Arensfeld fell into the water, but was still rescued. The captain together with some crew members were saved and brought ashore. After a three more trips a total of 19 people were saved including 7 passengers.\n13 of the 22 crew members (including the captain), and 7 of the 41 passengers were rescued by the lifeboat from Cocksdorp. The rescue workers were named heroes and were all named in the newspaper being Jacob Buijs senior (1803-1864), Jacob Buijs junior (1832-1912), Cornelis Dalmeijer, Klaas Vlaming, Willem Stark, Gerrit Stark, Cornelis List, C. van Bommel and M. Bakker. Also the director of the lifeboat from Decocksdorp mr. de Konnigh was thanked.\nOnce ashore, the captain was offered help by two men of “Zunderdorp en compagnies” named as commissioners in maritime affairs for possible salvage of the ship and its cargo. One of them was a Russian Consular Agent living in Oudeschild.\nIn the days following, 60 barrels tobacco, 80 baskets tobacco and some parts of the ship were salvaged after washing ashore. Also bodies were washing ashore.\nOn 27 December 1849 the people who survived, except the captain, went with a boat via Grijpskerk, Oldenburg to Bremen.\nBeach robbery and persecution.\nWillem Bok was made responsible for collecting the ship and the goods that would wash ashore. Willem Bok was notary, subdistrict judge, beach finder, municipal secretary, and chief of police on Texel. Bok was of the fourth generation and an important person within the Dutch patrician .\nOn 20 December 1849 Bok wrote that the ship was completely gone and it was still uncertain how much of the cargo could be saved. The next month on 12 January 1850, captain Arensfeld, who still stayed in hotel “De Lindeboom”, wrote a letter to the state council governor. He asked him for clarification because in his view there was a failing policy of Bok and Bok was accused of theft of barrels of tobacco and passengers' property.\nOn fourteen handwritten sheets Bok described in detail how everything had gone in his view. In short wrote that on 19 December 1849, he sent 33 men with 13 flat carts up to a “2-hour walk” to either side of pole 22. Pickup up the goods continued in the following day, and the return was always done in consultation with the captain. The suitcases and boxes were examined by government officials before being returned to the captain on 21 December 1849. After 21 December 1849, cargo washed up along the entire coast, mainly tabacco. On these days there were as many as 200 people out day and night, hidden between the dunes, to pick up the loose tobacco leaves and personal items of the passengers. Bok indicated that he did not have enough people to counter this predation. In his sheets, Bok did not blame the captain's accusations. Bok believed that the letter was not written by the captain himself, but by someone who wanted to smear him; just like it would have been done a previous time. This person he does not mention by name, also lived in the same hotel as were the captain stayed (“De Lindeboom”).\nOn 24 December mayor Pieter Sijbrandsz Keijser had notes printed letting people know, not to go to the beach and that tough action would be taken against theft of items from the beach. The salvage work continued until the second week in January. On January 21, the goods were auctioned, and yielded a total of 10000 Guilders. Most was paid for the ship's carcass: 2525 Guilder.\nA judicial investigation was launched in February 1849 to people who had robbed on the beach. The people of justice wanted to search the houses of the suspects, but that was canceled due to the auction. The public prosecutor wrote that in the end there was little he could do, and asked the local authorities to continue the investigation. Three people who were caught during transport or resell of tabacco were fined. In the final report of 3 June 1950 it was stated that a total of twelve people were prosecuted. Eight were fined and four were acquitted due to lack of evidence. According to the officer the number was very low and said that this was partly because people did not want to betray each other.\nNumber people onboard.\nThe exact number of people onboard is unknown. An official shipping statement from notary Ludivicus Kikkert, which was also signed by ten survivors, states 63 people: 42 passengers and 21 crew members. According to Kikkert 19 people were rescued: 12 crew members and 7 passengers, and so 44 would have died. A later interview of rescue worker Jacob Buys states the same numbers. However according to the skipper there were 71 people on board. Also, a total of 49 death certificates have been found in the national register. These certificates states who found the body, who recovered it and sometimes by which family member the body was identified. It is therefore likely that there were more than 63 people on board. One explanation is that female partners were not included."

The Huskies were coached by Bill Murdoch in his 1st season.\nSeason.\nFor the fourth consecutive season, the Huskies were led by a new head coach. The change in leadership, however, was the least of the team's worries. After a stellar 12-game campaign the year before, MCM was limited to just 4 games for the entire season and lost every single match. After starting late, the team lost a home stand to Notre Dame. Since the Irish were one of the better teams at the time, that was hardly a black mark on the program. A couple of weeks later, however, the team was swept by St. Thomas, who were a middling team at best.

The first game was swiftly arranged with Rensselaer and the team began to work on the temporary rink that had been built atop the tennis courts. The general lack of experience both with the game and with one another left the players handicapped in their opening match but the team still performed well. Middlebury limited the Engineers to just three goals and played aggressively despite their newness to the game.\nDue to their late start, the team wasn't able to schedule another game for almost a month. However, The time in between games did give the Panthers a change to fine tune their game. When they finally travelled to play Saint Michael's, Middlebury looked far more composed and played the Purple Knights evenly all game. The offense had no ability to penetrate the St. Mike's defense and were restricted to long shots that missed more often than not. Fortunetely, the Panthers' defense was just as effective and neither team was able to score in regulation. During the overtime, a rink-length rush from Papineau resulted in the only goal of the game and gave Middlebury its second loss. The rematch wasn't long in coming as the two were set to play during Middlebury's Winter Carnival on the 22nd. Ross opened the scoring with the first goal in the program's history and had his team in the lead by the midway point of the game. Saint Michael's rallied with two goals in the second half to take the match but that didn't stop the first home game for the Panthers being a huge and popular success.\nErwin Drost served as team manager and head coach.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

It is organized under the Korea e-Sports Association.\nHistory.\nSouth Korea has been known for its significant role in esports. The country has been hosting amateur esports tournaments as early as the late 1990s. In 1999, Korea e-Sports Association (KeSPA) would be established. South Korea would host the first World Cyber Games.\nThe KeSPA would become a semi-member of the Korean Sport &amp; Olympic Committee (KSOC) at a undetermined date until August 2017, when it failed to meet tighter membership standards introduced in December 2015.\nAt the 2018 Asian Games in Jakarta and Palembang, esports would be held as a demonstration event. South Korea looked to join the event but their non-membership with the KSOC at the time became an obstacle. KeSPA was able to regain semi-membership after Daejeon recognized the organization as a sporting affiliate. They were able to send a delegation to the games.\nEsports would become a regular event at the 2022 Asian Games which was held in Huangzhou. South Korea sent an esports delegation once again. Now that esports is an official medal event, this also meant that Korean players would get exemption from military service if they clinch a gold medal at the games.\nTitles.\nThe South Korean esports team has fielded teams and/or players for the following titles."

        "text": "Gerald Ralph Atkinson (January 12, 1907 – October 8, 1996) was an American businessman and football executive for the Green Bay Packers. Atkinson worked for H. C. Prange Co. in Green Bay, Wisconsin, in various capacities from 1947 to 1973. During this time, he became associated with the Packers. In 1949, he was asked to lead a campaign to help raise funds for the Packers, who had dire financial issues. This campaign, which included an intra-squad game on Thanksgiving Day, raised enough money to keep the Packers afloat. A year later he was elected to the team's board of directors, serving for 45 years until 1995. While on the board, he served an important role in helping advocate for Green Bay voters to authorize funding for New City Stadium (later renamed to Lambeau Field), which was completed in 1957. Atkinson was inducted into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame in recognition of his contributions to the team. He died on October 8, 1996, at the age of 89.\nEarly life.\nJerry Atkinson was born on January 12, 1907, in Detroit, Michigan, although he was raised in Columbus, Ohio.\nCareer.\nAtkinson moved to Green Bay, Wisconsin, in 1947 to take a job as the general merchandise manager at the local H. C. Prange Co. store. The next year he was promoted to the store's general manager. He worked for H. C. Prange Co. until 1973, when he retired as a vice president and director of the company.\nDuring his time with H. C. Prange Co., he became associated with the Green Bay Packers. Even though he was relatively new to Green Bay, he had developed a reputation as a civic-minded resident who was a capable fundraiser. In 1949, Packers leadership, including head coach and general manager Curly Lambeau, team president Emil R. Fischer and treasurer Frank Jonet, approached Atkinson and requested his help in raising enough money from the community to keep the Packers from going insolvent. Atkinson and a number of other Packers supporters helped organize a funding drive with a goal of . As part of the drive, an intra-squad game was held on Thanksgiving Day, with ticket sales helping to raise over $40,000. These funds helped the Packers finish the season and combined with a stock sale in 1950, which Atkinson helped organize, got the Packers out of debt and back on a solid financial footing. Atkinson was elected to the Packers' board of directors in 1950 and then to the executive committee in 1958. He served on both until 1985, when he transitioned to \"emeritus\" status. During his time on the board of directors, he served on various committees, including those related to building New City Stadium (later renamed to Lambeau Field) in 1957 and search committees for new head coaches. As part of the drive to build a new stadium for the Packers, he co-chaired (along with Tony Canadeo) the Citizens Committee for the Stadium Team, which helped advocate for Green Bay voters to authorize a bond measure to raise almost to go towards stadium construction. He also was the chairman of a group of local Packers fans in the 1940s and 1950s known as the \"Green Bay Minute Men\" who advocated for causes related to the team. In 1988, he was inducted into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame in recognition of his contributions to the team.\nPersonal life.\nAtkinson had one child, a daughter. He was a member of a local Elks Lodge and was an avid bowler. He was active in multiple plans for the redevelopment of downtown Green Bay, both in 1956 and 1980. He died on October 8, 1996, at the age of 89, in Worthington, Ohio."

        "title": "Independent Commission for Equity in Cricket",
        "text": "The Independent Commission for Equity in Cricket (ICEC) was a commission set up in 2021 to investigate racial equality, gender equality and social equality in English cricket. The report was published in June 2023 and detailed widespread racism, sexism and elitism in the game. On 25 September 2023, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) responded to the report and said they had begun working on new procedures to remedy many of the problems highlighted.\nHistory.\nThe commission was requested by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) in 2021 to respond to the Yorkshire County Cricket Club racism scandal. The ICEC's evidence-gathering received a large response after English cricket was called institutionally racist by Azeem Rafiq at the UK government's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee. In June 2023, the report was published; it was 317 pages long and took evidence from over 4,000 people. Those giving evidence included the current England men's Test captain Ben Stokes, the current women's captain Heather Knight, Joe Root, World Cup-winning skipper Eoin Morgan and Azeem Rafiq - the former Yorkshire player whose allegations of racism at the county were largely responsible for the setting up of the ICEC.\nCommission members.\nThe members of the ICEC were:\nFindings.\nThe ECB were praised for commissioning the report and opening the game up to wholesale scrutiny. Entitled \"Holding up a mirror to cricket\", the report was damning and made 44 recommendations for the ECB to consider. The report gives numerous examples of a racist, sexist, elitist and homophobic comments at the highest and lowest levels. There is also a culture of drinking alcohol that alienates women, children and people from ethnically diverse communities.\nRacism.\nA deep-seated issue of racism is described in cricket. It says that racism in cricket is not confined to \"pockets\" or \"a few bad apples\". The report described the routine use of racial slurs and players being told to \"go back home\".\nElitism.\nThe report states that class-based discrimination and elitism is prevalent within the game of cricket. Much of which is structural and institutional in nature, caused partly by the lack of cricket in state schools and partly by a pervasive web of patronage and \"old boy networks\" that exist within the county game, that favour players from private schools.\nCounty age and academy coaches, whose job is to recruit the best junior talent are routinely employed by fee-paying schools creating a conflict of interest that favours selection of the private schools' students ahead of more able state-schooled or Asian players.\nA further conflict of interest occurs where the parents of a junior player privately recruit county coaches, often at great expense. The coaches then favour that player for places in the county setup ahead of more able juniors whose parents cannot afford to pay.\nIn 2023, 45 per cent of professional cricketers had attended a private school, although the privately educated make up less than 7% of the population. Amongst white English players in county academies, those at fee paying schools are 13 times more likely to become professional cricketers.\nThe commonality of privately educated children in the county setup has led to state-schooled players being called peasants and otherwise insulted.\nSexism.\nThe report states that it has heard evidence of \"a widespread culture of sexism and misogyny, and unacceptable behaviour towards women in both the recreational and professional game\". Predatory sexual behaviour is also described.\nResponse to the report.\nSport England wrote: \"It's essential that today's report leads to significant and lasting change and cricket as a sport must seize this opportunity to ensure it becomes a safe, welcoming and empowering environment for everyone.\"\nOn 30 August the ECB announced that, with immediate effect, the international match fees for England women cricketers would be increased to be the same as for the men, in accordance with one of the ICEC's recommendations. Previously women had been paid 25% of men's fees for white-ball and 15% for Tests. \nOn 19 September the ECB gave a brief outline of how they planned to address the report's 44 recommendations, at a meeting of county chief executives and other stakeholders. Their response would include diversity training for all those employed in professional cricket.\nOn 25 September the ECB published its formal response to the report. They accepted \"most\" of the ICEC report's 44 recommendations, including the setting up of an independent regulator for the game. The ECB's chief executive, Richard Gould, said: \"The ICEC report was a massive moment for the sport and a responsibility we take extremely seriously, to bring about the changes we all want to see.\"\nThe ECB chairman, Richard Thompson, said: \"Cricket hasn't got it right in the past, but this is an opportunity to move forwards together. I'd urge everyone to now come together, to put their energy and effort into delivering these actions, and to playing their part in ensuring cricket becomes England and Wales' most inclusive team sport.\"\nThe ECB response says that the ICEC report asked them to carry out about 137 actions in total (some of the 44 recommendations have multiple sub-clauses), and that they have a \"positive direction of travel\" on 94% of them. However they said that it was not yet possible to commit to all the ICEC's recommendations on equal pay and prize money for men and women in both international and domestic cricket because - \"the gap between the value of commercial and media rights for the men's and women's games is still vast. By creating a thriving, viable and robust future for women's and girls' cricket at every level of the game, we can make real progress in closing that gap.\" \"The amount of money that the ECB's got to invest in the game as a whole is not infinite,\" Claire Taylor told BBC Sport. \"The ECB is working within its current knowledge of what its revenues are likely to be from its broadcast deals and so forth over the next few years.\nIn early December the ECB announced that they were setting up an independent regulator whose remit would include safeguarding, anti-corruption, anti-doping and anti-discrimination. It is to be ring-fenced from the rest of the ECB and a new independent cricket regulatory board will be set up to oversee its work. Dave Lewis, a former police officer, was named as interim director, with a permanent director to be appointed in 2024."

It was a best-of-seven playoff played between the American League (AL) champion Texas Rangers and the National League (NL) champion Arizona Diamondbacks. The series began on October 27 and ended on November 1 with Texas winning in five games. The Rangers won their first World Series title since their founding in 1961.\nThe Rangers and Diamondbacks entered the 2023 MLB postseason as wild cards. This was the third World Series meeting between two wild cards following 2002 and 2014. The Rangers had home-field advantage in the series over the Diamondbacks due to their better regular season record. The Rangers and Diamondbacks split the first two games in Texas before the Rangers won three consecutive games in Arizona to win the series. Corey Seager won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award for the second time in his career.\nBackground.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Texas Rangers and the Arizona Diamondbacks. Both teams lost over 100 games in 2021. The teams' 174 combined wins is the lowest ever total for a non-shortened season World Series. This was the first World Series between one team that has never won in any prior appearances and another team that has never lost in any prior appearances. MLB has paired these two teams up as interleague rivals from 1998 to 2000 and in 2013, 2019, and since 2023. This was the fifth straight World Series to have games played in a venue in Texas, with Houston co-hosting in 2019, 2021, and 2022, and Arlington hosting in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, this was the first World Series since 2016 to not feature the Houston Astros or Los Angeles Dodgers.\nThe Diamondbacks won the regular season series 3–1, splitting a two-game series in May at Globe Life Field, and sweeping the Rangers at Chase Field in August.\nThis was the third time in World Series history that the two teams that faced each other were both from the Expansion era, the first coming in 2015 and the second in 2019.\nThis was the sixth World Series overall to be played entirely on artificial turf. Before 2023, the most recent of the six to be played in the two home team’s stadiums was the 1993 World Series (which was the fourth one). However, the last “all-artificial turf” overall (the fifth one) before 2023 had been at the neutrally located 2020 World Series, with all games played at Globe Life Field, where the first two games of 2023 were also played. 2023 is only the second World Series to be played entirely on the second generation artificial turf (with 2020 being the first).\nTexas Rangers.\nDuring the regular season, the Texas Rangers were led by an AL-best offense in runs scored and were tied with the Minnesota Twins in home runs. The Rangers led the AL at the All-Star Game with six players in Adolis García, Jonah Heim, Josh Jung, Corey Seager, Marcus Semien, and Nathan Eovaldi. Mid-season injuries to staff-aces Jacob deGrom and Eovaldi and subpar performance in the bullpen led the Rangers to acquire closer Aroldis Chapman, middle reliever Chris Stratton, and starting pitchers Jordan Montgomery and Max Scherzer. Despite leading the AL West for most of the season, poor play late in the year saw the team finish second in the division behind the Houston Astros; the teams had identical win-loss records, but Houston owned a better head-to-head record.\nThe Rangers qualified for the postseason as the fifth seed wild card entrant in the American League just two years removed from a 102-loss season. In the Wild Card Series, they swept the fourth-seeded Tampa Bay Rays. In the Division Series, they swept the American League East division winner and top-seeded Baltimore Orioles. In the American League Championship Series, they defeated their division rival and defending World Series champion Houston Astros in seven games to win their third American League pennant in franchise history. The Rangers made it to the World Series for the first time since 2011, where they lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games. The Rangers were heading in as the favorites to win the series for the first time all postseason while also seeking their first World Series title in franchise history, which would put an end to their World Series championship title drought of 62 seasons since their franchise began, the second-longest active championship drought in Major League Baseball behind the Cleveland Guardians and the oldest active franchise without a World Series title. This also marked a return to the World Series for three-time World Champion Bruce Bochy, who was looking to tie Walter Alston and Joe Torre for fourth on the list of World Series victories for managers.\nTexas came into the season with 50–1 betting odds, which was tied for the seventh-longest odds to make a World Series since 1985.\nArizona Diamondbacks.\nThe Diamondbacks were just two seasons removed from a 110–loss season, which included an MLB-record 24 straight road losses. They had an uneven regular season in 2023, which included extreme highs and lows. At their peak in mid-June, they were 41–25 and leading the NL West. At their lowest, they had a 32-game stretch, where from early–July to mid–August, they went 7–25, a .219 win percentage, and had fallen to 57–59. They were led by a young core consisting of Corbin Carroll, Zac Gallen, Gabriel Moreno, Alek Thomas, and Geraldo Perdomo, along with veterans Ketel Marte, Merrill Kelly, Christian Walker, Lourdes Gurriel Jr., Tommy Pham, and Evan Longoria. The Diamondbacks team finished second in MLB in stolen bases behind the Cincinnati Reds, including 56 from Carroll. They were also the best defensive team during the season, committing the fewest errors in the regular season with 56 and tied for first with the Rangers with the best fielding percentage at .990. \nThe Diamondbacks qualified for the postseason as the sixth seed wild card entrant in the National League. In the Wild Card Series, they swept the third-seeded and National League Central division winner Milwaukee Brewers. In the Division Series, they swept and upset the National League West division winner, second-seeded, and 100-win Los Angeles Dodgers. In the National League Championship Series, they defeated the fourth-seeded and defending National League champion Philadelphia Phillies in seven games to win their second National League pennant and make it to the World Series for the first time since 2001. The 84 wins is the lowest amount for a full season NL champion since the 2006 St. Louis Cardinals, who had 83 wins. The Diamondbacks also joined the 1987 Minnesota Twins as the only two teams to win a pennant with a negative run differential. Arizona's revamped bullpen of Ryan Thompson, rookie Andrew Saalfrank, setup man Kevin Ginkel, and closer Paul Sewald, had a combined 1.45 ERA in 31 innings of work entering the World Series.\nAt 125–1 preseason odds, Arizona had the third-longest odds to make a World Series since 1985 and longest since the Tampa Bay Rays in 2008, which Diamondbacks player Evan Longoria was also part of during his rookie season. Additionally, the 15 year gap between Longoria's first and second World Series appearances from 2008 to 2023 is the longest for a position player in MLB history.\nGame summaries.\nGame 1.\nR&amp;B singer H.E.R. sang the national anthem. Former President of the United States and former Rangers part-owner George W. Bush threw out the ceremonial first pitch to former Rangers Hall of Fame catcher Iván Rodríguez. Nathan Eovaldi was the starting pitcher for Texas, while Zac Gallen started for Arizona.\nTexas's Evan Carter hit a double off the base of the right field wall to score Corey Seager. Adolis García scored Carter with a single, making it 2–0 Texas. In the top of the third, with runners on second and third, Corbin Carroll tripled, scoring both runners and tying the game. Ketel Marte scored Carroll on a fielder's choice, giving Arizona a one-run lead. The Rangers loaded the bases in the bottom of the third, where Gallen walked Mitch Garver to tie the game at three. Gallen limited the damage as Jonah Heim flied out to end the inning. In the top of the fourth, Tommy Pham hit a solo home run, which gave Arizona a lead they would not give up until the bottom of the ninth. In the fifth, Marte added on a run for Arizona with a double that scored Geraldo Perdomo and took Eovaldi out of the game. In the bottom of the sixth, Gallen was replaced with Ryan Thompson. After Thompson walked Heim, Nathaniel Lowe hit a towering fly ball that was caught by Carroll on the warning track. If the ball had been hit out, it would have tied the game. Thompson was able to get out of the jam by striking out Leody Taveras. Arizona relievers Joe Mantiply and Kevin Ginkel kept the seventh and the eighth innings scoreless.\nWill Smith retired the side in the top of the ninth, sending the game to the bottom of the ninth, where closer Paul Sewald was sent in to record the final three outs for Arizona. With Arizona still leading 5–3, Sewald gave up a leadoff walk to Taveras before striking out Marcus Semien. The next batter, Seager, hit a towering two-run home run to right field to tie the game at five. It was Sewald's first blown save of this postseason in seven opportunities; however he then struck out Carter and Austin Hedges to send the game to extra innings. José Leclerc retired the side in the top of the tenth. The bottom of the tenth started well for Texas, with Kyle Nelson giving up a leadoff walk to Lowe. However, Josh Jung grounded into a double play. Nelson then walked Taveras and gave up a single to Semien, but got the hero of the ninth inning, Seager, to ground out, ending the inning. Leclerc once again retired the side in the top of the eleventh, giving Texas another chance to walk it off. After getting Carter to fly out in the bottom of the inning, Nelson was replaced with Miguel Castro, who was sent in to face García. On a 3–1 count, Garcia hit a walk-off home run to right field to win the game for Texas. With the home run, García recorded his 22nd RBI of the postseason, breaking the record for RBIs in a postseason, previously held by David Freese, who recorded 21 RBIs in the 2011 postseason.\nGame 2.\nThe national anthem was sung by 18-year-old Pearle Peterson. Former Rangers Hall of Fame third baseman Adrián Beltré threw out the ceremonial first pitch to former Rangers Hall of Fame pitcher Ferguson Jenkins. Merrill Kelly started Game 2 for Arizona while Jordan Montgomery started for Texas.\nArizona opened the scoring in the fourth inning, when Gabriel Moreno hit a solo home run followed by a double by Tommy Pham and an RBI single by Lourdes Gurriel Jr. Mitch Garver hit a solo home run in the bottom of the fifth to put the Rangers on the board at 2–1, thereby cutting their deficit to one run. Arizona added two insurance runs in the seventh inning when an RBI single by Evan Longoria scored Alek Thomas, and another RBI single by Corbin Carroll scored Longoria. With the bases loaded in the eighth inning, Ketel Marte hit a two-run RBI single, and then Carroll hit an RBI single to expand the lead to 7–1. With his hit, Marte extended his postseason hitting streak to 18 games, setting a major league record. In the top of the ninth, Emmanuel Rivera hit a two-out two-run RBI single to score Jace Peterson and Gurriel Jr. to extend the Diamondbacks' lead to 9–1 before Rivera was out on a throw to second to end the inning. The Diamondbacks evened the series at one game apiece.\nGame 3.\nAfter starter Max Scherzer was taken out of the game, reliever Jon Gray pitched three shutout innings for Texas.\nAmerican Idol winner and Arizona native Jordin Sparks performed the national anthem before Game 3. Former Diamondback Hall of Fame pitcher Randy Johnson threw out the ceremonial first pitch to former Diamondback outfielder Luis Gonzalez. Brandon Pfaadt was the Game 3 starter for Arizona while Max Scherzer started for Texas.\nArizona threatened to score first in the second inning, but Christian Walker was thrown out at home plate by Adolis García. In the third inning, Marcus Semien hit an RBI single for Texas, followed by a two-run home run by Corey Seager, giving the Rangers a 3–0 lead. Scherzer exited the game in the middle of the fourth inning with back tightness; Jon Gray entered in relief. Ketel Marte extended his post-season record hitting streak to 19 straight games with a single in the sixth inning. Gray exited the game after three innings, giving up only one hit and striking out three, preserving the Rangers lead. Emmanuel Rivera doubled to lead off the eighth inning and later put the Diamondbacks on the board with an RBI single by Geraldo Perdomo, cutting their deficit to 3–1, but Aroldis Chapman forced Marte, representing the potential tying run at the plate, to ground into an inning-ending double play. José Leclerc came in to pitch a scoreless ninth inning for the save, giving the Rangers a 2–1 series lead. García left the game early with a side strain. With the win, Texas remained unbeaten (9–0) in road games this postseason.\nGame 4.\nThe national anthem was performed by country music artist Mickey Guyton. Arizona State University alumnus and former Masters Champion Jon Rahm threw out the ceremonial first pitch. Andrew Heaney started Game 4 for Texas while Arizona started Joe Mantiply as an opener. Before the start of Game 4, the Rangers replaced Adolis García and Max Scherzer on their World Series roster following their respective injuries in Game 3 with infielder Ezequiel Durán and relief pitcher Brock Burke.\nJosh Jung led off the second inning for Texas with a double. After he advanced to third base, he scored the first run of the game off of a wild pitch by Miguel Castro, who relieved Mantiply. Leody Taveras drew a walk and Travis Jankowski hit a single, followed by a two-RBI triple by Marcus Semien. Kyle Nelson relieved Castro, and allowed a two-run home run to Corey Seager. Texas scored another five runs in the third inning after Jung and Nathaniel Lowe hit singles, Jonah Heim reached base on a fielder's choice to load the bases, Jankowski hit a two-RBI double, and Semien hit a three-run home run. Arizona scored their first run on a sacrifice fly by Lourdes Gurriel Jr. in the fourth inning. Heim's home run leading off the top of the eighth inning extended the Rangers lead to 11–1. In the bottom half of the eighth inning, Tommy Pham hit an RBI sacrifice fly for Arizona, scoring Corbin Carroll, and Gurriel hit a three-run home run to reduce their deficit to 11–5. In the ninth inning, Will Smith recorded two outs, but the Diamondbacks put two men on base. José Leclerc entered the game and gave up a two-run RBI single to Gabriel Moreno, but finished the game with a pop-up by Christian Walker. With the win, the Rangers put themselves one win away from their first-ever World Series championship. This also extended the Rangers' 2023 postseason road win streak to ten games.\nGame 5.\nThe national anthem was performed by Dinah Jane. Tyler Moldovan, an officer in the Phoenix Police Department who was injured on duty, threw out the ceremonial first pitch. Game 5 featured a pitching rematch of Game 1 between Zac Gallen for the Diamondbacks and Nathan Eovaldi for the Rangers.\nIn a pitcher's duel, Gallen did not allow a hit in six innings. Meanwhile, Arizona had a scoring opportunity with runners on second and third base in the third inning, but Eovaldi retired Tommy Pham on a groundout. The Diamondbacks loaded the bases in the fifth inning but again failed to score. The Rangers ended Gallen's no-hit bid in the seventh inning on Corey Seager's single in left field; Seager scored on an RBI single by Mitch Garver. In the top of the eighth, Kevin Ginkel escaped the one-out bases-loaded jam to end the Rangers threat of another scoring opportunity. A single by Jonah Heim in the ninth inning combined with a fielding error by Alek Thomas scored two more runs for Texas, and then Marcus Semien hit a two-run home run to expand the lead to 5–0. Josh Sborz recorded the final outs, with Ketel Marte striking out to conclude the season and his first save as the Rangers won the game and the first World Series championship in franchise history, ending a 63-year drought. Seager won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award and was the first player ever to win the award in two different leagues. \nTexas finished the postseason with a perfect 11–0 in road games. Marte's 20-game postseason hit streak ended with Game 5, having walked three times and struck out once to end the World Series. \nTexas manager Bruce Bochy won his fourth World Series championship, becoming the third manager ever to win World Series championships in both leagues, after Sparky Anderson and Tony LaRussa. Corey Seager, Nathan Eovaldi, Max Scherzer, and Aroldis Chapman all won their second World Series championship. Texas pitcher Will Smith became the first player in history to win three consecutive World Series championships with three different franchises, having previously won with the 2021 Atlanta Braves and the 2022 Houston Astros.\nComposite line score.\n2023 World Series (4–1): Texas Rangers beat Arizona Diamondbacks\nBroadcasting.\nTelevision.\nFor the 24th consecutive year, the World Series was televised in the United States by Fox.

The ABPA's objective is to grow the game and the players’ position as genuine partners in shaping the future of Australian Basketball, through representing, protecting, advocating and promoting Australia's basketball players in their best interests and for the benefit of basketball in Australia. The Australian Basketball Players' Association adopted its current name in 2019 as part of an organisational rebrand; the rebrand placed players as central to the organisations name and logo, in order to recognise that the players are at the heart of everything the organisation does.\nIn December 2018, the ABPA helped to negotiate the inaugural National Teams Collective Bargaining Agreement with Basketball Australia; the CBA will be in place until 2022, and provided improved working conditions, improved travel conditions, better contract provisions and protections, and a revenue share model.\nAfter successfully negotiating a WMBL Parental and Pregnancy Care Policy in October 2018, in March 2019, the ABPA negotiated the WNBL's first ever Collective Bargaining Agreement, which provided an increase in the minimum payment for WNBL players in 2019, with WNBL players provided access to improved health care and other basic conditions such as advanced scheduling, improved travel conditions and professional services, as well as guaranteed a minimum base wage of $13,000 for the 2019–20 and 2020-20 WNBL seasons; this amounted to a 73% increase from the previous season.\nIn 2021, the ABPA committed $350,000 to a fund to support players who were directly impacted by the changes in salary and extension to the length of the NBL season as a result of COVID-19 pandemic-imposed changes.\nIn September 2023, the ABPA successfully negotiated a new Collective Bargaining Agreement with the NBL. Under the terms of the new CBA, the NBL Salary Cap and Floor will by 7% in 2023/24 and will continue to grow between 4% and 7% over the next two seasons, the minimum wage will increase in line with increases to the salary cap and floor, provides for a minimum of two Development Players at each club, provides greater protections incorporated into the Standard Player Contract, implements NBL and club contributions to the ABPA's Wellbeing and Engagement services for players, incorporating mental health, wellbeing, professional and personal development support and advice, as well as flexibility for future League expansion initiatives."

        "text": "The 2023–24 Wright State Raiders men's basketball team represented Wright State University in the 2023–24 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The Raiders, led by eighth-year head coach Scott Nagy, played their home games at the Nutter Center in Dayton, Ohio as members of the Horizon League.\nSeason summary.\n2023-24 began with high expectations. The return of star shooting guard Tanner Holden to the team alongside point guard Trey Calvin put two eventual 2,000 point scorers in the starting lineup. Brandon Noel returned at power forward following his Horizon League Freshman of the Year season, and junior AJ Braun returned for his third year as starting center. Veterans Andrew Welage and Alex Huibregtse rounded out the main rotation. The only unexpected loss was the physical reserve forward Blake Sisley, who left basketball to concentrate on school. \nFunny things happen with expectations, and reality came crashing down as the season began with a 28-point thrashing by fellow mid-major Colorado State, followed by losses to Toledo and Indiana. The remainder of the non-conference schedule was a middling win-one/ lose-one slog. \nThe Raiders began the Horizon League season in a hole with road losses both to surprising Green Bay and to Milwaukee. When the season might have been salvaged, a tired team fell apart down the stretch at Youngstown. The home court became anything but an advantage with shocking home losses to Green Bay, Youngstown State, Oakland and Purdue Fort Wayne. The season ended with an overtime home loss to rival Northern Kentucky, a rematch just five days after an emotional win on the same court. \nAll throughout the season, the Raiders could score. They led the nation (363 teams) in shooting percentage (53%) and were top 5 in points per game (86.5). Center AJ Braun led the nation in individual shooting percentage (68.9%). But, as so often the case, as good as they were on offense they were that bad on defense giving up 3-pointers and lay-ups with equal grace finishing 341st in defensive efficiency.\nThe individual stats followed the team stats as all five starters averaged double-digits, including guard Alex Huibregtse who had a breakout year. Redshirt Freshmen Logan Woods, Kaden Brown and Drey Carter all logged productive minutes off the bench. Andrew Welage’s season was hampered by injuries and illness, but he gave all he had and had a standout game against Indiana.\nAftermath.\nAfter the season of high expectations concluded with an opening game home tournament loss, Wright State said good-bye to star guards Trey Calvin and Tanner Holden, as expected. Andrew Welage also hung up his sneakers and graduated. Center AJ Braun decided to parlay his impressive stats into some NIL money by entering the transfer portal, and head coach Scott Nagy disappeared to Southern Illinois in a cloud of private-jet smoke.\nPrevious season.\nThe Raiders finished the 2022–23 season 18–15, 10–10 in Horizon League play\nto finish tied for sixth place.\nAs the No. 7 seed, they defeated Green Bay,\nbefore losing in the quarter finals to No. 2 seed Milwaukee.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=| Horizon League tournament\nSources"

However, with the economic crisis, the Club changed its dynamics and the coaches did not continue.\nRivera later joined the Permanent Concentration of the Royal Spanish Volleyball Federation, as assistant to Ricardo Maldonado, where he was between the 2009-2010 and 2013–2014 seasons.\nThe summer of 2014, in addition to working with the National Team, served him to sign for Club Volleyball Teruel, under the guidance of Carlos \"Charly\" Carreño, who was his assistant at the Teruel club in the 2014-2015 and 2015–2016 seasons. In March 2016, the club's board decided to dispense with Carreño and give the team's controls to Miguel Rivera, who led the team to the Superliga final that season.\nThe successes achieved with Club Volleyball Teruel helped him to be appointed National Men's Coach in January 2022. At the head of the National Team he won the silver medal at the Mediterranean Games 2022, after losing in the final against Croatia 3–1. He also qualified for EuroVolley 2023, after 6 wins in as many games in the Qualifying Phase.\nAfter six successful seasons, in April 2022 Club Volleyball Teruel announced that Miguel Rivera would not be the coach for the following season.\nDuring the 2022–23 season he did not coach any clubs, dedicating himself exclusively to his role as Men's National Coach. However, in May 2023, Club Volleyball Haris announced that Rivera would be the coach of the La Laguna team for the following two seasons."

The field for the Derby was limited to 20 horses, with up to four 'also eligibles' in case of a late withdrawal from the field. There were three separate paths for horses to take to qualify for the Derby: the main Road consisting of races in North America (plus one in Dubai), the Japan Road consisting of four races in Japan, and the European road consisting of seven races in England, Ireland and France. The top five finishers in the specified races received points, with higher points awarded in the major prep races in March and April. Earnings in non-restricted stakes races acted as a tie breaker.\nFor 2024, there are several changes in the Road to the Kentucky Derby.

        "title": "College rugby in the United States",
        "text": "College rugby is played by men and women throughout colleges and universities in the United States. Seven-a-side and fifteen-a-side variants of rugby union are most commonly played. Most collegiate rugby programs do not fall under the auspices of the NCAA and are instead governed by National Collegiate Rugby and USA Rugby, two nationwide governing bodies. 27 women's programs participate in the NCAA.\nCollege rugby is the fastest growing college sport in the US and one of the fastest growing sports in the nation as the number of athletes increased by roughly 350% from 18,500 in 2006 to 65,000 in 2010. Women's rugby is an NCAA Emerging Sport. Over 900 college teams—male and female—are registered with USA Rugby and hundreds more with National Collegiate Rugby. Over 32,000 college players are registered with USA Rugby, making college rugby the largest section of its membership.\nThe highest profile college rugby sevens competition is the Collegiate Rugby Championship (CRC). College club rugby has included several championship competitions since 1980.\nRugby has been played in universities since as early as the 1800s, but in the 1960s rugby found a foothold in colleges, led by Catholic colleges such as Notre Dame and particularly Jesuit universities such as Boston College and St. Joseph's in Philadelphia. Several schools have upgraded their investments in rugby by creating programs with varsity or quasi-varsity status and funding for scholarships.\nAlumni from collegiate programs make up much of the United States men's and women's national teams.\nMajor League Rugby implemented its first collegiate MLR Draft in 2020. Players are eligible for the draft after 3 years in college at 21 years old. Free agents can join teams at age 18.\nGovernance.\nThe College Rugby Association of America (CRAA) oversees the top-level men's and women's divisions.\n27 schools govern their women's teams under applicable NCAA bylaws for recruiting and eligibility, under the NCAA's Emerging Sports for Women program. The NCAA has no authority over men's college rugby.\nCollege rugby is often called a club sport because teams are usually administered by a student club sports department rather than the intercollegiate athletics department. Some schools promoted rugby to varsity status, committing resources for scholarships and paid coaches, or given rugby an elevated status short of full varsity status.\nHistory.\nIn the United States, college rugby was traditionally governed by (in descending order of authority): USA Rugby, geographical unions (GUs) and local area unions (LAUs) (e.g., NERFU) and administered by a College Management Committee.\nThe Ivy Rugby Conference formed in 2009. This move signaled a shift away from the LAUs and GUs as the governing bodies for regional college rugby.\nBy 2011 USA Rugby was urging college rugby programs to adopt new conference structures like the conferences used by their other athletic programs.\nIn 2019, in the wake of USA Rugby's bankruptcy declaration, the College Rugby Association of America (CRAA) formed to oversee the top-level men's and women's divisions.\nPlay and participation.\nWinter and spring are the primary seasons for conferences in the Pacific, Northwest, and South regions (e.g., PAC, Southeastern); the fall is the primary season for conferences in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Upper Midwest (e.g., Big Ten, Atlantic Coast). Conferences establish playing schedules in the primary season, while in the secondary season the teams often set up friendly matches or focus on playing rugby sevens.\nUSA Rugby maintains player eligibility guidelines, administered by the local area unions. College players generally have five years of rugby eligibility from the time they graduate high school. On-field disciplinary issues are generally handled by the local area unions, while off-field disciplinary issues are governed by the academic institution and the local area union. USA Rugby's CIPP insurance program provides liability insurance to players, teams, administrators, and pitch hosts in exchange for an annual dues payment. Roughly one quarter of college rugby programs offer financial aid to their players.\nOutstanding college rugby players are recognized as All-Americans. Qualified All-Americans can represent the United States in international tournaments by playing on the United States national under-20 rugby union team or the All Americans rugby union team.\nDivisions.\nCollege rugby competition in the USA is divided into several tiers:\nUSA Rugby generally allows colleges to select the division in which the college thinks it would fit best. Most schools remain in the same division from year-to-year, but there are exceptions. Schools that have been successful in a particular division may move up but are not required to do so; likewise, poorly performing schools may move down a division, but are not required to. Successful schools may have varied reasons for declining promotion. For example, a school may prefer to remain in its current conference against traditional rivals, or a school with a small budget might resist the additional travel expense that might come from switching divisions and conferences.\nSignificant movement across men's divisions occurred in 2011 when USA Rugby separated Division I into Division I-A and I-AA. This new arrangement caused Division I schools to choose one or the other, with 31 schools joining Division I-A and the majority of Division I schools joining Division I-AA. Additionally, the creation of Division I-AA caused several successful Division II schools to move up to Division I-A. The evolving division structures caused significant shifts in schools between Divisions I-A and I-AA in the following years, with half of the original 31 D I-A members leaving by the end of 2013, and new schools from lower divisions taking their place.\nThe governance of collegiate rugby was split and diverged in 2021. The umbrella of the USA Rugby Collegiate Council includes College Rugby Association of America (CRAA), American Collegiate Rugby Association (ACRA), American College Rugby (ACR), and independent conferences. National Collegiate Rugby (NCR), formerly NSCRO, challenged the existing structure and expanded beyond small colleges to include the higher divisions. Men's and women's conferences each chose as individual conferences (in some cases, schools within conferences also chose) to align with USA Rugby or NCR.\nWomen.\nTwelve women's conferences that played historically in DII left the oversight of USA Rugby to join NCR. Beginning in 2021, women's college rugby within NCR is split between Small College and an Open Division. The Open Division, which NCR now refers to as its DI, is made up of teams from these 12 conferences.\nAccording to \"Goff Rugby Report\", the DI Elite women's teams are part of College Rugby Association of America, and so are most women's DI conferences (eight conferences) and the independents. There are also a couple of DII or hybrid conferences within CRAA.\nThe American Collegiate Rugby Association is a group of four DII-level women's conferences remaining under the aegis of USA Rugby, which included 62 teams as of June 2020.\nThe collegiate women's programs in the NIRA operate their own regular season competition and championship.\nMen.\nIn 2021, most DII men's rugby conferences aligned with NCR.\nIn 2011 USA Rugby created a new Division 1-A with approximately 30 schools forming a new premier division.\nTwo men's conferences that played DIA in 2019 joined NCR in 2021, as have three DIAA conferences. Under NCR, they competed in fall 2021 as DI and DIAA, with separate postseasons.\nMen's DIAA was dramatically split in 2021, with both NCR and CRAA-run postseasons in the fall. There was also a CRAA-run postseason in spring 2022. According to \"Goff Rugby Report\", there was no way to have a sole men's DIAA national champion in 2021–2022.\nIn 2021, there are five men's DIA conferences plus independents under USA Rugby/CRAA.\nVarsity programs.\nMen's varsity.\nMajority of colleges classify their rugby programs as club sports rather than varsity sports. A small but growing number of universities, however, have begun labeling rugby as a varsity sport, realizing that rugby can be profitable, as a successful rugby program can result in national championships and increased marketability.\nWomen's Rugby: An NCAA Emerging Sport.\nThe NCAA marked women's rugby as an NCAA Emerging Sports for Women in 2002. Thereafter schools began adding women's rugby as an NCAA sport. An \"Emerging Sport\" must gain championship status (minimum 40 varsity programs, except 28 for Division III) within 10 years, or show progress toward that goal to remain on the list. Until then, it is under the auspices of the NCAA and its respective institutions. Emerging Sport status allows competition to include club teams to satisfy the NCAA's minimum number of competitions rule.\nGrowth was initially slow, with only 5 of nearly 350 collegiate teams qualifying. The push for NCAA rugby status received a boost in 2009 when the International Olympic Committee announced that rugby would return to the Summer Olympics in 2016. Although NCAA Division I schools dropped 72 women's varsity sports teams during 2008–2012 due to the recession, women's rugby programs grew in number.\nAs of the fall of 2022, the NCAA had sanctioned rugby for 27 schools across 3 Divisions, adding Princeton University for the 2022–23 season. Current NCAA women's rugby programs include the following:\nDivision 1 National Championships (15s).\nMen's National Championship.\nSports Illustrated named Notre Dame national champion in 1966. In 1967, Sports Illustrated named California national champions after their 37–3 defeat of Notre Dame.\n1980–2012.\nExcept for interruption by the COVID-19 pandemic, USA Rugby has crowned an official national men's champion each year since 1980. After the 2010 season, USA Rugby split Division 1 into two, with the top flight called Division 1-A Rugby (formerly called the College Premier Division), and the second flight called Division 1-AA.\n2013–2017.\nIn 2013, eight of the top college rugby teams withdrew from the USA Rugby D1A competition and organized their own championship called the Varsity Cup. The media and other rugby commentators viewed the Varsity Cup as equivalent to the USA Rugby D1A championship, given the strength of the teams participating and the fact that the 2013 Varsity Cup finalists – BYU and Cal – finished the spring 2013 season as the consensus #1 and #2 ranked teams in all of college rugby. Four additional schools joined the Varsity Cup for 2014, bringing the number of teams in that tournament to twelve. The Varsity Cup was successful in gaining media exposure, with the 2014 Varsity Cup final televised live on NBCSN. USA Rugby responded to the successful promotion of its Varsity Cup rivals by signing a ten-year contract in October 2014 with IMG that would focus on the marketing and increase exposure of USA Rugby's Collegiate National Championship. The Varsity Cup folded in November 2017 when the organizer, broadcast partner and a major sponsor, Penn Mutual, withdrew their support.\nThe lists below show the champions for the Division 1-A Rugby and the Varsity Cup championships for each year, along with the teams' final regular season rankings, as ranked by RugbyMag/RugbyToday.com.\nWomen's National Championship.\nThe following are the results from the Division 1 women's national championship, from 1991 to the present. USA Rugby established a new division called \"Division 1 Elite\" that began championship competition in 2016, following which the remainder of Division 1 was called \"Division 1 Club\".\nCollege Rugby Sevens.\nSince the 2009 announcement that rugby sevens will be included in the 2016 Olympics, college rugby sevens has grown more popular. The addition of Rugby 7s to the 2016 Summer Olympics has led to increasing interest from TV and other media coverage, and an increased emphasis in the collegiate ranks on the 7s game. For example, the University of Texas founded its competitive rugby sevens program in 2010. Cal rugby announced in December 2011 that beginning in 2013 it would use the fall term for sevens.\nCollegiate Rugby Championship.\nThe Collegiate Rugby Championship (CRC) is the highest profile college sevens rugby championship in the United States. The inaugural CRC, held in Columbus, Ohio in June 2010 was televised live by NBC and NBC Universal. The result was high ratings, with the CRC ratings beating the NCAA lacrosse championship.\nThe success of the inaugural 2010 tournament led to a second tournament in 2011 at PPL Park in Philadelphia, again televised live by NBC. NBC recognized that rugby is growing in popularity, participation, and interest. In 2014, the Penn Mutual Life Insurance company become the title sponsor of the championship. The tournament grew each year and was signed to a multi-year deal with several large sponsors and Talen Energy Stadium (Formerly PPL Park) for the tournament to be held in Philadelphia for several more years. The success of the tournament in 2016 showed how popular this collegiate level event had become.\nThe National Collegiate Rugby Organization obtained the rights to the CRC in 2020 and in 2021 and 2022 staged its championship 7s matches at the tournament in New Orleans. In 2023, it moved to the Maryland suburbs of Washington DC.\nUSA Rugby National Championship.\nUSA Rugby announced in September 2011 the creation of a new sevens tournament, the USA Rugby Sevens Collegiate National Championships. The tournament was held annually at the end of the fall season for its first three years and featured 24 teams. Qualification is based on performance at sevens tournaments during the fall, where tournament winners receive automatic bids, with the remaining places in the 24-team field filled by invitation. Some of the more high-profile qualifying tournaments include tournaments based on traditional conference rivalries, such as the Atlantic Coast 7s (composed mostly of ACC schools), the Southeastern 7s (composed mostly of SEC schools) and the Heart of America 7s (composed mostly of Big 12 schools).\nThe inaugural Championship tournament was held December 16–17, 2011 in College Station, Texas, and was contested by 24 teams that qualified based on performance in qualifying tournaments throughout the fall of 2011. The 2011 tournament was won by Life University, defeating Central Washington 22–17 in overtime. Tim Stanfill of Central Washington was the tournament MVP, Derek Patrick of Miami was the tournament's leading try scorer, and Colton Caraiga of Life University was the tournament's leading points scorer. In the first three years, strong teams that won bids have declined to participate.\nConference membership.\nTeam rankings are in parentheses, based on Goff Rugby Report rankings, current as of January 2017.\nDivision I-A.\nThe conference champion is invited to the D1A playoffs along with several at large bids for independents or other highly ranked teams.\nDivision I-AA.\n\"Italics\" indicate second teams of clubs competing in D I-A. These teams are ineligible for Division I-AA playoffs.\nFormer Conferences:\nOrganization and conferences.\nAmerican college rugby is governed by USA Rugby. In the past, college rugby competitions have been governed by local unions.\nThe structure of the college game has evolved significantly in recent years. To increase the marketability of the game, many traditional rivals have been consolidated into conferences resembling major NCAA conferences such as the Pac-12 and Big Ten.\nConferences and conference tournaments.\nBeginning around 2010, college rugby programs began realigning into conference structures that mirror the traditional NCAA conferences used by the member schools' other athletic programs. The first high-profile example was the formation of the Ivy League Rugby Conference in 2010. Following the organization of the Ivy League schools, the members of the Atlantic Coast Conference and the Southeastern Conference followed suit in 2010.\nIvy Rugby Conference.\nThe Ivy Rugby Conference was formed and had its first full season in 2009. The IRC was formed to foster better competition among rugby teams from the Ivy League schools and to raise the quality of play. The IRC has had consistent success in attracting commercial interests. The IRC formed committees to manage the league, independently of the LAUs and TUs. Prior to formation of the IRC, clubs from the eight Ivy League schools had competed in the Ivy Rugby Championship Tournament since 1969.\nSoutheastern Collegiate Rugby Conference.\nIn December 2010, a core group of founding schools formed the Southeastern Collegiate Rugby Conference (SCRC). By April 2010, the SCRC had expanded to 11 schools, comprising the entire membership of the NCAA's Southeastern Conference (SEC) at that time except for Arkansas. Tennessee won the 2010 Southeastern Collegiate Rugby Sevens Championship beating LSU 19–17, and repeated in the 2011 SCRC Olympic Sevens Championship, beating Florida 26–14 in the final. Similar to other conferences, the SCRC has also enjoyed commercial success, announcing in fall 2010 that the SCRC had formed commercial partnership agreements with Adidas and the World Rugby Shop.\nThe Southeastern Collegiate Rugby Conference, formed by the aforementioned 11 SEC schools, was created in late 2010 and began play in the 2011–12 season. Florida won the conference title in the inaugural season, defeating Tennessee in the championship match. Although the SEC has since expanded to 14 schools, the SCRC membership remains at 11.\nPacific Athletic Conference.\nSeveral members of the Pac-12 conference agreed in spring 2012 to form a conference beginning play in the 2012–13 season.\nOther conferences.\nNine D1A rugby programs currently compete in the Big Ten Universities conference, which was founded in 2012. The Red River Conference, which replaced the Allied Rugby Conference in 2014–15, is composed mostly of teams from what had been the Big 12 South from 1996 to 2011. The Southwest Conference (SWC) was created in 2011 with charter members from seven Texas schools. University of Texas was immediately added, and Texas won the conference in the inaugural 2011–12 season.\nOther competitions.\nCollege rugby includes rivalry trophies such as the World Cup between the University of California, Berkeley and the University of British Columbia (Canada), the Wasatch Cup between BYU and Utah, the University Cup between Texas and Texas A&amp;M, the Koranda Cup between Yale and Princeton, and the Common Wealth Shield between Virginia and Virginia Tech.\nThe ACRC Bowl Series championship 15s tournament took place annually for three years from 2014 until 2016. College conference champions and select elite sides participated. The tournament provided an opportunity for teams to play outside of their conferences and was therefore relevant to establishing final fall 15s college rankings.\nDivision II XVs.\nUntil 2021, Division II was solely governed by USA Rugby.\nSmall Colleges.\nSmall College Rugby, formerly known as Division III, is governed by the National Collegiate Rugby Organization, formerly the National Small College Rugby Organization (NSCRO). In 2020, NSCRO re-branded as National Collegiate Rugby. The National Small College Rugby Organization was created to give a competitive outlet to small colleges which would not otherwise have an opportunity to compete on a national stage. Each year, the NSCRO hosts rugby tournaments for Men's and Women's college teams, and during 2006–2011 it also conducted a Division IV Women's college tournament.\nDivision IV.\nThe National Small College Rugby Organization conducted a Women's only Division IV championship from 2006 to 2011.\nInjuries.\nIn the US, college rugby has much higher injury rates than college football. Rugby union has similar injury types to American football but with more common injuries of arms."

The project was initiated on the directives of a former prime minister and responsibility for overseeing the construction was entrusted to Ehsan Mani, the former chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).\nConstruction.\nThe government has started the construction of the stadium and has granted approval to the Capital Development Authority (CDA) to commence the construction process. Various potential locations have been under consideration by the CDA for the establishment of this new stadium, with particular attention given to the scenic and logistical advantages of the foothills of the Margalla Mountains. A definitive choice regarding the stadium's location will be made in due course. The CDA had previously initiated a project for building a stadium in Shakarparian, but it was discontinued due to a decision by the Supreme Court of Pakistan. However, in this new endeavor, the CDA has chosen a parcel of land near Sector D-12 as the location for the stadium's construction. Officials from the CDA have clarified that this area falls within Zone III, and in accordance with the master plan and zoning regulations of 1992, the civic agency is permitted to construct sports and entertainment facilities within this designated zone.\nFacilities.\nThe stadium's design incorporates a high-performance center and is set to serve as the venue for a diverse array of both international and local tournaments and fixtures. Additionally, it will feature a five-star hotel designed to accommodate visiting international teams. This not only enhances their security but also contributes to alleviating traffic congestion throughout the entire city.\nFuture Plans.\nThe Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is targeting the completion of the stadium by 2025, aligning with Pakistan's role as the host for the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy."

        "text": "Larry O'Neal Lawrence (born January 25, 1959) is an American-French former basketball player who spent 18 years playing professionally after a successful collegiate career at Dartmouth College. He was the 1981 Ivy League Player of the Year. Lawrence was born and raised in Macon, Georgia, United States.\nBasketball career.\nCollege.\nAfter graduating from Mount de Sales Academy in Macon, where he was an all-state basketball player, Lawrence received an academic scholarship to play for Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. He graduated high school at age 16 so he sat out his first two years at Dartmouth, eventually joining the varsity squad in his redshirt sophomore season of 1977–78. In his first collegiate season, Lawrence averaged 8.0 points, 4.4 rebounds, and 2.1 assists per game.\nAs a junior in 1978–79, the small forward led Dartmouth in points (16.3) and rebounds (7.5) en route to a spot on the All-Ivy League First Team. The following year, he was named a team captain but he broke his foot, which sidelined him for the entire 1979–80 season.\nDuring Lawrence's final season in 1980–81, he led not only the Big Green in scoring (21.4) but the entire Ivy League as well, while his 8.7 rebounds were also a team-high. Lawrence became the first Dartmouth player in history to win the Ivy League Player of the Year award. He earned a second All-Ivy League First Team selection, and the Associated Press tabbed him as an Honorable Mention All-American. Lawrence finished his career with 1,122 points, good for 10th in school history at the time of his graduation.\nProfessional.\nIn June 1980, after the season ended in which Lawrence sat out due to the broken foot, the NBA's Atlanta Hawks selected him in the 1980 NBA draft in the eight round (175th overall). Lawrence opted to return to school, making him an ineligible draftee.\nFrom 1982 until 2000, Lawrence's professional career saw him play in the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) and various leagues in France. He won two championships overseas, and in 1988–89 he led LNB Pro B in scoring with 32.4 points per game. He acquired French nationality in March 1998.\nLater life.\nAccording to a January 2023 Ivy League profile on him, \"While still in France, Lawrence founded a charity, 'Les Enfants de la Terre' (Children of the Earth), dedicated to helping underprivileged youths in orphanages across France. He continues his charitable work to this day, having served on the Board of Directors of the Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship and currently sitting on the board of the Black Heart Foundation.\"\nUpon returning to the United States, Lawrence pivoted into a successful career in finance. He stayed in that industry in various capacities until September 2023, when he moved into information technology as a Senior Account Manager for Arteria AI. Lawrence and his wife Arlene have a son, Lawrence Jr., and a daughter, Alyssa."

This extends to the franchise teams the two groups own in the basketball league.\nTeams.\nThe SMC and MVP groups owns three franchise teams each in the Philippine Basketball Association.\nResults.\nThis list is only consists of results starting from the 2010–11 season, when the Meralco Bolts joined the league.\nElimination round.\nThe numbers in parenthesis indicate the teams actual ranking in the conference followed by their record.\nIssues.\nIn 2023, Dennis Anthony Uy who owns the Converge FiberXers has attributed the \"duopoly\" or dominance of the two groups to the declining attendance in the PBA. Wilfred Uytengsu of the now-defunct Alaska franchise has long urged for a \"level playing field\" for the PBA's 12 franchise teams. During the Season 48 draft, coach Yeng Guiao of the Rain or Shine Elasto Painters has asked for other teams to strengthen and develop their respective lineups. Guiao also stressed that top picks in the draft may end up in the SMC and MVP teams in future conferences.\nAs of the 2023–24 Commissioner's Cup, only Alaska and Rain or Shine are the teams not affiliated to the SMC or MVP groups to have won a title across the 34 conferences that were held since 2010. Since the 2016 Governors' Cup, those titles were only won by teams from those two groups.\nIn the PBA Board, the SMC and MVP groups have multiple votes in issues. Since 2014, the two groups have three votes each (one for each team). For basketball-related issues, the two groups only have two votes each. The six other independent teams also have their own voting power in the board."

The Golden Griffins represented Canisius College, played their home games at the LECOM Harborcenter and were coached by Trevor Large in his 7th season.\nSeason.\nCanisius entered the year looking for new leaders both on the offensive side of the puck and in goal. Graduate transfer David Fessenden ended up earning the lion's share of the starts for the Griffins but, as the season progressed, freshman Ethan Robertson was given more and more opportunities to get up to speed at the college level. Fessenden and Robertson played about even with one another, however, neither was particularly outstanding. The goaltending tandem saw the team's goals against average increase by more then half a point. The offense quickly found its new leader in Matteo Giampa and the freshmen ended the year leading the team in scoring by a wide margin.\nThe Golden Griffins started out the year with a 4-game losing streak and never seemed to recover completely. The team was able to produce some bright moments during the season, including a win over a ranked RIT squad, but they were never able to put a consistent stretch of good hockey together. Fortunately, the team ended the regular season in eighth place and managed to earn a home site in the opening round of the conference tournament.\nThe team opened their postseason with one of their best games of the year, scoring the first four goals of the match to knock out Mercyhurst with relative ease. The Griffins then built a 2-goal lead in their quarterfinal match with Holy Cross to give them a chance at a deep run. However, after that their goaltending troubles cropped up again and the team surrendered three goals in the second half of the match to lose 3–4. Robertson got the nod for game 2 and he showed out, stopping 40 shots in the game. Unfortunately, the team's offense was stymied by an equally impressive game from the opposing netminder and the match was sent into overtime. Canisius held on until the start of the second extra session when a defensive lapse allowed an unguarded Holy Cross player to score the winning goal.\nDue to a snowstorm, the game against RIT scheduled on January 13 was postponed to a later date.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \nRankings.\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "text": "The 2023–24 Clarkson Golden Knights Men's ice hockey season was the 102nd season of play for the program and 63rd in ECAC Hockey. The Golden Knights represented Clarkson University in the 2023–24 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season, played their home games at Cheel Arena and were coached by Casey Jones in his 13th season.\nSeason.\nClarkson did not begin the year in good standing. After a decent result in the first week, the Golden Knights played inconsistently for the rest of October and ended up with a sub-.500 mark. The goaltending battle for the starting role was largely between two new players, freshman Emmett Croteau and senior Austin Roden. The later had gotten the job out of training camp but a lack of success early in the year gave the rookie a shot in goal. After a loss to Rensselaer to open the conference schedule, Roden was back in goal and he settled into the Knights' crease. Clarkson didn't lose another game the rest of the year and went into the winter break near the top of the ECAC standings.\nWhen the team reconvened after Christmas, the Golden Knights were playing at the inaugural Adirondack Winter Invitational. They split their two games, both against ranked opponents, and finished third in the field. By that time, it was apparent that the team had no real chance of earning an at-large bud to the NCAA tournament as they sat 30th in the PairWise standings. While they still had a few games against ranked clubs left on their slate, the Knights could not afford to lose any of the remaining matches and in all likelihood have to win their tournament to return to the national tournament. Unfortunately, the scoring became inconsistent in January and split every weekend for the entire month. Roden, too, was unable to sustain a suitable level of play and he was spelled by Brady Parker in early 2024. Parker played marginally better at first but in early February, the bottom dropped out. Over a six-game stretch, the Golden Knights lost 5 games while averaging less than 2 goals per game. The bad stretch dropped the team down to .500 and put them in jeopardy of having to start their postseason in the first round.\nOver the final three weeks, Roden turned in several key performances, including a pair of overtime wins against Cornell and Quinnipiac. However, the team still missed out on a bye into the quarterfinal round by 1 point. Clarkson started their playoff run against Rensselaer, the worst team in the standings. Despite being heavily favored in the game, the Knights didn't have energy in the first two periods and found themselves down entering the third. The team picked up the pace in the final 20 minutes but weren't able to get a marker on the board until the final 7 minutes of the match. After pulling Roden early, Mathieu Gosselin scored his team-leading 11th goal of the season and the Knights found themselves down by just 1 with more than two minutes to play. The shots came fast and furious in the final moments but Clarkson was unable to get the tying goal and saw their season end in a rather dismal fashion.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \nRankings.\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "title": "France Rugby League",
        "text": "France Rugby League (in French in the original) was a French rugby league competition which took place in 1995 and 1996, as well as the name of its governing body. The brainchild of former rugby union star Jacques Fouroux, it was an attempt to market the younger code to a casual audience, as a summer tour contested by regional select teams between seasons of France's regular club championship. The first edition received some positive reviews, but the long term viability of its business model remained unclear, and it was quickly eclipsed by the expansion of Rupert Murdoch's Super League to the French market.\nFounding.\nFrance Rugby League was established by Jacques Fouroux, former captain and manager of the French national rugby union team, and former vice-president of the French Rugby (Union) Federation (FFR). According to Fouroux, the league's impetus was a conversation with former South African international Morné du Plessis ahead of the 1995 Rugby Union World Cup. Both expressed the desire for a new, more elitist club competition that would usher rugby into the professional era and pick the interest of the wider public beyond the temporary boost provided by that tournament. However, after prematurely siding with the wrong faction during the FFR's 1991 election campaign, Fouroux had lost much of his political clout within French rugby union, whose establishment remained ostensibly attached to amateurism. He thus decided to switch codes and move to rugby league, where he felt he could find more support for his vision.\nFouroux presented his new venture to the press in a press conference held in Paris on 7 November 1994. Also participating were Maurice Lindsay, CEO of the Rugby Football League and Australia's Ken Arthurson, chairman of the International Rugby League Board. While some chalked Fouroux's sudden conversion from union down to political ambition, his prestige and the sport's yearning for a national footprint easily trumped those concerns within the French rugby league community. Upon his re-election at the head of the French Rugby League Federation (FFRXIII) on 25 February 1995 in Carcassonne, president Jean-Paul Ferré announced the impending creation—then slated for 11 Match 1995—of the new administrative body required by Fouroux's circuit.\nFrance Rugby League's statutes were eventually approved during a federal assembly held on 25 May 1995 in Villeneuve-sur-Lot. The vote was unanimous in favor of its creation. Fouroux was named as FRL's manager. Jacques Larrose, a veteran union executive with Stade Rochelais and former league player with Lavardac, was appointed president. Fouroux also trademarked the title \"Rugby League Magazine\" for a potential print publication, and even registered the brand \"Rugby League Café\" for a potential chain of sports bars. Trademarks for these and for the some ancillary rights to the France Rugby League property were owned by Fauroux' company, Auch-based JFX Événements.\nRugby union reaction.\nDue to FRL's lofty ambitions, there was some speculation as to whether some of the country's amateur rugby union stars would cross the line to play in it. In the run-up to its official announcement, Fouroux hinted that veterans Franck Mesnel and Laurent Rodriguez, both close friends of his, were interested parties. On 3 May 1995, the tour announced its first marquee hire, as France rugby union international (FC Grenoble) signed for the team then identified as Lyon–Villeurbanne. FRL's proclamation of statutes was attended by several union names, including the aforementioned Rodriguez, Bernard Laporte and Bernard Lacombe (who would switch to league full time for several seasons).\nThe FFR (rugby union) was critical of the project, with its president Bernard Lapasset saying: \"I want to be the president of a federation that caters to responsible men, who we prepare for and launch into professional life. Producing rugbymen who will be motivated by the commercial contracts they get from their club or federation, I don't think that is very healthy.\" RC Nîmes president Louis Gagnières reiterated that \"there is only one rugby\" and added: \"Guys are attached to their club. They may go and make a few coins in league, of which they'll have to pay a lot in taxes, but I'm not sure they would be making the right choice.\" Ultimately, the number of union defectors remained modest.\nAccording to contemporary press reports, some rugby union strongholds were pressured by the FFR into refusing to host FRL games. In particular, Béziers mayor Pierre Couderc denounced an agreement between his deputy mayor for sports and FRL to host the 1995 final at Stade de la Méditerranée, banning the tour from the venue. The game was moved to Carcassonne, already a tried-and-true league town.\nFormat.\nSchedule.\nFouroux' motto for his new league was \"understandable by all, and spectacular all the time\". Fouroux quickly decided on a tour operating in the summer, with teams mostly playing on neutral ground, which would allow to introduce the game to as many new markets as possible. Another bold move was to make admission free in an effort to reach broader demographics, which drew raised eyebrows from the press. Tickets were sold to public and private corporate partners, who would then distribute them to their own patrons.\nThe preliminary plan presented in November 1994 called for sixteen teams, each representing a region and bearing the name of a corporate sponsor in lieu of a nickname. However, prior to Rupert Murdoch's commitment, Fouroux remained FRL's only significant financier. He also expressed interest in a number of large or non-traditional rugby markets, which expanded up to northern cities like Strasbourg and Reims, due to the latter having recently lost its professional soccer team. By the time FRL was approved by the French federation in May 1995, the number of teams had been reduced to eight.\nGame presentation.\nFRL's presentation was largely inspired by the Australian Rugby League, as evidenced by its jersey designs, which were patterned after those worn by ARL clubs. It aimed to sell the rugby action as part of a broader entertainment package, which included musical performances by artists well known to the general French public at the time, such as Rozlyne Clarke and Zouk Machine.\nRules.\nFouroux also felt that the sport of rugby union itself was in need of a retooling, saying: \"[In rugby union] we are dinosaurs. [...] A scrum moves an inch, and we find extraordinary, geedy pleasure in it. But who likes it, aside from us, coaches and players?\" Although Fouroux always intended to place more emphasis on the running game, he originally envisioned a hybrid sport, which he called it \"not quite rugby league\". However, after being invited by FFRXIII president Jean-Pierre Ferré to attend a 13-man game at Wembley Stadium, he was so impressed with the game's speed that he opted to play rugby league outright, with only minor tweaks to that code's established ruleset.\nTweaks were chiefly made with the aim of making the sport television friendly. Some innovations were drawn from North American sports. Each team carried four alternate players, who could get in whenever they wanted in an effort to keep the action more intense, which was compared to ice hockey. Playing time was also divided in four quarters like in american football, which was acknowledged as a way to squeeze in more commercial time.\nGame staff was also beefed up to increase the pace of play. In addition to the standard three officials, one was added behind each goal line to expedite the decision process and cut down on disputes with players. The number of ball boys positioned around the field was brought up to ten, in order to immediately provide players with a new ball after one went out of bounds.\nMedia.\nYouth-oriented national radio network Fun Radio signed on as the tour's media partner. Upstart over-the-air channel M6 was rumored to be in talks for the television rights at an early stage. Ultimately, the first edition's final was shown on premium channel Canal+, the broadcaster of Fouroux's exhibition rugby union team, the French Barbarians, and the parent company of Paris Saint-Germain FC.\nSeasons.\n1995.\nThe eight inaugural teams, split across two pools, were: Avignon–Provence, Bordeaux–Aquitaine, Carcassonne–Aude–Languedoc, Lyon–Rhône-Alpes, Marseille–Méditerranée, Paris–Île-de-France, Perpignan–Roussillon–Catalogne and Toulouse–Midi-Pyrénées. While several teams carried the names of large cities Fouroux was interested in, most games were played in smaller towns, often rugby league strongholds. Only Villeurbanne near Lyon, which hosted half of the semifinal series, qualified as a bonafide major market. The first season, initially tabbed for July 1995, kicked off on 10 August 1995 in Perpignan and lasted seven weeks. The budget was capped at 300,000 francs per team for this trial run, with hopes of rising it to 1,000,000 francs if revenue projections aligned. The players were accepting of the strict cap as they were eager to help the tour reach a new audience.\nArrival of the Super League.\nAround 1994, Australian-American media mogul Rupert Murdoch became the principal backer of a projected Australasian rugby league circuit, the Super League, which aimed to supplant the longstanding Australian Rugby League (the two would ultimately merge as the National Rugby League). Additionally, Murdoch desired to have an equivalent competition in Europe, so that the top teams of both hemispheres could be matched in a world final. Thus a sister organization, Super League (Europe), was pitched to the game's European brass and quickly gained the support of England's Rugby Football League. As Fouroux's own loop was modeled after the Australasian club circuit, he was another logical partner for Murdoch's new European operation.\nBefore France Rugby League had even played its first game, it was already in negotiations with Murdoch and Paris Saint-Germain FC for the creation of a France-based Super League team. As FRL's frontman, Fouroux received the presidency of the new PSG Rugby League, and the organization appointed Michel Mazaré as the team's manager on 16 December 1995 during a federal assembly in Albi. In effect, the team would act as a nationwide select team, with France Rugby League's regional teams as a transitional step between it and the grassroot clubs. PSG RL was actually projected to become a touring team representing the whole of France in year two.\n1996.\nThe second season saw two of FRL's 1995 teams, Avignon–Provence and Lyon–Rhône-Alpes, omitted from the line-up. Early schedules listed a pair of new teams billed from Casablanca, Morocco and Barcelona, Spain, as part of the league, but there is no indication that they actually played. Paris was also slated to make its debut as a host location.\nAs both were summer leagues, the second season of France Rugby League coincided with the Super League's inaugural campaign, with Paris Saint-Germain's Super League squad taking precedence over selections for France Rugby League's regional teams. Meanwhile, the Paris–Île-de-France team playing in France Rugby League was renamed as PSG Espoirs Île-de-France ('PSG Île-de-France Prospects').\nUltimately, FRL's expected growth did not materialize in year two and the addition of the Superleague team did not nothing to help its profile. With his financial model under scrutiny, Fouroux resigned from his duties with both PSG and FRL on 1 September 1996, returning to rugby union soon after. FRL did not play another season, and its president Jacques Larrose succeeded Fouroux at the helm of PSG RL.\nRevival attempts.\nThe concept of a summer league made up of regional teams and geared towards the general public was considered for a reboot on two occasions. In 2012, veteran sports executive , who had worked with PSG during its rugby league experiment and kept an affinity for the game, was commissioned by then FFRXIII president Nicolas Larrat to revive it. However, a regime change at the federation saw his successor Carlos Zalduendo prioritize a return of his club Toulouse Olympique to the RFL system, and the project was put on hold.\nIn 2017, new federation president Marc Palanques brought Dayan back to produce an updated version of the project. Now tentatively named \"Super XIII\", it called for thirteen teams representing France's twelve mainland regions plus Corsica. The following monikers were proposed: Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes Montagnards ('Mountaineers'), Bourgogne-Franche-Comté Guerriers ('Warriors'), Brittany Menhirs, Centre-Val de Loire Ogres, Corsica Pirates, Grand-Est Sangliers ('Wildhogs'), Hauts-de-France Tisonniers ('Fire Irons'), Île-de-France Parigots (slang for 'Parisians'), Normandy Cavaliers, Nouvelle-Aquitaine Vignerons ('Winemakers'), Occitania Ours ('Bears'), Pays de la Loire Sentinelles ('Sentinels') and Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur Aigles ('Eagles').\nThe necessary budget to get the league going was estimated to €15 million. The FFRXIII entered talks with Provale, the French professional rugby union players' association, offering its less experienced membership to join the competition on a developmental basis during the union off-season, thus adding depth to its talent pool at a moderate cost. However, according to Luc Dayan, Ligue Nationale de Rugby president Paul Goze immediately vetoed the idea when approached, telling him: \"Don't even try convincing me. As long as I live, this won't happen.\" The project has since gone under the radar again, although whether this was the primary reason for its failure is unclear."

Canada won the bronze medal by defeating the United States 3–2. As winners Argentina qualified directly for the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, France.\nQualification.\nA total of eight teams qualified to compete at the games. As host nation, Chile were given automatic qualification. The top two teams at both the 2022 South American Games and 2023 Central American and Caribbean Games also qualified. The remaining qualification quotas came from the 2022 Pan American Cup. As Chile finished in the top two at the 2022 South American Games, their qualification quota was added to the 2022 Pan American Cup, meaning four teams qualified from the tournament. If Canada and/or the United States had still not qualified, a play-off between the nations and the third ranked at the Pan American Cups would have taken place. As both nations qualified, the play-off was not necessary and the next best placed team at each Pan American Cup (that has not already qualified) qualified.

The team was coached by Leroy Clark in his 5th season.\nSeason.\nRensselaer began its season with a road game at Williams. While both teams had to contend with rough ice, the Ephs played as a team while the Engineers acted as if they were by themselves. The contrast in styles led to an easy win for the home team as RPI was unable to handle the attack from the Purple squad. Captain Tierney was the only one to score the Rensselaer in the otherwise terrible game.\nThe second match a few weeks later provided RPI with its best opportunity for a win. Unfortunately, a total lack of offense prevented the Engineers from earning a win. In their only home game of the year, Rensselaer played a fast game against YMCA College. The team's minimal attack was stopped by a sturdy defensive effort from the Maroons and the single goal from the visitors was all they needed. RPI had an extended break until their next game due to the exam break but the team didn't appear any better when they met YMCA for a rematch. The offense remained silent in the match and, though the still only allowed one goal, the Engineers lost once more.\nAfterwards, the team headed south to play Columbia. While the Lions had the advantage of experience with avoiding the pillars that were set into the surface of their home rink, the disparity in play was even more stark as Columbia easily won the game. Tierney was again the only player on the scoresheet for Rensselaer. The team played its final game of the year the following week and they were completely outclassed by Hamilton. Playing at the brand new Russell Sage Rink, Hamilton lit the lamp 12 times while Rensselaer was unable to get any offense going. The loss finished off possibly the worst season in program history.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "title": "Japan–South Korea baseball rivalry",
        "text": "The Japan–South Korea baseball rivalry is a sports rivalry contested between the national baseball teams of Japan and South Korea. One of many rivalries between the two East Asian countries, the two teams met officially at the 1954 Asian Baseball Championship and have contested several high-profile games since, including several Summer Olympics and the final of the 2009 World Baseball Classic. The two teams are considered \"arch-rivals\", and the competition is one of the fiercest in international baseball.\nBackground.\nThe baseball rivalry between Japan and South Korea is rooted in the historically contentious relationship between the two countries; Japan invaded the Korean peninsula in the early 20th century, and occupied it until being expelled after World War II. The Republic of Korea gained its independence shortly thereafter. However, diplomatic relations between the two countries would not be normalized until 1965, and even this was only accomplished after the suppression of public opposition in South Korea.\nEven though baseball originated in both countries independently from each other, the sport's evolution in each country was affected by the other. For much of the 20th century, Korean players were prominent in Japan's professional leagues (including Isao Harimoto, a Zainichi Korean inducted into the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame). However, during the Japanese occupation, baseball was restricted on the Korean peninsula, and Korean players were only allowed to play in tournaments sponsored by Japanese companies. In this way, baseball also became a means of promoting Korean nationalism.\nSouth Korea and Japan were two of the four founding members of the Baseball Federation of Asia in 1954. The two countries met for the first time later that year, when the Asian Baseball Championship was inaugurated in Manila. In the first game of the inaugural Asian baseball tournament, Korea suffered a 0–6 shutout to Samurai Japan. Korea won its first victory in the rivalry nine years later, defeating Japan 5–2 at the 1963 Asian Baseball Championship in Seoul.\nHistory.\nOne of South Korea's most dramatic victories over its neighbor took place at the 1982 Baseball World Cup, held at Jamsil Baseball Stadium in Seoul. Trailing 0–2 in the bottom of the eighth, Kim Jae-bak hit a three-run homer off the foul pole, making South Korea the first Asian country to win the amateur baseball competition.\nIn the early 2000s, South Korea was considered by some to be a \"rising power\" in baseball, especially compared to more established baseball powerhouses like Japan. Some have pointed to the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney as the modern emergence of the rivalry, as South Korea beat Japan to win the bronze medal.\nBefore the inaugural 2006 World Baseball Classic, Japan's Ichiro Suzuki made several controversial comments about South Korea, claiming that the country \"smells like garlic.\" He added that he wanted to beat South Korea bad enough to \"make them see that they won't beat Japan for the next 30 years.\" South Korea responded by twice beating Japan, and Korean pitcher Jae Weong Seo planted two Korean flags on the mound while a visibly-angry Ichiro looked on. An editorial in the JoonAng Daily described Korea's run against Japan as \"the most triumphant event in the 101 years of Korean baseball history.\" Despite Korea's perfect 3–0 in pool play, they were ultimately defeated by Japan 6–0 in a third, semifinal matchup; Japan moved on to take the championship game over Cuba.\nAt the 2006 Asian Games in Doha, South Korea suffered bitter defeats in three major professional sports: association football, basketball, and baseball. The Korean baseball team, with expectations of a third consecutive gold medal, lost to a Japanese team composed mainly of amateur players. The Korean press labelled the incident \"\". Nevertheless, South Korea cemented their position with a gold medal finish at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, while Japan finished a disappointing fourth despite sending many top players from NPB.\nGoing into the 2009 World Baseball Classic, both Japan and South Korea were considered among the tournament favorites. Ichiro again courted controversy in the build-up to the 2009 tournament, making comments suggesting that the Koreans, with their \"big bodies\", played \"American-style baseball\" rather than \"Japanese baseball\", which some regarded as racially-charged. South Korea's Jung Bong pushed back on these comments, arguing that the Korean team was \"not even all that big physically,\" but that its \"level of focus and team unity is definitely better than Japan's.\" South Korea and Japan met in the final game of the tournament at Dodger Stadium. The Korean team managed a late-innings rally to tie the game with Samurai Japan, but Ichiro lined a two-out, two-strike single off of Korea's Chang-yong Lim — who had been directed not to pitch to Ichiro — in the 10th inning to drive in the winning runs.\nJapan and Korea did not meet in the 2013 World Baseball Classic, as they were assigned to different pools; South Korea was eliminated in the first round, while Japan lost to Puerto Rico in the championship round. Instead, their next high-profile meeting was in the semifinals of the inaugural WBSC Premier12 tournament in 2015. Before a sold-out crowd at the Tokyo Dome, Samurai Japan starter Shohei Ohtani took a no-hitter into the seventh inning, but Korea scored four runs in the ninth to rally past top-ranked Japan with a final score of 4–3.\nJapan hosted the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, adding baseball to the games for the first time since 2008. The tournament, delayed to 2021 and played behind closed doors due to the COVID-19 pandemic, saw South Korea and Japan meet in the semifinal round. Japan bested South Korea 5–2, though the game was marred by a controversial safe call on Kensuke Kondoh, who South Korea argued missed touching first base. The safe call, confirmed by replay review, allowed a rally that ended in a Tetsuto Yamada bases-clearing double, sending Japan to the gold medal game (which they eventually won over Team USA).\nSouth Korea and Japan met again in the pool stage of the 2023 World Baseball Classic, hosted at the Tokyo Dome. In an interview, Korean pitcher Go Woo-suk suggested that he would be willing to intentionally hit Japan's Shohei Ohtani. The comments sparked backlash in Japan; Tokyo Sports went as far as suggesting that Go sought revenge on Japan after his poor performance at the 2020 Olympics. Go later apologized for his comments and said he had been joking. When the two teams met, Japan trounced South Korea by a score of 13–4, as Korea's bullpen fell apart in the middle innings and the team just barely avoided a mercy rule end to the game. The loss to Japan, along with an upset opening day loss to Australia, contributed to Korea's early exit from the tournament. Japan, meanwhile, managed to go on to the final, where they defeated the U.S. for their third WBC title."

The Big Green represented Dartmouth College, played their home games at the Thompson Arena and were coached by Reid Cashman in his 3rd season.\nSeason.\nDartmouth started the year in a rather peculiar position. Though a relatively low-scoring team, the Big Green saw a vast improvement by their defense and, perhaps more importantly, their starting goaltender Cooper Black. Inasmuch, the team found it difficult to win games but they refused to surrender to their opponents. In the first 11 games of the year, Dartmouth tied more than half and went into the winter break as a relative unknown.\nThe team returned with the annual Ledyard Bank Classic but the time off appeared to have softened the defense. Dartmouth went 2–4 coming out of the break and appeared to be heading towards another losing season. In late January, however, things began to change. Sophomore Luke Haymes, who had been one of the better forwards already, caught fire. Beginning with the match against Rensselaer on January 20, he ran roughshod over ECAC defenses and scored 24 points (14 goals 10 assists) in the final 12 games of the regular season. His offensive explosion helped turn Dartmouth's season around and allowed the Big Green to go 7–2–3 down the stretch. Dartmouth climbed their way up the conference standings and finished 1 point ahead of Clarkson for 4th place.\nThe streak not only gave the team home ice but provided the Greens with a bye into the quarterfinal round. The week off appeared to end Haymes' hot streak but the rest of the team picked up the pace and ensured that Dartmouth had enough scoring to dispatch Union in straight sets. In the semifinals, Dartmouth met Cornell and looked to have the measure of the Big Red for the first two periods. The Big Green had a 3–1 lead with 20 minutes to play but had to kill off a penalty at the start of the period. Unfortunately, Cornell was able to convert on their only man-advantage of the match and that goal seemed to spark the Reds. Cornell scored two more goals in the middle of the period to take the lead and then held off Dartmouth with their stingy defense. In desperation, Cooper Black was pulled for an extra attacker but that only allowed Cornell to score twice into an empty net to turn the match into a rout.\nDespite the collapse at the end, Dartmouth had finished the year with a winning record for the first time in eight years and posted a dramatic turnaround going from 12th to 4th in the conference standings.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \nRankings.\n&lt;br&gt;"

Unfortunately, because the team was unable to come to an arrangement with the operators of the new Arena, they were forced to find other venues. The first game for the team was arranged on the fly as Massachusetts Agricultural was originally slated to play MIT. Though BU stepped in, the team had only been on the ice for one practice and were outclassed to such a great degree that the reporters didn't bother giving an account of the game. A few weeks later the team met Boston College and, once more, were completely out of their depth. By the end of the first half, BC was ahead by 7 goals. The Eagles essentially took the second half off but still added to their total.\nAfter the two embarrassing losses, the team was again mothballed until the school could find a home for the program.\nNote: Boston University's athletic programs weren't known as the 'Terriers' until 1922.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The 2023–24 St. Lawrence Saints Men's ice hockey season was the 84th season of play for the program and the 63rd in ECAC Hockey. The Saints represented St. Lawrence University, played their home games at the Appleton Arena and were coached by Brent Brekke in his 5th season.\nSeason.\nSt. Lawrence was well-positioned entering the 2023-24 season, as almost the entire team returned from the previous year. The only real question was in goal, where grad transfer Ben Kraws was expected to take over the starting role. However, once the season started, it became apparent that the Larries had lost something; the defense was unable to shield their goaltender. Kraws played credibly in goal but he came under siege from a barrage of opposing chances. The Saints were allowing an average of more than 32 shots against per game, more than 5 over what they had the year before and one of the worst marks in the nation. Kraws played about as well as could be expected but, with the offense not providing much support the Larries won just three times in their first fourteen games.\nAfter a poor showing in the first two months, St. Lawrence began to turn things around in December. Several good defensive performances in December and January allowed the Saints to win some of their conference games and climb into the middle of the standings. The Larries had an outside chance at earning a bye into the conference quarterfinals but a minor slump from the back end caused that opportunity to slip by the wayside. St. Lawrence stumbled to the finish, winning only two of their final ten games.\nEven with the slide down the home stretch, the Larries were able to earn a home stand for the opening round of the postseason and opened against Yale. The defense did Kraws no favors, allowing 39 shots in the game, but stopped enough to allow the offense to carry the day in the final home game of the season. The next week sent the Larries to meet Colgate and, at times, the team looked completely outclassed. The Raiders ran over the Saints in the first period, outshooting St. Lawrence 17–3 but Kraws stood his ground. A strong second period gave the team a 2-goal lead but a regressing in the third saw Colgate tie the game and force overtime. Kraws was absolutely key in extra time, stopping 16 shots in over 27 minutes of play. His stellar goaltending allowed Luc Salem to fire a bouncing puck from the blueline through a maze of bodies for the winning goal. The rematch saw Colgate come storming out of the gate and completely dominate the first period once more. This time, the Larries fell down by a goal but, once more, a solid middle period saw St. Lawrence take a lead into the third. A power play goal by the Raiders tied the score but, just a few minutes afterwards, a goal from Jan Olenginski on a breakaway restored the lead for the Larries and they rode Kraws the rest of the way to victory.\nIn the semifinals, St. Lawrence faced Quinnipiac, the defending NCAA national champions. The Larries' defense limited the Bobcats to just 22 shots, which were all stopped by Ben Kraws. For the third consecutive game, St. Lawrence scored two in the second and that was more than enough to carry them to victory. With the Saints now just one win from the NCAA tournament, St. Lawrence entered the game with Cornell looking for a major upset. However, with the Big Red also fighting for their season, the Larries knew they would not have an easy challenge. The Saints played well but they were stymied by one of the best defensive teams in the nation. While Cornell was able to score in each period, St. Lawrence could only get a single marker in the third and saw their miracle run end just shy of a league championship and their first NCAA appearance since 2007.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \nRankings.\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "text": "The 2023–24 Sacred Heart Pioneers men's ice hockey season was the 31st season of play for the program, the 26th at the Division I level and the 21st in Atlantic Hockey. The Pioneers represented Sacred Heart University, played their home games at the Martire Family Arena and were coached by C. J. Marottolo in his 15th season.\nSeason.\nWith a sizable amount of roster turnover, including three of its top four goal-scorers, Sacred Heart had many unanswered questions entering the season. The team was expecting to use Chase Clark as its starting goaltender, but the Quinnipiac transfer had a tough time getting to his game. The Pioneers began poorly, losing four of their first five matches but the team appeared to have sorted itself out by the end of October. Over several weeks, the team went 6–1, not allowing more than 2 goals in any of its games. The offense, too, got off to a slow start but then picked up the pace in the second month of the season. The line of Walsh-Joughin-Lombardi proved to be the most successful with those three finishing in the top four for team scoring.\nIn spite of their winning record, Sacred Heart was unable to fins any success in their non-conference schedule. Though they had a fairly weak slate of opponents, the Pioneers couldn't get a single win in eight games, only managing one tie to Princeton. That terrible mark made it impossible for SHU to make the NCAA tournament without a conference title. Fortunately, however, the team was still able to perform well in Atlantic Hockey. Though they had a rather poor second half, winning just 5 of 17 games after January 1, Sacred Heart managed to finish 3rd in the conference. The struggles began with shaky play from Clark, who was replaced as the starter by Justin Robbins. While Robbins' numbers were only marginally better than Clark's the graduate netminder played more consistently in the latter half of the year. Unfortunately, the offense slowed down as the season went on and the Pioneers could only manage 3 goals in three of the final thirteen game to end the regular season.\nThough they had backed into a quarterfinal bye, Sacred Heart was hoping to use home ice to their advantage and make a run in the conference tournament. However, despite getting a week-long break to resolve their troubles, SHU saw both of its main problems recur against Niagara. The team got a 2-goal lead in the opening match but could only watch as the Purple Eagles swiftly erased the advantage. Niagara scored four goals in under 9 minutes of game time, including 3 in a 43-second span, to take hold of the match. SHU opened the scoring in the second game as well but wasn't able to get a second marker in the final 59 minutes despite outshooting NU nearly two to one. Robbins was in net for both games and allowed 9 goals on 53 shots (both matches had empty-net goals), ending the Pioneers' season on a low note.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 ! style=\"\"; | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \nRankings.\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball career double plays as a right fielder leaders",
        "text": "In baseball statistics, a double play (denoted as DP) is the act of making two outs during the same continuous play. One double play is recorded for every defensive player who participates in the play, regardless of how many of the outs in which they were directly involved, and is counted in addition to whatever putouts and assists might also apply. Double plays can occur any time there is at least one baserunner and fewer than two outs. The center fielder (CF) is one of the three outfielders, the defensive positions in baseball farthest from the batter. Center field is the area of the outfield directly in front of a person standing at home plate and facing beyond the pitcher's mound. The outfielders' duty is to try to catch long fly balls before they hit the ground or to quickly catch or retrieve and return to the infield any other balls entering the outfield. Generally having the most territory to cover, the center fielder is usually the fastest of the three outfielders, although this can also depend on the relative strength of their throwing arms and the configuration of their home field, due to the deepest part of center field being the farthest point from the infield and home plate. The center fielder normally plays behind the shortstop and second baseman, who play in or near the infield; unlike catchers and most infielders (excepting first basemen), who are virtually exclusively right-handed, center fielders can be either right- or left-handed. In the scoring system used to record defensive plays, the center fielder is assigned the number 8.\nRight fielders are most commonly credited with a double play when they throw the ball to an infielder who tags a runner attempting to advance on the basepaths, even on a caught fly ball that results in an out (see tag up); of special importance are throws to the catcher if the runner is trying to reach home plate to score a run, perhaps on a sacrifice fly. Left fielders will often record assists by throwing out runners who try to advance farther than the batter, such as going from first to third base on a single, or batter/runners who try to stretch a hit into a longer one. Outfielders also earn double plays on relay throws to infielders after particularly deep fly balls, by throwing to a base to record an out on an appeal play, or in situations where they might deflect a fly ball before another defensive player makes the catch; in extraordinary instances, right fielders have occasionally recorded double plays by throwing out batters at first base after fielding uncaught line drives that reached them quickly. Outfielders record far fewer double plays than other players due to the difficulty of making an accurate throw in time to retire a runner from a great distance; middle infielders routinely record more double plays in a single season than outfielders do in their entire careers. Double plays are an important statistic for outfielders, giving a greater indication of a left fielder's throwing arm than double plays by infielders do. In recent years, some sabermetricians have begun referring to assists by outfielders as baserunner kills.\nHarry Hooper is the all-time leader in career double plays as a right fielder with 86; he is the only right fielder with more than 80 career double plays. Jason Heyward, who had 20 double plays through the 2023 season to place him tied for 82nd all-time, is the leader among active players."

The Wolfpack were led by eleventh-year head coach Wes Moore and played their home games at Reynolds Coliseum as members of the Atlantic Coast Conference.\nThe Wolfpack got off to a hot start to the season when they upset second ranked Connecticut in the second game of the season. The Wolfpack were unranked at the time and valuted to fourteenth in the nation with the win. They carried their momentum through the Paradise Jam, defeating number 3 Colorado to win the championship. After the tournament win, the team was ranked fifth. Following and ACC–SEC Challenge win over Vanderbilt and a win over Illinois State, the Wolfpack reached their season highest ranking of third. The Wolfpack finished off the non-conference season with three more wins, and finished that portion of the season undefeated. The Wolfpack started the ACC season with wins over Virginia and an overtime victory over number 22 Florida State. Their first loss of the season didn't come until January 7, 2024, when they lost away to number 13 Virginia Tech. THey were upset just two games later against Miami (FL), but then won five straight games, including a rivalry game aginst number 24 North Carolina and over number 15 Louisville. The Wolfpack were again ranked third before losing again to Virginia Tech, this time when the Hokies were ranked number 16. They defeated number 16 Notre Dame and survived an upset scare in overtime against Georgia Tech before losing their rivalry rematch with North Carolina and losing at Duke. They finished the season with an overtime win over number 19 Syracuse and a final game victory over Wake Forest.\nThe Wolfpack finished the season 31–7 overall and 13–5 in ACC play to finish in a three-way tie for second place. As the second seed in the ACC tournament, they earned a bye into the Quarterfinals where they defeated seventh seed Duke. They defeated sixth seed Florida State to reach the Finals. They could not prevail in a low-scoring game, and lost 51–55. They received an at-large invitation to the NCAA Tournament, marking the sixth straight time the Wolfpack qualified for the tournament.

        "title": "Ice hockey in Georgia",
        "text": "Georgia has a very mixed history with ice hockey. The state has seen many expansion teams at multiple levels but few have been able to establish a foothold in the public consciousness.\nHistory.\nOne of the most southern states in the US, Georgia was largely passed over by ice hockey circles for most of the 20th century, as was most of the Deep South. It wasn't until the NHL began expanding in the late 1960s that Georgie received any attention. While the NHL had initially planned to slow down its expansion after 1970, the founding of the WHA caused the league to expedite the process. Tom Cousins, the owner of the Atlanta Hawks, purchased the rights for an expansion franchise for $6 million with the team set to begin play in 1972 at the newly built Omni Coliseum. Initially, the team was a success, making the postseason in just their second year while drawing an average of about 14,000 per game. While the Flames missed the postseason in year three, they returned for each of the next five years. During that time, Atlanta never had a losing record despite playing in what was probably the best division in the league. Unfortunately, the Flames were not able to generate any postseason success in that time. Atlanta won just 2 playoff games in 6 appearances and their lack of success caused a drag on their ticket sales. By 1978, the team was averaging less than 11,000 per game and rumors of the team's potential relocation had begun as early as 1976. A last gasp at boosting interest in the club came when then team signed Jim Craig in 1980 but attendance continued to decline. After the team's playoff exit, Cousins announced that he was selling the team after an estimated loss of $12 million over the previous 8 years. A consortium agreed to purchase the franchise for $16 million and the Flames were moved to Calgary.\nDuring the Flames' initial success, a minor league team was founded in Macon but the Macon Whoopees were a disaster from the start. While playing in the 9,000-seat Macon Coliseum, the Whoopees played on Wednesday and Sunday nights, which were church nights in the state. The team was only able to attract 1,100 spectators for their games and by November the team wasn't able to make payroll. The team limped onward but, after forfeiting a game in January when the players refused to play without getting paid, the club was shut down for good in February when the IRS intervened.\nThe state was left without any established team for over a decade but ice hockey did eventually return to the Omni. In 1992, the Atlanta Knights were founded as the minor league affiliate for the newly formed Tampa Bay Lightning. In its first season, Atlanta captured an IHL division title and also showcased Manon Rhéaume in two games, making her the first woman to play in a professional hockey game. Atlanta won the league championship the next season and the sudden popularity of the game in its second stint convinced the NHL to make another attempt at one of the largest media markets in the country. The Knights played two more seasons before being forced to relocate when the Omni was demolished in 1996.\nOver the next three years, the Philips Arena was built as a home for the Hawks and the new expansion team, the Atlanta Thrashers. The Thrashers were owned by Ted Turner, who had become the owner of the Hawks in the meantime, and stocked its team with promising young talent. The thrashers had poor results in their first few seasons but that allowed the team to draft highly regarded prospects Dany Heatley, Ilya Kovalchuk, and Kari Lehtonen. Unfortunately, the team was struck by tragedy when Heatley crashed his Ferrari 360 just before the start of the 2003–04 season. While Heatly would miss more than half of the year recovering from the injuries, the crash killed his teammate, Dan Snyder. The situation left a pall over the club for the entire year that was compounded by the lockout that cancelled all of the following season. The timing couldn't have been worse for the Thrashers as the team had yet to find any on-ice success and the contingent that had bought the team from Turner in 2003 was already beginning to fray.\nWhile the Thrashers soldiered on, several attempts at establishing minor league teams were made. Macon had received a second team in 1996, also called the Whoopee but it had gone bankrupt after five years. In their immediate wake, the ECHL relocated a team from Tallahassee but the third Whoopee franchise lasted just one year before heading out of state. One final attempt at putting a team in Macon was made when the Atlantic Coast Hockey League was formed in 2002. The Macon Trax moved into the Coliseum and managed to survive for three years despite playing in three different leagues. However, by 2005 the team could no longer sustain itself and the Trax folded.\nWhile Macon had its difficulties, another Georgia city was the target of minor league expansion. The Columbus Cottonmouths first appeared in 1996 The team saw a great deal of success in a short period of time, winning the league championship in its second season while finishing as runners-up in both 2000 and 2001. After the CHL merged with the WPHL in 2001, Columbus lost its two closest rivals (Macon and Huntsville) This led the team to apply for admission in the ECHL and, after purchasing the defunct Hampton Roads Admirals franchise, the Cottonmouths were able to continue in their new league. Unfortunately, the cost of playing in the ECHL outpaced the Cottonmouths' finances and the team was forced to relocate in 2004. That summer, the new SPHL announced that one of their inaugural teams would be the Columbus Cottonmouths, keeping an ice hockey team in the city. This Cottonmouths team responded by winning the inaugural league championship and then capturing a second 7 years later. However, by 2017, mounting losses by the team forced owners Wanda and Shelby Amos to search for a buyer. when none were forthcoming, the team suspended operations after the season.\nAugusta too had its own minor league team in the Augusta Lynx after the Raleigh IceCaps relocated in 1998. Augusta saw very little success, missing the postseason nearly as often as they made it. By 2009, the team's financial situation was so poor that they were forced to suspend operations just 18 games into the season.\nWhile Georgia was able to see some success with its minor league teams, the Thrashers were never able to get on track. After the lockout ended, Atlanta made just one playoff appearance (2007) and did't win a single postseason game. The following years proved to be disastrous for the team as not only were the owners locked into a legal battle over who owned the team but the team's best player, Kovalchuk, had turned down an $101 million contract offer and was eventually traded to New Jersey. In January 2011, reports came out that the team had lost approximately $130 million since the lockout and would need new investors. While some local groups showed interest in purchasing the team and keeping it in Atlanta, ultimately the Thrashers were sold to True North Sports &amp; Entertainment and moved to Winnipeg.\nIn the wake of the Thrashers' departure, Atlanta was not bereft of professional ice hockey as the Gwinnett Gladiators had been playing in the region since 2003. The survival of the Gladiators, since rebranded 'Atlanta' has helped to spur on a second wave of minor league hockey in the state as each of the previous outposts saw further attempts at establishing a franchise. While the Augusta RiverHawks only lasted three seasons, their relocation met with more success and the Macon Mayhem were able to win the SPHL championship in 2017. The Columbus River Dragons were founded in 2019 and managed to navigate their way through the choppy waters of the COVID-19 pandemic to win a league championship in 2021. With the second wave of minor league teams appearing to be more successful, Savannah became the newest hockey city in the state when the Savannah Ghost Pirates were founded in 2022.\nTeams.\nTimeline.\n \nPlayers.\nGeorgia, despite being the 8th most populous state in the nation, has as many players registered with USA Hockey as Nebraska in 2023. The lack of engagement with ice hockey, while endemic to the southern states, has left Georgia behind in its development of native players. Thus far, only a handful of Georgians have achieved any notability in terms of the sport but none were raised in the Peach state."

He was drafted in the second round, 46th overall, by the New Jersey Devils in the 2022 NHL Entry Draft.\nEarly life.\nCasey was born in Miami, Florida on January 8, 2004, to Steve and Karen Casey. When he was around the age of five the family moved to Fort Myers, Florida, where he met now-Columbus Blue Jackets prospect Gavin Brindley, who became a close friend and with whom he would play youth, junior, and collegiate hockey.\nAt twelve, Casey moved to Detroit, Michigan to play for the Compuware Youth Hockey AAA program.\nPlaying career.\nCasey was scouted by the University of Michigan while playing for Compuware, at a game in which he was moved to forward due to injuries. He committed to Michigan in October 2018.\nCasey was drafted by the Sarnia Sting of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL), but elected instead to play for the USA Hockey National Team Development Program (NTDP). Had he chose to enter the OHL, he would have voided his NCAA eligibility.\nIn the 2020–21 season with the NTDP, Casey's 36 points and 28 assists in 48 games ranked first among U17 team defensemen.\nReturning to the NTDP for the 2021–22 season, he scored 33 points in 48 games, second among defensemen on the U18 team behind Lane Hutson. He was chosen as one of the top draft-eligible junior players in the United States to attend the 2023 USA Hockey All-American Game. After the season, he was selected in the second round of the 2022 NHL Entry Draft, 46th overall by the New Jersey Devils, the team he supported as a child.\nMaking good on his commitment to Michigan, Casey joined fellow Devils draftees Luke Hughes and Ethan Edwards on the Wolverines for the 2022–23 season. He scored a respectable 29 points in 37 games, second to Hughes among Michigan defensemen, and played one game at center, an exhibition match against the NTDP in which he had two goals and an assist. Michigan won the Big Ten Conference, but lost in the semi-finals of the 2023 Frozen Four to the eventual champions, Quinnipiac University.\nIn his sophomore season, the 2023–24 season, Casey recorded seven goals and 45 points in 39 games, earning All-Big Ten First Team and First Team All-American honors. For the second straight year, Michigan won the Big Ten only to be eliminated in the Frozen Four semi-finals.\nInternational play.\nCasey represented the United States at the 2022 IIHF World U18 Championships, scoring six points in as many games.\nCasey traveled with Team USA to the 2023 IIHF World Junior Championship, but did not dress for any games. Michigan teammate and fellow Devils draftee Luke Hughes also attended the tournament. \nCasey was named to Team USA's roster for the 2024 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, where he recorded six assists in six games en route to a gold medal. He missed one game due to illness."

He played a season with Mount Royal College before transferring to Calgary. He is regarded as one of the most talented inside players to ever play for the University of Calgary.\nBishop was a CIAU first team All-Canadian, Canada West first team All-Star and Canada West Player of the Year. Bishop was the first Calgary men's basketball player in history to be named an All-Canadian or Canada West Player of the Year.\nIn the 1976 season, he averaged 20.1 points and 8.8 rebounds per game. This year he led Calgary to be the Canada West champions and finish in the top 8 of the CIAU national tournament. This year he was also named the University of Calgary's male athlete of the year.\nOver the course of his four years at Calgary, Bishop averaged 12.4 points and 7.2 rebounds per game. Even though he played over 40 years ago, he is still the school's leading rebounder in terms of rebounds per game (7.2). And even though he only played 80 conference games, he still ranks fourth overall in rebounds with 577.\nIn 2007, Bishop was inducted into the University of Calgary Sports Hall of Fame. He was the second basketball player to be inducted into the university's hall of fame, the first being Karl Tilleman in 1995.\nInternational.\nBishop was a member of the Canadian national men's basketball team for six seasons (1977–80, 82–83). This included being named to the men's national team that qualified for the 1980 Moscow Olympics. However, Bishop unfortunately was unable to compete in these 1980 games given that Canada boycotted said Olympics as a result of the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan.\nThis 1980 Canadian men's team was positioned to perform well in these Olympics given that Canada competed for the bronze medal in the Olympic games preceding and following these 1980 Olympics (1976, 1984) and this time in Canadian basketball has been described as \"arguably the Canadian national team's greatest era\" and \"Canada's golden age of basketball\".\nDespite the 1980 boycott, Bishop competed in many international tournaments for Team Canada, including FIBA World Championships and Pan American games.\nCoaching.\nBishop later became an assistant coach for the University of Calgary men's basketball team. He was the interim head coach in the 1983–84 season when head coach, Gary Howard, took a sabbatical leave. Calgary performed well under Bishop this year, going 7–3 in conference play; 28-14 overall; and reaching the conference finals, losing to the University of Victoria en route to UVic winning their 5th consecutive national championship that year. This year, he was named Canada West co-coach of the year, along with University of Victoria's Ken Shields.\nBishop has also coached successfully at the high school level in Calgary at various schools.\nPersonal life.\nBishop graduated from the University of Calgary with a degree in Physical Education. He is a native Calgarian."

The flat course was technical, with 18 turns throughout. The race began at 18:55 with Caja Rural-Seguros RGA and concluded with defending champion's , who started at 20:19 and arrived at 20:36.\nThere was substantial controversy following the race, due to darkness (the sunset occurred before the race ended, at 20:33) and aggravating rain, which meant that most race favorites had to ride in both slippery and low visibility condition, as opposed to teams with an early start. , starting on second position, achieved the quickest time of the race, while several crashes occurred later in the race (including Laurens De Plus, who had to retire from the race as a result).\nMultiple riders questioned the decision to hold the race in the late evening, with defending champion Remco Evenepoel saying that \"[they] couldn't see anything\" in the dark and that the conditions were \"ridiculous\". Race director Javier Guillén responded, saying that the time trial was confounded by events beyond the control of the race. “Conditions yesterday surprised everyone. The darkness that came was the result of a storm that forecasts didn’t indicate would be of that magnitude...and concerning what Evenepoel said, we remind everyone that the safety of the riders is paramount. We couldn’t do anything about the dark conditions, it was something that ensued, and could not have been expected”.\nStage 2.\nDue to poor weather conditions, the general classification timing for the stage was taken 9 kilometres from the finish, prior to the technical Alto del Castillo de Monjuic.\nAlthough most of the 181.3 kilometre distance was travelled at a reasonably slow pace, multiple riders crashed, including race leader Lorenzo Milesi, Primož Roglič, and Geraint Thomas.

Sepulveda then surged ahead on his own after the group was brought back together. Amanuel Gehbreigzabhier and Pierre Latour bridged to Sepulveda, and were followed by Damiano Caruso, Jasha Sütterlin, Lennard Kämna, Andrea Vendrame, Rune Herregodts, Jon Barrenetxea, Mathis Le Berre, and José Manuel Díaz, forming a breakaway that established a margin of over 5 minutes from the chasing peloton.\nThe group then narrowed to only Kämna and Caruso at the base of the final Arinsal climb (8.3 kilometres at 7.7%). Kämna made several attempts to distance himself from Caruso during the ascent. In the last 3 kilometres, he successfully distanced Caruso, but was nevertheless soon caught by the peloton, which was paced viciously by Jay Vine. The rest of the stage featured a series of attacks from the lead group, which had thinned substantially during the Arinsal climb. Juan Ayuso attacked first, but was quickly countered by Sepp Kuss. Marc Soler then surged ahead and took the lead, as Geraint Thomas, a favourite for the podium, fell behind the lead group. Remco Evenepoel launched his sprint in the final 300 meters. Jonas Vingegaard was unable to keep pace, and the defending champion secured victory by a second ahead of his rivals. Evenepoel’s celebrations were short-lived, though, as he crashed after crossing the finish line, leaving him bleeding from a cut on his eyebrow. Caruso was awarded the most combative prize for the stage. \nThere was a significant shake-up in the overall standings, with Andrea Piccolo relinquishing his advantage having been distanced by the peloton during the stage. Evenepoel, Enric Mas and Lenny Martinez became the top three riders in the rankings for the red leader’s jersey, with Vingegaard in fourth.\nStage 4.\nStage 4 of the 2023 Vuelta a España was a flat to rolling stage of 185 km from Andorra la Vella to Tarragona, with two minor climbs in the second half of the stage. It was expected to be a day for the sprinters after the mountainous stage 3.\nThe stage started at 13:20 CEST, with a breakaway forming early on. The peloton, led by Soudal-QuickStep, Movistar, and Alpecin-Deceuninck, nonetheless gradually increased the pace and reduced the gap. The breakaway riders started to attack each other on the first climb of the day, the Alto de Belltall (9.3 kilometres at 3.7%), which was crested by Eduardo Sepúlveda, who opened a lead in the mountains classification over Remco Evenepoel. Sepúlveda took more points for the polka dot jersey on the second climb of the day, the Coll de Lilla (5.2 kilometres at 4.9%).\nThe final 30 kilometres of the stage were slightly downhill, with some technical sections and roundabouts. The breakaway tried to resist, but they were caught shortly after the final intermediate sprint. The sprint teams then started to position their fast men for the finale, with Alpecin-Deceuninck, Lotto Soudal, and among the most prominent. The last 5 kilometres into Tarragona were chaotic, with several crashes and splits in the peloton. The final kilometre was a technical run to the line, with a slight uphill gradient. Alpecin-Deceuninck led out the sprint for their Australian rider Kaden Groves, who powered past Sebastian Molano in the last meters to win the stage.\nRemco Evenepoel finished safely in the main group and retained his red jersey as the leader of the general classification. He also kept his white jersey as the leader of the young riders classification. \nStage 5.\nStage 5 was similar to stage 4 with a long, undulating stage profile (albeit with only one classified climb instead of two) and a technical sprint finish. Sepúlveda reached the summit of the classified climb first, extending his margin in the mountains classification ahead of the mountainous stage 6. \nSome riders fell in the final 5 kilometres as the peloton picked up speed, with Romain Bardet falling victim to crash-related time loss. Kaden Groves won the final sprint to extend his lead in the points classification, beating Filippo Ganna by a tire width. Dries Van Gestel was third. \nThe general classification contenders took a back seat to the sprinters, mostly saving their legs for stage 6. Race leader Remco Evenepoel provided the only action in the GC standings, taking the intermediate bonus sprint to extend his overall advantage by six seconds.\nStage 6.\nStage 6 was a gruelling test for the riders with the second summit finish of the race in The Observatorio Astrofísico de Javalambre (12 kilometres at 7.6% with sections up to 15%). An initial breakaway of around 40 riders was finally established after a series of attacks in the first hour of the race, building a lead of over six minutes on the peloton. Among them were Sepp Kuss, Lenny Martinez, and Romain Bardet. The breakaway held, and they reached the foot of the final climb with a lead of almost 4 minutes on the peloton. \nThe gap remained stable in the first half of the climb, but attacks soon began, with Einer Rubio attacking the lead group with 4.1 kilometres left of the climb. Bardet, Martinez and Kuss followed. Primož Roglič struck at a similar point from the GC group. Remco Evenepoel was distanced in the red jersey, with Enric Mas, Juan Ayuso and Cian Uijtdebroeks trying to limit their losses with Jonas Vingegaard following Roglič up the road. \nKuss then took the lead while Attila Valter dropped back for Roglič and Vingegaard, with Mas close behind. The duo then dropped Mas as Kuss put more distance into Martinez, who nonetheless was able to take the red jersey. Evenepoel limited his time loss, finishing around 30 seconds behind the Jumbo–Visma duo. Kuss won the stage and catapulted himself into second place in the general classification, ending the stage with an overall time that was nearly three minutes ahead of his leaders. \nStage 9.\nDue to poor weather conditions, the general classification timing for the stage was taken 2.050 metres from the finish."

After this time several local leagues were founded.\nTo unify darts in the Netherlands, the \"Nederlandse Darts Federatie\" (NDF or Dutch Darts Federation) came into existence in July 1989 of which the local branches became members. The federation started out with 12 membership organisations (the original local branches) which together had roughly 7,000 members.\nIn February 2005 the NDF was amalgamated into the association.\nThe first Dutch darter to appear at a world darts championship was Bert Vlaardingerbroek, who appeared at the 1988 Embassy World Darts Championship.\nWhen Raymond van Barneveld (who first played in the finals in 1995) won the 1998 Embassy World Darts Championship at Lakeside darts was fully put on the map in the Netherlands.\nActivities.\nAs of 2023 the NDB has 25 membership organisations and the total membership is about 33,000.\nThe association organises two national competitions, the \"LaCo\" (\"Landelijke Competitie\" or National Competition) and the SuperLeague. There are cup and division competitions, youth competitions, a national ranking circuit and international competitions such as the Dutch Open and the association selects competitors to international events abroad.\nThe NDB is a member of the World Darts Federation and is one of the largest leagues after the English darts association."

        "text": "The 2023–24 Stonehill Skyhawks men's ice hockey season was the 45th season of play for the program and 2nd at the Division I level. The Skyhawks represented Stonehill College and were coached by David Borges in his 10th season.\nSeason.\nFor their second season as a D-I team, Stonehill was able to put together a schedule mostly against their contemporaries. Unfortunately, the team was not yet up to Division I standards. Stonehill's offense was lacking in firepower, averaging only about 20 shots per game which resulted in well under 2 goals per match. Conversely, the team's defense was porous and the goaltending suffered; the Skyhawks allowed more than 40 shots against per contest, resulting in just under 6 goals against per game. That is a recipe for disaster and the team's record bears that out.\nFrom the very start of the season the Skyhawks netminders were under siege and were rarely able to catch their breaths. Dylan Meilun, the primary starter during the year, turned in a few decent performances but for the first 28 games the offense was too weak to take advantage. Even in the few matches against lower-tier clubs, Stonehill was unable to find a way to earn a victory and the team seemed destined for a winless campaign. Late January saw the team show some signs of life when the offense produced its best effort on the year. Though they lost to Lindenwood in overtime, the next series between the two saw Stonehill finally get its first win against a Division I opponent (albeit one of the worst teams that year). Not satisfied with just one victory, the Skyhawks won their next game as well, winning their final two home games. Their winning streak ended as soon as they hit the road and Stonehill lost their final six games to end the year.\nStonehill was able to avoid total ignominy with their two wins but that didn't stop the team from being ranked among the worst teams in college hockey history. While others have had worse records (1961 Brown, 1962 Colorado College) there haven't been many. Stonehill's 34 losses on the year put them one shy of the all-time record, held by 2014 Alabama–Huntsville.\nShortly after the end of the season, head coach David Borges announced his retirement, bringing his 26-year coaching career to a close.\nA game with Saint Anselm scheduled for February 13 was cancelled due to inclement weather.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\nRankings.\n&lt;br&gt;"

The Bulldogs represent Ferris State University, played their home games at Ewigleben Arena and were coached by Bob Daniels in his 32nd season.\nSeason.\nFerris State began the year with a stretch of up-and-down hockey. In the first two months of the season, the offense was middling but consistent. The goaltending duties were split between Logan Stein and Noah Giesbrecht with both providing reliable netminding. By early December, the team was near .500 and had shown signs of improvement. Unfortunately, that was when their season began to unravel. A dip in scoring resulted in seven game losing streak that set the team at the bottom of the standings, where they would remain for the rest of the year.\nThe team recovered a bit after the Great Lakes Invitational, earning a split with league champion Bemidji State and then winning four in a row to close out January. However, the scoring faltered for a second time afterwards and the team was unable to win any of its final nine games.\nDespite its poor finish, Ferris State was nearly able to pull off an upset in the first round of the conference tournament. Twice the team was able to get a 2-goal advantage in their opening game against Bemidji State but they were unable to hold onto either of their leads. The overtime goal appeared to sap whatever energy the team had left and they were swept out of the conference tournament with an 0–4 loss.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular season\n!colspan=12 ! style=\"\"; | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \nRankings.\n&lt;br&gt;"

He played college football at Butte before transferring to Oregon and was signed by the Cowboys as an undrafted free agent after the 2023 NFL draft.\nEarly years.\nBass was born on March 31, 1999. He attended Mount Baker High School in Deming, Washington, where he played football and track, being a tight end and defensive end in the former. He was named the conference co-most valuable player and an all-state selection as a senior, but was ranked a zero-star recruit. He had no offers to play college football but enrolled at the University of Idaho following his time at Mount Baker.\nCollege career.\nBass grayshirted at Idaho before joining Butte College in January 2018. He played two seasons for the Butte Roadrunners and was a top player for the team at offensive guard; he earned first-team California All-American honors as a freshman and as a sophomore again received the honor while also being all-conference and a junior college All-American. He was ranked a four-star junior college recruit and was named the best junior college offensive guard nationally by 247Sports. Bass received many high-level Division I offers and eventually chose to play for the Oregon Ducks.\nIn his first year at Oregon, 2020, Bass started all seven games at left guard and earned honorable mention all-conference honors. In 2021, he started all 14 games, the first six at left guard and the final eight at left tackle, being named a first-team All-Pac-12. Bass started every game again in his final season, 2022, and was named first-team All-Pac-12 and a second-team All-American by \"The Athletic\". He was invited to the NFLPA Collegiate Bowl after the season. He finished his college career having started all 34 games for the Ducks, 13 at left guard and the rest at left tackle.\nProfessional career.\nAfter going unselected in the 2023 NFL draft, Bass was signed by the Dallas Cowboys as an undrafted free agent. He impressed the team in preseason, being the only lineman on the team not to allow a quarterback pressure in their three games. On August 29, 2023, the Cowboys announced that he had made the initial 53-man roster."

        "text": "The 1923–24 Boston University Terriers men's ice hockey season was the fourth season of play for the program. The Terriers were coached by John O’Hare in his second season.\nSeason.\nFor the second season after their return, BU was hoping to build on a solid performance in '23. The opening match early in the year made it appear that this may even be possible as the Terriers dropped MIT with a 7-goal performance. A week later BU met Harvard for the first of two games on the year. If the first period the two were evenly match and, though Harvard scored first, Blais knocked in an Almer rebound to even the count. However, Harvard was able to deploy an entirely new contingent of players in the second period and the fresh reserved rolled right over the Terrier defense. After three goals were scored in quick succession, Kelley replaced Hurteau in goal but that didn't stem the Crimson tide. Harvard got one more goal before the end of the period and then tacked on three more in the third to turn the match into an embarrassing route. The team's woes continued a few days later when a raw Princeton team arrived in town and easily dispatched BU.\nBoston University had several weeks off before their next game and coach O’Hare was hoping that extended training sessions would hale to improve the team's offense. Unfortunately, the lack of scoring continued upon their return and the Terriers scored just one goal in their next game. The rematch with Harvard followed at the end of the month but, now without Almer, nothing seemed to be working for the Terriers. Harvard scored 5 goals in the first 20 minutes to take a commanding lead and, though the defense played much better in the second half, the forwards were unable to penetrate the Harvard defenses.\nThe Terriers hit the road in February, travelling up to Maine for a pair of matches at the beginning of the month. The dearth of scoring continued in a loss to the Association of St. Dominiques but the offense finally returned the following day. Maine opened a 2-goal lead after the first period before Kontoff and Provost combined to tie the game in the second. However, just as the Terriers were beginning to think that they may have a chance at a win, the Black Bears responded with two quick goals in the third to keep BU's losing streak alive.\nThe following week, BU headed south for a rematch with Princeton. The Tigers were coming off of their exam break and hadn't been on the ice in weeks but were still too much for the Terriers. Boston University was able to keep up with Princeton for the first 10 minutes but the defense faltered afterwards. The lack of reserves severely hampered the Terriers as Princeton used the same tactic that Harvard had employed by cycling through several lines of players to keep their skaters fresh. BU used only one alternate in the game and was outskated by the Tigers all evening. A few days later, the team's finale came against Yale but they didn't have any more luck then they had in New Jersey. The Bulldogs scored early and often, ending the first period with a 4-goal lead. Afterward, the team took a more casual approach to the game and only scored once in each of the succeeding periods. BU, however, was shutout for the fifth time on the year and ended the worst campaign in program history on a sour note.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "Bojan Božović (born 23 February 1987) was a Serbian former professional tennis player and tennis coach. In his career, Božović defeated several world-renowned players, such as Ernests Gulbis, Robin Haase, Marin Čilić, Sergei Bubka, and Fabio Fognini, but he is now better known for his role in Novak Djokovic's junior career.\nEarly life.\nBožović was born on 23 February 1987 in Belgrade, Serbia, to a sports family, so he showed his interest in sports from an early age. He started training in tennis at the age of six. When he was 14, he was already two meters tall, and his height helped him develop a very powerful serve, which became his main weapon. He started competing in 1998 and immediately achieved outstanding results. Some of his mentors were Božidar Matić and Goran Zindović.\nCareer.\nIn 2000, Božović became a member of the newly opened Gemax club, where he had his own private coach, Goran Grbović. One of the players he trained with at the Gemax club academy was Novak Djokovic, who was just three months younger and who began working with Grbović informally. In 2001, he was a U14 State tennis champion. In April 2001, in Italy, Božović participated in three ETA tournaments in the U14 circuit of the Tennis Europe Junior Tour, with his best performance coming in Messina, in the second category, where he was beaten in the final by Djokovic, while in the doubles he won alongside him.\nHe became a member of the national team at the age of 14 and played for the Yugoslavia national team in the age categories of U14, U16 and U18. In June 2001, Božović was part of the Yugoslavian team; which also included Djokovic, Branko Kuzmanovic, and Denis Bejtulahi, and coached by Janko Vucetic; that won the European Summer Cup. In the tournament itself, held in Tarragona, Božović lost his singles matches with Italy in the quarters and Russia in the semis, but then redeemed himself by winning the decisive match of the final against Slovenia. In July, Božović played in the U14 European Junior championship, held in Sanremo, and won the doubles event alongside Djokovic, beating Russia’s Mikhail Bekker and Alexandre Krasnoroutskiy in the final, 7-6 7-5. They thus joined the likes of Mats Wilander and Thomas Enqvist, who had also won a gold medal in this tournament. This was Djokovic’s first international individual title. In August, Božović was part of the Yugoslavian team that finished as runner-ups of the ITF World Junior Championship in Prostejov.\nIn 2001, the then Prime Minister of Serbia, Zoran Djindjic, awarded him a letter of thanks from the Ministry of Youth and Sports for his development and contribution to sports and raising the reputation of his country. He finished the 2001 season in 16th place in the ETA ranking for under 14 years.\nAfter Gemax, he then joined TK Partizan, and trained there until the end of his career in 2007. In 2003, he was a U16 State team champion with Partizan, a U16 State champion, and a Senior National Champion. In that same year, he was part of the Serbian team that won the U16 European championship.\nIn 2004, he was a U18 State Champion, and both a U18 and a Senior State team champion with Partizan. In total, Božović won the National Championship in individual and team categories a total of 10 times.\nAfter he stopped playing tennis professionally due to injuries, he started working as a coach and in five years managed to build a strong reputation as a professional coach.\nCoaching.\nBožović came to Switzerland in 2012 as a hardworking and ambitious man with a vision. He immediately began working with great effort, building a path towards the realization of his goal, which was the formation of a tennis academy. He finally founded his Academy in 2014, where he is working as a tennis coach, president, and Chief Executive Officer (CEO). His duties include the oversight of day-to-day operations and management decisions, as well as developing, implementing, and executing the Academy’s long and short-term plans.\nBefore the 2014 Paris Masters final against Milos Raonic, a player with a powerful serve, Djokovic decided to train his returns, and although he enjoyed the assistance from his two coaches, Boris Becker and Marian Vajda, he expressly wanted to practice his return with Božović, who was very tall.\nBožović has developed his players and has been focused on making coaches and players in his Academy better every day. Most notably, he sponsored the 2021 European tennis champion in the under-14 competition, Nikola Djosic. The Božović Academy was Djosic's tennis home for three years, but he is now in the program of Swiss Tennis Association and is regarded as a great hope for Swiss tennis.\nBožović has worked with many Serbian best juniors: Natasa Zoric (former No. 388 WTA in Singles), Kristina Ostojic (No.2 in Serbia U18), Predrag Marjanovic (No.1 in Serbia U16), Ivana Draskovic (No.2 in Serbia U16), Stefan Dinic (No.10 in Serbia U14), Anastasija Cobanovic (No.2 in Serbia U14).\nBožović was also a sports director of Novak Tennis Center in Belgrade in 2021, where he was one of the main figures in setting up the system, organization, and founding Novak Tennis Academy."

        "title": "Ice hockey in Wyoming",
        "text": "Wyoming has one of the weakest connections to ice hockey in the United States.\nHistory.\nAs the least populous state and the second most sparsely populated, Wyoming has never been an attractive target by external sources in the sport. The few attempts from internal initiatives have seen mixed results and have been relegated to the fringes.\nThe first major attempt at adding ice hockey came from the flagship college, the University of Wyoming. The Cowboys played their first varsity season in 1948–49 but ran into some major problems. While the team had sought to capitalize on the westward expansion of ice hockey and play a combination of college teams and amateur clubs (similar to other schools at the time), Wyoming had a tough time scheduling opponents. The team was limited to approximately 30 games over three seasons, mostly due to travel costs to and from Laramie. With little chance of their situation improving, the team was shuttered in 1951 and had only resurfaced off and on as a club sport afterwards.\nNo further serious efforts were made to establish a team in Wyoming until the early-21st century when the Coeur d'Alene Colts, a junior team in the Northern Pacific Hockey League (NorPac) moved to Cody. The Yellowstone Quake were terrible in their first two seasons but then experienced a sharp swing in year 3. The newfound success allowed the team to establish itself in its new home and leave the NorPac when instability threatened the league. After founding the American West Hockey League with several other former members of the NorPac, the league merged with the NA3HL in 2014. The team was able to win three division titles before the end of the decade and remain a member of the league (as of 2023). Yellowstone was joined by the expansion Gillette Wild in 2011, and the relocated Sheridan Hawks in 2019.\nWhile the NA3HL increased its footprint in Wyoming, the 2011 relocated of the Tulsa Rampage to Cheyenne was less successful. The Cheyenne Stampede were members of the WSHL, a Tier III Junior A league. The Stampede had some success in their first three seasons, however, after 2014 the club faltered and produced 5 consecutive losing seasons. In 2019, the team's financial situation changed due to a new initiative led by Cheyenne mayor, Marian Orr. Team owner Mark Lantz claimed that in the new lease offered in 2018, the team's area fees were increased by 52% and that they were prevented from advertising at the Cheyenne Ice and Events Center. Orr responded that the new lease was arranged so that the rinks would no be subsidized with taxpayer money. Lantz put the team up for sale while negotiations were underway but no buyer was found and when the deadline for extending the lease passed, the team ceased operations.\nTeams.\nTimeline.\n \nPlayers.\nWhile the state does have a decent level of engagement with the sport (0.379% of the population registered with USA Hockey in 2023), the overall low population and long stretches without an established team have left Wyoming without any ice hockey players of note."

The Crusaders, behind coach Alvin \"Doggie\" Julian, George Kaftan, Joe Mullaney and sophomore point guard Bob Cousy, reached the Final Four for the second straight season before losing to Kentucky in the National semifinals. Holy Cross defeated Kansas State in the Third place game.\nPrevious season.\nThe Crusaders, who played their home games at Boston Garden and the South High Community School in Worcester, Massachusetts, won their first four games of 1946–47, tripped through a three-game losing streak, then finished the year with 23 straight victories.\nThe team entered the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament as the last seed in the 8-team tournament. In the first match, Holy Cross defeated the United States Naval Academy in front of a sold-out crowd at Madison Square Garden by a score of 55 to 47. Mullaney led the team in scoring with 18 points, mostly in part to Navy coach Ben Carnevale's decision to have his players back off from Mullaney, who was reputed as being more of a playmaker than a shooter. In the semi-final match, Holy Cross faced the City College of New York (CCNY), coached by Nat Holman, one of the game's earliest innovators. The Crusaders, led by Kaftan's 30-point game, easily defeated the Beavers 60–45. In the championship game, Holy Cross faced the University of Oklahoma, behind coach Bruce Drake, in another sold-out game at Madison Square Garden. Kaftan followed up the semi-final match with 18 points in the title game, leading the Crusaders to a 58–47 victory against the Sooners.\nHoly Cross became the first school from the New England area, as well as the state of Massachusetts, to win a national college basketball title. The Crusaders finished the 1947 season with 23 straight wins. Afterward, 35,000 people watched a parade in the team's honor on Holy Cross Day in Worcester. Future NBA legend Cousy was named AP and UP player of the year, and George Kaftan was voted to the all-decade team of the 1940s by the NCAA in 1989.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=9 style=| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=| NCAA tournament"

Tanzania is one of the first seven founding nations of the Badminton Confederation of Africa. In the 1990s Tanzanian players have made numerous achievements in the African stage, winning two bronze medals at the 1992 African Badminton Championships. \nSince the 2000s, the team became inactive from international team tournaments due to insufficient funds which impacted Tanzanian badminton's decrease in popularity. Many regional badminton tournaments, such as the Nyerere Badminton Championships and the Dar Cup have been hosted to revive badminton in Tanzania. As of 2022, the national team along with its association is still inactive. \nHistory.\nBadminton in Tanzania began in the mid-20th century when the country was still under British rule. After the country gained independence from the British in 1961, the Tanganyika national badminton team was formed and soon competed in tournaments hosted around the country, such as the Tanganyika International.\nMen's team.\nIn early 1979, Tanzania sent its men's team to compete in the men's team event at the inaugural African Badminton Championships. The team finished in third place. In June 1979, the team competed in the men's team event at the 1979 WBF World Championships. The team were placed in Group 4 with Thailand, Burma and Mauritius. The team lost 5–0 to Thailand and Burma. In their third playoff, the team lost 3–2 to Mauritius and were eliminated in the group stages.\nThe team also achieved bronze on home soil at the 1984 African Badminton Championships. In 1992, the team took part in qualifying for the 1992 Thomas &amp; Uber Cup in Hong Kong. The team were drawn to Group C with Hong Kong, Australia and Sri Lanka. The team failed to qualify after losing 5–0 to all three teams in their group.\nWomen's team.\nThe Tanzanian women's team competed in the 1979 African Badminton Championships and finished in third place. In 1992, the team competed in the 1992 Thomas &amp; Uber Cup regional qualifiers in Hong Kong alongside the men's team. The team lost all their matches to Hong Kong, New Zealand and the Philippines in their group tie.\nIn 1984, the team failed to a secure medal position at the 1984 African Badminton Championships.\nMixed team.\nThe Tanzanian mixed team competed in the 1984 African Badminton Championships and finished in fourth place."

The Wildcats represented Northern Michigan University in the 2023–24 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season, played their home games at Berry Events Center and were coached by Grant Potulny in his 7th season.\nSeason.\nDespite high hopes for a squad that was picked to finish second in the conference pre-season poll, Northern Michigan got off to a poor start. With four games against ranked opponents to begin with, the Wildcats had the opportunity to gain some notoriety early in the year, however, Béni Halász struggled in goal and the team was unable to overcome his slump. One bright spot was the stellar debut of Tanner Latsch, who had sat out the entire previous season while recovering from hip surgery. The redshirt freshman recorded a hat-trick in his first college game and then scored in each of the next three as well. Unfortunately, he was bit by the injury bug against Ferris State and played just three games afterwards.\nThe loss of Latsch was bad enough but the team was also in desperate need for offense. Northern Michigan got a reprieve in mid-November when backup Charlie Glockner turned in a few good performances but those results were unsustainable. Halász did start playing better once he got his starting job back but the scoring never really materialized. Over the course of the season, the Wildcats recorded 40 fewer goals than they had in 2023, which equated to about 0.8 goals per game. Even with the defense improving as the season went along, that missing offense prevented the team from being able to capitalize on its chances and left NMU stuck in neutral. In the second half of the season, Northern Michigan lost just five games, however, the team was unable to break a tie on several occasions and could only manage a .500 mark in the spring semester.\nThe mediocre results placed the team 5th in the conference and forced them to hit the road for their playoff series with Minnesota State. The first game saw the Wildcats outshoot the Mavericks by a wide margin, particularly in the second, but the pop-gun offense could only muster a single goal and the team fell 1–2. They opened the scoring in the rematch with a shorty from André Ghantous but afterwards NMU could only watch as the Minnesota State offense poured on the offense to the tune of 6 goals. The Wildcats couldn't come close to matching that output and quietly ended their disappointing season.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \nRankings.\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "title": "2023–24 St. Thomas (Minnesota) Tommies men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 2023–24 St. Thomas (Minnesota) Tommies men's ice hockey season was the 100th season of play for the program, the 3rd in Division I and the 3rd in the CCHA. The Tommies represented the University of St. Thomas (Minnesota), played their home games at the St. Thomas Ice Arena and were coached by Enrico Blasi in his 3rd season.\nSeason.\nHigh roster turnover continued to remake the Tommies as the team was looking to fully become a Division I program. Most of the departed personnel were from their D-III era and were replaced by ones with a higher level of talent, several of whom were transfers. St. Thomas demonstrated just how much they had chanced when the team opened with a pair of 1-goal decisions against #8 St. Cloud State, splitting the home-and-home series. While they weren't quite as successful the following week against the #2 team in the nation, the fact that the team was able to push Minnesota into overtime spoke volumes. One early development for the Tommies was the introduction of a goaltending rotation that saw Aaron Trotter share responsibilities with Niagara transfer Jake Sibell. St. Thomas benefitted from the arrangement and saw the club put together a 5-game winning streak in November to climb to the top of the conference standings.\nThe offense, too, was looking better through the first two months of the season. While the team had been shutout three times early in the year, the winning streak saw the Tommies' production soar to new heights and make it possible for the team to possess a winning record by December. Unfortunately, the scoring became inconsistent afterwards and the Tommies stumbled to the winter break. In the final seven games of 2023, the offense scored more than 2 goals just once and lost five of those matches.\nSt. Thomas didn't restart its conference schedule until mid-January but the time off seemed to help the team. Upon their return, the Tommies swept Michigan Tech for the first time in school history and regained the top spot in the conference. However, after splitting the succeeding two weekend series, the team ran into another rough patch. In February the goaltending began to flag and St. Thomas won just once in their final eight games. The losses cost the Tommies their chance at a regular season title but they still managed to finish 2nd. Unfortunately, injuries played a large part in the second half of the season for the Tommies. They began to rack up in December and continued consistently the rest of the year. This forced defensemen Jase Sofo and Braidan Simmons-Fischer to play out of position at forward beginning in January. By the time the CCHA playoffs began, 8 players were injured and unable to play, and St. Thomas only had 17 healthy skaters (non-goalies) available to dress, when teams are permitted to play up to 19 for a game.\nThe team's reward was a meeting with Lake Superior State and their first home playoff game since joining the CCHA. However, despite their position in the standings, St. Thomas was not heavily favored in the series. Aside from the skid to end the season, the Tommies only had one more win than the Lakers in conference play and actually had a (slightly) worse overall record. The teams then demonstrated their similarity by splitting the first two games in the quarterfinals to set up a deciding third game. St. Thomas was able to use its power play to get two 1-goal leads and carried the advantage deep into the third but they could not sustain their edge. Both teams continued to fight for the next goal over the final nine minutes of the game. Just when it appeared that the match was destined for overtime, Lake Superior got on a rush and fired a strong shot on goal. Trotter made a tremendous save but the puck bound high in the air and fell at the feet of a Laker player standing in the crease. He slammed the rubber home before any of the purple defenders could stop him and gave Lake State the winning marker with under 7 seconds to play.\nIn spite of the heartbreaking end, St. Thomas had made great strides during the season. The Tommies had seen modest improvements on both offense and defense and, with more than have of the roster comprising underclassmen, the program has the potential to continue their ascent.\nAn exhibition match against USNTDP that was scheduled for January 27 was cancelled.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \nRankings.\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "text": "Briars Rugby is an Australian rugby union club playing in the New South Wales Suburban Rugby Union competition. The club currently plays at Rothwell Park.\nHistory.\nThe Briars Rugby Club was formed on 7 August 1918, by an assembly of fourteen boys aged between 9 and 13 years, convened at the disused fowl yard situated on Bob Clark's property. The name \"The Briars Sporting Club\" was chosen. This was later renamed to \"The Briars Sporting Club\". For the club's colors, a piece of red cloth with the emblem \"T.B.S.C\" (The Briars Sporting Club) embroidered in gold letters, contributed by Mrs. Rudd, was the initial choice, but the club's colors were later changed to maroon and gold by collective preference.\nCricket and rugby matches were played by the club's members. Cricket matches were held in member Bob Clark's backyard, while rugby was played in local paddocks. A pledge against smoking was taken on November 6, 1918, although its legitimacy waned when its legal validity was questioned. The club also had a swear box to curb the use of profanity, but was later abandoned.\nBetween 1919 and 1924, the club held annual sports carnivals. The first carnival, held at St. Luke's Oval, included 22 events and 20 participants. The club's badge and motto were introduced during the Second Annual Athletic Day in 1920. The motto \"Virtus Animusque Praesens\" (\"Virtue and Spirit in the Present\") was proposed by Mr. Dennis, the neighbor of Geoff Whiddon.\nThe club had 34 members by 1920. On January 31, 1920, the Briars' Library was opened with 78 books donated by nine boys at its inception, which grew to 241 books within a year.\nThe club held a fireworks display on Empire Night in 1920.\nIn 1923 the club's formal participated in the 2nd Grade N.S.W. Junior Rugby Union with a match against Paddington, which the club lost. The club won several subsequent matches, culminating in its first football premiership in the 1925 season, and the club established a 2nd XV rugby team.\nBriars acquired a club room at 34A George Street, Burwood in October 1929. On its centenary the club had 250 members and supporters. They subsequently won 18 premierships. The club formed an associated women's rugby team, which later became two senior women's teams, which won in the Plate Final at the Borneo 7s in Malaysia. The club's Women's President is David Lannan, and the Coach is Trent Eagle."

        "title": "2023–24 Michigan Tech Huskies men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 2023–24 Michigan Tech Huskies men's ice hockey season was the 103rd season of play for the program and 6th in the CCHA. The Huskies represented Michigan Technological University in the 2023–24 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season, played their home games at MacInnes Student Ice Arena and were coached by Joe Shawhan in his 7th season.\nSeason.\nDue to a hazing incident, at Bowling Green, Austen Swankler left the program just before the start of the season. After entering the transfer portal, he announced that he had decided to join Michigan Tech. Due to transfer rules, Swankler would not be able to play for the Huskies until the spring semester.\nTech was adding Swankler to a club that had high expectations for itself. Their leading scorer from '23, Kyle Kukkonen, was now entering his second season and the team was backstopped by All-American Blake Pietila, who had returned for a fifth season. While there was a good deal of roster turnover, Tech was still picked to win the CCHA title in the preseason poll. The Huskies entered the year ranked in the top 10 nationally but did not get off to a good start. After tying Minnesota Duluth in the US Hockey Hall of Fame Game, Pietila had a rough couple of weeks in goal. The offense, which was still sorting itself out, got very little help from Kukkonen as he went goal-less in October. Michigan Tech didn't score more than 2 goals in any of their seven contests during the month and finished the month with a dreadful 0–4–3 record.\nAdding insult to injury, Patriks Marcinkēvičs had filed a misconduct claim with the university about head coach Joe Shawhan. The Long Island transfer claimed that he had suffered mental abuse in the form of \"hurtful comments\" while the coach had \"fostered a divisive culture\". During the subsequent investigation, the school found that Shawhan had kicked Marcinkēvičs out of multiple practices since the beginning of the season. Additionally, in the Huskies' game on October 21, Marcinkēvičs had been benched for the third period after be called for an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty in the second, his second minor of the night. Two days later, Marcinkēvičs was kicked out of practice yet again and proceeded to clean out his locker of his own volition. He met with Shawhan afterwards and recorded their conversation without the coach's knowledge. While Marcinkēvičs intended to return at some future date, the school informed him that while it was conducting its investigation into the accusations, he would be unable to return to the team. After three weeks, the school announced that it had completed its review and no action would be taken. When asked for further detail, Michigan Tech said that they were unable to disclose any details of the investigation due to FERPA regulations. The only other detail that was reported was that after Marcinkēvičs had left the team, no other player had come forth with any accusations against the coach. In the interim, Marcinkēvičs had made the recording public and given an interview to TV6 to give his side of the story. Despite his initial intentions, after the review Marcinkēvičs was not allowed to return to the program and instead signed a professional contract.\nAt the height of the investigation, Tech finally found its offense and swept Augustana for its first wins of the season. The weekend was the coming out party for Isaac Gordon, who recorded a hat-trick in the first game, while fellow freshmen Chase Pietila and Max Koskipirtti also began to grow comfortable in their roles with the team. It took Blake Pietila a little longer to find his form but eventually the team began to play up to expectations and a very good November brought the team up to .500.\nAfter Christmas, the Huskies battled at the Great Lakes Invitational and after a narrow victory over Alaska (its first against a non-CCHA team), Tech found themselves pitted against #7 Michigan State. Though they outclassed in the match, Blake Pietila and Jack Works combined to produced one of the best performances of the season. Tech was outshot 57–25 in the game but Pietila kept his team in the match. He kept MSU off of the scoresheet for long stretches, enabling Works to give the Huskies two separate leads in the game. After Works completed his hat-trick in the third, Pietila turned aside a withering barrage and though he was unable to keep everything out, he did get his club into overtime. The match eventually went to a shootout and Pietila stopped all three attempts by Michigan State, allowing the marker from Ryland Mosley to stand as the winning score.\nWhile all signs pointed to Tech having overcome its poor start, the team proceeded to immediately fall on its face and get swept by St. Thomas. The team then played .500 hockey over the next four weeks as the offense began to struggle. During this month-long stretch, the defense was about the only thing holding the team together. It wasn't until late-February that the offense woke up once more and Tech finished strong to pull into a tie with St. Thomas. However, because the Tommies had the tie-breaker, Tech was given the third seed for the CCHA tourament.\nThe Huskies opened their postseason run against Bowling Green, however, they would do so without Swankler. When the forward hit the ice at the Great Lakes Invitational he initially looked right at home and recorded 3 assists in his first three games. Afterwards, however, he went pointless in seven while the team went through its offensive dry spell. In early November, Swankler was felled by an undisclosed injury that would cost him the rest of his season. With him unable to participate, it fell to the rest of the Huskies to get revenge in his name. Gordon's 3-point game was more then enough when Blake Pietila posted his fourth shutout of the season Tech continued to hammer the puck at the net in the rematch but a poor game from Pietila let a little drama creep in; the Falcons went 2-for-2 on the power play and twice were able to take the lead despite getting just 15 shots in the game. Tech, however, continued its offensive surge and scored 4 power play goals. A second 3-point effort from Gordon was just what the team needed to win a 1-goal game and advance to the semifinals.\nAgainst Minnesota State, Tech needed all of the offense it could muster. Three separate times the Huskies got behind but each time they managed to tie the game. Special teams once again were key for Tech as they scored on the power play and had Logan Pietila score late in the third on a penalty shot. As the final seconds were ticking away, Tech fired a puck towards the Maverick net. While the shot looked to be going wide, the MSU netminder kicked it away. Instead of going into the corner, however, the puck deflected up behind the net and struck the glass. It rebounded back over the goal and a Minnesota State defender went to swipe it away from danger. He missed the puck which instead struck him in the helmet, then bounced back towards the goal and dropped behind the goaltender and into the cage. Logan Pietila was given credit for his second goal of the game and with just 9 seconds left on the clock, it proved to be the game-winner. In the championship game, there were fewer goals but no less drama. Bemidji State opened the scoring but, less than a minute later, Chase Pietila tied the score. Rylan Mosley's 18th of the season in the middle of the second period gave Tech the lead and from then on it was up to Blake Pietila to carry them to the finish. Their star netminder stopped 17 shots in the third, as well as a Beaver power play in the final 5 minutes, to lead the Huskies to victory and send Tech back to the NCAA tournament.\nDue in no small part to their terrible non-conference record, Michigan Tech received the 16th and last seed and was set against Boston College. The Huskies played the Eagles well in the first two periods and a short-handed goal from Max Koskipirtti gave some hope that Tech might be able to pull off the upset. Down by just 1 goal entering the third, BC's vaunted offense took over and they scored three goals in quick succession. Michigan Tech had no response and the game was all but over with 10 minutes to play. The final nail in the coffin came when Mosley was given a match penalty for contact to the head and BC scored twice on the ensuing major penalty. Regardless of the sour end, Michigan Tech had battled to several obstacles to produce a successful season.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \nRankings.\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "text": "The 2023–24 Ohio State Buckeyes men's ice hockey season is the 61st season for the program and 11th season in the Big Ten Conference. The Buckeyes represent the Ohio State University in the 2023-24 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season, playing their home games at Value City Arena and are coached by Steve Rohlik in his 11th season.\nSeason.\nAfter falling to the Quinnipiac Bobcats in the second round of the 2023 NCAA Division tournament, the Buckeyes looked to build upon the success they had in previous seasons.\nAlthough the Buckeyes brought in 16 new players through either the transfer portal or out of high school, they still went into the season losing some big names. Among these were goaltender Jakub Dobeš, who had served as the starter for the previous two seasons, and captain Gustaf Westlund. They also lost defensemen Cole McWard and Mason Lohrei to professional contracts. The departures highlighted a successful period in Buckeye hockey in terms of recruitment and regular season success. Among notable additions to the team was transfer Jake Dunlap, who joined his brother Joe Dunlap on the Buckeyes.\nAs expected, the Buckeyes started off in the middle of the pack in the rankings, being ranked 13th and 15th by USCHO.com and USA Today, respectively. Although a 3-1-3 start would allow them be ranked as high as 13th in both polls in Week 4, things would quickly get worse for the Buckeyes from there. Between November 3rd and December 9th, the Buckeyes would only win two games - non-conference games against Princeton. This would drop their record 5-8-4, including a 0-8-2 record in Big Ten play. This slide would knock them out of both USCHO.com and USA Today rankings by Week 6.\nThe Buckeyes would finally register their first season win against a Big Ten opponent on January 12, 2024 against Notre Dame. Unfortunately, this wouldn't spark anything for the team, as they would lose seven straight afterwards, all against Big Ten teams. However, after the losing streak, the Buckeyes would be rattle off three straight upset wins against the #4 ranked team, the first two against the Wisconsin Badgers, and one against the Michigan State Spartans. They would lose the final three games of the season, bringing their regular season record to 12-18-4, and an abysmal 4-18-2 in inter-conference play. It was their worst conference record since they joined the conference and worst since 1994–95.\nThe Buckeyes, unsurprisingly, entered the 2024 Big Ten tournament as the worst-seeded #7 team, and would face off against #2 seeded Wisconsin, who was ranked #5 overall. The Buckeyes would stun the Badgers and they won the series 2-1, moving on to face the top seeded Spartans. Despite a good effort against the top-seeded Spartans, the Buckeyes would fall 2-1, ending their season.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \nRankings.\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "title": "2023–24 American International Yellow Jackets men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 2023–24 American International Yellow Jackets men's ice hockey season was the 76th season of play for the program, the 26th at the Division I level and 21st in the Atlantic Hockey conference. The Yellow Jackets represented American International College, played their home games at MassMutual Center and were coached by Eric Lang in his eighth season.\nSeason.\nWhile many of the team's key skaters were returning this season, the Yellow Jackets had a quandary in goal. Senior Alexandros Aslanadis had shown flashes of good goaltending over the previous two seasons but had yet to serve as the primary netminder. Conversely, freshman Nils Wallström entered the program with a solid résumé in the Swedish junior leagues and NAHL but he had yet to face the collegiate level of competition. Coach Lang decided to throw Wallström into the deep end at the beginning of the season, with the first-year netminder facing down Massachusetts and defending national champions, Quinnipiac. Wallström survived for two games before his inexperience got the better of him and he was pulled in the second match with the Bobcats. Wallström was able to retain the net as his play stabilized and he soon established himself as AIC's best option in goal.\nThe forward unit was a slightly more cohesive group at the start but it was the defense that allowed American International to overcome its early rough patch. From the start of November, the defenders, led by Brian Kramer, gave their young netminder the time needed to grow accustomed to the college game and held off the opposing attack. Over a 14-game span the team allowed more than 30 shots on goal just once and routinely kept their foes at or near the 20-shot mark. The stellar play on defense helped the team put together a six-game winning streak and put them within a game of 1st-place in the conference by Christmas.\nAfter returning form the break, AIC stumbled through the first few weeks of January and the team began to slide down the standings. After a week off, their inconsistent offense could only manage a split with Robert Morris but then the injury bug began to bite the team. John Lundy was injured in the first match with the Colonials while Alfred Lindberg and Alexander Malinowski were both lost a week later. One week on, Brian Kramer was felled and the team suddenly found itself without four of its top seven scorers. While the various ailments were feared to be season-ending, Lundy and Kramer managed to get back into the lineup by the start of the postseason.\nIn the wake of the injuries, the team had to rely more heavily on Wallström and Aslanidis. The two played their best games of the season and helped AIC get points in each of the final five games; however, it was not quite enough to keep the team in the top four and ensure a home stand in the conference quarterfinals. AIC did manage to hold onto a bye so they would not risk getting knocked out in the first round and it gave their injured players time to heal.\nAmerican International opened their postseason with probably the most difficult position as they had to travel to Colorado to take on Air Force. Fortunately for the Yellow Jackets, they had already made a trip and at least knew what to expect with the altitude. The team was largely outplayed in the first game but Wallström continued his inspired play and allowed just a single goal. Air Force broke through at the beginning of the second game and built a 2-goal lead in the first period. AIC stormed back with 20 shots in the second; however, none of them managed to find the back of the net. It was not until the start of the third when they finally broke through but their harrying attack subsided a bit as the Falcons pulled back into a defensive shell. As time wound down, Wallström was pulled for an extra attacker and Lundy managed to tie the game with his 14th of the season. Sensing that AIC had used up too much energy to tie the game, Air Force went on the attack in overtime and put up 15 shots in 12 minutes. After a turnover at their own blueline, AIC got on an odd-man rush and Nico Somerville ended the game on a laser that bounced in off of the crossbar.\nThe mild upset set up a meeting with Holy Cross in the semifinals. AIC opened the scoring on the power play but were unable to follow through on their next three opportunities. Instead, the Crusaders scored three times in the second half of the first to take a commanding lead. A second goal from the Yellow Jackets cut the lead to one but they were unable to get the tying marker. A pair of empty-net goals at the end of the match put the game out of reach but did not change the fact that the two were evenly matched throughout. in the second game, with their season on the line, Wallström became the hero, stopping all 32 shots, including 17 in the third, to earn his second shutout of the season. He was nearly able to pull of the same feat in the deciding third game, stopping 44 of 45 attempts and put AIC one win away from the NCAA tournament. Similar t the opening game with Holy Cross, the match with RIT was close for the first two periods. The two exchanged leads in the opening 20 minutes but a power play marker from the Tigers at the start of second went unanswered. As time progressed the Yellow Jackets remained down by a goal and were forced to pull Wallström. Unfortunately, the ploy failed and two empty-net goals followed in quick succession to end AIC's season.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \nRankings.\n&lt;br&gt;"

The Black Knights represented the United States Military Academy, played their home games at the Tate Rink and were coached by Brian Riley in his 20th season.\nSeason.\nArmy could have hardly started their season worse, losing their first nine games and allowing at least 3 goals in every game. The Black Knight's weren't terrible on the offensive side but it was no where near good enough to overcome the poor performance they were seeing in net. Neither Gavin Abrin nor Evan Szary showed any signs of being able to keep the puck out of the net and, as the losses mounted, any hope for the season faded.\nJust before Thanksgiving, Szary provided the first decent game in goal, enabling Army to win its first game of the year. Afterwards, the goaltending remained inconsistent for the rest of the season, alternating between decent outings and subpar performances. By season's end the Black Knights had the 3rd-worst goals against average in the nation, surrendering almost 4 goals per game. The team's offense remained consistently average all season long, capitalizing in the matches where the goaltending was at least respectable. In games where Army allowed 3 goals or fewer, the Black Knights went 10–2–2, on matches where they allowed at least 4 goals, the team went 0–20–0.\nThe defensive troubles resulted in the team finishing 10th in the conference and having to face Niagara in the First Round of the Atlantic Hockey tournament. The Black Knights fired 43 shots on goal, nearly double the total from the Purple Eagles, but they were let down by goaltending once more. Abric allowed 3 goals on just 20 shots while Army was stymied time and again by Niagara's netminder. The 1–4 loss followed the pattern that had been laid out all season long and ended a rather forgettable year for Army.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \nScoring statistics.\nSource: \nRankings.\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "text": "The 2023 Last chance qualification tournament took place in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic from 25 to 27 August. It acted as a qualifying tournament for the 2023 Pan American Games.\nRound robin.\n\"All times are local (UTC−04:00).\"\nControversy.\nThe US team trained for 4 1/2 days. The following two days no training was possible because a tropical storm which caused torrential rains and power outages. No other facilities were provided by the host for training. The roof of the gym leaked and the floor was flooded. Because of this the Taraflex buckled and bulged. On 22 August the USA voiced its concerns and complaints to the organizing committee. On 25 August, the first game day, the host changed at 10:00 the start of the first game from 17:00 to 14:00. Therefore, it was no longer possible for the USA to complete a training session. In the first game the floor was slippery but manageable. In the evening and night the heavy rain fall again. The following day it was again not possible to have a training for the USA. At the warm-up of the second game, the referees voiced their concern about the floor's condition and safety to the host as did the IHF delegate from Mexico.\nAt this point a power outage occurred and USA Team Handball reported that the second match was delayed \"due to weather conditions.\" Afterward the teams were told that they would play the game for three minutes and after this the court would be assessed and further decisions would be made. Soon after the game started it became obvious that it was too dangerous to continue as the players and referees started to slide and fall. Dee Miller, an official from the USA, tried to stop the game but the host and the IHF delegate declined the request. Just 12 minutes into the game, the players and staff decided to stop. Later the game was canceled at a score 12-2 for Uruguay because the USA refused to play on \"due to unplayable and unsafe conditions.\"\nThe third game between the Dominican Republic and Uruguay was played one an other court, on which they had practiced for five days without any problems. One day after the tournament the president of the Dominican Republic Handball Federation praised the performance. The USA has filed a complaint with NACHC and IHF.\nOther complains were that the USA didn't know at the first matchday 25 August which teams play the tournament and what the format would be. According to the Panam Sports should have been played until the 20 August. But of request of the host and with help from the NACHC the tournament was pushed back to better in the schedule of the Dominican Republic. Without any approval by the NACHC the host raised the participation fee from $50 per person to $60. On 11 September 2023 the USA national team wrote an open letter to the NACHC with three requests: All games of the NACHC have to follow the IHF regulations of minimum venue requirements. Procedure how and when to retest game day court safety in extenuating circumstances. A full-cycle calender of all NACHC competitions."

        "text": "The 2023–24 Holy Cross Crusaders men's ice hockey season was the 58th season of play for the program, the 26th at the Division I level and the 21st in Atlantic Hockey. The Crusaders represented the College of the Holy Cross, played their home games at the Hart Center and were coached by Bill Riga in his 3rd season.\nSeason.\nWith most of its team returning, Holy Cross was well-positioned for a good season. Even so, it was a surprise when the Crusaders started the season with a sweep of a ranked Connecticut squad and were ranked #1 in the PairWise, albeit very briefly. Unfortunately for the Crusaders, nominal starter Jason Grande had a few week outing at the end of October. When Thomas Gale was inserted into the goal, the situation didn't immediately resolve itself and the team stumbled to a sub-.500 record by mid-November. With their season spinning out of control, a pair of shutouts by Gale over Bentley just before Thanksgiving halted their descent.\nAs the goaltending resolved itself, the offense was still in the process of rounding into form. The forward unit hadn't been bad in the first two months of the season but they had failed to take advantage of their chances. By early December, Holy Cross had lost five 1-goal games and were wallowing at the bottom of the Atlantic Hockey standings. A less than satisfactory slate of non-conference games around Christmas wiped away their early gains and did not portend well for the second half of the year.\nWhen they returned to their conference schedule, the team had a good weekend against American International but then followed that up with probably their worse game of the season. Against bottom-dwelling Army, Holy Cross was shutout for the first time on the year and took numerous penalties. The game ended with Mack Oliphant receiving a match penalty for grabbing a face mask. emotions seemed to boil over in the rematch when leading scorer Liam McLinskey was ejected for abuse of the officials, though he managed to avoid a suspension. The following week, the team struggled through another 1-goal loss where they were assessed a major penalty.\nThe second game with Sacred Heart earned the team a weekend split but, most importantly, began a resurgence for the offense. From January 20 through February 16, Holy Cross scored at least 5 goals in each game. The suddenly high-powered offense was spearheaded by McLinskey who averaged 2 points per game in that stretch and shot up the program's all-time scoring list. The seven game winning streak propelled the team towards the top of the conference standings, enabling the Crusaders to finish second behind RIT. It also saw a return to form of Jason Grande, who regained the starting role at the beginning of February and never relinquished the crease.\nWhen the conference tournament began, Holy Cross was given a bye into the quarterfinal round and were allowed to rest for a week before continuing. The team looked prepared for Canisius in the first game, outshooting the Griffins nearly 2-to-1. Unfortunately, they still found themselves down 2–3 entering the third period. After McLinskey tied the game, Jack Stockfish scored the winning goal on the power play and gave the Crusaders a bit of breathing room. The second match saw Canisius fight back and outshoot CHC in regulation. Penalties were largely responsible with two minors in the third giving the Griffins a chance to take the rematch. Fortunately, Grande had recovered from his subpar performance in game one and he surrendered just 1 goal on 35 shots to force overtime. The Crusaders took over the game in extra time, widely outshooting Canisius 14–3 in the first session. While they weren't able to score in that 20-minute stretch, the pressure they put on Canisius eventually led to defensive breakdown at the beginning of the fifth period.\nIn the semifinals, Holy Cross found itself opposite American International. A solid first period staked CHC to a lead that they would not relinquish, however, it was also the last time their offense would function properly. Over the succeeding two games, Holy Cross managed just a single goal on 77 shots. The Crusaders went 0 for 6 on the power play and were unable to solve the Yellow Jackets' goaltender. Their season was brought to an shocking finish with the failure of their previously stable offense.\nIn spite of the end, Liam McLinskey still managed to tie for the second best scoring performance in program history. While he scored 2 goals fewer than the year before, he had septupled his assist total to finish just outside the top-10 in the entire NCAA. This was also the first 20-win season for the program in over a decade and their best record since 2006.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \nRankings.\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "title": "Frank Halloran (rugby league)",
        "text": "Frank Halloran was a rugby league footballer who played in Auckland, New Zealand. He represented Auckland and made the New Zealand team in 1937, playing two tests against Australia at halfback. When doing so he became the 250th player to represent New Zealand. Halloran played for the Ponsonby United (Ponies) club in the Auckland Rugby League competition from 1934 to 1938. Prior to this he had played for the Northcote &amp; Birkenhead Ramblers club as a junior. He later fought in World War 2.\nEarly life.\nFrank Halloran was born on November 11, 1912, to Richard Francis Halloran (1876-1956), and Lilian Knox (1889-1961). He was one of 15 children with his other siblings being Evelyn Frances Halloran (1907-?), Josephine Halloran (1909-1913), Myrtle Lilian Halloran (1910-1976), Barbara Kate Halloran (1914-?), Esma Mary Halloran (1916-2003), John Haslett Halloran (1918-2001), Thomas Walter Halloran (1921-2007), Phillip Halloran (1923-2002), Joan Augusta Halloran (1925-2001), William Mervyn Halloran (1926-2001), Robert Halloran (1927-1991), Patricia Moria Halloran (1930-2015), Colleen Halloran (1934-1934), and Maureen Halloran (1935-2016).\nThe first mention of Frank in the local newspapers was in the Auckland Star and New Zealand Herald on January 11, 1926, when he nearly drowned at Brown's Island in Auckland's Hauraki Gulf. He was aged 13 at the time and was there as part of the Colonial Sugar Refinery Company's annual picnic for employees. He \"fell into the water, and was in serious difficulties when Mr. Charles Neads, jumped in fully clothed as he was and brought the boy to safety\".\nPlaying career.\nNorthcote &amp; Birkenhead Ramblers.\nHalloran began his rugby league playing career at the Northcote &amp; Birkenhead Ramblers club which was based in the Northcote, and Birkenhead suburbs of Auckland's North Shore. His name appeared for the first time in association with the game on May 25 in 1928, in the Sixth Grade A competition. Northcote finished at the bottom of the competition. The following year in 1929 Halloran was still playing in the same side. The team fared better, winning around half of their matches to finish in the top half of the competition. In 1930 Halloran had moved up to Northcote's 5th grade side which finished mid table once more. In 1931 Halloran had progressed into the 4th grade side which performed well winning most of its games and finishing near the top of a 15 team competition.\nThe 1933 season was where Halloran began to make a name for himself. He was now aged 20 and became the captain of the Northcote 3rd grade intermediate team. They won the championship with an undefeated season scoring a remarkable 346 points and only conceded 6 which all came from penalty kicks. The team was pictured in the Auckland Star. In mid July Halloran applied for financial assistance on behalf of the club for their trip to Taranaki on August 5. The side intended to play against the Taranaki junior side as a curtain-raiser to the Auckland match with Taranaki. The Auckland Rugby League decided to assist the team.\nTransfer to Ponsonby United.\nAt the start of the 1934 season Frank Halloran was granted a transfer to the Ponsonby United club. At the time Northcote's highest graded side was their 3rd grade intermediate team while Ponsonby had a long established senior side in the 1st grade Fox Memorial competition. Halloran moved there along with his teammates from Northcote, brothers John and Walter (Wally) Stockley with all three moving straight into the 1st grade side. Walter would go on to represent Auckland 5 times. John was killed in action on December 24, 1943, during World War 2 while in Italy aged 31.\nThe first match Halloran played for Ponsonby was in a pre-season game against Marist Old Boys on April 21 at Carlaw Park. His first official match came in round 1 of the Fox Memorial first grade championship on April 28 at Carlaw Park. Ponsonby won 28–8 with Halloran playing well. The Herald wrote:\"Halloran, a junior player from Northcote, was the best back on the ground, usually a centre, Halloran played a fine game behind the scrum. His passes were well directed, and he varied his methods to combine with the forwards\". The Auckland Star said that he \"made a very promising debut at half-back, and when he opened up the play, [Brian] Riley and [Walter] Stockley with clever, incisive running gave the Ponsonby three-quarter line plenty of opportunities\". In comments later in the week the Herald wrote that he \"played a fine game behind the Ponsonby pack. He was responsible for at least three of the tries scored. Halloran, who played for Northcote juniors last year at fullback, is a natural scrum half. His passes were well directed and he frequently joined the three-quarters in passing bouts\". Then the following week in a 17–2 win over Devonport United the Herald said \"great credit for Ponsonby's success must be given to Halloran, halfback, and W. Stockley, first five eighths. Both are players well above the average, Halloran changing his play cleverly and getting the ball away very smartly\". In another article it was predicted that his play \"stamps him as a coming representative player\". The following week Ponsonby lost to Richmond 16-4 and Halloran had \"more limited opportunities than usual [but] was still a notable half-back- a quick thinker, resourceful and varied in his methods\". The matches were played before a crowd of 17,000 to mark the opening of the new grandstand at Carlaw Park. He \"played another fine game... although he had a tendency to overdo the blind side play\". In a narrow 8–5 win over Newton Rangers credit for their win went to their \"better understanding between Halloran, at halfback, and the five eighths, their combination being good\".\nHis first try came in an 18–4 win over City on May 26 in round 5. Though it was noted that both he and Walter Stockley \"were not as prominent as usual\". In a convincing 16–7 win against Marist he was \"always resourceful at halfback\" and \"played a fine game behind the pack in the second half. On every occasion he fed the backs to good advantage\". On June 11 he \"overshadowed G. Rhodes, the Devonport halfback by his enterprise\", but Ponsonby still lost 10–0. A week later they lost again, this time to Richmond 26–10 with Halloran moved to fullback for the first time. The Herald said that he \"played a poor game, hesitating far too much and being frequently caught in possession. His kicking was weak and often lacked height and direction\". They noted that his replacement at halfback, Owen Wilkie didn't play as well there as Halloran does. The Herald wrote later in the week that Ponsonby's backline formation change was a \"mistake\". In an 12–11 loss to Newton Rangers he again played fullback and \"played in a far more settled fashion... but can do much better\". In his third consecutive match at fullback, in a 22–10 loss to City Rovers he \"played a sound game... his fielding being very certain\". The next week he was moved back to halfback in Ponsonby's 11–7 win over Marist Old Boys at the Onehunga Recreation Ground (Waikaraka Park). Halloran and Brian Riley \"did the inside work very capably\". In round 12 Ponsonby won 6–5 over Devonport with \"Halloran, at halfback, the outstanding player. His clever work on attack frequently placed the backs in good positions, and each time his passes were well directed\". The Herald went on to say that \"the splendid all-round play of Halloran, behind the Ponsonby scrum, was a feature of the game. His passes were well directed, and he ran straight, giving the inside backs room to work. Halloran was given a lot of support from [Lou] Hutt...\". In the last round of the championship Ponsonby lost to the champions Richmond Rovers 18–0. In regard to Halloran's head to head match with Roy Powell, a future New Zealand halfback, it was said that he \"was more than his equal\". He \"shaped magnificently\" with Riley, Stockley, and Kay in the early stages. The Herald said that he was \"unlucky to be passed over by the selectors for the representative match next Saturday\". The match being referred to was the August 11 game between Auckland and Northland. The herald said that Vincent Axman was a surprise inclusion at halfback and that \"Halloran, the young Ponsonby half, has shown better all-round form during the season and can be accounted unlucky to miss selection\". He was included in the match day squad amongst the reserves but was not required to play on the day.\nHis next match was Ponsonby's 19–11 win over Mount Albert in round 1 of the Roope Rooster knockout competition on August 18. Halloran and Brian Riley \"formed a dangerous combination in attack\". He missed their remaining knockout games though no reason was reported in any of the newspapers.\nHe did however play in the Ponsonby XIII side's match against the touring Western Suburbs side from Sydney which had won the New South Wales competition. Western Suburbs won 26 to 13 in the October 3 match. The Auckland Star said that \"Halloran, behind the scrum, was patchy, but improved as the game progressed\". He had played opposite Percy Williams who played for New South Wales, and later represented Australia. Early in the match Halloran was penalised and Williams kicked the goal from the infringement. His last match of the season came in a game for the Auckland Colts representative side which was playing Auckland Māori (Tāmaki) on October 20 at Carlaw Park. The Colts side won 29–12 with Halloran scoring a try \"at the end of a loose rush\".\nThe 1935 season saw Halloran play 16 matches for Ponsonby, scoring 3 tries. He also played in an Auckland trial match. He was listed at halfback for Ponsonby's season opener against Marist on May 4. In Ponsonby's round 3 thrashing of City by 39 to 13, Halloran was accused of being \"inclined to run too much with the ball\" from halfback. The next week in a loss to Richmond he \"played a good game at halfback, starting his backs smartly and doing great work on defence\". In a summation of the players in form in the Auckland competition the Herald said that there was \"plenty of talent offering for the position of halfback for the representative team. Halloran, Ponsonby, and Wilfred Brimble, Newton, are both playing well\". Ponsonby lost to Mount Albert in round 6 with the Auckland Star reporting that \"despite the good work of Halloran and Riley as off-half, erratic handling and defects in positional play lost advantages\". While the Herald said he \"played a good game behind the scrum\". Then in an 8–3 win over Marist in round 8 on June 22 he \"varied his play as half ..., and his vis-à-vis Kerr, revealed quite good form\".\nHalloran was occasionally being listed at fullback and he played there in their 14–13 loss to Newton at the Glen Eden Recreation Ground in Glen Eden. He \"played a safe game\" in the position. He didn't play in their match against Devonport United in round 13, before moving back to halfback for their 17–11 loss to Mount Albert United the following week. He \"did a lot of useful work behind the scrum...\".\nHalloran was named as a reserve in an Auckland trial match to help the selectors choose the Auckland side to face the touring Australian side. However following the next round of club matches he was named to start in the Auckland A trial team to play the Auckland B trial side. The selectors were Ernie Asher, Bert Avery, and William Mincham. The match was played as curtain raiser to the North Island – South Island inter-island match. He was chosen at halfback with Eric Fletcher and Ted Brimble outside him at first five eighth and second five eighths. He was also playing opposite Ted Brimble's younger brother, Wilfred at halfback for the B team. The A team won 22–19 with Halloran replaced at halftime by A.S. O'Connor of Wellington in a pre-arranged move so that the New Zealand selectors could see him play.\nAfter not having scored a try all season Halloran then went on a try scoring run, scoring his first in Ponsonby's Roope Rooster round 1 defeat to City (28-16) on August 24. The newspapers contradicted one another with the Auckland Star saying Halloran \"was in fine fettle behind the Ponsonby pack\" but the New Zealand Herald said he \"was a weak link\" behind the scrum. He scored his next try in Ponsonby's 20–10 win over City in the Phelan Shield semi finals on September 7. His third try came in their last match of the season a week later which was the Phelan Shield final win over Mount Albert by 11 points to 8.\nAuckland Representative (1936 season).\nThe 1936 season saw Halloran play 19 games for Ponsonby, scoring 5 tries, while he also went on to make his one and only appearance for the Auckland representative side against Wellington. He also appeared in the New Zealand trial match on July 11. The Ponsonby team was to be coached by the recently retired All Black legend and New Zealand rugby league representative, Bert Cooke.\nPonsonby's first game of the season was against City on April 18 at Carlaw Park in a preseason match, with Halloran scoring a try. The Auckland Star said that Ponsonby's \"success was largely due to the efforts of Halloran and Kay, the former being responsible for at least three of his side's five tries\", and they were their \"best backs\". In a round 1 loss to Richmond by 21 points to 10, Halloran scored a try, and at halfback he \"played a good game, his all-round form being reminiscent of that which made him outstanding three seasons ago\". He scored again when Ponsonby beat City 21–10 on the Carlaw Park #2 field the following week. He along with Walter Stockley, and Brian Riley combined very well \"with machine gun like play and perfect understanding\". He scored for the fourth consecutive match when Ponsonby beat Manukau 24–18 and was said to have done \"useful work on defence\" along with Stockley.\nIn another win, this time over Mount Albert (22-20), the Herald wrote that Ponsonby's backs \"were dangerous and were not afraid to make play for themselves. A great deal of credit in this respect must go to Halloran, the Ponsonby halfback, and Riley, who was in brilliant form at second five eighths\". They went on to comment that \"at half, [he] is a much improved player and he did invaluable work both on attack and defence\". During the week they stated that Halloran was \"showing splendid form this season and must have claims for representative honours\". He \"attacked with sharpness\" the following week in a 16–11 loss to Marist. His good form continued against Newton where they won 22–10. The entire back line played well together with Halloran playing \"a splendid game behind the scrum and sent out clean passes\". He was involved in a try to Payne from halfway where he handled multiple times. The Herald noted what a \"fine display\" he had given and how he \"worked the open side cleverly when possible\". Halloran gave \"another fine exhibition\" at halfback in a 17–15 win over Devonport on June 13. In the first match of the second round against Richmond, Ponsonby lost 15-6 though Halloran was Ponsonby's \"best back and he again played a good all-round game\". He made an opening for Walter Stockley to score Ponsonby's first try.\nHalloran was then selected to make his Auckland debut against Wellington. It was not a full strength Auckland side as the match was a curtain raiser to the Auckland Pākehā match against Auckland Māori (Tāmaki) with both sides featuring a huge number of New Zealand and Auckland representatives. Halloran was chosen by selector Bert Avery at halfback to play alongside his Ponsonby teammate Walter Stockley who captained the side. He played opposite Wellington halfback, J. Coman who was a former Wellington rugby union representative player. Auckland won the early match 25–22 with the Herald publishing a photograph of Halloran shaping to kick after gaining possession from a scrum inside their own half. With the scores tied 3-3 Halloran was involved in a passing movement after Ross Jones gathered the ball and gave it to J. Peterson who passed to Halloran, who gave it on to Stockley who scored. \nHalloran then returned to his Ponsonby side to play two matches against City and Manukau before being named in a New Zealand trial match. In the game against Manukau he \"played solidly behind the pack\". He was named in the reserves for both teams by Bert Avery for the trial match, which was to give himself and fellow New Zealand selectors Jim Amos and Thomas McClymont a chance to see the talent. The game was the curtain raiser to the North Island v South Island inter-island match at Carlaw Park on July 11. At halftime Halloran came on to replace Roy Powell at halfback in the New Zealand A team. He converted a try scored by Angus Gault towards the end of the game with his team losing 16–13.\nIn Ponsonby's round 11 loss to Mount Albert (10-4) on July 18 \"Halloran worked hard throughout behind the pack\". The next week in a 9–8 win over Marist he was \"outstanding\". The Auckland Star writing that Ponsonby dominated the first half \"with Halloran shining, getting the ball away quick and snappy\". He made an opening for Arthur Kay early in the match before two other players handled to score.\nHalloran was selected to train as a reserve for the New Zealand team which was preparing for the first test against England on August 8. The other reserves named were Angus Gault, Harold Tetley, and Ted Mincham. There were no substitutions permitted during the test match but \"in view of the very solid training operations, reserves are required to be on hand so that replacement caused by accident or indisposition to any of the first string may be filled by fully-trained reserves familiar with the team's tactics\". He was ultimately not required to play with Roy Powell retaining his place in the starting side.\nHalloran then returned to the Ponsonby team to finish the season playing six further matches. He scored a try in a 19-15 Phelan Shield semi final win over Devonport on September 26. He was playing at first five eighth with D. Black at halfback. His final match of the year was in the Phelan Shield final win over Marist 13–9 on October 3 with him being listed once again at first five eighth.\nNew Zealand selection (1937).\nThe 1937 season was to see Halloran fulfil his promise and make his New Zealand debut. He played 20 games for Ponsonby, scoring 2 tries along with a New Zealand trial match before playing in both tests against Australia.\nHalloran was mentioned in early January as having placed second in a dinghy race at the annual regatta at Maraetai, behind \"L. Riley\" which was possibly Leonard Riley who had played rugby league for Auckland and Ponsonby from 1922 to 1933 and was the older brother of teammate Brian Riley. He began his season for Ponsonby playing in both of their preliminary round matches against Mount Albert United on April 17, and Richmond Rovers on April 24. In the first match Halloran was the \"shining light\" along with Walter Stockley in the backs. And he was \"the best of the five eighths\". Against Richmond he \"did useful work in defence\" along with Arthur Kay. In their season opening match with City, Halloran \"played a sound game\", and \"made several clever openings\" playing at first five eighth with D. Black at halfback.\nAfter a 27–0 win over Newton on May 8, Halloran was selected by Hec Brisbane as a back reserve for the Auckland Pākehā team to play Auckland Māori on May 12 but he was ultimately not required to play. In Ponsonby's next match, a 7–3 win over Manukau the Herald wrote that he and Stockley were \"too flat footed\" with Halloran \"often taking his passes from the halfback standing\". In an 8–8 draw with North Shore he scored a try and \"although... [he] mishandled on occasions, he was a tower of strength on defence\". In a 15–6 loss to Richmond he and Black \"got through a wealth of good work, although [Halloran] had a bad lapse when he let Noel Bickerton beat him badly and go on to score a magnificent try\" which came after he dummied and left Halloran standing.\nOn June 19 six of the Auckland sides travelled to various parts of the North Island to play local sides in an effort to promote the rugby league game. Ponsonby went to Wellington, and played the St George (Wellington) club side at Newtown Park. The match was drawn 20–20 with Halloran playing first five eighth once more. He initiated a try to Selwyn Davis when they trailed 15-0 which partially sparked their comeback to later draw the match. In a 27–8 win over City he and Stockley \"played sound football without doing anything unorthodox\". Then in an upset 10–9 win over eventual champions, Richmond, Halloran \"was outstanding for the winners, sending the ball away splendidly and defending soundly\". The Herald said that he was Ponsonby's \"best back\" and he was \"very nippy on attack and a tower of strength on defence\". Later in the week the same newspaper wrote that \"his tackling and covering on defence saved his side repeatedly, while he showed cleverness on attack and was responsible for Ponsonby's second try\". A week later in round 11 though Ponsonby lost 18–6 to Manukau with Halloran and Stockley \"hampered by the fast raiding\" Manukau forwards which included Puti Tipene (Steve) Watene, Len Kawe, Frank Pickrang, and Angus Gault.\nHe was then named in the New Zealand trial match on July 28 where he was chosen in the Possibles team at halfback despite having played the entire season to this point at first five eighth. Outside him at first five eighth was Noel Bickerton, while he was playing opposite Peter Mahima from the Manukau club. His Possibles side won 25 to 11 in intermittent rain on a \"quagmire\" at Carlaw Park. The Auckland Star wrote \"Mahima and Halloran provided a sharp contrast in half-back play, the former rugged and solid, the latter showing refreshing enterprise in attack\". While the Herald suggested that \"behind the scrum, Halloran was a better player on the day than Mahima. The former has played at five eighths all the season, but yesterday he did a lot of clever work behind the scrum. However Mahima has proved the outstanding halfback in club football and may yet be the test player\". Halloran then returned to the Ponsonby side 3 days later on July 31. They lost 20–0 to Mount Albert and their backs \"gave a disappointing display, Riley and Halloran being the best\".\nNew Zealand test selection.\n Halloran was then chosen in the New Zealand test squad to play Australia. The squad was made up of 15 players, with 8 backs, but as Halloran was the only halfback named his place was virtually assured. The Star wrote \"Halloran has been playing well this season, and his game behind the pack will be watched with interest\". The Herald said that \"little fault can be found with\" his selection. After the side was named they were to report to the Auckland Gymnasium on the same evening (August 2). He was then chosen at halfback for the match day side with Noel Bickerton outside him at first five eighth. He would be opposed by Percy Williams, the Australian halfback.\n The first test was played at Carlaw Park on August 7 before a crowd of 20,000 and saw Australia win a close match 12–8. Halloran was involved in the opening try of the match to New Zealand after a passing bout involving Rangi Chase and Wally Tittleton initially before \"finally Halloran received and when well held he in-passed crisply to Bickerton and the nippy five-eighths dived over for a good try\". At one stage he \"raced through the defence, and he had Tittleton, Chase, and Davison in good positions. However, the ball travelled too slowly, and the Australians' cover defence checked a dangerous movement\". The Herald noted that \"early in the game Halloran received a nasty knock, and the best was not seen of his play at halfback\".\nWhen the second test squad was named on August 10 he was not included in it and instead Peter Mahima was named at halfback. This was probably connected to an injury received during the game. When the test thirteen was finalised 2 days later on August 12 he was selected at halfback. The Herald wrote that \"Mahima must be considered unlucky not to get the halfback position, as he played a brilliant game yesterday and has stronger claims for selection than Halloran\". The match referred to was the 16–5 win by New Zealand Māori over Australia. The second test saw Halloran again playing inside Noel Bickerton and opposite Percy Williams. New Zealand caused an upset by winning the match 16-15 though they were helped by Australia suffering several serious injuries and playing much of the second half two men short. Halloran was again involved in a New Zealand try when early in the match he gathered the ball in an attacking position and \"cut in\" before he \"whipped the ball out to Tittleton, to Davison, who scored at the corner\". In a summary of the match it was said that he \"tackled well and sent out good passes, but the transfers of all the backs lacked the snap and precision which characterised the work of the Australians\". Most of the praise in the New Zealand side was reserved for fullback George Nēpia's play. The Herald also wrote that \"Halloran, behind the scrum, did his work in an effective manner\".\nReturn to club football.\nFollowing the second and final test Halloran returned to his Ponsonby side to conclude the season. On August 21 they beat North Shore 23–9 in round 13 of the championship. He scored one of their five tries and also \"did good work on defence\". They lost their final round match to finish 5th in the Fox Memorial championship though were only 6 points off first in a competitive season. They then defeated North Shore in the first round of the Roope Rooster knockout competition before a win over Mount Albert in the semi final. He \"combined well\" with Stockley and they both \"proved sound in defence\". They played Marist in the final on September 18 but were defeated 25–10. Ponsonby put in one of their \"poorest performances of the year\" with the inside backs \"standing flat-footed and passing the ball shoulder high\". Halloran and Stockely said to have been \"much below form. The five eighths had numerous chances in the second half, but there was no penetration and the pair passed wildly\".\nTransfer back to Northcote.\nThe 1938 season was to be Halloran's last playing first grade rugby league and last at Ponsonby]]. He played 8 matches for them before transferring back to his Northcote club. On April 30 he received a trophy donated by Mr. A. Barnett for the best sportsman in the Ponsonby club. It was reported in early April that he would be available to play once more. His first match of the year was in their preliminary game against Manukau on April 2. Halloran was back playing in the fullback position where he had spent time off and on in previous seasons. It was said that he was \"sound\" in the position. In their round 2 loss to Richmond (18-13) he started at fullback but moved to halfback in the second half when Black went off injured with a broken knee-cap. He was involved in their try on full-time when he was \"associated\" with Cootes and Edgar Morgan in a \"nice movement\" before the later scored. After he moved to halfback he was said to have done \"some clever work on attack\". The Auckland Star noted that he had been \"more effective at halfback than fullback\". In a 24–16 loss to City on April 23 Halloran also went off injured during the game. Ponsonby had four injured players with Black still in hospital, Arthur Kay out injured and both Halloran and P. Young injured in the City match. He appears to have missed their next match with Papakura on April 30 before returning for their 10–9 win over Newton. Halloran played at his more familiar position of halfback however he \"was caught in possession of the ball too often, and selfishness on his part also spoiled many promising attacks\". They then beat North Shore 16–7 at the Devonport Domain in round 7 with Halloran showing speed in some back work which saw Brian Riley scoring. The Herald said that he \"played his best game this season, and got through a lot of useful work, particularly in the second half\". Against Marist a week later Halloran achieved the rare feat of a conversion and a penalty as he had almost never taken goal kicks, though Ponsonby lost 13–7 in the main match at Carlaw Park. It was said that he was not as \"prominent as usual\". It was to be the last game he played for the Ponsonby senior side. The following week following an upset win over Manukau the Herald wrote that the \"loss of Stockley and Halloran was compensated by the good play of Carr... and Rush\" two promoted juniors. He was not mentioned in connection to any of their following 4 matches and then on July 19 it was reported that he and John Stockley (brother of Walter) had transferred to Northcote where they would join their senior B side. The Northcote side was playing in the Stallard Cup with 8 games remaining in their season though it is unknown if he played for them in any of those games. It is unclear if he retired however he enlisted in the World War 2 effort a few years later. Following the war it was stated in the book \"Those Who Played\" by Bruce Montgomery that he returned to the Ponsonby side and played for their reserve grade team.\nWorld War 2.\nHalloran enlisted in the World War 2 effort in 1943. His war records show that he was living at 7 Tizard Road in Birkenhead, Auckland at the time with his next of kin, \"Mrs. S.M. Halloran\". His occupation was listed as a \"warehouseman/civilian\". While serving Halloran was a private in the infantry brigade in the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force and was stationed in the Pacific Islands. Following his return he was awarded the War Medal 1939-1945 and the New Zealand War Service Medal.\nPersonal life.\nFrank Halloran was Roman Catholic. He married Sabina Madge (Sybil) Hartigan (1916-1998) on October 14, 1939. They had two children, one of whom was a son named Anthony (Tony) who played rugby for St Peters in Auckland. According to electoral records in 1946 he and Sabina were living at 13 Vincent Street in Auckland city. By 1963 they were now living on Manapau Street in Remuera with his occupation listed as a warehouseman, while their son Tony was working as a pharmacist.\nHalloran died on August 2, 1980, aged 67."

        "text": "The 2023–24 Miami Hurricanes men's basketball team represented the University of Miami during the 2023–24 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The Hurricanes were led by thirteenth-year head coach Jim Larrañaga, and played their home games at the Watsco Center on the university's campus in Coral Gables, Florida as members of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC).\nThe Hurricanes got to a hot start, going 11–2 in their first 13 games. Highlights of the streak included wins over Georgia and Kansas State at the Baha Mar Bahamas Hoops Championship and two conference wins over Notre Dame and sixteenth-ranked Clemson. They were ranked as highly as eighth when they lost to Kentucky in the ACC–SEC Challenge. Their fortunes turned as they lost four of their next five ACC games, with the lone win coming against Virginia Tech.

        "text": "South Dakota has a curious history with ice hockey. Despite the state having relatively little history with the sport, South Dakota's proximity to other very engaged states has resulted in a high level of engagement by its residents.\nHistory.\nFor much of its history, South Dakota has had a low population with the entire state having yet to amount to 1 million (approximately 910,000 in 2022). Despite cold winters, which would provide a natural playing surface, ice hockey did not take off in the state for many years.\nIt wasn't until 1999 that the state received its first franchise when USHL expanded to Sioux Falls. The Sioux Falls Stampede played at the highest level of junior hockey in the US and was routinely stocked with future NHL talent. The team struggled through a few lean years early on but built itself into a force by the mid 00s. Shortly after the Stampede won it first Clark Cup in 2007, the state received its second team when the Rapid City Rush were founded in 2008. The team found success straight away and won the league championship in just its second season. The team was able to quickly establish itself partly by being the only professional game in town and that fact was key in keeping the team alive.\nIn 2014, the CHL folded, leaving 10 teams scrambling to find a new home. The Rush were one of seven who were accepted into the ECHL for the next season. While their new league made the Rush a more attractive team (now playing AA hockey), the tradeoff was that the team's expenses were also increasing. To help offset those costs, the team was able to sign an affiliate deal and become part of the Phoenix Coyotes system in 2015. The team struggled on the ice afterwards, missing the playoffs for five consecutive seasons, however, that wasn't the worst calamity to befall the Rush. In 2019, the team's business manager was investigate by federal authorities for embezzlement. He later pled guilty to stealing $700,000 between 2010 and 2018 and was ordered to pay $1 million in restitution.\nJunior hockey expanded in the state when the Aberdeen Wings were founded in 2010. The team began play as a member of the NAHL, a second-tier junior league. Just like the Stampede, it took a few years for the Wings to build itself into a contender but the team won its first league title in 2019, the same year Sioux Falls earned their third championship.\nIn 2021 Augustana University announced that, following a successful fundraising campaign spearheaded by T. Denny Sanford, the school would sponsor varsity ice hockey beginning with the 2023–24 season. In order to help the team receive greater exposure, the school signed a deal with Midco, a regional cable broadcaster headquartered in Sioux Falls, to not only become namesake for their new facility (Midco Arena) but to also be the television provider for the team.\nTeams.\nTimeline.\n \nPlayers.\nIn spite of the state not having an established ice hockey team for decades, South Dakota has a very high level of engagement with the sport. While less 3,000 residents were registered with USA Hockey in 2023, the population percentage of 0.339% placed South Dakota at 13th in the nation, ahead of 'traditional' hockey states like New York and Pennsylvania. While several collegiate players have hailed from South Dakota over the years, no player from South Dakota has yet to achieve a significant level of notoriety."

        "text": " \nThe 2009 US Open Men's Singles final was the championship tennis match of the Men's Singles tournament at the 2009 US Open. In the final, Juan Martín del Potro defeated 5-time defending champion Roger Federer 3–6, 7–6(7–5), 4–6, 7–6(7–4), 6–2 after 4 hours and 6 minutes to win the match. It was the first US Open singles final that went to 5 sets since 1999, a span of 10 events. The 2009 US Open final was Del Potro's first win over Federer, having lost his 6 previous encounters against the Swiss.\nBy winning the 2009 US Open, Del Potro became the first Argentinian man since Gastón Gaudio in 2004 to win a Grand Slam singles title, the first Argentinian man since Guillermo Vilas in 1977 to win a US Open singles title and the first Argentinian man to win a hard court Grand Slam singles title (Vilas won his US Open title on green clay).\nBackground.\nFederer came to the 2009 US Open final having won the previous 2 Slams in 2009 – the French Open and Wimbledon. He also won the previous 5 US Open singles championships and was attempting to win a stand-alone record 6th consecutive US Open title, as well as trying to become the first male player in the Open Era to win any of the 4 Grand Slams 6 times in a row. Federer was also attempting to win his first Surface Slam. Federer was the no. 1 seed and the overwhelming favorite to win the title. \nDel Potro reached his first Grand Slam final at the 2009 US Open. He was seeking for his first Grand Slam title and his first win over Federer. While he lost his previous 6 encounters against Federer, he forced Federer to come back from 2 sets to 1 down in their latest encounter at the 2009 French Open, having not taken a set from Federer prior to the 2009 French Open. Given the high level both Federer and Del Potro showed in their semifinal matches against Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal respectively, the 2009 US Open final was expected to be a close match as well.\nMatch.\nDel Potro won the pre-match coin toss and chose to receive, Federer elected to stay. In the first set, Federer held his first service game easily. In Del Potro's first service game, Federer generated 5 break points while Del Potro couldn't reach game point. Federer finally converted his 5th break point with a 12-shot rally that ended with a running cross-court forehand passing shot winner from Federer to take a 2–0 lead. Federer easily consolidated his break lead with an unreturned serve. Del Potro responded with an unreturned serve of his own to win his the 4th game. In the sixth game, Del Potro saved a break point to reduce the gap to 4–2. In the eighth game, a forehand error from Del Potro got him to 2–5, 0–40 and 3 set points down on his serve. Del Potro hit an ace and 2 winners to save the 3 sets points and held serve, but in the next game Federer successfully converted his first set point on his serve with an ace and won the first set 6–3.\nIn the second set, Federer broke Del Potro right at the start of the set, in a game Del Potro double-faulted twice. In the fourth game, Del Potro created his first break point opportunities of the match after a forehand error from Federer; Federer eventually saved 3 break points to hold for 3–1 while Del Potro saved 2 break points in the following game to hold serve. Both players held their serves in the next 4 games without facing break points. In the tenth game, Federer served for the second set at 5–4 and an unreturned kick serve gave him a 30–0 lead in the game; at 30-all in the tenth game, Del Potro hit 2 down-the-line forehand passing shot winners to break Federer's serve for the first time in the match and level the 2nd set to 5–5. Del Potro closed the next game with an unreturned flat serve to get up to 6–5 and be up in a set for the first time in the match. Federer closed the twelfth game of the set with a forehand error from Del Potro and took the second set to a tiebreaker. Both players won their points on serve in the first 6 points of the tiebreaker. On the seventh point, however, Federer mishit his plus-1 shot on his forehand and gave Del Potro the 4–3 mini-break. Both players won the following points on serve in the tiebreaker as Del Potro won the second set tiebreaker 7–5, closing with a plus-1 inside-out forehand winner.\nIn the third set, both players won their first service game at love. The first break of serve in this set came in the seventh game, when at 30-all, Federer hit to forehand errors to give Del Potro a 4–3 lead. In the eighth game Federer broke back, converting his 3rd consecutive break point with a backhand forced error from Del Potro. Federer faced a break point in the ninth game and responded with 3 unreturned serves to hold for a 5–4 lead. At 30-all in the tenth game, Del Potro hit 2 consecutive double-faults to give Federer the 3rd set 6–4.\nIn the fourth set, both players won their first 2 service games – Federer faced neither a break point nor deuce while Del Potro saved 3 break points in his first 2 service games. In the fifth game, Del Potro broke Federer at love with an inside-out forehand error from Federer. Del Potro consolidated his break for the first time in the match in the sixth game. In the eighth game, Del Potro sent a forehand to the net to give the break back to Federer and level the set to 4–4. In the tenth game, when Del Potro was 4–5 and 15–30 down, 2 points away from losing the match, Del Potro hit an unreturned serve, an ace and a down-the line forehand winner to hold for 5–5. In the eleventh game Federer was 40–0 up but eventually needed to save 2 break points and held serve for 6–5. Del Potro won the twelfth game at love and took the fourth set to a tiebreaker. Federer double-faulted on the first point of the tiebreaker to give Del Potro the mini-break; from this point on in the tiebreaker both players won their service points, like in the second set tiebreaker. Del Potro won the tiebreaker 7–4 and the fourth set, following a forehand error from Federer. This was the first time Federer was taken to a fifth set in a US Open final.\nDel Potro opened the fifth and deciding set with a comfortable hold. A plus-1 inside-in forehand error from Federer gave Del Potro 2 break points in the second game of the set. Del Potro converted the second break point with a running cross-court forehand passing shot winner to take a 2–0 lead. Del Potro saved a break point in the third game of the set to consolidate the break and take a 3–0 lead. Del Potro didn't face another break point for the rest of the match. A plus-1 inside-in forehand winner in the seventh game gave Del Potro a 5–2 lead. In the eighth game, when Federer served to stay in the match, a mishit cross-court backhand error from him gave Del Potro 2 match points. Federer forced 2 errors from Del Potro to save these 2 match points and an unreturned serve game Federer a game point. Del Potro hit a down-the-line forehand winner to take the game to a second deuce. Federer double-faulted to give Del Potro a third match point and this time, Del Potro converted it: a down-the-line forehand from Del Potro forced a backhand error from Federer that went long. Del Potro ended Federer's US Open streak and claimed his first (and only) Grand Slam title.\nStatistics.\nSource"

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball career double plays as a center fielder leaders",
        "text": "In baseball statistics, a double play (denoted as DP) is the act of making two outs during the same continuous play. One double play is recorded for every defensive player who participates in the play, regardless of how many of the outs in which they were directly involved, and is counted in addition to whatever putouts and assists might also apply. Double plays can occur any time there is at least one baserunner and fewer than two outs. The center fielder (CF) is one of the three outfielders, the defensive positions in baseball farthest from the batter. Center field is the area of the outfield directly in front of a person standing at home plate and facing beyond the pitcher's mound. The outfielders' duty is to try to catch long fly balls before they hit the ground or to quickly catch or retrieve and return to the infield any other balls entering the outfield. Generally having the most territory to cover, the center fielder is usually the fastest of the three outfielders, although this can also depend on the relative strength of their throwing arms and the configuration of their home field, due to the deepest part of center field being the farthest point from the infield and home plate. The center fielder normally plays behind the shortstop and second baseman, who play in or near the infield; unlike catchers and most infielders (excepting first basemen), who are virtually exclusively right-handed, center fielders can be either right- or left-handed. In the scoring system used to record defensive plays, the center fielder is assigned the number 8.\nCenter fielders are most commonly credited with a double play when they throw the ball to an infielder who tags a runner attempting to advance on the basepaths, even on a caught fly ball that results in an out (see tag up); of special importance are throws to the catcher if the runner is trying to reach home plate to score a run, perhaps on a sacrifice fly. Left fielders will often record assists by throwing out runners who try to advance farther than the batter, such as going from first to third base on a single, or batter/runners who try to stretch a hit into a longer one. Outfielders also earn double plays on relay throws to infielders after particularly deep fly balls, by throwing to a base to record an out on an appeal play, or in situations where they might deflect a fly ball before another defensive player makes the catch; in extraordinary instances, right fielders have occasionally recorded double plays by throwing out batters at first base after fielding uncaught line drives that reached them quickly. Outfielders record far fewer double plays than other players due to the difficulty of making an accurate throw in time to retire a runner from a great distance; middle infielders routinely record more double plays in a single season than outfielders do in their entire careers. Double plays are an important statistic for outfielders, giving a greater indication of a left fielder's throwing arm than double plays by infielders do. In recent years, some sabermetricians have begun referring to assists by outfielders as baserunner kills.\nTris Speaker is the all-time leader in career double plays as a center fielder with 146; he is the only player to record more than 100 career double plays as a center fielder. Jackie Bradley Jr. , who had 20 double plays through the 2023 season to place him tied for 82nd all-time, is the leader among active players."

The Warriors represented Merrimack College, played their home games at the J. Thom Lawler Rink and were coached by Scott Borek, in his sixth season.\nSeason.\nComing off of its first NCAA tournament appearance in twelve years, Merrimack entered the year with some expectations for its program. Though the team had lost several depth players to graduation, the Warriors returned the top three forwards as well as both of their starting goaltender. However, just before the opening game, Alex Jefferies was injured in practice and missed the first month of the season. Without their leading scorer, the team was unable to do much offensively against Arizona State but the Warriors soon recovered and posted three solid wins to finish out October.\nOnce Jefferies returned in early November, the team was hoping to continue their upwards trend but the goaltending gave out. Over a six-game stretch, Merrimack lost four 1-goal games with neither netminder finding much consistency. The Warriors recovered a bit over Thanksgiving, winning two matches against weak Atlantic Hockey teams, but ended the first half of their season with three consecutive losses. Both Zachary Borgiel and Hugo Ollas were struggling to keep the puck out of the net and coach Borek had no option but to hope at least one of his goaltenders would recover their form from '23.\nMerrimack was able to pick itself up after the winter break when Borgiel strung three solid games together and lifted the Warriors record back to .500. Ollas joined in to help earn a split against #13 Massachusetts in the middle of January, however, Jefferies went back on the shelf after the second match and was out of the lineup for three weeks. Merrimack lost every game that their top forward missed and when he returned the team was well and truly out of the race. Borgiel's play had also degraded to the point that the goaltending rotation was ended in mid-February with Ollas taking over for the remainder of the season. Merrimack was able to salvage what was left of their season and play even in the final few weeks but that only saved the team from finishing last in the standings.\nWith an abysmal record in conference, the Warriors were going to have to run through a gauntlet of strong teams if they wanted to reach the tournament once more. However, the team was unable to surmount even their first challenge. Northeastern shut down the Merrimack offense, blacking the team for the first time since the opening game and swiftly ended the Warriors' season.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \nRankings.\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "text": "The 1923–24 Boston College Eagles men's ice hockey season was the 7th season of play for the program. The Eagles were coached by Charles Foote in his 1st season.\nSeason.\nAfter winning the program's first championship, Fred Rocque resigned as head coach. The school did not settle on his replacement until December when they brought in Charley Foote to be the new bench boss. While he had several returning players to rely upon, the team barely was able to get in any practice time before the first game.\nWhen the team hit the ice for their first match, the biggest change was on the blueline. Both starting defensemen had graduated so Culhane, who had previously played wing, was deployed alongside Mahoney, who had been a reserve player as a freshman. There was a bit of hand-wringing over the novice defense but the Boston Hockey Club showed that the bigger worry was on offense. The forwards were without star center Leo Hughes and found it difficult to score in the opening loss. The following week saw those trends continue as the forwards could still only record a single goal, however, the defense was better than advertised and provided the team a win with a 1–0 shutout of McGill. Just as the team was beginning to feel good about its chances, however, the hopes of a repeat championship were dashed by a pair of Canadian colleges after Christmas. The smaller BC team was pushed around by their northern opponents and could only manage 2 goals in 3 consecutive defeats.\nThough the first part of the season would not normally have precluded Boston College from competing for a second championship, the Eagles were scheduled to play just three intercollegiate games all season. This happened in part because the team was unable to afford playing more than a few road games but also because the future Ivy League team would not play against BC. This left BC only able to judge itself against common opponents and many of the teams that they faced were superior in talent, training and experience. Even when they played local teams like the Boston Athletic Association, they were playing against semi-pros, many of whom were former college stars. BC did well to keep the score close in those games but they finished out the month of January with three further losses and sat with a terrible 1–7 record midway through their season. Hampering the efforts of the club was the lack of suitable reserve players that forced the starters to play most of if not all of the time. Several of their games were lost in the final minutes but that fact did little to improve their chances for a title.\nAfter a match with the B.A.A. at Green Hill Park during the exam break, the team returned home with a renewed fight from the forwards. Groden opened the scoring against the Boston Hockey Club but it was Culhane who was the star. The junior winger netted two goals, including the overtime winner, to give BC its first win in almost two months. After a pair of close wins over amateur clubs, BC travelled to meet Army for their only intercollegiate match of the season. The Eagles fought bitterly with the Cadets for the win and the two sides needed overtime to settle the score. In the extra session, however, the game completely tilted in favor of Boston College and the Maroons scored three additional goals to take the match. During that stretch, Mahoney had been felled by an injury and was replaced on the blueline by Fitzgerald. Fitz' place in goal was aptly filled by Connell.\nWith their winning streak up to 4 games, BC headed home with a chance to finish the year above .500. The only problem was that in all 5 of their remaining games, the team would face amateur or semi-pro teams made up of more experience players. The Eagles didn't seem to mind when they dispatched Montreal Le National after a brilliant opening period. A further win brought the team's record back to even but that was as far as the Eagles could go. The offense sputtered in the final three games of the year, all losses, and even with the return of Mahoney, the defense wasn't able to withstand the attack from their opponents. To add insult to injury, in the final game of the year a fight broke out in the stands. One man was injured after being pushed down the stone stairs and the police were called in to break up the melee. While The section that contained the students from BC were not a part of the riot, the school was nonetheless censured for the disruption.\nWilliam Kelleher served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

The Hawkeyes were led by head coach Lisa Bluder in her twenty-fourth season, and played their home games at Carver–Hawkeye Arena as a member of the Big Ten Conference.\nAfter finishing second in the conference regular season standings, the Hawkeyes won the Big Ten tournament for the third consecutive season and received an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. During the NCAA tournament they defeated Holy Cross, West Virginia, Colorado, LSU, and UConn to return to the title game for the second consecutive season. However, the Hawkeyes were defeated by top-ranked and undefeated South Carolina, 87–75, in the national championship game. Iowa finished the season with a record of 34–5 to set a program record and tie the Big Ten record for wins in a season.\nSenior Caitlin Clark, who entered the season as the reigning National Player of the Year and a pre-season All-American, exceeded impossibly high expectations to leave an indelible mark on the University of Iowa and women's college basketball. Clark capped her career by being named both Big Ten Player of the Year and a unanimous First-team All-American for the third time, swept National Player of the Year awards for the second time, and finished with numerous NCAA records highlighted by the NCAA career scoring record. Despite Clark's on-court accomplishments, she remained consistent that her legacy is more closely tied to broader impact growing interest in the sport and inspiring the next generation. The final three games of Clark's career became the three most watched women's college basketball games of all-time. On April 10, at a celebration event at Carver–Hawkeye Arena, Iowa announced that Clark's jersey number 22 would be the third number to be retired in program history.\nThe senior class, led by Clark, Kate Martin, and Gabbie Marshall, concluded their college careers having secured four NCAA tournament appearances, including three Sweet Sixteens and two Final Fours.\nPrevious season.\nThe Hawkeyes finished the 2022–23 season with a 31–7 record, including 15–3 in Big Ten play. They won the 2023 Big Ten women's basketball tournament and earned the conference's automatic bid to the 2023 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament. They advanced to the championship game for the first time in program history, but they lost to LSU 85–102.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=9 style=\"| Exhibition\n!colspan=9 style=\"| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"| Big Ten Women's Tournament\n!colspan=9 style=\"|NCAA tournament"

This will be the sixth season of the championship and the fourth after a merger with Formula Renault Eurocup which resulted to the change of the engine supplier to Alpine.\nTeams and drivers.\nThe same twelve teams that contested the 2023 season were also pre-selected for the 2024 season. Arden Motorsport and Monolite Racing later relinquished their entries, confirming their withdrawal in April. Iron Dames joined the championship, fielding an all-female lineup.\nTeam changes.\nArden Motorsport withdrew from the championship, instead electing to focus on their GB3 and GB4 efforts.\nMonolite Racing, a mainstay in the series since 2020, also elected to withdraw, after talks with GB3 race winner James Hedley and Jacques Villeneuve protégé Kevin Foster did not materialise.\nIron Dames, the female talent development project of Iron Lynx, an endurance racing team owned by the same parent company as Prema Racing, entered the championship with two cars.\nDriver changes.\nReigning Teams' Champions Prema Racing saw two of their driver leave the championship, with reigning Driver's Champion Andrea Kimi Antonelli graduating to the team's Formula 2 outfit and Lorenzo Fluxá joining Cool Racing's ELMS program.

As a result of Świątek's fourth-round loss, Sabalenka claimed the top ranking for the first time in her career.\nThe third round match between Caroline Wozniacki, ranked No. 623, and Jennifer Brady, ranked No. 433, who were both playing their first majors in more than two years, was the first third round match in any major between two players outside the top 300 in singles rankings, male or female.\nThis was the first major since 2019 US Open in which all eight of the quarterfinalists were seeded. Sorana Cîrstea made her first US Open quarterfinal on her 15th attempt, an Open Era record shared with Nathalie Tauziat. Cîrstea reached her second major quarterfinal 14 years after her first at the 2009 French Open, second only to Mirjana Lučić-Baroni's near 18-year gap between major quarterfinal appearances.\nSeeded players.\nThe following are the seeded players.

The Catamounts represented the University of Vermont, played their home games at the Gutterson Fieldhouse and were coached by Steve Wiedler in his 1st season.\nSeason.\nDuring the summer, Todd Woodcroft was fired after an internal investigation by the college determine that the coach had exchanged inappropriate text messages with a student. Because the investigation had taken four months, by the time it concluded there was relatively little time to conduct a hiring search before this season. The Athletic department chose simply to promote Steve Wiedler to interim head coach and keep the rest of the staff in place.\nWith off ice issues settled for the moment, the team set about fixing their biggest problem; the lack of offense. The '23 Catamounts were one of the worst scoring team in the country, averaging less than 2 goals per game for the season. With that in mind it was perhaps a good thing that there were so many new faces for the program in '24. The team had trouble out of the gate with the new roster and coach struggling to find consistency. Vermont, too, was hampered by the vast strides for the rest of the conference as Hockey East was the top ranked league in college hockey that season. However, despite the difficulties, the Catamounts were able to take a step forward and climb out of the cellar.\nThe offense saw a slight improvement as the year went on with Jens Richards making huge strides in his game. The forward went from 4 points as a freshman to leading the team in his sophomore season. While the overall numbers weren't outstanding, the more-than 5-fold improvement was not something to be discounted. In goal, Gabe Carriere held the fort and kept Vermont in the game on most nights. Even when facing nationally ranked teams, the Catamounts proved to be a tough team to beat and they managed to win their fair share of games. By the end of the season, Vermont was 9th in the standings but, with how difficult their schedule had been, they were in the middle of the PairWise rankings. While the dearth of offensives punch cost them in the playoffs, the team had progressed and looked better than they had in years.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \nRankings.\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "text": "The 1921–22 MIT Engineers men's ice hockey season was the 21st season of play for the program. The Engineers were coached by Powers in his 1st season.\nSeason.\nLearning from the mistakes of '21, new head coach Powers had the team hit the ice as soon as the football season had finished. The team did what they could to get ready, however, their opening match came against one of the best teams from Canada, McGill. The Redmen had no sympathy for the Engineers and steamrolled MIT 2–8. Though not unexpected, the loss was an ill omen for MIT's season and things weren't expected to get any easier in the next game. While they hadn't started the season well, Yale was still a dangerous team and never lost to MIT previously. The training that the team had undergone since early December finally paid off and the Engineers played like a well-oiled machine. MIT was outmatched by Yale's size and speed but they utilized one another to the utmost to keep the puck away from the Elis. When Yale did get control, the defense was aided by the backchecking forwards and slowed down the Bulldog attack. DuVernet was particularly conspicuous in the game and, though he failed to score, was responsible for constantly keeping the Yale defense off balance.\nThe historic victory for MIT spurred the team on and they took down Dalhousie in the same manner the following week. The Engineers then set their sights on Boston College and jumped out to a 2-goal lead in the first. Unfortunately, BC was one of the top offensive teams in the country and were able to claw their way back in the final two periods to give the Engineers their first intercollegiate loss of the season. The team seemed to carry their offensive hangover into the next game and were outplayed by MAC for the first two periods. Luckily, the defense held the fort and stopped everything that was thrown at Nickle. After shaking off their doldrums, MIT exploded for 6 goals, exploiting an Aggie squad that expended all of its energy in the first two periods.\nWith a championship still possible for the Engineers, the team entered its game with Harvard looking for a repeat of the Yale match. Early on, the MIT defense succeeded in breaking up many passing plays by the Crimson forwards. Unfortunately, once Harvard realized that teamwork wasn't succeeding, they changed to playing as individuals. Almost as soon as that happened, the Engineers' defense collapsed. MIT wasn't able to keep up with their speedier opponents and time and again a solo rush up the ice ended with a Harvard goal. To make matters worse, Harvard was also one of the best defensive teams in the country and gave the Engineers few opportunities to score. When the dust settled the score was 2–9 and any hopes that MIT had for a title had been erased.\nA malaise settled over the team and the Engineers lost their next three games, culminating with the rematch with BC. The Engineers were a shell of their former selves and were easily dispatched by the Eagles 0–6. Fortunately, by the time they hit the road for the final match, the Engineers had shaken themselves out of their funk and were ready to end the season on a high note. Due to warm weather, the game was played on a nearby pond and was dominated by the rough state of the ice. DuVernet and MacNeil were outstanding in the match, stopping many rushes from Williams. captain Nickle turned aside everything that leaked through, though he did receive a penalty for kneeling on the ice to stop a shot. Goals from MacNeill and Dalton ensured that the team would head home as victors.\nFrederick Kinch served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "title": "2023–24 Lake Superior State Lakers men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 2023–24 Lake Superior State Lakers men's ice hockey season was the 58th season of play for the program, the 51st at the Division I level and the 44th in the CCHA. The Lakers represented Lake Superior State University, played their home games at the Taffy Abel Arena and were coached by Damon Whitten in his 10th season.\nSeason.\nAfter an unmitigated disaster of a season, particularly on the offensive side of the puck, changes were needed at Lake Superior State. Thirteen new players joined the Lakers and the changes were evident early in the season. LSSU got swept in its opening weekend, but it came at the hands of a ranked Michigan State squad. After a home split the following weekend, the Lakers reeled off four consecutive victories and did so with a functioning offense. The chief instigators for this resurgence were two returning players, both of whom made tremendous improvements to their games. Jared Westcott led the team with 18 goals and nearly tripled his career high in points. Connor Millburn was an even bigger revelation, going from 5 points the year before to 35, helping Lake State improve its offense by more than a goal per game. Westcott and Millburn combined with Dawson Tritt to form the team's top unit and led the team's turnaround.\nIn goal, Ethan Langenegger was an adequate starting goaltender but the team struggled to put wins together. The Lakers alternated wins and losses in the first half and entered the winter break with a .500 record. With how volatile the CCHA was, the team could have finished anywhere in the standings but they would need to shore up their defensive deficiencies if they wanted to get home ice in the postseason. Lake Superior's failure at the Ledyard Bank Classic didn't really affect the team as, by then, it was already apparent that only the CCHA champion would make the NCAA tournament. A sweep of Northern Michigan two weeks later was far more important for the team but the wins were, unfortunately, fleeting. Over a 4-week stretch, the offense faltered and the team went 1–5 in conference play. The rough patch dropped the Lakers to 7th in the standings and Lake Superior was facing the prospect of starting their postseason run on the road.\nIn the latter portion of the campaign, Langenegger lost his grip on the starting job and the team began to rotate between him and Easton Hesse. The new entry into the Laker cage provided several good outing while the reduced minutes appeared to help Langenegger as well. The team managed to go 3–2 down the stretch, which included the Lakers' only shutout of the season, but hey were unable to get out of a road trip for the postseason.\nLake Superior opened against a surprising St. Thomas team in the quarterfinals, however, they weren't as overmatched by the #2 seed as they may have appeared. The two were separated by just one win in the standings while both were +6 in goal differential. Helping Lake Superior's chances was the Tommies being in the middle of a terrible stretch that had them win just once in their previous eight games. The Lakers took advantage of their vulnerable opponent and won the first game with relative ease. The defeat seemed to wake up St. Thomas, who outplayed the Lakers in game two to tie the series. Both teams showed up for the deciding game but Lake Superior seemed to be in trouble when Westcott took a match penalty for boarding early in the second period. However, despite being down a man, Connor Milburn scored a short-handed goal at the beginning of the penalty kill and the Lakers managed to stop all attempts from the Tommies during the disadvantage. In spite of the defensive heroics, Lake State was still down a goal entering the third. With Langenegger holding down the fort, Reagan Milburn picked the perfect time to score his second goal of the season and tie the game in the middle of the period. St. Thomas was forced to get out of their defensive shell and both teams battled for the next goal. As time was winding down, the Lakers got on an odd-man rush up the ice. After the initial shot was saved, the rebound bounced straight up in the air and landed in the crease right at the feet of Tritt the Laker winger batted the puck into the cage before anyone could stop him, scoring the winning maker with just 6.6 seconds to play.\nWhile the Lakers were hoping for a repeat performance in the conference semifinals, they were completely outmatched by Bemidji State. The team was outshot nearly 3-to-1 and were never really a threat to the Beavers. Even with that unceremonious end, the Lakers had taken a big step forward, climbing eleven spots higher in the national rankings.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \nRankings.\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "text": "The 2023–24 Air Force Falcons men's ice hockey season was the 56th season of play for the program and the 18th in Atlantic Hockey. The Falcons represented the United States Air Force Academy, played their home games at the Cadet Ice Arena and were coached by Frank Serratore in his 27th season.\nSeason.\nJust before the start of the season, the NCAA announced:\n\"The school, enforcement staff, men's ice hockey head coach and two assistant coaches agreed that ... two assistant coaches had approximately 18 impermissible recruiting contacts with a prospective student-athlete and his father before that student-athlete had entered the Transfer Portal\"\nThough he was not charged with any direct action, head coach Frank Serratore was responsible for the actions of his assistants. As such, a standard Level II penalty was applied to both Serratore and the two assistants who were unnamed in the release.\nOnce the season got underway, the Falcons very quickly proved to be an inconsistent team. After splitting their opening series against Lindenwood, one of the worst teams in the nation, Air Force followed that up with a split versus Michigan State, one of the best teams. That trend continued throughout the season and can mostly be attributed to the defensive side of the puck. Air Force had a very good season offensively, averaging 3 goals per game for the year. However, they allowed slightly more goals per game on average and were let down by a subpar season from Guy Blessing.\nDespite the deficiencies, the team finished 4th in Atlantic Hockey and earned a home stand for the conference quarterfinals. The Falcons outplayed American International in the first game, firing 32 shots to the Yellow Jackets' 18 but they were unable to overcome a strong goaltending performance from the opposing netminder. The second game saw Air Force jump out to a 2–0 lead in the first period but the team was unable to build on that lead for the rest of the match. AIC tied the game with less than two minutes to play and forced overtime. USAF ratcheted up their offense in the extra session, sending 15 shots on goal in just over 12 minutes but none of them could find the back of the net. A simple rush up the ice ended the game in the middle of the first overtime when a perfectly placed shot ricocheted in off of the crossbar and ended the Falcons' season.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \nRankings.\n&lt;br&gt;"

The track was released on June 22, 2017, as a stand-alone single. It was written by Boqdan Bespalov.\nReception.\nThe track received generally favourable reviews from critics. William Lee Adams of Wiwibloggs described the song and its lyrics as \"a strong vibe that suggests a woman in control\". Ryan Cobb of ESCXtra observed the track's contrast in sound to her previous Scandinavian-produced single \"Miracle\", noting the urban and R&amp;B influences within the song.\nMusic video.\nThe music video was released at the same time as the single and was directed by Ali Farhad. The video shows Samra performing choreography in multiple sports outfits, occasionally holding a badminton racket, with a background colour-scheme of pink and blue. The sensuality and simplicity of the music video raised comparisons with the videography of fellow female rapper Nicki Minaj, particularly the music video of the 2014 song \"Anaconda\"."

        "text": "The 1925–26 Union Skating Dutchmen men's ice hockey season was the 13th season of play for the program. The Skating Dutchmen represented Union College and were coached by Harold A. Larrabee in his 1st season.\nSeason.\nAfter a disastrous season the year before, it wasn't a surprise that the team was in search of a new coach at the start of the campaign. Training got underway in early January with team captain John Gilmour assuming the responsibilities of leadership. The first practices were held at the Mohawk Golf Club while the rink at Central Park was being finished. Many of the players ho had finished the year returned but of the six men who were ruled ineligible after the February exams, only Howard Hall was back with the team.\nThe Dutchmen got off to a quick start in their opening game. The forward combination of Gilmour, Clifford and Hyland was able to generate several scoring chances that resulted in a hat-trick for Hyland. The completely revamped defense manned by Schultze and Stone managed to hold off the Bobcats' attack while Bishop, another newcomer in goal, was key in Union's victory. After a game with Clarkson was cancelled on account of poor ice, the team travelled to Clinton to face Hamilton to following week. Slattery, another player who had been forced off the team last season, returned but his presence on the blueline didn't help the Dutchmen overcome the Continentals. Though no as bad as their last meeting, Hamilton still won in a walkover. Hyland opened the scoring early in the first and the team played well until the start of the second. From that point on the game was controlled by the Continentals and ended with the score 1–8.\nWith the upcoming exam break, the team paused until mid-February. During this time, H. A. Larrabee was brought in to be the team's coach. Upon their return, the Dutchmen didn't look any worse for wear and played well against Amherst. Clifford scored twice and had his team in the lead in the third, however, Amherst tied the score in the waning moments. Because both teams were active the following day, the two agreed to forgo any overtime and the match was called a draw. Clifford and Schultze swapped their positions for the next match as Union sought to get one over on Rensselaer. Hyland had suffered a slight injury in the Amherst game but attempted to gut it out against the Engineers. He was able to help Clifford and Gilmore score in the game but Union came up a goal shy. \nA week later the team hit the road and headed to Vermont. Hyland had aggravated his leg injury against RPI and was doubtful for either of the two games up north. Despite the concern, he ended up playing a starring role in moth matches. Union got off to a good start against Vermont but ended up squandering their lead as the Catamounts forced overtime. Vermont then scored at the start of the overtime session to put the Dutchmen on the brink. Union fought back in the brief time they had remaining and managed to cage two shots in the final seconds to pull out a 5–4 victory. Two days later Union followed a similar scrip with Clifford twice giving the team a 1-goal lead. Neither edge held and Middlebury eventually scored the winning goal in the final minute of play.\nDon Shannon served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "title": "2023 FIA GT World Cup",
        "text": "The 2023 FIA GT World Cup (formally the Macau GT Cup – FIA GT World Cup) was a Grand Touring (GT) sports car race held on the Guia Circuit in Macau on 19 November. It was the sixth FIA GT World Cup and the thirteenth GT3 car race to be held at Macau. The Automobile General Association Macau-China, the event's promoter, appointed the motorsports organiser SRO Motorsports Group to form a grid. The edition included two races: a 12-lap qualifying race and a 16-lap main event.\nRaffaele Marciello of Mercedes-AMG Team Landgraf won both the qualifying and main races from pole position. Marciello led every lap of both races, winning his second consecutive FIA GT World Cup and becoming the race's first repeat winner. Edoardo Mortara of Audi Sport Asia Team Absolute took second place and Augusto Farfus of ROWE Racing finished third.\nBackground and entry list.\nThe Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) sanctioned the 2023 FIA GT World Cup, the event's sixth edition, the thirteenth race in Macau for GT3-specification vehicles, and an undercard to the 2023 Macau Grand Prix. It was held at the Guia Circuit in the streets of the Chinese special administrative region of Macau on 19 November after three days of practice and qualifying, and was co-organised by the SRO Motorsports Group at the FIA's request. The FIA (the governing body of motor racing), the Automobile General Association Macao-China (Macau's FIA member club), and the Macau Grand Prix Organizing Committee signed a three-year agreement to hold the race, which had been cancelled from 2020 to 2022 due to travel restrictions imposed on foreign visitors caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in Macau and was instead held as a non-FIA recognised event. This was in contrast to previous agreements which were one-year contracts. The FIA nominated Pirelli as the race's control tyre supplier on a three-year contract beginning in 2023. Each driver could use five sets of slick tyres and three sets of wet-weather tyres during the weekend.\nDrivers had to have competed in an FIA-recognised GT3 championship race within the preceding two seasons or have considerable experience in Grand Touring (GT) cars to enter the event. Platinum, Gold, Silver, and Bronze-rated drivers were permitted to compete, but the FIA GT World Cup Committee might prohibit a competitor's entry if it deemed them to be too inexperienced. Entries were open from 1 July to 31 August. The FIA and the Macau Grand Prix Organizing Committee revealed the entry list on 25 October, which included five GT3 manufacturers (Audi, BMW, Ferrari, Mercedes-AMG and Porsche) and 21 drivers. All five preceding FIA GT World Cup winners, Maro Engel, Augusto Farfus, Raffaele Marciello, Edoardo Mortara and Laurens Vanthoor, entered the race. Climax Racing's Mercedes-AMG GT3 Evo was withdrawn after unsuccessfully trying to assign Lucas Auer as its driver, lowering the number of entries to 20.\nPractice and qualifying.\nTwo half an hour practice sessions were held on the afternoon of 16 November. Marciello, Christopher Haase and Matteo Cairoli competed for the fastest lap in the first session, with Marciello leading at 2:16.150 on his final fast lap. He was three-tenths of a second faster than Vanthoor in second, with Cairoli, Kévin Estre and Engel in third through fifth. There were no major incidents during the session. Marchy Lee temporarily stopped his Mercedes-Benz on the circuit at the start of practice before Daniel Serra's Ferrari 296 GT3 miscalculated the Melco hairpin on an out-lap, causing a car blockage that marshals cleared. Estre's Porsche suffered slight damage against the turn 15 barrier but continued with no apparent damage. The second practice session was delayed by half an hour owing to incidents during the Macau Grand Prix's first qualifying session, and lap times were quicker than the preceding session. Several drivers led the field before Cairoli lapped quickest overall at 2:15.532 late in the session. Marciello was 0.032 seconds slower in second, followed by Daniel Juncadella, Serra and Farfus. As with the first practice session, there were no major incidents or stoppages. On his final run, Engel overcorrected and drove into the run-off area at Lisboa corner, although his car was not damaged.\nFriday afternoon's half-hour qualifying session determined the qualification race's starting order with each driver's fastest lap times. The weather was dry and windy for qualifying. Marciello, in his final race as a Mercedes factory driver before moving to BMW in 2024, reset his own GT3 track record of 2:14.542 on his last quick lap on an old set of tyres to secure his third successive FIA GT World Cup pole position. Marciello was joined on the front row by Mortara, who was 0.216 seconds slower but had provisional pole until Marciello's lap in the last seconds of qualifying. Engel was third, bringing two Mercedes-Benz drivers into the top three, which he attributed to winds and slightly higher tyre pressures. Vanthoor was the fastest of the seven Porsche drivers, taking fourth ahead of Sheldon van der Linde, the highest BMW driver, in fifth. Juncadella took sixth, ahead of Serra's fastest Ferrari in seventh place. Farfus, Earl Bamber and Hasse made up positions eight through ten. Cairoli was unable to maintain his previous pace because he lost momentum, qualifying 11th. Alessio Picariello qualified 12th, ahead of fellow Porsche brandmates Estre in 13th and Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters champion Thomas Preining in 14th. Ye Hongli was the top placed Silver-rated driver in 15th, followed by Adderly Fong in 16th. Jules Gounon was the slowest Platinum-rated participant in 17th, ahead of Cheng Congfu in 18th, Chen Weian in 19th and Lee completed the starting order in 20th. Some drivers ran off into the Lisboa turn run-off area during qualifying. Estre triggered the session's only stoppage when he misjudged his braking point and collided with the outside tyre barrier at Lisboa turn 12 mintes in, causing minor damage to his Porsche's left-front corner. Estre's car had to be removed from the barrier to continue driving. All cars returned to the paddock during the stoppage. Cairoli damaged his car's left front corner after leaving the circuit at Police turn, and Ye damaged the front of his car at Moorish Hill Corner five minutes before practice ended. \nQualification race.\nThe 12-lap qualifying race to set the main race's starting order commenced in an air temperature of at 14:05 Macau Standard Time () on 18 November. Marciello made a quick start to lead the race into the first corner, while Mortara and Engel battled for second, with the latter overtaking on the outside through the high-speed Mandarin Oriental Bend turn. Vanthoor lost four positions on the first lap after being forced wide at Lisboa corner and hitting the barrier, while Juncadella moved from sixth to fourth. Preining collided with the guardrail barrier at the entry to San Francisco Bend corner due to driver error, while Cairoli stopped with heavy rear-end damage after colliding with Ye. The safety car was deployed for the first time for four laps to allow for the safe recovery of the crashed cars. Both drivers were unhurt, however Cairoli was transported to the medical centre for a headache. On lap five, Marciello retained the lead after fighting off Engel's attempts to pass him on the run to Lisboa turn. Juncadella tried to pass Mortara for third on the outside into Lisboa and was ahead of him into the turn. Mortara's position on the outside gave him an advantage and Juncadella was pushed into the outside tyre wall. Juncadella fell from fourth to ninth due to the incident, but he continued driving despite another impact with Farfus, removing his front-right side-view mirror. The first three drivers pulled away from the rest of the field.\nOn lap eight, Fong lost control of his car's rear in the Mandarin Oriental Bend turn due to a loss of some downforce from being affected by turbulence from a vehicle ahead of him. His car's left-rear wheel made minor contact with the inside wall leaving the turn, breaking the rear-left suspension's tie rod and sending him across the track. He struck the outside side barrier exiting the corner before ricocheting across the track. Although his Audi was heavily damaged, Fong was unhurt and quickly exited the car unaided. Fong did not need medical assistance. Race officials dispatched the safety car for the second time before stopping the race with a red flag on lap nine to allow marshals to clear the track of debris and repair the heavily damaged barrier. Every driver returned to the pit lane for the stoppage. The race resumed behind the safety car 23 minutes later, at 14:57 local time, and the drivers exited the pit lane behind the safety car. After one lap behind the safety car, the remaining 17 drivers resumed racing, with Marciello keeping the lead and holding off Engel into Lisboa corner. Van Der Linde passed Serra for fifth into Lisboa turn and regained control of his car despite missing his braking point. There were no change of positions on the final lap, and Maricello pulled away to lead the final two laps and win the qualification race and secure pole position for the main race. Engel finished 1.172 seconds behind in second and Mortara was third. Farfus, Van Der Linde, Serra, Vanthoor, Haase, Juncadella, Bamber, Picariello, Estre, Cheng, Chen, Gounon, Ye and Lee were the last of the finishers. Of the 20 starting drivers, 17 completed the race.\nQualification race classification.\nNotes:\nMain race.\nThe 16-lap main race began in dry weather conditions of at 12:05 local time. Uno Racing Team inspected and withdrew Fong's car owing to chassis damage sustained in the incident in the previous day's qualification race, lowering the number of starting cars to 19. Marciello accelerated from the rolling start to maintain the lead into the first corner, and after defending against Engel, he pulled away on the drive to Lisboa turn. Van Der Linde moved from sixth to fourth while his brandmate Farfus fell from fourth to sixth on lap one. On the following lap, Van Der Linde slipstreamed behind Mortara's car by using his BMW's higher top speed but could not pass him. Engel began suffering from a broken paddle shifter on lap four but the problem exacerbated after examining the cables and connections between the dashboard and the steering wheel. Mortara occasionally closed up to the back of Engel's car, as Van Der Linde applied pressure. On lap eight, Estre collided with the side of Bamber's Porsche at Lisboa turn, damaging his rear diffuser with subsequent contact while contending for tenth. Soon after, Chen made a driver error and crashed into the tyre barrier at the same point, leading race control to deploy the safety car for a single lap because the track was partially blocked.\nMarciello raced away from the field on the lap ten restart after Engel was unable to select second gear owing to a full failure of his paddle shifter and could not drive at full speed. All other drivers were delayed as series regulations banned overtaking before the start/finish line immediately after the safety car's withdrawal. Engel dropped to 18th and drove slowly to the pit lane to retire his car, indirectly because of the safety car period. This promoted Mortara to second and Van Der Linde to third, with Marciello holding a 2.7-second lead. Attention focused on Mortara and Van Der Linde in the battle for second, until the latter made an unscheduled pit stop on lap 11 to replace a left-rear tyre puncture that was caused by on-track debris. Van Der Linde rejoined the track at the back of the field, moving his brandmate Farfus to third, who had overtaken Serra at the restart. On the penultimate lap, Estre collided with the barrier at Fisherman's Bend, removing his rear fender and dropping him from ninth to twelfth. \nThere were no more overtakes, as Marciello led every lap of the race weekend to clinch his second consecutive FIA GT World Cup victory following his first in 2019 and became the event's first repeat winner since it was first held in 2015. Mortara lagged behind the BMWs and Mercedes-AMGs in terms of acceleration and top speed on the long straights, finishing second 2.51 seconds later. Farfus finished third on the podium, ensuring that three different manufacturers were in the first three places. Serra was the highest-finishing rookie driver in fourth. Juncadella moved from ninth to fifth, ahead of Porsche's best-placed driver Vanthoor in sixth and Hasse was seventh. Picariello took eighth, Bamber came ninth and Ye was the highest-placed silver-ranked entrant in tenth and earned the Silver Cup. Cairoli, Estre, Cheng, Gounon, Preining, Van Der Linde and Lee were the final finishers."

The team was led by tennis star William Clothier and won its first game against the Bala Cricket Club on January 5. Though two losses followed, including a rematch with Bala, the team was able to claim the city championship when it defeated Penn in mid-February.

Without a nearby rink, the team would have been forced to travel to New York City to play games and the athletic department could not afford those travel costs.

Conference play began in December 2023 and concluded on March 9, 2024. The 2024 ACC men's basketball tournament was held at the Capital One Arena in Washington, D.C. from March 12 to March 16, 2024. This was the 70th season of Atlantic Coast Conference basketball.\nNorth Carolina finished as regular season champions with a 17–3 conference record. They finished two games ahead of second place Duke. The title was North Carolina's thirty-third in program history, extending their ACC record. They reached the final of the ACC tournament but were defeated by tenth-seed NC State. As tenth-seed, NC State became the lowest seeded team to win the ACC Tournament in its history. The ACC sent five teams to the NCAA touranment and the teams finished with a record of 12–5 in the tournament. NC State was again the cinderella and advanced the furthest out of any team as an eleventh seed. They advanced to the Final Four, but lost to Purdue.\nHead coaches.\nCoaches.\n\"Notes:\"\nPreseason.\nRecruiting classes.\n\"Notes:\"\nPreseason polls.\nACC Preseason Media poll.\nThe preseason poll and Preseason All-ACC Teams were released on October 26, 2023, prior to the season beginning and after ACC Media Day.

The Bulldogs were coached by Skip Guinto, who was approached by the Jhocsons, owners of NU, to coach their team. The Bulldogs relied on Antonio Villamor to defeat the FEU Tamaraws to win their first title.\nThe Bulldogs then produced players such as Narciso Bernardo and Jun Papa, but never came close to a repeat Finals appearance, until Reynaldo Sigua was acquired by NU. Sigua led the Bulldogs to a Finals appearance in 1970 against the UE Red Warriors. The Red Warriors prevailed, winning their sixth consecutive UAAP title.\nBy the 1980s, however, NU was perennially in the bottom ranking of the team standings. In the late 1990s, they improved their ranking by moving up to the middle of the team standings with now PBA stars Danny Ildefonso and Lordy Tugade in their team roster, but still failed to make it to the Final Four.\nIn the last quarter of year 2008, the family of Henry Sy of SM Prime Holdings acquired majority ownership of the National University. Aside from improving school facilities, the new management has included in their corporate plan the improvement of NU's sports programs. After ten years, the National U Bulldogs made it again to the UAAP Final Four in 2012.\nUAAP Season 77.\nAt the start of UAAP Season 77, the NU Bulldogs were predicted to lose some ground in the standings due to the losses of key players like former UAAP MVP Ray Parks and foreign student athlete Emmanuel Mbe, but was still expected to compete due to the emergence of players like Troy Rosario, Gelo Alolino and Glenn Khobuntin. \nIn the 2nd round of the tournament, the Bulldogs fell to the 4th spot in the standings. tied with the UE Red Warriors. They faced UE again in a knockout game for the 4th seed, which they won 51–49. They then defeated the 1st seed Ateneo Blue Eagles twice in the Final Four tournament (as Ateneo had a twice-to-beat advantage, due to their high seed), making them the 2nd number 4 seeded team in UAAP history to defeat a number 1 seeded team, as well as their first trip to the UAAP Finals since 1970.\nIn the UAAP Season 77 Finals, the Bulldogs faced the FEU Tamaraws in three games, where they finally clinched the championship after winning Game 3, 75–59. This marked the NU Bulldogs' first UAAP Men's basketball championship win in 60 years.\nRoster.\nThe NU Bulldogs Basketball Team\n \nSeason-by-season records.\nUntil 1997, the UAAP primarily ranked the teams by tournament points using FIBA's method. Starting in 1998, the UAAP primarily ranked by winning percentage. There's no difference in ranking once all games were played, but in the middle of the season, rankings made by these two methods may differ.\nNotable players.\n&lt;br&gt;"

The Engineers were coached by Al Blacklock in his 1st season.\nSeason.\nWith a new coach and half of the players new to the program, the Engineers had precious little time to get ready for their first game of the season. Despite the early start, MIT was nonetheless able to defeat Boston University in the opening match. With almost a month until the next game, the Engineers spent whatever time they could scrounge at the Boston Arena, preparing for the showdown with Princeton. Unfortunately, MIT was no match for the mighty Tigers and the Bostonians were swept off of the brand new Hobey Baker Memorial Rink. The following week, the team was blanked for a second time at the hands of Boston College. While those results weren't encouraging, the two losses came against two of the best teams in college hockey.\nMIT was able to get back on the winning side of the ledger in their rematch with BU. Though it was a much closer game, the Engineers proved to be the superior squad and then carried that momentum into a win over Army a few days later. January ended with the team facing its old nemesis, Harvard, with MIT still hopelessly outgunned by the college hockey elite. Harvard steamrolled the Engineers 0–10, which was a portent of things to come. In their final two matches, MIT faced two more Ivy League teams and saw similar results in both. While their defense was slightly better against Yale, they suffered their worse loss on the year in the finale against Dartmouth.\nBoynton Fletcher served as team manager with Theodore Butler and Walton Jarman as his assistants.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The men's madison event at the 2022 Asian Games was held on 29 September 2023 at Chun'an Jieshou Sports Centre Velodrome in Chun'an.\nThe Madison is a race where each team aims to complete more laps than any of the other teams. Riders in each team take turns during the race, handing over to another team member, resting, and then returning to the race. Teams are of two riders. Only one rider of the team is racing at any time, and the replacement rider has to be touched before taking over. The touch can also be a push, often on the shorts, or one rider hurling the other into the race by a hand-sling. How long each rider stays in the race is for the members of each team to decide.\nThe distance is 200 laps (50 kilometres). Teams score points in two ways: lapping the field and sprints. A team that gains a lap on the field earns 20 points; one that loses a lap has 20 points deducted. Every 10th lap is a sprint, with the first to finish the lap earning five points, second three points, third two points, and fourth one point. The points values are doubled for the final sprint. There is only one round of competition, It is a tag team points race that involves all teams competing at once without a preliminary round to reduce the number of teams.\nThe Madison was an Asian Games event for men in 2002 and 2006, but was dropped ahead of the 2010 Guangzhou Asian Games. In June 2017, the International Olympic Committee announced that the Madison would be added to the Olympic programme for the 2020 Summer Olympics. The 2020 Games includes a relaunch of the men's Madison event, as well as the introduction of the women's Madison as an Olympic event for the first time. Therefore the madion event also got included to the Asian Games programme from the 2018 Games in Indonesia.\nA total of eleven teams participated in the competition but four of them, India, Uzbekistan, Thailand and Macau failed to finish the race after falling two laps behind. The Japanese team of Naoki Kojima and Shunsuke Imamura won the gold medal with 24 points ahead of Shin Dong-in and Kim Eu-ro from South Korea, as both teams tied on points the gold medal went to Japan for finishing better in the last sprint.\nArtyom Zakharov and Ramis Dinmukhametov from Kazakhstan beat the defending champion from Hong Kong to win the bronze medal by collecting 37 points."

        "title": "1922–23 Michigan Wolverines men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1922–23 Michigan Wolverines men's ice hockey season was the inaugural season of play for the program. The team was coached by Joe Barss in his 2nd season.\nSeason.\nWhile a team from Michigan had competed against other colleges the year before, it wasn't until the winter of 1922 that the school gave the program its blessing. The team was convened for the first time after returning from the winter break and the initial practice was conducted by assistant athletic director George Little while the school searched for a full-time head coach. Michigan, along with Big Ten counterparts Minnesota and Wisconsin, formed the Western Intercollegiate Hockey League, using the same rules that the Big Ten had for eligibility and participation. From the start, the new conference was open to other hockey schools joining so long as they conformed to the same guidelines. Both Chicago and Northwestern had informal hockey teams at the time and were expected to join in short order.\nBecause the conference had only three members at the start, each would play the others four times during the season. Michigan's first game was set for the January 12 and gave the Wolverines very little time to get into shape. Joe Barss, who had coached the informal team the year before, was swiftly chosen as the first official coach of the program and he set about sculpting the team from the 35 initial candidates. While the team was being worked out, the Coliseum was being refurbished with new side boards and bleachers. The new accommodations could seat over 2,000 spectators and give Michigan a distinct advantage over some of its contemporaries. Just before the first game, coach Barss had whittled the team down to 9 players and named Kynle MacDuff, a holdover from the informal squad, as team captain.\nThe team kicked off the season with a solid defensive performance against Wisconsin. Eddie Kahn teamed with MacDuff to hold back the Badgers' attack and also ended up scoring the first goal in the history of the program at the 10-minute mark of the opening period. Wisconsin managed to tie the score and nearly won it near the end of the third but 600 fans were relieves when the referees disallowed the goal. Play picked up during the pair of 5-minute overtime periods and near the end of the first extra session, Michigan found itself down to just 2 skaters when MacDuff, Kahn and Anderson were all serving penalties. Fortunately, Comb saved the day and allowed the three to make up for their mistakes at the end of the second OT when a passing combination ended with Anderson's game-winning goal. The rematch that occurred the following evening saw an even bigger crowd but the game was marred by poor ice conditions. Kahn and MacDuff were again the stars of the show, stopping Wisconsin from getting anything going offensively while Comb cleaned up the few chances that leaked through. Lindstrom's long goal came off a face-off in the second period and gave Michigan its second win of the season.\nThe following Week, Michigan travelled to complete the season series against Wisconsin. Once more, the team's starting defensemen were front and center holding off the Badger attack. Near the end of the second period, a collision in the Wisconsin end sent five players sprawling on the ice but the puck ended up bouncing to MacDuff. The captain found himself free and fired a shot into the net for the only goal of the game. Beresford was later cut over the eye and replaced for the remainder of the match by Henderson. While the Michigan defense had been its strong suit in the first three games, the offense had yet to sort things out. That trend continued in the fourth and final game with Wisconsin and ended up costing the Wolverines, who were shutout for the first time in their history. Switching Beresford and Kahn to give the forwards some needed speed didn't help and the long goal given up by Comb was enough to end their winning streak but still left Michigan as the victors in the season series.\nMichigan continued its road trip by swinging through Minneapolis to take on the Gophers. Unfortunately, the offensive woes continued and Michigan was blanked in consecutive games by Minnesota. Comb was the only consistent performer in the series and kept Michigan in the game despite being outplayed by the Gopher skaters. Michigan returned home for a brief rest and then headed to Detroit for a match against Assumption. The Wolverines remained inept up front by Kahn was able to finally end the team's goal-less drought.\nDuring the exam break, the team played one game against a very strong Notre Dame outfit and finally saw the offense show some signs of life. Kahn and Henderson both scored to give the Wolverines a pair of 1-goal leads but Michigan was unable to hold onto either and fell to the Irish 2–3. The team's last chance to compete for a championship came two weeks later when Minnesota arrived for the final series. A winter storm pelted Ann Arbor but wasn't enough to dissuade 200 spectators from showing up and cheering on the Maize and Blue. With Lindstrom out of the lineup, MacDuff did his best to give them a show by opening the scoring but it was the Gopher captain, Frank Pond, who was the star of the game. He had a hat-trick by the end of the first period and Minnesota pulled away in the second to take the season series. The next night, the rematch looked to be heading the same direction when Minnesota built a 2–0 lead in the second period. Michigan's defense played much better than they had during the blizzard and stopped many scoring chances from the Gophers. Unfortunately, Minnesota broke up the Wolverines attack just as effectively and left Michigan down by a pair by the start of the third. After returning from the break in play, Michigan seemed to find a second wind and charged out of the gate, attacking the Minnesota cage mercilessly. After 5 minutes, Henderson, who had taken over at center, finally broke through and cut the lead in half. Michigan 's attack continued afterwards and the Gophers were unable to stem the tide. MacDuff tied the game in the middle of the period and, after taking a spill into the boards, Henderson completed the comeback with his second of the game.\nThe final game of the season came the following week when Michigan travelled for a rematch with Notre Dame. Early on, things looked good as Michigan opened the scoring while Kahn and MacDuff held back the Irish in the first period. However, Notre Dame broke the game open with three goals in the second and Michigan was unable to recover. A further two goal from the Fighting Irish left no doubt as to which team was better and Michigan's first season ended on a low note.\nHarold Friedman served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

From 1895 until 1996 this was the Rugby Football League Championship First Division. From 1996 this has been Super League. Since 2003, teams finishing first in regular season have been awarded the League Leaders' Shield.\nSince its inception the league has had multiple different ways of organising its structure and the ultimate winner of the competition. Due to these structural changes, primarily involving the periodic inclusion and non-inclusion of a playoff system, the team that finished first in regular season have not always been champions. The longest era of the league winners also being crowned champions was between 1973 and 1997. Between 1973 and 1997 a distinct Play-off competition, the Rugby League Premiership, was held which preceded the return to the play off and grand final format.\nA list of each seasons champions can be found at List of British rugby league champions. \nList.\nTeams that have been declared champions based off league position, and hence not by playoffs, are denoted in bold."

        "title": "2023 UST Growling Tigers basketball team",
        "text": "The 2023 UST Growling Tigers men's basketball team represented the University of Santo Tomas in the 86th season of the University Athletic Association of the Philippines. The men's basketball tournament for the academic year 2023–24 began on September 30, 2023, and the host school for the season was the University of the East.\nThe Tigers finished eighth and last at the end of the double round-robin eliminations for the second straight year with a 2–12 record after going through a 19-game losing streak that dated back from Season 85. They won only their opening game on October 1, 2022 and then went through a pile of defeats that continued to the current season, where they lost six straight games in the first round of eliminations.\nThey had an average winning margin of 6.0 points and an average losing margin of 16.5 points. Five of their losses were by blowouts, with one against the Ateneo Blue Eagles by 20 points in the first round, and two in each round against the De La Salle Green Archers and the UP Fighting Maroons, by 20, 31, 31, and 25 points, respectively. Their first round game against the Adamson Soaring Falcons resulted to a three-point overtime loss.\nNic Cabañero once again led the league in scoring with an average of 16.8 points per game. He scored 25 points in their first round game against La Salle, and finished with more than 20 points in three of their other games. He was ranked 8th in the players' MVP tally with 60.1 statistical points at the end of the second round of eliminations.\nRoster.\nThe Growling Tigers came out with a list of 18 players in the days leading to the start of the UAAP tournament. Sophomore guard Soysoy Escobido and former Tiger Cubs playmaker Jethro Escoto did not make the cut to the official 16-man roster.\n&lt;section begin=\"Roster\" /&gt;\n&lt;includeonly&gt;Depth chart&lt;/includeonly&gt;\n&lt;section end=\"Roster\" /&gt;\nRoster changes.\nFour players have departed the Growling Tigers' roster, with Jamba Garing and Ian Herrera graduating, and Richi Calimag and Royce Mantua transferring. Soysoy Escobido and Kendall Valentin were cut from the team's final lineup. Mantua, Escobido, and Valentin had suited up in the Tigers' preseason games, but Mantua decided to move to Adamson in September. Calimag left as early as February to transfer to San Beda in the NCAA.\nGaring averaged 3.6 points, 4.2 rebounds, and 1.2 assists per game in 15.7 minutes last season, while Calimag and Mantua averaged 3.5 and 3.3 points, and 2.9 and 2.3 rebounds in 14.6 and 10.5 minutes, respectively. Herrera saw limited action, playing behind Adama Faye, for 3.7 minutes per game.\nIn early February, then incoming assistant coach and former Growling Tiger Japs Cuan oversaw the team's training and observed positive development in the performance of their holdovers from Season 85. The coaching staff was still anticipating the arrival of new recruits that time.\nReplacing the six players were Angelo Crisostomo, Ivanne Calum, and Thirdy Esmeña, from UST's training pool, rookies SJ Moore and Mark Llemit, and Vince Ventulan, a one-and-done Filipino American recruit from Florida.\nMoore was ranked 15th among the National Basketball Training Center's top 24 high school players for 2023, and was named Most Valuable Player in the All-star game of the NBTC National Finals. The high-leaping swingman was a one-and-done high school player from the Arellano Braves, who averaged 19.0 points, 8.6 rebounds, 1.3 assists, and 1.3 blocks per game in the NCAA Juniors tournament. He led the Braves in ending the Letran Squires' winning streak in the first round with a double-double of 24 points and 18 rebounds, on top of four shot blocks in February. Moore made his commitment to play for the UST Growling Tigers official on March 24, 2023.\nUST Tiger Cub forward Mark Llemit committed to UST on April 13, 2023. He was named the 19th best high school player by the NBTC and had led the Tiger Cubs to the semifinals of both the UAAP and the Division 1 of the NBTC National Finals. Llemit had earlier scored a career-high 27 points against the UPIS Junior Maroons to lead his team to the Final Four in the UAAP Boys division in February. Both Moore and Llemit are eligible for five playing years starting in Season 86.\nCoaching changes.\nOn January 26, 2023, The Varsitarian, UST's student publication, reported that Bal David had resigned as the team's head coach, six months after taking on the position. The Tigers have had two coaching changes since the training bubble controversy in 2020. David replaced Jino Manansala and was appointed coach with only two months of preparation before the start of the 85th season of the UAAP. The team managed to get only a single win in the 14-game tournament under him.\nAs their Season 85 campaign ended, David had hoped to coach for one more season and continue UST's rebuilding in the offseason, but only two months after, the 50-year old mentor had tendered his resignation. When asked why he was stepping down, David alluded to the manner in which the basketball program was handled the past year.\nThe former Growling Tiger playmaker, who is best remembered for his championship-winning free throw during the 1994 UAAP Finals against La Salle, was in for a rough homecoming when he accepted the offer to coach the 2022 team. The Tigers were coming off a 3–11 win–loss campaign that was riddled with blowout losses, one that even broke the league record for the most lopsided outcome, when they got beaten by Ateneo by 50 points. Next came the decommitment of their blue chip recruits, when the Filipino American bigman Gani Stevens transferred to the University of the East, and the high-scoring Kean Baclaan's move to National University, as well as the ineligibility issues of two of their veterans, when Sherwin Concepcion and Bryan Santos were both ruled to have exceeded the league's age limit.\nOne week later, UST officially announced the appointment of returning head coach Pido Jarencio. Jarencio resigned in 2013 after leading the Tigers to back-to-back runner-up finishes when he accepted an offer to coach the NorthPort Batang Pier team in the Philippine Basketball Association. He signed a three-year contract on February 13, 2023 in the presence of the Institute of Physical Education and Athletics (IPEA) director Fr. Rodel Cansancio and UST rector Fr. Richard Ang. Also present in the signing were former Letran Knights' coach and Jarencio's Northport associate Bonnie Tan, who was named team consultant of the Growling Tigers; former Knights' team managers Waiyip Chong and Eric Ang, who were set to serve as UST's new managers; and an all-UST alumni coaching staff.\nOn July 10, 2023, the UST basketball program formally received support from San Miguel Corporation when they named Alfrancis Chua, former Glowing Goldie and current sports director of SMC, as the Tigers' Special Assistant to the Rector for Sports.\nSchedule and results.\nPreseason tournaments.\nThe rebuilding Growling Tigers opted to not participate in the preseason tournaments, and instead went to Korea to train for eleven days by playing tune-up games against professional teams from the Korean Basketball League, and against top collegiate teams.\nWhen the Tigers came back to the country, they joined the Breakdown Basketball Invitational tournament, where they fielded two teams composed of their blue chip recruits who are undergoing the residency period, as well as members of their training pool who were fighting for slots in the 16-man UAAP roster.\nThe Breakdown Basketball Invitational games were played in a single round-robin format and all of UST's games were broadcast via livestream on Sulit Breakdown Basketball's Facebook page.\nUAAP games.\nElimination games were played in a double round-robin format and all of UST's games were televised on One Sports and the UAAP Varsity Channel.\nSummary.\nEven as the Growling Tigers finished dead last in Season 85, ESPN Philippines ranked them in their preseason assessment just below the top four powerhouse teams of UP, Ateneo, La Salle, and NU, with a B-minus rating. UST had been serious in turning their fortunes around, when they welcomed the return of Jarencio, the coach who gave the community their last championship in 2006, and paved the way to finalizing the team's partnership with San Miguel Corporation. With it came the needed recruitment of high school standouts and blue chip players.\nAs early as last season, Nic Cabañero has been thrust into the role of King Tiger, after the team's veterans had left the roster. He was able to fulfill it by emerging as the league's scoring leader, although, he along with Adama Faye were the only bright spots of the team. This year, he looks to work on his leadership among his teammates.\nFirst round.\nThe Tigers suffered a ten-point opening day loss against the UE Red Warriors, and extended their losing streak from the past season to 14. UE led by as many as 19 points in the third quarter, but UST fought back with Cabañero and Mark Llemit spearheading a 13–4 run at the 2:03 mark of the fourth period to come within eight at 67–75. The Warriors then converted a triple and got Cabañero to commit his fifth foul after a charge was called on him against UE's Jack Cruz-Dumont. Dumont made both his free throws for the final count of 70–80.\nEarlier in the first quarter, the Tigers rallied back from a 9–22 deficit with 12 unanswered points until the buzzer sounded for a 21–22 count. UE recovered to end the half with a 12-point lead. Cabañero, Christian Manaytay, and Migs Pangilinan finished in double figures with 18, 15, and 10 points, respectively.\nCoach Pido Jarencio attributed the loss to the team's poor shot selection when they made only 21 of their 62 field goal attempts, and committed 20 turnovers. On top of that, Adama Faye, their Senegalese center sat out midway in the game after complaining of back pains, causing the team to lag on defense.\nUST lost in overtime against the Adamson Soaring Falcons and dropped to a 0–2 record. After the Falcons' Joem Sabandal hit a jumper in the last 5 seconds of regulation, Cabañero countered with a layup with 2.2 seconds left to tie the score at 68–all and send the game into overtime. The Tigers, however, could not score after, allowing the Falcons to orchestrate a 9–2 run. Cabañero then made back-to-back three point shots, the second of which was a running contested shot, to bring UST to within one at 76–77, with under 30 seconds remaining. Team captain Paul Manalang fouled Adamson's Mathew Montebon to stop the clock, who then made both free throws to increase the lead to three. With 2.7 seconds left, Pangilinan threw a shot from near midcourt, but missed the potential game-tying three. The game ended with the Tigers losing, 76–79. Pangilinan led the team in scoring with 18 points, 12 coming from four three-point shots. Cabañero and Angelo Crisostomo chipped in 17 and 10 points, respectively. They were without Faye, who was reported to have been continuously suffering from back pains.\nUST remained winless after losing by 20 points against La Salle. The Tigers have not won against the Archers for the past eight years, dating back to the second round of the 2015 season when they swept their opponents in both rounds of eliminations. They got dominated in the second half after maintaining an 11-point deficit from the first and second quarter. The Archers went on a 19–4 run to increase their lead to 26, with 3:37 left in the third period. It was a one-man show for the Tigers, as Cabañero forced his shots to finish with 25 points, while committing 8 turnovers in the process. No other player from UST scored in double digits, with Pangilinan and Manaytay contributing only 8 and 7 points. The absence of Faye proved to be a challenge for the team, both offensively and defensively.\nThe Tigers fell victim to the NU Bulldogs' strong first quarter, as they allowed their opponents to score 30 points to end the period on a 16-point deficit. UST never tasted the lead throughout the game, and even trailed by as many as 28 points at one point. Manaytay finished with 18 points and 9 rebounds, with the heavily-guarded Canañero adding 16 points, as they ended up losing for the 17th straight time since the first round of Season 85.\nWith Faye's continued absence, the Tigers got outrebounded, 25–45. When asked of their Senegalese player's status, Assistant coach Japs Cuan did not give a definite timeline for his return, while referring to the sophomore center's back issues. Faye, who led the league in rebounds in Season 85, has only suited up twice this season on limited minutes.\nUST suffered a 31-point blowout loss at the hands of the league-leading UP Fighting Maroons. The Tigers led early in the game and ended the first quarter with a 4-point deficit at 24–28, but were dominated in the second period when the Maroons poured in 31 points to extend their lead to 14, going into the halftime break. Their opponents' defense prevented them from scoring in the second half and were at one point trailing by as many as 37 points. In the end, UST allowed UP to score 110 points, the most made by a UAAP team since the 2018 season, when, coincidentally, it was also the Tigers who yielded a 69–110 loss against La Salle. Cabañero and Manaytay finished with 24 and 23 points, respectively, to topscore for the still-winless Tigers.\nThe Growling Tigers ended up in another 20-point loss, this time against the Ateneo Blue Eagles. UST could not get their shots to drop, scoring only 10 points in the first quarter to yield a 7-point deficit to Ateneo. They were able to maintain the distance by keeping pace with their opponents, scoring 23 points in the second period, and even managed to come within four points, at 58–62 behind Crisostomo's undergoal plays. It was in the second half when the Eagles got going and subjected UST to a 17–3 run. The Tigers went on a fouling spree, sending Ateneo to the free throw line fourteen times. The Eagles' Joseph Obasa, at one point made four successive three-point plays off fouls by Crisostomo and Echo Laure. Three Tigers ended up in double-digit scoring, with Cabañero, Manaytay, and Pangilinan finishing with 21, 17, and 11 points, respectively.\nWith the latest loss, the Tigers have surpassed their longest losing streak back in 2017, when they went winless for 17 straight games, beginning in their four-game skid from the second round of Season 79 until the last game of Season 80, when they defeated the UE Red Warriors for a 1–13 record. They are currently on a 19-game losing spell after winning only their opening game against Adamson in Season 85.\nUST finally ended their losing streak at the expense of the FEU Tamaraws. Cabañero scored 11 of his team-high of 23 points in the third quarter, highlighted by his basket at the buzzer after getting blocked by his taller defenders, securing a rebound, and scoring a putback while getting fouled for a three-point play. He converted his free throw to give the Tigers a 55–50 lead going into the final period.\nThey were able to increase their lead to eleven, midway in the fourth quarter, with Pangilinan hitting a triple. The Tamaraws went scoreless for seven minutes, until Xyrus Torres and L-Jay Gonzales got their shots to drop, cutting UST's lead to six at 65-59 in the last 2:47. Manaytay finished with a double-double of 10 points and 11 rebounds to add to Cabañero's 23 points. Kenji Duremdes also had a productive outing, hauling down 10 rebounds to go with his 7 points, 5 assists, and 2 shot blocks.\nSecond round.\nThe Growling Tigers ended the first round of eliminations with a 1–6 record for the second year in a row. But unlike last year, where the team's long losing streak of 13 games can be attributed to their lack of preparation, this year's squad even boasted of a strong backer and a coach who has already given the school a championship in the past. Things did not go as expected, though, as the Tigers went on to lose their first six games and extended their win drought to an unprecedented 19 games.\nEven with their breakthrough win over FEU in the last day of the first round of eliminations, UST was still at the bottom of the standings, trailing FEU and UE's 2–5 records. While it is mathematically possible for them to still make it to the playoffs, it will be a difficult task as history has shown that no team that has won only one game in the first round ever reached the Final Four. The highest rank that a UAAP team with a first-round single win got was a fifth-place finish, with Adamson pulling it off twice, in Seasons 72 and 84, and with UP in Season 79.\nIn order for UST to continue winning their remaining games in the second round, they have to hope for better offensive performances than they have shown in the earlier round. Cabañero, last season's scoring leader, is still this year's leader with 20.6 points per game, and is supported by Manaytay's 13.9 and Pangilinan's 9.6-point averages. But outside of the three players, no one in the team has scored more than 6.9 points per game, with consistency in shooting being a problem that hounded them throughout the first round. The Tigers ranked fifth in offense among the eight competing teams, with 72.9 points per game, against the combined 86.6-point average of their opponents.\nAdama Faye's continued absence has shown in their lack of rebounding, and, while they were able to duke it out with FEU, the other stronger teams will be tough to overcome in the second round. Faye led the league in rebounds with an average of 12.2 boards per game last year, but has only hauled down a total of three rebounds in the two games that he played in this season. The team's average of 40.4 rebounds per game ranks them last in the league.\nThe Tigers were once again dealt with a 31-point blowout loss, this time by La Salle, to begin the second round of eliminations. UST had engaged the Archers in a shootout, trading baskets early in the game, as they ended the first period by an eight-point deficit, at 21–29. La Salle's Kevin Quiambao and Evan Nelle led an attack to break away from the Tigers to end the half at 52–38. UST was not able to keep up as they allowed their opponent to breach the 100-point barrier for the second time this season. Cabañero and Manaytay led again in scoring with 13 and 10 points, respectively.\nUE ended their five-game losing streak at the expense of the Tigers. The Warriors clamped down on their defense, as UST was held scoreless for more than seven minutes in the third quarter, and were only able to score 7 points after trailing UE by 9 points at the half. The Warriors had gone on a 10–0 run until Vince Ventulan ended their scoring drought at 2:42 after firing a triple for a 49–65 score. Down from 16 points in the fourth quarter, Cabañero and Pangilinan shot three straight three-pointers to come within 10 at 59–69. Three minutes later, the Warriors exploded with a 14–4 run as UST found themselves in a 20-point deficit. Pangilinan, Cabañero, and Ivanne Calum led the team in scoring with 20, 18, and 11 points, respectively.\nThe Tigers' loss against Adamson has sent them on the brink of getting eliminated from Final Four contention after incurring their ninth defeat of the season. Trailing at 40–50 at the start of the fourth period, Manaytay, Ivan Lazarte, and Calum connived for a six-minute 10–2 run to come within two points at 50–52. UST then ran out of firepower as the Falcons bombarded them with three consecutive triples to increase the lead to 11, with 2:49 remaining in the game. Cabañero had an off game, managing to score only 9 points on a 3-of-15 field goal conversion. Manaytay, who had celebrated his birthday, was the only player to score in double digits for the Tigers with 13. Two other players in Calum and Lazarte scored 9 points, as Manalang, Pangilinan, and Duremdes contributed 8, 4, and 1 point, respectively.\nPrior to their game against the Falcons, The Varsitarian reported that Adama Faye is officially out of the Growling Tigers' roster, as he was set to fly out to his home country in Senegal to recover from his back injury. UST officials had earlier said that the team will release an announcement on the status of the second-year player. Suiting up in only two games this season, it was evident that the Tigers have missed Faye's inside presence as they got outrebounded by their opponents in seven out of the nine games they have played so far.\nAteneo ended their three-game losing streak at the expense of UST, as the Tigers were eliminated from Final Four contention with their 10th loss of the season. The Eagles started the game with a tough defense on UST, forcing them to commit turnovers, as they trailed 4–11, midway in the opening quarter. Cabañero, though guarded heavily, kept the Tigers' offense going, as he scored a three-point play to end the quarter at 12–22.\nA 9–0 rally by Ateneo's Kai Ballungay and Jared Brown saw UST's deficit increase to 18, at 16–34, but the Eagles committed back-to-back turnovers and allowed Migs Pangilinan to score two fastbreak layups. The first half ended with the Tigers trailing, 29–43. The third period began with a Ballungay putback to increase the Eagles' lead by two more points, before going on a six-minute scoring drought. UST was able to capitalize with a 10–0 run that was highlighted by a goaltending call on Ateneo's Joseph Obasa. The Eagles' Sean Quitevis ended their spell after scoring on a reverse layup. The Tigers answered with back-to-back baskets from Kenji Duremdes at the 1:57 mark to pull the team within four points, at 43–47. Ateneo's Chris Koon was able to sneak in a three-pointer as the third quarter buzzer sounded, for a 50–43 lead. The Eagles managed to score only seven points, on 3-of-22 shooting in the quarter.\nAteneo made another run to start the final period, scoring seven unanswered points in the first two minutes, causing the Tigers to call a timeout. After the break, UST was able to answer with a 10–2 rally of their own, to come within six, at 53–59, following a split by Cabañero at the free throw line. A layup by the Eagles' Raffy Celis off a baseline drive at the 1:56 mark increased their lead to eight, as Pangilinan and Mason Amos traded threes for a 56–64 score. Manaytay fouled out in the next possession after a moving screen was called on him. Koon was able to convert on the other end on an awkward shot to push Ateneo's lead up to ten, at 66–56. Kylle Magdangal then fired a triple and the Tigers went for a quick foul to stop the time. Celis made both free throws to seal the game for a 67–59 count. The Blue Eagles extended their win streak over the Growling Tigers to 17 games starting from Season 78.\nCabañero was three assists shy of a triple-double, tallying 16 points, 10 rebounds, and 7 assists. Pangilinan added 13 points, while Duremdes finished with 9 points and 9 rebounds. Manaytay, despite compiling 10 rebounds and 2 blocks, had an off game in offense as he scored only 2 points on a 1-of-6 shooting clip, while committing a team-high of 7 turnovers. The Tigers struggled with ball control, notably in the firsr half, as they turned the ball over 19 times, resulting to 23 transition points for Ateneo.\nThey outrebounded Ateneo, 50–48, but lost in the offensive boards, 18–23. Seldom-used Ateneo rookie Raffy Celis collared 9 offensive boards out of his total of 11 rebounds.\nThe Growling Tigers lost anew against the NU Bulldogs, 65–75, as they continued to struggle late in the second round of eliminations. Christian Manaytay led UST in scoring eight unanswered points early in the first quarter to pull his team to a three-point lead, after trailing at 4–9. That was the only time for the Tigers to taste the lead in the game, as the Bulldogs countered with an 11–4 run to end the period.\nThey began the second quarter with a 4–1 run from being down, 16–20. The Bulldogs buckled down to work and went on another 14–8 run. They limited Cabañero to only 6 points, on a 2-of-20 field goal at the half with their tight defense. Even as the King Tiger finished with a double-double of 13 points and 10 rebounds, they could not keep up with NU, as they trailed by as many as 18 points, midway in the fourth quarter. The Tigers attempted a mini-rally early in the period when Cabañero and Manaytay scored bask-to-back baskets to trim down the lead to 11, at 46–57, after being down by 15 at the end of the third quarter. The Bulldogs' PJ Palacielo countered with a tightly-contested undergoal shot to put an end to their uprising. Kean Baclaan followed it with an and-1 play, and Omar John made his own conversion for a 64–46 score and put the Tigers away for good, with still 4:39 left in the game. UST was forced into multiple turnovers, committing 14, and only shooting 35 percent as the Bulldogs tightened their defense in the second half. One of the few highlights in UST's game was a two-handed slam dunk by rookie SJ Moore in the closing seconds of the match.\nUST lost again against the UP Fighting Maroons by another blowout, as they dropped to a 1–12 record and remained winless in the second round of eliminations. Even without their head coach, as it was reported that Pido Jarencio had to sit out due to an illness, the Tigers were able to start strong and led early in the opening minutes, scoring 9 against UP's 2 points. It was then that the Maroons substituted their starters and took control with a 22–9 run that had UST trailing 18–24 to end of the first quarter.\nSeldom-used UP players Chicco Briones and Cyril Gonzales led their team to break away at the half for a 44–32 lead. The Tigers trailed by as many as 29 points late in the fourth period, even as the Maroons rested their starters and allowed their bench to score 73 out of the team's total of 86 points.\nCabañero and Manaytay both finished with 14 points, with Pangilinan adding 13 to topscore for the Tigers.\nThe Growling Tigers swept FEU in their two-game elimination matchup with a 57–53 win to end their season on a high note. They took advantage of the Tamaraws' struggle to score in the opening minutes of the game and went on to lead in double-digits for multiple times in the match. With a fifteen-point, 44–29 lead in the third quarter, the Tigers fell prey to an FEU rally, with L-Jay Gonzales spearheading a 21–10 run that continued to the final period. His teammate Jorick Bautista hit a three-point shot to cap the rally and pull the Tamaraws to a single-possession deficit, under one minute left on the clock.\nUST's point production became scarce that they had to rely on free throw conversions from Cabañero, Vince Ventulan, and Paul Manalang. Manalang, in particular, gave his team back their two-possession lead when he split his charities to pull the Tigers ahead at 57–53, with 16.9 seconds remaining.\nManaytay and Pangilinan finished the game in double-digits with 12 and 10 points, respectively. Cabañero managed to score only 8 points, on a 2-of-10 field goal.\nWith Faye sitting out, and eventually leaving the team, the Tigers were left to play their smaller centers and forwards, while they struggled at the post in scoring and defending. They were also suffering from the lack of a quality point guard to direct their offense. It was supposed to be better this year, as team captain Manalang was the only playmaker, prompting then-head coach Bal David to convert Cabañero to quarterbacking duties in Season 85. The arrival of Ivanne Calum was a welcome addition to relieve Manalang, but an injury to the veteran point guard in the offseason forced Calum to play extended minutes, and by the time the UAAP tournament commenced, he was already burned out.\nCabañero ended up carrying the team again, playing for more than thirty minutes per game. It was evident that the third-year guard had struggled physically during their second-round games, scoring under 10 points on two occasions, on a 3-of-15 and 2-of-10 shooting. Outside the trio of Cabañero, Manaytay, and Pangilinan, the rest of the team had to battle inconsistency in making their shots.\nAs the season prematurely ended for the Tigers, the team is now looking forward to Season 87, hoping the new recruits will be able to incorportate themselves into Jarencio's system.\nUAAP statistics.\nSource: Imperium Technology"

        "title": "Michigan–Minnesota men's ice hockey rivalry",
        "text": "The Michigan–Minnesota men's ice hockey rivalry is a college ice hockey rivalry between the Michigan Wolverines men's ice hockey and Minnesota Golden Gophers men's ice hockey programs. The first meeting between the two occurred on January 22, 1923 and is an extension of the long-standing conference rivalry between the two.\nHistory.\nShortly after the end of World War I, college ice hockey began to expand into the Midwest. both Michigan and Minnesota began fielding unofficial team in the early-1920s with the latter officially recognizing the sport in 1921. The following year Michigan began sponsoring ice hockey as well and the two were the only three Big Ten teams to support such programs (the other being Wisconsin). Minnesota was the dominant western team during the 20s and 30s, routinely winning the championship. however, Michigan served as the team's main foil during this period, winning three titles themselves.\nBoth teams continued to operate through the duration of World War II but it was Michigan who came to the fore afterwards. Led by former star player Vic Heyliger, the Wolverines won six National Championships in nine years, defeating Minnesota in the 1953 NCAA tournament. During this period, both teams were founding members of the MCHL, however, a disagreement over recruitment caused the conference to collapse in 1958. In the aftermath, Michigan, Minnesota and Michigan State formed an informal Big Ten conference but that was rendered superfluous when the previous MCHL members all reconvened and formed the WCHA. in 1959.\nMichigan flagged in the late 60s and in the wake of their deprivation, Minnesota surged to the top. The Gophers won three titles in the 70s as the rivalry cooled. In 1981, Michigan was one of four teams to leave the WCHA, ending the conference rivalry between the two. Minnesota remained one of the top teams in college hockey for the next 20 years while Michigan slowly rebuilt the program. By the early 90s both were routinely making NCAA tournament appearances and eventually met for one of the most iconic games in NCAA history. The two faced off in the 1996 quarterfinals and Mike Legg scored the infamous Michigan goal. The Wolverines won the game and went on to win their 8th national championship that year. The rekindling of the rivalry also coincided with the founding of the College Hockey Showcase, a series between the four Big Ten teams that had previously been rivals in the WCHA. During the 17 years that it was held, Michigan and Minnesota dominated the series.\nThe two would meet again in the 1997 tournament but it was not until 2002 that Minnesota was finally able to defeat Michigan in the tournament. The Gophers beat Michigan in the Frozen Four before going on to win their fourth national title. Minnesota then repeated the performance the following season for their fifth championship.\nIn 2011, after the return of Penn State's ice hockey program, the Big Ten announced that they would finally be sponsoring ice hockey as a conference sport. Michigan and Minnesota once more became conference rivals and soon rose to the top of the league. In ten seasons, the two have met in the conference championship game four times with Michigan winning three of those meetings.\nGame results.\nFull game results for the rivalry, with rankings beginning in the 1995–96 season."

        "text": "The men's kayak cross event at the 2023 ICF Canoe Slalom World Championships took place on 24 September 2023 at the Lee Valley White Water Centre in London.\nCompetition format.\nThe kayak cross event (formerly known as extreme kayak) is split into two phases - qualification time trials and knockout phase where 4 paddlers race each other head-to-head. Top 20 paddlers from the qualification advance to the knockout phase plus the 12 next fastest paddlers from countries that have not qualified in the top 20. There are 8 heats in the first round of the knockout phase with the top 2 paddlers from each heat advancing to the next round. The same rules apply in quarterfinals and semifinals.\nPaddlers start their run by sliding off the starting platform several meters above the water. Then they must navigate the downstream and upstream gates. Unlike in classic slalom, paddlers are allowed to touch the gates and even intentionally move them with their paddle, but not with a free hand. There is also a designated zone where paddlers must perform an Eskimo roll.\nAthletes can be penalized in three ways in each round, by receiving a fault (FLT) or by being ranked as lower (RAL). Faults are incurred for false starts, missing gates or failing to correctly perform the Eskimo roll. Athletes are ranked as lower (RAL) if they breach the safety requirements of the competition, such as by holding back another athlete with their hands or paddle, deliberately paddling over another athlete's boat, or by making dangerous contact with another athlete's head or body - all other non-dangerous contact is allowed. In each round athletes are ranked first by the order in which they cross the finish line, with those incurring penalties ranked in the following order: FLT, RAL, DNF, .\nThe final classification of athletes is determined in the following manner: Athletes eliminated at any phase of the competition will be given their rank based on the comparison of the qualification times of athletes eliminated at the same phase. All 3rd ranked athletes will be ranked above all 4th ranked athletes. The final rank of athletes who did not progress to the heats is determined by their qualification results.\nSchedule.\n\"All times listed are UTC+1.\"\nResults.\nTime trials.\nTop 20 qualify automatically. The last 12 spots go to fastest paddlers from countries not yet qualified.\nKnockout rounds.\nTop 2 from each heat, quarterfinal and semifinal advance to the next round.\nFinal ranking (Top 32).\nThe top 32 ranking determined by the knockout rounds. Bib numbers correspond to seeding after time trials."

        "text": "The 2023–24 Australian Baseball League season is the thirteenth season of the Australian Baseball League (ABL), and began on 17 November 2023. Six teams will compete in the season, down from eight in the previous season, due to Auckland Tuatara being liquidated and Geelong-Korea's exit from the league.\nTeams.\nNeither Auckland Tuatara nor Geelong-Korea will compete in the 2023–24 season.\nRegular Season.\nThe regular season began on 17 November 2023 and is scheduled to end on 21 January 2024. Due to the departure of Auckland Tuatara and Geelong-Korea, the ABL returned to a six-team, single-conference model. Each team will play 40 games (20 home and 20 away) across 10 rounds and will face every other team twice (once at home and once away) in four-game series.\nThe 1 December game scheduled between Canberra and Perth was originally postponed due to rain but later cancelled due to the lack of suitable schedule space to make up the game. Adelaide was the first team to clinch a playoff position in Round 8, followed shortly after by Brisbane and Perth in the same round. Canberra was eliminated in the same round, leaving just Melbourne and Sydney to fight for the final playoff spot in the final two rounds.\nHighlights from the regular season include Adelaide's Nick Ward tying the single-game hit record (6) on 14 December with Shuhei Fukuda, formerly of Brisbane. Tim Kennelly surpassed Trent D'Antonio's all-time games record of 395 on 15 December 2023 and became the first player to 400 games in Round 8.\nTrent Thomas, the league's most capped umpire became the first to surpass 300 games 19 November 2023.\nPostseason.\nThe postseason is scheduled to begin on Australia Day, 26 January 2024, with four teams making the playoffs. All postseason series will use a best-of-three format, with the first-placed Adelaide Giants hosting the fourth-placed Melbourne Aces and the second-placed Perth Heat hosting the third-placed Brisbane Bandits. The winners of the semi-finals will compete for the Claxton Shield, beginning on 2 February 2024."

        "text": "William Joseph Duplissea (born September 27, 1977) is an American baseball coach and former player who is the advance scouting/replay coordinator for the Kansas City Royals in Major League Baseball. He was previously the Royals' bullpen catcher and played baseball in the Los Angeles Dodgers' minor league system.\nCareer.\nDuplissea was born in San Carlos, California. He attended college and played baseball at the College of San Mateo and the University of California, Santa Barbara. At the latter, he was named as a conference All-Big West Baseball Team honorable mention in 1999. While still in college, Duplissea was drafted in the 39th round of the 1997 Major League Baseball draft by the Baltimore Orioles, but did not sign.\nAfter college, Duplissea signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers. He played in their minor league development system for five seasons beginning in 1999, reaching as high as Triple-A. He never broke into the major leagues and retired after playing in seven Double-A games in 2003.\nAfter leaving the minor leagues, Duplissea coached at the junior college level for about three years. In 2006, he became the bullpen catcher for the Kansas City Royals. The career move was offered to him by Bob McClure, his baseball coach at the College of San Mateo who had since become the Royals' pitching coach. He remained in the role until 2012, when he moved into advance scouting for the Royals.\nIn 2014, the Royals added to Duplissea's advance scouting duties by making him the team's replay coordinator. The move came after the introduction of managerial challenges to the sport. During games, Duplissea's role is to stay in the team clubhouse, watch the game's film in real time, and alert the Royals' coaching staff when an umpire's ruling could be overturned with a challenge. , Duplissea remains in both positions.\nReplay coordinator.\nDuplissea is best known for being highly skilled in the replay coordinator role. Between 2014 and 2022, the Royals successfully overturned calls on 65.7% of challenges, outranking every other team in baseball. In Duplissea's first season as replay coordinator, then-Royals manager Ned Yost commended Duplissea's work to the Associated Press. \"We got a real good video analyst\", he said. \"Very seldom does he ever make a mistake\".\n\"The Kansas City Star\" said Duplissea had \"the best eyes in baseball\" near the end of the 2017 season, at which time the Royals were statistically the most successful team at challenging calls (having been successful in 22 of their 30 attempts). They had also led the league in the same category in 2016. In 2018, \"The Athletic\" posited that Duplissea might be the most valuable member of the 2018 Royals team, ahead of any of the team's players. \"There is nobody in baseball better at looking at an instant replay and judging when to challenge an umpire's call\", reporter Rustin Dodd wrote."

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball career double plays as a pitcher leaders",
        "text": "In baseball statistics, a double play (denoted as DP) is the act of making two outs during the same continuous play. One double play is recorded for every defensive player who participates in the play, regardless of how many of the outs in which they were directly involved, and is counted in addition to whatever putouts and assists might also apply. Double plays can occur any time there is at least one baserunner and fewer than two outs. The pitcher is the player who pitches the baseball from the pitcher's mound toward the catcher to begin each play, with the goal of retiring a batter, who attempts to either make contact with the pitched ball or draw a walk. The pitcher is often considered the most important player on the defensive side of the game, playing the most difficult and specialized position, and as such is regarded as being at the right end of the defensive spectrum. Pitchers play far less than players at other positions, generally appearing in only two or three games per week; only one pitcher in major league history has appeared in 100 games in a single season. There are many different types of pitchers, generally divided between starting pitchers and relief pitchers, which include the middle reliever, lefty specialist, setup man, and closer. In the scoring system used to record defensive plays, the pitcher is assigned the number 1.\nPitchers typically record double plays by ground balls hit to the pitcher. Most of the time, these double plays will go 1-6-3 (pitcher to shortstop to first baseman), though sometimes these double plays will go pitcher 1-4-3 (pitcher to second baseman to first baseman).\nGreg Maddux is the all-time leader in career double plays by a pitcher with 98; he is the only pitcher to reach nearly 100 career double plays."

        "title": "1921–22 Princeton Tigers men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1921–22 Princeton Tigers men's ice hockey season was the 22nd season of play for the program. The Tigers were coached Moylan McDonnell in his 1st season.\nSeason.\nEntering the year, several changes were afoot for the Tigers. The program's first official head coach, Russell Ellis, left after just one season. In order to keep the team atop the college hockey landscape, the school turned to NHL veteran Moylan McDonnell, hoping he could get Princeton to keep pace with its conference foes. While they awaited the arrival of their new coach, the team began training under the supervision of team captain Eugene Maxwell. 34 men showed up for the initial practice, including several returning players, but the team would have to contend with the loss of three starters due to graduation.\nThe Intercollegiate Athletic Association met prior to the season and agreed to several rule changes. Chief among these was officially dispensing with 7-man hockey, a move that Harvard had been loathe to accept. Also, while player substitutions were only allowed during stoppages in play, the number of substitutions would be unlimited. Following the trend set by football teams, all players were now required to wear numbers on their uniform for identification. Additionally, all games would have three periods of 15 minutes each, weather permitting. In the event of a tie, two 5-minute periods would be used to try and settle the score. If the game was tied after the overtime session, the match would be called as a draw. All minor penalties would be 2 minutes in length while major offenses would be 4 minutes. While these rule changes would only affect league games, many other programs would utilize the same or similar framework.\nAs the team was preparing itself for the trip up to Lake Placid, the program received a major boon. An anonymous donor gave the university $100,000 to built the program's first artificial rink. Plans for the new building were put into motion right away and the school broke ground before the end of the month. While the rink would not be ready until the following year, Princeton would become just the second college in the country to have an on-campus home venue when the Hobey Baker Memorial Rink opened in 1923.\nBy the time McDonnell took over the team in mid-December, the Tigers' roster was mostly sorted out and he only had to make the final few cuts to decide who would be going on the Christmas trip. Upon their arrival, the team got to work and prepared for the first match of the year. They proved to be far superior than a local aggregation, pounding the Lake Placid Snowbirds 6–0, but the faced a tougher test from the Victoria Hockey Club. The Tigers held their own against the Canadians in the first match but they ran out of season the following evening and suffered their first loss of the year.\nThe team had little time to reflect on their trip as they faced their first intercollegiate opponent on January 6. Fortunately, the trip appeared to put the team in good standing and the Tigers brushed Penn away with a 4–0 victory. While Maxwell held the Quakers scoreless, Van Gerbig scored all four goals for the Tigers, providing the best singular performance for the Tigers in years. The next game with Columbia was delayed for a week and caused their next match to be played against Yale. Unfortunately, the team was bitten by the injury bug heading into the contest. Already missing Merritt, who was injured at Lake Placid, the team lost one of their defensive starters, Wall. Burnham, who had taken Merritt's place on the wing, was shifted back to defense while Jackson, Jewett and Powers were given practice time on the wing. Merritt and Wall were both able to play in the game but were limited in play. Jackson ended up subbing in for both during the match. Once the game began, Corcoran took over on offense, giving Princeton a 2-goal lead early in the second. Unfortunately, Yale refused to lay down and fought back to tie the game in the third to force overtime. Burnham gave Princeton their second lead early in the first 5-minute period but the Elis tied the game almost immediately. Near the end of the second overtime the puck found its way behind Maxwell and sunk the hopes of the Tigers.\nAfter playing such a strong game against Yale, Princeton was expected to have a fairly easy match against Columbia. The Lions had other ideas and used both clever teamwork and a distinct home ice advantage to hand the Tigers their third loss. Van Gerbig was shifted to defense due to Wall's lingering injury but the forward line was well regarded as Merritt, Jackson and Corcoran each scored in the game. The game went into overtime and Columbia got into the lead after just 15 seconds. Despite having nearly 10 minutes to tie the score, Princeton was unable to find the twine in either extra session. The end of the week saw Princeton take on Harvard in Philadelphia and put forth a much better performance against the vaunted Crimson. Maxwell made several outstanding saves in the contest and held the Bostonians back for the first 25 minutes of the match. Harvard's defense, however, was even stronger and prevented the Tigers from scoring a single goal.\nWith losses now to both conference teams, Princeton could ill afford any more defeats. Sadler was added to the lineup, sliding in at wing which allowed Merritt to drop back to defense. The moves appeared to work and Princeton won the game despite a rather slow pace of play. The remade defense continued to show out in the rematch with Yale, however, the offense was weakened in the effort. Neither team was able to score except for a fluke play in the middle of the second period; when Maxwell reached up to stop a long shot, the puck deflected off of his glove, hit the crossbar and bounced to the ice just inside the goal. While the result demonstrated that there was little to separate either squad, Yale had finished atop in both contests and rendered it nearly impossible for Princeton to claim any success on the season. The season ended with a lackluster performance against Harvard that saw the Crimson run away with the game in the second half. The addition of Norrie at center did nothing to help the Princeton offense who were shutout for the fourth time that season.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

Paddlers complete up to two runs in the heats, with the top ranked athletes starting last. In the first heat, the 30 fastest paddlers qualify automatically for the semifinal, whilst the rest compete in the second heat for additional 10 qualification spots. The final rank of non-qualifying athletes is determined by their second run score. Paddlers start in the reverse order of their heats position in the semifinal and complete a single run, with the top 10 advancing to the final. The start list for the final is once again in reverse order of the semifinal results. The athlete with the best time in the single-run final is awarded gold.\nA penalty of 2 seconds is awarded for touching a gate and a 50-second penalty is awarded for missing a gate or negotiating it in the opposite direction.\nThe heats setup had 23 gates including 6 upstream gates (3-11-12-15-19-23). The semifinal and final gate setup also had 23 gates with 6 upstream gates (3-11-12-15-19-23), but in a more difficult configuration, causing slower times.\nSchedule.\n\"All times listed are UTC+1.\"\nResults.\nBritish paddler Joseph Clarke was the last man to start after winning the semifinal and he managed to back up his semifinal run with another clean and fast run to win gold ahead of the Czech paddler Jiří Prskavec and Mathis Soudi from Morocco.

The Taliban rejected Afghanistan's entire participation with women athletes in the games at all.\nAfghanistan still competed under the old Islamic Republic tricolor flag, instead of the white banner preferred by the Taliban.

        "title": "French Equestrian Federation",
        "text": "The French Equestrian Federation (FFE) (French: \"Fédération française d'équitation\") is a non-profit organization responsible for the management, promotion and development of equestrian disciplines in France. It also contributes to the selection of sport and leisure horses.\nThe FFE is a member of the International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI by its acronym in French) and the French National Olympic and Sports Committee (CNOSF by its acronym in French).\nIn 2017, the FFE had 644,800 members. It is France's third-largest (single-sport) sports federation in terms of the number of members, the fourth-largest in terms of the total number of federation memberships, and the second-largest equestrian federation in the world. Women account for 83% of the FFE's membership, and 27% are under ten years of age. One of the federation's challenges is to encourage young people growing up to continue riding. Between 1984 and 2011, the number of FFE members rose by 374%.\nHistory.\nGeneral.\nThe French Equestrian Federation was founded in 1921. In 1963, an \"Association nationale pour le tourisme équestre\" (ANTE) was created with the support of the Haras nationaux, and grew thanks to the new popular craze for leisure riding. In 1971, the Poney Club de France appeared, thanks to the renewed support of the Haras nationaux, reaping the rewards of the penetration of pony riding among children.\nThus, until 1987, the French horse world was divided into three independent entities, before the French Equestrian Federation was created that year, unifying and grouping the entities. Delegations were nevertheless set up: the \"Délégation nationale aux sports équestres\" (DNSE); the \"Délégation nationale au tourisme équestre\" (DNTE); and the \"Délégation nationale à l'équitation sur Poneys\" (DNEP).\nIn 1999, the FFE's statutes changed, and the delegations were dissolved, although the specialties were still represented on the Steering Committee, which comprised a Horse Committee, a Pony Committee, a Tourism Committee and a Competition College.\nSports modernization Act in 2000.\nThe Sports Modernization Act of 2000 led to the creation of new statutes. These, creating the CREIF (\"Comité Régional d'Equitation d'Ile de France\" by its extension in French), were approved by the equestrian centers with 94.24% of the votes cast. The former independent bodies : \"Comité régional de tourisme équestre\", \"Délégation régionale à l'équitation sur poney\" (DREP) and \"Ligue régionale des sports équestres\" were grouped together under the CREIF umbrella, thus guaranteeing the continuity of their specificity. The CREIF inherited the \"Ligues de Fontainebleau\", Versailles, ARTE and DREP Île-de-France through a merger-absorption process. This administrative restructuring is in line with regional state administrations and political bodies.\nThe CREIF now heads 8 departments: Paris, Seine-et-Marne, Yvelines, Essonne, Hauts-de-Seine, Seine-Saint-Denis, Val-de-Marne and Val-d'Oise, representing more than 600 equestrian associations and establishments affiliated to the FFE and more than 100,000 licensees, its mission is to encourage, promote, develop and organize equestrian activities in all forms and practices.\nThe CREIF is one of the FFE's 23 deconcentrated bodies, following the law on the modernization of sport.\n\"Lamour\" law 2005-2006.\nBy order dated 2 and 3 2005, the FFE lost its approval and delegation from the French Ministry of Youth, Sports and the Voluntary Sector. The Federation is accused of failing to bring its statutes into line with the so-called \"Lamour\" law no. 2003-708 of 1 August 2003. The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries also withdrew its approval by order dated 6 October 2005.\nThe main reason why the FFE has not updated its statutes is that the Lamour law de facto imposes an under-representation in voting rights of commercial equestrian clubs, which represent the majority in number, to the benefit of non-commercial structures.\nIn 2004, Serge Lecomte's re-election as FFE president led to legal proceedings initiated by the unsuccessful candidate, Jacqueline Reverdy. The FFE was placed under judicial administration, entrusted to Monique Legrand, following the annulment of Serge Lecomte's election by the Paris Tribunal de Grande Instance.\nTo ensure continuity of public service, the French National Olympic and Sports Committee (CNOSF by its acronym in French) temporarily exercises the prerogatives lost by the FFE following the withdrawal of its approval and delegation. In particular, it has authority over the organization of competitions and high-level sport. A specialized Equestrian Commission has been set up. Various agreements between the FFE and the CNOSF enable activities to run smoothly, particularly for competitions and top-level sport.\nThe FFE's new statutes were adopted at the Extraordinary General Meeting on 19 June 2006, raising hopes of normalized relations between the French government and the FFE. As a result, in September 2006, the FFE was once again approved by the public authorities.\nIn a decree dated December 21, 2006, the Minister for Youth, Sports and the Voluntary Sector once again granted the FFE the delegation provided for in article 131-14 of the French Sports Code, thus putting an end to several years of conflict between the association and the public authorities.\nIn 2008, the FFE's statutes underwent further changes. The head office was moved from Boulogne-Billancourt to the Federal Equestrian Park de Lamotte-Beuvron.\nList of presidents.\nSince its creation in 1921, the Federation has been headed by the following personalities:"

        "text": "The 2023 NCAA Bowling Championship was the 19th edition of the NCAA Bowling Championship, the annual tournament to determine the national champion of women's NCAA collegiate ten-pin bowling. The finals were hosted by UNLV and played at the South Point Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada from April 14–15, 2023. The championship game was streamed live on ESPNU. Vanderbilt beat Arkansas State in the championship game to win their third title.\nFormat.\nThe 2023 championship featured a 17-team format, with 4 regionals. Each regional consisted of four teams, except for the Arlington regional which had five with a play-in match between Fayetteville State and Prairie View. Each regional had one winner who would go on to play in a four-team tournament for the national championship. The 2023 pre-determined regional locations were as follows:\nEach regional was played as a double-elimination tournament, except for the one play-in match. All regional matches, except for what the NCAA calls \"if necessary regional finals\", were best-of-three matches bowled in the following order: five-person team, Baker total pinfall, Baker best-of-seven match play. Any \"if necessary regional final\" was Baker best-of-seven. Regional winners advanced to the championship event, which was also double-elimination. All matches were bowled under the standard format for regionals (best-of-three matches using specified formats in a specific order) except the championship final, which was Baker best-of-seven.\nQualification.\nSince there is only one national collegiate championship for women's bowling, all NCAA bowling programs (whether from Division I, Division II, or Division III) were eligible. A total of 17 teams competed in the double-elimination tournament, with nine conference champions receiving automatic bids and eight teams receiving at-large bids. The teams were revealed in a selection show on March 29, 2023.\nBids.\nThere were 17 teams selected to the tournament - nine were selected automatically as conference champions, while another eight were selected at-large. The top four teams in the tournament were seeded and assigned to separate regions; they were the only teams seeded for this tournament.\nThe Southland Bowling League (SBL) had the most bids of any conference with six, while the Northeast Conference (NEC) and Great Lakes Valley Conference (GLVC) had two. The Allegheny Mountain Collegiate Conference (AMCC), Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association (CIAA), College Conference of Illinois and Wisconsin (CCIW), East Coast Conference (ECC), Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC), and Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC) sent only their conference tournament champions. Additionally, one independent team received an at-large bid to the tournament.\nTournament bracket.\nAll regions were double-elimination, except for the finals, which was double-elimination before a single Baker best-of-7 championship match."

Earlier the event was scheduled to held in September 2022 but due to COVID-19 pandemic cases rising in China the event was postponed and rescheduled to September–October 2023. The nation's football opener marked their return to international sport.\nNorth Korea was under sanctions by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) since 2021 due to its national anti-doping body's non-compliance with WADA standards. As a consequence, supposedly North Korea was bared from using it flags in international sports competition except the Olympics and Paralympics but the Olympic Council of Asia allowed the country to use its flag in the Asian Games.\nFootball.\nSummary"

        "text": "The women's kayak cross event at the 2023 ICF Canoe Slalom World Championships took place on 24 September 2023 at the Lee Valley White Water Centre in London.\nCompetition format.\nThe kayak cross event (formerly known as extreme kayak) is split into two phases - qualification time trials and knockout phase where 4 paddlers race each other head-to-head. Top 20 paddlers from the qualification advance to the knockout phase plus the 12 next fastest paddlers from countries that have not qualified in the top 20. There are 8 heats in the first round of the knockout phase with the top 2 paddlers from each heat advancing to the next round. The same rules apply in quarterfinals and semifinals.\nPaddlers start their run by sliding off the starting platform several meters above the water. Then they must navigate the downstream and upstream gates. Unlike in classic slalom, paddlers are allowed to touch the gates and even intentionally move them with their paddle, but not with a free hand. There is also a designated zone where paddlers must perform an Eskimo roll.\nAthletes can be penalized in three ways in each round, by receiving a fault (FLT) or by being ranked as lower (RAL). Faults are incurred for false starts, missing gates or failing to correctly perform the Eskimo roll. Athletes are ranked as lower (RAL) if they breach the safety requirements of the competition, such as by holding back another athlete with their hands or paddle, deliberately paddling over another athlete's boat, or by making dangerous contact with another athlete's head or body - all other non-dangerous contact is allowed. In each round athletes are ranked first by the order in which they cross the finish line, with those incurring penalties ranked in the following order: FLT, RAL, DNF, .\nThe final classification of athletes is determined in the following manner: Athletes eliminated at any phase of the competition will be given their rank based on the comparison of the qualification times of athletes eliminated at the same phase. All 3rd ranked athletes will be ranked above all 4th ranked athletes. The final rank of athletes who did not progress to the heats is determined by their qualification results.\nSchedule.\n\"All times listed are UTC+1.\"\nResults.\nTime trials.\nTop 20 qualify automatically. The last 12 spots go to fastest paddlers from countries not yet qualified.\nKnockout rounds.\nTop 2 from each heat, quarterfinal and semifinal advance to the next round.\nFinal ranking (Top 32).\nThe top 32 ranking determined by the knockout rounds. Bib numbers correspond to seeding after time trials."

        "text": "The 1921–22 Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's ice hockey season was the 5th season of play for the program. The team was coached by Paul Castner in his 3rd season.\nSeason.\nWith several other colleges founding ice hockey teams in 1921, Notre Dame was able to finally realize the goal they had set out to achieve in 1911. The Irish used the rink they had built next to Badin Hall to get the team ready for the season and opened with a pair of games in mid-January. The Irish travelled north and took on a strong Michigan squad. After the Wolverines opened the scoring, Paul Castner tied the game early in the second. The coach then assisted on team captain Spike Flinn's goal that knotted the score for a second time. The Notre Dame defense then firmed up and stopped any further scores, necessitating overtime to settle the account. Castner's second marker was the only goal of the extra session and gave the Irish the win. The following evening, the team had a slightly easier time against the Aggies. Soft ice kept the score low but couldn't stop ND from returning home with a pair of wins to their credit.\nFor the team's first home game of the year, they took on Culver Academies and completely lambasted the Cadets. The forward line effortlessly skated through the Culver defense and four players combined for 9 goals in the first half. The large crowd roared in approval when the Irish continued the assault by scoring 9 more goals in the second to produce the largest win in program history. The team was still riding high when they welcomed the Michigan Aggies for a return match and banished the greens with an 11–0 win. The team continued its undefeated streak going when they travelled up to face Michigan College of Mines for a pair of matches. The first game was a fairly easy win for the Irish with Castner's hat-trick leading the way. MCM pushed back in the second and the Notre Dame defense was once more called upon to save the day and give McSorley enough time to net he overtime winner.\nNotre Dame suffered its first loss of the year when the Canadian Club of Chicago arrived in town. Before the largest audience of the season, a warm spell had softened the ice and turned the game into more of a shinny match. Several times the visitors resorted to using golf shots to move the puck and ended up slapping the puck into the Notre Dame cage four times in this manner. The warm spell also caused the return game with Michigan to be postponed but it was eventually played a week later when the weather was more accommodating. With the Irish still undefeated against intercollegiate opponents, they were all but guaranteed the title if they could overcome the Wolverines a second time. The visitors sought to avenge their earlier loss and both teams battled hard on both ends of the ice. Wilcox and Caster raced up and down the ice and had the Irish in the lead late in the third period. However, Michigan would not go away and tied the score with just minutes to play, forcing the two into overtime once more. The rough ice did nothing to stop the Irish in the extra session and Caster scored twice to give his team a commanding lead. McSorley added one final goal before time was called and sent the Wolverines packing.\nA rain storm was in attendance for the next game and turned the match with Wisconsin into a slushy quagmire. The poor conditions depressed the score but two more goals from Caster ultimately led the Irish to victory. The win ended Notre Dame intercollegiate schedule for the year and left the Irish as kings among the western schools.\nOver a month later, the team headed to Milwaukee for two games against a local amateur club. The Irish didn't fare well in the series but the team had hardly been able to practice ahead of the matches, what with the Badin Rink having been long ago disassembled for the spring. The results did little to dent the season for Notre Dame as the team was still able to claim the first championship for western intercollegiate ice hockey.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "title": "Big Store Rugby League Club",
        "text": "The Big Store Rugby League Club was a rugby league club which existed briefly in 1918 and competed in the Auckland Rugby League 5th grade competition. They were based in central Auckland, New Zealand and were made up of employees of the George Court &amp; Sons Department Store.\nHistory.\n1918 Entry into Auckland Rugby League.\nOn April 17, 1918 the Big Store Football Club nominated a single team to play in the Auckland Rugby League 5th grade competition. The league accepted their nomination and also approved of their club colours which would be blue and white. The side was named after the George Court &amp; Sons Department Store on Karangahape Road. The department store’s motto was the “Big Store” due to its “extensive range of goods rather than its actual physical size”. Later in the mid 1920s it was enlarged further and that building still remains on the corner of Karangahape Road and Mercury Lane. In 1988 the store closed and in 1993 it was converted into an apartment building and opened in 1993.\nMatches.\nOn May 4 Big Store played a practice match with North Shore Albions at Devonport Domain in Devonport at 3pm, with Mr. Aughton refereeing. They lost 6-0 with Emerali and Davies scoring for their opponents.\nThe season draw was then published with the Big Store in a competition involving 11 sides from Ōtāhuhu Rovers, City Rovers, Richmond Rovers]], Ponsonby United (2), Northcote &amp; Birkenhead Ramblers, North Shore Albions, Manukau Rovers (2), and Telegraph Messengers.\nThey played another practice match against City before their first official competition match against Northcote &amp; Birkenhead Ramblers on May 25 at Victoria Park with Mr. Sherrick the referee. The Big Store’s first ever team named to play was McVeigh, McCready, McIntyre, Newdick, Walker, Smith, Cowley, Montague, Armstrong, Potters, Judge, Beresford, Pringle, Billman. As was the case with many matches from this era the result was not reported, with just 23 reported in the Auckland Star and New Zealand Herald out of 57 played. The Big Store side only had 3 of their 9 matches reported. Their next match was against Telegraph Messengers on June 1 before games with Manukau A (June 8), North Shore (June 29), and Ponsonby B on July 6. On July 20 their match with Ponsonby A did have the score reported with Big Store losing 6-0 at the Auckland Domain.\nOn July 27 they played Manukau B at Manukau with no score reported. Then in the following round they were well beaten by Richmond Rovers 27-0 at Grey Lynn Park in Grey Lynn.\nAffiliation with City Rovers and then Newton Rangers.\nIn mid season on June 5 Big Store wrote to the league requesting affiliation with the Newton Rangers club. However they had already been granted affiliation with the City Rovers club. The league decided that they would defer their decision until the next meeting on June 12 and in the meantime write to the City and Big Store clubs to gain further information. Both the City and Newton clubs were foundation clubs of the Auckland Rugby League having formed in 1909. At the following meeting the league received City’s response that they had no objection to the Big Store affiliating with Newton. Therefore the league granted the affiliation. The only reported condition was that any City registered players who were playing for Big Store would need to revert back to the City club at the end of the season and not remain with the Big Store side/Newton club.\nSuspension from competition.\nOn August 8 two players were registered to the league to the Big Store club. They were G. Boyle and W. Williamson. Days later they were to play their final ever match due to a mass suspension. Big Store played against Ōtāhuhu at Ōtāhuhu on August 10. Ōtāhuhu won the game 16 points to 0. Following the match the August 14 meeting of the Auckland Rugby League disqualified all members of the Big Store 5th grade team “until the end of season 1919, and Cowley (the captain) was suspended for three years”. There is no record of the club every playing again as a separate entity. It is likely that any registered players remaining returned to play when their suspensions ended for either the City or Newton clubs in the 1920 season. Whilst it was not reported if they ever won a match or scored points it is likely as the 3 teams that they were defeated by finished in the top 4 with their other matches against sides mid table or struggling like Big Store.\nTeam record.\nBig Store completed 9 of their scheduled 12 fixtures prior to their suspension. Only 3 of their 9 games had scores reported."

        "text": "The Maharlika Pilipinas Volleyball Association (MPVA) is a women's developmental volleyball league in the Philippines consisting of 11 teams.\nThe MPVA was founded in 2023 by eight-division world champion Manny Pacquiao, who also founded the similarly-named Maharlika Pilipinas Basketball League (MPBL) in 2017. Similar to its basketball counterpart, it is meant to be a grassroots league with a focus on showcasing local, homegrown talents.\nThe Bacoor City Strikers are the current defending champions, after defeating the Negros–ICC Blue Hawks in the Finals of the 2023 MPVA season.\nHistory.\nBackground and launch.\nOn August 29, 2017, Manny Pacquiao founded the Maharlika Pilipinas Basketball League, a semi-professional basketball league that uses a home-and-away system with a focus on showcasing local talents. By 2023, the league was promoted to a professional league and has run for five seasons. On June 15, 2023, in a press conference unveiling the Junior MPBL, Pacquiao shared his intent to create a home-and-away volleyball league similar to the MPBL that will cater to women athletes.\nOn September 15, 2023, Pacquiao formally launched the MPVA in a press conference with commissioner Michael Tavera. Announced in the press conference was a list of ten teams that were set to compete in the inaugural season, with all but one of them having a set locality. The league's future plans include a men's division in 2024 as well as its own junior's division. One month later, in another press conference, the lineup was decreased to eight teams, with three teams deferring and one team joining.\nFirst season.\nThe MPVA's inaugural season will begin on October 22, 2023 at Ynares Center in Antipolo, Rizal with the opening ceremonies followed by a doubleheader of matches.\nTeams.\nIn its first season, the MPVA consisted of 8 teams. The league is expected to expand to at least 11 teams in 2024.\nTeams are usually owned and/or back by their respective local governments and team sponsors. Team names can change as a result of managerial and/or sponsorship changes. Some teams share its name with their respective basketball counterparts in the MPBL.\nRoster regulations.\nThe league has a set of roster regulations, putting restrictions on which and how many players each team can place onto its roster. As of 2023, the roster regulations are as follows:\nFormat.\nElimination round.\nThe elimination round is divided into two stages. The first stage utilizes the traditional round-robin format, where teams play one game against all other teams in the league. After the round-robin stage, the teams are divided into groups that then proceed to play in the group stage, where teams play another game against all teams that are in the same group.\nPlayoffs.\nAfter the elimination round, the top eight teams advance to a three-round, single-elimination playoff bracket. In the first round, the Quarterfinals, the top four teams are given a twice-to-beat advantage over their opponents. The next two rounds, the Semifinals and Finals, are both best-of-three series. The playoffs also include a Bronze Medal Match, which is also best-of-three.\nMedia.\nFor the inaugural season, all games aired on Media Pilipinas TV (MPTV) and One PH on television. The games are also streamed on Plus Network, which also broadcasts the Shakey's Super League, as well as on the MPVA's official Facebook page."

Thomas had served as interim head coach for the final few weeks of the 2022–23 season with head coach Chris Mooney on leave due to heart surgery.\nUnder a new NCAA rule permitting two additional staff members to be designated as assistant coaches without being able to participate in off-campus recruiting, Mark McGonigal and Jack Fahed were elevated from their previous staff roles in September 2023.\nPreseason.\nIn a preseason poll of league head coaches and select media members, Richmond was chosen to finish 11th out of 15 teams in the Atlantic 10 Conference in 2023–24. Neal Quinn was selected to the Preseason All-Conference Third Team. \nSchedule and results.\nRichmond announced a 13-game non-conference schedule on August 25, 2023, followed by its 18-game Atlantic 10 schedule on September 6, 2023.

The Badgers represent the University of Wisconsin–Madison and were coached by A. K. Viner in his 1st season.\nSeason.\nAfter having previously fielded a club team, the school's athletic council agreed to promote the ice hockey team to 'minor' varsity status in 1921. Dr. A. K. Viner was brought in to lead the inaugural team and practice began on the new ice rink which was constructed on the lower campus by flooding one of the athletic fields.\nThe team was able to arrange a slate of eight games and had their work cut out for them. The strong competition began at the season's outset when they played host to the Milwaukee Athletic Club. In front of a large crowd for the first game, the Badgers fell to the amateur club but the defense performed admirably after some early jitters. Minnesota arrived the following weekend and the defense remained in fine form, holding the Gophers to 3 goals in each game. Unfortunately, the Wisconsin offense had yet to appear and could only muster a single goal in the two matches.\nAfter a week off, the team travelled north to play its first road games in a return series with Minnesota. This time, the northerners made sure to leave no doubt as to who were the better squad by hammering the Badgers in both games. Minnesota scored 19 goals in the two games to just 2 from Wisconsin and swept the first ever season series between the two Big Ten teams.\nWisconsin returned home and awaited their first series with Michigan, who had yet to officially recognize their team. While the games weren't official, they still resulted in another two losses for Wisconsin. One silver lining for the Badgers was that their offense finally seemed like it was beginning to work together. The final game of the year came against the yet-undefeated Notre Dame squad and the Irish kept their streak alive with a shutout victory over the Badgers.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

The Huskies were coached by Mike Fay in his 1st season.\nSeason.\nFor the first time in its history, the MCM hockey team was able to play a majority of college teams. This was primarily due to the inception of several other mid-west programs in 1921. The Huskies, however, began the year playing Michigan, who had yet to formally adopt the sport. During a three-day stay in Ann Arbor, MCM won the series 2–1 and looked like they could pose a challenge to Notre Dame. They played host to the Irish at the end of the month and, though they pushed the second game into overtime, fell in consecutive matches to the golden domers.\nAfter a two-week break, the team welcomed Minnesota to Houghton. The two fought to a 3–3 draw in the first game while the Huskies took the rematch the following evening. A return game was played when MCM took a trip to Minneapolis the following week and the Michiganders confirmed the earlier results with a second win. The Huskies remained hot in their stay, defeating an amateur club from Fort Snelling and then downing St. Thomas before returning home.\nMCM finished off the year with another pair of games against the Tommies. St. Thomas came close both times but the Huskies were able to win twice and finish the year out with a 6-game winning streak.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "text": "The 2023 UK Championship (officially the 2023 MrQ UK Championship) was a professional snooker tournament that took place from 25November to 3December 2023 at the York Barbican in York, England. The 47th edition of the UK Championship, first held in 1977, it was the eighth ranking event of the 2023–24 snooker season, following the International Championship and preceding the Snooker Shoot Out. It was also the season's first Triple Crown event, preceding the Masters and the World Championship. Organised by the World Snooker Tour and sponsored by online casino MrQ, the event was broadcast by the BBC domestically, by Discovery+ and Eurosport in Europe, and by other broadcasters worldwide. The winner received £250,000 from a total prize fund of £1,205,000.\nThe event featured the top 16 players in the world rankings along with 16 qualifiers who came through a 128-player four-round qualifying tournament held from 18 to 23November at the Morningside Arena in Leicester. Mark Allen was the defending champion, having defeated Ding Junhui 107 in the final of the 2022 event, but he lost 56 to Ding in the first round. After becoming the first player to win 100 matches at the tournament when he defeated Zhou Yuelong in the quarter-finals, Ronnie O'Sullivan progressed to the final, where he defeated Ding 107 to win a record-extending eighth UK Championship, his 22nd Triple Crown title and 40th ranking title. Aged 47 years and 363 days, he became the oldest winner in the tournament's history, surpassing Doug Mountjoy, who had been 46 years and 172 days old when he won the title at the 1988 event. O'Sullivan also holds the record as the tournament's youngest winner—set 30 years earlier at the 1993 event—which gives him the distinction of simultaneously being the youngest and oldest UK Champion. \nThe main stage of the tournament produced a total of 63 century breaks, with a further 80 centuries made during qualifying. The highest was a maximum break by Xu Si in his second-round qualifying match against Ma Hailong. Judd Trump made his 950th century break in professional competition and recorded his 1,000th professional victory during the event. Ding and Mark Williams scored a record total of 195 points in frame eight of their quarter-final match, breaking the previous professional record of 192 points set by Peter Lines and Dominic Dale during the 2012 Wuxi Classic qualifiers.\nFormat.\nThe 2023 UK Championship was a professional snooker tournament that took place from 25November to 3December at the York Barbican in York, England. The eighth ranking event and first Triple Crown tournament of the 2023–24 snooker season, the tournament was the 47th edition of the UK Championship, which was first held in 1977 as the United Kingdom Professional Snooker Championship. For the tournament's first seven years, only United Kingdom residents or passport holders were eligible to compete.

It just does crazy things to your brain.\"\nTournament format.\nThe tournament was played using a variation of the traditional snooker rules. The draw was randomised before each round. All matches were played over a single , each of which lasts up to 10 minutes. The event featured a variable shot clock; shots played in the first five minutes are allowed 15 seconds while the final five has a 10-second timer. All award the opponent a .
