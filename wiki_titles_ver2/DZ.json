        "title": "Baseball in South Korea",
        "text": "Baseball is believed to have been introduced to Korea in 1905 by American missionaries during the Korean Empire, after which it gradually attained prominence. After the division of the Korean Peninsula into North Korea and South Korea in 1945 and the further destabilisation of the Korean War from 1950–53, baseball has become one of the most popular sports in South Korea. North Korea, under isolationist leadership, does not have the same level of investment in baseball as South Korea. There are 10 professional teams in South Korea's KBO League. Baseball season runs from March to October.\nHistory.\nBefore the Korean war.\nAmerican missionaries brought baseball to Korea in the 19th century. In 1896, U.S. Marines played exhibitions against teams of Americans expatriates and the Seoul Athletic Club. The sport flourished in the period of Japanese rule, though ethnic Koreans faced playing restrictions, as baseball was seen as a potential tool of Korean nationalism. During the Japanese occupation, Korean players were only allowed to play in tournaments sponsored by Japanese companies.\nIn December 1921, a team of American Major League players stopped in Seoul during a tour of Asia, and a Korean team was assembled to play against them. The Koreans were defeated, 23-3. Various Korean cities also participated in the Japanese intercity baseball tournament, from its inception in 1927 until 1942. In 1940 and 1942 Seoul won the tournament, defeating (respectively) the teams of Dalian and Osaka. At least one Korean played against a Babe Ruth-led team of American MLB all-stars which toured Japan in 1934.\nPost-war period.\nThe 1980s marked the beginning of the professional baseball era in South Korea. In 1982, the MBC Chungyong, Lotte Giants, Samsung Lions, OB Bears, Haitai Tigers, and Sammi Superstars were launched, as was the highest-level league that they composed, the Korea Baseball Championship. This league continues to be South Korea's major league, and has expanded to 10 teams.\nThe sport reached a new level of popularity when pitcher Chan Ho Park made his debut for the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1994. Park achieved a great deal of success in his Major League Baseball career, and paved the way for the American success of fellow South Korean players such as Hee-seop Choi, Byung-hyun Kim, Bong Jung-keun, Shin-Soo Choo, Hyun-jin Ryu, Jung-ho Kang, and Ha-seong Kim.\nIt is also played widely on the local high school and collegiate level, as well as in a farm league (the Korea Baseball Futures League).\nBaseball's South Korean governing body is the Korea Baseball Organization, a member of the International Baseball Federation and the organization responsible for the nation's participation in such international competitions such as the Olympics, World Baseball Classic and the Asian Games. The KBO also manages Korea's national team. \nSouth Korea rose to prominence on the international baseball scene in the mid-2000s, finishing second in the 2009 World Baseball Classic to its arch-rival Japan. The team won the bronze medal at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, and the gold medal against Cuba at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. At the end of the 2023 World Baseball Classic, South Korea ranked fifth in the WBSC World Rankings.\nIn March 2024, two regular-season Major League Baseball (MLB) games were played in Seoul, between the Los Angeles Dodger and San Diego Padres; each team won one game."

At the time of its discontinuing being an active league, it was the largest known single-sport conference in the United States. The NECVA was a leading Division III men's volleyball conference, which comprised 43 universities and colleges stretching from New Hampshire to Virginia in its final season.\nThe NECVA folded in 2011, after the NCAA announced it would begin organizing a Division III national championship in 2012.\nHistory.\nFounded in 1995 as the Metro Conference, it became known as the NECVA in 1998. Albertus Magnus College, Daniel Webster College, Emerson College and St. Joseph's College (Brooklyn) joined the conference for the 2009 campaign. Elmira College and Penn State Behrend joined the conference in the 2010–11 season as members of the newly formed United Volleyball Conference.\nThe league was divided into five smaller divisions: CUNYAC (8), GNAC (7), Metro (10), New England (8), and Western (9) with one associate member. Each week, schools from the five divisions nominated athletes and then voted for the divisional Player and Rookie of the Week awards. The conference sports information office then selected the NECVA Player and Rookie honors from each of these five divisional winners.\nThe NECVA held an annual 16-team conference tournament called the \"NECVA Championship Tournament\" each April with the top two schools in each division and six at-large selections earning berths. The NECVA champion received an automatic bid to the Molten Division III Men's Invitational Volleyball Championship Tournament in April."

The club competes domestically in the Basketball Bundesliga (BBL) and internationally in the EuroLeague.\nThe team plays its home games at BMW Park, which was opened in 1972.\nFC Bayern Munich Basketball also has a reserve team that plays in German third-tier level ProB.\nHistory.\nBayern Munich has a long basketball tradition. Besides its most successful years in the 1950s and 1960s (German Championships in 1954, 1955, and German Cup in 1968), the club enjoyed remarkable popularity in 1956, when it even drew 40,000 fans to an open-air test game against Lancia Bolzano, once a top basketball club from Italy. Later, in 1966, the club was a founding member of the Basketball Bundesliga.\nIn the following years, the club slowly, but surely, faded into obscurity, and in 1974, was even relegated to the German 2nd Division. For a long time after that, the club never completely recovered, and only had a few successful years (Bayern moved up to the Basketball Bundesliga in 1987, and stayed there until 1989).\nIn 2008, the declared goal of the team was to return to the club's former glory, and return to the top German League, which it eventually did. In the near future, the club seeks to become a major force in European basketball, so that Bayern Munich will not only be well known for its football (soccer) operations, but also for its basketball operations as well. In the 2012–13 season the club reached the semifinals, where it lost 3–2 against the reigning champions Brose Baskets.\nThanks to a wild card, Bayern Munich played in the EuroLeague in the 2013–14 season. This was its first appearance in the top European championship, and it reached the Top 16 stage. On 18 June 2014, Bayern won its third national title when it beat Alba Berlin 3–1 in the Finals. It was the first title for the team since 1955; 59 years before. Star player of the team was Malcolm Delaney, who won both the MVP and Finals MVP.\nIn the 2014–15 season, Bayern failed to win a title. In the BBL Finals they were defeated by Brose Baskets, 3–2. The team had to wait until 2018 for its next championship, as they beat Alba Berlin 3–2 in the Finals that year. By winning the BBL, Bayern also qualified for the following EuroLeague season.\nHome arena.\nThe team's home arena is called BMW Park, which seats 6,700 spectators.\nNew arena.\nSAP Garden is a planned 12,500-seat indoor arena, to be built in Olympiapark, Munich.

Their head coach was Pete Carril, and the team captain was Kit Mueller. The team played its home games in the Jadwin Gymnasium on the university campus in Princeton, New Jersey. The team was the undefeated champion of the Ivy League, which earned them an automatic invitation to the 64-team 1991 NCAA tournament, where they were seeded eighth in the East Region.\nIn December, undefeated Princeton handed Rutgers their first loss. The team posted a 24–3 overall record and a 14–0 conference record using the Princeton offense. When the team beat 55–27 on January 11, 1991, it established a new National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I record for fewest points allowed (since 1986), breaking its own record set the prior year. The record would last until March 2, 1992. On February 8, 1991, against , Sean Jackson made all five of his three-point field goal attempts, which tied the Ivy League single-game record for most made without a miss set three years earlier by Princeton Tigers Dave Orlandini and Bob Scrabis. These stood as unsurpassed as the Ivy League record until future Princeton Tigers head coach Sydney Johnson made all six for Princeton on February 28, 1997. In a March 15, 1991 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament East Regional first-round game at the Carrier Dome in Syracuse, New York, against the Villanova Wildcats, they lost by a 50–48 margin. The Tigers led 30–25 at halftime, but lost on a shot in the final second of regulation play. Princeton's number eight seed was a record for the highest seed by an Ivy League school at the time. During the undefeated conference game season, Jackson established the Ivy League single-season conference games record with 56 three-point field goals made, which stood at least 25 seasons.\nDuring the season, the team spent six weeks (one week in mid December and the final five weeks of the season) of the seventeen-week season ranked in the Associated Press Top Twenty-five Poll, peaking at number eighteen where it ended the season. The team finished the season ranked twentieth in the final UPI Coaches' Poll. The team completed the first undefeated Ivy season by any team since the 1975–76 Princeton Tigers men's basketball team.\nThe team was led by first team All-Ivy League selections Jackson and Mueller, who repeated as the Ivy League Men's Basketball Player of the Year while earning first team Academic All-America recognition from College Sports Information Directors of America. Mueller shot 62.5% on his field goals to earn the third of three Ivy League statistical championships for field goal percentage. Jackson led the Ivy League in three point shooting percentage in conference games with a 55.4% average and established the Ivy League single-season record for conference games with 56 made. The team won the third of twelve consecutive national statistical championships in scoring defense with a 48.9 points allowed average.\nSchedule and results.\nThe team posted a 24–3 (14–0 Ivy League) record.\n!colspan=9 style=| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=| NCAA tournament\nNCAA tournament.\nThe team was seeded eighth in the 1991 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament.\nNCAA Tournament"

The team played its home games in the Jadwin Gymnasium on the university campus in Princeton, New Jersey. It was the undefeated Ivy League and earned birth in the 32-team 1976 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament.\nThe team posted a 22–5 overall record and a 14–0 conference record. No Ivy League team would go 14–0 again until the 1990–91 Princeton Tigers men's basketball team. The team lost its March 13, 1976 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament East Regional first round game against the No. 3 Rutgers Scarlett Knights 54–53 at the Providence Civic Center in Providence, Rhode Island.\nDuring the season, the team spent two weeks of the seventeen-week season ranked in the Associated Press Top Twenty Poll, peaking at number fifteen and ending the season unranked. However, the team finished the season ranked tied at number nineteen in the final UPI Coaches' Poll. The team was the first of nineteen Princeton teams to win the national statistical championship in scoring defense with an average of 52.9 points allowed. That was an NCAA record (since 1965) that the team would break the following season. Ilan Ramati posted seven blocked shots against on January 6, 1976, which established an Ivy League record that would stand until Chris Dudley had nine on February 14, 1987. It remains a league record for non-conference games. In the same game, Frank Sowinski made all twelve of his free throws to find his way into the Ivy League's record books although short of Bill Bradley's perfect 16 free throw night and the Ivy League record of 21. Michael Steurer had eight steals against on February 6, 1976, which established an Ivy League record that would stand until March 5, 1983.\nThe team was led by first team All-Ivy League selection Armond Hill, who was named Ivy League Men's Basketball Player of the Year, and by fellow first team selection Barnes Hauptfuhrer. Hill was selected in the 1976 NBA draft with the 9th overall selection in the first round by the Atlanta Hawks, while Hauptfuhrer was selected with the 43rd overall selection in the third round by the Houston Rockets. Hill repeated as the free throw percentage statistical champion with an 84.8% average.

The Huskies compete in the Hockey East conference. The Huskies play in the Toscano Family Ice Forum.\nHistory.\nThe UConn Huskies women's ice hockey team began in 2000, under head coach Heather Linstad, in the Mark Edward Freitas Ice Forum. In its first season, the team played as an independent team. In the 2001–02 season, the team joined the ECAC Hockey women's conference. Since the 2002–03 season, they have participated in the Hockey East (HEA), also known as the Women's Hockey East Association (WHEA), conference.\nForward Jaclyn Hawkins, who played during 2004 to 2007, is ranked 10th in career goals in the WHEA. She scored 51 goals and 43 assists in 81 games. In 2006, she tied a NCAA record for 3 power play goals in a single game, setting the Hockey East record for that feat.\nA 1–0 shutout by Connecticut on November 13, 2010, ended the New Hampshire Wildcats’ 17-game unbeaten streak against the Huskies. The Huskies penalty kill was a perfect 6-of-6 on the weekend. The shutout marked the first time the Wildcats were shut out at home since November 28, 2004 (by the Mercyhurst Lakers), a streak of 109 consecutive home games.\nThe Huskies played an outdoor game against the Providence Friars at Rentschler Field on February 13, 2011, as part of the Whalers Hockey Fest. \nAfter thirteen seasons as head coach, Heather Linstad left in 2013. Chris MacKenzie became head coach in May 2013. \nNetminder Elaine Chuli holds the Hockey East record for all-time career saves, which she set in 2015–16 season with the Huskies. \nThe 2017–18 season was the most dramatic in the history of women's ice hockey at UConn. The team was in last place at the end of January, but turned the season around. They upset the Boston College Eagles, ranked number 3, in the semi-finals of the Hockey East tournament, and went on to play in the league championship game. They lost in a close game to Northeastern Huskies, by a score of 2–1. Senior goalie, Annie Bélanger, was selected as the Hockey East Goalie of the Year, and named to the Hockey East All-Star First Team. \nIn the 2019–20 season, the Huskies finished 5th in the league. They defeated Boston College in the quarterfinals, winning the third and deciding game 2–1. They went on to defeat the New Hampshire Wildcats 4–0 in the semi-finals to advance to the final against the Northeastern Huskies. They were defeated in the championship game by a score of 9–1.\nIn 2023, the Huskies moved to the new Toscano Family Ice Forum, adjacent to the Ice Forum.

However, the Friars did not receive votes in either the AP Poll or Coaches' Poll at any point in the season.\nThe Friars lost seven of their final eight regular season conference games, finishing 14th in the conference before falling to Marquette in the first round of the 2011 Big East men's basketball tournament. Davis was fired three days later.\nOffseason.\nOn the morning of April 12, 2010 two freshmen – center James Still and guard Johnnie Lacy – were arrested outside of campus after Lacy and Still randomly attacked another student on the street. Lacy and Still were charged with assault and suspended from the school the same day; Lacy had already planned on transferring at the end of the spring semester. Fellow freshman guard Duke Mondy was detained for questioning, but was not charged. Still was later dismissed from the school.\nOn May 18, 2010, sophomore forward Jamine Peterson – the Friars' leading scorer in 2009–10 and an All-Big East Honorable Mention – announced to SLAM Magazine that he was turning professional and would pursue playing opportunities overseas. The same day, the school announced Peterson was dismissed from the team for a team rules violation, which was later revealed to have been an on-campus incident involving Peterson and AAU players from Boston on April 23 or 24, 2010.\nOn the morning of July 18, 2010, redshirt freshman forward Kadeem Batts was arrested outside of a Providence nightclub and was charged with disorderly conduct and failing to disperse after he did not follow police orders to leave the area. The charges were dismissed after six months.\nThe Friars also lost two graduating starting guards, Sharaud Curry and Brian McKenzie, as well as graduating reserve guard Luke Burchett. Center Ray Hall graduated but returned to the team for a fifth year of eligibility, while junior forward Russ Permenter transferred after one season with the Friars. In addition, assistant coach Pat Skerry was hired by Pittsburgh head coach Jamie Dixon as an assistant coach on May 27. He was replaced by Boston AAU coach Chris Driscoll, who coached Class of 2010 recruits Gerard Coleman and Ron Giplaye. Also hired as Director of Player Development and Video Operations was former NBA player Kevin Gamble, who played for Keno Davis' father Tom Davis at Iowa.\nA week after Skerry's departure, 2011 recruit Naadir Tharpe, a guard rated 4/5 stars by Rivals.com who had committed in March 2010, decommitted from Providence due to Skerry's departure. The next day, June 3, the team lost another 4-star recruit by Rivals.com from the 2010 class, guard Joe Young. However, the school did not allow Young to be released from his signed National Letter of Intent; his family stated Young \"would never play at Providence.\" Young later enrolled in the University of Houston, where is father, Michael, was the school's Director of Basketball Operations. Due to NCAA regulations, Young sat out his first year at Houston before returning for three seasons of eligibility.\nDuring the 2010–11 season, Providence lost a top class of 2012 recruit and Rhode Island native Ricky Ledo, who gave Providence a verbal commitment in December 2010, only to rescind his commitment in January 2011.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=9| Exhibition games\n!colspan=9| Non-conference games\n!colspan=8| Big East regular season\n!colspan=8| Big East tournament"

        "text": "The 2010–11 Memphis Tigers men's basketball team represented the University of Memphis in the 2010–11 college basketball season, the 90th season of Tiger basketball. The Tigers were coached by head coach Josh Pastner (assisted by Glynn Cyprien, Jack Murphy, and Willis Wilson), and played their home games at the FedExForum in Memphis, Tennessee. They are members of Conference USA. They finished the season 25–10, 10–6 in C-USA play and won the 2011 Conference USA men's basketball tournament to earn an automatic bid in the 2011 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament where they lost in the second round to Arizona.\nPre-season.\nThe 2009–10 Memphis Tigers finished the season with a record of 24–10 (13–3 C-USA). The Tigers finished in second place in C-USA, but were upset in the quarterfinals of the conference tournament by 7 seed and ultimate champion, Houston. For the first time since 2005, the Tigers did not earn a bid to the NCAA tournament. The Tigers accepted an invitation to the 2010 National Invitation Tournament, beating St. John's before being defeated by Ole Miss in the second round.\nThe Tigers signed a number of highly rated recruits before the 2010–2011 season began, including three native Memphians: Tarik Black of Ridgeway High School, Joe Jackson of White Station High School, and Chris Crawford of Sheffield High School. The incoming freshman class of 2010 also included Will Barton and his brother, Antonio Barton, Jelan Kendrick, and Hippolyte Tsafack. The signing class, which included three All-Americans (Jackson, Will Barton, Kendrick), was rated the country's second best.\nDepartures.\n\"Statistics accurate as of 29 March 2010\".\nSeason summary.\nThe Tigers began the 2010–2011 season ranked 19th in the AP Poll and the pre-season favorite to win the Conference USA championship. Prior to the team's first regular season game with Centenary, Jelan Kendrick was suspended. After the game, Kendrick asked for permission to seek a transfer and was released.\nThe team announced on December 10, 2010 that junior forward Wesley Witherspoon would be out a number of weeks as a result of knee surgery. On December 12, 2010, junior forward Angel Garcia left the Tigers to play professionally in Spain.\nHighlights of the regular season included wins over pre-season No. 12 Gonzaga and two victories each against both Southern Miss and UAB. However, beset by injuries, transfers, suspensions, and inconsistent play from their heralded freshmen and upperclassmen, the Tigers underachieved relative to their pre-season expectations during a majority of their regular season schedule. The Tigers suffered their worst margin of defeat in the FedEx Forum in several years in their loss to then No. 10 Georgetown on December 23, 2010 by a score of 69–86. The Tigers also lost at Rice, SMU, and East Carolina during their Conference USA schedule.\nThe Tigers entered the 2011 Conference USA men's basketball tournament as the 4 seed with a 22–9 overall record and 10–6 record in conference. Tournament MVP Joe Jackson led the Tigers to the tournament championship, defeating 5 seed Southern Miss, 8 seed East Carolina, and 3 seed UTEP, which was playing at home, for the conference crown. Jackson sealed the victory against UTEP in the championship game in dramatic fashion, scoring the final two of his 17 points on two free throws with 7.8 seconds remaining, causing the Tigers to take their first lead of the game.\nThe Tigers earned a 12 seed in the 2011 NCAA tournament, where they were defeated by 5th seeded Arizona Wildcats on Friday March 18, 2011 in Tulsa, Oklahoma by a score of 77–75.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=9 style=| Exhibition\n!colspan=9 style=| Regular Season\n!colspan=9 style=| Conference USA Tournament\n!colspan=9 style=| NCAA Tournament"

        "text": "George Almond Munger (June 24, 1909 – July 21, 1994) was an American athlete, coach and athletic director. He played college football and competed in track and field at the University of Pennsylvania from 1930 to 1933. He returned to Penn as head coach of the football team from 1938 to 1953 and as director of physical education from 1954 to 1974. His 1945 and 1947 teams finished ranked among the top ten college football teams in the United States, and he coached five players who were inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame and three who received the Maxwell Award as the best player in college football. Munger was inducted in the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1976. The Maxwell Football Club has present the George Munger Award each year since 1989 to the national college football coach of the year.\nBiography.\nEarly years.\nMunger was born in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania in 1909. His father, Herbert N. Munger, was the co-owner of the Munger &amp; Long department store in Camden, New Jersey. Munger received his early education at the Friends School in Camden. He received his preparatory education at The Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania and the Episcopal Academy in the Overbrook section of Philadelphia. He was the captain of the football team at Episcopal Academy in 1928 and 1929. He led Episcopal to two undefeated seasons in football and once scored eight touchdowns in a game. He also helped lead Episcopal to two basketball championships and a baseball championship. He also set school records in the pole vault, high jump, discus and javelin.\nAthlete at Penn.\nHe later attended the University of Pennsylvania where he played at the halfback for the Penn Quakers football team from 1930 to 1932. He also competed for Penn in track and field and won the decathlon at the 1932 Penn Relays. With the Penn Relays being comparable to the Olympic Trials, Munger should have been a lock for the 1932 Olympics. But citing a lack of depth in the 1932 Relays field, another Olympics Trials were held in Chicago. Munger failed to clear a starting 12-foot height in the pole vault, finished ninth, and was named an alternate to the squad.\nTeacher and coach at Episcopal Academy.\nAfter graduating from Penn in 1933, Munger taught mathematics and religion and coached football at the Episcopal Academy. In September 1935, he married Louise Laycock Smith in the Chapel of the Episcopal Academy.\nCoach and administrator at Penn.\nMunger was hired by Penn as the freshman football and track coach in 1936 and held that position during the 1936 and 1937 football seasons. In January 1938, the 28-year-old Munger took over as the head coach of the Penn football team. He also became an assistant professor in the Department of Physical Education effective July 1, 1938. He served as the head football coach at Penn for 16 years from 1938 to 1953, compiling a record of 82–42–10 for a .649 winning percentage. His Penn teams finished ranked among the top ten college football teams in the United States on three occasions, including a No. 7 ranking in 1947 and a No. 8 ranking in 1945. Munger's 1947 team finished with an undefeated 7–0–1 record and outscored opponents 219 to 35. The 1947 team shut out both Navy and Cornell by identical scores of 21–0, and its only setback was a 7–7 tie with Army.\nMunger coached 16 All-American football players at Penn, and three of his players, Robert H. Odell (1943), Chuck Bednarik (1948) and Reds Bagnell (1950), won the Maxwell Award as the best college football player in the United States. Five of his players have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame: Odell, Bednarik, Bagnell, Skip Minisi, and George Savitsky.\nDuring the Munger era, Penn regularly drew crowds of 75,000 to home games at Franklin Field. Munger's teams led the nation in attendance between 1938 and 1942 with 1.78 million fans. \"The Daily Pennsylvanian\" later wrote, \"The Munger era represented the heyday of Quaker football.\"\nAfter resigning as the football coach, Munger served as the director of physical education at Penn from 1954 to 1974. He was also a vice-president of the National Football Foundation and the Maxwell Club, president of the American Football Coaches Association, and a member of the U.S. Olympic Equestrian Committee and physical fitness committees under Presidents Franklin Roosevelt, Dwight Eisenhower, and John F. Kennedy. During the summers from 1952 to 1976, he was Director of Camp Tecumseh, a boy's camp in Center Harbor, N.H. founded by three former Olympians in 1903.\nHonors and awards.\nMunger was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1976. Munger's biography at the Hall of Fame describes him as \"a superb, relaxed athlete, an innovative coach, and a meticulous administrator.\" The University of Pennsylvania also named its football training complex, the George Munger Training Complex, after him, and the Munger Award is given each year to the most valuable player on the Penn football team.\nIn 1989, the Maxwell Football Club began awarding the George Munger Award to the college football coach of the year. In its description of the award, the Maxwell Club says of Munger, \"His devotion to ethics in athletics, and his commitment to education is the standard for which all college coaches should strive.\" Recipients of the award include Bo Schembechler, Joe Paterno, Lloyd Carr, Bob Stoops, Pete Carroll, and Urban Meyer. In March 2010, the club announced that the award would be renamed the Joseph V. Paterno Award. After Joe Paterno's involvement in a child sex abuse scandal, the Maxwell Club returned the award to its former name. It continues to be awarded to a promising college football coach every year.\nDeath.\nMunger died from heart failure in July 1994 at age 84. He was survived by his wife Viola, daughter Carol Ober and four grandchildren. At the time of Munger's death, Chuck Bednarik told \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\", \"[Munger] taught me a secret – the secret of how to approach life. He was a jovial man who would always laugh and act young. When I saw him a few years ago, it was like he had never changed, like he was in his '40s.\""

The Czech Republic won the championship for the sixth time after defeating Russia 2–1 in the final.\nBefore the start of the championship, each participating nation had to submit a list of players for its roster. A minimum of fifteen skaters and two goaltenders and a maximum of twenty skaters and three goaltenders had to be selected. A country that had selected fewer than the maximum allowed were required to choose the remaining players prior to the start of the tournament. After the start of the tournament, each team was allowed to add an additional two players to their roster, for a maximum of 25. Once players were registered to the team, they could not be removed from the roster.\nTo have qualified for the national team under IIHF rules, a player must have met several criteria. He must be a citizen of the nation, and be under the jurisdiction of that national association. Players are allowed to switch which national team they play for, providing they fulfill the IIHF criteria. If participating for the first time in an IIHF event, the player was required to have played two consecutive years in the national competition of the new country without playing in another country. If the player has already played for a national team before, he may switch countries if he is a citizen of the new country, and has played for four consecutive years in the national competition of the new country. This switch may happen only once in the player's life.\nDennis Endras of Germany led the tournament in goaltending with a save percentage of 0.961, and was named the tournament's most valuable player and top goaltender by the IIHF directorate. Russian Pavel Datsyuk was named top forward and Petteri Nummelin of Finland was selected as top defenceman. Russia's Ilya Kovalchuk was the tournament's leading scorer with 12 points."

The school competes in the Ivy League in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The Tigers play home basketball games at the Jadwin Gymnasium in Princeton, New Jersey, on the university campus. Princeton has appeared in 25 NCAA tournaments, most recently in 2023. In 1965, the Tigers made the NCAA Final Four, with Bill Bradley being named the Most Outstanding Player. The team is currently coached by former player Mitch Henderson.\nThe team is known for the Princeton offense strategy, perfected under the tenure of former head coach Pete Carril, who coached the team from 1967 to 1996. The Princeton offense has resulted in Princeton leading the nation in scoring defense 20 times since 1976, including every year from 1989 to 2000. As of 2023, the Tigers have amassed 1803 victories, 25 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament appearances (including four consecutive appearances between 1989 and 1992), and 30 Ivy League regular season titles. Their main Ivy League rivalry is with Penn.\nEight different Tigers have earned 12 All-American recognitions. Bill Bradley is the only three-time honoree. Numerous Tigers have played professional basketball. The most recent Tiger NBAer was Steve Goodrich.

Three of the five highest NBA career point totals by Ivy League players were by Tigers. Five of the ten Ivy League players selected among the top 25 overall selections in the NBA draft were Tigers.\nCoaches.\nCarril holds the Ivy League record for most career seasons, championships, and wins. Bill Carmody holds the career winning percentage record.\nArenas.\nPrinceton originally played its home games at University Gymnasium until it burned down in 1944. Hobey Baker Memorial Rink served as the interim home court for the 1945–46 and 1946–47 seasons until Dillon Gymnasium was built. The 6,800-seat Jadwin Gymnasium hosted the Tigers for the first time on January 25, 1969, against the Penn Quakers men's basketball team. It continues to be the team's home court.\nIvy League.\nThe Tigers have played against their Ivy League foes for over a century.\nThrough 2017–2018 season\nAwards and honors.\nBill Bradley has won numerous distinctions as a Princeton Tiger.

It is the oldest all-female rowing club in existence. Built in 1860, the club's boathouse is the oldest structure on Boathouse Row, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and designated a National Historic Landmark.\nPGRC was founded in 1938 by seventeen women (mostly wives of oarsmen at other clubs) who wanted to participate in the then predominantly male sport of rowing.\nHistory of the boathouse.\nIn 1860, Philadelphia City Council authorized construction of the structure that is now #14 Boathouse Row for the purpose of housing the Philadelphia Skating Club and Humane Society.\nArchitect, James C. Sidney, designed the building to provide for the Skating Club, but also included a basement facility to store boats for neighboring rowing clubs whose boat houses were scheduled to be removed by the city. Samuel Sloan, a well-known Philadelphia architect, likely influenced the design of #14 Boathouse Row with his rendering of \"Italian Villa,\" Plate XXIV, in his book \"Model Architect.\" The construction cost $4,900 and was completed in 1861.\nThe Undine and University Barge Clubs housed their boats at the Philadelphia Skating Club building until the city permitted them to build their own structures in 1882 and 1871, respectively. From 1884 through 1895, the second Iona Boat Club (now defunct) occupied the space in the building left vacant by Undine Barge Club.\nWith the advent of artificially frozen indoor skating rinks at the beginning of the 20th century, skating on the Schuylkill River declined precipitously. In 1965, PGRC purchased the boathouse from the Philadelphia Skating Club."

        "text": "Skeleton Crew is a 2009 Finnish horror film directed by Tero Molin and Tommi Lepola, and written by Tero Molin and Teemu Molin.\nPlot.\nIn the 1970s, a mental institution near the Finland–Russia border was shut down when it was discovered that main administrator Doctor Andersson (who had taken to calling himself \"The Auteur\") had filmed himself torturing patients to death. Most of the doctor's films were confiscated, though the rooms in which they were developed and screened were never found.\nAround thirty years later, the asylum is being used as the set of \"Silent Creek\", a film based on the murders committed in it. While doing recordings, two soundmen hear disembodied voices, and find a hidden room. The chamber contains Andersson's undiscovered work, and while the bulk of the cast and crew of \"Silent Creek\" are disgusted by the snuff films, they decide not to call the police, since doing so would shut down production. Steven, the director of \"Silent Creek\", becomes obsessed with Andersson's films (which he is drawn to one night by an apparition) and begins acting deranged, claiming that \"Silent Creek\" is \"not real enough\".\nAfter finding Andersson's camera among the snuff films, Steve tricks Bruce (the actor playing Andersson) into killing an actress with a drill (which he said was just a prop) while he films it. The next day, the rest of the cast and crew find a note on Andersson's projector telling them to turn it on. The projector shows Steven (dressed like Andersson) disemboweling Mari while ranting about how he is \"The Auteur\". Steven then cuts a restrained Bruce in half with a chainsaw, which is shown through a television in the break room. Since the telephones and vehicles all fail to work, the remaining employees decide to make a run for it, after they look for the missing Mike. During the search, Klasu is taken after drinking drugged liquor.\nIn the previously sealed attic the rest of the group find a Moviola showing \"Skeleton Crew\" itself, everything up until that very moment. As everyone theorizes that it is like reality itself has become blurred and they are inside a horror film, the machinery shows Klasu in a pit with Mike. Steven throws two spiked clubs into the hole, and has Klasu and Mike fight for their freedom. The former wins, but Steven goes back on his word, and burns Klasu to death with spotlights. The next to die is Erno, who is locked in the attic and bombarded with sound, causing a fatal aneurysm.\nWhile he, Lisa, and Anna are looking for another way out due to the main doors being sealed, Darius is captured, strung up, and impaled by a spear attached to a camera set on a dolly. Steven then takes Anna, severs her right arm and left leg, and leaves her for Lisa to find. Anna begs for death, and Lisa comes close to mercy killing her, but upon realizing that this scenario is almost an exact recreation of the opening of \"Silent Creek\", fakes passing out. When an angered Steven approaches her, Lisa shoots him several times with a dead crew member's gun. Steven survives being shot, and upon realizing he cannot be killed due to the supernatural presence in the asylum, Lisa shoots herself in the mouth to spite Steve and ruin his film. However, Lisa survives the suicide attempt, and wakes up tied to chair, with Steven about to torture her with a blowtorch.\nIn a post-credits scene, Steven is shown watching \"Skeleton Crew\" in a theatre. A viewer yells out \"Ah, mate, that really sucked. Weren't even any fucking tits!\"\nRelease.\nLightning Media released \"Skeleton Crew\" on DVD 21 July 2009.\nReception.\nDavid Johnon of DVD Verdict wrote that it was well put together and \"different and cool\". Bill Gibron of DVD Talk rated the film 1.5/5 stars and called it \"a crime, the kind of waste of effort affront that makes you rethink your love of the genre in the first place.\""

Webster scored 30 goals for the Red Wings in the 1970-71 season, but only managed 3 goals in 12 games of the 1971-72 season. He also played 352 games for the New England Whalers of the World Hockey Association, scoring 40 or more goals three times. Spinal fusion surgery complicated the end of his career, and Webster retired in 1981 at age 31. \nCoaching career.\nAfter retiring as a player, Webster had been the coach for a number of teams at various levels of hockey.\nHis first head coaching job came in 1986, when he became coach of the New York Rangers following Ted Sator's firing. After only five games, Webster fell ill with what was later diagnosed as an inner-ear infection that left him unable to fly. He returned as head coach on January 5 for home games only; general manager Phil Esposito split coaching duties with assistants Eddie Giacomin and Wayne Cashman for road games. He was cleared to fly again in January, but he suffered a relapse during a game against the Edmonton Oilers, and was told to stay off planes for at least three months. Esposito named himself head coach for the remainder of the season. When it became apparent that Webster would not be able to return to the bench full-time the following season, he resigned on April 30, 1987.\nWebster's next head coaching stint was with the Los Angeles Kings, from May 31, 1989, to May 4, 1992. He led the Kings to their first and only regular season division title in franchise history, in the 1990-91 season.\nWhile coaching the Kings in a game against Detroit on November 16, 1991, Webster became upset at what he felt was a blown call by referee Kerry Fraser. The Kings were assessed an extra penalty, and Webster took a stick and threw it on the ice, hitting one of Fraser's skates. Webster was suspended for 12 games.\nWebster also served as an amateur scout for the Calgary Flames from 2003 to 2014.\nHonors.\nIn 2012, he was inducted into the World Hockey Association Hall of Fame.\nDeath.\nWebster died on April 10, 2020, at the age of 71; he had been reported to have brain cancer."

While at the Steamers he won the Ranfurly Shield defeating Auckland on 15 August 2004. The Steamers had one successful defence of the title before losing to Canterbury. Schmidt joined the Blues as assistant coach from 2004 to 2007 where, in his final year, they were knocked out in the semi-final.\nClermont Auvergne.\nSchmidt moved to Europe and joined Clermont Auvergne in 2007 as backs coach under Vern Cotter who he had previously worked with in Auckland. The side finished Top 14 runners-up twice in 2008 &amp; 2009. In 2010 the side finally won the competition, after 11 appearances in the final. In Europe, Clermont made less of an impact in the competition than in the Top 14. Between 2007 and 2009, Clermont failed to progress past the group stages, but during the 2009–10 Heineken Cup, Schmidt's last season with Clermont, Clermont advanced to the quarter-finals, but lost to Leinster 29–28.\nLeinster.\nSchmidt took over as Leinster head coach from Michael Cheika for the 2010–11 season. Under his leadership Leinster won the 2011 Heineken Cup, after beating Northampton Saints 33–22, and lost to Munster in the Celtic League Grand Final in May 2011. In the 2011–2012 season, he coached Leinster to a second Pro12 final, losing to the Ospreys 31–30, and led the team to the 2012 Heineken Cup Final, where Leinster retained their title beating Ulster 42–14. In his final year in charge, he coached Leinster to win the Amlin Challenge Cup and Pro12 titles, beating Stade Français 34–13 and Ulster 24–18 respectively. He ended his Leinster tenure with an overall record of 77 wins from 99 matches, which included a 75% win rate in the Pro 12 and an 85% win rate in Europe.\nIreland national team.\n2013–2015.\nThe IRFU announced on 29 April 2013 that Schmidt would leave his position as Leinster coach to take over the Ireland coaching position left vacant by Declan Kidney. Schmidt's first contract would run until the end of the 2015–16 season.\nHis first game in charge of Ireland was against Samoa on 9 November 2013 - Ireland won the match 40–9 The following week, Ireland were convincingly beaten by Australia, losing 32–15. However, on 24 November, Ireland had a 19–0 lead against New Zealand but went on to lose by 24–22 after Aaron Cruden scored an overtime conversion for New Zealand. On 15 March 2014, Schmidt's Ireland side defeated France in Paris 22–20 to lift the 2014 Six Nations Championship title, his first silverware with the nation. His only loss was to England at Twickenham 13–10. In June 2014, Ireland claimed their first ever test series win over Argentina during their 2014 Argentine test series. The first test, marked Ireland's first ever win over Argentina on Argentine soil, winning 29–17. In November 2014 during the end-of-year rugby union internationals, Ireland defeated South Africa, Georgia and Australia to move to third in the World Rugby Rankings.\nIn December 2014, Schmidt was named as the Philips Sports Manager of the Year and named as the manager of the Year at the 2014 RTÉ Sports awards.\nOn 1 March 2015, Ireland won their tenth test match in a row after a 19–9 win against England in the 2015 Six Nations Championship, equalling an Irish record set in 2003.\nThat run came to an end in the next match on 15 March when Ireland lost 23–16 against Wales at the Millennium Stadium, a defeat that ended Ireland's hopes of winning the Grand Slam. During the final week of the 2015 Six Nations, Ireland, England, France and Wales were all in the chance to claim the title. With Wales' 61–20 win over Italy in the first fixture of the week, not only could France not claim the title, Ireland needed to beat Scotland by more than 21 points to knock Wales out of the equation and keep their chance of retaining the title alive - Ireland later recorded a 40–10 victory. The final match saw England and France play at Twickenham, and England needed to beat France by 27 points or more to claim the title. However, England only won by 20 points, 55–35, which saw Ireland claim their title for a second consecutive year.\nOn 22 July 2015, Schmidt extended his contract with Ireland until 2017. He became an Irish citizen on 2 September 2015.\nIreland opened their 2015 Rugby World Cup campaign on 19 September with a 50–7 win against Canada, and followed that up a week later with a 44–10 win against Romania at Wembley Stadium. In their third match of the World Cup they faced Italy, and won the game 16–9 to book their place in the quarter-finals. In their final match of the World Cup pool stage they faced France, and won the game 24–9 to top pool D.\nOn 18 October 2015, Ireland lost by 43–20 to Argentina in the Quarter-finals.\n2016–2019.\nIreland finished in third place in the 2016 Six Nations Championship with two wins against Italy (58–15) and Scotland (35–25), a draw against Wales (16–16) and two losses to France (10–9) and England (21–10). In June 2016, Schmidt led Ireland to their first ever away victory over South Africa when the Irish won the first test of their tour of South Africa 26–20. This was despite playing with only 14 players on the field for more than 50 minutes of the game when CJ Stander was red-carded in the 22nd minute. In the second test, Ireland led South Africa 19–3 at half time, but 29 unanswered points in the second half saw South Africa draw level in the series. The final test saw South Africa clinch the series, with a 19–13 win over the Irish. On 24 October 2016, Schmidt signed a new contract with the Irish Rugby Football Union to continue as Ireland head coach until the end of the 2019 Rugby World Cup. On 5 November 2016, in Ireland's first match of the Autumn Internationals, Ireland defeated New Zealand for the very first time in a test match, winning 40–29. The following week, they defeated Canada in Dublin 52–21, before playing New Zealand again, on this occasion, losing 21–9. On 26 November, Ireland completed a rare triple-win, defeating Australia 27–24, to become the first team since England in 2003, to beat Australia, New Zealand and South Africa in a single year.\nNew Zealand Rugby offered Schmidt a coaching position within the New Zealand set-up by replacing Wayne Smith and thereby offering him a path of becoming the future New Zealand Head Coach following the departure of their current head coach Steve Hansen, however, he rejected this offer and signed a two-year extension to stay with Ireland up to the conclusion of Ireland's participation in the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan.\nDuring the 2017 Six Nations Championship, Ireland ended England's 18-match unbeaten run when they defeated them in Dublin 13–9 in the final week of the Championship, which secured Ireland a second-place finish. This came despite a first round loss to Scotland 27–22 and a 22–9 loss to Wales in Cardiff. Schmidt later led a depleted Ireland team on a victorious June tour winning all three games convincingly; 55–19 win over the United States followed by a 2–0 series win over Japan, winning 50–22 and 35–13. During the 2017 Autumn Internationals, Ireland won all three games, against South Africa (38–3) a record victory, Fiji (23–20), and Argentina (28–19) to move up to third in the World Rugby Rankings.\nOn March 10, 2018, Ireland claimed the 2018 Six Nations Championship with a round to go, and rose to second place in the world rankings. This came, following victories over France (15–13), Italy (56–19), Wales (37–27) and Scotland (28–8). Their Championship was complete with a 24–15 victory over England, their first since 2010 at Twickenham, in the final round to claim their first Grand Slam since 2009. In June 2018, he led his side to a 2–1 series victory over Australia, their first series win in Australia since 1979.\nOn 17 November 2018, in the end-of-year internationals, Ireland beat New Zealand for the second time (and the first time on Irish soil). Following this victory, speculation was rife that Schmidt would not renew his contract as Ireland's head coach and that he would put his family first and return to New Zealand.\nOn 25 November 2018, at the World Rugby Awards which were hosted in Monaco, Joe Schmidt was awarded the World Rugby Coach of the Year. He is only the second Irish Rugby Football Union coach to receive the award (the first Irish Rugby Football Union Coach to win it was Declan Kidney back in 2009). He was not present at the ceremony and Ireland Rugby Vice-Captain Peter O'Mahony accepted the award on Schmidt's behalf. At the same awards, Ireland was awarded World Rugby Team of the Year and Irish fly-half Johnny Sexton walked away with World Rugby Player of the Year.\nOn 26 November 2018 Schmidt announced his retirement from coaching after the 2019 Rugby World Cup. He began his final year as Ireland coach with a 32–20 loss to England on 2 February in the first round of the 2019 Six Nations Championship. This was Ireland's first home loss since 2016, and their first loss to England at the Aviva Stadium since 2013. Ireland returned to winning ways against Scotland the following week, winning 22–13 before back to back wins over Italy and France and defeat away to Grand Slam winning Wales on 16 March to finish in third place in the championship.\nSchmidt guided Ireland to World number 1 in the World Rugby Rankings for the first time in their history when his Irish teams defeated Wales back-to-back, home and away, in the 2019 Rugby World Cup warm-up matches.\nAt the 2019 Rugby World Cup, Ireland began with a 27–3 win against Scotland on 22 September before losing to Japan a week later 19–12 in the Shizuoka Stadium. \nWins over Russia by 35-0 and Samoa by 47-5 set up a quarter-final against New Zealand on 19 October. \nIn Schmidt's last game in charge, New Zealand won 46–14 to eliminate Ireland from the World Cup at the quarter-final stage. Schmidt later analysed that not prioritising the 2019 Six Nations Championship ahead of the 2019 Rugby World Cup subsequently resulted in Ireland underperforming in the Rugby World Cup.\nFormer Ireland defence coach Andy Farrell became the new head coach of the Irish team in January 2020.\nTechnical advisor and World Rugby.\nIn February 2020, Schmidt worked with the Spanish national team for a day in advance of their Rugby Europe Championship match with Georgia and he was due to co-coach the Classic All Blacks team in their match against Spain in May 2020. However, the match was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSchmidt was appointed World Rugby's director of rugby and high performance in October 2020, a newly created position that included responsibility on issues related to player welfare, training and education. Schmidt resigned a year later from this position to spend more time with his family in New Zealand.\nReturn to New Zealand.\nSchmidt returned to the Blues, joining the coaching staff in a part-time supportive role to Leon MacDonald for the 2022 Super Rugby Pacific season, following the departure of Tana Umaga. He was cited as being the main influence behind the Blues' appearance in their first Super Rugby final since 2003. They were defeated by the Crusaders 21-7 at Eden Park to finish the season as runners-up.\nNew Zealand national team.\nIn late 2021, it was announced that Schmidt would take up the position of selector for the New Zealand national team following the tour by Ireland to New Zealand in 2022. Following failed COVID-19 tests for New Zealand head coach Ian Foster and his assistants John Plumtree and Scott McLeod, Schmidt was called in to coach New Zealand ahead of their first test against Ireland. New Zealand won the first test 42-19, but went on to lose the final two tests (12-23 and 22-32), earning Ireland their first test victories on New Zealand soil and first series victory over New Zealand.\nOn August 17, 2022, it was announced that Schmidt would become an integral part of the All Blacks' coaching setup, assuming the role of attack coach. He was credited as being the influential force behind New Zealand winning the 2022 Rugby Championship\nAustralia national team.\nOn 19 January 2024, Schmidt was appointed the new coach of Australia on a two-year contract, replacing Eddie Jones. He becomes the third New Zealander to serve as head coach of Australia after Robbie Deans and Dave Rennie. He will officially commence his duties on 1 March 2024.\nIreland head coaching record by opponent.\n\"Updated as of 19 October 2019\"\nClub Honours.\nBay of Plenty \"(as assistant coach)\"\nLeinster\nClermont Auvergne \"(as assistant coach)\"\nCoaching approach.\nKnown for his attention to detail, his knowledge of the game of rugby and his \"sharp tactical brain\", Schmidt has built a reputation as a fierce operator with one of the best rugby brains in the world. Schmidt is known for analysing his opposition closely, for short, sharp training sessions, and for simple game strategies based on pressure, territory, intelligent defence with aggressive line speed, and rehearsed attacking plays. He also sometimes limits offloading if he feels his side will not win the collisions.\nPersonal life.\nOn 2 September 2015, Schmidt was granted Irish citizenship. His son Luke was diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of four and Schmidt has become involved with Epilepsy Ireland. In recognition of Schmidt's high-profile advocacy for epilepsy services, he was awarded an Honorary Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (HonFRCSI) in May 2019.\nSchmidt missed the preparations for the 2019 Rugby World Cup warm-up match with Italy in Dublin to be by the bedside of his mother as she died. He later said at a press conference in Japan, when asked of his future plans after the World Cup, \"we'll probably stay in Ireland for some time. We've become pretty settled there\" and \"A big motivator for me to get back [to New Zealand] was family and unfortunately we lost our mum recently.\" However, Schmidt moved with his family back to New Zealand in 2020, as he explained in the best interests of his youngest son Luke, who was struggling with his epilepsy under the COVID-19 lockdown restrictions imposed by the Irish Government."

        "text": "The 1958 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 25th playing of the midsummer classic between the all-stars of the American League (AL) and National League (NL), the two leagues comprising Major League Baseball. The game was held on July 8, 1958, at Memorial Stadium in Baltimore, Maryland, the home of the Baltimore Orioles of the American League.\nThis was the first Major League Baseball All-Star Game without an extra base hit.\nFor this silver jubilee game, the ceremonial first pitch was thrown by U.S. Vice President Richard Nixon, who became President 10 years later. The attendance was 48,829. The game was broadcast on the NBC television and radio networks.\nThe first hit of the game was by legendary center fielder Willie Mays. The last scoring came in the sixth inning when the American League team took the lead after an error by third baseman Frank Thomas led to a single by Gil McDougald. Early Wynn was the winning pitcher as the American League scored a 4-3 victory.\nSeveral players were named to the team but did not get into the game. These included Billy Pierce, Tony Kubek, Harvey Kuenn, Sherm Lollar, Rocky Bridges, Ryne Duren, Whitey Ford, and Elston Howard for the American League. For the National League team, Johnny Antonelli, Richie Ashburn, George Crowe, Eddie Mathews, Don McMahon, Walt Moryn, Johnny Podres, Bob Purkey, and Bob Schmidt were on the roster but did not play.\nThe next All-Star Game to be played in Baltimore was in 1993; that edition was aired on both CBS TV and radio, and played in Oriole Park at Camden Yards, with a special commemoration of this game's 35th anniversary."

        "text": "The University of Idaho Golf Course is an 18-hole public facility in the northwest United States, on the campus of the University of Idaho in Moscow, Idaho.\nSet in the rolling hills of the Palouse of north central Idaho, a mile (1.6 km) east of the border with Washington, the par-72 course is at an average elevation of above sea level. The back tees measure a moderate , but the significant elevation changes, terraced fairways, and often breezy conditions contribute to make it a challenging track. The slope rating is 128, with a course rating of 72.3; the men's tees (gold) are at , with a slope of 122 and a course rating of 69.5.\nThe course is open eight months per year, March through October, and is located on the western end of Nez Perce Drive, directly south of the Kibbie Dome stadium and the century-old Shattuck Arboretum. The newer UI Arboretum borders on the east, along and below the 17th &amp; 18th holes. The President's House (now \"Executive Residence\") is across the street, northeast of the 18th green.\nHistory.\nThe first nine holes were opened in 1937, on the southwest edge of campus, designed by Englishman Francis L. \"Frank\" James (1877-1952). At the time a Portland resident, he had designed over a hundred courses, including the other two 9-hole courses in the area: the Moscow Elks course east of town in the late 1920s, and the reconstruction of the original WSC course in nearby Pullman, Washington in 1934. James became the course manager, resident professional, and UI golf coach. Following his death in 1952, the recently completed clubhouse was named for him.\nThe original order of play, using the current hole numbers, was 1, 2, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 9 for par 35 at . Before the second nine was constructed, there was also a pitch-and-putt course north of the original nine holes.\nThe second nine holes (four east (# 10, 16-18) and five north &amp; west (# 3-7) of the original nine) were constructed from 1968 to 1970, designed by golf course architect Bob E. Baldock, and the current clubhouse was built in 1969. A former professional golfer from Newport Beach, California, Baldock designed hundreds of courses in the West, including Hangman Valley south of Spokane, Sun Willows in Pasco, Crane Creek C.C. in Boise, Meadow Creek in New Meadows, and the Lewiston Country Club.\nAll 18 holes at the UI course opened for play in August 1970 with some minor modifications to the original nine. The front and back nines were switched in the 1990s, and both nines contain original holes and newer ones. The course was formerly par 71, as the 7th hole (formerly #16), currently a downhill par-5, was a par-4 prior to the addition of new tee boxes and the greenside pond. The greenside ponds on the current 1st and 7th holes were added in the mid-1990s. The lowest part of the course is in the southwest corner at the twelfth green; at approximately , it is below the clubhouse.\nThe par-5 fourth hole was part of the grade of the old road to Pullman. The massive water tank behind its green (west) was added in 1980 to satisfy insurance requirements for campus firefighting; the tank north of the tee box was completed in 2010, for chilled water storage for campus air conditioning.\nThe course was originally owned and operated by the Associated Students of the University of Idaho (ASUI), the student government. The university took control of the course in 1986, and the lounge was remodeled in 1990.\nThe UI course became the senior 18-hole venue on the Palouse in 2008, when Washington State University in Pullman opened its long-anticipated Palouse Ridge Golf Club in late August.\nVandal Golf &amp; Professional Golf Management.\nThe UI Golf Course is the home of the Vandal golf teams, which compete in the Big Sky Conference of the NCAA. Idaho was formerly a member of the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) (2005–14), Big West (1996–2005), Big Sky (1963–96), and Pacific Coast (1922–59) conferences.\nThe university offers a bachelor's degree in Professional Golf Management, a five-year program in the College of Business and Economics. Launched in 2002, it is the only PGA-accredited college program in the Northwest and one of 20 in the nation."

        "text": "The WA Basketball Centre (also known by its sponsored name, the Bendat Basketball Centre) is a multi-purpose stadium located in Perth, Western Australia. The stadium features eight courts, including two basketball show courts with 1,100 permanent seats and 900 retractable seats, and a six-court sports hall with multi-sport line markings. Facilities cater primarily for basketball, in addition to netball, volleyball and badminton. The stadium also holds a function room on the first floor for up to 270 people, with bar and kitchen facilities. The stadium houses the offices of Basketball Western Australia, Perry Lakes Basketball Association, and the Perth Wildcats. The facility is the main training base of the Wildcats, home court of the Perth Lynx, and hosts countless state, junior and social games throughout the year.\nHistory.\nIn 2008, construction started at AK Reserve in Mount Claremont on new athletics and basketball facilities to replace the crumbling former Commonwealth Games facilities at Perry Lakes. Being built across the road from the old Perry Lakes Athletics Stadium and Perry Lakes Basketball Stadium, the new facilities would join the sports precinct which was already home to Perth Superdrome (more commonly known as Challenge Stadium), the Western Australian Institute of Sport, and UWA Sports Park. While the WA Athletics Stadium opened in 2009, the WA Basketball Centre was officially opened on 24 January 2010. The combined construction cost of the WA Athletics Stadium, WA Basketball Centre and supporting infrastructure was $73 million, with the basketball facilities costing approximately $40 million. The WA Rugby Centre later joined the precinct on adjacent land.\nOn 1 October 2014, Basketball Western Australia took on the day-to-day operations of the stadium under a co-management agreement with VenuesWest, with VenuesWest continuing to maintain the facility after being the sole operator since its opening.\nOn 6 May 2015, the stadium was renamed Bendat Basketball Centre in a 21-year sponsorship agreement in honour of Perth Wildcats owner Dr. Jack Bendat.\nOn 23 March 2020, the stadium was closed to the public indefinitely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The stadium was reopened on 25 May 2020, initially in a limited capacity."

Their 24–5–6 record (15–3–2 in the CHA) earned them their first year-ending ranking, 8th, in both the USCHO and USA Today polls. They won the CHA regular season championship for the first time, and took the Tournament Championship as well, to earn their first entry to the NCAA national championship. They were defeated by top ranked Wisconsin 0–7 in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. Colonials forward Jaycee Gebhard scored 44 points on the season, making her the highest scoring first year player in the country for the season. Brittany Howard became the first Colonial player to be named CHA Player of the Year.\nThe Colonials went on to finish at the top of the CHA standings in 2017-18 and 2018–19, marking three years in a row that they won the regular season championship. They went to four straight championship games, ending the season as conference runner up in 2018, 2019 and 2020.\nOver the course of four seasons (2016–20), the Colonials posted an overall record of 62-22-12 (.777 points percentage), including the program's first ever NCAA Tournament appearance in 2017. The program qualified for the 2021 NCAA National Collegiate Women's Ice Hockey Tournament, ranked as the #8 seed.\nOn February 3, 2022 Logan Bittle was named the head coach for when the team will return in the 2023-2024 season "

This was also the last time that the Florida Panthers missed the playoffs during their 10-season drought, which was previously the all-time longest drought from the tournament. For the first time in NHL history, all three California-based teams, the Los Angeles Kings, San Jose Sharks, and Anaheim Ducks, made the playoffs. San Jose went on to the Western Conference Final, marking the fifth time in eight seasons that a California-based team did so.\nThis season marked the only time that all six division champions advanced to the second round, as the NHL has since reverted to a four-division alignment. For the first time in the history of major professional sports in North America, two different teams came back from a 3–0 deficit to tie a series, with the Chicago Blackhawks forcing game seven against the Vancouver Canucks in the first round, and the Detroit Red Wings did the same against the San Jose Sharks in the second round (both lost). Previously, only the 1975 New York Islanders came back from two 3–0 series deficits in the same season (winning one).\nBy winning game seven of the Stanley Cup Finals, Boston became the first team to win three game sevens in one year, a feat that has since been matched by the 2014 Los Angeles Kings. They also became the second team in three seasons (and only the third team in NHL history) to win the Stanley Cup after losing the first two games of the Finals on the road. Vancouver remained the only team without a Stanley Cup to reach game seven of the Finals, as they also lost game seven of their previous Finals appearance in 1994.\nBruins goaltender Tim Thomas won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player during the playoffs. Bruins forward David Krejci led all playoff scorers with 23 points in 25 games.\nPlayoff seeds.\nThe top eight teams in each conference qualified for the playoffs. The top three seeds in each conference were awarded to the division winners; while the five remaining spots were awarded to the highest finishers in their respective conferences.\nPlayoff bracket.\nIn each round, the highest remaining seed in each conference was matched against the lowest remaining seed. The higher-seeded team was awarded home ice advantage. In the Stanley Cup Finals, home ice was awarded to the team with the better regular season record. Each best-of-seven series followed a 2–2–1–1–1 format: the higher-seeded team played at home for games one and two (plus five and seven if necessary), and the lower-seeded team was at home for games three and four (and if necessary, game six).\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nConference quarterfinals.\nEastern Conference quarterfinals.\n(1) Washington Capitals vs. (8) New York Rangers.\nThe Washington Capitals entered the playoffs as the Eastern Conference regular season champions, earning 107 points. The New York Rangers qualified for the postseason as the eighth seed with 93 points. This was the sixth playoff series between the two franchises; Washington had won three of the previous five meetings between these teams. The two teams last met in the 2009 Eastern Conference quarterfinals, in which the Capitals defeated the Rangers in seven games. In the regular season series, the Rangers held a 3–1–0 record, winning the last three games by a combined score of 15–1, although the Rangers were only able to score eight goals in this series, losing it in five games.\n(2) Philadelphia Flyers vs. (7) Buffalo Sabres.\nThe Philadelphia Flyers entered the playoffs as the second seed in the Eastern Conference after winning the Atlantic Division with 106 points, winning the tiebreaker over the Pittsburgh Penguins on regulation + overtime wins (44 to 39). The Buffalo Sabres earned the seventh seed with 96 points, losing the tiebreaker to Montreal in regulation + overtime wins (41 to 38). This was the ninth playoff meeting between these two teams; Philadelphia had won five of the eight previous playoff series. They last met in the 2006 Eastern Conference quarterfinals, which ended with Buffalo defeating Philadelphia in six games.\nThe series started out with a 1–0 shutout victory for Buffalo Sabres goaltender Ryan Miller in game one, while Philadelphia came back to win games two and three. Miller got another 1–0 shutout victory in game four to tie the series at 2–2. In game five, Buffalo was up 3–0 at the end of the first period, but Philadelphia scored three goals to send the game to overtime. However, Tyler Ennis of Buffalo would score the overtime winner. In game six, Buffalo looked in good position to win after being up 3–1 after the first period, but Philadelphia rallied back, winning the game 5–4 on Ville Leino's overtime winner. In game seven, Philadelphia went up 4–0 about two minutes into the third period on a goal by Leino. Philadelphia ended up winning the game by a score of 5–2, winning the series four games to three. This was the last time the Sabres appeared in the playoffs.\n(3) Boston Bruins vs. (6) Montreal Canadiens.\nThe Boston Bruins entered the playoffs as the third seed in the Eastern Conference after winning the Northeast Division with 103 points. The Montreal Canadiens earned the sixth seed with 96 points, winning the tiebreaker over Buffalo in regulation + overtime wins (41 to 38). One of the greatest rivalries in North American professional sports, this was the 33rd meeting of these teams in the postseason, which is the most frequent playoff series in NHL history. Montreal had a record of 24–8 against Boston in the 32 previous series played by the franchises, winning 18 straight between 1946 and 1987. Boston had only beaten Montreal en route to winning the championship once before, in 1929. The most recent meeting of these teams in the postseason was in the 2009 Eastern Conference quarterfinals, which ended with Boston sweeping Montreal.\nDuring the season, Montreal won four of six meetings. The February 9 game in which Boston won 8–6 featured six fights, a goalie fight, and a total of 187 penalty minutes. The March 8 game, where the Canadiens beat the Bruins 4–1, was marred when the Bruins' Zdeno Chara checked Habs' Max Pacioretty into the glass, and the resulting injury ended Pacioretty's season. The NHL did not suspend Chara for the hit, however Montreal Police opened a criminal investigation into the incident.\nIn this series, the Boston Bruins dropped their first two games at home, but came back to hang on to a game three victory in Montreal. In game four, Andrei Kostitsyn gave the Montreal Canadiens a 3–1 lead, which they couldn't take advantage of, falling 5–4 on an overtime goal by former Montreal Canadien Michael Ryder. In game five, Boston's Ryder made a miraculous glove save while teammate and goaltender Tim Thomas was out of position, \\ and the contest went into double overtime for Nathan Horton to win it 2–1 for Boston. In game six, Montreal scored twice on 5-on-3 power plays and won it 2–1. Game seven was also forced into overtime, where Nathan Horton again won the game 4–3 and sent the Bruins to the second round of the playoffs. Boston became the first team to win a seven-game post-season series despite being held scoreless on the power play.\nOn April 10, the scheduled date of the French-language Canadian federal election debate between party leaders was changed from April 14 to April 13 so it would not conflict with game one of the series. Games six and seven were played back-to-back due to a Lady Gaga concert, held on April 25 at the Bell Centre, and the requirement that the first round of the playoffs end by April 27.\nThis was Montreal's first Game 7 loss since 1994, also against the Bruins, and their last to date.\n(4) Pittsburgh Penguins vs. (5) Tampa Bay Lightning.\nThe Pittsburgh Penguins entered the playoffs as the fourth overall seed in the Eastern Conference with 106 points, losing the tiebreaker for the Atlantic Division title to the Philadelphia Flyers on regulation + overtime wins (39 to 44). The Tampa Bay Lightning earned 103 points during the regular season to finish fifth overall in the Eastern Conference. This was the first playoff series between these two teams.\nTo start the series, Penguins goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury shut-out Tampa Bay 3–0 in game one, with the Lightning responding with a 5–1 win in game two. Unfortunately for the Lightning, they dropped games three and four (game four in double overtime), only to answer with a huge 8–2 victory in Pittsburgh, forcing a game six at home that ended 4–2 in favour of Tampa Bay. In game seven, Lightning forward Sean Bergenheim scored about five minutes into the second period. The Lightning managed to hold on to that 1–0 lead, advancing to the Eastern Conference semifinals.\nWestern Conference quarterfinals.\n(1) Vancouver Canucks vs. (8) Chicago Blackhawks.\nThe Vancouver Canucks entered the playoffs as the Western Conference regular season champions and Presidents' Trophy winners, earning 117 points. The Chicago Blackhawks, the defending Stanley Cup champions, qualified for the post-season as the eighth seed with 97 points. This was the third consecutive year that Vancouver met Chicago in the playoffs. Chicago previously eliminated Vancouver in the second round in both 2009 and 2010; both of those series went to six games. \nThe Canucks defeated the defending Stanley Cup champion Blackhawks in seven games. After losing the first three games of the series, Chicago won the next three. This was the seventh time in NHL history that a team forced a seventh game after trailing 3–0 in a playoff series. However, Vancouver won the seventh game in overtime to avoid becoming the fourth team in NHL history to lose a series after taking a 3–0 series lead.\n(2) San Jose Sharks vs. (7) Los Angeles Kings.\nThe San Jose Sharks entered the playoffs as the second seed in the Western Conference after winning the Pacific Division with 105 points. The Los Angeles Kings earned the seventh seed with 98 points. This was the first meeting of these teams in the post-season.\nThe series started out with a bang in game one, with Dany Heatley scoring only 28 seconds into the game. That game was later on won by Joe Pavelski in overtime, but a good response by the Kings in game two gave them a 4–0 shutout victory in San Jose. In game three, San Jose became the fifth team in NHL playoff history to win a game after facing a 4–0 deficit, where Devin Setoguchi of San Jose scored the game-winning goal in overtime, to make the final score 6–5. Still, at home, Los Angeles lost game four by a score of 6–3. In game five, at San Jose, Los Angeles would win by a score of 3–1. However, that would not be enough, as Joe Thornton of San Jose scored the game-winning goal in overtime of game six to eliminate Los Angeles from the playoffs.\n(3) Detroit Red Wings vs. (6) Phoenix Coyotes.\nThe Detroit Red Wings entered the playoffs as the third seed in the Western Conference after winning the Central Division with 104 points. This was Detroit's 20th straight appearance in the postseason. The Phoenix Coyotes earned the sixth seed with 99 points, losing tiebreakers over the Anaheim Ducks and the Nashville Predators in total regulation + overtime wins (43 to 38). They also lost the tiebreaker to Nashville on goal differential (+25 to +5). This was a rematch of the previous year's Western Conference quarterfinals, in which Detroit defeated Phoenix in seven games.\nThe Red Wings had 13 different goal scorers in the series. This was the only sweep in the first round of the playoffs.\n(4) Anaheim Ducks vs. (5) Nashville Predators.\nThe Anaheim Ducks entered the playoffs as the fourth overall seed in the Western Conference with 99 points, winning tiebreakers over the Nashville Predators and the Phoenix Coyotes in total regulation + overtime wins (43 to 38). The Nashville Predators also earned 99 points during the regular season to finish fifth overall. They lost the tiebreaker to Anaheim by having fewer games won in regulation + overtime (43 to 38) while winning the tiebreaker over the Phoenix Coyotes in goal differential (+25 to +5). This was the first playoff series between these two teams. Nick Spaling's second goal of the game early in the third period of Game 6 gave the Predators the lead and they held on to win the game 4–2. This was Nashville's first playoff series victory in franchise history since entering the league in 1998.\nConference semifinals.\nEastern Conference semifinals.\n(1) Washington Capitals vs. (5) Tampa Bay Lightning.\nThis was the second playoff series between these two teams. Washington and Tampa Bay previously met in the 2003 Eastern Conference quarterfinals, where Tampa Bay defeated Washington in six games. In the six-game regular season series between these teams, Washington won four games (including one win in a shootout). In game one, Sean Bergenheim, the player with the winning goal in game seven against Pittsburgh, opened the scoring for Tampa Bay, but goals from Alexander Semin and Eric Fehr put Washington up 2–1, only for Tampa Bay to regain the lead and win with Steven Stamkos' late second period power play goal. Late in game two, Tampa Bay was up 2–1, when Alexander Ovechkin received a pass from behind the net to tie the game at two, but in overtime, Tampa Bay forward Vincent Lecavalier put in his second goal of the game to win it for Tampa Bay. Game three was a hard-fought game for Washington, after being up 3–2 to start the third period. However, Washington would ultimately lose game three by a score of 4–3. Washington would then lose game four by a score of 5–3, to fall to Tampa Bay in a 4–0 series sweep.\n(2) Philadelphia Flyers vs. (3) Boston Bruins.\nThis was the sixth playoff series between these two teams. It was a rematch of the previous year's Eastern Conference semifinals, in which Philadelphia came back from a 3–0 deficit to beat Boston in seven games. Boston swept Philadelphia out of the playoffs, avenging their blown 3–0 lead to move on to the Eastern Conference Final for the first time since 1992. This series featured some goaltending trouble for Philadelphia; Boston outscored Philadelphia 20–7 in four games. Brian Boucher started the first three games, but was pulled in all three: he was removed from games one and three due to performance, and he was briefly removed from game two due to injury. In all, Philadelphia started three different goaltenders in the 11 games that they played in the 2011 playoffs; six of those games featured a change of goalie.\nWestern Conference semifinals.\n(1) Vancouver Canucks vs. (5) Nashville Predators.\nThis was the first playoff series between these two teams. It was also the first time that the Nashville Predators played in the second round of the playoffs. Vancouver and Nashville had split the four-game regular season series between them. Vancouver won this series in six games to advance to the Conference finals for the first time since 1994. Each game in this series was decided by just a single goal (with the exception of an empty net goal scored by Vancouver in game four).\n(2) San Jose Sharks vs. (3) Detroit Red Wings.\nThis was the fifth playoff series between these two teams. This was a rematch of the previous year's Western Conference semifinals, in which San Jose defeated Detroit in five games. After losing the first three games, Detroit won the next three, to force a seventh game. This was the eighth time this feat had been achieved in NHL history, the third time in the last two seasons, the second time in the 2011 playoffs, and the second time that the Red Wings had accomplished the feat. Chicago had accomplished the same feat against Vancouver in the conference quarterfinals, ultimately losing that series. Since the New York Islanders twice forced a game seven after being down 3–0 during the 1975 Stanley Cup playoffs, there had been 112 consecutive failed attempts to repeat that feat prior to the 2010 Stanley Cup playoffs, after which it has happened in three of the seven possible series. San Jose won the seventh game by a score of 3–2 to avoid becoming the fourth team in NHL history to lose a series after taking a 3–0 series lead. It allowed them their second consecutive trip to the conference finals. Six of the games were decided by only one goal; the only exception was a 3–1 win by Detroit in game six, in which Darren Helm of Detroit scored an empty net goal.\nConference finals.\nEastern Conference final.\n(3) Boston Bruins vs. (5) Tampa Bay Lightning.\nThis was the first playoff series between these teams. Boston won three of the four games that were played in the regular season. Bruins rookie Tyler Seguin scored a goal and an assist in his first career playoff game in game one. In game two, he tied the NHL record for points by a teenager in a single playoff period with four points, two goals and two assists (held by Trevor Linden). Game seven featured remarkable discipline from both teams, as no penalties were called during the game, the first time this had happened in the playoffs in over twenty years. Boston's Nathan Horton recorded his second game-seven-winning goal in this year's playoffs, as his first was scored against Montreal in round one.\nWestern Conference final.\n(1) Vancouver Canucks vs. (2) San Jose Sharks.\nThis was the first playoff series between these teams. Vancouver won three of the four games that were played in the regular season; their only loss to San Jose came in a shootout. Both Vancouver and San Jose played in a series during the 2011 playoffs (Quarterfinals and Semifinals, respectively) where each took a 3–0 series lead, only to see the opposing team win the next three games to force a seventh game. However, both won their respective seventh games to advance to the next round of the playoffs. San Jose, facing elimination in game five, held a 2–1 lead near the end of the game until Ryan Kesler forced overtime by scoring with only 13.2 seconds left in the third period after a controversial icing call. After a scoreless first overtime, Kevin Bieksa was able to capitalize on an unexpected rebound to score the series-winning goal 10:18 into the second overtime, sending Vancouver to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time since 1994. The Canucks had previously won the Western Conference Final on May 24, 1994, 17 years to the day before this year's Conference Final win, and both games went to double overtime.\nStanley Cup Finals.\nAs the Presidents' Trophy winners, the Vancouver Canucks earned home ice advantage over the Boston Bruins in the Finals. This was the first playoff series between Vancouver and Boston. Vancouver and Boston met only once in the 2010–11 regular season, on February 26. Boston won that game by a score of 3–1. This was Vancouver's third appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals; in both of their previous appearances, they lost to a team from New York. In 1982, they were swept by the Islanders. In 1994, they lost to the Rangers in seven games. This was Boston's first appearance in the Finals since their five-game loss to the Edmonton Oilers in 1990. Boston last won the Stanley Cup in 1972, when they defeated the New York Rangers in six games.\nIn a back-and-forth series, the Bruins triumphed in seven games to win their first Stanley Cup since 1972. The Canucks and Bruins each won their first three home games. All three Vancouver wins were close affairs at Rogers Arena: two 1–0 wins in games one and five, and a 3–2 overtime victory in game two. In Boston at the TD Garden however, the games were more one sided, with the Bruins winning games three, four, and six by scores of 8–1, 4–0 and 5–2, respectively. In the deciding Game 7, the Bruins shut out the Canucks 4–0 to win the Stanley Cup.\nPlayer statistics.\nSkaters.\nThese are the top ten skaters based on points. If the list exceeds ten skaters because of a tie in points, goals take precedence, and all the tied skaters are shown.\nGoaltending.\nThis is a combined table of the top five goaltenders based on goals against average and the top five goaltenders based on save percentage, with at least 420 minutes played. The table is sorted by GAA, and the criteria for inclusion are bolded.\nTelevision.\nNational Canadian English-language coverage of the first three rounds of the playoffs were split between CBC and TSN. CBC held exclusive rights to the Stanley Cup Finals. French-language telecasts were broadcast on RDS and RDS2.\nIn the United States, national coverage was split between NBC and Versus, with NBC also airing the first two and final three games of the Stanley Cup Finals, while Versus broadcast games three and four. This was the last postseason that only selected first and second-round games were nationally televised, as well as the last postseason American regional sports networks carrying both their teams' first- and second-round games. After Comcast, the owners of Versus, completed its acquisition of a majority stake in NBC Universal, the combined company signed a new TV contract in April 2011. Among the new changes for 2012, all playoff games will air nationally for the first time on either NBC or one of NBC Universal's cable channels, and the regional sports networks will be limited to only airing first-round games."

        "text": "The 2011 Stanley Cup Finals was the championship series of the National Hockey League's (NHL) , and the culmination of the 2011 Stanley Cup playoffs. The Eastern Conference champion Boston Bruins defeated the Western Conference champion Vancouver Canucks four games to three. The Bruins ended a 39-year Stanley Cup drought with the victory. Bruins goaltender Tim Thomas was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the Most Valuable Player of the playoffs.\nThe Canucks had home ice advantage in the Finals by winning the Presidents' Trophy as the team that finished with the best regular season record (117 points). They were also the first Canadian team to have home ice advantage in the Finals since the Montreal Canadiens had it for the 1993 Stanley Cup Finals. The Canucks were also the last Canadian team to reach the Finals until 2021. \nOn June 1, 2011, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman made an announcement that Colin Campbell would be stepping down as the league's head disciplinarian to be replaced by former player Brendan Shanahan, though Campbell would continue in his job as director of hockey operations. Mike Murphy, the NHL vice-president of hockey operations, had already been put in charge of disciplinary matters for the Finals, nonetheless there were concerns raised about Campbell's impartiality in handing out discipline since his son, Gregory, was an active player on the Boston Bruins roster.\nThe series began on June 1 and ended on June 15. The games varied widely between those played in Vancouver and those in Boston. Prior to game seven, the Bruins scored two goals in three games played in Vancouver, against 17 scored in three games at Boston. On the other hand, while posting two shutouts in Vancouver, Canucks goaltender Roberto Luongo was replaced with the backup Cory Schneider twice in three games in Boston. The Bruins scored almost three times the number of total goals as the Canucks, (23–8 in the series), but the Canucks won three games. The eight goals scored by Vancouver is the lowest number of goals scored by any team in a seven-game series in NHL history. It was the fourth consecutive Stanley Cup Finals in which the road team won the Stanley Cup.\nPaths to the Finals.\nBoston Bruins.\nThe Bruins finished the regular season as the Northeast Division champion with 103 points, earning the third seed in the Eastern Conference. In their 33rd postseason meeting, Boston eliminated their bitter rivals, the Montreal Canadiens, in the first round of the playoffs in seven games. The Bruins went on to sweep the Philadelphia Flyers in the second round, outscoring the Flyers 20–7 in four games. Later, in the Eastern Conference Finals, Boston defeated the Tampa Bay Lightning in seven games.\nThis was the eighteenth appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals for the Bruins, and their first since , which they lost in five games to the Edmonton Oilers. It also allowed Boston to join Philadelphia as being the only cities to have all their teams play in each of the four major North American professional sports leagues' title rounds since 2000, following the Patriots in Super Bowls XXXVI in 2002, XXXVIII in 2004, XXXIX in 2005, and XLII in 2008. The Red Sox winning World Series titles in , , and the Celtics in the NBA Finals in and and winning in 2008.\nThe Bruins won their sixth Cup championship, and their first one since defeating the New York Rangers in in six games, which made Boston the first city to have championships in each of the four leagues in the new millennium.\nVancouver Canucks.\nThe Canucks, in their 41st season, finished the regular season with the best record at 117 points, winning their first Presidents' Trophy in team history. In the first round of the playoffs, the Canucks met the Chicago Blackhawks for the third consecutive postseason, losing both previous series in six games. After Vancouver won the first three games, Chicago won the next three to force a seventh game. Vancouver won the seventh game in overtime on a goal by Alex Burrows to avoid becoming the fourth team in NHL history to lose a series after taking a 3–0 series lead. The Canucks then eliminated the Nashville Predators in six games during the conference semifinals, with each game in that series decided by just a single goal (with the exception of an empty net goal scored by Vancouver in Game 4). Vancouver then went on to defeat the San Jose Sharks in the Western Conference Finals in five games.\nThis was Vancouver's third appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals. They appeared in the Finals against New York-based teams with the Islanders in and the Rangers in losing both series in four and seven games respectively. The most recent Canada-based NHL team to win the Stanley Cup was the Montreal Canadiens in . The Canucks were the first team from Canada to make it to the Finals since the Ottawa Senators in .\nWith Vancouver hosting the 2010 Winter Olympics, the Canucks hoped to mirror the other two Olympic Games held in Canada in which the host city's NHL team won the Stanley Cup the proceeding year. Montreal hosted the 1976 Summer Olympics and the following year, the Canadiens won the Stanley Cup. The Calgary Flames won the Stanley Cup in , the previous year Calgary hosted the 1988 Winter Olympics.\nWith the loss, Vancouver became the third team to lose in the Finals after winning the Presidents' Trophy, after the Bruins in and the Detroit Red Wings in .\nTriple Gold Club.\nCenter Patrice Bergeron became the twenty-fifth player to enter the \"Triple Gold Club\", consisting of individuals who have won the Stanley Cup along with gold medals at the Winter Olympics, and World Championships, as a result of the Bruins winning the series. Bergeron also won gold medals as a teammate of Vancouver Canucks' goaltender Roberto Luongo at the 2004 Worlds and 2010 Olympics with Team Canada. Luongo – who also won the 2003 Worlds – would have become the first goaltender ever to enter the \"Triple Gold Club\", had the Canucks won. Both Luongo and Bergeron later got a second Olympic gold in the 2014 Winter Olympics.\nGame summaries.\nGame one.\nRaffi Torres's goal with 18.5 seconds left in regulation broke a scoreless tie to give the Canucks the victory. The entire game was seen as a duel between the two opposing goaltenders; both Vancouver's Roberto Luongo and Boston's Tim Thomas were Vezina Trophy finalists for the 2010–11 season. Thomas stopped 33 of 34 shots while Luongo made 36 saves for his third shutout of the 2011 playoffs. Both of Luongo's two previous shutouts of the 2011 playoffs had also occurred in a game one (a 2–0 victory against Chicago in the first round, and a 1–0 victory against Nashville in the second round). This was the first time since that the opening game of the Cup Finals was scoreless through two periods.\nBoth teams killed off all penalties in the game, including a five-on-three power play Boston had in the second period, and a double minor high-sticking penalty called on Vancouver's Daniel Sedin in the first. At the end of the first period, Vancouver's Alex Burrows was called for a double minor roughing penalty on Boston's Patrice Bergeron, while Bergeron also got a roughing minor. Replays showed that Burrows could have bit Bergeron's finger, but the evidence was inconclusive. Despite Bergeron's pleading to the referees, no additional penalty was assessed to Burrows. However, despite biting being a suspendible offense, Burrows did not receive a suspension from the NHL on the grounds that no conclusive evidence that Burrows actually bit Bergeron could be found.\nGame two.\nIn the second-fastest overtime in Stanley Cup Finals history, Alex Burrows scored 11 seconds into the first overtime to give Vancouver a 3–2 win. Burrows faked a shot, causing Boston goalie Tim Thomas to move out of position, then skated around the net to put the puck into the empty net for the game-winning goal; Thomas was not able to recover his position. This was Burrows's second goal of the game. He opened the scoring with a goal in the first period during the final seconds of a power play. Boston responded with two goals in the second period, one by Milan Lucic and a power play goal by Mark Recchi. However, Daniel Sedin tied the score at 2–2 about midway through the third period.\nThe game featured the return of Vancouver's Manny Malhotra, who had not played a game since March 16, when he suffered a severe eye injury after taking a puck to the face. Both Thomas and Roberto Luongo stopped 30 of 33 shots and 28 of 30 shots, respectively. With his second period goal, 43-year-old Recchi became the oldest player to score in the Cup Finals.\nBefore the game, the Boston Red Sox baseball club moved their game against the Oakland Athletics at Fenway Park from 7:10 p.m. EDT to 1:10 p.m. EDT to allow for Bruins fans to watch the game.\nGame three.\nBoston scored four goals in the second period, and another four goals in the third, which resulted in an 8–1 rout. Mark Recchi scored two of them; Brad Marchand and Daniel Paille each scored shorthanded; and Andrew Ference, David Krejci, Chris Kelly and Michael Ryder each tallied one of the other four. Tim Thomas stopped 40 out of 41 shots, only allowing a third period goal by Jannik Hansen.\nAt 05:07 into the first period, Vancouver's Aaron Rome received a major penalty for interference and a game misconduct for a blindside hit to the head of Boston's Nathan Horton. Horton was taken off the ice on a stretcher and was then transported to a hospital for further observation. However, the Bruins did not score on the ensuing five-minute power play. Following a disciplinary hearing on June 7, Rome was given a four-game suspension for the late hit which assured that he'd miss the remainder of the 2011 playoffs, the first multi-game suspension in the history of the Stanley Cup Finals. Rome and the Canucks maintained that the play was a good hit that went bad, but the NHL determined that the hit came more than a second after Horton gave up the puck. The NHL considers a hit to be late if it comes more than half a second after a player gives up possession.\nIn contrast to game two, which featured only 10 minutes of penalties for the entire game, game three had 145 total penalty minutes, the most in a Cup Final game since 1990. The 8–1 score was the biggest goal differential in the Stanley Cup Finals since , when the Colorado Avalanche defeated the Florida Panthers in game two by the same score.\nGame four.\nTim Thomas made 38 saves and Rich Peverley scored two goals as Boston shut out Vancouver, 4–0, to even the series. Roberto Luongo, who stopped only 16 out of 20 shots, was replaced by backup goalie Cory Schneider after giving up the fourth Boston goal at 03:39 of the third period.\nGame five.\nRoberto Luongo made 31 saves and Maxim Lapierre scored the game's only goal to give Vancouver a 3–2 series lead. This was the second 1–0 victory for Vancouver in the Finals; game one ended with the same score. Lapierre's goal came at 04:35 into the third period. Kevin Bieksa's shot went wide and rebounded off the end boards to Lapierre on the other side of the net, who then beat Tim Thomas after the Boston goalie was unable to recover his position in time. Thomas made 24 saves in the loss.\nLuongo joined Frank McCool as the only goalie to have two 1–0 shutouts in the Stanley Cup Finals; McCool's victories came 66 years earlier in .\nGame six.\nBoston defeated Vancouver 5–2 in TD Garden to force a deciding seventh game, the 16th in Finals history. The Bruins scored four goals in a span of 4:14 in the first period, breaking the record for the quickest four goals tallied by one team in the Cup Finals. For the second time in the series, Roberto Luongo was replaced by backup goalie Cory Schneider; this came after Luongo gave up Boston's third goal at 08:35.\nVancouver's Mason Raymond suffered a fractured vertebra 20 seconds into the game on an awkward hit into the boards by Johnny Boychuk, and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.\nGame seven.\nIn Boston's first seventh game of a Stanley Cup Finals, Tim Thomas made 37 saves as Boston shut out Vancouver, 4–0, to win the Stanley Cup. Patrice Bergeron and Brad Marchand each scored two goals for Boston. Bergeron scored first at 14:37 in the first period, then had a shorthanded goal at 17:35 in the second. Marchand's first goal came at 12:13 of the second period; he then scored on an empty net late in the third. Roberto Luongo stopped 17 out of 20 shots in the loss. The game was the last of Mark Recchi's 22-year NHL career; he announced his retirement immediately afterward, during the post-game celebration.\nTelevision.\nIn Canada, the series was televised in English on CBC and in French on the cable network RDS. In the United States, NBC broadcast the first two and final three games, while Versus (now NBCSN) televised games three and four.\nRatings.\nGame one on NBC drew the best television ratings for a first game since game one of the 1999 Stanley Cup Finals, drawing a 3.2 rating, up 14 percent from game one of the Finals. The rating was boosted by heavy interest in Boston's large market, which posted a 25.5/39, topping the 19.1/34 for game one of the 2010 NBA Finals between the Boston Celtics and the Los Angeles Lakers.\nIn contrast, game two drew just 3.37 million viewers for NBC, making it the least-watched Stanley Cup Finals broadcast on U.S. network television since game five in , which also was the last time a Canadian team (the Ottawa Senators) advanced to the Cup Finals.\nGames six, five and one are the third, fourth, and fifth most-watched CBC Sports programs with an average Canadian audience of 6.6 million, 6.1 million, and 5.6 million viewers respectively, after the men's ice hockey gold medal game between Canada and the United States at the 2002 Winter Olympics. Game seven was the highest rated game on both sides of the border. In Canada, it was second most-watched CBC Sports program, drawing an average of 8.76 million viewers and trailing only the men's gold medal game in ice hockey at the 2002 Winter Olympics; In the US, NBC's broadcast drew a 5.7 national overnight rating and a 10 share (numbers that equaled game seven of the 2003 Stanley Cup Finals), a number later updated to 8.5 million viewers, making the game the most watched NHL broadcast in the US since 1973. In the Boston market alone, the broadcast pulled in a 43.4 rating and a 64 share.\nVancouver riots.\nThe final game of the series attracted huge crowds on the streets of Vancouver who gathered to watch the game on outside monitors and cheer the home team on. Shortly before the game ended with the apparent loss for Vancouver, fires were set on West Georgia Street. After the game ended, cars were set on fire and fighting broke out. Soon, a riot was in progress in downtown Vancouver, with police cars set on fire, shops looted and attendant destruction of property. The damage was expected to be greater than the 1994 Vancouver riots that occurred after Vancouver lost the Stanley Cup Finals to the New York Rangers.\nTeam rosters.\nYears indicated in boldface under the \"Finals appearance\" column signify that the player won the Stanley Cup in the given year.\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe 2011 Stanley Cup was presented to Boston Bruins' captain Zdeno Chara by NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman following the Bruins' 4–0 win over the Vancouver Canucks in the seventh game of the finals.\nThe following Bruins players and staff had their names engraved on the Stanley Cup\n2010–11 Boston Bruins"

It is primarily used for baseball, and is the home field of the Old Dominion Monarchs baseball team. The Monarchs are members of the Sun Belt Conference. The ballpark has seating for 2,500 spectators in three sections of raised aluminum bleachers. The stadium complex also includes locker rooms, a concession stand, offices, four batting cages, a picnic area and a fully enclosed press box. The facility replaced the university's football stadium, Foreman Field, as the home of the baseball team.\nThe ballpark is named after former Old Dominion head basketball coach, baseball manager, and athletic director Bud Metheny, who worked for the university from 1948 to 1980 after an eleven-year stint in the New York Yankees organization including a World Series championship in 1943. He compiled a record of 423 wins, 363 losses and 6 ties as manager of the Monarchs. Metheny's jersey number, 3, has been retired by the university and is displayed on the right field wall of the stadium.\nThe stadium opened for the 1983 baseball season, with the first game being a 7–2 Old Dominion win over Millersville University. The complex was not dedicated until April 25, 1984 with a game against the Virginia Tech Hokies. That night's crowd of 2,125 is the highest attendance in stadium history. The ballpark hosted the Sun Belt Conference baseball tournament in 1983, 1985, and 1987, and the Colonial Athletic Association baseball tournament in 1994. Old Dominion defended home field and won the 1985 Sun Belt and 1994 Colonial championships. The stadium has also hosted multiple Virginia district and state high school baseball tournaments. The Monarchs tied the NCAA record for double plays completed in a single game on May 14, 1985, with 7 during a home game against the Western Kentucky Hilltoppers. There have been eight no-hitters pitched at the stadium, all completed by Monarch pitchers. As of the completion of the 2021 season, Old Dominion has a record of 850 wins and 370 losses at the Bud, for a winning percentage of .697.\nThe stadium received a new video-LED scoreboard for the 2009 season as part of a partnership between Old Dominion and CBS Collegiate Sports Properties. The facility underwent an additional three million-dollar renovation for the 2011 season that erected a batters' backdrop in center field, locker room refurbishments and a beer garden. Renovations continued before the 2012 season included brick walls added down the foul lines, a clock above the scoreboard, and a custom outfield wall with images of former Monarchs who have played in the major leagues."

The current head coach is Darren Bilawchuk. The program has won the most Canada West conference championships with 14 and the most U Sports national championships with eight.\nOn January 25, 2011, it was announced that the 1999-2000 University of Alberta Pandas hockey team would be inducted into the Alberta Hockey Hall of Fame.\nEarly years.\nIn the era of the First World War, the University of Alberta formed men's ice hockey and women's ice hockey teams. The women's team played many community based teams.\nThe University of Alberta played the Edmonton Monarchs in the Monarchs first ever game in 1918.\nThe city of Edmonton would organize women's ice hockey into three divisions in 1930: junior, intermediate and senior. The Edmonton Monarchs and the University of Alberta were the only teams that comprised the senior division. In that same year, the University of Alberta would challenge the Edmonton Monarchs for the Alpine Cup. The Monarchs prevailed by a 1–0 score. By 1934, the University of Alberta was demoted to the intermediate division.\nIn 1937, the University of Alberta competed for the Alpine Cup, contested at the Banff Winter Carnival. The club lost to the Calgary Avenue Grills team.\nU Sports.\nOn March 14, 2004, the Pandas won their third consecutive National Championship and their fourth in five years. The Pandas became the first team to win three consecutive championships which remains unmatched as of 2020. The win came courtesy of a 2–0 tally over the Ottawa Gee-Gees. For the season, the Pandas went 20–0–0 in Canada West play, 7–0 in the postseason, and a 35–0–0 overall mark.\nU Sports Player of the Year Danielle Bourgeois scored both goals in the game as Alberta outshot Ottawa 45–14 overall. The game-winning goal was assisted by Canadian national team member Delaney Collins. With the triumph, the Pandas ran their undefeated streak against U Sports opponents to 81 games. During the streak, their last loss to a U Sports team was on Oct. 13, 2001.\nOn March 14, 2010, the Pandas won the Canadian Interuniversity Sport women's ice hockey championship which was their seventh title in the 13 years since the tournament's inception. In the gold-medal game, they defeated the McGill Martlets by a score of 2–0. While the program did not have as much of a dominant national run in the next decade, the team managed to claim their eighth national championship in 2017 after once again defeating the Martlets in double overtime by a score of 2–1. It was also the first time that the Pandas had won the National championship while not winning their conference championship in the same year.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada and financial reasons, the University of Alberta announced that the Pandas would not participate in the 2020–21 season, if one were to be held.\nFormer Pandas Hockey defender, Taylor Kezama, a 2017 U Sports National Champion, and a 2019 Canada West champion, was one of 18 former U Sports student-athletes announced among the inaugural participants of the U SPORTS Female Apprenticeship Coach Program.\nPandas in pro hockey.\nPandas selected in the CWHL Draft.\nThe following were selected in the 2010 CWHL Draft."

He was the son of Christian and Dora Fischer.\nProfessional baseball.\nFischer played professional baseball in 1884 for Johnstown of the Iron &amp; Oil Association. He may have also played for a Williamsport club.\nIn the summer of 1884, he joined the Philadelphia Keystones of the Union Association. He made his major-league debut against Cincinnati on July 17, 1884, pitching a complete game, striking out six batters and giving up six runs. After the game, \"The Philadelphia Times\" wrote that the game was marked by very poor fielding (eight errors by the Keystones) and that Fischer would have won the game had he \"been properly supported.\" His sole major-league victory was on July 28, 1884, against the Washington Nationals at Washington, DC. \"The Philadelphia Times\" reported on Fischer's performance as follows: \"Fisher pitched a magnificent game, his swift balls completely demoralizing the Washingtonians.\" Fisher appeared in eight games as a starting pitcher for the Keystones, compiling a 1-7 win-loss record with eight complete games, a 3.57 earned run average (ERA), and 42 strikeouts. His 3.57 ERA was second best on the Keystones' pitching staff. He also appeared in two games at first base for the Keystones. At the plate, he compiled a .222 batting average and .278 on-base percentage in 39 plate appearances with the Keystones.\nAfter the Keystones folded on August 7, Fischer joined the Continentals. On August 30, 1884, he \"made a remarkable record, striking out eighteen . . . while but one safe hit was made off him.\"\nIn 1885, Fisher played semipro baseball for the Molineaux club. He briefly returned to Major League Baseball as a pitcher for the Buffalo Bisons of the National League. He started one game for the Bisons on August 6, 1885, on the road against at Philadelphia, and gave up nine runs in 10 innings. \"The Times\" of Philadelphia described Fischer's appearance as follows: \"Fisher, a local amateur pitcher, was given a trial by the visiting club and he did fairly well.\"\nFor his career, Fischer started nine major-league games as a pitcher, compiling a 1-8 record with a 3.73 ERA and 46 strikeouts in 79-2/3 innings pitched.\nIn 1886, he appeared in 10 games for the Williamsport club of the Pennsylvania State Association. He compiled a 2-1 record and 1.08 ERA during the 1886 season.\nFamily and later years.\nFischer was married to Mary (Hepburn) Fischer. They lived in Philadelphia.

        "title": "Clarkson Golden Knights women's ice hockey",
        "text": "The Clarkson Golden Knights women's hockey team is an NCAA Division I ice hockey team that represents Clarkson University in rural Potsdam, New York. The Golden Knights have been a member of ECAC Hockey since 2004, and play home games in Cheel Arena on the Clarkson University campus.\nHistory.\nSeasons 2003–04 to 2007–08.\nWhile men's ice hockey has existed for a long time at Clarkson University as an NCAA Division I sport, women's ice hockey had only existed at Clarkson as a varsity sport from 1974 to 1984, long before the women's game was at all formalized. During the varsity era, the team posted a record of 77–72–3. A club team started in the 1995–96 season and existed until the sport regained varsity status. As neither the university nor the NCAA consider the original varsity team or the club team continuous with the current one all statistics and records do not carry over from either era.\nIn 2003, Clarkson announced that it would, for the first time, field a Division I women's ice hockey team. Under head coach Rick Seeley, the team began play in the 2003–04 season. Playing as an independent, the team was able to post a respectable 16–12–3 despite being composed almost entirely of freshmen. For the 2004–05 season, Clarkson entered the ECAC (at the time known as the ECACHL), where it has played ever since. Despite struggling somewhat in its first year in the league, Clarkson was able to finish in 8th place in the conference and claim the final spot in the conference tournament, where it would be eliminated in the quarterfinals in two games by top-seeded and eventual conference champion Harvard.\nClarkson's true success as a team began in the 2005–06 season. Compiling an overall record of 22–14–1 and a conference record of 12–8–0, Clarkson was able to finish in a tie for 3rd place (5th on tie-breaks) in the ECAC. Highlighting the season was a weekend sweep of conference powerhouses Harvard and Dartmouth and a home victory over then top-ranked St. Lawrence. Only a last-second overtime loss to Harvard in the final game of the regular season prevented Clarkson from clinching both outright 3rd place and home ice for the quarterfinals of the ECAC tournament. Forced to travel for the second season in a row to Harvard for the quarterfinals, the Golden Knights dropped the first game before winning the second game in overtime, only to see their season come to an end with a double overtime loss in game 3.\nWhile the 2006–07 team was not as successful as its predecessor, it was still able to finish with a 10–10–2 conference record (18–15–3 overall), good for 6th place in the conference (7th on tie-breaks) and a third straight bid into the ECAC tournament, where they would again be eliminated in the quarterfinal round, this time in two games by St. Lawrence. The 2007–08 season would see continued success for the Golden Knights, whose 13–6–3 conference record (24–9–5 overall) earned them fourth place in the ECAC, which in turn earned them home ice for the first time ever in the quarterfinals of the ECAC tournament. Despite dropping game 1 against Princeton, a team they had never beaten, Clarkson was able to battle back with two one goal wins to record their first ever playoff series victory two games to one. The Golden Knights would then be eliminated in the single game conference semifinals at Harvard with a 0–3 loss.\nThe 2007–08 season would mark the end of an era for Clarkson, as head coach Rick Seeley left for the head coaching job at Quinnipiac at the end of the season. Immediately following his departure, Clarkson announced that he would be replaced by assistant coaches Shannon &amp; Matt Desrosiers, who would form the first husband and wife co-head coaching duo in NCAA women's ice hockey.\nSeasons 2008–09 to 2013–14.\nUnder the new coaches, the 2008–09 campaign was less successful for the Golden Knights, although they still enjoyed another winning season and spot in the ECAC tournament. Backed by very strong defense and goaltending, Clarkson finished 16–14–6 overall and 10–8–4 conference record finish 7th in the ECAC. The team would bow out of the conference tournament in two games to St. Lawrence in the quarterfinals to end their season.\nThe 2009–10 team enjoyed unprecedented success. Featuring a team full of seniors, Clarkson posted a 23–12–5 overall record and a 14–5–3 conference record, just short of their first ECAC regular season championship. Entering the ECAC tournament as the second seed, they won the quarterfinals in three games over rivals St. Lawrence before hosting, and defeating, Harvard University in the semifinals. Advancing to their first ever conference championship game, Clarkson would fall 3–4 in overtime against top-seeded Cornell. Despite being denied their first conference championship, the Golden Knights season was good enough to earn them a bid to their first ever NCAA tournament. Going on the road to face third-seeded Minnesota, a team that had shut out the Golden Knights the two times they had met earlier that year, Clarkson rallied from a 0–2 deficit to force overtime before falling 2–3 in the extra session to close the best Clarkson season up until that time.\nThe loss of the 2009–10 seniors to graduation caused Clarkson to suffer a slow start to the 2010–11 season, which ultimately cost the team its streak of 5 consecutive winning seasons, as the team would finish 14–17–6. The team did eventually recover down the stretch, and they were able to finish 10–8–4 in ECAC play, which was good enough for 6th place, which improved them to 7 for 7 in making ECAC tournaments. Despite an encouraging 4–1 victory in game 1 at Dartmouth, Clarkson would be eliminated in the quarterfinals of the ECAC tournament, dropping game 2 and game 3, the latter being a 3–4 loss in overtime. This team was notable for featuring freshmen Jamie Lee Rattray, Carly Mercer, and goaltender Erica Howe, all of whom would play a major role for Clarkson over the next three seasons.\nThe 2011–12 season would offer a glimpse of what would come over the next couple seasons for the Golden Knights, finishing 22–10–5 overall. In conference play, Clarkson totaled their greatest number of wins and points at the time with a 15–5–2 record, which landed them in third place. The team's postseason troubles from previous years, however, finally came to a head as they crashed out at home in three games in the quarterfinals of the conference tournament against sixth-seeded Quinnipiac. This loss not only ended their hopes for a conference title, but also ensured that the team would miss the NCAA tournament.\nThe 2012–13 season continued to build on the success from the previous year and set team records for wins, conference wins, and conference points with overall and conference records of 28–10–0 and 18–4–0 respectively. The conference record helped Clarkson finish in a tie for second in the ECAC, only missing first by one point. In the conference quarterfinals, the team completed its first ever sweep of an opponent, as it defeated RPI in two games at home, before losing in Ithaca, NY (starting with the 2012 tournament, the top-seeded team has hosted the semifinals and finals of the ECAC tournament) to the Harvard Crimson 2–4. The impressive season was good enough to earn Clarkson an at large-bid to the NCAA tournament, where they visited third-seeded, and eventual runners-up, Boston University in the quarterfinals. They lost 3–5, closing out what was, at the time, arguably the best season in team history.\nThe 2013–14 season was certainly the best in team history and arguably the best season for any team in any sport in the history of Clarkson University. In a season that saw two players, Rattray and defenseman Erin Ambrose, a sophomore, be named All-Americans, Clarkson, backed by a strong group of seniors that had begun to play together in the 2010–11 season, Clarkson set team records in overall number of games played wins, and wins percentage win percentage with an overall record of 31–5–5, as well as winning their first ever ECAC regular season title, with a conference record of 16–2–4. The title, which was clinched on the last day of the regular season with a 2–1 overtime win over heavy underdogs Union, gave Clarkson the top-seed in the ECAC playoffs which gave Clarkson, after sweeping Dartmouth in the tournament quarterfinals, the right to host both the semifinals and the finals of the ECAC tournament. In a result that was not surprising but a score that was, Clarkson defeated nationally ranked and NCAA tournament hopeful Quinnipiac 6–0 in the semifinal game, giving Clarkson a chance to play in its second ever ECAC Championship game. The victory, however, came at a cost as Ambrose was lost late in the game for the remainder of the season. Clarkson's hopes for its first ECAC tournament championship were ended by Cornell in the championship game by a score of 0–1. Despite the loss, Clarkson's season was strong enough not only to ensure that would the team make the NCAA tournament, but also to ensure that the team would be seeded in the tournament for the first time. Entering the tournament as the three-seed, Clarkson hosted its first NCAA tournament game against Boston College, which they won 3–1, earning their first trip to the Frozen Four which was held in Hamden, CT. In the semifinal game, they faced Mercyhurst, where, despite falling behind 0–1 early, Clarkson was able to win 5–1 and advance to face two-time defending national champion and top-seeded Minnesota. On the day before the national championship game, Rattray made team history by winning the Patty Kazmaier Award, women's collegiate ice hockey's top award. In a closely fought national championship game, Clarkson was able to prevail 5–4 to win the program's as well as the university's first national championship. In the process, the team also became the first team from outside the WCHA to win the women's National Collegiate national championship.\nSeasons 2014–15 to present.\nOn April 21, 2014, almost a month after the national championship victory, it was announced that Shannon Desrosiers would step down as co-head coach, leaving her husband Matt in full control of the team. The decision was made in order for Shannon to spend more time raising the couple's daughter and soon-to-be-born second child. Despite this loss, the loss of an assistant coach, and the loss of arguably the most talented class in program history, Clarkson was still able to muster a respectable season in 2014–15, finishing 24–11–3 overall. A win over Harvard in the last game of the regular season gave the Golden Knights a conference record of 16–4–2, earning them a split of the regular season conference championship with the Crimson and a number one seed in the conference tournament. While they were able to sweep Dartmouth for the second year in a row in the conference quarterfinals, the Golden Knights ultimately fell in the conference semifinals to Cornell 1–3. Despite the loss, the Golden Knights still earned their third straight at-large bid into the NCAA tournament, where they fell in the quarterfinals against second-seeded Boston College 1–5.\nThe 2015–16 saw Clarkson start out with a team record nine straight wins, before the winning streak was snapped in a 0–0 tie with Harvard. The team pushed the unbeaten streak to 12 games before a shocking 1–2 loss to RPI, a team which had not made the ECAC tournament in two years. The rest of 2015 saw Clarkson struggle to get on track in ECAC play, entering the holiday break at just .500 in conference play. The team rebounded in the second half, rattling off a 14-game unbeaten streak to finish the regular season at 26–3–5 overall, the team's best ever regular season record. Unlike their previous best regular season in 2013–14, however, they finished second in the conference with a 14–3–5 record, behind Quinnipiac. The ECAC quarterfinals saw Clarkson earn their fourth consecutive sweep, this time over Cornell, exacting some revenge for the previous two season's ECAC tournament exits. The ECAC semifinals saw Clarkson advance for the first time ever in an ECAC tournament away from home with a 5–2 win over Colgate. They were, however, denied an ECAC title for the third straight title game by Quinnipiac in a 0–1 defeat that saw both teams register season lows for shots (17 for Quinnipiac versus 16 for Clarkson). For the fourth straight year Clarkson gained an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament. Their quarterfinal game was a rematch of the ECAC championship game, also being played at Quinnipiac. This time, however, it was Clarkson who gained the 1–0 victory by holding Quinnipiac to only 14 shots. The quarterfinal win, which was their first ever postseason victory as the away team (not counting single game wins in best-of-three series they ultimately lost) sent them to their second Frozen Four. There, they hoped to repeat their magic from 2013–14 as they face a 39–0–0 Boston College team. Despite jumping out to a 2–0 lead, and leading until late in the third period, they ultimately fell 2–3 in overtime, ending their season and the collegiate careers of their most successful class. Their final record for the season was 30–5–5.\nGraduation of another talented class, the first to make the NCAA tournament all four years it played for Clarkson, left the team entering 2016–17 season with much uncertainty. Despite this uncertainty, they still started the season ranked 5th. Although they dropped an exhibition game for only the second time in program history and for the first time since before their first season, Clarkson won their first two official games against Penn State to move up to fourth. Following this, however, the team lost a game and only managed to tie another on an extra-attacker goal in a nonconference home-and-home against rival St. Lawrence, before falling in two games at home to top-ranked Wisconsin. This dropped them to 2–3–1 and eighth overall. Two 3–1 against at New Hampshire wins the next weekend stabilized the situation, but failed to give any indication that Clarkson would be among the nation's elites on the season. Something clicked, however, in the following eight games that saw Clarkson win all eight while not being held below four goals a single time and scoring eight goals twice. Combined with the two wins against UNH, Clarkson set a new program record for longest win streak at ten while also earning their coach his 200th all-time win. The win streak came to an end with a 3–3 tie against Robert Morris in the semifinal game of the Windjammer Classic. Clarkson won that game's shoutout, the program's first ever, and advanced to the championship of the tournament, where they bested Vermont 3–1 for their first ever in-season tournament championship. The following weekend saw them clash with the only remaining undefeated team in the country, third-ranked St. Lawrence. After escaping with another extra-attacker goal tie in the first game, Clarkson sent the Saints to their first loss with a 4–1 win, giving them the frontrunner position in the ECAC. Clarkson pushed its unbeaten streak to 18, tying the second longest such streak in program history, before falling to Cornell. A period of lackluster play in the following weeks against the conference's weakest teams resulted in wins until Clarkson escaped with a 2–2 tie via another extra-attacker goal against a struggling Harvard team. This left them only one point ahead of St. Lawrence in the standings entering into the second-to-last weekend of the season. The team snapped out of its funk to defeat both Princeton and Quinnipiac. Coupled with a St. Lawrence tie and loss, this gave Clarkson their third ECAC Regular Season title. Clarkson won its remaining two games the next weekend to finish with a 19–1–2 conference record, easily the best in its history. Clarkson easily dispatched ECAC eight-seed RPI in the ECAC Quarterfinals to reach the semifinals for the fifth-straight year. Clarkson then dispatched Princeton 4–0 in the semifinals for their fourth try at an ECAC Championship and their third such try against Cornell. Clarkson reversed their previous championship game results to win 1–0 and claim their first championship. Their first auto-bid to the NCAA Tournament gained them the two-seed. The quarterfinals of this tournament featured a rematch of the ECAC Championship Game against Cornell, which was again won by Clarkson, this time by a score of 3–1. The win sent them to the third Frozen Four. They met Minnesota in the semifinals in a rematch of the 2014 Championship Game, with Clarkson again prevailing, this time by a score of 4–3. In the championship game they met top-seeded Wisconsin. Riding a 41-save performance from their goaltender, Shea Tiley, Clarkson won their second national title by a score of 3–0. On offense for the season, the Golden Knights were led by senior Cayley Mercer, who finished second all-time on the team for points with 178 and first for goals with 80. She ended the season tied for most points in the NCAA and as Clarkson's second-ever finalist for the Patty Kazmaier Award.\nYear by year.\n \nCurrent roster.\n&lt;section end=roster /&gt;"

        "text": "The 2015 IAAF World Championships (), the fifteenth edition of the IAAF World Championships, were held from 22 to 30 August at the National Stadium in Beijing, China. Forty-three nations won medals, 144 of which were awarded. Kenya topped the medal table for the first time, with 7 gold, 6 silver and 3 bronze medals. The United States won 18 medals, six gold, six silver and six bronze, which was the highest tally. Host nation China, finished 11th on the medals table, while Russia finished ninth.\n205 IAAF member countries and territories participated, two more than in 2013, with new IAAF member, Kosovo, making its debut. South Sudan was also set to participate for the first time, but its sole athlete did not show up in Beijing.\nEritrea won their first world title at these championships, with Ghirmay Ghebreslassie winning the men's marathon.\nThe event was the largest sporting event to take place at the Beijing National Stadium (\"Bird's Nest\") since the 2008 Summer Olympics.\nBidding process.\nWhen the seeking deadline passed on 15 March 2010, three candidate cities (Beijing, London and Chorzów) had confirmed their candidatures. London then withdrew citing that they didn't want to seem to be biased towards the bids for the Olympic Stadium by committing themselves to an athletics event, as the host for this event was to be announced before their 2011 stadium bid deadline. London then stated that they would bid for 2017 and had the blessing of the IAAF to do so. The IAAF announced Beijing as the winning candidate at the IAAF Council Meeting in Monaco on 20 November 2010.\nThe Council of IAAF approved the dates of 22 August until 30 August 2015.\nVenue.\nThe event was primarily held at the Beijing National Stadium, which served as the athletics venue during the 2008 Summer Olympics. Weather concerns prompted a reduction in capacity for the World Championships in Athletics; only the lower and middle tiers of the stadium were open, capping the venue at around 54,000 spectators rather than its capacity of 80,000. Tickets for the championships were available in three price categories, ranging from 50 RMB to 500 RMB.\nParticipating nations.\nTwo hundred and seven countries (or, more accurately, IAAF members) with a total of 1,933 athletes were entered. Of those 1,771 athletes from 205 countries actually competed (thus excluding reserve athletes and non-starters). The biggest delegation was the one from the US with 130 athletes. Two countries, Ghana and South Sudan, were set to participate, but none of their athletes showed up. The number of athletes per nation is shown in parentheses.\nAnti-doping.\nAs part of the event, the IAAF conducted a wide-reaching anti-doping programme. This included information-led targeted tests in the months previous to the championships and testing of athletes in and outside of competition during the championships. In total, the IAAF undertook 1,405 instances of athlete doping controls in Beijing. This included 662 blood tests to inform the longitudinal athlete biological passport programme, 161 blood tests specifically directed at identifying usage of either human growth hormone and/or erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (EPO), 54 out-of-competition urine tests and 528 urine tests conducted on-site (which also incorporates 239 for EPO analysis).\nAs was the case since the 2005 World Championships, athletes' doping samples were stored for future analysis, which could allow retrospective disqualifications via subsequent improvements to testing technology and methods. The number of tests was a new high for the event and the largest ever conducted by a sport-specific governing body at an event. The testing was undertaken in partnership with the Chinese National Anti-Doping Agency (CHINADA). An anti-doping education programme was also conducted, which included presentations on the risks of doping and a questionnaire designed by the World Anti-Doping Agency.\nInitial analysis identified two failed tests, both Kenyan women: hurdler Koki Manunga and sprinter Joy Nakhumicha Sakari. Both were disqualified immediately from the competition."

        "title": "History of rugby union matches between England and Ireland",
        "text": " \nEngland and Ireland have played rugby union internationals against each other since 1875, with England winning the first match at The Oval, London by two goals to nil. (A points scoring system was not used in rugby at the time.) The two teams have played a total of 142 Test matches with England winning 81 of them, Ireland 53, and 8 resulting in a draw. However, since rugby union went professional in 1995, the head-to-head is a lot closer. The teams have met 34 times since then with England winning 19 test matches to Ireland's 15.\nApart from their annual match during the Six Nations Championship, the teams have also met on six other occasions, with England winning five. The sides have played four warm-up matches prior to the 2011, 2015, 2019, 2023 World Cups. They played a one-off match in April 1988 to celebrate the millennium of the city of Dublin in which the winners of the 1988 match, England, were awarded the Millennium Trophy. This then became the trophy for the annual match between the teams in the Six Nations Championship. The sides also faced off in the inaugural Autumn Nations Cup which took place in November 2020. \nIreland achieved a record away winning margin over England when they beat them 32–15 on 12 March 2022, following an early Charlie Ewels red card. \nMillennium Trophy.\nThe Millennium Trophy () is a rugby union award contested annually by England and Ireland as part of the Six Nations Championship. It was initiated in 1988 as part of Dublin's millennial celebrations. The trophy has the shape of a horned Viking helmet. As of 2024, England have won it 21 times, and Ireland 16 times. The Millennium Trophy is currently held by England, who beat Ireland 23–22 at Twickenham Stadium."

        "title": "2009–10 Rugby-Bundesliga",
        "text": "The 2009–10 Rugby-Bundesliga was the 39th edition of this competition and the 90th edition of the German rugby union championship. Ten teams played a home-and-away season with a finals round between the top four teams at the end. The bottom two teams are relegated. The season started on 29 August 2009 and finished with the championship final on 29 May 2010, interrupted by a winter break from early December to late March.\nThe competition's defending champion was SC 1880 Frankfurt, who won it in the previous two seasons. In the 2010 final, \"SC 1880\" lost to Heidelberger RK, the previous seasons runners-up, which won its first championship since 1986 and its seventh overall. The final was drawn 22-all after regular time and was decided in extra time, where \"HRK\" scored 17 unanswered points to be crowned German champions of the men, already having won the 2010 women's final earlier that year. The 2010 final was contested by the two teams expected to do so at the start of the season, \"SC 1880\" and \"HRK\" being the only two teams in Germany considered professional. The final was considered to have been of high niveau, with long-term German \"Bundestrainer\" Peter Ianusevici declaring it the best German championship final he had ever watched.\nBelow the Rugby-Bundesliga sat the 2nd Rugby-Bundesliga, which is divided into two divisions with ten teams each. With the RC Luxembourg, a team from Luxembourg, a non-German side competed in the league in 2009-10. The inclusion of this side in the 2009 promotion round to the 2nd Bundesliga had caused some debate in regard to its legality, as the club had not qualified to do so through the German league system and was not a member of any of the German regional rugby federations. However, RC Luxembourg's application was declared valid in regard to the German Rugby Federation's rules and regulations and the team finished second in the promotion round, earning a place in the 2nd Bundesliga for 2009-10.\nOverview.\nThe 2009-10 modus was somewhat different from the previous season. The competition had been expanded from nine to ten teams. It marks the first time since introduction of the single-division Bundesliga in 2001, that ten teams competed in the league. This change of modus was decided upon on 19 July 2008 at the annual general meeting of the German rugby association, the \"DRV\". It was decided to expand the league to ten teams for 2009-10. It was also then decided to introduce an extended play-off format. All up, the number of season games in the Rugby-Bundesliga increases to 94 from 76.\nLike in 2008-09, the top four teams qualified for the finals. The two semi-finals winners then contested the championship final.\nAt the bottom end of the table, nominally the last two teams were relegated while the 2nd Rugby-Bundesliga champions are promoted, however, this was subject to the 2nd Bundesliga champions accepting promotion, which was not the case.\nThe defending champion in 2009-10 was SC 1880 Frankfurt, who beat Heidelberger RK in the 2008-09 final while the ASV Köln Rugby and DSV 78 Hannover were newly promoted to the league, having replaced the DRC Hannover. Suffering from a string of injuries, especially to its forward line, and heavy defeats during the season, ASV Köln Rugby made the decision in mid-April 2010, to withdraw from the Rugby-Bundesliga and not to play its five remaining matches. \"Köln\" thereby was automatically relegated from the league.\nIn the 2nd Bundesliga, the winners of the two divisions were nominally promoted to the Bundesliga, unless they were reserve teams, in which case the right for promotion would have gone to the next-best non-reserve team. The bottom two teams in the 2nd Bundesliga faced the prospect of relegation to the Rugby-Regionalliga. In the South/West Division, the Karlsruher SV Rugby withdrew in March 2010, its record being expulsed.\nAs a sign of the gap between the Bundesliga and the 2nd Bundesliga, TSV Victoria Linden, who only won the 2009-10 North/East division in the last round of the championship, declined promotion, citing the additional cost of travelling and the limited player pool as their reason. The South/West champion, Stuttgarter RC, has also indicated that it would not take up promotion because of the loss of eight first-team players at the end of the season, leaving the Bundesliga with only eight clubs for the next season. It also meant, for the first time ever, that no club from Hanover would compete at the top level of German rugby.\n\"DSV 78\" protested the decision to reduce the league to eight teams again and thereby relegating the club. For the 2nd Bundesliga, this also meant, only one team each would be promoted to the two regional divisions, in the North/East, this was SC Siemensstadt, the club being directly promoted, while, in the South/West, TV Pforzheim won the promotion tournament of the five southern Regionalliga champions in Nuremberg on 12 June 2010.\nPlayer statistics.\nTry scorers.\nThe leading try scores in the Rugby-Bundesliga 2009–10 season were (10 tries or more):\nPoint scorers.\nThe leading point scores in the Rugby-Bundesliga 2009–10 season were (100 points or more):\nPer club.\nThe top try and point scorers per club were:"

        "text": "J. Wayne Wilson (born November 8, 1961) is a Canadian ice hockey coach and former player. He is currently the head coach of the NCAA Division I men's ice hockey team at Rochester Institute of Technology.\nPlaying career.\nWilson grew up in Montreal, Quebec, but his family moved to Guelph, Ontario when he was sixteen. A defenceman, he played junior hockey for the Guelph Platers in the Ontario Hockey Association, then went on to college at Bowling Green State University in Ohio. He played four years (1980–1984) for the NCAA Division I Bowling Green Falcons, serving as captain in his senior year and leading the team to the 1984 national championship. He graduated with a degree in health, physical education, and recreation, then went on to get his master's degree in education from Bowling Green in 1987. While a grad student, he helped out as a part-time coach for the hockey team.\nCoaching career.\nAfter graduating with his masters, he spent one year as an assistant at the University of New Hampshire under coach Bob Kullen, but Kullen fell ill and that left his job in jeopardy. Seeking stability, he accepted a position as an assistant coach at his alma mater in 1988, a position he held through the 1998–99 school year. During that time, the Falcons made three NCAA tournament appearances. Several players (Rob Blake, Nelson Emerson and Brian Holzinger) went on to successful careers in the National Hockey League.\nRochester Institute of Technology.\nIn 1999, after five years of seeking a head-coaching position, he was hired to be head coach at Division III Rochester Institute of Technology. He led the RIT Tigers to a nearly-undefeated season in 2000–01; their only loss was on home ice in the 2001 national championship game. That year, he won the Edward Jeremiah Award for the top coach in Division III men's hockey.\nIn his first six years at RIT, he compiled a 116–31–12 record (.767 winning percentage), with four ECAC West regular-season championships, three ECAC West tournament titles, and three NCAA tournament appearances. However, those all came in his first years at RIT; in 2003, the Tigers missed the D-III national tournament for the first time since 1995, and they would never return.\nIn late 2004, despite a couple of \"down\" years for the program (including \"only\" a 13–7–5 record in 2003–04), RIT President Albert J. Simone announced that RIT would move their hockey program up to the Division I level, retaining Wilson as head coach. RIT would join Atlantic Hockey starting in the 2006–07 season.\nThe rest of the 2004–05 campaign was rough, and the Tigers finished with their worst record of Wilson's tenure to date, including a painful loss to arch-rival Elmira College in which the Tigers squandered a late two-goal lead by allowing a pair of short-handed goals in the last three minutes of regulation. They would eventually lose in overtime 7–6.\nThe Tigers' first season as a Division I program, in which they played as an independent was even harder, although the highlight was a home win over the St. Lawrence Saints (ranked #18 in the nation at the time) thanks to a 66 save performance by goaltender Jocelyn Guimond. The Tigers won only nine games that season, mostly against future Atlantic Hockey conference opponents.\nSince joining Atlantic Hockey in 2006, though, success has been the Tigers' hallmark. They won three regular-season conference championships in four years, and in 2010 they won their first conference tournament. That granted them the conference's autobid into the national tournament, where they stunned Denver and New Hampshire to win the East Regional and advance to the Frozen Four.\nIn 2010, in recognition of reaching the Frozen Four, Wilson won the Spencer Penrose Award, for the top coach in Division I men's ice hockey. He became the first coach to win both the Spencer Penrose Award and the Edward Jeremiah Award. He also signed a five-year contract that year, keeping him at RIT until at least the 2014–15 season.\nDuring the 2014–15 season, Wilson led the Tigers to their second NCAA tournament appearance at the Division I level, where they knocked off the #1 overall seed Minnesota State Mavericks in the first round. Following the end of the 2014–15 season, Wilson signed a seven-year contract extension with RIT, through the 2022 season.\nDuring the 2015–16 season, Wilson led the Tigers to a third NCAA tournament appearance at the Division I level where they faced the #1 overall seed Quinnipiac Bobcats. Unlike the previous season, there would be no upset as the Tigers were shutout 4–0.\nIn ten seasons of Division I play, Wilson has led the Tigers to several victories over nationally ranked teams. Under Wilson's tutelage, the Tigers have defeated at least one nationally-ranked team in nine out of ten Division I seasons.\nOn November 27, 2021, Wilson became the 47th head coach to record 400 career wins and the 29th to do so with one program.\nAs Head Coach, 35 players went on to sign professional contracts. Notables include Steve Pinizzotto in 2007 who became the first RIT Tiger to sign an NHL contract at the Division 1 level. Chris Tanev signed with the Vancouver Canucks in June 2010 and became the first RIT alumnus to play in the NHL making his debut on January 18, 2011. He has also made his playoff debut in the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals suiting up in the Conference Finals for games 3, 4 and 5, and in the Stanley Cup Finals for games 5, 6 and 7. Tyler Brenner signed with the Toronto Maple Leafs in March 2011 on a two year entry level contract.\nPersonal life.\nWilson and his wife Lynn live in Pittsford, New York. Their daughter Stephanie Konczos attended Bowling Green State University, and their son Stu Wilson (who played ice hockey for Yale) is a professional ice hockey player."

Martin is known for his strong checking abilities. Martin also holds the NHL record for most hits in a season. In the NHL, Martin has been described as both an enforcer and a grinder.\nPlaying career.\nAmateur.\nMartin tried out for his local AAA team, the Windsor Jr. Spitfires, but was cut and played AA hockey for the Lasalle Sabres. In 2005-06 he made the Blenheim Blades Jr.C. club as a free agent. In 2006, he tried out with the Sarnia Sting of the Ontario Hockey League as a walk-on, and made the team, playing on a line with Steven Stamkos. He would eventually serve as the captain of the Sarnia Sting.\nProfessional.\nMartin was drafted in the fifth round, 148th overall by the New York Islanders in the 2008 NHL Entry Draft. Martin was signed by the Islanders to a three-year entry-level contract on September 4, 2009. Martin scored his first NHL goal on October 29, 2010 against Alex Auld of the Montreal Canadiens.\nOn September 15, 2012, Martin agreed to a four-year contract with the Islanders.\nDuring the 2014–15 NHL season, Martin set the NHL record for most hits in a single season, recording 382 checks.\nThe following season, during the 2015–16 campaign, Martin's line, consisting of himself, Casey Cizikas, and Cal Clutterbuck was considered to be one of the best fourth lines in the NHL by ice hockey analysts.\nOn July 1, 2016, as an unrestricted free agent for the first time in his career, Martin and the Toronto Maple Leafs agreed to a four-year, $10 million contract, worth an average of $2.5 million a season. In his first season with Toronto, Martin assumed his role as an enforcer, playing on the fourth line for the team and protecting the plethora of rookies on the roster from hits by other players, and fighting those that ran teammates. The team would qualify for the post-season, with Martin picking up two points in the second game of the series which would see the Maple Leafs lose in six contests to the top seeded Washington Capitals.\nDuring the 2017–18 season, Martin's playing numbers diminished and during a stretch in January and February he was a healthy scratch for 18 consecutive games. He ended the regular season with 12 points in 50 games. On April 23, 2018, Martin was nominated for the King Clancy Memorial Trophy, as a player who best exemplifies leadership qualities and made humanitarian contributions to the community.\nOn July 3, 2018, after two seasons with the Maple Leafs, Martin was traded back to the New York Islanders by Toronto in exchange for Eamon McAdam.\nDuring his first season back with the Islanders, Martin was placed on injured reserve on November 15 due to an upper-body injury that occurred on November 1. At the time, he had scored three goals in 11 games with the Islanders, matching his total from Toronto last season. He was activated off injured reserve on November 26.\nOn January 11, 2021, Martin was signed to a four-year, $6 million extension with the Islanders.\nPersonal life.\nMartin is married to Sydney Esiason, the daughter of former NFL player Boomer Esiason. The couple has two daughters.\nMartin has an older brother who also played hockey and encouraged him to get involved in the sport.\nIn the summer of 2015, Martin started the Matt Martin Foundation to raise money for causes such as NYPD Widows and Children’s Fund, the Association for Children with Down Syndrome, the Boomer Esiason Foundation for Cystic Fibrosis and the Islanders Children’s Foundation. In 2016, Martin was named a finalist for the NHL Foundation Player Award due to his involvement in the community and charity work."

As of April 2010, the International Rugby Board lists the number of clubs in Germany at 110.\nSome of the clubs competing in the German league system are clubs of the US and British armed forces in Germany and therefore not necessarily members of the \"DRV\". Examples of US Army rugby clubs in Germany are the teams in Illesheim, Ramstein and Vilseck, while other clubs, like in the \"RC Kaiserslautern\", recruit some of their players from the US forces but have German players as well.

The United States Olympic &amp; Paralympic Committee (USOPC) is the National Olympic Committee for the United States.\nHosted Games.\nThe United States has hosted the Winter Games on four occasions, more than any other nation:\nMedal tables.\nMedals by winter sport.\n\"Updated on December 31, 2021\"\nThe United States has never won an Olympic medal in the following current winter sport: Biathlon.\nRussia–United States rivalry.\nRussia (in all its incarnations) and the United States have won more Olympic medals than any other nation. Russia topped the overall medal count at 7 Summer Olympics and 9 Winter Olympics, while the United States placed first at 17 Summer Olympics and 1 Winter Olympics. The countries developed a strong rivalry during the Cold War, and while the tensions eased in the 1990s, the relations deteriorated in 2014 and 2016, and the rivalry became even more heated.\nSince the 1952 Summer Olympics, Russia has won 1902 Summer and Winter Olympics medals, the most in that period, while the United States has won 1873 medals, the second most in that period.\nDetailed comparison is presented below.\nWinter Olympics.\nMedal totals of the Soviet Union/Unified Team/Russia/Olympic Athletes from Russia and the United States since 1956, when the Soviet Union started to compete.\nOverall, the United States (1924–present) has won 113 gold and 330 total medals, and Russia (1956–present) has won 142 gold and 386 total medals.\nIce hockey.\nThe 1980 hockey game between the U.S. and USSR was dubbed the \"Miracle on Ice\", when American college players defeated the heavily favored seasoned professionals from the Soviet Union on the way to a gold medal at the Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York. The Soviet Union had won the gold medal in five of the six previous Winter Olympic Games, and were the favorites to win once more. Though ice hockey is not a major sport in most areas of the United States, the \"Miracle\" is often listed as one of the all-time greatest American sporting achievements. The U.S. also won the gold medal in the 1960 Games at Squaw Valley, California, defeating the Soviet Union, Canada, Czechoslovakia, and Sweden along the way. However, since this victory is not as well known as the 1980 win, it has come to be known as the \"Forgotten Miracle\".\nThe U.S. and the Soviet Union next met at the Olympics in 1988. As in 1980, the Soviets were represented by their star-studded veterans, while the Americans fielded a team of college players. The Soviets won the encounter 7–5 and went on to win the gold medal, while the U.S. placed seventh.\nThe two teams met again at the 1992 Olympics in a semi-final match. There, the Unified Team (the successor to the Soviet Union) won 5–2. While some stars had left the Soviet Union to play in the NHL, the Unified Team still boasted many veterans from their domestic professional league, while the Americans were represented primarily by college players. The Unified Team eventually won the gold medal, while the U.S. placed fourth.\nThe U.S. and Russia (the successor to the Unified Team) met twice at the 1996 World Cup of Hockey. The Americans won both games 5–2 en route to the tournament championship.\nThe U.S., coached by Herb Brooks, and Russia, coached by Slava Fetisov, met twice in the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, which included a 2–2 round-robin draw and a 3–2 semi-final win for the Americans. The semi-final match was played 22 years to the day after the \"Miracle on Ice\" game. The U.S. eventually won silver, while Russia won bronze.\nThe two teams met in the quarterfinals of the 2004 World Cup of Hockey, with the U.S. earning a decisive 5–3 victory.\nThe U.S. and Russia played each other in a round-robin game at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. The game was tied 2–2 after overtime before the Americans prevailed in an eight-round shootout, with T. J. Oshie scoring on 4 of 6 attempts for the United States. The match has been dubbed by some as the \"Marathon on Ice\" due to its length. Both teams, however, failed to medal; the Americans finished fourth (losing in the semis to Canada and to Finland in the bronze medal game), while the Russians placed fifth (losing to Finland in the quarterfinals)."

        "text": "Kyle Stanley (born 2 April 1991) is a former Samoa international rugby league footballer who played as a for the St George Illawarra Dragons in the NRL between 2010 and 2014.\nBackground.\nStanley was born in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. He is of Māori and Samoan Australian descent.\nHe is younger brother of fellow professional Chase Stanley.\nEarly life.\nIn his juniors, Stanley played for Hurstville United JRLFC, the same junior rugby league club that former Dragons players Anthony Mundine and Lance Thompson did.\nPlaying career.\n2009.\nStanley was part of the Dragons Under 20's team in the Toyota Cup throughout 2009 and 2010.\n2010.\nKyle made his debut in the NRL for the St. George Illawarra Dragons in round 11, 2010, at WIN Stadium Wollongong against the Canberra Raiders. He debuted at Fullback, and scored a try. He went on to play a total of 8 NRL games in 2010.\nOn 6 September 2010, Stanley was selected in the Samoan train on squad.\n2011.\nIn January 2011, Stanley was named in the Daily Telegraphs '50 Rising Australian Sports Stars'.\nIn an interview with the Illawarra Mercury published on 1 February 2011, Stanley said the following things about his desires and ambitions for the Dragons:\n\"\"This is my club,\" he said. \"I've played my juniors here so I want to stay at the club.\"\n\"This is my dream, playing for St George Illawarra, so hopefully I can keep it like that.\"\nOn 7 April 2011, it was confirmed that Stanley had resigned with the Dragons for a further 3 years which will see him stay at the club until at least the end of the 2014 season. In an interview after resigning, Stanley said: \"As a local junior from the St George area growing up playing with Hurstville United, I’ve always wanted to continue my career at the Dragons,\"\n\"My last two years under Wayne Bennett have been very beneficial and I’m looking forward to continuing my development under Steve Price who will be the Head Coach of the Dragons from 2012.\"\nOn 27 April 2011, Stanley decided to reject the offer of pledging his allegiance to New Zealand and have the opportunity to represent the Kiwis, rather choosing to represent the country of his birth, Australia, in hope of playing both State Of Origin and for the Kangaroos.\nIn June 2011, ahead of State Of Origin Game II, Stanley, along with 6 other 'Blues in waiting' – Tariq Sims, Ryan James, Jamie Buhrer, Michael Oldfield, Jacob Loko &amp; Josh Jackson, was in camp with the NSW Blues by invitation of coach Ricky Stuart, who was keen to have budding stars initiated in the new Origin culture he was trying to build.\n2012.\nOn 12 January 2012 Stanley was named in the 'NSW Blues in waiting squad'. A camp at Coogee coordinated by coach Ricky Stuart for players who he believes have potential to feature in future New South Wales Origin teams.\nDespite pledging his allegiance to Australia and New South Wales, it was reported on 15 May 2012, that Kyle had decided to represent New Zealand. When interviewed on his decision Kyle said \"‘‘I said last year that I wanted to play for Australia but things change and I want to play for New Zealand,’’\" Kyle said. \"‘‘At the end of the day, it was a personal decision.’’\" He also said that the chance of being able to play alongside his brother Chase Stanley at the international level was also a reason in his decision \"‘‘Chase is there and my family are from New Zealand,’’\" Kyle said. \"‘‘So I chose New Zealand. It is exciting times.’’\"\nOn 14 July 2012, during a game against the Cronulla Sharks at Wollongong Showground, Stanley ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his right knee. An injury that would end the 2012 season for him.\nIt was reported on 27 November 2012, only 4 months after the injury he sustained to his knee, that Stanley had re-ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee after slipping on a wet surface away from training.\n\"I was midway through my recovery, just at home and it started pouring down with rain,\" Stanley said. \"I went outside to bring some things inside off the patio, because they were getting wet. There was a heavy box and I sort of slipped on the tiles and hurt my bad (right) knee as I was carrying it inside.\"\nAt the time of the injury, his operating surgeon, Dr. Sorrenti said \"‘‘If he has just ruptured his ligament and has no other damage then there is nothing to stop him from having a successful career’’\"\n2013.\nStanley spent the entire 2013 NRL season in physical rehabilitation. During an interview on 13 August 2013 – Dragons high performance director Andrew Gray said \"‘‘Kyle has just started running and he's looking fantastic’’\". \"‘‘He is looking great and will be ready to go at the start of next season’’\".\n2014.\nIn Round 1 against the Wests Tigers at ANZ Stadium, Stanley played his first match for the Dragons since Round 19 2012, playing off the bench in the Dragons 44–24 win. Stanley finished off the Dragons 2014 season with him playing in 9 matches and scoring 1 try (4p). On 8 September 2014, Stanley was selected in the Samoa Four Nations train on squad. On 7 October 2014, Stanley was selected in the Samoa national rugby league team final 24-man squad for the 2014 Four Nations series.\n2015.\nOn 19 November 2014, Stanley signed a 1-year contract with the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks for the 2015 season. During the 2015 season, he tore his ACL a fifth time and required another knee reconstruction. On 2 October, he announced his retirement. He said it was at the recommendation of his surgeon as they had said they didn't feel Stanley's body was fit to play football again.\nPersonal life.\nStanley is one of the famous \"'Stanley' Rugby Clan\" which includes 'Smokin' Joe Stanley, Benson Stanley, Jeremy Stanley, Chase Stanley, Winston Stanley and Jamie Stanley.\nKyle Stanley has two sons with his ex wife."

        "text": "Manchester Baseball Club is one of the largest baseball clubs in the north of England, with two senior teams and four youth teams playing in the British Baseball Federation leagues. The club can trace its roots back as far as 1947, with the formation of the Stretford Saints. Although the Saints club folded in 1973, the name hung around, with the Trafford Saints youth team playing during the 1990s with reasonable success. Trafford merged with the senior Manchester team in 2000, creating the MBC as it is today.\nSenior teams.\nAround the turn of the 21st century, the senior first team was known as the Manchester Express, after a sponsorship deal with equipment supplier Baseball Express. After the 2003 season, the Express became the Eagles, with the erstwhile A's remaining as the second team. Also at this time a third team, the Torrent, was created to give less experienced players a chance to develop their skills. In the winter of 08/09, the Eagles were disbanded and the A's became the senior squad, and the Torrent entered the BBF leagues for the first time after previously only playing friendly matches.\nAs of the start of the 2010 season, the A's are playing in the Northern division of the British AAA league, and the Torrent compete in the Northern division of the British AA league.\n2009 season.\n2009 was a season of mixed fortunes for the MBC teams. The A's made it to the AA Final Four Tournament after finishing third in the Northern League with a record of 18-6. They also finished in 3rd place at the Final Four after losing to the Mildenhall Bulldogs before beating the Kent Mariners. The Torrent had a tough first league season, winning only five games and suffering several forfeits. They ended the league season in 9th place out of ten teams, but will hope to come back stronger in 2010 after a league reshuffle left them with much more favourable opposition.\n2010 season.\n2010 saw the A's finish with a 14-10 record, and a second third-place finish it 2 seasons for the A's, although with qualification criteria upped to the AAA level this season they did not make the cut for Final Four Tournament.\nThe Torrent built upon last seasons beginnings and finished with a 9-13 record, having let the division in the summer months only to struggle late in the season and finish only above local rivals Oldham Northstars.\nJunior teams.\nThe Manchester Saints have junior teams in three age groups for 2010: Rookie for 7-10s, Pony for 10-13s and Bronco for 13-16s."

        "text": "The Links at Monck's Landing Golf Club is a public golf course located in Norland, Ontario, Canada that opened for play in 2008.\nHistory.\nThe parcel of land upon which Monck's Landing is situated was homesteaded by Edward Stephens in 1859. Three generations of the Stephens family maintained a working farm on the site until 1961. The farm was considered quite prosperous for the area, being located on a pocket of rich topsoil rarely seen in the region. The property changed hands several times after 1961, until 2009 when it was turned into a golf course.\nIn October 2014, the course went bankrupt. In June 2015 the links was purchased and now the current owners continue to operate The Links at Monck's Landing Golf Club.\nThe name.\nThe Links at Monck's Landing Golf Club derives its name from the proximity of present-day City of Kawartha Lakes County Road 45, which began its existence as The Monck Road, a former colonization route extending from Lake Couchiching in the west to its eastern terminus in Bancroft. The Monck Road was named after Lord Charles Stanley Monck, the first Governor General of Canada, and was completed in 1873. Monck's Landing is located three kilometres north of the former Monck Road.\nCourse description.\nMonck's Landing is a 9-hole course that plays to a par of 35. Currently it measures 3,081 yards from the Blue tees, 2,859 yards from the White tees, and 2,486 yards from the Gold tees. A dual tee block system allows those golfers wishing to play 18 holes a \"back 9\" that presents a layout both differing and distinct from that experienced the first time around. Monck's Landing bills itself as a links-style layout that utilizes the property's rolling (60-foot change in elevation), treeless terrain, and such features as deep pot bunkers and high fescue rough, to approximate the experience of playing golf on the classic courses of the British Isles. The course has gained the reputation as a challenging layout, having been described as \"testing\" and \"tough as nails\" by various golf writers. Monck's Landing has been compared favourably to other inland links courses in Ontario such as Tarandowah in recent golf publications. The Links at Monck's Landing Golf Club was awarded a nomination for \"Best New Course in Ontario\" by Fairways Magazine in May, 2010, as well being included on columnist Robert Thompson's list of his favourite Canadian \"links\" and featured in Ontario Golf Magazine's Mid Summer 2010 article \"Best Bang For The Buck - There's great golf to be across Ontario for $65 or less\". The course also received a favourable review in the Fall 2011 issue of SCOREGolf Magazine, in which it was described as \"an affordable and gnarly nine-hole links course with plenty of bite.\"\nThe Stone Barn.\nSituated prominently upon the property is a unique stone barn that is intended to house Monck's Landing's clubhouse in the near future. Built in 1919, with stone walls that extend up to its rafters, this stone barn is considered by some experts to be the only structure of its kind in Ontario."

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball records considered unbreakable",
        "text": "Some Major League Baseball (MLB) records are widely regarded as \"unbreakable\" because they were set by freak occurrence or under rules, techniques, or other circumstances that have since changed. Some records previously regarded as unbreakable have been broken and even re-broken.\nPitching.\nMost career wins – 511.\nSet by Cy Young, 1890–1911. Highlights include five 30-win seasons and fifteen 20-win seasons. The next closest player is Walter Johnson with 417, the only other player that reached 400. The most wins by a pitcher who played his entire career in the post-1920 live-ball era is Warren Spahn's 363.\nFor a player to accomplish this, he would have to average 25 wins in 20 seasons just to attain 500. Since 1978, only three pitchers (Ron Guidry in 1978, Bob Welch in 1990, and Steve Stone in 1980) have had one season with 25 wins. Between 2000 and 2009, the Major League leader finished each year with an average of 21. Only four pitchers expected to be active in the 2024 season have even 200 wins—Justin Verlander with 257, Zack Greinke with 225, Max Scherzer with 214, and Clayton Kershaw with 210. The next active player on the list, Gerrit Cole, ended the 2023 season with 145.\nMost wins in a season – 60.\nSet by Charles Radbourn, in 1884, with Jack Chesbro's 41 in 1904 historically regarded as the modern mark. In today's game of five-man rotations, pitchers do not start enough games to break the record. Miles Mikolas was the only pitcher to start 35 games in 2023, and only three pitchers in the 21st century have started more than 35 games in a season (Tom Glavine in 2002 and Roy Halladay and Greg Maddux in 2003, each with 36 starts). Although relief pitchers often appear in more than the requisite number of games, they rarely record ten wins in a season, and the use of relief pitchers increases a starter's chance of a no decision, further limiting the ability to break the record. To put this record in further perspective, the last pitcher to win 30 games in a season was Denny McLain in 1968 and the last pitcher to win more than 25 games in a season was Bob Welch with 27 in 1990. The most wins in a season by any pitcher in the 21st century is 24, by Randy Johnson in 2002 and Justin Verlander in 2011.\nMost career complete games – 749.\nSet by Cy Young, 1890–1911. Highlights of this record include: nine 40-complete-game seasons, eighteen 30-complete-game seasons and completing 92 percent of his total career starts (an all-time record of 815). The next closest player is Pud Galvin, who has 103 fewer complete games at 646. Among pitchers whose entire careers were in the live-ball era, the most is 382 by Warren Spahn.\nFor a player to accomplish this, he would have to average 30 complete games over 25 seasons to get to 750. Between 2000 and 2009, the Major League leaders in complete games averaged eight per season, and only two pitchers in the 21st century have had 10 complete games in any season (CC Sabathia with 10 in 2008 and James Shields with 11 in 2011). In addition, only two pitchers other than Young have even started as many as 749 games—Nolan Ryan (773) and Don Sutton (756). Among pitchers expected to be active in the 2024 season, the leader is Verlander with 26, followed by Kershaw with 25.\nThe quest for any complete-game records, either over a career or over a single season, is further complicated by the drastic change in philosophy embraced by virtually all modern managers and pitching coaches, motivated in roughly equal parts by more advanced modern-day medical knowledge of the cumulative damage that pitching does to a hurler's arm, combined with a team front office's reluctance to see injuries to a pitcher in whom they have invested considerable financial capital in the form of a big contract. Another factor, arguably, is the greater reliance of managers and pitching coaches on sabermetrics—in this case, statistical data and analysis that generally show leaving a starter in longer leads to diminishing returns in terms of opposing batters allowed to reach base safely and score runs. While even a few decades ago, a starting pitcher was expected to go out and attempt to pitch a complete game, with the manager going to his bullpen only if the starter ran into trouble or was injured or visibly tiring, the present-day norm is the starter is expected to give his manager six, or perhaps seven \"quality innings\", at which point the manager—who, along with the pitching coach, has been tracking the starter's pitch count—will normally lift him and bring in one or more middle-relief specialists to pitch the next several innings and form a bridge to the team's closer. There are exceptions—a manager will leave a starter in who is working on a no-hitter or, sometimes, a shutout, or will let a starter continue if he is pitching particularly strongly and has not run up a high pitch count. But managerial caution is now a more dominant mode, particularly if a pitcher is coming off a recent injury or has had Tommy John surgery or any other major procedure done on his pitching arm.\nThese changes in philosophy have reduced the number of complete games in today's game to an even greater extent than in the first decade of the 21st century. Since Shields amassed 11 complete games in 2011, no pitcher has had more than 6 complete games in a season, with the two most recent to amass 6 being Chris Sale in 2016 and Sandy Alcántara in 2022. In 2018, all of Major League Baseball combined for 42 complete games, with no pitcher having more than 2. The 2019 season was similar in both respects, with 45 total complete games and no pitcher having more than 3. In a 2019 story, Sam Miller of ESPN went so far as to say, \"In your lifetime, you might very well see the last complete game.\" In 2022, managerial caution reached an unprecedented new standard when Los Angeles Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw was pulled while working on a potential perfect game.\nMost complete games in a season – 75.\nAll-time record of 75 set by Will White in 1879; modern-era record of 48 set by Jack Chesbro in 1904. \"Sports Illustrated\" has said about this record, \"Even if the bar is lowered to begin with the live-ball era (which began in 1920), the mark would still be untouchable.\" The most complete games recorded in a live-ball season is 33, achieved three times in all—twice at the dawn of that era by Grover Cleveland Alexander in 1920 and Burleigh Grimes in 1923, and also by Dizzy Trout in 1944, a season in which the player pool was severely depleted by military call-ups during World War II. Modern starters can expect to start about 34 games in a season while fully healthy. The current active leader in complete games over an entire career is Justin Verlander with 26.\nMost consecutive complete games in a season (since 1900) – 39; Most consecutive games without being relieved – 202.\nBoth records were set by Jack Taylor, who pitched 202 consecutive games without being relieved from June 20, 1901, through August 13, 1906. The streak includes a total of 187 career starts (all complete games) and 15 relief appearances. The streak of 39 consecutive complete games (uninterrupted by a relief appearance) is a subset of the longer streak, lasting from April 15 through October 6, 1904.\nMost career shutouts – 110.\nSet by Walter Johnson, 1907–1927. Highlights include: eleven six-shutout seasons and leading the league in shutouts seven times. The next closest player is Grover Cleveland Alexander, who has 90. As is the case for career wins and complete games, Warren Spahn, who retired in 1965, holds the record among pitchers whose entire careers were in the live-ball era, with 63.\nFor a player to tie Johnson's record, he would have to pitch five shutouts every season for 22 years. Between 2010 and 2019, the Major League leader in shutouts finished each year with an average of three, and no pitcher has recorded more than two shutouts in a season since 2017. Also, adding the MLB-leading shutout totals for each season from 1992 through 2019 results in a total of 106, still short of Johnson's record. The closest active player is Clayton Kershaw with 15.\nMost shutouts in a season – 16.\nSet first by George Bradley in 1876 and equaled by Grover Cleveland Alexander in 1916; live-ball era record of 13 set by Bob Gibson in 1968.\nSam Miller of ESPN had this to say about a rhetorical suggestion that the live-ball record of 13 could be broken: \"This is the stupidest suggestion yet. Thirteen shutouts clearly belongs in the anachronism pile.\" He pointed out that neither the National nor American League had 13 combined shutouts in the 2018 season, and no pitcher had more than one in that season.\nMost consecutive no-hitters – 2.\nSet by Johnny Vander Meer on June 11 and 15, 1938. Despite holding this record, he finished his career with a 119–121 win–loss record. The prospect of a pitcher breaking this record by hurling three no-hitters in a row is so unimaginable that \"LIFE\" argued \"it's easier to imagine someone hitting in 57 straight games or bashing 74 home runs in a season or ending the season with a 1.11 ERA.\" Ewell Blackwell came the closest to matching Vander Meer after following up a no-hitter with eight no-hit innings in 1947. In 1988, Dave Stieb of the Toronto Blue Jays had consecutive no-hitters going with two outs and two strikes in the ninth; both were broken up by singles. Between 2010 and 2019, 35 no-hitters were pitched (not including five combined no-hitters involving multiple pitchers), and the closest anyone came in the 21st century is Max Scherzer, who in 2015 threw a one-hitter and no-hitter in consecutive starts, respectively losing out on perfect games in the seventh inning and on the 27th batter.\nMost career no-hitters – 7.\nSet by Nolan Ryan, 1966–1993. Sandy Koufax is second with four. Larry Corcoran, Cy Young, Bob Feller, and Justin Verlander have all thrown three. Only Verlander is active.\nIn all, 26 pitchers have thrown two, including active player Max Scherzer. An additional 30 active pitchers have played a part in one, including 20 who have thrown an individual no-hitter. Between 2000 and 2009, 20 no-hitters in all were thrown—19 of them solo no-hitters and one a combined no-hitter (in which more than one pitcher contributed). The following decade (2010–2019) saw the number of no-hitters double from the 2000s, with 40 (36 solo, 4 combined).\nMost career strikeouts – 5,714.\nSet by Nolan Ryan, 1966–1993. Highlights include: six 300-strikeout seasons, fifteen 200-strikeout seasons, and leading the league in strikeouts 11 times. To accomplish this record, Ryan played the most seasons (27) in MLB history, as well as being both second in career innings pitched in the live-ball era, and fourth among pitchers who have completed their careers in strikeouts per nine innings.\nThe next closest player is Randy Johnson, who has 839 fewer strikeouts at 4,875. Johnson also had four consecutive 300-strikeout seasons at the turn of the 21st century (1999–2002); the only pitchers with a 300-strikeout season after 2002 are Clayton Kershaw, who had 301 in 2015; Chris Sale, with 308 in 2017; Max Scherzer, with 300 in 2018; and Gerrit Cole and Justin Verlander, respectively with 326 and 300 in 2019. For a player to approach this record, he would have to average 225 strikeouts over 25 seasons just to get to 5,625. Averaging 250 strikeouts over 23 seasons would enable him to surpass the record with 5,750. Between 2010 and 2019 the Major League leader in strikeouts finished each year with an average of 279, and even that average is skewed with the aforementioned large strikeout seasons late in the decade. No pitcher exceeded 280 strikeouts between 2005 and 2014. Since then, only eight 280-strikeout seasons have been recorded—the five aforementioned 300-strikeout performances, plus Scherzer's 284 in 2016, Verlander's 290 in 2018, and Spencer Strider's 281 in 2023. The closest active player is Scherzer with 3,367, with Verlander closely following with 3,342.\nMost career bases on balls – 2,795.\nSet by Nolan Ryan, 1966–1993. Ryan has more than 50 percent more bases on balls than the next highest (Steve Carlton with 1833). The active pitcher with the most walks, Justin Verlander, finished the 2023 season with 925.\nMost innings pitched in a season – 680.\nSet by Will White in the same 1879 season in which he set the record of 75 complete games noted above (at this time the distance from mound to plate was 45 feet).\nThe record pitching from the distance used since 1893 (60 feet 6 inches) is 482 innings that first year by Amos Rusie, which had been exceeded 85 times by pitchers working from 45 or (starting in 1881) 50 feet, including by Rusie himself the three previous consecutive seasons, but has never been approached since (Ed Walsh in 1908 was the last to pitch 400 innings in a season). The most innings pitched in a live-ball season (since 1920) was Wilbur Wood's 3762⁄3 innings in 1972.\nNo pitcher has even thrown half of White's record total for innings in a season since Phil Niekro in 1979, with 342. The last 300-inning season to date was by Steve Carlton the following year, with 304. The highest single-season innings count in the 21st century was Roy Halladay's 266 in 2003, and the five lowest innings totals for an MLB leader in the sport's history (apart from three shortened seasons—1981 and 1994 due to strikes, and 2020 due to COVID-19) have all occurred since 2016—Chris Sale with 2141⁄3 in 2017, Logan Webb with 216 in 2023, Max Scherzer with 2202⁄3 in 2018, Justin Verlander with 223 in 2019, and Zack Wheeler with 2131⁄3 in 2021.\nMost career wild pitches thrown – 343.\nSet by Tony Mullane, who pitched from 1881 to 1894. Mullane pitched through a staggering 4531.1 innings (24th all-time) throwing a total of 343 wild pitches and averaged an errant pitch in 7.56% of those innings. Nolan Ryan is second on the list of most wild pitches with 277. The active leaders in wild pitches are Zack Greinke and Clayton Kershaw, each with 101, less than one-third of Mullane's total. Modern pitchers throw wild pitches less frequently and pitch fewer innings.\nMost innings pitched in a single game – 26.\nSet by Leon Cadore and Joe Oeschger, respectively of the Brooklyn Dodgers and Boston Braves, who were the only pitchers in a 26-inning marathon on May 1, 1920 that ended in a 1–1 tie due to darkness. Many commentators have cited this record as unbreakable, noting that modern teams generally use more than one pitcher in a regulation game, much less one that goes into extra innings.\nBatting.\nMost career hits – 4,256.\nSet by Pete Rose, 1963–1986. No active major league player is at this time considered to be close to breaking Rose's mark. Following the retirement of Albert Pujols (3,384) at the end of the 2022 season and Miguel Cabrera at the end of the 2023 season, no active player has even 3,000 hits, with the de facto retired Robinson Canó leading active players with 2,639 hits, followed by the 40-year-old Joey Votto, with 2,135 hits. The youngest player with at least 2,000 career hits is José Altuve, with 2,047 hits at the age of 33. He would have to average more than 200 hits over the next nine seasons to break the record. To get within 6 hits of tying Rose, a player would have to collect 250 hits for 17 straight seasons, or more than 200 hits over the course of 21 seasons. In the past 81 years, only Ichiro Suzuki, whose first season in Major League Baseball was his \"tenth\" in the top professional ranks, following nine years in his native Japan, has topped 250 hits in a season (with 262 hits in 2004). Ichiro ended his playing career with 3,089 MLB hits and 1,278 hits in the Japanese major leagues (averaging just 106 games and 142 hits a year in much shorter Japanese seasons) for a combined, unofficial total of 4,367, 111 more than Rose's record; however, Ichiro's hits from Japan's major leagues are not counted toward his MLB total. At the end of the 2023 season, Cabrera retired with 3,174 hits after 21 seasons. No player younger than Cabrera was within 500 hits of his career total at the end of the 2023 season, and among players no older than 30 at that time, only Francisco Lindor had even 1,300 career hits (1,323).\nMost career plate appearances – 15,890.\nAlso set by Rose. \"MLB.com\" writer Matt Kelly noted in a 2023 story on records he saw as unbreakable that it was difficult to \"imagine any player not only equaling Rose's 24 big league seasons, but also maintaining the excellence required to average 662 plate appearances per season as the Hit King did.\" Kelly added that Pujols had just ended his 22-season MLB career more than 2,800 plate appearances behind Rose.\nMost career total bases – 6,856.\nSet by Hank Aaron, 1954–1976. His total is more than 600 greater than second-place Pujols (6,211), and the active leader, the 40-year-old Votto, had only 3,706 at the end of the 2023 season. Entering the 2024 season, the leader among players no older than 30 is Francisco Lindor with 2,283, less than one-third of Aaron's total.\nMost hits in a season – 262.\nSet by Ichiro Suzuki in 2004, breaking a record that had been set in 1920 by George Sisler (257). Writing in 2019 for ESPN, Sam Miller argued that this relatively young record is nonetheless unlikely to be broken. He noted that the only active player who had collected more than 225 hits in any season was Ichiro himself, who had done so three times. The next-highest total since 2000 was 240 hits by Darin Erstad in 2000.\nMiller wrote that in today's game, \"few elite hitters are as walk-averse as Ichiro was permitted to be\", which he argued would keep other players from approaching the record. The MLB leader in at-bats in 2018 was Trea Turner with 664; a player with that number of at-bats would have to hit .396 to reach 263 hits—a batting average that Miller had argued in 2018 was unapproachable in the modern game. He added,The outer limit for at-bats – say, a leadoff hitter for a high-scoring team who plays every game and has a 10th-percentile walk rate – is perhaps 725, nine higher than the all-time record. And even the 725-AB guy would need to hit .363, a mark not met by any hitter in this decade.\nThe aforementioned Matt Kelly added that Ichiro had 704 at-bats in the 2004 season, making him one of only four players with more than 700 at-bats in a season. Kelly added, \"So to break this record, you'd have to hit .373 and log more than 700 ABs. Good luck.\"\nMost consecutive seasons with 200 hits – 10.\nSet by Ichiro Suzuki, from 2001 to 2010. The closest player is Willie Keeler, who had eight consecutive seasons with 200 hits almost a century earlier, in the dead-ball era. No players at all had 200 hits in 2013, 2018, 2020, 2021 and 2022 seasons, in 2023 only three players had 200 hits, and in 2019, only Whit Merrifield and Rafael Devers did so.\nMost career doubles – 792.\nSet by Tris Speaker, 1907–1928. Highlights include: five 50-double seasons, ten 40-double seasons, and leading the league in doubles eight times. The next closest player is Pete Rose, who has 46 fewer doubles at 746. Among hitters whose entire careers were in the live-ball era, the leader in career doubles is the aforementioned Rose.\nFor a player to threaten Speaker's record, he would have to average 39 doubles over 20 seasons just to get to 780, or 40 doubles in 20 seasons to break the record. Between 2010 and 2019 the Major League leader in doubles finished each year with an average of 51, with José Ramírez setting a decade-high of 56 doubles during the 2016 season. However, players tend to hit less doubles as they age, thus making difficult for most players to keep hitting doubles consistently for long enough to challenge the record. Following the retirement of Albert Pujols who ended his career in 2022 with 686 (a record for a right-handed hitter), and Miguel Cabrera, no active player has even 500 doubles, with the closest being Freddie Freeman at 473 at the end of the 2023 season. No player younger than 30 has even 300 doubles at the end of the 2023 season, although five players with that total turned 31 during or shortly after that season (Mookie Betts, 347; Xander Bogaerts, 339; Manny Machado, 333; Bryce Harper, 327; and José Ramírez, 325). The player with the most career doubles no older than 30 is Francisco Lindor, who has 265 and turned 30 shortly after the end of the 2023 season. In order to break the record, Freeman would need to average 40 doubles over 8 seasons; the aforementioned players in their early thirties with 300-plus doubles would need to average at least 44 doubles over 10 seasons; and Lindor would need to average 44 doubles over 12 seasons.\nMost career triples – 309.\nSet by Sam Crawford, 1899–1916. Highlights include: five 20-triple seasons and sixteen 10-triple seasons. The next closest player is Ty Cobb, who has 14 fewer triples at 295. Because of changes in playing styles and ballparks that began around 1920 and have continued into the present from the dead-ball era to the live-ball era, the number of triples hit has declined noticeably since then. Among hitters whose entire careers were in the live-ball era, the leader in career triples is Stan Musial, with 177.\nFor a player to threaten Crawford's record, he would have to average 15 triples over 20 seasons just to get to 300. Between 2010 and 2019 the Major League leader in triples finished each year with an average of 13, and no player in that decade had more than 16 in a season. Bobby Witt Jr. and Corbin Carroll, respectively with 11 and 10 triples in 2023, are the only players in the 2020s to hit even 10 triples in a season. At the end of the 2023 season, the closest active player is Charlie Blackmon with 63; the closest active player 30 or under is Trea Turner with 41.\nMost triples in a season – 36.\nSet by Chief Wilson in 1912. Only two other players have ever had 30 triples in a season (Dave Orr with 31 in 1886 and Heinie Reitz with 31 in 1894), while the closest anyone has come in the century since Wilson set the record is 26, shared by Sam Crawford (1914) and Kiki Cuyler (1925). Only six hitters have had 20 triples in the last 50 years: George Brett (20 in 1979), Willie Wilson (21 in 1985), Lance Johnson (21 in 1996), Cristian Guzmán (20 in 2000), Curtis Granderson (23 in 2007) and Jimmy Rollins (20 in 2007).\nSam Miller also added that Chief Wilson was playing his home games in Forbes Field, which in 1912 had a 460-foot center-field distance, noticeably longer than any current MLB park. In his record-setting season, Wilson hit 24 triples at home, a total that has not been surpassed in an entire season since 1925. Additionally, Wilson himself never hit more than 14 triples in any other season. On top of this, no minor-league player has ever had more than 31 triples in a season, despite that level of the game having less capable defenders, many quirky ballparks (more so in past decades than today), and in some historical cases much longer seasons.\nMost walks drawn in a season – 232; most intentional walks drawn in a season – 120.\nBoth records set by Barry Bonds in 2004. The aforementioned Matt Kelly noted that the only other player who had drawn even 170 walks in a season was Babe Ruth in 1923. As for intentional walks, Bonds himself is the only player to have drawn even half of his 2004 total in any other season (68 in 2002, 61 in 2003); the next-highest player is Willie McCovey with 45 in 1969.\nMost home runs in a game – 4.\nIn all, 18 players have hit four home runs in a game. A five-homer game would require not only that a player get five plate appearances, but that he receive hittable pitches in each appearance. Only three players, having hit four in one game, have ever made a plate appearance that could have resulted in a fifth: Lou Gehrig in 1932, Joe Adcock in 1954 and Mike Cameron in 2002. In Gehrig's last at-bat, he hit a deep fly to center; Adcock hit a double off the top of the wall (his 18 total bases was a record until Shawn Green broke it in 2002). Breaking this record would also set the single-game record for most total bases, with 20. Relatedly, no player has homered in five consecutive at-bats over multiple games. However, home runs are being hit at ever-increasing rates, reflecting batters' increased focus on \"launch angles\", a dramatically reduced stigma for strikeouts, and, some allege, that MLB has \"juiced\" the ball. These factors increase the prospect of a five-homer game, particularly over extra innings.\nMost grand slams in a single inning – 2.\nSet by Fernando Tatís in 1999. Only twelve other players have ever hit two grand slams in a single game. However, breaking the record would require a player to hit three grand slams in a single inning. Breaking this record would also tie the major league record for RBI in a single game (12). Over 50 players have hit two home runs in a single inning, but no MLB player has so much as hit three home runs in one inning. One minor league player, Gene Rye, hit three home runs in a single inning.\nHighest career batting average – .366.\nSet by Ty Cobb in 1928 after beginning his career in 1905. Highlights of this record include three .400 seasons; nine .380 seasons; and leading the league 11 times in batting average. Cobb managed to hit .323 in his final season at age 41. The next-closest player is Rogers Hornsby who had a batting average of .358. The careers of both Cobb and Hornsby straddled the dead-ball and live-ball eras; most of Cobb's career was in the dead-ball era, while most of Hornsby's was in the live-ball era. There are only three players with a career average over .350, and the highest batting average among those who played their entire careers in the live-ball era is Ted Williams' .344. Since 1928, there have been only 46 seasons in which a hitter reached .366 and only Tony Gwynn attained that mark at least four times, finishing with a career .338 batting average. At the end of the 2023 season, after the retirement of Miguel Cabrera, José Altuve leads active players in career batting average with .307, 6 points above Freddie Freeman at .301.\nHighest single-season batting average – .440.\nSet by Hugh Duffy in 1894, the highest single-season average in National League, and MLB history. Nap Lajoie’s .426 in 1901 is the highest in American League history. In the live-ball era, Rogers Hornsby hit .424 in 1924, a feat unmatched since then. George Sisler's .420 average in 1922 still stands as the highest American League average of the modern era. Ted Williams hit .406 in 1941, the last player in either league to top .400 for a season. Since then, only George Brett, who hit .390 in 1980, and Tony Gwynn, who hit .394 in a strike-shortened season in 1994, have even come close to reaching .400, and they were nowhere near any of the historical league or MLB highs.\nIn a 2018 ESPN story, Sam Miller argued that it was impossible to hit .400, or even seriously challenge the mark, in the modern game, noting that no hitter in the 21st century entered the second half of the season with an average above .380, and at that time, no batter since 2009 who qualified for his league's batting title had a .400 average at any point after May 25. Additionally, Miller argued that a player who might conceivably challenge .400 would have to combine a low strikeout rate, high home run rate, and high batting average on balls in play—a group of skills which largely do not complement one another. In the 2023 season, Luis Arráez became the first player in recent times with an average above .400 after May 25, by going 2-for-4 in a 6-1 win against the Kansas City Royals on June 6, but finished the season with an average of .354.\nMost RBI in a season – 191.\nSet by Hack Wilson, who batted in 191 runs in 1930. Only Lou Gehrig and Hank Greenberg, at 184 and 183 RBI respectively, ever came close, and there have been no real challenges to the record for over 75 years.\nHowever, Sam Miller argued in ESPN in 2019 that a serious challenge to Wilson's record, though highly unlikely, was less implausible than challenges to many of the other records listed here. He noted that in 1930, Wilson came to bat with 524 runners on base, drove in 22.7% of them, and hit 56 homers. Neither the number of baserunners nor the RBI percentage is within the top 60 seasons for those statistics in MLB history, with some seasons in the top 60 of both categories having been recorded in the 21st century, and he added \"we've all seen players hit 56 home runs, even this decade.\" However, with today's batters pursuing one of baseball's so-called \"three true outcomes\" – a home run, walk, or strikeout – there is less likelihood of enough runners on base for such a season to produce anything like 191 RBI.\nMost runs scored in a season – 198.\nSet by Billy Hamilton in 1894; modern-era (post-1900) record of 177 set by Babe Ruth in 1921. Matt Kelly, who analyzed only Ruth's record, noted that while Ruth had benefited from a New York Yankees lineup that collectively hit .300, he also hit 59 home runs, then an MLB record, and reached base 353 times, still the fifth-highest total in the modern era. Only one player in the modern era was within 10 runs of Ruth's record (Lou Gehrig with 167 in 1936), and the highest total since 1950 was Jeff Bagwell's 152 in 2000.\nHighest career on-base percentage – .482.\nSet by Ted Williams from 1939 to 1960. Williams, the last man to hit .400 in an MLB season (.406 in 1941), won six American League batting titles, two Triple Crowns, and two MVP awards. He ended his career with 521 home runs and a .344 career batting average. Williams achieved these numbers and honors despite missing nearly five full seasons to military service and injuries. The next-closest player in career OBP is Babe Ruth at .474.\nSince Williams' retirement, only four players have posted an OBP above .482 in a season, with Barry Bonds and Mickey Mantle the only ones to do so more than once. Bonds ended his career with an OBP of .444; the leader among active players is Juan Soto, at .421 after the 2023 season.\nFewest strikeouts in a qualified season – 2.\nSet by Wee Willie Keeler in 1899. One of the greatest contact hitters of MLB history, he played a full season (633 PA, 570 AB) during which he struck out only twice. Of course, he thereby also set another untouchable record: a single-season AB-per-SO of 285! The only possible challenger is the 1876 season of Mike McGeary, who struck out only once in 270 AB, but McGeary played in only 61 games and his single-season AB-per-SO of 270 is lower than Keeler's. With the stipulation of +500AB, Keeler's record is untouchable.\nMost regular season games played, season – 165.\nThe record was set in 1962 by Los Angeles Dodgers shortstop Maury Wills, who played in all of the team's 165 regular season games that year. Thanks to a best-of-three playoff between the Dodgers and San Francisco Giants, which ended the season tied for first place (back when league pennants were winner-take-all, with no annual end-of-season multi-tiered layers of playoffs, play-ins, and wild cards), both teams played 165 games. Because the play-off was to determine the regular season winner of the league championship, the games were counted as extensions of the regular season, and not the post-season, which at that time was composed solely of the World Series.\nBoth the individual and team single-season games played records were set at the beginning of a seven-year span that began with the 1962 National League expansion to 162 games and ended after the 1968 season, when the NL replaced its traditional best-of-three tiebreakers with one-game playoffs. The 1962 season was the only occasion during those years in which a tie-breaker was needed. Until the abolition of tie-breaker games prior to the 2022 season, the American League always used one-game playoffs.\nPrior to the end of the 2021 season, there were a few occasions prior where three or more teams could have tied for postseason berths going into the last day of the season, which under the rules then in force would have resulted in one or more teams having to play at least two other teams in successive tie-breakers. However, a three-way tie involving postseason berths never occurred, meaning that other than in the aforementioned 1962 season no team ever played more than 163 regular season games.\nAs part of the provisions of the 2022 Basic Agreement, MLB expanded the playoffs and replaced one-game tie-breaker games with performance-based criteria to break future ties. Thus unless and until the regular season schedule is extended, which is considered extremely unlikely since all expansions to the season length have been to extend the postseason, no team will play more than 162 regular season games.\nHistorically, there have been two other ways for a player to accumulate more than 162 games played in a season. The first is if the player changes teams in a mid-season trade - a swap to a team that has played fewer games can result in a schedule for the traded player being greater than either individual teams'. Presently '70s-era speedster Frank Taveras holds the records for both most \"regularly scheduled\" MLB games played in a season and most games played for two teams in the same season, both 164, done in 1979. However, even by this method Wills' individual record is statistically ever more unlikely to be broken because teams are increasingly inclined to rest even their best players as part of a new sabremetrics-based strategy known as \"load management\". On average, as of the early 2020's only about three players in all of baseball appear in even 162 regular season games of any given MLB season.\nThe other method in which a player can be credited with more than 162 games played is when games are called with the score tied after the game becomes official, i.e. after five or more innings are played. In recent decades, this was almost always due to adverse weather, although historically such games were also called due to darkness and/or curfews. Due to the tie score, such games did not count in the official standings and were replayed in their entirety. However, player statistics still counted, allowing for example Hideki Matsui to play 163 games for the New York Yankees in 2003. The rules were changed in 2007 to require such tie games to be suspended. The games are then completed at a later date (rather than replayed in full) if feasible and/or required to determine postseason qualification. This change makes such a scenario highly unlikely to be seen again.\nMost consecutive games played – 2,632.\nSet by Cal Ripken Jr., 1982–1998. Lou Gehrig, whose record Ripken surpassed in 1995, had a consecutive games streak of 2,130 games, 502 fewer. Third on the all-time list is Everett Scott, whose streak of 1,307 consecutive games is less than half of Ripken's total. Only seven players have ever played more than 1,000 consecutive games. For a player to approach the milestone, he would have to play all 162 games in a season for 16 years just to get to 2,592 games.\nAs stated by \"LIFE\", \"no one else has ever come close, and no one ever will.\" On average, over the preceding ten seasons from 2009 to 2018 only three players have played all 162 regularly-scheduled games in a particular season.\nLongest hitting streak – 56 games.\nSet by Joe DiMaggio, 1941. Highlights of his hitting streak include a .408 batting average and 91 hits. The next closest player is Willie Keeler, with 45 over two seasons in 1896–97. There have been only six 40-game hitting streaks, and only Pete Rose's 44 in 1978 since DiMaggio's. Since 1900, no player other than DiMaggio has ever hit safely in even 55 of 56 games, and no active players (as of 2019) have their two longest career hit streaks even add up to 56 games.\nOn July 17, 1941, pitchers Al Smith and Jim Bagby of the Cleveland Indians held DiMaggio hitless. Two hard hit shots came close, but great defensive stops by third baseman Ken Keltner ended the streak. \"Joltin' Joe\" actually hit in 57 straight MLB games – singling in the 1941 All-Star game held mid-streak – \nand 73 out of 74 regular season games, starting a 17-game streak the day after his 56-game one ended. He also holds the second longest streak in minor league baseball history, 61 games, set in 1933.\nThe improbability of DiMaggio's hitting streak ever being broken has been attributed to increased bullpen use, including specialist relievers.\nMost career home runs by a pitcher – 37.\nSet by Wes Ferrell, who hit 37 home runs while playing for the Indians, Red Sox, Senators and Yankees during the late 1920s and most of the 1930s (Ferrell hit one more home run while with the Braves in 1941, bringing his total to 38 – 37 as a pitcher and one as a pinch-hitter – the most for any MLB pitcher). With a total of 326 hits in 1,176 at-bats in his 17-year career, Ferrell hit .280 and had 208 RBIs, and is considered one of baseball's best-hitting pitchers.\nOther pitchers with more than thirty career home runs include Bob Lemon, who hit 35 HR as a pitcher and two more as a pinch hitter during his 18-year career, all spent with the Indians; Warren Spahn, who hit 35 while playing for the Braves and is the all-time National League leader; Red Ruffing, who had 34 home runs as a pitcher and two more as pinch-hitter over 22 seasons with the Red Sox, Yankees and White Sox; and Earl Wilson, who hit 35 home runs in an 11-year career – 33 as a pitcher and two as a pinch-hitter – all but one of them while with the Red Sox and Tigers, and the last as a Padre.\nBy the latter half of the twentieth century, \"good-hitting pitchers\" had clearly become the exception rather than the rule. The American League's adoption of the designated hitter rule in 1973 led to the widespread substitution of the DH in the pitcher's slot in the batting order in regular season, All-Star and postseason games played in AL parks. Since then, Ferrell's record has been widely considered an unbreakable \"AL\" record. Even after AL pitchers resumed batting more frequently in 1997 with the introduction of interleague play, since then no American League pitcher has received enough at-bats to seriously challenge any of the above home run statistics (or any other game, seasonal or career hitting marks set by AL pitchers historically).\nWhile pitchers would continue to bat in National League parks for almost a half century after the AL introduced the DH, the aforementioned changes to in-game team management and season structure during that period made a serious challenge to Farrell's record increasingly unlikely - specifically, the introduction of interleague play conversely meant that NL pitchers received fewer at-bats since their teams used the DH when playing in AL parks and the aforementioned drastic reduction in complete games (and corresponding increasing use of relief pitchers) in turn increased the opportunity to use pinch hitters in the pitcher's spot in the batting order. All these factors combined to substantially reduce the number of at-bats per game any individual pitcher could have expected to receive even in NL parks. The career MLB leader for home runs by a pitcher since the introduction of the DH in the AL is Carlos Zambrano, who played his entire career in the interleague era and recorded 24 homers in NL parks.\nDuring the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, the DH was used throughout MLB, although it was dropped again in NL parks for the 2021 season. As part of the new Basic Agreement prior to the 2022 season, MLB owners and players agreed to the permanent inclusion of the DH in all MLB parks. At the time of the permanent implementation of a universal DH, the leader among then-active pitchers was Madison Bumgarner with 19 home runs.\nHowever, a notable caveat to the unbreakability of this record concerns Japanese player Shohei Ohtani, who has excelled as both a starting pitcher and a designated hitter since signing with the Los Angeles Angels in 2018. Ohtani's signing led to speculation that Ferrell's record would quickly be broken, however, Ohtani did not hit and pitch in the same game until the 2021 season and MLB quickly clarified that his home runs hit while not pitching would \"not\" be scored as being hit \"by a pitcher.\" Notably, Ohtani hit 46 home runs in the 2021 season alone. This total includes the first three of his career (all in AL parks) that Ohtani hit while pitching. The implementation of the universal DH essentially coincided with additional rule change dubbed the \"Ohtani rule\" that allows batting pitchers to remain in the game as a DH after being relieved from the mound. The \"Ohtani rule\" largely eliminates the disincentive against a good-hitting pitcher batting in the same game since it means relievers do not have to bat for themselves (or be replaced by pinch hitters) in games where the starting pitcher appears at the plate. Ohtani, who was 27 as of the start of the 2022 season, needed 38 home runs while pitching to officially break Ferrell's record. As per the terms of the \"Ohtani rule,\" hitting statistics recorded by a batting pitcher after any defensive half-inning completed by him will be scored as being hit by a pitcher whether or not he returns to the mound to start the next defensive half-inning, but hitting statistics compiled after a reliever appears on the mound will not.\nMost career sacrifice bunts – 512.\nSet by Eddie Collins, who successfully laid down 512 sacrifice bunts over his 25-year career with the Philadelphia Athletics. Second behind him is Jake Daubert with 392. Since the turn of the 20th century, sacrifice bunts have continually fallen further out of favor: \"Moneyball\" by Michael Lewis, the famous sabermetrician's guide, went as far as to label the bunt as \"evil\". Modern baseball teams value minimizing outs rather than moving a base-runner over a single base position.\nOver the decades prior to the 2021-22 lockout, bunting was most often attempted by players with limited hitting abilities – usually pitchers in National League parks who when required to bat often attempted to advance baserunners as opposed to trying to reach base (and run the basepaths). However, there was no point in the history of the game where pitchers played anywhere close to enough innings to have a realistic opportunity to challenge Collins' record. At the end of the 2021 season the active leader in career sacrifice bunts, pitcher Clayton Kershaw, had 108 — which placed him in a tie for 334th on the all-time list. With the NL adopting the DH in 2022, Kershaw (who entered that season as a free agent) is unlikely to ever bat again. Among position players, the active leader is Elvis Andrus with 103 (tied for 383rd).\nMost stolen bases in a season – 130.\nSet by Rickey Henderson with 130 in 1982, a season in which he was caught stealing 42 times. No player has even attempted 130 steals in a season since Vince Coleman in 1985, and the stolen base has been a steadily declining part of the game since then. No player in the 2018 season even attempted one-third of Henderson's total attempts in 1982, and in the 2017 season, no American League player attempted more than Henderson's 1982 caught-stealing total of 42. Additionally, while Billy Hamilton set a minor-league record with 155 steals in 2012, he has never stolen more than 60 in any season of his MLB career.\nMost career stolen bases – 1,406.\nSet by Rickey Henderson, 1979–2003. Highlights include: three 100-stolen-base seasons, thirteen 50-stolen-base seasons, and leading the league in stolen bases 12 times. The next closest player is Lou Brock, who has 468 fewer stolen bases at 938. According to \"LIFE\", the stolen base record is probably unbreakable, as it is hard to imagine a player today who would \"even \"attempt\" so many steals.\" For a player to approach Henderson's milestone, he would have to average 70 stolen bases over 20 seasons just to get to 1,400. Between 2000 and 2009, the Major League leader in stolen bases finished each year with an average of 64, and that number dropped to 57 in the 2010s—a decade in which no player stole 70 bases in a season. Ronald Acuña Jr.'s 73 stolen bases in 2023 are the most in a season since 2007. The closest active player is Elvis Andrus with 347 stolen bases, less than 25% of Henderson's total.\nMost steals of home in a career – 54.\nTy Cobb holds the record of 54 steals of home in his career. Since there is rarely a single steal of home in any season now, this record stands little chance of ever being approached, let alone surpassed.\nFielding.\nMost outfield assists in a season – 50.\nSet by Orator Shafer in 1879. Since 1900, no other player has had more than Chuck Klein's 44 in 1930, and nobody has had more than Boston Braves right-fielder Gene Moore's 32 since 1936.\nMost outfield assists, career – 449.\nSet by Hall of Famer Tris Speaker (1907–28). Speaker is regarded as the greatest fielding centerfielder ever, known for playing exceptionally shallow and going back on balls rather than coming in. Playing shallow in his era both erased a lot of hits and led to high assist totals: 14 seasons with more than 20 and four with more than 35. The closest any player has since come is 266 by Roberto Clemente (1955–1973).\nMost errors, career – 1,096.\nHerman Long holds the record with 1,096 career errors; he played from 1889 to 1904. Bill Dahlen, Deacon White and Germany Smith are the only other players to commit at least 1,000 errors during their MLB careers. All of these players played at least one season before 1900. The 20th-century record is held by Rabbit Maranville, with 711 errors. Among active players, Elvis Andrus, who has played in MLB since 2009, leads with 231 career errors (nearly 60 more than any other active player) after the 2023 season.\nThe much greater frequency of errors in the game's early decades can be attributed at least as much to a significantly lower standard of equipment as to an inferior level of skill. In particular, gloves did not gain widespread acceptance until the end of the 19th century and remained primitive by modern standards for several decades thereafter. Also, baseballs themselves were far more expensive relative to inflation (and especially relative to club finances) compared to today. Furthermore, the rules strictly enforced today to prevent their adulteration did not exist in that era. Balls were only replaced when absolutely necessary, and as a result were much more difficult to handle and throw effectively.\nOther.\nMost All-Star Games played – 25; most seasons on an All-Star roster – 21.\nBoth records set by Hank Aaron, 1954–1976. Aaron was an All-Star in all but two of the 23 seasons he played in the major leagues (his debut year in 1954 and last season in 1976). His record total was aided by MLB's decision to hold two All-Star Games annually from 1959 to 1962; Aaron played in all eight All-Star Games during that period. His 21 seasons on an All-Star roster are also the most in MLB history. The only players whose careers began after 1976 to play in 25 MLB seasons were Rickey Henderson, who appeared in 10 All-Star Games, and Jamie Moyer, who appeared in one. The active player with the most All-Star Game selections is Mike Trout, who has been on 11 All-Star Game rosters after 13 seasons.\nAaron's record for most seasons on an All-Star roster is more approachable than his record for All-Star Game appearances. In addition to the aforementioned Henderson and Moyer, 26 players whose careers began after 1976 have played in at least 21 MLB seasons. However, the most All-Star seasons among these players is the 14 of Barry Bonds and Iván Rodríguez, who respectively played in 22 and 21 seasons. The most All-Star seasons among players whose careers began after 1976 is 19 by Cal Ripken Jr.\nMost wins, losses and games managed – 3,731, 3,948, and 7,755.\nSet by Connie Mack, who retired in 1950. Mack owned the Philadelphia Athletics, and managed them for 50 years, until the age of 87. Shortly after his retirement Major League Baseball forbade owners from managing their teams. Mack also was the manager in 76 ties as he managed in an era where games could be called due to darkness and/or local curfews. As ties are now extremely rare as a result of rules changes, modern stadium lights, and much more lenient curfews (where they are in force at all) in MLB cities, this record is likely unbreakable given the current rules. Also, during baseball's early decades, owners who did not manage their own teams often sought to have a veteran player fill the role in order to reduce payroll costs. Such arrangements led to the \"player-manager\" position becoming relatively common in baseball and afforded greater opportunity to start a managerial career at a relatively young age.\nMack is also the oldest manager in MLB history – the only other person to manage in the majors after his eightieth birthday is Jack McKeon who retired shortly before his 81st birthday. Among managers active in 2023, the closest manager to Mack in games managed, wins, and losses is the -year-old Dusty Baker (3,884 games, 2,093 wins, 1,790 losses entering the 2023 season). The manager second to Mack in all three categories, Tony La Russa (5,393 games, 2,884 wins, 2,499 losses), returned to managing in 2021 at age 76 after a 10-year absence from that role, but took a medical leave during the 2022 season and later announced he would not return in 2023. Given that Baker ended the 2022 season with 10 fewer seasons as a manager than La Russa, he would have to manage into his eighties before challenging La Russa's totals, much less Mack's. The next-closest active manager in games, wins, and losses is Terry Francona (age ), who entered the 2023 season with 3,460 games managed (18th), 1,874 wins (17th), and 1,586 losses (17th). Both Francona and Baker announced their retirement from managing after the 2023 season.\nUnder the current 162-game schedule, a person would have to manage for 48 seasons to challenge Mack's records. Thus, for example, a person would have to manage continuously starting in the year he turned 32 to have a chance to reach 7,756 games before turning 80, and even then only if no seasons were significantly shortened and/or canceled due to labor disputes, public health emergencies and/or other extenuating circumstances. With the de facto elimination of the player-manager position (the last player-manager in MLB was the aforementioned Pete Rose, who incidentally was in that role for the Cincinnati Reds when he broke Ty Cobb's all-time hit record) and the increasing tendency of players who display the leadership qualities that warrant eventual consideration for employment as field managers also having longer playing careers, it is now uncommon for anyone to earn their first MLB managerial position prior to turning 40.\nThe youngest two managers in MLB in the 21st century are Eric Wedge and A. J. Hinch, who were both 35 when they first managed in the majors. Both were players who had their careers cut short by injuries but had also displayed strong leadership qualities. Wedge has not managed in the majors since 2013, while Hinch has had two stints away from managing (the most recent being a one-year suspension due to his role in the Houston Astros sign stealing scandal, although it should be noted this suspension was served during the pandemic-shortened 2020 season which effectively shortened all active careers by at least 102 games). As of 2023, any current or recently-active MLB manager would have to break Mack's record as the oldest manager before challenging any of his other records.\nMost road losses in a season – 101.\nThe 1899 Cleveland Spiders (20–134) hold the MLB record for the most road losses in a single season, with 101. They were so bad – 20 wins below the 1962 New York Mets – they likely set an unbreakable record for fewest wins in a full season at the same time. In terms of absolute numbers the Spiders' record for fewest wins has been nominally \"broken\" by the 2020 Pittsburgh Pirates, who won exactly one fewer game than the 1899 Spiders by finishing 19–41 in the pandemic-shortened sixty-game season.\nWhat is unusual, however, about the Spiders' road loss record compared to others on this list is that while most others are theoretically possible (but impractical) to break, it cannot be broken even if a team achieved a completely winless season on the road: in today's sport, the 162-game season is equally divided between 81 home and road games, 21 fewer than needed to set a new mark.\nWhile rainouts and other cancellations can reduce the number of games a team plays in a season, the only way a team could accumulate the 21 extra road games needed to break the record is if a team’s stadium suffers damage that makes games unplayable there that forces a team to move a large chunk of home games to the visiting team’s stadium (examples including the 1991 Expos and 1994 Mariners) if the number of games affected is 21 or more (with 32 or more games affected being needed to break the record for number of away games). The only situation in which regular season games were ever added to the schedule is in the case of the now-abolished one-game playoff; the odds of a team losing all of its road games but still having a record strong enough to qualify for such a game were infinitesimally small. While in the uncommon circumstance that a game must be moved to the opposing venue, MLB policy now maintains the legal fiction that the designated home team does not change, regardless of venue, which ensures the designated home team does not lose rules advantages, the game is still changed to counting as an away game for the team. This was not the case in 1899, when 35 of the Spiders' home games were changed to true road games.\nFour other factors contribute to the unique nature of the Spiders' record:\nThe 1899 Spiders also hold the records for the most losses in a single MLB season (with 134) and lowest winning percentage (.130). While these are technically possible to break, even under a 162-game schedule, only two teams have come within 15 losses of the record, these being the expansion 1962 New York Mets (40–120, .250 winning percentage) and the 2003 Detroit Tigers (43–119, .265 winning percentage).\nSince 1899, only five teams have recorded a winning percentage under .260 (i.e. less than double that of the 1899 Spiders), and the 1962 Mets are the only team to do so under a 162-game schedule. Excluding the possibility of canceled games not being made up, a team would need to lose 141 games over a 162-game season to record a .130 winning percentage (this yields a .129 winning percentage if the traditional rounding to three decimal places is ignored).\nLowest paying attendance – 6.\nThis was set by the Worcester Worcesters, in a September 28, 1882 game against the Troy Trojans at the Worcester Agricultural Fairgrounds. While a 2015 MLB game in Baltimore and all games in the pandemic-shortened 2020 season (except for the NLCS and World Series) were held in closed ballparks with nominal attendance of zero, MLB instead listed the official attendance for these games as N/A, thus allowing the Worcester game to retain the record. Worcester, dead last in the NL for the 1882 season and located in a city that did not meet the NL's population standards, was set to be removed from the NL at the end of the season, as was Troy."

        "text": "Dayton Area Rugby Club is a rugby union football club based in Dayton, Ohio, United States. The club currently fields Men's teams in Midwest Divisions III &amp; IV and a Women's team in the Midwest Division II. They play their home games at Dayton Rugby Grounds.\nAs well as a number of players also coaching at various levels, there are also a few club members who have gone on to continue their involvement in the sport by becoming referees.\nHistory.\nMen's Squad.\nRugby first came to Dayton, Ohio in the fall of 1969 when a group of University of Dayton students, led by Bob Borgerding, played their first rugby match. The University of Dayton continues to play rugby to this day, fielding both a Men's and a Women's squad.\nClub rugby came onto the scene in 1973 with the founding of the Dayton Triangles RFC, named for the first champion of the National Football League, the Dayton Triangles. This name was soon changed to the Miami Valley Rugby Football Club (RFC), later changing its name to Dayton RFC. Wright State University RFC started in 1976 and lasted until 1981 at which point it moved off campus and turned into a Men's team Gem City RFC. Rugby would not return to Wright State University until 1998. \nIn the early 1980s, the Dayton RFC and Gem City RFC merged to form the Dayton Argylls RFC. This arrangement lasted until the early 1990s, when the Dayton Argylls RFC and the Wright-Patt Jets RFC merged.\nThe current squad logo, which gives the squad its nickname of Flying Pigs, is a winged wild boar, which was chosen as a merger of the Argylls’ boar logo and the Wright Patt Jets' jet aircraft logo.\nOver the years, rugby squads in the Dayton area have been very successful. In fifteens competition, the Wright Patt. Jets were Military National Champions. The Argylls, in their final season, placed third in the Midwest Division II Championship. The Flying Pigs qualified for the Midwest Division II Championships in both 1994, 1995, and 2011, placing second in 1994. Dayton has had success in rugby sevens as well, qualifying for the national championship in 1984 and 1985.\nIn 2016 Dayton added a second team, and currently compete in Midwest Divisions III &amp; IV.\nWomen's Squad.\nThe first women's squad was started in 1979 and lasted into the next decade. The Women's squad was reformed in 1999 by Lola Akinmade. The squad has been very successful, winning the Midwest Division II Women's Championship and finishing third in the nation in 2002. During part of its existence, the squad was merged with the women's squad of the Cincinnati Kelts; after a few years as the joint Cincinnati-Dayton Women's squad the team split in 2006 to rejoin their respective city clubs.\nVenues.\nThe club has lived up to its current name over the years, using many different venues around the Greater Dayton area. Before the team secured the use of green space for the permanent placement of at Eastwood, in 2007, venues they have used have included Dayton's Carillon Park and Centerville's Leonard E. Stubbs Memorial Park.\nIn January 2012, the independent Five Rivers Youth Rugby Foundation, (FRYRF), was formed in Dayton. Led by Chris Schreel and Frank Harris, FRYRF purchased the Fenner Fields baseball complex in north Dayton, renaming the facility as Dayton Rugby Grounds (DRG). The rugby community of the Dayton Area worked to turn the seven baseball diamonds into rugby pitches. Much of the work was carried out by volunteers from the club, which has established a Use Agreement with FRYRF to use DRG as their home pitch and beginning Fall of 2013.\nIn 2013, DRG finish leveling their second pitch and began use in the Fall of 2015."

Three-time Olympic medalist Vicky Sunohara has served as head coach since the 2011–12 season.\nHistory.\nOn December 12, 1922, the Lady Blues joined the Ladies Ontario Hockey Association (LOHA) and paid dues of eleven dollars: six dollars association fee, five dollars one time fee. The Lady Blues were the LOHA Provincial Champions in 1924. In 1925, the Lady Blues withdrew from the LOHA, taking issue with certain unsatisfactory aspects of competition and debate as to the acceptable definition of womanhood.\nIn 1993, (although the Lady Blues won 13 of the last 15 provincial championships), a task force recommended that the University of Toronto cut the team for financial reasons. Justine Blainey, a member of the team, organized a \"Save the Team\" night that raised over $8,000. She personally called 100 alumni during a one-week fundraising blitz. Blainey had previously earned national recognition as she endured five different court cases before finally having her case heard by the Supreme Court of Canada in 1986 because the Metro Toronto Hockey League denied her the opportunity to play hockey for them in 1981.\nDuring the 2000-01 regular season, the Lady Blues accumulated an undefeated record with 22 wins and no losses or ties. They outscored all opponents by a 114-14 margin. In the OUA playoffs, the Lady Blues defeated Toronto rival York University by a 4-1 mark and shut out Laurier 5-0 to win the OUA championship.\nHeading into the 2001 National Championships, the Lady Blues were seeded Number 1 overall. The Lady Blues first game was a resounding 12–1 victory over the hosting Calgary Dinos. In the semifinal, the Lady Blues would proceed to eliminate the McGill Martlets by a 4–1 tally. The championship game was a closer affair, with the Lady Blues besting the Regina Cougars in a 4-3 triumph. It was the Lady Blues first national championship in CIS women’s hockey. Of note, the Varsity Blues managed to defeat every other top team in the nation that season.

It was also a founding member of the Rugby-Bundesliga in 1971.\nHistory.\nFormed in 1923, the team, for the most part of its history, stood and stands in the shadow of local rival SC 1880 Frankfurt. In 1931, Julius Fischer became the first \"Eintracht\" player to appear for the German national rugby team.\nThe clubs rugby department achieved its first national success in 1940, when it reached the German championship final, losing 6-19 to FV 1897 Linden. It made a second finals appearance in 1965, this time losing 12-17 to TSV Victoria Linden.\nIn 1971, \"Eintracht\" became a founding member of the southern division of the Rugby-Bundesliga.\nThe club did not survive in the Rugby-Bundesliga however, eventually being relegated to the tier-three Rugby-Regionalliga Hesse, where it plays today. In the early 2000s, the team took part in the promotion round to the 2nd Rugby-Bundesliga South/West but did not succeed in achieving promotion to this level, instead remaining a top of the table side in the Regionalliga. It has won the local Hesse championship more than ten times since 1955.\nFrom 2010 onwards, Eintracht entered the new third division 3rd Liga South/West, where it played as a mid-table side. However, a league expansion saw the club return to the 2nd Bundesliga for 2012-13. In the 2012-13 season the club competed in the 2nd Bundesliga, finishing in the lower half of the table and qualifying for the play-offs for the Liga-Pokal.

        "text": "The Berliner SV 92 Rugby is a German rugby union from Berlin, currently playing in the 2. Rugby Bundesliga Ost. It is part of a larger club, the Berliner SV 92, which also offers other sports like association football, baseball and basketball.\nHistory.\nRugby union within the \"BSV 92\" club begun in 1936, the year of the Olympic games in Berlin and the tournament there. The rugby department of Tennis Borussia Berlin, having existed for just eight years and won five Berlin championships in this time, collectively left the club to join \"BSV\". The reasons for the move were the lack of support the rugby players got at \"Tennis Borussia\" and the fact that most players lived closer to \"BSV\", which was based in Wilmersdorf, while \"Tennis Borussia\" had their playing fields in Niederschönhausen.\nThe club provided a conveniently located playing field at \"Lochowdamm\" for the rugby players, who were led by Paul König. The new department continued its dominance in the Berlin championship, winning it once more in 1937 and providing the core to Berlin selection teams out of the eight rugby clubs in the city in the years before the war.\nWith Erwin Thiesies and \"Jonny\" Richter, the club provided two players to the team that achieved Germany's last rugby victory over France, a 3-0 on 27 March 1938 in Frankfurt am Main.\nThe Second World War brought an end to Berlin as a centre of German rugby and \"BSV 92\" lost many of its players during the war. It nevertheless resumed play, temporarily under the name of \"SG Wilmersdorf\", after the war, winning two more Berlin championships, in 1947 and 1948 before being restored to its old name in 1949.\nThe club's greatest moment came in 1948, when it reached the first post-Second World War final of the German rugby union championship, which it lost 0-30 to TSV Victoria Linden. It also marked the last appearance of a club from Berlin in the German final for over 40 years, until 1989, when the Berliner RC lost to the same club.\nPost-war rugby in Berlin mainly survived through the help of the allied occupation forces and the building of the Berlin wall in 1961 made playing the sport in the city even harder, cutting off many players in the now separate parts of the city. \"BSV\" continued to be a successful side in Berlin until 1956, winning all but the 1955 championship during this time, but none after that.\nIn 1965, the club suffered another blow when it lost many of its players associated with the local police to a new rugby department at the police sport club. The club managed to compensate for this loss in the early 1970s by developing a successful youth department.\n\"BSV 92\" was not part of the new Rugby-Bundesliga, formed in 1971 and remained in local competitions instead. It reached national level however in 2007, when it earned promotion to the 2nd Rugby-Bundesliga North/East, the second tier of German rugby. At this level, the club lasted for two seasons before returning to the tier-three Rugby-Regionalliga in 2009, where it played for two seasons. After a second place and the league champions, RK 03 Berlin II, declining promotion, BSV moved back up instead.\nA league reform in 2012 allowed the club promotion to the Bundesliga as the league was expanded from ten to 24 teams. BSV 92 finished fourth in their group in the 2012-13 season and qualified for the north/east division of the championship round, where it came eighth. The club opted to not play their first round play-off match, citing player shortage, and was thereby knocked out of the championship with the game awarded 50-0 to the opposition.\nThe club qualified for the championship round once more in 2013–14 but missed out on the play-offs after finishing seventh in its division. In the 2014–15 season the club finished fourth in the north-east DRV-Pokal group and was knocked out by RC Rottweil in the quarter-finals of the play-offs after a first round victory over TGS Hausen. For the 2015–16 season the club dropped back to the tier three Rugby-Regionalliga.\nRecent seasons.\nMen.\nRecent seasons of the club:"

        "text": "The Michigan State University Men's Volleyball Club was founded in the late 1950s and revived as a registered student organization at Michigan State University in 1987. It is currently a founding member of the Midwestern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association (\"MIVA\"), and registered with the National Collegiate Volleyball Federation (\"NCVF\"). The club competes in MIVA organized intercollegiate club competitions throughout the season and the season-ending NCVF National Championships. The club currently has four teams with progressive skill levels—Green, White, Posse, and Greenhorns. Club teams practice at the IM West Sports Arena and participate in a variety of club fundraising and community outreach and supportive activities, like Special Olympics and fundraising for the Greater Lansing Food Bank.\nClub history.\nThe MSU Men's Volleyball Club is a self-funded and directed student organization in East Lansing, MI at Michigan State University, relying on student leadership to organize and operate season-long practice and playing opportunities for MSU students. Club leaders are elected each year, and are responsible for administering a yearly budget, coordinating schedules and eligibility with school and league officials, planning practices and play and working cooperatively with coaches, sponsors, service providers and many others. Participant family members and friends frequently attend Club competitions.\nThe club has open gym hours in the evenings throughout the fall at the IM Sports West Arena. Club team tryouts are typically held at the IM Sports West in late September or early October each year. Club practice sessions take place 2 to 4 times per week during the pre-season, focusing on skill development, rules of the game, team building and placement, and competitive drills and play. Tryouts are open to any MSU student who is eligible under club and university rules.\nYearly operations.\nOn January 1 of each year, the official NCVF season begins. Typically Club teams practice at night and engage in conference and independently sponsored weekend competitions through April. Club teams play against other recognized collegiate club teams in MIVA league play, culminating in BTMVA, Midwestern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association, and NCVF championship events.\nUnlike most states in the Midwest, Michigan still does not sponsor boy's interscholastic high school volleyball. Still, the MSU club typically achieves a winning match percentage each year, and has earned several ten Top 10 National Championship finishes, 9 BTMVA Championships, 7 MIVA Championships and frequent top 25 rankings. In addition to practice and play, MSU players sponsor player clinics for junior players – from the inner-city of Detroit to the shores of Lake Michigan. MSU Green, the club's top squad, often travels out of region to represent the club and compete against other college clubs, engage in community service and promote the sport. The 50-team \"Spartan Back to the Hardwood Tournament,\" established in 1989, is the largest pre-season intercollegiate men's volleyball tournament in the nation, drawing club teams and USA Volleyball officials from throughout the United States and Canada.\nThe club and its coaches, volunteers and community members take great pride in teaching the game of volleyball to any eligible student willing to make a commitment, and who strives to promote the true values of sport. The club has produced MVPs and All-Americans at every position, a Gold Medal-winning USA Volleyball coach (Sante Perrelli), an NCAA Division 3 National Championship coach (Eric Lazowski) numerous AVP (professional beach volleyball) players, a US Olympic Men's \"B\" team member (Daniel Habeck), a MHSAA State Championship coach (Danile Potts(, several high school, junior club, NAIA and NCAA volleyball coaches, and an endearing alumni that travel back to the Banks of the Red Cedar each year to participate in charitable events, golf outings, tailgate parties, pasta dinners and of course, to play volleyball.\nAlumni.\nWorldwide, the MSU men's volleyball alumni family includes teachers, doctors, lawyers, dentists, engineers, economists, business executives, career military, scientists, and many other professionals. Former Club members can also be found working in business throughout Europe, pursuing volunteer missionary work in Africa, and spearheading agricultural, medical, technological and entrepreneurial efforts in China, the Middle East and throughout North America. Despite this geographical diversity, MSU alumni stay actively engaged by offering Club graduates counseling, job opportunities, friendship and a sense of MSU family that lasts long after graduation.\nAcademics.\nAcademic excellence has always been the club's #1 priority and a prerequisite for team participation. The club's graduation rate since 1987 is 99%, making it the most academically distinguished sports team (club or varsity) on campus.\nCoaching.\nThe club is coached by Sante Perrelli who helped students rejuvenate the club in 1987, and has been the club's head coach since that time. Coach Perrelli has USA Volleyball Impact, CAP Level 1 and CAP Level 2 coaching certifications and was named the 2006 National Coach of the Year. Gary Colberg, former Director of Competition for the NCVF National Championship\" said \"Perrelli's green machine is an organizational model for all collegiate sports to emulate. The Spartans' consistency of high performance is the results of excellent coaching, fiscal management and a commitment to national exposure.\"  Coach Perrelli founded the BTMVA (a division of the MIVA) in 1990 for Big Ten university men's volleyball club teams, and is president and co-founder of the MIVA, Lakeshore Region Volleyball Association, Inc., and the National Collegiate Volleyball Federation, Inc.\nTop 25 Ranking since 1989"

        "text": "Harry Myers (February 1875 – 19 December 1906) from Horsforth, Leeds was a Rugby Union and later Northern Union (rugby league) footballer who played in the 1890s and 1900s. He played rugby union for Horsforth, Bramley and Keighley and played one international match for England as well representative rugby for Yorkshire. In 1900 he changed codes to play rugby league (then known as Northern Union football). He died in 1906 after an accident during a game for Keighley against Dewsbury.\nPlaying career.\nRugby Union.\nMyers first played rugby for Horsforth whom he joined part way through the 1893–4 season. At the end of that season he joined Bramley for who he played for the next two seasons. Making his debut for Bramley against Werenth on 1 September 1894 he scored his first try for the club against Bowling Old Lane on 8 September 1894. In 1896 before the start of the 1896–7 season the Bramley club decided to change codes and join the Northern Rugby Union where professionalism i.e. payments to players was allowed. Myers did not wish to become a professional player so he left Bramley and opted to join Keighley instead, his resignation from Bramley being noted by the Yorkshire Rugby Football Union the same week.\nMyers arrival at Keighley coincided with an upturn in the club's fortunes and in the next four seasons the club won the Yorkshire No.2 Competition, with promotion to the No.1 competition, and after twice finishing runners-up the club won the No.1 competition in 1899–1900. During these four seasons Myers had been appointed captain of the team and had scored 49 tries as well as kicking 120 goals. His abilities were also recognised by the rugby union and he was selected to play for Yorkshire on a number of occasions in the County Championship. First selected for Yorkshire against Durham in November 1895, Myers played in every Yorkshire game for three consecutive seasons; 1895–6, 1896–7 and 1897–8.\nHe was capped once by England playing in the 6–9 defeat by Ireland at Athletic Ground, Richmond, London on Saturday 5 February 1898. He was also selected to play for the North against the South in February 1898.\nIn October 1898 press reports appeared that Myers had resigned from Keighley and was crossing codes to rejoin Bramley. Myers was asked to attend before the Yorkshire rugby union committee, but after explaining that he had been approached by Bramley and had rebuffed all offers made, the committee accepted that he was not guilty of professionalism.\nChange of code.\nIn April 1900, only days after being presented with the Yorkshire Rugby Union cup for winning the No.1 competition the Keighley club voted to leave the Rugby Union and join the Northern Rugby Union. This time Myers did decide to move codes and along with the rest of the Keighley team he voted in favour of the move.\nNorthern Union.\nMyers kicked the first points scored by Keighley as a Northern Union team when he kicked a drop goal in the club's first game under Northern Union rules against Manningham on 14 April 1900 - just two days after the club vote to change codes.\nKeighley were admitted into the Northern Union on 12 June 1900 and in August 1900 were placed in the west division of the Yorkshire Second Competition Myers captained the side for the next six seasons including fifth place in the league in 1905–6 and reaching the semi-finals of the Challenge Cup in the same season. Myers personal tally was 77 tries and 41 goals and in six seasons his longest absence from the side was six weeks recovering from a broken collar bone.\nIn April 1902 he played in the Yorkshire Senior Competition season-closing match between the league champions, Leeds and a team drawn from the rest of the competition - \"The Rest\" - and scored a try in a game won 7–5 by Leeds at Headingley Stadium.\nSelected to play in the Yorkshire trial match, Possibles v Probables, in October 1902 Myers was subsequently selected as reserve for the county side but he informed the committee that unless he was a member of the team he was not playing for the county at all; he was not selected. Despite this he did earn one county cap, against Durham and Northumberland in April 1903.\nIn 1904 Myers was awarded a benefit game by Keighley and the game chosen was the match against his old club Bramley on 15 October 1904, Keighley won the game and the gate earning totalled £54/7/3 which was passed to Myers.\nDeath.\nOn 3 November 1906 Keighley played Dewsbury at Crown Flatt. Late in the first half Myers recovered a loose ball and was running head-down towards the Dewsbury goal line when he collided with Fred Richardson, one of the Dewsbury forwards. Myers' head hit Richardson's shoulder and both fell over. Richardson was bruised but was able to regain his feet but Myers remained unconscious on the ground. Myers was carried to the dressing room where a doctor examined him and recommended that he be taken to hospital. Myers was taken to Dewsbury Infirmary, conscious on arrival he complained of pain in the neck and was unable to move his arms or legs. The doctors who assessed him were sure there were severe spinal injuries but due to swellings at the site of the injury they could not confirm the full nature of the injury. X-rays detected no fracture of the spine and the doctors concluded that the paralysis was caused by an internal haemorrhage putting pressure on the spine. The injury also made breathing difficult. Myers was able to talk and one of his first actions was to absolve Richardson of any fault for the incident and that it was solely an accident.\nSuch was the interest in Myers' condition that daily bulletins about his condition were released and reported in many local papers across the North of England. On 6 December he was transferred to Keighley and District Victoria Hospital to be closer to his family. Further examination, once the swelling had reduced, showed that there was a fracture between the sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae with complete severing of the spinal cord. It had already been concluded that there would be no recovery from the injuries but his condition remained unchanged until 18 December when his condition deteriorated and he died in the evening of 19 December 1906.\nThe jury at the subsequent inquest, held at Keighley Police Station on 21 December 1906, returned a verdict of accidental death. The coroner, Edgar Wood, concluded that \"there did not seem to blame attached to anyone\" and \"that Harry Myers, on Saturday Nov. 3rd 1906, while playing a game of Rugby football on the Crown Flatts ground, Dewsbury, collided suddenly with another player and sustained a fracture, dislocation of the back, and laceration of the spinal cord, resulting in death on the 19th inst. at the Victoria Hospital, Keighley.\"\nMyers' funeral was held on 23 December 1906. The funeral procession marched from the Worth Valley Hotel at Ingrow to Keighley Parish Church where the service was conducted by the Reverend H. J. Palmer, Rector of Keighley. Myers was buried in Utley cemetery and it was estimated that over 10,000 people lined the route of the procession.\nPersonal life.\nMyers married Ada Winstanley in December 1898 and they had four children. Originally employed in the textile trade, from 1901 Myers was manager of the Fleece Inn in Keighley and in 1903 he became the licensee of the nearby Brunswick Arms in Keighley. In April 1906 he took over the licence of the Worth Valley Hotel in Ingrow and it was here that he and his family resided at the time of his death. After his death Ada took over the licence.\nSee also.\nList of rugby league players who died during matches"

        "text": "Harry Bradshaw (17 April 1868 – 31 December 1910) was an English rugby union, and professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1890s. He played representative level rugby union (RU) for England and Yorkshire, and at club level for Bramley, as a forward, e.g. front row, lock, or back row, and club level rugby league (RL) for Leeds, as a forward. Prior to Tuesday 2 June 1896, Bramley was a rugby union club.\nBackground.\nHarry Bradshaw was born in Bramley, West Riding of Yorkshire, England, he died aged 42 in Halifax, West Riding of Yorkshire, England.\nPlaying career.\nInternational honours.\nHarry Bradshaw won caps for England (RU) while at Bramley in 1892 against Scotland, in 1893 against Wales, Ireland, and Scotland, and in 1894 against Wales, Ireland, and Scotland.\nIn the early years of rugby football the \"goal\" was to score goals, and a try had zero value, but it provided the opportunity to \"try\" at goal, and \"convert\" the try to a goal with an unopposed kick at the goal posts. The point values of both the try and goal have varied over time, and in the early years footballers could \"score\" a try, without scoring any points.\nChange of Code.\nWhen Bramley converted from the rugby union code to the rugby league code on Tuesday 2 June 1896, Harry Bradshaw would have been 28 years of age. Consequently, he was both a rugby union and rugby league footballer.\nContemporaneous Quote.\nThe first game of the 1894 Home Nations Championship for Wales was against England, and they suffered a heavy defeat, losing 24-3. In an after match interview Wales' winger Norman Biggs was asked why he had failed to tackle England's forward Harry Bradshaw, who scored the first try; Biggs responded \"Tackle him? It was as much as I could do to get out of his way!\"."

Of these five, only Robertson, Walton and Sampson were three-time UPI Players of the Year.\nUCLA had the most all-time winners with six. Ohio State was second with four winners, while Cincinnati and Virginia were tied for third with three winners apiece. Five other schools had two winners and sixteen schools had only one UPI Player of the Year.\nEight of the winners were sophomores, seven were juniors, and the remaining 27 were seniors. No freshman was ever presented the award."

The squad currently plays in the Rugby-Bundesliga, the highest level of the German rugby league system. Other sports practised at St. Pauli are American football, association football, and baseball.\nWhile the men's team has had limited success over the years, St. Pauli's women are one of the most successful teams in Germany, having reached every championship final from 1995 to 2008 and winning eight out of the fourteen.\nHistory.\nSt Pauli 's rugby department was formed in 1933 when two Jewish brothers, Otto and Paul Lang from Heidelberg, were forced to leave their club, the \"SV St. Georg\", and joined FC St Pauli. In April 1933, the FC St Pauli board called for the formation of a rugby team and the club's 6th football XI decided to switch codes and play rugby instead.\nIt took the team over a year to achieve their first draw but it soon improved and won its first \"Nordmark\" championship, against bitter rival Hamburger SV Rugby. It repeated this success in 1938 and 1939.\nThe club resumed playing rugby in 1947, at first against teams of the British occupation force in Germany, but soon in the \"Nordmark\" championship again, which it won uninterruptedly from 1948 to 1958.\nIn the early 1960s, St Pauli faced strong opposition from local rival \"SV Polizei Hamburg\" and the \"Nordmark\" championship became a Hamburg-only competition after the last of the teams from Kiel was dissolved.\nThe club's men's team reached its only German championship final in 1964, when it lost 0-11 to DSV 78 Hannover after having beaten favourites SC Neuenheim in Heidelberg in the semi-finals.\nFC St Pauli Rugby was one of the founding members of the new Rugby-Bundesliga in 1971 and, in the first three seasons, was a competitive side there. An ageing team and a slacking in the youth development led to the club's relegation in 1975, temporarily even setting a negative Bundesliga record with a 3-102 defeat against TSV Victoria Linden.\nUpon return to the Hamburg championship, the club faced strong competition from Hamburger SV, Hamburger RC and Hamburg Exiles RFC, but was able to win the local championship another eight times between 1976 and 1988. In this era, the club suffered from financial difficulties, brought upon by the professional football team.\nThe year 1988 brought two important changes to the club. The men's team finally returned to the Rugby-Bundesliga, and a women's team was formed.\nThe team managed to survive for only two seasons in the Bundesliga and earned another record defeat against Victoria Linden, this time a 0-113.\nInstead, the club's women's team begun to shine from 1995 onwards, earning its first German championship that year.\nWhile the women's team continued its success throughout the years, winning eight German championships until 2008, the men's side was able to establish itself on the second level of German rugby, the 2nd Rugby-Bundesliga, where it plays as a mid-table side.\nIn the season 2011/12 the 1st men's team won the title of the 2nd Rugby-Bundesliga North/East. On the first of May 2012 they competed in a final against the winner of the second tier league in the south Frankfurt 1880 II. The game was played in Hamburg and St. Pauli lost 22:32. The title in the north earned St. Pauli the right for a promotion to the highest level of rugby played in Germany the Rugby-Bundesliga. St. Pauli finished second in their group in the 2012-13 season and qualified for the north/east division of the championship round, where it came fourth. The club was knocked out in the first round of the play-offs after losing 30–13 to SC 1880 Frankfurt.\nIn 2013–14 the team qualified for the championship round and the play-offs once more, losing to SC Neuenheim in the first round. In the 2014–15 season the club finished sixth in the north-east championship group but was knocked out of the first round of the play-offs after a 78–0 loss to RG Heidelberg.\nRecent seasons.\nRecent seasons of the club:\nRugby internationals.\nIn Germany's 2006–08 European Nations Cup campaign, FC St Pauli's captain Friedrich Michau was called up for the national team.\nHorst Wohler, with 30 internationals, is the club's most capped player."

A small forward, he played in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for five teams from 1971 to 1976, posting career averages of 5.2 points per game and 1.9 rebounds per game.\nBorn in Ames, Iowa, Gibbs attended Ames High School and played on their basketball team in 1967, helping them reach the state championship game. Following a period at Burlington Junior College, he played college basketball for the University of Texas at El Paso Miners from 1969 to 1971. Gibbs scored 10.5 points per game in the 1969–70 season, when the Miners won the Western Athletic Conference championship in their first season in the league. In the last game of the regular season, Gibbs sustained an injury and was unable to play in the NCAA Tournament; the Miners lost in the first round. Their coach, Don Haskins, later said, \"Without him, we had no chance to go very far in the tournament.\"\nGibbs improved his scoring average to 17.4 points per game in 1970–71, and his 10.6 rebounds per game were up from the 8.5 he had averaged the previous season. Both totals were team highs. At the end of the season, he was named to the All-Western Athletic Conference team. As of 2012, he was fourth in Miners history with 9.7 rebounds per game for his career.\nIn the third round of the 1971 NBA draft, Gibbs was selected by the Chicago Bulls with the 49th overall pick. He was traded to the Houston Rockets in June 1971, the first of five trades he was involved in during his career. After playing the 1971–72 season with the Rockets, Gibbs was on four other teams over the next four seasons—the Kansas City–Omaha Kings, Seattle SuperSonics, Washington Bullets, and Buffalo Braves. With the SuperSonics in 1973–74, he posted a career-high of 10.8 points per game. He was dealt along with a 1975 third-round selection from the SuperSonics to the Bullets for Archie Clark on August 19, 1974. The next season, he was a member of the Bullets team that reached the 1975 NBA Finals. Following his playing career, Gibbs ran a drug treatment facility in Newport Beach, California."

In his career, he played 208 games in the AHL and 50 games in Deutsche Eishockey Liga.\nPlaying career.\nReed was drafted 93rd overall in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft by the Carolina Hurricanes. Reed played major junior hockey in the Ontario Hockey League with the London Knights, Sarnia Sting and Guelph Storm. After his final year of eligibility with the Storm in 2007–08, Harrison signed with the Hurricanes to a three-year entry level contract on May 22, 2008.\nReed was assigned to AHL affiliate, the Albany River Rats for his first professional season in 2008–09. He played in 70 games scoring 9 points with the Rats and also played a solitary game with ECHL affiliate, the Florida Everblades.\nHarrison started the 2009–10 season with the River Rats, along with a brief stint with the Everblades, before he was traded by the Hurricanes with Stephane Yelle to the Colorado Avalanche for Cedric Lalonde-McNicoll and a sixth-round draft pick on March 3, 2010. He was then assigned to Avalanche affiliate, the Lake Erie Monsters, for the remainder of the season.\nOn September 1, 2011, it was announced that Reed signed a contract with the Toledo Walleye of the ECHL. In the 2011–12 season, Reed scored a respectable 33 points in 52 games with the Walleye, earning two AHL try-out contracts with former team, the Lake Erie Monsters and the Houston Aeros.\nA free agent, on September 5, 2012, Reed signed a one-year contract to remain in the ECHL with the Stockton Thunder.

        "title": "Eleven Cities Cycling Tour",
        "text": "The Eleven Cities Cycling Tour (, West Frisian: \"Alvestêdetocht op de fyts\") was originally a bicycle race in Friesland, Netherlands. In recent years, due to the number of participants, it has become a bicycle tour. It is the cycling counterpart of the Elfstedentocht ice-skating tour which is held irregularly on frozen waterways in the same region. The event attracts annually more than 15,000 participants and is considered one of the best cycle tours in the Netherlands. \nHistory.\nDue to the popularity of the Eleven Cities Skating tour, a similar tour was hosted for cyclists in the beginning of the 20th century. In 1912 the first cycling tour was organised. It started out as a competition, and was organised when the skating counterpart wasn't organised due to the weather. Since 1947, the tour has been organised annually on Whit Monday, a Dutch Bank holiday. Although the tour started out as a race, from 1958 it was hosted as a tour in order to prevent serious injuries. Due to popular interest by non-professional cyclist, and the sometimes less-ideal conditions of the road, it was considered to be too dangerous to race. To prevent enthusiasts from racing anyway, participants are to keep in mind a maximum average speed of 25 km/h between check points.\nRoute.\nThe cycling tour's route differs from its counterpart on skates: the cycling tour starts and ends in Bolsward rather than in Leeuwarden. The tour takes the participants through the eleven ancient cities of the province of Frisia. The tour is currently limited to 15,000 entrants. Between 05:00 and 08:00, entrants leave Bolsward every eight minutes in batches of 600 participants. Those who complete the 235 km tour before midnight are entitled to a medal.\nTypes of bicycles.\nWhile most participants use a racing bicycle, other types of bikes can be seen as well. A small percentage participates on tandem bicycles, European city bicycles both with and without gears, rowing cycles and handcycles. Even penny-farthings have been used for the tour."

        "title": "Rugby World Cup 2011 (video game)",
        "text": "Rugby World Cup 2011 is a rugby union video game developed by HB Studios and 505 Games.\nThe game is the official video game of the 2011 Rugby World Cup, and was released on both the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 for the PAL region in August 2011. It was released in North America in September 2011, with the PlayStation 3 version available via the PlayStation Store and the Xbox 360 version via Xbox Live Arcade.\nDetails.\nNo rugby union game had been produced for four years since \"Rugby 08\", which was also developed by HB Studios, then under the EA Sports label. It was announced on 29 March 2010 that The Rugby Forum and its members, would help HB studios gain a better understanding of what the general rugby-supporting public wanted in the new title.\nFor the first time in the series of rugby games developed by HB Studios, the title has a player editor, but it is limited to attributes and names only.\nModes.\nTournament Mode.\nThis mode, which is the only area of the game in which most of the official stadia appear, is based entirely on the real-life tournament. As such it can be competed in as any of the 20 participating teams, with a schedule of pool matches to match the actual tournament (although users can also choose to have the pools re-drawn randomly, as game developers try to extend the game’s longevity by providing reason for players to complete the tournament more than once).\nThis is the only mode on the game which allows for full-length matches to be played in the official tournament jerseys.\nInternational Test.\nThis mode allows for contests between any of the 20 included teams, at any stadium included in the game (except those stadia exclusive to the ‘Tournament Mode’). Similar to one-off matches in the FIFA series, for example, the match situation is a ‘one-off friendly’ and can be taken to a combination of extra-time and/or a place-kick shootout if the scores are tied after the last play of the match.\nWarm-up Tour.\nThis mode allows users to take a team on a tour of teams in their opposite hemispheres, although to play the stronger sides the user must first complete two tours of weaker nations. For example, to tour to the Tri-Nations teams with a northern hemisphere team, the user must first complete a 'Pacific Islands Tour', encountering Tonga, Samoa and Fiji; and also a 'South Atlantic Tour', encountering Namibia and Argentina. To tour to the Six Nations countries with a southern hemisphere team, the user must again complete two tours: 'North American Tour', meeting United States and Canada; and then 'Eastern Tour', meeting Romania, Russia, Georgia and Japan.\nPlace Kick Shootout.\nThis mode allows for the user to contest a place-kick competition between any two included teams of their choosing. The match takes place in ‘Auckland’ stadium (Eden Park), and is set at night.\nTeams.\nThe game features all twenty international teams competing in the 2011 Rugby World Cup. However, only ten of the teams are officially licensed. Teams such as the All Blacks (New Zealand), and the Wallabies (Australia), are unlicensed due to their exclusive licensing deal with rival video game Rugby Challenge.\nTrailer.\nThe trailer of the game was released in July 2011.\nDemo.\nA demo was released on 2 August on Xbox Live and 3 August on the PlayStation Network. The playable teams are South Africa and England, and the venue is Auckland.\nReception.\nThe game received \"mixed\" reviews on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.\n\"The Daily Telegraph\" gave the Xbox 360 version a score of three stars out of five and said that its most disappointing aspect \"is just how threadbare it is in terms of modes.\" \"The Guardian\" similarly gave it three stars out of five and said that \"there's just too little on offer here to justify the cost for a full-priced, boxed retail release.\" \"The Digital Fix\" gave it a score of four out of ten and said that it \"stinks of under investment and cheap development shortcuts. It feels like a budget arcade game shoved into a shiny full-priced release and an officially licensed sticker stuck on top.\""

        "text": "The Stahl Hennigsdorf Rugby is a German rugby union from Hennigsdorf, currently playing in the tier-four Regionalliga East B. The team is part of a larger club, the Stahl Hennigsdorf, which also offers other sports like volleyball, table tennis and boxing.\nThe club, located in former East Germany, was the most successful rugby team in the country, having won 27 national championships from 1952 to 1990, when the last championship was held.\nThe term \"Stahl\" is the German word for steel and refers to the club's connection to the local steelworks.\nThe club is located in the Oberhavel district, north west of Berlin. The district is home to two more rugby union clubs, RU Hohen Neuendorf and Veltener RC.\nHistory.\nEast Germany.\nThe club was formed in 1948 when Erwin Thiesies, a former German rugby international for Berliner SV, brought the game to Hennigsdorf. He tried to find a home for the sport in the \"BSG Motor Hennigsdorf\" but found the club uninterested. He was more successful when contacting \"BSG Stahl Hennigsdorf\" and a rugby department was formed.\nAfter originally playing sides from Berlin, the club soon established contacts to teams in Hanover. Erwin Thiesies, by being employed through the local steel works, became the full-time coach of \"Stahl\" and was able to travel abroad to watch games and improve his knowledge of the game.\n\"Stahl\" became the first East German rugby union champion in 1952 and defended this title the following year but then had to wait a number of years for another title. In this era, the club provided the core of the East German team, together with DHfK Leipzig and ASK Vorwärts Berlin. \"Stahl\", until the German reunion, continued to provide the core of the national team.\n\"Stahl's\" most dominating time came from 1965 to 1977, when the club won the national title in every season but one, 1972, when Stahl Leegebruch took out the championship.\nIn 1977, Erwin Thiesies finally retired as the club's coach and was replaced by Wolfgang Götsch, a 20-time GDR international with 700 games for \"Stahl\" to his name. Under him, the team was rejuvenated and three runners-up finishes from 1978 to 1980 were achieved.\nFrom 1981, \"Stahl\" returned to its old dominance, winning ten championships in a row, including the last one ever held in East Germany, in 1990. It bowed out of East German rugby history by winning the cup competition as well that year.\nGermany.\nWith the German reunion, the changes in society and the freedom of travel, the club experienced a substantial loss of players. In 1991, the club took part in the Rugby-Bundesliga qualification round, where, after a weak start, it succeeded by winning its last eight games. Additionally, the club's name was altered from \"BSG Stahl\" to \"SV Stahl\".\nIt lasted for only one season at this level, being relegated to the 2nd Rugby-Bundesliga in 1992. A year later, on 18 February 1993, the club's founding father, Erwin Thiesies, died, aged 84.\nIn 1998, after over 20 years as coach of \"Stahl\", Wolfgang Götsch resigned from his position due to illness, to be replaced by his assistant Udo Schimroszik. Two years later, in 2000, the club returned to the Rugby-Bundesliga. But again the club lasts for only one season, returning to the 2nd Bundesliga in 2001.\n\"Stahl\" remained in this league as a top of the table side in the coming years, despite suffering from a lack of players, especially in 2005-06. The club reached a low point after this season, for the first time in its history it was unable to field a side and did not take part in the German league system in 2006-07. The following season, it fielded a combined team, together with the reserve side of local rival RU Hohen Neuendorf, in the lowest division, the tier-four Regionalliga East B. This partnership however lasted for only one season.\nThe club fielded its own, independent team in the fourth division in 2008-09 and continues to do so in 2009-10. It won the league title in 2009 and played in the Regionalliga East in autumn 2009, where it finished sixth and had to play in the B division in spring 2010.\nRecent seasons.\nRecent seasons of the club:"

        "text": "The Wilson Cup is an Australian ice hockey trophy first introduced in 2007 and named after John and Carol Wilson. The Cup was awarded to the winner of the New South Wales (NSW) pre-season tournament involving all NSW teams in the Australian Ice Hockey League (AIHL) between 2007 and 2016. Since 2017 the Wilson Cup has been awarded to the winner of the regular season four game series between the two Sydney based AIHL teams, the Sydney Bears and Sydney Ice Dogs.\nHistory.\nThe Wilson Cup was founded in 2007 as the trophy for a pre-season tournament involving all the AIHL NSW teams, including Western Sydney Ice Dogs, Newcastle North Stars, AIHL Bears and Central Coast Rhinos. The Cup was donated and named on behalf of former Blacktown Ice Arena owners John and Carol Wilson, major figures in Australian ice hockey at the time.\nBetween 2007 and 2009 the pre-season tournament was contested between the four NSW teams in a round-robin event that promoted youth players. Each team played each other home and away and concluded with a play-off and final. The AIHL Bears (Sydney Bears) won the inaugural tournament and lifted the Wilson Cup in 2007. The Bears went back to back in 2008 by defeating the Western Sydney Ice Dogs 4-3 in the final. In 2009 the Central Coast Rhinos won their first Wilson Cup by beating the Ice Dogs 4-3 in a shootout in the final despite the Rhinos subsequently dropping out of the 2009 AIHL season.\nWith Central Coast leaving the AIHL the Wilson Cup was not contested between 2010 and 2013.\nIn 2014, the Wilson Cup was resurrected with the Sydney Bears, Sydney Ice Dogs and Newcastle Northstars all featuring in the pre-season tournament for the Cup between 16 March and 5 April 2014. The round-robin format was retained but the top two placed teams went straight to a final for the Wilson Cup. Newcastle defeated the Bears 4-3 in a shootout in the opening match of the tournament. In game two, the Ice Dogs prevailed 5-4 over the North Stars also in a shootout. In the third and final match of the round-robin, the Ice Dogs secured a big 8-1 victory over the Bears to finish top and qualify for the final. The Ice Dogs were joined by Newcastle who finished second and the two teams face-off in the Wilson Cup final for 2014. The Ice Dogs beat the North Stars 4-2 in the final to clinch their first Wilson Cup title.\nMarch 2015, the 2015 Wilson Cup tournament was announced with a double round-robin and final format change that saw the overall number of matches increased from 4 to 7. The Sydney Bears finished top of the round-robin stage with three wins from four matches. The Newcastle North Stars finished runner-up and qualified for the final against the Bears. Newcastle secured their first Wilson Cup triumph in the 2015 Wilson Cup final with a 4-3 victory over the Bears.\nThe 2016 Wilson Cup featured an unchanged format from the prior year and ran from 19 March to 16 April 2016. The Sydney Bears finished first in the round robin stage for the second year in a row with three wins from four games. Defending champions the Newcastle North Stars finished last after losing all four of their games, including one which had to be forfeited due to a scheduling conflict with their East Coast Super League club. The Bears defeated the Sydney Ice Dogs 3–1 in the final at the Penrith Ice Palace to secure their third Wilson Cup title eight years after their last success.\nIn 2017, due to the Bears and Ice Dogs being in the process of moving to Macquarie Ice Rink in northern Sydney ahead of the 2017 AIHL season, the pre-season tournament for the Wilson Cup was not held. As a result, the Wilson Cup was re-purposed as the trophy awarded to the winner of the AIHL regular season series between the Sydney Bears and Sydney Ice Dogs, dropping the Newcastle Northstars from contention for the Cup. The Bears retained the title and lifted the Wilson Cup for the fourth time after the regular season series was tied on both wins and goal difference.\n2018 maintained the Sydney derby regular season series as the format for winning the Wilson Cup. The Ice Dogs took a 2 game lead in the 2018 series in May with a convincing 5-1 victory followed by a 3-2 shootout win. The Bears struck back in July to bring up a grand stand finish to the series with a shutout 5-0 victory. In the fourth and final match of the series the Ice Dogs came out on top with a high scoring 7-2 victory to secure the series 3-1 and the team’s second Wilson Cup.\nIn 2019, the Sydney Bears regained the Wilson Cup for a record fifth time after claiming a 4-0 series victory over the Sydney Ice Dogs. The Bear's claimed the trophy with a game to spare in July 2019.\nIn 2022, following a two year absence due to the AIHL seasons being cancelled, the Sydney Bears repeated their 2019 feat by winning with Wilson Cup following a 4-0 clean sweep series victory over the Sydney Ice Dogs.\nWinners.\nYear on year.\nThe final results for the Wilson Cup each and every season\nBy team.\nTotal number of Wilson Cup's won by teams in the AIHL throughout the Cup's entire history."

        "text": "The 1960 United States men's Olympic basketball team competed in the Games of the XVII Olympiad in Rome, Italy, representing the United States of America.\nThe USA team, coached by California Golden Bears head coach Pete Newell, dominated the competition, winning its games by an average of 42.4 points per game. The team is considered by many to be the best amateur level basketball team of all time, and was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a unit, in 2010.\nOlympic trials.\nTrials for the team were held in March and April 1960, in Denver, at the Denver Coliseum. The trials were conducted in the form of an eight team tournament, including teams from the reigning NCAA National Champions, the Ohio State Buckeyes, a team of NCAA All-Stars featuring stars such as Jerry West and Oscar Robertson, an NAIA All-Star team, and the AAU Champions, the Peoria Caterpillar Cats. The NCAA All-Stars won the competition convincingly, and so Pete Newell was named the team's head coach, with Warren Womble as his assistant.\nThe trials came at a time when the AAU and NCAA were wrestling for control of USA Basketball, and the make-up of the team represented that uneasy truce, as the team was made up of seven collegiate stars, four AAU players, and one representative of the US Armed Forces (guard Adrian Smith). This compromise meant that many top college players were left off the team, including Ohio State's John Havlicek and Providence guard Lenny Wilkens.\nOlympic tournament.\nThe team went 8–0 in the Olympic basketball tournament, held in Rome, averaging 101.9 points per game and holding their opponents to 59.5. Five Americans averaged double-figures in scoring - Oscar Robertson (17.3), Jerry Lucas (16.8), Jerry West (14.1), Terry Dischinger (11.3) and Adrian Smith (10.9). Lucas was the star of the medal round, as he scored 21 points in the gold medal game against Brazil, after having scored 26 points in the previous game against host Italy.\nLegacy.\nThe 1960 team is thought to be one of the best amateur sports teams in basketball history. Nine members of the squad went on to play in the NBA and four players from the team - Robertson, Lucas, West and Walt Bellamy, have individually been elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, as have head coach Pete Newell and Dutch Lonborg, who was on Newell's staff as team manager. Other career distinctions by team members include Robertson's League MVP Award in 1963-64. Dischinger's 1963 NBA Rookie of the Year Award (an award also received by Robertson (1961), Bellamy (1962), and Lucas(1964), Adrian Smith's NBA All-Star Game MVP in 1966, and West's NBA Finals MVP in 1969. Eight members were selected to at least one NBA All-Star Game (Bob Boozer, Darrall Imhoff and Adrian Smith were NBA All-Star Game participants during their careers. In total, there were 43 All-Star berths amongst the teammates. The team was elected to the US Olympic Hall of Fame in 1984.\nIn 2010, along with the \"Dream Team,\" the 1960 US Olympic men's basketball team was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a unit. The election marks only the seventh and eighth teams so honored."

        "text": "Roger Sherman (January 4, 1872 – January 20, 1957) was an American college football player, coach and lawyer. He played college football for the University of Michigan from 1890 to 1893 and coached the University of Iowa football team in 1894. In late 1895, he was implicated in a series of articles by Caspar Whitney alleging that the schools of the Western Conference had been corrupted by \"professionalism\" involving the payment of money to athletes for their services in playing football. Sherman practiced law in Chicago, Illinois, and served as a master of chancery of the Superior Court and president of the Chicago Bar Association and Illinois State Bar Association.\nBiography.\nEarly years.\nSherman was born in Chicago, Illinois, in 1872 and attended Chicago's Hyde Park High School. He played two years of football for Hyde Park in the Cook County High School League. He was captain of a Hyde Park team that \"was never defeated and won the pennant.\"\nMichigan.\nSherman enrolled at the University of Michigan, where he played at the quarterback and end positions for the Michigan Wolverines football team in 1890, 1891 and 1893. At 5 feet, 7 inches, he was the shortest player on the Michigan team. In November 1891, the \"Chicago Daily Tribune\" wrote: \"Sherman at quarter back, although not a swift passer, is cool-headed and is nearly always to be found near the ball.\"\nWhile attending the University of Michigan, Sherman was also a member of the school's banjo club. In April 1892, Sherman performed with Michigan's banjo and glee clubs at Chicago's Central Music Hall. At the time, the \"Chicago Daily Tribune\" reported: \"Sherman is equally handy at football or at a banjo, but, as the former game is out of season, it is reasonable to suppose that his present efforts in Chicago will be confined to music.\"\nSherman completed five years' of study in four years, earning a bachelor's degree in 1894 while simultaneously completing the first year of law school.\nIowa.\nIn 1894, Sherman was hired as the head football coach at the University of Iowa. One of Sherman's players, Michael L. McKinley, recalled: \"In 1894 the athletic committee made arrangements with Roger Sherman, a famous Michigan end, to coach the team for the fall season.\" Sherman coached the entire team at Iowa—line, ends and backs. He led the Hawkeyes to a 4–4–1 record in his one year as head coach.\n1895 recruiting scandal.\nIn the fall of 1895, Caspar Whitney wrote a series of articles in \"Harper's Weekly\" contending that \"professionalism\" had corrupted collegiate athletics among the Western Conference schools, including Wisconsin, Northwestern, Minnesota and Michigan. One of Whitney's accusations was that Sherman, who he described as \"Michigan's manager,\" had on October 6, 1895, while riding on a Chicago cable car, offered a Chicago Athletic Association player named Stevenson the sum of $600 to finish the season with the Michigan team. Sherman denied Whitney's charge in an interview with the \"Chicago Daily Tribune\":\nStevenson had said he expected to go to Michigan to take a law course, and it was naturally expected he would join the team. When the Michigan team went into training at Omena early in the season, it was expected Stevenson would join the team, and when it was learned he would play for the athletic association Baird, the manager, wrote to me to see him and find out if he was coming to Michigan. I went to the Athletic club to see him and met him starting for a game at the Athletic Association field. I got on the car and rode with him and had a talk with him. I wanted to know if he was going to Michigan, as they had expected him. I made him no offer and held out no inducements to him, as I had no authority to do so, even had I wanted to, from Baird or any one else.\nMichigan supporters denied Whitney's charges and, as proof that Whitney's account was wild and unreliable, noted that he had erroneously identified Sherman as Michigan's manager. Whitney stood his ground and explained:\nAs to Stevenson, I have charged he was offered $600 by Roger Sherman, as manager of the Michigan team, to play with that eleven. I erred in an immaterial detail, which Michigan men have seized upon in order to dodge the issue. They deny that he made such an offer, or that he was manager of the eleven. The facts are as follows: Sherman managed the summer trip and training of the team at Omena, a summer resort on Traverse Bay, Michigan. Charles Baird was the regular manager, and was the one who originally conducted the negotiations with Stevenson, which Sherman knew about and talked over with Stevenson in the Chicago cable car Oct. 5, 1895. Mr. Sherman admitted this to me before a witness in Chicago Dec. 17, 1895. Mr. Sherman is a young lawyer of excellent repute and will not deny this statement. Besides, Stevenson has admitted it.\nLater, Sherman responded by challenging the assertion that matters were purer in the East and with a pragmatic defense of professionalism as \"an evil, but not an unmixed evil,\" and \"a bad means to a good end.\" In an essay published by \"The Inlander\", Sherman wrote:\nIn order to get the support of the college body and the public in general a team must first win at almost any cost. Students will not support a losing team be it ever so pure, nor will the public pay to see such a team play ball. ... To declare for purity at the outset means a weak team and, as a consequence, defeat and lack of support, moral and financial, for years to come, maybe for ever. The power that a manager has to help men through college, if judiciously exercised, is productive of a great deal of good. Many of the best players are in the neediest of circumstances. It is only right that they should be helped through college in return for their sacrifices on the football field. ... The actual facts in this case are these: The most successful teams in the country today have built up their reputations and their successes by the judicious expenditure of money in securing the services of good players. That nearly all of them cling to this practice is well known to those who are in the possession of the true state of facts.\nLegal career.\nSherman enrolled at the Northwestern University School of Law and received a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1895. He began the practice of law in Chicago with his father, Penoyer L. Sherman, a master in the chancery court. In 1897, he practiced law with two other attorneys in the firm of Church, McMurdy &amp; Sherman. Sherman was active in politics in Chicago's Sixth Ward and was appointed master in chancery of the Superior Court in 1906. He served as a chancery master from 1906 to 1907 and as the Assistant State's Attorney in Chicago from 1907 to 1908. As of 1918, he was in private practice as one of three partners in the firm of Tenney, Harding &amp; Sherman.\nHe later served as the president of the Chicago Bar Association (1922–1923) and president of the Illinois State Bar Association (1923–1924). He continued in private practice for many years thereafter with the firm of Tenney, Sherman, Rogers &amp; Guthrie.\nLater years.\nIn his later years, Sherman lived at 213 Linden Street in Winnetka, Illinois. He also had a winter home in Pompano Beach, Florida. In 1957, Sherman died at age 85 at his winter home in Pompano Beach. He was survived by his wife, the former Grace Buttolph, and two daughters, Mrs. Philip M. Watrous and Mrs. Robert K. Vincent."

        "text": "The Stony Brook Seawolves baseball team represents Stony Brook University in NCAA Division I men's college baseball. Stony Brook currently competes in the Coastal Athletic Association (CAA) and plays its home games on Joe Nathan Field. Matt Senk has coached the team since the beginning of the 1991 season. The team has won the America East tournament six times in 2004, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2015, and 2019. In 2011, the Seawolves claimed their first America East regular season championship. Stony Brook has participated in the NCAA tournament on six separate occasions, winning its first game in 2010.\nIn 2012, the Seawolves clinched their second consecutive regular season championship and their fourth America East Conference baseball tournament championship, earning the league's automatic bid to the 2012 NCAA Division I baseball tournament. The team went on to win the Coral Gables Regional and the Baton Rouge Super Regional, becoming the first ever team from the America East Conference to advance to the Men's College World Series.\nHistory.\nPre-Division I era (1966–98).\nStony Brook first fielded NCAA–sanctioned baseball in 1966. The program struggled hard initially, posting only six winning seasons until the hiring of Matt Senk as head coach in 1991. Senk's leadership helped the team succeed at the Division III level, and Stony Brook finished 1995 with a 30–8 record and a trip to their first Division III NCAA tournament. Stony Brook shortstop Joe Nathan was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the sixth round with the 159th overall pick in the 1995 MLB Draft. He debuted for the Giants in 1999 as a pitcher, becoming the first player in program history to play in the MLB.\nEarly years in Division I (1999–2004).\nStony Brook began in Division I as a member of the Eastern College Athletic Conference. In 2002, the Seawolves joined the America East Conference. In 2003, Stony Brook advanced to its first America East Tournament title game, needing to beat Northeastern twice to win the championship. While they won 11–10 in game one, they were blown out 11–0, leaving them one game away from its first NCAA tournament berth. In 2004, the fourth-place Seawolves upset first-place Northeastern 15–6 in the first round of the America East Tournament, and advanced to the championship game for a second straight year, this time defeating Maine 3–1 to win their first America East championship and advance to their first NCAA tournament in the program's Division I history. Stony Brook was assigned as the fourth seed in the Kinston Regional, where they lost to host East Carolina 8–2 and Tennessee 1–0 and were eliminated from the tournament in two games. \nProgram on the rise (2005–11).\nAfter reaching their first NCAA tournament in 2004, Stony Brook followed up with its first losing season since 1997, not qualifying for the America East Tournament. Stony Brook suffered another losing season in 2006 and a quick elimination from the America East Tournament in 2007. On December 6, 2006, Joe Nathan's No. 22 was retired, becoming the first retired number in Stony Brook athletics history. In 2008, Stony Brook finished 34–26 (14–10 America East) in second place in the regular season behind the Binghamton Bearcats. In the double-elimination tournament, the Seawolves beat UMBC and Binghamton twice to clinch their second tournament championship and advance to their second NCAA tournament Regionals. In the Tempe Regional of the NCAA tournament, Stony Brook lost 9–7 to Arizona State and 9–4 to Vanderbilt, resulting in another early exit from the tournament.\nThe 2009 season was less promising and the Seawolves ended the regular season in third place with a 29–23 (14–10) record. Stony Brook was ousted early in the America East tournament after consecutive losses against second-seeded Albany and fourth-seeded Vermont. In 2010, Stony Brook ended 30–27 (15–9), entering the tournament as the third seed but surprising with victories against Maine and consecutive victories against Albany to earn its third tournament championship. In the NCAA tournament, the Seawolves played in the Myrtle Beach Regional. They lost to Coastal Carolina 6–0, but defeated NC State 6–2 in the loser's bracket to earn their first victory in the tournament. The Seawolves were then eliminated in a rematch with Coastal Carolina, losing 25–7.\nIn 2011, Nathan's donation allowed for the construction of a new venue, Joe Nathan Field, which was unsuitable for play entering the season. As a result, the Seawolves played their home games at Baseball Heaven in Yaphank, New York. Joe Nathan Field opened on May 20, 2011. Stony Brook won its first conference regular season title in 2011 after going 22–2 in America East play; the Seawolves ended with a program-record 42 wins and went 42–12. However, Stony Brook was upset twice in the America East Tournament, once by Albany and again by Maine to eliminate the Seawolves before reaching the title game, putting their record-breaking season to a stunning halt.\nCollege World Series run (2012).\nStony Brook opened its 2012 campaign with a perfect 4–0 weekend at Thibodaux, Louisiana, with a pair of victories over Alabama State and Nicholls State in the Colonel Round Robin. The Seawolves' only losses in conference play came against East Carolina in a sweep, Kansas, Minnesota, Yale and Holy Cross. When conference play started, Stony Brook was 17–8.\nStony Brook went 21–3 in conference play, losing two games to Binghamton and one to Albany. The Seawolves continued to earn non-conference wins against Iona, Marist, Rhode Island, Central Connecticut and Fairfield in the middle of the conference season, entering the America East tournament with a 43–11 record. Stony Brook beat Maine 14–6, Binghamton 7–4 and Maine 13–6 to win the conference title, advancing to the 2012 NCAA Division I baseball tournament with a 46–11 record, the best record in Division I. \nThe Seawolves were the first team in the America East since 2002 to earn both the regular season and conference tournament championships in the same season. For the first time in the history of the program, Stony Brook found itself ranked, sitting at No. 25 in the Baseball America poll and No. 29 in the NCBWA poll.\nStony Brook traveled to South Florida to play in the Coral Gables Regional as the fourth seed. In the first game the Seawolves knocked off top-seeded Miami and went on to the winner's bracket. Following a loss to second-seeded Central Florida, Stony Brook beat Missouri State in dramatic fashion, striking out Luke Voit in the bottom of the ninth with the bases loaded in a 10–7 win. The Seawolves topped Central Florida 12–5 and 10–6 in consecutive days to win the regional and advance to face the LSU Tigers in the Super Regionals.\nIn a rain-soaked Baton Rouge Super Regional, Stony Brook fell in the first game to LSU, who started pitcher Aaron Nola, in an extra-innings affair that spanned two days due to rain. In game two, LSU started pitcher Kevin Gausman, who had closed out the game one victory hours before, with Stony Brook winning 3–1 behind a 127-pitch complete game. In a winner-take-all game three, Stony Brook won 7–2 and advanced to the 2012 College World Series in Omaha, Nebraska. The Seawolves were the second team to be the fourth seed in its regional and advance to the College World Series. Stony Brook was the first Northeast school to reach Omaha since 1986 and the first school from New York to do so since St. John's in 1980.\nIn the College World Series, Stony Brook's Cinderella run came to an end, losing to UCLA 9–1 and Florida State 12–2. Stony Brook ended the season with a 52–15 record, the most wins in college baseball, a No. 8 national ranking in the NCBWA poll and seven players selected in the 2012 MLB Draft, including outfielder Travis Jankowski being selected in the first round by the San Diego Padres.\nFinal America East years (2013–2022).\nStony Brook followed up its College World Series campaign with a disappointing 25–34 season, finishing fourth in the America East and being eliminated in the first two games of the tournament. In 2014, Stony Brook won its third America East regular season title with a 35–18 (18–5) record. The Seawolves advanced to the championship round of the conference tournament in the winner's bracket but lost to Binghamton in both games, 4–3 and 8–7, and were eliminated.\nStony Brook won back-to-back regular season championships in 2015, reaching the finals from the winner's bracket again, and this time beat UMBC 16–11 to reach its fifth NCAA tournament. Playing in the Fort Worth Regional, the Seawolves lost to North Carolina State 3–0, beat Sacred Heart 11–6 and were eliminated with an 8–3 loss to TCU.\nIn 2016, Stony Brook finished in third place in the America East, advancing to the tournament championship from the loser's bracket before falling to Binghamton. In 2017, Stony Brook finished in third again but lost two quick games in the playoffs. Stony Brook finished in fourth place in 2018, again reaching the championship game from the loser's bracket and losing to Hartford.\nThe Seawolves won their fifth regular season title and sixth America East Tournament title in 2019, beating Binghamton in the championship. In the NCAA tournament, Stony Brook was placed in the Baton Rouge Regional, scheduled to face LSU in a rematch of the 2012 series that sent the Seawolves to Omaha. LSU won the rematch 17–3. The Seawolves were eliminated from the NCAA tournament with a following 13–5 loss to Arizona State, which rostered future number-one MLB draft pick Spencer Torkelson.\nThe 2020 season was canceled on March 12 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Stony Brook played 15 games to a 6–9 record. Stony Brook won its sixth regular season title in 2021, setting the America East all-time record for most conference wins in a season (25). Hosting the conference tournament at Joe Nathan Field, Stony Brook advanced to the championship but did so from the loser's bracket. Up 1–0 against NJIT, the game was halted due to rain and never resumed. The America East controversially awarded the title and NCAA tournament bid to NJIT since the Highlanders were in the winner's bracket. \nBefore the 2022 season began, the America East controversially prohibited Stony Brook from participating in the conference tournament because of the school's impending move to the Colonial Athletic Association (now the Coastal Athletic Association).\nAlumni in Major League Baseball.\nThe following Stony Brook Seawolves baseball alumni have reached Major League Baseball:\nFacilities.\nJoe Nathan Field.\nJoe Nathan Field, located in the north end of the Stony Brook campus, is the home field of Seawolves baseball. Known as Seawolves Field until 2002 and University Field from 2002 to 2011, the field was named after Stony Brook alumnus and six-time MLB All-Star relief pitcher Joe Nathan, who donated $500,000 for the construction of a new baseball field in 2008. As part of the renovations, a new FieldTurf was installed and dugouts were constructed. Additional donations allowed for a new scoreboard adjacent to the field.\nThe field's dimensions are 330 feet to left and right field, 365 feet to left and right center, and 390 feet to center field. Joe Nathan Field's capacity stands at 1,000 spectators. Stony Brook has hosted the 2011 and 2012 America East Baseball Tournaments at Joe Nathan Field."

        "title": "Maine Black Bears baseball",
        "text": "The Maine Black Bears baseball team is the varsity intercollegiate baseball program of the University of Maine, located in Orono, Maine. It is the university's oldest athletic program, having begun play in 1881. It has been a member of the NCAA Division I America East Conference since its founding (as the North Atlantic Conference) at the start of the 1990 season. Its home venue is Mahaney Diamond, located on the university's campus. Nick Derba is the head coach. He was named interim head coach prior to the 2017 season. The program has appeared in 16 NCAA tournaments and seven College World Series. In conference postseason play, it has won eight ECAC Tournaments and five America East tournaments. In conference regular season play, it has won five America East titles (three of those when the league was known as the North Atlantic Conference). 19 former Black Bears have appeared in Major League Baseball.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe University of Maine opened in fall 1868 as the Maine College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts. The baseball program, founded in 1881, was the school's first intercollegiate athletic program. It went 3–3 in its first season. The program continued to play a handful of games each season during the 1880s; during this time, Irv Ray, Maine's first alumnus to play in Major League Baseball, played for the program. It played its first 10-game schedule in 1886 and won 10 games for the first time in 1888. The university did not sponsor a baseball team in 1892, but the team resumed in 1893.\nFrom the program's inception through the 1893 season, student coaches coached the team. For the 1894 season, the school hired Harry Miller as its first faculty head coach. In two seasons under Miller (1894 and 1895), the team went 5–7 and 8–4, respectively. Jack Abbott, the program's second head coach, led the team to a 5–4 record in 1896. Under W. W. Bustard, Maine had consecutive 9–4 seasons in 1897 and 1898. The university changed its name from the Maine College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts to its current name following the 1897 season.\nThrough the end of the 1923 season, Maine competed as an independent school. During this time, its highest single-season win total was 11, a mark reached three times (twice under head coach William Magill). Eight future major leaguers played for the program: Clarence Blethen, Harvey Cushman, Michael Driscoll, Pat French, Otis Lawry, Marty McHale, Ralph Pond, and Harland Rowe. In 1902, the team played an exhibition game against the New York Giants at the Polo Grounds.\nThe longest-tenured head coach of the period was former Philadelphia Athletics player Monte Cross, who coached the team for six seasons (1916–1921) and had an overall record of 33–33–3. An April 1916 \"Lewiston Daily Sun\" article said of Cross, \"His easy-going, but nevertheless strict instructions and discipline, together with the knowledge of the inside features of the National game, and the manner in which he teaches them, make an everlasting impression on the students, players, and managers.\" In 1919, Cross became the first Maine baseball coach to receive the \"M\" award from the university's president.\nAfter Joseph Murphy coached the program from 1924 to 1925, a total of two coaches led the team until 1949. Murphy assistant Fred Brice was the program's head coach for 10 seasons (1926–1935), and William Kenyon held the position for 13 seasons (1936–1943, 1945–1949). Under Brice, Maine had a 67–60 record; its best single-season record during his tenure was 9–5 in 1932. For the previous season, 1931, the baseball team had moved to a location behind Memorial Gym after previously playing at Alumni Field. In the mid-1930s, 1936 Olympian Clarence Keegan played for Brice. Under Kenyon, Maine went 61–91–1. It went 11–7 in 1938 to tie the program record for wins and won Maine State Series championships in 1937 and 1942.\nFrom 1937 to 1943, Maine played in the New England Conference, along with Connecticut, Rhode Island State, New Hampshire, and Northeastern. Maine won the conference championship in 1938, but in the conference's seven seasons of baseball competition, it had the worst overall record among the five teams.\nYankee Conference.\nFrom 1949 to 1979, Maine played in the Yankee Conference. For the majority of its time in the conference, its fellow members were Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont. In 31 seasons in the league, Maine had the third-highest winning percentage (.548), behind Connecticut and Massachusetts.\nMaine won its first Yankee championship in 1950 under head coach Mike Lude but did not win another in that decade. It began to have more success after Jack Butterfield was named head coach for the start of the 1957 season. Butterfield had played at Maine in the early 1950s and served as an assistant in 1956. In his fourth season, 1960, Maine shared the Yankee title with Connecticut after both went 8–2 in conference. Baseball executive Bill Livesey featured on the 1960 championship team.\nIn 1964, the Black Bears went 21–8, won the Yankee Conference, and reached their first College World Series (CWS). Maine swept Northeastern in the best-of-three District 1 Regional to reach Omaha. Maine began the tournament 1–1, beating Seton Hall in the opener but losing to Minnesota in the 1–0 game. In the losers bracket, Maine defeated Arizona State (also playing in its first CWS) and defending champion USC. In the semi-finals, Maine was eliminated by a 2–1 loss to Missouri. Pitcher Joe Ferris was named the Most Outstanding Player.\nButterfield led the team through the end of the 1974 season, when he left to coach South Florida, in part because of disagreements with Maine's administration about the program's funding. In his final decade, Maine shared two more Yankee titles and had another 20-win season, but it did not return to the NCAA tournament. Butterfield finished with an overall Maine record of 240–169–2.\nMaine hired Colby head coach John Winkin as Butterfield's replacement. Winkin went on to lead the team for 22 seasons (1975–1996) and was Maine's most successful head coach. He had an overall record of 642–430–3 and led Maine to 10 NCAA tournaments and 6 College World Series. His teams included nine future Major League Baseball players: Mike Bordick, Kevin Buckley, Fred Howard, Joe Johnson, Jeff Plympton, Bert Roberge, Mark Sweeney, Bill Swift, and Larry Thomas.\nAfter making an NCAA Regional in Winkin's first season, Maine reached the 1976 College World Series. There, it went 2–2. After losing its opener, 3–2, to Eastern Michigan, the team knocked out Auburn and Washington State before being eliminated. Maine returned to the CWS in 1981, when it had its first 30-win season. After defeating St. John's in the Northeast Regional finals, the Black Bears went 0–2 in Omaha.\nThe 1981 appearance was the first of four consecutive trips to Omaha, winning the Northeast Regional (which it often hosted) on several occasions. The Black Bears also reached the CWS in 1986, their first 40-win season. At the CWS, the team went 0–2 in 1983, 1984, and 1986, but finished tied for third in 1982. After losing its opener to Miami, it notched losers bracket wins against Cal State Fullerton, Wichita State, and Stanford before being knocked out by Miami. Bob Whalen, who went on to become the head coach at Dartmouth, was an assistant to Winkin during these four appearances.\nAmerica East Conference.\nMaine joined the North Atlantic Conference for the 1990 season. In its first four seasons in the conference, it reached three NCAA tournaments (1990, 1991, 1993), losing to Clemson in the regional final in 1991. Maine players won several major conference awards in the early 1990s, including a sweep of the Pitcher and Player of the Year (by Larry Thomas and Mark Sweeney) in 1991.\nWinkin's contract was not renewed after the 1996 season, and the school hired Providence head coach Paul Kostacopoulos to replace him. (The North Atlantic was also renamed the America East after the 1996 season.) Kostacopoulos led the team for nine seasons (1997–2005). Maine's best season under him came in 2002, when the Black Bears went 40–17 (16–6 America East), won the conference's regular season and tournament titles, and reached the Los Angeles Regional. The team also reached the 2005 NCAA tournament under Kostacopoulos, who was twice named the America East Coach of the Year.\nWhen Kostacopoulos left for Navy after the 2005 season, Maine hired Manhattan head coach Steve Trimper to replace him. Trimper had previously coached in the America East as an assistant at Vermont in the 1990s. Under him, Maine returned to the NCAA tournament in 2006 and 2011, playing in the Chapel Hill Regional both times and winning a game in 2011. In 2013, Trimper was named America East Coach of the Year, and the Black Bears won three of four major conference awards after winning the regular season title. In the America East Tournament, the team lost to Binghamton in the championship game.\nVenues.\nEarly venues.\nThe program played at several locations on Maine's campus in its early seasons. During the 1910s and 1920s, it played at Alumni Field. In 1931, it moved to \"a section directly behind Memorial gym.\"\nMahaney Diamond.\nThe program currently plays at Mahaney Diamond, which opened in the early 1980s and is located on the northern end of the university's campus. It has a capacity of 4,400 spectators and is named for Maine alumnus and donor Larry Mahaney, who graduated from the university in 1951. The field has a FieldTurf surface, and the facility has been renovated many times since the mid 1980s.\nThe facility hosted NCAA Regionals in 1982, 1983, 1984, 1986, and 1991. It has also hosted four AEC tournaments (1996, 2002, 2004 and 2018).\nCoaches.\nHead coaches.\nSince Harry Miller became the program's first record head coach for the 1894 season, Maine has had 24 head coaches. John Winkin, who was Maine's head coach from 1975 to 1996, is both the program's longest tenured and winningest head coach. He coached for 22 seasons and won 642 games."

        "title": "Hartford Hawks baseball",
        "text": "The Hartford Hawks baseball team is the varsity intercollegiate baseball program of the University of Hartford, located in West Hartford, Connecticut. The program is a member of the NCAA Division III Commonwealth Coast Conference. The program had been a member of the NCAA Division I America East Conference from 1985 to 2022. It has played home games at Fiondella Field since the venue opened at the start of the 2006 season.\nHistory.\nThe Hartford Art School, Hartt College of Music, and Hillyer College merged to create the University of Hartford in February 1957. It began operation for the 1957–1958 school year. Although some Hartford athletic programs, such as men's basketball, trace their history to the teams of Hillyer College, records for the baseball program begin with the 1958 season.\nDivision II.\n1958 was the program's first season of competition. It competed as a member of the NCAA College Division, made up of small-school athletic programs. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the program competed as an Independent and played a schedule of between ten and twenty games each season.\nThe program's first head coach, Frank Klein, served in the position for three seasons (1958–1960). The program had a losing record in each season, and Klein's overall record was 14–29. He later became the first commissioner of the Connecticut Collegiate Summer Baseball League.\nIn 1961, Roger Wickman became the program's second head coach. In his first season, the program had its first winning record, going 7–5 in 1961. In 20 seasons as head coach, Wickman had six total winning seasons and finished with a career record of 146-178-5. Following the 1980 season, he stepped down from the head coaching position to become an administrator in Hartford's athletic department.\nDuring Wickman's tenure (following the 1973 season), the NCAA had reorganized its divisions. The large-school University Division became Division I, while the small-school College Division split to become Divisions II and III. Hartford, which had competed as a College Division Independent, became a Division II Independent. It continued to compete as an Independent through Wickman's final season as head coach in 1980.\nIn the 1980–1981 academic year, Hartford became a charter member of the Northeast-7 Conference, along with American International College, Assumption College, Bentley College, Bryant College, Springfield College, and Stonehill College. The league became known as the Northeast-8 Conference when Saint Anselm College joined for the 1981–1982 academic year. In four seasons (1981–1984) as a member of the conference, Hartford had an overall record of 11–61, including winless seasons in 1983 and 1984.\nDivision I.\nFor the start of the 1984–1985 academic year, Hartford's athletic programs transitioned to Division I, joining the ECAC. For the 1985 season, the program's first in Division I, it hired former Major League Baseball player Bill Denehy as its head coach. That season, the team went 2–24. In 1986, Denehy's second season, the team's record improved slightly to 8–34. Denehy was fired during his third season for making inflammatory comments following a game against UConn in which two brawls broke out. Athletic director Don Cook, assisted by Wickman, coached the team for the remainder of the season.\nPrior to the start of the 1988 season, Hartford hired Quinnipiac head coach Dan Gooley as a permanent replacement for Denehy. In Gooley's first season, the Hawks went 29–12 and finished second in the ECAC Tournament. In 1989, the team went 17–15–1 to give the program consecutive winning seasons for the first time since 1971–1972. In 1992, the team went 27–21 and finished second in the North Atlantic Conference (which sponsored its first season of baseball in 1990), again appearing in the ECAC Tournament.\nIn the late 1980s, future Major League Baseball player Jeff Bagwell played three seasons for the program. Recruited by Denehy, Bagwell played under him in 1987, then under Gooley from 1988 to 1989. In 400 at bats with the program, Bagwell's batting average was .413, a program record. Bagwell was drafted by the Boston Red Sox in the fourth round of the 1989 MLB Draft. He had a 15-year major league career with the Houston Astros in which he won a National League MVP Award and appeared in four All-Star Games.\nFollowing the 1992 season, Gooley left Hartford to become a baseball corporate executive, and the program promoted assistant coach and former Major League player Moe Morhardt to replace him. Morhardt held the position for two seasons (1993–1994), in which the program won at least 20 games per season and made consecutive NAC tournament appearances. The team was eliminated in the opening round in the 1993 tournament. As the fifth seed in 1994, Hartford defeated fourth-seeded Maine in a best-of-three opening round. It then won its first two games in the double-elimination final round (5–1 against first-seeded Delaware and 6–5 against second-seeded Northeastern). The team then lost consecutive games to Northeastern in the championship round, however, and finished as the tournament runner-up. Morhardt resigned as head coach following the season.\nUNC Asheville head coach Jim Bretz was hired to replace Morhardt, and Bretz held the position for three seasons (1995–1997). Under him, the program averaged only 16 wins per season and finished no higher than sixth in conference play. It qualified for the 1996 NAC tournament, in which it finished third. Bretz resigned following the 1997 season \"for personal reasons,\" according to the university. Bob Nenna, one of Bretz's assistant coaches and a Hartford player from 1989 to 1992, led the team to a 13–32 record as interim head coach in 1998. Future Major League player Earl Snyder played under Bretz and Nenna from 1995 to 1998. Snyder set program career records for home runs (53) and runs batted in (173). Snyder later played for both the Cleveland Indians and Boston Red Sox.\nFrom 1999 to 2011, the program had a pair of head coaches whose career winning percentages were below .300. Hartford hired Bowdoin and Falmouth Commodores head coach Harvey Shapiro for the start of the 1999 season. In six seasons (1999–2004), Shapiro's head coaching record was 76-199-1. Under him, the team finished no higher than sixth in conference play and did not qualify for an America East Tournament, which in 1998 had adopted a four-team format. Shapiro resigned following the 2004 season. Indiana assistant Jeff Calcaterra replaced Shapiro. Calcaterra held the position from the start of the 2005 season until partway through the 2011 season, when he was fired with an overall record of 79-236-1. At the start of the 2006 season, Calcaterra's second season, the program opened Fiondella Field, the program's first on-campus venue since the mid-1980s.\nTo replace Calcaterra, the program hired UConn assistant Justin Blood for the 2012 season. Commenting on Blood's hiring, Aaron Fitt of \"Baseball America\" called him \"one of the top up-and-coming coaches in the Northeast.\" In both 2012 and 2013, Blood's first two seasons as head coach, the Hawks finished in fifth place in the America East. In 2014, Hartford went 31–23, finishing second in the America East; pitcher Sean Newcomb was named the America East Pitcher of the Year. The team qualified for the conference tournament, where the team went 1–2. It was Hartford's first winning season since 1992 and first postseason appearance since 1996. Following the season, three Hawks were selected in the 2014 Major League Baseball Draft, including Newcomb, who was selected in the first round by the Los Angeles Angels. Newcomb was Hartford's highest draft pick ever, and the three draftees were the program's first since 2004. Following the season, Blood signed a five-year contract extension through the 2019 season.\nDivision III.\nOn May 6, 2021, the University of Hartford Board of Regents voted to drop its athletic department to Division III. The drop is set to take place no later than September 1, 2025.\nVenues.\nEarly venues.\nIn its early years as a Division II program, Hartford played home games on campus. It began to use off-campus venues in the mid-1980s. These venues included New Britain's Beehive Field, Bristol's Muzzy Field, East Hartford's Ray McKenna Field, and Simsbury's Memorial Field.\nFiondella Field.\nSince it opened at the start of the 2006 season, on-campus Fiondella Field has been the program's home. It has a seating capacity of 1,000 spectators and an artificial turf surface.\nDunkin' Donuts Park.\nOpened in 2017 Dunkin' Donuts Park has served as Hartford's second home stadium in downtown Hartford with a seating capacity of 6,056.\nYear-by-year records.\nBelow is a table of the program's yearly records as both a Division II and Division I program."

        "title": "Rhode Island Rams baseball",
        "text": "The Rhode Island Rams baseball team is the varsity intercollegiate baseball team of the University of Rhode Island, located in Kingston, Rhode Island, United States. The program has been a member of the NCAA Division I Atlantic 10 Conference since the start of the 1981 season. Since the 1966 season, the program has played at Bill Beck Field, located on the university's campus. The program has appeared in two NCAA tournaments. It has won two conference tournaments, three regular season conference titles, and three regular season division titles. Three former Rams have appeared in Major League Baseball.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nThe university first held classes in 1892, as the Rhode Island College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts. Its varsity baseball program began playing in 1898, going 6–2 in its first season. The program played two more seasons before going on hiatus from 1901–1906. It returned in 1907. In 1909, the school was renamed Rhode Island State College. After taking one season off in 1918, due to World War I, the program resumed play for the 1919 season.\nPrior to the start of the 1921 season, Frank Keaney was named the program's head coach. In the preceding fall, Keaney had also been named the college's head football and men's basketball coach.\nOn March 8, 1923, the Ram was adopted as the official mascot and nickname of the college's athletic programs.\nNew England Conference.\nPrior to the start of the 1924 season, the New England Conference formed. In addition to Rhode Island State, the conference's members were Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire, and Northeastern. It sponsored baseball from its inception.\nThe program played 22 seasons in the conference (1924–1943, 1946–1947), all under Keaney. During this period, in which the program had a 194–92–1 overall record, the program's highest win total came in 1937 (16–4), and its highest winning percentage came in 1933 (.923).\nYankee Conference.\nPrior to the start of the 1948 season, the Rams joined the Yankee Conference. The conference formed has a result of Northeastern's departure from the New England Conference. It consisted of the four remaining NEC members, along with Massachusetts State and Vermont.\nFrank Keaney retired as head baseball coach following the 1948 season. In 26 seasons as head coach, Keaney had a record of 222–113–1. He also stepped down as the school's men's basketball coach at this time, in order to become Rhode Island State's athletic director. Shortly thereafter, in 1951, the name of the school was changed from Rhode Island State College to the University of Rhode Island.\nThe program struggled during its time in the Yankee Conference. After going 14–3 in 1949, its first season under Vic Palladino, the program had an above-.500 record in only six of 31 seasons. Two of these seasons, 1955 and 1956, came under head coach Bill Beck, who would step down following the 1959 season. In 1966, the program's home venue was dedicated to Beck.\nFollowing the 1975 season, the Yankee Conference stopped sponsoring sports other than football. Rhode Island competed as a Division I Independent from 1976 to 1980.\nAtlantic 10 Conference.\nPrior to the 1981 season, the program joined the recently formed Eastern 8 Conference, playing in the East Division along with Rutgers and Massachusetts. Following the 1982 season, with several changes to the conference's membership, the conference became known by its current name, the Atlantic 10 Conference (A-10). Rhode Island made the transition under head coach John Norris, who had held the position since prior to the 1970 season. In 1984, Norris led the program to its first postseason appearance, a berth in the Atlantic 10 tournament. The Rams qualified for the tournament by finishing tied for 2nd in the East Division. In the four-team, double-elimination tournament, Rhode Island won its opening two games, 15–3 over West Virginia and 7–6 over Penn State. The team then could have won the tournament and advanced to the NCAA tournament with a win over Temple, which had already lost one game. However, Temple defeated the Rams in consecutive games, 6–3 and 6–4. For the remainder of Norris' tenure, which lasted through the 1987 season, and the entirety of Dave Morris' tenure (1988–1992), the Rams finished no higher than third in the East Division and did not qualify for the postseason.\nFollowing the 1992 season, the university hired program alumnus Frank Leoni as head coach at a time when it considered cutting the baseball program. The program survived, although for a time, its scholarship funding was cut entirely to comply with Title IX. At the time, Leoni was the youngest coach in Division I baseball. His early seasons as head coach were poor. In 1994, his second season, the team had its worst season in the Atlantic 10 era, going 2–39–1 with a 1–22 A-10 record amid reduced funding and talk of cutting the program. In the late-1990s, after the school decided to keep the program the team improved. In 1998 and 1999, the team finished tied for 3rd in the East Division. In 2001, it finished with an above-.500 record for the first time since 1984, going 27–23.\nIn 2003, the program finished tied for 1st in the East Division and returned the postseason for the first time since 1984. In the A-10 tournament, the Rams went 1–2. In 2004, the program won the East Division outright and returned to the A-10 tournament. After losing its opening game to St. Bonaventure, the team defeated George Washington and Richmond to advance to the championship game against St. Bonaventure. There, it lost 3–2.\nIn 2005, the Rams won the East Division and the A-10 tournament in order to advance to the program's first NCAA tournament. In the conference tournament, the Rams went 3–0, defeating Dayton, Richmond, and George Washington to receive the A-10's automatic bid to the 2005 NCAA tournament. As the fourth seed in the Long Beach Regional, the team lost its opening game to Long Beach State, 11–2. It then lost an elimination game to Pepperdine, 2–1.\nFollowing the 2005 season, Leoni left Rhode Island to become the head coach at William &amp; Mary. He was replaced by Jim Foster, a former Providence player and minor-league catcher who had been an assistant at Brown from 2002 to 2004 and at Rhode Island in 2005. In Foster's first season, 2006, the Rams won the A-10 Regular season Title. In the A-10 Tournament, the team was eliminated after consecutive one-run losses: 3–2 against Saint Louis and 6–5 in 17 innings against George Washington. In 2009, the team set a program-record with 37 wins and finished second in the A-10. After losing to Xavier in the deciding game of the A-10 Tournament, the team was considered for an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament, but did not receive one.\nDuring an October 2011 fall workout, Rhode Island player Joseph Ciancola collapsed on the playing field and died in a hospital shortly thereafter. During the following season, Ciancola was commemorated by both Rhode Island and his former high school team.\nIn the 2013 season, the team finished in a three-way tie for the regular season A-10 championship. Rhode Island, Saint Louis, and Charlotte each finished with 17–7 conference records. In the opening round of the A-10 tournament, the Rams defeated La Salle, 5–2, behind a complete game by Mike Bradstreet. It then lost consecutive games to Charlotte and George Washington, however, and was eliminated from the tournament.\nFollowing the 2014 season, Foster left to become the associate head coach at Boston College. In nine years as the Rams' head coach, Foster had an overall record of 268–228–2; he won two A-10 regular season championships and had seven 30-win seasons. Assistant coach Raphael Cerrato, formerly the head coach at Division II New Haven, was named interim head coach for the 2015 season.\nVenues.\nBill Beck Field.\nSince the start of the 1966 season, the Rams have played on campus at Bill Beck Field. The field has a capacity of 1,000 spectators and has been renovated twice since 2000. It is named for Bill Beck, former Rhode Island football and baseball coach. The site of the field has hosted Rhode Island baseball since its first season in 1898.\nBroadcasts.\nHome games for Rhode Island baseball and softball are carried by the University of Rhode Island's radio station, WRIU. Many baseball home games (and nearby away games) are broadcast on 90.3FM, with the remaining baseball and all home softball games streamed online on RIU2.\nHead coaches.\nFrank Keaney is the program's longest-tenured head coach, having coached for 26 seasons in two stints, 1921–1943, 1946–1948. Jim Foster, coach from 2006–2014, is the program's wins leader with 268.\nNotable former players.\nThe following is a list of notable former Rams.\nMajor League Baseball Draft.\nBetween 2012 and 2014, the program had one MLB Draft selection in each season. In 2012, P Chris Pickering was drafted in the 32nd round by the San Francisco Giants; in 2013, outfielder Jeff Roy was taken by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 18th round; and in 2014, pitcher Ty Sterner was selected by the Cincinnati Reds in the 23rd round.\nA record four Rams were selected in 2009. 14th-round selection Nick Greenwood appeared in the major leagues with the St. Louis Cardinals in 2014."

        "title": "Major League Baseball relocations of 1950s–1960s",
        "text": "The Major League Baseball relocations of the 1950s–1960s brought several Major League Baseball franchises to the Western and Southern United States, expanding the league's geographical reach. This was in stark contrast to the early years of modern baseball, when the American League placed teams in National League cities. Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, and St. Louis had two teams; New York City had three. With no teams west of St. Louis or south of Washington, D.C., baseball was effectively confined to the Northeast and Midwest.\nThe moves, though controversial in some circles, brought new prosperity to the game of baseball. As of 2022, Chicago remains as the only market with two pre-expansion era teams, the Chicago Cubs and the Chicago White Sox, though the White Sox have several times come close to moving.\nBaseball's expansion mirrored the westward movement of the U.S. population during a flourishing postwar economy that saw the arrival of commercial jet travel. Economic push and pull factors caused many teams to move, and the emergence of cities in the new frontier allowed baseball teams to pop up across the country. The moves of the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants to California in 1958 opened the West Coast to the market of baseball.\nSince 1960, the National and American Leagues have added 14 teams.\nEarly history.\nDuring the early years of the American League as a major league, the league placed franchises in cities that were either in direct competition with National League teams (New York City, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, and St. Louis) or in markets abandoned by the National League after the 1899 contraction (Cleveland; Washington, D.C.; and briefly Baltimore). Only Detroit, home of the Detroit Tigers, was a true \"new\" baseball market for the American League, although the National League had previously hosted the Detroit Wolverines between 1881 and 1888.\nIn these early years, only two National League markets had no American League counterpart: Cincinnati and Pittsburgh. The American League agreed not to place a team in Pittsburgh, home to the then-dominant Pittsburgh Pirates, as part of the National Agreement in 1903. It is unknown why no second team was placed in Cincinnati to compete with the Cincinnati Reds.\nAfter the remains of the original American League Baltimore Orioles went to New York in 1903, where they ultimately became reborn as the New York Yankees, no major league team moved for 50 years. This also reflected the population at the time, as most of the major population areas were in the Northeast and Midwestern United States in the aftermath of Reconstruction and later the Great Migration. An abortive attempt to move the St. Louis Browns to Los Angeles in December 1941 was derailed by the entry of the U.S. into World War II. Until the 1950s, Baseball was tied to the history and culture of New York City, home to three of the best teams: the Yankees, Giants and Dodgers.\nBeginning of the moves.\nOver the years, though, it became apparent that one team would be more popular than the other in a given market. In cities with multiple teams, owners would be competing with each over the same fan base. The economics of the game began to change with the increase in live media coverage, especially television. The owners had a plan, and that was to have one team in each city, so that owners would not need to fight each other over customers. Boston would lose the Braves. Philadelphia would lose the A's. St. Louis would lose the Browns. New York would lose the Giants and the Dodgers.\nIn Boston, despite the Boston Braves having been established much longer in the city and arguably being the oldest continuing professional sports franchise in North America, the Boston Red Sox were by far the more popular team at the gate and with fans. In addition, the Red Sox were largely successful on the field (except in the immediate years after selling Babe Ruth to the Yankees) while the Braves were an also-ran and often in the second division of the National League. In stark contrast, the National League was able to hang on to St. Louis, where the St. Louis Cardinals were more successful than the St. Louis Browns.\nOne oddity would be Philadelphia, where the American League's Philadelphia Athletics were by far the more popular team in the city, led by longtime manager Connie Mack, as the Philadelphia Phillies were mostly losing during this period. However, with the Phillies enjoying rare success in 1950 at the hands of the Whiz Kids, the tables instantly turned on the Athletics. Additionally, a \"spite fence\" built at Shibe Park in 1935 (to keep spectators outside of the ballpark from watching the game for free), had the unintended result of the Athletics alienating their fan base in Philadelphia. Still, the Phillies would not win a World Series until 1980, the last of the \"original 16\" teams to win a series and 25 years after the A's left town, during which they would win three more World Series championships before the Phillies broke through.\nIn New York City, the Yankees had long passed the New York Giants in popularity, though the Giants remained popular and the Brooklyn Dodgers were gaining popularity as well.\nChicago would see the Cubs as roughly equal in popularity to the White Sox despite their constant losing seasons and the Curse of the Billy Goat allegedly preventing the Cubs from making the Fall Classic from 1945 to 2016. This can likely be attributed to the after effects of the Black Sox Scandal of 1919 still apparent on the White Sox, who on several occasions nearly moved out of the Windy City. However the White Sox have not threatened, nor been considered a candidate for moving, since the opening of new Comiskey Park (now Guaranteed Rate Field) in 1991, with their 2005 World Series victory further cementing their future in Chicago.\nThe moves.\nThe first moves were initially lateral moves. As they were tied down to slow railroad timetables, the first teams that moved stayed within Major League Baseball historical geographical core: the Northeast and upper Midwest, and to markets which did not have Major League Baseball.\nThe first move was the Boston Braves, who moved (for 1953) to Milwaukee, home of their top farm team, the Milwaukee Brewers. The City of Milwaukee fell in love with the Braves, with fan support of the team high, making the move highly profitable. The Milwaukee Braves would remain popular until the team moved to Atlanta in 1966.\nOther owners took notice and began to issue similar threats. The St. Louis Browns moved to Baltimore for 1954, becoming the Baltimore Orioles (this was the era's sole west-to-east move). The Philadelphia Athletics moved to Kansas City for 1955, briefly displacing the Cardinals as the westernmost town in the majors. Save for some controversy with the Athletics, these moves were not controversial, as these were three of the least successful teams in the majors, although the Browns and Braves had both won league championships in the 1940s.\nThe exit of the National League from New York City.\nBaseball experts consider Walter O'Malley to be \"perhaps the most influential owner of baseball's early expansion era\". Following the 1957 Major League Baseball season, he moved the Dodgers to Los Angeles. For years O'Malley had tried to secure a site for a new stadium for the Dodgers in Brooklyn to no avail. The Dodgers' home at the time, Ebbets Field, was old and obsolete. Despite the Dodgers dominating the league, attendance at Ebbets Field dwindled, likely because of its age and the difficulty of accessing the stadium by car. Another explanation for the decline in attendance is the migration to the suburbs. People living in the suburbs did not want to attend games at night in the inner city. Frustrated, he began to look elsewhere.\nWith the post–World War II population shifts south and west and the rise in transcontinental airplane service, many West Coast cities were actively pursuing Major League Baseball to move there; among them Los Angeles and San Francisco. Rosalind Wyman, the then-head of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, was one of those championing a major league team in Los Angeles. Beginning in 1955, with the city's blessing, she began to solicit several major league teams, including the Dodgers, with the idea that they move to Los Angeles. Wyman and city officials attended the 1956 World Series between the Dodgers and the Yankees, at Ebbets Field, initially to meet with Washington Senators owner Calvin Griffith who was attending the game, to convince Griffith to move his ailing Senators to Los Angeles. O'Malley, upon hearing of the planned meeting, immediately summoned Wyman for a meeting and earnestly began negotiations with her expressing his intent to have a new modern stadium built for the team, a request Wyman and city officials assured O'Malley would be no problem. Initially O'Malley planned to use his negotiations with Los Angeles as a ploy in his dealings with New York's all-powerful public building and development czar Robert Moses, who was preventing O'Malley from obtaining the site he was looking for in Brooklyn for his new stadium. However, as negotiations with Moses deteriorated — Moses wanted the Dodgers to move to a new stadium site in Flushing Meadows–Corona Park in Queens, which eventually became Shea Stadium— O'Malley realized that a deal with Los Angeles began to seem more of a reality. In addition, in Los Angeles, the Dodgers would be given land at Chavez Ravine free of charge to build a stadium, which would eventually become Dodger Stadium.\nAt the same time New York Giants owner Horace Stoneham was considering a move for the Giants. The Giants' aging home, the Polo Grounds, was becoming dilapidated by the mid-fifties, leading to a drop off in attendance for the team. Stoneham, like O'Malley, was also unable to secure a new stadium site for the team and initially was looking to move the Giants to Minneapolis, home to the Giants' top farm team, the Minneapolis Millers. O'Malley invited San Francisco Mayor George Christopher to New York to meet with Stoneham and convinced him to join O'Malley on the West Coast at the end of the 1957 season, thus bringing the two teams' New York rivalry out to California. O'Malley needed another team to go west with him, for had he moved out west alone, the St. Louis Cardinals— away— would have been the closest National League team. The joint move would make West Coast road trips economical for visiting teams. Since the meetings occurred during the 1957 season and against the wishes of Commissioner of Baseball Ford Frick, there was media gamesmanship. When O'Malley moved the Dodgers from Brooklyn, the story transcended the world of sport and he found himself on the cover of \"Time\" magazine. The cover art for the issue was created by sports cartoonist Willard Mullin, long noted for his caricature of the \"Brooklyn Bum\" that personified the team.\nThe dual moves broke the hearts of New York's National League fans, but ultimately were successful for both franchises and for Major League Baseball. The move was an immediate success as well, because the Dodgers set a major-league, single-game attendance record in their first home appearance, with 78,672 fans at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, which would be their temporary home for several years until their new stadium was ready.\nThe moves received considerable controversy: the loss of the Dodgers was especially painful because the team was one of the last vestiges of Brooklyn's status as a city in its own right prior to 1898. Professional baseball would not return to Brooklyn until 2001, in the form of the minor-league Brooklyn Cyclones team playing at Coney Island, but Brooklyn would not receive another major league sports franchise until the National Basketball Association's New Jersey Nets moved to the borough in 2012. Though New York still had the Yankees in the American League, the loss of a National League team in the nation's largest market drew the ire of National League fans.\nNew York City mayor Robert F. Wagner asked attorney William A. Shea to head up a committee to acquire a new National League team for New York. After pitching to Philadelphia, Cincinnati, and Pittsburgh, Shea realized he was asking a team to do what he couldn't - that was move a team from a market that supported it. Almost immediately the goal was switched from moving franchises to expanding the league. Using contacts in government, he was able to force MLB (by lobbying for the end of MLB's Anti-Trust exemption) to add two American League teams and two National League teams. The New York Mets were eventually added as an expansion team, beginning play in 1962. Ironically, the Yankees' attendance declined slightly in the years immediately following the Dodgers' and Giants' departure, and the Mets consistently drew more fans than the Yankees through the early- to mid- 1970s. The Mets today are often considered \"New York City's team\" while the Yankees have a wider fanbase, similar to that of football's Dallas Cowboys.\nSubsequent moves.\nThe Braves and Athletics did not stay in their locations for very long. The Braves, despite success in Milwaukee, moved to Atlanta for 1966 while the Athletics set up shop in Oakland for 1968. Both markets would eventually get replacement teams in the Milwaukee Brewers and Kansas City Royals, respectively. The Braves would not have consistent success in Atlanta until the 1990s, while the A's were successful during several periods thereafter.\nAside from the Seattle Pilots moving to Milwaukee after one year (to become the Brewers), the other moves since have involved Washington, D. C. The original Washington Senators moved to the Twin Cities region to become the Minnesota Twins (beginning play as such in 1961), and the expansion Senators that replaced them moved to Arlington, Texas (in the Dallas-Fort Worth region) to become the Texas Rangers (beginning play as such in 1972). The owners of the Giants, White Sox, and Pirates (in the latter's case, as a result of the Pittsburgh drug trials) all threatened to move, though none made good on them; and all three markets to which these teams threatened to move (Toronto, the Tampa Bay Area, and Denver, respectively) would later receive expansion teams of their own.\nThere were no more moves until 2005, when MLB moved the Montreal Expos to the American capital and renamed them the Washington Nationals.\nMontreal is the only city which has lost a major league franchise since 1901 without eventually getting another team. This is not counting the short-lived Federal League of 1914 and 1915; however, all Federal League markets save two—Buffalo and Indianapolis—either had a franchise in one of the two established leagues at the time or got one later. As of 2022, MLB officials have expressed an interest in the return of baseball to Montreal, and the city is a leading candidate for a proposed expansion to 32 teams.\nEconomic factors.\nMost moves during this time did not involve a change in ownership. This means that the main economic incentive for the MLB to expand was not large offers from prospective buyers in western cities. The expansion occurred because franchise owners expected higher profits in the other location.\nInternal factors.\nProtection against rival leagues.\nExpansion of MLB to all cities capable of supporting a franchise in the sport is economically beneficial for the league as a whole. This reduces the possibility of the formation of a rival league, a problem that baseball dealt with in its early history. Monopoly control of the sport is essential to many aspects of player contracts, drafts and other parts of the game. Baseball's anti-trust exemption was important in the development and expansion of the league.\nMedia.\nIn MLB, all local TV revenue is assigned to the home team. The league has complex revenue sharing rules, but data shows that media revenue was an economic pull factor for the franchise moves. The yearly gains in media revenue associated with the moves are: Boston to Milwaukee (−$175,000), St. Louis to Baltimore (+$257,000), Philadelphia to Kansas City (−$90,000), Washington to Minnesota (+$400,000), Milwaukee to Atlanta (+$800,000), Kansas City to Oakland (+$800,000), Seattle to Milwaukee (−$150,000), Washington to Texas (no change). Data is unavailable for the moves of the Dodgers and the Giants. Based on this data, TV revenues influenced the franchise move of Washington, Milwaukee, and Kansas City and perhaps St. Louis. TV revenues have played an important role in roughly half of the moves that have taken place. James Quirk argues that under a TV sharing arrangement similar to the National Football League, or even under a split with visiting teams, the TV lure would be much less of an incentive for moves.\nExternal factors.\nThe protection of the league from competition and economic benefits of media revenues are direct economic pull factors. Other advancements in the U.S. during this time also had an effect on the ability and desire of teams to move and the league to expand. The expansion of MLB coincided with an increase in the ease of travel by commercial jets, making it easier for players to fly across the continent. This is important given that when Walter O'Malley moved his Dodgers to Los Angeles, the closest team, other than the San Francisco Giants, was in St. Louis.\nThe expansion of baseball is also accompanied by the increase in popularity of television. Baseball expanded, in large part, because interest in the sport grew leading up to and during the 1950s and 1960s. In home televisions allowed for this increase in popularity and helped make New York's pastime, America's pastime.\nSummary.\nFrom 1903 to 1952, no major league baseball team moved to a different city. From 1953 to 1969, there were eight moves."

        "title": "New Zealand Army rugby team of 1919",
        "text": "The New Zealand Army rugby team of 1919 was a rugby union team which represented New Zealand after the end of the First World War. Although spoken of as a single team, there were several New Zealand Services teams playing in Britain at the conclusion of the War. The most notable being the touring Army XV who played a series of games throughout Great Britain and France, including an internationally recognised match against the Wales national team. With the introduction of the King's Cup; a services tournament between forces from Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa, the team split intself in two. The 'A' Team taking part in the King's Cup, while the 'B' team continued touring against club and county opponents.\nNew Zealand Services.\nThe First World War saw a high percentage of amateur rugby union players signing up to serve their country. At the same time the sport of rugby union was suspended at club and country level in most countries. The sport survived during this period through organised games conducted by inter-service and allied forces.\nWhen the War came to an end, most international and club teams were decimated; more than a hundred internationals had died in the conflict (See:List of international rugby union players killed in action during the First World War), many more were seriously injured and other players were now too old or out of condition. Therefore, club teams took the possibility to play an organised New Zealand team as a way to challenge their own teams as they sought to rebuild.\nLlanelli's first official game after the War was against the New Zealand Army team from the Larkhill Garrison in Wiltshire. This was followed by games against the New Zealand Machine Gun Corps on 22 February 1919. These and similar teams came together to make the New Zealand Army team. This team split into an 'A' and 'B' team when during a tour of Great Britain, an inter-services tournament, with a cup presented by King George V, was held between the allied forces. The stronger New Zealand Army 'A' team took the challenge of the King's Cup and eventually triumphed over the British Army at Twickenham. The 'B' team continued the tour of Great Britain and France.\nThe tour of Great Britain and France.\nThe tour of Great Britain and France took in 38 matches, of which the New Zealand Army won 33, drew two and lost just three games. With the tour over the Army team headed to South Africa for a further twelve matches.\nTouring party.\nThose players marked with AB were also capped as New Zealand 'All Black' rugby union internationals, either before or after playing in the New Zealand Army team.\nResults.\n1 The matches that made up the King's Cup competition.\nNew Zealand Army in Wales.\nDuring the First World War, the ban on players who had switched to play professional rugby league from playing rugby union was lifted. This allowed players from both codes to play in services teams without threat of action. With the war over, the Welsh Rugby Union immediately sought to re-establish the amateur rules, and were suspicious that several of the New Zealand team had played professional rugby before the war and now wanted a guarantee that all the New Zealanders were amateurs. This view led one irate British Service officer to comment, \"As if it matters a damn whether they are amateurs or professionals when they have come to this country to fight and die for us.\" The WRU, realising that they had misjudged public sentiment towards the Services teams, quickly dropped their complaint and did not raise the issue again.\nThe King's Cup.\nThe King's Cup was contested by six teams. The New Zealand Army, the British Army (known during the competition as the Mother Country), Australian Imperial Forces, Canadian Expeditionary Forces, South African Forces and the RAF.\nThe competition, sometimes referred to as the 'Inter-Services and Dominions Rugby Championship', consisted of a small league, whereby each of the teams played each other over a period of weeks. Once the teams had played each encounter, the two sides with the most wins would face each other for the right to play for the King's Cup at Twickenham. The winner of the final was then invited to play the French Army team, again at Twickenham. The matches were played in varying locations around Britain.\nThe New Zealand Army 'A' team's first encounter was with the RAF played at Swansea in Wales; New Zealand won 22–3. This was followed by another victory, this time against the Canadian Force at Portsmouth in England. After beating the South African Forces team at Twickenham, New Zealand travelled to Edinburgh in Scotland to play the 'Mother Country', the British Army team. This was the closest encounter to date, with New Zealand winning 6–3. With four wins from four encounters, New Zealand had already secured their place in the final, but then lost the final match of the round against Australia at Bradford. This was the first loss of the tour for the New Zealand Army, for either the A or B team.\nThe final in London was between New Zealand and the 'Mother Country' team. James Ryan led his team to a 9–3 victory, earning the right to Face the French Army three days later. After the win over France, Ryan was award the King's Cup, presented by King George V. With the King's Cup Championship over, the 'A' team returned to Wales to rejoin the rest of the squad ready to face the Wales team at Swansea."

Prior to 3 September 1898, Dewsbury was a rugby union club, and prior to the 1896–97 Northern Rugby Football Union season, Heckmondwike was also a rugby union club.\nBackground.\nDicky Lockwood was born in Crigglestone, Wakefield, West Riding of Yorkshire, England, and he died aged 47 in Leeds, West Riding of Yorkshire, England.\nBiography.\nDicky Lockwood was born on 11 November 1867 in Crigglestone. Dicky Lockwood's marriage was registered during first ¼ 1889 in Dewsbury district. Dicky Lockwood was the landlord of The Queen Hotel, Westgate, Heckmondwike.\nRugby union.\nLockwood made his international début on Saturday 8 January 1887 in Llanelli against Wales in the 1887 Home Nations Championship. The match was to have been held at Stradey Park, which would have been that ground's first international rugby union match. The game was arranged for 8 January and a temporary stand was erected to allow a seating area so the club could charge higher ticket prices; but on the day the English team refused to play on the ground as the pitch was frozen. The adjacent cricket ground was in better condition, so the match was moved there along with the entire crowd, many members of which were extremely unhappy as they lost their seating area. Of the 14 matches he played for his national side he was on the winning side on 8 occasions.\nHe played his last match for England on Saturday 3 February 1894 at Rectory Field, Blackheath in the England vs Ireland match.\nRugby league.\nWhen Heckmondwike converted from the rugby union code to the rugby league code for the 1896–97 Northern Rugby Football Union season, Dicky Lockwood had already transferred from Heckmondwike to Wakefield Trinity the previous season, consequently, he only ever played rugby union for Heckmondwike, he played rugby league for Wakefield Trinity at centre from October 1895 finishing in the 1900–01 season, having scored 31-tries, and 60-goals, scoring 222-points for Wakefield Trinity."

        "text": "James Eugene Duffy (January 10, 1867 – September 16, 1953) was an American football player and lawyer. He played halfback for the University of Michigan football team for seven years from 1885 to 1891 and was captain of the 1888 team. In 1886, he set the world record by drop kicking a football 168 feet, 7½ inches. After graduating from Michigan, he was an attorney in Bay City, Michigan and a long-time member of the University of Michigan Board in Control of Athletics.\nBiography.\nUniversity of Michigan.\nA native of Ann Arbor, Michigan (born January 10, 1867), Duffy enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1885. While attending the school as both an undergraduate and law student, he played halfback for the Michigan football team for seven years from 1885 to 1891. He was the team captain in 1888, and his brother John L. Duffy was captain of the 1887 team. Near the end of Duffy's career at Michigan, the \"Chicago Daily Tribune\" wrote: \"Duffy is an old U. of M. player. Although a swift runner and clever dodger his great strength lies in kicking ability, punting and drop-kicking.\"\nAs a rusher, Duffy had great speed. At Michigan's May 1888 field day, Duffy won both sprint events, with times of 10.4 seconds in the 100-yard dash and 22.4 seconds in the 220-yard dash. Prior to the 1888 football game between Michigan and Notre Dame, the players competed in a 100-yard foot race, which Duffy won. Duffy also ran for two touchdowns in the 1888 Notre Dame game which Michigan won by a score of 26–6.\nAs a kicker, Duffy set or tied distance records for his era. On May 22, 1886, at a field day in Ann Arbor, Duffy drop kicked a football 168 feet, 7½ inches. \"Outing\" magazine reported that Duffy's kick broke \"the best record of the world by 11 feet and 5 inches.\" A few days before his record-breaking kick at the May 1886 field day, Duffy had kicked the ball 194 feet in a practice session. On the day of the event, he reportedly broke the record five times. In 1888, the \"Detroit Free Press\" wrote:\nIncluded in the team is J.E. Duffy, who holds the world's record for the drop kick, he having propelled the ball 168 feet seven and one half inches, at Ann Arbor May 22, 1886. It may be explained that a drop kick is made by letting the ball fall from the hands and kicking it at the very instant it rises. Duffy is a tall, well formed muscular player who gets over the ground like a wraith and fights for every point.\nOn November 22, 1891, Duffy also kicked a field goal from the 55-yard line against Cornell—a kick that either tied or fell one yard short of the American football record for the longest field goal to that time.\nMichigan was undefeated in Duffy's first three seasons with the team, outscoring opponents 222 to 0 in the 1885, 1886 and 1887 seasons. With Duffy as captain in 1888, the team won its first four games, including two wins over Notre Dame, by a combined score of 126 to 20.\nFor the final game of the 1888 season, Michigan traveled to Chicago to play a game to raise money for charity against the Chicago University Club, a group described as a \"picked team\" made up of \"eastern college experts.\" One of Michigan's stars, Horace Greely Prettyman, was ejected from the game for slugging. Though Michigan lost the game 26–4, newspaper accounts credited Duffy's play. In one instance, Chicago halfback Crawford (described as \"a famous Yale man\") came out of a heap of players, \"dodging between the legs of the big fellows and knocking down the little fellows till Duffy got a full Nelson lock on him and hurled him neck over heels.\" Duffy accounted for Michigan's only points against Chicago, running for a touchdown in the second half \"by good running and dodging.\"\nIn Duffy's first six years as a varsity football player at Michigan, the team compiled an overall record of 17 wins and 4 losses. In his seventh season, Duffy reportedly served as a player and coach for the 1891 team. While official sources list only Mike Murphy and Frank Crawford as the coaches of the 1891 team, the \"Chicago Daily Tribune\" reported in November 1891 that the Michigan team was \"coached systematically\" by Murphy, Crawford, Horace Greely Prettyman and Duffy. The 1891 team finished with a 4–5 record, losing more games that year than in the prior six years combined.\nDuffy received his undergraduate degree from the University of Michigan in 1890 and a law degree in 1892. While at Michigan, Duffy was a member of the Chi Psi (ΧΨ) fraternity.\nLegal career.\nAfter receiving his degrees, he entered the practice of law in Bay City, Michigan. He was the city attorney in Bay City from 1897 to 1899 and thereafter returned to private practice. Duffy was also a member of the University of Michigan's Board in Control of Athletics from its inception through at least 1921. In February 1917, he was the only member of the Board who voted against a resolution favoring Michigan's rejoining the Western Conference. He was also president of the Michigan State Bar in 1930.\nDuffy purchased the Port Huron &amp; Detroit Railroad in 1922 and served as its chairman. He died in 1953.\nHonorary degree.\nIn 1921, the University of Michigan presented Duffy with an honorary degree of Master of Arts. When the honorary degree was presented, Professor John G. Winter praised Duffy as follows:\nMr. James Eugene Duffy, of Bay City, a graduate of Michigan, College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, class of 1890, and of the Law School in the class of 1892. Vividly remembered by his fellow collegians of the older day as an athlete of high renown; a member of the Board in Control of Athletics since its inception, he has been helpful and constant in his devotion to the best interests of his Alma Mater. Honored alike by his associates of the bar and the citizens of his commonwealth, he deserves recognition by the University."

During the American colonial period, exclusive clubs in the Philippines such as the Manila Golf Club, Baguio Golf Club, and the Manila Polo Club tend to be reserved only to Americans. Shaw was also ostracized due to his marriage to a Filipino. The discrimination towards Montes and himself, led to Shaw to establish the Wack Wack Golf and Country Club.\nAccording to legend, \"wack wack\" was the sound made by crows who roamed areas of golf courses. The logo of Wack Wack features two black birds.\nIn 1939, the golf course was taken out of Mandaluyong to become part of the newly-established Quezon City. However, in 1941, it was returned to Mandaluyong."

It was later renamed to HSG PH Potsdam.\nIn 1990, with the imminent dissolution of East Germany, it became the HSG BLH Potsdam, to adopt its current name, USV Potsdam, in July 1991, reflecting its close ties with the University of Potsdam.\nRugby department.\nThe club's rugby department was formed in 1988. However, rugby in Potsdam dates back to the 1950s. In 1963, a rugby department was formed at the \"Pädagogischen Hochschule Potsdam\", which later joined local club Dynamo Potsdam. In 1988, students at the \"Pädagogischen Hochschule\" once more formed a rugby club, the RG 88 Potsdam. Once more, this team joined the local police sports club, the former \"Dynamo\" now being renamed PSV Potsdam.\nIn 1993, this team won promotion to the 2nd Rugby-Bundesliga North for the first time. In 1997, the rugby department then joined the university club \"USV\", its current home.\nThe team earned promotion to the 2nd Rugby-Bundesliga North/East in 2005, the second tier of German club rugby, by winning its regional division of the Rugby-Regionalliga and succeeding in the promotion round against Welfen Braunschweig und Hamburger RC.\nFinishing the first three seasons in this league in the lower half of the table, \"USV\" progressed to a third place in 2008-09. In the 2009-10 season, the club leads the league and has a good chance of earning promotion to the Rugby-Bundesliga. The club however is trying to attract sponsorship to be able to afford competing at national level.\nA league reform in 2012 allowed the club promotion to the Bundesliga as the league was expanded from ten to 24 teams. USV finished third in their group in the 2012-13 season and qualified for the north/east division of the championship round, where it came sixth. The club opted to not play their first round play-off match, citing player shortage, and was thereby knocked out of the championship with the game awarded 50-0 to the opposition.\nThe club qualified for the DRV-Pokal in 2013–14 and was knocked out by RC Leipzig in the quarter-finals of the play-offs. At the end of the season the club opted to withdraw from the Bundesliga to the tier three Regionalliga. After a season there in 2013–14 USV earned promotion back to the 2nd Bundesliga for the following year after a Regionalliga championship.\nRecent seasons.\nRecent seasons of the club:"

This was the first Rose Bowl to features two teams that were both located west of the Mississippi River, as the bowl game typically pitted the best teams from the eastern and western United States.\nBackground.\nStanford had been to six previous Rose Bowls in a span of 34 years (they went to four more in the next 36 years), but they had only compiled a 1–4–1 record. This was the third consecutive Rose Bowl appearance for Stanford's class of 1936 players, nicknamed the \"Vow Boys\".\nSMU had a record of 12–0 and was top-ranked with a defense that had shut out their opponents in eight of 12 games. This was their second-ever bowl game (the Mustangs had played in the 1925 Dixie Classic) but their first marquee bowl appearance.\nGame summary.\nNot wanting to lose for the third consecutive time in the Rose Bowl, Stanford strove to score first, which they did with Bill Paulman's touchdown run in the first quarter. The rest of the game was a defensive struggle (which is why two ends were named MVP), highlighted by Stanford's six interceptions and SMU's crucial fumble at Stanford's five-yard line. In the end, there was 355 combined yards, but also 25 combined punts and only 15 first downs.\nGame notes.\nThe game was the first sellout for the Rose Bowl Game with all 84,784 seats filled with a large portion of fans from Texas to watch their Mustangs play. According to the Pasadena Tournament of Roses, there was a request for additional 200,000 tickets."

        "text": "The 2010–11 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team represented the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the 2010–11 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The head coach was Roy Williams. The team played its home games in the Dean Smith Center in Chapel Hill, North Carolina and is a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference. They finished the season 29–8, 14–2 in ACC play to win the conference regular season championship. They advanced to the championship game of the 2011 ACC men's basketball tournament before falling to Duke. They received an at-large bid in the 2011 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament where they advanced to the Elite Eight before falling to Kentucky.\nThis season represented the 101st season of basketball in the school's history.\nPreseason.\nThe team lost seniors Deon Thompson and Marcus Ginyard to graduation, while sophomore Ed Davis made himself available for the 2010 NBA draft. The team was dealt an unexpected loss as twin freshmen David and Travis Wear announced that they would transfer from UNC on May 6, 2010, ultimately landing at UCLA. Additionally, it was announced in October 2010 that red-shirt senior Will Graves was removed from the team for violating team rules.\nRecruiting.\nCoach Roy Williams signed a three-man class for 2010.\nSeason.\nUNC took part in the 2010 Puerto Rico Tip-Off and the ACC – Big Ten Challenge. The following schools will compete in 2010 Puerto Rico Tip-Off: Davidson, Hofstra, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Carolina, Vanderbilt, West Virginia and Western Kentucky\nUNC had already scheduled non-conference games against Kentucky, Texas (in Greensboro), Charleston, Long Beach State, at Illinois, at UNC-Asheville, at Evansville, and at Rutgers (Madison Square Garden).\nNon-conference season.\nUNC beat Lipscomb 84–66 in their first game of the season. In their second game, which was their first game in the Puerto Rico tip-off, they beat Hofstra 108–63. In their third game, they lost to the University of Minnesota 72–67. In their fourth game, they lost to Vanderbilt 72–65. The two losses caused UNC to fall in the rankings to #25. The 2–2 start was their worst since the 2001–02 season. After closer-than-expected wins against UNC Asheville and College of Charleston, UNC dropped out of the rankings.\nIn their ACC-Big Ten Challenge game, the Tar Heels were throttled on the road against Illinois. However, they followed up that loss with a win over then 11th-ranked Kentucky. They had a chance to return to the rankings with a win over Texas in what was essentially a home game at the Greensboro Coliseum, but lost on a last-second shot by the Longhorns' Cory Joseph.\nConference season.\nThe Tar Heels opened ACC play with close wins over the league's two Virginia teams. However, they came out flat against Georgia Tech, losing by 20 points. They wouldn't lose again for almost a month, with the only close game in that stretch being against Miami. That game was decided on a last-second three-pointer by Harrison Barnes. The month-long winning streak catapulted them back into the rankings for the first time since December.\nOn February 4, the Tar Heels were broadsided when point guard Larry Drew II abruptly left the team. The Tar Heels beat Florida State in their first game without Drew, but in a subsequent game against Duke, after leading all of the first half, they faltered in the second half and lost 79–73. They would not lose again for over a month, despite close games against Clemson and Florida State.\nThis set up a regular-season finale against Duke with the winner clinching the ACC regular-season title and the top seed in the 2011 ACC tournament—the fifth winner-take-all game in the series' 92-season history. The Tar Heels won with relative ease, 81–67, to win their 28th ACC regular-season title and fifth outright title in seven years. It also completed the Tar Heels' fourth undefeated season in the Smith Center.\nThe Tar Heels did not have an easy time of it in the ACC Tournament in Greensboro, despite being the top seed. In their first-round game against Miami, they trailed for the entire game before going on a 27–6 run in the final 10 minutes, capped by a Tyler Zeller tip-in with 0.2 seconds left to win the game 61–59. It was the biggest postseason comeback in school history. Against Clemson, they trailed by 11 points before rallying to force overtime, then won 92–87.\nThis set up their third matchup of the season against Duke; the Tar Heels would lose to the Blue Devils 75–58.\nNCAA tournament.\nDespite the loss, the Tar Heels returned to the NCAA tournament after a one-year absence as the No. 2 seed in the East Regional. They played their first two games at Time Warner Cable Arena in Charlotte. They played there alongside bitter rival Duke, who is the top seed in the West Regional.\nThe Tar Heels had a tough first game against Long Island before pulling away late for a 102–87 win. They then beat Washington on the strength of a combined 45 points from Zeller and Barnes. They advanced to the Sweet 16 at the Prudential Center in Newark.\nThe Tar Heels first faced the 11-seeded Marquette Golden Eagles in the Sweet 16 in Newark. Marquette had an off night and the Heels dominated their opponent with a score of 81–63. UNC next played the Kentucky Wildcats team, fresh off a win against the overall number one seed – the Ohio State Buckeyes. UNC was down early and remained down by 8 at halftime. Despite the barrage of 3-points from the Wildcats, UNC launched a comeback to tie the game late. But freshman Brandon Knight hit a clutch 3-pointer, and Kentucky beat UNC 76–69 to advance to the Final Four in Houston.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=9 style=| Exhibition\n!colspan=9 style=| Regular Season\n!colspan=9 style=| ACC tournament\n!colspan=9 style=| NCAA tournament\nBlue Steel.\nIn the 2010–2011 season, the term \"Blue Steel\" was coined to describe the North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team walk-ons. Blue Steel is composed of six players who, despite being non-scholarship athletes, have a position on the team and play a key role in its development. They are led by Basketball Hall of Fame coach Roy Williams, who is third all time in the NCAA for winning percentage.\nHistory.\nCoinage of name.\nThe term \"Blue Steel\" was created by walk-on member Stewart Cooper, a 2010–2011 Junior from Forsyth Country Day School, and has quickly gained prominence. Although the players to which it refers were once known by nicknames such as \"the JV guys,\" and \"the blue team\", the new term of \"Blue Steel\" is one that is now widely known and used by members of the student body, faculty, and Tar Heel fans. Beyond the local fanbase, sports reporters around the country have begun to use it as well.\nThe Blue Steel movement first caught on in the 2010–2011 season. At the end of North Carolina’s 84–64 win over N.C. State at the Dean Smith Center on January 29, fans chanted their new group name. The chant was at its optimum in Saturday’s pre-game introductions and when the walk-ons went to cut down the nets after three of them started against Duke on Senior Night.\nPlayers on the name \"Blue Steel\".\nBOLICK: Williams called us a combination of \"J.V.\" or \"Parentheses.\" On the actual practice plans, all the walk-ons' names were on the practice sheets in parentheses next to the player they'd substitute in for. So he'd say, \"Parentheses, get in there.\" We said, \"We can't go with being called the parentheses.\"\nCOOPER: We didn't want to tell Williams to start calling us [Blue Steel]. We told one of the assistant coaches.\nBOLICK: The assistant coaches started calling us Blue Steel at the beginning of the week. By the end of the week, Coach Williams had caught on as well.\nCOOPER: It was pretty funny the first time he said it. He said he liked it. He's never really gone back.\nJOHNSTON: It definitely started off in practice, not as sort of a schtick-type thing, which is what it turned into. When he first said it in a game, we looked at each other like, \"Nice.\"\nSignificance.\nTwitter.\nBlue Steel has approximately 10,000 Twitter fans. They are known for \"tweeting from the bench\" during basketball games. Their first tweet was on December 15, 2010 and was \"What's up world? 2010–11 UNC basketball walk-ons fresh on the twitter scene. stay tuned FRIENDS.\" Some other examples of Blue Steel tweets are:\n• \"You're welcome Tar Heel fans. If we didn't get dunked on every day in practice, you wouldn't be able to see it in the game. #feelthesteel\"\n• \"bucket, drawn charge, airball and one of the biggest blocks ever in the nc state game...the world saw all aspects of Steel's game. #respect\"\n• \"We're gonna have a far better view than the \"crazies\" and we didn't waste all of January sleeping in a tent. #feelthesteel\"\nVideos.\nBlue Steel players filmed in action along with comments from members and team players. Submitted with permission from creator.\nPlaytime in big games.\nIn the rival matchup between North Carolina and Duke University in 2011, Roy Williams started the senior members of Blue Steel.\nIn North Carolina's game against Clemson in the ACC tournament in Greensboro, North Carolina, Roy Williams took out all of his scholarship players and put Blue Steel in the game.\nBlue Steel had the opportunity to play in the 2011 NCAA tournament in the opening game against Long Island University and in the Sweet 16 game versus Marquette University.\nHand signal.\nBlue Steel have their own hand gesture, called the \"dip snap\". This gesture is used as a sign of respect when Blue Steel players are entering the game. The steps for completing it are reportedly as follows:\nReporters.\nBen Doster--\"Blue Steel: New Look to an Old Tradition\"\nDave Wilson--\"North Carolina's 'Blue Steel' adds to sports pranks\"\nDave Wilson--\"Blue Steel, North Carolina's Walk-ons, Earn Cult Hero Status\"\nConor Orr--\"North Carolina vs. Kentucky: Meet 'Blue Steel,' the Tar Heels' humorous, charitable bench\"\nAdam Lucas--\"Lucas: Prank You Very Much\"\nJerome Richard--\"'Blue Steel' steals the show at start for Tar Heels\"\nLennon Dodson--\"\"Blue Steel\" emerges as more than just bench warmers\"\nJason Jennings--\"UNC's Blue Steel builds a brand\"\nT-shirts.\nBlue Steel recently released their own T-shirts with the slogan \"Feel the Steel\". Proceeds from the shirts go to a Camp Kesem North Carolina, a week-long summer camp for youth whose parent or guardian have cancer.\nCharity date auction.\nOn February 14, 2011, UNC Chapel Hill held an auction for the charity Dance Marathon. Dates with members of the school's basketball team were auctioned off in order to support the organization, which aims to raise money for sick children. Specifically, members of Blue Steel were auctioned off for $375."

        "text": "The history of women's ice hockey in the United States can be traced back to the early 20th century. In the 1920s, the Seattle Vamps competed in various hockey tournaments. In 1916, the United States hosted an international hockey tournament in Cleveland, Ohio, that featured Canadian and American women's hockey teams.\nAWCHA.\nIn 1997–98, the American Women's College Hockey Alliance debuted. It was a program funded through the USOC/NCAA Conference Grant Program. The AWCHA organized and developed activities with collegiate women's varsity ice hockey teams, and helped to promote women's ice hockey at all NCAA levels. The first AWCHA Division I National Ice Hockey Championship was held in March 1998. The New Hampshire Wildcats defeated the Brown Bears by a 4–1 score, to become the first recognized national champion in women's college ice hockey. In the 1999–2000 season, the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA) joined the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) as the second league in the nation to offer women's Division I competition.\nThere were two more AWCHA National Championships and then the NCAA became involved. In August 2000, the NCAA announced it would hold its first Division I Women's Ice Hockey National Championship. The Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs captured the first NCAA Division I Women's Ice Hockey Championship, defeating the St. Lawrence Skating Saints by a 4–2 tally on March 25, 2001.\nIvy League women’s hockey.\nIn 1964, the Brown Bears men's coach Jim Fullerton arranged for Nancy Schieffelin to attend a team practice. She was an experienced player and came to the practice disguised in full uniform. A year later, Brown University had the first women's ice hockey program. The team was known as the Pembroke Pandas. The Pandas had to borrow equipment, and sell hockey rule sheets at the Bears men's games to raise money for equipment. In February 1966, the Pandas (Brown Bears) women's ice hockey team played their first game. Against the Walpole Brooms, the club lost by a 4–1 score.\nThe Cornell women's hockey program was started in 1971, but did not play its first game until 1972. It was a 4–3 victory over Scarborough. In 1972, they played eight games and lost four. The Big Red lost twice to the Brown Bears.\nYale University debuted its women's ice hockey program on December 9, 1975. Its first match was versus Choate-Rosemary Hall. The Bulldogs prevailed by a 5–3 tally. Two years later, the Bulldogs hockey program attained varsity status. In 1976, Brown hosted the first ever Ivy League women's ice hockey tournament. The other competing schools were Cornell, Princeton and Yale. The Big Red won the tournament.\nDartmouth College welcomed women's ice hockey on January 7, 1978. The Big Green defeated Middlebury by a 6–5 score. The Big Green finished their inaugural season with 7 wins, 7 losses, and 1 tie. Against Ivy League teams, the Big Green were 1–3–1. In the 1978–79 season, the Harvard Crimson iced a women's team. Their first game was a 17–0 defeat at the hands of the Providence Friars. The next game was a 2–1 loss to the Yale Bulldogs.\nThe Harvard Crimson \"iced\" their first-ever regular season women's hockey team in the 1978–79 season. Their first game was a 17–0 defeat at the hands of the Providence Friars. In 1998–99, the Crimson finished with a record of 33–1. Of the 31 wins, the Crimson won 30 consecutive games to close the season. In the previous season, the Crimson had gone 14–16–0. The final game of that 30 game streak was a 6–5 overtime victory over the New Hampshire Wildcats in the AWCHA national championship game.\nOn November 24, 1979, the Princeton Tigers played their first varsity game against the University of Pennsylvania. In winter of 1982, Princeton snapped the Cornell Big Red women's ice hockey program's string of six straight Ivy League titles.\nIn 1998, the Patty Kazmaier Award was introduced, named after former Princeton Tigers player Patty Kazmaier.\nIn 1998–99, the Harvard Crimson finished with a record of 33–1. Led by head coach Katey Stone, the Crimson proceeded to win the American Women's College Hockey Alliance national championship.\nIvy League players accomplishments.\nIn 1987, Mollie Marcoux-Samaan joined the Princeton Tigers. In her four years with the Tigers, Marcoux-Samaan would gain eight letters in athletics (hockey and soccer). In 1990, Dartmouth Big Green player Judy Parish Oberting was named to the first U.S. National Team that competed at the 1990 IIHF Women's World Championship. In 1998, Laurie Belliveau of Yale and Sarah Hood of Dartmouth were two Ivy League players named first team All-Americans. This was the first time that Ivy League women's hockey players were bestowed with such an honor.\nDuring the 2003–04 season, Nicole Corriero of Harvard set an NCAA record with 59 goals scored in a season. In the same season, former Princeton player Laura Halldorson coached the Minnesota Golden Gophers women's ice hockey program to the 2004 NCAA title.\nOn January 18, 2003, Harvard beat the Boston College Eagles women's ice hockey program by a 17–2 mark, the largest margin of victory in NCAA history. Jennifer Botterill set an NCAA record (since tied) for most points in one game with 10 on January 28, 2003, versus Boston College. A few months later, Nicole Corriero tied Botterill's record for most points in one NCAA game with ten on November 7, 2003, versus the Union Dutchwomen. In addition, she holds the NCAA record for most game winning goals in a career, with 27.\nProfessional hockey.\nNWHL.\nThe National Women's Hockey League was formed in 2015 with four teams. Formed by Dani Rylan in March 2015 with an estimated $2.5 million operating budget, it was the first women's professional hockey league to pay its players. Prior to the league's formation, the only choice for top level women's hockey in North America was the Canadian Women's Hockey League (CWHL), which at the time paid bonuses and incentives but not salaries. The league's inaugural season ran on a salary cap of US $270,000 maximum per team and a $10,000 minimum per player. The players also earned 15% of profits from any NWHL jersey sold with their name on it. The league placed its four original teams in large hockey markets: the New York City area, Boston, Buffalo, and New England. In 2018 the league expanded to five teams, absorbing the Minnesota Whitecaps. In April 2020, a Toronto NWHL franchise was officially announced as the league's sixth team and first original expansion team, becoming the first expansion team to join the league since the collapse of the CWHL in 2019. Teams competed for the Isobel Cup, named after Lady Isobel Gathorne-Hardy, the daughter of Frederick Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby, donor of the Stanley Cup.\nPWHPA.\nThe Professional Women's Hockey Players Association (PWHPA) was founded in May 2019 following the dissolution of the CWHL and player's dissatisfaction in the operations of the NWHL. Although the NWHL was the first women's ice hockey league to pay its players (the CWHL only paid players stipends), it was still not considered a livable wage. The goal of the PWHPA was to create a sustainable professional league for women's ice hockey in North America that provided financial and infrastructure resources to players, health insurance, and support to training programs for young female players. With a large number of North American players boycotting the NWHL in support of the PWHPA, more than half of the signed players on opening rosters for the 2019–20 NWHL season were new to the league.\nDue to their boycott, the members of the PWHPA decided to compete against one another on a tour to various North American cities, creating a series of exhibitions called the Dream Gap Tour, named after the gap between professional men's and women's hockey opportunities. Eventually, the COVID-19 pandemic caused public events to be cancelled, effectively ending the season. They continued the tour the following season, resulting in the 2020–21 PWHPA season.\nIn 2019 and 2020, select NWHL and PWHPA players were invited to participate in the 2019 NHL All-Star Skills Competition and the 2020 NHL All-Star Weekend. They participated in skill competitions and had a USA vs Canada women's three-on-three game in 2020. NWHL star Kendall Coyne Schofield competed in the fastest skater event in 2019 alongside big names in the NHL such as Connor McDavid, Mat Barzal, and Nathan MacKinnon. She finished 7th out of 8 skaters, only a second behind the top skater Connor McDavid. Also in 2019, Brianna Decker completed a demonstration for the \"premier passer\" event included in the All-Star games. Although she was not part of the competition, fans complained that she deserved the $25,000 prize because she had finished three seconds ahead of the first-place winner. 2019 was the first time women's ice hockey players had competed in the events, but no one received any prizes. Instead, they were given appearance fees and a donation of $1 million towards girls hockey. Their appearances in the games raised awareness for women in a male dominated sport and garnered recognition of the NWHL and PWHPA.\nPHF.\nIn September 2021, the NWHL officially rebranded as the Premier Hockey Federation (PHF) alongside several structural changes including prioritizing private ownership of teams. Team salary caps were also doubled prior to the season, going from $150,000 per team to $300,000. The 2021–22 season, the league's first season under the PHF title, began in November 2021. PHF players were required to follow testing and quarantine protocols due the outbreak of the COVID-19 Omicron variant.\nOn January 18, 2022, the league announced that the 2022–23 salary cap would more than double to $750,000 per team, and players would receive full healthcare benefits and an equity stake in the teams. Additionally, the league confirmed plans to add an expansion team in Montreal, which resulted in the creation of a seventh team, the Montreal Force, in 2022. In December 2022, the salary cap for the 2023–24 PHF season was set at $1.5 million per team, double the 2022–23 cap of $750,000.&lt;ref name=\"TheAthletic_Salvian_23/24-salary-cap\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The increase aligned with the Board of Governors' pledge, made in 2021, to invest $25 million directly in pay and benefits to PHF players over the ensuing three seasons. This signified a 900 percent growth over the 2021 salary cap.&lt;ref name=\"PHF_23/24-salary-cap\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"ESPN_23/24-salary-cap\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nPWHL.\nOn June 30, 2023, the Premier Hockey Federation announced that the league had been sold to the Mark Walter Group. This buyout voided all PHF player contracts for the upcoming season and PHF players were not allowed to be parties to negotiations toward a collective bargaining agreement between the PWHPA and the new league before its ratification. PHF players were then required to renegotiate their contracts with the new league or participate in the new league's draft if they wanted to continue their professional hockey careers in North America. \nOn August 29, 2023, it was announced that the new league would be known as the PWHL and that the six charter franchises would be based in Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, Boston, New York, and Minneapolis-St. Paul. All six teams were allowed to sign three players during an initial 10-day free agency period. Following the free agency period, the 2023 PWHL Draft was held in Toronto on September 18. The 15-round draft saw 90 players selected from a pool of 286 eligible players. Since the new league would have one fewer team than the PHF and five fewer than the PHF and PWHPA combined, many players from both organizations were not drafted or signed during the PWHL's free-agency period. The PWHL's inaugural game was held on January 1, 2024, between New York and Toronto.\nNotable teams.\nConnecticut Polar Bears.\nThe Connecticut Polar Bears are an ice hockey league for girls under the age of 19 in Connecticut. Numerous players from the Polar Bears have gone on to careers in college hockey at the NCAA Division I and Division III levels. In 1985, Maurice FitzMaurice's daughter Marnie wanted the opportunity to play ice hockey among girls. FitzMaurice and a few other fathers decided to organize a Pee Wee Girls program. The result was the Connecticut Polar Bears. It is the only all-girls ice hockey program in Connecticut, which consists of eleven teams.\nSince its beginnings, FitzMaurice has been the President of the Polar Bears. He was also one of the organizers of one of the largest Christmas tournaments in North America. In 2007, the tournament hosted about 275 teams. Games were played across Connecticut. The program has produced numerous Olympians, including Julie Chu, Jaime Hagerman, Hilary Knight, Sue Merz, A.J. Mleczko, Kim Insalaco, Angela Ruggiero, Sarah Vaillancourt and Gretchen Ulion.\nMinnesota Whitecaps.\nMinnesota first competed for the Clarkson Cup in 2009 in Kingston, Ontario. The team lost to the Montreal Stars in a one-game final, 3 goals to 1. In 2010, the Minnesota Whitecaps became the first United States based team to win the Clarkson Cup, doing so by defeating the Brampton Thunder, 4 goals to none. In 2019, after moving to the National Women's Hockey League, the Whitecaps became the only team to win both the Clarkson Cup and the Isobel Cup after beating the Buffalo Beauts by a score of 2 goals to one.\nSeattle Vamps.\nAs early as January 1916, Frank Patrick and Lester Patrick talked of the formation of a women's league to complement the Pacific Coast Hockey Association. The proposal included teams from Vancouver, Victoria, Portland and Seattle. The league never formed but in January 1917, the \"Vancouver News-Advertiser\" reported that wives of the Seattle Metropolitans had assembled a team.\nIn February 1921, Frank Patrick announced a women's international championship series that would be played in conjunction with the Pacific Coast Hockey Association. The three teams that competed were the Vancouver Amazons, Victoria Kewpies, and Seattle Vamps. On February 21, 1921, the Seattle Vamps competed against the Vancouver Amazons in Vancouver, and were vanquished by a 5–0 score. Two days later, the Vamps played against a team from the University of British Columbia and won the game. Jerry Reed scored three goals (a hat trick) in the game for the Vamps. In both games, the Vancouver media referred to the Seattle team as the Seattle Sweeties. The Amazons traveled to Seattle and defeated them again. On March 2, 1921, the Vamps were defeated by the Kewpies 1–0 in Seattle. In the rematch on March 12, the Vamps travelled to Victoria. The result was a 1–1 tie, and Jerry Reed scored the goal for Seattle. The goaltender for the Vamps was Mildren Terran. After the 1921 season, the Vamps and the Kewpies ceased operations.\nMinnesota.\nIn 1994, more than 500 member schools were sent letters by the Minnesota State high school league. The intent was to determine how many schools were interested in starting girls' ice hockey teams. Twenty-four expressed interest as the league was looking for a new sport for Title IX purposes. On March 21, 1994, the Minnesota State High School League sanctioned girls' ice hockey. Minnesota became the first state in the U.S. to sanction girls' ice hockey as a high school varsity sport. On March 25, 1995, Apple Valley High School defeated the South St. Paul Packers, 2–0, to become the first Minnesota girls' state high school champion.\nFrom 1994 to 2002, the number of varsity girls' teams in Minnesota expanded from 24 to 125 (in two classifications, AA and A). In 2001, a three-day girls' state tournament attracted 15,551 spectators. In 1994 there were 1,863 girls in the state participating in organized hockey outside of a varsity high school program. In 2002, the number increased to 6,856.\nAwards.\nSarah Devens Award.\nEstablished in 1996, the Sarah Devens Award is awarded jointly by the ECAC and Hockey East. The award is named in honor of former Dartmouth Big Green ice hockey player, Sarah Devens, who died in 1995 prior to her senior year. Kathryn Waldo, a forward from Northeastern University Huskies, was the first recipient. Waldo had cystic fibrosis, and despite health challenges, was a stand-out player for the Huskies during her four years. She finished her career with 106 points in 52 goals and 54 assists. \nJoe Burke award.\nThe Joe Burke Award was established in 1994. It is presented annually to the person who has given outstanding contribution, support, and dedication to women's ice hockey. Joe Burke was a Dedham resident but never actually played the game himself. The first game he attended was the University of New Hampshire and Boston College in 1978 at McHugh Forum. Since that game, Burke has been at every major girls'/women's hockey event in the New England area.\nLaura Hurd Award.\nThe Laura Hurd Award is given to the NCAA Division III Women's Ice Hockey Player of the Year. It is named for Elmira College star Laura Hurd, a four-time All-American who lead her team to the first Division III championship. \nInternational tournaments.\nThe following women's ice hockey tournaments (featuring teams from other nations) were contested in the United States."

        "text": "The 1946 Rose Bowl was the 32nd edition of the college football bowl game, played at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, on Tuesday, January 1.\nThe game matched the undefeated Crimson Tide of the University of Alabama of the Southeastern Conference (SEC) and the #7 Trojans of the University of Southern California of the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC). The Tide defeated the underdog Trojans 34–14. It was Alabama's sixth and final trip to the Rose Bowl until their College Football Playoff semifinal appearance in 2021 and Frank Thomas' final bowl trip as head coach.\nGame summary.\nAlabama, known as the \"wooden horse\" led at the half 20–0 and the Trojans had a net loss of 24 yards. USC, which had won eight straight Rose Bowl games since 1923, didn't make a first down until the third quarter when the score was 27–0.\nAlabama outgained USC 351 to 41 yards. Quarterback Harry Gilmer threw only eleven times in the game for one touchdown and ran for 116 yards on 16 carries. Hal Self scored twice, on a one-yard run and on a 24-yard Gilmer pass. Gilmer went over from the one, and Lowell Tew hit left guard from the two for points and Norwood Hodges scored up the middle on a one-yard plunge. Hugh Morrow kicked four extra points in the game.\nAftermath.\nFollowing this game, the PCC and Big Nine (now Pac-12 and Big Ten) entered into an exclusive five-year agreement for their champions to meet in the Rose Bowl. It has been extended numerous times, and outside of rotations in the playoffs, it continues. Both conferences openly admitted restricting the Rose Bowl, because they were tired of getting beaten by teams playing \"hillbilly ball,\" the same reason they cited for not inviting them before 1920.\nThis was the last Rose Bowl appearance by an SEC team for 72 years, when Georgia defeated Oklahoma in a national semifinal in early 2018. The first break in the Pac-12/Big Ten arrangement came in 2002, when it was the BCS Championship Game between Nebraska and Miami."

        "text": "The Binghamton Bearcats men's basketball team represents Binghamton University and is located in Vestal, New York. The team currently competes in the America East Conference and plays its home games at the Binghamton University Events Center. Since becoming an NCAA Division I basketball program in 2001, the team has played in one NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament in 2009.\nHistory.\nSince the school's founding in 1946 until 1998 the Bearcats, originally known as the Colonials, participated in the NCAA as a Division III basketball program. From 1998 to 2001 the school was able to elevate its status as a Division II program and since has competed in the America East Conference at the Division I level. Prior to this, no school had elevated divisions faster than Binghamton.\nDivision I.\nSince moving to Division I in 2001 the Binghamton basketball team has seen rewarding successes and great disappointments. The Bearcats also have had wins against both Rutgers University and Tulane.\nFollowing an unsuccessful 2007 season head coach Al Walker, the only coach Binghamton had held in their Division I history, stepped down. Kevin Broadus, an assistant coach for Georgetown University was signed to fill Walker's position for the 2008 season. In his second season as head coach, Broadus took the Bearcats to their first regular season conference title in school history. Binghamton subsequently defeated UMBC 61–51 in the America East tournament championship Game to make their debut in the 2009 NCAA Tournament as a 15th seed. Binghamton would lose to second-seeded Duke in the first round that year.\nFollowing the March Madness loss, a series of incidents began to make both local and regional headlines regarding academic and ethical violations by both players and coaches of the team. By the start of the 2009–10 campaign, six players had been kicked off the team from problems stemming back to the 2008–09 season, and head coach Kevin Broadus was suspended. Despite these handicaps, the 09–10 team led by interim head coach Mark Macon managed to finish fifth in conference play with a .500 record and recorded a 13–18 overall record. Towards the end of the basketball season the SUNY system produced an audit outlining the failures of the previous administration in running the basketball team. Due to these failures, Binghamton withdrew itself from the 2010 America East men's basketball tournament. Numerous coaches and Binghamton staffers were fired as a result of the scandal.\nSince then, Binghamton has been barely competitive. The 2011–12 Bearcats set a school record after beginning the season on a 26-game losing streak and finishing 2–29 for the worst winning percentage in program history. The team has yet to record a winning record in either conference or overall play.\nNCAA tournament results.\nBinghamton has been to the tournament one time. Their combined record is 0–1."

        "text": "Woolwich Cricket Club was an English cricket club based in the town of Woolwich, Kent. It was formed sometime in the first half of the 18th century, or earlier, and its earliest known record is in 1754 when its team played two matches against the prominent Dartford Cricket Club. The club, or at least a successor of it, then played a number of matches from 1797 to 1806 against Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), Montpelier Cricket Club, Croydon Cricket Club and other leading town clubs. After playing MCC in 1806, the club disappeared from the records. Throughout the period from 1754 to 1806, Woolwich's home ground was Barrack Field, part of Woolwich Common, which remains the home ground of the Royal Artillery Cricket Club (RACC). Mainstays of the club in its \"Napoleonic\" period were William Ayling, John Tanner and John Ward.\n1754.\nWoolwich came briefly to prominence in August 1754 when the team played home and away games against Dartford which at this time was probably the strongest team in England. In both matches, the away team won but no further details are known. Both games were mentioned in the same report by \"Read's Weekly Journal\" dated Sat 31 August: \"Dartford won away &amp; lost at home against Woolwich on Sat. &amp; Mon., Aug. 24 &amp; 26 respectively\".\n1797 to 1806.\nIn the years around the turn of the century, club cricket became fashionable in London and matches between the town clubs were popular. Woolwich reappeared in 1797 with two victories against Croydon, both at Barrack Field.\nIn 1798, the club played home and away against both Croydon and Montpelier. Following two substantial victories against Croydon, Woolwich lost to Montpelier at Aram's New Ground and then drew the return at Barrack Field.\nIn 1800, Woolwich played home and away matches against MCC and won both, including an innings victory at Lord's Old Ground. In what was a very successful season, the team also defeated Montpelier by 8 wickets at Barrack Field.\nWoolwich played three more games against MCC at Lord's Old Ground between 1802 and 1804, winning in 1802 and 1803 but losing by 7 wickets in 1806.\nBarrack Field.\nThe CricketArchive database records over 800 matches, mostly services fixtures, as having taken place at Barrack Field.\nRoyal Artillery Cricket Club (RACC).\nIt is possible that Woolwich CC was merged into the RACC or alternatively that it disbanded after the RACC took full possession of Barrack Field. According to its own website, RACC first played cricket in 1765, having been started as a private club by Royal Artillery officers. It was formally constituted as a regimental club as late as 1906. On 8 June 1818, RACC became the first services team to be granted a match against MCC at Lord's. A week later, RACC played MCC at Barrack Field in a match that was tied.\nOn 21–23 August 1862, RACC hosted the All-England Eleven (AEE) in an odds match. The venue is given as Woolwich Common, not Barrack Field. RACC had 22 players but still lost by 6 wickets to a team captained by George Parr and including great players John Jackson, H. H. Stephenson, Ned Willsher and Tom Hayward senior."

        "title": "VMI Keydets basketball",
        "text": "The VMI Keydets basketball team represents the Virginia Military Institute in Lexington, Virginia, in the sport of men's college basketball. They compete in the Southern Conference of the NCAA Division I. They have played their home games in Cameron Hall since 1981. VMI has played basketball since 1908, and had played in the Southern Conference (SoCon) until 2003, when they moved to the Big South. VMI rejoined the SoCon on July 1, 2014. They are coached by Andrew Wilson.\nNotably, VMI is one of only two Division I schools that do not sponsor women's basketball. The other is fellow Southern Conference member and senior military college: The Citadel.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nThe VMI basketball program began in 1908 under head coach Pete Krebs, and team went 3–3 in their inaugural season. VMI enjoyed mild success within the first several years of its existence, achieving twelve winning seasons in seventeen years as an independent between 1908 and 1925, including records of 11–1 and 16–1 1920 and 1921, respectively. Pinky Spruhan, who coached the Keydets from 1919 to 1922, had a 38–9 coaching record which still stands as the highest winning percentage of any VMI head basketball coach (.809).\nSouthern Conference.\nVMI joined the Southern Conference in 1925 at which time they were led by 4th-year head coach W. C. Raftery. After a 7–8 overall mark and 3–5 conference record in their opening season in the SoCon, VMI finished in 20th place or lower in the conference four of the next six seasons. Raftery departed in 1934 with a 68–112 record; the 68 wins are the 4th-most in VMI history.\nThroughout the next 30 years, VMI never placed better than 5th in the conference. This stretch included one winless season and two winless conference marks. From 1943 to 1953, VMI failed to win more than five games in any season. The Keydets saw 13 different head coaches, five of which were only tenured for one year.\nLouis Miller era.\nHired in 1958, Louis \"Weenie\" Miller became the first coach to lead VMI to an NCAA tournament appearance. After seasons of 5–13, 4–16 and 5–17, the Keydets managed to go 9–11 and 6–8 in SoCon play in the 1961–62 season. The nine wins were the most for the program since 1953–54, and they made their first Southern Conference tournament semifinal appearance since 1941.\nTwo seasons later, VMI went 12–12 and 7–7 in the conference which was their first non-losing season since 1942–43. Despite being the 4th seed, VMI narrowly ran their way through the SoCon tournament defeating Furman, Davidson, and George Washington in succession. The three wins came by a combined 10 points. In the NCAA tournament, VMI fell to Princeton 86–60. Miller left VMI following the season's end.\nBill Blair &amp; Charlie Schmaus era.\nVMI returned to mediocrity and losing seasons following their Southern Conference title. Gary McPherson replaced Miller from 1964 to 1969, followed by Mike Schuler, who was tenured until 1972. The Keydets more than nine games in a season in that stretch, including a 1–25 campaign in 1970–71, which is tied for the most losses in a single season in VMI basketball history.\nBill Blair, who also played for VMI, led the Keydets to their first of what would be two consecutive NCAA tournament appearances. In 1975–76, the Keydets went 22–10 which including a 9–3 Socon record; it was the school's first winning record in conference play since 1968, and only their second since 1943. After winning the SoCon tournament, VMI defeated Tennessee 81–75 and DePaul, 71–66 in overtime, before falling to Rutgers by a score of 91–75. The team was led by Ron Carter, who went on to be the 26th overall pick selected by the Los Angeles Lakers in the 1978 NBA draft. The following year, VMI went 26–4, 8–2 SoCon under first-year head coach Charlie Schmaus. After defeating Duquesne 73–66, they fell in the Sweet Sixteen to Kentucky 93–78.\nDespite going 21–7 the following year, VMI lost in the Southern Conference tournament semifinals to Marshall. After a dismal 1–25 season two years later, Schmaus departed VMI. Blair went on to become the coach of the NBA's New Jersey Nets and Minnesota Timberwolves.\nBig South Conference.\nVMI became a member of the Big South Conference in 2003. The first team in VMI's Big South tenure went 6–22 and 4–12 in the conference under Bart Bellairs, who had been the coach since 1994. After a 3–13 conference campaign the following year, Bellairs was fired on February 28, 2005.\nDuggar Baucom era.\nBetween 1978 and 2005, VMI had just three winning seasons between head coaches Marty Fletcher, Joe Cantafio, and Bart Bellairs. During that time the Keydets made only two tournament final appearances in 1985 and 1988. Following the firing of Bellairs in 2005, VMI hired Duggar Baucom, a former Tusculum College head coach and North Carolina state trooper.\nBaucom's first season as coached saw continued failure with a 7–20 record. However, the next season in 2006–07, VMI reached the Big South Championship game for the first time, despite a 12–18 regular season and 6th seed in the conference. They ultimately fell to Winthrop 84–81. That season was the first in which Baucom implemented a high-scoring, run-and-gun offense which garnered a considerable amount of notability. VMI averaged 100.9 points per game as well as 14.9 steals per game and 442 total three-pointers made, all of which led the NCAA that year.\nIn 2008–09, VMI reached the championship again, but fell to Radford 108–94. The loss ended the Keydets' season at 24–8, which was tied for the second-highest single-season win total in VMI history. It was highlighted by a season-opening upset win over Kentucky in Rupp Arena, 111–103. Senior twins Chavis and Travis Holmes led the team with 22 and 19.1 points per game, respectively, and ultimately became the highest-scoring twins in NCAA history.\nThe Keydets reached the Big South final once again in 2012, despite being the 7th seed, but fell to UNC Asheville 80–64. It was the first season since the 2006–07 campaign that VMI did not lead the nation in scoring, ending a streak of five consecutive years. VMI returned to their usual high-scoring pace in 2013–14, leading the nation in scoring averaging 88.3 points. Most notably, the Keydets made their first post-season tournament in 37 years as they accepted an invitation to the CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament. VMI cruised through the first two rounds, defeating Canisius 111–100 and IPFW 106–95. In the quarterfinals they erased a 17-point deficit to defeat Ohio, but fell at home to Yale in the semifinals, 75–62. The loss ended VMI's year at 22–13, which was only the fifth 20-win season in the program's history. On March 30, 2015, Baucom accepted the head coaching position at The Citadel.\nPostseason results.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Keydets have participated in three NCAA Tournaments.

        "text": "The 2007–08 Memphis Tigers men's basketball team represented the University of Memphis in the 2007–08 college basketball season, the 87th season of Tiger basketball. The Tigers were coached by eighth-year head coach John Calipari, and they played their home games at the FedExForum in Memphis, Tennessee. The team was the most successful in Tigers' history reaching the NCAA Championship game for the second time and setting numerous school records. It is also one of the most successful in college basketball history, setting the record for most wins in a season at 38–2.\nHowever, all wins and one loss were vacated in 2009 after an investigation into the eligibility of Derrick Rose and the Tigers officially finished the season 0–1.\nSeason summary.\nNon-conference play.\nThe Tigers began the season ranked No. 3 as a result of a strong recruiting class led by Derrick Rose and returning veteran stars Chris Douglas-Roberts and Joey Dorsey. To start non-conference play, the Tigers defeated powerhouses Oklahoma and Connecticut in the 2K College Hoops Classic at Madison Square Garden in New York. On the same court in the Jimmy V Classic, they won an overtime thriller over USC led by O. J. Mayo. On December 22, they defeated No. 5 Georgetown by 14 and No. 17 Arizona the next week. On January 21, the undefeated Tigers were ranked No. 1 by both major polls after a loss by number-one North Carolina. The Tigers started the season 26–0, the best start to a season in Memphis history.\nConference play.\nEntering conference play, the Tigers were predicted to match the previous years undefeated run in the conference. Memphis started the season 26–0, the best in history. However, the record start was tested in a mid-season, non-conference bout against in-state rival No. 2 Tennessee. In a highly anticipated No. 1 vs. No. 2 matchup covered by ESPN Gameday, the Volunteers beat the top-ranked Tigers at home 62–66. The Tigers finished Conference USA play undefeated for the second straight year, and won the conference tournament for the third straight year. Memphis finished the season with a 38-1 record and became the Conference USA regular season champions.\nNCAA tournament.\nIn the NCAA tournament Memphis received the No. 1 seed in the South. In opening rounds in Little Rock, they defeated No. 16-seeded Texas–Arlington and 8-seed Mississippi State. They moved on to regionals in Houston where they defeated No. 5 seed Michigan State. In the regional final, they knocked off a No. 2-seeded Texas team playing near to its home in Austin. In the Final Four, Memphis beat UCLA and proceeded to the national championship game. The Tigers fell in overtime to Kansas, 68–75 after a game-tying three-pointer at the regulation buzzer by Kansas star Mario Chalmers.\nChris Douglas-Roberts was named a first-team All-American, and prospective number-one draft pick Derrick Rose was named to the third team. The Tigers finished the season 38–2 (16–0), as Conference USA regular season and tournament champions. The 38 wins broke a record shared by the 1986 Duke Blue Devils, 1987 UNLV Runnin' Rebels, and 2005 Illinois Fighting Illini for the most wins in NCAA Division I history. It would be matched later by the 2012 and 2015 Kentucky Wildcats.\nNCAA investigation.\nThe NCAA determined in 2009 that Derrick Rose had forfeited his eligibility because the Educational Testing Service voided Rose's SAT Reasoning Test score that made him eligible to play at Memphis. Additionally, the NCAA determined that even without the questions about Rose's SAT score, Rose would have lost his eligibility in December 2007 due to his brother being allowed to travel with the team for free. All 38 wins and one NCAA tournament loss were subsequently vacated by the NCAA for rules violations, leaving the team with an official record of 0–1. The NCAA also made Memphis remove banners commemorating the 2008 season. This included a banner commemorating three seniors who finished the season with the most wins by any player in NCAA history with 137 from 2005 to 2009. Memphis also forfeited all NCAA tournament revenues.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=6 style=| Regular season\n!colspan=6 style=|Conference USA Tournament\n!colspan=6 style=|2008 NCAA tournament"

The team currently competes in the Southern Conference. Western Carolina won the 1996 Southern Conference tournament and participated in the 1996 NCAA tournament.\nTeam history.\nThe school's first basketball team convened for the 1928-29 season and has played continuously since. The Catamounts were 1930 Southeastern Junior College champions and made their first NAIA tournament appearance in 1947. Jim Gudger brought success to the program, leading them to its first 20-win season in 1952-53, a North State Conference tournament championship in 1959, two Carolinas Intercollegiate Athletic Conference tournament championships in 1962 and 1963, four NAIA District tournament appearances in 1959, 1963, 1966, and 1968, and an appearance in the 1963 NAIA national championship game where the Catamounts lost to Texas-Pan American (now UT Rio Grand Valley). After leaving for Texas A&amp;M, Commerce, Gudger was succeeded by Jim Hartbarger who continued the Catamounts success by appearing in the 1971 and 1972 NAIA District tournaments. After moving to NCAA Division I, the Catamounts made their first appearance in the NCAA tournament in 1996 after winning the 1996 Southern Conference tournament. They fell to 1 seed Purdue 71-73, almost becoming the first 16 seed to beat a 1 seed in NCAA tournament history.\nLarry Hunter (2005-2018).\nIn 2005, Western Carolina hired N.C. State assistant coach, and former Ohio and Wittenberg head coach, Larry Hunter to succeed Steve Shurina as head coach. Hunter led the Catamounts to their first winning season since 1999-00 with a record of 16-15 and a co-Southern Conference North Division title during the 2008-09 season. Hunter followed up this success in 2009-10 by leading the Catamounts to a 22-12 record and an appearance in the 2010 CollegeInsider.com Tournament, their first 20-win season since 1971-72 and their first postseason berth since 1996. Hunter again led the Catamounts to a co-Southern Conference North Division title during the 2010-11 season. On February 2, 2012, Hunter won his 100th game as head coach of the Catamounts with an 82-76 win over Chattanooga. The Catamounts made an improbable run to the 2012 Southern Conference tournament championship game before falling to Davidson 91-93 in double overtime, their first appearance in the championship game since 1996. Hunter led the Catamounts to another run during the 2014 Southern Conference tournament, this time falling to Wofford 53-56 in the championship. Hunter returned the Catamounts to the postseason in 2016, accepting a bid to the College Basketball Invitational (CBI) where they fell to Vermont in the first round. Larry Hunter resigned as head basketball coach on March 4, 2018. He finished his career at Western Carolina with a record of 193-229, two postseason appearances, and two divisional titles.\nMark Prosser (2018-2021).\nMark Prosser was hired to succeed Larry Hunter on March 27, 2018. After leading the team to a 7-25 record in his first season, Prosser led the Catamounts to a 19-12 record during the 2019-20 season. The 12 win improvement was the second-most in Division I. The Catamounts were set to compete in a postseason tournament before the COVID-19 pandemic canceled all postseason basketball tournaments. After leading the team to an 11-16 record during the 2020-21 season, Prosser accepted the head coaching job at Winthrop.\nJustin Gray (2021-2024).\nOn April 13, 2021, former Wake Forest standout Justin Gray was hired as Prosser's successor, the 19th head coach in program history. Leading the team to a 11-21 record in his first season, Gray turned a corner and led the Catamounts to a 18-16 record and 4th place finish in the Southern Conference, their best finish since 2014-15. Gray again led the Catamounts to a 4th place finish in the Southern Conference in his third year, finishing with a 22-10 record during the 2023-24 season. The 22 wins were the most in a season for the Catamounts since 2009-10.

They play their home games at various grounds across Somerset, most often in Taunton, and are captained by Emily Edgcombe. Somerset consistently competed in either Division 1 or Division 2 of the Women's County Championship, and won Division 2 of the Women's Twenty20 Cup in 2019. In 2021, they won the West Midlands Group of the Twenty20 Cup. They are partnered with the regional team Western Storm.\nHistory.\n1953–1999: Early History.\nSomerset Women first formed in 1953, and played their first recorded match on 6 June that year, against Gloucestershire A. After this, Somerset played various one-off games, whilst West of England Women, which included Somerset, played in the Women's Area Championship from 1980 until 1996 and the Women's County Championship from 1997 until 1999.\n2000– : Women's County Championship.\nSomerset replaced West of England Women in the County Championship in 2000, and finished 3rd in Division 2 in their first season. Somerset remained in the second division until 2005, when they were promoted. This then began a period in which Somerset bounced between the two divisions, being promoted in 2008, 2011, 2015 and 2017 and relegated in 2006, 2010, 2012, 2016 and 2018. Somerset also missed out on promotion in play-offs in 2013 and 2014, with the game being abandoned in 2013 and losing to Warwickshire Women in 2014. In 2019, Somerset finished second-bottom of Division 2.\nSomerset have fared similarly in the Women's Twenty20 Cup, for example winning promotion to Division 1 in 2014 and 2016 before being relegated in the following seasons. In 2019, Somerset won Division 2 with 6 victories from 8 games. Following the 2019 season, women's cricket in England was restructured and the 2020 season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, only the Twenty20 Cup took place, with Somerset competing in the West Midlands Group. They won their regional division, winning 5 of their 8 matches. Somerset bowler Lorraine Szczepanski was the second-highest wicket-taker in the tournament, with 13 wickets, and batters Georgia Hennessy and Sophie Luff were the 2nd and 4th leading run-scorers, respectively. They finished second in their group in the 2022 Women's Twenty20 Cup and subsequently progressed to the group final, where they lost to Warwickshire. In the 2023 Women's Twenty20 Cup, all of the side's group stage matches were rained-off, but they beat Devon and Wales on the group Finals Day to win their group. They also played various 50-over friendlies against other sides in the South West.\nSomerset have had various notable players appear for them over the years, most prominently the former England players Anya Shrubsole and Fran Wilson.\nPlayers.\nNotable players.\nPlayers who have played for Somerset and played internationally are listed below, in order of first international appearance (given in brackets):"

He played for 11 seasons, including four in Major League Baseball. He was a right-hander who stood tall and weighed during his active career.\nCareer.\nDuckworth was signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers as an amateur free agent in 1957. He was selected in the 1959 minor league draft by the Cincinnati Redlegs.\nDuckworth had not yet been called up to the major leagues when the Washington Senators selected him in the 1962 Rule 5 draft. Duckworth was on Washington's 1963 opening day roster and won his first big league game in relief against the New York Yankees on May 26, 1963. While playing for the Senators in 1964, Duckworth missed a series in California due to his fear of flying. Washington docked him three days pay. On September 4, 1965, Duckworth struck out eight of the first nine Detroit Tigers batters he faced. He finished the game with 11 strikeouts in seven innings. In his next game he struck out 13 Twins in seven innings. \nOn June 23, 1966, the Senators traded Duckworth and a reported $20,000 to the Kansas City Athletics for Ken Harrelson. Five weeks later, on July 30, Kansas City traded Duckworth back to Washington. Duckworth played his last major league game with Kansas City on July 24, 1966.\nAs a big leaguer, Duckworth dropped 25 of his 32 decisions for a woeful .219 winning percentage, with an earned run average of 5.26. His 97 appearances included 29 starts, and he was credited with two complete games. As a relief pitcher, he registered four saves and 27 games finished.

He played as a flanker for Border Reivers, Edinburgh and Scotland sevens between 2006 and 2015, and has coached at the Scottish Rugby Academy and Edinburgh. Since 2019, he has been forwards coach for Ulster.\nEarly life.\nGrant was born in Jwaneng, Botswana to Scottish parents and soon after moved to Cape Town, South Africa. He attended Western Province Prep School where he started playing rugby at the age of 11. From there he moved on to Bishops where he continued his sporting career. It was here that Grant was selected to play for the South African under-15 and under-16 waterpolo sides. Halfway through his high school career he moved out of the Western Cape to the Midlands of Natal to attend Hilton College.\nIt was here that his rugby career really started to take shape moving from the centres to the back row. Grant played for the school's first XV as well as the Natal Schools side. Upon completing high school, Grant moved to Scotland where he began his professional career.\nRugby runs in Roddy's family: his grandfather (Bob) and great-uncle (George) were international referees, the latter was also Scotland full back in 1950 and 1951 and manager of the 1977 Lions in New Zealand, and Grant's father played for British Universities.\nCareer.\nHe joined Border Reivers in summer 2006 as an apprentice, and the following January he made his debut for the professional team as a substitute in the Magners League match against Newport Gwent Dragons at Rodney Parade. He was awarded the 2008 John Macphail Scholarship, allowing him to have a summer playing for Auckland University club in New Zealand.\nGrant started as open-side flanker in all five of Scotland's matches in the 2006 Under 19 Rugby World Championship in Dubai in April 2006. Later that year he made his international sevens debut for Scotland in the Dubai tournament which opened the IRB's 2006–07 series. He played in six of the tournaments in that series.

        "text": "Watson v British Boxing Board of Control [2001] QB 1134 was a case of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales that established an exception to the defence of consent to trespass to the person and an extension of the duty of care expected in cases of negligence. Michael Watson was injured in a boxing match supervised by the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC or BBBC), which was expected to provide medical care. This care was insufficient, and as such Watson was in a coma for 40 days, and spent 6 years in a wheelchair. After recovering consciousness, he sued the BBBC in negligence, and was awarded approximately £1 million by the High Court of Justice, who determined that the relationship between the BBBC and Watson was sufficient to create a duty of care. This decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, who noted that the BBBC had a duty not only to ensure that injuries did not occur, but that injuries were properly treated.\nFacts.\nMichael Watson was a boxer who, on 21 September 1991, fought Chris Eubank under the supervision of the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBC), the British professional boxing governing body. The BBBC had a series of rules on the medical coverage needed for boxing matches, which required two doctors to be present at all times. During the match Watson was knocked out by Eubank, and it was 7 minutes before doctors attended him; eventually 3 doctors and an ambulance were needed. He was given no oxygen, and first sent to a hospital which lacked a neurosurgery unit. Watson spent 40 days in a coma and 6 years in a wheelchair, with doctors initially predicting that he would never walk again. After recovering consciousness, he sued the BBBC, arguing that because they laid down the rules governing professional boxing that ensured his safety, they owed him a duty of care and should have ensured that he was properly and immediately treated.\nJudgment.\nThe case first went to the High Court of Justice, where Kennedy, J, gave his judgment on 24 September 1999, awarding Watson around £1 million in damages. Kennedy held that there was a \"sufficient nexus\" between Watson and the BBBC to create a duty of care, and that Watson's consent to the fight (which would normally be considered a defence of \"volenti non fit injuria\") was not a consent to the inadequate safety measures. The case was then appealed to the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, where a 3-judge panel consisting of Phillips MR, May LJ and Laws LJ delivered their judgment on 19 December 2000. In an opinion read by Phillips MR, the court upheld Kennedy's decision, noting that it \"broke new ground\". Phillips noted that the BBBC had taken control of medically supervising the sport, and that the duty of care was not just to avoid injuries, but \"to ensure that injuries already sustained are properly treated\". This was an extension to the previous duty of care under negligence, and also serves as an exception to the rule under trespass to the person that a defendant will not be liable for personal harm caused in sporting matches which the claimant consents to. Paying the compensation granted to Watson, which was eventually reduced to £400,000, led to the BBBC selling their London headquarters and moving to Wales."

        "text": "The 2010 World Lacrosse Championship was held between 15–24 July. This international men's field lacrosse tournament organized by the Federation of International Lacrosse took place in Manchester, United Kingdom. This was the third time that the tournament was played in Greater Manchester, after the 1978 and 1994 championships.\nThe United States captured their ninth gold medal, defeating Canada 12–10 in the championship game. Paul Rabil of Team USA was named tournament MVP. Australia earned its fourth-straight bronze medal by defeating Japan 16 –9.\nA record 29 nations competed at the event, eight more than the 2006 WLC in London, Ontario. The 101 games were held at the Armitage Centre, Manchester University's sports grounds.\nFor the first time, a FIL World Lacrosse Festival ran alongside the world championships from 17 to 22 July. 48 teams from around the world competed in 8 divisions from U16 to Grand Masters.\nIroquois passport controversy.\nThe Iroquois Nationals' participation in the championships was prevented in a dispute over their passports. The team sought to travel on Haudenosaunee passports, but the United Kingdom government would not allow it because of increased passport security requirements. The United States Department of State initially also refused to allow the passports, but later granted the team a one-time waiver to travel to the tournament. However, the U.K. would not issue the team visas.\nInitially, the Iroquois were hoping to be able to travel, and agreed to forfeit their first game against England. Because it was the opening game of the tournament, organizers arranged for the host team to play Germany in an exhibition match instead. However, just before game time, the FIL decided to move Germany to the Blue Division and the Iroquois to the Plum Division, making the England-Germany match an official one. The Iroquois team did not officially withdraw from the tournament, and would have been allowed to play its remaining games should it have resolved its passport difficulties in time. On 18 July, the FIL announced that the competition schedule had progressed too far to allow Iroquois to compete in the tournament. Each of the other three Plum Division teams were given 1–0 forfeit victories over the Iroquois team.\nPool play.\nFor pool play, nations were separated into seven divisions according to strength, the top six teams were placed in the Blue Division, and the other teams were put in six divisions of four. Each of the thirty nations were eligible to win the championship. Each division played round-robin games for ranking to determine which tournament brackets they would be placed in.\nBlue Division.\nThe Blue Division originally consisted of the top six teams from the 2006 World Lacrosse Championship, but Germany was moved up to replace the missing Iroquois team. The first and second place teams from the Blue Division advanced to the tournament semifinals. The third and fourth place teams advanced to the quarterfinals. The fifth and sixth place teams were placed into the 5th through 8th place classification bracket.\nCanada's 10–9 win over the United States marked the first time that the American team lost a preliminary round game in any world championship, and only its third loss overall. Both teams ended up advancing to the semifinals.\nJapan, Australia, and England all finished 2–3 in the Blue Division and 1–1 in head-to-head matches against each other. All three games between the teams were close, with two going into overtime. Japan and Australia advanced to the quarterfinals based on goal differential in those matches.\nIntermediate Round.\nStarting on 19 July, all teams except for the Blue Division moved to one of three intermediate brackets: either the upper, middle, or lower bracket.\nUpper bracket.\nThe upper bracket included the six first-place finishers from each division as well as the top two second-place finishers. These teams were still eligible for the World Championship and could have finished anywhere from 1st to 16th in the tournament. By winning two games in the upper bracket, Scotland and Netherlands advanced to the quarterfinals.\nMiddle bracket.\nThe middle bracket included the remaining four second-place finishers and the top four third-place finishers. These teams could have finished anywhere from 9th to 24th in the final rankings.\nLower bracket.\nThe lower bracket included the remaining two third-place finishers and the six fourth-place finishers. These teams could have finished no higher than 17th in the final rankings.\nPlay-in games.\nOn 21 July, Finland beat Poland 13–7 to advance to the 9th–12th place bracket, sending Poland to the 13th–16th place bracket. Italy beat Switzerland 7–6 to advance to the 17th–20th place bracket, while Switzerland entered the 21st–24th place bracket."

        "text": "Robert \"Bobby\" Butler (born April 26, 1987) is an American former professional ice hockey forward. He played in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Ottawa Senators, New Jersey Devils, Nashville Predators and Florida Panthers and won the 2011 Calder Cup championship while with the Binghamton Senators.\nPlaying career.\nAmateur.\nAs a youth, Butler played in the 2000 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with the Minuteman Flames minor ice hockey team, and then in the 2001 tournament with the Middlesex Islanders.\nPrior to enrolling at the University of New Hampshire (UNH), Butler played three seasons with the Boston Jr. Bruins of the Eastern Junior Hockey League from 2003–2006 and five seasons with Marlborough High School from 2000–2005, making the varsity team as an eighth-grader. During the 2004–05 season, he helped both his high school team and junior team to championship titles. At Marlborough High School (MHS), Butler recorded 284 points in 116 games as well as breaking the school's record in goals scored during his junior year, tallying 58 goals in 25 games. While at MHS, he played for his father, who coached the team for 25 years, retiring in 2011. Butler's MHS hockey point totals are celebrated in a prominent banner at the Navin Rink in Marlborough, which celebrates former MHS players that accumulated more than 100 points during their high school careers.\nButler capped a standout four-year college career by being named the New Hampshire Wildcats' co-captain and finishing second among all NCAA Division I players in goals in 2009 – 10, scoring 29 for UNH, earning him a nomination as a finalist for the Hobey Baker Award as the top U.S. college hockey player. The Wildcats went 87–49–17 with him in the lineup and also qualified for the NCAA Tournament all four seasons that he was enrolled at the school. On March 24, 2010, Butler was recognized as the 58th recipient of the Walter Brown Award, which is presented annually to the best American-born college hockey player in New England. He was also selected as Hockey East's Player of the Year, an All-Hockey East First Team honoree, the Hockey East Player of the month for November, the Hockey East scoring champion, a Hockey East Three Stars Award winner and a 2010 Hockey Humanitarian nominee for his efforts in the community. He recorded 61 goals, 60 assists and 88 penalty minutes over his four-year, 153-game collegiate career at New Hampshire.\nProfessional.\nOn March 29, 2010, he signed a two-year contract with the Ottawa Senators of the National Hockey League. He made his NHL debut with Ottawa on April 1 in a 4–3 shootout win against the Carolina Hurricanes. After attending the 2010 training camp, Butler was assigned to the Binghamton Senators.\nButler scored his first NHL goal against Nikolai Khabibulin of the Edmonton Oilers on February 12, 2011, and recorded his first assist in the same game, on a goal by Milan Michálek.\nAfter spending the remainder of the season in Ottawa and recording 10 goals and 11 assists in 36 games, he was returned to Binghamton where he helped lead the club to a Calder Cup victory, notching 13 goals and 7 assists during the 23 game playoff.\nOn July 14, 2011, he was rewarded for his solid 2010–11 season with a two-year, one-way contract with the Ottawa Senators. However, Butler responded with a much poorer 2011–12 season than expected, registering only 6 goals and 16 points in 56 games. As a result, in July 2012 the Senators placed Butler on waivers with the intent of buying out his contract. On July 27, 2012, the Senators announced that his contract had been bought out, making Butler a free agent.\nOn August 9, 2012, Butler signed a one-year, two-way contract with the New Jersey Devils organization. With the 2012 NHL lockout in effect, he was directly assigned to AHL affiliate, the Albany Devils. Upon commencement of the shortened 2012–13 season, Butler was recalled to New Jersey and made his Devils debut against the New York Islanders at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum on February 3, 2013. Butler scored his only goal with the Devils against the Pittsburgh Penguins on February 9. After registering 2 points in 14 games with the Devils Butler was placed on waivers by the Devils and claimed by the Nashville Predators on March 4, 2013.\nOn June 14, 2013 he was traded to the Florida Panthers in exchange for T.J. Brennan.\nOn July 15, 2015, Butler signed his first contract abroad in agreeing to a two-year contract with Swedish club, Modo Hockey of the SHL. However, he parted ways with Modo after one year and then headed to Medveščak Zagreb of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL), where he started the 2016-17 campaign. In December 2016, after having played in 37 games (six goals, ten assists) for Zagreb, he transferred to fellow KHL outfit Torpedo Nizhny Novgorod.\nAs a free agent in the following off-season, Butler returned to North America and opted to sign a one-year AHL contract with the Milwaukee Admirals on August 10, 2017. In the 2017–18 season, Butler led the Admirals with 24 goals and finished second with 45 points through 62 games.\nHe continued his career in the AHL following the conclusion of the season, signing a one-year contract with the Hartford Wolf Pack, affiliate of the New York Rangers, on July 2, 2018.\nDuring his coaching tenure, Butler opted to return to the professional circuit, initially playing a one off appearance with the Worcester Railers of the ECHL on January 2, 2022, earning first-star honours with three points in a 5-3 victory over the Reading Royals. On January 21, 2022, Butler opted to sign a contract for the remainder of the season with the Railers, finishing with 16 points through 20 games.\nFollowing two years with the Railers, appearing as captain in his second season, Bulter announced his retirement from professional hockey on August 16, 2023. \nCoaching career.\nWhile in his final two seasons within the AHL, Butler transitioned to coaching in originally performing as the Director of player development with the Boston Junior Bruins from 2017–2019. He ceased his professional career from 2019–2022, performing as the Director of Hockey Operations for the Worcester Jr. Railers and as a NCAA volunteer assistant coach with the Holy Cross.\nInternational play.\nButler represented Team USA in the 2013 World Championship with three goals and one assist for four points to help Team USA win the bronze medal.\nOn January 1, 2018, it was announced that Butler would represent the United States at the 2018 Winter Olympics. He went scoreless over 5 games as Team USA finished in 7th place."

The competition was held from 6 August 1928 to 7 August 1928. 59 fencers from 22 nations competed. Each nation could have up to three fencers. The event was won by Lucien Gaudin of France, the nation's third victory in the individual men's épée—taking sole possession of most among nations above Cuba and Belgium, each at two. Gaudin was the second man to win both the foil and épée events at a single Games. It was the third consecutive Games at which France reached the podium in the event. Two Frenchman had reached the head-to-head final; Gaudin won over Georges Buchard, who received silver. Bronze in 1928 went to American George Calnan, the nation's first medal in the event.\nBackground.\nThis was the seventh appearance of the event, which was not held at the first Games in 1896 (with only foil and sabre events held) but has been held at every Summer Olympics since 1900.\nSix of the 12 finalists from the 1924 Games returned: gold medalist (and 1920 finalist) Charles Delporte of Belgium, bronze medalist Nils Hellsten of Sweden, fifth-place finisher (and 1920 gold medalist) Armand Massard of France, seventh-place finisher Georges Buchard of France, seventh-place finisher Léon Tom of Belgium, and ninth-place finisher Peter Ryefelt of Denmark. Buchard was the reigning (1927) World Champion; his countryman Lucien Gaudin was the 1921 World Champion. The two were favored in the event. \nBulgaria, Chile, Finland, Mexico, and Romania each made their debut in the event. Belgium, Great Britain, and the United States each appeared for the sixth time, tied for most among nations.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition format was unusual. It began with the same general four-round, pool-play format in use since 1908 (though with some modifications). However, it added an \"extra final\" medal round which placed the top four finishers in the \"final\" into a single-elimination bracket with a bronze medal bout. In each round before the \"extra final\", each pool held a round-robin; however, the number of touches changed by round. Double-touches counted as touches against both fencers, and both fencers could lose a bout if a double-touch resulted in each reaching the prescribed number of touches against. There were no barrages.\nResults.\nSource: Official results; De Wael\nRound 1.\nEach pool was a round-robin. Bouts were to one touch, with double-losses possible. The top six fencers in each pool advanced to the second round.\nQuarterfinals.\nEach pool was a round-robin. Bouts were to one touch, with double-losses possible.

The bouts were to 10 touches, but the winner had to win by at least 2 or the bout continued."

Three of the 1924 finalists returned: gold medalist (and 1920 bronze medalist) Roger Ducret and two-time silver medalist Philippe Cattiau of France, along with sixth-place finisher Ivan Joseph Martin Osiier of Denmark. Osiier was competing in the Games for the fifth time of his eventual seven.

The nation which won the most individual bouts took the team bout (with total touches as the tie-breaker if the teams split 8-8).\nHungary beat both Italy and Poland, which had each beaten Germany; therefore, the Hungary-Germany match was unnecessary as Hungary would win gold and Germany take fourth regardless of the results. The reason for not holding the Italy-Poland match is less clear; the official report says it was not necessary, but presumably the winner would be the silver medalist while the loser would take the bronze. Italy had defeated Poland 16-0 in the semifinals, which may have been how the final placing was decided."

It started on the island of Corsica on 29 June and finished on the Champs-Élysées in Paris on 21 July. The Tour consisted of twenty-one stages and covered a total distance of . The overall general classification was won by Chris Froome of . Second and third respectively were Nairo Quintana () and the rider Joaquim Rodríguez.\nMarcel Kittel () was the first rider to wear the general classification leader's yellow jersey after winning stage one. He lost the lead the next day to Jan Bakelants of , who managed to obtain a one-second lead from a late solo attack. Simon Gerrans gained the race lead after his team, , won the stage four team time trial. Gerrans passed the lead on to teammate Daryl Impey after the fifth stage. Froome took the lead from Impey after a dominant performance in the eighth stage, the first classified as mountainous. Froome maintained his lead for the remainder of the race by consolidating his lead through solid performances in the individual time trials and another dominant win on Mont Ventoux, while defending his GC lead in the mountains of the final week from his nearest challenger, the white jersey and eventual King of the mountains, Nairo Quintana.\nFroome became the second consecutive British cyclist to win the Tour de France, after Bradley Wiggins accomplished the feat the year before. In the race's other classifications, rider Quintana took the mountains classification with a summit victory in the final mountain stage edging out Froome, and also finished as the best young rider in the general classification, finishing in second place overall; Peter Sagan of the team was the winner of the points classification, with finishing as the winners of the team classification. Christophe Riblon () was given the award for the most combative rider. Kittel won the most stages, with four.\nTeams.\nTwenty-two teams participated in the 2013 edition of the Tour de France. The race was the 18th of the 29 events in the UCI World Tour, and all of its nineteen UCI ProTeams were entitled, and obliged, to enter the race. On 27 April 2013, the organiser of the Tour, Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO), announced the three second-tier UCI Professional Continental teams given wildcard invitations, all of which were French-based. The presentation of the teams took place at the harbour of Porto-Vecchio on the island of Corsica on 27 June, two days before the opening stage held in the town. Each team arrived by boat to the stage, before being introduced to the crowd.\nEach squad was allowed a maximum of nine riders, therefore the start list contained a total of 198 riders. Of these, 54 were riding the Tour de France for the first time. The riders came from 34 countries; France, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, Australia, Belgium and Germany all had 10 or more riders in the race. Riders from ten countries won stages during the race; German riders won the largest number of stages, with six. The average age of riders in the race was 29.45 years, ranging from the 19-year-old Danny van Poppel () to the 41-year-old Jens Voigt (). Of the total average ages, was the youngest team and the oldest.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nUCI ProTeams\nUCI Professional Continental teams\nPre-race favourites.\nIn the run up to the 2013 Tour de France, Chris Froome () was widely considered as the top pre-race favourite for the general classification, with his closest rivals thought to be Alberto Contador () and Joaquim Rodríguez (). 's Vincenzo Nibali was also a possible contender after getting his first Tour podium in 2012 but he had focused on the 2013 Giro d'Italia. The other riders considered contenders for the general classification were riders Cadel Evans and Tejay van Garderen, Richie Porte (), Jurgen Van den Broeck (), Thibaut Pinot (), Ryder Hesjedal (), Robert Gesink (), and riders Alejandro Valverde and Nairo Quintana.\nThe 2012 Tour de France winner, Bradley Wiggins of , had focused on the Giro d'Italia, but retired early due to illness, subsequently pulling out because illness and injury had left him insufficient time to train for the Tour de France and chose not to ride. This left Froome, runner-up in 2012, the undisputed leader of . He had shown his form so far in 2013 season by winning four of the five stage races he had ridden: Tour of Oman, Critérium International, Tour de Romandie and Critérium du Dauphiné. Two-time Tour winner (2007 and 2009) Contador returned to the race having been suspended from the 2012 race; he had won the 2012 Vuelta a España and his best major result of the season was second in Oman. Rodríguez had podium finishes in both the Giro and Vuelta in 2012, as well as winning the UCI World Tour. He had top-ten placings in three major stage races in the season.\nThe sprinters considered favourites for the points classification and wins in bunch sprint finishes were Mark Cavendish (), Peter Sagan (), André Greipel (), Matthew Goss () and riders Marcel Kittel and John Degenkolb. Cavendish won the points classification at the 2013 Giro and had shown his form with thirteen wins in the season. In the previous year's Tour, Sagan won the points classification and had won the same at the Tour de Suisse in the month preceding the Tour. Greipel, whose team manager Marc Sergeant claimed he had the best sprint train, came into the Tour with nine wins in the season, including three at the Tour Down Under. Goss only had one victory in the season, but had a team of strong and experienced riders. Kittel, as with Greipel, would arrive with a team dedicated for the sprints and he had accumulated eleven wins in the season. His teammate Degenkolb won five stages at the 2012 Vuelta and it was thought he was most likely to be used for the hillier stages.\nRoute and stages.\nOn 24 November 2011, the ASO announced Corsica would host the 2013 edition's opening stages (known as the \"Grand Départ\"), the first time the Tour has visited the island. The route of the race was unveiled on 24 October 2012 at the Palais des Congrès in Paris. The Tour was the first to be completed entirely on French soil since 2003 and included ten new start or finish locations. The \"Grand Départ\" in Corsica consisted of three stages. The ASO chartered the \"Mega Smeralda\" cruiseferry in Porto-Vecchio to house members of the organisation, media and others who work on the Tour and to host press conferences. It featured a final set of stages which were described by journalist William Fotheringham as \"brutal\", including three Alpine stages in the last week along with a \"viciously hard\" time trial. As the 100th edition of the race, the race featured some of the famous climbs from the history of the race, Mont Ventoux and Alpe d'Huez, which was climbed twice in a stage for the first time.\nThe opening stage left Porto-Vecchio and ended in Bastia, with next two stages ending in Ajaccio and Calvi respectively. The race then moved to mainland France at Nice. Stages five to eight formed a four-stage journey that navigated westwards finishing at the Ax 3 Domaines ski resort in the Pyrenees. Stage nine took place between Saint-Girons to Bagnères-de-Bigorre, before a long transfer moved the race to the north-west of the country. Stage ten finished in the port city of Saint-Malo, with the next finishing at the Mont Saint-Michel island commune in Normandy. The following four stages, 11 to 15, crossed the centre of the country back to the south-east finishing atop Mont Ventoux. The next five stages took place in and around the Alps, before a second long transfer took the Tour to the finish with the Champs-Élysées stage in Paris.\nThere were 21 stages in the race, covering a total of , shorter than the 2012 Tour. The longest mass-start stage was the fourth at , and stage 20 was the shortest at . Eight stages were officially classified as flat, three medium mountain, seven high mountain, two individual time trial and one team time trial. There were four summit finishes: stage 8, to Ax 3 Domaines; stage 15, to Mont Ventoux; stage 18, to Alpe d'Huez; and stage 20, to Semnoz; The highest point of elevation in the race was the -high Port de Pailhères mountain pass on stage eight. It was among seven \"hors catégorie\" (English: beyond category) rated climbs in the race. The final stage ending on the Champs-Élysées was an evening finish for the first time. There were ten new stage start or finish locations. The rest days were after stage 9, in Saint-Nazaire, and 15, in Vaucluse.\nRace overview.\nOpening week and Pyrenees.\nIn the first stage, the team bus had become stuck under the finishing arch in Bastia, Corsica, and with the peloton (the main group) away, the race officials moved the finish to the to go marker. As the peloton closed in, the bus was freed, and the decision was reversed. Marcel Kittel took the victory from the bunch sprint, putting him in the race leader's yellow jersey; he also became the first leader of the points classification, with Juan José Lobato () taking the polka dot jersey as the leader of the mountains classification. Two crashes occurred in the stage; the first with remaining and the second in the final kilometres, which included a contender for the stage, Mark Cavendish. The second stage 's Jan Bakelants launched an attack from a breakaway group in the final kilometre to win in Ajaccio, one second ahead of the encroaching peloton. The yellow jersey switched to Bakelants, and Pierre Rolland of claimed the polka dot. Simon Gerrans () won the third stage, the final in Corsica, from a bunch sprint in Calvi. Peter Sagan took over the points classification. won stage four's team time trial in and around Nice, putting Gerrans in the yellow jersey. came in second place, one second in arrears, with a further two.\nThe fifth and sixth stages ended in bunch sprints, with Cavendish and André Greipel the victors respectively. After stage six, Daryl Impey became the first South African rider to wear the yellow jersey. His teammate Gerrans ensured it for him by holding back at the finish allowing Impey – who was second overall – the time necessary to replace him at the top of the general classification. Sagan claimed the seventh stage from a bunch sprint in Albi, with rider Blel Kadri talking the polka dot jersey. In stage eight, the Tour's first mountain stage, which ended at the Ax 3 Domaines, Froome attacked a select five-rider group, which included Alberto Contador and Alejandro Valverde, as they passed the lone leader Nairo Quintana with remaining. Froome took the stage win, fifty-one seconds ahead of his teammate Richie Porte, with Valverde third a further seventeen down. Contador and Quintana finished one minute forty-five seconds behind Froome. Froome's victory win put him in the lead of the general and mountains classifications, ahead of Porte. In the ninth stage, Froome managed to subdue attacks from his rivals, although his team's efforts left him isolated for the majority of the stage. After a descent from the mountain pass of La Hourquette d'Ancizan, a group of twenty-three riders came into the finish in Bagnères-de-Bigorre, where Dan Martin () beat Jakob Fuglsang () from sprint, twenty seconds ahead of the group. Porte lost eighteen minutes, dropping from second overall to thirty-third, with Valverde moving up to second. Rolland took back the polka dot jersey. The next day was the first rest day of the Tour.\nNorth-west and journey south.\nKittel took his second stage of the Tour win from the bunch sprint in the tenth stage, with his compatriot Greipel second. Stage eleven's individual time trial between Avranches and Mont Saint-Michel was taken by 's Tony Martin. Froome came second with a deficit of twelve seconds, over two minutes ahead of the second placed overall Valverde, extending his lead to over three minutes. Two flat stages ending with bunch sprints then followed; the first, stage twelve, was won by Kittel, ahead of Cavendish, who came back to win the next. The stage saw Valverde suffer a punctured tyre and lose almost ten minutes, struggling to match the pace set by Cavendish's team at the head of the race. Stage fourteen was taken by 's Matteo Trentin from a large breakaway that held off the peloton.\nStage fifteen, finishing on Mont Ventoux, saw Froome's Team Sky set a brutal pace on the opening kilometres of the Ventoux, so that all of the leading contenders, with the exception of Froome and Contador, dropped on the early part of the final climb. Froome then moved away from Contador and quickly caught Quintana, who had attacked earlier in the climb. The pair worked together to put time into their rivals, before Froome attacked with remaining and soloed to the finish for a second stage win. This gave Froome a lead of four minutes and fourteen seconds over Mollema in second place, with Contador, who had cracked completely in the final kilometre, a further eleven seconds back. Froome regained the lead in the mountains classification. The following day was the Tour's second rest day.\nAlps and finale.\nThe sixteenth stage saw a twenty-six rider breakaway reach the final climb, the Col de Manse, where Rui Costa () attacked and then descended on his own to the finish in Gap. Froome won stage seventeen's time trial, finishing the course from Embrun to Chorges in 51 minutes and 33 seconds, with Contador coming in nine seconds behind, in second place. Contador moved up to second overall, four minutes and thirty-four seconds down, with teammate Roman Kreuziger third. In the Tour's queen stage, the eighteenth, early breakaway riders Christophe Riblon () and Tejay van Garderen led on the second ascent of Alpe d'Huez. Van Garderen attacked on the early slopes, opening up a margin of forty-five seconds on Riblon in the second part of the climb, before Riblon passed with remaining and took the stage win by fifty-nine seconds. Quintana and Rodríguez came in fourth and fifth respectively, over two minutes in arrears. With to go, Porte and Froome, who came in under minute after the aforementioned pair, were penalised twenty seconds as Porte went back to the team car to retrieved an energy gel and water bottle for Froome outside the designated zone. Froome extended his lead over Contador by thirty-seven seconds.\nCosta repeated his feat of three stages previous by taking victory in stage nineteen, by attacking on the final climb of Col de la Croix Fry and soloing to the finish in Le Grand-Bornand. There were no major changes at the head of general classification. Stage twenty, the penultimate stage, saw the leaders of the general classification still together at the head of the race with remaining of the final climb of Mont Semnoz. Quintana and Rodríguez then attacked, with Froome the only rider able to bridge, and again the pair pulling away, with Quintana managing to hold off Rodríguez by eighteen seconds to take the stage win, with Froome a further eleven down. Contador came in seventh, two minutes and twenty-eight in arrears, dropping to fourth overall, with Rodríguez moving up to third. With the double points gained with his win Quintana secured the mountains classification.\nThe final stage was won by Kittel on the Champs-Élysées, his fourth stage win of the race. Froome finished the race to claim his first Tour de France, becoming the second British rider to win the race. He beat second-placed Quintana by four minutes and twenty seconds, with Rodríguez third, a further forty-four seconds down. Sagan won his second consecutive points classification with a total of 409, 100 ahead of Cavendish in second. Froome placed second behind Quintana in the mountains classification, with Rolland third. The best young rider was Quintana, followed by Andrew Talansky () and Michał Kwiatkowski () respectively. finished as the winners of the team classification, eight minutes and twenty-eight seconds ahead of second-placed . Of the 198 starters, 169 reached the finish of the last stage in Paris.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThere were four main individual classifications contested in the 2013 Tour de France, as well as a team competition. The most important was the general classification, which was calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage. There were no time bonuses given at the end of stages for this edition of the Tour. If a crash had happened within the final of a stage, not including time trials and summit finishes, the riders involved would have received the same time as the group they were in when the crash occurred. The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered the overall winner of the Tour. The rider leading the classification wore a yellow jersey.\nThe second classification was the points classification. Riders received points for finishing among the highest placed in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints during the stage. The points available for each stage finish were determined by the stage's type. No points were awarded for the team time trial on stage four. The leader was identified by a green jersey.\nThe third classification was the mountains classification. Points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit of the most difficult climbs first. The climbs were categorised as fourth-, third-, second-, first-category and \"hors catégorie]\", with the more difficult climbs rated lower. Double points were awarded on the summit finishes on stages 5, 15, 18 and 20. The leader wore a white jersey with red polka dots.\nThe final individual classification was the young rider classification. This was calculated the same way as the general classification, but the classification was restricted to riders who were born on or after 1 January 1988. The leader wore a white jersey.\nThe final classification was a team classification. This was calculated using the finishing times of the best three riders per team on each stage, excluding the team time trial; the leading team was the team with the lowest cumulative time. The number of stage victories and placings per team determined the outcome of a tie. The riders in the team that lead this classification were identified with yellow number bibs on the back of their jerseys and yellow helmets.\nIn addition, there was a combativity award given after each stage to the rider considered, by a jury, to have \"made the greatest effort and who has demonstrated the best qualities of sportsmanship\". No combativity awards were given for the time trials and the final stage. The winner wore a red number bib the following stage. At the conclusion of the Tour, Christophe Riblon won the overall super-combativity award, again, decided by a jury.\nA total of €2,023,300 was awarded in cash prizes in the race. The overall winner of the general classification received €450,000, with the second and third placed riders got €200,000 and €100,000 respectively. All finishers of the race were awarded with money. The holders of the classifications benefited on each stage they led; the final winners of the points and mountains were given €25,000, while the best young rider and most combative rider got €20,000. Team prizes were available, with €10,000 for the winner of team time trial and €50,000 for the winners of the team classification. There was also a special award with a prize of €5,000, the Souvenir Henri Desgrange, given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to first rider to pass the summit of the highest climb in the Tour, the Port de Pailhères. This prize was won by Nairo Quintana on stage eight.\nUCI World Tour rankings.\nRiders from the ProTeams competing individually, as well as for their teams and nations, for points that contributed towards the World Tour rankings. Points were awarded to the top twenty finishers in the general classification and to the top five finishers in each stage. The 587 points accrued by Chris Froome put him in to the lead of the individual ranking, with Peter Sagan dropping to second. retained their lead of the team ranking, ahead of second-placed . Spain remained as leaders of the nation ranking, with Great Britain second."

        "title": "Elbrus climbing routes",
        "text": "There exist a number of climbing routes used to reach the summit of the Mount Elbrus, most based in approaches through Prielbrusye National Park on its southeastern flank.\nNormal Route.\nThe Normal Route is the easiest, safest and fastest on account of the cable car and chairlift system which operates from about 9am till 3pm. Starting for the summit at about 2am from the Diesel Hut should allow just enough time to get back down to the chairlift if movement is efficient. In bad weather the chairlift section may be closed, also note the chairlift ride is 15-minutes long and can be very cold.\nThe majority of groups take the cable car system from Azau roadhead to Mir Station from where either a one-hour walk or a chairlift takes them to Garabashi – \"The Barrels\" or to Leaprus hut – also called \"The crashed UFO\". Above it may be possible to hire a snowcat to go to the Diesel Hut (site of the burnt \"Priut 11\" Hut) or higher to Pastukhova Rocks. Walking this takes 90 minutes to the hut and almost two hours more to the rocks. The walk to the Saddle takes another three to four hours and from there to the summit, a further 90 minutes should be allowed for.\nThere are no major difficulties on the route, however after strong winds icy sections may be exposed and a fall could result in a slide. Particular care should be taken on the traversing ascent from the Saddle. The Saddle hut is a ruin that offers no shelter. There are few crevasses of any size or danger if one sticks to the route, but straying only 50m off the route could lead the climber into dangerous terrain. Details:\nSample Itinerary\nKiukurtliu Route.\nA longer ascent route starts from below the cable-way Mir station and heads west over glacier slopes towards the Khotiutau pass. Some distance before reaching this the south spur of the Kiukurtliu Cupola is climbed to a broad glaciated saddle behind pt.4912 (top of the SW spur). Now a rising traverse north is made to attain the easy northwest spur by which the summit is gained. This expedition involves three nights' camping–bivouacs; parties also need a rope, axe and crampons.\nOther routes.\nClimbing Elbrus from other directions is a tougher proposition because of lack of permanent high facilities. Douglas Freshfield always maintained that a route from the east up the Iryk valley, Irykchat glacier and over the Irykchat pass (3667m) on to snowfields below long rock ribs of the east spur would become the shortest and most used approach. A hut built long ago on the north side of the lrykchat pass is now wrecked. In addition, the high elevation change calls for at least two camp-bivouacs.\nPermits.\nThree are required:\nAll of these permits can be arranged in advance by agents."

        "title": "Dartmouth Big Green men's ice hockey",
        "text": "The Dartmouth Big Green men's ice hockey team is a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I college ice hockey program that represents Dartmouth College. The Big Green are a member of ECAC Hockey. They play at the Thompson Arena in Hanover, New Hampshire.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nDartmouth College fielded their first ice hockey team in January 1906, winning their first game 4–3. The team played an expanded schedule the next two years but after a 1–5–1 finish in 1908 the program hired its first head coach and promptly posted a 10–3–1 record. The ice hockey club would bring in a new bench boss each year until 1912 when Fred Rocque stayed for three seasons followed by Clarence Wanamaker with four. Dartmouth was able to win more than they lost during this time despite the coaching turnover and the lack of local facilities. The team played precious few games at home, hosting a total of 16 over 13 seasons. In 1918 the university decided to suspend the program as a result of the ongoing first World War but returned in January 1920 and had continued unabated ever since. The same year the team increased its number of home games by beginning to play on Occom Pond but despite this Wanamaker would leave after the year and the coaching carousel began anew with three more coaches over 6 years. J. Philip Bower settled the program with his 7-year stint and while the first on-campus rink was built in 1929 the team started losing and Bower was out after 1933. After 4 years of Herbert Gill the Indians were able to finally find their man in Eddie Jeremiah.\nJeremiah Years.\nJeremiah, a three-time letterman for the Indians, got his career started with a bang, producing an 18–4 mark in his first year, breaking the team record for wins and post the second-best winning percentage. The team would continue to play well under their new coach, earning winning records each year until they dominated the college hockey landscape in 1941–42, going 21–2, setting a host of team records and being named as the national collegiate champion. Jeremiah would leave after the championship to serve in the military for the duration of World War II but the team continued to play well in his absence. Dartmouth was one of the few programs that played through the duration of the war and over the next three seasons the team did not lose a single game. Utilizing three coaches (two of them serving jointly) the program went 26–0–1 and sported future Hall of Fame members Dick Rondeau, Charlie Holt and Bill Riley. Jeremiah returned for the team's 1945–46 season and did not appear to have missed a step, posting two tremendous years before the first NCAA tournament was announced for 1948. The Indians continued to trounce their competition, going 20–2 during the season and with the best record in the nation they were the first team selected from the east. With Riley brothers Bill and Joe leading the attack Dartmouth rolled over tournament host Colorado College 8–4 and met Michigan in the final. The Wolverines took a one-goal lead twice in the opening frame but the Indians were able to match them both times. The roles reversed in the second period with Dartmouth briefly pulling ahead but entering the final period the score was tied 4–4. The Indians faltered in the third, allowing 4 Michigan goals and lost the game 8–4. Despite the disappointment Joe Riley was named the most outstanding player in the tournament\nThe next season Bill Riley led the nation in scoring, posting 41 assists and 78 points, setting season- and career-best marks for Dartmouth while his brother tied the team record for goals in one season with 45. Dartmouth slipped a bit in the standings, finishing 16–5 during the season but they returned to the tournament along with the same three teams from the year before. The Indians were given a change to avenge their loss from the year before and took advantage by dropping the powerhouse Wolverines 4–2 and reached their second championship game. Over the course of the season Boston College had lost only one game and that was to Dartmouth. The Indians played the Eagles close, taking a 2–1 lead into the second period after Bill Riley scored with less than a minute remaining in the first. BC responded with two quick goals in the second and the held the Indians off the board until the third. Shortly after Alan Kerivan tied the game the Eagles got their fourth goals of the night and held on to win the game. Once again, despite losing the championship, a Dartmouth player was named as tournament MOP, this time the award went to Dick Desmond, another future member of the US hockey hall of fame as well as a silver medalist at the 1952 Winter Olympics.\nAfter two consecutive runs in the NCAA tournament Dartmouth sharply declined. The team spent the next decade posting middling-to-bad records but this did not prevent Jeremiah from receiving the first Spencer Penrose Award in 1951. The Indians posted a good record in 1959, going 17–8 but were edged out for the NCAA tournament by teams with better records. The following year Dartmouth had the best winning percentage of any eastern team (.725) and were one of four eastern teams selected for two play-in games (the only time this happened in NCAA tournament history) where they lost to Boston University and them promptly declined in the succeeding years.\nTwo years later Dartmouth was one of 28 teams that founded ECAC Hockey but the change did little to improve their fortunes. Jeremiah took the 1964 season off and his assistant Abner Oakes took over, leading the team to a 14–7 record, good enough for 6th in the conference but were snubbed by the ECAC selection committee and left out of the 8-team tournament. Once Jeremiah returned and the weakest dozen teams were removed from the conference, Dartmouth posted another good record, finishing 14–9 and this time they were invited to the ECAC tournament but lost to eventual champion BC in the quarterfinals. Over the next two seasons the Indians won only 9 games but Jeremiah was award the Spencer Penrose Award for the second time in 1967. After that year Jeremiah resigned as head coach due to ill health and then died from cancer three months later.\nReturn to the NCAA Tournament.\nOakes coached the team for three years after Jeremiah's departure before turning the program over to Grant Standbrook. The Indians were able to produce three good years under Standbrook and made their second ECAC tournament in 1974 but again could not get out of the quarterfinals. That year the university changed the team nickname to the Big Green after several years of pressure to move away from their unofficial 'Indians' moniker. Standbrook would coach one more season, ending on a sour note, before Dartmouth moved on to George Crowe. The Big Green opened the season with their new head coach in a new home building, the Rupert C. Thompson Arena. In their new digs the Big Green improved markedly, rising to 16 wins in Crow's first year and returned to the ECAC tournament. After two modest seasons, one in which the team began sponsoring a holiday tournament, the Auld Lang Syne Classic, Dartmouth rose to 4th in the conference and won 19 games for the first time since 1948 and made their first ECAC championship game. Though the team lost the conference title tilt they were given the second eastern seed and returned to the tournament for the first time in 30 years. Dartmouth opened against the WCHA champion North Dakota and lost a close game to the western champion 4–2 ben then redeemed themselves slightly with a consolation game victory. The following year the ECAC split their conference into three divisions and Dartmouth became the first Ivy Region champion. The Big Green rode their division title back to the ECAC title match, losing to fellow Ivy team Cornell and getting the second eastern seed for the second consecutive year. Dartmouth found themselves in a rematch with the Fighting Sioux but the results were much the same with North Dakota winning 4–1. Once more Crowe's team won the consolation match to at least get something out of their tournament appearance but after 1980 the Big Green slid down the standings.\nDecline to the bottom.\nCrowe coached Dartmouth for four more years and could not post a winning record. Brian Mason was brought in 1984, fresh off of two fantastic years with Division II RIT, but he could not replicate his success at the Division I level. In six seasons Mason's teams topped out at 10 wins and finished with losing records every year. They never finished better than 9th in the 12-team conference (after several former members left in 1984 to form Hockey East) and consequently never made an appearance in the ECAC tournament. Mason was fired in 1990 and his assistant Jeff Kosak was hired but after 10 days he resigned, citing 'personal and family reasons'. Dartmouth was eventually able to get Ben Smith to serve as head coach for the 1990–91 season but after posting a program-worst 1–24–3 record he left to take over at Northeastern. Smith's replacement, Roger Demment, was able to improve the team's record but not by much. Over the next six seasons Dartmouth remained below .500 but was able to make the ECAC tournament twice, through they lost both games they played.\nGaudet Years.\nIn 1997 Dartmouth hired Bob Gaudet away from Brown, giving the program the first Dartmouth alumnus to helm the team since Oakes in 1970. The first three years under the new bench boss were much of the same but in Gaudet's fourth season the Big Green finally posted a winning season and won an ECAC tournament game both for the first time since 1980, ending a 21-year period of futility. The Big Green would record winning seasons over seven straight campaigns, twice winning 20 games (for the first time since 1948) and shared the ECAC regular season title in 2005–06, their first conference title in team history. Despite the championship Dartmouth was left out of the NCAA tournament after losing to Harvard in the ECAC semifinal with a 10–1 debacle. Dartmouth continued to play well under Gaudet who became the team's all-time leader in victories in 2018, but the Big Green did not win a conference semifinal game during his tenure nor made an NCAA tournament appearance since 1980.\nReid Cashman.\nOn April 24, 2020, Bob Gaudet announced his retirement. His replacement, Reid Cashman, was named Big Green coach on June 1, 2020.

        "text": "The first instances of organized women's ice hockey in Canada date back to the 1890s when it was played at the university level. The Women's Hockey Association claims that the city of Ottawa, Ontario hosted the first game in 1891. In 1920, Lady Meredith, an avid sportswoman and wife of Sir Vincent Meredith of Montreal donated the Lady Meredith Cup\nto the Quebec Ladies' Hockey Association, said to be the first women's ice hockey trophy created for a competition in Canada. At the time women competed in ankle-length skirts.\nIn February 1921, a women's North American championship series was played in conjunction with the Pacific Coast Hockey Association. The Vancouver Amazons from the 1920s became one of the first professional teams. They were the first women's hockey team from Vancouver to participate in the invitational women's hockey tournament sponsored by the Banff Winter Carnival. On December 16, 1922, a meeting was held to announce the formation of the Ladies Ontario Hockey Association. The Dominion Women's Amateur Hockey Association was founded in winter 1933. Lady Bessborough, the wife of Governor General of Canada Lord Bessborough donated a championship trophy.\nIn 1978, Cookie Cartwright organized the Ontario Women's Hockey Association to generate interest in women's ice hockey. Fran Rider became the executive director. Cartwright solicited help from several experienced hockey people including Rhonda Leeman Taylor, Bev Mallory, Carl Noble, and later on, Frank Champion Demers. Rhonda Leeman Taylor became the first Development Coordinator for the women's game in the province. Coaches were quoted in the Toronto Star that Rhonda may bring the women's game into respectability.\nThe Abby Hoffman Cup was introduced in 1982 at the first Canadian National Women's Hockey Championship known as the \"Shopper's Drug Mart Women's Nationals\". In 1982, the first Esso Women's Nationals occurred in Brantford, Ontario, Canada under the guidance of Rhonda Leeman Taylor, who after went on to become the first woman to sit on Hockey Canada's board of directors. The final saw Alberta and Ontario face-off, with attendance of approximately 1,600 fans.\nLeeman Taylor was the first individual to take women's hockey into the Corporate Board Room of Canada. For the first Nationals she was able to seek National Sponsorship from Shoppers Drug Mart and Air Canada. Also in 1982, she lobbied several Provinces to eliminate intentional checking from the women's game. All Provinces voted for the rule change except for one province. In addition, she founded and directed the Female Council, a subsect of the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association, representing female hockey in Canada.\nIn April 1987, Toronto, Ontario hosted the first ever Women's World Championship, though the tournament was not recognized by the International Ice Hockey Federation. The Ontario Women's Hockey Association hosted the tournament. During the tournament, representatives from participating nations met to establish a strategy to lobby the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) for the creation of a Women's World Championship. The first IIHF-sanctioned tournament was held in Ottawa, Ontario in 1990. Women's hockey was included in the Olympics for the first time in 1998.\nEarly history.\nLord Stanley of Preston's daughter, Lady Isobel Stanley, was a pioneer in the women's game and was one of the first females to be photographed using puck and stick (around 1890) on the natural ice rink at Rideau Hall in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Stanley, Canada's sixth Governor General, provided the ice for women's hockey games, transforming a large lawn on the grounds of Rideau Hall into a rink. Better known for his contribution of the challenge trophy later referred to as the Stanley Cup, Lord Stanley played a significant role in the development and growth of Canadian women's hockey. There have been disputes over where the first women's ice hockey game was played in Canada. The Women's Hockey Association claims that the city of Ottawa, Ontario hosted the first game in 1891. On February 11, 1891, one of the earliest newspaper accounts of a seven-a-side game between women appeared in the \"Ottawa Citizen. \"\nIn the 1890s, women's ice hockey was introduced at the university level. McGill University's women's hockey team debuted in 1894. The University of Toronto and Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario were also some of the earliest Canadian universities to field women's ice hockey teams. Queen's would later discontinue its women's teams.\nOn March 8, 1899, an account appeared in the \"Ottawa Evening Journal\" newspaper of a game played between two women's teams of four per side at the Rideau Skating Rink in Ottawa. From 1915 to 1918 Albertine Lapensée played for the Cornwall Nationals. She is often considered Canada's first female hockey \"superstar\". In 1920, Lady Isobel Brenda (Allan) Meredith of Montreal donated the 'Lady Meredith Cup', the first ice hockey trophy in Canada to be competed for between women in ankle-length skirts. Lady Meredith (the wife of Sir Vincent Meredith) was the first cousin of Sir H. Montagu Allan who had donated the Allan Cup for men's amateur ice hockey in 1908. In the 1910s, women's ice hockey is known to have been played in Victoria, British Columbia.\nElizabeth Graham would play ice hockey for Queen's University and is credited as being the first goaltender ever to wear a mask for protection. She used the mask in 1927, and the use of the mask was in the \"Montreal Daily Star\". She actually wore a fencing mask and the speculation is that she had used the mask as a means of protecting dental work that had been recently performed.\nAbigail \"Abby\" Hoffman, gold medallist in the 880 yard event at the 1966 Commonwealth Games, first made a name for herself in ice hockey. She cut her hair short and pretended to be a boy in order to play with the St. Catharines Teepees, in a boys league. Once it was discovered that Hoffman was masquerading as a boy, the story made headlines around the world. An Ontario Supreme Court decision barred her from participating, although her parents challenged the league's \"boys only\" rule, but the league's policy was upheld by the provincial high court. In later years, Hoffman would help organize a national women's hockey championship (with representation from each province).\nDuring the 1960s, Cookie Cartwright and a group of dedicated students revived the women's ice hockey program at Queen's University. Cartwright and the Golden Gaels would go on to capture the first women's university championship.\nThe women's game in Canada has been governed by the men's hockey system, except for Ontario which is governed by a separate women's hockey association. The Ontario Women's Hockey Association (OWHA) formed in 1975 and, though it was founded on the principles of collegialism (a collective volunteerism), it has shifted toward a professional mandate in more recent years.\nThe province of Ontario has seen growth in the number of women participating in hockey. In 2003, there were 31,122 hockey players in female leagues in the province of Ontario. These players were part of 2,060 teams. In 1993, Ontario had 7,848 girls registered on 557 teams.\nPCHA Tournament.\nAs early as January 1916, Frank Patrick and Lester Patrick talked of the formation of a women's league to complement the Pacific Coast Hockey Association. The proposal included teams from Vancouver, Victoria, Portland and Seattle. The proposed league was never formed.\nIn early January 1921, a team from Victoria, referred to in the Victoria Colonist as the Victoria and Island Athletic Association ladies team defeated a team from the University of British Columbia. This was the first reported occurrence of women's ice hockey in Victoria since 1914. In February 1921, Frank Patrick announced a women's international championship series that would be played in conjunction with the Pacific Coast Hockey Association. The three teams that competed were the Vancouver Amazons, Victoria Kewpies, and Seattle Vamps. On February 21, 1921, the Seattle Vamps competed against the Vancouver Amazons in Vancouver, and were vanquished by a 5–0 score. Two days later, the Vamps played against a team from the University of British Columbia and won the game. Jerry Reed scored three goals (a hat trick) in the game for the Vamps. In both games, the Vancouver media referred to the Seattle team as the Seattle Sweeties. The Amazons would travel to Seattle and defeat them again. On March 2, 1921, the Vamps were defeated by the Kewpies 1–0 in Seattle. In the rematch on March 12, the Vamps travelled to Victoria. The result was a 1–1 tie, and Jerry Reed scored the goal for Seattle. The goaltender for the Vamps was Mildren Terran. After the 1921 season, the Vamps and the Kewpies ceased operations.\nEarly rules.\nAt first, referees in the women's game were male. When women fell to the ice, the male referee was expected to help them get back on their feet. Until 1914, women participating in hockey in Western Canada were expected to wear long skirts.\nWestern Canadian history.\nReporters in Western Canada would refer to women not as hockey players but as fair manipulators of the twisted hickory.\nAlberta.\nThe first mention of a women's ice hockey game occurred in Medicine Hat in 1897. Two years later, the Edmonton Ladies Hockey Team was the first Canadian women's hockey team to endorse a commercial product. In an 1899 team photo, the Ladies Club is pictured lacing up Starr Acme Club skates. In the winter of 1937, intergender matches were contested in Alberta. A ladies club from Nanton, Alberta was formed and they defeated a local men's club by a 3–2 score.\nIn High River, Alberta, a high school girls team was formed. The team played a boys peewee team, also from High River, and this game was won by the boys team.\nThe Edmonton Rustlers were winners of the 1933 Alpine Cup, and defeated the Preston Rivulettes to become National Champions. It was one of the few times that the Rivulettes ever lost a game as Hazel Case scored the game-winning goal and the Rustlers prevailed by a 3–2 score. In 1934, the Rivulettes were slated to play the Rustlers in a rematch for the national championship, but the Rivulettes were unable to raise the $1800 necessary. By default, the Rustlers were champions.\nBritish Columbia.\nSandor holds the recognition of having the first women's hockey team in the province. The 1900 Rossland Winter Carnival added women's hockey as an event. After 1900, the Rossland Winter Carnival was recognized as hosting the Provincial women's hockey championships. In 1911, the Rossland Carnival final between Rossland and a team from Grand Forks, BC was hailed as the women's championship of the world.\nCalgary.\nCalgary's roots in women's hockey date back to 1908. A Swastika skating club was formed in 1909 (at the time, the swastika was considered a sign of good fortune), and formations of teams in the Calgary Collegiate Institute and Mount Royal College provided women with many opportunities to participate. Calgary's first city team was the Calgary Crescents. The Crescents played teams from Red Deer, Okotoks, Canmore, Banff, and Medicine Hat.\nAt the 1917 Banff Winter Carnival, the Crescents qualified for the championship game but were defeated by the newly formed Calgary Regents. As Banff carnival champions, the Regents were given the Bernard-Harvey Trophy, which was introduced in the 1917 championship in an attempt to increase the status of the women's competition. It is unclear when the Bernard-Harvey Trophy was later replaced, however, financial accounts of the Alpine Club of Canada indicate that the club paid for a \"Carnival Cup\" in 1920. Newspaper accounts of what became known as the Alpine Cup did not appear until the winter carnival of 1921. The Crescents would play their final game at the 1918 Banff Carnival and would defeat the Regents. The defeat of the Regents would allow the Edmonton Monarchs to win the tournament.\nIn 1919, the Calgary Patricias were formed but they were never able to usurp the Calgary Regents as a better team. The Regents would win the Banff Winter Carnival tournament in 1919, 1920 and 1921. In addition, the Regents would go undefeated for four years. In February 1921, the wrote to Canadian Amateur Hockey Association president H. J. Sterling seeking recognition and approval to enter tournaments. He was sympathetic to the cause, but not approval was given and promised to discuss it with other ladies' clubs including Winnipeg and Ottawa. In 1924, the Regents would dissolve and form a new team with some members of the Calgary Byngs Ladies club. The newly formed team was known as the Calgary Holliles, and they actually lost their first game, a 2–0 defeat at the hands of the Calgary Patricias. The Hollies would win four Banff tournaments and be awarded the Alpine Cup.\nIn mid January 1921, the city of Calgary introduced its own winter carnival to compete with the Banff Winter Carnival. A women's ice hockey game was featured. The Calgary Regents defeated a team from Fernie.\nDuring the 1936–37 season, the Calgary Avenue Grills (named after their sponsor, the Avenue Grill restaurant) were the provincial champions of Alberta. They were scheduled to play the Preston Rivulettes in March 1937 at Maple Leaf Gardens but were prevented to. The Dominion Women's Amateur Hockey Association intervened and ask that the Avenue Grills ladies team join the DWAHA. When the Avenue Grills refused to, a ladies team from Winnipeg was chosen to play the Rivulettes.\nEastern Canadian history.\nThe Eastern Ladies Hockey League, which played their first match on December 13, 1915, were also known as La ligue du hockey des dames de Montréal.\nThe fastest ice hockey hat trick scored by a woman was done in Canada. The hat trick was scored in 35 seconds. This was accomplished in Canada by Melissa Horvat. At the time, she played for the Burlington 1 Bantams. Said hat trick was scored against Stoney Creek in Burlington, Ontario, on March 4, 2006\nMaritimes.\nWith the involvement of future Olympian Stacy Wilson, various women at Acadia University formed a women's hockey team in 1984. There was no varsity hockey team at the university so the team was a club team. The team wore used Acadia varsity men's hockey sweaters, and raised funds to play in a few tournaments. Wilson and her teammates were part of two Nova Scotia provincial championships. In addition, the Acadia club team represented Nova Scotia at the Women's National Championship in 1986 and 1987.\nAfter Wilson graduated from Acadia University in 1987, she began to play senior women's hockey with the Moncton Blades (later known as the Maritime Blades). New Brunswick did not have a senior women's hockey league, therefore, the Blades were forced to arrange competitive games against men's minor hockey teams and men's old-timer teams. In order to play competitive hockey against other women, the Blades had to travel to Quebec. From 1988 to 1998, the Blades represented New Brunswick at the Women's National Hockey Championship. A member of the women's Team Canada hockey team since the first world championship in 1990, Wilson was also instrumental in launching, with the support of the Canadian Hockey Association (CHA), the first female hockey school in 1995.\nTeams.\nPreston Rivulettes.\nThe Rivulettes were inducted into the Cambridge Sports Hall of Fame in 1996. Although there is no clear origin, speculation is that an incident occurred in 1930 at Lowther St. Arena. The Preston Rivulettes girls softball team were pondering their future and a member of the team suggested hockey. The story is that an onlooker scoffed at the idea and challenged them. The first nine members of the team were:\nThe Rivulettes played teams from Ontario cities such as Toronto, Kitchener, Stratford, London, Hamilton, Guelph and Port Dover. Over the years, other players represented the Rivulettes team. These included: Violet Hall, Sheila Lahey, Gladys Hawkins, Norma Hipel, Ruth Dargel, Elvas Williams, Fay Hilborn, Winnie Makcrow and Eleanor Fairgrieves, Midge Robertson and Marie Bielstein.\nBetween 1930 and 1940, the team played an estimated 350 games. They lost only two and tied three. For the entire decade of the 1930s, the Rivulettes were the winners of the Bobby Rosenfeld Trophy. The trophy was given to the Ontario champions. In addition, the Rivulettes were six-time winners of the Eastern Canadian championship and the Elmer Doust Cup (the honour for winning the Eastern Canadian championship). The team also won the Lady Bessborough Trophy (given to Canadian Champions) six times.\nThe Rivulettes were invited to play games in 1939 in Europe, but were unable due to the start of World War II. In 1963, the club was inducted into the Canadian Hockey Hall of Fame.\nRossland Ladies hockey team.\nThe 1900 Carnival would see the debut of the Rossland Ladies Hockey Team (women could join the team for fifty cents, while men would be given an honorary membership for the same fee). Rossland played a ladies team from Nelson and won the game by a score of 4–0. One of Rossland's most notable players was Eva Blackman. She would play numerous positions over the year including goaltender. At the 1905 Carnival, no one would challenge Rossland, so the team split into two teams and played each other. The teams were known as the Reds and the Blues. Rossland's biggest upset came in 1917 when the club were defeated a ladies team from Grand Forks for the West Kootenay Championship.\nVancouver Amazons.\nThe Vancouver Amazons were a women's hockey team from the 1920s. They were the first women's hockey team from Vancouver to participate in the invitational women's hockey tournament sponsored by the Banff Winter Carnival. The Amazons competed in 1921. The Amazons qualified for the final that year but were defeated. The team was owned by Frank Patrick, who also owned the Vancouver Millionaires. Patrick would organize a tournament featuring the Amazons, the Seattle Vamps and the Victoria Kewpies. The Amazons went undefeated in the tournament and\ndid not allow a goal. The Amazons were West Coast Women's champions. As the tournament featured a team from the United States, many consider this the first ever\ninternational women's hockey competition. At the Banff tournament in 1922, Elizabeth Hinds, became the first woman from British Columbia to score a hat trick in a game Phebe Senkler was captain of the Amazons and her sister Norah played on defence. The forwards were Kathleen Carson and Nan Griffith, while the goaltender was Amelia Voitkevic. The bench featured Lorraine Cannon and Mayme Leahy.\nThe Amazons qualified for the 1922 final and played the Calgary Regents. In the third period, the Amazons were down 1–0, and Kathleen Carson tied the game. Carson would score the game-winning goal in overtime and were awarded the Alpine Cup.\nOttawa Alerts.\nThe Alerts began play in 1915, taking advantage of the downturn in men's hockey due to the First World War. The team became popular, drawing thousands of fans. In 1917, the team travelled to Pittsburgh and defeated the Polar Milk Maids in a three-game \"world series\". In 1922, they joined the Ladies Ontario Hockey Association and won the Association's first championship title in 1923.\nAssociations.\nLOHA.\nOn December 16, 1922, a meeting was held to announce the Ladies Ontario Hockey Association was formed. The organization was structured similarly to the Ontario Women's Softball Association in which women would run the organization but men served in an advisory capacity. During the December 16 meeting, Frank McEwen, president of the Toronto Hockey League, presided over the meeting. Members from ladies clubs in London, Ontario and St. Thomas, Ontario were present. A letter from the Ottawa Alerts ladies club was presented, indicating their interest to join.\nIn 1923, Janet Allen was the first female to be elected LOHA president. In autumn of 1923, the LOHA suffered a setback when the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association held a meeting in Port Arthur. The Association voted not to give women official recognition as hockey players.\nIn 1927, LOHA president Janet Allen, and LOHA treasurer Bobbie Rosenfeld attended the 38th meeting of the Ontario Hockey Association and asked the OHA to help endorse the league. In the process, they announced that if the OHA would help boost its membership, the LOHA would create a provincial championship for its member teams.\nThe Preston Rivulettes would join the LOHA in 1931. Although their early success would promote women's hockey, by 1938, their later success would prove to be an organization challenge to the LOHA governing body. From 1931 to 1935, the Rivulettes were undefeated and won five consecutive provincial championships.\nMany ladies teams in Ontario did not want to join the LOHA because they felt they had no chance of winning. The Rivulettes success caused the number of member teams to decrease. The decision was for the LOHA to create an A League and a B League. The B League would include first year teams, and teams that were not at a high skill level. LOHA president Bobbie Rosenfeld found it to be the only way to increase the number of member teams.\nIn 1939, new LOHA president Roxy Atkins appealed to past OHA president Dudley to promote the LOHA B League. Atkins wanted Dudley to help increase membership by encouraging ladies teams from Northwestern and Western Ontario to join. Despite the appeal, by 1941, the LOHA was dissolved and it amalgamated with the Ontario branch of the Women's Amateur Athletic Federation.\nDominion Women's Amateur Hockey Association.\nThe Dominion Women's Amateur Hockey Association (DWAHA) was founded in winter 1933. Lady Bessborough, the wife of Governor General of Canada Lord Bessborough donated a championship trophy. The trophy would be contested between the Edmonton Rustlers and the Preston Rivulettes. Presidents of the DWAHA were Myrtle Cook-McGowan before 1937, Bobbie Rosenfeld from 1937 to 1939, and Mary Dunn in 1940.\nThe DWAHA sought to grow its membership to include all provinces in Canada, and to use the national playoffs for the Lady Bessborough Trophy to raise funds and increase the profile of women's hockey in Canada. The DWAHA wanted to showcase its talents by sending an all-star team to Europe to play against teams in France and England; and to petition the Canadian Olympic Committee and the International Olympic Committee for women's hockey to be a demonstration sport at the 1940 Winter Olympics.\nOWHA.\nThe Ontario Women's Hockey Association was founded in 1975 to support the development of the women's game and generate interest in the sport. The OWHA was instrumental in organizing a national women's tournament, which began in 1982, and in hosting the first women's world tournament in 1987.\nProfessional.\nCanadian Women's Hockey League.\nThe Canadian Women's Hockey League (CWHL), preceded by the NWHL and COWHL, was formed in 2007. Teams competed for the Clarkson Cup, donated by former Canadian Governor General Adrienne Clarkson. From 2007 to 2017, the players did not earn a salary, but their travel time, uniforms, equipment and coaches were covered by the league. Jayna Hefford became the first player in the CWHL to record 100 career points. She recorded the record-setting point milestone on January 17, 2009, in a win over the Montreal Stars. On August 12, 2010, the league hosted its first draft, following a reorganization of the league, held at the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto. The first overall selection was former Ohio State hockey player and Olympic gold medalist Tessa Bonhomme.\nA new National Women's Hockey League, launched in 2015 in the United States, was the first women's league to pay a salary. In the 2017–18 and 2018–19 seasons, the CWHL began paying a small stipend to the players as well following an expansion of the league with two Chinese teams. In 2019, the CWHL ceased operations, citing unsustainable business operations.\nNational Women's Hockey League.\nThe National Women's Hockey League (NWHL), based in the United States, began in 2015 as the first professional women's hockey league to pay a base salary for all players. Funding for the new league came from sponsorship and donations, with each team initially receiving approximately $270,000 as a salary cap. The salary attracted some Canadian players such as Kelly Babstock. The league ran into financial issues during its second season leading to the league cutting salaries by half. After the dissolution of the CWHL in 2019, the NWHL announced its intentions of placing expansion teams in Toronto and Montreal. The Toronto Six became the first Canadian expansion team, joining the league for the 2020–21 season. However, in 2019 hundreds of prominent women's players, including Canadian and American Olympians, founded the Professional Women's Hockey Players' Association (PWHPA) and opted to boycott existing leagues, including the NWHL, in pursuit of a unified, financially stable professional league.\nProfessional Women's Hockey League.\nThe goal of the PWHPA was achieved in 2023, when the formation of the Professional Women's Hockey League (PWHL) was announced. That year, the NWHL—rebranded as the Premier Hockey Federation in 2021—was purchased and ultimately dissolved as part of the foundation of the new league. The move had the financial backing of Mark Walter and Billie Jean King. The new league established six charter franchises with three of them in Canada in Toronto, Ottawa, and Montreal. The league debuted in 2024 with a New Year's Day match hosted at the old Maple Leaf Gardens between Toronto and New York. The following day, a match between Ottawa and Montreal drew a record crowd for a professional women's game with 8,318 in attendance.\nThat record was broken on February 16, 2024, at Toronto's Scotiabank Arena, with 19,825.\nPlayers.\nWomen's Ice Hockey in Canada had 85,624 players in 2010. Some well-known players include:\nFigures.\nFran Rider.\nFran Rider was the founding executive director of the Ontario Women's Hockey Association when it was formed in 1975. She would eventually become its president and CEO, and was instrumental in organizing the national women's championship, which launched in 1982, and the first world women's tournament in 1987. She continued to lobby for the international women's game and pushed for an IIHF-sanctioned world tournament, which was achieved in 1990, and for women's hockey to be included at the Winter Olympics, which was achieved in 1998. In 2015, Rider was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2015 in recognition of her substantial impact on the growth and development of the modern game of women's hockey. The Fran Rider Cup is named after her, and was formerly awarded to the second-place team in the national championships. Rider was the first female recipient of the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association's Award of Merit.\nSylvia Romanelli.\nIn 1986, Sylvia Romanelli became the first female president of a boys minor hockey association. Sylvia Romanelli had been the manager of a boys minor hockey team for 4 years prior to being nominated and voted in as president of the Woodbridge minor\nhockey association. Sylvia was the first to introduce participant trophies in the organization in 1974. She was also the first to have regular scheduled exhibition games with GTHL teams. Sylvia was fully responsible for bringing the first OMHA team to Europe for a 2-week tour of 4 countries. She managed her boys 1986 hockey team to an all Ontario championship. \nSamantha Holmes.\nSamantha Holmes played for the Canadian National women's team from 2000 to 2005. Her part in women's hockey history was related to an activist role. As a child she attended the 1988 Winter Games in Calgary. Upon her arrival, she was disappointed to learn that there would not be a women's hockey tournament. After the games she began a letter writing campaign to get women involved in women's ice hockey. She began by writing a letter to her local newspaper. She proceeded by writing to Mississauga mayor Hazel McCallion, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, and IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch. \nShe moved to Calgary in June 2002 and played hockey for the Calgary Oval X-Treme. She competed in two international tournaments for her country, but never participated in the Olympics. After she left the Oval X-Treme, she formed her own team. Her team was the Strathmore Rockies and they joined the Western Women's Hockey League. The idea stemmed from the fact that there were many elite hockey players in Calgary, but not all of them had the opportunity to play for the Oval X-Treme. Holmes also handled the day-to-day tasks of running the Strathmore team. Part of her accomplishments included player scouting, sponsorship and marketing campaigns to operate the team. She is also captain of the Rockies and a graduate of the University of New Hampshire. Holmes runs local skills clinics in Calgary for young women's players.\nHazel McCallion.\nHazel McCallion was well known in Canada for her love of hockey. She played for a professional women's team while attending school in Montreal. McCallion started playing hockey in the late 1920s in the town of Port Daniel, Quebec. She played with her two sisters and was a forward on their team. McCallion later played hockey for $5 a game in the city of Montreal. The team was sponsored by Kik Cola and it was a three team women's league. At one time, she was a board member of the Ontario Women's Hockey League, and was instrumental in getting the Hershey Centre built for the city of Mississauga. McCallion provided assistance for Don Cherry's group to bring an Ontario Hockey League franchise to the city in 1998, and she was instrumental in bringing the IIHF Women's World Hockey Championships to the city in 2000. McCallion also sits on the OWHA Board of Regents.\nMaureen McTeer.\nMaureen McTeer is the wife of former Canadian prime minister Joe Clark. She was raised in Ottawa, to John and Bea McTeer. McTeer's father taught her and her older sister, Colleen, to play hockey, resulting in McTeer's childhood dream of playing in the NHL. Her commitment to feminism and eagerness to combat stereotypes was born when her father reminded her that girls did not play in the NHL.\nIn 1982, McTeer and athlete Abby Hoffman were among the organizers of the Esso Women's Nationals championship tournament for women's ice hockey. One of the tournament's trophies, the Maureen McTeer Trophy, is named for her. It is awarded to the team that finishes in third place at the Esso Nationals.\nJustine Blainey.\nIn 1981, Justine Blainey won a spot on a Metro Toronto Hockey League Team (MTHL) but was denied the chance to play. This denial was attributed to MTHL regulations that did not permit women in the league. Blainey addressed a complaint to the Human Rights Commission but the Ontario Human Rights Code specifically allowed sexual discrimination in sports. Blainey chose to appeal the Ontario law, and she endured five different court cases before finally having her case heard by the Supreme Court of Canada in 1986. Blainey played for the Toronto Lady Blues women's ice hockey program in the 1990s and assumed another activist role. In 1993, (although the Lady Blues won 13 of the last 15 provincial championships), a task force recommended that the University of Toronto cut the team for financial reasons. Blainey, a member of the team, organized a \"Save the Team\" night that raised over $8,000. She personally called 100 alumni during a one-week fundraising blitz.\nPatrick family.\nIn the fall of 1907, the Patrick Family (consisting of five children, including future Hockey Hall of Fame members Frank and Lester Patrick) relocated to Nelson, British Columbia. By 1910, the Patrick family would influence the Nelson Ladies Hockey Club. Myrtle, Cynda and Dora Patrick were all involved with the club. There were so many members, that the club was split into two teams: the Stirlings and the Wanderers. In 1911, the Nelson Ladies Club was coached by Lester Patrick, and Dora was the captain. Once again, the team would eventually split into two smaller teams: the Cubs and the Athletics. After 1911, the Patrick family left Nelson and moved to Victoria. The Nelson Ladies Club would continue until 1916, but would lose to the Rossland team every year.\nTournaments.\nThe OWHA lobbied for a national championship for women. The first Canadian national women's championship was in 1982 and the first corporate sponsor of the event was Shoppers Drug Mart.\nBanff Winter Carnival.\nThe following is a list of all the champion's from the Banff Winter Carnival. The Banff Winter Carnival organizers were known to pay each team up to twenty-five percent of gate receipts to help cover team expenses. In later years, the Carnival would guarantee travel expenses for the competing teams.\nCanada Winter Games.\nThe following were players who participated in the Canada Winter Games women's hockey tournament and would go on to represent Canada in ice hockey at the Winter Olympics\nLipstick tournament.\nThe roots of the Lipstick Tournament can be traced to Wallaceburg resident Grace Small. In early 1966, she requested that arena manager Harold Ribson allow some ice time for teenage girls. Ribson agreed while Gus Lalonde and Doug Myers agreed to coach the local group of teenage girls. After a few games, Ribson arranged a one-day girls tournament, contested on February 27, 1966.\nAlthough this was not the first Lipstick Tourney, eleven women's teams participated. Under Wally Enterprises CEO Jack Lacey, a championship shield was provided for the tournament. The Six Nations girls team won the championship and were declared Ontario champions, as sanctioned by the Ontario Athletic Commission office. Harold Ribson saw the potential of the concept. It was not only an opportunity for female hockey competition but a way to promote the city of Wallaceburg. Ribson (along with Terry Brodeur) selected the Valentine's Day 1967 weekend as the date for the first Lipstick Tournament.\nEntries from sixteen teams were accepted and it involved 256 players from Ontario and Michigan. Jean Walker, who had played in the early 20th century, from Chippewa, ON, dropped the puck at the ceremonial face off. Jack Adams, general manager of the NHL's Detroit Red Wings attended, along with retired Detroit Red Wings netminder Johnny Mowers.\nIn addition, Ribson arranged for the Hockey Night in Canada TV production crew to visit Wallaceburg on Friday night to play an exhibition game with the local Wallaceburg Hornettes women's team. Broadcaster Ward Cornell and Toronto Maple Leafs broadcaster Bill Hewitt attended. TV clips were shown between periods the following night on Hockey Night in Canada. Jack Lacey became involved again as he supplied a set of custom-painted pink-coloured hockey sticks to the Hornettes for use in the tournament. also donated trophies for top scorer, most valuable player and best goaltender.\nThe Port Huron entry won the inaugural 1967 Lipstick Tournament. The second Lipstick Tourney in 1968 was affected by a devastating flood that hit the community in February. The tourney did continue with 16 entries. Hilda Ranscombe from Preston, a member of the 1935 Preston Rivulettes, Canadian champions was the guest of honour. Marian Coveny, who would later play for Team Canada, made one of several appearances in the tournament. Of note, the 1968 tournament would be the last tourney organized by Harold and Lila Ribson. The Wallaceburg Jaycees came forth and volunteered to convene the following Lipstick Tourney as a fund raiser.\nThe Lipstick Tourney was on a strong footing with the Jaycees at the helm and by 1975, the tournament grew to 21 teams. Over 4,500 fans total attended games in 1975, as the tournament was tied to other events that involved Wallaceburg's centennial. Mary Lou Atkins, coach of the first Hornettes team, dropped the puck at the ceremonial face off. Wallaceburg did not enter a team every year due to members leaving for further education and marriage. \nBy 1978, the new local entry was the Knights of Pythias Hawks. In 1980, 28 teams were accepted into the tourney, resulting in some games competed in Dresden. Teams from as far away as Boston and Edmonton competed in the tournament. In 1985, the local entry was called Vanatters Panthers with Dina Celotto the MVP and Lynn McCreary, top goaltender. The last Lipstick Tourney of the 20th Century was held in 1993. In 2006 a group of local parents led by Lynn Vanderveeken revived the Lipstick Tourney.\nAwards.\nAbby Hoffman Cup.\nThe Abby Hoffman Cup was introduced in 1982 at the first Canadian National Women's Hockey Championship known as the \"Shopper's Drug Mart Women's Nationals. The event was held in Brantford, Ontario and the Ontario Women's Hockey Association presented the trophy.\nIsobel Gathorne Hardy Award.\nLady Isobel Gathorne-Hardy's role as a pioneer of women's ice hockey in Canada is acknowledged with the Isobel Gathorne-Hardy Award. The award is given to an active player (at any level) whose values, leadership and personal traits are representative of all female athletes."

        "title": "New Hampshire Wildcats men's ice hockey",
        "text": "The New Hampshire Wildcats men's ice hockey team is a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I college ice hockey program that represents the University of New Hampshire. The Wildcats are a member of Hockey East. They play at the Whittemore Center Arena in Durham, New Hampshire.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nThe first New Hampshire ice hockey team played in January 1925, winning its first two games in a contest held in Lewiston, Maine. A year later, under the stewardship of Ernest Christensen, UNH played its first home game at the UNH ice rink, an outdoor facility that was completely dependent on cold weather for its surface. The Wildcats would play a small number of games for their first 15 seasons, fluctuating between an undefeated season in 1927 and a winless campaign in 1932. Christensen retired in 1938 and the team eventually came under the tutelage of Anthony Dougal but his tenure was suspended in 1943 due to the outbreak of World War II. The team finally returned to the ice in January 1947 with Dougal remaining for one year before handing the program over to Joseph Petroski. Horace \"Pepper\" Martin took over after four rather poor seasons and New Hampshire's fortunes began to change. By the mid-1950s the Wildcats started to play more and win more games than they ever had before and in 1955 an artificial ice rink was constructed on campus to help the team play more than a handful of home games.\nECAC.\nIn 1961 New Hampshire was one of 28 schools that were founding members of ECAC Hockey. Martin turned the team over to A. Barr Snively and plans were underway to replace the Harry C. Batchelder Rink with an indoor ice rink. In the offseason of 1964, two events happened that hampered the ice hockey program. First, in April, head coach Snively suffered a heart attack and tragically died. With the school searching for a replacement the ECAC announced that it was dividing itself into two separate tiers. 'Major' programs would continue on with ECAC Hockey but 'minor' schools would be forced to join the newly-formed ECAC 2. Because their indoor facility had not yet been completed New Hampshire was forced out of the top tier. Rube Bjorkman was eventually named as head coach and he led the team for four years. During his tenure, the indoor arena was completed and christened as the Snively Arena after his late predecessor and a year later the program was readmitted into the top echelon of college hockey.\nIt was Bjorkman's successor, Charlie Holt, who put New Hampshire on the college hockey map. In Holt's first season UNH played its first postseason game, earning Holt his first of three Spencer Penrose Awards. In his first five seasons, the Wildcats finished with a winning record and then won the ECAC regular season championship in his sixth year. The Wildcats made their first NCAA appearance in 1977 and captured their first Conference championship two years later, but no matter how good Holt's teams were national success continued to elude him. under Holt the Wildcats went 0–6 in the frozen four and 2–8 in the tournament overall. While the wins started to come few and far between in the mid-1980s Holt continued to helm the program as it left ECAC Hockey to form Hockey East with six other northeastern schools.\nBob Kullen.\nHolt stepped down in 1986 and was replaced by long-time assistant Bob Kullen. In his first year the team saw marginal improvement but that summer Kullen was diagnosed with a rare form of heart disease that necessitated a transplant and his missing an entire season to recuperate. Dave O'Connor served as the interim head coach for 1987–88 allowing Kullen to return in the fall of '88. In two years New Hampshire saw its wins total improve to 12 and then 17 but by 1990 Kullen started rejecting his new heart and was forced to resign. Another UNH assistant, Dick Umile, was named as his replacement and unfortunately, Kullen died in November 1990 at the age of 41. Hockey East swiftly renamed its coach of the year award in his honor while the team continued the upward swing he began, allowing Umile to be the first recipient of the rechristened award.\nUmile years.\nIn Umile second season New Hampshire made the NCAA tournament for the first time in almost a decade and retroactively finished first in the conference after Maine was forced to forfeit 13 games. The team continued to play well for several seasons but after a disappointing season in 1996, the team won its first Hockey East Championship and set a new program record with 28 wins. The following year the Wildcats made the Frozen Four for the first time in 16 years and then reached even higher in 1999. in the penultimate year of the millennium the Wildcats won 30 games for the first time, establishing a still-record of 31 victories (as of 2019), winning their second conference title (first outright) and were led by sophomore goaltender Ty Conklin and senior center Jason Krog, the latter won the NCAA scoring title by 16 points and captured the Hobey Baker Award (UNH's only recipient as of 2019). Despite losing in the Hockey East tournament finale The team received the #2 overall seed and a bye into the second round. The Wildcats defeated two Michigan schools to reach their first national championship game where they would ultimately fall in overtime to conference rival Maine.\nUNH would continue to be a power in Hockey East, winning back to back conference championships in 2002 and 2003 and reached their second NCAA title game in '03 where they lost to Minnesota, 5-1. UNH would make the NCAA tournament every year from 2002 through 2011 but the team could not make it out of the Regionals after 2003. Starting in 2012 the program began a slow decline, ending up dead-last in the conference in 2017–18. After that season Umile decided to retire, leaving the school as the all-time leader in just about every coaching category and recording the third most wins all-time for one school at the Division I level.\nUmile's final act for the program was to name his successor, allowing 1999 alumnus Michael Souza to become the 14th head coach in program history.\nJohn \"Jack\" French.\nAfter his tour of duty in the US Navy, he worked at the UNH as the Athletic Equipment Manager for a total of 38 years from 1963-2001. He was beloved by the students and staff and holds the record for most games attended including hockey, football, baseball and basketball. He was a member of the Athletic Equipment Managers Association.\nStatistical Leaders.\nSource:\nCareer goaltending leaders.\n\"GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\"\nAwards and honors.\nHockey Hall of Fame.\nSource:\nUnited States Hockey Hall of Fame.\nSource:\nNCAA.\nIndividual awards.\nHobey Baker Award\nSpencer Penrose Award\nNCAA Scoring Champion\nAll-American teams.\nAHCA First Team All-Americans\nAHCA Second Team All-Americans\nECAC Hockey.\nIndividual awards.\nPlayer of the Year\nRookie of the Year\nMost Outstanding Player in Tournament\nAll-Conference teams.\nFirst Team All-ECAC Hockey\nSecond Team All-ECAC Hockey\nHockey East.\nIndividual awards.\nPlayer of the Year\nRookie of the Year\nBest Defensive Forward\nLen Ceglarski Award\nBest Defensive Defenseman\nThree-Stars Award\nCoach of the Year\nTournament Most Valuable Player\nAll-Conference teams.\nFirst Team All-Hockey East\nSecond Team All-Hockey East\nThird Team All-Hockey East\nHockey East All-Rookie Team\nOlympians.\nThis is a list of New Hampshire alumni were a part of an Olympic team.\nNew Hampshire Wildcats Hall of Fame.\nThe following is a list of people associated with the New Hampshire men's ice hockey program who were elected into the New Hampshire Wildcats Hall of Fame (induction date in parentheses).\nWildcats in the NHL.\nWHA.\nSeveral players also were members of WHA teams.\nSource:"

From 2010 to 2015, the Terriers won five Hockey East Championships and made six consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances.\nHistory.\n2023-2024 New Coach Courtney Birchard-Kessel, sister in law of NHL star Phil Kessel.\n2020-2021 Hockey East announced plans in November for a modified season, due to the ongoing Covid19 pandemic. Teams will each play 18 games in a round robin format to determine the regular season champion. BU Terriers will play home and home series on weekends, with day of game travel, to allow time for testing, except when playing the Vermont Catamounts or Maine Black Bears.\n2019-20 Boston University Terriers had a strong year and finished 24-8-4 overall, second in Hockey East. An upset by Maine Black Bears ended their season in the Hockey East quarterfinals. The NCAA tournament was cancelled in March because of the Covid 19 pandemic.\n2015-16 Season\nOn November 3, 2015, Rebecca Russo set the Boston University Terriers women's ice hockey record for most assists in one game, with five against Yale. The Terrier's went on to win their fifth Hockey East championship, and the fourth in four seasons.\n2013-14 Season\nAn Olympic year, the Terriers would be forced to play without star Olympian Marie-Philip Poulin. But despite their frustrating loss in the NCAA Championship game, the team went on to complete an undefeated year in Walter Brown for the entirety of 2013 and the first half of the 2013-14 season, playing 20 undefeated games at Walter Brown Arena. The streak was broken on January 8, 2014 with a 4-1 loss to rival Boston College. The loss shook the Terriers and the team suffered a four-game losing streak between January 17–25. Despite being swept by Boston College at the conclusion of the regular season, BU entered the post season guns blazing and defeated Providence and Northeastern in two 3-2 decisions to advance to the Hockey East Championships against Regular Season Champions Boston College. BU entered the third period of the championship game down 2-1, after a rough second period marred by penalties for the Terriers. Early in the third, a goaltender interference penalty on BC opened up BU's chance and senior Louise Warren managed to fire a shot past the Eagle's senior goaltender, Corrine Boyles to tie the game at 2-2. Five minutes later, freshman Maddie Elia fired a shot from sophomore Rebecca Russo to beat Boyles and give the Terriers a 3-2 lead. BU held on for the remainder of the game and clinched its third consecutive and fourth total Hockey East Championship. Senior Kerrin Sperry was selected as MVP for the second straight year, the second WHEA player to ever receive back-to-back honors.\nWinning the Hockey East Championship gave the Terriers the opportunity to advance to its fifth consecutive NCAA Quarterfinal game, but their low seed required them to play versus top-ranked Minnesota for a rematch of the 2013 championship game. BU could not enact revenge versus Minnesota and dropped the contest 5-1. BU's lone goal came at the hands of Sophomore Sarah Lefort in the first period. Lefort's goal was her 32nd of the season, making her the league leader in goals for the season. Senior Kerrin Sperry made 41 saves in the loss, ending her collegiate career with a program-record 85 wins and 13 shutouts. BU finished their season at 24-13-1.\n2012-13 Season\nThe Terriers rolled into the 12-13 season with a 7-1-0 start in the first month, with the lone loss coming in the form of another sting from Cornell, a 5-2 loss played in Agganis Arena. BU would get revenge in the following game, 5-1. The Terriers proceeded to go undefeated in Walter Brown in the new year, ending their regular season with an impressive 8-game win streak. BU proceeded to trounce Providence 4-0 in the Hockey East Semifinals and Northeastern 5-2 in the Hockey East Championship Game to repeat as champions, BU's third total. Junior Kerrin Sperry was selected as MVP, holding the record for fewest goals allowed in the Hockey East Tournament with three goals over three appearances.\nBU went on to roll past Clarkson 5-3 at Walter Brown Arena in the NCAA quarterfinal game, advancing to the Frozen Four for the second time in program history. BU decisively beat Mercyhurst 4-1 to advance to its second NCAA Championship game, this time versus host Minnesota. Minnesota came into the game with the league's only perfect season and though the Terriers put up a valiant effort against the unstoppable Gophers, BU dropped the championship game 6-3. Freshman Sarah Lefort, Senior Jenelle Kohanchuk, and Junior Olympian Marie-Philip Poulin all tallied goals against Minnesota's Noora Räty. The Terriers ended their season at 28-6-3, the team's fewest losses so far as a varsity team.\n2011-12 Season\nFresh off their loss in the Frozen Four championship game, the Terriers went 5-3-1 in the first month of play, suffering two more losses to defending champions Wisconsin. BU would lose in overtime 4-3 to Northeastern for the Beanpot Final, keeping the Terriers Beanpot-less as a varsity team. However, the Terriers would make their mark on the postseason in an outstanding fashion. BU clinched its second Hockey East championship with a thrilling comeback, a 2-1 2OT win over Providence College. Senior Jennifer Wakefield tied the game 1-1 with 7.3 seconds left in the third period. Wakefield scored again two minutes into the second overtime period to win the game and clinch the Terriers' third NCAA tournament appearance.\nThe postseason saga continued as the No. 5 Terriers faced Cornell in the NCAA quarterfinal game. BU shot out of the gate with three straight goals, and the teams stood at 3-1 at the end of the first period. However, Cornell came out swinging in the second and quickly took a 7-4 lead by the midpoint of the third period. Not to be outdone, the Terriers scored three straight power play goals in the final 10 minutes of regulation to tie the game at 7-7. The teams would go on to play nearly 60 additional minutes of hockey, shattering the record for the longest NCAA Quarterfinal game ever played. Sophomore goaltender Kerrin Sperry would hold off the onslaught of Cornell shots in a spectacular performance, but could not stop a shot sneaked by from Cornell's Lauriane Rougeau. BU ended their season with a heartbreaking 8-7 3OT loss for a season record of 23-14-1.\n2010-11 Season\nEarly in the 2010-11 season, the Terriers made club history. On October 2, Olympic gold medallist Marie-Philip Poulin scored a goal for Boston University in her first NCAA game. The following day, BU defeated North Dakota by a 6-2 mark. It signified the first time in program history that the Terriers defeated an opponent from the WCHA. With her third shorthanded goal of the season on October 15, freshman Marie-Philip Poulin tied BU's single-season record for shorthanded tallies in just four games. She led all NCAA freshmen in goals (9) and points per game (2.00) during October 2010. In addition, she led all Hockey East freshmen in goals, assists and points, and ranked during the month. She was ranked first among all Hockey East players in shorthanded goals with three. In the first seven games of her NCAA career, she had a seven-game point-scoring streak consisting of nine goals and seven assists.\nIn the first half of the 2010-11 season, freshman Kerrin Sperry collected three shutouts and became the first Terrier netminder to record back-to-back shutouts. She accomplished the feat after blanking Connecticut, 4-0, on Dec. 4 and the Northeastern Huskies, 3-0, on Dec. 7. On January 16, 2011, the Terriers defeated Maine and set a program record with their 11th home win of the season. The previous mark was 10 wins during the 2006-07 season. On January 22, 2011, Poulin recorded a hat trick, including two power play goals as BU prevailed over Vermont in a 4-0 win. The win was the Terriers 100th win in program history. Poulin broke BU's single-season points record with her second goal of the game and later tied the single-season goals record with her third marker. The Terriers would lose the Hockey East Semifinal game to Northeastern 2-4, but were high enough ranked nationally to move on to the NCAA quarterfinal round.\nOn March 18, 2011, Jillian Kirchner and junior Jenelle Kohanchuk scored in a 50-second span, as the Terriers advanced to the final of the 2011 NCAA Women's Division I Ice hockey Tournament. Kirchner's goal was the game winner as the Terriers improved to 27-6-4 and became the first Hockey East school to advance to the national title game. At season's end, Catherine Ward was the first ever Terrier to be named an All-American, as she was selected for the second team. In the Frozen Four championship, Marie-Philip Poulin was the only player who scored a goal as the Terriers fell by a 4-1 score to Wisconsin.\n2009-10 Season\nHaving advanced to and lost the second consecutive Hockey East tournament, the Terriers began their 09-10 season hungry for the postseason. The season featured BU's record-high of 12 ties, but a new record low of 9 losses. On March 8, 2010, sophomore Tara Watchorn scored at 9:52 in overtime as the Number 3 seeded Terriers triumphed over No. 5 seed University of Connecticut at Providence College. The Terriers clinched their first ever Hockey East Tournament title and earned a spot in the NCAA Tournament. The 2010 Hockey East Tournament Championship game was the first ever to go into overtime in the eight-year history of the league. Though the Terriers would go on to lose to Mercyhurst 4-1, their advance to the NCAA tournament would mark an importance milestone in the Terrier's history and their place in the NCAA.\n2008-09 Season\nThe 08-09 season marked a turning point for Boston University and its ascension into the national rankings. Going 5-2-2 in the first month of play, the Terriers were ranked No. 5 in the USCHO.com national poll. This was the first season the Terriers were ranked nationally, indicating faith in the program's stability and talent. The season featured another foray into the postseason, where BU would advance into the Hockey East Semifinals, losing to Boston College 2-1. They closed out the season at 18-11-7 season, the fewest losses so far.\n2007-08 Season\nNow an established team in Hockey East, the Terriers vied to prove themselves within the league. Unfortunately, the 07-08 season was off to a rough start, as they went 0-4-2 in the first month of play. The season featured the first matchups between the Terriers and the Western Collegiate Hockey Association, the reigning champions of the NCAA Tournament. In an aggressive game, the Terriers tied the University of North Dakota 2-2. The Terriers would go on to win the WCHA customary shootout. In the following game, the Terriers dropped a 4-2 decision to the University of Minnesota, marking the beginning of the rivalry between BU and Minnesota. The Terriers would get another shot at the Beanpot Championship, but lost at home to Harvard, 3-1. 07-08 saw the Terrier's first postseason appearance in the Hockey East Semifinals. BU was shut out by the University of New Hampshire 8-0 to end their season at 15-17-3.\n2006-07 Season\nThe Terrier's second varsity season opened with a bang, going 7-1-0 in the first month of play. They got their first taste of the Beanpot Championship on Feb. 13, 2007 but lost 6-1 to host Boston College. They closed out their season at 19-12-3.\n2005-06 Season\nBoston University Women's Ice Hockey played its inaugural game on Oct. 7, 2005, a 4-3 loss to Northeastern University. Caroline Boudreau scored the first goal in BU program history. In the same game, Gina Kearns scored the first shorthanded goal in Terriers history. The Terriers would go on to have a 12-17-4 record for their first season as a D-I hockey team.\nPre-2005-06 Season\nIn 1974-1975 BU Women's Ice Hockey began as a club team of commuter and on-campus girls. They played local New England Colleges and local women's hockey teams from the community. Dana Sennett was the first coach with assistance from the men's Championship hockey team. It was elevated to NCAA in 2005.\nCurrent roster.\n&lt;section end=roster /&gt;"

        "title": "Phillip Adams (American football)",
        "text": "Phillip Matthew Adams (July 20, 1988 – April 8, 2021) was an American football cornerback. He played college football for the South Carolina State Bulldogs and was drafted in the seventh round of the 2010 NFL draft by the San Francisco 49ers. He also played for the New England Patriots, Oakland Raiders, Seattle Seahawks, New York Jets, and Atlanta Falcons.\nOn April 7, 2021, Adams killed six people in Rock Hill, South Carolina. The next day, he shot and killed himself following a standoff with police. He was posthumously diagnosed as suffering from the brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy.\nEarly life.\nAdams was born on July 20, 1988, in Rock Hill, South Carolina. He attended Rock Hill High School, where he played football and basketball.\nCollege career.\nAdams attended South Carolina State University from 2006 to 2009. In his freshman year with the Bulldogs, Adams saw action as a backup and on special teams. He recorded 12 tackles and two interceptions, along with a 30-yard punt return. As a sophomore with the Bulldogs, he played in 11 games.\nAs a junior, Adams ranked sixth on the team (with 48 tackles) and led the team in interceptions (with five) and pass deflections (with nine). In his senior year, he was a First Team All-Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference selection after registering 48 tackles and three interceptions. That year, he also scored a touchdown on a pick six against Norfolk State.\nProfessional career.\nAdams was selected in the seventh round (224th overall) of the 2010 NFL Draft by the San Francisco 49ers. In week 16 against the St. Louis Rams on December 26, 2010, he broke his left ankle while blocking on the opening kickoff of the second half. The injury required Adams to have surgery, which included several screws being inserted into his leg. He was released by the 49ers on September 3, 2011.\nOn September 21, 2011, the New England Patriots signed Adams and Landon Cohen after season-ending injuries to Dan Koppen and Myron Pryor. He was waived on October 8, then re-signed on October 13 after Mike Wright went on injured reserve. On October 14, Adams was once again released to make room for Marcus Harrison, but was re-signed on October 18. On November 21, Adams recorded his first interception in the NFL. He was waived again on November 29. On December 20, 2011, Adams was signed by the Seattle Seahawks. He made only one appearance for the Seahawks in 2011. On August 31, 2012, the Seahawks cut Adams.\nOn September 1, 2012, Adams was signed by the Oakland Raiders. In 2012 for Oakland, Adams played in 15 of the Raiders' 16 games, with one interception (off of Peyton Manning) and 15 tackles. On December 28, 2012, he was placed on injured reserve. On March 12, 2013, he re-signed with the Raiders as a restricted free agent. Adams appeared in all 16 games for the Raiders in 2013, with 30 tackles and a fumble recovery on the year. In his time with the Raiders, he suffered two concussions over three games.\nAdams signed with the Seahawks again on March 27, 2014. On August 30, 2014, he was released after continued struggles in training camp. He was claimed off waivers by the New York Jets on September 1, 2014. In 2014 for the Jets, Adams had one interception and 24 tackles in 12 games for the team. Adams was signed by the Atlanta Falcons on March 12, 2015. He played in 13 games for the Falcons in 2015, with one interception and 38 tackles. On April 5, 2016, Adams had a workout with the Kansas City Chiefs, but he did not return to the NFL. During training camp in 2016, the Indianapolis Colts called and asked Adams to participate in practice the following day, but Adams missed his flight. According to his former agent, \"He made it to the Charlotte airport, but the flight had left already. I could tell his head was not in it. He'd given up on it.\"\nShooting and death.\nOn April 7, 2021, Adams shot six people at a house in Rock Hill, South Carolina, killing five and fatally injuring a sixth who died on April 10. During a standoff with the police the next day, on April 8, Adams fatally shot himself, according to the York County Sheriff's Office. He was 32. Police said Adams' mother was inside the home during the standoff, but was \"safely removed\" before Adams killed himself. According to a neighbor, police used a loudspeaker and sent a robot into the house in a failed attempt to coax him out.\nAdams had no prior criminal record. His father, Alonzo, suggested that his football career may have played a role in the shooting, stating that the sport \"messed him up\". An autopsy revealed that Adams suffered from an \"unusually severe\" case of the brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy. He was one of at least 345 NFL players to be diagnosed after death with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which is caused by repeated hits to the head."

They entered the 2011 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament as the overall #1 seed. They defeated Texas–San Antonio in the second round and George Mason in the third round to advance to the \"Sweet Sixteen\" where they were upset by Kentucky to finish the season 34–3.\nPre-season.\nDepartures.\nThe Ohio State Buckeyes lost a key player in Evan Turner in the 2010 NBA draft. Turner left Ohio State after completing his junior season leading OSU to a 29–8 record and a trip to the Sweet Sixteen in the NCAA tournament. Turner was selected second overall to the Philadelphia 76ers only behind former Kentucky Wildcat John Wall. Other senior departs are noted below.\n2010–2011 Schedule.\n!colspan=9 style=| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=| Big Ten tournament\n!colspan=9 style=| NCAA tournament\nGame Notes – NCAA tournament.\nSecond Round: UT–San Antonio.\nOhio State began the 2011 NCAA tournament bid with a commanding 75–46 win of the University of Texas-San Antonio Roadrunners. The Buckeyes were contested early however took control of the game halfway through the first half. Leading 37–21 at halftime, the Buckeyes opened their lead and moved on to the third round of the tournament where they faced the George Mason Patriots.\nThird round: George Mason.\nThe third round showcased a match up between the #1 Ohio State Buckeyes and #8 George Mason Patriots. George Mason opened the game on an 11–2 run and quickly took the momentum. However, the overall seed in Ohio State would not back down. Led by senior David Lighty and Jon Diebler, the Buckeyes quickly went on a run to end the first half of play with a 52–26 lead. The pounding by the Buckeyes continued as they worked the ball around to their star freshmen in Jared Sullinger and Aaron Craft. Ending the game as they had in the first half, Ohio State continued to cruise through and went on to win the game 98–66 in front of biased crowd in Cleveland, Ohio.\nRegional semifinal: Kentucky.\nThe Buckeyes reached the Sweet Sixteen for the second year in a row and for the second year they faced an SEC opponent. Ohio State and Kentucky both began the game struggling to shoot and to get any sort of momentum going with both teams tied at 30 heading into the second half. The second half remained an extremely close affair with neither team really able to pull away. In the final second of the game Kentucky was able to put together a game winning shot and put the Wildcats ahead 62–60, which would be the final score in the game. This loss ended the season for the Buckeyes, and for the second year in a row, Ohio State fell in the Sweet Sixteen."

He was formerly the managing editor and a senior writer for FanGraphs, an analyst for the San Diego Padres, and owner-operator of USS Mariner.\nBiography.\nCameron grew up in Seattle, attending Christian Faith High School in Des Moines, WA from 1995 to 1999. In high school he developed a strong interest in baseball, discovering the alt.sports.baseball.sea-mariners newsgroup, reading Rob Neyer and playing the sport. Cameron, a varsity catcher, made the state's all-star team his senior year when he led the league in walks. After high school he attended the University of North Carolina at Greensboro where he received his degree in economics.\nIn 1999 he began writing for Baseball Prospectus then, three years later, in 2002 he created U.S.S. Mariner with Derek Zumsteg and Jason Barker. The website was named after \"the U.S.S. Mariner,\" a ship in the US Navy that would \"fire its cannon after Mariner home runs and wins back in the 1980s\". In 2008, he also acted for a while as ESPN commentator. In March 2009 Cameron began writing for the Wall Street Journal then in April of the following year, Cameron became the full-time managing editor and operator of FanGraphs.\nOn July 25, 2011, Cameron announced that he has been diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia. Treatment was successful and in December of that year he announced that he was joining the Baseball Writers' Association of America: \"When I started writing about baseball [...] I never imagined it would turn into a career or that I'd ever be considered an Official Baseball Writer. The world is full of interesting twists and turns, though, and I'm happy to be able to walk through this newest open door.\"\nGrandfather's murder.\nCameron's maternal grandfather was murdered when his mother was 19, at the family home in Baltimore. There is currently a documentary being made about the killing and how it shaped the lives of Cameron's 13 aunts and uncles.\nAn Open Letter.\nOn June 27, 2007 Cameron wrote a post \"An Open Letter To Rafael Chaves\" asking Rafael Chaves, the pitching coach, to make Mariners' pitcher Felix Hernandez throw fewer fastballs: \"Take over control of the pitch selection to start the game. Make Felix throw a change-up or a curve ball to the first batter. Throw a first pitch slider in the first inning.\". This letter eventually was passed along by a fan to Chaves, who had previously been attempting to make the same point to Hernandez and used the letter as reinforcement. Hernandez changed his pitching approach the next game saying: \"On the internet, they say when I throw a lot of fastballs in the first inning, they score a lot of runs. I tried to mix all my pitches in the first inning.\"\nSan Diego Padres.\nOn January 10, 2018 it was reported Cameron would join the San Diego Padres. His role would be senior analyst in the organization's research and development department. Cameron left the Padres organization following the 2021 season.\nSeattle Mariners.\nAfter leaving the Padres, Cameron took a consulting job with the Mariners.

He is the school's only winner of that award.\nThe Rawls Course.\nThe Rawls Course, home of the Red Raiders golf teams, is located on the Texas Tech campus. Alumnus Jerry S. Rawls donated $8.6 million toward the total cost of approximately $15 million course. Completed in September 2003, the course features an 18-hole course, driving range, pitching and chipping areas and an indoor facility containing three hitting bays. The Rawls Course was designed by Tom Doak of Renaissance Golf Design, Inc., Traverse City, Michigan. Starting from just a cotton field, the course was created to imitate the land east and south of Lubbock, where the Great Plains suddenly begin falling into the valleys and canyons that lead to the Caprock region. Lubbock's strong prevailing winds figured prominently in the course's final design. Both \"Golf Week\" and \"Turfnet\" magazines ranked The Rawls Course as the third best collegiate course in the United States. \"Golf Magazine\" ranked it as the second most affordable U.S. course and placed it twenty-third on their list of top 50 golf courses in the nation for $50 or less."

        "text": "The Murray State Racers men's basketball program represents Murray State University in intercollegiate men's basketball. Murray State is a member of the Missouri Valley Conference in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), having joined that conference in 2022 after 74 seasons in the Ohio Valley Conference. The Racers have played home games at the CFSB Center on their campus in Murray, Kentucky since 1998. Murray State made its 18th appearance in the NCAA tournament in 2022. Five times the Racers advanced in the tournament, most recently by defeating the University of San Francisco in 2022. In 1988, Murray State defeated NC State in the first round but lost to eventual national champion Kansas in the second round. In 2010, 22 years to the date of the 1988 win, the Racers beat Vanderbilt and lost to eventual runner-up Butler in the second round.\nVenues.\nMurray State's first basketball venues were Wilson Hall (1926–27); Lovett Auditorium (1927–1937), which had a capacity of 1,500; and Carr Health Building (1937–1954), which had a capacity of 3,000. Racer Arena opened in 1954 and entertained Racer fans for 43 years. While its capacity was 5,500, over 6,000 people crowded the arena on numerous occasions. Racer Arena is now a volleyball-only facility, one of the largest in NCAA Division I.\nReplacing Racer Arena was the CFSB Center, the current home of Murray State men's basketball. Completed in June 1998 at a cost of $20 million, the facility is a modern arena which can host other events besides basketball. The CFSB Center sits 8,602 and includes a $250,000 scoreboard and a 2,000 sq. ft. weight room. The first basketball game at the CFSB Center was against Southern Illinois on November 14, 1998, a 65–62 victory for the Racers in front of 7,633 spectators. It was formerly known as the Regional Special Events Center, or \"RSEC\", until the name was changed on September 17, 2010, after Community Financial Services Bank donated $3.3 million to Murray State, at the time the largest donation in athletic history.\nHistory.\nIn 2005, \"Street &amp; Smith's\" named the Racers the 52nd best program of all time. In their prestige system, ESPN ranked Murray State the 30th best programs from 1984 to 2008, breaking a tie with Villanova due to a higher winning percentage. The Racers are the highest \"true\" mid-major team in their rankings.\nCutchin era (1925–1941).\nCarlisle Cutchin launched the Murray State basketball program in 1925. At the time, Murray State was a teacher's college and the nickname was the Thoroughbreds. In the 1935–36 season, Cutchin coached Murray State to its highest win percentage for a season at .920, when his Thoroughbreds finished with a record of 23–2. That season also included Murray State's best start, at 19–1. In his final season, he led the Thoroughbreds to the title game of the 1941 NAIA Division I men's basketball tournament, at which time they lost to the San Diego State Aztecs 36–34. Since he retired in 1941, he has maintained his position as the all-time winningest coach in Murray State basketball history, with a career record of 267–101.\nMountjoy era (1941–1942).\nRice Mountjoy was hired as the next men's basketball coach from Danville High School, where he was athletic director. In his only season with the Thoroughbreds, he coached the team to an 18–4 record. That season was marked by strong play from early jump shot proponent Joe Fulks, who transferred from Millsaps College. Mountjoy left after the 1941–42 season to coach Augusta Tilghman High School in nearby Paducah.\nMiller era (1942–1948).\nFormer Murray State basketball player and then-freshman team coach John Miller replaced Mountjoy as head basketball coach. His best season was his first, when he led the team to a 21–5 record and finished fourth in the 1941 NAIA Division I men's basketball tournament.\nHodges era (1948–1954).\nFrom Southern Illinois, Harlan Hodges led the team to two NAIA Tournaments and two No. 16 AP rankings in his six seasons, with a 109–66 () record. Bennie Purcell and Garrett Beshear were on the roster during those years and were later named NAIA All-Americans. Hodges left Murray in May 1954 for the University of Idaho in the Pacific Coast Conference, where success largely eluded him. He resigned after five seasons in 1959 to become the superintendent of schools in Anna, Illinois, then returned to Murray in 1964 to teach.\nAlexander era (1954–1958).\nRex Alexander was promoted from assistant to head coach after former North Carolina head coach Tom Scott accepted, then turned down the head coaching post at Murray State. Alexander led Murray State for four seasons, posting a 45–54 record, including a 15–10 mark in 1955–56. But after his first team was Ohio Valley Conference regular-season and tournament runners-up, his teams never finished higher than third in the conference and he was replaced by DePauw University head coach Cal Luther on March 5, 1958. Alexander agreed to stay on as an assistant coach under Luther.\nLuther era (1959–1974).\nIn 1958, Murray State hired Cal Luther, who had served the previous four seasons as head coach at DePauw. In 16 seasons under Luther, Murray State won three OVC regular-season championships and made the NCAA tournament in 1964 and 1969. His 1970–71 team reached No. 17 in the Associated Press poll, entering the rankings after a thrilling 73–71 victory over Western Kentucky in Murray. WKU would go on to reach the NCAA tournament Final Four that season. A two-time OVC Coach of the Year, Luther led the Racers to a 241–134 record.\nLuther's most notable players were future professional players Dick Cunningham, Claude Virden and Stewart Johnson, as well as Racer greats Herb McPherson, Jim Jennings and Les Taylor.\nCal Luther was a firebrand of a coach. The standing joke at the university was the over and under of Cal throwing off his jacket during a game due to a call by a ref, or from frustration with a player. The latter part of his tenure was marred by an OVC issue with testing and which tests the schools in the OVC used to qualify athletes. During the 1973–74 season several players were disqualified for using an illegal testing equivalency. This happened across the OVC, and Murray was not the only school to lose student athletes. Most of the disqualified athletes were allowed to transfer by the NCAA to other schools, but OVC schools lost the services of those athletes who had not actually taken the SAT, but had taken the ACT.\nOverton era (1975–1978).\nAfter three seasons as an assistant under Cal Luther, Fred Overton was elevated to head coach in 1975. After a 9–17 first season, the Racers started the 1976–77 season with a 17–6 record before dropping their last four games for a 17–10 final ledger, finishing second in the OVC. But after the Racers posted an 8–17 in 1977–78, Overton was fired.\nGreene era (1978–1985).\nRon Greene returned to his alma mater fresh off earning the AP Southeastern Conference Coach of the Year award at Mississippi State in 1978.\nAfter managing only four wins in his first season as coach at Murray, Greene led the Racers to 23 wins the following year and an appearance in the National Invitation Tournament. The Racers knocked off Jacksonville and Alabama before losing to Illinois 65–63 in the quarterfinals, all on the road. Greene's Racers would win three Ohio Valley Conference regular-season titles and reach the NIT twice more under his guidance.\nA highlight of the 1981–82 season came when Murray State traveled to South Bend, Indiana, to play against Notre Dame. Murray State defeated a Notre Dame team coached by Digger Phelps 56–54.\nHis overall record at Murray State was 119–78. While at the Racer helm, Greene coached Racer greats Gary Hooker and Lamont Sleets.\nNewton era (1985–1991).\nIn Steve Newton's second season, in 1986–87 the team finished with a 13–15 record. This marked the last time the Racers had a losing season for the next 29 seasons; only Arizona, Kansas, and Syracuse hold longer streaks.\nIn addition to Murray's win in 1988, two years later the No. 16 seed Racers took No. 1 seed Michigan State into overtime before falling 75–71. The loss in 1990 was the closest a 16 seeded team had ever come to knocking off a No. 1 seeded team in the tournament. While a 16 seeded Princeton team and a 16 seeded East Tennessee State team both fell by just 1 point during regulation in the 1989 tournament, the 1990 Murray State team was the only 16 seed ever to take a game into overtime. In 1997, the No. 15 seed Racers nearly shocked the No. 2 seed Duke Blue Devils in a 71–68 loss.\nIn 1988, Jeff Martin became the first basketball player in Murray State, and OVC, history to be invited to the Olympic trials for the US Basketball Team. This was the last year that professionals were not allowed on the team. Martin did not make the team but impressed many with his performance.\nThe best-known player in the Newton era is Popeye Jones. While at Murray State, Jones scored 2,057 points which still ranks fourth all time for the Racers. He is also Murray State's all-time leader in rebounds with 1,374, and led the nation in that category in the 1990–91 season. Jones is the only player in MSU history to record more than 2,000 points and 1,000 rebounds. Jones helped lead the Racers to OVC championships in 1991 and 1992. He went on to have a successful career in the NBA after being drafted in the second round by the Houston Rockets in the 1992 NBA Draft.\nEdgar era (1992–1995).\nScott Edgar was hired as head basketball coach after serving six seasons as an assistant coach under Nolan Richardson at Arkansas. Bringing a version of Richardson's uptempo \"40 Minutes of Hell\" philosophy to Murray, Edgar led the Racers to two NCAA tournament appearances (1992, 1995) and one NIT appearance (1994) in four seasons. His teams won three OVC regular-season championships (1992, 1994 and 1995), posting a 48–14 record in conference games during his tenure.\nEdgar recruited Racer greats Marcus Brown and Vincent Rainey to Murray State, with Brown averaging 22.4 points and Rainey 18.8 points in Edgar's final season at Murray.\nEdgar left Murray State after the 1994–95 season to become head coach at Duquesne.\nGottfried era (1995–1998).\nMark Gottfried was hired as head basketball coach after serving seven seasons as an assistant coach under Jim Harrick at UCLA. Gottfried was hired shortly after he finished the 1995 season with the Bruins, in which he helped lead the Bruins to an NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship. Mark Gottfried was also the nephew of ESPN analyst and former Murray State football coach Mike Gottfried.\nIn Gottfried's first season, the Racers returned four starters, including Marcus Brown, from the Racer team that nearly upset North Carolina in the 1995 NCAA tournament, and the team was picked to finished first in the OVC. The Racers won the Ohio Valley Conference regular season championship in 1996 for the third straight season; however, the Racers were defeated in the OVC tournament. In the final game of the tournament, Murray State's Vincent Rainey was charged with a foul with two-tenths of a second left on the clock in a tie game against the rival Austin Peay Governors. APSU's Reggie Crenshaw made two free throws and the Racers lost the game 70–68. As a result of the loss, the Racers did not reach the 1996 NCAA tournament. The Racers lost to the Missouri Tigers in the opening round of the 1996 National Invitational Tournament, and finished the season 19–10. Marcus Brown finished his college playing career at the close of the 1996 season with 2,236 career points, which is third best in Murray State history.\nWith a November 23, 1996, victory over the Belmont Bruins, the Racers began a 47-game home winning streak that would last into the 1999–2000 season. The Racers won the 1997 OVC Tournament with an overtime win over Austin Peay and earned a spot in the NCAA tournament.\nESPN's College Basketball Encyclopedia names the Racers 1997–98 season as having the best team in school history. OVC player of the year De'Teri Mayes led the 1997–98 team to 23 victories by double digit margins. Isaac Spencer was a freshman on the team. Spencer would go on to score 2,248 points over four seasons, which places him second place all time for the Racers. The Racers won both the OVC regular season and OVC tournament again in 1998; however, Murray State fell to number eight seed Rhode Island in the first round of the NCAA tournament. The Racers finished the season a number 25 ranking in the final AP Poll. Mark Gottfried won three Ohio Valley Conference Championships in each of his three seasons, the only OVC coach to accomplish such a mark.\nGottfried was hired by Alabama to be head basketball coach in March 1998. He had been a starting player for the Crimson Tide for three seasons between 1985 and 1987.\nAnderson era (1998–2003).\nTevester Anderson was promoted to head coach of the Racers in March, 1998 after Mark Gottfried left Murray State to take the head coach position at the University of Alabama. Anderson, the first African American to serve as head coach of the Murray State men's basketball team, had previously served as an assistant coach under Gottfried during the previous three seasons. At age 61, Anderson was also the oldest rookie head coach in NCAA Division I basketball. In his first year as coach of the Racers, Anderson led the team to a 27–6 record, an Ohio Valley Conference championship, and an NCAA tournament appearance. Anderson was named the OVC's Co-Coach of the Year and was named NABC District 7 Coach of the Year following the 1998–99 season.\nIn Anderson's second year as head coach, the Racers finished the 1999–2000 season with a 23–9 record. The record was good enough to capture a share of the OVC regular season championship, but the Racer's failed to win the OVC Tournament and earn a spot in the NCAA tournament. Murray State home court winning streak, the longest in the nation, also came to an end in 2000 with a January 15 loss to Southeast Missouri State University.\nOver the next three years under Anderson, the success of the Racer basketball program steadily declined, culminating in a low point during the 2002–03 season. The Racers finished the 2002–03 season with a 17–12 record, which was fourth-place in the OVC standings. The fourth-place finish was the worst finish in the OVC standings since the 1986–87 season. Amid rumors that Anderson would relinquish his coaching duties at Murray State under pressure from university officials, he resigned from the head coach position in March 2003. Anderson was named as the new head coach at Jackson State University in April 2003.\nCronin era (2003–2006).\nPreviously an assistant at Cincinnati (1997–2001) under Bob Huggins and at Louisville (2001–03) under Rick Pitino, Mick Cronin was introduced as the new head coach of the Racers on April 5, 2003. When he accepted the position, Cronin became the fourth youngest head coach in NCAA Division-I basketball. In Cronin's first season as head coach, the Racers won the OVC tournament and advanced to the first round of the NCAA tournament where the Racers fell to No. 5 seeded Illinois. The success of the 2003–04 season was also tainted by arrests and suspensions. Just before the start of the 2004 NCAA tournament, juniors Adam Chiles and Kelvin Brown were arrested on drug charges. Chiles was charged with hindering prosecution and possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia, and Brown was charged with theft from an alleged gas drive-off, possession of marijuana, and his second offense of possession of drug paraphernalia. Both were arrested following a 911 hangup call from their apartment in which Chiles was found outside and Brown was found hiding in a closet. Chiles was cleared to play in the tournament, but Brown was suspended indefinitely and later dismissed from the team in April.\nProblems continued for the Racers in the 2004–05 season. The team's only returning starter, Adam Chiles, was dismissed from the team in November following his second arrest of 2004. Chiles was stopped by Kentucky State Police while driving on Western Kentucky Parkway near Leitchfield, Kentucky. Chiles was charged with driving under the influence, possession of marijuana, possession of an open alcoholic beverage container, and speeding. Chiles had averaged 10.1 points and 3.9 assists for the Racers in the previous season. The Racers went on to finish the 2004–05 season with a record of 20–10 and a first round loss in the OVC tournament.\nThe 2005–06 Racers rebounded from their struggles in the previous season to win both the OVC regular season title, their 1st since 2000, and the tournament title to return to the NCAA. In the 2006 tournament, junior guard Trey Pearson missed a critical 3-point shot in the final seconds of the first-round game against No. 3 seeded defending champion North Carolina. UNC was fouled on the rebound and went to the line to sink the game clinching shots to defeat the No. 14 seeded Racers 69–65. After the 2006 NCAA tournament Cronin took the reins of the Cincinnati Bearcats, his hometown team and alma mater.\nKennedy era (2006–2011).\nOn April 12, 2006, Southeastern Louisiana head coach Billy Kennedy was introduced as Murray State University's head men's basketball coach, succeeding the recently departed Cronin.\nAfter continuing to contend in the conference over his first few seasons, Kennedy's 2009–10 team finally broke through, winning the program's 21st OVC regular season title with a conference record of 17–1. They would then go on to defeat Morehead State to capture their 14th OVC tournament title, clinching a berth in the NCAA tournament.\nThe Racers won their first-round game in the 2010 NCAA tournament in dramatic fashion, defeating fourth-seeded Vanderbilt 66–65 on a buzzer-beating jump shot by senior Danero Thomas. This was the first time that any Ohio Valley Conference team had advanced to the 2nd round of the NCAA tournament since Middle Tennessee advanced in 1989.\nThe Racers followed up a regular season conference championship for the second year in a row in 2011. The Racers were eliminated from the OVC tournament in 2011; however, they earned a number six seed in the National Invitational Tournament where the Racers suffered a first round loss to Missouri State University. In May 2011, Billy Kennedy announced that he was leaving Murray State to accept the head coach position at Texas A&amp;M University.\nFirst Prohm era (2011–2015).\nSteve Prohm was introduced as the 15th head coach on May 23, 2011. Prohm was promoted to the head coach position after serving as an assistant coach under Billy Kennedy for the previous five seasons. The Racers won the 2011 Great Alaska Shootout early in the 2011–12 season and went on a 23-game winning streak to start the season. The team's 23–0 start under Prohm was the best start to a season in team history. The 23–0 start beat the previous best start record of 16–0 set by the 1935–36 men's basketball team under Carlisle Cutchin. The 23–0 start was the third-best start in NCAA Division I history for a first-year head coach, and it set OVC records for most wins to start a season and overall winning streak during a season\nThe 10th win of the 2011–12 season was a victory over the then No. 21-ranked Memphis Tigers. This was Murray State's first win over a ranked team since defeating Vanderbilt in the 2010 NCAA tournament. It was also Murray State's first win over a ranked team during the regular season since the Racers defeated No. 12 Arkansas in 1997. Following the victory over Memphis, the Racers entered the national polls at No. 24 on the AP Top 25 Poll on December 12, 2011. This marked the first time an OVC basketball team had been ranked in the major national polls since the Racers were last ranked at No. 25 in the final poll of the 1998 season. The No. 24 ranking also marked the team's highest ranking since February 1971, when the Racers were 17th. The No. 24-ranked Racers defeated the Lipscomb Bisons in the 11th game of the season. The victory was the first win for Murray State as a ranked team since a ranked Racer team defeated Tennessee Tech 72–69 on February 2, 1971. On January 2, 2012, Murray State moved into the No. 1 spot in the CollegeInsider.com Mid-Major Top 25 Poll. The Racers became the first OVC team to ever achieve the No. 1 ranking in the Mid-Major Top 25 Poll. Following Murray State's 16th win of the season, a January 7, 2012, victory over conference-rival Austin Peay, the Racers moved up to No. 14 in the USA Today/ESPN Coaches' Poll and No. 15 in the AP Poll. Their 17th win came against Jacksonville State at the CFSB center to put the Racers to 17–0, and their best start in school history. Their 18th win against Tennessee Tech, 82–74 on January 14, 2012, kept Murray one of only three Division I schools with an unbeaten season as of that date. The January 9 AP ranking was the highest ranking in the history of the Murray State men's basketball program. The No. 15 ranking was also the highest ranking for an OVC team since the Western Kentucky Hilltoppers were ranked No. 7 on March 16, 1971.\nOn February 9, 2012, Murray State hosted OVC-rival Tennessee State University as the No. 9 team in the nation and the lone unbeaten in Division I basketball. Murray State lost 72–68. Two days later, Murray State answered with a definitive win at home against rival Austin Peay 82–63, bringing its record to 24–1. This win was quickly followed by a win on the road at SEMO, 75–66, to clinch the Racers third consecutive Ohio Valley Conference regular-season championship.\nOn February 18, Murray State hosted St. Mary's College in a much-anticipated Bracketbuster event, and the last home game of the season. The game was not only a sellout, but the largest ever for attendance at the CFSB center: 8,825. This marked the first time two ranked teams played at the CFSB Center (Murray State No. 16 AP, No. 14 USA Today/ESPN; St. Mary's No. 21 AP, No. 16 USA Today/ESPN) and the first time a ranked Murray State team played another ranked team. The game also featured a national TV audience on ESPN with legendary announcers Dave O'Brien and Dick Vitale calling the action. Murray State never trailed in the game and defeated St. Mary's 65–51, improving its record to 26–1. As the historic 2011–12 season came to a close, the Murray State men's basketball program was the recipient of several high-profile awards. Coach Steve Prohm was named the Ohio Valley Conference Coach of the Year, which marked the third-consecutive year the award was presented to a Murray State head coach. Prohm also was recognized as the District-IV Coach of the Year by the United States Basketball Writers Association and District 19 Coach of the Year by the National Association of Basketball Coaches. Prohm also received two national coach of the year awards: the Basketball Times Coach of the Year Award and the Joe B. Hall National Coach of the Year Award. Junior point guard Isaiah Canaan was named OVC Player of the Year and Second Team All-America by the Associated Press, as well as selected to the John R. Wooden All-American team, Lute Olson All-America team, NABC All-America Third Team, and Sporting News All-America First Team. Canaan was a finalist for the John R. Wooden Award, Bob Cousy Award, Oscar Robertson Trophy, Lou Henson Award and to the Naismith College Player of the Year Midseason watch list.\nOn June 8, 2015, Prohm was announced as the new head coach at Iowa State. The Iowa State job had become open when Fred Hoiberg left to become head coach of the Chicago Bulls.\nMcMahon era (2015–2022).\nOn June 10, 2015, Matt McMahon was hired as head coach of Murray State. McMahon served as an assistant under Prohm and had just left the school to serve as an assistant to Eric Konkol at Louisiana Tech on May 27, 2015, before Prohm left for Iowa State. \"I am so excited to know that Coach McMahon will be returning to Murray State to lead the Racers,\" Murray State athletic director Allen Ward said. \"After watching him for four years, I'm convinced he's the right man for the job. He's an outstanding coach, nationally recognized as one of the top assistants in the country, with a tremendous upside. Matt has the talent and integrity to continue the momentum we've built, put his own stamp on the program, and meet the expectations that come with being the head coach at Murray State.\"\nIn his first season as head coach, the Racers finished the season 17–14, 10–6 in OVC play to finish in a tie for the West Division title. They lost in the quarterfinals of the OVC tournament. However, the following year, the team's record dipped as they finished 16–17, 8–8 in OVC play to finish in third place in the West Division and losing in the semifinals of the OVC tournament.\nMcMahon's third Racer team posted a 26–6, 16–2 record, winning the OVC regular season and tournament championships. They were received a 12 seed in the 2018 NCAA tournament, where they fell in the first round to West Virginia. After the season, he was named National Association of Basketball Coaches District 19 Coach of the Year.\nIn June 2018, Murray State awarded McMahon a contract extension through 2022.\nThe 2018–19 season saw the Racers win 15 of their first 17 games, with the only losses to Southeastern Conference opponents Alabama and eventual Final Four participant Auburn, both on the road. By then, the nation had been introduced to sophomore point guard Ja Morant, who scored 25 points against Auburn and 38 against Alabama. The Racers went on to post a 16–2 OVC record and won the conference tournament championship over Belmont, 77–65, in Evansville, Indiana, earning a bid to the NCAA tournament for the 17th time. There, the Racers earned a No. 12 seed and defeated Marquette of the Big East Conference, 83–64, in Hartford, Connecticut, on March 21 behind a triple-double from Morant (17 points, 11 rebounds, 16 assists). Two days later, Murray State fell to No. 4 seed Florida State of the Atlantic Coast Conference, 90–62, finishing the season with a 28–5 record. After the season, Morant was named a consensus First Team All-American after becoming the first player in NCAA history to average at least 20 points and 10 assists per game (24.5 ppg, 10 apg).\nThe 2019–20 season saw the Racers go 22–8 in the regular season and finish tied with Belmont atop the OVC standings with a record of 15–3. Murray State earned a share of its third straight regular season OVC Championship, while Belmont earned the No. 1 seed due to a tie-breaker (having a better record against EIU than the Racers did). Sophomores Tevin Brown and KJ Williams were named to the All-OVC First Team prior to entering the 2020 OVC Tournament. The Racers and Belmont squared off in the OVC Championship finale for the third time in the last three years. Murray State won the previous two years but fell this season, 76–75. There was no postseason play forthcoming for the Racers—or anyone else in college basketball—due to the shutdown of spectator sports due to the COVID-19 pandemic that engulfed the world in 2020.\nThe Racers' final OVC season in 2021–22 saw the Racers go on an unprecedented run rarely seen in the program's history. Initially picked to finish 3rd in the conference, the Racers compiled a perfect 18–0 record in conference play, winning the regular season title for the 28th time in program history. During this stretch, the Racers would enter the Top 25 rankings for the first time since the 2014–15 season, reaching as high as No. 19. In addition, Brown would break the OVC record for most 3-point field goals made in a career. They would then go on to win both of their OVC tournament games; a dominant semi-final victory over SEMO and a back-and-forth thriller against defending tournament champion Morehead State in the championship game, to secure the program's 18th OVC tournament championship and an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. Individually, Brown and Williams were once again named to the All-OVC First Team, being joined by sophomore Justice Hill. Williams was named OVC Player of the Year, while Hill was named the OVC tournament's Most Valuable Player. McMahon himself was named the OVC Coach of the year for his efforts. Earning a No. 7 seed, they defeated San Francisco in the first round of the NCAA tournament before a surprise loss to Saint Peter's in the second round. Two days after Murray's exit from the NCAA tournament, McMahon left to take the head coaching opening at LSU.\nSecond Prohm era (2022–present).\nOn March 25, 2022, it was announced that Steve Prohm would return to the university as head coach. \"As we envisioned the ideal profile for the next Murray State Men's Basketball head coach, it remained abundantly clear a commitment to character, integrity, student-athlete development, community, family and competitive excellence were critically important,\" said Murray State Director of Athletics, Kevin Saal. \"Steve Prohm represents, reflects and personifies these, and many more, qualities. His skill set, experience and genuine love for Murray State will effectively guide our program as we begin our Missouri Valley Conference journey.\"\nSeason-by-season results.\nStarting from the 1987–88 season, the Racers had recorded a winning season for 29 straight years ending in the 2016–17 season. They have won 20 or more games in a season 32 times and three times have won 30 or more. For the first time in school history, the 2014–15 Racers went undefeated (16–0) in the OVC regular season. In their final OVC season in 2021–22, they posted an unprecedented 18–0 OVC regular-season record.\nMsVC – Mississippi Valley Conference \nKIAC – Kentucky Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (now known as River States Conference)\nSIAA – Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association \nNAIB – National Association for Intercollegiate Basketball\nNAIA – National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (Was the NAIB until 1952, when it started sponsoring other sports) \nNIT – National Invitation Tournament \nNCAA – National Collegiate Athletic Association \nCIT – CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament\nRankings.\nThe Racers have been nationally ranked in eight seasons in either the Associated Press (AP) Poll or the ESPN-USA Today (Coaches) Poll. They were first ranked during the 1950–51 season coached by Harlan Hodges. The Racers received their highest ranking, under coach Steve Prohm, during the 2011–12 season, ranking 9th in the AP Poll and 7th in the Coaches Poll.\nRivalries.\nWestern Kentucky University.\nMurray State's oldest basketball rivalry is with nearby Western Kentucky (WKU). The two teams became archrivals during their time together in the Ohio Valley Conference. Although the schools no longer share their conference affiliation (Western Kentucky joined the Sun Belt Conference in 1982 and Conference USA in 2014), the two schools keep the series alive every few years. The teams last played each other in 2014. They are set to renew their rivalry beginning in 2023 as part of a 4-game annual series. The two teams have met in basketball 147 times, with WKU leading the all-time series 95 to 56.\nAustin Peay State University (Battle of the Border).\nFor the rest of the Racers' OVC tenure, their primary in-conference rivalry was with Austin Peay State University, a school closer geographically than WKU. In February 2009, ESPN The Magazine highlighted the Austin Peay-Murray State rivalry. The men's basketball rivalry is part of the larger athletics rivalry between the two schools known as the Battle of the Border. While the schools no longer share their conference affiliation (both left the OVC in 2022, with Austin Peay joining the ASUN and Murray State joining the MVC), both teams have kept the series going. The two teams have met 135 times, with MSU leading the all-time series 90 to 45.\nBelmont University.\nRecently, the Racers have been building a rivalry with Belmont University since the Bruins' entry into the OVC in 2012. From that year until both teams' departure from the OVC in 2022, Belmont and Murray State combined to win every regular season championship, including two seasons (2018–19 and 2019–20) where they shared the title. In three consecutive years (from 2018 to 2020), the Racers and Bruins met in the OVC Tournament finals, with Murray State winning in 2018 and 2019. With Belmont joining the MVC alongside Murray State, the rivalry will continue in that conference. The Bruins currently lead the all-time series 13 to 12.\nMurray has two more built-in regional rivals in the MVC, with Southern Illinois about two hours' drive away and Evansville slightly farther away (and also located in a county whose residents pay Kentucky in-state tuition at Murray State).\nCoaches.\nThe Racers have had 17 different head coaches in their history. Carlisle Cutchin has the most wins in school history with 267. Steve Newton has won the most OVC Regular Season titles with four. Newton and Matt McMahon share the most OVC Tournament titles with three apiece. Eleven different coaches have received the OVC Coach of the Year award for a combined 17 times.\nPlayers.\nAll-Americans.\nThe Racers have had 14 All-Americans; the first in 1938 and the most recent in 2019.\nNBA draftees.\nThe Racers have had 25 players selected in the NBA draft, the first being Johnny Reagan by the Chicago Stags in 1948. Twice Murray State has had two players selected in the draft, in 1967 (Herb McPherson, San Diego [now Houston] Rockets, third round; Don Duncan, San Diego Rockets, 10th round) and 1971 (Hector Blondet, Portland Trail Blazers, fifth round; Ron Johnson, Baltimore Bullets [now Washington Wizards], ninth round). Here is a list of Racers picked in the draft that posted minutes in the NBA regular season:\nRetired numbers.\nThe Racers have retired 13 numbers, the first in 1952 and the last in 2023. The 13 retired numbers are the most of any NCAA Division I men's program, with Duke also having 13 retired numbers.\nScoring leaders.\nThe Racers have had six players score over 2,000 points and 41 players score over 1,000 points during their careers. Marcus Brown holds the record for the most points in a single game with 45 against Washington (Mo.) on December 16, 1995. Jeff Martin holds the record for the most points in a single season with 806 during the 1987–88 season.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament.\nThe Racers have appeared in 18 NCAA tournaments. They received their highest ranking in the tournament in 2012 with a 6th seed. They have an overall 5–18 record in tournament games. Popeye Jones holds the single game scoring record with 37 points against Michigan State in 1990.\nNational Invitation tournament.\nIn eight National Invitation Tournament (NIT) appearances, the Racers are 4–8 overall in tournament games.\nCollegeInsider.com Postseason tournament.\nThe Racers appeared in the 2014 CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament (CIT). They posted a 5–0 record to be 2014 CIT champions.\nNAIA tournament.\nThe Racers appeared in the NAIA tournament seven times. Their combined record is 16–8."

        "title": "John Tidwell (basketball)",
        "text": "John W. Tidwell is a retired American basketball player and medical doctor. He played for the University of Michigan from 1958 to 1961 and broke the school's records for points scored in a single game and single season. He later became an obstetrician-gynecologist in Charlotte, North Carolina.\nBiography.\nEarly years.\nTidwell grew up in Herrin in southern Illinois. He played basketball for Herrin High School from 1955 to 1957, leading the school to a 28–3 record as a junior and 31–2 as a senior. In 1957, the 6 feet, 4 inch Tidwell was the tallest player and the high scorer for the Herrin High School team that won the Illinois state basketball championship. Herrin defeated Elgin in the quarter-finals, Quincy Notre Dame in the semi-finals, and Collinsville in the championship game. The 1957 state championship was considered a great feat because Herrin was a relatively small city, and Illinois had only one class in basketball. Tidwell was also selected as a first-team forward on the 1957 Illinois All-State basketball team.\nMichigan.\nTidwell was one of the most highly rated high school basketball players in the Midwest in 1957. He reportedly received scholarships from 70 colleges, including the University of Illinois and University of Michigan. Michigan's head coach Bill Perigo did not travel to Herrin to recruit Tidwell, but Tidwell chose Michigan because of its good engineering school.\nHe played college basketball for the University of Michigan from 1958–1961. Tidwell managed to excel in basketball game despite what the \"Chicago Daily Tribune\" described as \"the handicap of a short and twisted left arm.\" Tidwell sustained the injury while playing quarterback for the freshman football team while in high school in 1953. He dislocated his left elbow when his arm was pinned behind his back on being tackled. He had a pin placed in his elbow. Tidwell later recalled how the injury had affected his jump shot:\"I never could get full range of motion back. ... When taking a right-handed jump shot, it was unorthodox. It was an unusual shot, because I couldn't straighten my left arm. I ended up shooting it from lesser height, bending my right arm more to compensate for my left arm. The right elbow was out. It was a different shot. But I shot it effectively.\"\nAs a sophomore, Tidwell made a name for himself in his first varsity basketball game for Michigan. Tidwell was matched up against University of Pittsburgh All-American Don Hennon and scored 22 points in his debut. He followed with 24 points in his second collegiate game against the University of Tennessee and another 24 points the following week against Butler. He also led the Wolverines with 22 points in a 93–68 win over the University of Detroit in the Motor City Classic. His play helped lead Michigan to a 6–1 start in 1958, and he was credited with having \"created an upsurge of interest in basketball at Michigan.\" After his first seven games, sports writer Jerry Green called Tidwell \"the most exciting cager to arrive at Michigan in years.\" Green noted that Tidwell \"floats quietly around the court, shooting sure-handedly, making deft passes, piling up points.\" In December 1958, the \"Chicago Daily Tribune\" reported, \"One of the big ones from Illinois got away last year -- and turned up on the Ann Arbor campus of the University of Michigan.\" Michigan's coach Perigo noted, \"He's so smooth and steady out there you don't notice him until he comes out.\"\nAs a junior during the 1959–1960 academic year, Tidwell broke the Michigan record for single game scoring record on February 27, 1960, as he hit 17 of 25 field goals and seven of ten free throws for 41 points in a 72–65 win against Michigan State. Tidwell's 41 points also broke the Yost Field House record which had been set by Indiana's Don Schlundt with 29 points in 1953. Tidwell also broke the season scoring record as a junior with 520 points—an average of 21.6 points per game. At the end of the 1959–1960 basketball season, Tidwell was selected as the team's most valuable player and elected captain of the 1960–1961 team.\nAs the senior captain of the 1960–1961 Michigan basketball team, Tidwell suffered a mid-season slump in February 1961, but still finished the season with 441 points and an average 19.2 points per game. On March 4, 1961, he broke his own single game scoring record with 43 points against the University of Minnesota. Two days later, on March 6, 1961, Tidwell scored 24 points against Illinois in his final home game for Michigan. When he left the game, he was given a three-minute standing ovation by the spectators at Yost Field House. At the end of the season, he was selected by his teammates as the team's most valuable player for the second consecutive year.\nDuring his three years playing for the Wolverines, Tidwell scored 1,386 points.

        "text": "\"Everywhere You Go\" is the MTN theme song for the 2010 FIFA World Cup performed by an all-star supergroup of international artists called Rhythm of Africa United. The song is led by US-American singer Kelly Rowland and features many male African artists and Rola Saad, a Lebanese female singer.\nAmerican producer Steve Morales produced and American songwriter Stacy Barthe wrote the song. Both have been collaborating on a Heidi Montag album before.\nThe song was confirmed by Antos Stella of \"AS Entertainment\" in a press release published on April 1, 2010:\n\"Kelly Rowland is a hot international artist with crossover appeal spanning all communities, and we were ecstatic when she jumped at the opportunity to be part of this powerful anthem. With the arrival of Africa's first FIFA World Cup it was important that we attracted the cream of the continent's musical talent as well as a world-famous headline act to collaborate on this song\".\n\"Everywhere You Go\" made its premiere on radio stations across Africa on April 12, 2010 and will be available to purchase at the end of May 2010. A portion of all proceeds will go to \"United Against Malaria\" &amp; \"1Goal\" initiatives.\nProduction.\nThe idea was conceived by Antos Stella of AS Entertainment: \"I'd always wanted to do a song featuring Africa's top artists,\" she said. \"I'd covered the whole of Africa and realised hip hop is happening on this continent. But I wanted to do a track with artists who use traditional African elements in hip hop.\"\nEnter MTN, which was looking for an official song for their World Cup campaign. This resulted in big-time producer Steve Morales getting involved and when Kelly heard the track she was sold!\n\"I got word through my management team and when I heard it, I knew it would be great to be involved.This song is about coming together and doing something new and cool. There is no song quite like this.\"\nRemixes.\nUgandan rapper Jose Chameleone provided additional vocals to a remixed version, produced by Ugandan producer Beni Okwenje a.k.a. \"Global\". The remix production is on a number of the other country versions.\nLive performance.\nAll artists except for Kelly Rowland (who was touring in Australia at that time (Supafest)) premiered the song live at the 16th annual South African Music Awards in Sun City, South Africa on 17 April 2010. The show was televised live on SABC1.\nFour days later the second live performance took place in the town of Newtown, South Africa during an exclusive \"invite only\" concert for a crowd which included business people and celebrities. This performance featured all artists including Kelly Rowland, who came to South Africa for a promotional visit. The song was also performed at the closing ceremony of the FIFA World Cup 2010 without Rowland's presence, due to her commitments in the United States.\nMusic video.\nKelly Rowland, Jozi and Samini shot their parts for the musicvideo on 21 April 2010 in Johannesburg in front of a green screen. The video was directed by Andrew Wessels and designed and animated by Nicework. According to Antos Stella the concept of the video is as follows: \"We want to reflect what is happening in urban Africa. I am hoping that this video will be relevant in five years' time. It's not just part of the World Cup. Our audience is the MTV market, first in Africa and then in the rest of Europe.\"\nThe artists were dressed by Baby Phat and Phat Farm South Africa. The video premiered on June 13 on the Pan-African music channel Channel O as well as during the first 2010 FIFA World Cup game on South African national television."

        "text": "Michael J. Stock (born September 29, 1939) is a former American football player and coach. He coached for 26 years at the collegiate level, 17 years in the National Football League (NFL), one year in the United States Football League (USFL), and one year coaching high school football in Ohio; altogether he coached 14 different teams. His career included four and a half seasons, from 1978 to 1982, as the head football coach at Eastern Michigan University, where he coached the Eastern Michigan Hurons through most of a school-record 27-game losing streak.\nCollege athlete.\nStock played fullback at Northwestern University under coach Ara Parseghian. From 1959 to 1960 he led the Northwestern Wildcats in rushing. Stock won Kodak and UPI All American honors in 1960, as well as All-Big Ten Conference honors in 1959 and 1960. He was co-captain of Northwestern's 1959 and 1960 football teams. Stock also played catcher for Northwestern's baseball team and earned All-Big Ten honors in 1959.\nCollege assistant.\nFollowing his graduation, Stock served as freshman coach at Northwestern in 1961 before serving in the United States Army. After leaving the army, he worked for one year as an assistant coach at South High School in Akron, Ohio. In 1966 and 1967 he coached the freshman team at the University at Buffalo, before working as wide receivers and running backs coach at the United States Naval Academy the following year.\nFrom 1969 through 1974, Stock rejoined Ara Parseghian at Notre Dame, first as freshman coach and subsequently as wide receivers coach. During his time there the team won the 1971 Cotton Bowl Classic against Texas, and went undefeated to win a national championship in 1973, and the team posted a record of 55–10–1. From 1975 through 1977 he coached under John Jardine at Wisconsin, first as running backs coach, and then as offensive coordinator.\nEastern Michigan.\nStock's tenure as head coach of the Eastern Michigan Eagles football team is primarily remembered for his role in a school-record 27-game losing streak from 1980 through 1982, including a winless season in 1981. He was fired after the team lost the first three games of 1982, including a 49–12 pasting at Louisiana Tech and 35–0 shutout at Miami, bringing the losing streak to 22 games; the team went on to lose five more consecutive games under interim coach Bob LaPointe before the streak was broken with a 9–7 win over Kent State on November 6, 1982. Stock's teams were held scoreless seven times, only won three Mid-American Conference games, were outscored by a total of 809 points — nearly 18 points per game, and his final record of 6–38–1 gives him a .144 winning percentage, easily the lowest of any coach to remain at Eastern more than one season.\nAssistant coach.\nAfter leaving Eastern Michigan, Stock returned to working as an assistant coach. In 1983, he coached offensive backfield for the New Jersey Generals of the United States Football League (USFL), mentoring running back Herschel Walker. He then returned to Notre Dame, where he coached wide receivers and running backs through 1986. From 1987 through 1991 he coached special teams, then wide receivers, and finally tight ends for the Cincinnati Bengals of the National Football League (NFL. From 1992 through 1994 he coached wide receivers at Ohio State University. He then returned to the NFL, where from 1995 through 2000, he was the special teams coach for the Kansas City Chiefs. From 2001 to 2003 he was the Washington Redskins' special teams coach. In 2004, he was the special teams coach for the St. Louis Rams. For the 2006 through 2008 seasons, including the 2009 playoff run, he was special teams coordinator for the Green Bay Packers."

        "text": "The Boston College Eagles women's ice hockey team represent Boston College in the NCAA and participate in Hockey East. The Eagles are coached by former Olympic gold medallist Katie King-Crowley and play their home games at Conte Forum. They have won the Hockey East championship three times, and made seven trips to the Frozen Four of the NCAA tournament.\nHistory.\nThe Boston Eagles women's ice hockey program was launched in 1994, under head coach Tom O'Malley, who oversaw the development of the program for five years. In 1999, Tom Babson took the helm and coached for four seasons. In the early years, the team competed in the Eastern Collegiate Athletic Conference (ECAC) but struggled to build a competitive program, largely due to the school being generally unsupportive financially.\nIn 2002, they joined the newly formed Hockey East Conference for women's hockey. Tom Mutch was hired as the head coach in 2003, and the program began to see greater success, in part due to pressure from Boston University, whose women’s program was set to debut in 2006. The Eagles won their first Beanpot championship in 2006, and finished second in the conference that year. The following year, the team had its best season to-date, finishing 24-20-2, and qualifying for the NCAA championship tournament for the first time. The Eagles lost in the semi-finals to Minnesota-Duluth in double overtime.\nShortly after, on April 24, 2007, Tom Mutch resigned as head coach of the women's ice hockey program. The resignation came in the wake of an inappropriate relationship with Kelli Stack, a freshman who was the Hockey East Player and Rookie of the Year. The \"Boston Herald\" had printed an article earlier that day that detailed the alleged explicit text messaging that occurred between the married Tom Mutch and Stack. Mutch was forced to resign. Though a sexual relationship was never proven, the messages were said to be \"filthy\" by news reports at the time.\nKatie King-Crowley, the Eagles assistant coach, was hired as head coach in May 2007. Courtney Kennedy became Associate head coach.\nUnder King-Crowley's leadership, the program became one of the most competitive in women's ice hockey. Originally from Salem, New Hampshire, she had a strong college career as a forward with Brown University. She competed in three Olympics with the U.S. National team, winning a gold medal in 1998, a silver in 2002, and a bronze in 2006. In thirteen seasons with King-Crowley as head coach, the Eagles have won three Hockey East tournament championships, lead the regular conference season four times, played in six NCAA Frozen Four tournaments, and competed in one NCAA championship final.\nThe 2010-2011 season was one of the first major successes in the program; the team would go on to win their first Hockey East title. In October, Taylor Wasylk was recognized as Hockey East Rookie of the Week for three consecutive weeks, the first time in Boston College Eagles women's ice hockey history that a player has won a league award for three consecutive weeks. Kelli Stack was the October 2010 Hockey East Player of the Month. She finished October 2010 with fifteen points (nine goals, six assists) in eight games for Boston College. Stack started every game at center and has accumulated points in every game. She finished the month leading the Eagles in points, goals, power play goals, and shorthanded goals. On October 31, she was involved in all three goals against Connecticut (one goal, two assists). She was part of all three goals scored at Vermont on October 15 (two goals, one assist). Against the Syracuse Orange (on October 9), Stack scored a hat trick. On February 8, 2011, with two points in the game against Boston University in the first round of the 2011 Beanpot Tournament, Kelli Stack accumulated 199 points in her career and broke BC's all-time career points record, becoming the new program leader. On March 6, 2011, the Eagles beat the Northeastern Huskies by a 3-1 tally to claim their first Hockey East Tournament championship.\nIn 2014-2015, the Eagles received their first #1 ranking, after starting the season undefeated. They posted a 27-0-1 record before losing a game, and went undefeated in conference play. The Eagles returned to the NCAA Frozen Four, losing in the semi-final. Alex Carpenter became the first Boston College player to win the Patty Kazmaier Award. She accumulated 81 points during the season, scoring 37 goals and registering 44 assists. King-Crowley won the national Coach of the Year award.\nIn 2016-2017, the Eagles coaching staff was the only all-female staff in college ice hockey. King-Crowley and Kennedy were joined by assistants Gilian Apps and Alison Quandt.\nIn 2017-2018, BC won their third straight Beanpot in the annual tournament held in February. They won a fifth straight Hockey East title, and established their best record at 30-5-3.\nDaryl Watts would follow Carpenter as the second Patty Kazmaier Award winner in Eagles history, capturing the award in 2018. Watts’ end-to-end shorthanded goal against the University of New Hampshire was also recognized among the BC Eagles Athletics’ Top 10 Plays of the 2017-18 season, placing second. Winning both the Hockey East Player and Rookie of the Year Awards, she became only the second player in conference history to do so, tying a mark set by former Boston College player Kelli Stack in 2006. In 2019, fans were shocked by the sudden departure of Watts, who transferred to the Wisconsin Badgers mid-season.\nCurrent roster.\n&lt;section end=roster /&gt;\nAwards and honors.\nHockey East.\nRookie of the Year\nEagles in professional hockey.\n\"In Progress\""

        "title": "List of Olympic men's ice hockey players for the United States",
        "text": "Men's ice hockey tournaments have been staged at the Olympic Games since 1920. The men's tournament was introduced at the 1920 Summer Olympics, and permanently added to the Winter Olympic Games in 1924. The United States has participated in 22 of 23 tournaments, sending 43 goaltenders and 282 skaters.\nFor the first two tournaments, the United States sent club amateur teams with additional players from other squads. After sitting out the 1928 tournament, they returned in 1932 with a team made up almost entirely of players attending college in the US. The early American teams were successful, winning three silver medals and a bronze in the first five tournaments. In 1948, controversy struck when the US sent two teams to the Olympics. Two competing bodies, the American Hockey Association and the Amateur Athletic Union, each claimed that their team had the right to represent the United States. As a compromise, the AHA team was permitted to compete, but they would be prohibited from qualifying for a medal.\nIn 1960, an unheralded American squad defeated the Canadian and Soviet squads on American soil en route to their first Olympic gold medal. The next several years were not as successful, and the Americans fell in the rankings; when the United States won silver in 1972, it did so from the B Pool, becoming the first B Pool squad to medal in an Olympic tournament. In 1980, Herb Brooks, the last man cut from the team that won gold in 1960, was named coach, and selected a team of college hockey players. The Americans shocked the world by first upsetting the heavily favored Soviet team 4–3, and then they defeated Finland for the gold medal. The \"Miracle on Ice\", as the game against the Soviets came to be known, was later named as the greatest moment in international hockey history by the IIHF, and the story was later turned into two motion pictures, \"Miracle on Ice\" and \"Miracle\".\nThe Olympic Games were originally intended for amateur athletes, so the players of the National Hockey League (NHL) and other professional leagues were not allowed to compete. The countries that benefited most were the Soviet Bloc countries of Eastern Europe, where top athletes were state-sponsored while retaining their status as amateurs. In 1986, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) voted to allow all athletes to compete in Olympic Games, starting in 1988. The NHL decided not to allow all players to participate in 1988, 1992 or 1994, because doing so would force the league to halt play during the Olympics. An agreement was reached in 1995 that allowed NHL players to compete in the Olympics, starting with the 1998 Games in Nagano, Japan. Since that time, the Americans have won two silver medals, losing both times to Canada in the gold medal game in North America (2002 in Salt Lake City and 2010 in Vancouver). National teams are co-ordinated by USA Hockey and players are chosen by the team's management staff.\nThe United States has won two gold medals, eight silver medals and one bronze medal in men's ice hockey; the Americans have won more silver medals than any other nation. Four players have been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, seven into the IIHF Hall of Fame and sixty-two individuals into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame. In addition, two teams have been inducted into the US Hockey Hall of Fame and the United States Olympic Hall of Fame: the gold medal winning 1960 and 1980 teams. Two players—Chris Chelios and Keith Tkachuk—have played on four teams. According to the IOC database, 176 men have won medals; ten players—Bill Cleary, Chris Drury, Herbert Drury, John Garrison, John Mayasich, Dick Meredith, Weldon Olson, Brian Rafalski, Richard Rodenheiser, and Frank Synott—have won two medals. Keith Tkachuk holds the record for most games played, having dressed for 23 games in 1992, 1998, 2002, and 2006. Herbert Drury leads American Olympians in goals, having scored 33 goals in 1920 and 1924 (before assists were counted); Bruce Cunliffe scored 23 points (17 goals and 6 assists) in 1948, and Bill Christian recorded 12 assists in 1960 and 1964.\nGoaltenders.\nReserve goaltenders.\nThese goaltenders were named to the Olympic roster, but did not receive any ice time during games."

He was born in Chester, Pennsylvania.\nAt age 24, it had been a long journey to the major leagues for Daniels. He spent nearly seven full seasons in the minor leagues, playing for nine teams at six different levels before reaching the majors with the Boston Braves during the season.\nDaniels appeared in 106 games, mostly as a right fielder, while sharing outfield duties with Sid Gordon (LF) and Sam Jethroe (CF).

        "text": "Nolan Ryan's Baseball (known in Japan as ) is a baseball video game endorsed by then-Texas Rangers baseball player Nolan Ryan; one of the most popular baseball players of the late 20th century. It has no licensing from Major League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association; meaning that Nolan Ryan is the only non-fictional ballplayer in the entire game. All the other players have names that appear to be given names while Nolan Ryan uses his surname.\nGameplay.\nDifferent modes for playing include exhibition and regular season (lasting anywhere from ten games per team to an impressive 100 games per team). Unusual for a game at that time, it allowed a position player to be chosen as a relief pitcher or even as a starting pitcher. There is no designated hitter rule in this game so that the pitchers must go up to bat with their .150 batting average (which is below the Mendoza Line). While pitchers are not expected to hit above the Mendoza Line, having a hitter (or a group of hitters) go through a season with a batting average below .200 could indicate a lack of player skill.\nThere is no playoffs mode after regular season because all the teams are under one league. However, if more than one team has the lead for the pennant, a short elimination tournament will be held to determine the champion. The graphics look childish although their pitches are similar in speed to the actual Major League Baseball of that time. Players also have a tendency to march down the field at a slow speed regardless of their ratings and throws from the outfield tend to be less powerful than similar throws done from the infield.\nThe stats are followed throughout the entire year (for all the teams involved) and are adjusted after every play. Baseball players can be created from scratch, traded to other teams in favor of their pre-existing players, traded in for free agents, and have their attributes altered in order to make the perfect ballplayer.\nReviews.\nNintendo Power gave the game scores of 66% for play control, 60% for gameplay challenge, and 50% for the game overall theme and fun factor.\nFamitsu gave the game a score of 25/40."

Had this bid been successful (the bid was won by Qatar), Japan would have been hosting their second World Cup Finals and it would have been their first solo hosting since they shared the 2002 FIFA World Cup with other co-host South Korea, becoming the sixth nation to host the tournament twice, after Italy, France, Mexico, Brazil and (West) Germany. On May 4, 2010, the Japanese Football Association Bid team decided to concentrate solely on winning the right to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup.\nCandidate venues.\n12 stadiums are proposed. \na: Stadium/site used in 2002 FIFA World Cup\n3D and holographic simulcasts.\nJapan pledged that if it had been granted the rights to host the 2022 World Cup games, it would develop technology enabling it to provide a live international telecast of the event in 3D, which would allow 400 stadiums in 208 countries to provide 360 million people with real-time 3D coverage of the games projected on giant screens, captured in 360 degrees by 200 HD cameras. Furthermore, Japan will broadcast the games in holographic format if the technology to do so is available by that time. Beyond allowing the world's spectators to view the games on flat screens projecting 3D imaging, holographic projection would project the games onto stadium fields, creating a greater illusion of actually being in the presence of the players. Microphones embedded below the playing surface would record all sounds, such as ball kicks, in order to add to the sense of realism.\nJapan's bidding team has enlisted pioneering technology scientist Jun Murai of Keio University in their plans to host the games. The country demonstrated holographic display technology at the 2009 NAB Show using integral cameras (sometimes referred to as 8K) and wavefront reconstruction, and Murai has stated that Japan could develop the means for the necessary technologies to be realized by 2016. Murai and committee managing director Takato Maruyama have stated they are confident that the endeavor is feasible. The event would be co-organized with South Korea.\nIn addition to projection, \"translation earpieces\" would be available to allow fans of different nations to converse with each other. Devices would also be available which would allow people to instantly capture information about players by pointing at them.\nPower sources.\nThe events would be powered in part by attendees, via equipment that would harvest energy created by their footsteps. It would also obtain energy from solar panels.\nIndustry ramifications.\nIf Japan had been awarded the 2022 World Cup, providing it with the initiative to realize the proposed technologies, it could drive private companies to develop them as well, in order to stay in competition in the industry, resulting in accelerated development of the medium. Maruyama expressed his belief that with the advent of such technologies, public viewings at stadiums would increase attendance there by several ten-fold."

        "text": "International Cricket 2010 is a sports association cricket simulation video game developed by Trickstar Games and released by Codemasters. It was released in the United Kingdom and India on 18 June 2010 and in Australia on 21 October. The game is a part of the Codemasters Cricket series preceded by the \"Brian Lara Cricket Series\" and is a direct sequel to the 2009 release, \"Ashes Cricket 2009\".\nThe game is licensed by the England Cricket Board and Cricket Australia, and thus will include all the official players of the Australia national cricket team and the England national cricket team. The rest of the teams in the game are unlicensed and don't feature the official players of the corresponding teams.\n\"International Cricket\" also includes an online mode for the consoles it was released on, and a revolutionary Action Cam which provides an on-field view of play, which allows the user to view the game from different aspects on the field, and works with both batting and bowling.\nImprovements from Ashes Cricket 2009.\nThere is a new tournaments section with four new tournaments based on the big four limited overs contests – World 20 Overs (T20), 20 Overs Super Leagnzue (T20), Champions Cup (ODI) and World Trophy (ODI). Test cricket is still available, and Test tournaments can be participated in by all teams.\nThere is an expanded roster of 16 international teams (Including Bermuda, Canada, the Netherlands, and Scotland) and players can choose between 21 stadiums from around the world, 3 of which are new additions in Dhaka, Grenada, and Port Elizabeth.\nA new Power Stick feature enables players to gain both 360-degree direction and power control.\nA new \"sportsmanship rating\" feature will allow players to decide on a preferred online opponent, especially for avoiding players who quit matches when losing. However, the online aspect of the released game has received extensive criticism due to both the poorly designed sportsmanship ratings feature and a bug which causes online games to disconnect, usually after a boundary or a six is hit by a batsman.\nPeople can select to play in different regions around the world, and even their own tournament. Winning tournaments unlocks brand new kit items, and other awards such as bats, pads and other equipment. The AI has been improved with batsmen being able to pick the gaps, computer simulation, and responses are more realistic than before.\nConsoles and aborted PC version.\nThe game was released for PS3 and Xbox 360 and major developer Codemasters said that they wanted to \"watch the response of the game with these consoles and decide on the future improvements or other platform releases, should the game do well\". The PC version was not released as the Action Cam is not supported by the PC system. Also sales and issues with developer from \"Ashes Cricket 2009\" resulted in a temporary setback regarding the future of games in this line."

        "title": "Miami Hurricanes men's basketball",
        "text": "The Miami Hurricanes men's basketball team is the college basketball team of the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida. The team competes in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC).\nThe University of Miami men's basketball team was formed in 1926, but the program was later dropped by the university in 1971. In 1985, 14 years later, the Hurricanes resumed play as an independent and joined the Big East Conference in 1991, winning the Big East regular season title in 2000. In 2004, in conjunction with the rest of the Miami athletic program, the team moved to the ACC. \nIn 2012–2013, the team won its first regular season ACC championship and its first ACC championship. In the 2014–2015 season, they reached the final of the National Invitation Tournament (NIT). The team has reached the NCAA Championship's Sweet 16 five times (1999–2000, 2012–2013, 2015–2016, 2021–2022, and 2022–2023), the Elite Eight twice (2021–2022 and 2022–2023), and the Final Four once (2022–2023).\nThe Hurricanes are currently coached by Jim Larrañaga and play their home games at the Watsco Center.\nHistory.\nPerry Clark era (1999–2004).\nPerry Clark took over the program at Miami in 2000 and spent four seasons with the Hurricanes, where he led them to a 65–54 (.546) record. In his first three seasons with the program, he accumulated 51 wins, the most ever by a Hurricane coach, and became the only Miami coach to take the Hurricanes to the postseason in each of his first two seasons.\nClark's 2001–02 Hurricane squad finished 24–8 and received the school's fourth NCAA Tournament berth and set a school record for wins in a season. Included in the 24 wins were a school-record 14 consecutive victories to open the season. His Hurricanes were not ranked in the preseason, but were ranked for the final 13 weeks of the campaign, ending the year No. 21 according to the Associated Press.\nFrank Haith era (2004–2011).\nFrank Haith was hired on April 11, 2004 and tasked with leading the Hurricanes into the Atlantic Coast Conference. In his first season, Haith took a team that was coming off two straight losing seasons and picked to finish last in the ACC and guided it to the postseason for the first time since 2002. As a result, Haith was a finalist for the Naismith National Coach of the Year Award.\nHaith again took Miami to the NIT in 2005, and the Hurricanes won their first two games before bowing out in a loss to the Michigan Wolverines. It was just the second time in Miami's basketball history that the Hurricanes had won back-to-back postseason games.\nHaith reached just one NCAA tournament as the head coach at Miami, leading the Hurricanes to a second-round appearance in 2008. The next season, Haith's team returned four starters, including sharpshooter Jack McClinton. Miami began the season ranked 16th in the USA Today/ESPN pre-season poll, and the media picked it to finish fourth in the ACC. However, Miami finished below .500 in conference play and missed the NCAA tournament, instead participating in the NIT. The following season, Haith's team finished in last place in the ACC.\nHaith has also led the Hurricanes to success off-the-court. Under Haith's tenure, all eight Miami senior basketball players who have completed their eligibility have earned their degrees. Miami also placed three players on the ACC All-Academic basketball team for the 2004–2005 season, more than any school in the conference.\nJim Larrañaga era (2011–present).\nOn April 22, 2011, Jim Larrañaga accepted the head coaching position at the University of Miami. In his first season at Miami, he led the team to a 9–7 record in-conference. It marked the school's first ever winning record in the ACC.\nIn his second season, Larrañaga led the Hurricanes to arguably their best season since the Rick Barry era. They won the ACC regular-season title (the first time in 11 years, and only the fourth time in 32 years, that a team from North Carolina had not won at least a share of the title). The highlight of the season was an unprecedented 90–63 rout of #1 ranked Duke. That win was Miami's first-ever defeat of a top-ranked team, and the largest margin of defeat for a #1 team ever.\nOn March 17, 2013, Larrañaga coached the Hurricanes to the ACC tournament title—the first tournament title in the program's history — with an 87–77 win over North Carolina. On April 4, 2013, Larrañaga was voted the Associated Press' college basketball coach of the year. A week later, the Hurricanes advanced to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA tournament with their school-record 29th win. The season ended the following weekend with a loss to Marquette. He claimed the Hurricanes had not enough energy to win the game because of Reggie Johnson's injury and Shane Larkin's sickness.\nSince the mid-2010s, Miami men's basketball under Larrañaga has become a routine contender in the ACC and nationally. In 2022, Miami made their first Elite Eight in program history, only falling short against eventual national champions Kansas. In the 2023 tournament, the Hurricanes made an even bigger leap, overcoming top regional seed Houston and second-seeded Texas en route to the program's first-ever Final Four. However, in the Final Four, they again ran into the eventual champions, this time falling to UConn.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Hurricanes have appeared in the NCAA tournament 12 times. Their combined record is 15–12.\nNIT results.\nThe Hurricanes have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) 12 times. Their combined record is 11–12.\nNotable players.\nHonored jerseys.\n\"Honored\" players are those former athletes who have had their jerseys hanging at the Watsco Center rafters, although those numbers are not officially retired.\nNational Player of the Year.\n2013 – Shane Larkin, Lute Olson National Player of the Year\nACC Player of the Year.\n2013 – Shane Larkin (Coaches)\n&lt;br&gt;\n2023 – Isaiah Wong\nAll-ACC Teams.\nFirst Team All-ACC:\nSecond Team All-ACC:\nThird Team All-ACC:\nACC All-Rookie Team:\nACC All-Defensive Team:\nACC All-Tournament Team:\nBig East Player of the Year.\n1999 – Tim James\nAll-Big East Teams.\nFirst Team All-Big East:\nSecond Team All-Big East:\nThird Team All-Big East:\nBig East All-Rookie Team:\nBig East All-Tournament Team:\nStorm Surge.\nOrigins.\nStorm Surge is the official student section of Miami Hurricanes men's and women's basketball. It was founded in 2011. Prior to Storm Surge's creation, Miami had been victim to years of inconsistent student attendance and a lack of student interest in the basketball program, and prior attempts to create a lasting student section such as \"UBeach\" and \"Haith's Faithful\" were largely unsuccessful. Storm Surge works directly with Miami's athletic department to enhance the game day experience and encourage greater involvement from the student body. Storm Surge began with 500 members, but saw average student attendance jump to over 1,100 for ACC games in 2012–2013, its second season. As student capacity at the BUC is limited, students are admitted on a first-come, first-served basis, with students often arriving hours beforehand or camping out to get the best seats.\nTraditions.\nStorm Surge has become famous for its creative and unique free throw chants and distractions, digging up embarrassing facts and pictures of opposing players, and its slogan, \"Pack The BUC,\" which can be seen on T-shirts, signs, and promotional materials at University of Miami home games. Like many student sections, Storm Surge distributes cheer sheets prior to each game, detailing specific cheers for that game. The group also has the ability to create cheers on the fly through the use of a large whiteboard at the front of the student section, which is used to coordinate all cheers.\nStorm Surge's official color is orange, and all members wear orange to every game. The student section is situated behind both baskets and consists of bleacher seating and traditional seating. As bleacher seating is closest to the floor, the students in the bleachers are typically the team's biggest supporters. Before each game, Storm Surge sings the national anthem together, even if the anthem is being sung by an individual performer. During opposing teams' introductions, students turn around to face away from the court and throw up \"The U.\" During Miami's home introductions, the student section links arms and rocks left to right, going faster and faster before erupting into cheers for the Hurricanes. For Miami's free throws, students hold up one finger, all jumping once on a made free throw and twice on the second free throw if both free throws are made.\nStorm Surge also organizes watch parties and live online blogs for every away game. These events are open to all students and typically take place on campus. Following major road wins, the group gathers at the BankUnited Center to greet and congratulate the returning Hurricanes team, a tradition that has since carried over to football. Membership in the organization also entitles students to exclusive meet and greets with players, priority seating to games, and promotions and giveaways.\nLarrañaga Lawn.\nIn 2012, due to unprecedented demand for student tickets to the January 23 game against the #1 ranked Duke Blue Devils, students camped out on an adjacent field to the BankUnited Center, which was promptly dubbed \"Larrañaga Lawn,\" after Coach Jim Larrañaga. Students camped out for several other games during the 2012–2013 season, including sold out contests against FSU and UNC. Coach Jim Larrañaga and members of the team always greet students lined up on Larrañaga Lawn both the night before the game and again on game day, often bringing food to students in line. Lawn sports such as football, frisbee, and Kan-jam have become popular ways for students in line to pass the time on Larrañaga Lawn.\nNational attention.\nStorm Surge made national headlines in 2012 during Miami's home game against UNC, when students chanted \"Austin Rivers\" at UNC free throw shooter Tyler Zeller, whom Rivers had hit a buzzer beater over in UNC's previous game. Storm Surge was again in the national spotlight following Miami's 90–63 rout of Duke in January 2013 when students rushed the court in celebration. The student section has been praised by many notable visitors, including: Jimmy Graham, Warren Sapp, Dick Vitale,and Carlos Boozer.\nIn 2013, Storm Surge received a number of accolades, including three of the \"Best Fan Signs in College Basketball\" by USA Today and was featured on national programs such as PTI, SportsCenter, and CBS's documentary \"March Madness Fandemonium\". In addition, it was recognized as one of the toughest ACC venues by ESPN during numerous broadcasts throughout the season. On January 24, 2013, Storm Surge was featured on the front page of The Miami Herald following Miami's win over Duke. On February 9, 2013, Storm Surge was featured on the landing page of ESPN.com following Miami's blowout home win over UNC.\nAfter losing its flair following some up-and-down seasons, the student section was renamed to \"The Eye\" at the start of the 2021-22 season. More about The Eye can be found on Category 5's page, which is the University of Miami's official student school spirit organization.\nFacilities.\nMiami Beach Convention Center.\nThe Miami Hurricanes played their home games at the Miami Beach Convention Center from 1956-1971. \nJames L. Knight Center (1985–1988).\nOn November 12, 1985, the Knight Sports Complex was dedicated at a gala banquet that was held on the basketball courts of the new structure. CBS basketball analyst Billy Packer served as the evening’s guest speaker for an event that welcomed more than 500 guests to the on-campus home of Hurricane basketball. The facility served as the practice home to the men’s and women’s basketball programs, while also housing the men’s basketball coaching staff offices until the team moved to Miami Arena in 1988. In addition, the Knight Sports Complex enabled the athletic program to more than double the size of the existing strength room, while also providing meeting rooms and lecture rooms for all of Miami’s student-athletes.\nMiami Arena (1988–2002).\nThe Hurricanes called Miami Arena home from 1988 until December 2002. The downtown arena attracted large crowds for marquee opponents as the program began play in the Big East Conference in 1991. The school shared the facility with the NBA's Miami Heat and the NHL's Florida Panthers until each respective professional franchise built newer stadiums.\nWatsco Center (2002–present).\nAfter years of planning, Hurricanes basketball finally moved on-campus on January 4, 2003 when the Hurricanes defeated No. 22 North Carolina in overtime to christen the opening of the Convocation Center (nicknamed the \"Convo\"). The $48 million facility was funded through private donations, though was later renamed the BankUnited Center in 2005. In 2016, the University announced the renaming of the facility as the Watsco Center."

        "text": "Brian M. Wardle (born October 9, 1979) is an American college basketball coach and the current men's basketball coach at Bradley University.\nEarly life and education.\nBorn in Clarendon Hills, Illinois, Wardle graduated from Hinsdale Central High School in nearby Hinsdale in 1997. At Hinsdale Central, Wardle earned two all-state basketball honors and broke scoring and rebounding records in school history. After high school, Wardle played for Marquette University at guard from 1997 to 2001, under head coach Mike Deane from 1997 to 1999 and Tom Crean from 1999 to 2001. In four seasons, Wardle played 117 games with 93 starts. As a senior in 2000–01, Wardle was Marquette's leading scorer with 18.8 points per game; he would end his college career as the no. 3 all-time leading scorer at Marquette.\nProfessional basketball career.\nAfter college, Wardle played in the NBA Developmental League and the Continental Basketball Association. Selected by the Fayetteville Patriots in the third round, 17th overall, in the 2001 NBDL draft, Wardle played 45 games with 19 starts for the Patriots in 2001–02, averaging 2.6 points, 1.6 rebounds, and 0.8 assists in 11.9 minutes per game.\nThen in the 2002–03 season, Wardle played for the Rockford Lightning of the Continental Basketball Association. In 41 games with 17 starts, Wardle averaged 11.7 points, 3.1 rebounds, and 2.0 assists.\nCoaching career.\nReturning to Marquette, Wardle was director of basketball operations under Tom Crean from 2003 to 2005 and an assistant coach at UW-Green Bay from 2005 to 2010. After the 2009-2010 season, Wardle was named head coach at UW-Green Bay. Upon his hiring, Wardle became the youngest head coach in NCAA Division I basketball. In 2014, Wardle was named the Horizon League Coach of the Year. In 2015, he left to take the coaching job at Bradley, which posted a 9-24 record the season before his arrival and a 5-27 record after the year in which he arrived. He had a 95-65 record at Green Bay but failed to make the NCAA Tournament. \nOn March 10, 2019, Wardle led the Braves to the NCAA Tournament by winning The Missouri Valley’s “Arch Madness” Tournament. The Braves defeated Northern Iowa 57-54. This is the first conference tournament championship for Bradley since 1988, and the first trip to the NCAA Tournament for Bradley since 2006. Bradley played two seeded Michigan State on March 21, 2019. Wardle was asked to keep wearing a red pair of shoes his wife had bought him. Wardle, claiming he wasn't superstitious, \"everyone else is,\" wore his red shoes. Bradley was 8-0 when Wardle wore these shoes. Bradley led Michigan State at half 35-34, dominating the boards in the first half. Bradley lost the game \n76-65.\nPrior to Bradley's NCAA Tournament game against Michigan State, Wardle was involved in a controversy that gained national attention. A Bradley Athletics official revoked media access to a local beat reporter due to not \"promoting the Bradley brand.\" Wardle later apologized and the reporter's access to the team was restored."

        "title": "Cuban Baseball Hall of Fame",
        "text": "The Cuban Baseball Hall of Fame (\"Salón de la Fama del Béisbol Cubano\") is a hall of fame that honors eminent baseball players from Cuban baseball. Established in 1939 to honor players, managers, and umpires in the pre-revolution Cuban League, by 1961 it had honored 68 players, managers, and umpires whose names are shown on a marble plaque at Havana's Estadio Latinoamericano. After the revolution, however, the Hall of Fame languished for more than 50 years, seldom mentioned or acknowledged and with no new inductees. Following a campaign led by Cuban filmmaker Ian Padrón, a meeting was held on November 7–8, 2014 to reformulate the Hall of Fame and to propose a museum in which it would be housed. The reformulated Hall recognized the original 68 members, and a jury of 25 people selected 10 new inductees—five from the pre-revolution period and five representing for the first time the post-revolution Cuban National Series. The planned site for the new museum is in the José Antonio Echeverría Workers' Social Club (also known as the Vedado Tennis Club).\nHistory.\nPre-revolution (1939–1961).\nThe Cuban Baseball Hall of Fame was established by the DGND (\"Dirección General Nacional de Deportes\"), a government agency supervising sports activities in Cuba. The hall was inaugurated on July 26, 1939—about six weeks after the June 12 dedication and opening of the U.S. National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown—by placing a bronze plaque at Havana's La Tropical Stadium. The first ten inductees were selected by former and current baseball writers and the DGND's baseball advisers (\"asesores de baseball\"). The inaugural class included 19th-century Cuban stars (Antonio María García, Valentín González, Adolfo Luján, and Carlos Royer), black players who had achieved success in the U.S. Negro leagues (Luis Bustamante, José de la Caridad Méndez, Gervasio González, and Cristóbal Torriente), and white players who had played Major League Baseball (Rafael Almeida and Armando Marsans). Méndez and Torriente, along with later inductee Martín Dihigo, subsequently were also recognized by the U.S. Hall of Fame.\nThe bronze plaque was subsequently replaced by a marble plaque that hangs on a wall \"in a poorly lit corner\" of Havana's Estadio Latinoamericano. Before listing the names of the inductees, the introductory section of the plaque reads, \n&lt;poem&gt;\nCuban Professional Baseball Hall of Fame\nList of players that have been selected as\nBASEBALL IMMORTALS\nAnd have deserved this just recognition for their distinguished work\nmaintaining an undying memory of what they were in this\nsport\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nWhile all of the inductees were recognized as baseball players, in several cases their distinction reflected, at least in part, accomplishments achieved after their playing careers. For example, Emilio Sabourín, Agustín Molina, and José Rodríguez were long-time managers who won championships, as also were more celebrated players such as Dihigo, Miguel Angel González, Adolfo Luque, and Marsans. Francisco A. Poyo and Eustaquio Gutiérrez served as umpires. Carlos Zaldo, Eugenio Jiménez, and Molina entered the business side of baseball as stadium developer, promoter, and league administrator. Wenceslao Gálvez wrote a history of baseball in Cuba, published in 1889, which according to Roberto González Echevarría \"may very well be the first history of the game ever written anywhere\".\nOther inductees achieved distinction outside of baseball. For example, Juan Antiga, who played in the Cuban League for just two seasons prior to completing medical school, became a notable intellectual, homeopath, government official, and diplomat, serving as ambassador to Switzerland and delegate to the League of Nations. The type of post-playing distinction most often recognized by the hall, however, is military service, especially during the Cuban War of Independence that was fought from 1895 to 1898. Alfredo Arango, Eduardo Machado, and Carlos Maciá served as officers in the Cuban revolutionary army and Sabourín, Juan Manuel Pastoriza, and Ricardo Cabaleiro died in the conflict.\nIn the 20th century, opportunities to play in the United States became increasingly important to Cuban players. Some of the earliest opportunities to play in the U.S. came in nearby Key West beginning about 1890. Key West had an independent baseball league with considerable participation by Cuban emigrants, and Cuban League players were recruited to play there during the off season. Cuban Baseball Hall of Fame inductees Molina and Poyo began their baseball careers in Key West before moving on to the Cuban League. In 1899, a Cuban all-star team, the All Cubans, undertook their first barnstorming tour of the United States. The team, which was racially integrated (reflecting the racial integration of the Cuban League) played against professional and semi-professional teams, white and black, until 1905. \nHowever, the U.S. color line soon affected Cuban players. By 1904, white Cubans, such as Juan Violá, were playing in the minor leagues, and in 1911 Rafael Almeida and Armando Marsans broke into the majors with the Cincinnati Reds. Meanwhile, Cubans with darker complexions played in the Negro leagues for teams such as the Cuban Stars (West), the Cuban Stars (East), and the New York Cubans. Some Cuban players moved on to success with U.S. teams, such as José Méndez with the Kansas City Monarchs and Cristóbal Torriente with the Chicago American Giants.\nExile in Florida (1962–1986, 1997–1998).\nAfter the closing of the Cuban League in 1961, inductions to the Cuban Baseball Hall of Fame ceased in Havana for more than five decades. The players who had migrated to the United States, however, formed an organization, the Federation of Professional Cuban Baseball Players in Exile (\"Federación de Peloteros Profesionales Cubanos en el Exilio\") which held elections in Miami to add new members to the hall. These additional members are not universally recognized; they are not recognized in Cuba, nor are they included in lists of Hall of Fame inductees shown in reference books by historians Peter Bjarkman and Jorge Figueredo. The Miami elections continued in three phases—1962–1986, 1997–1998, and 2007—ultimately declaring more than 200 additional individuals as inductees.\nOfficial reformulation (2014–present).\nIn August 2014, Cuban filmmaker and baseball fan Ian Padrón brought together a group of 12 prominent fans to create a group called Enthusiasts for the Refoundation of the Cuban Baseball Hall of Fame. The group developed a set of rules to govern a reformulated hall which would recognize the 68 original members, provide for regular elections of additional professional and amateur players from both the pre-revolution and post-revolution periods, and would help arrange for the hall to be part of a Cuban baseball museum. With support from the National Institute of Sport, Physical Education, and Recreation (INDER), a meeting of sports commentators was held on November 7–8, 2014. The meeting approved the draft rules, selected a jury of 25 people to select the inductees, and planned for subsequent annual elections. Four players and an umpire were honored from the pre-revolution era—Conrado (Connie) Marrero, Orestes (Minnie) Miñoso, Camilo Pascual, Esteban (Steve) Bellán, and umpire Amado Maestri. Five players were also honored the post-revolution era, the first players from that period to be recognized—Omar Linares, Orestes Kindelán, Antonio Muñoz, Luis Casanova, and Braudilio Vinent."

        "text": "The Basin Reserve (commonly known as \"The Basin\"), is a cricket ground in Wellington, New Zealand, used for Test, first-class and one-day cricket. Some argue that its proximity to the city, its Historic Place status and its age make it the most famous cricket ground in New Zealand. The Basin Reserve is the only cricket ground in New Zealand to have Historic Place status. The ground has been used for events other than cricket, such as concerts, sports events and other social gatherings, but now it is mostly used for cricket, particularly Test matches.\nSince 2023, 109 Test centuries (4 in women's cricket) have been scored at the ground, by players from every Test nation without Zimbabwe. Kiwi batsman Stewie Dempster is the first player to score a Test century. Aravinda de Silva's 267 remains the highest score at the Basin Reserve by an overseas player, scored in January 1991, while Brendon McCullum's 302 is the overall highest score both at the ground and by any New Zealand player anywhere. Martin Crowe and Kane Williamson both hold the record for the most Test centuries at the ground with five.\nOnly six One Day International centuries have been scored at the ground. The Pakistan player Shoaib Mohammad holds the record for highest score with 126*.\nTest centuries.\nThe following table summarises the Test centuries scored at the Basin Reserve.\nOne Day International centuries.\nThe following table summarises the One Day International centuries scored at the Basin Reserve.\nWomen's Test centuries.\nThe following table summarises the Women's Test centuries scored at the Basin Reserve.\nWomen's One Day International centuries.\nThe following table summarises the Women's One Day International centuries scored at the Basin Reserve."

        "title": "Art Davis (American football)",
        "text": "Arthur Ganong Davis (November 29, 1934 – January 29, 2021) was an American football player who played collegiately at Mississippi State in 1952–55 and for one season with the Pittsburgh Steelers in the National Football League (NFL).\nEarly life.\nArt Davis was born in Clarksdale, Mississippi, where he attended Clarksdale High School. He received a football scholarship to Mississippi State after missing his entire senior high school football season breaking his leg in the first game. He was voted \"Best Athlete\" and \"Mr. CHS\" at Clarksdale High School. Davis's nickname growing up was \"Honeybee\" which was given to him by a nurse when he was a young boy.\nCollege career.\nAt Mississippi State, Davis began his college football career as a four-year starter for Coach Murray Warmath as a true freshman defensive back in the 1952 season opener against defending National Champion, University of Tennessee. In the 1953 season-opener against Memphis State, Davis was a two-way starter and scored the first touchdown of Jack Cristil's 58-year broadcasting career for the Bulldogs. On Thanksgiving Day, Davis caught a touchdown pass from Jackie Parker to tie Ole Miss 7–7, knocking the Rebels out of Cotton Bowl contention and the Southeastern Conference crown. In 1954, Davis was voted the Southeastern Conference \"Player of the Year\" (Nashville Banner, Atlanta Constitution) where he scored 10 touchdowns and grabbed 4 interceptions playing both ways. He was also named the SEC's \"Best Offensive Back\" in 1954 (Atlanta Constitution). In that '54 campaign, Davis scored four touchdowns against LSU (3 rushing, 1 interception return) in a 25–0 win at Tiger Stadium in Baton Rouge. During that season, Davis played all 60 minutes in 6 of 10 games. In 1955 as team co-captain, Davis was named first-team All America by FWAA/\"Look\" (American magazine) and College Football's \"Player of the Year\" by the Football Writers Association of America. He was named as the \"Best Defensive Back\" and runner-up as \"Best Offensive Back\" in the SEC (Atlanta Constitution) that same year. He also punted for over a 40 yard average. Playing with a separated shoulder and injured knee at Auburn, Davis ran for a short touchdown, passed for a 35-yard score, had a 54-yard punt and made 11 unassisted tackles in a 27–26 loss. He finished his college career with 18 TDs. Davis was a sprinter on the track team and was nosed out in the finals of the 1955 SEC Track and Field Championship's 100 yard dash in a photo-finish. His best time in the 100 yard dash was 9.8 seconds.\nDuring the Auburn loss in 1955, Davis seriously injured his knee and would have to miss the North Texas State and Alabama games. The week of the Alabama game, thousands of leaflets were dropped from an airplane onto the Mississippi State campus. The message was \"Beat Bama Win for Arthur\" to encourage the students and football team as they traveled to Tuscaloosa for Bama's Homecoming. The Bulldogs prevailed 26–7. Bart Starr was the Crimson Tide quarterback, and he and Davis would be teammates in the Blue-Gray Game later that year.\nAs told by longtime Miss. State football announcer, Jack Cristil, in MSU's Alumnus Magazine in 1969 and again in Sid Salter's book, \"Jack Cristil: Voice of the Bulldogs\" published in 2011: \"Arthur Davis to me personifies Mississippi State students and athletes. I knew him when he was a youngster in high school in Clarksdale. Watched him grow up and remember the first play of his senior year as a high school performer. He caught a pass in the flat and broke his leg. This would have broken the spirit of many young men, but not Arthur Davis. He came to Mississippi State as a tremendous performer, earned All American honors as he should have, played in his senior year badly crippled and injured but certainly gave it – as the coaches always say – that 110 percent effort on and off the field. He has been a true gentleman throughout his life ... I've always thought of Arthur Davis as being what I would like to think of as typically Mississippi State in every way.\"\nDavis was voted \"Mr. Mississippi State\" by the students and was a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. After his senior season, Davis and was selected to play in the 1955 Blue-Gray Game (Gray team captain, 2 interceptions), the 1956 Senior Bowl, and the 1956 College All-Star Game vs. the Cleveland Browns. He is a member of the Mississippi State Athletic Hall of Fame (1971) and the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame (1981). In 2004, Davis was named to the SEC Football Legends at the SEC Championship Game in Atlanta, Georgia. He is a \"Mississippi Football Legend\" by the Jackson Touchdown Club. In 2018, Davis and Walt Harris were enshrined into Mississippi State football's \"Ring of Honor\" adding their names to the facade of Davis Wade Stadium. They joined former Bulldog greats Jack Cristil, Jackie Parker, Shorty McWilliams, D.D. Lewis, Kent Hull, Johnie Cooks, and Joe Fortunato.\nArt's older brother, Harper Davis, was an all-SEC, four-year starter at Mississippi State. Harper is also a member of the Mississippi State Athletic Hall of Fame, the State of Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame, and is a 2002 SEC Football Legends inductee. He played professionally for the Los Angeles Dons, Chicago Bears and Green Bay Packers and was later the Head Football Coach at Millsaps College (1964–1988) in Jackson, Mississippi.\nProfessional career.\nIn the 1956 NFL Draft., Davis was selected in the first round (5th overall) by the Pittsburgh Steelers. He was limited during his rookie season in by an injured shoulder which he suffered in the College All-Star Game vs. the Cleveland Browns as well as a knee injury he sustained in college and again with the Steelers. The knee injury would also sideline him for the season. He announced his retirement from football prior to the season.\nCoaching career.\nAfter professional football, Davis started his coaching career at Biloxi High School in 1957. He then became an assistant coach at LSU under Coach Paul Dietzel in 1959 and 1960, and was the freshman coach at Georgia Tech under Coach Bobby Dodd in 1961 and 1962. Davis was hired as the defensive backfield coach at the University of Texas in 1963, and in that season under Coach Darrell Royal, the Longhorns won the National Championship and then beat Navy, 28–6, in the 1964 Cotton Bowl.\n He retired from college coaching after that season to pursue business opportunities in Mississippi and spend more time with his family. Later in life, Davis coached at Lee Academy in Clarksdale, Mississippi and Central Catholic High School in Portland, Oregon.\nPersonal.\nDavis was married to the former Frances Habig of Jackson, Mississippi, for 58 years until her death in 2014. They have two children, four grandchildren, and four great grandchildren. Art's son, Doug, played tennis at Mississippi State in the early 1980s and grandson, Brad Jones, played first base and was team captain for the Bulldog baseball team in the early 2000s. The Davises are relatives of the Ganong Bros. candy-making family based in St. Stephen New Brunswick, Canada. Art lived in Oregon from 2001 to 2020 then moved to Starkville, MS later that year. \nHe died of Parkinson's disease on January 29, 2021, in Starkville, Mississippi, at age 86."

Listed at 5' 2\", 125 lb., she batted and threw right-handed.\nBiography.\nDonahue was born in Saskatchewan, Canada, of Irish ancestry. As a young girl she learned to play baseball with the help of her brother in their family farm, and later played softball at school and in Moose Jaw for the local Royals team. In 1945 Donahue was invited by an All-American Girls Professional Baseball League scout to spring training the next year in Pascagoula, Mississippi. She agreed to try out and was assigned to the Redwings, an expansion team based in Peoria, Illinois. During her four seasons in the league, Donahue was primarily a catcher, but played every position except first base and pitcher. She hit .127 in 287 games, and committed 56 errors in 1051 chances for a .947 fielding average.\nIn 1950 Donahue joined the Admiral Music Maids of the rival National Girls Baseball League in Chicago. After that, she worked for an interior design firm in Chicago in accounting and bookkeeping for 38 years, and then retired in 1990. A longtime resident of St. Charles, Illinois, Donahue carried out her Grand Marshal duties during the St. Patrick's Day Parade in 2009. She was honored with many recognitions and awards over the years, including inductions in the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame, and the Saskatchewan Baseball Hall of Fame. She died in March 2019 at the age of 93 after suffering from Parkinson's disease.\nIn 2020, Netflix released a documentary, \"A Secret Love\", which chronicles Donahue's ultimately 72-year relationship with her wife Emma Marie \"Pat\" Henschel. The couple got married on Donahue's birthday in 2015.\nThe character of Jess McCready from the 2022 reboot series A League of Their Own of the 1992 movie of the same name is partially based on Donahue."

        "title": "Anders Nilsson (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Bengt Per Anders Nilsson (born 19 March 1990) is a Swedish former professional ice hockey goaltender. Nilsson was drafted 62nd overall in the 2009 NHL Entry Draft by the New York Islanders and played in the NHL with the Islanders, Edmonton Oilers, St. Louis Blues, Buffalo Sabres, Vancouver Canucks, and Ottawa Senators. Internationally, Nilsson led Sweden to a gold medal at the 2018 World Championships.\nPlaying career.\nOn 27 April 2011, the New York Islanders signed Nilsson to a three-year entry-level contract. He was initially assigned to the Islanders American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Bridgeport Sound Tigers. Nilsson was recalled by the Islanders after Evgeni Nabokov was injured in a game against the Montreal Canadiens. He made his NHL debut on 19 November 2011, against the Boston Bruins, in relief of Rick DiPietro. He let in 3 goals on 17 shots, while playing 40 minutes, as the Islanders lost 6–0. He got his first start in the NHL on 21 November 2011, against the Pittsburgh Penguins at Consol Energy Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. On 4 March 2012, he earned his first NHL victory and shutout in a 1–0 home win against the New Jersey Devils. In doing so, he became the first goalie in Islanders history to record a shutout for his first win. In his next start, on 10 March 2012, he almost shutout the Devils a second time, but the Devils scored two goals in the last two minutes of the game, resulting in a 2–1 loss for the Islanders.\nNilsson saw limited action with the Sound Tigers in 2012–13, as he was diagnosed with an unknown, fatigue-inducing illness in January 2013. The illness was later determined to be a vitamin B12 deficiency. At the end of the season, Nilsson joined the Islanders for the playoffs but did not play. During the 2013–14 season, Nilsson was again assigned to the Bridgeport Sound Tigers. He was recalled on 18 November 2013 and played in five games with the Islanders, going 0–2–2 before being sent back to Bridgeport. Nilsson joined the Islanders again on 1 March 2014 after sending Kevin Poulin to Bridgeport. He finished the season playing in 19 games for the Islanders compiling a record of 8–7–2.\nOn 26 May 2014, as a restricted free agent, Nilsson decided to sign a contract with Russian club Ak Bars Kazan of the Kontinental Hockey League. Ak Bars issued a release confirming the signing. On 4 October 2014, Nilsson's NHL rights were traded by the Islanders to the Chicago Blackhawks in a trade for Nick Leddy. Nilsson appeared in 38 regular season games for Ak Bars, registering a 20–9–8 record and 20 playoff games, ending with a 13–7 record.\nOn 6 July 2015, Nilsson's NHL rights were traded for a second time, from the Blackhawks to the Edmonton Oilers in exchange for prospect Liam Coughlin. He in turn agreed to a one-year, one-way contract with the Oilers. Nilsson earned a spot on the Oilers roster after a stellar training camp, not allowing a single goal in the preseason. In the 2015–16 season, Nilsson appeared in a career high 26 games with the Oilers, sharing the pipes with Cam Talbot, before he was traded approaching the trade deadline by the Oilers to the St. Louis Blues in exchange for Niklas Lundström and the Blues' fifth-round selection in the 2016 NHL Entry Draft on 27 February 2016.\nOn 2 July 2016, Nilsson as a restricted free agent was traded from the Blues to the Buffalo Sabres in exchange for a 2017 fifth round draft pick. During the 2016–17 season, in December 2016, Nilsson began wearing a mask with a gay pride flag painted on the back as a sign that ice hockey welcomes diversity. He drew praise from Wade Davis, executive director of the You Can Play campaign, who said that Nilsson \"is taking a risk on multiple fronts and is standing up for something that he believes in, knowing the backlash that could come his way.\"\nAfter a successful tenure with the Sabres, serving as backup to Robin Lehner, Nilsson left as a free agent in signing a two-year, $5 million contract with the Vancouver Canucks on 1 July 2017. He was the Canucks' backup goalie until Thatcher Demko was deemed ready to play in the NHL by Vancouver's management. During the 2018–19 season, on 2 January 2019, he was traded by the Canucks along with Darren Archibald to the Ottawa Senators in exchange for Mike McKenna, Tom Pyatt and a sixth-round draft pick in 2019. He was acquired by the Senators following injuries to goaltenders Mike Condon and Craig Anderson. In 22 starts for the Senators, Nilsson went 11–11–0. On 29 May 2019, the Senators re-signed Nilsson to a two-year, $5.2 million contract extension with an annual average of $2.6 million. On 16 December 2019, Nilsson was placed on injured reserve due to a concussion. He missed the rest of the season.\nWith a year remaining on his contract, approaching the delayed 2020–21 season, Nilsson was traded by the Senators along with the contract of Marián Gáborík to the Tampa Bay Lightning in exchange for Braydon Coburn, Cédric Paquette and a 2022 second-round pick on 27 December 2020. However, Nilsson ultimately never played a game for Tampa Bay, and, after missing the entire 2020–21 season with post-concussion symptoms and neck problems, announced his retirement on 8 August 2021.\nInternational play.\nNilsson represented Sweden at the 2010 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships which were held in Saskatchewan, Canada. He only played in one game during the tournament, as Jacob Markström was the starter. Sweden won a bronze medal at the tournament. He won a gold medal with Team Sweden at the 2018 IIHF World Championship.\nPersonal life.\nNilsson is married to Emelie Nevanperä and they have one child together. Nilsson has another son from a previous relationship with Fernanda Nilsson. Nevanperä also has a child from a previous relationship. On 8 November 2017, Nilsson announced the birth of his son and second child.\nNilsson is an open supporter of the LGBT+ community. While with the Buffalo Sabres, he became the first NHL goaltender to put a rainbow flag on his mask."

Since then there have been a total of 103 games played, resulting in 60 wins for France, 40 wins for Scotland and 3 draws, as of February 2024.\nDuring rugby union's amateur era, the overall history of the fixture was relatively even – up to the end of the 1995 Rugby World Cup the sides had met 67 times with France winning 33 games and Scotland 31. Since then there has been a marked shift in favour of France, who have won 27 of the 36 matches between the teams since 1996.\nScotland and France play each other at least once a year, as both participate in the Six Nations Championship, and its predecessor competitions. In 2018 a new trophy, the Auld Alliance Trophy, was inaugurated to be presented to the winner of the Six Nations fixture each year. Apart from their annual match, currently part of the Six Nations Championship, the teams have also met in five warm-up matches prior to the 2015, 2019 and 2023 World Cups, with France winning on three occasions and Scotland two. \nBreakdown.\nAt the Rugby World Cup (RWC), the two teams have played each other on three occasions: the first edition (1987) in Pool 4, hosted by New Zealand; the first (and thus far only) RWC played in South Africa (1995); and finally the 2003 Rugby World Cup played in Australia. The first encounter, in 1987, was a draw (20–20). And in fact was the only draw for that RWC. The second RWC encounter was a close game, with France coming out victorious, 22–19. The third and final encounter was in the 2003 RWC. However, unlike the previous two fixtures, the result was a blowout. France won by forty-two points and kept Scotland try-less. All fixtures were played in the pool stage of the tournament. In all cases France would eventuate into the semi-finals of the tournament. In total France scored ninety-three points against Scotland at the RWC; Scotland forty-eight.\nIn the Five Nations Championship (1910–1999), France and Scotland played on sixty-nine occasions, France edging the two teams' encounters thirty-four to thirty-three (two matches being drawn). Overall in these matches, France scored 756 points, and Scotland 819.\nIn the Six Nations Championship (2000–present), the two sides have met twenty-five times. France have won the duel twenty times, with Scotland only having won against France five times in the competition. In these matches, France have scored 504 points; Scotland 330.\nStarting in 2015 France and Scotland have played a one- or two-test warm-up fixture in the lead up to the Rugby World Cup. With the exception of the first meeting in 2019 all encounters have been very close results. However France hold the lead again in these instances, having won three of the five meetings.\nResults.\nThe matches played between France and Scotland are:"

        "text": "Metropolitan Swimming (MR) is the governing body for competitive swimming in the New York Metropolitan Area. It is an LSC member of USA Swimming and the Eastern Zone. Most of the athletes who compete in Metro-sponsored swim meets are youths under the age of 18. However, there are also opportunities for older members of the swimming community to compete.\nLocation.\nMetro is one of the 59 sub-divided areas by the National Governing Board, which is USA Swimming. The area that Metro covers is New York City, Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, Rockland, Dutchess, Orange, Putnam, and Sullivan Counties in New York State.\nAthlete Members.\nNearly 10,000 individuals are registered Metro athlete members, one of the largest in all areas of USA Swimming. These athletes compete across approximately 75 different swim clubs in about as many facilities. The level of competition across the clubs varies greatly, from recreational swimming to Olympians. Some of the notable athletes who have come from Metro include Cristina Teuscher, Jenny Thompson, Julia Smit, Lia Neal, Philip Scholz, and Rick Carey.\nClub Members.\nThere are 75 swim teams registered as members of Metropolitan Swimming.\nCompetitions and Events.\nMetro sanctions about 115 swimming competitions per year. Most of these are competed in Short Course Yards, then Long Course Meters, and one Open Water Championship.\nSilver Championship.\nThe 2014 Metro Silver Championships are held on March 1 to March 3, 2014 at various locations depending on Metro section (Northern, Central, Southern, etc.). Junior Olympic cuts can be achieved here, but awards are given to only Silver swimmers and JO qualifiers will not receive awards. Any faster swimmer faster than the JO or as fast are not permitted.\nAge Group Championship (formerly Junior Olympics).\nThe 2014 Metropolitan Junior Olympics will stretch across the entire MR LSC or area, and in 2013 this year be held at Nassau County Aquatic Center hosted by Long Island Aquatic Club from March 15 through 17th. All swimmers from Metro are allowed to attend within the Metropolitan LSC.\nThis meet is considered one of the top meets for the 10 and under and 11-12 age groups. A notable performance at the recent Junior Olympics Championships was that of Nick Torres, who swept all of the individual events in the 11-12 age group. Also, the dominating Team Suffolk 11-12 boys 400 medley relay broke a Metropolitan Record. On that relay was Justin Meyn, Nikolas Daly, Kabir Randhawa, and Dylan Champagne.\nZone Team Qualifier.\nThe 2013 Zone Team Qualifier takes place at Lehman College, Bronx and will invite all or most Metropolitan teams. Cuts are faster than Junior Olympics and Zone Qualifier (ZQ) times must be achieved before. The Zone Team is decided by top swimmers of each event, and maximum speed cuts for 13 and over are looked over.\nEastern Zone Championship.\nSwimmers on the Metropolitan Zone Team compete among other Eastern Zone LSCs, and will be held this year in Buffalo, NY\nSenior Metropolitan Championship.\nThe Senior Metropolitan (Sr Mets) Championships is an open meet, and swimmers of any age and speed are allowed to attend. It is held this season in SCY at Lehman College APEX, Bronx on February 21 to February 23, 2013 and includes open relays.\nMetro Zone Team.\nThe Metropolitan Zone Team represents Metropolitan Swimming at the Eastern Zone Championships. The co-head coaches are Edgar Perez and John Yearwood. \nSelection for the short course Metro Zone team is based on the Metropolitan Zone Team Qualifier meet held at Lehman College in Bronx, NY. At this meet, the top three 9-10 and 11-12 swimmers in each event qualify for the Metro Zone team. The top two 13-14 and 15-18 swimmers in each event also qualify for the Metro Zone team. \nSelection for the long course Eastern Zone Championships is based on a qualifying time.\nGovernance.\nThe Metro LSC is run by its board of directors, elected by the House of Delegates."

        "title": "World Golf Tour",
        "text": "World Golf Tour (abbreviated WGT Golf and WGT by Topgolf) is an online multiplayer virtual golf game. It is played virtually on actual golf courses located in the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Canada and Mexico, using a patented 3D photorealistic georeferencing technology. Players can play with their family or friends, join a foursome, or start their own game. Players can choose and compete in a variety of virtual golf courses with up to four players at a time, play individually or enter into a skills challenge or in tournaments for prizes.\nCo-founders of WGT Media Chad Nelson and YuChiang Cheng collaborated in 2006 to come up with a high-quality golf game simulation that could be played for free on the Internet, and compete with or surpass the visual quality of console video sports games. Part of the intended goal was to have a fully integrated social golfing network website. They recruited JF Prata and Phil Gorrow of Electronic Arts to build the physics game engine that interfaces the thousands of photographs of each golf course that are used to create the \"WGT Golf\" experience. WGT Media launched a demo of the site in 2007 and commenced an open beta test in October 2008. The first golf course WGT Media captured and developed for play was the Ocean Course at Kiawah Island Golf Resort, located in South Carolina.\nBecause of its authenticity in photographing and using actual golf courses for game development, \"WGT Golf\" differs from standard console video sports games that are produced fully by computer graphics, rendered by animators. Using this particular process of game development, it can allow real golfers to play virtually on real golf courses at \"WGT Golf\" and then take that knowledge and experience out to the actual golf courses themselves to test their skills and ability. Members of the PGA have even practiced at \"WGT Golf\" before going to tournaments.\nWGT Media does not charge a fee to play the HD courses it has developed (although there is a green fee for licensed non-HD courses). WGT Media derives revenue from high-profile online tournament sponsors, advertisements, and in-game micro transactions for upgrading player golfing equipment and for different choices in costume avatar clothing. Tournament cash prizes can be won and then used to buy virtual goods, like new clubs and clothing to customize the in-game avatar.\nIn January 2011, a foursome completed the 100 millionth virtual round of golf played on \"WGT Golf\". In October 2013, World Golf Tour Media released the mobile version for tablets and smartphones.\nGame development.\n\"WGT Golf\" is developed using Adobe Creative Suite 4 Web Premium software. WGT Media starts the process of game development by taking thousands of high definition photos of actual golf courses using helicopters equipped with cameras and GPS tracking systems. WGT Media then textures the photographs onto the 3D environment, using Adobe Premiere Pro to determine how each of the different surfaces will have an effect on the ball. The terrain is within 1-1.5 inch vertical accuracy of the real world. Computer animation, using Adobe Flash CS4 Professional, is then used to create the avatars that are used as the golfer for each player.\nTo replicate how the golf ball reacts to the club swing, rolls across the green, or bounces down the fairway, WGT Media ran various tests to measure impact and collision data. The data were then entered into WGT's newly created game physics engine to determine how each player's golf swing would affect ball travel based on input by the player.\nLastly Adobe Flash is then used to stream audio and video together for a seamless transition from picture to picture during game play, as a player moves down the fairway or makes a putt.\nTiers and levels.\n\"WGT Golf\" players are assigned to \"tiers\" reflecting their skill. From lowest to highest, the tiers are Hack, Amateur, Pro, Tour Pro, Master, Tour Master, Legend, Tour Legend, Champion and Tour Champion.\nPlayers advance from one tier to the next based on their current scoring average and number of rounds played at their current tier. Players are challenged at each successive tier by facing standard playing conditions featuring longer tees and/or faster greens. Players can only rise; players cannot retreat from that tier to a lower one even if the average score rises. Certain tournaments on the site are open only to players in certain tiers, and in some competitions between players of different tiers the players play from different sets of tees depending on each player's tier.\nAccording to player research on the site, as of October 2011 there were over 1,900 \"WGT Golf\" players who had advanced to the Legend tier.\nApart from tiers, players are also assigned to \"levels\" which chiefly reflect the amount of play rather than the player's skill. Players \"level up\" by earning \"experience points,\" which are based on playing games in certain formats, playing on consecutive days, winning awards and so on. The number of experience points required to rise to the next level increases dramatically as higher levels are reached. Levels are important to players because certain virtual golf equipment may be purchased by players only when they reach a certain level, with the equipment available to higher-level players generally being of higher quality (e.g. clubs that hit the ball farther and more accurately).\nGolf courses developed for play at \"WGT Golf\".\nClosest-to-the-hole challenges (9 holes, or in some cases two different sets of 9 holes each).\nNetherlands.\nClosest-to-the-hole challenges can also be played on each of the courses that are available for full stroke play.\nFuture courses.\nIn line with its USGA tie-in, WGT Media has published a preview of the new courses that will be launched on the site in conjunction with the upcoming locations for the U.S. Open: Winged Foot (2020).\nIn WGT's tie-in with The R&amp;A for The Open Championship, it may release further courses in the rota in future years, but so far no long-range commitment between WGT Media and The R&amp;A has been announced.\nCriticism and cheating.\nThere has always been criticism from some of WGT's playerbase, a portion of which is aimed at WGT Media's business model and the 'jumpy meter'. The meter, a moving bar used to give the desired direction to the shot, is often disturbingly 'jumpy' (as non-fluid) and results in a considerable disruption of the gaming experience. Some players speculate that it is left unpatched by WGT to further encourage microtransactions for better equipment; which, while alleviating some of the game's difficulty, can cost upwards of US$20.00 for a single club.\nAnother concern has been 'sandbagging,\" an ongoing issue of skilled players artificially lowering their average score. This practice is used to compete in tournament brackets far below the skill level of the \"sandbagger\", thus giving them a better chance to place high and win in-game credits at the expense of the other players.\nFinally, quitting the game before completion has been a concern since the early years of WGT. It typically occurs when a player is performing poorly and decides to abandon the game, so as to preserve their average score. Players have repeatedly called for WGT to reduce a person's score when they habitually quit as a deterrent to this behavior. In an attempt to remedy these concerns a 'reputation indicator' was introduced, showing players the percentage of finished games of others before the round is started. The advent of challenge games, which require an amount of non-redeemable credits to be put upfront, and which are lost if the player leaves, has also discouraged quitting. Nonetheless, some in the community still call for some sort of punishment to a quitter's score, despite the fact that quitting forfeits a match for the offender and has no negative impact on the score of other players.\nPartners and the World Wide Web.\nWGT Media enters into license agreements with real golf courses and tournament owners such as the United States Golf Association (USGA) and The R&amp;A. WGT has also made agreements with equipment providers and other companies including TruGolf, Taylor Made, Adams Golf, Ping, Lynx, Nike, Snake Eyes Golf, Cleveland, Callaway, Titleist, Srixon, Loudmouth Golf, American Express, Sky Golf, Adidas Golf, Ketel One vodka, Lexus, Old Granddad bourbon, and Pilsner Urquell.\nThe United States Golf Association (USGA) partnered with WGT Media in 2009 to co-host the first annual Virtual USGA Championship online. The Virtual U.S. Open attracted hundreds of thousands of players from more than 180 countries, and by its third year, over 2 million qualifying rounds were played. The event was won by Wayne Stopak (aka NASAgolfer), with a final round 66 on Bethpage Black. Stopak received a replica of the US Open trophy and a trip for two to Pebble Beach for the 2010 US Open. A similar competition was held in 2010, using the Oakmont course that hosted the Women's Open. One of \"WGT Golf\"'s dominant players, BolloxInBruges, won a trip to the 2011 US Open, at Congressional. He shot rounds of 61–63. The 2011 Virtual U.S. Open at Congressional, May–June 2011, was won by mrenn29 with final-round scores of 64 and 57. The 2012 Virtual U.S. Open at The Olympic Club was won by StoneColdKiller, winner of the 2011 Virtual Open Championship at Royal St. George's, with record-low rounds of 57–55.\nIn 2010, the first Virtual Open (British) Championship 2010 was held at St. Andrews. It was won by AvatarLee, with rounds of 58 and 63, for a golfing trip to Scotland. The 2011 Virtual Open Championship at Royal St. George's, in June–July 2011, was won by StoneColdKiller, with rounds of 58 and 61.\n\"WGT Golf\" can also be launched and played from a number of online organizations including USGA.org, ESPN.com and Facebook. Social networking apps can also be added to anyone's Facebook home page to let family and friends know where you play virtual golf, read blog entries about your latest game, and track your golfing statistics. \"WGT Golf\" allows a player to post their own replays of their best 10 shots they've taken in the past. External voice chat communications programs, for example Ventrillo, Team Speak, Skype and Roger Wilco, can be used to communicate with other players, while playing golf at WGT Golf, making it easier to communicate with other players."

He was the son of Gurney Turner (1813–1848) and Mary Anne Hamilton Mowatt. His paternal grandfather, after whom he was named, was Dawson Turner (1775–1858), the banker and botanist, and he got his middle name from his paternal grandmother, Mary Palgrave (1774–1850).

At each event several tasks are flown to establish the overall classification.\nThe goal of each competition task is to fly round a predetermined course with a start, some turn points (usually 4-6) and a finish line. Slightly simplified, the winner is the fastest pilot round the course, or the pilot who flew furthest if no one completes the course. Pilots carry a GPS receiver to record their flight track, which is afterwards used to verify that they correctly followed the course and determine timings.\nSince 2009, there is one event at the end of every year called \"PWC Superfinal\". The best pilots selected from the events all over the year compete to select the overall winner of the year. Before 2009 the total winner was determined by adding the results of all worldcups of the year."

Its mountain terrain is difficult because the ball often breaks in the opposite direction from what golfers are expecting. The signature hole is the 14th, a 435-yard, par 4, which is located at the highest point on the course and offers a view of the course and the surrounding valley. The elevated tee plays downhill and then requires an uphill approach to the elevated green, which slopes to the left and is protected by sand on the right and large bumps on the left side."

        "text": "Lancaster John O'Gaunt Rowing Club (JOG) is an English rowing club based at Lancaster on the River Lune. Its origins date back to 1842 making it the fifth oldest surviving rowing club in the United Kingdom outside the universities.\nHistory.\nLancaster Rowing Club was first founded in 1842 by the architect and engineer Edmund Sharpe. with the help of his partner Edward Graham Paley.\nSharpe lived in one of the largest riverside houses at Halton Hall and owned two 4-oared cutters, the 'Ariadne' and the 'Lotus', which he made over to the new rowing club for £40 on 20 September 1842.\nAt the 1865 general election there were allegation of political bribery concerning members of the Lancaster Rowing Club. After a Royal Commission's investigation in 1867 the original Lancaster Rowing Club had ceased to exist and two new clubs were established: a new Lancaster Rowing Club (Tory) and John O'Gaunt Rowing Club (Liberal).\nUp to 1876 the Lancaster Rowing Club, with subscriptions as high as £70 saw increasing success and the boathouse was paid for. However John O'Gaunt Rowing Club on the other side of the river was less successful and had to remove their boats from their building as rental was too high. It was then that James Williamson, 1st Baron Ashton a leader of Lancaster's newfound manufacturing prosperity, came to the rescue. He bought all the riverside property on part of which stood the boathouse and leased the land and building to the club for 2/6d. (12.5p) per annum.\nBy 1931 the fortunes of the two Clubs had reversed as the Lancaster RC building needed refurbishment and without the benefit of a benefactor the committee were 'unanimously of the opinion that under present conditions it is impossible to carry on'. The Lancaster Rowing Club then made all its stock available to JOG.\nAssociated clubs and organisations.\nLancaster Schools' Rowing Association (LSRA) was first founded in 2010. The club was formed to enhance the rowing provision available to under-18s in Lancaster and the surrounding area. Facilities, equipment and coaching staff would primarily be provided by JOG. In the first two years British Rowing, Henley Stewards' and Lancaster and Morecambe College provided additional coaching staff, this was later taken over by JOG. Partner schools would provide land-based facilities and recruitment opportunities.\nLancaster University Boat Club was first founded in 1964. They used JOG's facilities up until 1966 when they moved to the newly renovated station building at Halton.\nLancaster Royal Grammar School Boat Club (LRGSBC) was first founded in 1948.\nThey were tenants of JOG from 1985 to 2011. In 2011 LRGSBC relocated to Halton Army Training Camp.\nLancaster Rowing Development Group was set up in 2014 with the primary aim of developing rowing in Lancaster. Organisations sitting on the group included:\nFacilities.\nJOG has a boathouse located by Skerton.\nOn 5 December 2015 the building was flooded to the greatest extent in living memory (approximately 2 inches into the first floor). As a result of the flood considerable damage to boats meant that more than half of the fleet was either sent for repair or written off. By late 2016 the fleet was back up to full strength and works to improve the building were nearly completed. As a result of the flood a flood action plan was developed; this included storing boats off site from November to February and fast flood response to environment agency flood warnings.\nMembers.\nMembership is open to all except for those that have been refused membership of British Rowing.\nHonorary club members:"

        "text": "The Pakistan cricket team toured England from 29 July to 22 September 2010. The tour consisted of four Tests, two Twenty20s (T20) and five One Day Internationals (ODIs). The first Test of the series, at Trent Bridge, was the 900th Test match to be played by England.\nTest series.\nFourth Test.\nAfter being put into bat by Pakistan, England were reduced to 102 for 7 on the second day. Jonathan Trott and Stuart Broad then put on a world record score for the eighth wicket with a partnership of 332.\nBetting allegations.\nOn the third day of the 4th Test, British newspaper \"News of the World\" published a story with allegations that an agent loosely affiliated with some of the Pakistani players (later identified as Mazhar Majeed) had accepted a £150,000 (US$232,665) bribe from undercover reporters for information that two Pakistani bowlers (Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir) would deliberately deliver no-balls at specific points during the match, information which could be used by gamblers to make wagers with inside information (a process known as spot-fixing, compared with match fixing to predetermine a match result).\nIn the video posted by \"News of the World\", Majeed, counting out the bribe money, predicted that Amir would be Pakistan's bowler for the third over, and that the first ball of that over would be a no-ball delivery. Amir did bowl the third over, and on his first delivery from the over, bowled a no-ball delivery. Commentary described the delivery as a \"massive overstep\", a good half-metre beyond the popping crease following the television replay of the delivery. Majeed also predicted that the sixth delivery of the tenth over would be a no-ball, and the ball, delivered by Asif, was also a no-ball delivery.\nAs a result of the allegations and video posted by \"News of the World\", Scotland Yard announced during the evening that they had arrested Majeed on charges of suspicion of conspiracy to defraud bookmakers. Two days later, after the Test match had completed, three more arrests were made (two unidentified men and an unidentified woman) on money laundering charges in connection with the allegations. Police also seized the cell phones of Asif, Amir, and Salman Butt as part of their investigations.\nYawar Saeed, the Pakistan team manager insisted after the conclusion of the test series that the T20 series and the ODI series will be played. He also refused to say that Butt should resign as Test captain.\nOn 1 November 2011, Asif, Amir and Butt were found guilty for their part in the spot-fixing and were given prison sentences, ranging from six months to 30 months.\nTwenty20 series.\nFollowing the betting allegations, Mohammad Asif, Mohammad Amir and Salman Butt were eventually dropped from the Twenty20 and One day squads at the players' request. They had not been suspended, and three players would be called up to replace them. This followed several days where the PCB refused to drop or suspend the players from the rest of the tour, even after England requested that the trio sit out the rest of the tour.\nOn 2 September 2010, after the warm-up List A game between Pakistan and Somerset, the International Cricket Council announced that they had suspended Asif, Amir and Butt under the provision of the ICC's Anti-Corruption Code. The statement from the ICC stated that the three players were charged \"under various offenses under Article 2 of the ICC Anti-Corruption Code for Players and Player Support Personnel relating to alleged irregular behavior during, and in relation to, the fourth Test between England and Pakistan at Lord's last month\"."

The Camp Lewis football team represented the US Army.\nGame notes.\nAccording to the Tournament of Roses, \"Within weeks of the 1918 Rose Bowl Game, the majority of the players from both teams were scheduled to go overseas. John Beckett, left tackle for Mare Island, acknowledged this fact and said that “this would be the last battle that we would fight in the name of sports.\"\nHugo Bezdek was the coach to lead two separate schools (Oregon in 1917 and Mare Island in 1918) to victories. He also led Penn State to an appearance in the 1923 Rose Bowl.\nDick Romney, who had been a football star at Utah, played halfback for the Camp Lewis team, scoring the team's only touchdown."

But after his all-star team recognition at the Las Vegas Nationals earned him an offer from a 2000–01 Michigan State Spartans men's basketball team that was graduating five seniors, the Spartans felt like a much better fit for him because of the likelihood of immediate playing time. Hill joined a signing class with Kelvin Torbert (the nation's number 2 prospect) and Alan Anderson. Michigan State head coach Tom Izzo described Hill as the school's first pure shooter since Shawn Respert had graduated in 1995.\nAs a senior, Hill missed a pair of games that his school lost due his having mononucleosis. That team finished 21–6 after losing in the state semifinals (dubbed the semistate championship).\nCollege career.\nOn January 27, 2003, he was named the Big Ten Conference Player of the Week. During the previous week, he had had two 20-point performances. A month later on February 23, he set the past Big Ten Conference record for single-game three point shots made (10). The record remained unmatched until Jon Diebler tied it on March 1, 2011. Bryn Forbes finally surpassed the mark on March 2, 2016. Hill led the Big Ten in three point shots made. He was co-MVP of the 2002–03 Michigan State Spartans men's basketball team. Hill was a 2003 third team Academic All-America selection. Hill was a 2003 second team All-Big Ten selection.\nHill repeated as the Big Ten three point shots made leader for the 2003–04 Spartans, joining Shawn Respert, Louis Bullock, Craig Moore, and Jon Diebler as two-time leaders.

Hill was a 2004 second team All-Big Ten selection.\nIn 2005, he was named the Men's Basketball Academic All-American of the Year. Hill served as captain for the 2004–05 Spartans who reached the final four of the 2005 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament where they lost on April 2 to the eventual champions, North Carolina. Hill scored 3 points in the game on 1–6 (1–5 3 point) shooting. , he was one of four three-time Academic All-Americas in Big Ten Conference history and the only multiple Academic All-American in Michigan State history. During Hill's Spartan career, he led the team in 3-point shots made 4 times, assists and steals 3 times and scoring once.\nHe was selected as a member of the United States men's national basketball team for the 2003 Pan-American Games and earned the Michigan State Freshman Student-Athlete of the Year in 2002. \"Sports Illustrated\" reported his natural position as point guard and noted he was an excellent golfer.\nProfessional career.\nHill played for ALM Évreux Basket of the French Pro B in 2005–06. He then played for Stade Clermontois BA of the French Pro A in 2006–07, and Bandırma Banvit of Turkish Basketball League for the following year. For the 2008–09 season, Hill joined Liège Basket of the Basketball League Belgium. He continued in Belgium for the next three seasons with Spirou Charleroi, winning the Belgian National Championship in 2009–10 and 2010–11.

        "text": "Tom Johnson (born May 24, 1963 in Syracuse, New York) is the former head coach at the University of Wyoming. Johnson took over Wyoming's swimming and diving program in April, 1998, replacing Mark Miller.\nCoaching career.\nEarly Years At Wyoming.\nJohnson inherited a swimming and diving program that was consistently in the bottom half of the Mountain West Conference. With a small budget and limited equipment, Johnson relied on recruiting and smart coaching to improve his teams. From 2000-2004, neither the Cowboys nor the Cowgirls finished higher than 4th place at the conference championships. Unsatisfied, Johnson continued recruiting better talent and hired a full-time diving coach to improve that aspect of the program. Has two kids: Alexandra E. Johnson, and Tommy Johnson\n2004 Olympic Games.\nIn 2001, Johnson recruited a talented, but not yet peaked, swimmer from Grand Island, Nebraska, named Scott Usher. Usher specialized in the 100 and 200 yard breaststroke, and quickly rose to break the school and Mountain West Conference records in both events. Johnson coached Usher to the 2004 U.S. Olympic Trials, where Usher qualified to represent the United States in the 200 breaststroke during the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece. At the Olympic Games, Usher placed 7th, becoming the first Wyoming Cowboy to ever represent the U.S. in the Olympics.\nCurrent Teams.\nThe Wyoming Cowgirls have improved their conference standing by one position each year since 2004, finishing the 2010 season in 2nd place. The Cowboys improved to a school-record 3rd-place finish at the end of the 2009 season.\n2010-2011 Men's Team finished the season 6-5 (2-3) in MWC and the women were 11-4 and (5-3) in the MWC, both teams finished the season 3rd at the MWC Championships. Four Corbett pool records were broken by Cowgirls Kelsey Conci in 100 Freestyle and 100 Backstroke and Allie Smith on 1 m and 3 m diving. Two were broken by Cowboy diver Mark Murdock on 1 m and 3 m diving.\nCowgirl swimmer Kelsey Conci went on the 2011 NCAA Swimming and Diving Championships where she competed in the 50 freestyle, the 100 Freestyle and the 100 Backstroke. She place 10th in the 100 Backstroke leading the team to a 38th-place finish, and became the first women swimmer at Wyoming to score at the NCAA Championships in 19 years. Cowboy diver Mark Murdock also competed in the 2011 NCAA Championships in 1 m diving, 3 m diving and Platform. Mark placed 12th in Platform diving, an event that the University does not even have a Platform for divers to practice. Mark lead the men to 31st-place finish at those Championships.\nMWC meet\nWomen -2 Mountain West Conference champions in Kelsey Conci 100 Back, and Lesley Young in the 100 and 200 Breast as well as the 200 Medley Relay. Nine athletes were MWC All-Conference in 21 events and in three relays. The women had one NCCA “A” qualifier and had six women with NCAA “B” cuts in 14 events and 4 relays. At the meet the women broke 14 new school records and had 47 swims in the top ten times all-time.\nMen -One MWC champion -Mark Murdock in 3 m diving and Platform Diving, 11 athletes were MWC All-conference performers in 22 events the team had 4 men with NCAA “B” cuts in eight events and 3 relays 200 MR, 400 MR and 800 Free Rel. The men had 2 new school records and 28 swims in the top ten all-time.\nOver the summer of 2011, Kelsey Conci picked up US Olympic Team Trial qualifying times in the 50 Freestyle and the 100 Backstroke, Morgan Hartigan picked up the 100 Breaststroke. Brandon Fischer picked up the 100 and 200 Breaststroke and the 200 Individual Medley. Incoming freshman Jordan Turner picked up a Trials cut in the 200 Breaststroke."

        "title": "Rugby union match officials",
        "text": "Rugby union match officials are responsible for enforcing the laws of rugby union during a match. \"Every match is under the control of match officials who consist of the referee and two touch judges or assistant referees.\" Further officials can be authorised depending on the level and form of the game.\nHistory.\nWhen the game of rugby union was developed at Rugby school, there were no official rugby referees. It was not until many years later when the game began to spread internationally that an official was included.\nBefore the creation of rugby referees, the captains from both teams would set the rules down before the game began. The two captains would arbitrate the game together as it went on. This is where the ‘advantage’ law comes from in rugby union. This was because a team’s captain was not likely to complain or stop play if his side benefited from the other team’s infringement.\nIn 1892, the International Rugby Board was created as a result of a disputed try as the captains could not agree on whether it had been scored. The rugby laws were changed to require one referee and two touch judges at each game to make the arbitration easier and more consistent.\nSince then the match officials' job has been broadly unchanged. The main changes have been:\nEquipment.\nCompulsory equipment.\nRugby union match officials must use the following equipment:\nOther common equipment.\nRugby union match officials may use the following equipment:\nPositions and responsibilities.\nReferee.\nPre-match.\nBefore the game, a referee must:\nDuring the match.\nThe duties of the referee during the game are:\nAfter the match.\nAfter the game a referee is required to:\nReferee's signals.\nThe referee having made a decision is required to indicate the decision by blowing the whistle and signalling. \nPrimary signals relate to what decision is being awarded. For example, whether a scrum or penalty is awarded. \nSecondary signals relate to why the decision is being awarded. For example, a knock-on (scrum) or a high tackle (penalty).\nThere are also signals for stoppages in time, replacement and scoring to ensure everyone knows what is happening.\nTouch judge and assistant referee.\nAssistant referees are appointed by the union in charge of the fixture. They are either themselves qualified referees or qualified assistant referees. Assistant referees may be asked to help with duties that touch judges cannot. Touch judges are normally supplied by the teams playing, one from each team.\nDuring the match.\nDuring the game touch judges and assistant referees must:\nAdditional responsibilities of assistant referees:\nAfter the match.\nA touch judge has no responsibilities after a match. The only responsibility an assistant referee has is to complete a written report to send to the referee that is then sent to the union in charge of the game. The report is only required if a player has been sent off or temporarily suspended because of their report on foul play.\nTouch judge and assistant referees signals.\nThe touch judges and assistant referees cannot stop play, but can signal the referee to enable them to assist him.\nTelevision match official (TMO).\nOften referred to as the \"TMO\", a television match official may be appointed to assist the referee in determining whether points have been scored or foul play has been committed. A television match official can only rule on exactly what the referee asks them; however, they can direct the referee's attention to foul play by speaking to him through his earpiece. Television match officials are commonly used in first-class and international televised games.\nSubstitution controller.\nAt higher levels of rugby, some games have appointed substitution controllers (sometimes called the \"fourth official\" and \"fifth official\"). These officials liaise with the teams and ensure they only use their permitted number of substitutions. They also indicate to the referee when a substitute is ready to come on. They often use signs with the numbers of the player coming off and the player going on the field, so this is one less thing for the referee to worry about. If an assistant referee is injured then one of the substitution controllers will take the place of the assistant referee.\nTimekeeper.\nA timekeeper may also be appointed to indicate to the referee when they believe a half should end. Ultimately, it is up to the referee to decide.\nIn-goal judge.\nIn-goal judges are used in the seven-a-side variation of rugby union to assist the referee in awarding a try and signalling kicks at goal instead of the assistant referees. In-goal judges are not required in a game where a TMO is present.\nReferee assaults.\nOne study found that around 6% of United Kingdom referees surveyed had been physically assaulted. A further examination of the study found that rugby union referees' fear of being assaulted was a significant factor for increased stress. The same study found that rugby referees were most concerned about being assaulted by a spectator or coach. A study by Rainey and Hardy found that it was in fact players who committed assaults on referees the most, contributing to 79% of all assaults on referees.\nAs a reaction to this rugby unions have begun handing out long bans and large fines to individuals who physically assault a referee, and more recently verbal assault of referees has also received severe punishments. Now the common punishment for a player punching a referee or anything similar is a lifetime ban. The laws of the game have also been changed to help this by making it compulsory for any official to report any abuse on them or another official to the union in charge of the fixture.\nAppointments.\nThe Union in charge of the fixture usually appoints the match officials. The IRB International Referees Panel appoints referees for international matches. Other major competitions such as Super Rugby, Heineken Cup and age group World Cups use a similar system.\nReferences.\nReferences to the \"Laws\" or a \"Law\" are to the \"Laws of the game: Rugby Union 2010\", published by the International Rugby Board, Dublin, Ireland."

        "title": "Baseball PEI",
        "text": "Baseball PEI is the provincial governing body for baseball in Prince Edward Island. It is a member of Baseball Canada and Baseball Atlantic.\nHistory of baseball on Prince Edward Island.\nBaseball was introduced to Prince Edward Island during the late 19th century and early 20th century, often by natives of Prince Edward Island who went to the United States to work, returning to or visiting Prince Edward Island. The first provincial championship was in 1896 when Charlottetown defeated the Pisquid club. After this point, the Maritime Amateur Athletic Association loosely organized provincial play-downs and championships to determine those teams representing Prince Edward Island at Maritime championships. On Prince Edward Island, organized and semi-organized leagues formed by the 1920s in various pockets of Prince Edward Island, especially in Kings County, Charlottetown, Summerside and western Prince County, and the health and popularity of these leagues ebbed-and-flowed through the pre- and post-war decades.\nIn 1964–65, the Prince Edward Island Amateur Baseball Association (PEIABA) was formed to take over the organizing of provincial play-downs and championships in order to determine the Prince Edward Island representatives at Maritime and National championships. Shortly after this time, the PEIABA began organizing county leagues. In 1969, the PEIABA took the responsibility of organizing and fielding a provincial representative for the quadrennial Canada Summer Games; and in 1989, also took on the responsibility of fielding the PEI Youth Selects, the Prince Edward Island representative at the Baseball Canada Cup. After this point, all teams that represented Prince Edward Island in a Maritime, Atlantic and National championship were determined by the PEIABA.\nBy the mid-1990s, the provincial government and other sectors required more organization from the PEIABA. On 12 September 1997, the PEIABA became a not-for-profit organization within the province of Prince Edward Island and changed its name to \"Baseball PEI\". Since that time, Baseball PEI has grown significantly. On top of running Elimination tournaments, provincial jamborees and championships, and fielding and organizing provincial teams, Baseball PEI now offers province-wide leagues from 9U/Junior Mosquito to 21U/Junior (with the Intermediate Kings County Baseball League also a member). Baseball PEI also is heavily involved with grassroots baseball; it assists associations with the set-up of Rally Cap and runs Rally Cap Jamborees. As well, Baseball PEI has the Summer Clinic Program, where teams and members of Baseball PEI can have two clinicians come out and run a clinic on a baseball skill (in 2018, there were 68 clinics run across Prince Edward Island).\nDue to Baseball PEI's efforts at the grassroots level, and its dedication to improving the skills and enjoyment of its members, it has been named Baseball Canada's \"Province of the Year\" in 2013 (in which it shared with Baseball Ontario) and in 2015.\nMission statement.\nBaseball PEI is a non-profit organization that continuously enables the development of baseball skills and knowledge among youth across Prince Edward Island.\nStructure.\nBoard of directors.\nBaseball PEI has a Board of Directors that makes rules, policies and procedures concerning the managing of affairs, discipline, and operation of Baseball PEI teams, associations and competitions. The Board of Directors of Baseball PEI is as follows: \nAssociations.\nThere are eleven minor baseball associations across Prince Edward Island that make up Baseball PEI:\n\"AAA\" zones.\nEach association is a member of one of four \"AAA\" zones across Prince Edward Island (each zone must have at least one \"AAA\" team in each age division each season).\nLeagues and competitions.\nBaseball PEI organizes and runs the following leagues:\nBaseball PEI organizes and runs the following Provincial Jamboree/Championship.\nGrassroots Programming.\nBaseball PEI is heavily invested with promoting grassroots development of players and coaches across Prince Edward Island. In the summer, their Summer Clinics Program runs clinics on hitting, throwing/pitching, fielding and other baseball fundamentals (as well as Rally Cap testing and the \"My First Pitch\" program) for teams and associations across Prince Edward Island. In 2018, there were 68 clinics ran across the province, mostly for players 11 and under, and in 2018, Baseball PEI hired three player clinicians. As well, Baseball PEI works very closely with its associations to offer the Rally Cap program, and runs Rally Cap jamborees in the latter part of August each year.\nOther grassroots programs offered by Baseball PEI are the Winterball program (in partnership with schools across Prince Edward Island to distribute and implement over the past 10 years) and the Challenger program (in partnership with the Stratford Minor Baseball Association; this program is designed for players with a physical and/or mental disability).\nProvincial teams.\nBaseball PEI organizes and fields the following provincial teams each year:\nPEIBUA.\nAll umpires used for Baseball PEI sanctioned-games are supplied by the Prince Edward Island Baseball Umpires' Association (the PEIBUA). The current Supervisor of Officials is Kent Walker. It is the PEIBUA's mandate to carry out all umpires' certification and recertification at the start of each season - usually in May - and to supply umpires for all Baseball PEI exhibition, tournament, regular season, Elimination and provincial championship games (as well as any Baseball Atlantic Championship games being held on Prince Edward Island)."

        "title": "Rugby Football Union of East Africa",
        "text": "The Rugby Football Union of East Africa (RFUEA) is an umbrella union for the Kenya Rugby Football Union, Tanzania Rugby Football Union and Uganda Rugby Football Union. It owes its existence to the fact that, prior to independence, Kenya, Tanzania (previously Tanganyika) and Uganda were either a protectorate or mandate of the British Empire. It now has little to do with the direct administration of the modern game but it continues to exist in order (in conjunction with the Rugby Patrons Society) to promote and support the game in the three countries, to facilitate club competition between the three unions and to administer the RFUEA Ground and the East Africa rugby union team.\nAt a recent meeting, the International Rugby Board (IRB) president, Bernard Lepasset has expressed support for taking the RFUEA out of mothballs so that it can be charged with running events like the Victoria Cup and the East African Super Series.\nRugby in East Africa before the RFUEA.\nTo fully understand the history of rugby in the three East African nations of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, it must first be understood that at the time the sport was introduced to the region these three countries were part of the British Empire. East Africa had been divided between the British and German colonial empires until the end of the First World War when the vast majority of German influence was handed to the British. Kenya, Uganda and Zanzibar had been under British influence since the late 19th and early 20th centuries, whilst Tanganyika was transferred to British control in 1919.\nThe Colony and Protectorate of Kenya, Tanganyika Territory the Protectorate of Uganda and the Protectorate of Zanzibar were regarded by the Empire as territories or provinces in much the same was as the colonies of the Cape, Natal, Transvaal and the Orange River Colony.\nClub and inter territorial rugby.\nThe first union in British East Africa was the Rugby Football Union of Kenya (RFU-K), founded in August 1921 (although it did not become effective until 1923 with the formation of the first two Nairobi clubs - Nondescripts RFC and Harlequins R.F.C.); it was responsible for the administration of the game throughout Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika which it carried out through various district sub-unions throughout the region.\nIncoming tours.\nSeveral universities and Royal Navy ships sent teams to tour East Africa prior to the Second World War. The first was H.M.S. Southampton (1922), closely followed by H.M.S. Colombo (1923) and then (frequently more than once over the next decade) His Majesty's Ships Cairo, Chatham, Effingham and Enterprise. This latter vessel was to provide a lasting memento of its visits by presenting the \"Enterprise Cup\" to the union in 1928; a trophy that has been the object of competition between clubs in the region ever since. The Combined South African Universities toured in 1929 and in 1935 Danie Craven captained Stellenbosch University on a tour of the region; though none of these encounters included a match against a representative East Africa team. The first representative team called East Africa, are recorded facing Cape Town University in 1949.\nThe formation of the RFUEA.\nIn 1953 the Rugby Football Union of East Africa (RFUEA) was created in order to take over the mantle as the umbrella organisation for rugby in the region. The creation of the RFUEA allowed for the formation of the Tanganyika Rugby Football Union (T.R.F.U.) in 1954 and Uganda Rugby Football Union (U.R.F.U.) in 1955. Each of these were essentially a sub-union of the RFUEA much as the district unions in Kenya were, so the RFU-K was dissolved in 1956 allowing the already existing district unions to deal directly with the RFUEA."

It is part of a larger club, the FT Adler Kiel, which also offers other sports like volleyball, table tennis and handball.\nThe term \"Adler\" is the German word for eagle.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nKiel rugby began in the 1930s, when the local shipyards workers and German Navy members, then called the \"Reichsmarine\", formed the \"1. Kieler Rugby Fussball Verein\".\nIn post-Second World War Germany, competitive rugby in Kiel resumed in 1949, when three local clubs competed in a league with clubs from Hamburg. The three clubs were the \"1. Kieler Rugby Fussball Verein\", \"PSV Kiel\" and \"FT Adler\". Rugby in Kiel greatly benefited from a strong support through the British Army, which was stationed at Kiel-Holtenau.\nTowards the end of the 1950s, Kiel rugby declined and the clubs were only able to field a combined team. In 1963, even this team had to be disbanded. As a form of farewell to rugby in Kiel, a final friendly match was organized. The match was against a team selected from a visiting detachment of the Japanese Navy. After this, rugby disappeared from the city for almost 30 years.\nCurrent club.\nRugby returned to Kiel in the late 1980s through the efforts of foreign students at the University of Kiel.

        "title": "Don Klosterman (American football)",
        "text": "Donald Clement Klosterman (January 18, 1930 – June 7, 2000) was a professional football executive. Regarded as one of the most accomplished in the sports’s history, he is known for building teams in three different leagues after his career as a professional quarterback was cut short by a serious accident that left his legs partially paralyzed. In the 1960s, Klosterman helped the American Football League (AFL, 1960–1969) overtake the National Football League (NFL) during the bidding wars that led the older league to seek a merger with the AFL. In the 1970s, he was a successful general manager for the NFL's Baltimore Colts and Los Angeles Rams, and in the 1980s he signed All-American quarterback Steve Young to a record contract for the Los Angeles Express in the United States Football League (USFL).\nEarly life and playing career.\nKlosterman was born of German American heritage in Le Mars, Iowa, the 12th of 15 children. As a youth, he moved to Compton, California with his family. He was collegiate football's leading passer in 1951, for Loyola University of Los Angeles, now Loyola Marymount University. Drafted by the Cleveland Browns, Klosterman found himself behind future Hall of Famer Otto Graham and was traded to the Los Angeles Rams, only to back up two more future Hall of Famers Norm Van Brocklin and Bob Waterfield. He turned to Canadian football, playing quarterback for the Calgary Stampeders until he had a skiing accident.\nKlosterman almost lost his life on a ski slope at Banff, Alberta on Saint Patrick's Day in 1957. He tried to avoid another skier, and damaged his spinal cord when he hit a tree. He had eight surgeries and was told he would never walk again, but he regained partial feeling and with the aid of a cane and walked again within a year.\nFootball executive career.\nIn 1960, Frank Leahy, the former head football coach at the University of Notre Dame, was the general manager of the AFL's Los Angeles Chargers. He asked Klosterman to help him recruit players. Klosterman joined the team and helped land future Hall of Famer Lance Alworth, along with Ernie Ladd, Ron Mix, John Hadl and Jack Kemp. He moved on to the AFL's Dallas Texans, and with them and their successors, the Kansas City Chiefs, he helped sign Hall of Famers Bobby Bell and Buck Buchanan, Pete Beathard, Mike Garrett and Otis Taylor, most of them important players in the Chiefs' win over the Minnesota Vikings in the fourth AFL-NFL World Championship Game. He guided the AFL's Houston Oilers to two playoff berths in his four years as their general manager (1966–1969). While in his office on November 26, 1968, he was confronted by pistol-wielding recently released wide receiver Charles Lockhart, who felt he was owed $13,000 by the Oilers. Scout Tom Williams succeeded in wrestling the gun away. Three months later Lockhart was sentenced to 90 days in jail for carrying a pistol. Klosterman declined to charge Lockhart with threatening his life.\nAfter his four‐year contract with the Oilers expired, Klosterman was hired on January 6, 1970, as general manager of the NFL Baltimore Colts, succeeding Harry Hulmes, who was demoted to an assistant position. The primary reason for the appointment was Klosterman's familiarity with the American Football League, the nucleus of the American Football Conference which the Colts were entering beginning with the 1970 NFL season. The Colts won Super Bowl V after his first season as GM.\nKlosterman was part of the transition to the Los Angeles Rams after Carroll Rosenbloom swapped franchises with Robert Irsay on July 13, 1972. Described as \"one of football's smoothest talkers and shrewdest dealmakers\" by Diane K. Shah of \"The New York Times\", he had also annually stockpiled excess draft choices that gave Los Angeles excellent trading leverage, according to Paul Attner of \"The Washington Post\". Four months after Georgia Rosenbloom inherited a 70-percent share in the ballclub upon the April 2, 1979 death of her husband, he replaced \nthe new majority owner's stepson Steve as executive vice president on August 16. The decision was the result of a power struggle between Klosterman, who was aligned with Georgia, and Steve, who had reassigned most of the general manager's responsibilities to director of player personnel Dick Steinberg. The relationship between Klosterman and the owner eventually deteriorated to the point that he was relegated to the figurehead role of assistant to the president-consultant and exiled from the team's facilities and games in his last two years with the Rams in 1982 and 1983. He had a personality conflict with Dominic Frontiere, Georgia's new husband at the time. He also had been scapegoated for a breach of contract lawsuit filed against the Rams by Fred Dryer who was placed on waivers by head coach Ray Malavasi prior to the 1981 season despite the team having picked up the $250,000 option on his contract.\nFollowing the end of the Rams’ 1983 season Klosterman was named general manager of the Los Angeles Express of the United States Football League (USFL) that December. His most notable transaction with the Express was signing Steve Young to a record-setting four-year contract worth in excess of $40 million on March 5, 1984. He was dismissed on July 4, 1985, in a cost-cutting measure by the USFL, which had been operating the franchise after previous owner J. William Oldenburg was forced to relinquish the team because of financial and legal issues in February of that year.

        "text": "The McGill Martlets ice hockey team represents McGill University, based in Montreal, Quebec in U Sports women's ice hockey. They are members of the Réseau du sport étudiant du Québec (RSEQ) and have won four U Sports women's ice hockey championships. Some players have participated internationally, including in the World Student Games. Home games are played at McConnell Arena.\nOrigin name.\nThe origin of name \"Martlet\" is used in reference to the coat of arms of McGill University, which includes three birds. These birds were originally a part of the family crest of James McGill, founder of the university. The McGill Martlet Foundation, created in 1954, uses this heraldic symbol. The foundation is a philanthropic organization aimed at helping student athletes at McGill. In 1976, various women's teams at McGill University adopted the use of the name \"Martlets\".\nHistory.\nSince 1896, women's ice hockey has existed at McGill University. In the early years of ice hockey play at McGill University, women dressed in long skirts and males were not allowed to attend. The only exceptions were the referee and the arena employees who guarded the main entrance. The ban was lifted a few years later.\nThe McGill women's ice hockey team participated in the first Women Provincial Ontario Championship in 1914. The university league was dissolved in 1933. From 1936 to 1948, followed by the time period of 1951 to 1960, there was no competition in the Women Interuniversity Athletics Union (WIAU).\nA renewal began in the 1960s. In 1963, David Kerr, a male member of the McGill Redmen, agreed to assist in the revival of the McGill women's ice hockey team. In 2006, Kerr and his wife Sheryl Drysdale (the couple met at McGill) donated $1 million for the hockey program. It is the largest donation ever made for a female sporting program in Canadian university history. The donation allowed the team's trainers to assume a full-time role with the team. In addition, the team was able to employ a scout for the Martlets in the recruitment of collegial players in Quebec.\nDespite winning the 1985 Quebec Championship, the Martlets only managed to reach the qualifying rounds only once in the next 13 years. A turnaround for the Martlets began with the arrival of goalkeeper Kim St-Pierre in 1998. Her performance during four seasons helped Martlets become competitive in the Quebec Student Sports Federation, while qualifying for the playoff rounds of the Canadian Interuniversity Sport women's ice hockey championship. Martlets goaltender Kim St. Pierre also played a game for the McGill Redmen. She was the first woman in Canadian Interuniversity Sports history to win a men's regular season game when McGill University defeated Ryerson University on November 15, 2003, by a score of 5–2. Overall, the Martlets have won ten QSSF championships and three Canadian Interuniversity Sport women's ice hockey championship.\n2006 and beyond.\nDuring the 2006–07 CIS season, the Martlets were ranked as the number one university team for the duration of the entire season. At the end of season, the Martlets were crowned Quebec champions and awarded a silver medal in the Canadian championships. In the CIS final, the Martlets were defeated by a 4–0 score versus the Alberta Pandas women's ice hockey club. Of note, 9 of their 21 players were rookies. The following season (2007–08), the Martlets enjoyed an undefeated season, with 33 wins. In the 2008 postseason, the Martlets (with a record of 7 victories, 0 defeats), claimed the national title on March 10, 2008, in Ottawa, with a 2–0 victory against the Laurier Golden Hawks women's ice hockey program.\nAt the end of the 2008–09 season, the Martlets were the national women's champions for the second consecutive year. In a rematch of the previous final, the Martlets defeat the Laurier Golden Hawks women's ice hockey team by a score of 3–1. The streak ended in the 2009–10 season, the Martlets appeared in the 2010 championship game, but were defeated by the Alberta Pandas by a 2–0 tally. Goaltender Charline Labonte and head coach Peter Smith were not with the club as they participated in the 2010 Vancouver Winter Games.\nIn the 2010–11 season, the Martlets won the QSSF and CIS titles. In addition, the Martlets enjoy another undefeated season with 33 victories and no losses. With their third Canadian championship in four years, the McGill Martlets hockey team become the most decorated in the history of McGill University. On October 1, 2011, the Martlets defeated the Vermont Catamounts women's ice hockey program by a 3–2 tally. With the win, coach Peter Smith earned the 300th victory of his coaching career. Twenty-eight days later (on October 29, 2011), Montreal Carabins women's ice hockey skater Ariane Barker scored with 71 seconds left to give the squad a 3–2 win at McConnell Arena. Martlets goaltender Charline Labonte took the loss for the Martlets, giving her a 69–2 overall record in her CIS career. It marked the Martlets first loss to a Quebec conference opponent for the first time in 108 games.\nThe Martlets and Montreal Hockey.\nIn August 2022, the Premier Hockey Federation (PHF) unveiled the newest expansion team for the 2022–23 season, the Montreal Force. In keeping with the Martlets longstanding history with Montreal women's hockey, several former Martlets members were signed to the new organisation including former head coach Peter Smith. He stepped into his role as head coach of the Force with four national championship victories with the Marlets under his belt. Jade Downie-Landry, Ann-Sophie Bettez, and Tricia Deguire, all former Marlets, also signed with the Force in 2022.\nAwards and honours.\nQuebec Hall of Fame.\nRSEQ All-Stars.\n\"First Team\"\n\"Second Team\"\nUSports Awards.\nAll-Canadians.\n\"First Team\"\n\"Second Team\"\nNotable Martlets.\nSeveral former McGill Martlets have gone on to become professional ice hockey players, including Ann-Sophie Bettez, Charline Labonté, Kim St-Pierre, and Catherine Ward.\nMartlets in professional hockey.\nFour former Marlets are playing with the Premier Hockey Federation's 2022 expansion team, the Montreal Force, in its debut season: Ann-Sophie Bettez, Tricia Deguire, Jade Downey-Landry, and Laura Jardin.\nInternational.\nA number of Martlets have represented Canada in international competition, including with the Canadian national ice hockey team at the Winter Olympic Games and IIHF Women's World Championship, with the Canadian national university team at the Winter Universiade, and with the Canadian national developmental (under-22) ice hockey team at the Nations Cup (previously known as the Air Canada Cup, MLP Nations Cup, and Meco Cup), among other international competitions."

        "text": "James Clayton Russell (born January 8, 1986) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He played college baseball at Navarro College and the University of Texas at Austin and was drafted by the Chicago Cubs in the 14th round of the 2007 Major League Baseball draft. Russell made his Major League Baseball (MLB) debut on April 5, 2010, and also played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Atlanta Braves and Philadelphia Phillies.\nHigh School career.\nRussell attended Colleyville Heritage High School, where he was a member of the school's baseball team. After his senior year, he was drafted by the Seattle Mariners in the 37th round of the 2004 Major League Baseball draft, but did not sign, instead deciding to attend Navarro College.\nCollege career.\nRussell was drafted again by the Seattle Mariners in the 17th round of the 2005 Major League Baseball draft, but he did not sign.\nRussell later attended the University of Texas at Austin, where he was a starting pitcher for the Texas Longhorns baseball team for one season after transferring from Navarro College. In his only season pitching for the Longhorns, Russell was named to the second team All-Big 12, while posting an 8–4 win–loss record and a 3.86 earned run average (ERA).\nProfessional career.\nChicago Cubs.\nRussell was drafted by the Chicago Cubs in the 14th round of the 2007 Major League Baseball draft. On August 9, Russell signed a contract worth $350,000 with the Cubs.\nAfter signing, Russell was assigned to the Arizona League Cubs, the Rookie-level affiliate of Chicago. However, after just one start in which he only threw two innings, he was called up to the Single-A Peoria Chiefs. He pitched in two games for the Chiefs, striking out nine batters and allowing just three hits in seven innings. With Peoria, Russell combined to throw a no-hitter on August 25, 2007.\nTo start 2008, Russell joined the High-A Daytona Cubs. On April 26, he earned his first win of the season against the Jupiter Hammerheads. Three days later, he was called up to the Double-A Tennessee Smokies. He would pitch most of the season with the Smokies before being sent back down to the Cubs for the playoffs. Combined, Russell went 6–8 with a 5.44 ERA and a 1.453 WHIP in 25 starts made.\nRussell began the 2009 season with Tennessee. He eventually converted to being a relief pitcher for the Smokies, instead of being a starter. After pitching 11 games for the Smokies, Russell was called up to the Triple-A Iowa Cubs. With Iowa, he was mainly a reliever, but also made seven starts for the Cubs. Between Tennessee and Iowa, Russell went 5–6 with a 4.03 ERA and a 1.403 WHIP in 37 games, including 12 starts. Following the season, he joined the Mesa Solar Sox, a team in the Arizona Fall League, which largely features players considered top prospects.\nIn 2010, Russell made the Cubs Opening Day roster after giving up no runs in 11 innings of work during spring training and debuted on opening day, April 5, with two scoreless innings against the Atlanta Braves. He became the 97th former Texas Longhorn to make his major league debut.\nIn 2010, Russell also helped extend Texas' streak of having a former player debut in the major leagues from eight consecutive seasons to nine. He made 20 appearances for the Cubs, going 0–1 with a 4.20 ERA before being optioned to Triple-A Iowa on June 12. However, after making just five appearances for Iowa, Russell was recalled by the Cubs on June 29, after Carlos Zambrano was placed on the restricted list and John Grabow went on the disabled list. He finished the season with a 1–1 record, a 4.96 ERA, and a 1.347 WHIP in 57 appearances for the Cubs. Following the season, the \"Chicago Tribune\" stated that the inclusion of Russell and three other inexperienced relievers in the Cubs' bullpen was one of the team's 10 biggest mistakes of the season.\nIn 2011, Russell made 64 appearances with a 1–6 record, a 4.12 ERA, and 1.33 WHIP. He improved in 2012, recording a 7–1 record, 3.25 ERA, and 1.298 WHIP in 77 games. Russell ended 2013 having pitched in 74 games with a 1–6 record, a 3.59 ERA, and 1.215 WHIP.\nAtlanta Braves.\nRussell and Emilio Bonifacio were traded to the Atlanta Braves for Víctor Caratini on July 31, 2014.

He made the Phillies opening day roster in 2016. He was designated for assignment on April 20.\nCleveland Indians.\nOn February 15, 2017, Russell signed a minor league contract with the Cleveland Indians, with an invitation to major league spring training. He was released on March 31, 2017.\nTexas AirHogs.\nRussell signed with the Texas AirHogs of the American Association for part of the 2017 season, before leaving to play in the Mexican League. He made 9 starts and went 3–1 with a 2.79 ERA with 46 strikeouts in 58 innings.\nLeones de Yucatán.\nOn July 7, 2017, Russell signed with the Leones de Yucatán of the Mexican Baseball League. He was released on January 9, 2018. \n He made 5 starts and went 1–0 with a 2.03 ERA with 27 strikeouts in 31 innings.\nDetroit Tigers.\nOn January 10, 2018, Russell signed a minor league contract with the Detroit Tigers. He was released on May 4, 2018.\nSugar Land Skeeters.\nOn May 29, 2018, Russell signed with the Sugar Land Skeeters of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. Russell and the Skeeters won the Atlantic League Championship and Russell was named the Skeeters Pitcher of the Year. He became a free agent following the 2018 season. He appeared in 20 games 18 starts and went 8–4 with a 2.36 ERA and 98 strikeouts in 106.2 innings.\nToros de Tijuana.\nOn April 3, 2019, Russell signed with the Toros de Tijuana of the Mexican League.

He was released on December 14, 2021. He made 7 starts and went 2–2 with a 3.67 ERA with 23 strikeouts in 34.1 innings.\nOn March 24, 2022, Russell joined TPA Baseball Texas as an instructor.\nPitching style.\nUnlike most pitchers who throw a fastball of some sort as their most common pitch, Russell's most common is a slider at 79–83 miles per hour (mph). He also features four-seam and two-seam fastballs (89–90 mph), a cutter (86–88 mph), a curveball (72–75 mph), and a changeup (80–83 mph). Left-handers see almost all four-seamers and sliders (and no change-ups), while right-handers see a larger variety of pitches.\nPersonal.\nHe is the son of former MLB pitcher Jeff Russell and attended Colleyville Heritage High School in Texas."

Sixteen other players have won the award twice, most recently done by Isaiah Miller of UNC Greensboro (2020, 2021).\nDavidson and Furman have the most all-time winners with 13, but Davidson left the SoCon after the 2013–14 season to join the Atlantic 10 Conference. There have also been nine ties in the award's history, but only one (1970–71 season) which occurred prior to the 1989–90 season. That season was the first for two separate player of the year awards—one by the Southern Conference men's basketball coaches, and the other by conference media members. When both the coaches and media select the same player, he is the consensus conference player of the year.\nThe only current members that have never had a winner are Samford and Mercer.

        "text": "Limerick Cricket Club is a cricket team based in Limerick, Ireland. The club is a member of the Munster Cricket Union and plays in competitions organised by the Union.\nHistory.\nLimerick Cricket Club was founded in 1968 through the consolidation of the then existing Catholic Institute Cricket Team and that of the Limerick Protestant Young Men's Association (LPYMA).\nThe 1980s was a successful decade for the club. For the first time in 1982, the club won the Munster Senior Cup. The club won the trophy two further times in 1986 and 1988, and were beaten finalists in 1980 and 1984. The club also won the league in 1984, 1985 and 1988.\nDuring the early 1990s the club won the Munster Junior Cup twice and a memorable Munster Minor Cup and League double in 1992. During the mid-to-late 1990s, the club won two Munster Senior Shields and the Munster Senior Cup in 1994.\nIn the early years of the millennium the club won the Munster Minor Cup in 2001 and Munster Senior Shields in 2003 and 2005 and Munster Senior League titles in 2004 and 2005. The club also won the Junior League in 2004 and the Junior Cup.\nIn 2011 the club's Minor Team had a remarkable season, ending with a Munster Minor Cup and League double.\nIn 2018 the club progressed through all rounds of the Cricket Ireland National Cup, narrowly losing out in the final to Rush CC. In 2019 the club were successful in winning the Munster Minor T20 Cup.\nGrounds.\nSince its inception, Limerick Cricket Club could well be described as nomadic. Initially the club's home ground was at the LPYMA ground until the early 1970s. The ground suffered from vandalism so a move was made to the Catholic Institute ground in Rosbrien, which was used for a couple of seasons; however, the wicket was difficult to maintain.\nThe Club then moved to the DeBeers (now Element Six) ground in Shannon, County Clare.\nBecause of the distance involved and drop in numbers from the Shannon contingent, it was decided to move back to Limerick to the Catholic Institute, and the name reverted to Limerick Cricket Club. After a couple of seasons at the Catholic Institute, the Club was on the move again. The nomadic nature of the club led to stints at Crescent College, the County Club on the Meelick road, Lord Harrington's Estate in Patrickswell, Old Crescent, and at the University of Limerick, which the club moved to in 1990.\nIn 2011 Limerick Cricket Club moved to its new grounds in Adare thereby ending the nomadic existence of the club. James Spencer has been head groundsman since the 2013 season.\nCommittee.\nThe Club's committee for the 2021 season is comprised as follows:\nTreasurer: John Daly\nSponsorship Officer: Aftab Ahmed\nHonours.\nNational Cup - Finalists 2018"

        "text": "It's Not Cricket is a 1949 British comedy film directed by Alfred Roome and starring Basil Radford, Naunton Wayne, Susan Shaw and Maurice Denham. It is the second (after 1941's \"Crook's Tour\") of two starring films for Radford and Wayne who appeared as supporting players in ten other films. It was also one of the final films made by Gainsborough Pictures before the studio was merged into the Rank Organisation.\nPlot.\nMajor Bright and Captain Early are intelligence officers in the British army of occupation in post-World War 2 Germany. They are sent home on leave, but fail to notice that their new batman is actually wanted war criminal Otto Fisch. He vanishes on arrival in England and the two officers are punished by early demobilisation. Uncertain what to do in civvy street, they decide to use the \"skills\" they learned in the army and set up a private detective agency, \"Bright and Early\". They engage a secretary, Primrose Brown, but she's not very busy as they have as yet no clients.\nPrimrose's boyfriend/fiancee invites them all to a weekend country house party for a cricket match, but what they don't know is that the cricket ball they buy in London actually contains a valuable diamond that Fisch has stolen. It has been hidden in the hollow ball by his friend and protector Mr Felix, who runs a sporting goods shop.\nAs the match gets under way Fisch and Felix watch from the cover of the trees, then infiltrate the game and steal the ball. A free-for-all chase ensues, and Bright and Early manage to recover the ball and the diamond. They have now become celebrities and don't lack for eager clients. Fisch is still working for them, as they remain unaware of his identity.\nProduction.\nAlfred Roome directed the film with Roy Rich, with Rich focusing on dealing with the actors. Roome called the movie \"a slapstick action thing, really, almost a children’s picture. What I’d do now is cut out all the terrible, boring romance stuff with Susan Shaw; there was a lot of other chat that should have gone too, but other than that, it’s not too bad... We managed to doll the sets and clothes up quite nicely, so that it looked quite expensive.\"\nCritical reception.\nIt was one of 15 films selected by Steve Chibnall and Brian McFarlane in \"The British 'B' Film\", their survey of British B films, as among the most meritorious of the B films made in Britain between World War II and 1970. They said it contained \"some of the most humorous moments in a British film of the period\", and praised the performances, Maurice Denham's in particular."

        "text": "Thomas H. Cahill (October 1868 – December 25, 1894) was an American professional baseball player who played from 1888 to 1894. He played one season in Major League Baseball and had a career batting average of .253 with 109 hits, 17 doubles, 7 triples, 3 home runs, 44 RBIs, and 38 stolen bases. He was of Irish descent.\nEarly life.\nCahill was born in Fall River, Massachusetts, in October, 1868. His father, also named Thomas Cahill, was born in Ireland and worked as a laborer. Cahill's mother was also born in Ireland. Cahill attended both the College of the Holy Cross, and the University of Pennsylvania. At the University of Pennsylvania, Cahill studied medicine while playing professional baseball. He left the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in 1891 to play professional baseball full-time, but planned on returning to his studies and eventually becoming a doctor.\nProfessional career.\nEarly career.\nIn 1888, Cahill began his professional career at the age of 19 with the Worcester Grays of the New England League. The next season, Cahill played with the New Haven, Connecticut, baseball club of the Atlantic Association. Cahill was described by the \"Meriden Daily Republican\" as \"a popular catcher,\" and the New Haven club resigned Cahill for the 1890 season.\nLouisville Colonels.\nCahill began to play with the Major League Baseball franchise Louisville Colonels of the American Association in 1891, a year after they won the American Association pennant. On the season, Cahill played multiple positions including catcher (55 games), shortstop (49 games), outfield (12 games), second base (6 games), and third base (2 games). In total, Cahill committed 69 errors in 342 total chances, giving him a fielding percentage of .930. On the offensive side, Cahill batted .253 with 68 runs, 17 doubles, 7 triples, 3 home runs, 44 RBIs, 38 stolen bases, and 41 bases on balls. Among teammates, Cahill lead the Colonels in stolen bases, and stolen bases; was second in doubles; and was fourth in hits, bases on balls, and triples (tied with Ollie Beard). Cahill was first in the majors in stolen bases amongst fellow rookies (tied with Tommy Dowd), and was second in the league (first in the American Association) in doubles. On April 21, 1892, Cahill was released by the Colonels.\nLater career.\nAfter his major league career, Cahill played for the Troy Trojans of the Eastern League for two seasons (1892–1893). His final season was 1894, before his death. Cahill played with the Troy Washerwomen, which later moved to Scranton, Pennsylvania, and became the Scranton Indians. He was the manager of the Scranton baseball club.\nDeath.\nCahill died on December 25, 1894, in Scranton, Pennsylvania. He died from complications after an injury. Cahill was buried in St. John Cemetery in Fall River, Massachusetts."

        "text": "U2360° at the Rose Bowl is a 2010 concert film by Irish rock band U2. It was shot on 25 October 2009 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, during the band's U2 360° Tour. The Rose Bowl concert featured a sold-out crowd of 97,014 people, breaking the US record for single concert attendance for one headline act. It was live streamed over the Internet via YouTube, and was later released on DVD and Blu-ray on 3 June 2010 in the United States, 7 June in the United Kingdom, and 8 June in Canada. It received generally positive reviews from critics.\nBackground.\nThe U2 360° Tour was a worldwide concert tour by the Irish rock band U2, launched in support of the group's 2009 album \"No Line on the Horizon\". The tour was designed by Willie Williams, who has worked on every U2 tour since 1982. Mark Fisher was the architect. The tour featured a 360-degree configuration, with the stage being placed closer to the center of the stadium's field than usual. Williams had been toying with ideas for 360-degree stadium staging for U2 for a number of years, and presented sketches of a four-legged design to the group near the end of their Vertigo Tour in 2006. The inspiration for the \"spaceship-on-four-legs\" design, nicknamed \"the Claw\", came from the landmark Theme Building at Los Angeles International Airport.\nThe initial tour dates were formally announced in March 2009. U2 played 44 shows in 2009, with an additional 38 concerts scheduled for 2010. The performance in Pasadena was the group's penultimate concert of 2009.\nFilming.\nThe 25 October 2009 concert in Pasadena, California was streamed live on U2's YouTube channel, the first time a concert was streamed live on YouTube. The feed was initially set to be restricted to 16 countries but was later made available worldwide. Over 10 million viewers streamed the concert, making it the largest streaming event in the website's history.\nThe shoot was directed by Tom Krueger, who had previously worked with the band on the film \"U2 3D\". Following the success of \"U2 3D\", show director Willie Williams asked Krueger to design the photography and video coverage for the U2 360° Tour. Originally 13 cameras were used for filming close-ups during the tour; however, Kruger added additional cameras for the Rose Bowl concert, resulting in a total of 27 cameras for the shoot. The additional cameras were used for crane shots and capturing footage of the audience. The show's attendance reached 97,014 people, breaking the US record for single concert attendance for one headline act, a mark U2 previously held.\nRelease.\n\"U2360° at the Rose Bowl\" was released on 3 June 2010 in the United States and 7 June in the United Kingdom. Four different formats were available, including standard DVD, deluxe DVD, a super deluxe box-set, and Blu-ray Disc. It is the first U2 concert available on Blu-ray. The DVD release was available in one- and two-disc formats, the latter which featured bonus features. Both releases featured the concert with a PCM stereo soundtrack, as well as DTS and Dolby Digital surround sound.

The Blu-ray release contains bonus live features; footage from the forthcoming 2010 North American and European legs of the tour will be available to download to the Blu-ray player through an exclusive live feature on the disc.\nReception.\n\"U2360° at the Rose Bowl\" was well received by critics. \"The Irish Times\" gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, mainly praising the staging in the film and how it \"houses everything required to make a good band seem great\". Scotland's \"Daily Record\" said that the release was not U2's best \"but still pretty damn good\". Inthenews.co.uk compared the release to U2's performances of the 1980s and the more powerful vocals of the time, but said that the band \"make up for it with a revolutionary stage, top-rate musical ability and plethora of instantly recognisable tracks\". Andrew Mueller of \"Uncut\" felt that the concert was well-translated onto a home video release, and praised the political aspects of the film, but called the final song of the film—\"Moment of Surrender\"—an \"[i]ll-chosen closer\" and \"overlong and under-realised\". \"Entertainment Weekly\" called the concert set \"groundbreaking\", and ranked \"U2360° at the Rose Bowl\" at number one on \"The Must List\" for the week prior to its release. Raoul Hernandez of \"The Austin Chronicle\" said the band \"redeems its stillborn \"No Line on the Horizon\" with this two-saucer \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\"\", adding, \"As disembodied as the two-hour Universal Studios ride becomes, U2 fires on all boosters\".\nThe Associated Press felt the video release of the concert was much better than its original live stream on YouTube, and stated that the concert showed the band \"well-rehearsed and in good form\", although criticized how Bono's voice was \"audibly hoarse\" in several songs. \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" said that the concert's songs from \"No Line on the Horizon\" \"stand out for freshness\" and referred to the performances of \"MLK\" and \"One\" as a \"lovely interlude\". Cameron Adams of various News Limited-published papers cited \"The Unforgettable Fire\" and \"Moment of Surrender\" as highlights of the concert, and said of the concert as a whole, \"In a word: Enormous.\" \"Q\" gave the film a maximum score of four stars, saying the video proves that \"The Claw is indeed breathtaking\", and that \"U2 are far too experienced to let themselves be overshadowed by the world's most expensive \"Doctor Who\" prop. It's the songs rather than the spectacle that drives the show.\"\nTrack listing.\nThe show is preceded by an introduction montage, showing the \"babyface\" (from the cover of \"Zooropa\"), complete with a helmet, staring at a screen of U2 photographs inside a space ship.\nActual set list.\nThe following is the set list for the Rose Bowl concert, featuring songs not included in the concert film:"

He scored centuries (100 or more runs in an innings) in Test matches and One Day International (ODI) matches on 25 and 10 occasions respectively during his international career. Inzamam played 120 Test matches for Pakistan and scored 8,820 runs. He is the third-highest run scorer for Pakistan in Test cricket, after Younis Khan and Javed Miandad. He was described by the BBC as \"one of the most recognisable figures in cricket\" and \"one of the finest batsmen around\", while former Pakistan captain Imran Khan said that he was \"as talented as Brian Lara and Sachin Tendulkar\".\nInzamam made his Test debut against England at Edgbaston, Birmingham, in June 1992. His first Test century came a year later against the West Indies at Antigua Recreation Ground, St John's, Antigua. His score of 329, against New Zealand at the Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore, in May 2002, is the second-highest total by a Pakistan batsman in Test cricket and the fifteenth-highest overall. He also scored a century in his 100th Test match, becoming only the fifth player to do so. Inzamam made a century in each innings of the second Test match of England's tour of Pakistan in 2005–06, to become Pakistan's leading century-maker with 24 centuries, breaking Miandad's record. His 119 against India during the second Test of the home series in January 2006 made him the tenth player to score 25 or more centuries in Test cricket. Inzamam scored Test centuries at 18 cricket grounds, including 13 at venues outside Pakistan. , he is joint twentieth (with Virat Kohli) among players with most hundreds in Test cricket.\nHaving made his ODI debut in November 1991 against the West Indies at the Gaddafi Stadium, Inzamam achieved his first ODI century a year later against Sri Lanka at the Multan Cricket Stadium. In ODI matches, Inzamam is fifth in the all-time list of highest-run scorers, with 11,739 runs from 378 matches, though he has the fewest centuries of the top ten players on that list. His highest ODI score of 137 not out came against New Zealand at the Sharjah Cricket Association Stadium, in 1994. Inzamam played his only Twenty 20 International match against England at the County Cricket Ground, Bristol, during the 2006 series between the two teams. He never scored a century in the format. , he ranks joint twenty-fifth among players with most hundreds in international cricket."

She resided after that in St. Louis, Missouri, where she became an active participant in public school sports for the rest of her life. On November 5, 1988, she was honored with the rest of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League during the opening of a permanent display at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York.
