        "text": "Emerald Valley Golf Club is a public golf course located in Creswell, Oregon, in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. The Emerald Valley course was the first regulation-length public golf course in the Eugene metropolitan area. The course runs along the west bank of the Coast Fork of the Willamette River.\nHistory.\nThe Emerald Valley Golf Club was begun in 1966 by Eugene Russell, James Russell, and Marv Ruby. It was built on the site of a dairy farm northeast of Creswell. Before the course opened, Ruby purchased the Orenco Woods Golf Course in Hillsboro, Oregon, from the Russell brothers and left the partnership. The first nine holes were opened in 1967. The site’s original dairy barn was remodeled and converted into a clubhouse and was opened along with the first nine holes. The second nine holes were opened in 1968, making Emerald Valley the first regulation-length public golf course in the Eugene–Springfield metropolitan area.\nIn 1974, the Russell brothers sold the golf course to Peter Murphy, owner of the Murphy logging company. Over the next four years, Murphy installed a new drainage system and made other improvements. In 1978, Murphy sold the golf course to the Mazama Timber Products Company, which was owned by the Forrest Solomon family. Mazama planned to build a modern clubhouse and health spa as well as homes and condominiums adjacent to the golf course.\nMazama began construction of a clubhouse, restaurant, and health spa complex in 1979. The facility was finished a year later at a cost of $4.5 million. In addition, Mazama invested over $200,000 in course improvements. The company also applied for zoning changes to allow residential development on the property around the golf course. The city of Creswell approved building permits for 54 homes and a 250 unit motel on the Emerald Valley property, but financial problem delayed construction.\nThe Oregon Bank took over the golf course in 1984 after Mazama went bankrupt. In 1987, the bank offer to sell the Emerald Valley golf course and sports complex to Lane County, but the county decided not to purchase the property. A year later, the bank sold the golf course to a group of investor headed by Chicago businessman Steven Klemen. The Klemen group bought adjacent to the golf course where they planned to develop 360 homes; however, they built less than a dozen.\nIn 1993, the golf course was sold separately from the rest of the property to the Paloma Golf Group. This formally separated the golf course from the troubled resort and housing developments. Paloma invested in some course upgrade that improved the general aesthetics of the course and increased the operation’s revenue. Paloma sold the golf course to Arnold Palmer Golf Management Company in 1997.\nIn 2002, the Palmer group sold the Emerald Valley golf course to Jim Pliska, a Portland area businessman and former member of the University of Oregon golf team. Pliska restored the course and added a new driving range and practice facility on of undeveloped land at the northeast corner of the property. A new irrigation system was installed in 2005. Today, Emerald Valley is one of the best golf courses in the state and is the home of the University of Oregon golf team.\nCourse.\n Emerald Valley Golf Club is one of Oregon’s premier public golf courses. It is located is on along the west bank of the Willamette River's Coast Fork northeast of Creswell. It is known for its tree-lined fairways, well groomed greens, and excellent course conditions. Emerald Valley was built on a flat tract of land along the river so the course gets its character from meandering doglegs and the tree-lines fairways. Well placed sand traps help narrow the approaches to greens. The greens are nicely contoured with some tricky slopes.\nThe original course was laid out in 1966 by Bob E. Baldock. In 2002, parts of the course were redesigned by Dan Hixon, a Portland golf course designer who had player at Emerald Valley when he was at college. The redesign added elevated tee boxes for the 2nd and 3rd holes, providing a view of the Willamette River from the 3rd tee. The redesign project also enlarged the pond in front of the 2nd green, added new bunkers near the 3rd and 8th greens, and expanded the 9th green.\nThe course challenges golfers of all abilities. There are four tees settings, Gold being the longest. The first nine holes are a par 36, measuring from the Gold tees. The second nine holes are also a par 36 and measure from the Gold tees. The total length of the par 72 championship course is . The shortest course is .\nMembership.\nThe Emerald Valley Golf Club offers a variety of membership option. There are seven day and week day memberships for both individuals and families. There is also a special membership rate for golfers under 17 years old. Daily rates for 18 holes of play range from $40 to $50. The fee for a 9-hole round is between $24 and $30. The course offers discount for students, seniors, and players under 17.\nOver 200 golfers, play in the \"Emerald Valley Men's Club\" program. Club competitions are held on Saturday and Sunday from March to October, except for weekends when the golf course is hosting a special event. The club hosts the \"Emerald Valley Amateur\" in June, the \"Firecracker Open\" on the 4th of July, the \"Club Championship\" in August, and the \"Ray Davis Memorial\" tournament in September. The club also sends a team to the Oregon Golf Association team championships as well as individual players to the association’s Net Championship.\nThe \"Emerald Valley Women's Club\" is open to golfers of all abilities regardless of handicap. The women’s club hosts weekly competition and an annual club championship. During the summer months, there is a junior golf program as well. The junior program includes instruction from Emerald Valley’s professional teaching staff every Thursday from July though August. There is also a junior club championship tournament and a parent/youth ice cream social tournament at the end of August.\nLocation.\nThe Emerald Valley golf course is located in Creswell, Oregon at the southern end of the Willamette Valley. To get to the Emerald Valley Golf Club from Interstate 5, take exit 182. Turn onto the Emerald Parkway heading east and go about one quarter of a mile; make a left turn onto Dale Kuni Road. The Emerald Valley Golf Club parking lot is on the right side of the road about one hundred yards from the junction."

        "text": "The men's épée was one of seven fencing events on the fencing at the 1948 Summer Olympics programme. It was the tenth appearance of the event. The competition was held from 7 August 1948 to 9 August 1948. 66 fencers from 25 nations competed. The event was won by Luigi Cantone of Italy, the nation's third consecutive victory in the men's épée (matching France for most all-time). Italy also earned its third consecutive \"bronze\" medal in the event, with Edoardo Mangiarotti's third-place finish. Between the two Italians was Oswald Zappelli of Switzerland, taking the silver medal.\nBackground.\nThis was the 10th appearance of the event, which was not held at the first Games in 1896 (with only foil and sabre events held) but has been held at every Summer Olympics since 1900.\nOne of the 10 finalists from the pre-war 1936 Games returned: fifth-place finisher Charles Debeur of Belgium. The reigning (1947) World Champion, Édouard Artigas of France, competed in the team event but not the individual event.\nColombia and Luxembourg each made their debut in the event. Belgium and the United States each appeared for the ninth time, tied for most among nations.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition format was pool play round-robin, with bouts to three touches. Not all bouts were played in some pools if not necessary to determine advancement. Ties were broken through fence-off bouts (\"barrages\") in early rounds if necessary for determining advancement, but by touches received in final rounds (and for non-advancement-necessary placing in earlier rounds). A barrage was held for the silver and bronze medals when the two fencers finished event on record, touches received, and touches scored.\nThe 1948 competition introduced byes for team event finalists.\nResults.\nRound 1.\nThe top 4 finishers in each pool advanced to round 2. Fencers from the four teams that advanced to the final of the men's team épée event received byes through round 1:\nPool 2.\nBiancalana defeated Mørch and Wolff in a three-way barrage for fourth place.\nPool 3.\nSimonetti defeated Meraz and Pouliot in a three-way barrage for fourth place.\nPool 4.\nRadoux defeated de Barros and Nawrocki in a three-way barrage for fourth place.\nPool 7.\nYounes defeated Iturri in a barrage for fourth place.\nPool 8.\nYounes defeated Iturri in a barrage for fourth place.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe top 3 finishers in each pool advanced to the semifinals.\nQuarterfinal 1.\nCamargo defeated de Capriles and Horn in a three-way barrage for third place.\nQuarterfinal 2.\nBiancalana and Saucedo defeated de Beaumont in a three-way barrage for second and third place.\nQuarterfinal 5.\nLepage defeated Anen and Nielsen in a three-way barrage for third place.\nSemifinals.\nThe top 5 finishers in each pool advanced to the final.\nSemifinal 1.\nAgostoni defeated Ljungquist in a barrage for fifth place.\nFinal.\nZappelli and Mangiarotti finished tied on win–loss record, touches received, and touches scored. Rather than use the head-to-head results from the round-robin (Zappelli had defeated Mangiarotti 3–0 in their bout), they faced each other in a barrage for silver and bronze medals. Zappelli won, 3–0 again."

The second pairings saw the favorites again win, with France 9–1 over Denmark and Italy 8–6 over Sweden. The Sweden-Denmark match was thus a \"de facto\" bronze medal match, with Sweden winning 8–7.

None of the pre-World War II 1936 finalists returned. The favorite was young Christian d'Oriola, the 1947 world champion. Joining him on the French team was 1947 épée world champion Jehan Buhan, who would have been favored in 1940 were it not for the war.\nColombia, Ireland, Luxembourg, and Turkey each made their debut in the men's foil. The United States made its ninth appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the inaugural 1896 competition.\nCompetition format.\nThe event used a four-round format. In each round, the fencers were divided into pools to play a round-robin within the pool. Bouts were to five touches. Not all bouts were played in some pools if not necessary to determine advancement. Ties were broken through fence-off bouts (\"barrages\") in early rounds if necessary for determining advancement, but by touches received in final rounds (and for non-advancement-necessary placing in earlier rounds). Standard foil rules were used, including that touches had to be made with the tip of the foil, the target area was limited to the torso, and priority determined the winner of double touches.\nResults.\nRound 1.\nThe top 4 finishers in each pool advanced to round 2.\nPool 1.\nHörning defeated Gretsch in a barrage for fourth place.\nPool 2.\nYounes and Rydström defeated Barrientos in a three-way barrage for third and fourth place.\nPool 3.\nPalócz defeated Albrechtsen in a barrage for fourth place.\nPool 7.\nAbdel Hafeez defeated Lamesch in a barrage for fourth place.\nPool 8.\nSchlaepfer defeated Hátszeghy in a barrage for fourth place.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe top 4 finishers in each pool advanced to the semifinals.\nSemifinals.\nThe top 4 finishers in each pool advanced to the final.\nSemifinal 2.\nDi Rosa defeated Cetrulo in a barrage for fourth place."

The competition was held from 12 August 1948 to 13 August 1948. 60 fencers from 24 nations competed. Nations were limited to three fencers each. The event was won by Aladár Gerevich, the fifth of nine straight Games in which a Hungarian would win the event. Gerevich became the third man to win multiple medals in the individual sabre, adding to his 1936 bronze. Vincenzo Pinton of Italy took silver and Pál Kovács of Hungary took bronze; it was the third straight Games where the sabre podium was Hungary-Italy-Hungary.\nBackground.\nThis was the 11th appearance of the event, which is the only fencing event to have been held at every Summer Olympics. Three of the nine finalists from 1936 returned after the 12-year break: bronze medalist Aladár Gerevich of Hungary, fifth-place finisher Vincenzo Pinton of Italy, and seventh-place finisher Antoni Sobik of Poland. Hungary, dominant in the event since the 1908 Games, was expected to perform well again, led by Gerevich and 1937 world champion Pál Kovács. Aldo Montano of Italy had won the 1938 and 1947 world championships (1939 through 1946 had been cancelled due to World War II) and would have been a favorite, but he did not compete in the individual event, leaving Pinton as the greatest challenger to the Hungarians.\nFinland and Peru each made their debut in the men's sabre. Italy and Denmark each made their ninth appearance in the event, tied for most of any nation, each having missed two of the first three events but having appeared every Games since 1908.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition format was pool play round-robin, with bouts to five touches.

Ties were broken through fence-off bouts (\"barrages\") in early rounds if necessary for determining advancement, but by touches received in final rounds (and for non-advancement-necessary placing in earlier rounds).

        "text": "DR Congo national football team (formerly the Zaire national football team) have appeared in the finals of the FIFA World Cup on one occasion in 1974 when they were known as Zaire. They were the first Sub-Saharan African team to participate in a World Cup Finals. Despite respectable performances against Scotland and Brazil they were defeated in all three matches with a total goal difference of 0–14.\nContext.\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko invested heavily in the national football team. It led to continental success, with Zaire winning the African Cup of Nations in 1968 and in March 1974, just three months before their World Cup appearance. After qualifying for the 1974 FIFA World Cup in December 1973, the players were each given a car and a house by Mobutu.\nThe disastrous displays of the Zaire national team were put into a new light in a notable 2002 interview with defender Mwepu Ilunga. According to him, they were informed they would not be paid after their initial 0-2 defeat against Scotland. This led to the Zairian players refusing to play. Even though they were persuaded to show up against Yugoslavia, they were unmotivated and lost 0-9, one of the highest defeats in FIFA World Cup history.\n\"After the match, he (Mobutu) sent his presidential guards to threaten us. They closed the hotel to all journalists and said that if we lost 0-4 to Brazil, none of us would be able to return home\", Ilunga is quoted.\nThey lost their final match 0–3.\nIn an interview in 2018, the captain Raoul Kidumu affirmed the reason for the defeat against Yugoslavia.\n\"We were aware that every team received a big qualification bonus [From FIFA, and partially passed on to the players] of half a million dollars. That was our money. We'd been asking for days. We shared the same hotel with the players of Haiti and every day we saw them arrive back with bags full of presents: jewellery, radios, clothes. Bought with their bonus. Meanwhile our Minister of Sport was running around with his bum bag. He was arranging the financial matters with FIFA. On the eve of the game with Yugoslavia he called us together for a meeting. We thought: \"Finally!\" Until he said he had to share something with us. \"Regarding the money, it'll be sent straight to Zaire.\" That's when we knew we wouldn't see a penny of it. All the players were angry, including myself. We wouldn't play against Yugoslavia. A team at the world championships had never forfeited before. We were determined to be the first.\"\nOf course this angered the dictator Mobutu and half an hour later a further team meeting was called. The president was on the line and Kidumu as the team captain had to pick up the phone. \"The president was angry. A strike? He said he would be watching the match the next day on TV. He told me he would be watching whether or not we entered the pitch. It sounded like a threat so we gave in. We were afraid of the consequences. Not even for ourselves, but our families back in Zaire. So we showed up for the match. But you have to understand that our morale was gone.\"\nThe captain also affirmed the threats made by the president about losing the next match against Brazil by more than 3 goals. “We started the match with the intention to show the world we could play football. At half time it was only 1–0. But the coach deceived everyone. Together with the goal keeper he falsified the game. Kazadi, our goalkeeper, later confessed it. Brazil had to win by at least three goals to qualify and they arranged it. You should rewatch those last two goals. A blind wench could have stopped those balls.\"\nThe Free Kick Incident.\nLate in their third match, a free kick was given to Zairian opponents Brazil at a central position just outside the penalty box. Before Brazil's free kick specialist Rivellino could take it, however, Zaire defender Mwepu Ilunga darted out of the defending wall and kicked the ball away as hard as he could. At the time, some thought of it as \"a bizarre moment of African innocence\" as quoted by BBC reporter John Motson. Ever since, it is regularly listed among the most hilarious and memorable moments of World Cup history.\nOnly decades later did Ilunga explain that he was fully aware of the rules and had hoped to be sent off in an act of protest, but referee Nicolae Rainea only showed him a yellow card.\nAftermath.\nThe Yugoslav coach Vidinić did not return to Zaire after the championships but went straight back to his home country.\nThe players, rather than being received by luxurious coach as had been the case after their Africa Cup triumph, had an empty army truck waiting for them. They were driven straight to the presidential palace, where Mobutu was waiting for them.\nThe captain said \"There he gave us an ear full. He looked at us over the rim of his glasses, like an angry dad to his children: \"So you thought you would rebel? I gave you all a house and a car!\". He was furious. Not one player dared to speak. It was deathly quiet. In the end I softly asked to have the word and I apologised for what happened. It's the only thing I could have done. He finished with \"Next time I'll throw you all in jail.\"\"\nAs punishment none of the players could leave the country. A list in the port and the airport of their names was displayed with \"Forbidden to leave the country\". This scuppered the players prospects of moves to European clubs with the offers that came in after the World cup.\nAfter the World cup Mobutu lost interest in football and stopped actively using the national team as a political tool for promoting his regime. One of the players ended up being homeless. In 2012 a charity raised money for the surviving players to receive a small pension every month of a couple of hundred dollars.\nZaire at West Germany 1974.\nSquad.\nHead coach: Blagoje Vidinić\nRecord players.\nTen players were fielded by head coach Vidinić on all three occasions, making them record players for the DR Congo to this day."

        "title": "List of NCAA Division I men's basketball season rebounding leaders",
        "text": "In basketball, a rebound is the act of gaining possession of the ball after a missed field goal or free throw. The National Collegiate Athletic Association's (NCAA) Division I rebounding title is awarded to the player with the highest rebounds per game (rpg) average in a given season. However, from 1956 through 1962, the rebounding leader was determined by the highest individual recoveries out of the total by both teams in all games (meaning the highest \"percentage\" of the total possible rebounds determined the winner, not the \"per game\" average). The NCAA did not split into its current divisions format until August 1973. From 1906 to 1955, there were no classifications to the NCAA nor its predecessor, the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States (IAAUS). Then, from 1956 to 1973, colleges were classified as either \"NCAA University Division (Major College)\" or \"NCAA College Division (Small College)\". The NCAA's official men's basketball media guide recognizes rebounding champions beginning with the 1950–51 season.\nCharlie Slack of Marshall owns the Division I record for a single-season rebounding average (25.6), which he accomplished in 1954–55. The all-time career rebounds record holder—Tom Gola of La Salle—never won an NCAA Division I rebounding title despite grabbing 2,201 rebounds. In the official NCAA men's basketball record books, a distinction is drawn between the pre-1973 era and the post-1973 era. One reason is that because of the split into the three Divisions in use today (Divisions I, II and III), many of the rebounds accumulated in the pre-1973 era were against less–talented opponents that would be considered Division II, III or even NAIA in today's hierarchy. Although the 1972–73 season was before the divisional split, the NCAA officially considers that season to be \"post-1973\" because of the adoption of freshman eligibility for varsity play in all NCAA sports effective in August 1972. Therefore, Kermit Washington of American is the post-1973 Division I single-season rpg record holder. He averaged 20.4 rebounds in 1972–73.\nNine players have earned multiple rebounding titles: Leroy Wright, Jerry Lucas, Artis Gilmore, Kermit Washington, Xavier McDaniel, Paul Millsap, O. D. Anosike, Alan Williams, and Oscar Tshiebwe. Of these, only Millsap earned three NCAA Division I rebounding titles, which he accomplished from 2004 to 2006. He also skipped his senior season to enter the National Basketball Association (NBA) early, so had he stayed at Louisiana Tech he may have won the rebounding title a fourth time. Eight players who won Division I rebounding titles have been enshrined into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame: Elgin Baylor, Artis Gilmore, Jerry Lucas, Hakeem Olajuwon, David Robinson, Spencer Haywood, Shaquille O'Neal, and Tim Duncan.\nThree players who have led the NCAA in rebounds also led the association in scoring as well. Xavier McDaniel was the first to accomplish the feat in the 1984–85 season. That season he averaged 27.2 points and 14.8 rebounds per game for Wichita State University. In 1988–89, Loyola Marymount's Hank Gathers lead the nation with 32.7 points and 13.7 rebounds per game. The last player to lead the country in both categories was Kurt Thomas of Texas Christian University. His 28.9 points and 14.6 rebounds per game topped the NCAA in the 1994–95 season. Gathers was a junior; the other two were seniors.\nSix players who have led the NCAA in rebounds were born outside United States territory, and a seventh was born in a United States insular area. Hakeem Olajuwon, the leader in 1983–84, was born in Nigeria; 2009–10 leader Artsiom Parakhouski was born in the Byelorussian SSR of the Soviet Union, which would become the independent country of Belarus in his childhood; 2015–16 leader Egidijus Mockevičius was born in Lithuania; 2016–17 leader Angel Delgado was born in the Dominican Republic; 2020–21 leader Fardaws Aimaq was born in Canada; and the two-time leader Oscar Tshiebwe (2021–22 and 2022–23) was born in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Duncan, the 1996–97 leader, was born in the United States Virgin Islands and is a U.S. citizen by birth.\nRebounding leaders.\nAll schools are listed under their current athletic brand names, which do not always match those used by a program in a given season."

Saudi Arabia is not a member of the IIHF and therefore not eligible to enter any IIHF World Championship events.\nHistory.\nThe Saudi Arabian Nationals first played ice hockey in the early 1990s. Ice hockey was played in Riyadh at the Fal Shopping Centre Ice Rink, a rink 1/3 the size of a standard North American-sized ice rink. In 1994, five Saudis were part of a team consisting of mostly ex-pats from Canada and Finland. This particular team was the winner of the Canuck Cup held in Dubai. A member of the team was Prince Ahmed Al-Saud, a fan of hockey after watching it played in New York. Saudi Arabia played its first game in 2010 during the Gulf Ice Hockey Championship which was held in Kuwait City, Kuwait. Saudi Arabia played three games losing its opener against Kuwait 10–3. In their second game in the tournament, Saudi Arabia was beaten by a larger margin then the first, losing to the United Arab Emirates 14–1. In their final game of the tournament, they won their first ever international game after they defeated Oman 3–1. Saudi Arabia finished third in the four team tournament with the UAE winning gold. Saudi Arabia has not been active until the 2022 GCC Games, but at the 2023 Arab Cup, Saudi Arabia was unofficially represented at the tournament by the Jeddah Eagles club team."

        "title": "Baseball (Intellivision video game)",
        "text": "Baseball (released as Major League Baseball, Super Challenge Baseball, and World Championship Baseball) is a sport video game produced by Mattel and released for the Intellivision home video game console in 1980. As the best-selling game in the console's history, with more than 1 million copies sold, \"Baseball\" put players in control of a nine-man baseball team competing in a standard nine-inning game. When first released, Mattel obtained a license from Major League Baseball, although the only trademarked item used is the MLB logo on the box art. No official team names or player names are in the game.\nGameplay.\nThe game consists of nine innings on a simplified baseball diamond. The team having scored the most runs wins.\nPlayer 1 is always the visiting team and bats at the top of the innings, with Player 2 as the home team and batting at the bottom of the innings. The pitching player selects a pitch by pushing the controller in one of eight cardinal directions, each representing a different speed and direction. The batting player then attempts to hit the ball into play and reach base safely, so that subsequent batters can move to home plate and thus score a run. If the ball is hit into play, the pitching player uses the keypad to select the fielder catch the ball, then selects the player to receive the throw, to put the runner \"out\".\nThe batting player is able to advance the base-runners off base in an attempt to steal a base, but the pitching player can counter that with an attempt to pickoff the runners before the pitch is thrown.\nIf the score is tied at the end of the 9th inning, extra innings are played as necessary until a winner is determined.\nVariations from standard baseball.\nEven though the two teams represented in \"Baseball\" are basically the same, the level of simulation is remarkable for its time. A wide array of baseball strategy includes Double plays, triple plays, rundowns, and intentional walks are all possible. Changes include all hits being automatically grounders, with no provisions for flyballs. Home runs depend on how and where the ball is hit.\nAnother major change allows the batting player to score a run on a third out, if the base-runner reaches home plate before the third out takes place. For example, if the bases were loaded with two outs as the batter hits the ball into play, the runner on third base could score if a throw to third base forcing out the runner from second base (thus, the third out) arrived after the runner on third crossed home plate but before the runner from second base reached third base.\nPorts.\nAn updated version titled \"World Championship Baseball\" was released in 1983. Sears sold it without the MLB license for its private-label Super Video Arcade console, and Mattel's M Network produced an Atari 2600 conversion called \"Super Challenge Baseball\".\n After Mattel Electronics ceased production of the Intellivision system and its assets were sold to INTV Corporation, \"Major League Baseball\" was re-released with the new name \"Big League Baseball\". It is in the \"Intellivision Lives!\" compilation and in Microsoft's \"Game Room\" service as \"Baseball\".\nReception.\n\"Baseball\" was reviewed by \"Video\" magazine in its \"Arcade Alley\" column where it was praised for its inclusion of moveable fielders and \"flashy\" baserunning techniques like the suicide squeeze. Criticism was given to the somewhat simplistic pitching controls, and the fact that \"all batted balls are grounders\", but overall the game was described as \"blow[ing] away\" all other contemporary baseball video games. The game is covered in \"Video\" magazine's 1982 Guide to Electronic Games where reviewers noted that the game had \"lost none of its luster\" since its release. In 1995, \"Flux\" magazine ranked the game 37th on its Top 100 Video Games. It praised the realistic graphics and the ability to control each player individually.\nIt was reviewed in \"Games\" magazine."

        "text": "In basketball, an assist is a pass to a teammate that directly leads to a score by field goal. All of the players on this list have recorded at least 20 assists in a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I game. Assists were first recognized in the 1950–51 season, but only lasted through 1951–52 before the NCAA stopped recording them until the 1983–84 season. All players on this list have accumulated at least 20 assists in a game while playing for a Division I university. Through the most recent 2019–20 season, this has occurred only 22 times.\nThe single game record is 24 assists, set by Cameron Parker of Sacred Heart on December 1, 2019. The previous record of 22 had been accomplished by four players. Four 21-assist performances have been recorded, while the 15 remaining instances have been 20 assists.\nNo school has had more than one player reach the 20-assist mark. Southern University is on this list four times via Avery Johnson's four 20-assist games during his career. Johnson, who spent his first two college seasons at New Mexico Junior College and then Cameron University, only played NCAA Division I basketball for two seasons (1987, 1988). He led Division I in assists per game both years and set the still-standing record of 13.30 assists per game in 1987–88. Cameron Parker joins him as the only two players in Division I history to reach 20 assists more than once."

        "title": "2011 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup",
        "text": "The 2011 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup was the sixth edition of the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup, governed by FIFA. Overall, this was the 16th edition of a world cup in beach soccer since the establishment of the \"Beach Soccer World Championships\" which ran from 1995–2004 but was not governed by FIFA. It took place at the Stadio del Mare (Stadium of the Sea), a temporary stadium at the Marina di Ravenna in Ravenna, Italy, the third tournament to take place outside Brazil, which started on September 1 and ended on September 11, 2011. However this was the first tournament to take place under the new two year basis; now the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup takes place once every two years. The tournament was confirmed in March 2010. \nBrazil were the defending champions, after winning their fourth FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup title in 2009. The tournament was won by Russia, winning their first title in their first final after beating Brazil.\nQualifying rounds.\nAfrican Zone.\nThe African qualifiers took place between June 15 and June 19, 2011, in Casablanca, Morocco, for the first time. The competition took place between nine teams, the same number of teams who competed in the previous championship. Not surprisingly, Senegal and Nigeria were the eventual qualifying nations, after beating Egypt and surprise semi-finalists Madagascar respectively to reach the final. Senegal were the winners of the competition, beating Nigeria 7-4 in the final.\nAsian Zone.\nThe Asian qualifiers took place in Muscat, Oman, for the first time, between February 27 and March 4, 2011. Beach Soccer Worldwide and FIFA decided on holding the tournament there, due to the success of the 2010 Asian Beach Games, also held there. A record eleven teams participated, an increase on the previous record of seven teams in 2009. Japan clinched their second successive championship title, after beating hosts Oman in the final who will play at the World Cup for the first time. Iran won the third-place play off against the United Arab Emirates to qualify for their fourth World Cup appearance, whilst the United Arab Emirates have failed to qualify to the World Cup, after hosting the competition in 2009.\nEuropean Zone.\nThe European qualifiers took place in Bibione, Italy from 11–18 July 2010, with 27 teams participating for four European berths. The surprising winners of the qualifiers, Ukraine, qualified along with runners-up Portugal, third-place Russia and fourth-place Switzerland. Only the semi-finalists qualified to the World Cup, meaning that Spain, who won the qualifiers in 2008, have failed to make the finals in Ravenna, meaning that this World Cup will be the first time Spain have not competed in twelve World Cups, since 1997. 2005 World Cup winners France have also failed to qualify, making it two World Cups in a row France have failed to qualify for.\nNorth, Central American and Caribbean Zone.\nThe CONCACAF qualifiers were played between 8 nations, an increase from last year's 6, for the first time, between 1–5 December 2010, in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, for the third year in a row, seeing Jamaica return after four years and newcomers Guatemala joining the tournament. However, inevitably, the qualifiers were fought out between the strongest four nations in CONCACAF: El Salvador, Costa Rica, Mexico and the United States, who met in the semi-finals of the tournament, clearly dominating as a 'big four' force. However, only the finalists could qualify for the World Cup, which led to two dramatic semi-final games which saw both matches go to penalty shootouts. In the end, it was El Salvador and Mexico who qualified, after tense 3-3 and 1-1 draws against Costa Rica and the United States respectively. The qualifying nations eventually went through on penalties, 2-1 and 1-0 respectively, meaning that El Salvador qualify for the World Cup consecutively after putting out Costa Rica, who qualified last year, whilst Mexico qualify after a two-year absence from the World Cup, meaning the United States have now failed to qualify since 2007. Mexico were favourites from CONCACAF in Ravenna after beating El Salvador in the final of the qualifiers. The United States finished third after beating Costa Rica in the third place play off.\nOceanian Zone.\nThe OFC qualifiers took place from 23–26 February 2011 in Papeete, Tahiti, the place where the 2013 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup will be held. This was the third time the island hosted the qualifiers following 2006 and 2009, but the first in Papeete, as it had been held in Moorea previously. Once again, Fiji, the Solomon Islands, and Tahiti competed however Vanuatu were forced to withdraw due to being stranded at their airport because of a cyclone that had passed through the area. Despite the Solomon Islands looking the dominant team, winning both their games in the group stage, they lost to hosts Tahiti in the final, meaning for the first time since the qualifiers began in 2006, the Solomon Islands will not be competing in the World Cup.\nSouth American Zone.\nThe CONMEBOL qualifiers were originally scheduled to take place from 7–14 May 2011, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. However the tournament was rescheduled and took place from 31 July to 7 August. For the fourth consecutive tournament, Brazil won the championship, after beating Argentina in the final, 6-2. Since both these nations reached the final, this also means that they both qualify for the fourth year in a row. The surprise of the tournament saw Uruguay crash out at the group stage of the tournament, meaning for the first time since the World Cup's inception in 1995, Uruguay will not be competing, leaving Brazil as the sole nation to have competed in every World Cup to date. With Uruguay's absence from the knockout stage, this allowed Venezuela to claim victory over surprise semi-finalists Colombia, to qualify for their third World Cup, after their last appearance in 2001.\nHosts.\nItaly qualified automatically as the hosts, although they still competed in the European qualifiers, being knocked out in the round of 16.\nTeams.\nThese are the teams that have qualified for the 2011 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup:\nAsian zone (AFC):\nAfrican zone (CAF):\nEuropean zone (UEFA):\nNorth, Central American and Caribbean zone (CONCACAF):\nOceanian zone (OFC):\nSouth American zone (CONMEBOL):\nVenue.\nOnly one venue was used in the city of Ravenna during the World Cup which has been called the \"Stadio del Mare\" or the \"Stadium of the Sea\", in English. The Stadium was built as a temporary structure, primarily built to host the World Cup however the stadium also hosted the third stage of the 2011 Euro Beach Soccer League, to promote beach soccer in the area before the start of the World Cup.\nReferees.\nFIFA chose 25 officials to referee the matches. From the 25 referees, at least one referee representing each confederation; four from the AFC, three from CAF, five from CONMEBOL, three from CONCACAF, one from the OFC and eight from UEFA, with all 25 officials being from different countries. The referees were revealed in August 2011.\nFinal draw.\nThe draw to divide the 16 teams in four groups of four was conducted on 5 July 2011 in Rome, Italy, which was conducted by FIFA Beach Soccer Committee members Joan Cuscó and Jaime Yarza. 1998 FIFA World Cup winner Christian Karembeu and beach soccer legend, Ramiro Figueiras Amarelle assisted the draw.\nThe sixteen teams were placed into four pots of four teams. One team from each pot was placed into each respective group A, B, C and D, with the hosts being chosen first to play in group A.\nSquads.\nAs with previous tournaments, each nations' squad consists of a total of 12 players; only these players were eligible to play in the World Cup. On 25 August 2011, the squad lists for the 16 teams were announced, consisting of a total of 192 players who will be participating in the World Cup. Brazil have the oldest squad, with an average age of 31, whilst Nigeria have the youngest squad with an average age of 22.\nGroup stage.\nThe group stage commenced on September 1 and concluded on September 6, with Argentina against Oman being the opening match of the competition.\nAll kickoff times are listed as local time in Ravenna (UTC+2).\nTop scorers.\n14 goals\n12 goals\n9 goals\n8 goals\n7 goals\n6 goals\n5 goals\n4 goals"

Daly (born August 1914, died 3 November 1994, Mount Eliza, Victoria, Australia) was an English player of rugby union football, who played internationally for both Ireland and East Africa. Along with W.B. Young of he is one of only two people to have been capped by a major rugby playing nation and by East Africa.\nPrior to World War II.\nAt his senior school, Maurice was a keen rugby player, cricketer, track athlete and Rugby fives player. After leaving school he played for Old Haberdashers RFC (1932–37) and the Harlequin F.C. (1938–39), scoring tries prolifically in both the 15-a-side and 7-a-side versions of the game. He was capped once for on 12 February 1938 playing on the right-wing against at Lansdowne Road. England led 23–0 at half-time but Ireland improved during the second half managing to score four tries (the last of which was scored by Daly), though Ireland were unable to completely overcome the opposition, eventually losing 36–14.\nDuring the war.\nHe was commissioned in the 35th (First Surrey Rifles) Anti-Aircraft Battalion, T.A. in January 1939 and was called up in September of that year. It is believed that Maurice played for Clifton RFC during the 1939–40 season; an Army posting may explain his presence in Bristol at this time. He saw action in Italy, France, Belgium and Germany. The war caused much disruption to regular rugby in the United Kingdom though he continued to play some rugby during this time, turning out for various military units and also for several invitation sides for various charitable causes.\nAfter being wounded he became Air Liaison Officer, North West Europe in December 1944 with the rank of major and was awarded the M.B.E.\nAfter the war.\nAfter the war he returned to play with Harlequins (1945–48); he captained the Harlequins VII that lost the final of the 1947–48 Middlesex 7's to Wasps 14–5. He was also selected to represent Middlesex County consistently between 1946 and 1949, captaining the side that lost the 1946/47 semi-final with Gloucestershire.\nSometime in 1949–50, he moved to Kenya where he continued to play rugby for the Ruiru R.F.C. and was awarded a cap by East Africa for a match that he played in 1951. Though the Rugby Football Union of East Africa (RFUEA) did not exist until 1953, Maurice played for Kenya Colony (the precursor of the Kenya national rugby union team) against the \"Oxford and Cambridge Universities\" touring team in September 1951 at Mitchell Park (now Jamhuri Park), Nairobi. All players on the Kenyan team in that match were awarded backdated East Africa caps after the formation of the RFUEA. Oxford and Cambridge were returning by air from a successful tour of South Africa and they stopped off to play one final match on the continent. The visitors fielded six international players (Ian J. Botting (), John V. Smith(), Laurie G. Gloag (), Lewis B. Cannell(), John MacG. Kendall-Carpenter () and George C. Rittson-Thomas ()) and three players who were to achieve international status on their return (Chris E. Winn (), Ricky M. Bartlett () and Mike Walker ()) and proved too strong for their hosts, winning 44–5.\nHe met his wife in Kenya and they were married in 1952. They left Kenya during the Mau Mau Uprising moving to Sussex, where they lived for 15 years until they finally emigrated to Australia."

        "text": "The men's team foil was one of seven fencing events on the fencing at the 1936 Summer Olympics programme. It was the sixth appearance of the event. The competition was held from 2 to 4 August 1936. 99 fencers from 17 nations competed. Each team could have a maximum of six fencers, with four participating in any given match.\nThe competition format continued the pool play round-robin from prior years. Each of the four fencers from one team would face each of the four from the other, for a total of 16 bouts per match. The team that won more bouts won the match, with competition potentially stopping when one team reached 9 points out of the possible 16 (this did not always occur and matches sometimes continued). If the bouts were 8–8, touches received was used to determine the winning team. Pool matches unnecessary to the result were not played; this rule affected all 10 of the pools in the first two rounds, which stopped after 2 of 3 possible matches when one team lost both. \nResults.\nRound 1.\nThe top two teams in each pool advanced to round 2.\nPool 1.\nSwitzerland defeated Greece on touches received (64–68) after the bouts were tied at 8 apiece. Belgium also defeated Greece. This resulted in Greece's elimination and the match between Belgium and Switzerland not being played.\nPool 2.\nFrance and Yugoslavia each defeated Brazil. This resulted in Brazil being eliminated and the match between France and Yugoslavia not being played.\nPool 3.\nArgentina and Czechoslavkia each defeated Denmark. This resulted in Denmark being eliminated and the match between Argentina and Czechoslavkia not being played.\nPool 4.\nGermany and Great Britain each defeated Canada. This resulted in Canada being eliminated and the match between Germany and Great Britain not being played.\nPool 5.\nItaly and Austria each defeated Egypt. This resulted in Egypt being eliminated and the match between Italy and Austria not being played.\nPool 6.\nThe United States and Hungary each defeated Norway. This resulted in Norway being eliminated and the match between the United States and Hungary not being played.\nRound 2.\nThe top two teams in each pool advanced to the semifinals.\nPool 1.\nGermany and Great Britain advanced from the same first-round group, but had not played each other yet. Great Britain was defeated after losing to both Argentina and Germany, who did not play each other. The match between Argentina and Great Britain was decided on touches received, 57–62, after being tied on individual bouts 8–8.\nPool 2.\nItaly and the United States each defeated Switzerland. This resulted in Switzerland being eliminated and the match between Italy and the United States not being played.\nPool 3.\nFrance and Hungary each defeated Yugoslavia. This resulted in Yugoslavia being eliminated and the match between France and Hungary not being played.\nPool 4.\nAustria and Belgium each defeated Czechoslovakia. This resulted in Czechoslovakia being eliminated and the match between Austria and Belgium not being played.\nSemifinals.\nThe top two teams in each pool advanced to the final.\nSemifinal 1.\nItaly and the United States advanced from the same second-round group, but had not played each other yet. Italy defeated each of the three other teams. Austria had a decisive 12–4 win against the United States, but fell to Hungary on touches received 53–63 after the individual bouts were 8–8. Hungary in turn lost to the United States, 9–7, creating a three-way tie for second place. Austria had lost the fewest individual bouts and advanced.\nSemifinal 2.\nGermany and Argentina advanced from the same second-round group, but had not played each other yet. France remained undefeated, beating each of the other three teams. Germany defeated Belgium and Argentina to advance as well, with Belgium finishing third in the group with a win over Argentina.\nFinal.\nIn the first pairings, Italy beat Austria while France defeated Germany. In the second, France defeated Austria while Italy beat Germany. The third and final pairings of the round-robin became effectively a gold-medal final between Italy and France (both of whom were undefeated to that point) as well as a bronze-medal match featuring Germany and Austria. Italy reached 9 wins after 13 individual bouts, securing the gold medal while France took silver. Germany accumulated 9 wins in 14 bouts, earning bronze."

        "text": "The men's sabre was one of seven fencing events on the fencing at the 1936 Summer Olympics programme. It was the tenth appearance of the event. The competition was held from 14 August 1936 to 15 August 1936. 71 fencers from 26 nations competed. Nations were limited to three fencers each. The event was won by Endre Kabos of Hungary, the fourth of nine straight Games in which a Hungarian would win the event. Kabos became the second man to win multiple medals in the individual sabre, adding to his 1932 bronze. Gustavo Marzi of Italy took silver, while Hungarian Aladár Gerevich earned bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the 10th appearance of the event, which is the only fencing event to have been held at every Summer Olympics. Four of the ten finalists from 1932 returned: silver medalist Giulio Gaudini of Italy, bronze medalist Endre Kabos of Hungary, and sixth-place finisher John Huffman and ninth-place finisher Norman Cohn-Armitage of the United States. Hungary, dominant in the event since the 1908 Games, was expected to perform well again. Kabos had won the world championships in 1933 and 1934; teammate Aladár Gerevich had won in 1935.\nBrazil and Costa Rica each made their debut in the men's sabre. Italy and Denmark each made their eighth appearance in the event, tied for most of any nation, each having missed two of the first three events but having appeared every Games since 1908.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition format was pool play round-robin, with bouts to five touches. Not all bouts were played in some pools if not necessary to determine advancement. Two points were awarded for each bout won. Ties were broken through fence-off bouts in early rounds if necessary for determining advancement, but by touches received in final rounds (and for non-advancement-necessary placement in earlier rounds).\nResults.\nRound 1.\nThe top four fencers in each pool advanced to the quarterfinals.\nPool 1.\nBrook defeated Bentancur in the play-off for fourth place and the last advancement spot.\nPool 4.\nHarry defeated Szatmary in the play-off for fourth place and the last advancement spot.\nPool 5.\nMoreno was the winner of the three-way play-off with Kirchmann and Christiansen for fourth place and the last advancement spot.\nPool 7.\nThe official report lists a three-way for second-place, but under the scoring system in use Wahl was alone due to fewest touches received.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe top three fencers in each pool advanced to the semifinals.\nQuarterfinal 4.\nVasilev won the three-way play-off against Krause and Montfoort for third place and the last advancement spot.\nSemifinals.\nThe top three fencers in each pool advanced to the final.\nFinal.\nTies in the final, including the tie for silver, were broken by touches received rather than play-off bouts. Thus, even though Gerevich had defeated Marzi in their bout during the pool play, Marzi took the silver and Gerevich bronze without any rematch due to the 22–26 advantage Marzi had in touches received. Kabos's loss to Marzi was his only loss in the entire tournament, as he finished 24–1 overall."

Belgium then defeated Denmark, with the match stopped at 9–1 when Denmark's loss (and elimination) was assured.\nPool 4.\nCzechoslovakia defeated Greece 11–5.

The second pair of matches saw the United States win again, this time over Turkey, while Switzerland defeated Yugoslavia. This resulted in the United States being guaranteed advancement while Yugoslavia was eliminated (and thus the two did not face each other). Turkey and Switzerland, each 1–1, faced each other for the final advancement spot, with Turkey winning on touches received 58–70 after the individual bouts were tied 8–8.\nRound 2.\nThe top two teams in each pool advanced to the semifinals.\nPool 1.\nAustria and Hungary each defeated Uruguay, so Uruguay was eliminated and Austria and Hungary did not face each other.\nPool 2.\nBelgium defeated Germany, 9–7, while Great Britain and France each took 8 individual bouts and France won on touches received, 56–65. In the second set of matches, Germany defeated France and Great Britain defeated Belgium, each by 11–5. This left all four teams at 1–1, so the last matches were each winner-advances. Germany prevailed over Great Britain, 11–5. France had its second match of the round go to 8–8, winning again by touches received, 60–63.\nPool 3.\nThe Netherlands defeated Czechoslovakia 14–2. Italy then defeated Czechoslovakia, with the match stopped at 9–5 when Czechoslovakia's loss (and elimination) was assured.\nPool 4.\nPoland defeated Sweden, 15–1. The United States was supposed to face Turkey, who the Americans had defeated in the first round, but this match did not occur due to Turkey's non-competition. This was not a withdrawal from competition, as Turkey later faced Poland; nor does it seem to be a case of using the prior result again, as the official report points specifically to Turkey and states the team \"did not compete.\" Sports-reference gives the result as a win for the United States and loss for Turkey, with 0–0 individual bouts. The second set of matches in the round featured the United States against Sweden (stopped at a 9–1 United States win) and the aforementioned Poland–Turkey match (stopped at a 9–2 Poland win). Counting the U.S.–Turkey non-match as a United States win left Poland and the United States at 2–0 and advancing to the semifinals while Sweden and Turkey were 0–2 and eliminated; the third set of matches did not take place.\nSemifinals.\nThe top two teams in each pool advanced to the final.\nPool 1.\nIn the first set of matches, Poland defeated France (10–6) while Italy defeated Austria (9–7). In the second, the winners each won again to end the competition: Poland prevailed over Austria by touches received 56–60 (8–8 bouts) and Italy beat France with the match stopped at 9–2.\nPool 2.\nHungary defeated Germany, 15–1, while the United States beat the Netherlands, 9–7. In the second set of matches, Hungary again won 15–1, this time over the Netherlands, while Germany defeated the United States 9–7. In the final set of matches, Hungary beat the United States 14–2 and Germany defeated the Netherlands 9–3 with both of the winners earning advancement.\nFinal.\nIn the first set of matches, Hungary defeated Germany (13–3) while Italy defeated Poland (10–6). In the second, the winners each won again: Hungary prevailed over Poland (10–1) and Italy beat Germany (9–2). Both matches were stopped early as it became clear that Hungary and Italy would both be 2–0 and facing each other in the last set of matches while Germany and Poland would each by 0–2 and facing each other; there would be no tie in the standings to break through bouts lost. The Hungary–Italy match was a \"de facto\" gold medal final; Hungary reached 9 wins after 15 bouts to take the victory (9–6). Germany–Poland decided the bronze medal, with Germany taking that honor (9–3)."

        "title": "Cycling in Australia",
        "text": "Cycling in Australia is a common form of transport, recreation and sport.\nMany Australians enjoy cycling because it improves their health and reduces road congestion and air pollution. The government has encouraged more people to start, with several state advertising campaigns aimed at increasing safety for those who choose to ride. There is a common perception that riding is a dangerous activity. While it is safer to walk, cycling is a safer method of transport than driving. Cycling is less popular in Australia than in Europe, however cyclists make up one in forty road deaths and one in seven serious injuries.\nIn 2020, 1.7 million bicycle were sold\nHistory.\nBicycles arrived in Australia in 1860s, and the sport was quickly adopted with touring and racing clubs forming.\nBy the 1890s cycling was accessible to the middle class, and long distance cycle travelling was a fact of life for many sheep shearers and other agricultural labourers with migratory work. The bicycle and swag travelled much of Australia on dusty dirt tracks, long before the automobile made its appearance. In the main, however, long distance cycling was a sport of endurance or was done out of necessity.\nAt the same time, racing became quite popular with the Austral Wheel Race beginning in 1887, and leading to the development of the Malvern Star cycling brand. The first Melbourne to Warrnambool Classic, a long distance event, was held in October 1895, eight years before the first Tour de France.\nBetween 1990 and 1992 Australia become the first country to make wearing helmets compulsory, after a number of studies indicated that they reduced head injuries. After their introduction, the overall number of riders decreased, mostly due to a decline in children riding to school. This has not conclusively shown to be due to mandatory helmet laws and may have followed pre-existing trends dating from the 1970s.\nLaws.\nCyclists in every state are required to follow normal road rules, including using traffic lights correctly and observing give way and stop signs while riding on the road.\nCyclists in every state must wear helmets while in motion. In all states, cyclists must ride as close as practicable to the left side of the road when on a single lane road, however, cyclists may use any lane and does not have to keep to the left on a multi-lane road. All states require only one passenger per bicycle unless the bicycle is designed otherwise.\nBike users in Western Australia and Tasmania must use both hand signals, while in Victoria, Queensland, New South Wales, and Northern Territory cyclists must signal when turning right but it's not compulsory when turning left.\nCyclist must have at least one hand on handle bars in Western Australia, Northern Territory and Queensland.\nCyclist may ride on standard footpaths in Western Australia, Northern Territory, South Australia and Australian Capital Territory. In Victoria cyclists can only ride on a footpath if they're under the age of 13 or supervising a child under 13, or have a disability which restrains them from being able to ride on the road. In New South Wales cyclists can only ride on a footpath if they're under the age of 16 or supervising a child under 16. In Queensland cyclists can ride on any path as long as there isn't a sign stating otherwise.\nCyclists may ride in groups or bunches in all Australia States and territories, riding two abreast riders must be no more than 1.5 meters apart.\nCyclists across Australia must follow the same rules as motor vehicle drivers in regards to using mobile phones and consuming alcohol.\nCyclist also need to use a bike light when riding at night in Western Australia, Tasmania, Northern Territory, South Australia and Queensland.\nTypes of cycling.\nRecreational cycling.\nMany Australians ride a bike for recreation or commuting.\nIn 2017, 1.4% of commuters cycled to work of which 75% were male. Most are concentrated in the flatter parts of major cities, close to the central business district.\nIn 2023, 15% of Australians ride a bike at least weekly, 24% at least monthly and 37% at least yearly.\nThe National Cycling Strategy was tasked with doubling the number of people cycling from 2011 to 2016, which was not achieved. Demographic changes, and decreasing numbers of riders within capital cities accounted for most of the decrease. Some of the decrease within NSW has been blamed on increased cycling fines implemented in 2016.\nThe NCS has found that cycling was the most common in Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Australian Capital Territory during 2015. Victoria and Queensland have decreased in participation between 2011 and 2015.\nDoubling the number of bike users has the potential to increase the safety for all riders by helping to make drivers more aware of bicycles on the road, and adding pressure to those who already cycle to obey the road rules. More bike users also has an economic benefit which is estimated in Australia to be $1.43 per kilometre for every person cycled.\nCycling as a sport.\nAustralia hosts the Tour Down Under in January of every year; it is the first UCI World Tour event on the annual cycling calendar, and the only UCI World Tour in the southern hemisphere. Australians place strongly in cycling at the Olympic Games, UCI World Championships and other international events.\nAustralia has hosted the UCI Road World Championships, UCI Track Cycling World Championships and UCI Mountain Bike &amp; Trials World Championships. Most state capitals have an indoor velodrome.\nSafety.\nFatality data.\nIn Australia, police report road fatalities to the State and Territory road safety authorities. The Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics (BITRE) then catalogues this data in the Australian Road Deaths Database (ARDD).\nList of bicycle fatalities in Australia.\n2023.\nFootscray and Dock Link Road, Melbourne, 2 February 2023.\n&lt;mapframe latitude=\"-37.80778\" longitude=\"144.916216\" zoom=\"18\" text=\"Location of the crash\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\"&gt;\n \"type\": \"FeatureCollection\",\n \"features\": [\n \"type\": \"Feature\",\n \"geometry\": {\n \"type\": \"Point\",\n \"coordinates\": [144.916216,-37.807780]\n&lt;/mapframe&gt;On 2 February 2023, Angus Collins (22 year old) was killed by a truck driver while cycling his bike. The incident occurred around 12:30pm at the corner of Footscray Road and Dock Link Road in Melbourne. The bike lane crosses an intersection where the bike lane is partially obscured by a 3 metre wide pillar.\nContributing factors.\nThe bicycle advocacy organisation BikeWest said that it was “likely” the cyclist and the truck driver had simultaneous green lights. The Age newspaper reported that regular users of the road said the green lights are always simultaneous.\nThe transport planning document VicRoads Guidance on Treating Pedestrian and Turning Vehicle Conflicts at Signalised Intersections already states that a \"Fully Controlled\" left turn is \"appropriate\" for a bicycle priority route. It states potential locations are \"at intersections with a high number of turning heavy vehicles.\" A possible reason it wasn't implemented is the listed \"consideration\": \"Where the left turn is fully controlled, the potential negative perception from drivers while waiting to turn at times when there are no pedestrians crossing.\"\nBikeWest president John Symons commented that it was disappointing lessons had not been learned from the \"shockingly similar\" fatality of Arzu Karakoc who was killed in 2017 by a truck turning left across her path.\nAftermath.\nThe Amy Gillet Foundation, a cycling advocacy and safety group, called for safer road infrastructure so that mistakes by drivers do no cause a pedestrian or cyclist to be killed.\nAwards.\nThe Australian Bicycling Achievement Awards, an initiative of the Cycling Promotion Fund, have been held annually since 2002."

        "text": "Louise Veronica Arnold [\"Lou\"] (May 11, 1923 – May 27, 2010) was a female pitcher who played during four seasons for the South Bend Blue Sox of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Listed at 5' 5\", 145 lb., she batted and threw right-handed.\nThe All-American Girls Professional Baseball League was a circuit that began to operate in 1943. Since the only organized ball for women in the United States was softball, the league officials created a game which included both fast-pitch softball and baseball. Compared to softball, the crucial differences were that nine (not ten) players were used, and runners could lead off, slide and steal bases. In its twelve years of history the AAGPBL evolved through many stages. These differences varied from the beginning of the league, progressively extending the length of the base paths and pitching distance and decreasing the size of the ball until the final year of play in 1954. For the first five years the circuit used a fastpitch underhand motion, shifted to sidearm in 1947, and never really became baseball until overhand pitching began in 1948.\nA native of Pawtucket, Rhode Island, Arnold was the youngest of 13 children into the family of George and Mary Ann (née McCormick) Arnold, of English and Irish ancestry. She was a top all-around athlete in high school, and an AAGPBL scout signed her thinking that she had athletic abilities, endurance and fitness necessary to play baseball. Arnold attended to a league tryout in 1948. She had no baseball position, but the league was desperate for overhand pitchers, so she seemed like a good pitching prospect.\nArnold entered the league in 1948 with the South Bend Blue Sox, playing for them two years. Out in 1950 for undisclosed reasons, she returned in 1951 to South Bend for two more years. Her most productive season came in 1951, when she posted a 10–2 record for a league-high .833 winning percentage. She also hurled a no-hitter, tossed 32 consecutive scoreless innings, and completed nine of her twelve starts. In addition, Arnold was a member of two Blue Sox clubs to win consecutive titles in 1951 and 1952.\nFollowing her baseball career, Arnold lived in South Bend, Indiana for the rest of her life. She took a job at Bendix Corporation, where she worked on the brake line for thirty years.\nArnold was inducted into the South Bend Baseball Hall of Fame in 2005. She is also part of the AAGPBL permanent display at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum at Cooperstown, New York, opened in , which is dedicated to the entire league rather than any individual player. She died in South Bend, sixteen days after her 87th birthday."

They are intended to be worn pulled up just below the knee and cover the shins and calves and are designed to be hardwearing. The knee-high socks for rugby were designed to fit tightly around their calves and feet. The proper fitting is an important requirement that ensures players will not fall down when playing, and moreover, it should assist in preventing blisters.\nHistorically, rugby socks were made from a much thicker weave of material to cope with the more aggressive demands of the game compared to association football, but this is less common, and the two types are barely distinguishable."

Cornaggia-Medici, who had won gold in 1932, became the fourth man to win multiple medals in the individual épée. For the first time, France competed in the event but did not win any medals (snapping a four-Games podium streak).\nBackground.\nThis was the ninth appearance of the event, which was not held at the first Games in 1896 (with only foil and sabre events held) but has been held at every Summer Olympics since 1900.\nThree of the 12 finalists from the 1932 Games returned: gold medalist Giancarlo Cornaggia-Medici of Italy, fourth-place finisher Saverio Ragno of Italy, and tenth-place finisher Raúl Saucedo of Argentina. Hans Drakenberg of Sweden was the reigning (1935) World Champion as well as European champion; Pál Dunay of Hungary had been World Champion in 1934.\nBrazil, Poland, and Yugoslavia each made their debut in the event. Belgium and the United States each appeared for the eighth time, tied for most among nations.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition format was pool play round-robin, with bouts to three touches (unlike foil and sabre, but continuing the format from 1932). The format returned to four rounds. Not all bouts were played in some pools if not necessary to determine advancement. Two points were awarded for each bout won; if both fencers scored a hit simultaneously to make the bout 3–3, each received one point for the \"null match\". Ties were broken through fence-off bouts in early rounds if necessary for determining advancement, but by touches received in final rounds (and for non-advancement-necessary placement in earlier rounds).\nResults.\nRound 1.\nThe top five finishers in each pool advanced to the quarterfinals.\nPool 1.\nDe Beaumont is listed in 8th place and Schröder in 9th place in the official report, but Schröder had more points than de Beaumont.\nPool 7.\nIn the three-way tie for fourth, Martínez came last to da Silveira and Guthe, with the latter two advancing.\nPool 8.\nIn the three-way tie for fourth, Martínez came last to da Silveira and Guthe, with the latter two advancing.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe top five finishers in each pool advanced to the semifinals.\nQuarterfinal 1.\nIn the four-way tie for third place, Knutzen finished last in the play-off with Debeur, da Silveira, and Granfelt, with the latter three advancing.\nQuarterfinal 2.\nCampbell-Gray defeated Miclescu-Prăjescu in a play-off bout to break to the tie for fifth and last advancement spot. The official report lists Weber 9th and Duret 8th, though the scoring system would put Weber in 8th with fewer touches received.\nQuarterfinal 3.\nIt is unclear why Villamil did not face Barraza, Driebergen did not face Leal, and Boulad did not face Bay. In general, bouts unnecessary to advancement were not played, but each of the three men eliminated in 6th through 8th place were within 2 points of the 5th-place finisher Zalokostas and could have caught him with an additional win (or even tie for Villamil), though Zalokostas himself had an unplayed bout against Hammer Sørensen and could have added to his point total.\nSemifinals.\nThe top five finishers in each pool advanced to the semifinals.\nSemifinal 1.\nIn the four-way tie for third place, Pécheux finished last in the play-off with Debeur, Zalokostas, and Cornaggia-Medici, with the latter three advancing.\nSemifinal 2.\nIn the four-way tie for fifth place, Drakenberg won the play-off pool against Kantor, Fitting, and Lerdon.\nFinal.\nThe Italian fencers swept the medals. Ties in the final were broken by touches received, including Ragno taking silver to Cornaggia-Medici's bronze by a touches received score of 15–16 (Ragno had beaten Cornaggia-Medici head-to-head in the final after losing to him in the semifinal). Riccardi beat both of his countrymen in their bouts, ultimately taking gold with 1 point more than either despite winning 1 fewer bout due to his 3 ties."

        "title": "Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup bid",
        "text": "The Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup bid was a successful bid by Qatar to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup. With a population of 2 million people, Qatar was the first Arab state to host the World Cup. Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, son of Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani the then Emir of Qatar, was the chairman of the bid committee. Qatar promoted their hosting of the tournament as representing the Arab World, and has drawn support from across the member states of the Arab League. They also positioned their bid as an opportunity to bridge the gap between the Arab World and the West.\nIn November 2010, Qatar hosted a friendly match between Brazil and Argentina.\nFormer president of FIFA Sepp Blatter endorsed the idea of having a World Cup in the Arab World, saying in April 2010: \"The Arabic world deserves a World Cup. They have 22 countries and have not had any opportunity to organize the tournament\". Blatter also praised Qatar's progress: \"When I was first in Qatar there were 400,000 people here and now there are 1.6 million. In terms of infrastructure, when you are able to organise the Asian Games (in 2006) with more than 30 events for men and women, then that is not in question\". On the 2nd of December 2010, it was announced that Qatar will host the 2022 FIFA World Cup.\nClimate.\nWorking against the Qatar bid was the extreme temperature in the desert country. The World Cup always takes place during the European off-season in June and July. During this period the average daytime high in most of Qatar exceeds 40 °C (104 °F), the average daily low temperatures not dropping below 30 °C (86 °F). In response to this issue, Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, the 2022 Qatar bid chairman, has stated, \"the event has to be organized in June or July. We will have to take the help of technology to counter the harsh weather. We have already set in motion the process. A stadium with controlled temperature is the answer to the problem. We have other plans up our sleeves as well\".\nProposed stadiums.\nThe first five proposed stadiums for the World Cup were unveiled at the beginning of March 2010. The stadium will employ cooling technology capable of reducing temperatures within the stadium by up to 20°C (36°F), and the upper tiers of the stadium will be disassembled after the World Cup and donated to countries with less developed sports infrastructure. All five stadium projects have been designed by German architect Albert Speer &amp; Partners.\nThe air conditioning in the stadiums for both the players and spectators would be solar powered, carbon neutral and provided by Arup of England.\nThe Al-Khor Stadium is planned for Al-Khor city, located 50 kilometres north of Doha. The stadium will have a total capacity of 45,330, with 19,830 of the seats forming part of a temporary modular upper tier. The Al-Wakrah stadium, to be located in Al-Wakrah city in southern Qatar, will have a total capacity of 45,120 seats. The stadium will also contain a temporary upper tier of 25,500 seats. The stadium will be surrounded by large solar panels and decorated with Islamic art. The Al-Wakrah and Al-Khor stadiums would have been built regardless of whether Qatar was awarded the World Cup, according to the bid committee. However, the temporary upper-tier sections would not have been added if Qatar had lost the right to host the tournament. \n&lt;br&gt;\nControversy.\nBribery.\nDuring May 2011, bribery on the part of two members of the FIFA Executive Committee were tabled by Lord Triesman of the English FA. These allegations were based on information from a whistleblower involved with the Qatari bid. FIFA has since opened an internal inquiry into the matter, and would consider a revote on the 2022 World Cup if the allegations were proven. Former FIFA president Sepp Blatter conceded in 2011 that there was widespread support to re-hold the 2022 vote won by Qatar. \nIn testimony to a UK parliamentary inquiry board in May 2011 Lord Triesman alleged that Trinidad and Tobago's Jack Warner demanded $4 million for an education center in his country and Paraguay's Nicolás Léoz asked for an honorary knighthood in exchange for their votes. Also, two \"Sunday Times\" reporters testified that they had been told that Jacques Anouma of the Ivory Coast and Issa Hayatou of Cameroon were each paid $1.5 million to support Qatar's bid for the tournament. All four have denied the allegations. Mohammed bin Hammam, who played a key role in securing the games for Qatar, withdrew as a candidate for president of FIFA in May 2011 after being accused of bribing 25 FIFA officials to vote for his candidacy. Both Bin Hammam and Warner were suspended by FIFA in wake of these allegations, with Warner reacting to his suspension by questioning Blatter's conduct and adding that FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke had also told him that Qatar had bought the 2022 World Cup. Valcke subsequently issued a statement denying he had suggested it was bribery, saying instead that the country had \"used its financial muscle to lobby for support\".\nQatar officials denied any impropriety and insist that the corruption allegations are being driven by envy and mistrust by those who do not want the World Cup staged in Qatar. Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker gave an interview to German media in June 2014 stating that \"The country is not getting the respect it deserves over its efforts to hold the World Cup and that the Qatari Emir strictly punishes and forbids instances of corruption and bribery with a zero-tolerance policy\".\nAccording to leaked documents seen by \"The Sunday Times\", Qatari state-owned television channel Al Jazeera (now beIN Sport) secretly offered $400 million to FIFA, for broadcasting rights, just 21 days before FIFA announced that Qatar will hold the 2022 World Cup. The contract also documented a secret TV deal between FIFA and Qatar's state run media broadcast Al Jazeera that $100 million will also be paid into a designated FIFA account only if Qatar wins the World Cup ballot in 2010. An additional $480 million was also offered by the State of Qatar government, three years after the initial offer, which brings the amount to $880 million offered by Qatar to host the 2022 world cup. The documents are now part of the bribery inquiry by Swiss Police. FIFA refused to comment on the inquiry and responded to The Sunday Times in an email and wrote “allegations linked to the Fifa World Cup 2022 bid have already been extensively commented by Fifa, who in June 2017 published the Garcia report in full on Fifa.com. Furthermore, please note that Fifa lodged a criminal complaint with the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland, which is still pending. Fifa is and will continue to cooperate with the authorities.” A beIN spokesman said in a statement that the company would not “respond to unsubstantiated or wildly speculative allegations.”\nHuman rights and the conditions of migrant workers.\nThe use of migrant labour in Qatar's construction of the tournament's numerous new stadiums has been a major source of debate around the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Amnesty International, a human rights organization, judged Qatar for its treatment of migrant workers and argued in a 56-page report that Qatar fell short to look into, address, and prevent the passing away of these workers. \nAfter all these years of Qatar being brought to light for its human rights records, what the public has been able to observe are the reforms the nation made to clear up its record and create room for structural improvement, as per a report by The Peninsula Qatar that claimed the nation raised awareness through seminars, lectures, and training workshops in the local community. A specialized department for the promotion and defence of human rights was established, and it carried out its inspection and service duties for the general dissemination of the significance of human rights reforms. These actions were taken in May 2023 when the MoI (Minister of interior) hosted a seminar on \"Services of the Human Rights Department to the Public\" that also covered the services offered to the general public by the department, including the procedures used to carry out human rights.\nHowever the measures, which became enforceable on August 30, 2020, introduced a mandatory minimum wage of 1,000 Qatari riyal (roughly $275 USD) per month and made it easy for migrant workers to switch jobs before the end of their contracts without first requiring a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from their employer. Employers must give workers a living wage or provide allowances to cover these costs in addition to the raised minimum wage for everybody. All this was revealed in a report published by the Human rights watch. In their article, which was published in September 2020, experts from the OHCHR (Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights) added, \"We are very encouraged by the bold steps Qatar is taking to increase the protection of migrant workers' rights and ensure adequate living and working conditions for all.\"\nThe football associations of several countries qualified for the tournament have taken stands against these alleged human rights violations, and teams such as the Netherlands and Germany have made symbolic protest actions to show their disapproval.\nResponding to the allegation that as many as 6,500 migrant workers may have died as the result of inhumane labour conditions, representatives from Qatar's labor ministry have stated that \"no other country has come so far on labour reform in such a short amount of time, but we acknowledge that there is more work to be done\". After a thorough investigation, the International Labour Organization, claimed the figures \"misleading\" and said they had been wrongly linked to World Cup sites without proper context in November 2022 via reported drafted by France24. The country did successfully reimbursed US$320 million to wage abuse victims through the Workers’ Support and Insurance Fund stated the ILO in November 2022.\nFurthermore, according to a statement by ITUC (International Trade Union Confederation) General Secretary Sharan Burrow, who had previously been a harsh critic of Qatar's labour laws, workers can now obtain justice in the country. She praised \"the amazing change of the labour legislation in Qatar.\" \nExtreme climate.\nThe World Cup is usually held in the northern hemisphere summer. During this season in Qatar, the temperature can get to . Qatar says that this will not be a problem for it hosting the World Cup. A section from Qatar 2022 Bid official site explains:\nAn example of this occurred during the 2018 World Cup qualifier with China under air conditioning, which happened on 8 October 2015.\nSuch cooling techniques will be able to reduce temperatures from , which would be comfortable for players and spectators during matches, the bid also proposes these cooling technologies to be used in fan-zones, training pitches and walkways between Metro stations and stadia.\nBut if anyone enters an area without this technology, they may still be exposed to extreme levels of heat.\nQatar declared their intention to change the dates of the World Cup to winter immediately upon being award the Cup because of all the controversy surrounding the topic.\nAlcohol.\nAlcohol can currently be consumed legally in hotel bars and clubs by showing a passport for reporting and a special permit to attend the club. The question of whether alcohol was allowed to be consumed in additional areas and at the games themselves was asked, Hassan Abdullah al Thawed, chief executive of the Qatar 2022 World Cup bid, said the Muslim state would also permit alcohol consumption during the World Cup. Qatar's bid promised that beer would be permitted at stadia, but this promise was reneged just days before the first game. A few specific fan-zones were set up during the event, that would provide alcohol for sale. Also certain bars were developed for all the tourists coming to support their chosen teams in the World Cup."

        "text": "The men's foil was one of seven fencing events on the fencing at the 1936 Summer Olympics programme. It was the ninth appearance of the event. The competition was held from 5 August 1936 to 6 August 1936. 62 fencers from 22 nations competed. Nations were limited to three fencers. The event was won by Giulio Gaudini of Italy, the nation's second consecutive and fourth overall victory in the men's foil (matching France for most all-time). Gaudini, who had won bronze medals in 1928 and 1932, was the first man to win three medals in the event. His countryman Giorgio Bocchino took bronze. Edward Gardère put France back on the podium after a one-Games absence.\nBackground.\nThis was the ninth appearance of the event, which has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1908 (when there was a foil display only rather than a medal event). Seven of the ten 1932 finalists returned: silver medalist (and 1928 finalist) Joe Levis of the United States, two-time bronze medalist Giulio Gaudini and fourth-place finisher Gioacchino Guaragna of Italy, fifth-place finisher Erwin Casmir of Germany, sixth-place finisher Emrys Lloyd of Great Britain, and seventh-place finisher Roberto Larraz and tenth-place finisher Ángel Gorordo of Argentina. Gaudini, the 2.00 metres tall Italian, was one of the best fencers of the 1920s and 1930s and was one of the favorites in Berlin. His main competition were his fellow Italians and the French team, particularly European champion André Gardère and his brother Edward Gardère.\nBrazil and Bulgaria each made their debut in the men's foil. The United States made its eighth appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the inaugural 1896 competition.\nCompetition format.\nThe event used a five-round format. In each round, the fencers were divided into pools to play a round-robin within the pool. Bouts were to five touches. Not all bouts were played in some pools if not necessary to determine advancement. Two points were awarded for each bout won. Ties were broken through fence-off bouts in early rounds if necessary for determining advancement, but by touches received in final rounds (and for non-advancement-necessary placement in earlier rounds). Standard foil rules were used, including that touches had to be made with the tip of the foil, the target area was limited to the torso, and priority determined the winner of double touches.\nResults.\nRound 1.\nThe top 4 finishers in each pool advanced to round 2.\nPool 3.\nPecora defeated Pearce in a play-off for the fourth qualification spot.\nPool 4.\nThe three-way tie for third was determined by play-off, with Goyoaga coming last against Tingdahl and Jesenský resulting in the latter two fencers advancing.\nPool 6.\nThe three-way tie for third was determined by play-off, with Valenzuela coming last against Bay and Frølich resulting in the latter two fencers advancing.\nPool 8.\nAlessandroni defeated Bartlett in a tie-breaker play-off.\nRound 2.\nThe top 4 finishers in each pool advanced to round 3.\nPool 4.\nIt is unclear why Marion did not face at least one of Bembis and Lloyd; two additional wins would have placed Marion even with Leidersdorff and Abdin in points (though they each had additional bouts that could have earned them more, if necessary).\nPool 6.\nLjungquist defeated Pecora in a tie-breaker play-off.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe top 4 finishers in each pool advanced to the semifinals.\nQuarterfinal 2.\nThe three-way tie for third was determined by play-off, with Maszlay coming last against Bru and Losert resulting in the latter two fencers advancing.\nSemifinals.\nThe top 4 finishers in each pool advanced to the final.\nSemifinal 2.\nThe three-way tie for third was determined by play-off, with Maszlay coming last against Bru and Losert resulting in the latter two fencers advancing.\nFinal.\nIn the final pool, ties—including the tie for the bronze medal—were broken by touches received rather than by play-offs as in previous rounds."

The competition was held from 7 August 1936 to 8 August 1936. 108 fencers from 21 nations competed. Each team could have a maximum of six fencers, with four participating in any given match.\nThe competition format continued the pool play round-robin from prior years. Each of the four fencers from one team would face each of the four from the other, for a total of 16 bouts per match. Individual bouts were to 3 touches. Individual bouts awarded 2 points to the victor's team, or 1 point to each team if the individual bout was a 3–3 tie. The team with more points won the match, with competition potentially stopping when one team reached 17 points out of the possible 32, if further competition was not necessary to determine tie-breakers for advancement. If the points were tied at 16, touches received was used to determine the winning team. Pool matches unnecessary to the result were not played.\nResults.\nRound 1.\nThe top two teams in each pool advanced to round 2.\nPool 1.\nPoland defeated Portugal, 18 points to 14 (9–7). Switzerland defeated Poland on touches received, 32–35, after the points were tied at 16–16 with bouts won 8–8. Portugal defeated Switzerland 9–7 (18–14 on points). Switzerland was eliminated.\nPool 2.\nThe Netherlands defeated Denmark, 18 points to 14, with an 8–6–2 individual bout result. The United States–Denmark match was stopped after 12 of 16 bouts when the Americans reached 18 points, 9–3. The United States did not play the Netherlands, as both advanced while Denmark was eliminated.\nPool 3.\nGreat Britain defeated Chile, 26 points to 6, with a 12–2–2 individual bout result. The France–Chile match was stopped after 9 of 16 bouts when the French team reached 17 points, 8–0–1. France did not play Great Britain, as both advanced while Chile was eliminated.\nPool 4.\nEgypt defeated Austria, 18 points to 14, with a 9–7 individual bout result. The Sweden–Austria match was stopped after 10 of 16 bouts when the Swedes reached 18 points, 9–1. Sweden did not play Egypt, as both advanced while Austria was eliminated.\nPool 5.\nArgentina defeated Greece, 26 points to 6, with an 11–1–4 individual bout result. The Belgium–Greece match was stopped after 11 of 16 bouts when the Belgians reached 17 points, 8–2–1. Belgium did not play Argentina, as both advanced while Greece was eliminated.\nPool 6.\nCzechoslovakia defeated Hungary, 17 points to 15, with an 8–7–1 individual bout result. The Italy–Hungary match was stopped after 11 of 16 bouts when the Italians reached 17 points, 8–2–1. Italy did not play Czechoslovakia, as both advanced while Hungary was eliminated.\nPool 7.\nGermany defeated Canada, 22 points to 10, with an 11–5 individual bout result. Canada then defeated Brazil, 17–15 points (8–7–1 bouts). The Germany–Brazil match resulted in a German win, 19–13 on points (9–6–1 bouts). This put Germany in first place at 2–0, Canada second at 1–1, and Brazil eliminated in third place at 0–2.\nRound 2.\nThe top two teams in each pool advanced to the semifinals.\nPool 1.\nThe United States defeated Czechoslovakia, 20 points to 12 (10–6). Italy also defeated Czechoslovakia, with the match stopped when Italy reached 17 points as it was then clear that Czechoslovakia was eliminated and the other two teams advanced.\nPool 2.\nSweden and Egypt were from the same first-round pool, but had not played each other yet. Both of those teams won their first matches, over the Netherlands and Germany, respectively (with Egypt winning on touches received 34–36 in a very close match). Both teams then lost their second matches, with the Sweden–Germany match also very close (Germany winning this time, 17 points to 15 in an 8–7–1 result). This left all four teams at 1–1, with the Sweden–Egypt and Netherlands–Germany matches both being winner-advances. Egypt was unable to win a single bout, with Sweden prevailing at 8–0–1; Germany defeated Netherlands with 9 wins in the first 13 bouts.\nPool 3.\nBelgium and Argentina advanced from the same first-round pool, but had not yet faced each other. They did so in the first match of this round, with Belgium prevailing on touches received (34–35) after the individual bouts were 8–8. Argentina then lost to Portugal, with the match stopped when Portugal reached 18 points (9–5).\nPool 4.\nThe Poland–Canada match came down to touches received after the bouts were 8–8, which Poland won 35–36. France defeated Great Britain 19 points to 13 (9–6–1). The victors in the first matches also won the second matches, with Poland beating Great Britain 18 points to 8 (13 bouts, 8–3–2) and France prevailing over Canada 26 points to 6 (13–3).\nSemifinals.\nThe top two teams in each pool advanced to the final.\nSemifinal 1.\nFrance and Poland advanced from the same second-round pool, but had not faced each other. France beat Germany and Belgium beat Poland in the first pair of matches. Germany defeated Belgium while France beat Poland in the second pair, putting France at 2–0, Germany and Belgium at 1–1, and Poland at 0–2. Poland's best hope was for a three-way tie for second at 1–2, but was unable to defeat Germany (falling 17 points to 5). France defeated Belgium, eliminating the latter team as well.\nPool 2.\nItaly and the United States were from the same second-round pool, but had not played each other yet. Italy won in the match between them in the first pairing, with Sweden prevailing over Portugal in the other first pairing. Sweden then defeated the United States and Italy beat Portugal. This left Italy and Sweden at 2–0 while Portugal and the United States were at 0–2, so the third set of matches was not played as unnecessary to determine advancement.\nFinal.\nFrance defeated Germany again, while Italy faced Sweden for the first time and won. In the second set of pairings, Sweden defeated Germany and Italy beat France. This put Italy at 2–0, Sweden and France at 1–1, and Germany at 0–2 (and out of contention for the gold medal). In the final matches, Italy bested Germany without much difficulty (17 points to 4) to give the former the gold medal and the latter fourth place. The match between Sweden and France then became a silver/bronze match. It was as close as could be, with the individual bouts finishing 8–8. Sweden just barely prevailed on touches received, however, winning 31–32 to take silver and give France bronze."

A total of 41 events were contested, of which 22 by male and 19 by female athletes. The competition featured only track and field events as there was no marathon race and the 20 km walk was held on the track.\nThe host country, China, dominated the proceedings by winning the most gold medals and having the highest overall total. Chinese athletes won 29 of the 41 events, and won all of the women's competitions except two sprinting events. Japan was a clear second with a total of 29 medals, while South Korea was the third-most successful nation. All the countries at the Games won at least one medal in the athletics competition, with the sole exception of Macau.\nWang Huei-Chen, representing Chinese Taipei, was the only woman to upset the Chinese hegemony and she won the gold in both the 100 metres and 200 metres events. Qu Yunxia won the 1500 metres – an event that she went on to set a long-standing world record in at the 1993 Chinese National Games. The hammer throw saw 18-year-old Koji Murofushi (later an Olympic champion) reach his first international podium, winning a bronze medal. Zhang Lirong became the first and only women's 3000 metres champion of the Games as the event was replaced with the 5000 metres in 1997. Three athletes reached the podium in two individual events: Li Yong-Ae of North Korea won silver medals in the long and triple jump, her teammate Choi Ok-Soon was the 800 m and 1500 m bronze medallist, and Lee Myung-Sun won the javelin silver and shot put bronze.\nA number of athletes went on to further success at the 1994 Asian Games: among the men's East Asian Games gold medallists, Lee Jin-Il, Shunji Karube, Takahisa Yoshida, Bi Zhong and Zhang Lianbiao also became the Asian champion in their event. On the women's side, Wang Huei-Chen, Qu Yunxia and Min Chunfeng went on to add the 1994 Asian gold to their East Asian titles."

        "title": "Rugby Europe Under-18 Championship",
        "text": "The Rugby Europe Under-18 Championship is an annual rugby union championship for Under-18 national teams, held since 2004. The championship is organised by rugby's European governing body, Rugby Europe.\nIt has been held alternatingly in France and Italy, except for 2012 when it was held in Spain. The past editions were won by France, who won the championship in 2004, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010, and England, which won it in 2005, 2006 and 2012. Ireland became the third nation to win the tournament when they beat England in the 2011 final.\nHistory.\nThe European Under-18 Rugby Union Championship was first held in 2004, in Treviso, Italy. It replaced the previously held European Under-18 Emergent Nations Championship, which had first been held in 2000. The first championship in 2004 was won by France.\nThe following two championships, held in Lille, France, in 2005 and again in Treviso in 2006, were won by England. Alternating between France and Italy, the next four championships were held in Biarritz, Treviso again, Toulon and once more in Treviso in 2010. All four were won by France. Wales and Scotland did not compete in those years, and England did not compete in 2010.\nThe 2011 edition of the competition saw the introduction of an elite division, above division one, the former A, made up of four teams, France, England, Wales and Ireland. The divisions below remained unchanged. It marked the first time that all countries participating in the six nations send a team to the European championship. The 2011 tournament was held in the regions of Armagnac and Bigorre, in southern France. It was won by Ireland and saw the French team not reaching the final for the first time.\nEngland, Ireland, Wales, Scotland and Italy left the tournament for the 2016 edition.\nOn March 12, 2020, following the recent evolution of COVID-19, Rugby Europe has announced a suspension of all its matches and tournaments, from Friday, March 13, 2020 until April 15, 2020. On March 26 Rugby Europe has decided to extend the suspension of all its matches and tournaments for an indefinite period of time. On April 8 Rugby Europe Board of Directors decided to cancel 2019 European Under-18 Rugby Union Championship.\nFormat.\nIn 2010, the championship, similar to previous editions, was organised in an A, B and C Division, with A being the highest and C the lowest. Each division consisted of eight teams and each team played three competition games, with a quarter final, semi final and final/placing game. The D division, unlike in the past, was held in a separate tournament in 2010.\nThe quarter finals were played according to a seeding list, with the winners moving on to the first to fourth place semi finals while the losers would enter the fifth to eighth place semi finals.\nThe winners of the semi-finals one to four would play in the division final while the losers would play for third place. Similarly, the winners of the fifth to eighth semi finals would play for fifth place while the losers would play for seventh.\nThe winner of the A division was crowned European champions while the eighth placed team would be relegated to the B division. Similarly, the winner of B and C division would move up a division for 2011 while the last placed teams would be relegated. This meant, France was crowned European champions while Romania finished on the relegation spot. Portugal won the B division and earned promotion while the Ukraine was relegated and replaced by Sweden, the C champions.\nThe 2011 format saw the introduction of a four-team elite division. Below this level, the divisions remained unchanged but were now numbered instead of being ordered by letters.\nIn 2012 the modus was changed once more. The elite division now consisted of eight teams, as did the A and B divisions, with all three played at the same time and location while the C division consisted of four and the D division of three teams and were played separately.\nDivisional champions.\nEmergent nations championship 2000 to 2003:\nThe divisional champions from 2004 to 2010:\nThe divisional champions after the reorganisation in 2011:\nThe divisional champions after the reorganisation in 2016:\nPlacings.\nThe placings in the championship in order of the 2019 results:"

        "text": "Brian O'Driscoll is an Irish international rugby union player who retired at the end of the 2013–14 season. He is a former captain of Ireland and also captained the British &amp; Irish Lions. O'Driscoll, who spent the majority of his career playing at centre, made 133 appearances for Ireland, scoring 46 tries—an Irish record. In addition to this he made eight appearances for the Lions and scored one try, which occurred during the Lions' victory over Australia on the 2001 tour. , and with a combined total of 47 international tries, O'Driscoll sits eighth on the all-time record list, and is also top of the all-time try-scoring list for the Six Nations with 26. In addition, he retired with 141 caps in all, which at that time was the most in the sport's history (this record has since been surpassed by Richie McCaw of New Zealand [148 caps], Sergio Parisse of Italy [142] and Alun Wyn Jones of Wales [also 142]).\nO'Driscoll made his international debut on 12 June 1999 against Australia at the Ballymore Stadium in Brisbane. He scored his first try for Ireland during his fourth match, against the United States in the 1999 Rugby World Cup at Lansdowne Road. It was the first of 19 tries O'Driscoll scored there (including 2 after the venue was redeveloped as the Aviva Stadium) which, , is a record. O'Driscoll went on to score tries in the 2003, 2007 and 2011 Rugby World Cup tournaments. His 33rd international try earned him the IRPA Try of the Year award in 2008 for a team try scored during Ireland's 18–12 defeat against Australia. Starting from a lineout inside their own 22, Ireland caught their own kick as they moved up to the halfway line. An exchange of passes culminated with O'Driscoll receiving the ball out before scoring.\nO'Driscoll scored multiple tries in a single international on six occasions, included in these were two hat-tricks. The first of these was scored against France during the 2000 Six Nations and the second came against Scotland in the 2002 Six Nations. O'Driscoll, who scored tries against all of the \"Tier 1\" nations, was most prolific against France, scoring eight times."

        "text": "The 2010 European Under-18 Rugby Union Championship was the seventh annual international rugby union competition for Under 18 national rugby union teams in Europe. The event was organised by rugby's European governing body, the FIRA – Association of European Rugby (FIRA-AER). The competition was contested by 24 men's junior national teams and was held in late March and early April 2010. It was hosted by the Italian region of Veneto, with the final played at the home ground of Benetton Treviso.\nThe tournament was won by France, who won its fifth European championship and its fourth in a row, with Ireland finishing runners-up.\nIt was sponsored by French company Justin Bridou and therefore officially called the \"2010 Justin Bridou European Under-18 Rugby Union Championship\".\nOverview.\nHistory.\nThe European Under-18 Rugby Union Championship was first held in 2004, in Treviso, Italy. It replaced the previously held European Under-18 Emergent Nations Championship, which had first been held in 2000. The first championship in 2004 was won by France.\nThe following two championships, held in Lille, France, in 2005 and again in Treviso in 2006, were won by England. Alternating between France and Italy, the next four championships were held in Biarritz, Treviso again, Toulon and once more in Treviso in 2010. All four were taken out by France, but of Europes top rugby playing nations, England, Wales and Scotland did not take part in the latest edition.\nFormat.\nThe championship, similar to previous editions, was organised in an A, B and C Division, with A being the highest and C the lowest. Each division consisted of eight teams and each team played three competition games, with a quarter final, semi final and final/placing game.\nThe quarter finals were played according to a seeding list, with the winners moving on to the first to fourth place semi finals while the losers would enter the fifth to eighth place semi finals.\nThe winners of the semi-finals one to four would play in the division final while the losers would play for third place. Similarly, the winners of the fifth to eighth semi finals would play for fifth place while the losers would play for seventh.\nThe winner of the A division was crowned European champions while the eighth placed team would be relegated to the B division. Similarly, the winner of B and C division would move up a division for 2011 while the last placed teams would be relegated. This meant, France was crowned European champions while Romania finished on the relegation spot. Portugal won the B division and earned promotion while the Ukraine was relegated and replaced by Sweden, the C champions.\nVenues.\nThe games of the 2010 championship were played at five different locations and stadiums:\nChanges for 2011.\nThe 2011 edition of the championship is scheduled to see a return of the absent three home nations, England, Scotland and Wales. For this purpose, the A division will be enlarged to twelve teams, while B and C remain at their current strength.\nD Division.\nThe D division forms the fourth level, below the C division, of European Under-18 rugby. In 2010, only four teams compete at this level, at a tournament held at Chișinău, Moldova, from 19 to 22 May 2010. It consists of the teams of Moldova, Israel, Croatia and Norway.\nTeams and final standings.\nThe participating teams and their final standings were:\nGames.\nThe results of the games:\nB Division.\nRelegation.\nThe Switzerland versus Ukraine game was tied after regular time and was decided by penalty kicks.\nC Division.\nRelegation.\nThe Denmark versus Austria game was tied after regular time and was decided by penalty kicks.\nD Division.\nHeld at a different time and location as the other three divisions, in Moldova, these are the results:"

        "text": "The 2010 Giro d'Italia began on 8 May, and stage 11 occurred on 19 May. The race began in Amsterdam in the Netherlands with an individual time trial and two flat stages before transferring to Italy. The transfer made an uncommonly early rest day in a Grand Tour, coming just three days into the three-week race. Many crashes occurred in the stages in the Netherlands, leading to some unexpected big time gaps before the transfer to Italy. Three different riders led the race after the three days in the Netherlands.\nThe first stage in Italy was a team time trial, the fifth successive year the discipline has featured in the Giro. This stage transferred the race lead to a fourth rider in as many stages, Vincenzo Nibali. Though many of the stages in the first half of the Giro were flat or undulating, and theoretically fairly straightforward, there were repeated large time gaps from day to day. The first mountain stage was stage 8, which concluded with a long climb to Monte Terminillo.\nStage 11 was the longest in the race, and featured another surprise, a 50-strong breakaway which greatly shook up the overall standings before the more mountainous second half of the Giro. Alexander Vinokourov had held the race lead prior to that stage, but lost it to Richie Porte, who figured into the winning break.\nStage 1.\n8 May 2010 — Amsterdam (Netherlands), (individual time trial)\nThe Giro opened with a short, flat time trial in Amsterdam, the ninth time that the Giro has begun outside Italy. There were a number of tight turns in the course, which began at the Museumplein and ended at the Olympic Stadium, making for a stage that favored time trial specialists.\nIntermittent rain made the time trial difficult for various riders throughout the day. 's Andriy Hryvko, the five-time defending Ukrainian national time trial champion, set the first real time to beat early on the day, clocking in at 10'31\". Hryvko was the 14th man to leave the starthouse, and his time held up until the 60th man, 's Gustav Larsson, time trial silver medalist from the most recent world championships and Olympics, was six seconds better at 10'25\".\nAn hour and a half later, the day's biggest surprise came when Brent Bookwalter from Cadel Evans' , riding in his first Grand Tour, put up 10'20\" as the day's new best time. The only man to do better on the day was captain and time trial specialist Bradley Wiggins, stopping the clock in 10'18\" to earn the first pink jersey. Of the Giro's overall favorites, Evans finished best-placed, on the same time as Bookwalter for third place.\nStage 1 result and general classification after stage 1\nStage 2.\n9 May 2010 — Amsterdam (Netherlands) to Utrecht (Netherlands), \nThe first road race of the 2010 Giro was flat, starting in Amsterdam and ending in Utrecht. Two very small climbs occurred shortly before the midpoint of the stage, to decide the first wearer of the green jersey. The roads leading into the finish in Utrecht twist and turn repeatedly.\nThere were a large number of crashes during the stage, which commentators and team managers alike described as unprecedented. The course was noted to have a lot of street furniture on it, which compounded with riders' nerves as the number of crashes mounted higher and higher to make the day of racing more perilous.\nThe day's breakaway numbered four – Paul Voss, Rick Flens, Stefano Pirazzi, and Mauro Facci. , at the head of the peloton, allowed them a little over 5 minutes' advantage before they set to making the chase. One of the day's massive crashes occurred with for the peloton, bringing down around 30 riders, including race leader Bradley Wiggins. Around this time, Flens tried to solo from the leading group, but the peloton caught him with left to race. Another huge crash took place from the finish line, depleting the leading group to only 58 riders and leaving Wiggins and Carlos Sastre, among others, 37 seconds back at the finish. The stage ended in a sprint finish, as expected, which was won by Tyler Farrar. Cadel Evans took over the leaders jersey.\nStage 3.\n10 May 2010 — Amsterdam (Netherlands) to Middelburg (Netherlands), \nStarting again from Amsterdam, stage 3 included portions dipping below sea level. The route headed south from Amsterdam along the North Sea, crossing through the islands of Zeeland before ending in Middelburg on Walcheren.\nCrosswinds blowing from the coast fractured the peloton early on. The day's breakaway, comprising Olivier Kaisen, Jérôme Pineau, and Tom Stamsnijder was caught well before the end of the stage. It appeared for much of the day that Damiano Cunego would lose over a minute to the race's overall favorites after he missed a selection early on and rode much of the stage behind them. His group also contained André Greipel and Greg Henderson, however, and their teams made an effective chase to catch back up to race leader Cadel Evans' group.\nWith left to race, a major crash occurred, taking down most of , including Henderson and former race leader Bradley Wiggins. The crash also brought down Christian Vande Velde, who was forced to retire. It made for a crucial selection, as 29 riders at the head of the peloton were able to avoid it and finished 46 seconds better than Evans' group. Greipel was present in the leading group for the sprint finish, but he was unable to respond to the sprint kick from 's Wouter Weylandt, who easily took the stage win. The best-placed rider in the general classification in the leading group was Alexander Vinokourov, who became the third rider in as many days to pull on the pink jersey.\nDespite the course's extremely flat profile, large time gaps resulted from the stage. Alessandro Petacchi and darkhorse overall contender Domenico Pozzovivo missed an early selection and never recovered, finishing eight minutes back along with riders like Marzio Bruseghin, Filippo Pozzato, and Gilberto Simoni. Five riders including Wiggins lost four minutes, and the last group on the road lost nearly 15 minutes.\nStage 4.\n12 May 2010 — Savigliano to Cuneo, (team time trial)\nAfter the transfer to Italy, which took the riders to Savigliano in the Piedmont, the first stage on Italian soil was, as it had been since 2006, a team time trial. The route was on a slight uphill for its duration, which was atypical for a team time trial. The course headed south on mainly straight roads from Savigliano to Cuneo, with intermediate time checks in Genola and Centallo.\nThe fourth team to leave the starthouse, Cadel Evans' , set the early time to beat, bettering the teams before them by nearly a minute. Their time of 37'58\" stood for close to an hour, with the teams that followed them failing to beat provisional second place team 's time of 38'40\". The first team faster than BMC was , with Mikhail Ignatiev pulling his teammates to a time of 37'04\", eventually fourth at the end of the day. Stage favorites took the course just after the Russian team and brought five riders home in 36'50\" to take over the top spot. After and both turned in solid rides, at 37'23\" and 37'15\" respectively, another favorite in was next on the road. The team rode without one of its captains, Christian Vande Velde, who had been forced to retire from the Giro in the last stage in the Netherlands after crashing. His remaining teammates had wanted to dedicate their prospective victory to him, but Vandevelde's presence proved sorely missed as the team managed only 37'26\" and eighth on the day.\nThe last four teams to start were , , , and , with the pink jersey hanging in the balance as the four teams had riders tightly bunched in the overall standings from the previous stage. Liquigas-Doimo had all nine riders together as they entered Cuneo, while other teams lost riders early and often in the stage. Six crossed the finish line together in 36'37\", supplanting Team Sky for best on the day. Team HTC-Columbia and Team Saxo Bank both failed to top Liquigas-Doimo in their rides, meaning Vincenzo Nibali stood to be the fourth new race leader in a row pending current race leader Alexander Vinokourov and team Astana's ride. The Kazakh team lost Alexsandr Dyachenko, Valentin Iglinskiy, and Enrico Gasparotto early in their ride, having only six riders together for most of the stage. Roman Kireyev fell off with 3 kilometers left, and Gorazd Štangelj also lost the pace well before the finish line. Štangelj rode back to his teammates the first time he came off the back, but he lost the pace again in the final kilometer. A visibly upset Vinokourov had to sit up and wait for him, costing the team the seconds they needed to keep Vinokourov in the pink jersey. Nibali became the new race leader.\nStage 5.\n13 May 2010 — Novara to Novi Ligure, \nAfter another transfer, the fifth stage was flat, entering Liguria, with two short climbs occurring about two-thirds of the way into the stage. The stage paid tribute to Fausto Coppi, passing through his hometown of Castellania and ending in Novi Ligure, where he lived later in his life. Novi Ligure was also the hometown of Costante Girardengo, also honored in this stage. The riders saw the finish line in Novi Ligure twice, taking a finishing circuit in the town.\nA four-man breakaway distinguished themselves after . The group consisted of Yukiya Arashiro, Jérôme Pineau, Julien Fouchard, and mountains classification leader Paul Voss, after a move instigated by Arashiro. Voss sat up after the second small climb on the course, having taken first-place points on both. The group's maximum time gap was four minutes, at the Passo Coppi in Castellania. set to making the chase, but for a while they were the only team chasing, meaning the time gap did not fall very fast – it was still 2'50\" by the to go mark.\nThe teams of the race's other premier sprinters joined the chase in the finishing circuit in Novi Ligure. With to go, Arashiro, Pineau, and Fouchard held a tenuous lead of under one minute. The chase continued into the final kilometer, and the three managed to stay away by a margin of 4 seconds over the hard-charging sprinters at the head of the peloton. Pineau was the winner, over Fouchard in second. Reactions to the failure to catch the breakaway varied, from finger-pointing to complaints over the Giro directors' descriptions of the finishing circuit to simply crediting the leading trio for their combativity. With the win, Pineau took over the lead in the points classification, earning the red jersey for stage six. There was no significant change to the race's overall standings.\nStage 6.\n14 May 2010 — Fidenza to Marina di Carrara, \nAnother transfer took the riders to the Fidenza in the region of Emilia-Romagna. Stage 6 was categorized intermediate, going over the Passo del Brattello after and the Spolverina and the Bedizzano climbs shortly before the finish.\nAfter of racing, Matthew Lloyd and Rubens Bertogliati became the day's signature break. Since they posed no threat to the overall standings, with Lloyd at 11'13\" back of race leader Vincenzo Nibali the better-placed of the two, the peloton was content to allow them a big lead. Their maximum advantage was six minutes, before the ascent of the day's second climb, when a five-man chase group formed. The five cut into the leaders' advantage very quickly at first, but they were unable to make the bridge, being eventually swept back up by the peloton. On the ascent of the Bedizzano, from the finish line, Lloyd shed Bertogliati and rode the rest of the way to the stage win on his own. He was first over all three of the day's climbs, and so took the green jersey as mountains classification leader. Bertogliati was very nearly absorbed by the peloton in the stage's final kilometer, staying out in front of them by only 9 seconds to hold on to second place. Danilo Hondo led the peloton across the line and momentarily thought he had won the stage, lifting his arms as he crossed the line.\nPaolo Tiralongo, who had been in tenth overall and was considered a key support rider for Alexander Vinokourov, crashed at the mark. He was taken off the road in an ambulance, but was not seriously hurt. squad leader Guillaume Bonnafond crashed at the same time and suffered a gash near his right eye. Both riders retired from the Giro.\nStage 7.\n15 May 2010 — Carrara to Montalcino, \nStage 7 was also an intermediate stage, beginning in the same city as the last one ended. It was flat for the first before a jagged second half. The race entered Tuscany in this stage, visiting the Passo del Rospatoio and the Poggio Civitella before the finish. The finish came on unpaved roads that are used yearly by the Italian semi-classic Montepaschi Strade Bianche.\nThe beginning of the stage was ridden at a very high pace, keeping any breakaway attempts in check. After , Nicki Sørensen and Rick Flens escaped. The flat first half of the stage let them get an advantage of over nine minutes at one point, but the hilly second half combined with the day's heavy rain took its toll on them. At the to go mark, a selection occurred in the pink jersey group, and those left behind were never able to regain the pace. The race's main overall contenders were in the first group, including Alexander Vinokourov, Cadel Evans, Damiano Cunego, Stefano Garzelli, and the duo of Ivan Basso and race leader Vincenzo Nibali. Notably left behind were riders who had previously been considered contenders, like Bradley Wiggins and Carlos Sastre, who finished the day 4'30\" and 5'20\" respectively back of the stage winner.\nThe leaders brought back Sørensen and Flens with remaining in the stage. The first section of unpaved dirt roads (\"strada bianche\" is Italian for \"white roads,\" referring to such areas) took its toll on Nibali, when one of his teammates crashed and subsequently brought him down with him. Nibali needed a bike change, and by the time he got one, Evans, Vinokourov, Cunego, and others had gotten away and were a minute and a half ahead. The move had been instigated by Vinokourov, and he stood to gain the most from it being the highest placed in the overall standings. The rain continued throughout the stage and made the dirt roads muddy. The cold and wet weather combined with the poor road surface caused Vinokourov to question after the stage whether such roads should be used in a stage race at all.\nVinokourov, Cunego, and Evans finished together and contested a sprint for the stage win. Cunego went first, after a hairpin left-hand turn, but Evans had the better timing and crossed the line 2 seconds ahead of his companions. Vinokourov re-assumed the pink jersey.\nStage 8.\n16 May 2010 — Chianciano to Monte Terminillo, \nThis was the Giro's first mountain stage, concluding with a climb to Monte Terminillo. Prior to the Terminillo, the course undulated roughly, visiting two other categorized climbs and other rises in elevation. The Terminillo climb took , gaining of vertical elevation for an average gradient of 7.3%. The steepest stretches of the climb reach 12%.\nThe day began with sprint great Alessandro Petacchi and 2009 youth classification runner-up Francesco Masciarelli both abandoning the race. Petacchi had been suffering from bronchitis and had not been adequately recovering from one day to the next.\nThere were a few breakaway attempts before Monte Nibbio, the first categorized climb of the day, but none got away as the peloton hit the ascent of that climb together. As the summit neared, mountains classification leader Matthew Lloyd attacked and was first to the line to pad his lead in that classification. Several other riders followed him, leading to a split in the peloton. A short while later, with over left to race, 17 riders from 15 teams formed the day's defining breakaway. and handled the pacemaking at the front of the first large group, keeping the breakaway's time advantage to under three minutes. When and joined the chase, the gap fell precipitously.\nAt the front of the race, with to go, Chris Anker Sørensen tried to leave his breakaway companions and solo to victory. He was easily covered by Simone Stortoni, and the two rode the next eight kilometers together ahead of the main field. The pink jersey group had absorbed the other riders from the 17-strong break, and a few riders from the pink jersey group who did not pose overall threats were able to break free and finish ahead of them. Among them was 's Xavier Tondó, who had stayed with his team leader Carlos Sastre on previous days but had been specifically released by Sastre to ride his own race at this point, as Sastre continued to struggle.\nThough Sørensen seemed to be in physical distress for most of the final , he was able to shed Stortoni rather easily with and stayed out front for the stage win. The overall standings were reshuffled somewhat, as David Millar, Linus Gerdemann, and Thomas Rohregger, who had all been in the top ten overnight, were dropped on the climb and lost time. This made for the odd result of Richie Porte and Marco Pinotti also being dropped and losing time, but actually moving up overall, since they did not lose as much time.\nStage 9.\n17 May 2010 — Frosinone to Cava de' Tirreni, \nThis stage was flat, without any climbs giving points for the mountains classification. The Giro reached its southernmost point in this stage, Cava de' Tirreni in Campania.\nAfter had been covered, Giampaolo Cheula, Tom Stamsnijder, and Michael Barry slipped away from the peloton along with breakaway specialist Mikhail Ignatiev. , eager to set up their leader André Greipel for a prospective mass sprint, paced the main field for most of the stage and kept the leaders' maximum advantage at around three minutes for most of the stage. The rain on the day was heavy, leaving standing puddles that sprayed riders in the peloton in the face as their bicycles rode through it. also came forward later in the day, and by to go, a split occurred in the peloton because of the pace Garmin forced in efforts to catch the break. Cadel Evans and Carlos Sastre were both initially left behind – Evans made his way back to the leading group and did not lose any time, but Sastre again lost out and led the second group across the line 1'49\" back of the stage winner.\nGreipel himself was nearly cracked by the pace in the stage's final kilometers. While he did finish with the leading group, he was just 19th on the day, not contesting the sprint. Race leader Alexander Vinokourov was unexpectedly the first rider to try to sprint to the finish line, hoping for one of the time bonuses available to the first three finishers. Second-place man Evans marked this move and the two were briefly away in the stage's final kilometer, but they were overhauled by the sprint trains which came up behind them. 's Matthew Goss was trying to lead Greipel out for the sprint, but when he saw that the German was not at the front of the field with to go, he decided to race for the line himself, and won the stage.\nStage 10.\n18 May 2010 — Avellino to Bitonto, \nThis stage was also categorized flat, though it had a few short hills, including the categorized Valico dell'Imbandima after . It headed east into Apulia in preparation for a northward run to the Dolomites later in the race.\nThis was a largely straightforward day of racing. A three-rider breakaway, comprising Hubert Dupont, Charly Wegelius, and Dario Cataldo, formed early on in the stage. They attained a maximum advantage of seven minutes, as the peloton took a relaxed approach to the first few hours of racing, at last enjoying nice weather. When and came forward to make the chase, the time gap fell precipitously. The roads into Bitonto were very long and straight, meaning the peloton could see the breakaway ahead of them at times when they still had a deficit of over a minute to them. With left to race, Dupont, Wegelius, and Cataldo were brought back. 's top sprinter Greg Henderson crashed and took several kilometers to get back to the leading group, leaving their sprint train disorganized. It fell to and to organize the sprint, and their top sprinters were first on the day, with points classification leader Tyler Farrar from Garmin the victor. After the stage, Farrar praised the leadout he had received from Julian Dean, as it not only gave him the perfect acceleration on the slight uphill finish, it also split the field, as only seven other riders finished with the same time. There was no significant change to the overall standings with the day's results.\nStage 11.\n19 May 2010 — Lucera to L'Aquila, \nThis was the longest stage of the 2010 Giro. It was categorized intermediate, with a hilly profile including three categorized climbs. It was the first north-bound stage of the Giro, going to L'Aquila in the region of Abruzzo, visiting some of the area damaged by the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake.\nA breakaway formed starting at the mark of the stage. Little by little, more and more riders came clear into the leading group. There were more than 50 riders in it at one point; the only team absent from the leading group was , and most teams had three or more riders present. This group took a maximum advantage on the pink jersey of over 20 minutes. The overall favorites left in the pink jersey group either didn't know who was in the leading group or miscalculated how much advantage to give them, because sixth-place man and best young rider Richie Porte was among those in the escape, as were squad leaders Carlos Sastre and Bradley Wiggins, who had fallen out of contention days before but now suddenly stood to be right back in it.\nThe leading group worked cohesively for much of the stage. , , , and rode a hard tempo in the group since they stood to have riders high-placed in the overall standings should they gain significant time on the day. Some riders, in particular teammates of Stefano Garzelli, Michele Scarponi and Cadel Evans, were called back to the pink jersey group to try to help make the pace. and were both decimated by riders abandoning the race at this point, as only five riders remained for both squads at the end of the day. This made it difficult for them to organize the chase effort. For a while, , , , and all mounted a coordinated chase, and the time gap to the leaders fell from 20 minutes to 13 by the summit of the Capo di Valle, the day's last climb. While this was still ample time to allow the stage winner to come from the front group, it figured to be whittled down to 7 or 8 minutes by the finish since the remaining terrain in the stage was mostly flat. However, right at the summit of the climb, stopped sending riders to the front of the pink jersey group, essentially giving up on the chase. This caused the other three teams to abandon the chase as well, and the time gap stayed right at 13 minutes to the end of the stage.\nThe leading group fragmented a little as riders attacked for the stage win. 's Evgeni Petrov secured his first victory in seven years with a well-timed attack in the stage's final kilometer. He came home 5 seconds ahead of Dario Cataldo and Sastre, and 7 seconds over a group of other riders from the break. Forty riders finished scattered ahead of the pink jersey group. Scarponi, Garzelli, Vincenzo Nibali, and Damiano Cunego gained three seconds against overnight race leader Alexander Vinokourov, but they all lost the better part of 13 minutes to the leading group, and all fell from the top ten in the overall standings. Porte became the new race leader, adding the pink jersey to the white he had previously been holding.\n and blamed each other for the pink jersey group's errors on the day. Vinokourov felt that since his team was depleted and that Nibali and Ivan Basso stood a better chance to win the Giro than he did anyway that should have taken up the chase. The Italian team, for their part, felt that since had held the pink jersey at the time that it was on them to organize the chase.\nA 51-rider group, including most of the Giro's remaining sprinters, finished 46'31\" back on the day. This put them at risk of being removed from the race, since they were outside the time limit based on the stage winner's time. Race organizers chose not to eliminate such a large group of riders, but they assessed each of them a 25-point penalty in the points classification. This affected Tyler Farrar, who had a 32-point lead in the classification reduced to just seven, opening up the competition."

La Liga's best coach and player in each position—goalkeeper, defender, midfielder, and forward—were chosen based on a voting by the captain and vice-captains of each club, while the best player overall was determined via statistical analysis.\nSince the La Liga Awards' creation, Barcelona players have won 32 honours in the six main categories, almost triple the number of any other club. Barcelona's forward Lionel Messi has been named La Liga's best player for six times and La Liga's best forward for seven times, both all-time records. Across all positions, the other outstanding individuals are Barcelona midfielder Andrés Iniesta with five wins, Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola with four wins, Real Madrid defender Sergio Ramos with four wins, and goalkeepers Iker Casillas of Real Madrid and Víctor Valdés of Barcelona with two wins each.\nThe majority of the awards were discontinued after the 2015–16 season.\nMain categories.\nWinners.\nWins by individual\nWins by club\nWins by individual\nWins by club\nWins by individual\nWins by club\nWins by individual\nWins by club\nWins by individual\nWins by club\nWins by individual\nWins by club\nOther La Liga honours.\nThe following awards were presented once:\nReferences.\nNotes\nCitations"

        "text": "The knockout stage was the second and final stage of the 2011 Cricket World Cup. It featured the top four teams from each group (8 total) and contested as a single-elimination tournament. This was the first tournament in which a one-over eliminator would be used to decide matches that finished as ties; however, this decider was not required. India and Sri Lanka reached the final, where India chased down Sri Lanka's total of 274 runs for the loss of just four wickets to claim their second Cricket World Cup title.\nMatches.\nQuarter-finals.\nWest Indies vs Pakistan.\nWest Indies won the toss and elected to bat first. They lost early wickets and never recovered, being bowled out for 112. Pakistan won without losing a wicket. This was the West Indies' lowest score in the knockout stages. With this win, Pakistan has reached at least the Semi Final stages in five consecutive ICC tournaments, including one ICC Champions Trophy and three ICC World Twenty20.\nAustralia vs India.\nAustralia's loss to India ended their 12-year reign as ODI world champions. Australia posted 260 for 6 wickets at the end of their innings with Ricky Ponting scoring 104 runs. In response, India chased down the target with 14 balls to spare. India's innings was built on half-centuries by Sachin Tendulkar, Gautam Gambhir and Yuvraj Singh, as well as an unbroken partnership of 74 between Yuvraj and Suresh Raina.\nNew Zealand vs South Africa.\nThis was the sixth time New Zealand had qualified for the semi-final, equalling Australia's and Pakistan's record.\nEngland vs Sri Lanka.\nTillakaratne Dilshan and Upul Tharanga both made centuries as Sri Lanka chased down a target of 230 to win by ten wickets; this run chase set a new record for the highest successful run chase in a ten-wicket victory in ODI history.\nSemi-finals.\nNew Zealand vs Sri Lanka.\nFor a second consecutive time Sri Lanka defeated New Zealand in the semi-finals of the World Cup and made it to the finals. This was the last match Muttiah Muralitharan played on Sri Lankan soil.\nIndia vs Pakistan.\nThe match was attended by the prime ministers of both the countries, Yusuf Raza Gilani of Pakistan and Manmohan Singh of India. Anti-aircraft missiles were deployed at Mohali to prevent any air attacks. The local airport was full of private jets, and an estimated one billion people saw the match on television. Tickets for the match were selling for over ten times their normal selling price on the black market.\nIndia won the toss and elected to bat first. Sachin Tendulkar was dropped four times and survived an early leg before wicket decision before being dismissed for 85. India finished with a total of 260. Pakistan had a steady start, but India kept taking wickets and won by 29 runs.\nAfter the match was over Indian and Pakistani leaders pledged to resolve their differences, including cooperation in the investigation of the 2008 Mumbai attacks. Additionally the skies over Delhi were lit up with large numbers of fireworks.\nFinal.\nThis was Sri Lanka's second consecutive loss in a World Cup Final and was also Muttiah Muralitharan's last ODI match, as well as Sachin Tendulkar's last World Cup match, having been playing World Cups for India since 1992. This match also recorded the highest successful run chase by any team in a World Cup Final and also only the third time that a team batting second had won the World Cup Final. This was also the first time that a host nation in their own country won the World Cup."

        "text": "The 2011 Cricket World Cup Final was the final match of the 2011 Men's Cricket World Cup, the 10th edition of ICC's championship of One Day International (ODI) cricket. The match was played between India and Sri Lanka at the Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai, India on Saturday 2 April 2011. It was the first time that two Asian teams had faced each other in an ODI World Cup final. India won the match by six wicketsits second World Cup win after the 1983 tournamentand became the third team to have won the title more than once, after Australia (1987, 1999, 2003, 2007) and the West Indies (1975 and 1979). \nIndia became the first country to win Cricket World Cup in their own country.\nBoth teams had progressed through three stages to reach the final. India had won all but two matches to that point, losing to South Africa and tying with England in the group stage. Sri Lanka had won all but one completed match, against Pakistan. The Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara chose to bat first after winning the toss. The team scored slowly until the 17th over when they lost both their openers. Sangakkara added 62 runs with Mahela Jayawardene before being dismissed for 48 runs. Although wickets kept falling at one end, Jayawardene scored 103 runs in 88 balls; he was involved in a partnership of 66 runs with Thisara Perera. The pair took Sri Lanka's total to 274 runs at the close of the innings.\nIn reply, India lost their opener Virender Sehwag to the second ball of the innings, out LBW by Lasith Malinga. Sachin Tendulkar, too, got out quickly. The next set of batsmen, Gautam Gambhir and Virat Kohli, added 83 runs in 15 overs before the latter got out in the 22nd over. India captain MS Dhoni, promoting himself up the order, joined Gambhir and they both added 109 runs, an Indian record in a World Cup final. Gambhir got out for 97 runs in the 42nd over. India chased down the total and won the match by six wickets in the 49th over. Dhoni was declared the \"man of the match\" for scoring 91 runs, while his compatriot Yuvraj Singh was awarded the \"man of the tournament\".\nThe match was watched by about 42,000 spectators at the venue and about 135 million viewers on television in India. This was the second time in World Cup history that a host nation won the final and the first time to win on their home ground.\nThe 2011 Cricket World Cup was the tenth World Cup, organized by the International Cricket Council (ICC). The competition took place between 19 February and 2 April 2011. Co-hosted by India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh, the tournament was the third World Cup to be played in the Indian subcontinent. The ICC ruled out Pakistan citing security reasons. There were 14 participating teams, which included four associate members of the ICCKenya, Canada, Ireland and Netherlands.\nThe match was the tenth World Cup final and was hosted at the Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai. It was the first time the city has hosted a World Cup final, and was the second final to be hosted by India, after the 1987 final held at Eden Gardens, Kolkata. The 2011 final was the first to feature two teams from the same continent, and the first time that two co-hosts contested the final.\nIndia were making their 3rd appearance in a World Cup final. Previously, they won the final in 1983, and lost in 2003. Sri Lanka was appearing in their third World Cup final; breakthrough winners against Australia in 1996 they finished as runners up (also to Australia) in the previous World Cup in 2007. Prior to this match, India and Sri Lanka had met each other seven times in World Cup history with Sri Lanka ahead with four wins and two defeats and one game ending in a no-result. In One Day Internationals, India led Sri Lanka with 75 victories against 52 victories for Sri Lanka, while 11 matches had ended with no result.\nThe final generated huge interest. The President of Sri Lanka Mahinda Rajapaksa, a known cricket enthusiast, announced he would attend the match along with his sons. Following this, the Indian President Pratibha Patil also announced her decision to attend the match.\nIt was the second instance of ICC events and was the repeat of 2002 ICC Champions Trophy final where India shared the trophy with Sri Lanka after being washed out by rain.\nRoad to the final.\nSri Lanka qualified for the knockouts with a second-place finish in Group A. They won four of their six games, suffered a defeat against Pakistan and against Australia was washed out. Being level on points with Australia, they were placed second in the group due to their better net run rate.\nIndia were drawn in Group B where they finished second behind South Africa. They managed wins in four of their six games, lost one against South Africa while their game against England was a high scoring tie.\nSri Lanka had clinically demolished England in the quarter final, defeating them by 10 wickets. Both the Sri Lankan openers, Tillakaratne Dilshan and Upul Tharanga made unbeaten centuries and put up a world-record stand for the first wicket in a World Cup. The New Zealand semi-final was more keenly contested, but was still won with relative ease by Sri Lanka. The matches showcased the effective unconventional bowling of pace spearhead Lasith Malinga, restrictive fielding, and the batting prowess of the Sri Lankan top order.\nBoth of India's knockout matches were high-pressure contests. Australia was a strong team and the defending champions, and India had to give a very good performance to restrict Australia to 260 and then successfully chase down the target even as wickets fell regularly. India and their semi-final opponents, Pakistan, have historically been rivals, and there was immense public pressure on both teams with the match attended by the Prime Ministers of both countries. India batted first and ultimately defeated Pakistan by 29 runs.\nTeam composition.\nIndia largely retained the same team it had in the semi-final against Pakistan, with just one change. Ashish Nehra, left-arm medium pacer, had suffered a finger fracture while fielding in that match, and he was replaced by another pacer, Sreesanth. India was widely rated as having the strongest batting line-up in the tournament, and chose to back this strength throughout the campaign by playing seven batsmen and four bowlers. Due to Yuvraj Singh performing well with both bat and ball in the tournament, India could afford to play with only four specialist bowlers. Yuvraj bowled his full quota of 10 overs in many matches, including the semi-final against Pakistan. Among the four bowling slots, Zaheer Khan was the pace spearhead supported in most matches by Munaf Patel, while Harbhajan Singh was the regular off-spinner. The fourth slot was taken by different bowlers in different matches, including Sreesanth, Nehra, leg-spinner Piyush Chawla, or off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin. The captain had chosen Nehra over Ashwin in the match against Pakistan also. Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni had then said he preferred having three seamers because it gave him more options. He already had proven spinners in Harbhajan and Yuvraj, and could call upon many other Indian players who can bowl part-time spin (including Sachin Tendulkar, Suresh Raina, and Virender Sehwag).\nSri Lanka made four changes to their side from the semi-final. All-rounder Angelo Mathews had suffered a torn quadriceps and could not play. Sri Lanka knew the Indians' strength was batting, and thus they needed to take wickets to put them under pressure. This led to their choosing a full complement of bowlers. Spin bowler Ajantha Mendis had performed well throughout the tournament, but he had a poor record against India in pre-World Cup clashes and was not chosen for the final. Spinner Rangana Herath was also dropped. Off-spinner Suraj Randiv and batsman Chamara Kapugedera were flown in from Sri Lanka to strengthen the side. Seamers Nuwan Kulasekara and Thisara Perera, who had played matches in the earlier group stage, were drafted into the team. Legendary spinner Muttiah Muralitharan was carrying minor injuries, but was retained. He had announced that he would retire from One Day International cricket after the World Cup, so this was his last match. The semi-final held at the Premadasa Stadium in Colombo was his last ODI match on home soil, and there he had been carried around the stadium, perched on his teammates' shoulders, on a lap of honour after that match.\nMatch details.\nMatch officials.\nThe on-field umpires were Simon Taufel of Australia and Aleem Dar of Pakistan, with Ian Gould being the third (TV) umpire. All of these umpires are highly rated; Taufel has won 5 ICC Umpire of the Year awards, while Dar has won two. Taufel had never been able to officiate in a World Cup final because Australia had been qualifying for the finals in the last four editions. Jeff Crowe was the match referee and Steve Davis the reserve umpire.\nToss.\nA controversy developed when Kumar Sangakkara called the toss. The toss came up as heads, but the match referee Jeff Crowe did not hear the call over the crowd. It was decided that there would be a re-toss. Sangakkara called heads as the coin was spun the second time. He won the re-toss and decided to bat.\nSri Lankan innings.\nSri Lanka started the innings slowly, constrained by good bowling from Zaheer Khan and committed fielding from Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina, and Virat Kohli inside the 30-yard circle. Zaheer began with three consecutive maidens and the wicket of Upul Tharanga, conceding only six runs in his five-over spell. Sri Lankan opener Tillakaratne Dilshan was bowled by Harbhajan Singh when a delivery carried on to the stumps after deflecting off his gloves. Captain Kumar Sangakkara came in after Tharanga's dismissal, and was building a solid foundation with Dilshan before the latter was dismissed. Mahela Jayawardene came to the crease when Sri Lanka were 60/2 in the 17th over. Sangakkara and Mahela went about the task of consolidating the innings, but eventually Sangakkara was caught behind by Dhoni at 48. New batsman Thilan Samaraweera was adjudged not out by the umpire when a ball hit his thigh pad off the bowling of Yuvraj Singh. The Indians decided to review the decision and he was ultimately given out. Chamara Kapugedera, who was playing his first World Cup match, was caught off a deceptive slower ball by Zaheer Khan. Jayawardene, meanwhile, continued with his quality batting, ultimately scoring 103 not out from 88 balls in a high-class batting display. Helped by the hard-hitting of Nuwan Kulasekara and Thisara Perera, Sri Lanka scored 91 runs in the last 10 overs, including 63 in the batting powerplay (45–50 overs) to take the score to 274/6.\nIndian innings.\nIndia had a wobbly start, with Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar both dismissed early by Lasith Malinga, leaving them struggling at 31 for two. Sehwag was trapped LBW for a duck on the second ball of the innings. Tendulkar started with some good strokes, racing to 18 off 14 balls, but then edged a catch to wicketkeeper Sangakkara. Virat Kohli and Gautam Gambhir started the recovery with some fluent stroke play and quick running between wickets, taking India to 114 before Kohli was caught-and-bowled by Tillakaratne Dilshan for 35. When he was on 30, Gambhir mistimed a shot off the bowling of Suraj Randiv, sending the ball high up in the air, but Nuwan Kulasekara could not hold on to a difficult chance at long off. Kohli and Gambhir put together an 83-run partnership before Kohli's dismissal. Dhoni came in after Kohli to bat at number five, usually the position of Yuvraj Singh. Both Kohli and Dhoni are right-handed batsmen, while Gambhir and Yuvraj are left-handed. Along with other considerations, by coming ahead of Yuvraj, Dhoni ensured there would be a right-left batting combination between him and Gambhir, which makes it difficult for the bowlers to get into a rhythm, and necessitates frequent field changes. Later many legends considered it as one of his many masterstrokes which he has taken in every final of ICC tournament (which he won) to clinch India to a victory. Both Gambhir and Dhoni emphasised on preserving the wickets, and later accelerating with a greater flow of boundaries. Gambhir and Dhoni added 109 for the fourth wicket with Gambhir scoring 97. Gambhir tried to bring up his century with a boundary, but his heaving bat failed to connect with the ball, and he was bowled by Thisara Perera. Following Gambhir's dismissal, 52 runs were required off 52 balls. Yuvraj Singh was the new batsman and along with Dhoni took India to victory, and Dhoni sealed the match hitting a six off Nuwan Kulasekara, when only 4 runs were required off 11 balls. Dhoni finished on 91 not out from 79 deliveries. Like in many other day-night matches in the subcontinent, dew started to form on the outfield grass in the night, making the ball damp and difficult to grip especially in the later part of India's batting. However, this was a known factor and was taken into consideration by the Sri Lankan captain when he chose to bat first after winning the toss. By crossing the target of 274, India had set a record for the highest successful run-chase in a World Cup final.\nAt the end of the match, the batting strength of both the teams stood out. The three top run scorers of this tournament were from these finalists: Tillekaratne Dilshan (500 runs), Sachin Tendulkar (482), and Kumar Sangakkara (465). In the top 10 tournament scorers, there were 3 from Sri Lanka (Upul Tharanga (395) in addition to the previous two), and 4 from India (Gautam Gambhir (393), Virender Sehwag (380), and Yuvraj Singh (362) in addition to Sachin Tendulkar).\n1st innings.\nFall of wickets: 1–17 (Tharanga, 6.1 ov), 2–60 (Dilshan, 16.5 ov), 3–122 (Sangakkara, 27.5 ov), 4–179 (Samaraweera, 38.1 ov), 5–182 (Kapugedera, 39.5 ov), 6–248 (Kulasekara, 47.6 ov)\n2nd innings.\nFall of wickets: 1–0 (Sehwag, 0.2 ov), 2–31 (Tendulkar, 6.1 ov), 3–114 (Kohli, 21.4 ov), 4–223 (Gambhir, 41.2 ov)\nPost-match ceremony and celebrations.\nCelebrations were special as Team India won World Cup in its own country and the stadium was filled with Indians cheering, screaming, waving flags of India. In the post-match presentation, the Sri Lankan captain Kumar Sangakkara said that the Indians batted very well, and \"looks like you need to make something like 350 runs to put them under pressure.\" Then, Indian captain MS Dhoni said that he had added motivation to play well to justify some unexpected decisions he had made for this match, like playing Sreesanth instead of Ashwin, and promoting himself up the order above Yuvraj. MS Dhoni was named Man of the Match for his powerful and match-winning batting display under pressure. Yuvraj Singh was named Man of the Tournament for good all-round performance with both bat and ball throughout the tournament.\nAfter the presentation, an ecstatic Indian team first held the Cup amid showers of champagne and confetti. Some Indian players, including Harbhajan Singh, Sachin Tendulkar, and Yuvraj Singh, had tears in their eyes. The team then carried iconic player Tendulkar on a victory lap around the stadium. Coach Gary Kirsten was also carried around the ground later. The Indian players dedicated their victory to Tendulkar; Virat Kohli said, \"he has carried the burden of the nation for 21 years. It is time we carried him on our shoulders.\" Gautam Gambhir dedicated the victory to the victims of the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, and to the soldiers guarding India's borders. Celebrations went on through the night in the team hotel. The victory prompted several firework displays and celebrations throughout India.\nBroadcast.\nThe final match was broadcast live in India on ESPN Star Sports' website and state-run free-to-air broadcasters Doordarshan and DD1. In Sri Lanka the match was on Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation's Channel Eye.\nThe ratings agencies TAM and aMap respectively recorded that 135 million people in India watched the final live, including 67.6 million Indian cable and satellite viewers. The game was watched by 13.6% of Indian TV-equipped households on average, with a peak of 21.44% at the end of the game.\nAfter match.\nReception in Sri Lanka.\nThough Sri Lankan spectators were initially disappointed, they eventually rallied behind their team and welcomed them at the airport with garlands, cheers, and celebration. Sri Lanka's excellent performance throughout the World Cup was appreciated, and it was recognised that reaching the final was a significant achievement in itself. Opening batsman Tillekaratne Dilshan was the highest run scorer in the tournament, with Sangakkara being the third highest (the second highest was Sachin Tendulkar of India). The Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa hosted High Tea for the Sri Lankan players and spouses on the grounds of the Presidential residence, Temple Trees.\nReception in India.\nIndian fans were ecstatic at the win, and at the overall performance of the team through the tournament. Celebrations went on through most of India over the weekend. The Indian President Pratibha Patil hosted High Tea for the Indian players and spouses on the grounds of the Raj Bhavan (Governor's House) in Mumbai. There was no ticker tape parade for the team on an open bus (as was organised after the 2007 Twenty20 World Cup win) because of the hectic schedule, with the 2011 edition of the Indian Premier League starting on 8 April.\nPrizes for Indian players.\nApart from the World Cup trophy itself, the Indian team was given many prizes from the cricket boards, various state governments, and public and private companies.\nChange in the Sri Lanka team.\nAfter some days of deliberation, Kumar Sangakkara, the Sri Lankan captain, announced on 5 April that he was resigning from the post of captain of the One Day International and Twenty20 sides in the long-term interest of the team. According to him, as he would be 37 by the time of the 2015 World Cup, could not be sure of his place in the side then and it would be better for a new captain to be groomed now, who would be at the peak of his career during that tournament. He stated he was willing to captain the team for the upcoming tours of England and possibly Australia if the selectors felt this would aid the transition to a new captaincy. A day after Sangakkara's announcement, Mahela Jayawardene resigned from the post of vice-captain, and Aravinda de Silva from the post of Chairman of Selectors.\nMatch fixing allegations.\nIn July 2017 the ex Sri Lanka cricket team captain Arjuna Ranatunga made a serious allegation that the cup final match between India and Sri Lanka was fixed. He demanded a probe into the events at the final match. The erstwhile Sri Lankan Sports Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage also supported Ranatunga's match fixing allegations. However, three years later, Sri Lankan Police suspended the match fixing probe citing lack of sufficient evidence. Later International Cricket Council rubbished the match fixing claims made by Ranatunga and Aluthgamage.\nIn popular culture.\nThe match formed the climax of 2016 Indian film \", the biopic of then Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni. The archived footages of the actual match were used and the face of the lead actor was used instead of Dhoni's face. M.S. Dhoni was portrayed by Sushant Singh Rajput.\nIn Sachin Tendulkar's biopic documentary \" the match is also a significant part of the story plot."

        "text": "William James O'Connor (born 15 July 1986) is an Irish professional darts player who competes in events of the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC).\nCareer.\nO'Connor first came to prominence in the 2010 UK Open when he defeated Stuart Monaghan in the First Round by 6 legs to 0. He then defeated Mark Frost and Peter Wright to reach the fourth round, where he played world number 3 James Wade on the main board and lost 9 legs to 3.\nHe qualified for the 2010 World Grand Prix, where he lost to Barrie Bates in the first round by 2 sets to 0.\nO'Connor along with Mick McGowan represented Ireland at the inaugural PDC World Cup of Darts in 2010. The pair defeated Slovakia in the first round 6 legs to 3. However, they were narrowly beaten 6 legs to 5 in the second round to the Australian duo of Simon Whitlock and Paul Nicholson, who were number 4 and 16 in the world rankings respectively.\nHe played in his second World Cup for Ireland in 2012, again paired with McGowan and, as in 2010, they reached the second round this time by defeating Malaysia 5–2. They played the same Australian pair as in 2010 next and were whitewashed 0–4. The next week he reached the quarter-finals of the first UK Open Qualifier, but was defeated by Kevin Painter 4–6. This would later prove to be O'Connor's deepest run in a tournament in 2012. During the year he qualified for three of the five European Tour events. He was knocked out in the first round of the first two, but at the German Darts Masters he saw off Painter 6–5, before losing 3–6 to Wayne Jones. O'Connor was one of the two Irish qualifiers for the World Grand Prix and missed a dart for the match in the first round against Vincent van der Voort, losing 1–2 in sets.\nO'Connor began 2013 ranked world number 54, and played in his third World Cup of Darts and first with Connie Finnan in February. \nThe pair beat Denmark 5–0 in their first match and despite losing to South Africa 4–5 they finished top of Group B on leg difference to reach the last 16. They faced Japan and were defeated 3–5. O'Connor was beaten 9–4 by Dave Chisnall in the third round of the UK Open having earlier seen off Robbie Singleton and Johnny Haines. He struggled for form after this until the first weekend of November when he lost in the last 16 to Mensur Suljović and Gary Anderson in two Players Championships, earning himself £2,000 in the process.\nO'Connor entered 2014 ranked world number 68, just outside the top 64 who had full playing privileges for the year ahead. He entered Q School and had his best result on the third day when he was defeated 5–0 by Pete Dyos in the last 16. The result helped him finish 24th on the Q School Order of Merit to claim the final place on offer for a two-year tour card. He was edged out in the third round of the UK Open 9–8 by Jamie Lewis. O'Connor and Finnan lost five successive legs in the first round of the World Cup of Darts to be beaten 5–3 by Singapore. He was knocked out in the first round of two European Tour events, before picking up his first victory of the season at the European Darts Trophy by averaging 104.36 in a 6–4 win over Mensur Suljović. In the second round, O'Connor was 5–4 ahead of Justin Pipe but bust his score when on 70 and missed one match dart at double six to be beaten 6–5.\nAt the 2015 UK Open, O'Connor overcame Dean Winstanley 5–3, Mark Webster 9–5 and Ian White 9–6 to reach the fifth round of the event for the first time where he played Stephen Bunting. The opening eight legs were shared, before Bunting took four of the next five and he went on to eliminate O'Connor 9–6. He saw off Ian White 6–1 and Vincent van der Voort 6–3 to reach his first quarter-final in three years and first in a European Tour event at the German Darts Masters. O'Connor led world number one Michael van Gerwen 3–1, but went on to lose 6–4 despite taking out three 100 plus finishes.

O'Connor was unable to advance past the first round of the World Grand Prix for the fourth time as he missed two match darts against Jamie Lewis.\nO'Connor was beaten 6–5 by Jeffrey de Graaf in the second round of the UK Open. He ousted Tomas Seyler 6–3 and Kim Huybrechts 6–1 at the German Darts Masters, before losing 6–2 to Gary Anderson in the third round. O'Connor did not get past the last 64 of any individual event in the rest of the year. At the World Cup he and Mick McGowan squeezed past Hong Kong 5–4 in the first round, but they exited the tournament in the next round after they lost their singles matches to the Northern Irish team of Daryl Gurney and Brendan Dolan.\nO'Connor just avoided having to enter Q School in 2017 as he was ranked 64th on the Order of Merit.\nWilliam kicked off 2017 when he defeated Max Hopp, Christian Kist, Keegan Brown, Ritchie Edhouse and Devon Peterson on the way to a quarter final in UK Open Qualifier 1. He eventually lost to Ricky Evans, but coupled with a run to the Last 32 in Qualifier 5, he did enough to make his way into the 2017 UK Open.\nO'Connor entered the UK Open in the second round, where he took on fellow Irishman Steve Lennon. William got the better of Lennon 6–2 to book a spot in the Last 64. Here, he played Mick Todd, who O'Connor beat 10–3 over the longer format. In the Last 32, he played Ronnie Baxter, with William claiming a super 10–6 win to reach his second ever UK Open Last 16. Simon Whitlock was his opponent, and the Aussie proved just too much, defeating O'Connor 10–7, although the Limerick man picked up £6,500 for his run.\nO'Connor continued his form in Barnsley the following weekend, reaching the Last 16 of Players Championship 3, and the Last 32 of Players Championship 4.

        "title": "2010 State of Origin series",
        "text": "The 2010 State of Origin series was the 29th annual best-of-three series of interstate rugby league football matches between the Queensland and New South Wales representative teams played entirely under 'state of origin' selection rules. For the second year in a row, a Queensland victory set a new record for consecutive State of Origin titles, reaching five. Queensland won all three matches, completing their first series white-wash since 1995.\nIn a world first, the Nine Network broadcast free-to-air for the first match in 3D to the Sydney, Newcastle, Wollongong, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide and Melbourne areas. Part-way through the series it became steeped in controversy, firstly for Israel Folau's announcement of his defection to the AFL and subsequent non-selection by Queensland, and secondly by New South Wales' Andrew Johns–Timana Tahu racial slur controversy. Queensland fullback Billy Slater was awarded the Wally Lewis Medal as Player of the Series.\nGame I.\nIn addition to Matt Ballin, who was included as Queensland's hooker due to Cameron Smith's failure to recover from an elbow injury suffered in the 2010 ANZAC Test, Dave Taylor and Cooper Cronk were selected to make their debuts for the Maroons.\nJamal Idris and Brett Morris were New South Wales' only rookies.\nPrior to kick-off Australia's national anthem was performed by Sam Moran on a rainy night at ANZ Stadium. There were plenty of handling errors in the wet conditions and New South Wales were dominating field position early in the match. In the seventh minute their lock forward Anthony Watmough put a bomb up near Queensland's try-line which the Maroons' defence failed to secure. Jarryd Hayne was there to dive on it and the Blues had their first try. Jamie Lyon kicked the extras, so the score was 6–0. After more dropped ball Queensland then had an opportunity in good field position. In the fifteenth minute their halfback Johnathan Thurston took on the New South Wales defensive line before throwing a one-handed pass over the top of the defence to Darius Boyd to score untouched out on the wing. Thurston's conversion was successful, so it was 6–6. The score remained level until the twenty-eighth minute when the Blues were awarded a dubious penalty for a Maroons offside infringement and Lyon kicked it successfully, giving his side an 8–6 lead. About five minutes later, Queensland had made it to within fifteen metres of New South Wales' line when Thurston chipped the ball ahead for his fullback Billy Slater to pick up and dive over the line with. The Maroons halfback kicked the extras, so the score was 8–12 and remained unchanged for the remaining five minutes of the first half.\nQueensland scored first in the second half when, attacking close to the Blues' line, prop David Shillington was able to stand in a tackle and offload to Maroons captain Darren Lockyer, who raced through to get a try. Thurston missed the conversion, so the score remained 8–16 in favour of Queensland. Just before the fifty-minute mark, Lyon chipped the ball over the Maroons' defence for Hayne to race ahead and regather in the open space of Queensland's half. However Hayne instantly threw a speculative no-look pass to his winger which was high and went over the sideline untouched. When the Maroons 123 kg utility forward Dave Taylor took the field in the fifty-fifth minute, he became the heaviest player in State of Origin history. New South Wales then had an attacking opportunity close to Queensland's line and Lyon put a kick up towards the goal-posts which none of the leapers could catch, and Watmough was there to grab it and take it over the line to score. Lyon converted, so the Blues were back within two points at 14–16 with twenty-three minutes of the match remaining. In the sixty-first minute after being tackled on the halfway line, the Maroons worked the ball out to Boyd's wing, where he raced down the sideline before throwing it back in to Greg Inglis to score out wide. Thurston's kick was successful, so Queensland were in front 14–22. In the sixty-seventh minute as New South Wales fullback Kurt Gidley was returning a kick to the ten-metre mark, Thurston, who led the Maroons' chasers, took the ball from his arms one-on-one and gave it to Sam Thaiday, who scored by the posts. The try was awarded and Thurston converted, so the score was 14–28. The Blues scored next when deep inside Queensland's territory they worked the ball out to the right wing where Jamal Idris, making his Origin debut, forced his way over the line. The video referee was called upon to award the try and Lyon's conversion attempt hit one of the uprights, so the score was 18–28 with just over six minutes of play remaining. In the final minute New South Wales got a further consolation try when Gidley chipped the ball ahead and Slater couldn't secure it, giving Ben Creagh the opportunity to dive on it over the line. Lyon kicked the extras, but time ran out before play was restarted, so Queensland won 24–28.\nThe Nine Network's broadcast of Game I broke the television ratings record for a State of Origin match and became Australia's highest-rating television programme of 2010 thus far.\nGame II.\nTickets for Game II sold out within two hours of going on sale. Both sides' preparations for the match were steeped in controversy. Maroons winger Israel Folau's announcement shortly after Game I that he would be playing Australian rules football for the AFL's expansion club in Greater Western Sydney led to agreement from the Queensland Rugby League administration as well as senior players that he should not be selected to play in Game II. Brent Tate looked to be his likely replacement until he broke his jaw, and Queensland quickly changed their mind and named Folau in the squad. This led to outcry from the New South Wales Rugby League, who criticised the QRL for giving the AFL free publicity. The Blues camp was disrupted by Indigenous centre Timana Tahu walking out of the team after racist comments from assistant coach and former teammate Andrew Johns directed at Queensland Aboriginal player Greg Inglis. Johns also stepped down from his role with the team as a result.\nDavid Shillington was chosen to be starting prop for Queensland as Petero Civoniceva was ruled out after suffering from a fractured hand in Game I, freeing his place on the interchange bench for Ben Hannant to make his return to Origin. Vice-captain Cameron Smith also returned from injury, reclaiming the hooker role from stand-in Matt Ballin.\nAn initial squad of 21 chosen was announced for game two for New South Wales due to the complication of judiciary hearings for two players selected in the squad. The 17-man squad was then chosen the day afterwards. Seven new players were selected, with Beau Scott (making his State of Origin debut), Joel Monaghan, Trent Barrett, Mitchell Pearce, Nathan Hindmarsh, Paul Gallen and Luke O'Donnell selected in the starting 17. Manly representatives Jamie Lyon and Anthony Watmough were not selected as both had obtained injury concerns, whilst Luke Lewis received a one-match suspension that ruled him out of final squad selection.\nMonaghan was called in five days into team preparation to replace right wing Timana Tahu, who extraordinarily quit the squad after taking offence to racial comments made by Blues' assistant coach and former teammate Andrew Johns. Johns believed to have referred to Queensland centre Greg Inglis, who along with Tahu having Aboriginal origins, during his comments and afterwards decided to resign from his duty following the scandal.\nPre-match entertainment was provided by Jimmy Barnes, who performed two songs before 12-year-old Straalen McCallum sang the national anthem.\nIt took Queensland till the third minute to score, when, after a penalty helped them down to New South Wales' end of the field, the ball was thrown out to centre Greg Inglis, who scored in the corner. Johnathan Thurston missed the difficult conversion attempt, so the score was 4–0. About six minutes later the Maroons scored again, this time on the other wing when the ball was passed out to right winger Israel Folau to cross in the corner. Thurston's kick was successful, so the score was 10–0 after twelve minutes. Blues forward Paul Gallen was placed on report for a high shot on Nate Myles in the twenty-third minute. In the twenty-sixth minute, a dangerous tackle in which New South Wales forward Luke O'Donnell lifted Queensland winger Darius Boyd resulted in a brawl (in which O'Donnell also head-butted Maroons' forward Dave Taylor) and a penalty to the Queenslanders. About four minutes later the Maroons were attacking close to the Blues' line and crossed again when their captain Darren Lockyer put his fullback Billy Slater through a hole in the defence twelve metres out. However the pass was controversially called forward and the try disallowed. Next came a bit of individual brilliance from Johnathan Thurston when he received the ball on the fifth tackle just inside his own half and chip-kicked it over the head of a defender, running through to regather it after a failed attempt to do so by Kurt Gidley. After the ensuing play-the-ball, it was passed out to Boyd on the left wing, who ran twenty metres to score untouched. The conversion by Thurston was successful, so Queensland led 16–0 with four minutes of the first half remaining, which were played out with no further points.\nAgain in only the third minute of the half the Maroons had made it into New South Wales' half of the field where Lockyer put a high cross-field kick over to the posts for Slater, who wasn't able to catch it, but was able to tap it back, and Willie Tonga was there to ground the ball. The video referee awarded the try and Thurston kicked the extras, so the score was 22–0 after four minutes. The points kept coming for Queensland when a cut-out pass from Lockyer to Folau found the Blues outnumbered on the right wing. Thurston's sideline conversion was successful, so the score was 28–0 after less than ten minutes of the second half. In the fifty-eighth minute Inglis and opposing centre Beau Scott had a punch-up which ended with a penalty to the Maroons. A few minutes later Queensland got another close-range try when utility Cooper Cronk dummied and forced his way over the line. The extras were kicked by Thurston, so it was 34–0 after sixty-five minutes. New South Wales appeared to have scored their first try in the seventy-fourth minute, when Brett Morris dived onto his own chip-kick from close range. However it was disallowed by the video referee because a Blues defender, who was inadvertently offside had impeded the Maroons' defence. In the second last minute though, New South Wales got their sole consolation try when front-rower Brett White was put through a gap ten metres out from the Queensland line. This try saved the Blues from what would have been their biggest loss in the history of State of Origin, but the kick from Michael Ennis was successful, so the score was 34–6 and remained at that when the full-time siren sounded.\nThe win meant Queensland extended their record-breaking four consecutive series victories to five and in the process sentenced New South Wales to their fifth consecutive series defeat.\nGame III.\nSix new Blues players were selected for Game III: Greg Bird, Michael Gordon, Michael Jennings, Jason King, Tim Mannah and Kade Snowden. Gordon, King, Mannah, and Snowden all made their debuts for their state whilst Luke Lewis and Anthony Watmough returned after their absence from game two. Injury forced Matt Cooper out from being selected whilst Luke O'Donnell was not considered due to his suspension sentence obtained from Game II.\nQueensland saw Petero Civoniceva selected after returning from his hand injury, forcing David Shillington back to the bench, and Ben Hannant out of the side.\nThe National Anthem was first performed in Australian Aboriginal language before being performed in English.\nNew South Wales mistakes (including a dropped ball on their second hit-up, a failed attempt to find touch after a penalty and a mid-air tackle on Billy Slater marking a kick) meant they had almost no possession in the opposition half for the first quarter of the match. The weight of possession in attacking field position afforded Queensland the first try, which came in the twentieth minute as they worked the ball out to the left wing from close range for Darius Boyd to dive over. Johnathan Thurston's conversion from the sideline was successful, so the Maroons were leading 6 nil. Seven minutes later Queensland were again raiding the Blues' line when a select pass from Cameron Smith sent Nate Myles through a gap for his first Origin try. The kick from Thurston added the extra two points, so the Maroons had a 12–0 lead with eleven minutes of the half remaining. New South Wales, getting some ball in attacking position later in the half, scored their first try when Paul Gallen crashed over from close-range under the posts in the thirty-seventh minute. Debutant Michael Gordon made no mistake with the simple conversion, so the Blues were back in it at 12–6. In the final minute of the half Darren Lockyer kicked a field goal from 46 metres out, making the half-time score 13–6 in favour of the Queenslanders.\nNew South Wales got the first points of the second half while raiding the Maroons' line and keeping the ball alive with Kurt Gidley crashing through Queensland's scrambling goal-line defence. Gordon's conversion was successful, so the visitors' lead was reduced to one point at 13–12 after forty-eight minutes. Sixteen minutes later the Blues were again attacking the Maroons' line when Anthony Watmough broke into the clear and looked certain to score but Queensland fullback Billy Slater came up with a remarkable try-saving tackle that kept Watmough from grounding the ball. The pressure remained on the Maroons as the New South Welshmen continued their attack and in the sixty-ninth minute Blues dummy half Michael Ennis, two metres from the Queensland uprights, put a deft grubber kick through the defence and Greg Bird raced through to dive on it. This gave New South Wales the lead for the first time since the first half of Game I. Gordon's conversion put the Blues in front by five points at 13–18 with just over ten minutes of the match to go. A couple of minutes later after making a tackle, Ennis punched Nate Myles in the ruck, sparking a brawl and giving the Maroons a penalty in an attacking position. The Queenslanders decided to attack New South Wales' line and before the third tackle of the set Slater had scored after running onto Darren Lockyer's inside pass eight metres out. Thurston's conversion restored the Maroons' one-point lead at 19–18 with four and a half minutes of the match left. As the Blues tried to work the ball out of their own half Queensland winger Israel Folau intercepted a pass, giving his team possession again in good field position. One tackle later the ball was passed out to Willie Tonga, who had the defence outnumbered on the right side and cantered over untouched for the match-sealing try. Folau was given the difficult conversion attempt for Tonga's try and despite striking it well, the ball just missed. So the Maroons had achieved their first State of Origin series whitewash since 1995, winning the match 23-18 and providing the perfect birthday present for Mal Meninga, who turned 50 the following day.\nFollowing the game the man-of-the-match award and Wally Lewis Medal for player of the series, were both given to Billy Slater before the State of Origin Shield was presented to skipper Darren Lockyer.\nTeams.\nThe 18th man is a reserve to cover for any prospective injuries and, unless chosen, does not actually play.\nNew South Wales.\n1 – Timana Tahu was originally selected to play but withdrew due to racist comments by Andrew Johns. He was replaced by Joel Monaghan.\n2 – Hindmarsh switched places with Waterhouse to play in the starting side after being initially selected for the bench.\n3 – Barrett attained captaincy from Gidley in game three.\nQueensland.\n1 – Cameron Smith was originally selected to play but withdrew due to injury. He was replaced by Matt Ballin.\nAftermath.\nFollowing the Blues' fifth (of eight) consecutive series loss, their main sponsor Aussie Home Loans withdrew their support for the team, after just one series. As well as this, a full-scale, on-and-off field investigation was launched into the attitude, behaviour, conduct and operation of the New South Wales team. Ironically, this investigation was carried out by a Queenslander, former Sydney Roosters CEO Brian Canavan.\nDespite his best efforts, New South Wales has continued to underachieve in the State of Origin arena; since the investigation into the state's 2010 series defeat, the Blues have lost nine of thirteen State of Origin series, and fourteen out of eighteen overall since the start of 2006, including losing the deciding game of the 2015 series by a record margin of 52–6."

A localized version by Disney Interactive and Electronic Arts was shown at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in the same year and was eventually released in North America in October, and later in Europe in December, locally distributed by Electronic Arts in the country and published by Disney Interactive. It was later re-released in Europe in 2005 with distribution done through Disney, alongside other games.\nGameplay.\nThe game features nine characters to play as or against on a choice of six different courses. Donald, Goofy, Minnie, and Morty are playable from the start, while Daisy, Pete, Ludwig, Max, and Mortimer must be unlocked. The six fictitious courses include American, Western, Mountain, Tropical, European, and the special Sky Course. Players can also earn tokens while on the links by achieving long putts, perfect swings, and chip-ins, which the tokens can be spent on one of 62 items. The game is unusual for the fact that Mickey Mouse is not playable unlike other Disney games, instead appearing as the golf caddy.\nDevelopment.\nIn March 2002, a Japanese retailer reported that Capcom released pre-ordered information for the Japanese version of the game to ship to markets in Japan on May 30, 2002. Capcom stayed out of the character-based golf realm (presently dominated by Sony's \"Everybody's Golf\" and Camelot's \"Mario Golf\"), but \"Disney Golf\" would naturally have the cachet of its license to carry it.\nFirst shown to the United States with little fanfare at the 2002 Electronic Entertainment Expo by \"Swing Away Golf\" developer T&amp;E Soft, \"Disney Golf\" was aimed at casual sports fans of all ages and was the fifth golf game to be made for the PlayStation 2.\nReception.\nThe game received \"average\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

His success was rewarded by making the Australia national baseball team for the 2006 Intercontinental Cup, he recorded a 1–1 with a 4.50 ERA.\nIn 2007, he was again promoted to the Lancaster JetHawks, but being the youngest on the team at 20 years old, Cox struggled with a 6.18 ERA and mid-season was hit in the head by a line drive and decided to retire from a career in the US.\nClaxton Shield.\nCox returned to baseball in Australia for the 2008 Claxton Shield where he dominated the competition, going 3–0 with a 1.00 ERA and was awarded Claxton Shield Pitcher of the Year. Unfortunately he gave up a one run in the final, a solo shot from Mitch Graham, which would prove costly as Perth Heat's Mark Kelly would go on to throw a shutout.\nHe had an even better 2009 Claxton Shield going 3–0, and not conceding any earned runs, arguably the best pitching record in the history of the Claxton Shield. He led New South Wales to a semi-final victory in game two, pitching a shutout against the Victoria Aces. The only blemish on an almost perfect tournament was his outing in game two of the final against eventual champions, Perth Heat. He allowed 4 runs over 5.1 innings in a 4–5 loss. He won Pitcher of the Year for the second consecutive year.\nHis performances in Australia led him to being selected for Australia in the 2009 World Baseball Classic and 2009 Baseball World Cup.\nIn the 2010 Claxton Shield, he was again the best pitcher for New South Wales recording 3-1 and a 2.38 ERA, but New South Wales struggled and was eliminated in the semi-final against South Australia.\nAustralian Baseball League.\nCox didn't play in the Australian Baseball League until the 2012-13 season, making nine appearances for the Sydney Blue Sox going 1–2 with a 3.74 ERA. After another full season out of the top flight of Australian baseball, Cox played his final game in the ABL on 30 November 2014 finishing his 14-game ABL career 2-2 and a 4.76 ERA."

        "text": "The women's 3000 metres steeplechase at the 2010 European Athletics Championships was held at the Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys on 28 and 30 July.\nMedalists.\nIn the original running of the event, Marta Dominguez of Spain was awarded the silver medal, but she was disqualified and her result nullified. As a result Lyubov Kharlamova was promoted to the silver medal, and Hattie Archer, who at the time ran under her maidan name of Hattie Dean, was awarded the bronze medal, the first major women's medal for a British steeplechaser.\nOn 18 August 2017 Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) announced that Kharlamova had also been disqualified for doping offences following retesting. As a result, she too was disqualified, and her result nullified. As a result, Archer/Dean will be promoted to the silver medal, and Wioletta Frankiewicz of Poland will be promoted to the bronze medal, although reallocations have yet to be confirmed. As such, until reallocation, the silver medal position remains vacant In 2018, the reallocation was confirmed, and Hattie Archer received her medal 8 years later at the Birmingham Grand Prix.\nResults.\nFinal.\nNotes: "

        "text": "The 2011 Australian Open was a tennis tournament held at Melbourne Park in Melbourne, Australia from 17 January to 30 January 2011. It was the 99th edition of the Australian Open and the first Grand Slam event of 2011. The tournament was played on hard courts and was organised by the International Tennis Federation and Tennis Australia. \nThe women's singles competition was won by Kim Clijsters, and the men's singles by Novak Djokovic.\nDay 2 (18 January).\nThe second day saw both Nadal and Murray win when their opponents retired. There was also a win for wildcard Bernard Tomic whilst Baghdatis had to go to five sets before sealing victory, while Del Potro came through his first Grand Slam match since injury in straight sets. Both Tsonga and Verdasco came from two sets down to move into the next round. On the women's side both Molik and Radwańska won marathon final sets to advance into the second round. There was also a win for home hope Sam Stosur and world number two Vera Zvonerva. While the 2008 finalist Ana Ivanovic crashed out 10–8 in the final set.\nIn the evening matches on Rod Laver could not have been more different. The first match was a battle between two former number ones, Kim Clijsters and Dinara Safina. Clijsters did not lose a game in the forty five minutes they spent on court. The men's evening match on Laver was a repeat of the 2002 Wimbledon final between home hope Lleyton Hewitt and Argentine David Nalbandian. The pair traded breaks and shared the first four sets. Nalbandian got an early break in the deciding set. At 5–4 the Argentine served for the match, and Hewitt just as he did in the fourth set broke Nalbandian as he served for the set. At 5–6 Hewitt had two match points which Nalbandian saved, only for the Argentine to force Hewitt to save break points in the next game. At seven all the Argentine broke to love and held on to serve the match out for a 3–6 6–4 3–6 7–6(1) 9–7, win at seven minutes past one in the morning after close to a five hours battle.\nDay 7 (23 January).\nHistory was created in the match between Kuznetsova and Schiavone. The match became the longest match, in terms of time for women in a Grand Slam as it lasted for 4 hours, and 44 minutes. At 8–7 in the final set Kutznetsova had three match points, but the Italian saved all three. In the next game Schiavone broke her opponents serve but touched the net after hitting the winner, meaning the point went to Kutznetsova, when holding three break points. Kutznetsova had another three match points in the next game before a run of four games in a row where the serve was broken. Finally after breaking in the previous game and missing three match points Schiavone closed the match out to win 16–14 in the final set.\nDay 10 (26 January).\nAustralia Day witnessed the last four quarterfinals in the men's and women's singles and the start of the wheelchair tennis competitions. In the first of the men's quarterfinals Murray over came Dolgopolov after a four set battle."

        "text": "The Dartmouth Big Green men's lacrosse team represents Dartmouth College in NCAA Division I men's lacrosse. Dartmouth competes as a member of the Ivy League and plays its home games at Scully-Fahey Field in Hanover, New Hampshire. Dartmouth fielded its first lacrosse team in 1926.\nHistory.\nTom Dent Era.\nHead Coach Tom Dent led the team for its first 35 seasons until his retirement in 1960. Recruited to Dartmouth to coach soccer, he took on the task of coaching the first lacrosse team although he had no experience in the latter sport. Through the 1940s the Indians were considered a lacrosse \"power\" as they rolled up nine New England championships in 11 years. Dent's overall lacrosse record for 35 years is 188 wins, 141 losses, and 4 ties.\nA successful coach in terms of winning, Coach Dent was also concerned with the characters of his charges. The Dartmouth lacrosse team bestows an annual award in Tom Dent's memory, and it is \"To be awarded to the Senior player who by vote of the entire team, has demonstrated the ideals of Tom Dent through his aggressive play, his proven ability as a team player, and his enjoyment of the game, and who by his sportsmanlike conduct is a credit to the memory of Tom Dent and to Dartmouth.\"\n1961–2014.\nThe Big Green secured the Ivy League championship in 1964, 1965, and 2003. This was determined by the Ivy League conference records until the inception of a conference tournament in 2010.\nDartmouth named Rick Sowell as its head coach in 1999, the first African-American Head Coach in Division I lacrosse. He would lead the Big Green for the next 5 seasons, overseeing an incredible turn-around in the program's fortunes.\nIn 2003, the Big Green posted one of the biggest upsets in lacrosse history when unranked Dartmouth played #2 Princeton at Princeton's Class of 1952 Field on April 26. Dartmouth, having finished last in the Ivy League in 2002, played on the road versus the defending champs. Nevertheless, Dartmouth prevailed by stunning the Tigers 13-6. Dartmouth went on to win the Ivy League title and qualify for the NCAA tournament.\nDartmouth made its first appearance in the NCAA tournament in 2003, where it was eliminated in the first round by Syracuse, 13–11. The game was highlighted by the end-to-end game-tying goal scored by the Dartmouth goalie, Andrew Goldstein. Sowell left for St. John's University at the conclusion of the 2003 season.\nBill Wilson replaced Sowell for the 2004 season. \"During his tenure with the Big Green, (Wilson) compiled a 40-44 overall record, while coaching nine first-team all-league players, one Ivy League Rookie of the Year, 18 first-team All-New England players and seven players selected in the Major League Lacrosse Draft. Signature wins for Dartmouth during Wilson's six-year stint include an upset of fourth-ranked Maryland in 2005, a pair of victories of top-10 ranked Notre Dame and a win over 10th-ranked league rival Princeton in 2008.\"\nAndy Towers became the Big Green's ninth Head Coach in 2010. Towers had been an assistant Dartmouth coach for the preceding 5 seasons. In 2013, Dartmouth Men's lacrosse posted another stunning upset against then #9 Princeton, beating them 10-9 at Scully-Fahey field on March 13. As reported in College Crosse:\nEntering that game, the Big Green were just 2-8, suffering through a six-game losing streak (against some admittedly strong competition). Yet, Dartmouth pulled off one of the biggest upsets of the season, dropping Princeton -- ranked ninth in the media poll and eighth in the coaches poll going into the game -- in impressive fashion: Down 7-5 at the half, the Big Green used a three-goal run over the final 6:43 of the third quarter and the first 5:49 of the fourth quarter to draw even with the Tigers at eight; then, after falling behind 8-9 following a Jake Froccaro goal with just over seven minutes remaining in regulation, Dartmouth ripped off two goals in the latter stages of the final period to pull out the improbable victory (what would be its third and final victory of the season).\nThe winning goal was scored by freshman Cam Lee.\nLaxpower ranked the Dartmouth win over Princeton as the fourth-biggest upset of the 2013 season.\nBrendan Callahan era.\nBrendan Callahan became the new head coach at Dartmouth in August 2014, replacing former head coach Andy Towers. The Big Green were 5-8 (1-5 in the Ivy League) in his first season in 2015.\nThe season was highlighted by the double overtime victory over Ivy League rival Harvard, 12-11, on March 21, 2015. Freshman Jack Korzelius scored the winning overtime goal in that game. Captain Philip Hession (First Team All-Ivy, USILA Scholar All-American) had a dominant game at the face-off X winning 20 of 24 draws and scooping 15 groundballs. Laxpower ranked the Dartmouth win over Harvard as the 2nd biggest upset in the 2015 season. Two Big Green players finished in the Division I top 10 statistically for 2015: Adam Fishman, attack, finished third in shooting percentage (.481), and Hession, a midfielder, finished sixth in groundballs per game (7.77) as well as ninth in face-off percentage (0.625).\nIn 2016, 2017, and 2018, the Big Green had a combined 5–35 record, going winless in all 18 Ivy League contests. The hiring of new offensive coordinator Joe Conner in the summer of 2018 represents a new chapter in the Brendan Callahan era.\nDuring the 2023 season the Big Green had their first non-losing season since 2006, finishing the season with 6 wins and 6 losses. On March 25, the Big Green won their first game against an Ivy League opponent since 2015 with a 10-9 overtime win against Harvard. Following the 2023 season Dartmouth parted ways with Brendan Callahan.\nSean Kirwan Era.\nDartmouth hired Virginia's then offensive coordinator Sean Kirwan to become the next head coach of the Big Green in June 2023.\nSeason results.\nThe following is a list of Dartmouth's results by season as an NCAA Division I program:\n†NCAA canceled 2020 collegiate activities due to the COVID-19 virus.\n†† Ivy League cancelled 2021 collegiate season due to the COVID-19 virus."

Its playing surface is Sportexe Synthetic Turf in the infield and Bermuda Grass in the outfield and the dimensions are 320 down the left field line, 380 to center and 325 down the right field line.\nIn 1982, Shipley Field was the site of an exhibition game between the Terps and Earl Weaver's Baltimore Orioles. Eight years later, in 1990, the Soviet baseball team paid a visit to Shipley Field to take on the Terps in an exhibition series. The stadium has been hosting night games since a set of permanent lights were installed prior to the 1994 season. Shipley Field is named after legendary Terps' coach H. Burton Shipley, who was the Maryland skipper from 1924 to 1960.\nOn May 8, 2010, Shipley Field was officially dedicated as Shipley Field at Bob \"Turtle\" Smith Stadium in honor of former Maryland baseball player, Bob \"Turtle\" Smith '63.

The coach is currently Brian Brecht, who is in his eighth year at that position and who joined Rutgers after previously coaching at Siena College. The team plays its home games at SHI Stadium. On July 1, 2014, Rutgers joined the Big Ten Conference in all sports.\nHistory.\nRutgers began playing lacrosse in 1887. The team lasted 3 years, folding in 1889 after it 2–1 season. The program was re-instated in 1920 due in part to the efforts of Harland W. “Tots” Meistrell. In 1926 Fred Fitch took over the program and began a period of national prominence. The team joined the USILA and in 1928 was awarded one of the association's gold medals as an outstanding team, along with three other teams that also shared the championship (Johns Hopkins, Maryland, and Navy). In 1932 the Rutgers team, led by “the best attack pair in the country” George Latimer and Frenchy Julien participated in the U.S. Olympic team tryouts. During Fitch's 22 seasons the team posted a record of 106–71–8. Al Twitchell took over the reins in 1950 with the retirement of Fitch. In 1955 he guided the team to a co-national championship of the USILA's Laurie Cox (Class B) Division.\nRutgers plays Princeton for the Meistrell Cup in honor of Harland (Tots) Meistrell who in addition to re-instating the lacrosse program at Rutgers, he also restarted the dormant lacrosse program at Princeton in 1921. Rutgers also plays Penn State for the Friendship Cup which is a symbol of the friendship of four friends from Sewanhaka High School on Long Island who went off to college splitting two ways; one pair attending Penn State, and the other heading off to Rutgers.\nRutgers appeared in its first NCAA tournament in 1972. In the 1986 tournament, Rutgers defeated C.W. Post, 13–8, in the first round, before falling 5–17 to Syracuse in the quarterfinals.

As of 2024, Cornell leads the series 90–46–4. The game is the oldest ongoing college lacrosse series. The Johns Hopkins–Maryland lacrosse rivalry began in 1895, but the teams only played 7 times before 1924.\nIn 1995, Hobart promoted its team from Division III to Division I to preserve the lacrosse rivalry with Cornell and a similar one with the Syracuse Orange. In 2008, the continuation of the series was put in jeopardy when the Hobart Board of Trustees decided to reclassify its lacrosse program back to the Division III level on April 26. After an emotional reaction from the alumni community, however, the decision was reversed on May 1. The following day, Cornell played the first night game at Hobart's Boswell Field, in which the #8 Big Red beat the Statesmen by a score of 15 to 7.\nLike Cornell, Hobart has never awarded athletic scholarships, and could not after the men's lacrosse program moved to Division I in 1995 due to NCAA policy. Unlike Johns Hopkins, which was grandfathered, Statesmen lacrosse is one of only five Division III programs to compete in Division I without athletic scholarships.\nRival Accomplishments.\nThe following summarizes the accomplishments of the two programs."

        "text": "The Denver Pioneers men's basketball team represents the University of Denver and competes in the NCAA Division I men's college basketball in Denver, Colorado. They are led by head coach Jeff Wulbrun and are members of the Summit League. Since late in the 2019–20 seasons they have played all their home games at Hamilton Gymnasium having formerly played most of their games at the newer but larger Magness Arena.\nThe Pioneers are one of 35 eligible Division I programs to have never appeared in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament.\nHistory.\nDenver began intercollegiate basketball in 1904, playing their first game against the Denver Athletic Club on January 16, who they defeated. They played at the regional level prior to World War II. They played in the Rocky Mountain Faculty Athletic Conference from 1913 to 1938, when they left to become a founding member of the Skyline Conference. Vince Boryla was named a consensus All-American, the first and so far only selection in Denver history. In 1962, they became an NCAA Division I independent.\nIn 1979, DU's declining finances forced the program to drop down to NAIA. They went to the NCAA Division II level in 1990. From 1980 to 1985, Floyd Theard coached the team. He went 107–38 with the Pioneers, which included a home–court winning streak of 79 consecutive games. On April 12, 1985, while serving as the head basketball coach at Denver, Theard suffered a fatal heart attack at age 40. His assistant Dick Peth became the new coach and would coach until 1997, leading them to three NCAA Division II tournament bids. Denver joined Division I in 1998 for all of its programs, including basketball. They accepted membership for the Sun Belt Conference as a measure intended to be temporary that lasted for over a decade. The Pioneers won the regular season title with a 12–3 record in 2005. That year, they made it to the Sun Belt tournament final, which they lost 88–69 to Louisiana–Lafayette, who was later forced to vacate the win due to NCAA violations. As of 2023, it is the closest time the Pioneers have been to winning a conference tournament. Attempts to make the men's basketball team better in order to help the university's revenue stream played a part in the annual budget deficit for the university by 2010. In November 2010, it was announced that Denver would move most of its athletic teams (such as the men's basketball team) to the Western Athletic Conference for the 2012–13 school year. In November 2012, it was announced that Denver would leave the WAC (troubled by upheaval in programs leaving) for The Summit League. In their one season in the WAC, they tied with Louisiana Tech at 16–2 for a share of the WAC regular season title. In the 2023–24 season, the Pioneers finished 7th in the Summit League, but mannaged to upset Kansas City and defeat Omaha to reach the Summit League tournament final, their first tournament final appearance as a program in 19 years.\nAlumni.\nNotable former Denver basketball players include:\nPostseason results.\nNCAA Division II Tournament results.\nThe Pioneers have appeared in three NCAA Division II Tournaments. Their combined record is 1–3.\nNAIA Tournament results.\nThe Pioneers have appeared in two NAIA Tournaments. Their combined record is 0–2.\nNIT results.\nThe Pioneers have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) three times. Their combined record is 1–3. "

        "text": "The Grand Prix de Triathlon (\"Championnat de France des Clubs Division 1 (Triathlon D1)\" or \"Grand Prix F.F.TRI. - Lyonnaise des Eaux\") defines itself as the most outstanding triathlon event in France and attracts numerous international elite triathletes hired by French clubs.\nThe \"Grand Prix\" should not be confused with the \"Coupe de France des Clubs\", which is not a circuit but a one-day national championship and in which the clubs admitted to the Grand Prix are obliged to take part.\nOrganisation.\nIn 2011, the circuit consisted of the following five triathlons: Nice (24 April 2011), Dunkirk (22 May 2011), Paris (9 July 2011), Tours or Tourangeaux (28 August 2011), and La Baule (\"Triathlon Audencia,\" 17 September 2011).\nIn 2012 the following five towns will host the Grand Prix:\nAccording to the official \"Réglementation Sportive,\" there should be 16 male and 14 female teams. At the end of the year 2010, however, three female teams (Beauvais, Montpellier, Nantes) and two male teams (Beauvais, Montluçon) withdrew.\n\"Beauvais Triathlon\" decided to boycott the \"Grand Prix\" when the French Triathlon Federation (FFTRI) canceled the traditional \"Triathlon de Beauvais\" and replaced it with the \"Triathlon de Nice.\" As it seems, there were tensions between FFTRI president Philippe Lescure and Beauvais manager Laurent Chopin, who is reported to return to soccer. Besides, French clubs obviously face increasing difficulties hiring foreign elite stars. Two of the \"Beauvais\" elite stars, Andrea Hewitt and Delphine Py-Bilot, moved to \"Poissy\" and \"Charleville\" respectively. Fred Belaubre and Charlotte Morel, however, took a break.\nQualified Teams 2012.\nAccording to the current \"Réglementation Sportive,\" there should be again 16 male and 14 female teams. Compared to 2011, the situation has improved and there are now 13 female teams. However, it remains to be seen if the newcomers can catch up to the old elite clubs.\nLaurent Vidal changed to \"Beauvais Triathlon\" and therefore does not take part in the Grand Prix 2012. Frédéric Belaubre, however, left \"Beauvais Triathlon\" in order to take part again in the Grand Prix, this time for \"Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines.\"\n16 male teams:\n13 female teams:\nPoints System.\nEach of the 16 male and 14 female teams nominates seven triathletes for the whole season, of whom five triathletes actually have to take part in the race.\nIn 2011 at least one triathlete in each team must be French (two from 2012 onwards).\nFor each of the five competitions the ranking of the clubs is determined by the three so-called \"triathlètes classants l'equipe\", i.e. the individual positions of the three best triathletes of each club are added and the club with the lowest sum is the winner, and so forth.\nThe ranks of the rest of each team are irrelevant. For the whole circuit, however, the clubs are assigned points on the basis of the club ranking of each individual competition. The best male team, for instance, receives 20 points for the first place in one competition etc.\nFor the season 2011 the French triathlon Federation FFTRI was not only unable to secure the right number of clubs, some clubs, especially female elite teams, seem to have difficulties in hiring five elite triathletes for each race:\nIn general, it seems that the official Rules \"(Règlementation sportive)\" are not strictly applied. E.g. at the official podium ceremony in La Baule (17 September 2011), \"Saint Raphaël Tri\" (Anna Tabarant, Polyanskaya, Ivanovskaya, Camille Donat and Daniela Chmet) did not turn up. According to the rules, this should have led to a penalty. Nevertheless, the club received all 11 points for the third place in La Baule.\nForeigners' Dominance.\nThe high amount of international guest stars has always raised criticism in France. On the one hand, FFTRI is proud to gather some of the best elite stars of the world, on the other hand the rankings clearly show that the French triathletes are a small and irrelevant minority among the \"Grand Prix\" participants.\nIn the old \"Réglementation Sportive\" of the season 2007/08, the importance of the foreign guest stars was still restricted because among the three only one (EU) foreigner was allowed.\nSeason 2010.\nThe rankings of the opening \"Grand Prix\" triathlon held at Dunkirk on 23 May 2010 give the following picture.\nSeason 2011.\nTo some extent this season was irregular. On the one hand, traditional guest stars withdrew and concentrated on ITU races for the 2012 Olympics qualification. On the other hand, five clubs which had already been admitted to the \"Grand Prix\", among which the female gold medalist and male silver medalist \"Beauvais,\" declared to withdraw in autumn 2010.\nSo in 2011 there were only 11 instead of 14 female teams.\nThe opening triathlon in Nice (24 April 2011) proved the undiminished foreigners' dominance in spite of the new regulation according to which each club has to be present with five triathletes at each competition with at least one French triathlete among them."

        "title": "Mount Washington Lacrosse Club",
        "text": "The Mount Washington Lacrosse Club is an amateur field lacrosse club based in Baltimore, Maryland. As one of the most successful and well-known lacrosse clubs in history, at one point it dominated the sport at both the collegiate and club level. The team is sometimes referred to by the nickname of the \"Wolfpack\" or \"Mounties\". In 1960, \"Sports Illustrated\" called Mount Washington \"one of the most successful athletic dynasties in history\". The home field is Norris Field, located on Kelly Avenue in Mount Washington, Baltimore. It has been shared with the all-girls Bryn Mawr School since 1999.\nHistory.\nThe Mount Washington Club was founded in 1904, named for the affluent suburb of Baltimore City in which it is located. Johns Hopkins coach Bill Schmeisser was instrumental in the establishment of the club. In 1906, the club abandoned other sports in order to concentrate on lacrosse. The club supported itself through home game gate receipts, which in 1969 was about $2.50 per ticket for the popular game against Johns Hopkins. Mount Washington's style of play focused on finesse and a slow-down tempo in order to counter the youth and athleticism of opposing collegiate teams.\nRecord keeping was somewhat lackadaisical in the club's early days but, according to \"Sports Illustrated\", the team's record from 1925 to 1969 stood at 358–31–3. From 1959 to 1969, Mount Washington compiled a 94–8 record against top college and club competition.\nMount Washington has played as a member of the United States Club Lacrosse Association (USCLA, merged into American Lacrosse League in 2007) since its establishment in 1960, and has won 13 USCLA championships. In 1967, Mount Washington represented the United States in the inaugural World Lacrosse Championship, which it won by defeating the teams from Australia, England, and Canada. During the 1960s, college lacrosse was dominated by the Naval Academy, which won eight consecutive USILA championships during the decade. From 1960 to 1966, Mount Washington accounted for three of Navy's six losses.\nIn 1962, Mount Washington played a televised box lacrosse competition against a Washington, D.C. club. In sudden death overtime, the referee inadvertently resumed the game during a television timeout. Mount Washington scored to win the game, but a television official demanded a restart for the cameras, arguing that the box lacrosse league had been established in order to be televised. Despite the club's protests, the officiating staff complied, and Mount Washington scored to win the game a second time.\nIn the early 1970s, Mount Washington was displaced as perennial club champions by the Long Island Athletic Club (now the Hofstra Lacrosse Club), but returned to win three consecutive USCLA titles from 1975 to 1977.\nIn 1999, due to financial difficulties, the club sold Norris Field to the Bryn Mawr School girls preparatory school for $250,000. Mount Washington and Bryn Mawr agreed to a 20-year contract to share the facilities, with the club having access at night for practice and on weekends for games. In 2017, Bryn Mawr sold Norris Field to Coppermine Recreational Facilities.\nPlayers.\nThe Mount Washington Club has been amateur throughout its history, with practices and games coming in the spare time of its players. Many of them have been professional businessmen, bankers, lawyers, and stockbrokers. These have included numerous college All-Americans, Lacrosse Hall of Fame inductees, and head coaches.\nSome of the more accomplished Mount Washington members have been:"

Derbyshire's matches were not considered to be first class in this season. The club had lost first class status after 1887 and did not regain it until 1894, the year before they joined the County Championship. However many of the players competed for the club earlier or subsequently at first-class level.\n1889 season.\nDerbyshire played eleven games, all against sides that they had played in first class matches before 1888 or that joined the County Championship four years later. William Chatterton was in his third year as captain and was also top scorer making a century against Essex. George Davidson topped the bowling with 38 wickets.\nFred Spofforth, known as the \"Demon Bowler\" had toured England with the Australians in 1886, and afterwards chose to live in Derbyshire. The club tried to persuade the County Cricket Council to let him play for Derbyshire without waiting for the usual two years' residential qualification. Although the application was refused, in 1889 Yorkshire generously offered to waive the point so that Spofforth could play against them. He did so in two matches in the 1889 season, repaying them in one game by taking fifteen of their wickets for 81 runs. In the 1890 season, with the residential qualification met, Spofforth was able not only to play for Derbyshire but to captain the side. Charles Evans who made his debut played on for Derbyshire into the County Championship in 1895. Frank Evershed one of the Evershed brothers and a rugby international played in his first season for Derbyshire, but never played a first class game. Joseph Burrows, George Maltby and Thomas Purdy all played in one career match for Derbyshire against the MCC and only Purdy returned the following year."

Smith has been captain of the Great Britain Davis Cup team since 2010, and led the Great Britain team to win the 2015 Davis Cup.\nEarly years.\nSmith was born in Glasgow, Scotland and attended Hutchesons' Grammar School. He played junior tennis at national level but did not become a professional player.\nCareer.\nSmith began coaching professionally at club level aged 18. He has focused on elite players since 1998, and became national performance officer for Tennis Scotland that year. Two years later he helped set up a tennis academy at the Next Generation club in Edinburgh. He rejoined Tennis Scotland as LTA academy coach, and became national training coach for Scotland in 2004.\nSmith has coached several Scottish junior players, most notably Andy Murray. Smith worked with Murray from age 11 to 15, during which time Murray won the Junior Orange Bowl under-12 title and five ITF Futures events. Smith and Murray remained friends, and Smith assisted Murray at the French Open in 2006 during a period when Murray had no full-time coach.\nSmith became the LTA's national under-16s men's coach in 2005 and the under-18s coach in 2008, and was later appointed Head of Player Development in Men's Tennis. He was appointed Head of Men's Tennis simultaneously to his appointment as Davis Cup captain, a position he held until 2014. He also served as Head of Women's Tennis between 2011 and 2013.\nDavis Cup captaincy.\nSmith's appointment as Davis Cup captain was announced by the LTA on 12 April 2010. His appointment at age 34 made him the youngest Great Britain captain since Paul Hutchins (appointed in 1975 aged 30), and one of the few to be appointed without having been a top-level player. His first tie as captain was a Europe/Africa Zone Group II match against Turkey, held at Eastbourne from 9 July 2010, which Great Britain won 5–0, thereby avoiding relegation. In 2011 the Great Britain team won promotion to Europe/Africa Zone Group I, and in 2013 won promotion to the World Group.\nIn 2014 Great Britain reached the quarter-finals, eventually losing 3–2 to Italy. In 2015, under Smith's captaincy, Great Britain won the Davis Cup for the first time since 1936, beating Belgium 3–1 in the final.\nSmith was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2016 Birthday Honours for services to tennis.\nPersonal life.\nSmith is married and has three children."

        "text": "Noel Fernando Salas (born May 30, 1985) is a Mexican professional baseball pitcher for the Olmecas de Tabasco of the Mexican League. He previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the St. Louis Cardinals, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, New York Mets, Arizona Diamondbacks and Philadelphia Phillies. He made his MLB debut with the Cardinals in 2010.\nEarly life.\nFernando Salas was born and raised in Huatabampo, Mexico. Growing up he never thought about playing in the American Major Leagues, instead being a fan of Mexican League baseball. Said Salas: \"There is a lot of money to stay in Mexican League. A lot of players in Mexican League have a chance, (at American baseball) but they want a lot of money.\" Although he watched little if any American baseball—the only game he can remember watching is the 1993 World Series between the Toronto Blue Jays and Philadelphia Phillies—he had a dream of proving he was good enough to play in the major leagues.\nProfessional career.\nSaltillo Saraperos.\nSalas first pitched professionally at age 20 when he was signed by the Saltillo Saraperos of the Mexican League. There his pitching coach was Sid Monge a veteran of ten years in American Major League baseball as a player and a coach in the St. Louis Cardinals minor league system. According to Salas, Monge was the reason he is now playing in the major leagues: \"He pushed me. He said 'You can go to America'. He believed in me.\" Representatives from other major league teams took interest in Salas as well, with scouts from the Chicago Cubs, Kansas City Royals, Detroit Tigers and the Cardinals watching Salas pitch in the 2006 Mexican League playoffs.\nSt. Louis Cardinals.\nThe Cardinals were impressed enough to buy Salas' contract from Saltillo in February 2007. He reported for spring training in Jupiter, Florida, remaining there for the entire season with the Cardinals High-A ball affiliate Palm Beach Cardinals. He advanced through the minor league system, playing for the Double-A Springfield Cardinals in 2008 and Triple-A Memphis Redbirds for the 2009 season. Salas began 2010 in Memphis but was called up to the majors for the first time on May 27, 2010. He made his major league debut the next day, pitching one scoreless inning.\nIn 2011, he replaced Ryan Franklin as the Cardinals' closer, earning 24 saves in 68 appearances with a 2.28 ERA. Salas began the 2012 season with St. Louis, but after going 0–3 with a 6.32 ERA in 18 games, he was optioned to Triple-A Memphis. It was later learned that Salas had been hampered by a kidney stone, and once that medical situation passed he returned to St. Louis later in the season. He finished the 2012 season with a record of 1–4, 60 strikeouts, and a 4.30 ERA.\nLos Angeles Angels of Anaheim / Los Angeles Angels.\nOn November 22, 2013, he was traded along with David Freese to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim for Peter Bourjos and Randal Grichuk.\nNew York Mets.\nOn August 31, the Angels traded Salas to the New York Mets for minor league pitcher Erik Manoah. He debuted for the club on September 1, pitching a scoreless inning against the Miami Marlins at Citi Field. On February 15, 2017, Salas signed a one-year contract with the Mets. On his thirty-second birthday, Salas recorded his first Major League hit off of Carlos Torres of the Milwaukee Brewers at Citi Field. He was designated for assignment on August 11, 2017. \nHe was released by the Mets on August 16, 2017.\nSecond stint with the Los Angeles Angels.\nOn August 19, 2017, Salas signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Angels.\nArizona Diamondbacks.\nOn January 22, 2018, Salas signed a minor league deal with the Arizona Diamondbacks. In 44 games for Arizona, he was 4–4 with a 4.50 ERA in 40 innings. On July 6, 2018, Salas was designated for assignment. He was released on July 9, 2018.\nAtlanta Braves.\nOn July 16, 2018, Salas signed a minor league deal with the Atlanta Braves. He was released on August 11, 2018.\nAcereros de Monclova.\nOn March 6, 2019, Salas signed with the Acereros de Monclova of the Mexican League.\nPhiladelphia Phillies.\nOn June 7, 2019, Salas signed a minor league deal with the Philadelphia Phillies and was assigned to the Lehigh Valley IronPigs. On June 24, his contract was selected by the Phillies. He was designated for assignment on June 28 after appearing in just one game. Salas has his contract selected by the Phillies on July 18, 2019. He was once again designated for assignment on July 21, after the signing of Drew Smyly, and outrighted on July 23. In 2019 with the Class AAA Lehigh Valley IronPigs he was 1–1 with a 4.63 ERA in 18 relief appearances (23.1 innings), and with the Phillies he pitched 2.2 innings in which he gave up two runs. He elected free agency on October 1. After the 2019 season, he played for Naranjeros de Hermosillo of the Mexican Pacific League(LVMP).\nAcereros de Monclova (second stint).\nOn February 28, 2020, Salas signed with the Acereros de Monclova of the Mexican League. In 2020, he did not play a game because of the cancellation of the Mexican League season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAfter the 2020 season, he played for Naranjeros of the LVMP. He has also played for Mexico in the 2021 Caribbean Series.\nOlmecas de Tabasco.\nOn March 30, 2021, Salas was traded to the Olmecas de Tabasco of the Mexican League.\nPersonal life.\nSalas and his girlfriend, Daniela, are parents of a son, Fernando, born during 2012 spring training. He is being raised in Mexico. It is not a situation to Salas' liking: \"Other Latin players have a lot of family in America. For me, it didn't happen. It's a little difficult because my family doesn't know any English. But they know it's work. They know it's a profession.\" and \"I love the opportunity. I want to do everything I can to stay here.\""

        "text": "Mike Kelly (born January 26, 1948) is a former American football coach. He was the head football coach at the University of Dayton from 1981 to 2007. In 27 years as the head coach at Dayton, he compiled a record of 246–54–1. He led the Dayton Flyers to the NCAA Division III Football Championship in 1989 and appearances in the title game three other times, in 1981, 1987, and 1991. Kelly ranks among the top 25 college football coaches of all time in winning percentage (.819). Among coaches with at least 25 years of experience, he has the fifth best winning percentage of all time.\nBiography.\nKelly is a graduate of Milton-Union High School in West Milton, Ohio, and Manchester University in North Manchester, Indiana. He played both quarterback for the football team and catcher for the baseball team at Manchester University. He received a bachelor's degree in physical education and health from Manchester University.\nKelly began his coaching career as a high school football coach. He coached at the high school level from 1970 to 1974 while earning a master's degree in physical education from Ball State University. From 1975 to 1976, he was an assistant coach at Hanover College in Hanover, Indiana. He joined the coaching staff at the University of Dayton in 1977 as the defensive coordinator under head coach Rick Carter.\nAfter four years as the defensive coordinator, Kelly took over as head coach of the Dayton Flyers football team in 1981. He later recalled the day he learned that he had been selected: \"The day I was informed that I would be the head football coach, I remember walking out of St. Mary's Hall and looking up at the chapel, and it was overwhelming to think that, golly, I'm the new head football coach at the University of Dayton.\"\nKelly remained Dayton's head football coach for 27 years and compiled a record of 246–54–1. Kelly is among the top 25 college football coaches of all time in terms of both winning percentage and wins. As of 2008, he ranked 21st among all college football coaches in all divisions with an .819 winning percentage over 27 seasons. Among coaches with at least 25 years of experience, Kelly's winning percentage of .819 ranks fourth best all time, trailing only Florida A&amp;M's Jake Gaither (.844), Nebraska's Tom Osborne (.836) and Michigan's Fielding H. Yost (.828).\nIn total wins, Kelly ranks 20th all time with 246. He was the second fastest coach in NCAA history to reach 200 wins. Kelly accomplished the feat in 242 games—second only to Jake Gaither who reached the 200-win level in 240 games.\nHe led Dayton to three national championships—the NCAA Division III national championship in 1989 and NCAA Mid-Major national championships in 2002 and 2007. In 2007, Kelly's last as head coach, his team compiled an 11-1 record, won the Gridiron Classic and was crowned NCAA FCS Mid-Major national champions. He coached 44 Academic All-Americans and 84 first team All-Americans in his 27 years as Dayton's head coach.\nKelly was frequently considered for coaching positions at larger schools, including Yale, Dartmouth, Columbia, and Penn, but opted to stay at Dayton. In 1996, he described his motivation for staying at Dayton, \"There is a very basic reason why I haven't put a great deal of effort in other jobs. I just love it here. I think we're accepted and respected in the community. Those things are all very valuable in your life. You want to feel wanted - that's pretty basic, I think - and we've always felt that.\" He also noted that he enjoyed working with non-scholarship athletes who were playing for the love of the game: \"It's a blast. It's a lot of fun to deal with those kind of people. They want to have fun, and they're gonna work hard, but every one of them is out there because they want to be. I look forward to going to practice. They're wide-eyed. (They're saying) 'Teach me something coach.'\"\nKelly was selected six times as the Coach of the Year in the Pioneer Football League and was honored seven times as the national Coach of the Year. Dayton played in NCAA Division III for Kelly's first 12 seasons as head coach and went to the Division III playoffs eight times. For his last 15 seasons, Dayton played in the NCAA Division I-AA non-scholarship division.\nKelly was inducted into the University of Dayton Athletic Hall of Fame in February 2008.\nOn July 16, 2011, Coach Kelly was inducted into the National Football Foundation’s College Football Hall of Fame. The ceremony was co-hosted by one of Coach Kelly's former players and former Super Bowl Champion head coach, Jon Gruden.\nHe is married to Jeanne Kelly, and they have two daughters, Jodie Beth and Nikki."

        "text": "The 95th Indianapolis 500 was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana on Sunday May 29, 2011. The race was part of the 2011 IZOD IndyCar Series season. The track opened for practice on May 14 and time trials were held from May 21 to 22. Alex Tagliani won the pole position, and the race was won by Dan Wheldon. It was his second Indy 500 win after the 2005 race, and the last win of his racing career. It was the first of two Indy victories for car owner Bryan Herta.\nDiffering strategies from the frontrunners led to one of the wildest finishes in race history. American rookie J. R. Hildebrand of Panther Racing took the lead with two laps to go. As the leaders were cycling through pit stops, Hildebrand was nursing a car very low on fuel. He was attempting to stretch his tank to the finish line and hold on for an unexpected victory. It would have been the first Indy 500 win for Panther Racing, after three consecutive runner-up finishes, and two series championships. On the final turn of the final lap, Hildebrand went high to pass the slow car of Charlie Kimball. He drifted wide and crashed into the outside wall. As his wrecked car coasted down the front straight, Wheldon slipped by in the final 1,000 feet to take the victory. Hildebrand slid across the finish line to finish second. It was the second Indianapolis 500 to date that ended in a last lap pass after the 2006 race, and the only time to date that the race winner led only the final lap.\nFour months later, Wheldon was killed in a crash in the IZOD IndyCar World Championship at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, driving the car Tagliani had qualified on the pole in.\nThe race was the culmination of the three-year-long Centennial era, celebrating the 100th anniversary of the opening of the track (1909) and the 100th anniversary of the inaugural race in 1911. Throughout May, the race was advertised as the 100th Anniversary Indianapolis 500 and the Centennial Indianapolis 500. Since the race was suspended during World War I and World War II, the 100th running of the 500 would not be held until 2016.\nEntry list.\n\"See Team and driver chart for more information\"\nOn April 15, 2011, the Official Entry List was released, featuring 83 cars for 42 entries. As of April 15, thirty-five car/driver combinations had been announced. On May 9, a revised version of the entry list was released. The entry from China Racing was withdrawn. The final list includes 79 cars for 41 entries.\nConfirmed former winners entered include Dario Franchitti, Hélio Castroneves, Scott Dixon, Dan Wheldon, and Buddy Rice.\nRookie orientation.\nPre-Indy oval testing.\nSince the Indy 500 was the first oval race of the 2011 season, per IndyCar regulations, rookies who have not competed on an oval were required to take part in Pre-Indy Oval testing. Scott Speed and Ho-Pin Tung, along with Wade Cunningham (who didn't race Indy but participated at Texas) completed the test at Chicagoland Speedway on May 9. Speed was legally exempt from this test because of previous high-speed oval experience in ARCA and NASCAR, but chose to test with his teammate to learn the car.\nPractice.\nFriday, May 20 – Fast Friday.\nLate in the day, reports surfaced that Scott Speed had quit Dragon Racing, after having trouble getting up to speed. The rumor was denied.\nStarting grid.\nPost-qualifying changes\nFailed to qualify\nRace.\nSummary.\nFirst half.\nThe 95th running of the Indianapolis 500 began at 12:00 PM EDT on a hot, muggy day, shortly after the traditional pre-race ceremonies of the invocation, national anthem, and the singing \"Back Home Again in Indiana\" by Jim Nabors. Mari Hulman George gave the starting command around 12:05 PM, as the cars took two parade laps and one pace lap, led by four-time Indianapolis 500 winner A. J. Foyt, who was driving the pace car. The green flag came out to see Scott Dixon pass by pole-sitter Alex Tagliani to take the early lead in the race. The first 20 laps of the race saw a relatively smooth pace set in. Unlike past years there was no accident in the first two laps, with the first caution coming out on Lap 21 when Takuma Sato made contact with the wall. During the first caution period many team made pit-stops including Will Power who left the pit area and drove a lap without a left-rear tire, which all but eliminated the IndyCar points leader from having an opportunity to win the race.\nShortly following the green flag restart (which was changed to a two-car abreast start during the drivers meetings) Sato's teammate, E. J. Viso was turned heading into turn 1 by James Hinchcliffe and was the next driver to make contact with the wall and eliminate himself from the race. Following the cleanup and restart after Viso's crash saw the field taking shape and aligning themselves for the long 400+ miles remaining. Simona de Silvestro, who was burned in a crash earlier in the month, was not able to pick up speed in her back-up car and quickly fell from 23rd position, to last. On lap 44, it was clear that the car would not be able to keep up with the field, she was called into the pits and her day was over.\nDefending winner Dario Franchitti, along with Scott Dixon, Alex Tagliani, and Oriol Servià all began to take their places at the top of the field with each of them leading more than 10 laps in the race respectively. Later accidents occurred with rookies Jay Howard and James Hinchcliffe. Howard lost a right-rear wheel on lap 61, while Hinchcliffe slid high in turn 3 and bounced off the wall at the halfway mark.\nSecond half.\nFollowing James Hinchcliffe's crash on lap 101, the green flag remained out for over 40 laps as many different drivers shared the lead and got in position for the shootout in the final 10. On lap 148, it was the pole-sitter Alex Tagliani who would be called into pit lane after making slight contact with the wall. Tagliani, who had not had a good day, started in first, fell all the way down to 12th before the crash, was finished for the day, with his final finish position being 28th. One of the few multi-car crashes of the day occurred on lap 158 between Ryan Briscoe and Townsend Bell. Up to that point in the day, Team Penske had been running slow and really did not have a good shot at any of their drivers winning the race, and with the crash and elimination of Ryan Briscoe all hope seemed gone as Hélio Castroneves and Will Power were both down due to bad pit stops and slow cars. With no more lengthy cautions the remainder of the race it turned into a fight for the lead as the laps dwindled down.\nAs the race prepared to go back to green on lap 164, a handful of drivers ducked into the pit area to top off their fuel, in hopes of going the distance without another pit stop. Dario Franchitti and J. R. Hildebrand were among those who gave up their track position, and topped off their fuel.\nFor the first time in his Indy career, Graham Rahal took the lead of the race and held it for six laps. However, he lost a battle to Scott Dixon and was forced to a pit stop which dropped out of the top five. However, he was able to finish the race in third place. Tony Kanaan also saw his flirt with Indy glory as he made his way all from the middle of the pack to second place at one point, but was forced as well to drop on a pit stop with less than 20 laps to go. As the race came to down to its final 15 laps, it was still Scott Dixon and Dario Franchitti, two Chip Ganassi Racing cars and former winners, who looked like they would win the race. However, late in the race after a series of pit stops by most in the lead, it was an unlikely Bertrand Baguette who would lead the race as the action came to it climax. Baguette was expected to pit again but as the laps dwindled down and he did not come in, it became increasingly likely that this new face would win the race.\nThe final 10 laps became a battle between Baguette, Franchitti, and rookie J. R. Hildebrand (all of whom were all trying to stretch their fuel to the finish), as well as Dixon and Dan Wheldon behind but good to the finish having recently pitted. With three laps to go, Baguette pitted for fuel and Franchitti continued to slow to conserve fuel. This gave the lead to Hildebrand while Franchitti continued to fade, falling behind Dixon and the charging Wheldon. As the field was given the white flag, it seemed all but certain a rookie would win the 500 for the first time since Castroneves won it in 2001. Hildebrand moved his way down into the north short chute and down into turn four. Coming in on the front stretch, Hildebrand went high to avoid the slower car of Charlie Kimball, who was on the inside line, and collided with the wall. Without steering and on only three wheels, the car slid down the frontstretch towards the finish line. Dan Wheldon, who was second, skirted by in the final 1,000 feet, and crossed the line to win the race. Hildebrand continued to slide, and crossed the finish line in second.\nPost-race.\nDan Wheldon became the 18th person to win two or more Indianapolis 500's, his first coming in 2005. The 200th lap was the only one he led in the race, breaking Joe Dawson's 99-year-old record for the fewest laps led by an Indy winner. As he took to victory lane, he celebrated with the traditional ceremonies of the wreath, glass of milk, and the presentation of the Borg Warner Trophy. As the celebration was occurring, his former team Panther Racing considered filing for a review, stating that Wheldon made an illegal pass during the yellow on Hildebrand's car. In the end, video showed that the yellow did not come out until after Wheldon had passed, and even if it would have come out before the pass, the president of competition ruled that Hildebrand's car was a \"wounded car\", and was therefore allowed to be passed in the race.\nWheldon's average speed of was the fourth-fastest Indy 500 in history, and was the first Indy 500 completed in less than three hours since Juan Pablo Montoya won in 2000.\nBox score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nAll entrants utilized Firestone tires.\nNote: Unofficially Oriol Servià finished 5th, 8.8757 seconds behind the leader, with Scott Dixon placing 6th. When the official results were posted, it was determined that Servia passed Dixon on the final lap while the yellow caution light was illuminated. Officials re-instated Dixon to 5th, and dropped Servia to 6th in the final standings.\nAwards.\nRace winner Dan Wheldon received $2,567,255 in cash prizes and designated awards.\nTypically, the presentation of the Borg-Warner Trophy replicas (\"Baby Borg\") for the driver and owner takes place in January in Detroit during the North American International Auto Show, but Wheldon was killed at Las Vegas in October. Car owners Bryan Herta and Steve Newey, along with Wheldon's widow Susie, were presented in Detroit with their trophies.\nThe Indianapolis 500-winning car, Dallara IR3007, was the seventh chassis made by Dallara Automobili from the 2003 specifications. Originally a Panther Racing car, it was sold to Adrian Fernandez and later Marty Roth, before FAZZT bought the car in 2010, which became Sam Schmidt Motorsports' car in 2011 when it was used to win the Indianapolis 500. It was raced the next race at Texas Motor Speedway as a Sam Schmidt Motorsports #99 for Wade Cunningham, who crashed it in the first of the Twin 275 km races. The car has been rebuilt and restored in 2011 Indianapolis 500 condition as part of a Wheldon tribute. (Andretti Autosport owns the other Wheldon winner, and is restoring that car too in 2005 Indianapolis 500 race-winning trim.)\nBroadcasting.\nTelevision.\nThe race was televised in high definition in the United States on ABC, the 47th consecutive year on that network. Marty Reid served as anchor. The telecast utilized the Side-by-Side format for commercial breaks. In the Indianapolis market, the live broadcast was blacked out on WRTV, and shown same-day tape delay in prime time. In some markets in northern Indiana, the final 15 laps of the race were not shown due to a weather bulletin.\nThe race received a 4.3 overnight rating on ABC, up 7% over 2010. The top local markets included Indianapolis (14.5), Dayton (10.5), and Fort Myers/Naples (8.5). The final rating was 4.0 with 6.711 million viewers, up 11% in ratings and 16% in viewership compared to 2010.\nTime trials and Carb Day were covered live in the United States on Versus. The announcing team consisted of Bob Jenkins, Jon Beekhuis and Wally Dallenbach Jr. Pit reporters included Lindy Thackston, Marty Snider, and Kevin Lee. Robin Miller serves as analyst and \"insider\".\nDaily practice was streamed live over the internet.\nRadio.\nThe race was broadcast on radio by the IMS Radio Network. Mike King served as anchor. The broadcast reached approximately 400 affiliates, as well as AFN, the LeSEA broadcasting network, and World Harvest Radio. The broadcast was carried on XM channel 145 and on Sirius channel 212 through the \"Best of XM\" package.\nAfter eliminating the position for 2010, the turn one location was brought back for the broadcast. Jerry Baker reprised his role in turn 1. The position was brought back in response to the league adopting double-wide restarts. Kenny Brack returned as \"driver expert\", joining the booth in-progress after participating in various pre-race festivities.\nWFNI broadcast nightly from the track with \"Trackside with Curt Cavin and Kevin Lee\", followed by Donald Davidson's \"The Talk of Gasoline Alley\".\nIn 2010, drivers from the starting field were used to recite the famous out-cue \"Stay tuned for the greatest spectacle in racing.\" For 2011, in celebration of the Centennial Era, the out-cues for each commercial break were recordings of previous renditions by the former \"Voices of the 500\". Each commercial break would feature a different chief announcer, rotating through Sid Collins, Paul Page, Lou Palmer, Bob Jenkins, and Mike King. This format was also used in 2009."

        "title": "NCAA Division I men's lacrosse tournament",
        "text": "The NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship tournament determines the annual top men's college lacrosse team in the NCAA Division I. This tournament has determined the national champion since the inaugural 1971 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship. From 1936 through 1970, the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA) awarded the Wingate Memorial Trophy annually to the collegiate champion based on regular season records.\nHistory.\nThe first Division I Championship tournament held in 1971 replaced the USILA and Wingate Memorial Trophy national title awards. As of 2023, 52 NCAA tournaments have been held (not held in 2020). In that span twelve teams — Johns Hopkins, Syracuse, Princeton, North Carolina, Virginia, Cornell, Duke, Maryland, Loyola University (Maryland), Denver, Yale and Notre Dame — have won the national title, with Syracuse leading with ten titles (plus one vacated by the NCAA). In all, 41 teams have participated in the NCAA tournament since its inception. Only seven unseeded teams — the 1988 Cornell Big Red, the 1991 Towson Tigers, the 2006 Massachusetts Minutemen, the 2010 Notre Dame Fighting Irish, the 2011 and 2012 Maryland Terrapins and the 2016 North Carolina Tar Heels — have made it to the championship game, and only ten unseeded teams have made it to the tournament semi-finals, the most recent being North Carolina in 2016. Johns Hopkins has appeared in every tournament but three (1971, 2013, 2021). The Number One seed in the tournament has won the title 17 times and there have been 13 undefeated National Champions. North Carolina in 2016 was the first unseeded team to win the national title.\nOriginally consisting of eight teams, the size of the tournament field has changed over the years, increasing to 10 in 1986, 12 in 1987, 16 in 2003, 18 in 2014, down to 17 in 2017, down again to 16 in 2021, and finally back up to 18 in 2022. The two semifinal games and the final have been played on the same weekend at the same stadium since 1986. All three matches have always been scheduled for Memorial Day weekend, with the semifinals doubleheader on Saturday afternoon and the final held on the holiday itself.\nThe sport has historically been focused in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states, with the sport's U.S. heartland today extending from New England to North Carolina. Only eight schools from outside the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic have played in the NCAA tournament—Air Force, Butler, Denver, Marquette, Notre Dame, Ohio State, Michigan and Utah. No team west of the Eastern Time Zone won an NCAA championship until Denver in 2015.\n20 coaches have won Division I titles: Richie Moran, Glenn Thiel, Bud Beardmore, Bob Scott, Henry Ciccarone, Willie Scroggs, Jr., Roy Simmons, Jr., Dave Klarmann, Don Zimmerman, Bill Tierney, Dom Starsia, John Desko, Dave Pietramala, John Danowski, Charley Toomey, John Tillman, Joe Breschi, Andy Shay, Lars Tiffany, and Kevin Corrigan. Tierney is the only one to have won at two different schools (Princeton and Denver).\nNCAA team titles.\nBelow is a list of championships awarded by the NCAA. A vacated title is not included in the total. \nResults by School and Year.\nKey\nEach tournament has seeded the top 8 seeds. The top seed is shown with , the teams seeded between No. 2 and No. 4 are shown with , and the teams seeded between No. 5 and No. 8 are shown with .\nChampionships 1881–present.\nBelow is a list of team championship titles, inclusive of those awarded prior to the formation of the NCAA Division I Championship. These include the ILA champions (1881–1898), the USIULL and ILA champions (1899–1905), the USILL champions (1906–1925), the USILA champions (1926–1935), and the Wingate Memorial Trophy (1936–1972) recipients. Of note several schools have claimed their Northern and Southern Division titles won during the USILL years as national championships (based on the results of 3 or 4 intra-division games), while others have not. Still others were acclaimed in their time as unofficial title winners based on being leading teams in the collegiate ranks in particular years. Furthermore, the USILL (1906–1925) was a closed membership organization. Some strong teams of the era, such as Army and Navy, were never members, so that in some years, the USILL champion was not necessarily the best team in the United States."

        "text": "In basketball, points are the sum of the score accumulated through free throws and field goals. The National Collegiate Athletic Association's (NCAA) Division I is the highest level of amateur basketball in the United States. The NCAA did not split into its current divisions format until August 1973. From 1906 to 1955, there were no classifications to the NCAA nor its predecessor, the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States (IAAUS). Then, from 1956 to 1973, colleges were classified as either \"NCAA University Division (Major College)\" or \"NCAA College Division (Small College)\". This is a comprehensive list (through the 2011–12 season) of all occurrences of an NCAA Division I men's basketball player scoring 60 or more points in a single game. The official NCAA men's basketball media guide includes two lists: one listing all 60+ point games against Division I opponents and the other listing all 60+ point games against non-Division I opponents.\nThe all-time record against a Division I opponent is 72 points. It was set by U.S. International's Kevin Bradshaw, a guard, on January 5, 1991, against Loyola Marymount in the highest-scoring game in Division I history. Loyola Marymount defeated U.S. International 186–140. Bradshaw shot 23 for 59 in field goal attempts overall (7 of 22 from three-point range) and made 19 of 23 free throws in his record-setting performance. After the game, Bradshaw reflected on the achievement, \"I'm still completely stunned. I wasn't gunning for the record until the last 10 minutes. That's when the bench became aware of the mark and the coaches allowed me to go for it. I won't be celebrating because we lost the game.\" He also remarked on how he was even able to put himself in the position to break Pete Maravich's record of 69 points: \"Our style of play allows for the freelancing that we do. I have to put up the ball a lot because we don't have a lot of shooters on the team.\"\nAmong the players who have scored 60+ points against Division I opponents, only LSU's Maravich, Oral Roberts' Anthony Roberts and Ole Miss' Johnny Neumann appear on the list more than once. Maravich's four career 60+ point games is the most in NCAA Division I history. Five players who achieved the feat against a Division I opponent—Maravich, Calvin Murphy, Oscar Robertson, Lew Alcindor (later Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) and Elgin Baylor—are all inductees in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Meanwhile, three players who achieved the feat against non-Division I opponents are also Hall of Fame inductees: Paul Arizin, Elvin Hayes, and Bob Pettit.\nThe highest scoring performance in NCAA Division I basketball history, regardless of the opponent's classification, is 100 points, scored by Frank Selvy of Furman against Newberry College on February 13, 1954. He made a still-standing NCAA record 41 field goals on 66 attempts. He made his final shot of the game—scoring his 99th and 100th points—with only two seconds remaining on a 40-foot attempt. Selvy later said, \"I'll say that I made at least eight or nine baskets that would have been three-pointers today. Plus they didn't have the one-and-one in those days.\" The performance occurred during Selvy's senior season in which he led the nation in scoring at 41.7 points per game. He also led the nation in scoring the previous year at 29.5 points per game. Coincidentally, a teammate of Selvy's for one season, Darrell Floyd, is the only player who has scored 60 or more points against both a Division I and a non-Division I opponent. Floyd scored 62 points against The Citadel (Division I) and 67 against (then) non-Division I Morehead State.\nAgainst non-Division I opponents.\nSome of the opponents on this list that are currently Division I universities were not classified as Division I schools at the time the 60-point game occurred. Five of the opposing schools in this list—Morehead State, Saint Peter's, Mercer, Marshall, and Valparaiso—are present-day Division I schools."

The National Collegiate Athletic Association's (NCAA) Division I scoring title is awarded to the player with the highest points per game (ppg) average in a given season. The NCAA did not split into its current divisions format until August 1973. From 1906 to 1955, there were no classifications to the NCAA nor its predecessor, the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States (IAAUS). Then, from 1956 to 1973, colleges were classified as either \"NCAA University Division (Major College)\" or \"NCAA College Division (Small College)\". The NCAA's official men's basketball media guide recognizes scoring champions beginning with the 1947–48 season; from 1935–36 to 1946–47, \"unofficial\" scoring champions were compiled from the annual \"National Basketball Committee Official Basketball Guide\".\nPete Maravich of LSU holds the all-time NCAA Division I records for career scoring (3,667) and average (44.2). His three consecutive scoring titles from 1968 to 1970 are also the three highest single-season averages in NCAA history.\nNine players have earned multiple scoring titles. The most recent player to accomplish this is Reggie Williams of Virginia Military Institute (2007, 2008). There have been two occurrences where, in back-to-back seasons, two different teammates have earned the NCAA scoring title. Frank Selvy and Darrell Floyd of Furman each won in 1954 and 1955, respectively, while Hank Gathers and Bo Kimble of Loyola Marymount won in 1989 and 1990, respectively.\nMany of the scoring champions from the 1986–87 season and earlier could have added significantly more points if the three-point line had been instituted. It wasn't until the 1987–88 season that the NCAA standardized the line and accounted for three-point field goals in its official record book. The only player since they were instituted to have not made a single three-point shot in his scoring title season is Gathers, who instead made 419 field goals and 177 free throws en route to scoring 1,015 points and averaging 32.7 points per game.\nOne prolific college basketball scorer who was not an NCAA scoring champion was Notre Dame's Austin Carr. Carr averaged 38.2 ppg as a junior in 1969–70 (tied for eighth highest in NCAA history) and 38.0 ppg as a senior in 1970–71 (tenth highest). Unfortunately for Carr, he happened to accomplish these feats while playing at the same time as Maravich, whose 44.5 ppg in 1969–70 is the highest in Division I history, and as Johnny Neumann, whose 40.1 ppg in 1970–71 is the fifth highest average. While finishing second in the scoring races each of his last two seasons, Carr is the only player on the NCAA's top ten single season scoring averages list who never won an NCAA scoring title.\nScoring leaders.\nExcept as specifically noted, all teams are listed under their current athletic brand names, which do not always match those used by a given program in a specific season.\nUnofficial.\nBetween 1935–36 and 1946–47, there were no \"official\" NCAA scoring champions. The statistics during that era were compiled from the \"National Basketball Committee Official Basketball Guide\", which was not regulated by NCAA authorities. Therefore, the following players are included in the annual NCAA men's basketball media guide, but are listed as unofficial season scoring leaders."

        "text": "In the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), the statistic for total games played in Division I men's basketball helps opposing coaches to monitor the extent that a particular player is used on a team. By definition, a player has \"played in a game\" when he enters the contest via substitution or by starting the contest. All that is required is that he is one of the five players for a team on the court for a minimal time of one second according to the game clock.\nAs of the end of the 2022–23 season, the all-time leader in games played is Jordan Bohannon, who played six seasons at Iowa and appeared in 179 games. Bohannon benefited from two special provisions of NCAA rules that allowed him to play in more than the standard four seasons.\nNormally, the only way for a player to play in more than four NCAA seasons is to qualify for a \"medical redshirt\", officially known by the NCAA as a \"hardship waiver\". To be eligible, a player must have participated in fewer than one third of his team's scheduled games in that season, and cannot have participated in any games in the second half of the season. Bohannon received a medical redshirt in 2019–20, a season in which he played 10 games. Several other players on the career leaders list benefited from this rule. Bohannon also benefited from a special NCAA eligibility waiver for the 2020–21 season, which was so heavily disrupted by COVID-19 that the NCAA announced it would not count that season against any player's period of eligibility. He chose to play a final season in 2021–22.\nSix other members of the career leaders list have played in six seasons:\nLeaders without COVID-19 waiver.\nThe overall top 25 is completely occupied by players who were active in the 2020–21 season and benefited from the COVID-19 waiver. The last players eligible to take advantage of this waiver will not complete their college eligibility until 2024–25, not counting any potential medical redshirt season in 2021–22 or later. For this reason, a separate list consisting solely of players who did not benefit from the waiver is being maintained.\nIncludes ties for 25th."

        "text": "A three-point field goal (also known as a \"three-pointer\" or \"3-pointer\") is a field goal in a basketball game, made from beyond the three-point line, a designated arc radiating from the basket. A successful attempt is worth three points, in contrast to the two points awarded for shots made inside the three-point line. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) keeps records of the Division I 3-point field made in a game leaders. The statistic was first recognized in the 1986–87 season when 3-point field goals were officially instituted by the NCAA. From the 1986–87 season through the 2007–08 season, the three-point perimeter was marked at for both men's and women's college basketball. On May 3, 2007, the NCAA men's basketball rules committee passed a measure to extend the distance of the men's three-point line back to , while the women's line would remain the same until being moved to match the men's arc starting with the 2011–12 season. In June 2019, the NCAA officially announced that the men's three-point line would be extended to match the FIBA standard of in a two-phase implementation, with Division I adopting the new distance in 2019–20 and Divisions II and III doing the same in 2020–21.\nThrough December 18, 2019, only 19 players have made at least 12 three-point field goals in a single game. Gary Bossert was the first and has the highest three-point field goal percentage among the 19. The all-time record is 15, which had only occurred one time between 1986–87 and 2017–18, by Marshall's Keith Veney. On December 14, 1996, he set the record against Morehead State. Then, within a two-night span in November 2018, two other players tied Veney's record. On November 14, Robert Morris' Josh Williams made 15, and then on November 15 Furman's Jordan Lyons matched it. Veney remains the only player to have made 15 threes against Division I opposition; Robert Morris' opponent of Mount Aloysius was in NCAA Division III, and Furman's opponent of North Greenville was Division II (both schools remain at those respective levels today). Only three other players have made 14 three-pointers: Ronald Blackshear, Dave Jamerson and Askia Jones. Blackshear and Jones did so against Division I opponents, while Jamerson's performance was against a Division II opponent. Jones' performance is an NCAA postseason record."

        "text": "In basketball, an assist is a pass to a teammate that directly leads to a score by field goal. The National Collegiate Athletic Association's (NCAA) Division I assist title is awarded to the player with the highest assists per game average in a given season. The assist title was first recognized in the 1950–51 season when statistics on assists were first compiled by the NCAA, but there are no officially recorded assist leaders between 1952–53 and 1982–83. The NCAA did not split into its current divisions format until August 1973. From 1906 to 1955, there were no classifications to the NCAA nor its predecessor, the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States (IAAUS). Then, from 1956 to 1973, colleges were classified as either \"NCAA University Division (Major College)\" or \"NCAA College Division (Small College)\".\nAvery Johnson of Southern University holds the all-time NCAA Division I record for single season assists per game (apg) average (13.30), which he accomplished in 1987–88. He also recorded 399 assists that season, which is the second highest single season mark behind UNLV's Mark Wade's record of 406, which occurred in 1986–87. From 1952–53 to 1982–83, the official NCAA record book has no assists per game leaders. Oklahoma freshman Trae Young was the first player to lead the NCAA in both assists and points in the 2017–18 season, while Murray State sophomore Ja Morant was the first player in NCAA history to average at least 20 points and 10 assists throughout the same season in the 2018–19 season.\nFour players have earned multiple assist titles: Avery Johnson of Southern (1987, 1988), Jared Jordan of Marist (2006, 2007), Jason Brickman of LIU Brooklyn (2013, 2014), and Yuri Collins of Saint Louis. There has been one tie for the national assists leader, which happened during the 2004–05 season when Damitrius Coleman of Mercer and Will Funn of Portland State recorded identical season statistics: 28 games played, 224 total assists and an 8.00 apg average.\nOnly three freshmen (T. J. Ford, Lonzo Ball, and Trae Young) and two sophomores (Jason Kidd and Ja Morant) have led Division I in average assists. Two players born outside the United States have led Division I in assists — 1995–96 leader Raimonds Miglinieks of UC Irvine, born in modern-day Latvia (the Latvian SSR of the Soviet Union at the time of his birth), and 1999–2000 leader Mark Dickel of UNLV, born in New Zealand.\nAssists leaders.\nExcept as specifically noted, all teams are listed with their current athletic brand names, which do not always reflect those used by a given program in a specific season."

        "text": "In basketball, a block (short for blocked shot) occurs when a defender deflects or stops a field goal attempt without committing a foul. The National Collegiate Athletic Association's (NCAA) Division I block title is awarded to the player with the highest blocks per game average in a given season. The block title was first recognized in the 1985–86 season when statistics on blocks were first compiled by the NCAA.\nDavid Robinson of Navy holds the all-time NCAA Division I record single-season total blocks record (207) which was set during 1985–86, coincidentally the first season that the NCAA kept track of blocked shots. Although Robinson holds the single-season record, it is Jarvis Varnado of Mississippi State who claims the all-time career blocked shots record (564). The highest single-season blocks per game (bpg) record is held by Northeastern's Shawn James, who averaged 6.53 blocks in 2005–06.\nFive players have been two-time NCAA bpg leaders: David Robinson (1986, 1987), Keith Closs (1995, 1996), Tarvis Williams (1999, 2001), Jarvis Varnado (2008, 2009), and Jamarion Sharp (2022, 2023). Additionally, six freshmen have led Division I in blocks: Alonzo Mourning (1989), Shawn Bradley (1991), Keith Closs (1995), Hassan Whiteside (2010), Anthony Davis (2012), and Chris Obekpa (2013). Among all-time NCAA blocks leaders, only Robinson, Mourning, and Shaquille O'Neal are members of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\nKeith Closs, the blocks leader in 1995 and 1996, only played college basketball for two seasons. He left the NCAA after only two years to pursue a career in professional basketball, thereby foregoing his final two seasons of eligibility under NCAA by-laws. Had he decided to stay at Central Connecticut, Closs could have potentially become the first player to lead Division I in blocks for not only three years, but possibly all four.\nNine players on this list were born outside the United States—Shawn Bradley in Germany (West Germany at the time of his birth), Adonal Foyle in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Wojciech Myrda in Poland, Deng Gai in what is now South Sudan (part of Sudan at the time of his birth), Chris Obekpa in Nigeria, Jordan Bachynski in Canada, Vashil Fernandez in Jamaica, Liam Thomas in Australia, and Ajdin Penava in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nBlocks leaders.\nAll teams are listed with their current athletic brand names, which do not always reflect those used by a given program in a specific season."

        "text": "A three-point field goal (also known as a \"three-pointer\" or \"3-pointer\") is a field goal in a basketball game, made from beyond the three-point line, a designated arc radiating from the basket. A successful attempt is worth three points, in contrast to the two points awarded for shots made inside the three-point line. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) keeps records of the Division I 3-point field goal makes per game (3PG) average annual leaders. The statistic was first recognized in the 1986–87 season when 3-point field goals were officially instituted by the NCAA. From the 1986–87 season through the 2007–08 season, the three-point perimeter was marked at for both men's and women's college basketball. On May 3, 2007, the NCAA men's basketball rules committee passed a measure to extend the distance of the men's three-point line back to , while the women's line would remain the same. The women's line would be moved back to match the men's line effective with the 2011–12 season. On June 5, 2019, the NCAA men's rules committee voted to extend the men's three-point line to the FIBA distance of , effective in 2019–20 in Division I and 2020–21 in lower NCAA divisions. The women's line remained at 20 ft 9 in until being moved to the FIBA distance in 2021–22.\nDarrin Fitzgerald of Butler owns the all-time NCAA single-season record of 3-pointers made per game (5.64) which he accomplished in 1986–87. His 158 three-pointers made that season is also the second highest total in history behind Stephen Curry's 162 in 2007–08. Some players—such as prolific scorers Darrell Floyd, Pete Maravich and Austin Carr—who competed prior to the 1986–87 season may have scored more baskets from what would have been 3-point territory if the rule had been in place during their college careers. The player with the highest 3PG average over the span of his entire career (with a minimum of 200 made threes) is Mississippi Valley State's Timothy Pollard, who made 4.57 per game over four years.\n3-point field goals per game.\nExcept as specifically noted, all teams are listed under their current athletic brand names, which do not always match those in use during a specific season."

It is the home of the Tasmania cricket team and the Hobart Hurricanes (a Twenty20 team in the Big Bash League), as well as being a Test, One Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 International (T20I) venue. It has a capacity of 16,000 spectators. As of December 2015, the ground has hosted 12 Test matches, the first in 1989 when Australia hosted Sri Lanka. It has also staged 34 ODI matches, the first of which was in 1988 when New Zealand lost to Sri Lanka by four wickets. As of October 2014, two T20Is have been played at the ground. The first was in 2010 when Australia beat the West Indies by 38 runs; the second was in 2014, when Australia defeated England by 13 runs.\nThe first Test century (100 or more runs in a single innings) scored at the ground was by Australian Mark Taylor in the third innings of the first Test match against Sri Lanka in 1989. In the same innings Dean Jones and Steve Waugh also scored centuries. As of December 2015, 31 Test centuries have been scored at the ground in 12 Test matches.

        "text": "The 2010 Russian Professional Rugby League season was the sixth edition of Russia's newly formatted top-flight rugby union competition, the Professional Rugby League (\"RPRL\"). The 2010 Professional Rugby League season has seen a transition to a traditional one league round-robin format with 8 teams taking place between May and September 2010. VVA Podmoskovye Monino are the reigning champions.\nThe two undisputed powerhouses of recent years, VVA-Podmoskovye and Yenisy-STM, were again expected to dominate, but Krasny-Yar had recruited well and were looking to break VVA's grip on the title. These three teams all had budgets seven figure euro budgets, and played at a standard roughly comparable to Championship (England) or Pro D2 (France) level, according to the RFU and FFR referees who officiate in the final stages of the competition.\nUnfortunately for the two Krasnoyarsk sides, despite a few upsets throughout the season, VVA Monino again was triumphant in the finals series, to claim a record 8th title.\nCompetition format.\nTo facilitate Russia's participation in the summer's Churchill Cup during June, changes to the league's structure were again made. The 2010 edition of the RPRL saw the dropping of the first phase of the season, which split the league into East and West sections and saw the involvement of several amateur teams. Instead, the RPRL was expanded into an eight-team tournament to be played on a home-and-away basis from May through September, before the top four teams play-off for the title in two best-of-three semi-finals and a best-of-three championship decider.\nPlans continued to be discussed during the year about future expansion of the league to 12, and then 16, teams in time, but the unique problems posed by Russia's vast geography mean this will be a slow process. The two new teams for this year, Spartak and Fili, are both from Moscow, meaning plans to bring in a team from Kazan, remained on hold. A former rugby league hotbed, Kazan is a major target for future expansion, with several age-group tournaments being held in the Tatar capital. Absent too were former league giant RC Lokomotiv Moscow, whose defection from the 13-man code resulted in a focus on Sevens only for the 2010 season. There was also no place in this year's RPRL for a team from the country's south, where rugby is increasingly popular, in particular in Krasnodar territory and the Rostov region.\nFixtures.\nMay\nJune\nJuly\nAugust\nSeptember\nPlayoffs Positions 5 to 8.\nSemi-Finals\nFinal for 7th Place\nFinal for 5th Place\nChampionship Semi-Finals.\nSemi-Finals \nChampionship finals.\n3rd Place Finals \nChampionship Finals"

It is run by the Brazilian Confederation of American Football (; CBFA).\nHistory.\n2000s.\nThe team was first convened in 2007 due to an opportunity to play a friendly game with Uruguay.\nThe Brazil team was first formed with players drafted from regional (state or city) tournaments that had various shapes and sizes. These tournaments included beach American football, flag football and touch football. The tryouts included interstate matches, physical tests and the availability of the athletes to participate since none of them were professionals.\nThe first game resulted in a bitter defeat against Uruguay, in Montevideo, by a score of 20–14.\nHowever, many positive lessons were learned that day. Despite several initial difficulties, the team had representatives from states of Mato Grosso, Rio de Janeiro, Santa Catarina and São Paulo. The general organization of the sport was already well established, more teams and tournaments were on the process of being created and the popularity of the sport was growing (mostly due to the broadcast of NFL games by ESPN).\nIn the year of 2008, the national team had a much stronger squad. Using the same methodology as the previous year, the team was able to field new reinforcements. Athletes from 3 other states (Paraná, Distrito Federal and Minas Gerais) were drafted to play its second game, this time at home. Unfortunately, by request of the other side, again the Uruguay national team, the game had to be cancelled, causing great disappointment to the athletes and everyone involved in the organizing of the event.\nIn the year of 2009, a national tournament first occurred. The best teams from each member state were chosen by the states to represent them in the tournament. The coaches of the Brazil National team now had an easier job in comparing their athletic abilities. In 2013, the Torneio Touchdown had 20 teams, some of them having naming partnership with famous association football clubs.\nThere is also a parallel federation with a separate national tournament. However, the Brazilian team may draft players from this tournament as well, despite having a lower quality level in general.\nThe Brazil team, along with Uruguay and Argentina, recently became members of the international entity IFAF.\n2010s.\nBrazil defeated Uruguay 49–0 on 26 April 2014.

        "text": "In basketball, a steal is the act of legally gaining possession of the ball by a defensive player who causes the opponent to turn the ball over. The National Collegiate Athletic Association's (NCAA) Division I steal title is awarded to the player with the highest steals per game average in a given season. The steal title was first recognized in the 1985–86 season when statistics on steals were first compiled by the NCAA.\nDesmond Cambridge of Alabama A&amp;M holds the all-time NCAA Division I records for single-season steals (160) and steals per game (5.52), which both occurred during the 2001–02 season. The all-time leader in career steals is Richmond's Jacob Gilyard (466), who benefited from the NCAA's blanket COVID-19 eligibility waiver which allowed all student-athletes who were active in 2020–21 to play a full additional season without penalty.\nIn 2011–12, two 'firsts' occurred: Jay Threatt of Delaware State became the first ever repeat season steals leader, and there was also a tie for the honor (Fuquan Edwin of Seton Hall tied Threatt with a 3.00 steals per game average). When Chavis Holmes of Virginia Military Institute (VMI) secured his national steals title in 2008–09 at 3.39 spg, he and his brother Travis became the first pair of siblings in NCAA basketball history to lead the nation in the same statistical category. Travis had led the country with a 3.36 spg average in 2006–07. Only two schools have had two different players win the steals title: Alabama A&amp;M (2002, 2005) and VMI (2007, 2009). The lowest steals total for a national per game leader is 78, and the lowest steals per game average to win is 2.83, both of which were achieved by Threatt.\nThree freshmen have led the nation in steals: Jason Kidd (1993), Joel Hoover (1997), and Devin Gibson (2008). Among them, Kidd tallied the highest steals per game average (3.79) and the most total steals (110). He would also go on to lead the NCAA in assists the following season as a sophomore."

The NCAA did not split into its current divisions format until August 1973. From 1906 to 1955, there were no classifications to the NCAA nor its predecessor, the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States (IAAUS). Then, from 1956 to spring 1973, colleges were classified as either \"NCAA University Division (Major College)\" or \"NCAA College Division (Small College)\".\nThe all-time leader in NCAA free throws made is Tyler Hansbrough of North Carolina. From 2005–06 through 2008–09, Hansbrough made 982 free throws, surpassing the 54-year-old record of 905 that was held by Wake Forest's Dickie Hemric. While Hansbrough's free throw percentage (79.1%) is better than Hemric's (66.6%), Hemric accomplished the feat in only 104 career games played compared to Hansbrough's 142.\nFive players on this list are Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductees: Pete Maravich, Oscar Robertson, Bill Bradley Joe Dumars, and Alonzo Mourning. Some players on this list, such as those whose career games played is below 100, played college basketball during the era before freshmen were allowed to play varsity basketball, and were instead allowed to play freshman or junior varsity basketball only. Their free throw makes and attempts could have been significantly higher had they played an additional season.\nTop 25 career free throw leaders.\nAll teams are listed under their current athletic brand names, which do not always match those in use when a listed player was active."

        "text": "Rugby shorts are a type of shorts that are worn while playing rugby. They are designed to take the strains of the game and have traditionally been made from cotton, in 1971 Polyester shorts were worn by international rugby teams such as Wales.\nFeatures.\nShorts should be comfortable, as tight shorts increase the chances of sustaining a serious injury. The longer and baggier shorts are, the easier it will be for opponents to pull an opponent back. The colour and style of shorts are determined by the players club.\nPurpose.\nRugby shorts must be able to withstand punishment and should be thick enough to provide some protection while playing. Most have pockets and many have a drawstring to prevent them coming down when tackled. While the most popular material has been cotton, modern shorts can also be made from higher grade polyester with reinforced seams. The use of these shorts is increasing as they are lighter, more durable, more comfortable, and better retain their color compared to traditional cotton shorts.\nTag rugby shorts are generally lighter due to the non-contact nature of the sport and have tags attached with velcro patches.\nIRB Regulations.\nLaw 4 of the International Rugby Board (IRB) Laws of the Game of Rugby Union 2010 relates to the clothing that a player may wear while playing rugby union. In particular:\n\"A player must not wear any items containing buckles, clips, rings, hinges, zippers, screws, bolts or rigid material or projection.\" \n\"\"A player must not wear shorts with padding sewn into them\".\" \nUnderwear.\nThe use of hard plastic padding of any kind, including abdominal guards (box), is forbidden in most leagues. However, unpadded jock straps can be used to provide support and prevent groin injuries. In the United States, the high-padding of American football has influenced some junior leagues to allow, or in some cases require, abdominal guards and jock straps.\nManufacturers.\nCanterbury of New Zealand is the most popular producer of rugby kit. Kooga are a very popular supplier, particularly to rugby league teams. Paladin Sports is also a very popular manufacturer for both Union &amp; League, as is Triple Play from Australia."

Coming around the final quarter mile Monarchos was in 13th place. The jockey of Monarchos; Jorge Chavez, managed to sweep past all the horses in front. He had pushed his horse hard enough to reward them with a four and three quarters length victory over the second place horse. This surge of excitement and effort awarded Monarchos with the second fastest winning time in Kentucky Derby History of 1:59 97.\nBackground information on trainer and jockey.\nThe trainer of Monarchos John T. Ward Jr. was born and raised in Lexington, Kentucky. He had attended and graduated from the University of Kentucky before he began his journey as a trainer. Prior to the Kentucky Derby, Chavez and Ward had competed in two races in Florida. They had placed 2nd in the Wood Memorial race before placing first in the Florida Derby.

Despite the backlash they were receiving, Chavez and his trainer Ward won their first ever Kentucky Derby.\nMonarchos accusations.\nAfter Monarchos crossed the finish line to win the Derby, the second place jockey Velazquez claimed that he was bumped into around the final turn. This accusation was later proven false and Chavez was given the bed of roses along with the victory. During an interview with Velazquez, he had admitted that Monarchos never hit him but did get in his way. \"The winner was the best horse in the race. This is the Derby and I had to take a shot. I probably wouldn't claim foul in any other race\" Velazquez said.\nEconomic effect.\nThe Kentucky Derby does not only change the lives of the jockey but also the commonwealth of Kentucky. The 2001 Derby specifically raised over $218 Billion for the economy of Kentucky. The overall wagering of this Derby rose to a record $107,589,904.\nMonarchos.\nMonarchos was a champions American Thoroughbred Stallion horse, and was born on February 9, 1998, in the United States. At the end of his career, his total earnings came to be $1,720,830, with an overall record of 10: 4–1–3.\nField.\nIn order to qualify, any horse that was to be nominated had to be three years old. An entry fee of $15,000 was levied against all nominations. Colts were not permitted to carry more than 126 pounds, and Fillies were not permitted to carry more than 121 pounds. A total of 441 horses were nominated to enter into the 2001 Kentucky Derby.\nRace description.\nMonarchos, bumped by Point Given at the start and forced in on Jamaican Rum, was outrun for six furlongs. He raced five or six wide, commenced a sweeping run five abreast on the second turn to come out a bit further entering the stretch. Monarchos caught Congaree approaching the final sixteenth and drew clear under steady left-handed encouragement. Invisible Ink, unhurried to the far turn, moved up between foes approaching the stretch and angled outside the winner to secure room in the upper stretch. Invisible Ink couldn't menace Monarchos, but closed with good determination to wear down Congaree for a second. Congaree, in hand early while tracking the leaders four or five wide, accelerated to the front about the five-sixteenths pole, and settled into the stretch with a clear advantage. Congaree showed the way into the final furlong but weakened gradually thereafter.\nThunder Blitz, bumped at the start when Balto Star came out, was outrun to the far turn while along the inside. He angled between rivals soon after while advancing, split foes approaching the final quarter, then improved position with a mild late run. Thunder Blitz returned bleeding from the mouth. Point Given broke to the inside bumping the winner, moved up steadily to gain a striking position five wide on the backstretch. Point Given made a threatening run on the second turn, but then flattened out when straightened for the drive.\nJamaican Rum, bumped at the start and squeezed back. Jamaican Rum was outrun for seven furlongs while racing well off the inside, leaned in while advancing six wide tightening it up on Dollar Bill at the three-eighths pole, then closed some ground while not a threat. A P Valentine, in behind rivals while unhurried into the backstretch, was checked when bumped by Talk Is Money at the half-mile ground, steadied between foes and was shuffled back at the three-eighths pole and rallied belatedly.\nExpress tour settled in a striking position while near the inside between foes on the backstretch, and made a menacing run after angling out slightly on the second turn. Express Tour then failed to sustain the needed momentum. Fifty Stars, outrun until the stretch while in behind rivals, angled out at the eighth pole but wasn't a factor. Startac failed to reach contention and was eight wide on the second turn and into the stretch. Millennium Wind, forwardly placed along the rail, was checked behind Songandaprayer, about the five-sixteenths pole and failed to threaten thereafter.\nArctic Boy, squeezed a bit at the start, failed to threaten. Songandaprayer was hustled to the front along the rail soon after the start, and made the pace under pressure to the second turn, then tired from the effort. Balto Star forced the pace between rivals for seven furlongs and gave way. Dollar Bill, angled in behind horses soon after the start, eased out a bit on the backstretch, and was forced to take up sharply. Dollar Bill then lost his action at the three-eighths pole when in tight quarters and was finished. Keats pressed the leaders three wide to the far turn and gave way thereafter. Talk is Money exchanged bumps with A P Valentine leaving the half-mile ground, gave way soon after and was distanced before going a mile and eased through the stretch. A foul claim by the rider of Invisible Ink against the winner for alleged interference at the quarter-mile ground was disallowed.\nMonarchos finished 4 3/4 lengths in front of Invisible Ink, who was a nose ahead of Congaree. Thunder Blitz ran fourth.\nIt was the second-fastest winning time in the Kentucky Derby, and the first year time was extended to hundredths instead of fifths. The 1:59.97 would have been equivalent to a 2:00.0 time in previous years."

        "title": "Baseball menko",
        "text": "Baseball menko are an early type of Japanese baseball cards, originally designed for use in the children's game of \"menko\", but now avidly collected by baseball fans and card collectors. The word \"menko\" is used in both the singular and the plural form.\nHistory.\nThe earliest known baseball menko, a generic baseball player, was from 1897. The menko card set in Gary Engel's Japanese Baseball Card Checklist and Price Guide is from 1929, depicting black and white (or sepia) images of Big Six University players. They are called the \"1929 Nichieido Seika B&amp;W Photo Bookmark Menko.\"\nInterest in the sport of baseball was promoted by the visit of the 1934 All-Stars that include many prominent players such as Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Jimmy Foxx, and Charlie Gehringer. At first, menkos displayed unnamed players, generic cards that would be later replaced by menkos depicting popular colleges, high schools and then professional players.\nAnother highlight in the history of Japanese cards came in 1945 when Japan lost World War II and General Douglas MacArthur banned traditional Japanese heroes. Therefore soldiers and samurais were removed from the menkos, being replaced by Japanese baseball stars and sumo wrestlers as \"hero figures\". In the 1950s, the popularization of television and the broadcasting of local games (with the Tokyo Giants and the Hanshin Tigers as some of the most representative teams) spread the popularity of the sport (and its merchandising) in the country.\nShapes.\nBaseball menko exist in three shape categories: round, die-cut, and rectangular, and in a variety of sizes. The earliest die-cut and round menko sets cataloged by Engel are from 1947.\nDiecut.\nThe \"1947 Diecut Menko\" are wide by high, with color caricatures of six NPB players, including star players Tetsuharu Kawakami and Hiroshi Ohshita (Oshita). The backs each contain:\n1. A paper/stone/scissors symbol,\n2. The player's family name in kanji,\n3. The player's team nickname in katakana,\n4. A line drawing of a generic baseball player,\n5. A 5- or 6-digit number.\nRound.\nThe \"1947 Red or Blue Borders\" round menko were in diameter, with cartoon-like players on the front and blank backs. The team name in English, an arithmetic addition or subtraction, and the player name and sometimes position in kanji were also on the front.\nOther baseball cards.\nThere are a wide variety of Japanese baseball cards that are not called \"menko\", including bromides (blank-backed photos originally made with silver bromide paper); cards packaged with food, candy, and gum; game cards, including \"Karuta\" and Takara cards.\nIn the 1970s and 1980, some companies produced and marketed baseball cards in Japan, some of them were the Takara Company (which produced the highly successful baseball sets, although it did not renew production the following years due to poor sales), and the Calbee Corporation (which inserted baseball cards to its potato chips packs). Calbee started commercialising cards in 1973, having released several collections since then. By 2012, Calbee had marketed over 1 billion cards. Calbee is regarded as the first company to consistently produce an annual set in Japan. Other manufacturing companies are Yamakatsu, NST/Mr. Baseball, Lotte Gum, and Mermaid.\nTakara produced cards for a dice game similar to Strat-O-Matic, from 1978 to 1988. Another company, BBM, released its first set in 1991. BBM sets were the first to feature almost every player in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) team."

        "text": "The Yale Bulldogs men's basketball team represents Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, competing in the Ivy League. The team plays home games in the John J. Lee Amphitheater of the Payne Whitney Gymnasium. The team has reached the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament seven times, in 1949, 1957, 1962, 2016, 2019, 2022, and 2024. The current head coach is James Jones.\nHistory.\nYale has been named national champion on six occasions – in 1896, 1897, 1899, and 1900 by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll, which started to retroactive selections with the 1895–96 season; and in 1901 and 1903 by the Helms Athletic Foundation, which began retroactive selections with the 1900–01 season.\nPenn and Yale played in the First College Basketball game with five men on a team in 1897.\nIn 1969 -- against the wishes of the NCAA -- Yale Jewish center Jack Langer played for Team United States at the 1969 Maccabiah Games in Israel. He did so with the approval of Yale President Kingman Brewster. The university said it would not stop him from \"what we feel is a matter of religious freedom,\" and all Ivy League presidents fully endorsed Yale's stand. After that, Yale played Langer in basketball games the following season. A special assistant to the President of Yale, Henry Chauncey, Jr., said: \"There is no question that Jack Langer will continue to play basketball. We don't care what they do - Jack Langer will play when the coach wants to use him.\" On January 15, 1970, the NCAA Council placed Yale University on two‐year \"full athletic probation\" in all sports. It thereby restricted Yale teams and athletes (not just basketball players) for two years from competing in NCAA tournaments, championships and other postseason competitions and from receiving any monies for televised events. The decision impacted 300 Yale students, every Yale student on its sports teams, over the next two years. \nThe Presidents of the other seven Ivy League schools issued a statement condemning the NCAA's actions regarding the \"Langer Case.\" \"The Harvard Crimson\" called the probation \"unjust but intolerable,\" and urged the Ivy League to withdraw from the NCAA. Harvard track and field captain Ed Nosal and two other Harvard athletes, sympathetic to Langer and Yale and disdainful of the absurdity of the NCAA rule, protested at the 1970 NCAA Indoor Track and Field Championships by standing on the awards stand wearing blue Yale jerseys. In February 1970, Representative Robert N. Giaimo (D-Connecticut) said in the U.S. Congress:\nThe Yale case, involving basketball player Jack Langer, is tragic. It shows that the NCAA is willing to use any weapon in its continuing power struggle with the Amateur Athletic Union. It shows that the NCAA does not care if it hurts member institutions or individual athletes in the process. It shows once again that the NCAA is ... under the control of a stubborn, dictatorial hierarchy that does not hesitate to use athletes and schools alike as mere pawns in a game of power politics.\nYale has won seven Ivy League championships – 1957, 1962, 1963, 2002, 2016, 2019 and 2020. It also won the Eastern Intercollegiate Basketball League, the forerunner to the Ivy League, eight times – 1902, 1903, 1907, 1915, 1917, 1923, 1933 and 1949. The Bulldogs captured the first official Ivy League title in 1957, finishing 12–2 and losing to eventual national champion North Carolina, 90–74, in the NCAA East Regional. The 1962 club finished 13–1 in Ivy play but lost overtime to Wake Forest, 92–82, in the East Regional. The 1963 team tied Princeton for the Ivy title with an 11–3 record but fell to the Tigers in a playoff, 65–53. In 2002, the Bulldogs were part of the first three-way tie in Ivy history. Yale beat Princeton 76–60 in the first Ivy playoff game but fell to Penn 77–58 to determine the NCAA berth. In 2015, Yale tied Harvard for the Ivy title with an 11–3 record, with a playoff between the two to determine the NCAA automatic bid. Harvard won that playoff game at the Palestra in Philadelphia on March 14, 2015, with a score of 53–51, thus preventing Yale from reaching the NCAA tournament in which the Bulldogs had not appeared in 53 years. The Bulldogs won the Ivy League championship outright in 2016 with a 13–1 conference record to advance to the NCAA Tournament for the first time in 54 years. \nThe team has appeared in seven NCAA Tournaments overall (in 1949, 1957, 1962, 2016, 2019, 2022 and 2024). On March 17, 2016, Yale defeated the Baylor Bears 79–75 in the first round of the NCAA Tournament for the school's first Tournament victory. In 2019 Yale beat Harvard, 97–85 to win its first Ivy League Men's Basketball Tournament. Yale won its second Ivy League Men's Basketball Tournament in 2022 when, on March 12, the #2 seed Yale outlasted the #3 seed University of Pennsylvania, with a score of 66–64.\nPostseason history.\nNCAA tournament results.\nYale has appeared in the NCAA tournament seven times. The Bulldogs' combined record is 2–8.\nNIT results.\nYale has been to the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) twice.

        "text": "The Pepperdine Waves men's basketball team is an American college basketball team that represents Pepperdine University in NCAA Division I, the highest level of intercollegiate athletics sanctioned by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The Waves compete in the West Coast Conference and are coached by Lorenzo Romar who will not be retained at the conclusion of the 2023-24 season . The Waves have competed in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament 13 times and are 3rd all-time in WCC Tournament wins and championships. The Waves most recently appeared in the NCAA tournament in 2002. Thirty-eight former Waves have been drafted or played in the NBA including Doug Christie and Dennis Johnson, an inductee of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. The most recent Waves drafted into the NBA are Kessler Edwards (2021) and Maxwell Lewis (2023). \nTheir home arena is the Firestone Fieldhouse. This is a multi-purpose facility that hosts volleyball, basketball, as well as other athletic events. They share this facility with the Pepperdine Waves women's basketball team.\nHistory.\nEarly years and independence.\nThe Pepperdine Men’s Basketball team played their first season in 1938-39. The Waves would reach their first postseason tournament under coach Alva Duer four years later and would go on to compete in the 6th ever NCAA Tournament in 1944. Within the first eight years of the program’s history, the Waves would also earn invitations to four NAIA tournaments for a total of five postseason tournaments, including reaching the 1945 NAIA championship game. Al Duer would later be inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 1982 for his contributions to the sport. \nTheir next coach was Robert “Duck” Dowell who led the Waves for 20 seasons, winning four consecutive California Collegiate Athletic Association titles and competing in three NAIA tournaments between the 1949-50 to 1951-52 seasons. Dowell led the Waves to their second NCAA Tournament after winning the WCC regular-season championship in 1961-62.\nThe early years of Pepperdine’s basketball program would be a time of great change. During this period the Waves played basketball as independents and hosted their home games in a variety of locations including historic sports venues such as The Great Western Forum and the Los Angeles Sports Arena. But as the program continued to grow, it became clear that the Waves needed both a home conference and a dedicated arena. Pepperdine would join the West Coast Conference for the 1955-56 season with their long time rival Loyola Marymount and on November, 30th, 1973 they constructed Firestone Fieldhouse on campus near Malibu, California.\n1970s - 1990s Rolling the West Coast Conference.\nTwo years later the 1975-76 Pepperdine squad would win their second WCC regular-season championship under head coach Gary Colson and advance to their third NCAA Tournament, defeating the University of Memphis in the first round. The Waves would return to the NCAA Tournament in 1979 collecting another first round victory, this time over the University of Utah. \nIn 1979 Jim Harrick was selected as the next head coach. Over the next nine years he would lead the Waves to six postseason tournaments including NIT appearances in 1980 and 1988 and four NCAA Tournament appearances in 1982 (defeating Pittsburgh in the first round), 1983, 1985, and 1986. Their trip to the 1983 tournament was particularly memorable as Pepperdine would take eventual national champion North Carolina State to double overtime. Although the Waves eventually fell 69-67, it was the closest game NC State played the entire tournament as they defeated their next five opponents all in regulation by an average of six points. \nTom Asbury was then promoted from assistant to head coach in 1988. In just six seasons at the helm, Asbury led the waves to a cumulative record of 125–59 (.679), five postseason tournaments, and the most consecutive conference wins in WCC history known as “The Streak.” The Waves competed in the NIT in 1989 and 1993 as well as three more trips to the NCAA Tournament in 1991, 1992, and 1994. \n2000 Cinderellas.\nJan van Breda Kolff would then take over the program and lead Pepperdine to their twelfth NCAA Tournament appearance in 2000. The eleventh-seeded Waves would become the Cinderella team of the tournament and upset the Indiana Hoosiers in the first round in what would become Bob Knight’s final game as the program’s coach. Pepperdine then fell to eventual Elite 8 team Oklahoma State.\nOver the next two years the Waves would build on this success posting a record of 44–18 and return to both the NIT in 2001 and the program’s thirteenth NCAA Tournament in 2002. In the 2001-02 season Pepperdine tied nationally ranked Gonzaga for the WCC regular-season title and earned an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament with wins over USC as well as 10th-ranked UCLA and 13th-ranked Gonzaga.\nBreaking Records and Lorenzo Romar Returns.\nIn the years that followed the Waves have seen numerous program records broken including in 2016 when Stacy Davis became the all-time leading scorer and in 2017 when Jeremy Major became the all-time leader in assists. Both of these records would then be broken again by Colbey Ross who finished his Pepperdine career in 2021 as the program’s all-time leader in scoring, assists, and with several other records. Colbey Ross is also the first player in NCAA Division I men’s basketball history to accumulate totals of at least 2,200 points, 800 assists and 400 rebounds.\nAfter a brief stint in the late 90s, Lorenzo Romar returned 19 years later as Pepperdine’s head coach for the 2018-19 season. In his first season back with the Waves, Romar completed a historic turnaround for the program, increasing the team’s win total from the previous season by ten. Two years later his 2020-21 squad would win the program’s first ever postseason tournament, the 2021 College Basketball Invitational, by defeating Coastal Carolina 84–61.\nPepperdine is 3rd all-time in WCC tournament wins and championships as well as WCC league wins since 1979 when the conference expanded to its current size. Throughout their long history the Waves have competed in 29 postseason tournaments including 6 NITs and 13 NCAA Tournaments.\n\"The Streak\".\nFrom January 12, 1991, to January 29, 1993, the Pepperdine Waves went on a record-setting run known as “The Streak.” During this span the Waves won 38 West Coast Conference games in a row including the WCC tournament. This was the first time in 36 years that a team had won more than 31 league games in a row. The last team to do this were the 1954-57 San Francisco Dons led by Bill Russell who set the then-record at 31 consecutive games.\nLed by Coach Tom Asbury and star shooting guard Doug Christie, The Streak began with a win over Santa Clara before earning 12 more wins to finish the 1990-91 season 13-1 in WCC play and 22-9 overall. This span includes season sweeps against programs LMU (just one year removed from their NCAA Tournament run to the Elite 8), Gonzaga, and Saint Mary’s. The season culminated with the Waves beating Saint Mary’s for a third time in five weeks to win the WCC tournament and earn a trip to the NCAA Tournament. \nThe following 1991-92 season the Waves continued to improve and went undefeated in the regular season sweeping their rival programs LMU, Gonzaga, as well as Saint Mary’s for a second consecutive year. At 14-0 this season also tied Pepperdine’s record for most conference wins in a single season. The margin of victory in those games also grew with the Waves defeating their WCC opponents by an average of roughly 12 points per game. Pepperdine would go on to win a second straight WCC tournament and compete in the NCAA Tournament for the second time in two years. At the conclusion of the season the winning streak had grown to 27 regular season games and 33 overall. The 1991-92 Waves were only the second WCC squad ever to go a perfect 14-0 in league and win the tournament title in the same season. Coach Tom Asbury and shooting guard Doug Christie would each earn WCC Coach of the Year and WCC Player of the Year awards respectively for the second consecutive year. \nFinally during the 1992-93 season the Waves would extend their winning streak to 38 consecutive WCC games, breaking the 36 year old record, as well as win a third consecutive regular-season title. The Streak came to an end in January 1993 when, ironically, the previous record holders San Francisco defeated the Waves 75-72. In three seasons from 1990-91 to the end of 1992-93 Pepperdine won three WCC regular-season titles, two WCC tournament championships, and held a combined record of 38–4. \nWhile the Gonzaga Bulldogs came close to breaking the record, winning 35 games from February 2020 to February 2022, their series came to an end when conference rival Saint Mary’s defeated them 67-57. Over 30 years later no West Coast Conference team has ever won more than 38 consecutive league games and The Streak stands as a key part of WCC history that remains unmatched to this day.\nRivalries.\nThe Pepperdine–LMU basketball rivalry, referred to as The PCH Cup since 2009, is an American college basketball rivalry between the Pepperdine Waves and LMU Lions. The first game of the 177-game series was played in the 1940-41 season, fifteen years before both teams joined the West Coast Conference. This makes the rivalry the oldest and most played in WCC history.

        "text": "The Loyola Marymount Lions men's basketball team represents Loyola Marymount University in men’s college basketball. The team competes in the West Coast Conference. The team has played its home game at Gersten Pavilion since 1981.\nLoyola Marymount's last appearance in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament was in 1990, where they advanced to the Elite Eight. They lost to eventual national champion UNLV. Prior to the NCAA tournament, Lions star player Hank Gathers died during the West Coast Conference men's basketball tournament from a heart condition. The Lions defeated New Mexico State, defending champion Michigan, and Alabama. The 1990 squad was also the highest scoring team in NCAA Division I history with an average of 122 points per game.\nHistory.\nLoyola Marymount has played in the West Coast Conference since 1955, when the Lions and Pepperdine Waves joined the hitherto Northern Californian league that included Santa Clara University, the University of San Francisco, Saint Mary's College, and the University of Pacific. LMU has played in the WCC ever since, fostering heated rivalries with all WCC members, especially Pepperdine University and the University of San Diego, a WCC member since 1979.\nLMU's early basketball history produced two Lions better known for their coaching tenures at other WCC schools than their LMU careers. Pete Newell and Phil Woolpert were classmates at LMU, graduating in 1939. Newell went on to coach the San Francisco Dons to the 1949 NIT title, and the California Golden Bears to the 1959 NCAA tournament championship. Newell is considered one of the most influential coaches in the history of basketball. Woolpert coached the legendary Bill Russell and K.C. Jones led University of San Francisco Dons to NCAA championships in 1954 and 1955.\nThough LMU represented the WCC in the 1961 NCAA tournament, the Lions were consistently also rans in the WCC which included powerful University of San Francisco and Santa Clara University teams. Of note from LMU's early WCC teams is Rick Adelman, the 1968 WCC Player of the Year, who enjoyed a 7 year NBA career followed by a 30-year NBA coaching career.\nThe Lions burst onto the national basketball scene in the late 1980s under coach Paul Westhead. His teams led Division I in scoring in 1988 (110.3 points per game), 1989 (112.5) and 1990 (122.4). LMU's 122.4 point per game in 1990 was still a record as of October 2010. As of October 2010, Loyola Marymount held the five highest combined scoring games in Division I history. Four of the five occurred during Westhead's career, including a record 331 in the 181–150 win over United States International University on January 31, 1989.\nHank Gathers and Bo Kimble transferred to LMU from the University of Southern California. In the 1988–89 season, Gathers became the second player in NCAA Division I history to lead the nation in scoring and rebounding in the same season, averaging 32.7 points and 13.7 rebounds per game. In the 1989–90 season, Kimble led the nation in scoring averaging 35.3 points per game. Both Gathers and Kimble were consensus second team All-American selections in 1990.\nIn the 1989–90 season, during the second round of the WCC tournament, Gathers collapsed and died on the court due to a heart condition. The team nevertheless reached the Elite Eight in the 1990 NCAA tournament. Its three postseason wins included a 149–115 regional victory over Michigan that established NCAA men's tournament records for points by one team and combined points in a single game. The Lions ultimately were eliminated by UNLV, a team that went on to win the national championship. Loyola Marymount's final record was 26–6. Gathers (#44) and teammate Bo Kimble (#30) later had their jerseys retired by LMU.\nLMU alumnus Mike Dunlap took over the program in 2014 and guided the Lions until the end of the 2020 season. Dunlap was formerly the head coach of the Charlotte Bobcats.\nOn April 8, 2020, Stan Johnson was announced as the 27th head coach of Loyola Marymount.\nPostseason results.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Lions have appeared in the NCAA tournament five times.

If a team offers a Type A free agent arbitration and he signs with another club, the player's former team obtains the new team's first- or second-round pick, depending on whether the new team is in the top 15 or bottom 15 in won–loss records in 2011, as well as a supplemental pick after the first round. If a team offers a Class B free agent arbitration and he signs with another club, the former team gets a supplemental pick after the first round.\nOn September 8, 2019, Danny Hultzen became the last of the first 29 picks to appear in a Major League game, when he made his debut for the Chicago Cubs."

        "title": "Australian University Sailing",
        "text": "University sailing in Australia has gone through a process of growth, decline and now regrowth. Since the first inter-varsity competition in the 1960s in Adelaide, university sailing has played an important role in the Australian sailing scene. The first club to be established was the Adelaide University Sailing Club in 1959 and by the 1990s, many of the larger universities in Australia had either sailing or windsurfing clubs. The main classes of competition were Sharpies, Tasars, Lasers and 420s for sailing dinghies and the Original Windsurfer One-Design for the sailboard discipline. The clubs' organised regattas and social events were held each year which created an environment where sailing could be both social and competitive. University sailing made the sport accessible and financially easier for students without prior experience, while those with a competitive streak could compete in State and National class regattas as well as the all important Inter-varsity events.\n2003 Australian University Games\nIn 2003 the Australian National University hosted the Australian University Games for Sailing held on Lake Burley Griffin in Canberra.\nVoluntary Student Unionism.\nThe introduction of the Voluntary Student Unionism legislation in 2005 had a significant effect on university clubs and resulted in many of them being closed with their assets sold off, often at discount prices. The only clubs to survive or remain active from 2005 to 2009 were the clubs from Adelaide University, Queensland University of Technology, University of Queensland, University of Sydney, University of New South Wales (windsurfing), Australian National University and University of Tasmania. Even these clubs had very limited activity and resources.\nBuilding a Championship.\nIn 2009, the Sydney University Sailing Club drove the establishment of a new national competition holding a university fleet-racing regatta in April and a teams racing regatta in October. The two events were a large success showing the need for a larger, more formally organised, national championship. The fleet regatta in April attracted students from 10 universities and was held over three days at Woollahra Sailing Club, in Rose Bay, Sydney. The teams racing regatta was held at Royal Prince Alfred Yacht Club, Newport (just north of Sydney), included 11 teams from 7 universities. \nThe new events were also successful in bringing together students from universities that did not have active clubs. The best examples of these are UTS and UNSW. These two universities once had large university sailing clubs but in the post VSU environment, had been dissolved. A new group of students from these universities was keen to re-establish clubs and from the beginning of 2010, began to recruit members. These clubs now work in cooperation with Sydney University to organise successful, social and competition events based from Woollahra Sailing Club.\nThe largest sailing club in the post VSU environment is now the University of Queensland Sailing Club, with over 150 members. The club now owns a one of largest fleets of Hobie Getaways in Australia, as well as several Pacers which are used for learn to sail courses and teams racing training. However, unlike many other Australian university sailing clubs, many of The University of Queensland Sailing Club's events now have a social sport focus.\nAustralian University Games.\nAfter the success of the first two regatta events, Australian University Sport and Yachting Australia moved to establish a committee to look into the details of a new national championship. In early 2010, it was finally agreed that a new sailing championship should be established that should be included in the annual Australian University Games. The new competition would be made up of two three-day sections in the disciplines of teams racing and match racing.\nThe 2010 AUG was held in Perth with sailing as a demonstration sport. Every second year, the event returns to the Gold Coast. In 2011, sailing stayed on as a full sport, with medal points going towards university totals, in a 3-day teams racing format. UWA were the champions at both events. \nThe 2015 championship was won by the Australian Maritime College with UNSW and ANU taking out the other places. (Match racing - Elliott 6). The University of Queensland Sailing Club has won teams racing (Pacers) consecutively from 2016 to 2019."

The winning horse Fusaichi Pegasus was the first betting favorite to win the Derby since Spectacular Bid in 1979. This was the last Kentucky Derby race to be broadcast on ABC, ending a 25-year association with the network; NBC took over the broadcast rights the next year and has broadcast the race since then.\nHistory of Kentucky Derby.\nThe Kentucky Derby was started by Meriweather Lewis Clark, nephew of John and Henry Churchill, in Louisville, Kentucky. Meriweather Lewis Clark started a jockey club that raised money to build the track land that was donated by his uncles. Construction began in 1874 and the first race was in 1875, on May 17. His idea came from traveling in Europe and being inspired by the top racing places. Since the Derby is the biggest day in Kentuckys history, a tradition that has been made since 1921 is 'My Old Kentucky Home' is played when the horses walk to the gates for the race. Another tradition is the mint julep that has been around for at least a century originated in the south; this drink is made of bourbon, sugar, mint, and crushed ice.\nImportance of the Kentucky Derby.\nThe Kentucky Derby is seen by Kentuckians \"as important as Christmas\" this day unites the state of Kentucky. Whether Kentuckians are at the Derby at Churchill Downs or watching from their living room nearly the whole state watches in unison \"The Most Exciting Two Minutes in Sports\". The race is not just important in Kentucky or the United States, its popularity is seen around the globe. People and horses from around the world flock to Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky on the first Saturday in April to watch the short race. Those who attend the Derby can be seen dressed casually drinking, the official drink of the derby, a mint julep as they watch the races leading up to the main post. The Kentucky Derby brings together people from all over the globe and is by far the biggest sporting event of the year for Kentucky. Colonel Matt Winn was a part of a management team that took over Churchill downs in 1902. He was responsible for the promotion of the derby and made it from just a local event to the most iconic American horse race.\nBackground.\nFusaichi Pegasus is known fondly as “the most expensive racehorse of all time.” Fusaichi Pegasus was born to mare Angel Fever, who was purchased from Bob McNair and Arthur Hancock’s Stone Farm for $525,000. Fusaichi Pegasus was sold at the 1998 Keeneland July yearling sale to a Japanese businessman, Fusao Sekiguchi, who purchased the yearling at $4 million--the most expensive sale in 13 years. Fusaichi Pegasus was named after the last four letters, “ichi” which means “best” and “Pegasus\", which refers to the winged mythical creature. After Fusaichi Pegasus' winning debut at the Kentucky Derby on May 6, 2000, Fusaichi was sold by Sekiguchi for a record of $70 million. This record-selling horse went to Coolmore Stud in Ireland, and he's held the title of \"the most expensive horse in history\" all the way through to his retirement of stud duties at Coolmore Stud in Kentucky during 2020.\nFusaichi Pegasus.\nFusaichi Pegasus was the name of the horse who won the 2000 Kentucky Derby and was ridden by jockey Kent Desormeaux. A large price was paid for Pegasus at Keeneland, by a buyer by the name of Fusao Sekiguchi, $4 million was how much was paid for Pegasus. His Buyer, Fusao Sekiguchi claimed \"I had to have him. I had no limits on how much I would spend.\" Fusichi was chosen to be this horses name because it is a mix of the owners name \"Fusao\" combined with the Japanese word \"ichi\" which translates to \"number one.\" Fusichi Pegasus won the 2000 Kentucky Derby by an entire one and a half lengths and finished with a time of 2:01 which was the sixth fastest finishing time thought the one hundred and twenty six years of derby's. This made Pegasus the 9th fastest Kentucky Derby winner ever.\nWinning Prize and Training.\nThe horses are worth millions, the purse will be split between the top 5 finishers. The first-place winner receives around $1.86 million which is more than 60% of the total purse. This money that is won goes towards training, supplies, and some most is pocketed. The jockey receives 10% of the winning money, but that is budgeted by his agent and the valet that helps him prepare for the race. Some of the $186,000 that the jockey gets also goes towards taxes.\nTraining that goes into the horse occurs every day. The training happens in the morning and warms up with a jog that is about 1/8 of a mile, then the next half mile is a gallop. Next the horse gets to a good speed and then slows back down to a slow gallop and finishes with a jog. One month before, the workouts are extended and timed with a stopwatch. The jockey rides the horse prior to the race so they can build a relationship and the jockey can sense how the horse rides. The jockey also usually exercises the other horses the owner has, if he/she does.\nCost.\nOwning a race horse is very expensive, there is a good amount of up keep the horse needs. The horse by itself can range from $2k to $380,000, some can go for over a million depending on the type of horse it is. The derby has an entrance fee of $25,000 and a starting fee of another $25,000. Vet bills are around $300-$1500 per month. Jockey fees are over $10k, a blacksmith is around $80-$100 every month, dentist is $75 every month, and chiropractors are around $75 every month. The other thing is trainers charge a day rate around $100, this contains employees, payroll taxes, workers comp, feeding and bedding, vitamins and supplies.\nKeeneland.\nKeeneland is located in Lexington, Kentucky, about six miles west of The University of Kentucky. Keeneland is a thoroughbred house and race track. Where horse racing is hosted annually every fall and spring. Buyers can see horses race at the Keenland race track, then later purchase them at the auction house. From then buyers would assemble a horse racing team with a jockey and trainers and race their horse, in hopes that the horse will eventually make it to the national stage of the Kentucky Derby. Twenty-two winners of the Kentucky Derby were purchased at Keeneland, Fusaichi Pegasus being one of them.\nRace Description.\nFusaichi Pegasus broke to the inside left of the field at the start of the race, saving ground along the backstretch. Trippi takes early lead, with Hal’s Hope challenging early on. Aptitude won along the backstretch, easing outside Fusaichi Pegasus nearing the final sixteenth. When rounding the clubhouse turn, Hal's Hope is in the front, following Trippi on the outside in second place. At the 1/2 mile mark, Fusaichi Pegasus finds room in the back towards the inside, having a lot of ground to make up, being eight links from the front. On the far turn, Hal's Hope is continuing to lead the way on the inside. By the 3/4 mile mark, Hal's Hope and Trippi are neck and neck of one another. We then see in the middle of the track that Captain Steve and Wheelaway have made advancing movements, and can see Fusaichi Pegasus in fifth place. Wheelaway takes lead by a head, with More Than Ready following in line. Fusaichi Pegasus comes flying on the outside, passing and taking the lead. Fusaichi Pegasus wins the Kentucky Derby by a leg and a half, with Aptitude following just behind."

        "text": "The Drexel Dragons men's basketball program represents intercollegiate men's basketball at Drexel University. The team currently competes in the Colonial Athletic Association in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and plays home games at the Daskalakis Athletic Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Drexel last appeared in the NCAA tournament in 2021.\nRivalries.\nThe Dragons, a member of the City 6, have rivalries with multiple institutions, these include La Salle University, Temple University, University of Pennsylvania, Saint Joseph's University, and Villanova University.\nThe most notable rivalry Drexel has is with Penn, nicknamed Battle of 33rd Street, one of the closest rivalries geographically.\nHistory.\nAccording to Basketball-Reference.com, Drexel was the 5th US school to start up collegiate basketball, their first season being 1894–1895. Drexel's first basketball game was played against Temple College on November 22, 1894, which Drexel won by a score of 26–1. The Dragons joined Division I in 1974. Drexel has received bids to five NCAA basketball tournaments in 1986, 1994, 1995, 1996, and 2021. During the 1996 tournament, Malik Rose led the team to their only second round appearance after an upset of fifth-seeded Memphis. Prior to this, Drexel had appeared in four Division II NCAA tournaments in 1957, 1960, 1966 and 1967, including the very first Division II tournament in 1957. Drexel's men's basketball team was ranked as high as 35th nationally in 2007, finishing the season with a 23–9 record while making the National Invitational Tournament for the fourth time in the prior five years.\nOn February 22, 2018, Drexel came back from a 34 point deficit (trailing 53–19 at one point), coming back to defeat Delaware 85–83 to complete the largest comeback in Division I history.\nVenues.\nMain Building.\nBeginning in 1894, Drexel played their games and held all athletic activities in a gymnasium that was located in the 4th floor of the Main Building. This gymnasium was sometimes referenced as West Philadelphia College Court.\nCurtis Hall Gymnasium.\nIn 1929, Curtis Hall, an extension of Drexel Main Building, was completed and included a new gymnasium. The gymnasium was prioritized in construction to be completed 3 months before the rest of the building, in December 1928, in order to be completed prior to the start of the 1928–29 Drexel basketball season. The gym featured a full-sized basketball floor, and separate locker rooms for the home and visiting teams. This gym is known as Curtis Hall Gym, or Curtis Gym, and was also nicknamed \"The Band Box.\" During construction of Curtis Hall, an entrance was added on Chestnut Street to allow quicker access to the gym. The gymnasium had a seating capacity of 500. After moving home games to Sayre Junior High School, games were played in Curtis Hall again for one last season in 1953–1954, before they once again were relocated back to the high school.\nSayre Junior High School.\nAs the popularity of the basketball and other sports teams grew, Curtis Hall Gym became less suitable for hosting the games. During the 1951–52 season, Drexel decided to move 3 of its 4 remaining league games to Sayre Junior High School, located in West Philadelphia. Drexel also played 6 of its 9 home games at the high school in the following 1952–1953 season. A single home games were scheduled at Curtis Hall in the 1953–1954 season, however the remaining home games would be played at Sayre High School. From that point forward, Sayre Junior High School served the home court for Drexel through the 1968–1969 season.\nDrexel Armory.\nBeginning in the 1969–1970 basketball season, the Drexel home basketball games were moved to the 32nd Street Armory, also known as the Drexel Armory. Drexel first began holding various athletic and recreational activities in the armory in 1947, while the building was still state owned and used exclusively for National Guard and ROTC drills. While home games were moved out of the Armory after the 1974–1975 season, the armory was considered for renovation in the 2010s in order to make it suitable for hosting home basketball games. Instead, renovations were made at Daskalakis Athletic Center, allowing the DAC to continue to serve as the home court.\nDaskalakis Athletic Center.\nSince the 1975–1976 season, the Dragons' home games have been played at the Daskalakis Athletic Center, formerly known as the Physical Education and Athletic Center (PEAC). While it was considered to move the games back to the Armory at one point, Drexel instead decided to renovate the Athletic Center beginning in 2012 and keep the games there instead. Within the Daskalakis Athletic Center, games are played on Sam Cozen Court in the main gym.\nOther Venues.\nDrexel previously held a number of home games at other local venues in Philadelphia. In the 1952–53 season when 6 of Drexel's 9 home games were played at Sayre Junior High School, 2 home games were played at Philadelphia Convention Hall (as was one game the previous season), and the final game was played at St. Joseph's Field House. In the 1950s and 1960s a number of Drexel home games were also played in The Palestra.\nSince moving to the Armory in the 1969–1970 season, it has become rare for home games to be played at alternative venues. In the 1995–96 season, Drexel played their first game at the CoreStates Spectrum in Philadelphia against conference rival Delaware, however it was considered a neutral site game. In the 2015–16 season Drexel played what was considered a home game against Penn State at The Palestra, and also played a home game at The Palestra against Temple in the 2018–19 season. However, in many seasons, Drexel has played games at the Palestra that were considered a neutral game statistically, even while serving as a seldom used \"home\" court for the team's higher demand games. For example, on January 21, 1987, Drexel beat No. 18 ranked Navy at the Palestra, which was considered a neutral site (rather than an alternate home court) according to NCAA records. In the 1987–88 season, Drexel played 3 games at the Palestra that were considered at home. The designation of the Palestra being a neutral site or an alternate home court has varied over the years.\nPostseason results.\nNCAA Division I Tournament results.\nThe Dragons have appeared in the NCAA Division I tournament five times.

The players see the ruling as a significant step forward and plan to form an Ivy League Players Association. The NCAA and universities insist athletes are students, not employees, but the ruling could challenge this view. The case is significant amid ongoing legal challenges to the amateur athlete model. The ruling may lead to increased compensation and player involvement in decision-making.

Prior to joining the MAAC in 1997, Marist was a charter member of the ECAC Metro Conference in 1981; which became the Northeast Conference in 1988.\nHistory.\nThe Marist men's basketball team's first varsity season was 1961–62 at the NCAA Division III level. For 20 years Marist would play at this level. Their most successful season during this time was the 1970–71 season under head coach Ron Petro, in which they went 21–7. The Marist Athletic Department including the men's basketball program transitioned up to the Division I level before the 1981–82 season. In response to the competitive landscape the program encountered in Division I for basketball recruits Marist became one of the first college programs to recruit players from overseas. This strategy worked and Marist was able to attract very talented international players to Poughkeepsie. This led to unprecedented on the court success and national recognition for the school. The most successful Marist men's basketball teams played in the mid-1980s and were composed mostly of players from Europe and Canada. They were led by future first-round selection and NBA All-Star Rik Smits, who was originally from the Netherlands. Also on those teams was Rudy Bourgarel and Alain Forestier from France, Peter Krasovec from Hungary, Curtis Celestine from Canada and Serbian player Miroslav Pecarski. At the time, Pecarski was considered by some to be Europe's top 17-year-old player, but he was injured in the preseason, creating an opportunity for Smits.\nDuring the 1984–85 season, Marist hosted eventual national champion Villanova, losing 57–51. That same year Marist would earn its first ECAC Metro Conference regular season championship. That team was coached by Matthew Furjanic Jr., whose staff also included Jim Todd, who would go on to become head coach of the Los Angeles Clippers.\nIn 1986 and 1987 Marist won the ECAC Metro Conference tournament and advanced to play in the NCAA tournament. In the 1986 NCAA Tournament, Marist lost 68–53 against a Georgia Tech team which would send four members of its starting lineup to the NBA. The 1987 team was Dave Magarity’s first year as head coach of the Red Foxes. The team won 20 games for the first time in its Division I history and lost to University of Pittsburgh in the NCAA first round. Magarity’s staff included Jeff Bower, formerly the general manager and head coach of the NBA’s New Orleans Hornets.\nAfter graduating, Rik Smits was drafted #2 overall in the first round of the 1988 NBA draft, and become the first Marist player to play in the NBA. He would go on to have a long and successful career with the Indiana Pacers.\nMarist lost in the first round of the 1996 NIT to Rhode Island. The 1995–96 team was led by 6'11\" center Alan Tomidy, a native of Le Roy, New York and first team all New York Metropolitan, NEC and Haggerty Award Finalist, who averaged 18.8 pts and 11.3 rebounds per game. Other players of note were shooting forward Kareem Hill (13.7 pts and 8.7 rbs/game) and guard Danny Basile (15 pts/game), who combined for 55 points in that NIT loss. \nSince joining the MAAC in 1997, Marist has not won a conference tournament title nor qualified for an NCAA berth, although they won the MAAC regular season title twice (shared 2002, outright 2007). Not coincidentally, each of those teams possessed outstanding guard play; Sean Kennedy in 2002 and Jared Jordan in 2007.\nThe 2006–07 season featured point guard Jared Jordan, 7' center James Smith and shooting guard Will Whittington. Jordan led the nation in assists for the second straight year while Whittington, a three-point shooting specialist, contributed 17.6 pts/game. Whittington finished his Marist career with 362 three-pointers, and Jordan finished his career with 813 assists, both still program records.\nIn March, 2007, the men's basketball team defeated Oklahoma State in the first round of the NIT 67–64.\nOn June 28, 2007, Jared Jordan became the second Marist College basketball player to be selected in the NBA draft, as the 45th overall pick, 15th pick in the second round by the Los Angeles Clippers.\nTwo Marist players have won the Haggerty Award, Izett Buchanan in 1994 and Jared Jordan in 2007. The award is given annually to the Metropolitan area's top men's Division I basketball player.\nHead coaches.\nOn April 10, 2013, Jeff Bower was named the tenth Head Coach in Marist's Division I history replacing Chuck Martin who was fired on March 14.\nOne June 2, 2014, after leading Marist to a 12–19 record in one season, Bower resigned his position to become General Manager of the Detroit Pistons of the NBA. On June 17, 2014, Mike Maker was hired as the eleventh head coach. Maker was previously the head coach at Division III Williams College where over six seasons he led the Ephs to a 147–32 (.821) record and three Division III Final Fours, twice getting to the title game. However, Maker was fired on March 5, 2018, after winning 28 games over four seasons.\nOn April 3, 2018, John Dunne was hired as the 12th coach of Marist, being hired from MAAC rival Saint Peter's.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Red Foxes have appeared in two NCAA Tournaments.

        "text": "The NC State Wolfpack men's lacrosse team represented North Carolina State University in NCAA Division I men's lacrosse from 1973 to 1982 and currently represents the university in the Southeast Lacrosse Conference. The team was disbanded as a varsity sport after the 1982 season. The team currently competes in the Men's Collegiate Lacrosse Association Division I.\nHistory.\nThe first Wolfpack team, initially granted club status, was introduced in 1972 by Colonel Robert E. Conroy, a military science instructor. Conroy played college lacrosse at the University of Massachusetts Amherst from 1954 to 1956. The next year NC State approved varsity status, and began playing against a mix of club and varsity programs, ending with a record of 3–9. That year Colonel Conroy was transferred leaving a vacancy in the coaching position. His successor, Dr. Charles E. Patch, had never coached or seen a full game but did graduate from SUNY Cortland, one of the nation's premier lacrosse programs.\nWith a new coach and only 4 of the 19 team members having lacrosse experience, the team went 1–13. After records of 7–7 and 8–8 in 1975 and 1976 respectively, the program began to gain some measure of success. In 1977 the team vaulted into the limelight of Division I college lacrosse with the recruitment of three time first-team All-American Stan Cockerton, who still ranks second in all-time NCAA career goals. That year the Wolfpack finished 10–4 with a No. 14 national ranking. Success continued the next year as NC State defeated perennial powerhouses North Carolina and Virginia to end up with a 9–4 record and a No. 9 national ranking. After that year, Dr. Patch resigned to continue the growth of the program, and ex-Virginia assistant coach Larry Gross was hired to take over. The Wolfpack would follow with an 8–4 record, a No. 6 national ranking, and its first and only NCAA tournament appearance.\nThe tournament culminated in an early first round exit to eventual National Champion Johns Hopkins. In the next three years the team would go 6–5 in 1980, 7–4 and a No. 11 national rank in 1981, and finally 5–6 in the 1982 season. The team lost varsity status following 1982. Future national champion Tim Nelson was on the Wolfpack squad that final season, transferring to Syracuse where he led the team to a National Title in 1983.\nLacrosse was removed as a varsity sport due to several reasons as stated by the Athletic Department, including Title IX considerations. At the time of dropping the sport, there were no high school teams playing lacrosse in North Carolina and the recruiting would have to be done out of state. The only D1 programs in the state were UNC and Duke and the travel budget was very small. But the biggest factor in eliminating the sport was the lack of scholarships, without which the team could not competitively compete in the ACC. However Title IX compliance stands in the way of reinstating the program and the sport remains as a club team today playing in the Atlantic Lacrosse Conference of the MCLA. \nDue to the expansion of the game throughout the country, there has been much more attention placed into the eventual reestablishment of the program as a varsity-level sport. However, funds remain an issue. As stated by former NC State Athletic Director Debbie Yow, \"I have a personal appreciation for the sport of lacrosse. That said, I can not foresee a time when we would voluntarily add any sport. The current 23 varsity sports need and deserve our attention and financial support.\"\nSeason Results.\nThe following is a list of NC State's results by season as an NCAA Division I program:"

        "title": "2011 World Series",
        "text": "The 2011 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball's (MLB) 2011 season. The 107th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff played between the American League (AL) champion Texas Rangers and the National League (NL) champion St. Louis Cardinals; the Cardinals defeated the Rangers in seven games to win their 11th World Series championship and their second in six seasons.\nThe Series was noted for its back-and-forth Game 6, in which the Cardinals erased a two-run deficit in the bottom of the 9th inning, then did it again in the 10th. In both innings, the Rangers were one strike away from their first World Series championship. The Cardinals won the game in the 11th inning on a walk-off home run by David Freese, who was named World Series MVP. The Series was also known for the blowout Game 3, in which Cardinals player Albert Pujols hit three home runs, a World Series feat previously accomplished only by Reggie Jackson and Babe Ruth, and subsequently by Pablo Sandoval in 2012. In 2020, ESPN named the 2011 World Series the fifth greatest of all-time.\nThe Series began on October 19, earlier than the previous season, so that no games would be played in November. The Cardinals enjoyed home-field advantage for the series because the NL won the 2011 All-Star Game 5–1 on July 12. The 2011 World Series was the first World Series to go all seven games since the 2002 Series.\nBackground.\nThe Rangers were appearing in their second consecutive World Series; they lost the 2010 Series to the San Francisco Giants in five games. They were the first American League team to play in consecutive World Series since the New York Yankees did it from to . They earned their postseason berth by winning the American League West division, then defeated the Tampa Bay Rays in the American League Division Series and the Detroit Tigers in the American League Championship Series to earn their World Series berth.\nThe Cardinals were appearing in their 18th World Series, and third in eight years. They lost to the Boston Red Sox in , but won in against the Detroit Tigers. The Cardinals earned their postseason berth by winning the National League Wild Card on the last day of the regular season, then defeated the Philadelphia Phillies in the National League Division Series and the Milwaukee Brewers in the National League Championship Series to earn their World Series berth.\nThis Series was only the second time the Rangers and the Cardinals played each other; they met in regular-season interleague play in 2004, when the Cardinals won two of a three-game series in Texas. This was the first World Series assignment for umpires Greg Gibson and Ron Kulpa. Each of the other umpires had previously worked one World Series.\nThe Cardinals were supported by fans brandishing Rally Squirrel memorabilia that alluded to a squirrel that ran across the field during a playoff game.\nNational anthem singers featured\nGame one: Scotty McCreery,\nGame two: Trace Adkins,\nGame three: Ronnie Dunn,\nGame four: Zooey Deschanel,\nGame five: Demi Lovato,\nGame six: Joe, and\nGame seven: Chris Daughtry (from Daughtry)\nTexas Rangers.\nThis was the Rangers' second appearance in the World Series. Heading into 2010, their 50th season as a franchise (counting its time as the Washington Senators), the team was the only one in Major League Baseball never to win a postseason series, and was among three teams (along with the Seattle Mariners and the Washington Nationals) never to appear in the World Series. That season, however, the Rangers won their first postseason series and made their first appearance in the World Series, only to lose to the San Francisco Giants in five games.\nDuring the offseason, Chuck Greenberg, who purchased the Rangers from Tom Hicks during the 2010 season along with Nolan Ryan, sold his interest in the team to Ryan, making him the Rangers' principal owner. Notable player departures during the offseason included pitcher Cliff Lee and outfielder/designated hitter Vladimir Guerrero (both to free agency) and catcher Bengie Molina, who retired. Notable free agent additions during the offseason included pitchers Yoshinori Tateyama and Brandon Webb, catcher Yorvit Torrealba, and third-baseman Adrián Beltré. In January 2011, as part of a three-way trade with the Toronto Blue Jays and Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, the Rangers acquired catcher Mike Napoli in exchange for pitcher Frank Francisco. During the season, the team acquired pitcher Koji Uehara from the Baltimore Orioles in exchange for infielder Chris Davis, and Mike Adams from the San Diego Padres in exchange for two minor-league pitchers. Pitcher Arthur Rhodes was released and signed with the St. Louis Cardinals days later; as a result, Rhodes would have been entitled to receive a World Series ring regardless of which team won.\nWith the exception of one day in late April and a brief stretch in early May, the Rangers led the American League West for most of the season. They finished the season with a franchise record 96–66 ( winning percentage) and won their second consecutive and 5th overall division title, 10 games ahead of the second-place Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. They also set a franchise record for home attendance of 2,946,949. Texas also earned the most shutouts in the American League. All 5 members of the opening day starting rotation stayed in the rotation for the entire year. C. J. Wilson tied for the league lead in starts with 34 while Derek Holland tied for second in shutouts with 4 (tied for first in the American League), with each pitcher racking up at least 13 wins. The offense also had another good year with 3 players getting 30-plus home runs for the first time in team history, and Ian Kinsler completing his second 30–30 season.\nIn the postseason, the Rangers were the #2 seed in the AL. They defeated the wild-card Tampa Bay Rays in four games in the American League Division Series. They then defeated the third-seeded Detroit Tigers in six games in the American League Championship Series to reach their second consecutive appearance in the World Series.\nThe Rangers lost home-field advantage in the World Series as a result of the AL team, managed by Rangers manager Ron Washington, losing the 2011 All-Star Game, when Ranger ace C. J. Wilson surrendered the game-winning three-run homer to Prince Fielder.\nSt. Louis Cardinals.\nThe Cardinals made their first World Series appearance since , when they defeated the Detroit Tigers 4 games to 1 to win their National League-leading 10th World Series title. This was manager Tony La Russa's 6th World Series appearance as manager and his third with the Cardinals. The Cardinals' last postseason appearance was in 2009, where they were swept by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League Division Series. They finished the 2010 season with a record of 86–76 (), finishing in second place in the National League Central standings, 5 games behind the Cincinnati Reds.\nDuring the 2010 offseason, the team signed new contracts with manager Tony La Russa and picked up All-Star slugger Albert Pujols' club option. Notable offseason departures included shortstop Brendan Ryan (traded to the Seattle Mariners) and relief pitcher Blake Hawksworth (traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers). Additionally, during the offseason the team announced that ace pitcher Adam Wainwright would miss the entire season due to Tommy John surgery. Notable offseason additions included shortstop Ryan Theriot, outfielder Lance Berkman, catcher Gerald Laird, and infielder Nick Punto. In late April, after a number of blown saves, the Cardinals removed pitcher Ryan Franklin from the closer role, and released him on June 29. On July 27, the Cardinals sent outfielder Colby Rasmus and pitchers Trever Miller, Brian Tallet, and P. J. Walters to the Toronto Blue Jays in exchange for pitchers Edwin Jackson, Marc Rzepczynski, and Octavio Dotel, and outfielder Corey Patterson. They then acquired Rafael Furcal from the Dodgers in exchange for Alex Castellanos, a minor-league outfielder. On August 11, the team signed free agent pitcher Arthur Rhodes, who had been released by the Texas Rangers days earlier.\nThe Cardinals spent much of the early part of the 2011 season in first place in the NL Central standings but dropped to second place for good on July 27. On August 25, the team trailed the Atlanta Braves in the NL wild card standings by games. The Cardinals amassed a 21–9 record from August 26 to September 27, while the Braves were 10–19 over that same interval. Meanwhile, on September 23, the Milwaukee Brewers clinched the NL Central division title. On September 28, with the Cardinals and Braves tied atop the Wild Card standings on the last day of the regular season, the Cardinals routed the Houston Astros 8–0 in Houston, while the Braves lost at home to the Philadelphia Phillies 4–3 in 13 innings, securing the Cardinals' second wild card postseason berth in franchise history. St. Louis finished with a record of 90–72, 6 games behind the Brewers in the NL Central but one ahead of the Braves in the Wild Card. They defeated the overall #1 seed Philadelphia Phillies in the National League Division Series 3 games to 2, and then defeated the second-seeded Milwaukee Brewers (who were the first team in history to reach both NLCS and ALCS and the team the Cardinals faced in the 1982 World Series) in six games in the National League Championship Series.\nGame summaries.\nGame 1.\nAces were on the mound for Game 1 as C. J. Wilson faced Chris Carpenter. Both starters kept the game scoreless through the first three innings. In the fourth, Albert Pujols was hit by a pitch to lead off the inning. After a double by Matt Holliday, Lance Berkman hit a single to drive both runners in. The lead wouldn't last long. Mike Napoli hit a two-run home run to tie the game in the very next inning. David Freese doubled in the sixth with one out, and moved to third on a wild pitch. After Yadier Molina struck out, and Nick Punto walked, Allen Craig entered the game, pinch-hitting for Carpenter. Alexi Ogando relieved Wilson, and tried to finish off the inning. Craig hit a 1–2 pitch down the right field line that was just out of reach of a sliding Nelson Cruz. Freese scored to give St. Louis the lead. In the seventh, the Cardinals ran into trouble as Cruz singled and Napoli walked to put two on with one out. Marc Rzepczynski came on to face pinch-hitter Craig Gentry and struck him out. Pinch-hitter Esteban Germán was the next batter. Rzepczynski struck him out as well. In the ninth, closer Jason Motte pitched an easy 1–2–3 inning to give St. Louis the win. Controversy surrounded the inning, as Adrián Beltré was the victim of a blown call. Beltré grounded a ball to third, and Descalso threw the ball to first for the out, but replays showed he fouled the ball off his foot.\nGame 2.\nGame 2 saw a pitchers' duel between Jaime García and Colby Lewis. Both starters kept the game scoreless through the first six innings. A pair of excellent defensive plays by Elvis Andrus stopped a couple of Cardinals rallies. In the seventh, David Freese again started a rally for St. Louis, much like in Game 1. He singled with one out and moved to third on a single by Nick Punto with two outs. Allen Craig pinch-hit for García to face Alexi Ogando, setting up almost the same exact situation from the previous night. Again, Craig beat Ogando with a single to right field to drive in Freese. Jason Motte was brought in to save the game in the ninth. Ian Kinsler led off with a bloop single and stole second with Andrus batting. Andrus singled into center field and moved to second on the throw home, which got by Albert Pujols for an error. With runners on second and third, and none out, Tony La Russa switched in Arthur Rhodes for Motte. Consecutive sacrifice flies from Josh Hamilton and Michael Young gave Texas the lead. Neftalí Feliz came on in the ninth and allowed a leadoff walk to Yadier Molina, but he retired the next three batters in order to end the game and tie the Series at one game apiece.\nGame 3.\nAfter a total of just eight runs scored in the first two games in St. Louis, the offense of the two lineups scored a combined 23 runs on a historic night in Arlington in which Albert Pujols had what was described as \"the greatest individual hitting performance in World Series history\".\nAllen Craig hit a home run in the first to put the Cardinals up 1–0. In the fourth after a controversial call at first base by umpire Ron Kulpa on a force play and subsequent single put runners on first and second with one out, David Freese's RBI double made it 2–0 Cardinals. After an intentional walk loaded the bases, two runs scored on a throwing error by Mike Napoli before Ryan Theriot's RBI single made it 5–0 Cardinals. Starter Matt Harrison was pulled from the game after the inning's second out. In the bottom of the inning, a lead-off home run by Michael Young and, two batters later, a two-run home run by Nelson Cruz, made it 5–3 Cardinals. Napoli then singled to knock starter Kyle Lohse out of the game. Napoli moved to third on a groundout and single, but was tagged out at home trying to score on Ian Kinsler's fly out to end the inning.\nIn the fifth, the Cardinals loaded the bases with no outs on a single and two walks off of Scott Feldman before Freese's groundout scored a run, then a two-run double by Yadier Molina made the score 8–3 Cardinals. In the bottom of the inning, Texas got two leadoff singles off of Fernando Salas before Young drove in a run with a double. Lance Lynn relieved Salas and allowed an RBI single to Adrian Beltre, then, one out later, a sacrifice fly to Napoli to make it 8–6 Cardinals.\nAlbert Pujols, who had been hitless through the first two games, then hit a home run off Alexi Ogando in the sixth inning after a leadoff single and walk to make it 11–6 Cardinals. An error, single and walk loaded the bases before Mike Gonzalez relieved Ogando and allowed a sacrifice fly to Molina. Next inning, Pujols's two-run home run after a two-out walk off of Gonzalez made it 14–6 Cardinals. The Rangers scored their last run of the game in the bottom of the inning when Beltre hit a leadoff double off of Lynn, moved to third on a groundout and scored on Napoli's sacrifice fly off of Octavio Dotel.\nThe Cardinals added to their lead in the eighth when Freese singled with one out off of Mark Lowe and pinch-runner Daniel Descalso scored on Molina's double. Then in the ninth, Pujols hit his third home run of the game, giving him six RBIs, off of Darren Oliver. Mitchell Boggs retired Texas in order in the bottom of the ninth as the Cardinals won 16–7, leading the Series by 2–1.\nAlbert Pujols joined Babe Ruth (1926, 1928) and Reggie Jackson (1977) as the only players in baseball history up to that time to hit three home runs in a World Series game. (Pablo Sandoval would also accomplish the feat the following year.) Pujols was 5-for-6 with two singles, three HRs, four runs scored, and six RBIs. Yadier Molina added two doubles, driving in four runs. David Freese continued his postseason 13-game hitting streak getting two hits (one double), driving in two runs. Pujols became the first player in World Series history to get hits in four consecutive innings: fourth (single), fifth (single), sixth (HR, three RBIs), and seventh (HR, two RBIs). He tied records for most HRs (3), most hits (5), and most RBIs (6) in a World Series game, and established a new record with 14 total bases.\nThe 16 runs scored by the Cardinals were the most runs scored in a World Series game since 2002, when the San Francisco Giants scored 16 against the Anaheim Angels in Game 5.\nGame 4.\nAfter a high-scoring affair the night before, Derek Holland quieted the Cardinals' bats as he pitched innings of two-hit baseball. Lance Berkman had both of the Cardinals' two hits. Josh Hamilton's first-inning RBI double put the Rangers in front for only the second time in the Series. A three-run home run by Mike Napoli provided Holland a comfortable 4–0 lead. The Cardinals managed a small rally in the ninth, but were unable to score against closer Neftalí Feliz.\nCoincidentally, this game was one of two major DFW vs. St. Louis sporting events taking place in Arlington on that day, as the NFL's Dallas Cowboys and St. Louis Rams had played at nearby Cowboys Stadium that afternoon; during the opening coin toss, Berkman and Hamilton, in uniform, had each served as honorary captains for their city's team.\nGame 5.\nStarters C. J. Wilson and Chris Carpenter faced off again. Wilson walked two batters, Matt Holliday and Lance Berkman, in the second inning and both came in to score, aided in part by an error by David Murphy. However, despite the Rangers walking nine batters in the game (including Albert Pujols three times intentionally), the Cardinals did not score again, leaving 12 runners on base. Mitch Moreland hit a home run in the third, and Adrián Beltré hit one in the sixth, to tie the score at 2–2.\nThe Rangers' half of the eighth featured a series of bullpen mix-ups by the Cardinals, leaving Tony La Russa without closer Jason Motte in a crucial situation. After Michael Young led off the inning with a double, La Russa sent both Motte (a right-hander) and left-handed reliever Marc Rzepczynski to begin warmups. However, Cardinals bullpen coach Derek Lilliquist later stated that he only heard Rzepczynski's name called. When La Russa saw that Motte was not warming up, he made a second call to the bullpen, but this time Lilliquist thought he heard La Russa call for reliever Lance Lynn, who was supposedly unavailable for the game due to throwing 47 pitches in Game 3.\nDotel intentionally walked Nelson Cruz, whereupon La Russa summoned Rzepczynski to face the left-handed hitting Murphy. Usually, the Rangers would counter with a right-handed pinch-hitter, such as Craig Gentry or Yorvit Torrealba. However, Murphy stayed in the game, and hit a grounder off Rzepczynski, loading the bases. With Motte not yet available (La Russa thought he was warming up, but he was not yet ready), La Russa was forced to match Rzepczynski against the right-handed hitting Mike Napoli, who hit a two-run double scoring Young and Cruz. After a Moreland strikeout, La Russa called for Motte from the bullpen, only to be surprised to see Lynn coming out (it was then when he learned of the mix-ups). Lynn then was asked to intentionally walk Ian Kinsler, making him only the third pitcher in World Series history to make a relief appearance solely to serve an intentional walk.\nNeftalí Feliz came in to save the game in the ninth, his second save of the Series.\nGame 6.\nGame 6, moved from October 26 to 27 due to rain and because the stadium was not domed, was a rematch of Game 2's starters: Cardinals lefty Jaime García and Rangers starter Colby Lewis. Texas jumped on top immediately, with Josh Hamilton driving in Ian Kinsler in the top of the first. The Cardinals responded quickly with a two-run Lance Berkman home run in the bottom half. Kinsler tied the game in the top of the second with a ground-rule double, scoring Craig Gentry. García was pulled after only three innings (and 59 pitches) and replaced with Fernando Salas. Leading off the top of the fourth, Matt Holliday misplayed a Nelson Cruz pop fly, putting Cruz at second. Mike Napoli singled him home to once again give Texas the lead.\nThe Cardinals jumped right back in the game, taking advantage of a Michael Young error and scoring on a Yadier Molina groundout to knot the game at three. David Freese started off the top of the fifth by dropping a routine pop fly (the third consecutive half-inning to begin with an error), which immediately turned into the go-ahead run for Texas on Young's double. Colby Lewis was cruising for the Rangers until the bottom of the sixth. After an Albert Pujols strikeout, Berkman singled to third. Matt Holliday grounded into a possible double play which was mishandled at first by Michael Young (his second error of the game), leaving all runners safe. Lewis walked the bases loaded and was pulled for Alexi Ogando, who promptly walked Yadier Molina to force in a run. With the Cardinals in a prime position to rally ahead, Matt Holliday, standing away as the possible go-ahead run, was picked off at third by catcher Mike Napoli. Holliday injured his finger sliding in on the play and was forced to leave the game. After Ogando walked Nick Punto, Derek Holland came in to pitch and the Rangers were able to slip out of the inning with the score still tied.\nLance Lynn came on to pitch for the Cardinals in the top of the seventh and was promptly greeted with back-to-back home runs by Adrián Beltré and Nelson Cruz to put Texas up by two. Ian Kinsler added his second RBI later in the inning to make the score 7–4, Rangers. In the bottom of the eighth, Allen Craig (who entered the game as Holliday's replacement) hit a home run to pull the Cardinals within two. Rangers closer Neftalí Feliz entered in the bottom of the ninth to deliver the Rangers their first ever World Series Championship. After striking out Ryan Theriot, Feliz faced Albert Pujols. Facing possibly his last at-bat as a Cardinal, Pujols hit Feliz's first pitch into left field for a double. Feliz walked Lance Berkman to put the tying run on first, but got Craig to take a called third strike. The Rangers were one out away from their first-ever World Series championship title as David Freese stepped to the plate. Down to his last strike, Freese hit Feliz's pitch past a leaping Nelson Cruz off the right field wall for a triple, tying the game at seven. (To this day baseball fans debate whether or not Cruz should have been replaced by Endy Chavez and whether or not Cruz could have caught the ball, thereby winning the world series for Texas, had he positioned himself differently, timed his leap differently, or had a better read on the ball.)\nSent into extra innings, Jason Motte went out for his second inning of work. Elvis Andrus singled, then the Rangers' MVP candidate Josh Hamilton put Texas up again with a towering two-run home run. Down 9–7, and out of bench players, the Cardinals once again faced only three outs until elimination. Left-hander Darren Oliver came in to pitch for the Rangers. St. Louis players Daniel Descalso and Jon Jay hit back-to-back singles, and starting pitcher Kyle Lohse was called to bunt. Lohse's sacrifice bunt put the tying run in scoring position. With right-handers coming up, right-hander Scott Feldman replaced Oliver on the mound. Ryan Theriot's sacrifice groundout scored Descalso, cutting the Rangers' lead to 9–8, and following an intentional walk to Pujols, Berkman stepped up to the plate. Feldman got ahead on the count 1–2 on a foul ball. Berkman worked the count to 2–2, and the Rangers were once again one strike away from their first championship title. Berkman then smacked Feldman's next pitch into center field for a single, scoring Jay and tying the game once again. It was the first time in World Series history that a team came back from two different two-run deficits in the ninth inning or later in the same game. The Rangers failed to score in the top of the 11th, bringing David Freese to lead off the bottom of the inning. Freese hit Mark Lowe's 3–2 pitch into the grass of the center field batter's eye for a game-winning home run, forcing the World Series to a Game 7 for the first time since .\nOf the last 13 instances in which a Major League team won a Game 6 at home to force a Game 7 in the postseason, all but two went on to win Game 7. The exceptions were the New York Mets in the 2006 NLCS against, coincidentally, the Cardinals; and the Boston Red Sox in the 1975 World Series against the Cincinnati Reds.\nFreese's walk-off home run was the fourth that won in a Game 6 in World Series history.\nThe Cardinals set two World Series milestones in their Game 6 win—the first team to come back from deficits in both the 9th and 10th innings, and the first team to score in the 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th innings. On \"Mike and Mike in the Morning\" the next day, ESPN senior baseball analyst Buster Olney called it the greatest game in the history of baseball.\nGame 6 was originally scheduled for Wednesday, October 26, but was postponed due to heavy rain in the forecast; this was the first time that a World Series game was postponed since 2006. Although rain was only falling fairly lightly in St. Louis when this decision was made, MLB officials did not want a repeat of Game 5 of the 2008 World Series (which was suspended after the top of the sixth inning and resumed two days later).\nDavid Freese and Lance Berkman became the third and fourth players in World Series history to get game-tying hits with their team one out from elimination.\nFreese, who grew up a Cardinal fan in the suburbs of St. Louis, said that as he was circling the bases after his home run, he was thinking about a similar walk-off homer by Jim Edmonds for the Cardinals in Game 6 of the 2004 National League Championship Series in Busch Stadium II. After Freese said he remembered that home run, Lance Berkman, who played for the losing Houston Astros in that series, said \"So do I.\"\nGame 7.\nBefore Game 7, the Cardinals replaced Matt Holliday, who sprained his wrist in Game 6, on their roster with Adron Chambers.Josh Hamilton and Michael Young had RBI doubles in the first inning against Chris Carpenter, who became the first pitcher in a decade to make three starts in one Series thanks to the unnecessary postponement of Game 6 due to forecasted rain that did not occur. David Freese had a game-tying two-run double in the bottom of the first, breaking the postseason RBI record, and Allen Craig hit a go-ahead homer in the third. Craig even robbed a home run from Nelson Cruz in the sixth. St. Louis added two runs off Scott Feldman in the fifth inning without getting a hit. Yadier Molina walked with the bases loaded, C. J. Wilson came on to relieve Feldman and promptly hit Rafael Furcal with his first pitch, forcing in another run to make it 5–2. In the seventh inning, Lance Berkman scored on a Molina single to make it 6–2.Chris Carpenter was relieved after pitching six innings and was credited with the win. The Cardinals used four relievers to hold Texas scoreless over the final three innings. The final out was recorded when Jason Motte got David Murphy to fly out to Cardinal left fielder Allen Craig as Busch Stadium went into a frenzy.\nDavid Freese became the sixth player in history to earn League Championship Series and World Series MVP awards in the same postseason.\nThe Rangers set a Series record by issuing 41 walks, breaking the previous record held by the Florida Marlins when winning the 1997 World Series after issuing 40.The Cardinals became the first wild card team to win the World Series since the Boston Red Sox won the 2004 World Series (coincidentally, against the Cardinals).\nComposite Line Score.\n2011 World Series (4–3): St. Louis Cardinals (N.L.) over Texas Rangers (A.L.)\nBroadcasting.\nTelevision.\nThe series was televised in the United States and Canada by Fox. Joe Buck called play-by-play on his 14th World Series for the network, dating back to , while color analyst Tim McCarver handled his 22nd World Series since . Ken Rosenthal served as field reporter for the games, while Chris Rose hosted the pregame and postgame coverage with analysts A. J. Pierzynski and Eric Karros.\nJoe Buck's call of \"...we will see you tomorrow night!\" on David Freese's walk-off home run echoed his father Jack's call of Kirby Puckett's walk-off home run from Game 6 of the 1991 World Series, occurring 20 years and a day apart from each other, given the similar situations: Game 6, 11th inning, first batter of the final inning, and breaking a 3–3 tie to win the game 4–3, and extend the series to a 7th game.\nMLB International syndicated television coverage of the Series (with Gary Thorne and Rick Sutcliffe announcing) to viewers outside of North America.\nRatings.\nThe ratings started off poorly, averaging just 8.4 through its first 5 games (at this time, the record for lowest World Series rating was 8.4, set by five games of the 2008 World Series and five games of the 2010 World Series). Game 3 also produced a 6.6 rating, making it the second lowest World Series rated game of all-time (behind the 6.1 rating in Game 3 of the 2008 World Series and Game 3 of the 2012 World Series).\nHowever, Games 6 and 7 generated massive ratings that brought the overall average to 9.9. The 14.7 rating for Game 7 was at the time the network's highest for a World Series telecast since Game 4 of the 2004 World Series.\nRadio.\nESPN Radio also broadcast the games nationally. This was the first World Series for play-by play announcer Dan Shulman and analysts Orel Hershiser and Bobby Valentine. ESPN Deportes Radio aired the Series for Spanish language listeners, with Ernesto Jerez and Guillermo Celis announcing.\nLocally, the two teams' flagship stations broadcast the Series with their respective announcing crews. The Rangers' broadcasts aired on KESN (with Eric Nadel and Steve Busby announcing), while the Cardinals' broadcasts aired on KMOX (with Mike Shannon and John Rooney announcing). Due to contractual obligations, the non-flagship stations on the teams' radio networks carried the ESPN Radio broadcasts of the games, although the local broadcasts were available on XM Satellite Radio and to Gameday Audio subscribers at MLB.com.\nIn the United Kingdom, Simon Brotherton and Josh Chetwynd called the games for BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra.\nAftermath.\nThe 2011 World Series was only the second World Series ever in which a team, one strike away from elimination, came back to win—with the Cardinals, in fact, achieving this feat twice in Game 6. The first was the 1986 World Series, in which the New York Mets rallied from a 5–3 deficit in the bottom of the 10th inning of Game 6 to win the game and, later, the decisive Game 7.\nThis was the third and final World Series title for Cardinals manager Tony La Russa, who initially announced his retirement on October 31, 2011, after 33 seasons as a major league manager. La Russa later came out of retirement and served as manager of the Chicago White Sox in 2021 and 2022. La Russa had previously led the Cardinals () and Oakland Athletics () to World Series championships. Former Cardinals catcher Mike Matheny, who played for the Cardinals that lost the World Series, was hired to replace him.\nAfter the New York Giants won Super Bowl XLVI during the offseason, some news organizations, among them \"The St. Louis Post-Dispatch\", compared the Cardinals to the Giants, invoking Al Michaels's call of the Giants winning the Super Bowl: \"The New York Giants, given the last rites by many in December, are the Super Bowl Champs in February.\"\nThe Rangers became the first team to lose in the World Series in consecutive years since the Atlanta Braves in and and the first American League team to do so since the New York Yankees in and .\nAlbert Pujols and C. J. Wilson would later end up signing with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in the offseason, in one of the deepest free-agent classes in recent MLB history, while the Rangers obtained the rights to sign Japanese star pitcher Yu Darvish to replace Wilson. In his first press conference as a Ranger, Darvish was asked about Game 6 of the World Series where David Freese hit a walk-off home run in the bottom of the 11th, and said \"If it was last year [2011], I would have given up a home run and lost the game. This year [2012] I won't let that happen.\" Pujols returned to the Cardinals in 2022, which was the last season of his career.\nBoth teams would advance into the postseason again in the following year, both as wild cards. The Rangers lost to the Baltimore Orioles in the inaugural American League Wild Card game, and would not make the postseason again until 2015. The Cardinals won the inaugural National League Wild Card game against Atlanta. They then defeated the Washington Nationals in the NLDS before falling to the San Francisco Giants in the NLCS.\nSt. Louis would return to the World Series in , continuing the pattern of Giants and Cardinals exchanging pennant victories. However, the Cardinals lost to the Boston Red Sox in six games before losing to San Francisco again in the 2014 NLCS, 4 games to 1.\nLa Russa would be inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2014.\nThe Series marked the beginning of a decade in which all current Missouri-based teams in the four major American sports leagues would win a championship. The Kansas City Royals won the 2015 World Series, the St. Louis Blues won the 2019 Stanley Cup Finals, and the Kansas City Chiefs won Super Bowl LIV following the season.\n10 years after the 2011 World Series, Ron Washington would finally win a World Series ring after 44 years in MLB, as he served as the third base coach for the Atlanta Braves. In addition, four players from the 2011 Rangers' World Series team later won a world championship with the Boston Red Sox: Mike Napoli and Koji Uehara in , and Ian Kinsler and Mitch Moreland in .\nThe Rangers would return to the World Series again in 2023 where they would finally win it all as they defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks 4 games to 1 to clinch their first title in franchise history. Pitching coach Mike Maddux was on the coaching staff for all of Texas' World Series appearances, having served under Washington for the first two before he was rehired under Bruce Bochy during the third."

It began on 23 June with the round of 16 matches, and ended on 8 July with the final held at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, in which West Germany beat the defending champions Argentina 1–0 to claim their third World Cup.\nSixteen teams advanced to the knockout stage to compete in a single-elimination style tournament: The top two teams from each of the six groups, as well as the best four third-placed teams. In the round of 16, the four third-placed teams played against four of the group winners from group A-D, with the remaining two group winners from group E and F taking on two of the group runners-up; the remaining four runners-up were paired off against each other. The winners of the eight round of 16 matches were then paired together in the quarter-finals, the winners of which played against each other in the semi-finals.\nThe ties in each round were played over a single match; in the event that scores were level after 90 minutes, the teams would play an additional 30 minutes of extra time, divided into two 15-minute halves, to determine the winner. If the scores remained level after extra time, the teams would contest a penalty shootout.\nA third place match was also held on the day before the final, between the two losing teams of the semi-finals.\n\"All times listed are local (UTC+2)\"\nQualified teams.\nThe top two placed teams from each of the six groups, plus the four best-placed third teams, qualified for the knockout stage.\nBased on group results, the matches would be the following in Round of 16:\nThe pairings for matches 1, 4, 6 and 7 depend on who the best third places are that qualify for the round of 16.

Despite Cameroon's heroics earlier in the tournament, David Platt put England ahead in the 25th minute. At half-time, Cameroon brought Milla on, and the game was turned on its head in five second-half minutes. First Cameroon were awarded a penalty, from which Emmanuel Kunde scored the equaliser. Then, in the 65th minute, Eugene Ekeke put Cameroon ahead. The African team came within eight minutes of reaching the semi-finals, but then they conceded a penalty, which Gary Lineker gratefully converted. Midway through extra time, England were awarded another penalty, which Lineker again scored from the spot. England were through to the semi-finals for the first time in 24 years.\nYet England had grossly underestimated Cameroon's threat, despite the Indomitable Lions defeating then World Champions Argentina in the tournament's opening game and easily seeing off a highly fancied Colombia in the Round of 16. Howard Wilkinson was observing Cameroon's progress for England and informed the players that this quarter-final match represented \"A practical bye to the semi-finals\". Chris Waddle, emerging afterwards, was reported to have told Wilkinson: \"Some fucking bye that\".

        "title": "History of rugby union matches between Munster and New Zealand",
        "text": "Munster Rugby has a strong tradition of competitiveness against touring rugby teams. They have played the All Blacks, the national team of New Zealand, 8 times since 1905. In 1978, they became the first Irish team, including the Irish national team, to win a match in the history of competition between the countries, and remained the only Irish team to beat the All Blacks until the Irish national team defeated New Zealand in November 2016.\nHistory of matches between Munster and New Zealand.\n1905.\nThe 1905 Original All Blacks were the first New Zealand national rugby union team to tour outside Australasia. Captained by Irish born Dave Gallaher, they toured the British Isles, France, Ireland and the United States during 1905–06 and became known as \"The Originals\". Their match with Munster was played at Markets Field in Limerick on Tuesday 28 November and the touring side defeated Munster 33–0. The eight tries witnessed by the 3,000 strong crowd included a penalty try after Fred Roberts was tripped close to the line. Munster were captained by Basil Maclear.\n1954.\nBetween 1953 and 1954, New Zealand toured the British Isles, France and North America. They played Munster at the Mardyke in Cork, winning 6 - 3 on 13 January 1954 in front of a crowd of 7000 in cold and snowy conditions.\n1963.\nIn 1963, the All Blacks toured the British Isles, France and Canada. On 11 December that year, they beat Munster again by 6 - 3. The game was played at Thomond Park in Limerick in wet and windy conditions. New Zealand were captained by Ian Clarke.\n1973.\nIn 1972 and 1973 New Zealand toured Britain, Ireland, France and North America. Munster drew 3-3 with them in Musgrave Park in Cork, on 16 January with the All Blacks only securing the draw with a penalty in the last minute of the game. New Zealand were captained by Alex Wyllie.\n1974.\nIn 1974 Munster played New Zealand in their tour of the British Isles with New Zealand winning 14 - 4 at Thomond Park, on 9 November in front of a crowd of 10800. New Zealand were captained by Andy Leslie.\n1978.\nIn 1978, New Zealand toured the northern hemisphere. In a highly successful tour the All Blacks won every match they played, bar one: the fixture against Munster.\nMunster became the first Irish team to beat the All Blacks. The 12–0 victory took place on Tuesday 31 October 1978 at Thomond Park, in front of a crowd of 12,000. Munster were coached by former Ireland and British and Irish Lions captain Tom Kiernan. Kiernan, who had played in the 1963 and 1973 games against the All Blacks targeted the match. He ensured that Munster were physically fit and as part of his preparation, Munster undertook a two-match tour to London playing Middlesex and the Exiles, a team mainly made up of London Irish players.\nAlthough Munster were not expected to win, Christy Cantillon scored a try with Tony Ward converting. Ward also adding a dropped goal in each half. New Zealand were held scoreless with New Zealand wing Stu Wilson remarking afterwards that \"We were lucky to get nil\". Wilson likened the match to playing on front of a crowd of 100,000, such was the noise. Graham Mourie was the captain of the New Zealand team and Donal Canniffe captained Munster.\n1989.\nMunster played New Zealand who were reigning Rugby World Cup champions, having won the inaugural competition in 1987, in their 1989 tour at Musgrave Park, Cork, on 11 November 1989, losing 9 - 31. The match had an attendance of 18,000 with Buck Shelford captaining the visitors.\n2008.\nThe All Blacks returned to Thomond Park on 18 November 2008, to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the 1978 game and to celebrate the opening of the new stadium. Four of the 1978 team, Graham Mourie, Bryan Williams, Mark Donaldson and Gary Knight were in the crowd for the occasion. Prior to kick off, Munster's four New Zealand players, Rua Tipoki, Doug Howlett, Lifeimi Mafi and Jeremy Manning, challenged the All Blacks by performing the Haka first. Munster were without 10 of their squad who were on international duty and New Zealand chose to play an understrength team, resting key players for the forthcoming match against Ireland a few days later.\nMunster almost repeated history, leading 16-10 at half time and after 76 minutes of the match were winning 16-13. The Munster try, scored by Barry Murphy in the first half, was the only one scored against New Zealand during their European leg of the 2008 end of year rugby tests. A late try by Joe Rokocoko secured a win for the All Blacks with a final score 18-16.\nMedia reporting towards the match was extremely positive, commending the atmosphere, and the physical intensity of the Munster players. New Zealand coach Graham Henry said that the experience would help the development of many of the All Blacks who were young and inexperienced and might not have felt the sort of heat Munster and their crowd were able to generate.\n2016: Māori All Blacks.\nMunster hosted the Māori All Blacks in a capped friendly in Thomond Park on 11 November 2016. Before kick-off, the Māori All Blacks captain, Ash Dixon, led a tribute to Munster's late head coach Anthony Foley by placing an All Blacks jersey with Foley's initials on the halfway line, before performing the haka and presenting the jersey to Foley's two sons.\nIn heavy rain, Munster began the match well, with Niall Scannell scoring the provinces first try in the 13th minute. However, the Māori All Blacks hit back with two tries in the space of two minutes, firstly from James Lowe in the 23rd minute and then from Ambrose Curtis in the 25th, with Otere Black converting both to give the Māori a 14–5 lead. Munster were awarded a penalty try in the 30th minute after Rory Scannell was tackled without the ball on the Māori try line, for which Reed Prinsep was sin-binned. Ian Keatley converted the try. 7 minutes later, Darren Sweetnam hacked the ball out of his own half and, displaying excellent ball control, kicked the ball into the Māori in-goal area to score a try. A failed conversion gave Munster a 17–14 half-time lead.\nThe home side scored first in the second-half, with Ian Keatley kicking a 43rd-minute penalty to extend Munster's lead. Despite Duncan Williams being shown a yellow card for a high tackle in the 45th minute, the Munster defence remained resolute and they maintained their assault on Māori territory, having a try ruled out by the TMO, before Ronan O'Mahony scored a try in the 67th minute, converted by Keatley, to give Munster a 27–14 lead heading into the final 10 minutes of the game, a lead they never relinquished, despite the Māori All Blacks fighting until the final whistle. Many of the crowd stayed after the end of the game, as both teams completed laps of honour after the memorable meeting of the two sides.\nNew Zealanders Rhys Marshall and Te Aihe Toma were in the Munster team, whilst John Foley and Seán O'Connor made their Munster debuts as replacements during the game. O'Connor had tasted victory against a New Zealand team before, having been part of the Ireland Under-20s team that beat New Zealand Under-20s at the 2016 World Rugby Under 20 Championship. Tommy O'Donnell captained Munster for the first time, and Robin Copeland won the Man-of-the-Match award.\nBook, Play and Documentary on the 1978 game.\nA stage play named \"Alone it Stands\" by John Breen and a book named \"Stand Up and Fight: When Munster Beat the All Blacks\" by Alan English were both based on the events. Both have been commercially successful. \"Alone it Stands\" has had several sell-out runs in Ireland and has played in the Sydney Opera House and in Auckland. \"Stand Up and Fight\" was a bestseller in 2005.\nSetanta Sports also produced a documentary called \"Alone It Stands\": the documentary with excerpts from the play intercut with the first hand testimonies of the 1978 players.\nBefore the 2008 match, the All Blacks attended a production of the play to understand what the game meant to Munster supporters.\nMunster players from New Zealand.\nA number of players from New Zealand have been involved with Munster over the years:"

        "text": "Russia announced its intent to bid for the FIFA World Cup in early 2009, and submitted its request to FIFA in time. Russia's President Vladimir Putin has taken a keen interest in the bid and has gone so far as ordering Vitaly Mutko, the Minister of Sports, to \"prepare a bid for Russia to hold the 2018 World Cup\". According to a report earlier submitted by Vitaly Mutko, who also served that time as President of the Russian Football Union (RFU), the country is ready to spend some $10 billion on the tournament. The bid committee also includes RFU CEO Alexey Sorokin and Alexander Djordjadze as the Director of Bid Planning and Operations. In October 2010, Russia formally pulled out of the race to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup. On December 2, 2010, Russia was chosen as the host country for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\nFourteen cities are included in the current proposal, which divides them into 6 different clusters: one in the north, centered on St. Petersburg, a central cluster, centered on Moscow, a southern cluster, centered on Sochi, and the Volga River cluster. Only one city beyond the Ural Mountains is cited, Yekaterinburg. The other cities are: Kaliningrad in the north cluster, Rostov-on-Don and Krasnodar in the south cluster and Yaroslavl, Nizhny Novgorod, Kazan, Saransk, Samara and Volgograd in the Volga River cluster. The country does not currently have a stadium with 80,000 capacity, but the bid calls for the expansion of Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, already a UEFA Elite stadium with a capacity of slightly over 78,000, to over 89,000 seats. Russia hopes to have five stadiums fit to host World Cup matches ready by 2013 — two in Moscow and one stadium each in St. Petersburg, Kazan and Sochi, which hosted the 2014 Winter Olympics.\nIn October 2011, Russia decreased the number of stadiums from 16 to 14. Construction of a proposed stadium in the Moscow region, Podolsk, was cancelled by the regional government, and Spartak Stadium is competing with Dinamo Stadium which will have been constructed first."

        "text": "Buenos Aires Cricket &amp; Rugby Club, sometimes known simply as Buenos Aires, is an Argentine sports club based in San Fernando, Buenos Aires. Having set its official date of foundation on 8 December 1864, the club claims to be the oldest club still in existence in Argentina, according to reports of a cricket match played by the club in Recoleta, Buenos Aires, in 1831.\nA highlight of club's history was in 1951 when the Buenos Aires FC (established in 1886 as a rugby union club and founder member of the \"River Plate Rugby Championship\" (now the Argentine Rugby Union) merged to BACC, renaming \"Buenos Aires Cricket &amp; Rugby Club\". Since then, rugby union has been the main sport of the institution.\nRugby's senior squad participates in Top 12, the highest division of the URBA league system. The club also has a women's field hockey team that plays in the Torneo Metropolitano B (Second Division), organised by the Buenos Aires Hockey Association (AHBA), while the cricket squad competes in the Argentine Cricket Association tournaments.\nOther sports played at BACRC are football and golf.\nHistory.\nCricket origins.\nThe exact date of establishment of the \"Buenos Aires Cricket Club\" is not clear because of the fire that destroyed most of the club's facilities and its archives. Nevertheless, there are records of a cricket match played by members of the club in the Recoleta district of Buenos Aires in 1831, where a flag with the legend \"Buenos Aires Cricket Club\" was displayed. That match was covered by English language newspaper \"The British Packet\", published in Buenos Aires.\nThe first president of the club was British consul Frank Parish, named in 1858. In April, 1868, BACC played its first club match facing Montevideo Cricket Club (MVCC) in the city of Montevideo. BACC won by 156–124. The rematch was played in Buenos Aires in 1869, where BACC defeated Montevideo again by 174–121.\nOn 8 December 1864, the club officially inaugurated its game field in Parque Tres de Febrero of Palermo, Buenos Aires, where the Galileo Galilei planetarium is placed nowadays. That day BACC defeated team by 85 runs to 31, just 6 days before that ship would be destroyed in a fire on the River Plate, in a freak target practice accident.\nIn 1877 the BACC played its first match against Rosario Cricket Club.\nFootball and rugby pioneers.\nOn 26 June 1867, several members of the club met on the Buenos Aires Cricket Club's field in Palermo, Buenos Aires to play what would be the first game of football ever played in Argentina. The game, had originally planned to be played in La Boca but had to be moved due to floods.\nThe game was such a success that some members would go on to found the Buenos Aires Football Club, which would be the first football club in South America. For years to come both clubs would share facilities and members with the BACC playing cricket in the summer and BAFC playing football in the winter.\nRugby union rules were first adopted by Buenos Aires FC in 1874 but the club was dissolved one year later.\nIn 1886, a new a new \"Buenos Aires Football Club\" was founded as a rugby union club exclusively. The club played against Rosario AC, being the first time two different clubs ever met for an interprovincial rugby game in the country.\nIn 1899, along with Rosario AC, Belgrano AC and Lomas, Buenos Aires FC became a founding member of \"The River Plate Rugby Championship\", which would later become today's Argentine Rugby Union.\nThe first Unión de Rugby de Buenos Aires championship was created the same year. Buenos Aires won eight of the first 17 editions of this tournament. During the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s, the club did not win any title, encountering strong resistance from younger clubs, such as CA San Isidro and San Isidro Club, which have won most of the URBA titles to date.\nA new foundation.\nIn 1948, the facilities of the BACC were destroyed by the fire (some sources affirm it was intentional although those versions could never be confirmed). The fire destroyed most of the archives and documents of the club. Three years later, on 4 May 1951, both the BACC and BAFC decided to merge, under the name \"Buenos Aires Cricket &amp; Rugby Club\". The recently created club did not have definitive location until 1952, when it moved to the Don Torcuato district, where Buenos Aires CRC established its headquarters. The club stayed there until 1987, when the lands were sold to Hindú Club. That same year, Buenos Aires moved to San Fernando, Buenos Aires, where it has remained up to the present day.\nIn 1997, BACRC inaugurated the first purpose-built rugby union stadium in Argentina, erected in Los Polvorines, Greater Buenos Aires. A total of nine international games were played there by the Argentina national team. In 2005, the land where the stadium had been built was sold to a Germany-based company.\nField hockey.\nThe \"Surí Hockey Club\" was established as a women's field hockey club by a group of former students of the Northlands and St. Hilda's schools. In 1945, Surí (\"rhea\" in the Quechua languages) began to play in tournaments organized by field hockey association, starting in the third division. After many years playing its home games at different venues, due to Surí not having a stadium, the team finally joined BACRC in 1966, changing its name to Buenos Aires.\nBuenos Aires and its predecessor Surí have been successful teams in Argentine hockey, winning a total of seven Metropolitano championships between 1962 and 1988, two by Surí and five by BACRC.\nIn 2007, the club inaugurated its synthetic grass hockey field in San Fernando. The women's field hockey team has played its home games there since then."

They founded the \"Jugoslavija\" club in Belgrade and the \"Beli orao\" club in Sabac, but by 1923 rugby activities had ceased due to a lack of pitches.\nRugby was re-introduced in 1953 when Dragan Marsicevic, the secretary of the Yugoslavian Sport Association, accepted an offer from the French Rugby Federation to send two teams to Serbia to play a series of four matches to stimulate interest. The first match between the French Universities team and a French Provincial Selection was played in Belgrade on 26 November 1953.\nPartizan was the first new rugby club in Yugoslavia, founded on November 1, 1953. A few months later rugby club Radnicki was founded too. The first match between Partizan and Radnicki was played in Paracin on 26 April 1954, with Partizan winning 21–11. The return match played in Belgrade on 1 May 1954 was also won by Partizan, 16–14. \nThe Rugby Championship of Yugoslavia ran from 1957–1991.

The race was won by War Emblem who led from start to finish.\nRace description.\nThe field was considered evenly matched, especially after the scratch of Buddha, who had won the Wood Memorial. The favorite was Harlan's Holiday, who had won both the Florida Derby and Blue Grass Stakes. He went off at odds of 6–1, then the longest starting price for a favorite in Derby history. Medaglia d'Oro and Saarland, who had finished second and fourth in the Wood Memorial respectively, went off at odds of 7–1.\nWar Emblem was a relative longshot at odds of 20–1, despite having won the Illinois Derby in frontrunning fashion on April 6. Shortly after that race, he was purchased by The Thoroughbred Corporation (owned by Saudi Prince Ahmed Salman) and was put into training with Bob Baffert. Baffert trained the colt aggressively to build up his stamina, and quipped, \"If this horse wins the Derby, it will be the best and shortest training job ever.\"\nAs expected, War Emblem went to the early lead, running the first quarter-mile in 23.25 seconds and the half in :47.04. Jockey Victor Espinoza was then able to slow down the pace slightly as the colt maintained a lead of lengths down the backstretch and around the final turn. In the final furlong, War Emblem opened up his lead to four lengths under a hand ride. Espinoza said that he knew no one could catch them as the colt had been moving so easily. He completed the miles in 2:01.13, then the seventh fastest Derby in history. Another longshot, Proud Citizen, finished second, resulting in an exacta payout of $1,300.80 for a $2 bet.\nResults.\nScratched: Buddha, Danthebluegrassman\nSource: Equibase Chart\nSubsequent racing careers.\nSeveral horses went on to record Grade I wins:\nSubsequent breeding careers.\nMedaglia d'Oro\nHarlan's Holiday\nJohannesburg\nEssence of Dubai\nSources: American Classic Pedigrees, Equibase, Blood-Horse Stallion Register, Racing Post"

        "text": "The knockout stage of the 2010 FIFA World Cup was the second and final stage of the World Cup, following the group stage. It began on 26 June with the round of 16 matches, and ended on 11 July with the final match of the tournament held at Soccer City, Johannesburg, in which Spain beat the Netherlands 1–0 after extra time to claim their first World Cup. The top two teams from each group (16 in total) advanced to the knockout stage to compete in a single-elimination style tournament. A third place match was included and played between the two losing teams of the semi-finals.\nIn the knockout stage (including the final), if a match was level at the end of 90 minutes, two periods of extra time (15 minutes each) would be played. If the score was still level after extra time, the match would be decided by a penalty shoot-out.\n\"All times listed are South African Standard Time ()\"\nQualified teams.\nThe top two placed teams from each of the eight groups qualified for the knockout stage.\nRound of 16.\nUruguay vs South Korea.\nUruguay vs South Korea was the first match in the Round of 16. The match was held at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth before a low crowd of 30,597. Uruguay won the match 2–1. Uruguay's two goals came from Luis Suárez, the second of which broke a 1–1 deadlock in the 80th minute. Suárez's first was scored when Diego Forlán made a low cross from the left that was not dealt with by the Korean defence, leaving Suárez to score at the back post. Uruguay subsequently adopted a defensive posture and Korea had more chances to score. Eventually, Lee Chung-yong equalised in the 68th minute, scoring a headed goal following a free kick. Despite Korea then having chances to win the match, it was Suárez who scored Uruguay's winner in the 80th minute with a curling strike from the edge of the 18-yard box that went in off the inside of the post. Suarez's goal was regarded as one of the tournament's best. Korea missed more good chances in the final minutes of the game, giving Uruguay victory and passage to the quarter-finals for the first time since 1970, where they would face Ghana. After the match, the Uruguayan coach Óscar Tabárez attributed his team's successful run to the number of players with experience at top-level overseas clubs. Korean coach Huh Jung-moo claimed his side \"controlled\" the match and that Uruguay's goals were \"lucky\".\nUnited States vs Ghana.\nThe match between the United States and Ghana was played on 26 June 2010 at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium in Rustenburg. The match was watched by 19 million Americans, making it the most watched association football match in American television history. The match was won by Ghana in extra time after Asamoah Gyan broke a 1–1 deadlock. Kevin-Prince Boateng scored the opening goal of the match for Ghana in the fifth minute. The goal followed an error by Ricardo Clark, who lost the ball to the Ghanaians in midfield. Boateng took the ball to the edge of the penalty area, beating United States goalkeeper Tim Howard with a low left-footed shot. Landon Donovan equalised with a penalty kick in the 62nd minute, which was awarded after Jonathan Mensah fouled Clint Dempsey. The United States had chances to win the game thereafter but were unable to get past Ghana goalkeeper Richard Kingson. The match thus went to extra time. In the third minute, Gyan latched onto a high long ball, chesting it down and holding off two defenders before scoring the winner. After the match, Ghana's coach Milovan Rajevac hailed his side's achievement in becoming one of the \"best eight teams in the world\", but regretted the number of players that would miss the quarter-final match against Uruguay because of injury or suspension. The president of the United States Soccer Federation, Sunil Gulati, lamented the team's failure to make the quarter-finals and thereby further raise the profile of the sport in the United States.\nGermany vs England.\nGermany and England played each other on 27 June 2010 at the Free State Stadium in Bloemfontein. Germany took the lead in the 20th minute after English defenders Matthew Upson and John Terry were at fault in allowing Miroslav Klose to latch on to a long goal kick from Manuel Neuer and score. Lukas Podolski doubled Germany's lead 12 minutes later, although England pulled one goal back through Upson in the 37th minute, heading in a cross from Steven Gerrard. A controversial moment then occurred in the 39th minute: a shot by Frank Lampard was not awarded as a goal despite the ball bouncing off the crossbar and clearly crossing the line by at least a foot. Had the goal been awarded, England would have equalised at 2–2. Thomas Müller subsequently scored two goals in the second half, extending Germany's lead to 4–1. His first came at the end of a swift German counter-attack in the 67th minute, the goal being assisted by Bastian Schweinsteiger. His second came from an error by Gareth Barry and was set up by Mesut Özil. Germany won the match, 4–1. Germany progressed to meet Argentina in the quarter-final.\nThe ghost goal incident in this match was a major factor in the FIFA and IFAB decision to test and later implement new rules allowing goal-line technology to be used in football.\nArgentina vs Mexico.\nArgentina and Mexico met on 27 June 2010 at Soccer City in Johannesburg. Argentina won the match 3–1 for a place in the quarter-finals against Germany. The match was overshadowed by a refereeing error that allowed Argentina's opening goal. Carlos Tevez headed the ball into the net from a Lionel Messi pass in the 25th minute, but replays showed there were no players between Tevez and the goal, rendering his goal clearly offside. Replays of the goal were shown in the stadium but the decision to award the goal was not overturned. Tevez said he knew that the goal was offside, but chose not to say anything. Argentina's second goal came from a defensive error from Ricardo Osorio as a poor pass out of defence was snatched by Gonzalo Higuaín to round the keeper and score. After half-time, Tevez scored his second goal of the match to give Argentina a three-goal lead, with a long range shot that found the top corner of the Mexican goal. Javier Hernández scored for Mexico in the 71st minute but it turned out to be no more than a consolation goal, as Argentina held on to win 3–1. Mexico's coach Javier Aguirre resigned after the match, accepting responsibility for not meeting the team's target of the quarter-finals. Tevez conceded that he was aware his first goal was offside at the time, although Aguirre deflected the blame for his side's loss away from the refereeing.\nNetherlands vs Slovakia.\nThe Netherlands defeated Slovakia 2–1 on 28 June 2010 at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban. The Netherlands' first goal was an excellent individual effort from Arjen Robben in the 18th minute, taking on the Slovak defence with the ball before scoring from 25 yards. The Dutch had chances to extend their lead in the second half, with the most prominent coming when Robben cut inside on his left foot just like he did when he scored the first goal, but this time, Slovak goalkeeper Ján Mucha saved the shot going to his far post. The Slovaks also had two big opportunities to equalise but forced a save from Maarten Stekelenburg each time. The Dutch sealed their win in the 84th minute when Wesley Sneijder scored off an assist from Dirk Kuyt into an unguarded net after Kuyt got the ball past Mucha. Róbert Vittek slotted a penalty kick late in stoppage time, but it was no more than a consolation goal for Slovakia. The penalty had been awarded for a trip on him by Stekelenburg. The Netherlands' win threatened to be overshadowed by Robin van Persie responding angrily to being substituted by coach Bert van Marwijk. Van Marwijk called a team meeting over the incident and later insisted that there was no residual unrest in the squad.\nBrazil vs Chile.\nBrazil soundly defeated Chile 3–0 on 28 June 2010 at Ellis Park Stadium, Johannesburg to progress to a quarter-final match against the Netherlands. Brazil's first goal came from a corner kick taken by Maicon in the 34th minute, with Juan heading the ball into the goal without being marked. Brazil had doubled its lead within five minutes after a free-flowing passing movement involving Robinho and Kaká that teed up Luís Fabiano to score after taking the ball around the Chilean goalkeeper. Robinho himself sealed victory for Brazil in the second half, scoring following a long run with the ball by Ramires. After the match, Chile's coach Marcelo Bielsa conceded that his team had been outplayed, arguing that in his position there was \"little one can do\" when up against a team of Brazil's quality.\nParaguay vs Japan.\nParaguay and Japan met at the Loftus Versfeld Stadium in Pretoria on 29 June 2010. The match was decided by a penalty shootout after the score was locked at 0–0 for 120 minutes. Paraguay won the shootout and progressed to their first ever World Cup quarter-final. The match was a generally unexciting affair, as Japan adopted a defensive posture while Paraguay itself maintained a solid defence. The first half produced the occasional chance on goal with Lucas Barrios having a shot saved shortly before a long-distance shot from Daisuke Matsui hit the crossbar of Paraguay's goal. The second half was similar, with either side producing occasional chances to score rather than periods of dominance. The result of the deadlock was extra time, which continued goalless. A penalty shootout ensued, in which Yuichi Komano missed a spot kick for Japan. Paraguay scored all five of its penalties, clinching the win and passage to the quarter-finals. After the match, Japan's coach Takeshi Okada resigned and Shunsuke Nakamura retired from international football.\nSpain vs Portugal.\nSpain defeated Portugal 1–0 in the Iberian derby to progress to the quarter-finals where they were to play Paraguay. The match took place on 29 June 2010 at the Cape Town Stadium. Spain dominated their neighbours with a ball possession ratio of 62% and several opportunities but had to endure a pair of missed chances by the Portuguese in the first half, including one by Hugo Almeida which nearly resulted in a goal. In the second half, the Portuguese attacking threat decreased and the entry of Fernando Llorente for Fernando Torres brought new energy to the Spanish team. The only goal of the match came in the 63rd minute: David Villa picked up a brilliant pass by Xavi, having his first shot saved, but then lifted the rebound into the roof of the net. Post-match replays showed that the goal was scored from an offside position ( according to ESPN axis).\nQuarter-finals.\nNetherlands vs Brazil.\nThe Netherlands versus Brazil was the first quarter-final match, held on 2 July 2010 at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth. The Netherlands won 2–1 after recovering from a 1–0 deficit, knocking the five-time world champions Brazil out of the tournament. The Netherlands' team was affected by an injury to Joris Mathijsen before the match. His replacement in defence – André Ooijer – and fellow central defender John Heitinga were at fault for Brazil's opening goal in the 10th minute, when Robinho was allowed to latch onto a deep pass from Felipe Melo and score without being challenged by the defence. For the rest of the first half, the Dutch were largely frustrated by the Brazilian defence, and needed to rely on Maarten Stekelenburg's goalkeeping to prevent Brazil from extending its lead. However, eight minutes after half-time, the Dutch equalised through a goal from Sneijder. The goal was initially recorded as an own goal by Felipe Melo, but FIFA overturned the decision to credit the goal to Sneijder. Having equalised, the Netherlands subsequently took the lead from a Robben corner kick in the 68th minute, Sneijder heading the ball in after a flick-on from Kuyt. Brazil's chances of restoring parity were damaged when Felipe Melo was sent off for a stamp on Robben. The Netherlands held out for the win, thereby earning passage to the semi-finals. Brazil's coach Dunga confirmed after the match that he would be leaving the position upon the expiry of his contract, admitting responsibility for Brazil's defeat. The Dutch coach Bert van Marwijk attacked the Brazilian team after the match, claiming they had provoked his side, and that Melo's stamp on Robben left him \"ashamed for Brazilian football.\"\nUruguay vs Ghana.\nUruguay and Ghana met on 2 July 2010 at Soccer City, Johannesburg for a place in the semi-final against the Netherlands. It was the first time that the teams had ever played each other in a senior competitive football match. After a dramatic 120 minutes of play (including extra time) that finished 1–1, Uruguay won in a penalty shoot-out 4–2. Uruguay dominated the early periods of the match, but suffered an injury to captain Diego Lugano in the first half. Just before half-time, Ghana took the lead when Sulley Muntari was allowed time on the ball by Uruguay, and took advantage by scoring with a shot from 40 yards. After half-time, Diego Forlán pulled Uruguay level with a free kick from the left side of the field that went over the head of Ghana's goalkeeper Richard Kingson. While both teams had chances to win, the match proceeded to extra time as the scores remained level. Late in extra time, Ghana sent a free kick into the penalty area; Luis Suárez blocked Stephen Appiah's shot on the goal line. On the rebound, Dominic Adiyiah's header was heading into the goal, but Suárez blatantly blocked the shot with his hand to save what would have been the extra-time winner and he was red carded. Asamoah Gyan missed the ensuing penalty kick off the crossbar and Suárez celebrated the miss. In the shootout, Gyan converted his penalty, as did everybody else until Uruguay goalkeeper Fernando Muslera saved captain John Mensah's penalty (Ghana's third). Uruguay's Maxi Pereira then hit his penalty over the bar, but then Adiyiah's penalty was saved by Muslera. Sebastián Abreu converted Uruguay's fifth spot kick by lightly chipping it Panenka-style to win the match.\nAfter the game, Suárez said, \"I made the save of the tournament,\" and, referring to the infamous handball goal scored by Diego Maradona in the 1986 World Cup, claimed that \"The 'Hand of God' now belongs to me\". Suárez claimed he had no alternative and was acting out of instinct. Forlán agreed that Suárez saved the game, \"Suárez this time, instead of scoring goals, he saved one, I think he saved the game.\" Ghana coach Milovan Rajevac said the play was an \"injustice\" and Suárez was labeled a \"villain\" and a \"cheat\". But Uruguay coach, Óscar Tabárez, said these labels were too harsh: \"Well, there was a handball in the penalty area, there was a red card and Suárez was thrown out. Saying that Ghana were cheated out of the game is too harsh. We have to go by the rules. It might have been a mistake by my player but I do not like that word 'cheating'.\"\nGhana was the last African team left in the tournament and if they had won, they would have been the first team from Africa to ever qualify for the semi-finals. Thus, Suárez was said to have \"enraged an entire continent [Africa].\" But others viewed him as a hero who sacrificed himself in the semi-final for the unlikely chance that his team could win. A distraught Gyan conceded, \"I would say Suárez is a hero now in his own country, because the ball was going in and he held it with his hand. He is a hero now.\"\nArgentina vs Germany.\nOn 3 July 2010, Germany beat Argentina 4–0 at the Cape Town Stadium to reach the semi-finals. It was the third time in the tournament that Germany had scored four goals in a match. Germany's first goal was scored by Thomas Müller in the third minute of the match with a header from a free kick taken by Bastian Schweinsteiger. Early in the second half, Argentina pressed Germany and came close to scoring on a number of occasions, but Germany hit back on a counter-attack in the 67th minute when Miroslav Klose scored into an empty goal from a pass by Lukas Podolski. Germany's third goal came from Arne Friedrich after sliding the ball inside from Schweinsteiger's pass seven minutes later, before Klose took the score to 4–0, volleying the ball into the net off a cross from Mesut Özil. The 4–0 defeat was Argentina's biggest loss at a World Cup since 1974, a tournament which was ironically held in then-West Germany. Germany's coach Joachim Löw hailed his side's performance as one of \"absolute class\", but admitted the suspension of Müller for picking up a yellow card was a blow.\nParaguay vs Spain.\nOn 3 July 2010, Spain defeated Paraguay 1–0, to secure entry to the semi-finals where they would meet Germany. It was the first time that Spain had progressed to the semi-final of a World Cup since 1950; while for Paraguay, the quarter-final appearance was also the country's best ever performance.\nThe first half of the match finished goalless, although both sides had chances to score and Paraguay's Nelson Valdez had a goal ruled out as offside. The match suddenly became eventful in the second half due to a string of penalty kicks. First, Óscar Cardozo was pulled down by Gerard Piqué in Spain's penalty area and Paraguay was awarded a penalty. Cardozo took the penalty himself but it was saved by Spain's goalkeeper Iker Casillas. Spain soon after launched an attack at the other end of the field, in which David Villa was ruled by the referee to have been brought down by Antolín Alcaraz. Xabi Alonso stepped up to take the penalty kick and seemed to have scored, only for the referee to order it be retaken because of encroachment by a Spanish player into the penalty area before the kick was taken. Xabi Alonso's retake was saved by Paraguayan goalkeeper Justo Villar. As a result, the score remained 0–0 after the three penalty kicks. However, Spain ultimately managed to take the lead in the 82nd minute: David Villa collected a rebounded shot off the post from Pedro, to score himself off both posts. The goal turned out to be the winner for Spain.\nAfter the match, Spain's coach Vicente del Bosque conceded that his side were not playing at their best and were starved of possession. He also noted his view that Spain's next opponents Germany were the best team at the World Cup. Paraguay's coach Gerardo Martino stated he would be leaving his position at the end of his contract.\nSemi-finals.\nUruguay vs Netherlands.\nUruguay played the Netherlands in the first semi-final on 6 July 2010 at the Cape Town Stadium. The Netherlands won the match 3–2, thereby qualifying for the final for the first time since the 1978 World Cup.\nUruguay adopted a defensive posture early in the match, but were only able to hold their opponents scoreless for 18 minutes, when Dutch captain Giovanni van Bronckhorst scored from 35 yards into the top right corner of the goal. However, the Netherlands were unable to capitalise on their lead, as Diego Forlán equalised in the 41st minute (1–1) when his shot from 25 yards hit squarely in the middle of the goal was misjudged by goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg who missed it by millimetres. The Netherlands regained the lead in the second half, as a pass from Rafael van der Vaart reached Wesley Sneijder who hit it into the side-netting as Muslera dived and missed it by inches. Three minutes later, Kuyt crossed to Robben, who headed it in to make it 3–1. The Netherlands suffered a late scare when Maxi Pereira, who missed a penalty against Ghana, scored a stoppage-time free kick; however, the match finished 3–2 despite desperate Uruguayan attempts to equalise. After the match, Uruguay coach Óscar Tabárez spoke of his pride in his team for reaching the semi-finals.\nGermany vs Spain.\nOn 7 July 2010, Spain defeated Germany 1–0 in a rematch of the UEFA Euro 2008 Final (also won 1-0 by Spain) at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban to progress to the World Cup Final against the Netherlands. It was the first time that Spain had ever gone through to the final of the World Cup, while it was the second consecutive World Cup in which Germany had lost in the semi-finals, having lost to Italy at home four years before.\nSpain had the bulk of possession throughout the match, with Germany adopting a tight defensive structure. Germany created chances on the counter-attack, but Spain also went close to scoring on numerous occasions in each half. The match was deadlocked at 0–0 until the 73rd minute, when Spain was awarded a corner. The corner, taken by Xavi, was met by Carles Puyol, who headed the ball into the net as Manuel Neuer didn't do much to protect it to give Spain the lead. Thereafter, Spain protected its advantage and won the match.\nAfter the match, Spain's coach Vicente del Bosque praised the \"excellent performance\" of his team, while Germany's coach Joachim Löw predicted that Spain would win the final.\nThird place play-off.\nOn 10 July 2010, at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth, Germany defeated Uruguay 3–2 to claim third place at the World Cup for the second successive time after also finishing third at the 2006 FIFA World Cup. In the 19th minute, Bastian Schweinsteiger managed to take a shot towards the goal, which Muslera rebounded towards the onrushing Thomas Müller, who opened the scoring. Uruguay forced their way back into the match after Luis Suárez's pass put Edinson Cavani through on the left. He slid low into the far corner to put the South American side on level terms after 28 minutes. Diego Forlán then put them ahead six minutes into the second half with a beautiful side volley from the edge of the penalty box while goalkeeper Hans-Jörg Butt didn't move off his line. Marcell Jansen then scored on 56 minutes after Muslera came for Jérôme Boateng's cross but missed it right in front of Jansen, allowing him to head into an empty net. Mesut Özil took a corner in the 82nd minute, which reached a German player, bounced off him and went up to Khedira's head, who headed it in. Uruguay almost forced extra time when Forlán curled a 92nd-minute free kick onto the bar, but Germany held on to win the match. This was the eighth consecutive World Cup in which European teams finished third, stretching back to 1982.\nAfter the game, Uruguay coach Óscar Tabárez insisted that his side did not deserve to be on the losing side: \"We achieved an equal game against a real power, we could have won because in the game [they] were not superior to us ... We're not that far away [from Germany's level], the route has been marked, we must learn from this.\""

He was drafted by the Atlanta Falcons in the 12th round of the 1984 NFL Draft. He played college football at Mesa State and Colorado.\nAlthough he was selected in the 1984 draft, he elected to return to college that year. During the 1984 season, he attempted to file an exemption to play in the NFL, but was rejected under the \"Red Grange Rule\" that forbade players from playing both college and pro football in the same year. He joined the Falcons in 1985, but was released and signed by the Indianapolis Colts. After suffering an injury in 1986, he was placed on injured reserve; when the Colts attempted to get him back on the roster, the St. Louis Cardinals picked him off waivers."

The NLC did not have an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament; conference members could qualify through an at-large bid.\nThe conference disbanded in 2012 after the Atlantic Sun Conference (ASUN) and Big South Conference began sponsoring women's lacrosse. In the ASUN, Jacksonville had been the only full member to sponsor women's lacrosse, but Kennesaw State and Stetson added the sport in 2012–13. Those schools brought Detroit and Howard into ASUN lacrosse. As for the Big South, three full members—High Point, Liberty, and Presbyterian—sponsored the sport during the NLC's final season in 2012. The number of full Big South members sponsoring the sport increased to seven for the 2012–13 school year when NLC member Longwood, previously a basketball independent, joined the Big South and Campbell, Coastal Carolina, and Winthrop added the sport.

        "title": "Miguel Fuentes (baseball)",
        "text": "Miguel Fuentes Pinet (May 10, 1946 – January 29, 1970) was a Puerto Rican Major League Baseball (MLB) pitcher. Fuentes was signed to his first professional contract in 1969 with the Seattle Pilots. He went on to pitch in eight games for the club at the major league level after strong performances in the minor leagues. During the off-season, he was murdered in a bar fight at the age of 23.\nEarly life and early career.\nFuentes was born in Loíza, Puerto Rico, in the barrio of Loíza Aldea. He starred as an amateur baseball player and, in 1968, helped lead his amateur team to a Puerto Rican championship. He was discovered by scout Felix Delgado, who went on to sign Fuentes to his first professional contract.\nCareer with the Pilots organization.\nFuentes was initially assigned to the Clinton Pilots, a Class A team in the Midwest League. He recorded an 8–2 record in 26 appearances and his earned run average (ERA) of 1.46 was the lowest in the league for pitchers with 40 or more innings pitched. For his efforts, Fuentes was called to the Seattle Pilots' Major League roster in September 1969.\nHe made his Major League debut on September 1, striking out two in an inning of work against the New York Yankees. After a second relief appearance, Fuentes was given his first Major League start; he responded by throwing a complete game against the Chicago White Sox, giving up one run on seven hits.\nFuentes made three other starts with the Pilots, with a relief appearance in between his second and third starts; in those other three starts he was credited with the loss. Fuentes ended his Major League year with a relief appearance in Seattle's final game, where he threw the team's last ever pitches, as the Pilots would become the Milwaukee Brewers in 1970.\nDuring his lone year in baseball, Fuentes was 1–3 with a 5.19 ERA and 14 strikeouts in eight games (four starts).\nDeath.\nDuring the MLB off-season in the winter of 1969 and 1970, Fuentes played in the Puerto Rican Winter League with the Caguas Criollos.\nA few days after the Criollos' season ended in the league's playoffs, on January 29, Fuentes was shot three times at a bar in Loíza Aldea. \"Fuentes had gone outside to relieve himself because there was a plumbing problem in the bathroom. Someone who thought Fuentes was doing it too close to his car shot him.\" Fuentes was sent to a hospital in a state of shock and died of his wounds shortly thereafter.\nFuentes was regarded as a top prospect in the Pilots organization at the time of his death. Because of the Pilots' move to Milwaukee in 1970 to become the Brewers, Fuentes holds the distinction of throwing the final pitches in the history of the Seattle Pilots.\nFuentes appears in the 1970 set of Topps baseball cards as a Seattle Pilot, as the Topps cards were already in production (and the Seattle franchise had not yet announced their move to Milwaukee) at the time of Fuentes' death."

        "title": "Snooker Shoot Out",
        "text": "The Snooker Shoot Out is a professional snooker tournament played under a variation of the standard rules. Each match consists of one frame, played over a maximum of 10 minutes, with a shot clock in effect. First staged in 1990 as the Shoot-Out, the event was revived in 2011 and renamed the Snooker Shoot Out. Held from 2011 to 2016 as a non-ranking event with 64 competitors, it became a ranking event in 2017 for an expanded field of 128 players.\nThe event is notable for its wildcard entrants, including young amateur players. Liam Davies first competed in 2019 when he was 12 years old, making him the youngest player to feature in a professional ranking event. At the 2023 edition, 14-year-old Vladislav Gradinari became the youngest player to win a televised match at a ranking event, beating Ng On Yee in the first round, continuing his run by beating Pan American Snooker Champion Victor Sarkis, reaching last 32 before losing to Tom Ford and Reanne Evans became the first female player to achieve the same feat. The current champion is Mark Allen, who defeated Cao Yupeng in December 2023 to become the first top 16 player to win the Shoot Out. Stuart Bingham, Mark Selby, and Mark Williams have also all reached finals.\nUnlike other major snooker tournaments, the audience does not remain silent during play, and the event has become known for its boisterous atmosphere.\nHistory.\nSingle frame snooker competition was a staple of early televised coverage of the sport, and largely responsible for bringing the game to the mainstream of British sport, primarily through the BBC's popular \"Pot Black\" programme. Extended televised coverage of longer professional tournaments, however, had caused the format to become jaded, with the last \"Pot Black\" tournament taking place in 2007.\nA similar event known as Shoot-Out was first held in September 1990, when, except in the final, all matches were decided over a single frame. With the demise of \"Pot Black\", the event returned in 2011 with several innovations, and was renamed to Snooker Shoot Out. It was sponsored by CaesarsCasino.com.\nIt was a one-frame shoot-out with a random draw, where the winner is given £32,000. The top 64 players in the world rankings contested the tournament, which was shown on Sky Sports and ITV4. The 2011 event was the first time that Sky Sports had shown a World Snooker Tour event live since 2004. From 2011 to 2015 the event took place at the Circus Arena in Blackpool. The event was sponsored by PartyPoker.com in 2012, by Betfair in 2013, by 888casino in 2014, and by Betway in 2015. The tournament was held at the Hexagon in Reading for 2016. From 2016 to 2018, the tournament was broadcast by ITV and was sponsored by Coral. In 2017, the tournament became a ranking event for the first time, open to all 128 professional players. At the end of the season, the players voted to keep it as a ranking event. From 2017 the tournament was staged at the Colosseum in Watford. In 2018, the event agreed a long-term deal with Eurosport and Quest to broadcast the event in the United Kingdom until 2026, beginning with the 2019 Snooker Shoot Out.\nIn January 2023, Reanne Evans became the first female winner of a Snooker Shoot Out match as well as the first woman to win a televised match at a ranking event. In December 2023, Shaun Murphy made the first ever Shoot Out maximum break in his first-round match against Bulcsú Révész.\nFormat.\nRules by the WPBSA:\nCentury breaks.\nTotal: 30"

They released four singles.\nHistory.\nIn 2009, the band released and re-released their debut single, \"Dance the Way I Feel\", before supporting La Roux on their UK tour. In 2010, the band released the singles \"These New Knights\", \"Jackson's Last Stand\" and \"The Key\" as well as their debut album \"The Golden Year\".\nThe band played at Glastonbury Festival and Bestival in 2009 and supported La Roux on their tour in early 2010. In May 2010, they played at Evolution Festival and in July at Global Gathering, along with a series of festivals all over Europe throughout the summer of 2010.\nThey appear on Tiësto's fifth album \"A Town Called Paradise\" on the song \"The Feeling\".\nCharles Haddon's death and disbandment.\nOn 20 August 2010, Charles Haddon, the lead singer of the band, died after a performance at Pukkelpop, Belgium. He died by suicide in the backstage artists' parking area. Haddon was reported to have been distressed after he feared he had seriously injured a young girl earlier after a stage dive. Haddon was 22 years old.\nOn 3 October 2010, the remaining Ou Est Le Swimming Pool members arranged a festival, billed as Chazzstock, in honour of Haddon at Koko in Camden, London. The Kooks, Mr Hudson, Tony Hadley of Spandau Ballet, Man Like Me, Daisy Dares You, Kissy Sell Out, Tribes, Ollie Wride and The Horrors performed at the event. The event raised more than £8,000 for charities Mind and Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM). Faris Badwan of The Horrors also dedicated his side-project Cat's Eyes' debut album \"Cat's Eyes\" to Haddon's memory."

They won the Catalonia's Cup in 2008 and now play in the Catalan Rugby League Championship, the premier rugby league tournament in Catalonia, after being admitted into the competition in 2010. The sports club's president is Joan Laporta.\nHistory.\n2008.\nFC Barcelona's sporting club expanded into rugby league in 2008, after having teams in rugby union, basketball, team handball, futsal, track and field athletics, roller hockey and ice hockey already established in Spanish sport. Like the football team and other sporting expansions from FC Barcelona, their kit manufacturers are Nike. The club played and won the inaugural Catalonia Cup, a competition featuring developing teams in the region that took place in April 2008 with 3 teams: FC Barcelona, Aligots de Girona and Nord-Català. Barcelona won their first ever competitive rugby league game in their history against Girona Buzzard by 22 points to 20. They then defeated Roussillon 24-4 to win the triangular tournament.\n2009.\nIn 2009, the club withdrew from Catalan competitions to strengthen for a bid to join the Catalan Rugby League Championship. They decided to rejoin in 2010 after the first professional rugby league game to take place in Barcelona in 2009, between Catalans Dragons and Warrington Wolves in Super League XIV which attracted a crowd of 18,150, evidently strengthened the popularity of the game in Spain and particularly the Catalan region.\n2010.\nAfter reforming, the club joined the Catalan Rugby League Championship (CRLC) in 2010; a two-pool league in which Barcelona University Club were the reigning champions from the 2009 season. Barcelona formed something of a rivalry with BUC in the seven-team competition, as both competed concurrently, but in separate pools. It is widely speculated, but purely a hypothesis, that this branch of the successful FC Barcelona club will become members of the Rugby Football League and possibly Super League should the venture prove a success in Catalonia, as they were now playing more competitive rugby, on a more regular basis. Their first ever game was against CR Sant Cugat on 13 May 2010, a game which ended in a disappointing 30-20 loss. They earned their first win of the competition with a 44-30 win at home to GEiEG to give them a hope of qualifying for the finals. And, despite GEiEG winning their last game of the pool against Sant Cugat, Barça were able to qualify for the third and fourth place play-off, where they played CE INEF Lleida, in a narrow 36-30 loss.\nCurrent squad.\nThe following was the squad that finished fourth in the 2010 CRLC:"

Born in Portland, Oregon, he threw right-handed, batted left-handed, and was listed as tall and . He attended Clark College and the University of Oregon.\nPlaying career.\nDickson spent his first four years in professional baseball in the Pittsburgh Pirates' farm system until he was drafted by the Colt .45s, a first-year expansion team, after he won ten games in the Class B Three-I League in 1961.\nHe debuted for Houston in July 1963, and in his third appearance he earned his first major league save with 1 innings of scoreless relief, preserving Bob Bruce's 4–2 victory over the Milwaukee Braves on July 5. He gave up no runs and only one hit in his first four outings, but poor performances against the St. Louis Cardinals on July 20–21 and the Pirates on July 30 inflated his earned run average to 9.31 by the end of the month. On January 20, 1964, Dickson was traded with another young pitcher, Wally Wolf, to Cincinnati for veteran infielder Eddie Kasko. He worked in only four early-season games as a relief pitcher for the Reds, but gained his first major league victory on May 5 against the Pirates. He then won nine games as a reliever for Triple-A San Diego and was selected by Kansas City in the 1964 Rule 5 draft that November.\nDickson spent all of on the Athletics' roster, appearing in 68 games, fourth-most in the American League. He won three of five decisions, one of only two Kansas City pitchers to post a winning record for a 103-loss, last-place team. He registered no saves. He then began 1966 with the Athletics, and was less effective in 23 appearances with a 4.86 earned run average. On July 24, 1966, he was given his only major league starting pitcher assignment against the Washington Senators. Staked to a 4–0 lead in the first inning, he pitched well for the first three frames but then ran into trouble in the fourth, surrendering four runs, two coming on a home run by former teammate Ken Harrelson. Dickson earned a \"no decision\" in that contest, but he was sent down to Triple-A after that game and spent the remainder of his pro career in the top level of minor league baseball, retiring after the 1970 season.\nAll told, in 142 innings pitched in the majors, he allowed 135 hits and 77 bases on balls with 86 strikeouts. He won five of eight decisions and added three saves."

        "text": "An All-American team is an honorary sports team that is generally composed of the best amateur players of a specific season for each team position—who in turn are given the honorific \"All-America\" and typically referred to as \"All-American athletes\", or simply \"All-Americans\". The term is used in U.S. team sports to refer to players who are selected by members of the national media. Walter Camp selected the first All-America team in the early days of American football in 1889.\nBoth the McDonald's All-American team selection and the Jordan Brand All-American team selection have associated high school basketball all-star games held in conjunction with them, in which the players are divided into two teams to compete in an exhibition game. The Jordan Brand held its first contest in 2002. McDonald's All-Americans have competed in such contests since 1977, and a girls' game was added in 2002. Both the \"Parade\" and \"USA Today\" lists included underclassmen, but fifth-year seniors were ineligible for the \"Parade\" team. Those lists also both designated ordinal teams as first team, second team, etc., while the McDonald's and Jordan Brand teams were selected without distinction among selectees. In basketball, some All-American teams are composed by position, while others were not.\nIn 2006, 47 boys' high-school basketball players were selected to major honorary All-American teams. For the 2006 selections, McDonald's selected 24 players to its All-American team; the Jordan Brand included 21 players, and the \"USA Today\" All-USA prep basketball team had 15. The list also includes the 40 \"Parade\" All-Americans, the largest of the four teams. The 2006 class of McDonald's All-Americans is regarded as the best class of the decade, with approximately 22 of the 24 expected to make it to the National Basketball Association by the time they have exhausted their collegiate eligibility, which in most cases is four years of competition in five years of enrollment.\nSherron Collins, Kevin Durant, Wayne Ellington, Spencer Hawes, Tywon Lawson, Greg Oden, Brandan Wright and Thaddeus Young were named to all four lists. Among this group, Durant, Hawes, Lawson and Oden were selected to the first team of both organizations that enumerated their selections. Collins was the only one of these to go undrafted. Oden and Derrick Rose were both NBA draft overall number-one selections, in 2007 and 2008, respectively. Gerald Henderson Jr. was the highest selection in the 2009 NBA draft (12th overall). Damion James and Stanley Robinson were the only selections from this group in the 2010 NBA draft. Kyle Singler and Vernon Macklin were the final draftees from this group in the 2011 NBA draft.\nAll-American teams.\nThe table below details the selections for four major 2006 boys' high-school basketball All-American teams. For those teams where teams were enumerated as first, second, etc. team, the number corresponding to this designation appears in the table. For teams where no such enumeration exists, a check mark is used. The following columns are included in the table:"

Although the honorees generally do not compete as a unit, the term is used in U.S. team sports to refer to players who are selected by members of the national media. Walter Camp selected the first All-America team in the early days of American football in 1889. In 1950, the American Baseball Coaches Association (ABCA) selected its first All-American baseball team. It has since chosen All-American teams and a player of the year for each division (National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I, Division II, Division III, National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics, junior college and high school). In 1991, \"Collegiate Baseball\" began selecting college All-American, Freshman All-American, and High School All-American teams. \"Baseball America\" has selected – since 1981 – pre-season and post-season All-American teams and College Player of the Year honorees.\nVarious organizations selected All-American lists of the best players for the 1991 NCAA Division I college baseball season. The ABCA, the magazine \"Baseball America\", and \"Collegiate Baseball\" were the NCAA-sanctioned selectors. This list only includes players selected to the post-season All-American first team for each selector. However, many All-American selections choose second, third, etc. teams from the remaining eligible candidates.\nAccomplishments.\nBobby Jones was selected as player of the year by both American Baseball Coaches Association and \"Collegiate Baseball\", while David McCarty was the \"Baseball America\" player of the year. Brooks Kieschnick went on to be a repeat All-American selection on the 1992 and 1993 teams and be named a player of the year both years. Mike Kelly, who had been 1990 \"Baseball America\" player of the year, returned from the 1990 team, along with Phillip Stidham. Kelly won the 1990 Rotary Smith Award and Jones won the award in 1991. Kelly also won the 1991 Golden Spikes Award.\nThis class produced one Major League Baseball All-Star, one Olympic Games gold medalist and one Major League Baseball record holder.

Four school had two members of the team: Long Beach State, Pepperdine, Villanova and Wichita State\nJones led the National League in sacrifice hits allowed during the 1995 season. The following year, he was selected for the 1996 MLB All-Star Game. However, in the 2001 Major League Baseball season, Jones led the National League in home runs allowed and losses. During the 1995 season, Gates finished second in the American League in sacrifice flies and third in assists. During the 1998 season, Kelly had a perfect fielding percentage with 137 putouts and 4 assists for a total of 141 chances. Mike Neill, whose first-inning home run put the United States ahead to stay in the championship game, earned a gold medal in baseball at the 2000 Summer Olympics. During the 2004 season, Mark Sweeney had five pinch-hit home runs, two shy of the major league record.

        "text": "The 2015 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 86th edition of the Major League Baseball All-Star Game. The game was played at Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati, Ohio on Tuesday, July 14. It was televised nationally on Fox. The American League All-Stars defeated the National League All-Stars by a score of 6–3.\nOn January 21, 2013, then-Major League Baseball (MLB) Commissioner Bud Selig, announced the 2015 All-Star Game would be hosted by the Cincinnati Reds. This was the first time the city of Cincinnati has hosted the All-Star Game since the 1988 All-Star Game was played at Riverfront Stadium.\nOn July 15, 2014, Selig also announced that Pete Rose would not be prohibited from participating in the 2015 All-Star Game ceremonies. Rose was an All-Star for 13 of the 19 seasons he played on the Reds and was a member of the Big Red Machine. In 1991, Rose was permanently banned from MLB for baseball betting. Rose, wearing a red sport coat, appeared on the field in front of the pitcher's mound before the game and received a standing ovation alongside former teammates Johnny Bench, Barry Larkin, and Joe Morgan.\nOn May 12, 2015, the Reds announced that Todd Frazier would serve as the 2015 All-Star Game spokesperson.\nMike Trout, an outfielder for the Los Angeles Angels, was named the All-Star Game Most Valuable Player for the second straight year.\nFan balloting.\nStarters.\nBalloting for the 2015 All-Star Game starters began online April 23 and ended on July 2. The top vote-getters at each position (including the designated hitter for the American League) and the top three among outfielders, were named the starters for their respective leagues. The results were announced on July 5. A record 620 million votes were cast, surpassing the record of 391 million votes in 2012. Josh Donaldson was the leading vote-getter with 14,090,188 votes, breaking the record that Josh Hamilton set in 2012 with 11,073,744 votes. Bryce Harper set a new NL record for votes this year with 13,864,950 votes.\nHowever, MLB canceled at least 65 million ballots on grounds of fraud and ballot stuffing. At one point during the balloting, the top vote-getters for eight of the starting nine positions for the American League were Kansas City Royals players.\nFinal roster spot.\nAfter the rosters were finalized, a second ballot of five players per league was created for the All-Star Final Vote to determine the 34th and final player of each roster. The online balloting were conducted from July 6 through July 10. Brett Gardner of the New York Yankees was removed from the ballot on July 9 after he replaced Alex Gordon on the roster due to injury. The winners of the All-Star Final Vote were Mike Moustakas of the Kansas City Royals (AL) and Carlos Martinez of the St. Louis Cardinals (NL).\nGame summary.\nMike Trout of the Angels led off the game with a home run off Zack Greinke. The NL tied the score in the bottom of the second when Jhonny Peralta drove in Paul Goldschmidt with an RBI single off AL starter Dallas Keuchel. In the top of the fifth, Prince Fielder, who was pinch hitting for Nelson Cruz, hit a go-ahead RBI single off Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw that scored Trout to give the AL a 2–1 lead. The next batter, Lorenzo Cain, hit an RBI double to score Albert Pujols to make it a 3–1 ballgame. \nIn the bottom of the sixth, Andrew McCutchen homered off Chris Archer to make it a one-run game. In the top of the seventh, Trout walked and was lifted for pinch runner Brock Holt who scored on an RBI double by Manny Machado to give the AL a 4–2 lead. Machado then scored on a sac fly by Fielder to make it a 5–2 game. In the top of the eighth inning, the Twins' Brian Dozier hit a home run to make it a 6–2 ballgame. \nIn the bottom of the ninth, Ryan Braun led off with a triple to right field off of Twins closer Glen Perkins, then scored on a sacrifice fly by Brandon Crawford to make it a 6–3 score. The next batter, Cubs rookie Kris Bryant, flied to right for the second out, and finally, Joe Panik lined out to left field to seal the AL's third straight victory and earn home-field advantage in the World Series.\nEntertainment.\nThe Canadian national anthem was sung by Columbus Blue Jackets anthem singer Leo Welsh. The American national anthem was sung by R&amp;B singer Ciara, accompanied by three female backup singers. During the seventh inning stretch, country singer Josh Turner sang God Bless America."

        "title": "World Cup Sculpture",
        "text": "The World Cup Sculpture, or simply The Champions, is a bronze statue of the 1966 World Cup Final located near the site of West Ham United Football Club's former Boleyn Ground (Upton Park) stadium in the London Borough of Newham, England. It depicts a famous victory scene photographed after the final, held at the old Wembley Stadium in London, featuring Bobby Moore, Geoff Hurst, Martin Peters and Ray Wilson. It remains the only time the England national football team have won the World Cup, and England captain Moore is pictured held shoulder high by his colleagues, holding the Jules Rimet Trophy aloft.\nJointly commissioned by Newham Council and West Ham United, the statue stands at the junction of Barking Road and Green Street, near the former location of the Boleyn Ground. It commemorates West Ham's contribution to the victory, with Moore, Hurst and Peters having all been West Ham players at the time of the 1966 World Cup. Sculpted by the Royal Sculptor Philip Jackson, it was unveiled in 2003 by Prince Andrew, president of the Football Association. Jackson went on to also sculpt the statue of Bobby Moore unveiled at the new Wembley when it opened in 2007.\nStatue.\nThe work, titled by Jackson as \"The Champions\" or \"The World Cup Sculpture\", is a one-and-a-half times life-size bronze piece, tall, weighing four tonnes. It stands in a prominent location at the junction of Barking Road (the A124) and Green Street in the London Borough of Newham, close to the former home stadium of West Ham, the Boleyn Ground (commonly called Upton Park).\nInspiration.\nThe statue was inspired by the victory scenes in the immediate aftermath of the 1966 World Cup final. Moore, Hurst, Peters and Wilson had just been part of the England side which defeated West Germany in a famous 4–2 extra time victory over Germany in the final held on home soil, at the old 1923 built Wembley stadium (since replaced by the new Wembley Stadium opened in 2007).\nIn that final, Moore was the team captain and a central defender, while Wilson served as full back alongside him. Peters in midfield, and Hurst as one of the strikers, were the England goalscorers on the day of the final, with Hurst scoring the first goal in the first half, Peters scoring in the second half, and Hurst scoring two more in extra time to complete a famous World Cup hat-trick and secure victory.\nJackson used as his subject material a series of photographs taken during a 12-second period after the game. In a scene described by the Football Association as \"one of the enduring post-match images\", Moore was pictured holding the Jules Rimet World Cup Trophy jubilantly above his head, while he himself is being held shoulder high by Hurst and Wilson, while Peters completes the scene.\nJackson exercised some artistic license to not depict Ray Wilson's expression entirely accurately, as in reality he had been grimacing in the photo due to taking most of Moore's weight, stating \"I didn't think he would mind\". Wilson, described by the FA as a \"normally reserved\" man, later remarked of the events depicted, \"Nearly all the other players were off celebrating around the pitch and they just needed someone to help lift Bobby, otherwise I would not have been there, believe me. I'd have been doing my own celebrating\"\nHistory.\nCommissioning.\nThe statue was commissioned jointly by West Ham United and Newham London Borough Council, where the club resides. At the time of the final, Moore, Hurst and Peters were all West Ham players, while Wilson was with Everton F.C. The statue was the idea of Newham councillor Graeme Cambage. He said of the project after the unveiling, \"After Bobby Moore died, I thought there ought to be a statue of him but it's taken a long time to realise my dream\".\nThe statue cost £725,000 in all, with £400,000 coming from a Government grant, and the bulk of the remainder from the football club. The cost included associated street improvements. Contributions also came from the Green Street Single Regeneration Budget, the Arts Council for England, and Arts &amp; Business.\nProduction.\nThe project was announced on 18 October 2001 by Newham Council leader Sir Robin Wales and West Ham chairman Terry Brown, during a ceremony at Newham Town Hall at which Hurst, Peters and Wilson viewed a miniature model of the proposed statue. The statue itself took a year to complete.\nUnveiling.\nThe statue was unveiled on 28 April 2003 by Prince Andrew, Duke of York, president of the Football Association. The plan to have the Duke of York unveil the statue was announced on 24 February 2003, on the tenth anniversary of Moore's death from cancer, aged 51.\nHurst, Peters and Wilson were joined by Moore's widow Stephanie at the unveiling. In the midst of a public campaign to give Moore the recognition of a British honour, rarely given posthumously, Prince Andrew inadvertently referred to Moore as \"Sir Bobby\" during the ceremony.\nProposed move.\nWhen West Ham departed Upton Park for the London Stadium in 2016, it was proposed that the statue be moved to a site in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. However, difficulties in gaining the approval of all the concerned parties led to a reversal of the decision, with Newham Council announcing in 2018 that the statue would remain in its original location. As a result, in August 2020 West Ham announced the commissioning of a new statue for the London Stadium, featuring Moore, Hurst and Peters in a similar pose, this time from the night of the club's victory in the 1965 European Cup Winners' Cup Final.\nReception.\nPaul Hayward, writing in \"The Daily Telegraph\" in 2003, described it as \"stunning\", and that it \"radiates golden light and transforms a mundane road junction into a shrine both to England's finest hour and West Ham's contribution to the game in these isles\".\nMick Dennis, writing for the \"Daily Mirror\", was critical of the work, stating the statues did not resemble the players."

A 5'10 guard, Thompson was the first Iowa State player to score more than 1,000 points and the first player in school history to tally 40 points in a game. As a senior in 1956–57, Thompson earned consensus second team All-American honors, first team All-America status from the Associated Press, and was named Big Seven Conference player of the year, beating out Kansas star Wilt Chamberlain. Thompson excelled in a second sport as well, leading Iowa State to the 1957 College World Series as a star shortstop.\nFollowing the close of his standout college career, Thompson chose to join the Bartlesville Phillips 66ers of the Amateur Athletic Union, though he was also drafted in the fifth round of the 1957 NBA draft by the Minneapolis Lakers.

        "title": "Charles Jenkins (basketball)",
        "text": "Charles T. Jenkins (born February 28, 1989) is an American professional basketball player. He was drafted by the Golden State Warriors in the 2011 NBA draft after finishing his four-year college career with the Hofstra Pride. In addition to being a citizen of the United States, Jenkins also has Serbian citizenship.\nWhile attending Hempstead, New York's Hofstra University, Jenkins, a guard for the Hofstra Pride men's basketball team, had already amassed 1,767 points, 440 rebounds, 331 assists and 156 steals through his first three seasons. He is Hofstra's all-time leading scorer (2,463), breaking Antoine Agudio's record (2,286) set in 2007–08, and graduated as the second leading scorer in Colonial Athletic Association history behind Hall of Famer David Robinson, who scored 2,669 points at Navy. Jenkins had his jersey retired by Hofstra prior to his final home game of his senior season, making him the fourth player in school history to be so honored, and the first to have it retired while still active.\nEarly life and high school.\nJenkins was born in Brooklyn, New York, where he lived in the Brownsville section for six years until moving to Rosedale, Queens.\nThe youngster took to basketball under the influence of two close family members: his father who had played collegiate ball for the Navy before transferring to Virginia Western Community College as well as his older brother who had played some high school basketball. Teenage Jenkins commuted to Holy Cross High School until transferring to Springfield Gardens High School, where he played high school basketball for three seasons. As a senior in 2005–06, he averaged 21.1 points, 7.2 assists and 5.1 rebounds en route to a \"New York Post\" selection to the All-New York City Team.\nCollege career.\nFreshman.\nAfter redshirting his true freshman season of 2006–07, Jenkins began competing for the Hofstra University Pride in 2007–08. He played in 29 games and averaged 15.0 points and 4.6 rebounds, led his team in free throw percentage (78.0), and finished 10th in the Colonial Athletic Association (CAA) in scoring (first among freshmen). Jenkins was named the CAA Rookie of the Year, Metropolitan New York Rookie of the Year and to the Third Team All-Metropolitan New York.\nSophomore.\nIn 2008–09, Jenkins averaged 19.7 points and 4.8 rebounds in 32 games played. In the last game of the regular season against UNC Wilmington, he surpassed the 1,000-point milestone, joining Agudio as the only two sophomores to reach 1,000 points prior to their junior seasons. At the season's end, his 1,065 points stood 47 points more than Agudio's pace at the end of his respective sophomore season. Jenkins garnered numerous awards for his year. Among them was the coveted Haggerty Award, which is an award given annually to the greater New York Metropolitan area's best Division I men's basketball player. He became just the fifth sophomore overall (and first since Ron Artest in 1998–99) to earn it in the 73-year history of the award to that point.\nJunior.\nAs a junior in 2009–10, Jenkins once again increased most of his season averages. He scored 20.6 points, grabbed 4.5 rebounds, dished out 3.9 assists and shot 40.9% from three-point range. On November 30, 2009, in an 84–80 win versus Fairfield, he scored a career-high 38 points on 12-for-17 shooting and went 9-for-9 in free throw attempts. Although the Pride would finish the year with a 19–15 overall record, Jenkins' personal play was good enough to make him the Colonial Athletic Association Men's Basketball Player of the Year. Additionally, he became just the ninth repeat winner of the Haggerty Award.\nSenior.\nJenkins became just the third player all-time to win the Haggerty Award three times, joining Jim McMillian (Columbia, 1968–70) and Chris Mullin (St. John's, 1983–85), both of whom later achieved great success at the NBA and/or Olympic levels of competition.\nProfessional career.\nNBA: Golden State Warriors.\nIn the 2011 NBA draft, combo guard Jenkins was selected in the second round (44th overall) by the Golden State Warriors after the team had taken shooting guard Klay Thompson with their first-round pick (11th) earlier in the night. Due to the 2011 NBA lockout, Jenkins signed with the Italian team Teramo Basket of the Lega Basket Serie A on November 24, 2011. However, the lockout ended within two weeks and he left Teramo without playing any games for the club.\nOn December 9, 2011, he officially signed with the Warriors, coached by Mark Jackson. Twenty-two-year-old Jenkins made his NBA debut on December 25, 2011, in the Warriors' 2011–12 season opener against the Los Angeles Clippers. Briefly entering the contest, he finished with one assist in 1 minute of action. Settling into the role of fighting for the twenty-three-year-old starting point guard Steph Curry's backup minutes, rookie Jenkins ended up getting unexpected opportunities towards the end of the lockout-shortened season due to the third-year player Curry's persistent ankle injuries. Though the team had signed Nate Robinson early into the season to take most of Curry's point guard backup minutes, Jenkins would end up often starting in place of injured Curry. The rookie's minutes especially increased from March 2012, as Curry was ruled out for the rest of the season and Monta Ellis got traded. On March 24, 2012, Jenkins scored career-high 27 points in a 90–87 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers, continuing to post improved numbers until the end of the season and finishing with an average of 5.8 points and 3.3 assists in 51 games, 28 of them starts. The Warriors failed to make the playoffs; several days after their season ended, the team promoted its assistant general manager and former player agent Bob Myers to be the new general manager while simultaneously demoting existing GM Larry Riley to a scouting position.\nHeading into his second season at Golden State, twenty-three-year-old Jenkins participated in the NBA Summer League in Las Vegas throughout July 2012. Playing alongside Warriors teammates such as rookie Harrison Barnes and fellow second-year player Klay Thompson, Jenkins had a good showing as the team won each of its five games with Jenkins the top scorer in two of them. Just before the Summer League, in anticipation of Robinson leaving, the team had signed point guard Jarrett Jack with the question of who would be Curry's primary backup in the upcoming season, Jack or Jenkins, initially left open.\nOnce the season began, Jenkins saw his role on the team diminished severely, getting very little playing time with Curry back healthy and newly-acquired Jack getting most of the backup minutes. On February 21, 2013, Jenkins was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers for a second-round draft pick.\nPhiladelphia 76ers.\nJoining the struggling Sixers, a team well out of the playoff spots and on the verge of tanking for a better draft position, Jenkins was again relegated to the bench, getting sporadic minutes way down in the pecking order behind guards preferred by head coach Doug Collins such as Jrue Holiday, Evan Turner, Nick Young, Damien Wilkins, and even the newly-acquired Justin Holiday who joined several weeks after Jenkins.\nAt the end of the season, with no firm NBA offers other than several training camp invitations, Jenkins began considering Europe as an option via instructing his agent to pursue those opportunities as well, revealing in later interviews he first got alerted to professional basketball outside the U.S. by fellow Philadelphia benchwarmer Jeremy Pargo who had explained the European club basketball system to him during one of their Sixers team flights while offering personal advice \"not to settle for an NBA journeyman career since there is life in European basketball\".\nMoving to Europe: KK Crvena zvezda.\nOn July 30, 2013, following interest from Maccabi Tel Aviv and Olimpia Milano, Jenkins signed a one-year contract with the Serbian team Crvena zvezda, citing its superior financial offer as his main consideration due to having no specific knowledge of any European clubs. Joining the squad coached by Dejan Radonjić, Jenkins came in alongside a number of acquisitions—including center Boban Marjanović, coveted small forward Blake Schilb, shooting guard Jaka Blažič, and power forward Ivan Radenović—as the Adriatic League runner-up looked to reinforce on all positions ahead of its return to Euroleague after 14 years as well as continuation of the chase for its first Adriatic League title domestically. With experienced returning players—point guard DeMarcus Nelson in his second season with the team, small forward Marko Simonović, and center Raško Katić—newly-acquired Schilb, coming off a great Euroleague season with Élan Chalon and signed to a 3-year contract, was projected to lead the team in Euroleague.\nWith Schilb as the focal point of coach Radonjić's setup initially, Jenkins was mostly coming off the bench while sharing minutes at the two position with Blažič along with occasionally backing up compatriot Nelson at point guard. Drawn in a Euroleague group with Lokomotiv Kuban, Maccabi Tel Aviv, Panathinaikos, Baskonia, and Lietuvos rytas, Zvezda failed to progress to the Top 16 Euroleague stage with a 4–6 record that was nevertheless good enough to continue the European season in the second-tier Eurocup's Last 32 stage. With Schilb's suddenly increasingly peripheral role in the team due to not fitting in coach Radonjić's plans all of which eventually led to the player being left off the squad in mid January 2014 and the two sides agreeing a negotiated settlement to break off the 3-year deal after only 6 months, Jenkins saw his minutes increase, scoring team-high 16 points in a Eurocup home win versus Bilbao. Not long afterwards, by mid-to-late January 2014, he accepted the offer of extending his contract with Crvena zvezda for an additional year with an opt-out clause in the summer transfer window should he receive an NBA offer.\nIn 2014–15 season, Crvena zvezda won the Adriatic League championship, the Serbian League championship and the Radivoj Korać Cup.\nSeasons in Europe.\nOn July 8, 2015, Jenkins signed with Italian club Emporio Armani Milano for the 2015–16 season.\nOn July 15, 2016, Jenkins returned to Crvena zvezda, signing a two-year deal. In 2016–17, he led the EuroLeague in steals, with 2.1 per game. Jenkins was also named 2017 ABA League Playoffs MVP, where he averaged 12.3 points, 5.3 assists, 3 rebounds, 1.5 steals and average PIR of 15.2.\nOn June 29, 2017, Jenkins signed a two-year deal with Russian club Khimki. Jenkins played for HBC Sicklerville in the 2018 edition of The Basketball Tournament. He scored 3 points and had 2 rebounds in the team's first-round loss to the Talladega Knights. In the 2018–19 EuroLeague season, he averaged 6.9 points on 42.0% three-point shooting, 2.8 rebounds and 1.0 steal per game over 29 games.\nOn July 5, 2019, Jenkins signed a two-year deal for Crvena zvezda. It is his third stint with the Zvezda.\nOn June 20, 2020, Jenkins signed a contract with Greek club Olympiacos of the EuroLeague.\nPersonal life.\nJenkins has one brother and one sister. He cites Dwayne Washington as his favorite athlete, and prior to selecting Hofstra he had also been recruited by St. John's and Liberty."

        "text": "Jack Campbell (born January 9, 1992) is an American professional ice hockey goaltender for the Edmonton Oilers of the National Hockey League (NHL). Prior to his professional career, Campbell played for the Windsor Spitfires and Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds of the Ontario Hockey League. He was selected in the first round (11th overall) by the Dallas Stars in the 2010 NHL Entry Draft and made his NHL debut in 2013. After spending several years in the minors, Campbell was traded to the Los Angeles Kings, serving as the team's backup before joining the Toronto Maple Leafs in 2020, where he emerged as an effective starting netminder and was named an NHL All-Star in 2022. He left Toronto after the 2021–22 season to sign with the Oilers. On November 8, 2023, he was waived by the Edmonton Oilers and assigned to their AHL affiliate, the Condors.\nInternationally, Campbell has represented the United States at both a junior and senior level. During the 2010 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, Campbell backstopped the Americans to a victory over the Canadians in the gold medal game.\nEarly life.\nCampbell was born on January 9, 1992, in Port Huron, Michigan, to parents Jack Sr. and Debbie. Campbell was inspired by his older cousin Marshall to become a goaltender. Although his father, uncle, and coaches tried to convince Campbell to play other positions, he continued as a goaltender.\nPlaying career.\nAmateur.\nAs a youth, Campbell played in the 2005 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with the Detroit Little Caesars minor ice hockey team. Little Caesars lost the first game of the tournament 2-0 to Burnaby, placing them in the losers' bracket. From there, they would go on to win the tournament, defeating Detroit Compuware in the finals.\nHe eventually graduated to the Detroit Honeybaked midget team. From there, Campbell was drafted 108th overall in the 2008 Ontario Hockey League Priority Selection. Despite his selection, Campbell joined the USA Hockey National Team Development Program (NTDP) in 2008. In his second season within the North American Hockey League (NAHL), Campbell received the Dave Peterson Goalie of the Year Award.\nOn November 24, 2009, Campbell withdrew his verbal intent to play Division 1 hockey for the University of Michigan Wolverines in order to qualify to play in the OHL. By the conclusion of his two seasons with the NTDP, Campbell had set a new franchise record for lowest goals-against average and most shutouts in a career. He also earned a gold medal for Team USA at the 2009 IIHF World U18 Championships and 2010 IIHF World U18 Championships. As a result, Campbell was drafted 11th overall by the Dallas Stars in the 2010 NHL Entry Draft. Campbell was also chosen in the seventh round (170th overall) by Dinamo Minsk in the 2010 Kontinental Hockey League Junior Draft.\nOHL.\nOn July 28, 2010, Campbell left the NTDP and joined the Windsor Spitfires who had drafted him in 2008. He struggled in his first season, putting up poor numbers and was eventually traded to the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds for MacKenzie Braid, Patrick Sieloff, a 2012 third-round pick, a 2013 second- and third-round pick, two second-round picks in 2014, a second-round pick in 2015 and a conditional 15th-round pick in 2016.\nProfessional.\nDallas Stars.\nFollowing the conclusion of the 2011–12 season with the Greyhounds, the Stars assigned Campbell to their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Texas Stars. On March 23, he made his professional debut against the Oklahoma City Barons in a loss. Two nights later, on March 25, he won his first professional game against the Toronto Marlies. He made 32 saves on the way to a 4–2 win. On March 30, he had his first professional shutout over the Lake Erie Monsters by making 30 saves in the 4–0 win.\nAfter attending the Stars' training camp, Campbell was assigned to the American Hockey League to begin the 2013–14 season. On October 20, 2013, Campbell was recalled from Texas and made his NHL debut with Dallas, posting a 6–3 loss against the Anaheim Ducks. He was returned to the American Hockey League where he helped lead the Stars to the 2014 Calder Cup.\nDespite his championship season, Campbell was assigned to the American Hockey League to begin the 2014–15 season after attending the Stars' training camp. Prior to the 2015–16 season, Campbell injured his hand which delayed his season debut. Upon his return to the lineup, Campbell went 1–3–0 in each of his starts. However, on December 28, 2015, Campbell was reassigned to the Texas Stars' East Coast Hockey League (ECHL) affiliate, Idaho Steelheads for an undetermined amount of time. Campbell describes this time as difficult for his mental health and he felt unmotivated to play hockey. He said he would \"view myself in the mirror as like if I'm a good or bad person based on if I won or lost.\" However, upon his return to the American Hockey League, Campbell recorded 11 wins out of 14 starts.\nLos Angeles Kings.\nUnable to progress within the Stars organization, on June 25, 2016, Campbell was traded to the Los Angeles Kings for defenseman Nick Ebert. On July 11, 2016, Campbell signed as a restricted free agent to a two-year, two-way contract with the Kings. On November 22, 2017, he signed a two-year contract extension with the Kings. On February 27, 2018, Campbell made 41 saves and earned his first NHL win in a 4–1 victory over the Vegas Golden Knights. On October 11, 2018, Campbell recorded his first NHL shutout with 40 saves against the Montreal Canadiens. He developed a friendship with fellow goaltender Jonathan Quick and accompanied him to the 2018 NHL Awards as his \"backup\", carrying a towel and water bottle with him.\nHis success was short lived, however, as he suffered a knee injury on November 10. At the time of his injury, Campbell had played in 13 games with a 5–7–0 record. On December 19, the Kings assigned Campbell to the Ontario Reign on a conditioning assignment. He was recalled from the Reign on December 31, 2018, and started the Kings following game on January 1, 2019, against the Vegas Golden Knights.\nOn September 7, 2019, the Kings re-signed Campbell to a two-year, $3.3 million contract extension.\nToronto Maple Leafs.\nOn February 5, 2020, the Kings traded Campbell (alongside Kyle Clifford) to the Toronto Maple Leafs for Trevor Moore, a third-round pick in 2020, and a conditional third-round pick in 2021. He made his Maple Leafs debut on February 7, resulting in a 5–4 overtime win against the Anaheim Ducks.\nInitially acquired to strengthen team goaltending depth and serve as a backup to starting netminder Frederik Andersen, Campbell quickly emerged as a skilled goalie in Toronto and became the team's starter the following season, overtaking Andersen's role through strong play. Following his arrival in Toronto, Campbell experienced much success and became a fan favourite, setting several records and joining the league leaders in goaltending statistics. On April 7, 2021, Campbell set a Maple Leafs record for consecutive wins by a goaltender, with 10. The previous franchise record of 9 was shared by Felix Potvin, Jacques Plante and John Ross Roach. He additionally tied the league record with Montreal Canadiens goalie Carey Price for consecutive wins to start a season, and later setting a new and final record of 11 in the following game on April 10, 2021, when the Leafs beat the Ottawa Senators 6–5. Campbell would remain the team's starter for the rest of the season, helping them qualify for the playoffs, where he would make his post-season debut. Despite strong play from the netminder, the team would lose in the opening round, three games to four against the Montreal Canadiens.\nCampbell continued his strong play the following season, remaining the team's starter and elevating himself to be among the leaders in several goaltending categories. On November 2, 2021, he achieved the fifth shutout of his career against the Golden Knights. Campbell's success in Toronto was rewarded when, on January 13, 2022, he was selected for the 2022 NHL All-Star Game, his first NHL all star game, along with teammate Auston Matthews. At the time of his selection to the game, Campbell had a record of 18–5–3 with a .935 save percentage (second in the league for goaltenders) and a 2.02 goals-against average. Following the All-Star break, Campbell's play pronouncedly declined, coinciding with ongoing struggles of his tandem partner Petr Mrazek that put the Maple Leafs' goaltending into question. A February 26 game against the Detroit Red Wings was widely identified as the nadir, with Campbell giving up four goals in six minutes in the third period and being pulled, while Mrazek and both Red Wings goalies also struggled, leading to a 10–7 Leafs victory. In March, it was announced that Campbell was dealing with a rib injury and would miss several weeks. In his absence, Mrazek was also injured, greatly expanding the role of Marlies goaltender Erik Källgren. Campbell returned to the crease for the remainder of the season, and saw his play improve. He finished the regular season with a 31–9–6 record and a .914 save percentage. The Leafs entered the 2022 Stanley Cup playoffs for a round one matchup with the Tampa Bay Lightning. Campbell was considered a key factor opposite Vezina- and Conn Smythe Trophy-winning Lightning goaltender Andrei Vasilevskiy. In a closely fought series, the Leafs were eventually eliminated in seven games.\nWith the conclusion of Campbell's contract, he was seen as one of the strongest free agent goaltenders available, and it was perceived as unlikely that the Maple Leafs would re-sign him at his desired price and term. Days prior to the opening of free agency it was announced that the Leafs had traded for Ottawa Senators goaltender Matt Murray, which was widely taken as confirmation that Campbell would not be returning.\nEdmonton Oilers.\nOn July 13, 2022, Campbell signed as a free agent to a five-year, $25 million contract with the Edmonton Oilers.\nCampbell's first year with the Oilers was disappointing, and his poor play led rookie netminder Stuart Skinner to quickly beat Campbell to earn the Oilers starting job over him. Although he ultimately posted a winning record, Campbell finished the season with a .888 save percentage amid widespread criticism of his play. Campbell's poor play continued into the 2023–24 season and on November 7, 2023, Campbell was waived by the Oilers for the purpose of assigning him to the American Hockey League. Unclaimed by any team on waivers, Campbell was assigned to the Bakersfield Condors; he made his debut with the team on November 9, 2023, allowing 4 goals on 20 shots.\nInternational play.\nCampbell represented the United States numerous times over the course of his career, but his most memorable youth international competition was the 2010 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships where he backstopped the Americans to an upset victory over the host Canadians in the gold medal game. For his efforts, he was named Goaltender of the Tournament. Following this tournament, he was again invited to the USA Hockey National Junior Evaluation Camp prior to the 2012 IIHF World Junior Championship.\nCampbell finally made his international senior debut during the 2015 Men's Ice Hockey World Championships where Team USA won bronze.\nPersonal life.\nOn June 24, 2022, Campbell got engaged to his girlfriend Ashley Sonnenberg."

He played in one game for the Nationals that season and did not have an at-bat. It is not known whether he batted or fielded with either his left or right hand. Some games or websites list George Joyce as right-handed, however this is because of the lack of information on the player.\nProfessional career.\nGeorge Joyce, at the age of 38-39 (unknown due to lack of birth date, only birth year), played on the Washington Nationals team that spanned from 1886-1889. He played center field during the only game of his career on August 14, 1886, against the Philadelphia Quakers, and never got up to bat. He was the second oldest player on the team, only behind Joe Start, and was at the time the oldest player to make his debut in the post-1876 major leagues as a position player."

They play at James M. Shuart Stadium in Hempstead, New York.\nHistory.\nHofstra fielded its first varsity men's lacrosse team in 1949, hiring Howdy Myers the following season from Johns Hopkins to take over the program. Myers had previously won three national titles with Hopkins.\nMyers quickly got the program to a high level, where in 1955 Hofstra was 14 and 2, and ranked 3rd in the country. Hofstra defeated Rutgers that season 16-6, to win the Division II national title, Laurie Cox Trophy.\nIn 1971 Myers guided the Flying Dutchmen, as the team was known then, to a 12–4 record a number 10 ranking, as well as an at large bid to the first-ever 1971 NCAA tournament.\nHofstra has made seventeen postseason appearances in the NCAA tournament reaching the quarterfinals four times, in 1993, 1999, 2001 and 2006. Hofstra closest effort at making the NCAA final four was in 2006, when they lost in overtime to Massachusetts in the NCAA Quarterfinals, 11–10, after UMass had come back from a 10–5 deficit in the 4th quarter.\nThe Pride were ranked second in the nation in 2006 and received a number three seed in the NCAA tournament. Coached by current Duke coach John Danowski, Hofstra won 17 straight games losing only their season opener and the quarterfinal match, both to Massachusetts.\nSeason Results.\nThe following is a list of Hofstra's results by season as an NCAA Division I program:\n†NCAA canceled 2020 collegiate activities due to the COVID-19 virus."

        "text": "Charles Alexander Jones (born January 12, 1962) is a retired American basketball player and current college basketball coach who played for four seasons in the National Basketball Association. Primarily a forward, he played for the Phoenix Suns, the Portland Trail Blazers, and the Washington Bullets during his NBA career.\nJones was born and raised in Scooba, Mississippi, where he attended East Kemper High School. An outstanding leaper, Jones still holds the rebound record for the Mississippi High School All-Star Game. He grabbed 29 rebounds in the 1980 Mississippi All-Star contest. Jones went on to the University of Louisville from 1980 to 1984, appearing in two Final Fours with the school during his career. He was named the most valuable player in the 1982 Mid-East Regional of the NCAA Tournament held in Birmingham, Alabama. He averaged over eleven points and nearly ten rebounds in his senior year.\nIn the 1984 NBA draft, Jones was selected in the second round by the Phoenix Suns. As a rookie, he appeared in 78 games, starting 14 of them, while averaging nearly eight-and-a-half points and over five rebounds per game. In his second season, he played in only 43 games, while starting 18 of them, in a season which saw his per-game numbers go down. After the season, he was released by Phoenix.\nAfter not being on a roster during most of the 1986–87 NBA season, Jones was signed to a contract by the Portland Trail Blazers with two games remaining in their season. He did not make an appearance with the Blazers during those final two games, nor during the postseason. He remained on the Blazers' roster for the 1987–88 season, but appeared sparingly, averaging only five minutes per game. At the end of the season, Portland released Jones.\nIn October 1988, Jones signed a contract with the Washington Bullets. To avoid confusion with the Bullets' starting center also named Charles Jones, he was known as Charles A. Jones while in Washington. He was waived at the end of the preseason, but was re-signed in December. As a Bullet, he appeared in 43 games, primarily serving as the team's 12th man. After a season in Washington, he went to Europe and played two seasons of basketball in Italy before retiring from the sport.\nAfter retiring from basketball, Jones moved to the Louisville area and became an officer with the Louisville Metro Police Department.\nFollowing his 2019 retirement from the LMPD, Jones took a position as a security officer with Spalding University, a small Catholic school in Louisville. In 2020, he took a second position as an assistant coach of Spalding's women's basketball team. According to a 2021 story published by local TV station WDRB, Jones was recruited \"not so subtly\" by newly hired Spalding head coach Kylee Gorby, who recalled telling Jones, \"I came over there one day with some women’s basketball gear and some paperwork and I said, 'Hey, no pressure at all, but these shirts are yours regardless, and here’s the paperwork.'\" Jones himself told WDRB, \"I think ... probably after the 10th or 12th time (she asked), I said, I’ll do it.\" He would add in the interview, \"The game has changed. It’s not the same game that I played, especially playing at the level I played. I’m not saying this is not a good level. It’s just different. I had been away from it for awhile, so it took a little getting used to being out there. But I enjoy it.\""

        "title": "Wellington Rowing Club",
        "text": "The Wellington Rowing Club is a rowing club situated on Wellington Harbour, New Zealand. The current building, is classified as a \"Category I\" (\"places of 'special or outstanding historical or cultural heritage significance or value'\") historic place by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust.\nHistory.\nThe Wellington Rowing Club was first established in October 1871 as a professional club. Founded by James Stewart, a prominent sawmiller \"the main reason for forming the new club was to enable ‘working men’ to take part in aquatic sports\".\nThe most famous crew of the Wellington Rowing Club was the Dolly Varden crew. Imported in 1873, the \"Dolly Varden\" became the most famous four-oared boat in colonial New Zealand. The \"Dolly Varden\" was the first boat in New Zealand with sliding seats. In this boat the crew of H Woods (stroke), J Walker (3), William Hearn (rower) (2), M Moore (bow) won the Interprovincial Championship of New Zealand in 1876, and H Woods (stroke), J Walker (3), J McGrath (2), William Hearn (rower) (bow) won in 1877.\nThe \"Dolly Varden\" was later sold and by 1880 the Wellington Rowing Club (professional), as then constituted, went out of existence.\nThe Wellington Rowing Club was later re-established as an amateur club in July 1885 by James Stewart. 2010 marked the 125th anniversary of the amateur club.\nClub colours.\nThe club's colours consist of a maroon singlet with a white horizontal band. The original colours of the club when it was established in 1885 were (salmon) pink and white. The club commemorated these origins by changing back to the original colours for the 125th season (2009/10).\nClubhouse.\nThe WRC building has been housed in a number of locations throughout its 125-year history. The club opened its first permanent clubhouse at the bottom of Cuba Street, Wellington on 17 December 1887. Later in 1889, due to ongoing harbour reclamations, the clubhouse was moved \"some little distance seaward\" to its site just north of Jervois Quay. This was the home for the club until 1931.\nWellington Naval Artillery Volunteers.\n Built in 1894 to a design by Frederick de Jersey Clere, the building was built as a base for the Wellington Naval Artillery Volunteers, a response prompted by a Defence report in 1884 that recommended strengthening Wellington's harbour defences to help prevent a possible Russian invasion.\nThe building was never used for this purpose and in 1927 the building became the first home of the Wellington Free Ambulance. After a short stay, the Free Ambulance moved into its new purpose-built home (now St. John Heineken Hotel). At the same time the Wellington Rowing Club took over as custodian of the 'Old Navals Hall' in 1931 and remains such to this day.\nFamous Members.\nThe Wellington Rowing Club boasts numerous international representatives and Olympic medalists.\nNew Zealand's first international sculling representative was William Bridson. Bridson won the Amateur Sculling Championship of Victoria in 1891.\nTom Sullivan, along with Bridson, was a member of the famous WRC crew who won all eight Rowing New Zealand (then New Zealand Amateur Rowing Association) championship titles between 1889 and 1890. Sullivan has been recognised as “New Zealand's first sculler of international note”. Sullivan left the club in 1890 to become a professional sculler. He was the first New Zealander to challenge for the World Sculling Championship. In 1893 he won the English Sculling Championship.\nGeorge Lauchlan was the manager of the famous 1925 New Zealand eight that travelled to Australia and won the New South Wales Championship.\nTris Hegglun and Owen Wares were members of the club before World War II. During the war they represented the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) which beat the Cairo River Club and an all-Egyptian representative crew to win the Freyberg Cup. Today the Sir Bernard Freyberg Cup is allocated to the champion single sculls at the New Zealand National Club Championships.\nWRC's 'golden era' was without doubt the 1960s and 1970s. The club won the Champion Eight event in 1967 and 1969. The club later won the Boss Rooster in 1972.\nPete Delaney was the club's first Olympian, representing New Zealand at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics.\nIn 1967 the New Zealand \"All Blacks\" crew, including WRC members Pete Delaney (Bow), Graeme Shaw (2), Tom Just (3), John Hunter (5) and Alan Boykett (cox), won the first FISA North American Championships, St. Catharines, Canada, and the USRowing National Championships, Philadelphia.\nIn 1968 John Hunter (5) and Tom Just (2) represented New Zealand in the eight at the 1968 Summer Olympics which finished fourth.\nJohn Hunter (5) and Simon Dickie (cox) were members of the New Zealand eight that won gold at the USRowing National Championships in 1970, the FISA European Championships, Copenhagen, Denmark, the International German Championships, Duisburg, West Germany and the International Austrian Championships, Klagenfurt, Austria in 1971.\nAt the 1972 Summer Olympics Dick Joyce (6), John Hunter (5) and Simon Dickie (cox) won the eight-oar event with Ross Collinge (2) winning a silver in the coxless four event.\nAt the 1976 Summer Olympics, Alec McLean and Simon Dickie won a bronze in the eight-oar event."

After a visit from players of CASI, rugby was chosen.\nThe rugby section of CGE La Plata officially opened and registered with the Unión de Rugby de Buenos Aires in 1925. Eight years later, football became professional in Argentina and URBA decided that rugby teams could not be part of professional clubs as rugby is an amateur sport in Argentina.\nIn 1934, the rugby section of Club Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata unmerged to become an independent club. Five years later the club would change its name to \"La Plata Rugby Club\" and severe all remaining ties with Gimnasia y Esgrima.\nLa Plata Rugby Club is the leading rugby club in La Plata with more than 1,000 players and 4,500 members. Many players have gone on to play for the national team and professional clubs in Europe.\nNowadays the club plays at the highest level of URBA's league system, fielding teams at all levels."

Brazil were the winners, winning by ten goals to five. Brazil have beaten fifteen other teams to be crowned \"FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup 2009 Winners\". It was Brazil's fourth title in a row.\nRoads to the final.\nSwitzerland.\nSwitzerland started their campaign in group D, along with winners Brazil, with a close win against the Bahrain, winning 6–5. Switzerland confirmed their place in the quarter-finals by beating Nigeria in their second game 7-2 and taking themselves up to 6 points. In Switzerland's final they lost 4–2 to Brazil suggesting a Brazil win for the final. Therefore, Switzerland finished second in group D.\nAs Switzerland were the runners-up of group B, they met the winners of group C, Russia in the quarter-finals. The game was closely tied but Switzerland sealed their victory with a late goal to win 4–2. This saw Switzerland move on to play Uruguay national beach soccer team in the semi-finals.\nThe semi-final was a stronger performance by the Swiss. Going into the third period with a 4–1 lead, they never looked like the team that would lose and despite Uruguay's best efforts, they never even got back on level terms allowing Switzerland to win 7-4 and move on comfortably into the final against 12-time winners, Brazil.\nBrazil.\nBrazil started their world cup campaign as defending champions, in group D, along with Switzerland, comfortably beating Nigeria 11–5, with a hat-trick from Bruno and seven different scorers in all. Brazil continued to perform with an 8–1 win against Bahrain, the same result as against Japan at this stage of the competition in 2008, with Buru this time claiming four goals. Finally, Brazil finished off with a decent 4–2 win against Switzerland, who they would eventually beat in the final, finishing on top of the group with 9 points.\nIn the quarter-finals, Brazil played the runners-up of group C, Italy, who they beat in last years final. Italy may have been up for revenge but despite a challenge for Brazil, a hat-trick from André helped Brazil onto a 6–4 win to progress on into the semi-finals. In the semi-finals Brazil met Portugal, again, at the same stage they did last year. However, despite the epic 5–4 win for Brazil last time, this match was much more one sided and with seven unique scorers yet again, Brazil eased past Portugal, 8–2, to make it to another final."

        "title": "1993 College Baseball All-America Team",
        "text": "An All-American team is an honorary sports team composed of the best amateur players of a specific season for each position—who in turn are given the honorific \"All-America\" and typically referred to as \"All-American athletes\", or simply \"All-Americans\". Although the honorees generally do not compete as a unit, the term is used in U.S. team sports to refer to players who are selected by members of the national media. Walter Camp selected the first All-America team in the early days of American football in 1889. In 1950, the American Baseball Coaches Association (ABCA) selected its first All-American baseball team. It has since chosen All-American teams and a player of the year for each division (National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I, Division II, Division III, National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics, junior college and high school). \"Collegiate Baseball\" selects All-American, Freshman All-American and High School All-American teams. \"Baseball America\" magazine selects pre-season and post-season All-American teams and College Player of the Year honorees.\nVarious organizations selected All-American lists of the best players for the 1993 NCAA Division I college baseball season. The ABCA, the magazine \"Baseball America\", and \"Collegiate Baseball\" were the NCAA-sanctioned selectors. This list only includes players selected to the post-season All-American first team for each selector. However, many All-American selections choose second, third, etc. teams from the remaining eligible candidates.\nAccomplishments.\nThe 1993 All-American class featured three Major League Baseball All-Stars, one Major League Baseball record holder and three World Series champions. Jason Varitek remained active. A total of eight players were selected by all three NCAA-sanctioned selectors: pitchers Dan Choi, and Brian Anderson; catcher Varitek; first baseman Ryan McGuire; second baseman Todd Walker; shortstop Mark Loretta; outfielders Eric Danapilis and Brooks Kieschnick.\nKieschnick was both a 1991 and 1992 selection. He won the 1992 &amp; 1993 Dick Howser Trophy, while Varitek won it in 1994. Varitek was honored by all three selectors in 1992 and 1994 and was player of the year in 1994. Walker, who won the 1993 College World Series Most Outstanding Player, was selected by all three organizations in 1994. Darren Dreifort repeated as a selection from the 1992 team. He won the 1993 Rotary Smith Award and the 1993 Golden Spikes Award, and Varitek won both awards in 1994. Both Arizona State and Texas A&amp;M had two players included on the team.\nWalker led the National League second basemen in fielding percentage and putouts during the 2002 Major League Baseball season. Loretta was selected for the 2004 MLB All-Star Game. During the 2004 season he led the National League in sacrifice flies and led National League second basemen in assists. Loretta was later selected to the 2006 MLB All-Star Game. During the 2000 season he led National League shortstops in fielding percentage. He accumulated over 1700 career hits and won a Silver Slugger in 2004. Varitek is a three-time MLB All-Star (2003, 2005 &amp; 2008), Gold Glove-winner, Silver Slugger-winner and two-time World Series champion (2004 &amp; 2007). He has called the pitches for a major league record four no-hitters. Paul Lo Duca had the most All-Star game selections of players in the 1993 All-America class with four (2003, 2004, 2005 &amp; 2006). In 2002 and 2003, he led National League catchers in putouts, assists and runners caught stealing. However, in 2004 and 2005 he allowed the most stolen bases and in 2003, 2005 and 2006, he committed the most errors among catchers. In 1998, Brian Anderson led the National League with the fewest bases on balls per 9 innings pitched (1.039), but surrendered the most home runs (39). That season, he was a member of the inaugural Arizona Diamondbacks roster. He was also a member of the Diamondbacks' 2001 World Series Championship team along with 1993 All-American Troy Brohawn.\nKey.\nAll-Americans.\nBelow are the Division I players selected to the various NCAA-sanctioned lists. The default list order is arranged by the position numbers used by official baseball scorekeepers (i.e., , , etc.)."

        "text": "This is a list of all four Jiminy Cricket educational series that originally aired on \"The Mickey Mouse Club\" TV series. Each series features Jiminy Cricket, Pinocchio's conscience, providing general education and science information in an entertaining and accessible manner. The series also have a strong focus on the importance of books and learning on one's own. The \"I'm No Fool\" and \"You\" series were later updated in the 1980s and 1990s as stand-alone shorts, and were shown in schools and occasionally on the Disney Channel.\n\"I'm No Fool\" series.\nEach short is less than 10 minutes in runtime and begins and ends with the theme song, \"I'm No Fool\", with the lyrics to the closing number reworked to include the lessons taught during the short. Jiminy presents each hypothetical situation by drawing chalk outlines of the primary participants (usually a stereotypical, Family Circus-esque American boy) on a black board. The drawings then come to life and get into various questionable situations, with Jiminy steering them in the right direction.\nFilmography.\n(*) = Updated in the mid through late 1980s with additional live-action footage\n\"You and Your\" series.\nSimilarly to the \"I'm No Fool\" series above, Jiminy Cricket teaches children about the human body.\nFilmography.\n(*) = Updated in the mid through late 1980s with additional live-action footage\n\"Nature of Things\" series.\nJiminy Cricket teaches children about the animals of nature, in a similar manner to the \"I'm No Fool\" series. This series also had live-action footage lifted from \"True-Life Adventures\", and was also known as \"Animal Autobiography\". Generally these had only intro sequence featuring Jiminy Cricket, while the rest was live-action of real animals. \n\"Encyclopedia\" series.\nJiminy Cricket teaches children how to spell, also in a similar manner to the \"I'm No Fool\" series. The series had a catchy theme song from which many children learned to spell \"encyclopedia\", most likely inspired by Paul Whiteman's novelty hit, \"C-O-N-S-T-A-N-T-I-N-O-P-L-E\" (both songs even had the same tempo and meter). At least five or six shorts aired under the Encyclopedia's banner featured Jiminy Cricket. Additionally further nine Mickey Mouse Club Newsreel Specials were aired under the Encyclopedia banner but didn't feature Jiminy Cricket.\nEducational film.\nIn 1984, Disney Educational Productions released a film called \"Jiminy Cricket, P.S. (Problem Solver)\" which recycles animation from other Disney shorts. The film was 10 minutes long, and also stars Goofy, Donald Duck, and Ludwig Von Drake. It was originally released on VHS."

The 32 national teams involved in the tournament were required to register a squad of 23 players; only players in these squads were eligible to take part in the tournament.\nBefore announcing their final squad for the tournament, teams were required to name a preliminary squad of 30 players by 11 May 2010, 30 days before the start of the tournament. With the exception of those involved in the 2010 UEFA Champions League Final, the players listed in the preliminary squad were then subjected to a mandatory rest period from 17 to 23 May 2010. The preliminary squad would then have to be cut to a final 23 by 1 June 2010 (midnight CET). Replacement of seriously injured players is permitted until 24 hours before the team in question's first World Cup game, though replacement players do not have to be drawn from the preliminary squad.\nPlayers marked (c) were named as captain for their national squad. Number of caps, players' club teams and players' age as of 11 June 2010, the tournament's opening day.\nFor the first time in World Cup history, all teams had at least one player from a European club (North Korea being the only team with just one, Hong Yong-jo).

        "title": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1877",
        "text": "Derbyshire Country Cricket Club in 1877 was the cricket season when the English club Derbyshire played their seventh season.\nYorkshire joined Hampshire, Lancashire and Kent as the fourth county to play Derbyshire. John Platts became the first cricketer to score a century for Derbyshire.\n1877 season.\nAll Derbyshire's matches were first class in the 1877 season. They played eight county games, two each against Yorkshire, Lancashire, Kent and Hampshire, and one match against MCC. They won five matches, beating Kent and Hampshire in both matches and Lancashire in one. They lost three matches – one each to Yorkshire, Lancashire and MCC – and drew their other match against Yorkshire\nThe captain for the year was Robert Smith. Of the players who made their debuts, Leonard Jackson a publican, and Arthur Forman, a Repton schoolmaster both continued playing regularly for five years while Thomas Mycroft appeared occasionally as wicket keeper over the next ten years. Charles Regan a brewer's traveller played his five career first class matches during the season.\nRev William Humble who had played occasionally since 1873 put in his last appearance for the club. Amos Hind who failed to live up to the promise of his initial 1876 season, also left the side.\nIn their opening match against Lancashire, Derbyshire opened with 111 to which Lancashire replied with 84. Although Derbyshire only managed 51 in their second innings, Lancashire fared worse with 44 to give Derbyshire a 34 run victory. Against Hampshire, Derbyshire made 115 in the first innings and Hampshire scored 105 in response. Derbyshire's second innings reached 242, although no player scored 50 or more. Hampshire were only able to make 63 in reply giving Derbyshire a 189 run victory. Against MCC, Derbyshire were playing a side which included W G Grace who made 83 runs and took 14 wickets. In the first innings MCC made 112, being checked by Mycroft who took 8 wickets while Derbyshire replied with 117. In the second innings MCC made 123 while Derbyshire made 78 to lose by 40 runs. In their second match against Lancashire, Lancashire set an opening target of 215 and Derbyshire made 110 in reply and 114 in the follow-on. Lancashire made the necessary 10 runs to win by 10 wickets. Against Kent, Kent made 191 in the first innings due to 80 by Lord Harris and Derbyshire replied with 127. In Kent's second innings Harris was out for a duck and Kent made 124, while Derbyshire's reply of 189 thanks to 54 not out by Foster gave them the match by one wicket. George Gibbons Hearne took 14 wickets for Kent in the match. In Derbyshire's first County match against Yorkshire, Yorkshire scored 210 and Derbyshire who made 108 were forced to follow on. Derbyshire's second innings total of 189 left Yorkshire with 88 to make which they achieved with the loss of one wicket. In the second Kent match, Kent made 149 in the first innings and Derbyshire replied with 110. Kent's second innings score was 78 and Derbyshire reached 119 to win with three wickets to spare. In the second Hampshire match Hampshire opened with 120 and Derbyshire ran up 319 in reply. Although both R Smith and Rigley were injured in the innings this was compensated for by a score of 115 by Platt. Hampshire scored 86 in their second innings to give Derbyshire a victory by an innings and 113 runs. In the final match against Yorkshire, Yorkshire began with 278 and with a first innings reply of 74, Derbyshire had to follow-on needing over 200. However Derbyshire made 220 with 90 not out by Platt to save the match as a draw, and as there was insufficient time for Yorkshire to bat.\nJohn Platts was top scorer and W Mycroft took most wickets with 63. Platts was also the first Derbyshire cricketer to score a century for the club.\nMatches.\nMycroft took an additional 94 first class wickets for other teams"

        "text": "The men's épée was one of seven fencing events on the fencing at the 1932 Summer Olympics programme. It was the eighth appearance of the event. The competition was held from 8 August 1932 to 9 August 1932. 28 fencers from 12 nations competed, with three others entered but not starting. A maximum of three fencers per nation could compete. The event was won by Giancarlo Cornaggia-Medici of Italy, with his countryman Carlo Agostoni taking bronze. They were the first medals for Italy in the men's individual épée. France reached the podium for the fourth consecutive Games in the event with Georges Buchard's silver. Buchard was the third man to win multiple medals in the event, repeating his second-place finish from 1928.\nBackground.\nThis was the eighth appearance of the event, which was not held at the first Games in 1896 (with only foil and sabre events held) but has been held at every Summer Olympics since 1900.\nTwo of the 10 finalists from the 1928 Games returned: silver medalist (and 1924 finalist) Georges Buchard of France and bronze medalist George Calnan of the United States. Buchard was the reigning (1931) World Champion; he had also won in 1927 and would win again in 1933. He and fellow French fencer Philippe Cattiau, the 1929 and 1930 World Champion, were the favorites in the event. \nFor the first time, no nations made their debut in the event. Belgium and the United States each appeared for the seventh time, tied for most among nations.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition format continued the pool play round-robin from prior years, but increased the number of touches to win a bout to 3. With fewer fencers than in prior Games, the number of rounds was reduced from four to three. A point system was used, with 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie, and 0 points for a loss. The total number of touches received was used as the first tie-breaker. Touches scored was used as the second in the final. It also was apparently used in the earlier rounds for the most part, though the official placing for 8th and 9th in round 1 pool 1 is inconsistent.\nResults.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe top 7 finishers in pools 1 and 2 and the top 6 finishers in pool 3 advanced to the semifinals.\nQuarterfinal 1.\nIt is unclear why Markus is ranked ahead of Corbin; being equal on points and touches received, Corbin's touches scored should have ranked him higher.\nQuarterfinal 2.\n5 bouts in the round-robin were skipped (Agostini-Schmetz, Agostini-Saucedo, Saucedo-de Graffenried, Poplimont-Calnan, and Poplimont-Petneházy).\nThe Official Report lists the bout between Farrell and Delgadillo as 2–2, but Sports-Reference reports a 3–2 Farrell win. The latter is consistent with Farrell having 7 points, as reported in both sources, and Delgadillo having 4, as listed in Sports-Reference. The Official Report lists Delgadillo as having 6 points, which is inconsistent with either a tie or loss. Both sources, however, list Delgadillo as having received 26 touches; if the result of the bout was 3–2 for Farrell, this number should be 27.\nThe Official Report does not explain why Lindman advanced to the semifinals rather than Farrell.\nSemifinals.\nThe top six finishers in each semifinal advanced to the final.\nSemifinal 1.\nTwo bouts were not played: De Beukelaer-de Jong and Cattiau-Saucedo.\nBoth the Official Report and Sports-Reference credit De Beukelaer with 10 points; however, the head-to-head data shown by each has him winning 6 bouts and losing 2, which should result in 12 points."

The event was won by Gustavo Marzi of Italy, the nation's third victory in the men's foil (and first since 1920). His countryman Giulio Gaudini took bronze for the second consecutive Games, becoming the fourth man to win multiple medals in the event. Joe Levis gave the United States its first men's foil medal with his silver.\nBackground.\nThis was the eighth appearance of the event, which has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1908 (when there was a foil display only rather than a medal event). Four of the 1928 finalists returned: silver medalist Erwin Casmir of Germany, bronze medalist Giulio Gaudini of Italy, fifth-place finisher (and 1920 and 1924 silver medalist) Philippe Cattiau of France, and eleventh-place finisher Joe Levis of the United States. Another significant Olympic veteran was 1928 semifinalist Ivan Joseph Martin Osiier of Denmark; Osiier was competing in the Games for the sixth time of his eventual seven. The favorite was Gustavo Marzi of Italy. Gaudini, who had won the world championship in 1930, was also a significant contender. The 1931 world champion, René Lemoine, had failed to make the French team.\nCanada and Mexico each made their debut in the men's foil. The United States made its seventh appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the inaugural 1896 competition.\nCompetition format.\nThe event used a three-round format. In each round, the fencers were divided into pools to play a round-robin within the pool. Bouts were to five touches. Not all bouts were played in some pools if not necessary to determine advancement. Bout wins were used for placement, regardless of losses if fencers had competed in a different number of bouts (e.g., 3–3 Gorordo and 3–2 Every were tied in the first round). Touches against was used as the tie-breaker. Standard foil rules were used, including that touches had to be made with the tip of the foil, the target area was limited to the torso, and priority determined the winner of double touches.\nResults.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe top 6 finishers in each pool advanced to the semifinals.\nSemifinals.\nThe top 5 finishers in each semifinal advanced to the final."

The competition was held from 12 August 1932 to 13 August 1932. 25 fencers from 12 nations competed. Five additional fencers entered but did not start. Each nation was limited to three fencers. The event was won by György Piller of Hungary, the third of nine straight Games in which a Hungarian would win the event. Giulio Gaudini of Italy took silver, while another Hungarian (Endre Kabos) earned bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the ninth appearance of the event, which is the only fencing event to have been held at every Summer Olympics. Three of the twelve finalists from 1928 returned: silver medalist Attila Petschauer of Hungary, sixth-place finisher Erwin Casmir of Germany, and seventh-place finisher Arturo De Vecchi of Italy. The reigning gold medalist, Ödön Tersztyánszky, had been killed in a car accident in 1929. György Piller of Hungary was the two-time reigning world champion and favored among a strong Hungarian team.\nCanada, Mexico, and Poland each made their debut in the men's sabre. Italy and Denmark each made their seventh appearance in the event, tied for most of any nation, each having missed two of the first three events but having appeared every Games since 1908.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition format was a round-robin for each pool, with three rounds (preliminary, semifinals, and final). Bouts were to five touches. Pool placement depended on bouts won; not all bouts in a round-robin were played if unnecessary to determine qualification for the next round; Erwin Casmir, for example, fenced only three bouts rather than seven in an eight-person preliminary pool because his three wins were sufficient to put him in fourth place and qualify him for the semifinals. Touches against was typically used as a tie-breaker for placement (including breaking a tie for the bronze medal), but fence-off barrages were used to determine qualification in the semifinals.\nResults.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe top six fencers in each pool qualified for the semifinals.\nSemifinals.\nThe top five fencers in each semifinal advanced to the final.\nSemifinal 2.\nThe three-way tie for fourth place was broken through a barrage rather than by touches against. Cohn-Armitage placed first in that barrage (fourth in the overall pool), with Salafia second (fifth overall) and Bruder third (sixth overall, and not qualified for the final). The Official Report contains no explanation why Piot, who won no bouts, was ranked higher than Haro, who won one."

The competition was held from 10 August 1932 to 11 August 1932. 32 fencers from six nations competed. Each team could have a maximum of six fencers, with four participating in any given match. France and Cuba entered, but withdrew before competition.\nThe competition format continued the pool play round-robin from prior years. Each of the four fencers from one team would face each of the four from the other, for a total of 16 bouts per match (with bouts unnecessary to determining the match winner sometimes not being played). The team that won more bouts won the match. Matches not necessary to determining qualification were not played.\nResults.\nRound 1.\nThe top two teams in each pool advanced to the final. Cuba and France both withdrew, leaving the first pool with only two teams--automatically advancing both."

There was a crowd of 157,532 in attendance.\nContenders.\nViewed as one of the most competitive fields in years, there was no clear cut standout going into the race. Brother Derek, winner of four straight including the Santa Anita Derby, was made the morning line favorite at odds of 3:1 but drifted out to nearly 8:1 by post time. Meanwhile, Sweetnorthernsaint went from 10:1 on the morning line to the post-time favorite at 11:2 off of his win in the Illinois Derby. At 6:1, Barbaro was the second favorite based on his undefeated record including the Florida Derby. He was attempting to become the first horse since Needles in 1950 to win the Derby off of a five-week layoff. Other leading contenders included Lawyer Ron (Arkansas Derby), Showing Up (Lexington Stakes) and Sinister Minister (Blue Grass Stakes).\nResults.\nKeyed Entry went to the early lead challenged by Sinister Minister, and set a fast early pace. Barbaro stumbled at the start and bumped with Bob and John, then was carried three wide into the first turn. Still racing wide, he started to make up ground on the far turn and hit the lead with a quarter of a mile remaining. He continued to open up ground and won by lengths over Bluegrass Cat, with Steppenwolfer closing late for third. Jazil and Brother Derek deadheated for fourth.\nIt was the first Derby winner for all of Barbaro's connections: trainer Michael Matz, jockey Edgar Prado and owners Roy and Gretchen Jackson of Lael Stable. Barbaro's margin of victory was the longest since Assault in 1946. He became just the sixth horse to win the Derby while still undefeated.\nTrack condition: Fast\nTimes: mile – 22.63; mile – 46.07; mile – 1:10.88; mile – 1:37.02; final – 2:01.36.&lt;br&gt;\nSplits for each quarter-mile: (22.63) (23.44) (24.81) (26.14) (24.34)\nSource: Equibase Chart\nSubsequent racing careers.\nBarbaro fractured a leg in his next start, the Preakness Stakes, and died after a lengthy battle to save him. His ashes are buried at Churchill Downs below a bronze statue of him winning the Derby.\nSeveral other horses from the field went on to record Grade I wins:\nNone of the participants in the 2006 Derby went on to become major sires. The most consistent was Bluegrass Cat, who ranked 35th on the 2016 general sire listing for example despite not having a Grade I winner. The best sire from the crop of 2003 proved to be Bernardini, who bypassed the Derby."

Nottinghamshire had played informal matches against Derbyshire in previous seasons, and joined Lancashire and Kent to make a third County side playing first class matches against Derbyshire in 1875. Nottinghamshire dropped out again in the 1876 season, to be replaced by Hampshire.\n1875 season.\nAll Derbyshire's matches in the season were first class as they played Nottinghamshire with a normal eleven man side in two matches as well as Kent and Lancashire. They also had a match against a United North of England Eleven. After an unbeaten season in 1874 season, Derbyshire won two matches and lost four. They won both matches against Kent, lost both against Nottinghamshire, lost against United North of England and drew one match and lost the other against Lancashire.\nSamuel Richardson was in his fifth season as captain. George Hay, a cricket professional, made his first class debut in the season and became a regular player for several years. Henry Shaw who worked as a painter for the Midland Railway, also made his debut. Although he only played one match in 1875, he went on to play further seasons for Derbyshire. Both Hay and Shaw had appeared in a minor game for Derbyshire in 1874. George Bradley, a house painter, and Dick Barlow, better known for his cricket career with Lancashire, each made their single career first class appearances during the season.\nIn Derbyshire's opening match in May against Nottinghamshire, Nottinghamshire made 135 in the first innings and Derbyshire responded with 125. Nottinghamshire made 205 in their second innings. Hickton, who had bowled 36 overs and taken four wickets in the first inning, only bowled 20 overs in the second and was unable to bat through injury. A Derbyshire side, with one man down, managed 122 before being all out in the second innings 93 runs behind. In the second match, against Lancashire, Lancashire opened with 182 and Derbyshire made 129 in reply. Lancashire were all out for 68 in their second innings, but Derbyshire, with Shuker retired hurt, had only reached 77 before the close of play to leave the match a draw. Against Kent, Derbyshire made 307 to Kent's 131 and Kent were all out in their second innings for 113 saving Derbyshire the need to play again for an innings victory. In the next match, Lancashire opened with 240. Derbyshire made 121 and were called on to follow on. They were all out for 57 and it was their turn to lose by an innings. In the second match against Kent, Derbyshire made 213 and Kent managed 70 and 83 in their two innings to suffer an innings defeat again. In the second match against Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire replied to Nottinghamshire's 179 with 138. Nottinghamshire made 142 in the second innings, but Derbyshire were all out for 66 thanks to Shaw who achieved a hat-trick, and finished 117 runs behind. In the last match, the United North of England opened with 83 and Derbyshire made 56 in reply. The United North made 130 in the second innings and Derbyshire made 67 to lose by 90 runs.\nThomas Foster was top scorer and W Mycroft took most wickets with 73.

        "title": "Unassisted sailing",
        "text": "Unassisted sailing is a form of sailing, usually single-handed, where sailors are not given any physical assistance during the entire course of the voyage. Sailors may not call at a port, dock with other ships at sea, or be passed any physical objects from a passing ship or aircraft prior to reaching the end destination of their voyage.\nDefinition.\nUnassisted sailing definition and rules are widely recognised as those set by the World Sailing Speed Record Council rule 21e. Essentially this and the related 21h and 21i rules require that during the voyage:\nThe exceptions allowed by 21h and 21i are:\nIn practice.\nIn practice such sailors can receive financial and electronic assistance, especially when sponsored to attempt records, which reduces the burden of lack of physical assistance significantly. The Sydney Morning Herald said in this context: \nVendée Globe.\nThe Vendée Globe is a race, solo around the world non-stop from France. It has its own more strict rules. The participants can be given generally available weather forecasts, but not individual advice about weather or routing. All kinds of repair advice over radio is allowed, for the reason it is a sail competition, not a repair competition. Medical advice is also allowed, with some limitation.\nDanger reduced by EPIRBs.\nThe dangers of unassisted sailing have been reduced in recent years by the widespread use of EPIRBs that allow the sailor to summon help even when far from land. One such case occurred in January 1997 when Tony Bullimore was rescued by the Australian Navy after 5 days under a capsized yacht far from the Australian mainland. A few decades earlier this situation would have had a high probability of resulting in his death. EPIRBs greatly increase the chance that the sailor will be found. They have been credited by sailors as being \"vital for sailing boats\" and \"without question\" have saved lives.\nRespect accorded unassisted sailors.\nPeople such as Kay Cottee who complete long unassisted voyages are commonly accorded a considerable amount of respect, because the sailor still faces for a long period the prospect of death at sea. This respect usually extends to single-handed sailors such as Francis Chichester and Joshua Slocum who completed round-the-world voyages with far less assistance and considerably more risk than today's record holders, but which are regarded under current rules as \"assisted\" because of port stops during the voyage. Jessica Watson became the youngest person, at age 16, to sail unassisted around the world on 22 May 2010."

There were 148,530 in attendance.\nContenders.\nSportswriter Steve Haskin called the 2003 Derby contenders a \"perplexing group\". The horses with the best form at age two (Vindication, Toccet, and Sky Mesa) all got injured while preparing for the Derby and ultimately missed the race. Instead, later developing colts dominated the final major preps in March and April. The clear favorite was Empire Maker, who had won both the Florida Derby and Wood Memorial. Empire Maker was at 6:5 on the morning line but drifted out to 5:2 by post-time based on concerns about a bruise to his right front hoof in the final days of training. Peace Rules was the second choice at odds of 6:1 after winning the Louisiana Derby and Blue Grass Stakes. Both horses were trained by Bobby Frankel, a Hall of Fame inductee who had never won a Triple Crown event. Other leading contenders included Buddy Gil (Santa Anita Derby), Ten Most Wanted (Illinois Derby), and Scrimshaw (Lexington Stakes).\nFunny Cide was a moderate longshot at odds of 13:1. Bred in New York, Funny Cide won all three starts at age two in restricted stakes company and was named the New York bred champion two-year-old colt or gelding. When moved to open stakes company at age three, he ran fifth in the Holy Bull Stakes to Offlee Wild, second to Peace Rules in the Louisiana Derby and second to Empire Maker in the Wood Memorial.\nSir Cherokee was originally entered but was scratched by the track veterinarian.\nFull results.\nBrancusi, Peace Rules and Eye of the Tiger went to the early lead and set moderately-fast fractions of 22.78 seconds for the first quarter mile and 46.23 for the first half. Funny Cide was bumped at the start but moved into tracking position going around the first turn while Empire Maker rated in eighth place. Peace Rules went to the lead on the far turn while Funny Cide moved into second and Empire Maker into third. Turning into the stretch, jockey José A. Santos went to the whip and Funny Cide opened a clear lead, then held on to win by lengths. Empire Maker finished a head in front of stablemate Peace Rules for second. The time of 2:01.19 was the 10th fastest running in Derby history.\nThe race set a number of firsts. Funny Cide was the first gelding to win the race since Clyde Van Dusen in 1929. It was the first time a New York-bred had won the Kentucky Derby. It was the first win for Santos in seven attempts, and the first for trainer Barclay Tagg. It was also the first major win for Funny Cide's owners, six friends from upper New York state who named their outfit Sackatoga Stable after their hometown Sackett's Harbor and favorite racetrack, Saratoga. \"We are a three-horse stable\", said one of the partners, Jackson Knowlton. \"We are the little guys in the game. Everyone who dreams in this game, who owns two or five horses, look at what you can accomplish. Little did we know.\"\nTrack condition: Fast\nTimes: mile – 22.78; mile – 46.23; mile – 1:10.48; mile – 1:35.75; final – 2:01.19.&lt;br&gt;\nSplits for each quarter-mile: (22.78) (23.45) (24.25) (25.27) (25.44)\nSource: Equibase Chart\nControversy.\nOn the Thursday after the race, the \"Miami Herald\" published a photo that supposedly showed Santos holding a \"buzzer\" (a device that administers an electric shock to horses, intended to make them run faster). The story became national news and prompted a meeting of the Churchill Downs' stewards. In the photo, there was a dark area between Santos' hand and the whip. The Associated Press subsequently published another photo that clearly showed Santos held no such device: the dark area in the original photo may have been the green silks of the runner-up Empire Maker. Santos was officially cleared a few days later. \"I'm thankful this nightmare is over\", he said. \"A week ago was the happiest moment of my life, and then this photograph came along and nearly ruined my life.\"\nSubsequent racing careers.\nSeveral horses went on to record Grade I wins after the Derby:\nSubsequent breeding careers.\nLeading progeny of participants in the 2003 Kentucky Derby\nEmpire Maker\nOfflee Wild"

        "text": "The Oklahoma City Stars men's basketball team is the basketball team that represents Oklahoma City University (OCU) in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States. The school's team currently competes in the Sooner Athletic Conference.\nHistory.\nOklahoma City competed in NCAA Division I for many years, and the program was especially noted for its success under coaches Doyle Parrack (1950–1955) and his successor Abe Lemons (1955–1973 and 1984–1990). OCU appeared in eleven NCAA Men's Division I Basketball tournaments.\nIn 1985, the school moved from the NCAA to the NAIA citing the number of required NCAA sports, the Midwestern City Conference's insistence that teams host their games in arenas with seating capacities greater than 7,500, and MCC member's concerns of the lack of geographic proximity to their institutions as reasons for the move. Since the move to the NAIA, OCU has won six national championships.\nTournament results.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Chiefs appeared in 11 NCAA Division I basketball tournaments from 1952 to 1973, making them the most prolific tournament team that is no longer in Division I. Their record in tournaments was 8-13, giving them the second most wins of non-DI teams after New York University.\nNIT results.\nThe Chiefs played in the National Invitation Tournament twice.\nNAIA results.\nNote: The NAIA shifted from national to regional seeds in 2016.\nFrederickson Fieldhouse.\nFrederickson Fieldhouse was an athletics facility on the campus of Oklahoma City University. It was built in honor of a major OCU benefactor George Frederickson of Oklahoma City. It was built by the John Henry Frederickson Jr. Construction company, also of Oklahoma City. John Frederickson was the General Contractor, and his son, Chris Frederickson, also worked on the job as a laborer. George Frederickson was the uncle of John Henry Frederickson Jr. In his gift to OCU, George stipulated that the building should be built by his nephew, John Henry.\nFrederickson Field House facility was at the time of its construction (1959) the largest hyperbolic paraboloid structure on earth. The Frederickson construction company was in fact a pioneering company in the design and building of extremely thin-shell concrete buildings, of which Frederickson Field House was one. Another famous thin-shell concrete structure built by John Henry Frederickson was the First Christian Church, also in Oklahoma City. That building has an \"eggshell\" shaped roof that is actually thinner (in proportion) than that of a real eggshell.\nThe Frederickson Field house venue held 3,400 for basketball. Asked why the scoreboard at the Field House was the first one to have a three digit placement for the team scores, Abe Lemons, the coach at the time, said come to the first game and you will find out. Teams rarely scored in the 100s at the time (late 1950s) but in the first game at the Field House OCU beat Florida State Univ by scoring 129 points in the game. The Chiefs (now the STARS) were to be one of the highest scoring teams in the country, scoring over 100 points a game on many occasions. As a Division I team OCU was an Independent team until joining the Midwestern City Conference, now known as the Horizon League. OCU dropped to NAIA status in 1985. It was replaced with the more modern Henry J. Freede Wellness and Activities Center in 2000, and torn down in 2005."

Loyola's first-round regional victory over Tennessee Tech on March 11, 1963, remains a record for margin of victory (69 points) for any NCAA men's basketball tournament game.\nThe team gained national publicity again in 2018, as a result of both their Cinderella Story-esque performance in the tournament, in which they upset numerous teams to reach the Final Four as an 11-seed, tying for the lowest seed ever to do so, and the cultural popularity of their team chaplain, the then-98-year-old nun Sister Jean.\nAs of February 17, 2021, the team had achieved its highest Kenpom ranking ever, at number nine in the country, with the number one ranked defense. \nHistory.\nRacial integration.\nThe Loyola University Chicago teams of the early 1960s, coached by George Ireland, are thought to be responsible for ushering in a new era of racial equality in the sport by shattering all remaining color barriers in NCAA men's basketball. Beginning in 1961, Loyola broke the longstanding gentlemen's agreement (not to play more than three black players at any given time), putting as many as four black players on the court at every game. For the 1962–63 season, Ireland played four black Loyola starters in every game. That season, Loyola also became the first team in NCAA Division I history to play an all-black lineup, doing so in a game against Wyoming on December 29, 1962. In that season's NCAA tournament, Loyola defeated the all-white team of then-segregated Mississippi State by a score of 61–51, a game especially notable because the Bulldogs defied a state court order prohibiting them from playing against a school with black players. The game has since been dubbed the \"Game of Change\" in popular culture.\nIn 1963, Loyola shocked the nation and changed college basketball forever by starting four black players in the NCAA championship game. Loyola's stunning upset of two-time defending NCAA champion Cincinnati, in overtime by a score of 60–58, was the crowning achievement in the school's nearly decade long struggle with racial inequality in men's college basketball, highlighted by the tumultuous events of that year's NCAA Tournament. Loyola's 1963 NCAA title was historic not only for the racial makeup of Loyola's team, but also due to the fact that Cincinnati had started three black players, making seven of the 10 starters in the 1963 NCAA Championship game black.\nHome venues.\nThe team's original home venue was the on-campus Alumni Gym. However, Loyola later moved to play their games at DePaul University's Alumni Hall, and subsequently moved around, with stints at Northwestern University's McGaw Memorial Hall (today known as Welsh Ryan Arena), the University of Illinois at Chicago's Illinois-Chicago Pavilion, and the Chicago Stadium. From 1987 until 1989, Loyola played at the International Amphitheatre, but suffered poor attendance at that venue. From 1989 until 1994, the team played at the Rosemont Horizon (today known as the \"Allstate Arena\"), but suffered low attendance at the venue and moved back to the on-campus Alumni Gym in 1994. In 1996, the team moved into their current on-campus home, the Joseph J. Gentile Arena, which replaced Alumni Hall.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Ramblers have appeared in eight NCAA tournaments. Their combined record is 15–7. They were National Champions in 1963. On March 24, 2018, the Ramblers defeated Kansas State 78–62 to advance to play in their second Final Four in school history.\nNIT results.\nThe Ramblers have appeared in five National Invitation Tournaments.

Afleet Alex was the second choice based on his win in the Arkansas Derby. Other leading contenders included Wilko (Breeders' Cup Juvenile), High Fly (Florida Derby) and Bandini (Blue Grass Stakes).

Meanwhile, Giacomo broke slowly and settled near the back of the field, carried five wide around the first turn. Still in 18th place after three-quarters of a mile, Giacomo started to make up ground while moving six wide around the turn. He ran into traffic problems entering the stretch but finally found racing room and closed steadily to win by half a length.\n\"He had to overcome some pretty tricky moves.

        "title": "Unicorns (cricket team)",
        "text": "Unicorns were a cricket team in England that was formed in 2010 specifically to play in the Clydesdale Bank 40 limited overs competition. They played in that competition until 2013 and from 2014 to 2018 the Unicorns team competed in the Second XI one-day and Twenty20 competitions. The 2014 season also included a 50-over match against Sri Lanka A. Members of the squad were all players without current full-time contracts with one of the regular first-class counties.\nIn only their sixth competitive game, Unicorns entered the record books for scoring the highest total in the second innings of a 40-over game, beating Sussex by successfully chasing 325.\nThe team was wound up at the end of the 2018 season for financial and logistical reasons.\nFormation.\nProvisionally called the ECB Recreation XI, the squad was selected by coach Philip Oliver, Mark Alleyne and Min Patel from a pool of 200 players recommended to the England and Wales Cricket Board in December 2009; the pool was reduced to 40 and 21 following training sessions over the winter. 15 members of the squad are former county cricket professionals. Team Manager Gordon Child said, \"The Unicorns squad is a balance of youth and experience...For the younger players aspiring to play first-class cricket this is an opportunity to learn from their more experienced team mates and really test themselves and understand the attributes needed to succeed at this level.\" The squad was captained by experienced professional Keith Parsons, the former Somerset all-rounder, who was playing Minor Counties cricket for Cornwall.\n2010 Clydesdale Bank 40.\nUnicorns played in Group A of the 2010 Clydesdale Bank 40, along with Glamorgan, Lancashire, Somerset, Surrey, Sussex and Worcestershire; The competition was created for the 18 first-class counties, plus Scotland, Ireland and a Recreational XI based on players from the Minor Counties. Ireland declined to compete, thus leaving the competition one team short for the proposed three groups of seven format; and The Netherlands took their place. Unicorns were created to play representing the Minor Counties, thus giving a new opportunity for younger players to gain experience and to learn from experienced professionals. Unicorns had no fixed stadium and played their home games at six different outgrounds (stadiums with occasional use by first-class counties).\nTheir first competitive game was due to be against Surrey on 2 May 2010, but was abandoned without any play, due to rain. Both teams received one point. After a promising start in reply to Sussex's 255/8 at Hove, Unicorns collapsed from 207/4 to 211 all out, to lose their first full competitive game by 44 runs. Former England international bowler James Kirtley led the collapse, with four wickets in eight balls. Unicorns then lost by seven wickets to Somerset at Taunton.\nIn their fourth group game, on 16 May, Unicorns recorded their first win. Batting first against Glamorgan at Dean Park, Bournemouth, Unicorns scored 231/8, including a stand of 126 between Parsons and Knappett. Glamorgan were then restricted to 173. Unicorns then went on to hit the record books when they stunned Sussex, in complete contrast to their batting collapse against them earlier in the competition. Wes Durston smashed 117 from 68 balls as they chased down a target of 325 to set the highest score (327/4) for a team batting second in the history of 40-over cricket. The third-wicket partnership between Durston and Josh Knappett, both making their highest List A scores, made 165 in just 18 overs.\nOn resumption of the competition following the two-month break for Twenty20 matches, Unicorns suffered a nine-wicket defeat to Lancashire, before chasing another large total (277 runs), this time set by Worcestershire to win with two balls to spare; Michael O'Shea hit 90 from 62 balls.\nDemise.\nThe Unicorns team was scrapped after the 2018 season. The Minor Counties Cricket Association had reintroduced a T20 competition in 2018 and decided that the money spent on the Unicorns team would be better used to fund that T20 competition. There were also concerns about selection and whether the team was properly representative of leisure cricket."

Division II is separated further by region; Northwest and Southeast\nHistory.\nThe RMLC, first known as the RMLA, was formed in 1976 with founding members Colorado State University, University of Colorado, Regis University, Air Force Academy, University of Denver, and Colorado School of Mines. In 1997, the Conference changed names to the Rocky Mountain Intercollegiate Lacrosse League (RMILL) and went to a club-only league as a member of the US Lacrosse Intercollegiate Associates (USLIA), which reorganized into the Men's Collegiate Lacrosse Association (MCLA) in 2006.\nThe RMLC has been the home conference of the MCLA Division I National Champions in 1999, 2001, 2003, 2006, 2012 and 2013 (Colorado State University); in 1997, 2000, 2007, 2011 (Brigham Young University); and in 2014 (University of Colorado). In Division II, Westminster College were National Champions in 2008, and the University of Utah won in 2022.\nIn 2017, Utah announced that they were going to elevate their program to play as an NCAA Division 1 Independent, turning them from a club team to an NCAA team. After the 2018 season, they left the conference. In 2019, the RMLC announced that the University of Texas and the University of Oklahoma would join the conference at the Division 1 level starting in the 2020 season. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, their first game in the conference had to be pushed back to 2021. In 2021, it was revealed that Oklahoma would leave the conference to go back to the Lone Star Alliance.

His position of choice was hooker.\nRugby career.\nClark first played rugby for the youth sides at Helston RFC, before moving joining the Exeter Chiefs. Clark made his debut for Exeter on 9 October 1999 at the age of 18 as a substitute against Orrell R.U.F.C.

In his second season with the club he scored the winning try in the penultimate match against Orrell that saw Bristol promoted to the Premiership. Clark injured his anterior cruciate ligament in pre-season training before the 2006-07 season and was released by Bristol in February 2007 during his rehabilitation.\nTowards the end of the season, Clark moved to Cornish All Blacks and made several appearances in their successful push for promotion from National Division Two, scoring the final try of the season against Cambridge R.U.F.C.

It was the 35th consecutive year that the World Snooker Championship had been held at the Crucible and was the last ranking event of the 2010–11 snooker season. The event was organised by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association and had a total prize fund of £1,111,000, with £250,000 going to the winner of the event. The tournament was sponsored by sports betting company Betfred.\nNeil Robertson was the defending champion, but lost 8–10 against Judd Trump in the first round. Trump became the youngest player since 1990 to reach the final where he lost to John Higgins. This was Higgins' fourth world title, becoming only the fourth man to win four or more championships in the modern era. Ding Junhui meanwhile became the first player from China to reach the semi-finals. Mark King and Ding Junhui made the highest breaks at the Crucible with 138; while James Wattana compiled the highest break of the tournament during qualifying with 141.\nAn audience of 3.93 million viewers watched the fourth session in Great Britain with 2.03 million watching the third session of the final. The second and fourth sessions of the final were the most watched programmes on BBC Two for their particular weeks. Viewing figures on the BBC peaked at 6.6 million viewers. The figure of 3.9 million who watched the final session was up 50% on the year before. It was estimated that nearly half of the UK population watched the tournament at some point. In China, Ding Junhui's semi-final had an average watch of 19.4 million with a peak audience of 30 million over seven television networks. A record number of fans bought tickets, with the last four days and other sessions sold out with sales up 15% on 2010.\nOverview.\nThe World Snooker Championship is an annual cue sport tournament and the official world championship of the game of snooker. Invented in the late 19th century by British Army soldiers stationed in India, the sport was popular in Great Britain. In modern times it has been played worldwide, especially in East and Southeast Asian nations such as China, Hong Kong and Thailand.\nIn the 2011 tournament, 32 professional players competed in one-on-one snooker matches played over several , using a single-elimination tournament format. The 32 players were selected for the event using the snooker world rankings and a pre-tournament qualification competition. In 1927, the first world championship was won by Joe Davis. The event's final took place in Camkin's Hall, Birmingham, England. Since 1977, the event has been held at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England. The event was organised by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association. Australian Neil Robertson was the defending champion, having defeated Graeme Dott 18–13 in the previous year's final. The event was sponsored by sports betting company Betfred.\nFormat.\nThe 2011 World Snooker Championship took place from 16 April to 2 May 2011 in Sheffield, England. The tournament was the last of eight ranking events in the 2010–11 snooker season on the World Snooker Tour. It featured a 32-player main draw that was held at the Crucible Theatre, as well as a qualifying draw that was played at the World Snooker Academy in Sheffield from 3 to 13 March. This was the 35th consecutive year that the tournament had been staged at the Crucible. The main stages of the event were broadcast by the BBC in the United Kingdom.\nThe top 16 players in the latest world rankings automatically qualified for the main draw as seeded players. Robertson was seeded first overall as the defending champion, and the remaining 15 seeds were allocated based on the latest world rankings. The number of frames required to win a match increased throughout the tournament. The first round consisted of best-of-19-frames matches, with the final match being played over a maximum of 35 frames. All 16 non-seeded spots in the main draw were filled with players from the qualifying rounds.\nPrize fund.\nFor the 2011 tournament there was a £1,111,000 prize fund with the winner receiving £250,000. World Snooker offered no additional prize money for a maximum break, whereas in previous years the prize money for this achievement was £147,000. The breakdown of prize money for this year is shown below:\nTournament summary.\nOpening rounds (first round—quarter-finals).\nThe first round was played from 16 to 21 April as the best of 19 frames held over two . Defending champion Neil Robertson led Judd Trump 7–6, but lost the match 8–10. Trump, having recently won the 2011 China Open, commented \"I'm on a high at the moment and I don't want it to finish. I want to make winning a habit\". There were two debutants at the main stages of the event: Andrew Pagett and Jimmy Robertson. This was also the first time that either had qualified for the main draw of a ranking tournament. Both players lost their opening round match, as Pagett lost 7–10 against Jamie Cope and Jimmy Robertson lost 1–10 against Mark Selby.\nBoth Barry Hawkins and Rory McLeod reached the second round of the World Championship for the first time. Hawkins defeated Stephen Maguire on a 10–9 and McLeod defeated Ricky Walden 10–6. Ronnie O'Sullivan attempted to withdraw from the event one week before it started, but later, when asked for a written confirmation, changed his decision. He compiled his 100th century break at the venue in his first round match against Dominic Dale, as he won 10–2. Previous winner Graeme Dott led Mark King 7–3, but was reduced to a 7–6 lead. Dott won three of the next four frames to complete a 10–7 victory. Seven-time winner Hendry defeated Joe Perry 10–9 on a deciding frame, but hinted that he might retire after the event. In total, five out of the sixteen seeded players lost their first round matches: Neil Robertson, Maguire, Walden, Marco Fu and Peter Ebdon. Fu lost 8–10 against Martin Gould and Ebdon lost 8–10 against Stuart Bingham.\nThe second round was played as the best of 25 frames, held over three sessions. Selby made six century breaks during his 13–4 victory over Hendry. This was the first time six century breaks had been made in a match at the event, and also for a best of 25 frames match at any event. Trump defeated Gould 13–6, with his opponent considering him to be a favourite to win the event, and Trump commenting \"I feel I've got the game to go out and win it\". Dott and Carter were tied at 11–11 in their second round match, before Dott won the next two frames to complete a 13–11 victory. Ding came back from 9–12 to defeat Stuart Bingham on a deciding frame. This was the first time that he had qualified for the quarter-finals of the world championships. Eleventh seed Mark Allen also went to a deciding frame, as he defeated Hawkins 13–12. In a long eight-hour match, John Higgins overcame Rory McLeod 13–7.\nThe quarter-finals were played as the best of 25 frames. Mark Williams defeated Allen 13–5 to reach the semi-finals of the World Championship for the first time since winning the 2003 World Snooker Championship. Trump, rated an 80–1 outsider at the beginning of the tournament, defeated previous year's runner up Dott 13–5 to reach the semi-finals. Ding won his match 13–10 against Selby to become the third Asian player to reach the semi-finals of the world championship, following James Wattana and Fu. As a result of Selby's exit, Williams became the new world number one after the event. O'Sullivan led Higgins 8–5 in their quarter-final match, but won just two of the next ten frames, as Higgins won the match 13–10. O'Sullivan commented \"I had enough chances to win, more than I expected. I just didn't take them\", whilst Higgins suggested that O'Sullivan missing was the only way he could have won the match.\nLater rounds (semi-finals—final).\nThe semi-finals were played as the best of 33 frames, held over four sessions. Trump defeated Ding 17–15 to become the second youngest player (after Hendry in 1990) to reach the final of the event. Trump also reached his second consecutive ranking final after winning the China Open at the start of the month. In China, the second session of the match drew a peak audience of nearly 30 million viewers and averaging over 19 million, with the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association claiming it was the highest rated sports programme of 2011 up to that point; however, the Women's Tennis Association claimed that the women's singles final of the Australian Open held earlier in the year drew an audience of 60 million viewers on Chinese television. Williams led Higgins 5–3 after the first session, and maintained his lead after the second session, which ended 9–7. Higgins, however, then won six of the next eight frames, to lead 13–11 after the third session. Higgins won the match 17–14 to reach his third final in five years. During the 28th frame Higgins was heckled by a member of the audience, \"How did you swallow that £300,000, John? ... You're a disgrace to snooker.\" in reference to the \"News of the World\" allegations the previous year of match fixing, for which the heckler was later ejected from the venue. Higgins had only returned from a six month suspension due to the incident in November.\nThe final was played as the best of 35 frames, held over four sessions. The final was contested between Higgins and Trump, and officiated by Jan Verhaas, who was taking charge of his fourth World Championship final. Ted Lowe, BBC commentator for many years and the deviser of the long-running snooker programme \"Pot Black\", died at the age of 90 on the morning of 1 May. Before the start of the final that day, a minute's applause in honour of Lowe took place. After the first session was tied at four frames all, Trump won the second session 6–3 to take a 10–7 lead into the second day's play. Higgins took a 13–12 lead after the third session of the final, which he won 6–2. Trump levelled the match at 14–14, before Higgins won four of the last five frames to win the match 18–15. \nThis was Higgins 24th ranking title, and the fourth time he had won the event. Only Ray Reardon, Steve Davis and Hendry had won the event as many times. Higgins complemented Trump \"He was the better player. He was playing a brand of snooker I have never seen before in my life.\" The pair would also contest the 2019 World Snooker Championship final, with Trump winning 18–9. The highest of the tournament was 138 made by both Ding and King. This was the first time since 1987 that the highest break of the tournament was lower than 140, when it was 127 made by Davis.\nMain draw.\nBelow is the full draw for the main stage of the tournament.

There were 140,054 in attendance.\nContenders.\nSmarty Jones was the 4-1 favorite for the race. He came into the Derby with an undefeated record, including wins in the Rebel Stakes and Arkansas Derby, both held at Oaklawn Park. If he won the Kentucky Derby, he stood to earn a $5 million \"Centennial Bonus\" offered by Oaklawn to celebrate its 100th anniversary.\nHis leading rivals included Lion Heart (Hollywood Futurity, 2nd in Blue Grass Stakes), Castledale (Santa Anita Derby), The Cliff's Edge (Blue Grass Stakes), Tapit (Wood Memorial), Friends Lake (Florida Dery), and Imperialism (San Rafael, 2nd in Santa Anita Derby).\nSt. Averil and Wimbledon were originally entered but scratched from the race, meaning there were only 18 starters.\nFull results.\nA \"deluge\" started about two hours before the race, turning a fast track sloppy.

Smarty Jones rated a few lengths behind then started his move on the far turn. The two raced heads apart as they entered the stretch, then Smarty Jones started to edge away to win by lengths.\nSmarty Jones became the first horse to win the Derby while undefeated since Seattle Slew in 1977. It was the first Derby win for his trainer, jockey and owner, all of whom were well known in the Mid Atlantic racing circuit but making their first start in the race.

        "text": "Stage 12 of the 2010 Giro d'Italia took place on 20 May in Città Sant'Angelo, and the race concluded with stage 21 in Verona on 30 May. Seven of the last ten stages in the race contained mountain climbs, including the uphill individual time trial to Plan de Corones four days before the end of the race. The last eight stages were clustered in northeast Italy, with six summit finishes among them.\nOne of the highlights of the second half of the Giro was Monte Zoncolan; although its peak is not as high as other climbs in the race, its gradients are extremely difficult, averaging at 12% with maximum stretches of 22%. Ivan Basso won this stage, and in so doing positioned himself well for the conclusion of the race.\nAs the second half of the Giro began, young Australian Richie Porte held the race leadership by way of having been in a fortunate 50-rider strong breakaway in stage 11. The first two stages of the Giro's second half were flat and did not alter the overall standings in any significant way. A mountain climb to Monte Grappa in stage 14 transferred the race leader's pink jersey to David Arroyo of the team. Arroyo, a skilled descender, tried to hold off Ivan Basso and the team in the Giro's final stages, but on a relatively easy climb to Aprica in stage 19, Basso took the pink jersey for the first time en route to his second career Giro crown.\nStage 12.\n20 May 2010 — Città Sant'Angelo to Porto Recanati, \nThere were two small categorized climbs toward the end of the stage, the first of which marked the race's entrance into the province of Macerata, on roads often visited by Tirreno–Adriatico. The riders saw the finish line in Porto Recanati twice, taking a finishing circuit in the town.\n's Rick Flens attacked into the stage, to form the day's principal breakaway. He rode alone for a time, but later, Yuriy Krivtsov and Olivier Kaisen made the bridge to join him. The peloton was mindful not to give them an enormous time gap like the breakaway in stage 11 had gotten. , working for the Giro's only double stage winner Tyler Farrar, took the pace, and kept the time gap manageable. The trio had 9'37\" at one point, but as the circuit in Porto Recanati began, their advantage was just 1'10\". With left to race, the three-rider breakaway was brought back into the peloton.\nAt that point, counterattacks began. Francesco Faili and four others briefly came clear, but they were not able to stay away for the stage win either. When their group was brought back, a ten-rider group containing several overall contenders, including Damiano Cunego, Michele Scarponi, Stefano Garzelli, Ivan Basso, Vincenzo Nibali, and Alexander Vinokourov got free on the third-category climb preceding the finish. Their advantage never extended beyond a few seconds, but they stayed away and finished 10 seconds ahead of the rest of the peloton. Filippo Pozzato, the strongest sprinter in the group and the rider with the least overall chances, won the stage. Pozzato was the first Italian rider to win a stage in this Giro, and it was his first career Giro stage win.\nBehind them, in the peloton, Cadel Evans was the most notable rider to miss the selection. He tried to force the pace to bring the break back, but clashed with Daniele Righi at the front of the peloton. Righi was trying to ride a much slower pace to allow his teammate Cunego the chance to stay away for victory. Evans and Righi nearly came to blows after the stage. They were both later fined by the UCI, though they shook hands and made up before the next stage. The top ten to the overall standings were unchanged by the day's results.\nStage 13.\n21 May 2010 — Porto Recanati to Cesenatico, \nThe first two-thirds of the course was mainly flat, following the Adriatic coast. The route then cut inland for two climbs, including one with a maximum gradient of 18%. The stage finished with of descending or flat racing. The arrival town of Cesenatico was the hometown of Marco Pantani, and the stage commemorated him.\nSeventeen riders from 16 teams formed the day's breakaway, coming together as a cohesive group after of racing. was the only team with two riders in the move; they were Joan Horrach and Sergei Klimov. Iban Mayoz in 26th overall was the highest-placed man in the group, over 16 minutes behind race leader Richie Porte, so the peloton had little interest in chasing this escape group. Their maximum advantage over the main field was eight and a half minutes. On the Perticara climb, the first of the day, Vladimir Karpets, who had been in 19th overall and represented a much bigger overall threat than anyone in the escape, attacked and came clear of the peloton. He eventually found Horrach, who paced him as far as he could before hitting the wall. tried to mount a chase to bring back Karpets, but he stayed away and gained two minutes against the peloton. He also moved up five places in the overall standings, passing both Ivan Basso and Vincenzo Nibali to be 14th overall at day's end.\nOn the descent of the Perticara, various riders in the slightly depleted leading group attacked, but none succeeded in escaping. Kalle Kriit, Mayoz, Tom Stamsnijder, Mauro Facci, and Cameron Meyer eventually took a lead over the others for a few kilometers, though most of the breakaway group again came together as the finish line neared. Craig Lewis tried to solo for the stage win with an attack from out. He seemed poised for victory for a few moments, but the group caught him from the end of the stage. Manuel Belletti from the small team outsprinted Greg Henderson to win the stage. Belletti is from the area where the stage ended. He recalled after the stage that in his youth his father would take him to see Pantani ride, and he dedicated the victory to both of them. The peloton finished 7'28\" back on the stage, but other than for Karpets' attack there was no major change to the overall standings.\nStage 14.\n22 May 2010 — Ferrara to Asolo (Monte Grappa), \nMonte Grappa, which used to feature frequently in the Giro, was the first of several major climbs in the Giro's final week. It was the only categorized climb in this stage, and reached with just over remaining. The race took the hardest route up the climb, which averages 8% gradients with maximum gradients of 14%.\nThe pace was high in the peloton as the stage began. This was one of the few stages in the Giro to this point run in nice weather. After were covered, and nearly an hour spent racing, Markus Eibegger instigated the day's breakaway, being followed in his attack by four others. The peloton let them get an advantage of over eight minutes by the mark. The time gap hovered there until the Grappa began, at which point and led a coordinated chase. Bradley Wiggins attacked out of the group of favorites and found his teammate Steven Cummings, a member of the original breakaway, up the road. While Cummings paced him to a gap before cracking, Wiggins was unable to stay away for very long. Vincenzo Nibali was the next on the attack, drawing with him Michele Scarponi. Cadel Evans and Ivan Basso made the bridge, and the four of them absorbed the remnants of the morning escape, quickly becoming the leading group on the road. The climb went above the tree line, meaning there was wind and rain facing the riders at the top of the Grappa. Basso was first over the line for the mountain sprint, but it was Nibali who took aggressive lines on the descent, soloing to the finish 23 seconds ahead of the other three. Basso did not work in the chase, protecting the interests of his teammate up the road, but took the sprint for second place and the 12 bonus seconds it afforded. The race lead transferred as a result of the day's racing; overnight leader Richie Porte finished over four minutes behind Nibali and lost the jersey to David Arroyo. Arroyo also lost time on the stage, but did not lose as much. Having also been in the important breakaway in stage 11, Arroyo was in position to take the pink jersey.\nStage 15.\n23 May 2010 — Mestre to Zoncolan, \nThe first of this stage were flat, preceding some heavy climbing. The finish was on the long Monte Zoncolan, with an average gradient of 12%, and stretches of up to 22%. It was preceded on the course by three other climbs. This was the third passage of the Giro over the Zoncolan; Gilberto Simoni won each of the first two, in 2003 and 2007.\nIn the flat section of the course, six riders opened up a substantial lead on the peloton. These were Ludovic Turpin, Jackson Rodríguez, Guillaume Le Floch, Nico Sijmens, Jérôme Pineau, and Francesco Reda. The peloton gave them 14 minutes, but with the massive Zoncolan climb ahead, there was little chance that they would stay away. , one of the few squads that still had all nine riders in the Giro, drove a very hard pace in the main field when the climbing began. The time gap fell slowly on the day's first climb, the Sella Chianzutanis, but the second, the Passo Duron, was far steeper and took its toll on the leaders. There were five left out front with just over three minutes' advantage on a depleted peloton of about 25 riders able to keep 's pace.\nThe Zoncolan climb completely broke the race open. Very few riders climbed the mountain together, and the overall favorites quickly absorbed the remnants of the morning breakaway. An attack from Michele Scarponi opened things up in the favorites' group, and Ivan Basso was the first to respond. Basso drew with him Marco Pinotti and Cadel Evans, as Alexander Vinokourov, Carlos Sastre, and Bradley Wiggins all fell off the pace. Wiggins cracked badly as the Zoncolan climb wore on, and lost more than 25 minutes, to fall conclusively out of any overall contention. Race leader David Arroyo was also dropped on the climb.\nBasso put in repeated attacks in the front of the race. He succeeded in dropping Pinotti and Scarponi, but Evans held the pace for a while. Finally, with left to race, Basso was able to drop the Australian, and soloed through the hardest parts of the climb for victory by over a minute. This gap was the largest among the contenders, as from Evans in second to Arroyo in 11th only two and a half minutes passed. Arroyo kept the pink jersey, but Basso's deficit in the overall standings was greatly reduced, as he leapt from 11th to third in the general classification with the day's results.\nStage 16.\n25 May 2010 — Mareo to Plan de Corones, (individual time trial)\nAfter the second rest day, in Friuli, the peloton faced the Giro's third race against the clock, and second individual race. It consisted of the climb to Plan de Corones, visited for the second time in the Giro's history. With of vertical gain in , the climb had an average gradient of 8.5%. Its steepest stretches, in the final kilometer, were on a 24% grade, and the final 5.2 km of the course is on a dirt road.\nRiders were staggered into three groups of approximately 50, with a 90-minute break in between the groups. This was necessary because there was not enough room at the top of the Plan de Corones to hold the entire Giro peloton and caravan; during the breaks, the riders who had just ridden the climb descended the same way they came up. The course was run on a narrow access road to a ski resort.\nThe best time through the first two groups came from 's Rigoberto Urán, who stopped the clock in 43' 04\". Early in the third group came former Giro champion Stefano Garzelli, who was over 90 seconds better than Urán to claim the top spot. Garzelli's ride held up to the end of the day as the stage winning time, Garzelli's first Giro stage win since 2007. He expressed surprise at his win when asked after the stage, and said it was one of his \"nicest\" wins of his career. The biggest surprise of the day was 's John Gadret turning in a third place ride, the only rider other than Evans within a minute of Garzelli's winning time.\nLater on came the Giro's overall favorites. Among them, Cadel Evans turned in the best ride, second on the day 42 seconds the lesser of Garzelli despite having the best time at the intermediate time check. Carlos Sastre lost more time, with a 19th place ride dropping two minutes. 's two leaders Ivan Basso and Vincenzo Nibali both had top-ten rides to solidify their positions in the standings, though Evans closed his deficit to Basso considerably with his ride and leapfrogged Sastre in the standings. Race leader David Arroyo was 16th, over two minutes back on the day, but still had enough time in hand to retain the pink jersey.\nStage 17.\n26 May 2010 — Bruneck to Pejo Terme, \nThis was categorized as an intermediate stage. It included a summit stage finish, though a higher pass, the Passo delle Palade, occurs earlier in the stage.\nThis was described as the Giro's most controlled stage. After a morning breakaway of 19 riders took from into the stage, and rode a tempo at the front of the peloton to protect their general classification leaders, affording the stage win to one from the leading group.\nSeventeen teams were represented in the break; and each had two riders in the group. Their time gap was a little over nine minutes for almost all of the stage. Mikhail Ignatiev set off on a solo bid for victory from the line, but he faded quickly and finished the stage with the peloton. At to go, Nicki Sørensen put in an attack that broke the race open. The leaders no longer rode as a cohesive unit, and finished scattered ahead of the peloton. Sørensen's move was not destined for success, as he faded and finished the stage 11th. Daniel Moreno then rode at the front of the race for a few kilometers before the chasing group of Danilo Hondo, Steven Kruijswijk, and Damien Monier passed him up. The three of them rode together for a while before Monier took off on the Pejo Terme climb, soloing to victory half a minute ahead of Kruijswijk and Hondo. The stage win was Monier's first professional victory. It was the sprinter Hondo who climbed to second on the stage, saying afterward that he had had \"good legs\" despite the stage profile not favoring him. The race's overall favorites finished 9'53\" back on the stage, with Michele Scarponi gaining one second on the rest of his group at the finish line. Richie Porte, Carlos Sastre, Damiano Cunego, and Robert Kišerlovski all lost a few seconds, but the composition of the top ten in the overall classification remained the same as the day before.\nStage 18.\n27 May 2010 — Levico Terme to Brescia, \nThis stage was short and flat, with no categorized climbs. It headed south from Levico Terme to Brescia in Lombardy.\nAfter missing out on the bunch finishes earlier in the Giro, sprinter André Greipel, the season's most prolific winner, made a point of continuing through the mountain stages earlier in the Giro's last week with victory in this stage in mind. Olivier Kaisen and Alan Marangoni were the day's principal breakaway, but rode a tempo at the front of the peloton that kept them from getting any more than three minutes' advantage. They timed the catch ideally, reeling in Kaisen with remaining in the stage and Marangoni a kilometer later. Marcel Sieberg and František Raboň rode on either side of Greipel to keep him protected and keep any other sprinter from holding his wheel. Greipel accelerated inside the final few hundred meters of the stage and took the victory ahead of Julian Dean and Tiziano Dall'Antonia. There was no change to the overall standings with the day's results.\nStage 19.\n28 May 2010 — Brescia to Aprica, \nThis stage contained four categorized climbs, visiting the summit finish in Aprica once before the actual conclusion of the stage. from the finish of the stage was the Passo del Mortirolo, which was only marginally less steep than the Zoncolan, and was longer. After the descent from the Mortirolo, a long ramp back to Aprica was the finish.\nThe first few kilometers of this stage were flat, and during this time the peloton stayed together. After an hour of racing, nine riders – Jan Bakelants, Francesco Faili, Branislau Samoilau, Luca Mazzanti, Yuriy Krivtsov, Jackson Rodríguez, William Bonnet, Xavier Tondó, and Leonardo Duque – established a gap over the main field. They had an advantage of 8'27\" at the stage's feed zone. It was at this point that the day's climbing began, with the first visit to Aprica. On this climb, Stefano Garzelli attacked out of the peloton and came clear, bridging up to his teammate Faili who had intentionally fallen off the pace of the leaders to work for Garzelli. In the peloton, the team of Ivan Basso and Vincenzo Nibali, one of the few squads that still had all nine riders, was riding a very hard tempo to try to isolate the competition while protecting their leaders. Through the first ascent of Aprica and the first-category Trivigno climb, this was how the race was, with the remnants of the morning breakaway out in the front of the race, Garzelli about a minute behind, and then the rapidly depleting group of overall favorites behind him.\nDamiano Cunego was the first overall contender dropped by 's pace, as Sylwester Szmyd drove the group up the Mortirolo. In short order, everyone from the morning breakaway was reabsorbed, leaving only Garzelli out front. As one by one 's support riders rode increasingly harder and harder paces before bonking and falling off, many overall contenders followed Cunego out the back of what had been the pink jersey group. Carlos Sastre was the next to lose contact, followed by Alexander Vinokourov. Cadel Evans fell off numerous times and fought back before being dropped for good near the summit. Race leader David Arroyo rode the climb behind Evans and was immediately at risk of losing the pink jersey, as the lead group contained only Basso, Nibali, and Michele Scarponi, who crested the Mortirolo more than two minutes ahead of him.\nBasso rode a conservative descent of the Mortirolo, and Nibali and Scarponi had to wait for him several times. Arroyo, a rider recognized as a skilled descender, rode very aggressively, catching and passing Sastre and John Gadret, then Evans, then Vinokourov and came within 30 seconds of reaching the leading Italian trio. Garzelli, for his part, had also ridden an aggressive descent of the Mortirolo, but he crashed and would abandon the race the next day due to his injuries.\nFacing the second ascent of Aprica, which was also the stage finish, Basso, Nibali, and Scarponi held an advantage of under a minute over Arroyo, Sastre, Gadret, Vinokourov, and Evans, who had come together into a single chase group. Although the Aprica was a much easier climb than the Mortirolo, the leading trio put time into the Arroyo group for the entirety of the climb. Basso and Nibali, being teammates, worked together to drive the group to get as big a time gap as possible to put Basso in the pink jersey and potentially Nibali onto the Giro's podium. Scarponi did very little work in the group, and as such was the freshest in the sprint for the stage win. Nibali allowed Basso second place to get him the bigger time bonus. With 2'27\" in hand to Basso coming into the day, and a 12-second bonus already lost, Arroyo had to finish the stage no more than 2'15\" slower than the stage winner to keep the pink jersey. The Arroyo group was not nearly as fresh as the leaders during the climb and did not come close to that time, finishing over three minutes back. Basso took the pink jersey for the first time since winning the race overall in 2006, but noted after the stage that while the team had worked well on this day, there was another very difficult day ahead of them before the time trial in Verona.\nStage 20.\n29 May 2010 — Bormio to Passo del Tonale, \nThe Passo di Gavia, at in elevation, was the \"Cima Coppi\", the highest point in the Giro. It was the penultimate climb on the course, before the finish at the Passo del Tonale. The course briefly entered Switzerland for the Forcola di Livigno climb, which features almost of vertical gain. This stage contained the most climbing of any in this Giro, going up among five mountains.\nFor weeks leading up to this stage, there had been speculation that the route would have to be altered due to the amount of snow that had accumulated on the Gavia. An alternative route, involving a different ascent of the Passo del Mortirolo than was used in stage 19, was proposed. It was ultimately deemed unnecessary to alter the route, as the roads on the Gavia were cleared and there was no snowfall the day the stage was run. The roads were lined with banks of piled up snow as the riders contested the stage.\nSeveral inconsequential breakaway attempts occurred in the first two hours of racing, with no group getting more than about a minute on the pink jersey group at any time. Finally, over the Passo di Eira and the Passo di Foscagno, the day's second and third of five climbs, Johan Tschopp and Gilberto Simoni established themselves as the day's signature breakaway. Carlos Sastre and Alexander Vinokourov were in a chase group between the leading duo and the pink jersey group. Much as they had in the previous day, rode a hard tempo that effectively isolated members of the other teams while protecting race leader Ivan Basso and squad co-captain Vincenzo Nibali. Sastre and Vinokourov's group was not ahead of the race leader for long, and they were brought back during the ascent of the Gavia.\nIn the front of the race, Tschopp and Simoni approached the summit of the Gavia together. Tschopp easily outkicked the veteran Italian to claim the prize that went along with winning the \"Cima Coppi\" and Simoni never caught back up to him, finishing 6'50\" back on the stage, in 32nd. The pink jersey group was next to the summit. Once over the top, previous race leader David Arroyo faced the decision of whether to ride a hard descent as he had on the Mortirolo the day before. He stayed with Basso for the descent, seemingly content to keep his second place in the overall standings.\nAs the Giro was the final event of Simoni's career and this was the Giro's final road race stage, Simoni was approached by a journalist on a motorbike for an interview as he climbed the Passo del Tonale. Tschopp rode the Tonale alone and stayed out front to the conclusion of the race, getting the first Giro stage win for a Swiss rider since Alex Zülle in 1998.\nThe pink jersey group ascended the Tonale just behind Tschopp. Michele Scarponi put in an attack about a kilometer from the finish of the stage that succeeded in getting him, Basso, and Cadel Evans clear while leaving Nibali, Vinokourov, Arroyo, and others behind. A few hundred meters from the finish, Evans put in a finishing kick that gained him a further 9 seconds over the other two. The day's results put Scarponi a single second behind Nibali for the podium, but with Nibali recognized as the far superior time trialist of the two, there stood to be little changed by the Verona time trial that closed out the race.\nStage 21.\n30 May 2010 — Verona, (individual time trial)\nFor the third consecutive year, the Giro concluded with an individual time trial. There were several sharp turns in the course and a categorized climb in the middle of it. The finish line was just outside the Arena di Verona. After crossing it, the riders rode into the stadium where a very large crowd had assembled to see the final podium presentations.\nMuch as it had in the time trial which closed out the 2009 Giro, the winning time came relatively early in this stage. 's Gustav Larsson stopped the clock in 20'19\" as the 80th man to the leave the starthouse, out of the 139 riders who finished the Giro. He was confident in his time, and was worried about only two rivals among the nearly 60 riders who were to follow him – stage one winner Bradley Wiggins and Italian national time trial champion Marco Pinotti. Wiggins was 12 seconds off Larsson's pace at the intermediate time check, which Larsson took to mean he could not beat his time at the finish line since Larsson is the better of the two in the downhills. He was nervous in watching Pinotti take the course near the end of the day, and the Italian champion posted a better time than Larsson at the intermediate time check, but he faded as the course went on and was two seconds slower than Larsson at the finish line.\nLittle was to be decided with regards to the overall standings. Race leader Ivan Basso and second place man David Arroyo were recognized as roughly equal against the clock, and even if Arroyo were considerably better it would be difficult to make up 1'15\" in such a short course. Michele Scarponi trailed Vincenzo Nibali by a single second for the last step on the podium, but was a poorer time trialist and did not make up the deficit. Arroyo and Scarponi both conceded time, but remained in their previous overall positions of second and fourth, respectively. Giro champion Basso was 15th on the day, 42 seconds back of Larsson. He named this Giro win as much sweeter than his first, in 2006, as he had to fight for it in the race's difficult final week after sustaining a crash in Tuscany and mistakenly ceding a great deal of time to Arroyo in L'Aquila. The team proved dominant in the race's final results, having Basso and Nibali on the podium and winning both the Trofeo Fast Team and Trofeo Super Team classifications. The other jersey awards were all won by Australian riders – Cadel Evans won the points classification, Matthew Lloyd the mountains classification, and Richie Porte the youth classification."

        "text": "Mike Welch (born June 11, 1951) is a former American football coach. He has served as the head football coach at Ithaca College from 1994 to 2016.\nAthlete.\nWelch attended high school in Dansville, New York, where he played football at the halfback and linebacker positions.\nWelch enrolled at Ithaca College athletics in 1969 and played both football and lacrosse. He played for Ithaca's varsity football team under College Football Hall of Fame coach Jim Butterfield from 1970 to 1972. After missing most of his sophomore year with an ankle injury, Welch gained 467 yards on 117 carries as a junior in 1971. As a senior in 1972, he played fullback and was selected as the team captain. He gained 257 yards on 61 attempts in 1972.\nCoaching career.\nRush–Henrietta Senior High School.\nWelch graduated from Ithaca in 1973 and worked from 1973 to 1976 as an assistant football coach at Rush–Henrietta Senior High School in Rochester, New York.\nAlbany.\nIn 1976, Welch became the offensive backs coach and later the defensive line coach at the University of Albany. He also received a master's degree in education from Albany in 1977.\nWashington University.\nWelch accepted the offensive coordinator position at Washington University in St. Louis in 1980 and remained there for four years.\nIthaca.\nIn 1984, Welch returned to Ithaca College as the school's linebacker coach. He later recalled, \"Coming back to Ithaca College as a coach became a goal of mine once I started coaching at the college level. This was and continues to be one of the best small college coaching jobs in the country. For Division III, it does not get much better than Ithaca College.\" Welch spent ten years as an assistant coach at Ithaca, and during that time, the football team won national championships in 1988 and 1991, made NCAA playoff appearances in 1985, 1986, 1990, and 1992, and participated in the Eastern College Athletic Conference (\"ECAC\") playoffs in 1984 and 1987.\nWelch took over as the head football coach in 1994 and, in his first season, led the Ithaca Bombers football team to a 10-3 record and a berth in the NCAA playoffs. Between 1994 and 2009, Welch led Ithaca to 16 consecutive winning seasons, a 128–46 record, and a .736 winning percentage. His teams have made the NCAA playoffs in 1994, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2008, and 2013. His teams have been ECAC playoff participants in 1996, 1998, 1999 and 2004. His best seasons as a head coach at Ithaca were: 2001, with an 11–2 record (.846 winning percentage) outscoring opponents 446 to 207; 2004, with a 9–2 record (.818 winning percentage) outscoring opponents 420 to 150 and 1994 with a 10-3 record and an appearance in the NCAA playoff semi-finals. \nIn 2006, Welch was elected to the American Football Coaches Association Board of Trustees. He is married to the former Susan Price with whom he has two children, Jessica and Jeff."

Of those, 20 were identified as contenders for medal positions, with Switzerland's Viktor Röthlin and Spain's José Ríos among the favourites. Also a contender was defending champion Italian Stefano Baldini, with the race billed as his return to racing after two years, since finishing 12th in the Olympic marathon. José Manuel Martínez, another Spaniard, was the leading European in the previous year's World Championships marathon where he finished eighth. Four of the Spanish runners warned before the race that heat and humidity would be the main handicaps to the competitors and force a slow and tactical race. The race would be run over four relatively flat laps of 10 km around the city of Barcelona.\nRace details.\nThe race started at 10:05 CEST with a field of 64 taking to the start line. It was run in hot conditions with the temperature at the start of the race and the humidity rated at 74 per cent. The early pace was set by Russian Yuriy Abramov, winner of the 2010 Moscow Marathon. However, when he fell back, Röthlin was among the leading pack. The Swiss runner set a pace that the rest of the field could not compete with and he ran the final quarter of the race by himself to win by two minutes 19 seconds on Swiss National Day. Second place was home runner Martínez, who said he could not compete with Röthlin's pace so instead decided to hold a steady rhythm and not get involved in any counter-attacks. Bronze medal winner was Russian Dmitriy Safronov. Röthlin's victory was only the fourth gold for Switzerland at the European championships and their first since shot putter Werner Günthör won in the 1986 championships. Baldini's attempt to defend his title ended when he pulled out half-way through the race. Only 45 of the athletes finished the race.\nThe race also counted for the European Cup team result, with the teams decided on the fastest sum time of their first three athletes. Hosts Spain won the gold, ahead of Russia and Italy.\nReaction.\nRöthlin said after the race: \"It's fantastic to do this on Swiss National Day. After everything that's happened over the past two years, this is incredible. I wouldn't have come had I not been in with a medal chance.\" He also made light of the warm weather, saying it was cool compared to the 2007 World Championships marathon in Osaka, Japan. Silver medalist Martínez said: \"I just tried ... not [to] get involved with any counter-attacks as I've tried in the past and I'm very satisfied with my silver.\""

        "text": "The 100 Guineas Cup, also known as the Hundred Guinea Cup (£100 Cup), or the Cup of One Hundred Sovereigns, was a regatta in 1851 which was the first competition for the trophy later named America's Cup. The trophy was valued at 100 pounds-sterling which led to its various names, all variations on 100 Pound Cup. The race was won by the yacht \"America\", leading to the trophy being renamed \"America's Cup\". The official event known as \"The America's Cup\" was founded in 1857, when the deed of gift established the racing regattas. The 1851 competition was a fleet race, whereas modern America's Cups finals are match races.\nHistory.\nThe race originated with an invitation for the Great Exhibition of 1851 by the Earl of Winton, then Commodore of the Royal Yacht Squadron (RYS), inviting the recently formed New York Yacht Club (NYYC) to enjoy the facilities of the clubhouse of the RYS. John Cox Stevens, Commodore of the NYYC responded positively, and anticipated racing. Due to the RYS rules of the time, other races in the 1851 RYS Regatta were restricted to RYS members and their self-owned yachts, so the R. Y. S. £100 Cup was established, open to anyone to enter. At a RYS meeting on 9 May 1851, the race was scheduled for 22 August 1851. This race was to be the first of a series of challenge races for successive £100 Cups. At the time, it was normal practise for the winners to own the cups that were won, and not to return them for the next race to be won by others.\nTrophy.\nThe trophy is a bottomless ewer made out of of silver, and is tall. The ewer was a stock item obtained from jeweler Robert Garrard in 1848. After the race, it was engraved with the names of the yachts that raced against America, except the runner-up \"Aurora\".\nRace.\nThe regatta, held on 22 August 1851, raced clockwise around the Isle of Wight in a fleet race. The course was called \"The Queen's Course\". The course was near Cowes Castle on the Isle of Wight, where the Royal Yacht Squadron headquarters are located. The race took place as part of the \"1851 Royal Yacht Squadron Regatta\". The signal gun for sailing was fired at 10am, and the winner saluted by a gun from the flag-ship at 8:34pm (8:37pm railway time).\n18 yachts were entered for the race, but only 15 yachts started the race. The yacht \"Fernande\" did not make the start, while \"Strella\" and \"Titania\" both got to the starting line, though did not start the race. Those yachts that raced were \"America\", \"Alarm\", \"Arrow\", \"Aurora\", \"Bacchante\", \"Beatrice\", \"Brilliant\", \"Constance\", \"Eclipse\", \"Freak\", \"Gipsy Queen\", \"Ione\", \"Mona\", \"Volante\", and \"Wyvern\"."

It was their fifth season in the County Championship and they won three matches to finish fifteenth in the Championship table.\n1899 season.\nDerbyshire played eighteen games in the County Championship in 1899, one match against MCC and one match against the touring Australians. They only won two matches in the County Championship, which left them at the bottom of the table. The early death of George Davidson from pneumonia in February had deprived Derbyshire of a valuable all-rounder with several years potential service ahead of him, and left the bowling dependent almost entirely upon Hulme, who had probably his best season with 93 first-class wickets in a very unfavourable summer for bowlers due to dry weather. The captain was Samuel Hill Wood in his first season as captain. Levi Wright was top scorer. William Storer played for England in the first test against Australia in June.\nThe most significant addition to the Derbyshire squad in the season was Joe Humphries who became a long-serving wicket keeper. John Young played the first of three seasons in which he played frequently, but the remainder who made their debut played only in 1899 or intermittently thereafter. George Gregory and Thomas Higson played intermittently up to 1910. Richard Kenward played one season and next played for Sussex. Albert Steeples, Leonard Ward and \nFrank Wright played one career first class match each during the season."

        "title": "Martin Jones (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Martin Jones (born January 10, 1990) is a Canadian ice hockey goaltender for the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League. He previously played for the Los Angeles Kings, San Jose Sharks, Philadelphia Flyers, and Seattle Kraken. A standout goaltender in junior with the Calgary Hitmen, Jones was named the Western Hockey League's goaltender of the year in 2009–10 and won a silver medal with Team Canada at the 2010 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships.\nJones started his professional career in the American Hockey League (AHL) with the Manchester Monarchs and made his NHL debut in 2013, where he spent two seasons with the Kings as backup to Jonathan Quick. In 2014, Jones won the Stanley Cup as a member of the Kings. Jones was traded to the Sharks in 2015, where he would serve as their starting goaltender for the next six seasons. He led the Sharks to their first Stanley Cup Finals appearance in franchise history in 2016, and was chosen to play in the NHL All-Star Game in 2017.\nPersonal life.\nJones was born in North Vancouver, British Columbia. His father, Harvey, is the Vice-President of Arena Operations with the Vancouver Canucks. He has a brother, Jordan, and a sister, Jocelyn. Jones felt that his father's position with the Canucks gave him some opportunities within the game that most other kids would not get. As a youth, he played in the 2003 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from North Vancouver. He played midget level with the Vancouver Northwest Giants of the BC Hockey Major Midget League. Jones attended Handsworth Secondary School and played ice hockey at the North Shore Winter Club.\nPlaying career.\nJunior.\nThe Calgary Hitmen selected Jones in the fourth round of the 2005 WHL Bantam Draft. He joined the Hitmen in 2006–07 and served as the backup to Dan Spence for two seasons. He was eligible for the 2008 NHL Entry Draft but went undrafted. Offered a try-out with the Los Angeles Kings, Jones impressed team scouts at Los Angeles' rookie camp, and following a strong showing at their main camp, the team signed him to a three-year contract before reassigning him back to the Hitmen. He emerged as Calgary's starting goaltender in 2008–09; his 45 wins for the Hitmen broke the team record of 39. He led the league in wins, finished tied for the league lead in shutouts (7) and finished third in goals against average (2.08). He backstopped the Hitmen to 12 consecutive wins in the playoffs, tying a league record, before the Hitmen lost the WHL championship series in six games to the Kelowna Rockets. Following the season, he was named a Second Team All-Star in the Eastern Conference. \nDuring the 2009–10 season with the Hitmen, Jones finished with a league-best GAA of 2.21 and was named a First Team All-Star in the Eastern Conference. In advance of his second consecutive appearance in the championship series, the league named him the winner of the Del Wilson Trophy as the WHL's top goaltender. During the season, he surpassed Spence's team record for career wins, and his 16 career shutouts are also a franchise record.\nProfessional.\nLos Angeles Kings.\nThe Kings assigned Jones to their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Manchester Monarchs to begin the 2010–11 season. He also played with the Ontario Reign of the ECHL for a time, but after posting a 16–3–0 record, .939 save percentage and 1.93 GAA in his first 22 games for the Monarchs, Jones was chosen to play in the 2011 AHL All-Star Game.\nHe was on the roster of the Los Angeles Kings as a spare when they won their first Stanley Cup, but did not play.\nJones finished fourth in the AHL with 27 wins in 2012–13 and was also among the league leaders in games played (56) and shutouts (5). Jones began the 2013–14 season with Manchester, but was recalled by Los Angeles on November 13, 2013, after Jonathan Quick suffered an injury. As the backup for the Kings, he did not get into game action for three weeks. Jones made his NHL debut on December 3 and earned a 3–2 victory over the Anaheim Ducks. He stopped all nine shooters he faced in a shootout to secure his first NHL win. Jones won his second NHL start and made 16 saves to record his first NHL shutout four nights later against the New York Islanders. He shut out the Montreal Canadiens in his next game, making him the first Kings goaltender to do so, and the second Los Angeles rookie to record consecutive shutouts, matching Gerry Desjardins, who did it in 1968–69. Jones then found himself a full-time NHL goaltender for the first time after backup Ben Scrivens was traded to Edmonton, making Jones the team's primary backup to starter Quick.\nSan Jose Sharks.\nOn June 26, 2015, Jones, set to become a restricted free agent on July 1, was traded to the Boston Bruins, along with Colin Miller and a first-round pick in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft (13th overall, Jakub Zbořil), in exchange for forward Milan Lucic. In turn, the Bruins traded Jones to the San Jose Sharks on June 30 in exchange for Sean Kuraly and a 2016 first-round pick. The Sharks signed him to a three-year contract worth $9 million.\nHaving his first season as a starting goaltender, Jones had 65 games in 2015–16 with the Sharks, finishing with a 2.27 goal-against average, .918 save percentage, and the second most shutouts in the regular season with six, next to Chicago Blackhawks netminder Corey Crawford with seven. Jones then helped the Sharks reach their first Stanley Cup Finals, starting 24 playoff games and having shutouts in three of them.\nOn July 1, 2017, Jones signed a six-year, $34.5 million contract extension.\nJones had a difficult start to the season, dropping four games in a row before he was benched in favor of Aaron Dell. A six-game winning streak in November was snapped by a loss to the Edmonton Oilers, and even during this stretch, Jones maintained a .891 save percentage. On December 11, 2019, the Sharks fired DeBoer in favor of Bob Boughner, who wanted to give Dell more playing time. By the new year, Jones was rarely starting in goal for San Jose: between January 1 and February 13, he started only three games, during which he went 0-2-1 with 4.32 GAA and a .857 save percentage. He seemed to improve afterwards, going 4-4-0 with a 2.02 GAA and .927 save percentage in his last eight games before the NHL season was indefinitely suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. When the NHL announced that it would not finish the regular season, but would immediately begin the 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs using the 24 highest-ranked teams in the league, the Sharks, who had the worst record in the Western Conference, were not invited to the postseason.\nBecause the season was condensed into 56 games due to the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Sharks began with a stretch of eight games in 15 days, Boughner chose to platoon Jones and Devan Dubnyk to prevent either goaltender from overexertion. On February 11, however, an unspecified injury to Dubnyk forced Jones to take over as the primary goaltender for San Jose, with rookie Alexei Melnichuk called up from the AHL as his backup. After struggling in his first 12 starts, with a 6–5–1 record, 3.85 GAA, and .877 save percentage, Jones seemed to rebound in March, with an 8–2–1 record, 2.26 GAA, and .931 save percentage in his next 12 starts. The improvement was short-lived and hindered by poor defense from Sharks skaters. By May, the Sharks, who had already been eliminated from playoff contention, were no longer starting Jones in goal, preferring to use Melnichuk and Josef Kořenář instead. Jones played 34 games in the 2020–21 season, during which he went 15–13–4 with a 3.28 GAA, .896 SV%, and one shutout.

The team was coached by John Beilein. The team played its home games in Ann Arbor, Michigan at the Crisler Arena, which has a capacity of 13,751, for the forty-fourth consecutive year. This season marked the team's ninety-fourth consecutive year as a member of the Big Ten Conference. The team witnessed the departure of its four tallest players and two leading scorers from the prior season. The incoming class featured the sons of two former National Basketball Association players (Tim Hardaway and Tito Horford) and the younger brother of a current one (Al Horford). Additionally Joe Dumars' son Jordan transferred to the team and Glenn Robinson's son, Glenn Robinson III verbally committed to the class of 2012. The season was marked by close losses against numerous highly ranked teams.\nAlthough the team began with a 1–6 record in conference play, they rebounded to finish with a 9–9 conference mark. This put them in a four-way tie for fourth and earned them a number four seed in the 2011 Big Ten Conference men's basketball tournament. For the fifth consecutive year they won their first game in the tournament, but lost in the semifinals to eventual champion Ohio State. They also earned a number eight seed in the 2011 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, where they logged a record-setting performance in the first game, but lost in their second game (in the round of 32).\nThe team was captained by Zack Novak, who became one of the forty Academic All-American finalists for the second year in a row, and Stu Douglass.

Mike Jackson left the Michigan basketball program to join rival Purdue and was replaced by LaVall Jordan, who previously served as an assistant coach for Iowa.\nThe team lost its four tallest contributors from the prior season: DeShawn Sims, Zack Gibson, Anthony Wright and Manny Harris. The same weekend that Harris declared for the 2010 NBA draft in late March, the team accepted a commitment from Jon Horford. Horford, who was named a 2010 Class A All-State performer from the Associated Press, the \"Detroit Free Press\" and the \"Detroit News\", is the younger brother of Atlanta Hawk Al Horford and son of former NBA player Tito Horford. Horford did not actually sign his letter of intent until the opening of the spring signing period on April 14. After Horford's signing, the Wolverines had two scholarships available. The 2010 class included Tim Hardaway Jr., son of Tim Hardaway. With the signings and loss of Ben Cronin to injury, the 2010–11 team's front court was composed of incoming freshmen Evan Smotrycz and Horford along with redshirt freshmen Blake McLimans and Jordan Morgan.\nJordan Dumars (son of Joe Dumars) transferred to the University of Michigan in January 2010 after playing in six games for the South Florida Bulls men's basketball team.

The controversy spread to \"The Washington Post\" where columnist Jason Reid noted that the film went out of its way to present inappropriate racial commentary when it described Duke basketball head coach Mike Krzyzewski recruits as Uncle Toms. Among those critical of the racial commentary was Duke player Grant Hill who was cited in an Associated Press story that ran in major national media outlets.

        "text": "Albert Russell Taylor (2 December 1914 – 9 October 1965) was a international rugby union player. He was selected for the 1938 British Lions tour to South Africa. Taylor played club rugby for Cross Keys RFC and Abergavenny RFC. Described by rugby historian John Griffiths as an 'intelligent, fast loose forward', Taylor is the only player to have represented the British and Irish Lions while representing Cross Keys.\nRugby career.\nTaylor first came to note as a rugby player when he represented his Grammar School at Pontywaun as a youth. As an adult he represented at all levels, club, county and international; and as a police officer also played for the Welsh Police Force. His first first class team was Cross Keys RFC, and it was with Cross Keys that he was first selected to represent Wales in the final game of the 1937 Home Nations Championship. The 1937 tournament was a low point for the Wales team, losing all three games; but despite being part of the losing side against Ireland, he was returned for the same encounter in the 1938 campaign, this time a win over the Irish. In the 1938 game against Ireland, Taylor scored his first international points with a try.\nIn 1938, Taylor was selected for the British Isles team to tour South Africa. Taylor played in 16 matches of the tour, including two Tests against the South Africa national rugby union team. Despite the British team losing the tour 2–1 to the South Africans, Taylor had a good tour, and ended the trip with the highest points across all the matches, scoring 53 points. This was mainly due to Taylor being given the kicking duties after first choice kicker, Vivian Jenkins, was forced to withdraw halfway through the tour. Three of his 53 points came from one of the South Africa matches, when he scored a penalty goal in the Second Test.\nOn his return from South Africa, Taylor was selected for one final match for Wales, the opening game against England as part of the 1939 Home Nations Championship. The game ended in a two-nil loss for the Welsh. The next season, while still representing Cross Keys at club level, Taylor was approached to play for invitational touring team, the Barbarians. In his career he also played county rugby for Monmouthshire. Taylor later switched clubs, joining Abergavenny, and after his playing career ended, served on the Abergavenny committee and was also its vice-president. After World War II, he switched clubs again, joining Newport, and played 46 games for the senior team over two seasons."

Tom Izzo led the Spartans in his 16th year at Michigan State. The team played their home games at the Breslin Center in East Lansing, Michigan, and competed in the Big Ten Conference. The Spartans finished the season 19–15, 9–9 in Big Ten play to finish in a tie for fourth place. The Spartans lost in the semifinals of the Big Ten tournament and received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament, their 14th consecutive appearance. As a No. 10 seed, they lost in the round of 64 to UCLA.\nPrevious season.\nThe Spartans finished the 2009–10 season 28–9, 14–4 in Big Ten play to finish in a three-way tie for the regular season championship. MSU lost in the quarterfinals of the Big Ten tournament to Minnesota. Michigan State received a No. 5 seed in the NCAA tournament, their 13th straight trip to the tournament. There, they defeated New Mexico State, Maryland, Northern Iowa, and Tennessee to advance to the Final Four, their sixth overall trip and second consecutive trip under Tom Izzo. In the Final Four, they lost to Butler.\nOffseason.\nThe Spartans lost Raymar Morgan (11.3 points and 6.2 rebounds per game) to graduation following the season. Chris Allen was also dismissed from the team following the season.\nSeason summary.\nThe Spartans were led by seniors, Kalin Lucas (17.0 points and 3.4 assists per game) and Durrell Summers (11.6 points and 4.2 rebounds per game), and junior Draymond Green (12.6 points, 8.6 rebounds, and 4.1 assists per game). On the strength of their trip to the Final Four the previous year, the team began the season ranked No. 2 in the country. The Spartans made their second trip under Izzo to the Maui Invitational and were upset again, this time by UConn. In the third place game, Michigan State defeated No. 13 Washington. MSU suffered further losses to No. 1 Duke in the ACC-Big Ten Challenge, No. 8 Syracuse in the Jimmy V Classic, and No. 18 Texas. They finished the non-conference portion of their season 8–4 and ranked No. 20 in the country.\nOn January 26, 2011, backup point guard Korie Lucious, who averaged 6.5 points and 4.1 assists per game for the Spartans, was dismissed from the team.\nThe Spartans were inconsistent in conference play, beating No. 14 Minnesota and No. 20 Wisconsin, but suffering nine losses in conference and finishing the regular season with a 17–13 overall record and 9–9 in conference and in danger of missing the NCAA Tournament. After beating Iowa and blowing out No. 9 Purdue in the Big Ten tournament, the Spartans fell to Penn State in the semifinals. The blowout win over Purdue likely ensured the Spartans inclusion in the NCAA Tournament.\nMichigan State received a No. 10 seed in the Southeast Region of the NCAA tournament, their 14th straight appearance, but the lowest seeding the Spartans had received in the NCAA Tournament since 2002. The Spartans faced No. 7-seeded UCLA in the second round (formerly known as the first round). They trailed by as many as 23 points in the first half and trailed 42–24 at the half. In the second half, MSU began to foul on nearly every possession and closed the lead, outscoring UCLA 52–36 in the half.

The event was organised by rugby's European governing body, the FIRA – Association of European Rugby (FIRA-AER). The competition was contested by 32 men's junior national teams and was held in early April 2009. It was hosted by the French region of Var - Côte d'Azur, with the final held in Toulon.\nThe tournament was won by France, who won its fourth European championship and its third in a row, with England finishing runners-up.

The first championship in 2004 was won by France.\nThe following two championships, held in Lille, France, in 2005 and again in Treviso in 2006, were won by England. Alternating between France and Italy, the next three championships were held in Biarritz, Treviso again, and Toulon in 2009. All three were taken out by France, but of Europes top rugby playing nations, Wales and Scotland did not take part in the latest editions.\nFormat.\nThe championship, similar to previous editions, was organised in an A, B, C and D Division, with A being the highest and D the lowest. Each division consisted of eight teams and each team played three competition games, with a quarter final, semi final and final/placing game.\nThe quarter finals were played according to a seeding list, with the winners moving on to the first to fourth place semi finals while the losers would enter the fifth to eighth place semi finals.\nThe winners of the semi-finals one to four would play in the division final while the losers would play for third place. Similarly, the winners of the fifth to eighth semi finals would play for fifth place while the losers would play for seventh.\nThe winner of the A division was crowned European champions while the eighth placed team would originally be relegated to the B division. Similarly, the winner of B, C and D division would move up a division for 2010 while the last placed teams would nominally be relegated. This meant, France was crowned European champions while Italy finished on the relegation spot, but was reprieved of relegation by England choosing not to participate in the 2010 tournament. Germany won the B division, Czech Republic the C division and Luxembourg the D. The last placed teams, for the same reason as Italy, were all spared relegation, too.\nWith a Côte d'Azur Selection, a non-national team took part to provide even numbers in all four divisions. With Armenia and Monaco, two teams took part that hadn't taken part in previous editions and would not do so again in 2010, while Bosnia and Herzegovina, which had played the previous two tournaments, did also not take part in 2010.\nThe teams of England, Italy and Ireland at the tournament were \"B\" selections, as these nations had committed themselves to an Under-18 Festival in Parma, Italy, where Wales and Scotland also took part. The French team however opted to take part in the European Championship instead.\nVenues.\nThe games of the 2009 championship were played at the following locations:\nTeams and final standings.\nThe participating teams and their final standings were:\nGames.\nThe results of the games:"

        "title": "COBRA Rugby Tens",
        "text": "COBRA 10s is the world's premier rugby tens tournament which is organized annually by the COBRA Rugby Club of Malaysia. The tournament is held each November at the MBPJ Stadium in Petaling Jaya, Malaysia.\nThe first COBRA 10s tournament was held in 1967. Today, 16 top teams from around the world compete for the coveted Hui Weng Chun Challenge Trophy and title as Tens champion.\nHSBC Bank, a name globally recognised and synonymous with rugby had been the tournament's main sponsor from 2005 to 2012. Since 2013 COBRA has been organizing the tournament without a title sponsor but with the assistance two main sponsors; Carlsberg Marketing Malaysia and IJM Corporation Berhad. The club has also been supported by many other sponsors.\nOverview.\nA Tens game lasts 20 minutes except for the final, which lasts 30 minutes. Played fast and furious, it is an exciting variation of the popular game of rugby Sevens but more closely related to the rugby Fifteens format. The Tens allows both forward and back line play. The key factor here is all-round skills are translated into teamwork at fast pace.\nYearly, a total of 16 top teams from all over the world are invited to participate in this prestigious tournament which is played over two days.\nHistory.\nAlthough Malaysia may seem an unlikely place for the making of rugby history, yet it was here that 10-a-side rugby was born. The world's first 10 a-side rugby tournament was held in Malaysia in 1967. The Tens tournament was indeed a brainchild of a menagerie of Combined Old Boys Rugby Association (COBRA) members. The Tens game was conceived on the barstools of their favourite after match haunt. The idea was to create a format of play that is fast and open but still retains much of the character of the 15s version.\nEarly years.\nThe COBRA 10s in its early years was mainly contested by local clubs and several invited foreign teams. The tournament was keenly contested between the expatriate- dominated Royal Selangor Club and COBRA. Then the military took over. First the Royal Australian Artillery Regiment, then the 16th and then 1st Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment (RNZIR) made the 10s their own - except for brief interruptions by COBRA in 1972 and 1975. The RNZIR in fact won it for seven straight years until most of them were shipped back to New Zealand, thus allowing the curiously named Bunnies to take the title in 1985. The Police took it for two years in a row but the stragglers of the RNZIR, in their final year in Malaysia, wrested the trophy for one last time.\nRecent events.\nIn 1992, the COBRA Tens went fully international. That year Australian champions, Randwick of Sydney, defeated a very strong Marist St. Joseph of Samoa in a thoroughly fascinating encounter . For the first time, rugby luminaries, namely Lawrence Dallaglio (former England captain), Australian hooker, and later captain, Phil Kearns, and All Black Olo Brown played on Malaysian soil. Subsequent tournaments have featured internationals such as Tony Underwood (England), Waisale Serevi (Fiji), Brian Lima (Samoa), Uale Mai (Samoa), Amasio Valence (New Zealand) among many other notable names in rugby. Belgium Barbarians was invited in 2007.\nVenue.\nThe inaugural COBRA 10s tournament was held at the Astaka Field in Petaling Jaya in 1967 and during the tournament's early years, the Astaka field became the home of the Tens.\nWhen the first fully international version of the COBRA 10s was introduced in 1992, the Kuala Lumpur Stadium in Cheras became the new home of the Tens and for subsequent tournaments till 1997.\nSince then the COBRA 10s is held annually at the MBPJ Stadium in Petaling Jaya, Malaysia. The stadium, which was built in preparation for the 1998 Commonwealth Games, was also the venue for the Commonwealth Games Rugby Sevens. The COBRA 10s was brought back to the Astaka field in Petaling Jaya for brief moments in 1998 and 2009.\nTournament format.\nGrouping of teams.\n16 teams will be grouped into four groups of four.\nDay 1 - Preliminary round.\nThe Preliminary Rounds shall be played in accordance with a round robin format. Each team shall play three matches against teams within their group.\nPoints will be awarded as follows :\nDay 2 - Knockout round.\nIn the second round, the two top teams in each group will advance to the Cup/Plate Championship Pool.\nThe 3rd and 4th placed teams in each group will advance to the Bowl Championship pool.\nCup Championship pool.\nQuarter-finals :\nThe winners in the Cup Championship pool will advance to the Cup Semi Finals (while the losers will advance to the Plate Semi Finals).\nCup Semi Finals :\nSemi finals shall be played on a knock-out system\nPlate Championship pool.\nThe losers of the Cup/Plate Quarter Finals will advance to the Plate Semi Finals.\nSemi Finals :\nSemi finals shall be played on a knock-out system\nBowl Championship pool.\nQuarter-finals :\nQuarter Finals will be played on a knock-out basis.\nBowl Semi Finals :\nSemi finals shall be played on a knock-out system.\nDevelopment activities.\nDuring the week of the tournament, rugby development activities are conducted with the assistance from participating teams. \nAmong the activities organised are : "

Harvard competes as a member of the Ivy League and plays its home games at Cumnock Turf and Harvard Stadium in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\nHistory.\nHarvard fielded its first lacrosse team in 1878, and the following year, joined the United States National Amateur Lacrosse Association alongside New York University and nine club teams. In 1881, Harvard defeated Princeton to win the first intercollegiate lacrosse tournament. In 1882, the Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association was formed, and the following season also inducted the newly established Yale lacrosse team. Harvard and Princeton dominated the league throughout the 1880s, and the Crimson claimed the title in 1882, 1885, 1886, and 1887. The United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse League (USILL) was formed in 1905, divided into a Northern Division and Southern Division. Championships were awarded in each division based on record and strength of schedule. Harvard was named the Northern Division champions six consecutive seasons from 1908 to 1913, and again in 1915.\nIn 1941, Navy refused to play the integrated Harvard team, so its athletic director ordered home its one black player rather than forfeit the game. The Crimson secured the Ivy League championship with the best league record in 1964*, 1980*, 1990* and 2014* (* denotes title shared with at least one other team). In 1971, the NCAA established the national championship tournament. Harvard made its first appearance in 1980, when it lost in the first round to Johns Hopkins, 16–12. The Crimson returned to the event in 1988 and were edged, 10–9, by Navy in the opening round. In 1990, Harvard won its first NCAA tournament game when it defeated Notre Dame, 9–3. In the quarterfinals, the Crimson were beaten handily, 18–3, by North Carolina. Harvard returned to the quarterfinals in 1996, after beating Hofstra, 15–12, and then fell to eventual national runners-up Virginia, 23–12. It was a decade before the Crimson again reached the tournament. They were beaten in the 2006 first round by Syracuse, 11–4.\nSeason results.\nThe following is a list of Harvard's results by season as an NCAA Division I program:\n†NCAA canceled 2020 collegiate activities due to the COVID-19 virus.\n†† Ivy League cancelled 2021 collegiate season due to the COVID-19 virus."

        "text": "In basketball, a block (short for blocked shot) occurs when a defender deflects or stops a field goal attempt without committing a foul. The National Collegiate Athletic Association's (NCAA) Division I players on this list all accomplished the rare feat of blocking 13 shots in a single game. The 1985–86 season was the first that statistics on blocks were first compiled by the NCAA.\nThe highest single game block total by one player in NCAA Division I men's basketball history is 16, set by Mickell Gladness of Alabama A&amp;M on February 24, 2007 against Texas Southern. Although Gladness holds the single-game record, it is Jarvis Varnado of Mississippi State who claims the all-time career blocked shots record (564). Varnado never blocked 13 or more shots in a game, however. Through the 2015–16 season, only 18 different players have reached the 13-block mark. Among them, Gladness is the only player to have reached 16 blocks, nobody has blocked 15, five players have reached 14, and twelve players have hit 13 blocks.\nDavid Robinson once blocked 14 shots in a game while playing for Navy, and is the only player on this list to be inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\nIn the era before blocks were officially tracked by the entire NCAA, on December 3, 1983, Hakeem Olajuwon blocked 16 shots in a game while playing for the University of Houston against Biscayne. The blocks are a school record and would have tied the NCAA Division I record. Like Robinson, Olajuwon has also been inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame.\nIn the 1950s Bill Russell's shot-blocking ability was touted in his junior and senior year, but there were no official statistics of blocks then and scant film of survives from his college career. However, film exists of his final game as a college player, in which his University of San Francisco team clinched the NCAA championship for the second year in a row to cap an undefeated season, and Russell is unofficially credited with 20 blocked shots in that game (to go with 26 points and 27 rebounds, a double-triple-double)."

        "text": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1873 was the third cricket season which the English club Derbyshire played. Officials and supporters were disappointed that they had been unable to arrange further first-class fixtures than the two against Lancashire, but they managed to arrange an extra match against Nottinghamshire, who were a leading team at the time.\n1873 season.\nDerbyshire played two first-class matches in their third year, both against Lancashire, and lost both. They also played a match against Nottinghamshire which they won having five additional players.\nSamuel Richardson was captain in his third season. The death of bowler Dove Gregory on 21 May at the age of 35 left a potential hole, but it was amply filled by William Mycroft' an ironstone miner and later publican, making his debut in the season. Derbyshire further strengthened their side with the arrival of Alfort Smith as wicket-keeper from Lancashire, and Thomas Foster, both from the cotton mills of Glossop, and William Rigley a blacksmith. These three subsequently saw several years of service with the club. Other new players were Rev. William Humble, a local curate, who played occasionally over a few years, Thomas Howarth another cotton worked from Glossop who put in a single career first class appearance. Veteran president William Jervis, a lawyer, stepped in for one game. Additional players who made up the 16 member side against Nottinghamshire were John Frost, a joiner from Wirksworth, who played first-class for Derbyshire in the following season, Rev. Robert Moncreiff later 3rd Baron Moncreiff and unidentified players W Allen and Edward Tatlow.\nIn their first match against Lancashire, Derbyshire made 88 in the first innings, and Lancashire replied with 118. Derbyshire were all out for 52 in their second innings, no player scoring double figures, and Lancashire took the runs needed to win for the loss of one wicket. In the second match Lancashire set up a score of 238 in their first innings, and Derbyshire made 70 in response and followed on to make 86.\nIn the match against Nottinghamshire, played at Wirksworth, Derbyshire scored 116 in the first innings and got Nottinghamshire out for 14. In the follow-on, Nottinghamshire were all out for 72. Although Derbyshire had an advantage with 16 players to Nottinghamshire's 11, the result was astounding. The story has been handed down that before their innings, Nottinghamshire were lavishly entertained by a keen and generous supporter of Derbyshire who owned a wine and spirit business, where he blended potent and attractive spirit.\nWilliam Curgenven scored most runs in first-class matches, and William Mycroft took most wickets in the season."

The Bearkats have fielded a basketball team since 1917, excluding the 1942–43 and 1943–44 basketball seasons. Basketball was not played these years because World War II had decimated male enrollment at Sam Houston. Success began early as Sam Houston went 43–11 during its first five years, including an unblemished 24–0 record during its first three.\nDuring the 21st century, Sam Houston's men's basketball program boasts the second-winningest program in Texas Division I, only behind Texas. The Bearkats are also the winningest program in the Southland Conference during the last decade.\nHome Courts.\nDue to a lack of funds, it was not until 1924 that the school built the Men's Gymnasium, near the corner of 20th (now Bowers) and Avenue I. Nicknamed the \"Cracker Box\" Gym, the building was wood framed and lasted until the 1950s. Its most famous moment, though, did not involve athletics, but a visit by First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt in 1937.\nAfter the demolition of the Men's Gym the school built what is referred to as the New Gymnasium or Bearkat Gymnasium (depending on the source), opening in 1956 at the corner of 20th (now Bowers) and Avenue J. This gym had room for 3,000 as well as dormitory space under the seats, and was the team's home for another 20 seasons until the opening of the University Coliseum, now known as the Bernard G. Johnson Coliseum. Located at 20th (now Bowers) and Avenue H (now Bobby K. Marks Dr), this arena still serves the university today. The second gym has undergone several conversions and is now known as Academic Building Three.\nPostseason appearances.\nNCAA Division I Tournament.\nThe Bearkats have appeared in two NCAA Division I Tournaments.

        "text": "Joseph Earl Campbell (born March 10, 1944) is a retired professional baseball player. He played the outfield position, and batted and threw right-handed. Campbell was born in Louisville, Kentucky. He played one game in Major League Baseball with the Chicago Cubs. Campbell had no hits in that game. Campbell also played four seasons in the minor leagues and over his career he batted .238 with 252 hits, 46 doubles, seven triples, and 41 home runs in 342 games played. The majority of his games in the minors came in the outfield, however, Campbell also played third base and first base. Outside of baseball, Campbell was a member of the United States Marine Corps.\nAmateur career.\nCampbell was a teammate of Denny Doyle at both Caverna High School in Horse Cave, Kentucky and Morehead State University. At Caverna High School, he and Doyle won a state high school baseball championship in 1961. Playing college baseball for the Morehead State Eagles baseball team, he was named All-Ohio Valley Conference in 1965.\nProfessional career.\nNew York Mets.\nIn the first ever Major League Baseball amateur draft in 1965, Campbell was selected by the New York Mets in the 44 round. This made him the first person selected from Morehead State in MLB's amateur draft. Campbell began his professional career that season with the rookie-level Marion Mets of the Appalachian League. In eight games, Campbell batted .385 with 10 hits, one double, and one home run. Later that season, he was promoted to the Class-A Greenville Mets of the Western Carolinas League. With Greenville, he batted .220 with 37 hits, four doubles, three triples, and six home runs in 52 games. He also pitched one game for Greenville and gave up one earned run in two innings pitched. Combined on the 1965 season, Campbell batted .242 with 47 hits, five doubles, three triples, and seven home runs in 60 games.\nCampbell played most of the 1966 season with the Class-A Greenville Mets, however, he also spent time with the Double-A Williamsport Mets. With Greenville, Campbell .279 with 114 hits, 24 doubles, 3 triples, and 22 home runs in 120 games. That season, he led the Greenville Mets in home runs; and was second in doubles, and at-bats (408). At the Double-A level, Campbell batted .056 with one run, one hit, one double, three runs batted in (RBIs), and nine bases on balls (walks) in nine games. On the season, he had a combined average of .270 between the two teams.\nChicago Cubs.\nOn November 28, 1966, during Major League Baseball's annual rule 5 draft, Campbell was selected from the New York Mets' organization by the Chicago Cubs. He missed most of spring training with the Cubs due to obligations in the United States Marine Corps, which he was a member of. Campbell played his first and only game in the majors on May 3, 1967, against the Atlanta Braves. In that game, Campbell had three at-bats and struck out in all of them.\nLater career.\nAfter his only game in the majors, Campbell was returned to the New York Mets organization. He split the 1967 season between the Class-A Durham Bulls, and the Class-A Winter Haven Mets. With the Bulls, Campbell batted .198 with 26 hits, five doubles, three home runs, 11 RBIs, and three stolen bases in 42 games. In 38 games with Winter Haven, Campbell batted .165 with 17 hits, three doubles, four home runs, 14 RBIs, and three stolen bases. On the season, he had a combined batting average of .184. In his final professional season, 1968, Campbell played for the Class-A Raleigh-Durham Mets, and the Double-A Memphis Blues. With Raleigh-Durham, he batted .259 with 36 hits, six doubles, and five home runs in 50 games. Campbell spent 23 games with the Blues and batted .172 with five runs, 11 hits, three doubles, 1 triple, and four RBIs."

        "text": "Cycling in the Australian state of New South Wales (including its capital Sydney) is a common form of recreation.\nCommon cycling activities in NSW include\nParticipation.\nThe National Walking and Cycling Participation Survey for 2023 found the following participation rates for cycling in NSW\nBicycle User Groups.\nSydney BUGs.\nSydney BUGS range from University clubs to commuter groups.\nRegional Trails.\nBicycle routes in NSW are poorly marked, if markings are present, and route mapping is predominantly the responsibility of the cyclist. In particular, separated cycleways or shared paths have their entrances and exits poorly marked for cyclists using the NSW system of highways for travel. State mandated routes do exist chiefly as part of the aspiration for a Coastline cycleway, though these are disconnected and sporadic, with long routes in the Illawarra and Hunter Valley.\nOccasionally regional council routes manage to connect, though often this is due to the accident of high-speed routes following major vehicle highways as on-road facilities on the shoulder, such as the link between Maitland and Newcastle via the New England Highway's shoulder.\nMost regional bicycle trails and routes tend to be disconnected sections of shared pathway, aimed predominantly at leisure or local shopping purposes.\nPublic transport.\nBuses.\nBicycles are generally not carried on buses operated by the Government in NSW cities and towns. There are some exceptions, such as when cyclists are stranded by a ferry or train service being cancelled and buses are organised to carry passengers, including their bicycles.\nBicycles are carried by NSW TrainLink and private coaches on regional routes.\nFerries.\nSee here for details about taking bicycles on ferries in Sydney.\nTrains.\nFor the price of a child's ticket, you can take your bicycle on NSW TrainLink Endeavour and Xplorer services to regional areas such as Kiama, Goulbourn and Canberra and Armidale. Hanging space is provided for bicycles in every second carriage.\nXPT services (Melbourne, Brisbane, Dubbo) require bicycles to be boxed and placed in the luggage car.\nRegulations.\nCyclists have the same rights and responsibilities as other road users, but have additional rules specific to them. They are permitted to ride two abreast, and travel in \"Transit Lanes\" and \"Bus Lanes\", but not \"Bus Only Lanes\" and are allowed to \"hook turn\" at intersections and roundabouts. Cyclists can only ride on a footpath if they're under the age of 16 or supervising a child under 16. NSW and Victoria are the only states to impose restrictions on footpath riding. All relevant regulations are defined in the latest Road Rules.\nSince 1989 Australian cyclists must wear a helmet at all times, and are required to have a working bell and proper reflectors and night lighting when riding at night.\nThere is no requirement for cyclists to be registered however there was an unsuccessful attempt to force riders to carry ID.\nMotorist Regulations.\nCars must stay a minimum of 1m away from cyclists when passing under 60 km/h and 1.5m when travelling over 60 km/h and are permitted to cross white lines to do so.\nRelevant Legislation.\nRoad Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999 No 20 \nPart 3 Division 1 Section 43 Menacing driving"

Habana has also scored more international tries outside his home country than any other player in history, with a total of 38 either away or at neutral venues.\nHabana made his international debut for South Africa against England at Twickenham in 2004. It was during this match that Habana scored his first try, before scoring two tries against Scotland a week later. Habana played in South Africa's winning 2007 Rugby World Cup campaign, where he finished the tournament as the leading try scorer with eight, including four tries in a single match against Samoa.\nWhen Habana scored a try against Italy on 21 November 2009, it meant that he had scored a try against each of the \"Tier 1\" nations. The following year Habana scored another two tries against Italy in separate matches, the second of which brought Habana's total to 38, equalling the South African record set by Joost van der Westhuizen. Habana remained level with van der Westhuizen, failing to score for almost fifteen months, before ending his drought at the 2011 World Cup against Namibia. Habana became the second South African to win the IRPA Try of the Year for his try against New Zealand in 2012. Running between two defending players and chipping the ball over a third, Habana slid in to score in the South African's 21–11 defeat in the 2012 Rugby Championship.\nInternational tries.\nKey"

        "text": "The 2011 Super Rugby season was the first season of the new 15-team format for the Super Rugby competition, which involved teams from Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. Including its past iterations as Super 12 and Super 14, this was the 16th season for the Southern Hemisphere's premier transnational club competition. The season kicked off in February 2011, with pre-season matches held from mid-January. It finished in early July to allow players a recovery period for the 2011 Rugby World Cup to be held in September and October; in future non-World Cup years, the competition will extend into August.\nThis season saw the arrival of the Melbourne Rebels, admitted to the competition as Australia's fifth team after entry by the Southern Kings from South Africa was denied. This was also the first season of a revamped competition format, with a greater focus on matches within each participating country and an expanded finals series.\nDuring this season, the first ever Super Rugby game was played outside the SANZAR region, taking place at Twickenham Stadium between the Crusaders and the Sharks. The match was moved to Twickenham because of the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake. Proceeds of the game were also donated to the relief effort.\nThe final was played at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane between the Queensland Reds and the Crusaders. The Reds won 18–13 to claim their first Super Rugby title.\nCompetition format.\nCovering 21 weeks, the schedule featured a total of 125 matches. The 15 teams were grouped by geography, labelled the Australian Conference, New Zealand Conference and the South African Conference. With the new format, the regular season consisted of two types of matches:\nThe top team of each conference, plus the next top three teams in table points regardless of conference (wild card teams), moved on to the finals. The top two conference winners, based on table points, receive first-round byes. In the first round of the finals, the third conference winner is the No. 3 seed and hosts the wild card team with the worst record, and the best wild card team hosts the second-best wild card team. In the semi-finals, the No. 2 conference winner hosts the higher surviving seed from the first round, and the No. 1 conference winner hosts the other first-round winner. The final is hosted by the top remaining seed.\nStandings.\nSource: NZ Herald\nLegend:\nPoints breakdown:\nThe overall standings classification system:\nNotes:\nFixtures.\nRound 2.\nNote * : The match was cancelled and called a draw due to the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake.\nPlayer statistics.\nLeading try scorers.\nSource: South African Rugby Union\nLeading point scorers.\nSource: South African Rugby Union"

        "text": "The Oval (also known as the Kennington Oval and, due to sponsorship reasons, the Kia Oval) is a cricket ground in London, England, it was established in 1845 and has a capacity of 23,500. International cricket has been played at the ground since 1880, when England played Australia in the first Test match staged in England. One Day Internationals (ODIs) have also been played at the ground, the first of these was in 1973 between England and the West Indies. 178 Test centuries have been scored at the Oval along with 39 ODI centuries.&lt;ref name=\"Statsguru: Test matches / Batting records / Innings by innings list\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"Statsguru: One-Day Internationals / Batting records / Innings by innings list\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nThe Englishman W. G. Grace scored the first Test century at the ground, Grace made 152 against Australia in 1880. In 1938 Len Hutton, another Englishman, broke the record for the highest individual Test innings. Hutton, with his score of 364, surpassed Wally Hammond's previous record of 336 not out. Hutton's innings was the only Test triple century scored at the Oval until Hashim Amla's treble in July 2012, and is still the highest by an Englishman at any ground.&lt;ref name=\"Records / Test matches / Batting records / Most runs in an innings\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Herbert Sutcliffe is the only man to have scored five Test centuries at the ground, while Hammond, Hutton, David Gower and Kevin Pietersen have all scored four centuries.

        "title": "Bamburi Rugby Super Series",
        "text": "The Bamburi Super Series was an East African Rugby union competition with eight teams in total, five teams from Kenya (Lions, Rhinos, Sharks, Cheetahs and Buffaloes) two from Uganda (Rwenzori and Victoria) and one from Tanzania (Twigas) that is currently defunct. It is closely based on the Super Rugby competition in the southern hemisphere. Games take place at the RFUEA Ground in Nairobi (Kenya), Friedkin Recreation Centre in Arusha (Tanzania) and the Kyadondo Grounds, Kampala (Uganda). Rhinos have won the most titles with four wins, and are the only team to have defended a title when they beat the Cheetahs 25–5 in the 2010 final.\nScoring system.\nThe current scoring system per match is listed below.\nTeams.\nThe teams consists of players drawn from two or three club teams. Trials are held by each franchise from which the best 30 players are picked to represent the team in the tournament. This combination of players from many clubs allows for a higher quality of rugby to be played.\nThere are eight teams in total:\nIn the first few years of the tournament, the clubs that made up the various franchises would change from year to year in an effort to maintain a balanced competition. Since 2008 the emphasis has been on retaining more stability in order to allow for the development of fan loyalty and stronger spectator support from year to year.\nHistory.\nOriginal Structure.\nThe original aim of the competition was to encourage the development of rugby in Kenya and to provide a proving ground for players at a level higher than club rugby and thus help the selectors of the Kenya XV's squad do their job. It was also hoped that it would give the 15-a-side code of the game more exposure in Kenya; after the recent successes of the national sevens team, the Kenyan public are very aware and supportive of the shorter form of the game, but somewhat ignorant of the original sport. Four franchise teams (Rhinos, Buffaloes, Lions and Cheetahs) were created within Kenya and all the matches were played at the RFUEA Ground in Nairobi. The tournament was played on a round-robin format and the top two teams qualified for the final.\nExpansion and Development.\nIn 2007, plans were made to expand the tournament beyond four teams for the first time. It was hoped that a Tanzanian and two Ugandan teams would be able to be included and that some matches could be played in Mombasa, Arusha and Kampala. Unfortunately these plans did not come to fruition. However, 2007 was the first year that games were played outside of the Kenyan capital, it was decided to move two matches to Nakuru as part of the development of the sport in the grass root level. Three teams were based in Nairobi while the other team was based in Kisumu.\nIn 2008 the competition was expanded to six teams with the inclusion of the Twigas from Tanzania and a new Kenya franchise, the Sharks. The Twigas franchise drew players from all the clubs within Tanzania.\nIn 2009, two Ugandan teams, the Victoria and the Rwenzori franchises, joined the competition. Rwenzori had been selected as the senior national team so that the series could serve as a warm-up for the RWC qualifiers in June while Victoria was mainly a development side of youngsters trying to break into the national team. The 4-week tournament was staged in Nairobi, Nakuru and Kisumu (Kenya), Kampala (Uganda) and Arusha (Tanzania). In keeping with objectives of the tournament to develop rugby at all levels, Mini, Schools and Women's competitions were incorporated into the events.\nIn 2010, the number of teams increased to eight with the overdue inclusion of the Tanzanian Twigas. The 2009 finalists, the Buffaloes, shifted their home base from Nakuru to Mumias in Western Kenya. The teams were drawn into two groups. Group A consisted of Cheetahs, Lions, Sharks and Twigas, Group B included Rhinos, Buffaloes, Rwenzori and Victoria.\nThere has also been talk of building on the success of the Victoria Cup, which has successfully brought Kenya, Uganda and Zimbabwe together in international competition, and expanding the Super Series to include one or more franchises from Zimbabwe.\nSponsorship and Finances.\nThe first Rugby Super Series in 2003 was sponsored by Unga Group Limited, a Kenyan flour milling company whose flagship maize flour product is \"Jogoo\". Maize meal is the staple food of East Africa when made into ugali (also called sima or posho). Jogoo is the Swahili word for cockerel, and the 2003 tournament was called the Jogoo Rugby Super Series. The year after that the tournament title sponsor was UAP Insurance of Uganda. It wasn't until the completion of the third year of the series that Bamburi Cement agreed to sponsor the competition; it has remained the title sponsor ever since.\nIn 2007, the KRFU received KSh.5 million for the title sponsorship deal from the cement firm Bamburi. In 2009, this had risen to KSh.9 million. Additionally, KSh.2.5 million were given by the Kenya Bureau of Standards to be used to support the referees' programs run by KRFU for the whole year starting with the Rugby Super Series tournament.\nIn 2010 the Bamburi commitment was increased to KSh.11 million (5.5 million/= for publicity, 2.5 million to run the tournament, 2 million/= for the players' kits and 1 million to the prize kitty) and previous title sponsors UAP Insurance returned to inject KSh.500,000. In addition, Maxam Ltd (a Kenyan beer distributor) agreed to significantly increase their contribution from last year to KSh.850,000 thus giving them the status of \"Associate sponsor\" and Heineken beer has become the \"official beer for the tournament\".\nCompetition details.\n2006.\n2006, first matches on 11 March, finals held on 1 April.\n2007.\nPlayed between 3 March and 31 March. Round two, Cheetahs defeated Lions 16-0 while Rhinos beat Buffaloes 32–20. Round three played in Nakuru, reigning champions Cheetahs played Rhinos while Lions faced Buffaloes later the same day.\n2008.\nOn Saturday 5 April, the finals were held at RFUEA Ground, the plate final was the Cheetahs against the Sharks at 2:00pm followed by the Lions versus Rhinos at 4:00pm in the final.\n2009.\nSemi finals, Buffaloes (captained by Vincent Mose) beat Sharks in the semi-final 21-11 and the Rhinos beat Rwenzori 30–20. Final held on Saturday 18 April, the Rhinos Defeated the Buffaloes 30–13 at the RFUEA Ground in Nairobi. Uganda's Rwenzori took third place after beating the Sharks of Kenya 22–19. Uganda's Rwenzori finished third and bagged a KSh.3 million/= cash prize.\n2010.\nIn 2010 the Super Series attracted eight teams and group matches were played in Nairobi and Nakuru (Kenya), Arusha (Tanzania) and Kampala (Uganda). The first matches were played on Saturday 24 April. In Nairobi, the Cheetahs beat the Lions 7–52 in the so-called \"cat fight\" and then the Rhinos beat the Buffaloes 61–0. At Arusha, the Twigas lost 3–79 to the Sharks and in Kampala Rwenzori lost 13–16 to Victoria.\nOn Tuesday 11 May, Joshua 'Tariq' Gathumbi, (Mang'u High School, Strathmore University RFC, Impala RFC, Sharks and former national Sevens squad member) collapsed and died. His last contribution to Kenyan rugby was a stunning try in his side's 20–30 loss to the Cheetahs just three days prior to his death. Impala RFC has retired his favourite number 25 shirt.\n2011.\nIn 2011 Super Series was contested as follows:\nSee also.\nEast Africa rugby union team"

        "title": "SummerSlam (2010)",
        "text": "The 2010 SummerSlam was the 23rd annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The event took place on August 15, 2010, at Staples Center in Los Angeles, California for the second consecutive year.\nSix matches were contested at the event. The main events of the evening included: Team WWE defeating The Nexus in a 7-on-7 elimination tag team match, Randy Orton defeating Sheamus via disqualification for the WWE Championship even though Sheamus retained the title, Melina winning the Divas Championship against Alicia Fox, Kane retaining the World Heavyweight Championship against Rey Mysterio. Other matches featured on the show were WWE Intercontinental Champion Dolph Ziggler versus Kofi Kingston, but ended in a no contest while Big Show defeated The Straight Edge Society (CM Punk, Joey Mercury and Luke Gallows) in a three-on-one handicap match.\nSummerSlam received 350,000 pay-per-view buys, a decrease on the 369,000 buys garnered by the 2009 event.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSummerSlam is an annual pay-per-view (PPV) produced every August by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, referred to as the \"Big Four\". It has since become considered WWE's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. The 2010 event was the 23rd SummerSlam and was scheduled to be held on August 15, 2010, at Staples Center in Los Angeles, California for the second consecutive year. It featured wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown brands.\nMuch like the previous year's SummerSlam, WWE promoted the event with its \"SummerSlam Axxess\" fan convention. The convention was held at the Nokia Plaza in L.A. Live from August 14 to 15. THQ revealed further details of the latest installment of their \"WWE SmackDown\" series, \"WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2011\".\nStorylines.\nThe professional wrestling matches at SummerSlam featured professional wrestlers performing as characters in scripted events pre-determined by the hosting promotion, World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). Storylines between the characters were produced on WWE's weekly television shows \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\" with the Raw and SmackDown brands—storyline divisions in which WWE assigned its employees to different programs.\nThe main rivalry heading into SummerSlam from the Raw brand was between the champion Sheamus and Randy Orton over the WWE Championship. On the July 19 episode of \"Raw\", Orton defeated Edge and Chris Jericho in a triple threat match to become the number one contender for Sheamus' WWE Championship at SummerSlam. On the August 9 episode of \"Raw\", the anonymous Raw general manager added two stipulations to the match, stating that anyone who interfered in this match would be suspended indefinitely and if Orton lost, he would not receive another match for the championship while Sheamus is champion.\nThe main rivalry heading into SummerSlam from the SmackDown brand was between the champion Kane and Rey Mysterio over the World Heavyweight Championship. On the May 28 episode of \"SmackDown\" Kane's storyline brother, The Undertaker defeated Mysterio to qualify for the fatal four-way match for the World Heavyweight Championship at the Fatal 4-Way pay-per view in June. During the match however, The Undertaker suffered a legitimate injury, forcing him to be written out of the match by having him found in a \"vegetative state\" by Kane over Memorial Day weekend. As a result, Kane accused several wrestlers of incapacitating his brother and attacked them. Mysterio won a battle royal to replace The Undertaker by last eliminating Kane, and went on to defeat the defending champion Jack Swagger, Big Show and CM Punk at Fatal 4-Way to win his second World Heavyweight Championship. At Money in the Bank, Kane won a Money in the Bank ladder match and cashed in his championship opportunity on Mysterio later that night, after Mysterio had defeated Swagger to retain. Kane defeated Mysterio to win his first World Heavyweight Championship. On the July 23 episode of \"SmackDown\", Mysterio defeated Swagger in a two-out-of-three falls match to earn a rematch against Kane for the World Heavyweight Championship at SummerSlam. On the July 30 episode of \"SmackDown\", Kane revealed that The Undertaker had disclosed that his attacker was Mysterio, and vowed to get revenge.\nAnother main rivalry from Raw featured The Nexus, a stable consisting of former \"NXT\" 'rookies' led by the season's winner Wade Barrett, against 'Team WWE', led by John Cena. The Nexus made their debut as a collective unit on the June 7 episode of \"Raw\", attacking Cena, CM Punk, and members of the ringside crew, on the pretext of demanding guaranteed WWE contracts for all of them. The following week on \"Raw\", the then-General Manager Bret Hart refused and as a result, The Nexus attacked and incapacitated him, forcing WWE Chairman Vince McMahon to appoint a new, anonymous General Manager, who ultimately signed all members of The Nexus to the show. The Nexus continued to frequently attack various WWE wrestlers, crew, and legends to display their dominance, although they focused mainly on Cena, costing him the WWE Championship twice at Fatal 4-Way and Money in the Bank. On the July 19 episode of \"Raw\", Cena confronted The Nexus, who offered him a place in their stable, which he refused and instead revealed that he had assembled a team, christened 'Team WWE' (consisting of Cena himself, Edge, Chris Jericho, John Morrison, R-Truth, The Great Khali, and Bret Hart), to face The Nexus in a seven-on-seven tag team match at SummerSlam. On the July 26 episode of \"Raw\", the anonymous general manager changed the match to an elimination format. Following dissension on Cena's team in the next few weeks, Edge and Jericho left the SummerSlam match on the August 2 episode of \"Raw\". They rejoined the following week, however, when The Nexus tried to attack the members of Team WWE and Edge and Jericho. On the same episode, Khali was attacked by The Nexus, removing him from the match at SummerSlam. The Miz offered his services to the team as Khali's substitute, ultimately saying that he would reveal his final decision at SummerSlam itself.\nAnother rivalry from the SmackDown brand pitted Big Show against The Straight Edge Society, a stable preaching the hardlined straight edge lifestyle, led by CM Punk and consisting of Luke Gallows, Joey Mercury and Serena. In May, at the Over the Limit pay-per-view, Punk lost a match to Rey Mysterio, forcing Punk to have his head shaved bald as a result of the stipulation. In order to conceal his baldness, Punk started wearing a mask until Big Show forcibly removed it on the July 16 episode of \"SmackDown\". In attempt to avenge Punk's humiliation, the Straight Edge Society's masked \"mystery man\" faced Big Show in a match, but had his own mask removed during the match, revealing him to be Joey Mercury. On the July 30 episode of \"SmackDown\", the Straight Edge Society attacked Big Show and repeatedly stomped his right hand into the steel ring steps. The following week, it was announced that the Straight Edge Society would be facing Big Show in a three-on-one handicap match at SummerSlam.\nAnother rivalry from the Raw brand was between the champion Alicia Fox and Melina over the WWE Divas Championship. In December 2009, Melina tore her ACL at a live event, which caused her to vacate the Divas Championship. At Fatal 4-Way in June, Fox won the title in a fatal four-way match against Maryse, Gail Kim and defending champion Eve, and retained the championship against Eve at Money in the Bank. On the August 2 episode of \"Raw\", Melina made her return and attacked Fox. The following week on \"Raw\", Melina defeated Fox in a non-title match and was rewarded with a title opportunity at the Divas Championship at SummerSlam.\nEvent.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe actual pay-per-view opened with Dolph Ziggler defending the WWE Intercontinental Championship against Kofi Kingston. The match ended in a no-contest after The Nexus attacked both competitors.\nNext, Alicia Fox defended the Divas Championship against Melina. Melina executed a snapmare driver on Fox to win the title. Post match, co-Women's Champions LayCool (Layla and Michelle McCool) attacked Melina.\nAfter that, The Straight Edge Society (CM Punk, Joey Mercury and Luke Gallows) faced Big Show in a handicap match. In the end, Big Show delivered a KO Punch to Gallows and delivered a chokeslam to Mercury onto Gallows, pinning Mercury to win the match.\nMain event matches.\nIn the fourth match, Sheamus faced Randy Orton for the WWE Championship in a last chance match, with the stipulations being that anyone who interfered in the match would be suspended indefinitely along with if Orton lost, he would never get another shot at the title as long as Sheamus is champion. In the climax, Sheamus performed a Brogue Kick on Orton for a near-fall. Sheamus retrieved a steel chair and fought with the referee over the chair, resulting in Orton winning by disqualification. After the match, Orton attacked Sheamus with a low-blow and performed an RKO on the broadcast table on Sheamus.\nIn the fifth match, Kane faced Rey Mysterio for the World Heavyweight Championship. The match ended when Kane performed a chokeslam on Mysterio to retain the title. After the match, Kane attempted to put Mysterio in a casket, but The Undertaker was revealed to be inside the casket. Kane delivered a Tombstone Piledriver to Undertaker.\nIn the main event, The Nexus faced Team WWE in a 7-on-7 elimination tag team match. Before the match started, Daniel Bryan was announced as the seventh member of Team WWE. In the climax of the match, after every other member of Team WWE had been eliminated, Barrett delivered a DDT to Cena onto the concrete floor and scored a near-fall. Cena eliminated Gabriel after Gabriel missed a 450º splash. Cena then eliminated Barrett with the STF, giving his team the win.\nReception.\nOverall, the event received mixed-to-negative reviews from critics, who praised the quality of the main event match (although panning the finish) while panning the remainder of the event.\nBleacher Report's Andre Harrison rated the event 5 out of 10, calling it a \"one match show\" (referring to the 7-on-7 tag team match as the only good match in the event), although stating that \"WWE dropped the ball huge\" on the finish. 411mania.com rated the event 2.75 out of 5.\nAftermath.\nThe next night on \"Raw\", the anonymous general manager of Raw announced that members of The Nexus would face off against members of Team WWE in a series of matches throughout the evening. In order to find the \"weak links\" of the group, The Nexus' leader, Wade Barrett, declared that anyone in The Nexus who lost their match would be excommunicated from the group. Ultimately, each Nexus member won their match except for Darren Young, who lost to John Cena by submission. After the match, the remaining six members brutally attacked Young, symbolizing his banishment from The Nexus.\nAccording to Chris Jericho and Edge, the original plan steered toward a victory for The Nexus. However, John Cena asked for the finish to be changed, which Jericho felt affected The Nexus' momentum. Nexus members Heath Slater and Darren Young have shared similar sentiments.\nIn April 2011, the promotion ceased using its full name with the \"WWE\" abbreviation becoming an orphaned initialism."

        "title": "Scoring systems for Sailing at the Summer Olympics",
        "text": "Over time, several scoring systems for Sailing were used during the Summer Olympics. Many of these systems were also used by other regattas in their times. In order to understand how the medals in the Olympics were handed out one must have a look at the scoring system of that specific olympic sailing regatta.\nFrom the start of sailing till the turn of the millennium one practiced the principle that the difference in points between No. 1 and 2 must be larger than between No. 2 and 3 and so on. Several systems in different variations were invented. For the last couple of Olympics this principle was no longer followed.\n1900 Olympic scoring system.\nIn 1900 for the different races different systems were used:\nOlympic races at Meulan.\nIn the following classes only one race was sailed for each gold medal.\nIn these races each boat was given, in advance, a handicap of several minutes and seconds. For each boat, the sailing time over the course was measured. This sailed time plus the handicap gave the corrected time. The boat with the lowest corrected time became winner.\nOlympic races at Le Havre.\nSince in the 10 – 20 Ton a series of three races was sailed, a scoring system beside the handicap system was used. Per race one could earn points as follows:\nA disqualification of penalty gives the points of the last place minus 1. Therefore, In the Olympics with six boats competing this gives 4 points.\n&lt;br&gt; All races counted and the scoring system was used after the corrected time was calculated.\nOpen class at Meulan.\nFor the Open class NO handicap or scoring system was used. The order in which the boats crossed the finishing line was the result of the regatta. This with the exception of the boats that were disqualified.\nIn case of a tie.\nThere are no known provisions for breaking a tie in the 1900 sailing regattas at the Olympic Games.\n1908 Olympic scoring system.\nThree races would be scheduled in each class.\nThe winner is the yacht with the most 1st places\nIn case of a tie.\nIn the event of three different yachts winning these Races, points will be allotted to them according to the following scale:\nThe tie is broken in favor of the yacht with the most points. Should two or more winners in any class tie under these conditions, they shall sail an extra match, on a day to be appointed, and the winner of this match shall be adjudged the absolute winner of the series. &lt;br&gt;\nAny tie for second place will be decided in the same manner.\n1912 Olympic scoring system.\nIn each class there will be 2 ordinary races, with the following method of scoring:\nIn case of a tie.\nShould two or more yachts in any class tie under these conditions for one of the first 3 places overall, the yachts involved shall sail an extra race. The winner breaks the tie in its favor.\n1920 Olympic scoring system.\nFor the Games in Belgium a so-called \"Point for Place\" system was used:\nIn case of a tie.\nShould two or more yachts in any class tie under these conditions a \"sail-off\" would determine the final result.\n1924 Olympic scoring system.\nFor the 1924 Games in France system of elimination series and semi finals was used.\nFrench National Monotype 1924.\nIn this class a total of 17 competitors participated. The France Olympic Committee had made available a total of 8 mostly identical boats. So here the fleet was divided in two flights of eight. In each elimination series one country was exempt and was automatically qualified for the semi-final. Per flight the best two boats earned a place in the semi-final. Finally a sail off was held for the places 2–4.\n6 &amp; 8 Metre.\nIn this class three elimination series were scheduled. The two best of each flight got a place in the semi-final. Eventually ties were broken by the result of the final race. The result of the other boats, up to place 6, was determined by the total result of the elimination series by the point for place system.\n1932 Olympic scoring system.\nThe winner in each class of the Yachting competition was decided on the following point system:\nIn case of a tie.\nIn case of a tie after all races were sailed, provision was made for an extra race between the competitors tied.\n1936 Olympic scoring system.\nEqual as 1932.\nIn case of a tie.\nIn case of a tie after all races were sailed, provision was made for an extra race between the competitors tied. This rule only applies as it concerns the places 1, 2 or 3.\n1940 Olympic scoring system.\nFor the 1940 Olympics the following scoring system was intended:\nIn case of a tie.\nIn case of a tie the helmsman with the most first places wins the serie. If this does not break the tie the helmsman with the most second places wins the serie and so on. If the tie is still not broken the series goes to the helmsmen with the best result in the last race.\n1948 Olympic scoring system.\nUntil the 1932 Olympics many scoring systems were used. Most of them put a lot of weight at winning of races. This changes in Los Angeles where a point for place system was used. Still the need for awarding the winning of races remained.\nIn Austria a point system was developed were the delta between two sequential places was decreased with the rank. In other words: a lot of points between 1 and 2 and less difference between 24 and 25. The system was based upon a formula taking the number of entries and the rank of into account. Not finishing, retiring after the finish, disqualification or not starting gave 0 points. The formula looked like this:\nN = Rank and A = Number of entries.\nThis formula is in the table below exercised for 1 to 25 entries.\nThis system was used for the 1948 Olympics. Seven races were scheduled, of the seven races, a yacht counted only the points for her best six races.\nIn case of a tie.\nTies were broken as follows:\n1952 Olympic scoring system.\nThe Austrian scoring system of 1948 was used. Below you find the relevant tables:\n1956 Olympic scoring system.\nThe Austrian scoring system of 1948 was used. Below you find the relevant tables:\n1960 Olympic scoring system.\nThe Austrian scoring system of 1948 was used. With the exception that a yacht that did not finish now gets 101 points. Below you find the relevant tables:\n1964 Olympic scoring system.\nThe Austrian scoring system of 1964 was used. Below you find the relevant tables:\n1968 Olympic scoring system.\nFor each class a series should consist of seven scheduled races. For each yacht the best six races will count. If only six races are sailed the best five race will count. If only five races are sailed all five will count.\nIn case of a tie.\nIn case of a tie the yacht with the most first places, over the 6 counting races for each yacht, wins the series. If this does not break the tie the helmsman with the most second places wins the series and so on. If the tie is still not broken then the tie remains.\n1972 Olympic scoring system.\nThe 1968 Olympic scoring system was used. With the exception that DSQ scored now: Place = No. of entered boats + 1\n1984 Olympic scoring system.\nThe 1968 Olympic scoring system was used. With the exception that DSQ scored now: Place = No. of entered boats + 1\nAlso:\nRET = Place = No. of entered boats + 1\nYMP = Points by decision of the jury (most used = average score)"

        "text": "Olivos Rugby Club is an Argentine rugby union and field hockey club located in the Munro district of Vicente López Partido. The rugby team is member of the Unión de Rugby de Buenos Aires (URBA), having won its only URBA championship in 1940. Olivos currently competes in Primera División A, the second division of the URBA league system. Olivos is regarded as one of the most representative clubs of rugby union in Buenos Aires Province.\nOlivos' hockey teams are affiliated to Buenos Aires Hockey Association (AHBA), competing in championships organised by the body.\nHistory.\nThe sporting institution was founded on September 4, 1927 as a rugby club by 20 young men joined at a land located on Avenida del Libertador 2200 in the neighborhood of Olivos, Buenos Aires. They took inspiration from the British side that toured on Argentina in 1927 to create their own club. Salvador Pineda, Julio J. Salas, José Mosé, Leopoldo Houssay, and Emilio Izasmendi (son) were the founding members.\nAs the club still had not an own field, they first played at Banco Hipotecario's field in San Fernando Partido. Olivos played their first official match v Club Atlético del Rosario at Plaza Jewell in 1932. The first colors used were light blue and yellow, then adopting the green. The definitive orange and black colors came later, taken from some pillows in Carlos Bowers' house. Bowers was also president of the club in the 1930s. During his tenure, he insisted on forming teams with players from the neighborhood, with no external players added.\nIn 1933, Olivos promoted to Primera División (current Torneo de la URBA) for the first time after defeating Obras Sanitarias 17–3. Years later the club inaugurated its own field (1935), located in Munro, Buenos Aires, near the current facilities, and then opened a female field hockey section. In 1936, Olivos was one of the clubs that played Great Britain during the \"Lions\" third tour on Argentina.\nOlivos finally set its headquarters on Mariano Pelliza street in Munro in 1940. The club has remained there since then. That same year the club won their only URBA title to date. In 1942, the field hockey team promoted to Primera División. In 1959, Olivos played the Junior Springboks when the South African side toured Argentina. \nAfter some years in the second division, in 1984 Olivos returned to Primera División after winning the championship unbeaten. The team earned 14 points above the team placed second, having scored 80 tries. Since then, the club has been a constant feature in the league, fielding teams at all levels."

        "text": "The UEFA Champions League, known until 1992 as the European Champion Clubs' Cup or colloquially as the European Cup, is an annual association football cup competition organised by UEFA since 1955. Originally a straight knockout competition open only to champion clubs, the tournament was expanded during the 1990s to incorporate a round-robin group phase and more teams. The expansion resulted in more games being played, increasing players' goalscoring chances; thus the rankings are weighted in favour of modern players: only seven out of the 52 players on the list never competed in the reformed Champions League.\nWith 140 goals, Cristiano Ronaldo is currently the all-time top scorer in the Champions League, while his career rival Lionel Messi is the only other player to have reached triple figures. Ronaldo has also finished as the top scorer for the most individual seasons in the competition's history, doing so seven times.\nThe title of highest goalscorer had previously been held by Raúl, who scored his 50th goal in 2005 while at Real Madrid to overtake Alfredo Di Stéfano. He held the record until November 2014, when his eventual tally of 71 was first equalled and then surpassed by Messi. Ronaldo has remained the competition's outright top scorer since September 2015; after a back-and-forth exchange of the record between him and Messi, a hat-trick by the former against Shakhtar Donetsk put Ronaldo ahead with 80 goals, and he would not relinquish the top spot again after this. Including qualifying rounds, Cristiano Ronaldo has scored 141 Champions League goals.\nAll-time top scorers.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nTop scorers by season.\nThe table below does not include goals scored in the qualification stage of the competition."

        "text": "The Tulane Green Wave men's basketball team represents Tulane University in NCAA Division I college basketball. The team competes in the American Athletic Conference. They play home games on campus in Devlin Fieldhouse, the 9th-oldest active basketball venue in the nation. The team's last appearance in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament was in 1995.\nTulane is the only school from the original Metro Conference that remained in the conference through its 1975 founding, the 1991 breakup that saw several schools form the Great Midwest Conference, the 1995 reunification that created today's Conference USA, and the 2004 realignment of conferences. It rejoined many of its previous conference mates when it became a member of the American Athletic Conference in 2014.\nHistory.\nTulane's men's basketball team played its first game on December 9, 1905.\nIn March 1976, the Green Wave enticed Syracuse coach Roy Danforth--one year removed from taking the Orange to their first Final Four--to succeed Charles Moir as Green Wave coach when Moir left for the same position at Virginia Tech. \nDanforth's successor at Syracuse, Jim Boeheim, coached the Orange for the next 47 seasons, winning 1,116 games and the 2003 national championship. Meanwhile, Danforth was fired by Tulane after the 1980-81 season, which included a 119-81 loss to in-state rival LSU. \nThe program fell victim to one of the biggest scandals of the 1980s in college sports when four players, including star forward \"Hot Rod\" Williams, were accused of taking money and cocaine to alter the final point spreads of games they played in. Clyde Eads and Jon Johnson were granted immunity to testify against Williams, the alleged ringleader. Although he was indicted, the judge eventually declared a mistrial, and no sentence was handed down. Williams spent the next nine years with the NBA's Cleveland Cavaliers. Within days of Williams' indictment, head coach Ned Fowler and his assistant coaches, and athletic director Hindman Wall all resigned. \nOn April 4, 1985, president Eamon Kelly disbanded the basketball program. He did not intend ever to allow its return; he relented in 1988 after several students convinced him that they were being punished for something that occurred when they were not at Tulane.\nNew head coach Perry Clark rebuilt the program to unprecedented success, including a 1991–92 season that started 13–0 and ended in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. The 1992–93 and 1994–95 teams matched that team's success, but Tulane has not approached such heights since. Clark resigned in 2000 to coach the Miami Hurricanes. The Green Wave failed to make any postseason tournament under Clark's successor, Shawn Finney, or under former Maryland assistant Dave Dickerson.\nEd Conroy was hired as the new head coach in 2010. His teams have seen initial success against out-of-conference foes in each of its seasons but have done poorly in conference games. The 2010–11 team finished 13–17 after a 12–3 start, while his 2011–12 team finished 15–16 after starting 14–6.\nOn March 14, 2016, Tulane fired Conroy after six years as head coach. He was replaced by former longtime NBA player and coach Mike Dunleavy Sr. On March 16, 2019, after a 4–27 season, the Tulane athletic department fired Dunleavy. As of 2023, the head coach is Ron Hunter. \nPopular culture.\nIn the 1992 sports comedy film \"White Men Can't Jump\", character Billy Hoyle mentions he is a former Green Wave player.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Green Wave have appeared in three NCAA Tournaments.

        "title": "St. Bonaventure Bonnies men's basketball",
        "text": "The St. Bonaventure Bonnies men's basketball (formerly the St. Bonaventure Brown Indians) team is the college basketball team that represents St. Bonaventure University, located near the city of Olean, New York. The school's team currently competes in the Atlantic 10 Conference and plays its home games at the Reilly Center. The Bonnies are currently coached by all-time coaching wins leader Mark Schmidt, who during his 12th season surpassed former coach Larry Weise with his 203rd victory.\nHistory.\nBeginnings.\nOf the major sports at St. Bonaventure, basketball was the last introduced. In 1902, the first team had been put together, mainly consisting of former football players. The coach of this team was university professor Patric Driscoll. Official records of these games were not kept. Proper facilities were not available until four years later when intramural games began to be played in a handball court on campus.\nIn 1916, Butler Gym was constructed, but wasn't finished by the time the intercollegiate team played its first game against University at Buffalo. This game was played in the Olean Armory. Games were cancelled until after World War I had ended. The first game played in Butler Gym was during the 1919-1920 season with Richard Phelan as the coach. Basketball prospered on campus in the decades between World War I and World War II. From 1942 to 1944, basketball was again put on hold for a world war. Following World War II, Anslem Kreiger, a former All-American Basketball player, took over the program, with a record of 15-10 over his two-year tenure. The Brown Indians returned to the Olean Armory after the war and remained there for the next 20 seasons. The team was noted for having won 99 consecutive home games at the Armory before that streak was broken in February 1961.\nEd (Melvin) Milkovich took over the basketball team for a six-year period starting with the 1948–49 season, after Kreiger was promoted to athletic director. This was a period of great success for the program, with two appearances in the National Invitational Tournament (NIT), the first during the 1950–51 season when the team was eliminated in the second round. Further success came with the team's appearance in the 1952 NIT, where they made it to the semifinals. Over his tenure, Milkovich led the team to a record of 98–47.\nEdward Donovan took over head coaching duties for the 1953–54 season, holding the position for an eight-year period. The team again made an appearance in the NIT in 1957, again making it to the semifinals\nGolden era.\nUnder Donovan, the team made it to the NIT every year from 1957 to 1960. In 1961, the team made its first trip to the NCAA tournament and finished third in its regional. However, this was Donovan's final season coaching the Brown Indians; in May 1961 he took a job as a coach of the New York Knicks.\nFormer Brown Indian Larry Weise took over the team starting with the 1961–62 season. In 1964, Weise led the team to the NCIT Tournament and the NIT. Under Weise's tutelage, the team returned to the NCAA tournament in 1968, proceeding to the second round prior to being eliminated. In 1970, St. Bonaventure, led by future NBA-great Bob Lanier, was thought to have a legitimate shot at unseating UCLA for the national title. However, they lost Lanier late in their East regional final victory over Villanova to a torn ligament, causing the All-American to miss the Final Four. St. Bonaventure was upset by Jacksonville in the national semifinals, before losing to New Mexico State in the national consolation game. In each Final Four game, the Lanier-less Bonnies were dominated by the opponent's pivot, Artis Gilmore for Jacksonville and Sam Lacey for New Mexico State. \nWeise led the team to another trip to the NIT in 1971. In 1973, he relinquished his post as coach. He was replaced by Jim Satalin, another former Brown Indian. He led the team to a championship in the NIT in 1977. The next year, the team again made it to the NCAA tournament and was defeated in the first round. In 1979, St. Bonaventure joined the Atlantic 10 Conference and the Bonnies made another appearance at the NIT and again were defeated in the first round.\nRebounding.\nIn the 1999–2000 season, the Bonnies finished in second place in A-10 play under coach Jim Baron and lost to #6 ranked Temple in the A-10 tournament championship. The Bonnies received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament, their first bid since 1978. However, they failed to advance, losing to #19 ranked Kentucky in double overtime in the first round. Following the season Baron moved on to coach fellow A-10 school, Rhode Island.\n2003 scandal.\nJan van Breda Kolff was hired to continue the rebuilding Baron had achieved. However, he, instead, did the opposite. The 2002–03 men's basketball season was marred by a scandal after a transfer student from a junior college, Jamil Terrell, was permitted to play even though he had not completed his associate degree and was therefore ineligible for one year. The team was forced to forfeit every game in which he played and was barred from the A-10 Tournament. In protest, players voted to sit out the last two games of the regular season. Head coach Jan van Breda Kolff, athletic director Gothard Lane, and school president Dr. Robert Wickenheiser were all ousted. St. Bonaventure's chairman of the board of trustees, William Swan, took his own life in August 2003, feeling that he had let down his alma mater by failing to prevent the scandal.\nSt. Bonaventure docked itself three scholarships from 2003 to 2005 and the NCAA subsequently put the team on three years' probation and banned them from postseason play in 2003–04. Subsequently, the Bonnies failed to achieve a winning record until the 2010–11 season under coach Mark Schmidt.\nRenewed success.\nIn the 2011–12 season, the team enjoyed more success than in any season since the 2003 scandal. Led by conference Player of the Year Andrew Nicholson — the 19th pick by Orlando in the 2012 NBA draft — they accumulated a 20–12 record during the regular season. They then won the school's first-ever Atlantic 10 tournament title, beating Saint Joseph's, UMass, and Xavier. The conference title earned them an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament, where they lost 66–63 to ACC champion Florida State in the second round at Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tennessee.\nAfter Nicholson departed for the NBA, the 2012–13 team failed to qualify for the 2013 A-10 tournament in Brooklyn. However, the 2013–14 Bonnies qualified for the A-10 tournament, advancing to the semifinals. They upset the #1 seed Saint Louis on a buzzer-beater shot by Jordan Gathers, the nephew of the late Hank Gathers. That play made the SportsCenter Top 10 plays of the Night. In the 2014–15 campaign, the Bonnies had a winning record and advanced to the quarterfinals of the A-10 Conference tournament. On February 7, 2015, Bonnies guard Marcus Posley hit a buzzer beater shot to upset the nationally ranked VCU Rams and Shaka Smart at the nearly sold-out Reilly Center. The students, and many fans, rushed the court to celebrate after Posley's shot went in.\nThe 2015–16 Bonnies finished in a three-way tie for first place in the A-10 regular season. The Bonnies were upset in their first game of the A-10 tournament, losing in overtime to Davidson. The Bonnies failed to receive a bid to the NCAA tournament and were considered one of the \"first four out\" by the selection committee, their poor non-conference strength of schedule and lack of non-conference quality wins being listed as the reasons they were not selected for a bid. Their omission was widely considered to be one of the largest snubs of the year, if not all time, being the first team to ever to have an RPI ranking in the top 30 and a conference regular season title to their name, and not receive a bid. It came as such a surprise to so many in the college basketball world, that it prompted the Atlantic 10 athletic director to issue a public statement voicing her dissatisfaction with the committee's decision to exclude the Bonnies. The following year, St. Bonaventure alum Brian Toolan wrote a short book about the Bonnies' 2015-2016 season, entitled \"Snubbed\".\nThe 2017-18 Bonnies tied the school's season record at 25 wins, a record previously set by the 1969-1970 Final Four team. The 25-win season resulted in an at-large bid in the NCAA tournament as an 11-seed, where the Bonnies went on to beat the UCLA Bruins 65-58 for their first NCAA tournament win since 1970. The 2017-2018 season marked the Bonnies' seventh NCAA tournament appearance in program history and the second under head coach Mark Schmidt. The Bonnies later lost to the Florida Gators 62-77 in the 1st round of the NCAA tournament.\nOn February 27, 2021 the Bonnies clinched the first ever outright Atlantic 10 regular season title in program history when Davidson defeated VCU 65-57. The successful season continued two weeks later when, on March 14, 2021, the Bonnies won their first A-10 tournament title since 2012, beating VCU 74-65. With this win the Bonnies secured an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament, their second in 4 years.\nThe 2021–22 Bonnies opened the new campaign ranked in the AP Poll for the first time in a half century. Following a win in the Charleston Classic (in which the Bonnies defeated Boise State, Clemson and Marquette) the Bonnies reached as high as 16th in the national poll. The Bonnies went unranked the rest of the season following a loss to Northern Iowa in their first game after the Charleston Classic win. Following an ankle injury to their star Point Guard Kyle Lofton, the Bonnies fell to AP ranked UCONN and were blown out against Virginia Tech in Lofton's return to play. Following that loss to VA Tech. the Bonnies went on a one-month COVID pause due to positive cases within their program and their opponents. The A-10 preseason favorite Bonnies finished the regular season as the 4th seed for the A-10 tournament, losing to 5th seeded Saint Louis in the quarterfinals after Lofton missed 2 free throws trailing by 1 point with under 2 seconds remaining.\nThe Bonnies returned to National Invitational Tournament (NIT) after missing out on an NCAA tournament berth. They defeated Colorado, Oklahoma and Virginia en route to an appearance at Madison Square Garden for the NIT semifinals versus Xavier. The Bonnies fell in that game to finish their season. Following the loss, the \"ironman 5 2.0\" as they were called composed of Kyle Lofton, Dominick Welch, Jaren Holmes, Jalen Adaway and Osun Osunniyi all opted to take their talents elsewhere. Adaway entered the NBA draft, Lofton transferred to Florida, Holmes and Osunniyi transferred to Iowa State, and Welch transferred to Alabama.\nPostseason.\nNCAA Division I Tournament results.\nThe Bonnies have appeared in eight NCAA Tournaments.

The Bonnies also hold a record of 9–9 against ranked teams at the Reilly Center since 1993.\nBroadcasting.\nFM 95.7 in Olean signed on in 1949 and carried the St. Bonaventure men's basketball team from its sign-on through the next 74 seasons. In July 2023, the university announced that it was unable to come to an agreement with the station's current owners to continue broadcasting the games. Beginning with the 2023–24 season, the Bonnies will broadcast their home games exclusively online. The university retained Gary Nease, their play-by-play broadcaster since 1995, to helm the play-by-play broadcast. Chris Russell, former station manager at FM 105.9 in Little Valley (where he formerly broadcast the women's basketball team), will serve as producer of the broadcasts. Nease explained that \"I was getting it from both my company and Bonaventure that they weren't happy with some of the things that were going on (...) Bonaventure was doing a good job recruiting corporate sponsors. I think our station and Bonaventure were competing directly against each other for the advertising dollars that we needed to cover our costs and turn a profit.\""

        "title": "Basketball (1980 video game)",
        "text": "Basketball (released as NBA Basketball) is a multiplayer sports video game produced by Mattel and released for its Intellivision video game system in 1980. The players each control a basketball team competing in four timed quarters of game play. Mattel obtained a license from National Basketball Association and used the NBA logo in its box art, making it first basketball video game to be licensed by the NBA. \"NBA Basketball\" does not use any official team or player names. It was sold by Sears for its private-label version of the Intellivision console, the \"Super Video Arcade\", without the NBA name or logo.\nGameplay.\nEach player controls a three-man basketball team, actively controlling one team member at a time, with the computer controlling the other two. Like the real game of basketball, the player's team must score more points than the opponent's team by shooting more baskets and blocking opponent's shots on their basket. The game consists of four quarters, each a simulated twelve minutes in length. The pace of the game is governed by a simulated 24-second shot clock.\nAt the start of the quarter, the two players control the centers during the tip-off. The team who wins the tip-off begins on offense, with the player controlling the team member with the ball. Players on offense use the keypad to select where in the offensive half of the court they wish to pass the ball. If a computer-controlled offensive team member receives the pass, control passes to that team member. When attempting to shoot the ball at the basket, players may choose between a jump shot (which is less likely to be blocked, but only hits at close range) and a set shot (which can hit from long distances, but has a greater chance of being blocked).\nOn defense, the player controls one member of the team, considered the \"captain\". The defense can block shots, intercept passes and rebound missed shots, and computer-controlled defensive team members are able to steal the ball from the offense. When a defensive team member (either player- or computer-controlled) gets the ball, the player controls that team member and switches to the offensive controls.\nIf the score is tied at the end of the fourth quarter of play, a single five-minute overtime period is played.\nVariations from standard basketball.\nGameplay is on a simulated regulation-style full court, whereas traditional three-on-three basketball games typically use only a half-court setup. There are no foul shots in the game, nor are there three-point shots; all baskets, regardless of distance, are worth two points. Also, the shot clock resets not only after attempted shots and possession changes, but also upon completed passes. Theoretically, an offensive team can pass the ball continually and take only a single shot within a given quarter.\nReception.\n\"Basketball\" was reviewed by \"Video\" magazine in its \"Arcade Alley\" column where it was praised for its \"superb\" passing system. Although the reviewers noted that the game lacked free throws and free agents, their general conclusion was that the game \"[would] have fans cheering\".\nLegacy.\nThe game is included in the \"Intellivision Lives!\" compilation, as well as Microsoft's Game Room service, as simply \"Basketball\"."

The song also appears on the official FIFA World Cup album \"Gloryland World Cup USA 94\" under the title \"Soccer Rocks the Globe\".\nDaryl Hall and Sounds of Blackness also sang it at the opening ceremonies of the FIFA World Cup with lyrics. It was also used as the theme to ITV's coverage of the tournament.\nCritical reception.\nLarry Flick from \"Billboard\" wrote, \"Patterned after \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\", single from the just-issued \"Soccer Rocks the World\" is awash in dewy-eyed sincerity. With Hall trading off lead lines with various members of S.O.B., this sweet and slow pop/R&amp;B track builds to a blasting, gospel-like climax. Expect this one to connect with the same folks who tear up during Whitney Houston's \"One Moment in Time\".\" Dele Fadele from \"NME\" said, \"'Gloryland' is sentimental, self-regarding and overblown \"in excelsis\" — true adult-orientated mush.\""

        "title": "Pittsburgh Panthers baseball",
        "text": "The Pittsburgh Panthers baseball is the NCAA Division I intercollegiate baseball program of the University of Pittsburgh, often referred to as \"Pitt\", located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Pitt baseball team competes in the Atlantic Coast Conference and plays their home games at Charles L. Cost Field in the Petersen Sports Complex. It is the university's oldest recorded sport, dating to 1869. Prior to joining the ACC in 2013-14, Pitt had won both the Big East Conference regular season and Big East Tournament championships. The Panthers have also received four First Team All-American selections, and have appeared in three NCAA championships. 52 Panthers have been selected in the Major League Baseball Draft.\nHistory.\nBaseball has been called \"the first game of consequence played at the University.\" The first recorded game was a 21–20, five-inning win over the Eckfords of East Liberty in 1869. The team went undefeated until it lost to a high school team in 1870. Although early records are sparse and incomplete, baseball at the university continued to be played against nearby college teams, although sometimes with irregular schedules, throughout the end of the 19th century, as well as at the intramural level. The student yearbook, \"The Owl\", noted that teams fielded between the years of 1888 to 1894 were especially successful. However, according to the student yearbook, in the early 20th century interest in college baseball at Pitt waned due to a lack of a proper field, strictness of eligibility rules, irregularity of schedules, and the rise of football as the dominant school sport. Pitt did not field a baseball team from 1918 to 1920, although the program was briefly resurrected under coach Dick Harley for four seasons which were highlighted by the play of future Major League Baseball pitcher Steve Swetonic, before the program again disappeared from 1925 to 1938. The program was reestablished in 1939 under coach Ralph Mitterling who led the team for 16 seasons and guided players such as future Major League pitcher Russ Kemmerer.\nIn 1955, legendary Pitt baseball coach Bobby Lewis took control of the program. Lewis, who is one of two Panthers to have his baseball jersey retired by the school, led the team for 36 seasons until his retirement in 1990. During his tenure, Pitt went 438–389, garnering Lewis the most wins of any coach in Pitt athletics history to that point. Under Lewis, Pitt appeared in the NCAA baseball championship twice, and finished ranked 27th in the final 1967 \"Collegiate Baseball Newspaper\" poll. Lewis coached All-Americans George Schoeppner and Fred Mazurek, future long-time Major League professionals Doc Medich and Ken Macha, as well as other notable athletes such as Mike Ditka and Joe Walton.\nMark Jackson took over for Bobby Lewis in 1991 and quickly turned the Panthers into a contender in the Big East Conference, in which Pitt had begun competing in 1985. Jackson led the Panthers to a regular season Big East title in 1994, earning Big East Coach of the Year honors, and went on to win the 1995 Big East Conference baseball tournament, thus earning a bid to the NCAA Championship and finishing the season ranked 28th in the final \"Collegiate Baseball Newspaper\" poll. His teams posted five winning seasons out of seven years at the helm, including three 30 or more-win seasons. Notable players for Jackson include Jason Conti, who went on to play for five seasons in the Major Leagues, and Josh Tyler who won the 1994 Big East Player of the Year award.\nOne of the most successful eras of Pitt baseball began with the hiring of Joe Jordano as coach on November 15, 1997. Since coming to Pittsburgh, Jordano has had 38 players taken in the Major League Baseball Draft, 50 of his players sign professional contracts, and 36 All-Big East players. Since 2000, Jordano's teams have produced nine All-Americans, 20 All-region selections, six 30-win seasons, and six Big East Baseball Tournament appearances. Jordano earned the Big East Coach of the Year award in 2004 following a 38–18 season in which Pitt finished second in the conference standings. In 2010, Pitt went 38–18 and appeared in the Top 25 polls of both \"Collegiate Baseball Newspaper\" and \"Baseball America\" for the first time in its history, earning Jordano the American Baseball Coaches Association (ABCA) East Region Coach of the Year award and the Chuck Tanner Collegiate Baseball Manager of the Year Award. On March 2, 2012, Jordano surpassed former head coach Bobby Lewis to become Pitt baseball's all-time wins leader when he earned his 403rd career victory, a 3–1 win at Coastal Carolina.\nIn 2011, the program moved into a new facility, Charles L. Cost Field, in the Petersen Sports Complex, from its old facility, Trees Field. The new facilities helped to prompt Rivals.com to name Pitt as one of \"college baseball's rising programs\" heading into the 2011 season. Pitcher Corey Baker, who in 2010 had been named to the All-Big East First Team, and to the ABCA/Rawlings All-East Region First Team, ended his university career in 2011 as the Pittsburgh Panthers all-time career wins leader, with 24.\nIn the 2013 season, Pitt's last in the Big East Conference, the team set a record for the most wins in a single season (42) and became nationally ranked in the Top 25 of all five major college baseball polls for the first time in program history, including climbing as high as #16 in \"Collegiate Baseball Newspaper\". Pitt moved into the Atlantic Coast Conference on July 1, 2013.\nJordano resigned as the head coach of Pittsburgh on June 22, 2018. Mike Bell, former associate head coach at Florida State, was hired as Pitt's head coach in July 2018.\nAll-Americans.\nPitt has had ten different players selected as All-Americans, including four first team selections. In addition, two Panthers have been selected as Freshman All-Americans, and five players have been selected as an Academic All-Americans.\nAll-East.\nPitt has had 34 All-East selections over its history, and one coach, Joe Jordano, was named the ABCA East Region Coach of the Year in 2010.\nBig East honors.\nPitt has receive 69 All-Big East selections along with conference player, pitcher, rookie, and coach of the year awards. In addition, 36 Pitt players have garnered All-Big East Academic Awards and the team earned the Most Improved Team GPA award in 2008.\nMajor League Baseball.\nPitt has had 60 Major League Baseball Draft selections since the draft began in 1965. Since 1940, 99 total players that have been drafted or signed to professional contracts, including 60 since 2000.\nOther Pitt players that had Major League careers include Steve Swetonic, Robert Malloy, Russ Kemmerer, and Jason Rakers."

        "title": "Scotland at the FIFA World Cup",
        "text": "The Scotland national football team has appeared eight times at the FIFA World Cup, including five consecutive tournaments from 1974 to 1990. The team has never advanced beyond the first round of the finals competition. They have missed out on progressing to the second round three times on goal difference: in 1974, when Brazil edged them out; in 1978, when the Netherlands progressed; and in 1982, when the Soviets qualified.\nBackground.\nThe Scottish Football Association (SFA) is the second oldest in the world; it was founded in 1873, the year after the first official international match was played between Scotland and England at Hamilton Crescent, Glasgow.\nThe FIFA World Cup is an international association football competition contested by the men's national teams of the members of the \"Fédération Internationale de Football Association\" (FIFA), the sport's global governing body. The competition has been held every four years since the first tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946, due to World War II.\nThe World Cup consists of two parts, the qualification phase and the final phase (officially called the \"World Cup Finals\"). The qualification phase, which currently take place over the three years preceding the Finals, is used to determine which teams qualify for the Finals. The current format of the Finals involves 32 teams competing at venues within the host nation (or nations) over a period of about a month. The World Cup Finals is the most widely viewed sporting event in the world, with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the 2006 tournament final.\nHistory.\n1930s.\nScotland did not compete in the first three World Cup competitions, in 1930, 1934 and 1938. Because of a dispute with FIFA over \"broken-time\" payments to players, the SFA, with the football associations of England, Ireland and Wales, withdrew from FIFA in 1928, and did not rejoin as a permanent member until 1946.\n1950s.\nThe readmission of the Scottish Football Association to FIFA in 1946 meant that Scotland were now eligible to enter the 1950 FIFA World Cup. FIFA advised that places would be awarded to the top two teams in the 1949–50 British Home Championship, but the SFA announced that Scotland would attend the finals only if Scotland won the competition. Scotland won their first two matches, but a 1–0 home defeat by England meant that the Scots finished as runners-up. The SFA stood by this proclamation, despite pleas to the contrary by the Scotland players, supported by England captain Billy Wright and the other England players. Sportswriter Brian Glanville later described the SFA as showing \"baffling insularity and pique\" in their refusal to send a team to the World Cup.\nThe same qualification rules as in 1950 were in place for the 1954 FIFA World Cup, with the 1953–54 British Home Championship acting as a qualifying group. Scotland again finished second, but this time the SFA allowed a team to participate in the Finals, held in Switzerland. To quote the SFA website, \"The preparation was atrocious\". The SFA only sent 13 players to the finals, even though FIFA allowed 22-man squads at the tournament. Despite this self-imposed hardship in terms of players, the SFA dignitaries travelled in numbers, accompanied with their wives. Scotland lost 1–0 against Austria in their first game in the finals. After falling out with the SFA, probably due to the poor preparation of the team, manager Andy Beattie resigned hours before the game against Uruguay. Uruguay were reigning champions and had never before lost a game at the World Cup finals. The gulf in class was exposed in horrific fashion as Uruguay won 7–0.\nScotland qualified for the 1958 FIFA World Cup, finishing ahead of Spain. Manchester United manager Matt Busby had been due to manage the Scotland team at the World Cup, but the severe injuries he suffered in the Munich air disaster in February meant that trainer Dawson Walker took charge of the team instead. In their first match at the finals Scotland achieved a creditable draw against Yugoslavia. Players Archie Robertson and Tommy Docherty were sent to watch next opponents Paraguay and they reported back that Paraguay was a \"rough, fit and good\" team. Walker chose to ignore this advice and left out some of his combative players, including Docherty, and Scotland lost 3–2. They exited the competition after also losing to France.\n1960s.\nScotland failed to qualify for another World Cup in the next 16 years. In the 1962 competition, a \"skilful but fragile\" team finished joint-top of UEFA qualification group 8 with Czechoslovakia. This meant that the teams had to play-off in a neutral venue for the qualification place, which the Czechs won 4–2 after extra time.\nJock Stein was appointed manager on a part-time basis ahead of 1966 FIFA World Cup qualification. Scotland were drawn with Italy, Poland and Finland in UEFA qualification group 8. Scotland got off to a good start with two wins against Finland and a draw in Poland, but then conceded two late goals to lose 2–1 to Poland at home. A 1–0 home win against Italy kept hopes alive going into the final game, where Scotland either needed to win in Italy to qualify or draw to force another play-off. Several first choice players withdrew due to injury; Scotland lost 3–0 and failed to qualify. Stein relinquished the Scotland job after this defeat to concentrate on his full-time role with Celtic.\n1970s.\nNow managed by Bobby Brown, Scotland were drawn with West Germany, Austria and Cyprus in their 1970 qualification group. Scotland started well, beating Austria at home and scoring 13 goals in the two matches against Cyprus. A draw at home with West Germany meant that Scotland needed to avoid defeat in the return game to retain any hope of qualification. Scotland scored first in Hamburg, and then equalised midway through the second half, but succumbed to a 3–2 defeat. \nWillie Ormond was appointed Scotland manager in 1973. Ormond lost his first match in charge 5–0 to England, but recovered to steer Scotland to the 1974 World Cup finals in West Germany. Scotland then achieved their most impressive performance at a World Cup tournament, as the team was unbeaten but failed to progress beyond the group stages on goal difference. After beating Zaire, they drew with both Brazil and Yugoslavia, and went out because they had beaten Zaire by the smallest margin. This performance has been assessed as a \"gallant failure\", but the choice to retain possession instead of pressing for more goals against Zaire has been criticised. \nScotland appointed Ally MacLeod as manager in 1977. Scotland qualified for the 1978 FIFA World Cup with victories over Czechoslovakia and Wales. During the build-up to the tournament, MacLeod fuelled the hopes of the nation by stating that Scotland would come home from Argentina with a medal. As the squad left for the finals, they were given an enthusiastic send off as they were paraded around a packed Hampden Park. Thousands more fans lined the route to Prestwick Airport as the team set off for South America. This enthusiasm was not just generated internally, as respected coaches such as Rinus Michels and Miljan Miljanić rated Scotland amongst the favourites to win the competition. The Royal Mail commissioned designs of commemorative stamps that would have been circulated if Scotland had won the World Cup.\nScotland's first game was against Peru in Córdoba. Two spectacular goals by Teófilo Cubillas meant that the result was a 3–1 loss. The second game was a very disappointing 1–1 draw against Iran. Scotland had not even scouted Iran. The disconsolate mood of the nation was reflected by footage of Ally MacLeod in the dugout with his head in his hands. MacLeod had made strange selection choices, picking inexperienced full-backs and retaining the out-of-form Bruce Rioch and Don Masson.\nAfter taking a single point from their opening two games, Scotland had to defeat the Netherlands by three clear goals to progress. Despite the Dutch taking the lead, Scotland fought back to win 3–2 with a goal from Kenny Dalglish and two from Archie Gemmill, the second of which is considered one of the greatest World Cup goals ever; Gemmill beat three Dutch defenders before lifting the ball over goalkeeper Jan Jongbloed into the net. The victory was not sufficient to secure a place in the second round, however, as Scotland were eliminated on goal difference for the second successive World Cup. This performance against strong opponents only heightened the frustration at the poor results earlier in the competition. MacLeod initially retained his position, but resigned later that year.\n1980s.\nJock Stein, who had won nine consecutive Scottish league titles and the European Cup as manager of Celtic, was appointed Scotland manager in 1978. After failing to qualify for the 1980 European Championship, Scotland qualified for the 1982 FIFA World Cup from a tough group including Sweden, Portugal, Israel and Northern Ireland, losing just one match in the process. They were then drawn in a \"Group of death\" with New Zealand, Brazil and the Soviet Union. Scotland beat New Zealand by 5–2 in their first game, but then lost 4–1 to a Brazil team containing Socrates, Zico, Eder and Falcão. Scotland were again eliminated on goal difference, after a 2–2 draw with the Soviet Union. This match is best remembered for defenders Alan Hansen and Willie Miller colliding while chasing a long ball, which allowed the Soviets to run through and score.\nScotland qualified for the 1986 FIFA World Cup, their fourth in succession, in traumatic circumstances. The squad went into their last qualification match against Wales needing a point to progress to a qualifying playoff against Australia. With only nine minutes remaining and Wales leading 1–0, Scotland were awarded a penalty kick, which was calmly scored by Davie Cooper. The 1–1 draw meant that Scotland progressed, but as the players and fans celebrated, national coach Jock Stein suffered a heart attack and died shortly afterwards. His assistant Alex Ferguson took over. Scotland qualified by winning 2–0 against Australia in a two-leg playoff, but were again drawn into a group of death, this time with Uruguay, Denmark and West Germany. Scotland were eliminated from the tournament with just one point from their three matches, a goalless draw with Uruguay.\n1990s.\nNow managed by Andy Roxburgh, Scotland qualified for their fifth consecutive World Cup in 1990 by finishing second in their qualifying group behind Yugoslavia and ahead of France. Drawn in a group with Costa Rica, Sweden, and Brazil, the Scots lost 1–0 to Costa Rica in their opening match. While they recovered to beat Sweden 2–1 in their second game, they lost to Brazil in their third match 1–0 (goalkeeper Jim Leighton fumbled a shot that allowed Brazil to score the only goal in the closing minutes) and were once again eliminated after the first round.\nScotland failed to qualify for the 1994 FIFA World Cup; the team finished fourth in their qualifying group behind Italy, Switzerland and Portugal. When it became clear that Scotland could not qualify, Andy Roxburgh resigned from his position as team manager.\nCraig Brown took over and guided Scotland to the 1998 FIFA World Cup, finishing behind Austria in the group but qualifying as the best European runners-up. Scotland were drawn against Brazil for a fourth time, and faced the holders in the opening game of the tournament. John Collins scored from the penalty spot to level the score at 1–1, but a Tom Boyd own goal led to a 2–1 defeat. Scotland drew their next game 1–1 with Norway in Bordeaux, but the final match against Morocco ended in a 3–0 loss. Scotland have not appeared at the World Cup since.\n2000s.\nScotland failed to qualify for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, finishing third in their qualifying group behind Croatia and Belgium. Craig Brown resigned after the final qualifying match.\nThe SFA then appointed the first foreign national team manager, former Germany coach Berti Vogts. Poor results in friendly matches and a bad start to 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification caused the team to drop to a record low of 77th in the FIFA World Rankings. Vogts announced his resignation in 2004, blaming the hostile media for his departure. Walter Smith was brought in to replace Vogts and some improved results followed, but the team finished third in their group behind Italy and Norway and failed to qualify.\n2010s.\nAfter a narrow failure to qualify for UEFA Euro 2008, George Burley was hired as the new manager. He was criticised by the media after the team lost their first 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Macedonia. After Scotland lost their fourth match 3–0 to the Netherlands, captain Barry Ferguson and goalkeeper Allan McGregor were excluded from the starting lineup for the following match against Iceland due to a \"breach of discipline\". Despite winning 2–1 against Iceland, Scotland suffered a terrible 4–0 defeat by Norway in the next qualifier, and effectively needed to win their final two games to have a realistic chance of making the qualifying play-offs. They defeated Macedonia 2–0, but were eliminated by a 1–0 loss to the Netherlands in the last game. Burley was sacked after a 3–0 friendly defeat by Wales soon afterwards.\nCraig Levein replaced Burley, but he left following a poor start to 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification, having taken just two points from four games. Gordon Strachan was appointed manager in January 2013, but defeats in his first two competitive matches meant that Scotland were the first UEFA team to be mathematically eliminated from the 2014 World Cup. Scotland finished by winning three of their last four matches, including two victories against Croatia, placing fourth in the group when fifth or sixth looked likely (they thus maintained a record of never having finished in the lowest two places of any World Cup qualification group).\nIn qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Scotland were drawn in the same group as England, facing their rivals in a competitive fixture for the first time since 1999. On 11 November 2016, England won 3–0 at Wembley; the return match in June 2017 saw Leigh Griffiths score two late free-kicks to give Scotland a 2–1 lead, but Harry Kane scored in added time to force a 2–2 draw. A draw away to Slovenia in the final game of the group ended Scottish hopes of a play-off position, and Strachan subsequently left his position by mutual consent.\n2020s.\nSteve Clarke was appointed Scotland manager in May 2019. After qualifying for UEFA Euro 2020, their first major tournament since the 1998 World Cup, Scotland finished second in Group F of 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification. This progressed the team into the play-offs, where they lost 3–1 Ukraine in a semi-final at Hampden."

        "text": "Shooting sports have been contested at the Commonwealth Games at every games since 1966 with the exception of the 1970 and 2022 Commonwealth Games.\nEvents were open until they were segregated by gender in 1994 for pistol and most rifle events and in 2002 for trap and skeet events; the full bore rifle competitions remained open.\nEditions.\n2022 Games.\nShooting is an optional sport at the Commonwealth Games, but had been routinely included since 1974. In January 2018 it was announced that shooting would not feature in the 2022 Games programme, citing a lack of facilities near Birmingham. In December 2018, a delegation including the International Shooting Sport Federation and British Shooting visited Birmingham and discussed the addition of shooting with the Birmingham Organising Committee. In June 2019 it was reported that this proposal had been unsuccessful.\nIn response, India - who count Shooting as one of their most successful sports - threatened to boycott the 2022 Games in their entirety. In September 2019, Indian Olympic Association (IOA) President Narinder Batra stated that the Games \"are a waste of time and money\" and that India should withdraw. Batra's comments drew broad criticism from Indian athletes.\nIn January 2020, the IOA submitted a proposal to the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) to host a combined archery and shooting championships in Chandigarh during January 2022. The CGF Executive Board approved the proposal in February 2020, and also confirmed that the 2022 Commonwealth Shooting and Archery Championships and the 2022 Commonwealth Games would be two separately organised and funded Commonwealth Sport events. In July 2021, the CGF announced that the event had been cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic in India.\n2026 Games.\nIn July 2022, the organising committee for the 2026 Commonwealth Games released their programme, which also did not include shooting. India expressed strong disappointment, raising the matter with organisers from Victoria during the Birmingham Games. In August 2022, Shooting Australia announced that the ISSF has submitted a proposal for shooting when the expression of interest period for additional sports opened. Like the proposals for the 2022 Games, the programme was significantly restricted and included just four disciplines - Skeet, Air Rifle, Air Pistol and Fullbore Rifle. This dropped cartridge pistol, 50m rifle, trap and double trap. \"Para-Shooting\" events were also promised, though it was not specified whether this was limited to airgun disciplines or included Para-Skeet, as demonstrated at the 2017 CSF(ED) Championships in Wales.\nIn October 2022, the inclusion of Shooting was confirmed, but without Fullbore Rifle. It was later announced that Shooting would be held in the Gippsland region, east of Melbourne. The proposal had originally been based in Greater Bendigo, north of Melbourne - to use the Wellsford Fullbore Rifle Range (which also hosted the 2006 Commonwealth Games fullbore events).\nThere is concern as to the continuation of meaningful CSF Championships, as test events for the Games would typically follow the Games programme - not a full programme. This has also raised concerns over funding for both the Championships and participating teams as this has traditionally been drawn from Games budgets as part of preparations.\nAll-time medal table.\n\"Updated after the 2018 Commonwealth Games\"\nGames records.\nDue to ISSF Finals format changes, all 2018 finals set Games Records by default."

The ceremony involved 44 decorated vessels and cost HK$40 million (about US$5 million) to stage, lasting 90 minutes. Tickets to the opening ceremony was sold at HK$1000.\nLeader entrances.\nSpecial guest People's Republic of China State Councilor Liu Yandong is first introduced.

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball batting champions",
        "text": "In baseball, batting average (AVG) is a measure of a batter's success rate in achieving a hit during an at bat. In Major League Baseball (MLB), it is calculated by dividing a player's hits by his at bats (AB). In MLB, a player in each league wins the \"batting title\" each season for having the highest batting average that year. The American League (AL) winner is known as the \"Rod Carew American League Batting Champion\", while the National League (NL) leader is designated the \"Tony Gwynn National League Batting Champion\". Since 1957, a player must have 3.1 plate appearances (PA) per scheduled game in that league (for a total of 502 over the current 162-game season) to qualify for the batting title. However, if a player's lead in AVG is sufficiently large that enough hitless at bats can be added to reach this requirement and the player still would have the highest batting average, he wins the title. Tony Gwynn, for example, had 159 hits in 451 ABs in 1996 (.353 average) but only 498 PAs. Gwynn's batting average would have dropped to .349 (159 hits in 455 ABs) with four hitless ABs added to reach the 502 PA requirement, but this would still have been higher than the next-highest eligible player (Ellis Burks with a .344 average), so he was awarded the 1996 NL batting title.\nThe first batting average champion in the NL was Ross Barnes; in the league's inaugural 1876 season, Barnes batted .429 for the Chicago White Stockings. The AL was established in 1901, and Hall of Fame second baseman Nap Lajoie led that league with a .426 average for the Philadelphia Athletics. Ty Cobb of the Detroit Tigers, who also holds the highest career batting average of .366, led the AL in average in 11 (or 12) seasons. Honus Wagner and Gwynn are tied for the second-most titles, with eight apiece in the NL. It is unclear whether Lajoie or Cobb won the 1910 AL title, with some sources attributing the title to each man. If Cobb is credited with the 1910 title, he won 9 consecutive titles from 1907 to 1915 and 12 total titles for his career. Otherwise, Rogers Hornsby won the most consecutive titles, with six from 1920 to 1925. Without the 1910 title, Cobb still led the league in five consecutive seasons from 1911 to 1915. Cobb holds the record for highest average in two and three consecutive seasons (.414 from 1911 to 1912 and .408 from 1911 to 1913), but Hornsby holds the record for four and five consecutive seasons (.404 from 1922 to 1925 and .402 from 1921 to 1925). Wagner, Rod Carew, Wade Boggs, and Gwynn have each won four consecutive titles. Lajoie also had a streak of four league-leading seasons from 1901 to 1904 if he is credited with the contested AL title in 1902. At the 2016 MLB All-Star Game in San Diego, MLB announced that the AL and NL batting champions would henceforth be named in honor of Carew and Gwynn, respectively. Gwynn won all eight titles in the NL with the San Diego Padres, while Carew was a seven-time AL batting champion.\nBarnes' initial NL-leading average of .4286 in 1876 set the single-season record which stood for a decade. Tip O'Neill topped this total with a .4352 average in 1887 (that batting average had to be calculated without counting walks as hits, because of the walk-as-base-hit rule being in effect that year only), and Hugh Duffy set the current record mark in 1894 by posting a .4397 batting average. Under the current 3.1 PA qualification, players have posted a .400 batting average for a season 28 times. Ted Williams' .4057 in 1941 is the most recent such season, one of 13 to occur since 1900. George Brett in 1980 is the only player to maintain a .400 average into September since 1941. Additionally, only Brett and John Olerud in 1993 maintained such an average into August. With the modern scarcity of .400 hitters, recent players who have been above .400 early in the season, such as Chipper Jones in 2008, have drawn significant attention in the media. Brett's .390 in 1980 and Gwynn's .394 in 1994 are the only seasons in which a player reached .390 since 1941. Carl Yastrzemski's .301 in the 1968 American League was the lowest batting average ever to lead a league. Willie Keeler's 1897,Zack Wheat's 1918 and Rod Carew's 1972 are the only three title seasons in which the winner hit no home runs. Joe Mauer's 2006 title made him the first catcher to ever win an AL batting title, and his third title in 2009 surpassed Ernie Lombardi's previous record of two titles for a catcher in any league.\nThe closest finish in a batting race came in 1945 when Snuffy Stirnweiss batted .309, topping Tony Cuccinello's .308 average for the American League title by .00008. George Kell beat out Williams in 1949 by .00015. The closest race in the National League came in 2003 when Albert Pujols held off Todd Helton on the last day of the season by .00022. The closest National League race before that was in 1931 with Chick Hafey edging out Bill Terry by .00028. Lajoie's .426 average in 1901 was 86 points higher than runner-up Mike Donlin's .340, the largest margin of victory for a batting champion. Cap Anson's .399 in 1881 was 71 points higher than Joe Start in 1881, the widest margin in the National League.\nIn 2020, D.J. LeMahieu of the New York Yankees won the AL batting title, thereby becoming the first player to definitively win batting titles in both the American and National Leagues; he had also won the NL batting title in 2016 as a member of the Colorado Rockies. However, Ed Delahanty would have that distinction if he is credited with the disputed 1902 American League title, as he was also the 1899 National League champion. The only other player to win titles in multiple leagues was Pete Browning, who won American Association titles in 1882 and 1885, along with the lone Players' League championship in 1890. Barnes and Deacon White each won National Association and National League titles, but the National Association is not regarded as an official league. In addition, Oscar Charleston won batting championships in the Negro National League and Eastern Colored League.\nIn 1990, Willie McGee posted a .335 average over 542 at-bats in the NL before being traded to the AL on August 29. Although McGee finished the season in the AL, he had enough PA's in the NL to qualify for the NL batting title, which he won narrowly over Eddie Murray's .330. However, McGee batted .274 that season in the AL, bringing down his overall average to .324 and allowing Murray to lead the majors in batting average and not win a batting title.\nNegro leagues.\nOn December 16, 2020, Major League Baseball announced that the records of Negro league baseball from 1920 to 1948 would be designated as major league status. As such, seven different leagues that existed in that time period are now recognized as being on the same level as MLB. In the 28-year major league history, nine players won a league batting title multiple times: Oscar Charleston (3), Josh Gibson (3), Monte Irvin (2), Oscar Johnson (2), Buck Leonard (2), Jud Wilson (2), Artie Wilson (2), Mule Suttles (2), and Turkey Stearnes (2)."

        "text": "The County Ground is a cricket ground in Swindon, Wiltshire. The ground is located to the north of the County Football Ground used by Swindon Town. It has played host to first-class and List A cricket matches, in addition to playing host to Wiltshire County Cricket Club in minor counties cricket.\nHistory.\nSwindon Cricket Club was founded in 1844. The cricket club originally played at a ground where the Upham Road is, before moving to a new ground in the Greywethers Avenue area of Swindon in 1849. The cricket club merged with Swindon Rangers F.C. in 1860, with whom they shared a ground called the Sands in the Goddard Avenue area. In the early 1890s, a group of Swindon businessmen joined together with £700 to buy and develop of land. The County Ground was constructed on this land, with the cricket club (which had recently merged with the Great Western Railway Cricket Club) moving there in 1895. Wiltshire first played minor counties cricket there in 1897, when the County Ground played host to Glamorgan. The ground played host to the strong Wiltshire sides of the first decade of the 20th century, with the county winning the Minor Counties Championship in 1907 and 1909.\nDuring the Second World War the ground was requisitioned by the War Office and became a temporary prisoner-of-war camp. Following the war, Wiltshire continued to play minor counties fixtures there at least once a season. The County Ground played host to its only first-class cricket match in 1967, when a combined Minor Counties cricket team played the touring Pakistanis, which the tourists narrowly won by 23 runs. Three years later Gloucestershire first used the County Ground as an outground when they played Sussex in a List A one-day match in the John Player League. Further one-day matches were hosted there in the 1973 Benson &amp; Hedges Cup when the Minor Counties South cricket team hosted Gloucestershire, followed a decade later by Wiltshire playing two one-day matches in the 1983 and 1984 NatWest Trophy, in which the record attendance of 3,500 was set.\nThe County Ground played host to international cricket when it hosted two matches in the 1982 ICC Trophy, with Bangladesh versus East Africa and Canada versus Gibraltar. Gloucestershire returned to the County Ground in the 1985 John Player Special League, playing one match in the competition there; this was also the case in the 1986 John Player Special League and 1987 Refuge Assurance League. In 1988, Warwickshire were due as visitors, in addition to Worcesteshire against the Minor Counties cricket team in the Benson and Hedges Cup, however the pitch was damaged by weedkiller and the fixtures were moved to Bristol and Haden Hill respectively. After a gap of three years, Gloucestershire played their final batch of three one-day matches at the County Ground in the 1990 and 1991 Refuge Assurance League's, and in the 1992 Sunday League. Wiltshire have not used the ground for minor counties matches since 2002. A campaign was launched in 2006 by the adjacent football club to bring the County Ground back up to county cricket standards, though these plans failed to materialise.\nThe ground includes a pavilion, which has first floor seating for members. Overshadowing the ground at the Football Ground End is the home ground of Swindon Town F.C."

        "text": "George E. \"Gooch\" Gauthier (February 3, 1890 – August 11, 1964) was an American football and basketball player, athletic coach, and college athletics administrator. He served as the head football coach at Michigan Agricultural College, now Michigan State University, in 1918 and at Ohio Wesleyan University from 1921 to 1946, compiling a career record of 125–101–15. Gauthier was also the head basketball coach at Michigan Agricultural from 1916 to 1920 and at Ohio Wesleyan for the 1945–1946 season, tallying a career mark of 47–46. \nAthlete at Michigan State.\nA native of Detroit, Michigan, Gauthier played both basketball and football for Michigan Agricultural College between 1911 and 1914. While attending the school, \"Gauthier peeled three bushels of potatotes daily to pay for his meals and delivered laundry for expense money.\" He was also president of the student council as a senior. He was the starting quarterback for the school's football team in 1912 and 1913 and led the team to upset victories over Ohio State in 1912 and Michigan in 1913. In the 1912 game against Ohio State, the Aggies trailed 20–0 at halftime but scored 32 points in the second half, including two scores by Gauthier, to win the game, 32–20. Years later, Gauthier described the victory over Michigan as his first great thrill:\"My mind goes back to 1913, when Michigan State's team — a little band of agriculture students — journeyed to Ann Arbor to meet mighty Michigan. I was the 130-pound quarterback, cocky and confident we could beat the Wolverines. I insisted my mother come over from Detroit to see the game, her first football contest. We won the game 12–7 and my mother became a football fan to provide my first big thrill.\"\nThe 12–7 win over the Wolverines marked the first victory by a Michigan State team in the long Michigan-Michigan State rivalry and ruined Michigan's unbeaten season. The 1912 and 1913 football teams with Gauthier as quarterback won 14 games and lost only one game. Gauthier later recalled, \"I played two years at quarterback, never missed a minute of play, and never played in a losing game.\"\nCoach at Michigan State.\nAfter graduating from M.A.C. in 1914, Gauthier remained in East Lansing as an assistant athletic director for six years. He was an assistant football coach under John Macklin from 1915 to 1917, and became the head football coach in 1918, compiling a record of 4–3. The biggest victory in his single season as head football coach was a 12–9 decision over Knute Rockne's Notre Dame team. Gauthier was also the head basketball coach at Michigan Agricultural from 1916 to 1920, tallying a record of 38–35.\nCoach and athletic director at Ohio Wesleyan.\nGauthier served as the head football coach at Ohio Wesleyan University for 26 years from 1921 to 1946 and compiled a record of 121–98–15. He coached the Ohio Wesleyan football team to a 17–7 win over the Michigan Wolverines in the opening game of the 1928 college football season, marking the first loss by Michigan in a season opener since 1883. The 1928 victory over Michigan was also the first game played in the newly constructed Michigan Stadium. Gauthier later described the victory over Michigan as the greatest thrill of his career:\"No one who was there will ever forget — that little band of Battling Bishops against the mighty Wolves. A special train-load of faculty, alumni and students went along for the dedication game. We were nervous in the unfinished dressing rooms. With a half-hour to go to game time someone started singing, and soon the locker room rang with close harmony college songs. We were relaxed, and we were\nready. After the first few minutes, a player coming off the field told me: 'They're not too tough, coach. We can take them.'\"\nGauthier also served as Ohio Wesleyan's athletic director for 34 years from 1921 to 1955.

The award was first given following the 1968–69 season. It was renamed to honor Basketball Hall of Famer Larry Bird, who played at Indiana State from 1977 to 1979 and led the Sycamores to the 1979 NCAA Championship game. Bird won every major player of the year award (including the Naismith and Wooden awards) in 1979.\nCreighton and Drake have the most all-time winners with seven, but Creighton left the conference in July 2013 to join the reconfigured Big East Conference. Four current conference members have not had a winner, but three of them (Belmont, Murray State, and UIC) played their first MVC seasons in 2022–23, and the other (Valparaiso) played its first MVC season in 2017–18.\nThere have never been any ties for the player of the year, but there have been 10 repeat winners in the award's history. Of the repeat winners, Fred VanVleet of Wichita State (2014 and 2016) and A. J. Green of Northern Iowa (2020, 2022) won in non-consecutive years."

        "text": "Alexander Jesus Torres Matos (born December 8, 1987) is a Venezuelan former professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Tampa Bay Rays, San Diego Padres and New York Mets. He is known as the first pitcher in Major League Baseball to take advantage of the league rules allowing pitchers to wear protective headgear full-time.\nProfessional career.\nLos Angeles Angels.\nTorres was signed on January 12, 2005, by Los Angeles Angels scout Carlos Porte, as an international free agent, and was assigned to the Angels' Dominican Summer League Angels that season. He spent the 2006 and 2007 seasons with the Angels' rookie-level Arizona League Angels, as well as the beginning of the 2008 season before earning a promotion to the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes in the Class A-Advanced California League.\nIn 2009, Torres was again assigned to Rancho Cucamonga, where he earned minor league Pitcher of the Month honors for the Angels organization in both June and July. He held a stretch of 19 consecutive scoreless innings pitched (June 9–29, 2008) and won his final 5 starts before being promoted again to the Arkansas Travelers in the Double-A Texas League on July 31, 2009.\nTampa Bay Rays.\nOn August 28, 2009, Torres was traded to the Tampa Bay Rays along with infielders Sean Rodriguez and Matthew Sweeney for pitcher Scott Kazmir, and he was assigned to the Montgomery Biscuits in the Double-A Southern League. Following the 2009 season, the Rays added Torres to the 40-man roster on November 19 to protect him from the Rule 5 draft. Torres started 27 games for Montgomery in 2010, posting a 3.47 ERA and 150 strike-outs in 142 innings.\nFor the 2011 season, Torres was promoted to the Durham Bulls in the Triple-A International League. He was promoted to the Major League for the first time on July 18, 2011. He pitched in a single game on July 18, giving up one hit and three walks in one inning, before he was returned to Triple-A. He was called up to the Rays again in September, pitching in 3 more games in relief. For the season in Triple-A, he started 27 games, had a 3.08 ERA and 156 strike-outs in 146 innings.\nTorres began 2012 as a starter for the Durham Bulls, but he struggled with control and was sent to the bullpen after 5 starts with a 10.38 ERA. He made 11 relief appearances, allowing 11 earned runs in 20 innings, and then returned to the starting rotation in mid-June. He continued to struggle in 8 more starts, allowing 24 earned runs in 24 innings, before he was placed on the disabled list and then sent to the rookie-level Gulf Coast League Rays in Port Charlotte, Florida to work with pitching coach Marty DeMerritt. Torres returned to make the final start of the year in Durham, pitching 5 scoreless innings and striking out 10. He then pitched in the winter leagues in his native Venezuela.\nTorres again opened 2013 with the Triple-A Durham Bulls as he was eligible for a fourth option year after being added to the 40-man roster in 2009. He pitched to a 3.52 ERA in 9 starts in Durham in 2013.\nTorres was called up the Rays in mid-May when David Price went down with an injury. He appeared in 2 games out of the bullpen, including a scoreless four-inning stint, and was sent back down to Durham. He was recalled on June 1 to add depth to the bullpen. There was discussion in June about turning Torres into a starter, but manager Joe Maddon opted to keep him in the bullpen. Torres remained with the big league club for the remainder of the season, accumulating a 1.71 ERA and 62 strike-outs in 58 innings and 39 games.\nSan Diego Padres.\nOn January 22, 2014, the Rays traded Torres and Jesse Hahn to the San Diego Padres for Logan Forsythe, Brad Boxberger, Matt Andriese, Maxx Tissenbaum and Matt Lollis. On June 21, 2014, Torres became the first Major League Baseball pitcher to wear the isoBLOX protective cap introduced early in the year. MLB approved the product in January, nearly a year and a half after pitcher Brandon McCarthy was struck in the head by a line drive and suffered life-threatening brain injuries. Other pitchers with traumatic injuries includes Juan Nicasio, Alex Cobb and Aroldis Chapman, which led MLB to ramp up efforts to better protect pitchers. Torres accumulated a 3.33 ERA over 54 innings in 70 appearances in 2014, striking out 51 and walking 33.\nNew York Mets.\nOn March 30, 2015, the Padres traded Torres to the New York Mets for Cory Mazzoni and a player to be named later. Torres pitched to a 3.15 ERA, but walked 26 batters in and allowed left-handed hitters a .268 batting average against. All of this combined with the fact that Torres was out of minor league options ultimately led the Mets to designate him for assignment on August 4. Torres cleared waivers and was reassigned to the Mets' triple-A club in Las Vegas.\nAtlanta Braves.\nTorres signed a minor league contract with the Atlanta Braves on December 31, 2015. On March 30, 2016, he was released.\nGunma Diamond Pegasus.\nHe signed with the Gunma Diamond Pegasus of the Baseball Challenge League.\nTigres de Quintana Roo.\nOn January 15, 2020, Torres signed with the Tigres de Quintana Roo of the Mexican League. On April 6, 2020, Torres was released."

        "title": "Beer in the Snooker Club",
        "text": "Beer In The Snooker Club is a semi-autobiographical novel by the Egyptian writer Waguih Ghali written in English and first published in 1964.\nStructure.\nOn the surface, the novel reads as a typical post-colonial novel; the Francophone, British educated Egyptian Coptic protagonists struggle with their conflicting allegiances to the English culture that produced and imposed colonialism, and to the Egyptian revolution that opposed colonialism but also implemented repressive domestic policies. The novel ultimately rejects the mediated binaries of post-coloniality, searching instead for a notion of cosmopolitan identity, defined both as a historically and locally situated urban subject and as a politically engaged 'citizen of the world'.\nPlot.\nBehind the bar at Jameel's in Cairo hang two mugs engraved with the names of Ram, the protagonist, and Font. During their years together in London, they drank many a pint of Bass from these mugs. But there is no Bass in Nasser's Egypt – so Ram and Font have to make do with a heady mixture of beer, vodka and whisky. Yearning for Bass, they long to be far from a revolution that neither serves the people nor allows their rich aunts to live the life of leisure they are accustomed to. Stranded between two cultures, Ram and Font must choose between dangerous political opposition and reluctant acquiescence.\nReception.\nAccording to author Diana Athill, \"Beer in the Snooker Club\" is \"a classic of the literature of emigration.\"\nAhdaf Soueif wrote that \"Beer in the Snooker Club is one of the best novels about Egypt ever written. In the protagonist, Ram, a passionate nationalist who is nonetheless an anglophile, Waguih Ghali creates a hero who is tragic, funny and sympathetic. Through him we are presented with an authentic and acutely observed account of Egyptian society at a time of great upheaval. It is marvellously cheering that this novel is available again after twenty years.\"\nGabriel Josipovici wrote \"This is a wonderful book. Quiet, understated, seemingly without any artistic or formal pretensions. Yet quite devastating in its human and political insights... if you want to convey to someone what Egypt was like in the forties and fifties, and why it is impossible for Europeans or Americans to understand, give them this book. It makes The Alexandria Quartet look like the travel brochure it is.\"\nWriting in \"The Observer\", Rachel Aspden feels that the book \"may be angry, but it is also extremely funny. Ghali neatly skewers the pretensions of the Cairene elite along with the hypocrisies of empire... In Ghali's Cairo, almost everything is phoney.\""

        "text": "The East Tennessee State Buccaneers men's basketball team represents East Tennessee State University (ETSU), located in Johnson City, Tennessee, in men's college basketball. East Tennessee State is coached by Brooks Savage and currently competes in the Southern Conference. The team last played in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament in 2017. In March 2020 the Buccaneers won the SoCon championship.\nHistory.\nThe Les Robinson / Alan LeForce era.\nCommonly referred to as \"The Glory Days\" of ETSU basketball, between 1989 and 1992, ETSU won 4 straight Southern Conference titles while compiling 99 wins. During this 4-year period ETSU had wins over prestigious programs such as Arizona, NC State (3 times), Wake Forest, Cincinnati, BYU, Xavier, Mississippi State, Southern Miss, Tennessee (twice) and Memphis. ETSU also suffered their most famous loss when they lost by 1 point to top ranked Oklahoma as a 16th seed in the 1989 NCAA tournament.\nWhen Les Robinson left for NC State after the 1990 season, longtime assistant Alan Leforce took over a veteran team led by Senior Keith \"Mister\" Jennings. The team was ranked as high as 10th in the nation during the 1991 season and finished the year 17th in the AP poll and 15th in the Coaches poll. In the 1992 NCAA tournament ETSU upset the Arizona Wildcats in the opening round, but eventually fell in the second round to the Michigan Wolverines and the Fab Five.\nThe Buccaneers went into steep decline after that, bottoming out with a 7–20 record in 1995-96. LeForce resigned after the season.\nThe Ed Dechellis era.\nIn 1996 Ed Dechellis replaced Alan Leforce who resigned after the 1995–1996 season. In 2001 Dechellis led ETSU to their first regular season conference title since the 91–92 season. In 2003 Dechellis helped ETSU win their first Southern Conference Tournament title and first NCAA berth since 1992. ETSU faced Wake Forest University in the first round where they lost in the final seconds 73–76 after having a chance to win the game with the last shot. After the 2003 season Dechellis left for Penn State.\nDechellis complied 105–93 record at ETSU but is mostly remembered for bringing prominence back to the ETSU basketball program that had struggled after the 1993 season.\nThe Murry Bartow era.\nIn 2003 ETSU hired Murry Bartow after Ed Dechellis took the head coaching position at Penn State. Bartow took over a senior led team that won 27 games and nearly went undefeated in conference play in his first season; additionally, ETSU won their second straight Southern Conference Tournament and headed back to the NCAA tournament for the second straight year. ETSU had another close call in the 2004 NCAA tournament when they lost to Cincinnati 77–80 in the closing seconds, much like the Wake Forest game the previous year.\nIn the 2005–2006 season ETSU left the Southern Conference to join the Atlantic Sun Conference after the school dropped football. During his time in the Atlantic Sun ETSU has received 4 postseason bids. Back to Back NCAA tournaments in 2009 and 2010, the NIT in 2007 and the CIT in 2011. The Buccaneers rejoined the Southern Conference as part of reinstating football in 2016. After 12 years, an overall record of 224–169 (with a record of 16–14, 8–10 in SoCon play in the 2014–15 season), and three NCAA appearances at East Tennessee State, Bartow was fired due a five-season tournament drought with declining team performance.\nThe Steve Forbes era.\nAfter Murry Bartow was fired, Steve Forbes became the 16th head coach in ETSU's 95-year history on March 30, 2015. He served two seasons as an assistant coach at Wichita State Shockers men's basketball where he helped take the Shockers to the Sweet 16 the past season before taking the ETSU job. Forbes' recruiting ties and his extensive background as an assistant coach at the NCAA Division I level – which included a five-year stop at the University of Tennessee – made him a perfect fit for ETSU, according to ETSU Director of Intercollegiate Athletics Dr. Richard Sander. In five seasons at ETSU, Forbes tallied at least 24 wins each year. The 2017 team shared the Southern Conference regular season title and won the Southern Conference Tournament in Asheville to represent the league in the NCAA tournament. Forbes led the team to another conference regular season championship in 2019-20 and a school record 30 wins. On April 30, 2020, Forbes left ETSU to accept the head coaching job at Wake Forest.\nJason Shay.\nOn May 7, 2020, a week after Forbes departed for Wake Forest, ETSU assistant coach Jason Shay was named the 17th head coach of the program. In the 2020-21 season, Shay led the Buccaneers to a 13-12 overall record and an appearance in the semifinals of the 2021 Southern Conference Tournament. On March 30, 2021, Shay decided to resign after one season as head coach.\nThe Desmond Oliver era.\nSix days after Jason Shay resigned, University of Tennessee assistant coach Desmond Oliver was named the 18th head coach of the program on April 5, 2021.\nDesmond Oliver was let go on March 10, 2023. Dr. Richard Sander, ETSU's Athletic Director, stated “I met with Coach Oliver today, and we discussed the program is not meeting the expectations of the Athletics Department. We feel that parting ways is the best thing for our men’s basketball program and our student-athletes. We wish Coach Oliver the best in his future endeavors.”\nOliver had finished the second year of a five-year contract, the first 20-loss season for ETSU in a decade. \nThe Brooks Savage era.\nBrooks Savage was named the 19th head coach of ETSU men’s basketball on March 20, 2023.\nPostseason.\nNCAA Division I tournament results.\nThe Buccaneers have appeared in the NCAA Division I Tournament ten times. Their combined record is 2–11.

        "title": "Cricket (musical)",
        "text": "Cricket, also called Cricket (Hearts and Wickets), is a short musical with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber, and lyrics and book by Tim Rice. It was commissioned for Queen Elizabeth's 60th birthday celebration, and was first performed at Windsor Castle on 18 June 1986.\nA lighthearted, tongue-in-cheek show running 30 minutes, its plot was set against the backdrop of the semi-fictional Headingley Cricket Club, whose star player, Donald, is torn between his team and his girlfriend Emma – as she decides to abandon watching cricket for what appears to be a far more exciting life at the race track with the caddish Vincent.\nAfter its premiere for the Queen, as well as a pair of follow-up performances, the musical was shelved; several tunes were later re-used for the musicals \"Aspects of Love\" and \"Sunset Boulevard\". No commercial recording has been made.\n\"Cricket\" is, to date, the final original musical written by the team of Lloyd Webber and Rice.\nHistory.\nAfter their collaboration on \"Evita\" in 1978, composer Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyricist Tim Rice took what was originally intended to be a temporary break from their theatrical partnership. They did not work together again until the request for this \"pièce d'occasion\" came up, and \"Cricket\" ended up being their final original musical.\nPrince Edward, the Queen's youngest son, commissioned a short musical from Lloyd Webber and Rice for his mother's 60th birthday celebration. The game of cricket was Tim Rice's favourite pastime – he had a cricket field on the grounds of his home and had his own cricket team – and Rice had a particular passion for this new comic musical about England's national sport. Rice used actual cricket-related names for his characters, boosting the light-hearted feeling of the piece. He and Lloyd Webber created a 30-minute tongue-in-cheek \"musicalette\" for the Queen.\nAs with Lloyd Webber and Rice's previous musicals, \"Cricket\" is sung-through, with little spoken dialogue.\nSynopsis.\nThe show begins during a match of Headingley Cricket Club. The game is watched by the Earl of Headingley, his daughter Emma Kirkstall-Lane, and Vincent St. Leger. The Earl and the cricketers sing the praises of cricket. (\"The Summer Game\")\nEmma intends to marry Headingley player Donald Hobbs. And at the moment, even though he is Emma's father, the Earl is more approving of Donald than of Emma, because he feels his daughter is not supportive enough of Donald's cricketing. Emma loves Donald, but she thinks he neglects her somewhat for his cricket playing, and she wants more time together. She feels that she will be forever secondary in Donald's eyes until he retires from cricket. (\"As the Seasons Slip Fruitlessly By\")\nVincent, who is devoted to horse races, overhears Emma, and offers his own rather self-interested solution: leaving for the races in lieu of the cricket match. Emma is reluctant at first, but decides that maybe Vincent is right, and runs off with him. (\"The Sport of Kings\") The opposing team's fast bowler, Winston B. Packer, sings about how wonderful it is to be able to hit batsmen when they miss – and he injures several batsmen during the course of the song. (\"The Art of Bowling\")\nWhile Donald is batting, he sees Emma leave with Vincent. He's hurt and truly torn – does he stay and bat to help his team win and lose Emma, or does he leave and try to get her back? In the end, sportsmanship prevails: Donald cannot let his team down. But he has been hit a few times during the song, and is suddenly levelled. As he lies dazed on the ground, lines from various people and various moments of the game bombard him – Winston, Emma, Vincent, his team. (\"All I Ask of Life\")\nDuring the tea interval, Emma returns, dejected, feeling Vincent has deceived her. Not only has she lost all of her money, but she has lost Donald as well. She blames herself, and doesn't see how anyone will ever love her again. (\"Fools Like Me\")\nDonald and the cricketers return to the game after the interval, but Donald ignores Emma. The Earl, however, lets fly at Emma and Vincent. Because of Emma's gambling debts, the Earl has lost his reputation and is in financial distress. Vincent tries to speak, but the Earl turns his attention, and wrath, onto him. The Earl is a powerful member of the Jockey Club, and bans Vincent from all racing events for life. Vincent turns to Emma for sympathy, but she accuses him of deceiving her and getting her into trouble with her father. (\"A Ban for Life\")\nVincent and Emma's conversation is cut off by a scream. Wittering has been injured and can no longer continue in the game. Headingley CC needs 10 more runs to win, but there is no one to take Wittering's place alongside Donald. The Earl laments the bad day for Headingley. (\"Wittering's Final Innings\") Vincent suddenly speaks up and says he will take Wittering's place. (\"The Making of St. Leger\") He joins Donald and the game continues – to the amazement of the cricketers, who believed Vincent had no redeeming qualities. Vincent is beaten up badly during the game, but keeps playing.\nDonald's and Vincent's scores win the game and they are both proclaimed heroes. The Earl is so impressed by Vincent's bravery (and recovery of a vital match!) that he withdraws the horse-racing ban. And Donald tells Emma he will play less cricket and spend more time with her. She wonders, could they go to the horse races? Vincent says he will spend Sundays playing cricket. Winston vows to try slow bowling. And to top it all off, Wittering is feeling better. (\"The Final Stand\")\nDonald and Emma finish making up, and vow to stay together with a sweeping love ballad which ends in a crescendo that everyone joins into, proclaiming the triumph of the cricket metaphor for life and love. (\"One Hot Afternoon\")\nProductions.\nThe show debuted as planned on 18 June 1986 at Windsor Castle, directed by Trevor Nunn and starring Ian Charleson, Sarah Payne, and John Savident. The musicians were members of Colosseum II and others – the ensemble that had first performed Lloyd Webber's \"Variations\". The men's vocal group Cantabile played the cricketers' chorus.\nThe Windsor Castle performance was very well received. Two more performances followed. One was at Lloyd Webber's Sydmonton Festival on 15 July 1986. The last performance was in November 1986 at Tim Rice's favourite charity, the Lord's Taverners Ball, where Rice played the cricketer Wittering, dressed in his own Heartaches Cricket Club uniform.\nA segment of the original rehearsals of \"Cricket\" was televised on the Andrew Lloyd Webber instalment of \"The South Bank Show\", which aired on 15 November 1986. The segment featured Sarah Payne and Alvin Stardust rehearsing \"As the Seasons Slip Fruitlessly By\" and \"The Sport of Kings\".\nThere have been no further performances of the musical.\nAfter 1986.\nLloyd Webber re-used several of \"Cricket\"'s tunes for commercial projects. The melodies of \"All I Ask of Life\", \"Fools Like Me\", and the verses of \"As the Seasons Slip Fruitlessly By\" were adapted into \"Anything but Lonely\", \"Mermaid Song\", and the scene \"George's House at Pau\" in the 1989 musical \"Aspects of Love\". In addition, \"One Hot Afternoon\" and the chorus of \"As the Seasons Slip Fruitlessly By\" eventually became \"As If We Never Said Goodbye\", and a bridge for \"This Time Next Year\" in the 1993 musical \"Sunset Boulevard\".\nThis meant that \"Cricket\", which had been extremely well received, was a dead item and could never be expanded into a full theatrical musical, a fact that greatly distressed Tim Rice.\nNo commercial recording has been made of the show; an official recording was begun, but then abandoned before completion. A non-commercial demo recording was made in 1986. The \"Cricket\" libretto was later published in the 2004 book \"A Breathless Hush...: The MCC Anthology of Cricket Verse\".\nThe opening number, \"The Summer Game\", was recorded in 2011 by the men's vocal group Cantabile for their album \"Songs of Cricket\"."

        "text": "The Major League Baseball Australian Academy Program (MLBAAP) is a seven-week baseball development program held on the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia for prospective Australian baseball players and officials.\nThe Academy began in 2001 with the backing of the Australian Baseball Federation, Major League Baseball and the Australian Sports Commission, with the aim of improving the quantity and quality of young Australian baseball players. The Academy has included notable MLB coaches such as Rod Carew, Pat Kelly, Graeme Lloyd, David Nilsson, Mark Hutton and Luke Prokopec. MLBAAP has been the catalyst for over 140 professional player signings, boasts 2 Major league players among its alumni (Rich Thompson and Brad Harman) and has seen many more progress through the ranks of the Australia national baseball team.\nStructure.\nThe location of the Academy is the Palm Meadows Radisson Hotel resort, which includes a world-class baseball facility. Players are split into four teams (Roos, Wombats, Koalas and Dingos) and the program is set up very much like professional rookie leagues in North America. Academic staff from several Gold Coast state schools and the Gold Coast Institute of TAFE assist with tutoring and supporting the athletes, to ensure their educational requirements are achieved. Teaching staff are chosen on their experience and empathy regarding the difficult combination of balancing elite sport with academic excellence.

        "text": "In Australia, what is considered the third tier of Rugby is often referred to as club rugby, grade rugby or premier rugby. Club Rugby often focuses on the major metropolitan areas of the respective unions, with teams representing various districts and suburbs. The teams represented in the first grade can and have changed over time, and are open to change at the discretion of the governing body.\nSydney Premiership.\nThe Shute Shield is a rugby union competition in Sydney, New South Wales. It is the premier grade rugby trophy in Sydney rugby. The shield is contested by 11 Sydney Rugby Union clubs and one from Newcastle and Hunter Rugby Union.\nThe first Sydney club competition was held in 1874, contested by Balmain, Newington College, University of Sydney and The King's School, Parramatta. The Shute Shield is seen as the traditional successor to this competition.\nThe shield was donated to the New South Wales Rugby Union in 1923 by Sydney University Football Club, and was named in honour of Robert Elliott Stewart Shute who died while playing for The Rest v NSW XV on 5 June 1922.\nQueensland Premier Rugby.\nQueensland Premier Rugby is the top club competition in Queensland. Nine clubs take part: eight from Brisbane and a club each from the Gold Coast.\nThe first club rugby competition in Queensland was the Hospital Football Challenge, which began in 1899. It was an annual fund-raising venture for the Brisbane Hospital, but the game fell away during and after WWI, and rugby union was abandoned in Queensland after 1919.\nThe competition was restored in 1929 and the original trophy, the magnificent \"Hospital Cup\" became the premiership trophy again. It is now awarded to the winner of the Premier Rugby grand final.\nACTRU Premier Division.\nThe ACTRU Premier Division is the top rugby club competition in Canberra. It is conducted by the region's governing body, the ACT and Southern NSW Rugby Union.\nThe competition was first held in 1938. There are currently, six ACT clubs that compete in the top division. The trophy awarded to the winner of the grand final is the \"John I Dent Cup\", named after the benefactor who donated it to the union. All of the finals are played at Viking Park.\nRugbyWA Premier Grade.\nThe RugbyWA Premier Grade is contested by 14 teams from the Greater Perth Area.\nThe teams currently in the RugbyWA Premier Grade are:\nVictorian Premier Division.\nThe Dewar Shield is contested by 8 teams from the Greater Melbourne Area.\nSouth Australian Premier Grade.\nThe Cooper Premier Grade is contested by 9 teams.\nAs of 2018, there are fourteen clubs which make up RUSA, eleven of these clubs field senior men's sides, eight field senior women's sides and 11 field junior sides. There is also a golden oldies club for players 35+, and a rugby sevens club for women and girls (12+).\nTasmanian Division One.\nAs at the end of 2019, there are 13 clubs which make up the TRU. Teams currently in the Tasmanian Division One are:\nTen of these clubs field senior men's sides, eight field senior women's sides, and five field junior sides. There is also a \"golden oldies\" club for players aged 35+.\nDarwin First Grade.\nThe First Grade competition is contested by 5 teams from the Darwin area.\nNewcastle and Hunter Rugby Union Premiership.\nThe Newcastle and Hunter Rugby Union is based around the NSW city of Newcastle, located ~160 km north of Sydney.\nThe earliest report of a football match in Newcastle was in 1860, when \"'a lover of the old English games has offered one of Mrs. O’Hagan’s most fashionable bonnets as a prize to the fortunate party who shall give the winning (final) kick in a game of foot-ball, to be played on the new cricket ground, near St. John's Church\"'. A precursor to the formation of a local union, the Raysmith Challenge Cup was commenced in 1887 and was contested by Newcastle, Waratah, Advance, Orientals, Union, Ferndale, West Maitland, Raymond Terrace, East Maitland Imperial, Singleton and East Maitland clubs.\nIn 1888 the Northern Branch of the NSW Rugby Football Union was established, later renamed the Newcastle Rugby Union. The competition was suspended during World War 1, reforming in 1925.  The 1925 competition comprised Cook's Hill Old Boys, Newcastle High School Old Boys, Great Public Schools' Old Boys (later Wanderers), Lysaght's Limited, Northern Suburbs and Mayfield. The NHRU currently sponsors Premier Rugby, Divisional Men’s, Social Men’s, Women’s, Juniors and Schools competitions. The 2019 Premier Rugby competition was contested by nine clubs across 3 men’s grades.\nPremier Rugby Clubs in the NHRU (2019)"

        "text": "Bellator MMA (formerly known as \"Bellator Fighting Championships\") is an American mixed martial arts promotion, and the following is a history of its champions in each weight class.\nAt the time of its inception in 2008, CEO Bjorn Rebney founded Bellator Fighting Championships as a tournament based organization. The inaugural champion for each weight class was determined by the winner of an eight-man tournament. All subsequent title challengers were required to first win an eight-man tournament in a specific weight class in order to earn the right to challenge that division's reigning champion. Dethroned champions were required to re-enter the tournaments in order to attempt to regain their title. Under Bjorn Rebney's sole leadership, Bellator MMA would strictly adhere to these rules during the first four years of its operation.\nThe first changes to this format would begin to appear not long after Viacom, Inc. purchased a controlling stake in the organization. In November 2012, CEO Bjorn Rebney announced the introduction of a \"championship rematch clause\". This would allow Bellator to schedule an immediate title-fight rematch if officials deemed the fight necessary. The next major change occurred during Bellator's when it was announced that all three tournaments would be shorter, four-man affairs instead of the standard eight. Though originally stated to return to the eight-man only tournaments afterwards, officials instead decided to add two additional four-man tournaments to the existing tournament lineup in an effort to provide a more consistent flow of title challengers for their champions to face.\nTwo additional rule changes would be announced. The first was the \"tournament champion replacement clause\" introduced in August 2013. This allowed officials to grant title shots to replacement fighters when tournament winners were injured, or otherwise unavailable, through a complex voting and points system. Then, in June 2014, CEO Bjorn Rebney made an announcement stating that any fighter who had previously won a Bellator tournament would maintain permanent eligibility to fight for a title without having to re-enter another tournament. Neither of these changes would ever be implemented, however, as one week later Bellator MMA and its founder and CEO Bjorn Rebney parted ways, bringing about an end to the organization's tournament based model.\nCurrent champions.\n&lt;section begin=Current /&gt;\n! width=\"25%\"| Division !!width=\"35%\"| Champion !!width=\"20%\"| Since !!width=\"5%\"| Defenses"

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball tie-breakers",
        "text": "A tie-breaker was required in Major League Baseball (MLB) when two or more teams were tied at the end of the regular season for a postseason position such as a league pennant (prior to the introduction of the League Championship Series in 1969), a division title, or a wild card spot. Until 2022, both the American League (AL) and the National League (NL) used a one-game playoff format for , although the NL used a best-of-three series prior to 1969, when the leagues were split into divisions. As these tie-breaker games counted as part of the regular season and MLB teams (American League beginning in 1961, and National League beginning in 1962) have 162-game regular season schedules, the tie-breaker games were sometimes referred to as \"Game 163\". In 2022, as part of the new Collective Bargaining Agreement to end the 2021–22 Major League Baseball lockout, tiebreaker games were replaced with statistical tiebreaker procedures.\nSixteen – 12 single-game and four series – have been played in MLB history. In baseball statistics, games counted as regular season games with all events in them counted towards regular season statistics. This had implications on statistical races, such as when Matt Holliday won the batting average and runs batted in titles thanks in part to his performance in the 2007 . Home-field advantage for was determined by a coin flip through the 2008 season, after which performance-based criteria, starting with head-to-head record of the tied teams, were put in place.\nAlthough there have been no situations requiring a between more than two teams, it was possible. In 2007, for example, the Philadelphia Phillies, New York Mets, San Diego Padres, Colorado Rockies, and Arizona Diamondbacks finished the season within two games of one another. The possibility existed for as many as four teams to be locked in a series of that year to decide the NL East, West, and Wild Card. Similarly, late in the 2012 season the possibility existed for the New York Yankees, Baltimore Orioles, and either the Texas Rangers or Oakland Athletics to all finish with the same record. This could have required the teams to play a complex set of multiple games to determine divisional and wild card winners, a situation which Jayson Stark described as potentially \"baseball's worst scheduling nightmare.\"\nHistory.\nThe first , held in 1946, decided the winner of the NL pennant between the St. Louis Cardinals and the Brooklyn Dodgers, who had finished the season tied at 96–58. The Cardinals won the series in two games and went on to win the 1946 World Series, one of four winners who have gone on to win the World Series. Three games have gone into extra innings: the decisive second game of the 1959 series, the 2007 Wild Card , and the 2009 game. The 2008 , a 1–0 victory for the White Sox, was the lowest scoring game, while the 2007 match-up with 17 total runs was the highest scoring. The Dodgers franchise has participated in six , twice while the team was based in Brooklyn and four times in Los Angeles, the most for any team. Dodger Stadium, Ebbets Field, Fenway Park, the Polo Grounds and Wrigley Field are the only venues which have hosted multiple games. Both games at the Polo Grounds came in the 1951 series.\nOne of the most famous moments in MLB history came in the final game of the 1951 National League series. Entering the bottom of the ninth inning the New York Giants were trailing the Dodgers 4–1. Al Dark and Don Mueller each singled to put runners on first and third base. Whitey Lockman hit a double, scoring Dark to make the game 4–2. Finally, Bobby Thomson hit a walk-off home run which has come to be known as the \"Shot Heard 'Round the World\" to give the Giants the 5–4 victory and the National League pennant. ESPN's \"SportsCentury\" ranked it as the second greatest game of the 20th century. In 1962, the first season of the NL expanded schedule to 162 games, the only best-of-three tie breaker in the 162 game season took place between the San Francisco Giants and Los Angeles Dodgers with the Giants winning 2–1. This was the longest regular season schedule ever played by 2 teams at 165 games, a record that will almost certainly never be matched. The 2000s saw three years of consecutive one-run tiebreaker games. The Rockies stormed back from a 2-run deficit in the 13th in 2007, winning 9–8 in a surprising run to the World Series that year. In 2008, a Jim Thome home run and a stellar performance by John Danks helped the White Sox edge out the Twins 1–0. The Twins ended up on the winning side the following year, tying the game in the 10th after going down a run and then walking off in the 12th inning to defeat the Tigers 6–5.\nIn 2018, two tiebreakers were played to conclude the season for the first time in MLB history. The NL West was decided between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Colorado Rockies, while the NL Central was decided between the Milwaukee Brewers and the Chicago Cubs. The Dodgers and Brewers, the winners of these games, advanced to the NLDS, while the losers played each other in the Wild Card game.\nDespite one team playing on their home field, tie-breakers have not favored the home team statistically, with the home team having gone 11–11 since the first tie-breaker game was played.\nStarting with the 2022 season, as part of the new Collective Bargaining Agreement to end the 2021–22 Major League Baseball lockout, MLB added a third wild card team in each league, expanding the playoffs to , and the tiebreaker game format was abolished. Ties will only be broken with a set of statistical prodecures.\nTie-breakers.\nWin–loss records by team.\nThis only lists teams who participated in at least one tiebreaker game, and lists them under their current identities.\n In cases where a series was played, win–loss total reflects outcome of the series, not individual games.\nTeam choices on tiebreaker designations.\nA tiebreaker involving three teams or more would have involved a more complex series of match-ups to determine what team(s) earned what playoff berth(s). This scenario never actually occurred but, on a few occasions, it was close enough that the teams involved selected tiebreaker designation in anticipation of such a scenario.\nThree-way tie for one wild card spot.\nWhile such a tie had never occurred, teams within range were requested to choose between designations A, B, and C in case. Team A hosted Team B. The winner would then host Team C, with the winner of that game getting the wild card spot.\nThree-way tie for two wild card spots.\nWhile such a tie had never occurred, teams within range were requested to choose between designations A, B, and C in case. Team A hosted Team B, with the winner awarded one spot. Team C would host the loser of the first game, with the winner getting the other spot.\nFour-way tie for two wild card spots.\nWhile such a tie had never occurred, teams within range were requested to choose between designations A, B, C, and D in case. Team A hosted Team B. Team C hosted Team D. The winners of each game would've been awarded a wild-card spot."

        "text": "The 2006 Giro d'Italia began on 6 May in Seraing in Belgium, and stage 11 occurred on 18 May in Pontedera. As is usually the case in a Grand Tour, the first half of the race was considerably easier than the second half – both rest days occurred before the halfway point, and there were no mountain stages or stages ending with climbs among the first eleven.\nThe Giro began with an individual time trial, which defending champion Paolo Savoldelli won to become the first race leader. After breakaways and the team time trial in stage 5 (the first on Italian soil) resulted in three other riders wearing the pink jersey, Ivan Basso took a lead he held all the way to the Giro's conclusion in Milan with his victory in stage 8.\nSprinter Alessandro Petacchi, who had won thirteen stages in the last two editions of the Giro, fractured his kneecap in stage 3 and was forced to abandon the Giro and miss the rest of the season.\nStage 1.\n6 May 2006 — Seraing (Belgium) (individual time trial)\nThe Giro began in Belgium with a short individual time trial. It was the first time the Giro had come to Belgium since 1973. The course included some climbing, with the second intermediate time check also awarding points to the mountains competition.\nA number of early riders posted provisional best times on the day. The first to stand up for any sustained length of time was Stefan Schumacher's 8'03\". That time held up against reigning world time trial champion Michael Rogers and other riders like José Rujano and Tom Danielson before José Enrique Gutiérrez bettered it by less than a second. Shortly afterward, Bradley McGee stopped the clock two seconds faster than Gutierrez. The only riders to follow McGee were the Giro's overall favorites and contenders. Danilo Di Luca had the best time at the first intermediate time check, but lost time as the ride wore on and finished in 8'09\". Former teammates Damiano Cunego and Gilberto Simoni, though neither of them renowned as particularly good time trialists, both finished in 8'16\", with Cunego milliseconds the better of the two. Ivan Basso turned in an 8'13\" ride to place himself better than Simoni and Cunego in the first general classification.\nWith only defending Giro champion Paolo Savoldelli left to leave the starthouse, McGee's 8'01\" was still best and it appeared that the Australian would get the first pink jersey. Savoldelli, however, set by far the best time at the intermediate time checks and was 11 seconds better than McGee at the finish, winning the stage and all four jerseys on the podiums afterward. Savoldelli was the only rider to finish the course in under eight minutes. McGee expressed disappointment after the stage that the last man had beaten him, but also recognized that Savoldelli had turned in the considerably better ride. For his part, Savoldelli was surprised by his victory, and felt poised to challenge for a third Giro victory.\nStage 1 result and general classification after stage 1\nStage 2.\n7 May 2006 — Mons (Belgium) to Charleroi Marcinelle (Belgium) \nThe first road race stage was flat and raced on relatively straight roads, with a very wide final . It was a simple course expected to produce a mass sprint finish.\nThe arrival site of Marcinelle demonstrated why the Giro had come to Belgium – 2006 marked the 50th anniversary of a mining accident there that killed 262 people, including 136 Italians.\nIntermittent rain fell throughout the day on all parts of the course. The maximum advantage attained by the four breakaway riders (Gabriele Missaglia, Beñat Albizuri, Mickaël Delage, and Arnaud Labbe) was 6'18\", and they took the intermediate sprint and the climb on offer on the stage. With to go, the time gap was reduced to three minutes. At this point, race leader Paolo Savoldelli's team gave up the pacemaking, as the teams of the sprinters were more invested in making a timely catch of the leading group. At the mark, the peloton was all together again, and and , working for Alessandro Petacchi and Robbie McEwen, respectively, alternately tried to take control of the race. Petacchi's last leadout man Alberto Ongarato did not maintain the pace that had been set before him in the race's final , leading to a chaotic sprint to the line. Petacchi started his sprint with to go, but McEwen, who had been holding his wheel in the last , came around him for the stage win. Olaf Pollack and Paolo Bettini also managed to out-sprint Petacchi, who was upset to finish just fourth. Savoldelli, celebrating his 33rd birthday, retained the race leadership.\nStage 3.\n8 May 2006 — Perwez (Belgium) to Namur (Belgium) \nAlthough the profile for this stage was quite flat, pre-race analysis expected that the stage would not favor sprinters like the previous stage had. The course included a cobbled climb by the Meuse River, on roads visited in La Flèche Wallonne, and another in the last to the finish line by the Citadel of Namur.\nIt took two hours for a breakaway group to form on this stage. After a move instigated by Moisés Aldape, he and Amaël Moinard, Markel Irizar, Raffaele Illiano formed the day's escape. The peloton was content to let this group get away for a while, affording them three minutes advantage in the after Aldape first attacked. organized the chase, working for their captain, classics specialist Paolo Bettini, who was thought to be a favorite for the stage. Their lead started to dissipate as individual tactics began on the day's second climb. Aldape was first to the line and took sufficient points to gain the green jersey. About from the finish, Dario Cioni and Alessandro Petacchi crashed at the back of the peloton, going about at the time. Petacchi got up and, with the help of his teammates, made it to the finish some 14 minutes after the stage winner. Though he said he felt better after the stage than he did immediately after the crash, tests after the stage revealed that he had fractured his left kneecap and had to abandon the race.\nThough the crash afforded the leading quartet a little more time, they were easily caught by to go. The rain, which had been falling lightly throughout the day, intensified in the stage's final kilometers. Between and to go, no team forced the pace, and rode a tempo to try to keep their leader Ivan Basso safe. A rider crashed with just over to go, splitting what had been the pink jersey group into two. Alberto Loddo was the first to try to attack for the stage win. José Luis Rubiera countered with \n to go and appeared poised for the win until Stefan Schumacher passed him a few hundred meters later, winning the stage and the pink jersey.\nStage 4.\n9 May 2006 — Wanze (Belgium) to Hotton (Belgium) \nThe last stage in Belgium was undulating, with several small rises in elevation. Included among them were two categorized climbs often included in the Ardennes classics.\nThe day's signature breakaway formed very quickly after the true beginning of the stage, which was expected given that the uphill stretches began almost immediately. Sandy Casar, Grischa Niermann, Patrick Calcagni, Jurgen Van de Walle, and Alessandro Bertolini slipped away and, thanks to a helpful tailwind, built up a 3'30\" advantage by the mark. Their eventual maximum advantage was just less than seven minutes. and led the chase. By to go, the break's lead was reduced to 20 seconds, and Niermann tried to solo in the rest of the way. Eventually, the riders were all together again, though the escape had allowed Casar to be first over the day's climbs and win enough points to take the green jersey from Moisés Aldape. led the peloton through the final kilometers – although they had lost their leader Alessandro Petacchi in the previous stage, they still had other strong sprinters on their squad, riders who would have normally been Petacchi's last leadout man. They set up the sprint with Mirco Lorenzetto in mind, but leader Robbie McEwen followed their wheels and timed his acceleration just right to take his second stage win of this Giro. Aside from three riders, the entire peloton finished the stage together, meaning the day's effect on the overall standings was virtually nil – the only change was Bettini's second-place time bonus moving him from 11th to 10th.\nStage 5.\n11 May 2006 — Piacenza to Cremona (team time trial)\nAfter the rest day and transfer to Italy, the fifth stage was a team time trial (TTT). A favorite discipline of second-year race director Angelo Zomegnan, this was the first TTT in the Giro in 17 years. The course was flat and favored powerful squads like and .\nThe dominance of the Lance Armstrong-led Discovery Channel team in recent years in TTT's in the Tour de France had had that race institute a rule limiting time losses in the general classification for individual riders finishing together. The Giro did not institute this rule, however, and only real time was taken on the stage. There was a slight tailwind blowing on the day, and the course was reduced in length slightly from the planned length of , which was expected to make for limited time gaps.\n, led by points classification leader Robbie McEwen, set the early time to beat, coming home in 38'05\" and bettering the times of and . The next team on the course was , who were composed of climbers and not time trialists and managed an 18th place ride with 39'22\". Shortly thereafter came and , who posted successive best times at the first intermediate time check. had the best time at the finish line, stopping the clock in 36'56\", leading to speculation over whether Jens Voigt would take the race leadership. Though was eight seconds off 's pace at the first time check and gradually faded further, they rode a very strong final and put the next pink jersey on their star time trialist Serhiy Honchar. They finished only one second worse than at the finish line.\n and were the last teams on the course. 's squad wasn't nearly as strong as it had been in the 2005 Tour de France when they were stage winners who handily defeated every team but , though they still managed third on the day with 37'25\". never stood much chance of retaining the jersey, though their sixth-place ride in 37'59\" was better than pre-stage expectations.\nStage 6.\n12 May 2006 — Busseto to Forlì \nThis stage was very flat, heading on straight roads southeast through the region of Emilia-Romagna. It was the first time the Giro had come to Forlì in 29 years, with a stage that stood to favor the sprinters.\nThough the peloton first seemed to want to keep Sergiy Matveyev, Christophe Edaleine, and Andoni Aranaga from breaking away after just , the trio fought through the counter-attacks and became the day's signature escape. Their biggest advantage of the day was 6'14\", at the intermediate sprint in Rio Saliceto. led the chase, with double stage winner Robbie McEwen in mind. The course's perfectly flat terrain meant that it was exceedingly unlikely that the break would stay away to the finish. joined the chase, and by to go the time gap was just 40 seconds. The peloton thus stood the risk of catching them too soon, which would leave open the possibility for counter-attacks when the catch occurred. The trio's lead grew a little for the next several kilometers until they were at last brought back with left in the stage. Several teams tried to control the field in the run in to the finish, with their various sprinters in mind. 's Tomas Vaitkus flew out of the main field with left, followed closely by McEwen and Olaf Pollack. Pollack later described that his primary leadout man André Korff had crashed about a kilometer earlier, which threw off his preparations for the sprint. Points classification leader McEwen was first over the line to claim his third stage win of the Giro, but the 12-second time bonus Pollack received made him the new race leader.\nStage 7.\n13 May 2006 — Cesena to Saltara \nStage 8.\n14 May 2006 — Civitanova Marche to Maielletta \nStage 9.\n15 May 2006 — Francavilla al Mare to Termoli \nStage 10.\n16 May 2006 — Termoli to Peschici \nStage 11.\n18 May 2006 — Pontedera (individual time trial)"

        "text": "The FIFA World Cup is an international association football competition contested by the men's national teams of the members of the \"Fédération Internationale de Football Association\" (FIFA), the sport's global governing body. It has been contested every four years since the first tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946, due to World War II.\nThe tournament consists of two parts, the qualification phase and the final phase (officially called the \"World Cup Finals\"). The qualification phase, which currently takes place over the three years preceding the finals, is used to determine which teams qualify for the finals. The current format of the finals involves 32 teams competing for the title, at venues within the host nation (or nations) over a period of about a month. The World Cup finals is the most widely viewed sporting event in the world, with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the final of the 2006 tournament.\nThe Indonesia national football team has only reached the FIFA World Cup finals once: the 1938 World Cup in France, where they competed under the name Dutch East Indies. The Dutch East Indies gained independence from the Netherlands and became known as Indonesia in 1945, and FIFA considers them to have inherited the record of the Dutch East Indies. The Dutch East Indies played their first World Cup finals match against Hungary in the round of 16 of the 1938 tournament, losing 6–0. The straight knockout format used at the time made it the only game the team played at the tournament. Thus, Indonesia is the sole record holder for the fewest matches played (1) at a World Cup, and one of several to have scored no goals.\nThe team tasted their first World Cup action as Indonesia in qualifying for the 1958 tournament. They got past China in the first round, but refused to play their next opponents Israel. The team did not take part in qualifying for the next three World Cups due to an unfavourable political situation – both internally and externally – before re-entering in 1974."

        "title": "Georgia men's national ice hockey team",
        "text": "The Georgian men's national ice hockey team () is the national men's ice hockey team of Georgia, and has been a member of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) since 8 May 2009. As of 2022, Georgia is ranked 43rd in the World Ranking. Georgia first played in the World Championships tournament in 2013, and remained at Division III level until winning at that level in 2018 and earning a promotion to Division II Group B, where they currently play.\nThough ice hockey was first introduced to Georgia in the 1960s, the sport was never very popular and there were long stretches when it was not played at all. In 2004 the Georgian Ice Hockey Federation was established, and a domestic league began in 2007, allowing for the development of the national team and its entry into international competition in 2010, playing their first competitive matches in 2012.\nHistory.\nSoviet Union.\nIce hockey was introduced in Georgia in the 1960s, part of a Soviet policy to introduce winter sports across the country. A trainer from Moscow, Valentin Zakharov, was sent to Georgia to train youth in the sport. As Tbilisi, the capital, had no rink, most of the initial exercises involved dry-land training. As the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic, Georgia played its first game in 1962 during the Winter Spartakiad which was held in Sverdlovsk, Soviet Union. Georgia played seven games, winning their matches against the Kirghiz SSR and the Armenian SSR, while losing the remaining games to the Lithuanian SSR twice, the Kazakh SSR, the Estonian SSR and the Latvian SSR.\nZakharov left Georgia in 1966, and hockey effectively ended in Georgia. It was revived in 1978 by one of Zakharov's students, Nodar Donadze, who established a club in Tbilisi. This saw some further developments, with one player, goaltender Kote Bakhutashvili, invited to join the youth development team of CSKA Moscow, the dominant team in the Soviet league, in the late 1980s; however it was ultimately ended in 1987. As ice hockey was not popular in Georgia, an ice rink built in Tbilisi was demolished in the post-Soviet era.\nModern era.\nTwo students of Donadze, Denis Davidov and Lasha Tsagareishvili, established the Georgian Ice Hockey Federation in 2004. A national league was started in 2007. In 2009 Georgia joined the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) as an associate member. Shortly after being accepted into the IIHF both Davidov and Tsagareishvili, along with four others (including the president of the Ice Hockey Federation of Armenia) were killed in a car accident in Turkey, forcing the Georgian Ice Hockey Federation to delay plans to start a national team.\nGeorgia first played an international match in 2010, when they travelled to Yerevan, Armenia, which was hosting the 2010 Division III World Championship. They played exhibition games against South Africa and Armenia, losing 8–1 and 22–1, respectively. Georgia made their debut in the World Championship in 2012, playing in the 2013 Division III Qualification tournament held in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. They lost all three games, being outscored 28 goals to one (Gocha Jeiranashvili scored the lone goal, Georgia's first in IIHF play, in the final game against the United Arab Emirates), and failed to qualify for the Division III tournament. The following year Georgia was placed in Division III, as several teams did not participate. They scored three goals and gave up seventy-eight in the five games, all losses. The 2015 Division III tournament saw Georgia record their first win, against Bosnia and Herzegovina, followed by an overtime victory against the United Arab Emirates. The fourth-place finish was considered a great success, and credited to new players: Vitali Dumbadze and Dimitri Smetanin scored 17 of Georgia's 20 goals, while Andrei Ilienko was named the top goaltender of the tournament.\nIn October 2015 Georgia participated in the first game of the 2018 Winter Olympic qualification tournament, against Bulgaria, losing the match 9–1. Funding from the Georgian government came for the first time in 2015; prior to that the players and management had to pay all expenses. In the 2016 Division III tournament, they finished second after winning four games out of five, only losing to Turkey 5–4, and having the tournament's leading scorer, Boris Kochkin (who had 10 goals and 9 assists). However, all their matches were later nullified and the results recorded as 5–0 forfeits due to Georgia's use of ineligible players. At the 2017 Division III tournament they placed third, winning three of their five games. Five Georgians placed in the top ten scorers, including Artem Kozyulin in first with 25 points (13 goals and 12 assists), while Artem Kurbatov was named the tournament's best defeceman. In the 2018 Division III tournament, they finished first after winning four games out of five, losing one game to South Africa 4–2. Five of the top ten scorers in the tournament were from the Georgian team, including Aleksandr Zhuzhunashvili, who led the tournament in goals (10), assists (9), and points (19), and was named the best forward. For the first time, Georgia earned promotion to Division IIB for 2019. The result was attributed to a policy of naturalization: three of the top five scorers had Russian or Ukrainian surnames, while all five learned hockey outside of Georgia. The result had Georgia place 40th in the IIHF World Ranking, their highest spot to date."

        "text": "The following is a list of Major League Baseball players born in European nations.\nAustria.\nAustria, officially the Republic of Austria, is a landlocked country in Central Europe.\nAustrian Empire.\nThe Austrian Empire was a modern era successor empire centered on what is today's Austria and which officially lasted from 1804 to 1867.\nAustria-Hungary.\nAustria-Hungary was a monarchic union between the crowns of the Austrian Empire and the Kingdom of Hungary in Central Europe. The union was a result of the \"Ausgleich\" or Compromise of 1867, under which the Austrian House of Habsburg agreed to share power with the separate Hungarian government, dividing the territory of the former Austrian Empire between them. The Dual Monarchy had existed for 51 years when it dissolved on October 31, 1918 following military defeat in the First World War.\nRepublic of Austria.\nThe First Austrian Republic was established in 1919. In the 1938 Anschluss, Austria was occupied and annexed by Nazi Germany. This lasted until the end of World War II in 1945, after which Austria was occupied by the Allies and its former democratic constitution was restored. In 1955, the Austrian State Treaty re-established Austria as a sovereign state, ending the occupation.\nBelgium.\nBelgium, officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a state in Western Europe. The 1830 Belgian Revolution led to the establishment of an independent, Belgium under a provisional government and a national congress. Since the installation of Leopold I as king in 1831, Belgium has been a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy.\nDenmark.\nDenmark, officially the Kingdom of Denmark together with Greenland and the Faroe Islands, is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe.\nFinland.\nGrand Duchy of Finland.\nThe Grand Duchy of Finland was the predecessor state of modern Finland. It existed between 1809 and 1917 as an autonomous part of the Russian Empire and was ruled by the Russian Emperor as Grand Duke.\nFrance.\nFrance, officially the French Republic, is a sovereign country in Western Europe that extends from the Mediterranean to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean.\nFrench Second Republic.\nThe French Second Republic was the republican government of France between the 1848 Revolution and the 1851 coup by Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte which initiated the Second Empire.\nSecond French Empire.\nThe Second French Empire was the Imperial Bonapartist regime of Napoleon III from 1852 to 1870, between the Second Republic and the Third Republic, in France.\nFrench Third Republic.\nThe French Third Republic was France from 1870, when the Second French Empire collapsed, to 1940, when France's defeat by Nazi Germany led to the Vichy France government. Vichy was replaced by the French Fourth Republic.\nFrench Fourth Republic.\nThe French Fourth Republic was the republican government of France between 1946 and 1958, governed by the fourth republican constitution. France adopted the constitution of the Fourth Republic on 13 October 1946.\nFrench Fifth Republic.\nThe Fifth Republic is the fifth and current republican constitution of France, introduced on 4 October 1958. The Fifth Republic emerged from the collapse of the French Fourth Republic, replacing the prior parliamentary government with a semi-presidential system.\nGermany.\nGerman Confederation.\nThe German Confederation was the association of Central European states created by the Congress of Vienna in 1815 to serve as the successor to the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation, which had been abolished in 1806. The dispute between the two dominant member states of the confederation, Austria and Prussia, over which of the two had the inherent right to rule German lands ended in favor of Prussia after the Austro-Prussian War in 1866, and the collapse of the confederation. This resulted in the creation of the North German Confederation, with a number of south German states remaining independent, although allied first with Austria (until 1867) and subsequently with Prussia (until 1871), after which they became a part of the new nation of Germany.\nGerman Empire.\nThe German Empire refers to Germany from the unification of Germany and proclamation of Wilhelm I as German Emperor on 18 January 1871 to 1918, when it became a federal republic after defeat in World War I and the abdication of Wilhelm II (9 November 1918).\nSoviet Zone of Germany.\nThe Soviet Occupation Zone was the area of central Germany occupied by the Soviet Union from 1945 on, at the end of World War II. On 7 October 1949 the German Democratic Republic, which became commonly referred to as East Germany, was established in the Soviet Occupation Zone.\nWest Germany.\nWest Germany is the common English name for the Federal Republic of Germany or FRG in the period between its creation in May 1949 to German reunification on 3 October 1990. During this period, the NATO-aligned West Germany and the socialist East Germany were divided by the Inner German border. This situation ended when East Germany was dissolved and its five states joined the ten states of the Federal Republic of Germany along with the reunified city-state of Berlin.\nGermany.\nGermany is the English short name for the Federal Republic of Germany, the enlarged continuation of West Germany following German reunification in 1990.\nGreece.\nKingdom of Greece.\nThe Kingdom of Greece was a state established in 1832 at the Convention of London by the Great Powers (the United Kingdom, France and the Russian Empire). It was internationally recognized by the Treaty of Constantinople, where it also secured full independence from the Ottoman Empire.

The EuroLeague is the top-tier level European-wide men's professional club basketball league in Europe. The award has existed and been awarded by the EuroLeague since the 2004–05 season. It was originally awarded for play that included the league's regular season, top 16 stage, and playoffs, and currently is awarded for play that includes the regular season and playoffs, as the top 16 stage was eliminated.\nSo far, Anthony Parker is the only player who has won the award twice. Other than Parker, all the other winners of the award have been Europeans, with Sasha Vezenkov being the most recent winner of the award for 2023.\nSelection criteria.\nThe EuroLeague MVP award is the first and only full season MVP award that is voted on and given by the EuroLeague. Previous awards like the EuroLeague Regular Season and Top 16 MVP awards were only for individual phases of the season, with the original regular season MVP award being based on the PIR stat, rather than on an actual voting process. When the EuroLeague Full Season MVP award was created, those previous awards were phased out altogether, and were replaced by the EuroLeague MVP of the Month award.\nThe EuroLeague MVP award is based on a voting process. Currently, online fan voting represents 25% of the vote total for the MVP award, while media voting accounts for the remaining 75%. Team success is unofficially paramount during the selection process. Since established, the award has never gone to a player whose team did not reach the EuroLeague Final Four. It is nevertheless theoretically possible for that to occur in the future, as no rule stands against it. For example, players whose teams only made it to the top 16 stage of the competition (when it existed in the past), were nominated into the online fan voting every year, and some were selected to the All-EuroLeague First Team.\nHistory.\nStarting with the 2004–05 season, the EuroLeague officially began giving out its Full Season MVP award for the first time. Unlike the previous EuroLeague Regular Season and Top 16 MVP awards, this award encompasses the full season of EuroLeague, up until the EuroLeague Final Four stage. Also, rather than being based on the PIR statistical formula, like the earlier EuroLeague Regular Season MVP award, the Full Season MVP award is based on a combination of online voting by fans and the media. The online fan vote comprises 25% of the vote total, while the media vote encompasses 75% of the vote total.\nWinners.\nList.\nNotes:"

Because of this, it is still possible for a player to lead the league in scoring, but not win the Alphonso Ford Trophy. This happened during the 2006–07 season, when Igor Rakočević won the Alphonso Ford Trophy, but Juan Carlos Navarro was the league's top scorer.\nNavarro had the highest full season scoring average in the EuroLeague, at 16.8 points per game, but did not win the Alphonso Ford Trophy, because he did not have the highest scoring average prior to the start of the EuroLeague Final Four. So instead, Rakočević was given the trophy, despite actually finishing second in the full season scoring statistical category, with an average of 16.2 points per game.\nNotes:"

        "title": "Chinese Basketball Alliance",
        "text": "The Chinese Basketball Alliance (; CBA) was a men's professional basketball league in Taiwan that existed from 1995 to 1999. Also abbreviated as \"CBA\", the defunct organization based in Taiwan was distinct from the Chinese Basketball Association of the People's Republic of China (PRC) and was also not to be confused with the Continental Basketball Association of the United States. In this article, \"CBA\" refers to the first organization if not otherwise specified.\nOverview of organizational history.\nFounded in 1994 with four champion teams from Taiwan's amateur Division A conference (甲組聯賽), the CBA was Taiwan's second professional sports league next to the Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL), and was among the earliest professional basketball leagues in Asia. Following the regnal year tradition in East Asia, the CBA officially named its first season, 1994–1995, the \"CBA Inaugural Year\" (職籃元年), the 1995-1996 season the \"CBA Second Year\", and so forth. Four seasons were completed before the game was suddenly halted in 1999 in the middle of an unfinished fifth due to financial difficulties.\nHaving had survived the 1995-1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis, the CBA was viciously affected by the repercussions of the Asian Financial Crisis two years later. Decreased attendance aside, a factor that had a direct bearing on the sudden close down of the CBA was the dispute between the organization and its television partner, the Eastern Broadcasting Co., Ltd. (東森電視; ETTV), over the proper level of the broadcasting royalties. Shortly after the latter ceased to make royalty payments as contracted, the CBA ran out of financial means to sustain its operating budget and had to stop its operations.\nParticipating clubs and champions.\nSince its second season, the CBA had expanded to include a total of six clubs. They were: Yulon Dinos (裕隆恐龍), Hung Kuo Elephants (宏國象), Tera/Kaohsiung Mars (泰瑞/高雄戰神), LUCKIPar() (幸福豹) in addition to the incoming Hung Fu Rams (宏福公羊) and Chung-Hsing/Dacin Tigers (中興/達欣虎). The history of the CBA was marked by a \"Hung Kuo dynasty\" (宏國王朝) where the Elephants won three consecutive championships. The champion team and runner-up of each year are listed below:\nCaught in the economic turbulence of the late 1990s, the corporate owners/sponsors of various CBA clubs decided to withdraw from professional sports. Consequently, the Hung Kuo, Mars, LUCKIPar, and Hung Fu teams came under the danger of disbandment around the same period when the CBA closed down. At the turn of the 20th century, only two out of the six clubs that had participated in the CBA, namely, Yulon and Dacin, had managed to survive with the original organizations. Whereas the Mars was allowed to kept its roster and its name under new ownership by the Broadcasting Corporation of China, most of the original Hung Kuo Elephants were able to continue playing together as the Sina Lions (新浪獅) after their new corporate owner, Sina.com. These four clubs subsequently became founding members of the Super Basketball League (SBL) when the semi-professional league was created in 2003. Many have viewed this new league as the successor body to the CBA.\nLess fortunate, the LUCKIPar and Hung Fu teams disappeared permanently.\nPolicy and rules on imported players.\nThe CBA distinguished the origin of a player as an array of height and playing chance limitations would be applied to imported players—the so-called \"yáng jiàng\" (洋將; literally, \"commanders/warriors that come through the sea\") -- but not to local players (本土球員). In implementing this, however, players with \"Chinese consanguinity\" (華裔球員) -- however vague such definition was—could be regarded as if they were local upon consensus among all member clubs. Such exemptions had allowed a number of players from mainland China, Hong Kong, and the United States to play without height and number limitations.\nInitially, each team was allowed to register 3 non-Chinese foreign players and put up to 2 of them onto the court. No height limitations were in place in the first three seasons. Beginning from the CBA Fourth Year, however, non-Chinese imports were divided into the \"bigger\" and the \"smaller\" categories by height. Foreign players who were 201 cm (6'7\") or taller were regarded as \"big\", and only one such player would be allowed to play on the court for a team. In the meantime, no more foreign players 208 cm (6'10\") or taller could be signed—although in previous seasons several seven-footers had made their appearances in the game. This was a response to some watchers' complaint that the league was dominated by foreign players, especially by those oversized imports from inside the paint. In the 1990s, native Taiwanese players who were two metres or taller were rare, and, as reflected in the statistics, local players had rarely turned out to be a leading rebounder or shot-blocker on a CBA team."

It features an 18-hole course designed by Donald Ross in 1926, and re-designed by Arnold Palmer Company in 2004. Thirteen of the original holes and the clubhouse survive, though recent renovations have been done to the entryway.\nNotable tournaments.\n1930 Southeastern Open\nBobby Jones began his famous 1930 Grand Slam of Golf in 1930 with a win in the Southeastern Open, which was played with two rounds on the Augusta Country Club and two at Forest Hills. He fired a third-round 69 and final-round 71 to clinch his first major of the year by 13 strokes over Horton Jones, and subsequently went on to have a banner year on tour by sweeping the four majors in the same calendar year.\n3M Augusta Invitational\nCalled the Insperity Augusta State Invitational and the Augusta State Invitational in the past, Forest Hills has hosted all but three editions of Augusta University's men's golf tournament since 1979. It has featured players such as Phil Mickelson, Davis Love III, Dustin Johnson, Justin Leonard, and Charles Howell III. It rates as one of the top tournaments in the nation, drawing 13 top-50 teams in 2013 - including then-No. 1 Texas - and eight of the final top 50 in 2012.\nAU has won the tournament 13 times, with no other team securing more than the University of North Carolina's three."

The stage began on July 2, 1994, and ended with the final at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, on July 17, 1994.\nSixteen teams advanced to the knockout stage to compete in a single-elimination style tournament: The top two teams from each of the six groups, as well as the best four third-placed teams. In the round of 16, the four third-placed teams played against four of the group winners from group A-D, with the remaining two group winners from group E and F taking on two of the group runners-up; the remaining four runners-up were paired off against each other. The winners of the eight round of 16 matches were then paired together in the quarterfinals, the winners of which played against each other in the semifinals.\nThe ties in each round were played over a single match; in the event that scores were level after 90 minutes, the teams would play an additional 30 minutes of extra time, divided into two 15-minute halves, to determine the winner. If the scores remained level after extra time, the teams would contest a penalty shootout.\nA third place match was also held on the day before the final, between the two losing teams of the semifinals.\nQualified teams.\nThe top two placed teams from each of the six groups, plus the four best-placed third teams, qualified for the knockout stage.\nBased on group results, the matches would be the following in Round of 16:\nThe pairings for matches 1, 4, 6 and 7 depend on who the best third places are that qualify for the round of 16. The following table published in Section 28 of the tournament regulations, shows the different options to define the rivals of the winners of groups A, B, C and D.\nBracket.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nRound of 16.\nSaudi Arabia vs Sweden.\nA quick goal by Dahlin in the first half and two second half goals by K. Andersson saw Sweden go through to the quarterfinals. The Saudi players could answer with just one goal scored by Al-Ghesheyan 5 minutes from the end.\nRomania vs Argentina.\nTwo quick goals by Dumitrescu and one more by Hagi in the second half sealed the victory for Romanians. After Batistuta's penalty kick and Balbo's rebound Argentina attacked desperately but couldn't score for the third time.\nBrazil vs United States.\nThis was the third time that Brazil defeated the host nation of tournament, after Sweden in 1958 and Chile in 1962 (coincidentally, on these three occasions Brazil became world champion).\nSince the kick off, Brazil set the pace, controlling ball possession and playing it on United States field. Left-back Leonardo was the main source of attacking, but at last minute of the first half, on a ball disput just by sideline, he threw his elbow on Tab Ramos' jaw, broking it, knocking the North American down and being send off. Later, Leonardo would be expelled out of the World Cup.\nOn the second half, Carlos Alberto Parreira put right-back Cafu on the left-back, benching Zinho. Even with one man down, Brazil kept the pace. At 72th minute, Romário recovery a ball possession on midfield, ran to opposite box and delivered it to Bebeto, who shoot just between Tony Meola and the post, giving Brazil the lead and the victory.\nThird place playoff.\n&lt;section begin=Third /&gt;&lt;section end=Third /&gt;"
