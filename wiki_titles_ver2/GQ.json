        "title": "1927–28 Clarkson Golden Knights men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1927–28 Clarkson Golden Knights men's ice hockey season was the 8th season of play for the program. The team was coached by Gordon Croskery in his 5th season.\nSeason.\nAfter a fantastic season the year before, Clarkson saw a chance to prove how good it was and scheduled several games against the upper echelon of college hockey. This time the team got an early start on their season and began practicing just after Thanksgiving. The full month gave professor Croskery the opportunity to get the new players up to speed, but it was the returning crop that would prove vital for the team's success.\nClarkson opened at home against Victoria College. Three consecutive days of warm weather left the ice in poor shape but the teams fought through the conditions. \"Light Horse Harry\" Heintzman opened the scoring in the first but Tech was unable to add to the score in regulation. Fortunately, their defense was as reliable as it had been the year before and the Knights took the game into overtime. Near the end of the 10-minute session, MacCartney netted the winning goal and sent the Green and Gold faithful home happy. The team headed down to West Point for the second game and the result was much the same; Clarkson scored early and then relied on the twin towers of Wayland and MacCartney on the back end to shut down the opposing offense. It was only a strong game from the Army netminder, Browning, that prevented the score from being lopsided.\nThe third game of the season was the first big test for the program, as they met one of the 'Big Four' in Princeton. While the Tigers hadn't been champions in over a decade, the team was still formidable and got out to an early lead. Down 2–4 after 20 minutes, Clarkson bore down in the third and closed off Princeton's avenue of attack. On the offensive side, Fred Dion became an instant star; he scored twice in the first, three times in the second and then, after Princeton had ties the game early in the third, netted the final three goals to set a program record with 8 markers in the match. Tech kept rolling for the remainder of the month. They won their next four games, all against college teams, by a combined score of 21–1 with Dion earning two more hat-tricks.\nWhen the team played host to Syracuse in early February, Clarkson ran their winning streak to 17 games and did so in style. Tech dominated the visitors through the entire game and set new program records for both goals scored (14) and margin of victory (+13). The game was so one-sided that Burke, who was starting at Left Wing in place of the absent Bill Guest, got enough ice time to score 5 goals. The winning streak came to an end the following week when Middlebury broke through Tech's vaunted defense and two of Clarkson's goals were waved off by the referee.\nClarkson ended the year with a trip downstate and took their frustrations out on their opponents. Dion recorded his 5th hat-trick of the season against Colgate and the whole team turned in a masterful performance against Hamilton. The win marked Tech's first victory over the Continentals in five attempts and gave the Knights the (unofficial) New York state championship.\nDion's individual performance over the season, particularly in the game against Princeton, earn him a spot on the All-American team, the first Clarkson player so honored.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The Republic of China, commonly known as \"Taiwan\", competed as Chinese Taipei at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, China from 4 to 20 February 2022. Because of the political status of Taiwan and the One-China policy, the ROC national symbols will not be used as stipulated in the Nagoya Resolution in 1979 forcing the ROC athletes to compete under the Chinese Taipei moniker since 1984.\nHuang Yu-ting and Ho Ping-jui were the country's flagbearers during the opening ceremony. Meanwhile alpine skier Lee Wen-yi was the flagbearer during the closing ceremony.\nBackground.\nSince the end of the Chinese Civil War, the Kuomintang-ruled Republic of China has retained control of only Taiwan, formerly a Qing prefecture that was previously under Japanese colonial rule from 1895 to 1945, and a few other minor islands. When international recognition shifted to the Chinese Communist Party's People's Republic of China in the 1970s and under the PRC's One-China principle, the only way the ROC could participate in international organizations was under a name acceptable to the PRC. Nevertheless, the ROC was allowed to compete under that name at the 1972 Winter Olympics and the 1976 Winter Olympics.\nThe ROC boycotted the Olympics in 1976 and 1980 after not being allowed to compete under the name \"Republic of China.\" Chinese Taipei accepted the Nagoya Resolution in 1981 and first officially participated in the Olympics at the 1984 Winter Olympics. Chinese Taipei has sent delegations to every Winter Olympic Games since, making Turin their seventh appearance at a Winter Olympics. Their delegation to Turin consisted of a single competitor in luge, Ma Chih-hung. He was accompanied to Turin by coaches and teammates to act as logistical support. Ma was the flag bearer for the opening ceremony while a volunteer carried the flag for the closing ceremony.\nThe Chinese Taipei team announced in January 2022 that its athletes would not partake in the opening or closing ceremonies, citing COVID-19 pandemic measures and delayed flights. The decision was reached as a PRC official wrongly labelled the ROC as \"Taipei, China\". After the International Olympic Committee issued a statement confirming that all teams must send personnel to participate in the opening and closing ceremonies, the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee declared that the ROC would attend both ceremonies. In turn, the Taiwan Association for Human Rights and other organizations protested the CTOC's decision to attend the ceremony, opining that the ROC's attendance was an endorsement of PRC's poor human rights record.\nCompetitors.\nThe following is the list of number of competitors participating at the Games per sport/discipline.\nAlpine skiing.\nChinese Taipei qualified one male and one female alpine skier.\nLuge.\nBased on the results during the 2021–22 Luge World Cup season, Chinese Taipei qualified 1 sled in the women's singles.\nSpeed skating.\nChinese Taipei qualified one female speed skater."

It was the 12th ranking event of the 2021–22 snooker season, and the 31st edition of the Welsh Open, first held in 1992. It was the seventh of eight tournaments in the season's European Series, and the fourth and final event of the Home Nations Series. The tournament was broadcast by BBC Cymru Wales, BBC Online, BBC Red Button, Quest and Eurosport domestically.\nJordan Brown was the defending champion, having defeated Ronnie O'Sullivan 9–8 in the final of the 2021 event. However, Brown lost 3–4 in his qualifying match against Mitchell Mann. Joe Perry defeated Judd Trump 9–5 in the final to capture his first Welsh Open title and the second ranking title of his career. Aged 47 years and 205 days, Perry became the oldest player to win a ranking tournament since Ray Reardon, who was 50 years and 14 days old when he won the 1982 Professional Players Tournament. However, Mark Williams surpassed Perry the following season by winning the 2023 British Open aged 48 years and 194 days. There were 52 century breaks made during the main venue stage of the event; the highest was a 142, made by Michael White in the second round.\nFormat.\nThe Welsh Open began as a ranking tournament in 1992, when it was held at the Newport Centre in Newport. The 2022 tournament, the 31st edition, took place at the International Convention Centre Wales at the Celtic Manor Resort in Newport, Wales, between 28 February and 6 March. Organised by the World Snooker Tour, it was the 12th ranking tournament of the 2021–22 snooker season, following the European Masters and preceding the Turkish Masters. It was the seventh of eight events in the European Series and the fourth and final event of the Home Nations Series.\nThe defending Welsh Open champion was Jordan Brown, who won the 2021 final with a 9–8 victory over Ronnie O'Sullivan. For the 2022 event, all matches were the best of seven until the quarter-finals, which were the best of nine; the semi-finals were the best of 11. The final was played over two , as the best of 17 frames. The event was sponsored by sports betting company BetVictor, and broadcast locally by BBC Cymru Wales. It was broadcast by BBC Online, BBC Red Button, and Quest in the United Kingdom; Eurosport in Europe; CCTV5, Youku, Zhibo.tv and Migu in China; Now TV in Hong Kong; True Sport in Thailand; Sky Sports in New Zealand; DAZN in Canada; and Astrosport in Malaysia. In all other locations it was broadcast by Matchroom Sport.\nPrize fund.\nThe event's total prize fund was £405,000, with the winner receiving £70,000. The player accumulating the highest amount of prize money over the eight European Series events received a bonus of £150,000. The breakdown of prize money is shown below:\nSummary.\nEarly rounds.\n\"Held-over\" qualifying matches (matches played at the main venue, rather than a qualifying arena) and rounds of 64 and 32 were played from 28 February to 3 March.

However, Walden made an 83 break to win 4–3.\nCarter won four frames in a row to defeat Scott Donaldson 4–2, Zhang beat Matthew Stevens by the same scoreline, and Hossein Vafaei defeated Day in a deciding frame. Perry defeated Wilson 4–1, Neil Robertson beat Woollaston by the same scoreline, and Jack Lisowski whitewashed amateur player Michael White 4–0. The losses by Stevens, Day, and White meant that no Welsh player advanced beyond the round of 16.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe quarter-finals were played on 4 March as the best of nine frames. In the afternoon , Carter played Lisowski while Neil Robertson faced Trump. The first four frames between Carter and Lisowski were shared, but Carter won the fifth and sixth frames with breaks of 86 and 53 to lead 4–2. However, Carter did not score another point in the match. Lisowski won a scrappy seventh frame before making an 82 break in the eighth and a total clearance of 135 in the decider to win the match 5–4 and reach his first ranking event semi-final of the season. \"It was probably one of my biggest buzzes since I’ve been a pro. Everything started going in, I can't even remember the break at the end,\" said Lisowski afterward. O'Sullivan, working as a pundit for Eurosport, stated that Lisowski would win tournaments if he played similarly more often.\nTrump won a scrappy 25-minute opening frame against Robertson, but a lax safety shot from Trump in the second gave Robertson an opportunity to draw level with a 95 break. Robertson required foul shots from his opponent in the third frame, but Trump repeatedly escaped each time Robertson laid a snooker and eventually snookered Robertson back; Robertson conceded the frame after he failed to escape. Trump won the fourth frame with a break of 60 and won the fifth frame to lead 4–1. Robertson, however, won both the sixth and seventh frames and had an opportunity to draw level in the eighth, but missed an easy black, allowing Trump to win the match 5–3 and reach his first ranking semi-final of the season. Robertson stated afterward that the sudden death of Australian cricket player Shane Warne, a childhood idol, had left him in tears before the match and had affected his performance on the table: \"I couldn't concentrate, couldn't think properly, couldn't do anything.\"\nIn the evening, Zhang faced Vafaei and Walden played Perry. Zhang made a century break in the opening frame and won three of the next four frames to lead 4–1. Vafaei, however, won four frames in a row with breaks of 68, 58, 63 and 96 to win the match 5–4 and reach the fifth ranking semi-final of his career. \"It was unbelievable. This is one of the tastiest comebacks I’ve ever had in my life,\" stated Vafaei afterward. He added that winning the Shoot Out earlier in the season had given him the self-belief that he could win. Walden made two breaks of 125, but only won two frames as Perry won the match 5–2 with breaks including a 118 and a 51 to reach his first ranking semi-final since 2019. Perry cited a match he won over Lee Walker at the Turkish Masters qualifying event where he had played well as a catalyst for his change in form and increase in confidence.\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-finals were played on 5 March as the best of 11 frames. Facing Trump in the afternoon session, Vafaei started strongly, taking a 3–1 lead with breaks of 94 and 85, but Trump claimed the fifth and then won the sixth on the black to draw level at 3–3. Vafaei moved two frames ahead again at 5–3, but Trump made breaks of 66 and 121 to force a deciding frame, which he won to defeat Vafaei 6–5. Trump said that Vafaei would be \"disappointed\", that \"he was the better player and his safety was brilliant. Every time I came to the table I seemed to be in trouble and his potting was better than mine.\"\nThe second semi-final between Perry and Lisowski also went to a deciding frame. Perry won the first three frames and came close to winning the fourth, but he missed a straightforward pot, which let Lisowski win the frame and go to the interval trailing 1–3. Lisowski's attempt at a maximum break in the fifth frame ended when he missed the ninth red after potting eight reds and eight blacks, but he won the frame, reducing Perry's lead to one. Good safety play and a break of 68 gave Perry the sixth frame, Lisowski responded with a 69 to win the seventh, and Perry won the eighth to move one frame from victory at 5–3. However, Lisowski took the ninth with a 71 break after Perry missed a black off the spot, and then made a 123 break in the tenth to take the match to a decider. Both players had opportunities, but Perry prevailed in a key safety exchange to win the frame and match. It was Perry's 16th win in a final-frame decider at the Welsh Open, more than any other player in the history of the event. Perry stated afterward that he had been suffering from a bad headache during the match that at one point made it difficult to see the balls clearly, calling it \"the worst I've ever felt in a game of snooker.\"\nFinal.\nTrump and Perry contested the final on 6 March as a best-of-17-frame match, held over two sessions. It was the sixth ranking final of Perry's professional career, and his first appearance in a ranking final since 2018. It was Trump's 34th ranking final, but his first of the 2021–22 season. Perry appeared in his first Welsh Open final, while Trump had previously been runner-up in 2017 when he lost the final 8–9 to Bingham. Prior to the final, Trump had beaten Perry 9 times in their 12 encounters.\nTrump made a break of 60 in the opener, but Perry recovered to contest the frame on the final black. After Trump played a safety shot that left the black on the , Perry won the frame with a long double into the bottom right corner pocket. Trump took the second with a break of 45. Perry won the third with a 59, but missed a red with the rest in the fourth, allowing Trump to tie the scores at 2–2 at the midsession interval. Trump won the fifth frame after Perry missed a straightforward , but Perry won the next frame. After Perry missed a black in the seventh, Trump won it with a 73 break, his highest of the match. Perry won a scrappy eighth frame after Trump missed a close-range shot on a straight pink, tying the scores at 4–4 after the afternoon session.\nIn the ninth frame, the first of the evening session, Perry made a 108 break, the only century of the final. Trump won a 28-minute 10th frame to level at 5–5, but Perry made two half-centuries in the 11th and then a 68 in the 12th to open up a two-frame lead at the midsession interval. Trump took the lead in the 13th frame but played a lax safety shot, giving Perry the opportunity to clear the table and win the frame. Perry went on to make a break of 70 in the 14th, forcing Trump to lay snookers, but he was unable to obtain any foul points. Perry won the final 9–5, capturing his first Welsh Open title and second-ranking title. He called the win \"the absolute highlight of my career by a country mile\", while Trump said that Perry was \"the best player over the week and thoroughly deserved to win\". Aged 47 years and 205 days, Perry became the second-oldest player in professional snooker history to win a ranking title, behind Ray Reardon, who won the 1982 Professional Players Tournament aged 50 years and 14 days. Perry's achievement was surpassed the following season by Williams, who won the 2023 British Open aged 48 years and 194 days, making Perry the third-oldest ranking event winner. The win took Perry from 42nd to 23rd in the world rankings.\nMain draw.\nBelow is the main draw for the event. Numbers in brackets denote seeded players.

The site is known for its beauty and is covered by the Dutch national 'Natural Beauty Act' (Natuurschoonwet).\nHistory.\n1950s–1960s.\nThe Noord-Nederlandse Golf &amp; Country Club was founded in 1950. It was the first Dutch golf club to be established after World War II. From, members and guest played in a field next to Eelde Airport, zoned and soon needed for the airport's development. Founding chairman was Syb Nijhoff. Kees Poll led the physical construction of the temporary golf course in Eelde.\nIn 1952 Willem Rost Onnes sold his country estate De Poll near Glimmen to the golf club. These 60 hectares are bordered on the east by two nature reserves: 'Westerlanden' and 'Besloten Venen', and on the west by the Drentsche Aa and the Meppel–Groningen railway.\nThe course, initially 9 holes, on the De Poll estate was designed by Sir Guy Colin Campbell and opened in 1954. This took up 42 ha. The golf course was opened in 1954 by the Queen's Commissioner Edzo Hommo Ebels. The house of Rost Onnes was transformed into the new clubhouse of the golf club. In 1957, Nijhoff was replaced as chairman.\nSince 1960, NNG&amp;CC organizes the annual Tromp Cup. The Tromp Cup later also became the Dutch Junior Championship Stroke Play.\n1970s–1980s.\nDuring the 1977 Dutch train hijacking at De Punt, a command post was set up in the clubhouse, where 40 soldiers and marines camped.\nIn 1984 the estate was expanded by 13 hectares, on which the golf course was expanded to 18 holes, designed by architect Frank Pennink. During construction, a piece of forest with remainders of a pingo was purchased in 1986. During the expansion of the new holes, 3 hectares of coniferous forest were converted into deciduous forest and another 5 hectares of deciduous forest were planted. The new golf course was opened in 1987 by the Queen's Commissioner Henk Vonhoff. The opening was supposed to be by the Queen's husband, Prince Bernhard, who canceled last moment.\n1990s–present.\nIn 1991 the clubhouse was expanded. In 1992 another 3.3 ha was purchased from a neighbor, after which the golf course was optimized until 1998 according to a design by architect Donald Steel. The holes are located in woods and on some meadows and part of the course is located in a park landscape with many rhododendrons.\nDue to the popularity of the course, in 2006 there was a minimum handicap requirement of 30 in the weekends.\nIn the 2009 Tromp Cup, Reinier Saxton's track record of 67 was lowered to 66 by the winner, Willem Vork."

The team was coached by Ray Marchand in his 4th season.\nSeason.\nWith more than half of the previous year's team having graduated, coach Marchand had his work cut out for him in rebuilding the team. With 12 games on the schedule, Army was hoping to improve upon their poor record from '26, however, the weather was particularly harsh this season. High temperatures and inclement conditions, including snow, rain and hail, ruined what could have been a decent season for the Cadets. In the end, Army had to cancel 8 games.\nWith so many new faces, Army was outplayed in their first game of the season and soundly beaten by MIT, 0–7. Delays and cancellations forced the team to the sidelines for over three weeks before their next match but even through the difficulties, they performed well against one of the top teams in the country. While the ice was soft, the Cadets weren't and Army recovered from an early 1–3 deficit to tie Clarkson by the end of the second period. McNamara gave the team a lead in the final frame but they couldn't stop Tech from equaling and the two needed overtime to settle the match. The two fought furiously to score for the first 4 minutes of the extra period, unfortunately it was Clarkson who netted a goal. The Greens then pulled back and played defense for the final 6 minutes, preventing Army from getting a good shot at tying the game. Amherst arrived in town a few weeks later and the two played an even game. they were so equally matched that after 2 overtime periods neither could net a winner so they had to settle for a tie.\nFor Army's final game of the year, they travelled north to Kingston to face the Royal Military College Paladins. Their Canadian counterparts kept their series winning streak alive with another easy victory, though Army did play better than the final score would indicate.\nThis season had one of the fewest number of games for Army's hockey team in its history and would serve as an impetus for the academy to build a more permanent home for the program.\nJoseph Cox served as the team's manager with John Oakes as his assistant.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a statistic in Division I until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but SFC's record books include players in these stats before these seasons.

        "text": "Daniil Vadimovich Tarasov (; born 27 March 1999) is a Russian professional ice hockey goaltender for the Columbus Blue Jackets in the National Hockey League (NHL). He was drafted 86th overall by the Columbus Blue Jackets in the third round of the 2017 NHL Entry Draft.\nEarly life.\nTarasov was born in Novokuznetsk, Kemerovo Oblast; his father, Vadim, was a goaltender for Metallurg Novokuznetsk in the Russian Superleague (RSL) when he was born. Tarasov started skating when he was three years old. When he was seven years old, his family moved to Ufa after Tarasov's father signed with the Salavat Yulaev Ufa in 2006. He joined the Salavat Yulaev's sports school, starting as a defenceman before making the change to goaltender at the age of eight.\nPlaying career.\nJunior.\nOn 16 November 2015, Tarasov made his Junior Hockey League (MHL) debut with Tolpar Ufa in a 6–4 win against the Chaika Nizhny Novgorod. He missed the following MHL season after he received surgery on his tibia for a tumor. He returned for the next season for Tolpar Ufa, earning the starting goaltending position with 40 games played and a 1.85 GAA and .928 SV%.\nProfessional.\nTarasov was selected 86th overall in the third round of the 2017 NHL Entry Draft by the Columbus Blue Jackets. On 10 September 2018, Tarasov made his professional debut for the Toros Neftekamsk of the Supreme Hockey League (VHL) in a 6–1 win against the KRS-BSU. On 9 January 2019, he recorded his first professional shutout in a 2–0 win against the Bars Kazan. In his Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) debut for the Salavat Yulaev, he recorded his first KHL shutout in a 3–0 win against the Admiral Vladivostok on 14 February 2019. He played 25 games with a 1.71 GAA and .928 SV% in his rookie professional season for the Toros, en route to winning Best Rookie in the VHL and a semi-final appearance in the 2019 Petrov Cup playoffs. After the 2018–19 season, the Salavat Yulaev offered him a contract in the KHL, however, Tarasov refused their offer.\nOn 4 May 2019, the Columbus Blue Jackets signed Tarasov to a three-year entry-level contract. He was loaned to Ässät in Liiga for the 2019–20 season, playing 41 games with 2.72 GAA and a .899 SV%. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, he split his time between Salavat Yulaev in the KHL and the Blue Jackets' AHL affiliate, the Cleveland Monsters. On 3 April 2021, he made his North American professional debut for the Monsters in a 4–2 win against the Grand Rapids Griffins. He missed time in the 2021–22 AHL season after testing positive for COVID-19.\nTarasov entered the 2021–22 AHL season as the Monsters' starting goaltender. After both Blue Jackets goaltenders were out with an illness, on 2 December 2021, Tarasov made his NHL debut on an emergency call-up with 34 saves in a 3–2 loss against the Dallas Stars.\nTarasov earned his first-career NHL win on October 23, 2022 in Madison Square Garden when the Blue Jackets defeated the New York Rangers 5–1. He made 30 saves in the win. Tarasov is not the first Blue Jackets goalie to earn his first NHL win in MSG; his comes just under two years after Matīss Kivlenieks recorded his first NHL win in the same arena. Throughout the 2022–23 season, Tarasov has been splitting time between the Cleveland Monsters and Columbus Blue Jackets, backing up goalies Elvis Merzļikins and Joonas Korpisalo while they dealt with injury. On November 20, 2022, Tarasov made 47 saves in a 5–3 win against the Florida Panthers. This is tied for second most by a Blue Jackets rookie goalie in a single game and most saves in a game by a rookie NHL goaltender this season.\nInternational play.\nOne week prior to the 2016 IIHF World U18 Championships, a large portion of Russia men's national under-18 ice hockey team tested positive for meldonium, which is considered a banned substance by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA); therefore, the entire under-18 team was replaced by the under-17 team, which included Tarasov, for the U18 World Championships. He was Russia's starting goaltender and was selected as one of the top three players on his team in the tournament. He also played for Russia men's national junior ice hockey team at the 2019 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, winning a bronze medal, and Russia men's national ice hockey team at the 2019 Deutschland Cup.\nPersonal life.\nTarasov's father, Vadim, is a former professional goaltender who was drafted 196th overall by the Montreal Canadiens in the 1999 NHL Entry Draft and played 17 seasons in the RSL and KHL. He is the current goaltending coach for the Sibir Novosibirsk.\nTarasov's favourite goaltenders include Andrei Vasilevskiy, Sergei Bobrovsky, and Carey Price. After he was drafted by the Blue Jackets, he started learning English. He is married."

Ashleigh Barty was the reigning champion in the women's singles, but she retired from the sport in March 2022.\nSpectators returned to full capacity for the first time since 2020, targeting to exceed 900,000 fans, after capacity restrictions in the last two events due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTo mark the seventieth anniversary of his first singles title in 1953, Ken Rosewall presented the men's singles trophy to the champion. Billie Jean King presented the women's singles trophy, on the fifty-fifth anniversary of her 1968 victory.\nWith the elimination of world No. 1 Iga Świątek in the fourth round by Elena Rybakina, this became the first edition of the Australian Open in the Open Era to feature neither of the top two singles seeds of either gender in the quarterfinals.\nThis was the last Australian Open Tennis Championships to be held on an opening Monday and from January 2024, the tournament will begin on a Sunday which will take place on 14 January 2024. \nPoint distribution and prize money.\nPoint distribution.\nBelow is a series of tables for each competition showing the ranking points offered for each event.\nPrize money.\nThe Australian Open total prize money for 2023 increased by 3.38% year on year to a tournament record A$76,500,000. This represented a 155% increase in prize money over the last ten years, from the A$30 million on offer in 2013.\nControversy.\nIn the wake of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, organizers from the tournament banned Russian and Belarusian flags from being displayed courtside. Nations' flags were initially allowed, but this was reversed after an incident between Russia's Kamilla Rakhimova and Ukraine's Kateryna Baindl. During the game, Russian supporters were accused of taunting Baindl, but the group denied that they were being provocative. They stated that they were merely supporting Rakhimova. \nThe move came after Russian and Belarusian players were banned from playing under their nation's flags.\nExternal links.\n "

        "text": "The Wairarapa cricket team represents the Wairarapa region of the North Island of New Zealand. It is one of the 21 teams from around New Zealand that compete in the Hawke Cup. Its base is in Masterton.\nEarly history.\nCricket has been played in the region since the mid-1860s. Festivities at Greytown on New Year's Day 1867 included men's and women's cricket matches – the first known instance of women's cricket in New Zealand. The Greytown Cricket Club was formed later that year. \nThe first Wairarapa Cricket Association was formed in the 1870s, based in Greytown. A second Wairarapa Cricket Association was formed in the late 1880s, based in Carterton, and not including Greytown. The current Wairarapa Cricket Association was formed in 1894, with seven clubs under a handicap system: Masterton and Greytown each fielded 11 players in a match, Carterton and Eketahuna had 13, Featherston, Matarawa, Greytown 2nd XI and Masterton 2nd XI had 15, and Morrison's Bush 16. The Association's inaugural president was the politician W. C. Buchanan. The first century in the competition was by Charlie Perry, who scored 110 for Midland (a Masterton team) against Greytown in February 1899.\nThe first visit by an overseas touring team was by Lord Hawke's XI in January 1903. They beat a Wairarapa XXII by an innings at the Recreation Reserve in Greytown. The Marylebone Cricket Club played a Wairarapa XV in February 1907, again winning by an innings, this time at the Park Oval in Masterton. The Association moved its headquarters to Masterton in 1907.\nHawke Cup.\nThe Hawke Cup began on 16 December 1910, when Wairarapa played in the first match, hosting Manawatu at the Park Oval in Masterton. Captained by Harry Moorhouse, they lost to Manawatu by 32 runs. They won the title for the first time in February 1921 when they beat Poverty Bay by two wickets, Ces Dacre guiding them to victory in a low-scoring match with 61 not out in the second innings. Their next title came 30 years later with a first-innings victory over Hawke's Bay by 21 runs. Murray Chapple scored 104 in Wairarapa's innings of 177.\nCaptained by Dermot Payton, Wairarapa took the title for the third time in February 1977, and held it through six challenges at Queen Elizabeth Park (the renamed Park Oval) until Nelson beat them in February 1979. The Test batsman Mike Shrimpton was a member of the team during this dominant period.\nCentral Districts.\nCentral Districts, of which Wairarapa is one of the eight constituent associations, began playing in the Plunket Shield in the 1950–51 season. Wairarapa's first player in the Central Districts team was Murray Chapple, who played in their inaugural Plunket Shield match.\nThe six Central Districts associations from the North Island compete for the Furlong Cup. The winner earns the right to challenge for the Hawke Cup."

        "text": "The Hamilton cricket team represents the city of Hamilton in New Zealand. It is one of the 21 New Zealand teams that compete in the Hawke Cup, and the only one that just represents an urban area. Its parent organisation is the Hamilton Cricket Association.\nHistory.\nWhen Hamilton township was formed in 1864, cricket was already being played in the Waikato region. Cricket was soon established in the town. The first Hamilton Cricket Association was formed in 1899. After numerous reorganisations of cricket in the region, in 1975 the Hamilton Cricket Association was established in its current form, covering the Hamilton metropolitan area and eligible to compete in the Hawke Cup.\nHamilton began competing in the Hawke Cup in the 1976-77 season. Waikato had represented the area until 1974-75, and for most of the period before World War Two South Auckland had done so. All three teams had Seddon Park in Hamilton as their home ground. Hamilton's home ground since 2000 has been Galloway Park in Hamilton East.\nHamilton first challenged for the Hawke Cup title in February 1978. They won the Cup for the first time when they beat Hawke's Bay in March 2001. They have now held the title five times, most recently between March 2019 and March 2020.\nNorthern Districts, of which Hamilton is one of the constituent associations, began playing in the Plunket Shield in 1956-57. Chris Kuggeleijn, Hamilton's first captain in 1976-77, was one of the new Hamilton team's first Plunket Shield players.\nAs well as the Hawke Cup, Hamilton also compete in the Fergus Hickey Rosebowl, the competition of two-day matches among the six constituent associations of Northern Districts, and the Brian Dunning Cup, the 50-over competition."

He played for East again in the 1887 fixture against West.\nHe played for Edinburgh District in the inter-city match against Glasgow District on 4 December 1886.\nInternational career.\nHe was capped 5 times for Scotland in 1886 to 1891.\nDeath.\nWilson died of pneumonia in 1908. The \"British Medical Journal\" ran this obituary:\nTHE LATE DR. G. R. WILSON. A wide circle of friends will hear with deep regret of the death of Dr G. R. Wilson, Allanton House, Newmains. Dr Wilson had recently an attack of influenza, from which he was making a satisfactory recovery, when pneumonia supervened, and to this he succumbed yesterday morning. A native of Duns and a member of a well-known Berwickshire family, Dr Wilson was educated at the High School and Edinburgh University. After graduation he devoted himself exclusively to the study of mental diseases. A period of training in other medical schools was followed by his appointment to the post of assistant physician to the Royal Edinburgh Asylum, which post he held for four years, and relinquished on his promotion to that of superintendent at Mavisbank Asylum. He retired from this position in 1905, to devote himself to consulting work in psychiatric medicine and in this connection opened a sanatorium for the treatment of neurasthenia and other nervous diseases at Allanton House , Newmains. This institution had already gained a deservedly high reputation for the successful treatment of a wide group of nervous disorders. Dr Wilson was the author of a number of important works dealing with insanity, which had marked him out as a man of singular ability in this department of medicine, and had earned for him a wide reputation among psychiatric physicians in this country. At the onset of his last illness he had just completed a new and important work on \"Evolution, Deviation, and Disease of the Mind\" to be published in the autumn of this year. Personally Dr Wilson was one of the most attractive of men, and many who knew him to be an able and eminent physician will remember him best as an old international Rugby football player, as a golfer, cricketer, or curler — and above all, as one of the truest of friends and most genial of companions. Dr Wilson is survived by a widow and two children."

A week later they renewed their now-annual rivalry with Alexandria Bay, falling 3–6. The team then met Cornell for the first time and scratched out a 0–0 draw. It was the first intercollegiate game for Tech that didn't end in a lopsided defeat, so the program was at least improving in that regard. A rematch with Alexandria Bay at the end of the month served as the team's first home game. While the score was closer, the result was the same and Clarkson entered February with a losing record.\nOf the team's final six games, four were eventually cancelled. Despite the trouble, however, the Knights won both matches to finish the year on a high note.

Two events demonstrated that the team would be able to survive after his graduation, however; a temporary rink was built next to Main Street so that the players could both practice and play on consistent ice, and the team secured the services of a coach to help improve their game. Gordon Croskery, an assistant professor of Engineering at the school and a World War I veteran, was a Canadian who had grown up with the game and would be able to teach some of the finer points to the players. While he technically wasn't the team's coach, he is typically regarded as the program's first bench boss.\nClarkson's season began with a game against Hamilton and the loss of Johnson's offensive touch was felt in their 0–5 loss. The team's defence shut down Ogdensburg in the next game, winning 1–0 in overtime.

        "title": "Cycling in Canberra",
        "text": "Cycling in Canberra, the capital city of Australia, is a popular means of transportation, sporting and recreational pass time. Commuting in the city is supported by an extensive network of urban cycleways and on-street bicycle lanes. As a city established in the 20th century, Canberra's development was heavily influenced by the automobile for much of its history. The popularity of cycling in the city has increased dramatically in the 21st century with growing awareness of environmental issues, government policy supporting active transport and investment in cycling infrastructure. This has led to the development of a strong cycling culture.\nA relatively small city, Canberra has some of the highest rates of active transport in the country. Australian Bicycle Council research released in 2014 showed that more people in Canberra cycled than in any other Australian city or state, against a slight decline in the national participation rate, with 47% of residents reporting they had cycled at least once during the year. In 2019, Austroads data suggested as many as 93,700 residents cycled in a typical week, with 183,300 riding at least once per year. 57% of Canberra households owned at least one bicycle. Amongst regular cyclists, the main reasons for cycling were commuting to work or travelling for study, while those who rode less frequently were more likely to do so for recreation. The number of male cyclists in the city is significantly higher than females, although the participation rates for both are still higher than the national average.\nAs the location of the headquarters of the Australian Institute of Sport, many professional and elite-level cyclists live in Canberra, or travel to the city for training. The Australian Capital Territory and surrounding region is a popular destination for both on and off-road cycling, with the city hosting a number of national and international competitions across a variety of cycling disciplines. The Trek Bicycle Corporation's Australian headquarters is located in the Canberra suburb of Fyshwick, taking advantage of the cycle-friendly infrastructure and varied terrain offered by the many mountain biking trails throughout the Territory.\nHistory.\n20th century.\nCycling has been a popular recreational pass time in the Canberra region since before the city's foundation in 1913. The Queanbeyan Cycling Club was established in 1899 (located just across the present-day border with New South Wales). Additional cycling clubs were formed in Canberra and Kingston during the 1920s. By March 1927, the Canberra Cycling Club alone had over 90 members - at that time the population was just 6000.\nDuring the 1960s, transport network planning in Canberra was based around private vehicles as the primary mode. A network of dedicated cycle paths was first proposed by the National Capital Development Commission (NCDC) in the early 1970s. A 1973 NCDC news feature discussed the benefits of building such a network to supplement the pedestrian paths and equestrian trails linking the suburbs, although considered the costs to be quite high given that there were very few cyclists in the city at that time. It was estimated that 25% of high school students rode bikes to school, while fewer than 3% of university students did the same. From a survey of 363 workers in the employment hub of Phillip in the Woden Valley district, only 1 indicated they cycled to work. The first cycle path, considered a pilot for an extended commuter network was opened from Dickson to the city along a route parallel to Sullivan's creek. The path was officially opened by Minister for Urban and Regional Development Tom Uren, while the occasion was celebrated with a race between local media personalities. Today, the Sullivans Creek shared path remains the busiest commuter cycling route in Canberra.\nDespite the low number of bicycle commuters, cycling was gaining popularity in the Territory. Although there were some sporting facilities operated by cycling clubs, including a velodrome that opened in Narrabundah in 1972, there was little public investment to address the needs of local cyclists. In 1974, a mass ride involving more than 50 bikes was organised by Howard Rawson and Bill Crowle. The ride from Belconnen to the city via Belconnen Way and Macarthur Avenue received significant media attention, drawing attention to the lack of infrastructure that forced cyclists to ride on main roads. Further protest rides would lead to the formation of cycling advocacy group Pedal Power ACT in 1975.\nCensus data in 1981 showed that the number of commuters cycling to work in Canberra had increased from just 0.9% of all trips to 2.1% in the five years since 1976, coinciding with the extension of the NCDC's cycle path network. Yet modelling during this period did not consider commuter cycling when determining future transport policy. Planning continued to favour private cars and the growth in bicycle commuters had stagnated by the mid-1980s. This situation remained largely unchanged until the ACT achieved self-government in 1989, as well as a renewed interest in cycling as a sport during the 1990s.\nBetween the 1970s and 1990s, the district of Tuggeranong was the first in the ACT to be developed with a cycling network incorporated into the design of new neighbourhoods, now a feature of all new Canberra suburbs.\nIn 1990, the Australian Institute of Sport established its Men's Road Cycling program in Canberra under coach Heiko Salzwedel. The Women's program was added two years later in 1992. A Canberra-based \nmountain biking program established at the same time was later dropped. In 1993, the ACT Cycling Federation (now Cycling ACT, merged into AusCycling) split from the NSW Cycling Federation as a separate entity governing bicycle racing in Canberra.\nThe first Big Canberra Bike Ride was held in 1999. This non-competitive, mass participation event has since become an annual charity ride, encouraging Canberrans of all ages and abilities to meet at the Albert Hall before cycling different scenic routes around the city.\n21st century.\nSignificant investment in new cycling infrastructure during the 2000–10s and Canberra's growing reputation as a cycling destination was credited with noticeably increasing non-competitive, social participation in events organised by the Canberra Cycling Club by the mid-2010s.\nIn 2017, the ACT Environment, Planning and Sustainable Development Directorate proposed a variation to the \n\"Planning and Development Act 2007\" to incentivise property developers to incorporate end-of-trip facilities such as secure bicycle parking, showers and lockers, in new and renovated buildings to encourage uptake of active transport options.\nSydney based bike share company Airbike expanded into Canberra in 2018, despite concerns that it would lead to bikes being dumped around the city and in Lake Burley Griffin.\nIn 2020, the ACT became the second jurisdiction after Western Australia to implement the Crime Stoppers Bikelinc platform, a database that allows owners to register details of their bicycles to assist police in tracking and returning stolen bikes. ACT Policing reported a 25% increase in bicycle theft across Canberra between 2017 and 2020, yet only a small number of recovered bikes were able to be returned to their owners \nAlso in 2020, City Renewal Authority began installing public bike repair stations in areas with high bicycle traffic in an effort to encourage cycling as a preferred mode of transport. These stations include an air compressor for inflating tyres, common tools such as allen keys and spanners and QR codes linking to information on bicycle maintenance and how to use the equipment.\nCycling culture.\nCanberra is renowned as a cycling destination both in Australia and abroad. The cultural influence of cycling on the city is represented in the local arts community, through public installations and special events such as an exclusive Australian screening of Dutch documentary \"Why We Cycle\" at the National Film &amp; Sound Archive in 2018\nA key campaign to promote Canberra internationally and drive growth the tourism sector is the promotion of cycling events and tours within the city and surrounding region. A number of businesses operating in Canberra currently provide small group bicycle tours.\nBentspoke Brewing Co, a local boutique brewery have adopted a cycling theme, both in the name of their beverages (e.g. Crankshaft, Sprocket and Fixie) and bicycle inspired decor for their brew pub in the suburb of Braddon. The company is a major sponsor of local cycling events, including the 2017 Kowalski Classic mountain bike race on the Sparrow Hill trails in Kowen Forest. The 2021 ACT BMX Jam staged a round at the Bentspoke cannery in the industrial suburb of Mitchell, while Bentspoke's Braddon brewpub is the starting location for the Monaro Cloudride 1000.\nThe Canberra Bicycle Museum previously operated within the Tradesman's Union club in the suburb of Dickson until closing in 2009. The majority of museum's extensive collection of over 1000 rare and historic bicycles were sold to the public and collectors.\nBuilt to celebrate the city's 100th anniversary in 2013, the Centenary Trail is a signposted loop consisting of sealed shared paths, fire trails, equestrian trails and public roads that is designed to allow cyclists and hikers to explore the city's heritage, natural environments and native wildlife. The trail, which skirts Canberra's urban fringe, quickly earned a positive reputation in the cycling press and is a popular day trip for local and visiting off-road cyclists.\nCommuter cycling network.\nCanberra's network of cycling routes uses both shared paths (including some with grade separation) and on-road cycle lanes. In 2021, American cycling advocacy group \"PeopleForBikes\" ranked Canberra 34th out of 770 cities for the quality of its cycling networks – the highest ranking for any Australian city, ahead of Alice Springs and Melbourne. On some streets within the Civic precinct, as well on the Belconnen Bikeway, cycle routes are segregated from motor vehicle traffic. There are ten signposted routes linking the major town centres and other points of interest:\nCycling as a sport.\nCanberra well represented in terms of competitive and professional cycling. In 2009, the city hosted the UCI Mountain Bike World Championships at Stromlo Forest Park, while the Australian Institute of Sport in the suburb of Bruce maintains a road cycling training program for competitors at elite level.\nNotable competitive cyclists from Canberra include two-time Commonwealth Games women's road race medallist Chloe Hosking, Commonwealth Games and Olympic medallist Michael Rogers, Team Sky road racer Mathew Hayman, and Orica–AIS rider Jessie MacLean. Others who have trained and competed in Canberra include 1992 Olympic Road Race Gold Medallist Kathy Watt, Olympian and successful international coach Gary Sutton and dual 1998 Commonwealth Games gold medallist Anna Wilson.\nThe mobile training app \"Today's Plan\" was developed in Canberra during 2015, attracting local investors and support from the ACT Government. The platform supports cyclists to train remotely, while monitored by coaches and teammates. This app was adopted by several UCI WorldTeams, including Team Sky, Bora–Hansgrohe and Team Bahrain Victorious.\nEvents and competitions.\nCanberra hosts a variety of annual events and competitions including:\nBMX\nHillclimbs\nOff Road Events\nRoad Races\nTrack Events\nVenues.\nThe Stromlo Forest Park is a major mountain biking venue located just outside of Canberra. It was the venue for the 2008 UCI Mountain Bike World Cup (Round 6) and hosted the 2009 UCI Mountain Bike &amp; Trials World Championships, as well as national competitions including Round 2 of the Fox Superflow enduro series in 2019. The park has of maintained trails, built to International Mountain Bicycling Association difficulty rating criteria and ranging from easy to extremely difficult. There is a training area consisting of a course with progressive increases in difficulty and alternative paths around obstacles along its length. A shuttle bus also operates on weekends to carry riders from the car park to the trailheads for the downhill and jumps courses. At the base of the mountain, there is a pump track and BMX jumps. Other facilities at Stromlo include four-cross and trials courses, as well as guest amenities including a cafe and bike shop.\nSparrow Hill, in the Kowen district east of Canberra is another popular mountain biking location, mainly used for local competitions by the Canberra Off-Road Cycling club. These trails opened as an alternative to Stromlo Forest Park, after it was destroyed in the 2003 Canberra bushfires, offering four cross-country loop courses of various lengths and difficulties. Other popular recreational off-road cycling trails can be found at Majura Pines and Tuggeranong Pines on Canberra's outskirts. It was the venue for the now defunct Kowalski Classic off-road race and the AMB100 Marathon, which relocated here from Stromlo Forest Park in 2020 and ran as an asynchoronous race due to COVID-19.\nThe Stephen Hodge Criterium Cycling Circuit is a criterium venue with multiple configurations, located within Stromlo Forest Park. The circuit, which hosts international competitions, is also open to the public at no cost when not in competitive use. The setting of the track in bushland has led to incidents where crits have been interrupted by kangaroos.\nThe Narrabundah Velodrome (locally known as the \"Bundahdome\") hosts track cycling club meets and competitions. Originally built in 1972, the facility was not suitable for interstate competitions due to the very steep bank angles of the curves and harsh transitions. The outdoor velodrome was closed in April 2013 due to concerns about the condition of this facility and despite uncertainty about its future, was reopened following remediation and re-surfacing works in time to host the 2014 ACT Track Championships. In addition to Territory Championship events, the Capital Region Masters Cycling Club hold regular race meets at the velodrome.\nThere are a number of BMX tracks throughout the suburbs, including the Canberra BMX Club in Melba, the Tuggeranong BMX track in Kambah and at Yerrabi Pond District Park in Canberra. Both the Canberra BMX Club and Canberra Off Road Cyclists club stage events at these facilities throughout the year.\nCycling rules and regulations.\nUnlike New South Wales and Victoria, cyclists in the Australian Capital Territory are permitted to ride on standard footpaths. Cyclists are also not required to dismount at pedestrian crossings. While helmets are required, there are some exemptions, including for religious headgear. With the use of dashcams becoming more widespread, cycling advocacy groups have lobbied for the ACT Government to enact harsher penalties for negligent driving that injures vulnerable road users.\nIn general, when riding on public roads, cyclists have the same legal rights and obligations as other road users, although there are some road rules that are specifically designed to protect cyclists and other vulnerable road users. Drivers of motor vehicles are required to leave at least 1 meter of lateral spacing when passing cyclists on roads with a speed limit of 60 km/h or below. Where the speed limit is over 60 km/h, this distance increases to 1.5 meters. Cyclists are permitted to use roads as an alternative to dedicated cycle paths, but must only ride in marked cycle lanes where these are provided and must give way to vehicles signalling a left turn. Riding two-abreast is permitted at all times, however it is encouraged that cyclists move to single file to let traffic pass and exercise commonsense based on traffic conditions. Front and rear lights are required for on road cycling at night and in poor visibility.\nPublic transport.\nThe Canberra light rail network was designed to integrate with cycling and other forms of active transport. All light rail vehicles have bicycle racks on board. Outdoor Bike racks are also installed at all stations, as well as some bus stops. No locks are provided, and use of these racks is at passengers' own risk. A secure, covered bicycle cage is available at the Nullarbor Avenue light rail station. Under the \"Bike and Ride\" initiative, Transport Canberra maintains additional bike cages key bus stops and interchanges across the network that can be accessed on request using a valid MyWay card. Most ACTION busses have bicycle carriers installed on the front of the vehicle for up to two bicycles (it is the passenger's responsibility to securely attach and remove bicycles when boarding or alighting). Carriage of bicycles is included in the fare for both bus and tram services."

        "text": "John Tod (8 October 1862 – 8 September 1935) was a Scotland international rugby union player. He was nicknamed 'The Prince of Dribblers' and it is said that he introduced the dribbling game to rugby union. Tod, himself, rated the later Watsonian player and Scotland international William Cownie as a much better dribbler of the rugby ball than he was, saying that Cownie was the prettiest dribbler he had ever seen touch a rugby ball.\nRugby Union career.\nAmateur career.\nHe played for Edinburgh University and then Watsonians. A letter to \"The Scotsman\" on Tod's death by a \"D.P.M\" relayed this information:\nAs stated in your columns on Tuesday Dr John Tod, who died suddenly on Monday while on holiday at Strathpeffer, Ross-shire, was in his younger days an international Rugby forward. John Tod was the first Watsonian to get an international cap. After playing for Edinburgh University, he joined the Watsonians, and captained the side in 1883-4 and 1884-5. His first game for Scotland was in 1884, when we gained a victory over Wales at Newport. He was capped eight times [sic] in all. Writing in the Jubilee number of \"The Watsonian \" summer term 1920 \"R.M.\" made reference to Tod's prowess as a player : \"During his captaincy his motto was , 'Hard training and unselfishness.' — he would not have a man in his team who would not pass to his neighbour. It was he who introduced the dribbling game to Scottish Rugby. [...] The Watsonian forwards were from that time a power in the land.\"\nProvincial career.\nHe played for East of Scotland District in their trial match against West of Scotland District in January 1883.\nHe played for Edinburgh District in the 1883, 1884 and 1885 inter-city matches against Glasgow District.\nInternational career.\nHe was capped 9 times - and not 8 times as \"D.P.M.\" counted above - for Scotland in the period 1884 to 1886. He scored 2 tries.\nMedical career.\nHe became a G.P. and practiced in Leith. He was prominent in Masonic circles in Edinburgh.\nFamily.\nHis father was James Robertson Tod (1827-1901) and his mother Ann Campbell (1824-1912). He was one of their 7 children.\nHe married Mary Bennett in 1907.\nDeath.\nHe died on holiday at Strathpeffer on the local golf course. Tod was a regular attendee of the Strathpeffer Spa. \"The Scotsman\" reported that he had played only one stroke on the golf course before collapsing dead. The \"Daily Mirror\" used the headline grabbling line: \"First stroke his last\" in reporting his death."

He was a Negro league infielder in the late 1920s while also playing professional basketball and semi-professional football.\nBaseball career.\nMoore began his career with the semi-pro Pittsburgh Crawfords in May 1928 as a first baseman. In August, both Moore and third baseman Bill Harris left the club to join the Homestead Grays. One of the two players to fill vacancies of Moore and Harris was Josh Gibson.\nBasketball and football career.\nMoore was a multi-sport athlete. In addition to playing in the Negro leagues, he was an all-city basketball player at Schenley High School in Pittsburgh. He was also selected three times as an all-scholastic center. When he was selected unanimously for the third consecutive year as the best scholastic center in Pittsburgh, \"The Pittsburgh Courier\" wrote: \"Considering his youth, his natural athletic abilities and his quick susceptibility to teaching, Johnny undoubtedly will reach the peaks in basketball achievements. A perfect gentleman wherever you meet him, bashful John is an excellent example of the ideal man of tomorrow. If there were only more young athletes with a similar deportment, what a world, what a world this would be.\"\nMoore also played professional basketball for the Loendi Big Five, one of the early black basketball teams known as the Black Fives. He also was a member of the Homestead Grays basketball team in 1927, led by Cumberland Posey, the organizer of the baseball team of the same name, and the Holy Cross Parishioners. Moore won a reputation as \"a real offensive threat at all times\" who \"garnered a large number of baskets.\" In 1930, he played basketball with the Bailey Bige Five with fellow Negro leaguers Vic Harris and Claude Johnson.\nFrom at least 1934 to 1936, Moore played basketball with the Iron City Elks along with fellow Negro leaguer Joe Ware and future photographer Teenie Harris.\nMoore was described by \"The Pittsburgh Courier\" in 1936 as \"one of the best 'stretch-runners' who ever swept down the hardwoods . . . the left-handed hook artist, who is a clever all-around floorman and one of the finest ponies bred on Smoketown's hills in many moons.\"\nHe also played at the quarterback position for the Pittsburgh Crawford's football counterparts, the Garfield Eagles. He also played quarterback in 1931 for the East Liberty Scholastics, described at the time as \"Pittsburgh's outstanding grid eleven.\""

        "text": "The 2022 Novak Djokovic tennis season officially began on 21 February 2022, with the start of the Dubai Tennis Championships.\nDuring this season, Djokovic:\nYearly summary.\nEarly hard court season.\nATP Cup.\nDjokovic withdrew from the Serbian team taking part at the ATP Cup from 1 January in Sydney.\nAustralian Open.\nDjokovic received a COVID-19 vaccination exemption from Tennis Australia to enter into the Australian Open. The exemption was provided after a rigorous review process involving two separate independent panels of medical experts, including the Independent Medical Exemption Review Panel appointed by the Victoria Department of Health. The panels applied the guidelines set by the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation. The basis for the exemption was that Djokovic had contracted COVID-19 in the past 6 months. Djokovic's participation in the Australian Open was cast into doubt after the Australian Border Force questioned the basis for the exemption. He was detained by the Australian Border Force on 5 January, and his visa was cancelled on the same day, with plans for his deportation being put in place. His lawyers challenged the decision. The Federal Circuit and Family Court ruled against the government on procedural grounds and ordered his release from detention and directed the federal government to pay his legal expenses.\nOn 14 January 2022, Alex Hawke, the Australian Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs, exercised his ministerial powers under sections 133C(3) and 116(1)(e)(i) of the \"Migration Act 1958\" to cancel Djokovic's visa, citing \"health and good order grounds, on the basis that it was in the public interest to do so\". Djokovic's application for judicial review in the Federal Court was unanimously dismissed by the full court with costs on 16 January. Djokovic said he was \"extremely disappointed\" with the decision but accepted the ruling, and flew out of Australia that night. \"Lucky loser\" Salvatore Caruso took his place in the Australian Open draw.\nIn late January, doubts continued to mount over the validity of the date of his COVID test. Nevertheless, Djokovic entered into the 2022 Dubai Tennis Championships, an ATP 500 tournament where he has been seeded first. The tournament is due to be held in February; vaccination is not a requirement for entry into Dubai.\nDubai Tennis Championships.\nDjokovic played his first tournament of the season in Dubai after his deportation from Australia. He defeated Lorenzo Musetti and Karen Khachanov in straight sets. He then lost in the quarterfinals to Jiří Veselý in straight sets, thus losing his number 1 ranking to Daniil Medvedev.\nIndian Wells Masters.\nDjokovic withdrew from the tournament due to COVID-19 vaccine mandate rules from entering the United States. Despite this, Djokovic regained the number 1 ranking after Gaël Monfils beat Daniil Medvedev in the third round.\nMiami Open.\nDjokovic withdrew from the tournament due to vaccine mandate rules from entering the United States.\nClay court season.\nMonte-Carlo Masters.\nAfter getting a bye in the first round, Djokovic lost in the second round to eventual runner-up Alejandro Davidovich Fokina.\nSerbia Open.\nIn his first match he was down a set and a break to compatriot Laslo Đere, and 2 points from defeat in the second set tiebreak, but fought through to win in a final set tiebreak. In his quarterfinal match he came from a set and a break down to win for the second straight match against compatriot Miomir Kecmanović. In the semis he won a third straight match from a set down against Karen Khachanov to reach his first ATP final of 2022. In the finals he forced a third set from a set down for the 4th match in a row but ultimately ran out of gas and was bageled 0-6 in the final set. Rublev won the title, defeating Djokovic 6–2, 6–7(4–7), 6–0.\nMadrid Open.\nDefeating Gaël Monfils for a record 18th time, Djokovic was supposed to play Andy Murray in the round of 16 but Murray withdrew due to food poisoning. He beat Hubert Hurkacz in the quarterfinals. In the semifinals he faced Carlos Alcaraz, who beat Nadal the day before. In a very tightly contested battle which lasted over 3 and a half hours, eventual champion Alcaraz prevailed 7–5 in the third set tiebreak and won the match 6–7, 7–5, 7–6.\nItalian Open.\nDjokovic defeated Aslan Karatsev, Stan Wawrinka, Félix Auger-Aliassime, Casper Ruud and Stefanos Tsitsipas, all in straight sets en route to winning the title, his first of 2022, 38th Masters 1000 title overall, and 6th in Rome.\nFrench Open.\nDjokovic, the defending champion, cruised through the first 4 rounds against Nishioka, Molcan (coached by Marián Vajda, Djokovic's former coach), Bedene and Schwartzman without losing a set. He entered his quarterfinal match having won 22 sets in a row, where he faced Rafael Nadal. Nadal prevailed in a close four set battle that lasted over four hours, 6–2, 4–6, 6–2, 7–6(7–4), and went on to win his 14th French Open title (and 22nd overall Grand Slam) five days later, leaving Djokovic two behind the all time lead. Djokovic lost the number 1 ranking to Medvedev after failing to defend the title.\nGrass court season.\nWimbledon.\nDjokovic entered the tournament as the three-time defending champion. In the first round he beat Soon-woo Kwon in 4 sets, cruised to the quarterfinals with straight set wins against Thanasi Kokkinakis and compatriot Kecmanović, and defeated Tim Van Rijthoven in the fourth round in 4 sets. In the quarterfinals he would complete a 7th comeback from two sets down to prevail in five sets against Jannik Sinner. In the semis he beat the British #1 Cameron Norrie in 4 sets from a set down. Djokovic faced Nick Kyrgios in the final, the Australian playing his first ever major final. Kyrgios entered the match 2–0 against Djokovic, having never lost a match, a set, or any service games to Djokovic. In a tight 4 set final, Djokovic fought from a set down to prevail in 4 sets, 4–6, 6–3, 6–4, 7–6, for his 7th Wimbledon title, just one behind Roger Federer, and 21st grand slam title, overtaking Federer, and putting him within one of Nadal's total. For the first time in his career Djokovic won a slam event four straight times (2018, 2019, 2021 and 2022; 2020 was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic).\nFall hard court season.\nDjokovic was forced to withdraw from the Canadian Open in Montreal, Western and Southern Open in Cincinnati, and the US Open. He was not eligible to enter both Canada and the United States due to being unvaccinated as both countries mandated foreigners to be vaccinated to cross the border at the time of these tournaments.\nLaver Cup.\nDjokovic won a doubles match alongside Matteo Berrettini, and a singles match against Frances Tiafoe. He lost to Auger-Aliassime in the second last singles match, and Team World went on to claim their first ever Laver Cup title, 13–8. This tournament even marked the retirement of Tennis legend and Djokovic's longtime rival Roger Federer, who played his last tournament.\nTel Aviv Open.\nDjokovic beat Pablo Andujar, Vasek Pospisil, Roman Safiullin and Marin Čilić to win the title without the loss of a set at the Tel Aviv Open.\nAstana Open.\nDjokovic cruised past Cristian Garín, Botic van de Zandschulp and Karen Khachanov to reach the semis without losing a set. In the semis he faced Medvedev, who was two points from the win in the second set tiebreak which Djokovic won 8–6. Medvedev immediately retired from the match, telling Djokovic he sustained an adductor injury. Djokovic beat Tsitsipas in the final in straight sets for his 90th career title. With this win, he qualified for the 2022 ATP Finals, as he only needed to finish in the Top 20 of the Race to Turin, since he won a Grand Slam in 2022.\nParis Masters.\nDjokovic started as 6th seed. In opening 3 rounds he beat Maxime Cressy, Karen Khachanov and Lorenzo Musetti comfortably. In semifinals, he beat Stefanos Tsitsipas in third set tiebreaker to extend the masters finals record to 56. In final, he faced 19 year old Holger Rune who was in his first masters 1000 final. Rune won in three set to win his first masters title. It was the first time Djokovic lost a Masters 1000 final after winning the first set. \nATP Finals.\nDjokovic was put in the red group along with Stefanos Tsitsipas, Daniil Medvedev and Andrey Rublev. In the opening round, he beat Tsitsipas in 2 sets. In second round, he beat Rublev to qualify for semifinal for 11th time. In the final dead rubber, Djokovic took on Medvedev in a match that lasted 3hr 11mins. Djokovic was the only player who hadn't lost a match while reaching semifinals. In the semis, he beat Taylor Fritz in tight 2 sets. Djokovic remained unbeaten in the final beating world no.3 Casper Ruud. For winning the title unbeaten, Djokovic won $4,740,300 which is the most prize money for a single tournament in tennis history.

The team was coached by Ray Marchand in his 2nd season.\nSeason.\nFor Marchand's second season behind the bench, he would have to rebuild a team that lost all three starting forwards and its goaltender. Two reserves from last season (Heidner and Maude) were joined by new entry Thiebaud for the new offensive line while last year's reserve netminder, Lewis, was promoted to the starting role. Unfortunately, Army was again hampered by a lack of ice due to warm weather and had few opportunities to practice throughout the season. Despite the lack of familiarity between the forwards, Army got off to a good start, scoring 10 goals in its first three games. The match against MIT was affected by soft ice that bogged down players on both sides.\nWhen Army met Boston University for the first time, both sides spent the first period feeling one another out. BU dominated the second period, scoring 4 times and making it seem like the game would be a rout. Army recovered in the final frame, however, and fired a barrage of shots at the opposing goaltender. Three managed to find the back of the next but the Cadets were prevented from tying the game by a stellar netminding performance. After a further win over Amherst, virtually all of the Stuart Rink ice melted and the team was unable to practice for two weeks. Things got so bad that Army was forced to play its first ever intercollegiate road game in mid-February, travelling south to take on Princeton.\nWith the ice missing, all signs were pointing to the rivalry game with the Royal Military College being cancelled. However, just prior to the match a cold wind blew in and Stuart Rink became usable once more. Just as they had over the previous two years, the Paladins proved superior and defeated the Cadets.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

The English team returned to Pakistan in December 2022 to play three Test matches. The Test matches formed part of the 2021–2023 ICC World Test Championship.\nIn November 2021, Tom Harrison, the Chief Executive of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), flew to Pakistan to repair the relationship between the ECB and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) after England's planned tour to Pakistan in October 2021 was cancelled. After positive talks, the original tour itinerary of five T20I matches was increased to seven. The T20Is were scheduled to be played first, with the Test matches taking place following the 2022 ICC Men's T20 World Cup in Australia. In April 2022, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) confirmed that the series would be taking place. In July 2022, the PCB's Chairman Ramiz Raja said that the T20I matches would be likely to take place in Lahore and Karachi. The details of the T20I series was confirmed on 2 August 2022. The itinerary for the Test series was later announced on 22 August 2022.\nA total of 189,595 spectators watched the T20I leg of the series, at a 97.35% crowd attendance, making it the highest-attended series in Pakistan cricket history.\nOn 16 December 2022, Pakistan's Azhar Ali announced that he would retire from Test cricket following the completion of the Test series.\nEngland won the Test series 3–0, to become the first team to claim a clean sweep in a three-match series in Pakistan. This was also only the fourth time that England had taken a clean sweep in any away series of three Tests or more.\nSquads.\nThe ECB announced that Jos Buttler would miss the opening matches of the T20I series due to a calf injury, with Moeen Ali standing in as captain. Alex Hales was later added to the T20I squad. On 30 September, Pakistan's Naseem Shah was ruled out of the remainder of the T20I series due to COVID-19 positive result, with playing the first match only.\nRehan Ahmed was added to England's Test squad on 23 November. England's Liam Livingstone was ruled out of last two tests after sustaining a right knee injury during the first Test. On 5 December, Pakistan's Haris Rauf was ruled out of the remainder of the Test series, having sustained a quad injury in the first Test.\nWarm-up match.\nBefore the Test series, England played a three-day warm-up match against England Lions in Abu Dhabi."

        "text": "The 2022 Cazoo Premier League Darts was a darts tournament, organised by the Professional Darts Corporation – the eighteenth edition of the tournament. The event began on Thursday 3 February 2022, at the Motorpoint Arena in Cardiff, and finished with the play-offs, at the Mercedes-Benz Arena in Berlin on Monday 13 June 2022.\nJonny Clayton was the reigning champion after defeating José de Sousa 11–5 in the 2021 final, but he lost 10–4 to debutant Joe Cullen in the semi-finals.\nMichael van Gerwen won a record-equalling sixth Premier League title by defeating Cullen 11–10 in the final, after Cullen missed a dart at double to win the title, which would have made him the third debutant in a row (after Glen Durrant and Clayton) to win the title at his first attempt.\nOn Night 3, Gerwyn Price hit nine-dart finishes in consecutive matches (in his semi-final against Michael van Gerwen and the final against James Wade), making him the second person in Premier League history to hit two nine-darters on the same night, after Phil Taylor, who did both of his in the 2010 Premier League Darts final against Wade.\nThis tournament also saw the beginning of the PDC's new partnership with Winmau as their dartboard supplier.\nFormat.\nOn 14 January 2022, the PDC announced a new format for the Premier League. Instead of the previously used round robin format, the event consisted of an eight-person knockout bracket every night. Each of the seven matches was played over the best-of-11 legs. The players were guaranteed to meet each other once in the quarter-finals throughout the first seven weeks and once in the quarterfinals in weeks 9–15, with weeks 8 and 16 being drawn based on the league standings at that point. Players received two points per semi-final finish, three points per runner-up finish, and five points per final win.\nThough it was assured that players meet each other only twice in the quarter-finals on regular nights (i.e. weeks 1–7 and 9–15), no other guarantees are made. So certain players were drawn onto the same semi-final branch more often than others. For example, while Price–Wright, van Gerwen–Anderson and Wade–Smith pairs were on the same branch only when they play each other in the quarter-finals, a Wright–Anderson and van Gerwen–Smith final was possible only twice on the regular 14 nights.\nFollowing the regular phase, the top four players in the league table contested the two knockout semi-finals with 1st playing 4th and 2nd playing 3rd.\nVenues.\n2022 saw the return of the Brighton Centre, which was last used as a Premier League venue in 2017.\nPrize money.\nThe prize money for the 2022 tournament increased to £1 million, including a £10,000 bonus to each night's winner.\nPlayers.\nUsually, the top four players in the PDC Order of Merit following the 2022 PDC World Darts Championship would be joined by six invited players, of which they would have been announced following the World Championship final. However, this year, following the announcement of the new format, it was announced that only 8 players will participate in 2022.\nIt was revealed that the new format would encompass eight players, each playing against each other in a knockout tournament each night. The winner of each night would receive an additional £10,000 towards their prize money. Those who make it out of the last 8 each receive 2 points, the runner-up will receive 3 points and the winner receives 5.\nThe full list of players was announced on 31 January 2022, with the Top 6 players on the PDC Order of Merit joined by the reigning Premier League champion Jonny Clayton, and debutant Joe Cullen, fresh from winning his first televised title at the Masters the previous evening.\nThis new format saw “Judgement Night” and relegation disappear from the league.\nLeague stage.\n3 February – Night 1.\n Motorpoint Arena Cardiff, Cardiff\n10 February – Night 2.\n M&amp;S Bank Arena, Liverpool\n17 February – Night 3.\n SSE Arena, Belfast\n3 March – Night 4.\n Westpoint Arena, Exeter\n10 March – Night 5.\n Brighton Centre, Brighton\n17 March – Night 6.\n Motorpoint Arena Nottingham, Nottingham\n24 March – Night 7.\n Rotterdam Ahoy, Rotterdam\n31 March – Night 8.\n Utilita Arena Birmingham, Birmingham\n First Direct Arena, Leeds\n14 April – Night 10.\n AO Arena, Manchester\n21 April – Night 11.\n P&amp;J Live, Aberdeen\n28 April – Night 12.\n 3Arena, Dublin\n5 May – Night 13.\n OVO Hydro, Glasgow\n12 May – Night 14.\n Utilita Arena Sheffield, Sheffield\n19 May – Night 15.\n The O2, London\n26 May – Night 16.\n Utilita Arena Newcastle, Newcastle\n13 June – Play-offs.\nThe top four players of the league stage contest in the play-offs to decide the champion of the Premier League.\n Mercedes-Benz Arena, Berlin\nTable and streaks.\nTable.\nFive points are awarded for a night win, three points for the runner-up and two points for the semi-finalists.

Wellington hosted minor league home games at Woods Park.\nHistory.\nMinor league baseball in Wellington, Kansas began with the 1887 Wellington \"Browns,\" who won a championship in a shortened season. The Browns won the league championship as charter members of the six–team Independent level Kansas State League, which reduced to four teams during the season.

The team was coached by Ray Marchand in his 3rd season.\nSeason.\nEntering the season with most of the previous team's starters still enrolled, Army had high hopes for the team in 1926 and arranged their schedule accordingly. Several strong team were engaged for a trip to West Point and the Cadets were preparing for a hard test throughout the year. Unfortunately, as luck would have it, the weather was not accommodating. The Cadets were unable to get Stuart Rink up and running in December and were forced to trek south to Bear Mountain and use the artificial rink there. Infrequent practices occurred over a two-week period before the first game, by which time Stuart had become usable. Even with a full series of practices under their belt, Army would have been hard pressed to win their first match. Dartmouth demonstrated that they were one of the best teams from the start of their season and they continued that trend by rolling over the Cadets.\nArmy got their first win of the season against Bates the following week but it didn't come easy. After surrendering a 2-goal lead to the Bobcats, Scheiffler netted the winning goal with a few minutes left in the game. The next game on Army's schedule was against Boston College, however, BC does not record the game as having taken place. Contemporary news accounts show that the team was worried about the condition of the ice prior to the match but makes no reference to the game afterwards. Its possible that a junior varsity squad was sent in their place, particularly since Army referred to the team as being full of players whose last names began with 'Mc' and 'O' while only one of the Eagles' regular players fell into that category.\nThe Cadets evened their record a second time with a win over Amherst and then a snowstorm dumped several feet of snow on West Point. Since the snow couldn't be cleared off of the rink in time, Army was forced back to Bear Mountain for their game against Boston University. Snowfall affected the next game as well as the match with Massachusetts Agricultural College was limited to just 2 periods. Army's losing streak ran to 3 games with a loss to Syracuse a few days later but the rink began to become rough afterwards. In the contest against Middlebury, which had been rescheduled from January 20 due to a lack of ice, was severely slowed by bad ice. Only one goal could be scored, early in the game, but fortunately for the Cadets it was from the stick of Heidner. Army ended their season against Williams and were shut down by the Ephs.\nThe game against Royal Military College was cancelled due to the death of one of the Paladins players.\nCharles Sloane served as the team's manager.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n&lt;br&gt;"

The defending champion Natalie Geisenberger of Germany won the event and became thereby the first ever triple Olympic champion in women's luge. This is her fifth Olympic gold medal. Her compatriot Anna Berreiter won the silver medal, and Tatiana Ivanova, representing the Russian Olympic Committee, the bronze. This was the first Olympic medal for Berreiter and first individual medal for Ivanova, who already has the silver for the 2014 team relay.\nIn the 2021–22 Luge World Cup, Geisenberger was third, though she won the last race of the season before the Olympics. Julia Taubitz won the World Cup, with Madeleine Egle finishing second. The silver medalist at the 2018 Olympics, Dajana Eitberger, missed a season due to childbirth; she then returned to competitions, but finished outside of the top-10 in the World Cup and did not qualify for the Olympics. The 2018 bronze medalist, Alex Gough, retired from competitions.\nTaubitz won the first run, setting the track record, but crashed in the second run, dropping out of the medal contention. Egle made a mistake in the first run, and after two runs was only seventh. This left Geisenberger in lead after two runs, with Anna Berreiter second and Tatiana Ivanova third. In the third run, Geisenberger set the new track record. Whereas Egle managed to fight back to the fourth position, the last run did not change the medal distribution.\nQualification.\nThe qualification is based on the cumulative points of the Olympic Season from 1 July 2021 to January 10, 2022. A total of 35 quota spots are available to athletes to compete at the games. Each NOC can enter a maximum of three athletes.\nIn the women's singles, all nations with an athlete in the top 40 qualified one slot. If there were remaining spots left, the second best athlete of each nation in the top 32 was awarded an additional quota, with the third best being awarded a quota if there were any remaining spots.\nOn December 17, 2021, the International Luge Federation announced that the qualification system was changed. The qualification system was changed due to training runs being cancelled at the first World Cup, and equipment not being delivered to the following World Cups. The new system will see athletes qualify based on their top four results during the World Cup season, (as opposed to the previous all seven results counting).\nOn January 19, 2022 the International Luge Federation announced the list of qualified athletes."

        "text": "Charlie Edward Moore (born February 3, 1998) is an American basketball player for Pistoia Basket 2000 of the Lega Basket Serie A (LBA), whose college basketball career spanned four major conferences culminating with a year for the Miami Hurricanes of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) during the 2021–22 ACC basketball season. He previously played a full season for the California Golden Bears and the Kansas Jayhawks as well as two seasons for the DePaul Blue Demons. At Morgan Park High School he won two Illinois High School Association (IHSA) state championships and Illinois Mr. Basketball.\nIn college, he led the Big East Conference in assists playing for the 2019–20 DePaul Blue Demons. That season, he set the Wintrust Arena single-game assists record (13). Later, he helped the 2021–22 Miami Hurricanes become the first team in school history to reach the Elite Eight at the 2022 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. That season he earned All-ACC defensive team and All-ACC honorable mention recognition.\nEarly life.\nMoore is the son of Curis and Tanya Moore. Moore's father started training him to dribble at age 3 and continued training his ball handling skills as he was growing up. He was raised in Chicago's Englewood Community area. Moore was part of back-to-back IHSA Class 3A state champions in 2013 and 2014 at Morgan Park High School. As a freshman for the 2012–2013, team he served as backup to senior Billy Garrett Jr. In both the 2014 state semifinals against Orr Academy High School and the championship game against Lincoln High School of his sophomore season, he contributed 12 points as one of three double digit scorers for Morgan Park. As a junior, he teamed with Marcus LoVett Jr. for Morgan Park's third place finish in the state tournament. They lost to Jordan Goodwin and Tarkus Ferguson of Althoff Catholic High School in the IHSA Class 3A semi-finals. They defeated Rockford Lutheran High School in the consolation game.\nIn November 2015, Moore, who was at the time the top recruit in Illinois and the number 57 recruit in the national class of 2016 according to Rivals.com, committed to play for head coach Josh Pastner (and assistant coach Damon Stoudamire) at Memphis, becoming the first Chicago area player to commit to Memphis since Derrick Rose. As a senior, he was joined by sophomore transfer Ayo Dosunmu who played a supporting role. Morgan Park was defeated in the supersectional round of the IHSA tournament by Lincoln-Way West High School, but not before Moore established school career records with points (2,346), assists (368) and steals (303). Moore won Illinois Mr. Basketball in 2016 over Mike Smith and Zach Norvell Jr. after averaging 28 points, seven assists, five steals and four rebounds. Less than 2 weeks later, Pastner was hired by Georgia Tech. Moore immediately decommitted from Memphis. He considered offers from California, Georgia Tech, Illinois, LSU, Miami, SMU, UNLV and Western Kentucky. Six weeks later, he signed to play at Cal for Cuonzo Martin after center Ivan Rabb decided not to declare for the 2016 NBA draft. According to an article in \"The Daily Californian\", at that point in his career, Moore was regarded as a scorer and playmaker who would have to learn how to excel on defense to succeed at a higher level. Nonetheless, he was the highlight of his recruiting class for the 2016–17 Cal Bears and would help replace production lost in the backcourt with the departures of Jaylen Brown and Tyrone Wallace.\nCollege career.\nIn his second game at Cal, with three starters sidelined due to injuries, Moore broke Shareef Abdur-Rahim's 1995 single-game freshman scoring school record of 33 points by scoring 38 in an overtime win against UC Irvine. As a freshman, Moore was the only player to start all 34 games for Cal and led the team in assists and steals, while scoring 12.2 points per game. Following the season, Martin was hired by Missouri. Subsequently, with Rabb entering the 2017 NBA draft and Jabari Bird graduating, Moore transferred to Kansas.\nAccording to NCAA transfer rules, Moore sat out a season before joining the 2018–19 Kansas Jayhawks, which had guards Devon Dotson, Marcus Garrett, Ochai Agbaji, LaGerald Vick and Quentin Grimes. Moore's only start of the season was December 8 against New Mexico State. On December 18, 2018, with Udoka Azubuike sidelined and Dedric Lawson somewhat limited by foul trouble, Moore scored a season-high 18 points (all on three point shots) against South Dakota. Following the season, he announced he would be transferring to be closer to family. By this time, his father had health issues, and Moore transferred to hometown DePaul University.\nA month before the season was to begin, Moore received a waiver to play immediately for the 2019–20 DePaul Blue Demons. On November 26, 2019, Moore tallied 13 assists against the Central Michigan Chippewas, establishing the Wintrust Arena single-game assists record. During the COVID-19 pandemic-shortened 2019–20 NCAA Division I men's basketball season, Moore fell 4 assists shy of joining Rod Strickland (1987–88) as the only Blue Demons with 400 points and 200 assists in a season. Nonetheless, he was only player in the Big East Conference to place in the top ten in scoring (8th), assists (1st) and steals (6th). Moore began the 2020–21 DePaul Blue Demons season as a pre-season All-2020–21 Big East Conference first team selection. Moore picked up Big East player of the week honors on February 21, 2021. Following the season, which was the fifth consecutive year in with DePaul finished last in the Big East, DePaul fired head coach Dave Leitao. That summer when the Big East recognized its 2020–21 scholar athletes, Moore was recognized as an All-Academic team selection.\nWith the NCAA having granted an additional year of eligibility to all players due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Moore elected to transfer to play for the 2021–22 Miami Hurricanes where Chris Lykes had just vacated the point guard role and he had relationships with head coach Jim Larranaga and assistant coach Bill Courtney. Following the regular season Moore joined teammates Kameron McGusty and Isaiah Wong on the All-ACC basketball team. Moore earned All-Defensive team and honorable mention All-ACC recognition. Moore, fellow 6th-year senior McGusty and Wong are all or shorter. In the first round of the 2022 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, Moore contributed 16 points, including the go-ahead free throws with 3.0 seconds left, to give Miami a 68–66 victory over USC. Moore contributed 15 points, 9 rebounds and 8 assists in the second round upset of number 2 seed Auburn. Once Miami got to the Sweet Sixteen round, they found themselves playing at Moore's hometown United Center, where they defeated Iowa State to reach the Elite Eight for the first time in school history. Playing again at the United Center, Miami was matched up against the 2021–22 version of the Kansas Jayhawks, one of Moore's previous teams. The Jayhawks included Moore's former teammate Agbaji. Kansas won the game, and they went on to win the 2022 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Game. For the season, Moore led the Hurricanes in assists (4.5/game) and steals (2.0/game), and he contributed 12.7 points/game. His 2.0 steals/game was second in the ACC to Reece Beekman. Moore was recognized as an All-ACC Academic Team selection.\nProfessional career.\nMoore was not invited to the May 18–20, 2022 NBA draft combine. On June 24, 2022, Moore signed an NBA Summer League contract with the Detroit Pistons after going undrafted in the June 23, 2022 NBA draft.\nOn July 24, 2022, Moore signed his first professional contract with Belfius Mons-Hainaut of the BNXT League.\nOn July 28, 2023, he signed with Pistoia Basket 2000 of the Lega Basket Serie A (LBA)."

        "text": "Steve Freeman is an American men's college ice hockey coach. He has been the men's ice hockey head coach at Wisconsin–River Falls since 1996.\nEarly life and education.\nFreeman was born in New Brighton, Minnesota. In his youth, he played on the hockey team at Irondale High School and for the Minneapolis Junior Bruins. He earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point and a master's degree in education and professional development from University of Wisconsin–River Falls.\nCareer.\nAfter graduating from college, Freeman became the head coach at Stevens Point Area Senior High School (SPASH) and led the team to four conference championships. The performance brought Freeman recognition for his talent and he was brought in as the head coach/GM of the Dubuque Fighting Saints. After two rather poor years with the team, Freeman left and became an assistant at University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point&lt;br&gt;University of Wisconsin–River Falls under Dean Talafous. While there, he earned a master's in education and helped the Falcons win the 1994 NCAA Championship, defeating previously unbeaten Fredonia State in the semifinals.\nAfter Talafous left in 1996, Freeman was promoted to head coach and had remained in that position since (as of 2021). Freeman's teams were often the second best in the NCHA but, because of the small number of at-large bids available, that wasn't always enough to earn the Falcons an appearance in the NCAA Tournament. River Falls made the Frozen four in 2001 but the team had spent most of the time in the shadow of the conference's dominant power, St. Norbert.\nIn 2013, all five active WIAC teams left to form a new conference when the WIAC began sponsoring ice hockey as a sport. While this did provide more opportunity for Freeman's team, it also came at a price. Because the new conference didn't possess the minimum number of teams required to receive an automatic tournament berth (7), WIAC teams could only qualify for the national tournament based upon their record. Because of this, even when the Falcons won the conference championship in 2015 they were left sitting on the sidelines because the NCAA tournament didn't have to invite River Falls. Instead, Wisconsin–Stevens Point, who had won the regular season title and finished as the conference runners-up, were selected to participate.\nIn 2021, with many Division III teams not playing due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Freeman led the Falcons to a conference title in an abbreviated season. Before the team could play their first playoff game, virus protocols forced the team to withdraw from the tournament.\nFreeman was inducted into the Wisconsin Sports Hall of Fame in 2016."

        "text": "Daniel Thomas Fisher (born March 19, 1976) is an American retired indoor and beach volleyball player. He is the current head coach of the University of Pittsburgh women's volleyball team.\nPersonal life.\nFisher is a native of Goleta, California. He graduated from Pacific in 1999 with a major in sociology and minor in religious studies. In 2008, he returned to Pacific as an assistant coach on the men and women's team and simultaneously earned a master's degree in sport science.\nFisher is married to Joni Fisher. They have a daughter, Eden, and son, Max. Fisher enjoys playing the guitar/ukulele in his spare time.\nPlaying career.\nFisher began his collegiate volleyball career at Hawai'i where he played for two years. He transferred to Cal State Northridge but eventually left after playing for them for one year because they cut their men's volleyball program. He eventually settled on University of the Pacific and played for them until his graduation in 1999. After graduation, he played professionally in Europe for five years, including three in Spain and one season each in Belgium and Switzerland.\nFisher also represented team USA in both indoor and beach. He competed for five years on the AVP Professional Beach Volleyball Tour earning a pair of 13th-place finishes. He also represented team USA on the indoor side during tournaments in Japan and France in 2000 and 2001.\nCoaching career.\nFisher began his coaching career overseas, coaching Club Volleyball Menen for the 1999–2000 season and later spent the 2003–04 season coaching the Volleyball Club Appenzell Gotten Girl's Youth in Switzerland. Fisher also coached the Club Santa Barbara 16's in 2002. Prior to becoming a head coach, Fisher had various assistant coaching roles with multiple teams including San Francisco, Hawai'i, Pacific and the U.S. men's and women's national teams. He led the U.S. women's national team to a gold medal in the 2015 Pan American games and a bronze medal in the 2016 Pan American Cup.\nConcordia Irvine.\nFisher's first collegiate head coach job took him to Concordia University Irvine, where he led the team to two straight appearances in the NAIA National Championship match, winning the title in 2012. In his two years at Concordia, his teams went undefeated in conference play and had an overall 75–2 record.\nHis first season performance captured the attention of the volleyball community. The following summer, Hugh McCutcheon invited him to serve as an assistant with Team USA at the 2012 Pan American Cup, where he also coached alongside Hall of Fame coach Mike Hebert. After helping Team USA to a gold medal in the tournament, Hebert pulled Fisher aside and said he would put a good word in for him if he ever decided to try to go for a coaching job in a NCAA Division I school. After leading Concordia to the NAIA National Championship in 2012, Division I interest quickly started to build in Fisher.\nPittsburgh.\nIn 2013, Fisher was named the head coach for the women's volleyball team at Pittsburgh. When Fisher took the helm at Pittsburgh, they were not a program in contention for national rankings and had not reached an NCAA Tournament since 2004.\nIn his first season, the Panthers began to show strength as they took then-No. 22 Purdue to five sets. He guided Pittsburgh to its highest totals in the following categories since 2009: hitting percentage (.230), kills/set (13.27), total kills (1725), assists/set (12.58), total assists (1635) and total aces (208) The Panthers chipped away for the next couple of seasons and reached the NCAA Tournament in 2016, their first trip since 2004. Then, Fisher led the Panthers to three straight ACC conference titles in 2017, 2018, and 2019. In 2020, despite the Panthers finishing 3rd in conference play, they advanced to the NCAA Elite Eight, the program's highest ever finish.\nIn 2021, Fisher led Pittsburgh to the first NCAA final four appearance in school history. The team defeated UMBC, Penn State, Kansas, and Purdue leading up the final four before losing to Nebraska by a score of 3–1. Pittsburgh finished the season with a 30–4 record. \nIn 2022, Pittsburgh was the Co-ACC champions with Louisville, going 17–1 in conference play and advanced to its second straight NCAA final four, eliminating defending 2021 NCAA champion Wisconsin in the Elite Eight.\nIn 2023, Pitt shared the ACC Championship with Florida State, going 16-2 in conference play and advanced to its third consecutive NCAA Final Four. The Panthers defeated Louisville in a reverse sweep win the Elite Eight."

The tournament included both regional and departmental teams, and took place alongside the Women's Cricket Challenge Trophy.\nZarai Taraqiati Bank Limited were the most successful side in the history of the competition, with 7 titles. Karachi and Lahore are the only other sides to have won the competition, with 4 and 2 titles, respectively.\nHistory.\nThe National Women's Cricket Championship began in the 2004–05 season, with eight regional teams competing in Lahore across a week in March 2005. The tournament followed the creation of a women's wing of the Pakistan Cricket Board a year previously, and was hoped to spark greater interest in cricket amongst women. The competition was won by Karachi, who beat Lahore in the final by 6 wickets.\nThe tournament soon expanded, with Sialkot joining the following season and Abbottabad and Pakistan Universities the season after. Karachi and Lahore dominated the first four seasons of the competition, reaching the final every time, with Karachi winning three tournaments and Lahore one.\nFrom the 2009–10 season, new team Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited dominated the tournament, winning seven titles, one in every season they competed. In 2014, the only season in this period in which Zarai did not compete, Lahore claimed their second title, beating Karachi in the final. That year, the tournament was also renamed the Mohtarma Fatima Jinnah National Women's Cricket Championship, after the Pakistani politician.\nIn the final season of the tournament, 2017, the teams were split into two sections, one for regional teams and one for departmental teams, meaning there were two winners: Karachi won the Super League to win the regional section, whilst Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited beat the Higher Education Commission in the final of the departmental round. In 2017–18, the tournament was replaced by the PCB Triangular One Day Women's Tournament, with composite rather than geographical or departmental teams.\nMatches in the tournament were predominantly played using a limited overs format with 50 overs per side, apart from in the first two seasons, where matches could also be either 30, 35 or 40 overs per side. The tournament had various formats over the years, but generally involved teams divided into an initial group stage, with the top performing teams progressing to a secondary group stage before the winners of these groups progressed to the final."

The tournament took place across three days in January 2012, in Lahore, with six teams competing in two groups of three.

Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited and Omar Associates reached the final, which was rained off after 11.2 overs. The title was therefore shared between the two sides.\nIn 2015–16, the teams were joined by State Bank of Pakistan, who subsequently reached the final. There, they were beaten by Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited by 70 runs. In the final season of the tournament, 2016–17, four teams competed: Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited, State Bank of Pakistan, Higher Education Commission and a PCB XI. State Bank of Pakistan and Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited again reached the final, and Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited again emerged victorious, winning their fifth title. In 2018, the tournament was replaced by the Departmental T20 Women's Championship."

Clarkson began its program almost 20 years later and while RPI was one of the nearest potential opponents, the two didn't meet until Clarkson's 5th season of play. Due to a combination of several circumstances, including a limited schedule for both teams and RPI suspending its program for most of the 1930s and 40s, the two did not meet again until 1951. The second match occurred the same year that both schools founded the Tri-State League, the first official conference for NCAA ice hockey. Since then, the two have remained conference rivals, with both also being founding members of ECAC Hockey in 1961. Since 1953, Clarkson and Rensselaer have played one another at least twice every season until RPI was forced to cancel its entire 20–21 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nGame results.\nFull game results for the rivalry, with rankings beginning in the 1998–99 season."

Players who win all three tournaments over the course of their career are said to have won the PDC Triple Crown.\nThree professional players have won a career PDC Triple Crown: Phil Taylor, Michael van Gerwen, and Gary Anderson. Taylor has won the most Triple Crown titles, with 36, while van Gerwen has won 13 and Anderson 5. Only Taylor has won all three Triple Crown events in a single season, accomplishing this feat twice (in 2006 and 2010).\nHistory.\nIn 1994, the World Championship was held for the first time, with Dennis Priestley winning the first PDC Triple Crown event, the only such win of his career. Larry Butler became the first winner of the World Matchplay that same year, and this also the only Triple Crown event he won.\nIn 2005, the first Premier League was held, with 7 players taking part. The event was won by Phil Taylor, who became the first player to win a career PDC Triple Crown in the process.\nCareer Triple Crown winners.\nThree players have completed a career Triple Crown: Phil Taylor, Michael van Gerwen, and Gary Anderson. Only Taylor has won all three Triple Crown events in the same year, a feat he achieved twice, in 2006 and 2010. After winning the World Championship in 2017, van Gerwen held all 3 Triple Crown titles simultaneously (having won both the Premier League and the Matchplay in 2016).\nOther tournament winners.\nOne win away from Triple Crown.\nJames Wade has won the Premier League and World Matchplay once each, meaning he needs to win the World Championship to complete the Triple Crown. Peter Wright is yet to win the Premier League, but does have two World Championship titles and a World Matchplay title to his name. With three Triple Crown competition wins, he has the highest number of Triple Crown titles of any player who has not completed the set. Rob Cross also needs to win the Premier League to complete the Triple Crown having won the World Championship in 2018 and World Matchplay in 2019. Raymond van Barneveld has won the Premier League and World Championship once each, and needs to win a Matchplay to complete the set.\nWright, van Barneveld and Cross have all reached the final of their respective missing Triple Crown tournaments, whereas James Wade is a four-time World Championship semi-finalist."

        "text": "Benjamin David Johnson (born May 11, 1986) is an American football coach who is the offensive coordinator for the Detroit Lions of the National Football League (NFL). His NFL coaching career began as an assistant with the Miami Dolphins in 2012, coaching quarterbacks, tight ends, and wide receivers. Johnson later joined the Lions in 2019, rising to offensive coordinator in 2022 and leading the team to two top-five offenses. He was previously a walk-on quarterback at North Carolina in the mid-2000s.\nEarly life and college.\nJohnson was born on May 11, 1986, in Charleston, South Carolina. He attended and played quarterback at A. C. Reynolds High School in Asheville, North Carolina, where he was named conference player of the year as a senior and graduated in the top five of his class. Johnson was a walk-on for the Tar Heels at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2004, where he competed as a reserve quarterback behind T. J. Yates before graduating in 2008 with degrees in mathematics and computer science.\nCoaching.\nBoston College.\nInspired to get into coaching by his offensive coordinator at UNC, John Shoop, Johnson was hired as a graduate assistant for the Boston College Eagles in 2009. He was promoted to tight ends coach in 2011.\nMiami Dolphins.\nJohnson was hired as an offensive assistant for the Miami Dolphins in February 2012. He was promoted to assistant quarterbacks coach in 2013 and served as tight ends coach in 2015 after head coach Joe Philbin was fired following a 1–3 start. Johnson was named assistant wide receivers coach in 2017 and was promoted to wide receivers coach the following season.\nDetroit Lions.\nJohnson was hired as an offensive quality control coach for the Detroit Lions in 2019. He was promoted to tight ends coach in 2020 and was retained after Dan Campbell was named head coach in 2021. The same season, he would be promoted to pass game coordinator after Anthony Lynn was stripped of play-calling duties following an 0-8 start. Johnson was promoted again to offensive coordinator in February 2022, receiving head coaching interest by the end of the season after leading the Lions to a top five offense with eight games over 30 points, a single-season franchise record. \nHe remained in Detroit for the 2023 season, despite being heavily pursued by the Carolina Panthers, in which the team finished third in total offense, won the division for the first time since 1993, and won a playoff game for the first time since 1991. The Lions would later defeat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and would advance to the 2023 NFC Championship Game, but ultimately lost to the San Francisco 49ers. In both the NFC Divisional Round against the Bucs and the NFC Championship against the 49ers, Johnson's offense put up over thirty points and over 100 rushing yards. \nOn January 30, 2024 Johnson announced he would be returning to the Lions despite being considered a prime head coaching candidate for both the Washington Commanders and Seattle Seahawks.\nCoaching philosophy.\nJohnson cited his offensive scheme as being influenced by Kevin Rogers, Darrell Bevell, Adam Gase, Clyde Christensen, and Mike Martz."

        "text": "The women's singles competition in figure skating at the 2022 Winter Olympics was held on 15 February (short program) and 17 February (free skating), at the Capital Indoor Stadium in Haidian District of Beijing. Anna Shcherbakova, representing the Russian Olympic Committee, won the event, and her teammate, Alexandra Trusova, the silver medal. Kaori Sakamoto of Japan won bronze. For all, it was their first individual Olympic medals; Sakamoto had earlier won a medal in the team event.\nEvent summary.\nAll three medalists from the 2018 Olympics either retired from competition (Evgenia Medvedeva, Kaetlyn Osmond) or had taken a prolonged break from the sport without an official retirement announcement (Alina Zagitova). The 2021–22 season was dominated by Russian skaters, who held the six highest scores prior to the Olympics. Of those six, Kamila Valieva, Anna Shcherbakova, and Alexandra Trusova were selected for the Olympics. Kaori Sakamoto in seventh was the highest non-Russian skater on the list. Valieva dominated the Olympic season, winning every competition she entered and with her lowest international score still over 10 points higher than that of any of her competitors. Her undefeated season coupled with her status as the world record holder in all three segments saw her deemed the heavy favorite to win the Olympics prior to her becoming subject to a doping investigation. With Shcherbakova the 2021 World champion and Trusova the 2021 World bronze medalist, predictions considered a sweep by the ROC the most likely scenario.\nShcherbakova won the short program, with Sakamoto second and Trusova third; Valieva originally won but was disqualified retroactively by the Court of Arbitration for Sport in 2024 for a doping violation. Trusova won the free skate and became the first woman to land five quadruple jumps in the same program. Valieva and Shcherbakova were the only other competitors to attempt quadruple jumps, and Shcherbakova and Trusova were the first women to land a quad in the Olympics; Valieva held that distinction before her disqualification, as she had done some quads during the team event free skate one week earlier. Out of her five quads, Trusova landed only two cleanly, with her Quad Flip receiving an edge call. Shcherbakova landed two quadruple jumps, both cleanly. Valieva, skating last, fell twice, made a number of other mistakes, and dropped to fourth place overall; her subsequent disqualification moved all competitors below her up a place.\nDoping controversy.\nOn 8 February, a day after the ROC victory in the team event, a positive test result for trimetazidine from the Russian Championships in December for Kamila Valieva of the ROC was released by a Swedish lab, and her participation at the Olympics became subject to a doping investigation. The Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled on 14 February that she would not be provisionally suspended and would be allowed to compete in the individual event as planned, still subject to further and ongoing investigation. The decision from the court was made on three grounds: (1) Due to her age, she is a \"Protected Person\" as per WADA Code, subject to different rules than adult athletes; (2) Athlete did not test positive during the Olympic Games in Beijing; (3) \"There were serious issues of untimely notification of the results, ... which impinged upon the Athlete's ability to establish certain legal requirements for her benefit\". In its decision, the CAS stated that preventing \"the Athlete from competing at the Olympic Games would cause her irreparable harm in these circumstances\". As a result, the IOC decided that, should Valieva win a medal, there would be no flower ceremony or medal ceremony held until the investigation into her doping case is over and there is a concrete decision whether or not to strip her of her medals. To allow for the possibility that her results might be disqualified, the IOC asked the ISU to expand the qualifying field for the free skating by one to 25, contingent upon Valieva being one of the top 24 skaters after the short program.\nOn 15 February, after the short program, \"The New York Times\" reported that Valieva's sample tested positive for an additional two substances, hypoxen and L-Carnitine, which are not on the banned list, in addition to trimetazidine. WADA's filing in Valieva's hearing indicated that her acknowledgement of taking the two permitted substances undercut her testimony that the banned substance was ingested by error. By the end of the Beijing Olympics, a total five athletes were reported for doping violations.\nIn mid-November, WADA requested that CAS take up the review of the Valieva case with an eye towards a 4-year suspension of Valieva, which would exclude her from competition at the next Winter Olympics, and to rescind her first place performance in the team event at the previous Beijing Olympics because, \"the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) did not meet a WADA-imposed Nov. 4 deadline to deliver a verdict on Valieva's case.\"\nReactions.\nThe CAS decision to allow Valieva to compete despite her positive test drew backlash across the sporting community and in the media, with some questioning as to whether Russia had been adequately punished for their statewide doping program. While the United States Olympic &amp; Paralympic Committee and the Canadian Olympic Committee blasted the decision as a \"disappointment\" and \"extremely unfortunate\", the Russian Olympic Committee vowed to take \"comprehensive measures\" to \"keep the honestly won Olympic gold medal [in the team event]\". Condemnation of the CAS decision also came from former and current figure skaters alike on social media, although several of Valieva's teammates defended her. Several American skaters noted parallels with the case of U.S. pairs skater Jessica Calalang, who served an eight-month suspension from competition while under investigation for a positive doping test; Calalang was later absolved of any violations after the substance was concluded to be a metabolite of ingredients in her makeup, but she and her partner missed several key competitions during her suspension, including the 2021 World Figure Skating Championships. Some commenting on the situation suggested that blame should not rest with the 15-year-old Valieva, but rather with the Russian system and the coaches and doctors around her. Due to Valieva being a minor, both the World Anti-Doping Agency and the Russian Anti-Doping Agency have launched investigations into her entourage, including coach Eteri Tutberidze and Russian team doctor Filipp Shvetsky. The Russian government and community remained steadfast in their support for Valieva; the Kremlin first referred to the situation as a \"misunderstanding\", and later issued the following statement: \"We boundlessly and fully support Kamila Valieva and call on everyone to support her. And we say to Kamila: don't hide your face. You are a Russian — perform and defeat everybody!\"\nOn 15 February, after the short program, competitors asked about Valieva in the mixed zone largely tried to distance themselves from the situation, indicating that they preferred to focus on their own performances. A few athletes made general references about supporting \"clean sport\" and a \"level playing field\". Some expressed regret that no medal ceremony for the team event, and potentially the individual event, would be held; the individual event medal ceremony was eventually held as planned after Valieva placed outside the top three. Valieva herself did not speak with reporters in the mixed zone or attend the press conference for the top three after the short program, where fellow top finishers Anna Shcherbakova and Kaori Sakamoto also declined to comment. IOC spokesman Mark Adams noted that press conferences are not mandatory at the Olympics, and that if Valieva were to medal, they did not expect her to attend that press conference either. Valieva ultimately finished off the podium in fourth; she did not stop in the mixed zone after the free skating.\nIn a press conference the day after the free skating, IOC president Thomas Bach said he was \"very, very disturbed\" by the \"chilling atmosphere\" surrounding Valieva as coach Eteri Tutberidze berated her following a mistake-filled performance that dropped her off the podium. Bach also insinuated that her coaches likely played a role in her positive test, saying that \"doping is very rarely done alone with the athletes,\" and that \"the ones who have administered this drug in her body, these are the ones who are guilty.\" The Kremlin responded that \"harshness of a coach in high-level sport is key for their athletes to achieve victories\" and that Tutberidze's athletes were seeing strong results. Tutberidze herself claimed to be \"at a loss from the assessment of our work by the esteemed Mr Bach\" in a comment on an Instagram post by fellow ROC coach Alexander Zhulin. Several Western media outlets pointed to the extreme emotional reactions of the three ROC skaters – Shcherbakova (gold) stated that she felt empty inside, Trusova (silver) was seen shouting that she \"hated the sport\" and pledged to never skate again, and Valieva (fourth) broke down sobbing – as further evidence of the extreme pressure they were all under to deliver results, as well as the abuse they were subjected to from their team.\nBy 9 March 2022, Travis Tygart of the USADA reported that Valieva had not requested that her \"B\" sample be tested, apparently accepting the results of initial testing and relying on her explanation that the banned substance TMZ belonged to her grandfather and only accidentally contaminated or became mixed into her own use of allowed nutrients and supplements. Tygart further stated that as a minor Valieva could still be either fully exculpated or given a warning concerning her testing positive depending on the extent of findings in the on-going RUSADA investigation of doping. According to Tygart, an adverse finding against her as a first offense could still be assessed as a two year suspension, which is half of the suspension time which could be assessed for adults.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the existing ISU best scores were:\nNo new best scores were set during this competition.\nResults.\nShort program.\nThe short program was held on 15 February.\nFree skating.\nThe free skating was held on 17 February.\nOverall.\nThe skaters were ranked according to their overall score."

Victoria Sinitsina / Nikita Katsalapov had the second-highest score of the season and are the 2021 World champions, where Papadakis/Cizeron did not compete. In ice dance, the possibility of major error is small, and the scores at the Olympics are typically consistent with the scores throughout the Olympic season; as a result, Papadakis/Cizeron and Sinitsina/Katsalapov were considered the main gold contenders, with Papadakis/Cizeron the favorites.\nPapadakis/Cizeron broke their own world record in the rhythm dance to take a two-point lead over Sinitsina/Katsalapov into the free dance, which Papadakis/Cizeron then won by 5 points and narrowly missed breaking their own world record. Their combined total score was a new world record and they won the gold medal by 6.5 points ahead of Sinitsina/Katsalapov.

        "text": "The team event in figure skating at the 2022 Winter Olympics was held on 4, 6, and 7 February, at the Capital Indoor Stadium in Haidian District of Beijing.\nSummary.\nThe 2018 team event gold was won by Canada, with the Russian Olympic Committee placing second, and the United States placing third. Canadian 2018 Olympic champion Eric Radford returned, but this time he competed with a new partner, Vanessa James.\nIn 2022, the Russian Olympic Committee (competing under its own flag, not Russia's, and hence hereafter abbreviated as \"ROC\") entered the team event as the favorite, with the United States, Canada, and Japan also expected to be in medal contention. The ROC decided to enter their top skaters for both the short program and free skating and initially won the event nine points ahead of the United States, who initially took silver, while Japan initially won the bronze medal.\nThe medal ceremony originally scheduled for Tuesday, 8 February, was delayed over what International Olympic Committee (IOC) spokesperson Mark Adams described as a situation that required \"legal consultation\" with the International Skating Union. Several media outlets reported on Wednesday that the issue was over a positive test, held in December 2021, for trimetazidine by the ROC's Kamila Valieva, which was officially confirmed on February 11. The results are pending investigation. The Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA), under suspension from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) since 2015 for its years of serving solely to hide the positive doping results of Russian athletes, cleared Valieva on February 9, a day after the December test results were released, two months after the test. The IOC, WADA, and International Skating Union (ISU) are appealing RUSADA's decision.\nOn February 14, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruled that Valieva should be allowed to compete in the women's single event, deciding that preventing her from competing \"would cause her irreparable harm in the circumstances\", though her gold medal in the team event was still under consideration. The favorable decision from the court was made in part due to her age, as minor athletes are subject to different rules than adult athletes. The IOC announced that the medal ceremony would not take place until the investigation is over and there is a concrete decision whether to strip Russia of their medals. As of , the medals of the team event have not been awarded.\nIn mid-November, WADA requested that CAS take up the review of the Valieva case with an eye towards a 4-year suspension of Valieva, which would exclude her from competition at the next Winter Olympics, and to rescind her first-place performance at the previous Beijing Olympics because, \"the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) did not meet a WADA-imposed Nov. 4 deadline to deliver a verdict on Valiyeva's case.\"\nUnder IOC rules, the medals will be awarded as if it was a reallocation ceremony. Based on the exhaustion of all appeals, the IOC could hold the ceremony at Mediolanum Forum during the 2026 Winter Olympics the IOC headquarters or Olympic Museum in Lausanne, or the 2025 World Figure Skating Championships, scheduled for TD Garden in Boston, Massachusetts (United States).\nOn 29 January 2024, the CAS disqualified Valieva for four years retroactive to 25 December 2021 for an anti-doping rule violation they found her to have committed. On 30 January 2024, the ISU, among other actions, reallocated medals in the 2022 Winter Olympics figure skating team event, upgrading the United States and Japan to gold and silver while downgrading ROC to bronze, a decision that awaits official ratification by the IOC. Canada, believing it should receive the bronze medal instead, accused the ISU of not following its own rule, which requires that competitors have their placements move up after any competitor who placed higher is disqualified. In a statement on 9 February, the ISU contended that the rule did not apply in this case and that \"In any complex and extraordinary situation like this, the reallocation of points could negatively affect the relative team ranking, adversely impacting teams that had nothing to do with the incident in question\". In four appeals, with no hearing date set as of 26 February, the Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) (along with the Canadian team members) and Russia appealed the decision to CAS by 26 February, with one appeal by the COC requesting that two points (one for each affected event) be added to each of the top four teams other than Russia (the United States, Canada, Japan, and China), thus giving Canada bronze, and three Russian appeals (one each by the ROC, the Russian Figure Skating Federation, and the Russian team members, including Valieva) requesting reinstatement of the gold medal; all four appeals name the ISU as defendant, with the Canadian appeal additionally including all three Russia appellants and the IOC as defendants.\nQualification.\nOn the issue of the disqualification of participating athletes at the Winter Olympics, the ISU has issued a statement regarding its policy regarding doping violations which may be alleged for the duration of the events of the Games stating that the “International Skating Union cannot disclose any information about a possible anti-doping rule violation. This is regulated by the ISU anti-doping rules and the IOC anti-doping rules for the Beijing 2022 Olympics.”\nEntries.\nMember nations submitted the following entries:\nResults.\nShort programs/rhythm dance.\nMen.\nThe men's short program was held on 4 February 2022.\nPairs.\nThe pairs short program was held on 4 February 2022.\nIce dance.\nThe ice dance rhythm dance was held on 4 February 2022.\nWomen.\nThe women's short program was held on 6 February 2022.\nFree skates/dance.\nMen.\nThe men's free skate was held on 6 February 2022.\nPairs.\nThe pairs free skate was held on 7 February 2022.\nIce dance.\nThe ice dance free dance was held on 7 February 2022.\nWomen.\nThe women's free skate was held on 7 February 2022.\nOverall.\nTeam overall.\nThe top five teams at the end of the short programs/rhythm dance advanced to the free skates/dance."

Historically, Curly Lambeau has been credited as being the Packers' that year, although this is primarily due to the different rules of American football in the early 1900s. In Hoeffel's era, the head coach was not allowed to communicate with the players while they were playing a game. Lambeau, as team captain, would call the plays during a game and also organized practices, tasks that are now allocated to the head coaching position.\nHoffel played college football for Wisconsin, being an All-America selection by Walter Camp in 1912. He played the end position.\nEarly life and education.\nHoeffel was born on October 31, 1890, in Green Bay, Wisconsin. He attended Green Bay East High School and was a \"star player\" for their football team. He was team captain as a senior. After graduating in 1908, he joined the University of Wisconsin.\nThough he did not see much action as a freshman, Hoeffel became a varsity member in 1909, earning a letter. \"Too small to capture a backfield spot at Wisconsin but too good to be ignored,\" he became an end. \"Three physical qualities made him a great player,\" wrote Jack Rudolph of the \"Green Bay Press-Gazette\". \"He was fast, a deadly tackler, and he had a sense of timing that enabled him to get the jump on every play,\" the \"Press-Gazette\" reported.\nHoeffel continued as a letterman in the following two years, being named all-conference and all-western as a junior. He was named team captain as a senior, and earned the same honors again. He also was a second-team All-America selection by Walter Camp. The 1912 Wisconsin football team compiled an undefeated 7–0 record, winning the conference title.\nCoaching career.\nAfter graduating from the University of Wisconsin, Hoeffel became an assistant coach at Nebraska. He coached them for three years, before later assisting the staff of Green Bay East High School.\nIn , Hoeffel served as the head coach of the Green Bay Packers, a professional team in the American Professional Football Association (APFA) (now National Football League). The team compiled a record of 3–2–1, and Hoeffel did not return to the team in .\nHistorically, Curly Lambeau has been credited as being the Packers' in 1921, although this is primarily due to the different rules of American football in the early 1900s. In his era, the head coach was not allowed to communicate with the players while they were playing a game. Lambeau, as team captain, would call the plays during a game and also organized practices, tasks that are now given at the head coaching position.\nIn 2001, the \"Milwaukee Journal\" led an investigation studying the early Packers, finding through historical newspapers and Packer records that two coaches preceded Lambeau: Hoeffel and Willard Ryan. However, the Packers refused to recognize them as the head coaches. In an interview, Packers president Bob Harlan said, \"He (Lambeau) ran everything. Now, what his title was and what a title meant at that particular time, I'm really not comfortable saying. But he was the one running the show. Considering what he did, I'm a little reluctant to take away any significance to his career.\"\nLater life and death.\nAfter his sports career, Hoeffel became a businessman, operating the Joseph M. Hoeffel Sales Co. in Green Bay. He died on April 15, 1964, at his home in Green Bay. He was 73 at the time of his death."

        "text": "Boxing Day is a 2021 British romantic-comedy Christmas film written, directed by and starring Aml Ameen in his directorial debut. The film also stars Aja Naomi King and is the acting debut of Leigh-Anne Pinnock. Notably, it is the first British Christmas romantic comedy with an almost entirely Black cast.\nTaking place primarily in London, the film follows Melvin Mckenzie (Aml Ameen) as he returns home to London after two years to launch his new book and introduce his fiancée to his family. Ameen created \"Boxing Day\" to represent his own experiences growing up in England with his own Caribbean-British family. He draws on commonly seen tropes from other famous Christmas movies like \"Love Actually\".\nPlot.\nMelvin \"Smelly\" Mckenzie (Aml Ameen) is a British immigrant living in Los Angeles. After the release of his new book he is prompted to go back home to London for the first time in two years in order to promote his book.\nMelvin and his American almost-fiancée Lisa Dixon (Aja Naomi King) journey to London to meet his lovable but dysfunctional Caribbean-British family.\nWhile there, things become complicated by the presence of Melvin's ex-girlfriend and global superstar Georgia (Leigh-Anne Pinnock) who is still has unresolved feelings for him and is very close with the family he left behind.\nAt the hotel Lisa bumps into Georgia, neither one of them aware of their mutual lover. She fawns over the star, asking for a selfie which gets uploaded to Instagram, so Melvin's family see he's in town.\nWhen Melvin is on the TV chat show promoting his book, none other than Georgia (Gigi) is the musical guest. They hadn't seen each other since his parents announced their divorce that fateful Boxing Day, as he disappeared to LA. His sister Boobsy is there as well, as she's Gigi's manager.\nDirectly afterwards in the hotel lobby, Melvin and Lisa are trying to leave so he can talk to his mom about Lisa before everyone else arrives. She sees Georgia, and tries to introduce her to her fiancé Melvin. Seeing each other from afar, trying to avoid each other, they inadvertently and literally bump into each other.\nIn the car on the way to his mum Shirley's, Lisa chews Melvin out for not telling her his ex is the famous singer. Simultaneously Gigi is pouring out her heart to Boobsy, detailing the fantasy scenario she'd built up in her mind about reconciling with him.\nAt Shirley's, going through old photo albums, Lisa is shown that he and Gigi practically grew up together as their mums are best friends. Later, that night at Gigi's gig, Lisa realises that Gigi still has feelings for Melvin by the way she looks at him.\nLisa holds her own playing cards with the men of the family the next day. Gigi shows up with Boobsy, and the whole family is soon up and dancing together. There is a lot of tension between the two women, and when she sees the opportunity Gigi seeks out Melvin and kisses him. Lisa sees and leaves and when he follows, she announces she's accepting a job offer in New Zealand.\nWhen Gigi also leaves upset, an argument breaks out over Melvin's leaving two years ago. As tempers flare, Boobsy starts a food fight. Amidst the chaos, Shirley finally arrives with Richard to finally introduce him, but is so upset with the mess she sends everyone off except for Melvin. Alone, she tells him Lisa's pregnant.\nAt the hotel, Lisa sends Melvin off. He goes to his dad's bar, where he's convinced he could handle being a dad. So he tries to do a grand gesture with cards similar to Love Actually, but it fails. Similarly his brother tries to do a grand gesture with his crush, also unsuccessfully.\nAt Shirley's Christmas pageant, Richard and she finally make their relationship public.

She covers Dionne Warwick's \"I Say a Little Prayer\" and \"For the Love of You\" by The Isley Brothers. She also performs an original song that she co-wrote called \"Woman\".\nProduction.\n\"Boxing Day\" was created by Aml Ameen, loosely based on his own family. He co-wrote the script with Bruce Purnell. He originally planned to fund it himself to get it off the ground, but he met agents at Idris Elba's wedding who sent his script out to BFI and Film4. In addition to being Ameen's directorial debut, it is also Leigh-Anne Pinnock's acting debut. She joined the cast after being recommended to Ameen by Purnell. Ameen had been looking for someone who could sing, but was not familiar with Leigh-Anne or Little Mix at the time.\nThe film's production began in late summer of 2020. The movie was filmed on location in London for six weeks in November and December. They filmed during the COVID-19 lockdown in locations like South Bank, Carnaby Street, and The Jazz Café.\nRelease.\nThe trailer for \"Boxing Day\" dropped on October 6, 2021. It was debuted in theaters in the UK and Ireland on December 3, 2021, and was released in the US on Amazon Prime on December 17, 2021."

On 27 December 2020, he moved from within Vityaz to fellow Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) club, Avangard Omsk.\nDuring the 2021–22 season while in the VHL with affiliate Omskie Krylia, on 28 February 2022, Miroshnichenko signed a contract extension with Avangard that would have kept him playing in Russia until 2024.

        "text": "The men's slopestyle competition in snowboarding at the 2022 Winter Olympics was held on 6 February (qualification) and 7 February (final), at the Genting Snow Park in Zhangjiakou. Max Parrot of Canada became the Olympic champion. Su Yiming of China won the silver medal, whereas Mark McMorris of Canada replicated his success at the 2014 and 2018 Olympics by winning the bronze. For Parrot this is the first Olympic gold, and for Su the first Olympic medal. The scoring in the finals was mired in controversy after the judges admitted to missing a \"glaring error\" by Parrot that some speculate would have given Su Yiming the gold medal. The head snowboarding judge, Iztok Sumatic, later stated in an interview that the final scores was wrong due to the judging error, and that Su should have won the gold instead. However, because neither McMorris nor Su filed an official appeal, it had meant that the flawed results will not be changed.\nSummary.\nThe defending champion is Red Gerard. The 2018 silver medalist, Max Parrot, and the bronze medalist, Mark McMorris, qualified at the Olympics as well. At the 2021–22 FIS Snowboard World Cup, only three slopestyle events were held before the Olympics. Sébastien Toutant was leading the ranking, followed by Niek van der Velden and Su Yiming. Marcus Kleveland is the 2021 world champion, with Toutant and Rene Rinnekangas being the silver and bronze medalists, respectively. Dusty Henricksen is also the 2019 X-Games winner, ahead of Mons Røisland and Rinnekangas.\nQualification.\nA total of 30 snowboarders qualified to compete at the games. For an athlete to compete they must have a minimum of 50.00 FIS points in Big Air or Slopestyle on the FIS Points List on January 17, 2022, and a top 30 finish in a World Cup event in Big Air or slopestyle or at the FIS Snowboard World Championships 2021. A country could enter a maximum of four athletes into the event.\nResults.\nQualification.\nThe top 12 athletes in the qualifiers advanced to the Final.\nConcerns and controversies.\nThe medal results stirred controversy when Canada's Max Parrot, during his gold winning performance, grabbed his knee instead of the board. Replays showed him \"failing to grab his board and instead clutching around his lower leg, meaning that the maneuver was incomplete and should have been marked down.\" Despite this, the run was scored as a 90.96. In a later interview with snowboarding website Whitelines\",\" the head Olympic snowboard judge Iztok Sumatik explained that they were \"being pushed to be on time\" and that the judges did not get a replay of the trick. In the angle provided to the judges, the trick had looked clean.\nFans on social media had also complained that Su was \"robbed\" of the gold with inexplicable low-scoring by the judges even after Su had successfully completed both his first and second runs that included the first-ever completion of the \"1800\" trick in competition.\nDuring the coverage of the event, TV commentators were quick to notice the error in Parrot's gold medal run. Before the score was announced, Australian Channel 7 commentators Mitch Tomlinson and Ryan Tiene noticed that Parrot had missed grabbing his board twice and likely grabbed his leg to prevent getting injured. They said \"unfortunately for Max, he's going to have points deducted.\" However, when the score came out, they realized that the judges had missed the error and said \"that's not good for snowboarding.\"\nBBC commentator Ed Leigh pointed out that the knee grab was a \"cardinal sin\". In the BBC broadcast, Leigh said, \"Something like that should have cost Parrot two or three points... I looked at the sector scores afterwards - he got 9.35 out of 10. If they had spotted [the error], it would have been a six or a 6.5. There were three points between bronze and gold - that would have totally upended the podium.\" He went on to say that \"there is a glaring judging error putting Max Parrot in gold\" and that giving him the gold would be \"controversial.\" Online, people dubbed this knee-gate, and Whitelines said that it \"will go down in history a la Diego Maradona’s Hand Of God as one of the worst calls we’ll see in sport.\"\nMoreover, bronze medalist Mark McMorris felt he had the best run of the day, and should have been the gold medalist, \"but knowing that I kind of had the run of the day and one of the best rounds of my life and the whole industry knows what happened\". Parrot, acknowledged the error and still felt like he deserved the gold medal, \"But in the end, it's a judged sport and the fact is I had the most technical run of the day on pretty much every feature\". Lead judge for the event, Iztok Sumatic said, \"there are so many factors. All I can say, in Max's defence, regarding this specific run, is that it was still an insane run. He killed it, especially on the rails.\" Ultimately the blame lied with the organiziers, who failed to provide multiple angles of the event. Parrot reviewed the runs by the three medalists and, \"he spotted three \"little mistakes\" during McMorris' turn, and also noted a few errors by Su\", while Parrot, \"didn't have any mistakes on five of the six features, and on the one jump, I had a bigger mistake\"."

The ODI series formed part of the inaugural 2020–23 ICC Cricket World Cup Super League.\nOn 28 March 2022, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) confirmed the fixtures for the tour, with Rawalpindi initially hosting all three matches. The following month, the PCB also announced that the series would be played without any COVID-19 protocols, meaning that the series was played with no bio-secure bubble. However, in May 2022, the PCB moved all the matches to Multan, due to the ongoing political crisis in the country. The start times of the matches were also moved to 4pm local time to mitigate the impact of the extreme heat. The last time that the ground hosted an ODI match was in April 2008, during Bangladesh's tour of the country.\nPakistan won the opening ODI match by five wickets with their captain Babar Azam scoring a century. Pakistan won the second match by 120 runs to win the series with a match to play. It was also the West Indies' tenth-consecutive series loss to Pakistan in ODI cricket. The third and final ODI match was temporarily suspended during Pakistan's innings due to a dust storm. Despite the interruption, Pakistan went on to win the match by 53 runs, winning the series 3–0.\nSquads.\nThe day before the first ODI, Keemo Paul was added to the West Indies' squad."

Due to restrictions of excessive travel, only one of Andorra or Malta could be drawn with the winner of the Moldova v Kazakhstan play-out tie.\nGroups.\nThe fixture list was confirmed by UEFA on 17 December 2021, the day following the draw.\nTimes are CEST (), as listed by UEFA (local times, if different, are in parentheses).\nOverall ranking.\nThe seven League D teams were ranked 49th to 55th overall in the 2022–23 UEFA Nations League according to the following rules:\nEuro 2024 qualifying play-offs.\nUnlike the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying play-offs, the now-downsized League D did not have its own play-off path. Instead, if any of Leagues A, B, or C had fewer than four teams that did not qualify directly for Euro 2024, the best-ranked group winner of League D would advance to the play-offs (unless that team already qualified for Euro 2024). Any remaining spots were allocated based on the Nations League overall ranking, subject to the restriction that group winners from Leagues A, B, and C could not face teams from a higher league. Therefore, additional teams from League D could only advance to the playoffs if enough teams from League C qualified directly for the tournament.\nAs only two teams from League A failed to qualify for Euro 2024 directly, the best-ranked group winner of League D, Estonia, advanced to Path A of the play-offs.\nKey"

        "title": "William Inge (American football)",
        "text": "William Inge (born December 17, 1973), also known as Bill Ennis-Inge, is an American football coach and former player who currently serves at the linebackers coach at the University of Tennessee. He was the co-defensive coordinator and linebackers coach at the University of Washington from 2022–2023. Inge played football at the University of Iowa from 1993 to 1996, and has served in various assistant coach roles at the college and professional level for over twenty years.\nEarly life and playing career.\nWilliam Inge was born in Kirkwood, Missouri, to Beverly Ennis Inge and William Inge. He played football at Kirkwood High School and was a three-year starter at the University of Iowa under head coach Hayden Fry, playing defensive end there from 1993 to 1996. During his freshman year, his left kidney was surgically removed, and he played out his career with one kidney. Further adversity came during his senior year, when his father died suddenly of a heart attack at the age of 48. The Tennessee Oilers of the National Football League signed Inge as a free agent in 1997, but concerns about Inge's physical condition ended his career.\nCoaching career.\nInge began his coaching career in 1998 as a graduate assistant and recruiting coordinator at Iowa. Inge continued in that role in 1999 when Hayden Fry retired and Kirk Ferentz succeeded Fry as head coach. In 2001, Northern Iowa head coach Mark Farley, then in his first year, hired Inge as his linebackers coach. Inge spent the next four years at Northern Iowa, becoming the defensive line coach in 2003 and the co-defensive coordinator and special teams coach in 2004. He left Northern Iowa in 2005 to coach the defensive line at the University of Colorado under head coach Gary Barnett; the 2005 team posted a 7–6 record and Barnett resigned at the end of the season.\nNew San Diego State University head coach Chuck Long hired Inge to be linebackers coach, a position Inge held from 2006 to 2007. Inge was one of several former Iowa Hawkeyes on the staff under Long, himself a former coach and player there, although he and Inge did not overlap at the school. Inge left after the 2007 season to become linebackers coach at the University of Cincinnati under head coach Brian Kelly. Inge coached at Cincinnati for the 2008 and 2009 seasons, Kelly's final two at Cincinnati before taking the head coaching job at the University of Notre Dame.\nFollowing the 2009 season, Inge followed offensive coordinator Jeff Quinn to the University at Buffalo as defensive coordinator and linebackers coach. He participated in the NFL's Bill Walsh Minority Coaching Fellowship in 2011 and coached linebackers with Dave Wannstedt. In 2012, Inge joined Wannstedt on the defensive staff of the NFL's Buffalo Bills as assistant defensive line coach. Inge held the job for a single season before departing to join Kevin Wilson's staff at the Indiana University as co-defensive coordinator and linebackers coach. Inge remained at Indiana for seven years, remaining on staff after Tom Allen replaced at the end of the 2016 season. Inge held various titles during his tenure there, including special teams coordinator/linebackers coach (2016), linebackers coach (2017), and special teams coordinator (2018–2019).\nIndiana hired Fresno State's Kalen DeBoer to be offensive coordinator for the 2019 season. Following that season, DeBoer returned to Fresno State as its new head coach and took Inge with him as defensive coordinator. When DeBoer departed after the 2021 season to become head coach at the University of Washington, Inge again went with him as co-defensive coordinator (with Chuck Morrell) and safeties coach. Jedd Fisch succeeded DeBoer as head coach following the 2023 season, and Fisch hired Stephen Belichick as his defensive coordinator."

        "text": "The New Zealand cricket team toured Pakistan in April and May 2023 to play five One Day International (ODI) matches and five Twenty20 International (T20I) matches. The tour was to make up for the series that was postponed in September 2021. The ODI series was not part of the Super League. However, it formed part of both teams' preparations for the 2023 Cricket World Cup. \nIn April 2022, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) confirmed that the series would be taking place. In May 2022, New Zealand Cricket confirmed that they would compensate the PCB for the postponed series, as well as playing extra matches on the tour. In October 2022, the PCB announced the fixtures for the tour. In April 2023, the PCB announced the revised fixtures for the tour.\nPrior to this tour, New Zealand toured Pakistan in December 2022 and January 2023 to play two Test matches and three ODIs.\nPakistan defeated New Zealand by 88 runs in the first T20I, and went on to win the second T20I by 38 runs to lead the series 2–0. New Zealand won the third T20I by a margin of 4 runs to keep themselves alive in the series. The fourth T20I ended in a no result due to a hailstorm, with the series standing at 2–1. New Zealand won the last T20I by 6 wickets to level the series 2–2.\nPakistan won the first ODI by 5 wickets and went on to win the second ODI by 7 wickets to lead the series 2–0. Pakistan again won the third ODI by 26 runs to take the unassailable lead in the series, winning their first ODI series against New Zealand since 2011. Pakistan won the fourth ODI by 102 runs and moved a step towards series white-wash.\nSquads.\nPakistan named their full-strength squad for both the series, after resting their several senior players during three-match T20I series against Afghanistan which concluded in March 2023. Whereas, New Zealand were without their several first-choice players, due to either injury or playing in the 2023 Indian Premier League.\nOn 24 April 2023, Mohammad Haris was added to Pakistan's ODI squad. On 25 April 2023, Mark Chapman was added to New Zealand's ODI squad. Haris Sohail injured his left shoulder just before the start of ODI series, and was ruled out of Pakistan's ODI squad. On 29 April 2023, Iftikhar Ahmed was named as his replacement."

This will be the first time a mixed short track speed skating event is featured at the Olympics.\nIn July 2018, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) officially added the mixed relay to the Olympic program held over a distance of 2000 metres. Due to the addition of the event, the competition schedule was increased to six days from five.\nChina was favored after leading the 2021–22 ISU Short Track Speed Skating World Cup with four races completed before the Olympics, followed by the Netherlands and Hungary.\nThe Dutch team set an Olympic record in the quarterfinals, but after a fall finished last in their semifinal. South Korea did not advance to semifinals, also after a fall. In the semi-finals, the United States was disqualified for \"blocking by infield skater\" and the Russian Olympic Committee was disqualified because of \"extra team skater causing obstruction\", after finishing second and fourth, respectively. This resulted in China, who finished third in their semifinal, having been promoted to Final A.\nIn Final A, Hungary and Canada crashed in the first turn, forcing the officials to call a restart. In the repeat, Italy and China were leading more than halfway through the race when Canada's Florence Brunelle and Hungary's Petra Jaszapati collided, with both sliding off the course. Both teams recovered to finish the race, but after review, Canada received a penalty for a push from behind and Hungary finished at third place.\nChina won gold ahead of a late sprint by Italy’s Pietro Sighel at the finish line.\nQualification.\nThe top 12 countries qualified a relay through the 2021–22 ISU Short Track Speed Skating World Cup, including host nation China. If a county needed an additional quota spot to complete a relay, it was awarded an additional quota. Italy and the ROC were awarded an additional male athlete spot, while Kazakhstan and Poland were awarded an additional female spot.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows:\nThe following records were set during the competition:"

Today, Chesterfield Cricket Club's 1st and 2nd XI teams use the Queen's Park pitch, rated by the Derbyshire County Cricket League as a Grade A+ ground, and the club's 3rd XI team use a pitch south of Chesterfield on Deer Park, Wingerworth, rated as a Grade B ground. \nHistory.\nThe origins of Chesterfield Cricket Club go back to the 19th century with the New Recreation Ground on Saltergate listed as their home ground. A 3-day match was recorded at the ground between Chesterfield and the 'All England Eleven' in 1869. By 1894, the club was granted permission to move to Queen's Park and a record shows Chesterfield playing in the Derbyshire Cricket League against Creswell Colliery, on 28 April 1900. After the Second World War, Chesterfield became league champions six times between the year 1947 and 1957. Riding on their success, Chesterfield moved from the Derbyshire League and joined the Bassetlaw &amp; District Cricket League in 1958 before returning to Derbyshire in the Derbyshire Premier League in 1999. The following year, the league became an ECB accredited league, where Chesterfield became League Champions in 2008. In 2011, the club joined the Mansfield and District Cricket League with a Sunday 1st XI team, and became Section (Division) 1 Champions in 2021.\nThe club have three senior teams that compete on Saturdays in the Derbyshire County Cricket League, a Sunday XI in the Mansfield and District Cricket League and an established junior training section that play competitive cricket in the North Derbyshire Youth Cricket League.\nClub Performance.\nThe Derbyshire County Cricket League competition results showing the club's positions in the league (by Division) since 1999.\nThe Mansfield and District Cricket League Sunday League competition results showing the club's position (by Division) since 2011.\nNotable players.\nSome notable players that have represented club and county include:"

        "title": "2024 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup",
        "text": "The 2024 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup was the 12th edition of the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup, the premier international beach soccer championship contested by men's national teams of the member associations of FIFA. Overall, this was the 22nd edition of a world cup in beach soccer since the establishment of the \"Beach Soccer World Championships\" which ran from 1995 to 2004 but which was not governed by FIFA; all world cups took place annually until 2009 when it then became a biennial event.\nThis edition was originally set to be the 2023 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup; at the FIFA Beach Soccer Workshop in November 2017, it was announced that the World Cup would continue to be held biennially in odd-numbered years for the period 2018–2024. The bidding process for said edition was subsequently opened by FIFA in October 2021, concluding with the selection of the United Arab Emirates as the hosts in December 2022. The tournament was initially set to take place from 16 to 26 November 2023. However, in June 2023, the tournament was postponed until 15 to 25 February 2024, in order to provide more time to the organisers to prepare for the event. As a consequence, its original 2023 branding was dropped, and it subsequently became referred to as the 2024 edition. It took place in Dubai, the second city to host multiple times having also hosted the 2009 edition.\nRussia won the previous edition and should have therefore been the defending champions. However, all Russian national teams are currently banned indefinitely from competing in FIFA competitions, due to the country’s invasion of Ukraine. The tournament was won by Brazil, who claimed their sixth FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup title, beating Italy in the final who finished as runners-up for a third time.\nHost selection.\nThe original bidding schedule to determine the hosts was as follows:\nOn 8 December 2021, FIFA revealed that five associations had affirmed their bidding intentions:\nOn 14 February 2022, FIFA announced that three of the five associations had submitted bids through to the final stage of the process, with Colombia and Thailand withdrawing.\nConfirmation of the awarding of hosting rights was due to be announced at the FIFA Council meeting in Doha, Qatar on 31 March 2022. However, no announcement was made; it was then due to be awarded at its meeting in Auckland, New Zealand on 22 October 2022, but it was announced at the meeting that the decision had been deferred again until a subsequent Council meeting. At the next Council meeting on 16 December 2022, in Doha, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates was awarded the hosting rights to the 2023 tournament.\nQualification.\nA total of 16 teams qualified for the final tournament. In addition to the United Arab Emirates who qualified automatically as the host country, 15 other teams qualified from six separate continental competitions. The slot allocation was approved by the FIFA Council on 14 March 2023.\nThe process of qualification to the World Cup finals began in October 2022 and ended in August 2023.\n\"Note: The appearance statistics below refer only to the FIFA era of world cups in beach soccer (since 2005); see this article for the inclusion of World Championships era stats (1995–2004)\".\nVenue.\nOne venue was used in the city of Dubai. Despite being a coastal city with beaches, the stadium was located within the city's inland Design District; it was known by the name, \"Dubai Design District Stadium\". It hosted all 32 matches of the competition, with a capacity to accommodate almost 3,500 spectators. The stadium was a temporary construction built purposely for the competition; its construction took just 25 days compared with typical lengths of 60 to 90 days.\nDraw.\nThe draw to split the 16 teams into four groups of four took place at 18:30 GST () on 6 October 2023 at the Mohammed Bin Rashid Library in Dubai. The drawing of lots was performed by Bakhit Saad and Christian Karembeu. It was conducted under the following procedure:\nThe teams were first divided into four pots of four based upon a ranking created by FIFA considering each team's performances at the World Cup over the past five editions (since 2013); the more recent the tournament, the more weight was given to those results. Bonus points were also awarded to the teams that won their confederation's championship during qualifying. Using this ranking, the best-performing teams were placed in Pot 1 (plus the hosts), the next best performers were placed in Pot 2 and so on. This resulted in the following composition pots:\nThe draw started with Pot 1. As the hosts, the United Arab Emirates were automatically assigned to position A1. The highest-ranked team, Brazil, was automatically assigned to position D1. The other teams were then drawn – the first out was placed into Group B and the second, C. The teams from Pot 2 were then drawn – the first out was placed into Group A, second into B and so on. The same was repeated for Pots 3 and 4. The exact positions in the groups the teams were allocated to was determined by the drawing of lots from an auxiliary pot. Teams from the same confederation could not be drawn into the same group.\nThe draw resulted in the following groups:\nMatch officials.\nFrom the International Referees List, FIFA chose 24 officials from 24 different countries to adjudicate matches at the World Cup, who were revealed on 14 December 2023. \nAt least one referee represented each of the six confederations of FIFA: four from the AFC, three from CAF, five from CONMEBOL, three from CONCACAF, one from the OFC, and eight from UEFA.\nSquads.\nEach team had to name a preliminary squad of between 12 and 18 players. From the preliminary squad, the team had to name a final squad of 12 players (two of whom must have been goalkeepers) by the FIFA deadline. Players in the final squad could be replaced by a player from the preliminary squad due to \"serious\" injury or illness up to 24 hours prior to kickoff of the team's first match.\nThe final squad lists were revealed by FIFA on 7 February 2024.\nGroup stage.\nThe match schedule was published on the 6 October, following the draw.\nIn the group stage, if a match is level at the end of normal playing time, extra time shall be played (one period of three minutes) and followed, if necessary, by kicks from the penalty mark to determine the winner. Each team earns three points for a win in regulation time, two points for a win in extra time, one point for a win in a penalty shoot-out, and no points for a defeat. The top two teams of each group advance to the quarter-finals.\nThe rankings of teams in each group are determined as follows:\nIf two or more teams are equal on the basis of the above three criteria, their rankings are determined as follows:\nAll times are local, GST ().\nKnockout stage.\n21 and 23 February are allocated as rest days.\nAwards.\nAfter the final, FIFA presented individual awards to the three best players of the tournament, three top goalscorers, and to the best goalkeeper. In addition, a collective award was given to the team with the most points in the Fair Play ranking. Following this, the winners' trophy was awarded to Brazil's captain, Datinha, by FIFA President, Gianni Infantino.\nIndividual awards.\nThe individual awards were all sponsored by Adidas, except for the FIFA Fair Play Award. The Golden, Silver and Bronze Balls were awarded by FIFA's Technical Study Group, which included current and former players Dejan Stankovic, Matteo Marrucci and Pascal Zuberbühler, and led by Arsene Wenger."

        "text": "James Thomas Collins (27 June 1923 – 16 October 1996) was an Australian professional rugby league footballer, who played for Canterbury-Bankstown of the New South Wales Rugby League Premiership. He played seven seasons playing interchangeably between five-eighth and half-back.\nPlaying career.\nCollins made his debut in the NSWRL with Canterbury-Bankstown against Western Suburbs in round 3 of the 1944 season. He was moved to the half-back position and scored the first try of his career in Canterbury's 25-18 win over Eastern Suburbs in round 6. In Round 10, he scored his second try of the season in a 13-13 draw against Balmain. He played 12 games in 1944, including a representative appearance with Metropolis Seconds against Army Seconds.\nIn 1945, Collins scored a try in round 4 against South Sydney (who would win only 1 game in the season). He scored another try 7 rounds later (also against Souths) and finished the season with 2 tries in 9 appearances.\nCollins had a strong 1946 season. He scored 3 tries in the first half of the season, before scoring a try in three consecutive games in rounds 11, 13 and 14. Collins' performances helped Canterbury make the finals for the first time in 4 years. Collins played in the club's 12-10 win over Newtown in the semi-finals, although the club lost to Balmain 7-8 in the Preliminary finals.\nIn 1947, Collins only played three games. It was another successful season for the club who finished as minor premiers. They however, lost to Balmain in the final 19-25, and as minor premiers, used their \"right of challenge\" for a rematch game. Balmain would win that game 13-9 to collect their 10th premiership. Collins did not appear in any of Canterbury's finals games.\nCollins would not make another first grade appearance until the opening round of the 1949 season - where he scored a try in Canterbury's draw to South Sydney. He also scored a try in the following round against Wests. He scored his third try of the season against Manly-Warringah - who were still a new club at the time. Towards the end of the season, Collins experienced success when he scored two tries in the remaining two rounds of 1949 in losses to Newtown and Manly sequentially. He finished the season with 5 tries in 14 appearances.\nCanterbury had a relatively successful 1950 campaign, though narrowly missed the finals. He scored a try in round 8 against Parramatta, in a round 16 loss to Balmain and a try in the final round of the season against Newtown. Collins played thirteen games in 1950.\nIn 1951, Collins scored his last career try in a win against Easts. This season, he was handed some of Canterbury's goal-kicking duties. He scored two goals in a round 9 loss to Wests and kicked two goals in a double-digit loss to Parramatta. In Round 15, he played the final game of his career in a 22-6 loss to Easts. He concluded his career with 19 tries and 4 goals (65 points) in 77 appearances.\nPersonal life.\nCollins was born in Sydney on 27 June 1923.

It was subsequently sold to the family of Joseph Park before being sold in 1921.\nNumerous entities have managed the property as a country club since then and have given it more than six different names. While the club has had periods of success, it has also endured many challenges, emerging from bankruptcy and surviving the threat of dissolution and development. Over 100 years, the key components of the club have remained the same: the main clubhouse, the golf course, and a large swimming pool.\nRye Country Club (1921).\nThe Rye Golf Club was originally organized on July 1, 1921, as the Rye Country Club by a group of men from Rye and other Westchester towns with the intention of attracting an initial membership of 600. The club was built on 150 acres of the former George Park and William Porter Allen estates overlooking Long Island Sound. Activities proposed for the club included summer sports of golf; swimming; beach bathing with the creation of a new sandy expanse; and winter sports of ice skating and hockey. Four clay tennis courts and four grass lawn courts were also part of the original plan. The architect F. Burnham Chapman was retained to design additions for ballroom space, lockers, and a grill room. Organizers of the club envisioned bus service from the Rye and Harrison train stations to regularly transport the club's members and guests. Devereux Emmet was selected to design the course.\nConstruction on the golf course moved slowly with some initial overall club projects like the lawn tennis courts and harborage for yachts deferred.\nWilliam H. Horne, a renowned long driving golfer from England, was hired as the club's first pro in 1922. Horne was followed by golf pro Martin Sykes in 1925.\nIn its early days, the Rye links drew famous people like Yankee great Babe Ruth in 1933 and amateur golf champion George Von Elm. Duncan Barr was the club's golf pro at this time. Ruth and Elm were among those celebrities to play the course during this first iteration. Other celebrities to hit the greens included golfers Ed \"Porky\" Oliver and Gene Sarazen who played an exhibition match there in the summer of 1940 as part of a 60-day tour sponsored by Golf Magazine.\nDespite the growth in popularity of the sport, the Depression took its toll on the club and by November 1936, its principals were facing bankruptcy.\nThe club was transferred to the Bowery Savings Bank sometime around 1941.\nRye Sound Public Country Club (1943).\nThe reorganized club opened on April 3, 1943, as the Rye Sound Public Country Club. Advertisements highlighted golf but also additional amenities like two salt water swimming pools, one for kids and one for adults, filled with filtered water from Long Island Sound. The club offered four hard surface tennis courts.\nBayview Country Club (1944).\nDuring World War II, the club took on another name, the Bayview Country Club During this transition time William H. Horne continued to manage the golf operations. It was dissolved by 1945.\nRye Soundview Country Club (1945).\nThe waterfront location of the club captured the attention of builders. A syndicate acquired the land in August 1945 with the intention of erecting large homes. But reorganization, as a golf club prevailed and led by the owners of Buddy Lee Clothes and William Horne, the club's first pro, the facility, was rebranded under the name Rye Soundview Country Club. This name for the club was used only a short time.\nGlen Castle Country Club (1946).\nThe club was renamed, and the pool and tennis courts renovated. Pat Tiso became the new club's golf professional following Duncan Barr who had previously been the pro.\nRyewood Country Club (1949).\nSometime around 1949, the club's name had changed yet again. It was a popular venue for dances and luncheons and served the community beyond Rye. Organizations from Scarsdale, Mamaroneck, and Larchmont, like the Sisterhood of Larchmont Temple, held gatherings there.\nBy 1959, the club's Board of Governors represented residents throughout Westchester including New Rochelle, Mount Vernon, and Port Chester. The pro up to this period was Fred Annon (1951-1959). Annon was succeeded by 1952 National PGA Champion \"Whistling Jim\" Turnesa who was hired in 1959 with a January 1, 1960 start date. Turnesa was one of the famous \"Golfing Brothers\" dynasty of Elmsford.\nRye Golf Club (1965).\nThe City of Rye had their eye on acquiring the Rye Wood Country Club for many years and assembled a planning committee to study the possibility and its ramifications for the community. The proposal, the goal of which was to expand public access to recreation, was a topic of great debate and political discussion for many years starting as early as 1961. In 1964, with the possibility of losing the property to Westchester County looming, the City of Rye put the acquisition of the club to a vote by taxpayers who voted 6-1 for the city to purchase the club solely for the use of people living in Rye. The City tried condemnation proceedings to take over the club but was defeated in court. An initial offer of $1.1 million was refused by owners of the club as too low a price. The City returned with an offer of $1.7 million which was accepted. The city took possession of the club and its grounds in the spring of 1965.\nToday the club occupies overlooking Milton Harbor. Though the original purpose for the city's acquisition of the property was for the exclusive use of its citizens, one no longer needs to be a Rye taxpayer to qualify for membership in the club and there is a separate non-resident category.\nSwimming pool.\nEvery version of the country club since 1921 has had one or two swimming pools though the location of the pools has changed from time to time. At the time the main pool was constructed, it was reported to be the largest of its kind in all of Westchester County at 120 by 60 feet. The swimming pool remained a focal point of the club's operations through 1950 when the owners faced water shortages. A new way to fill it with saltwater was solved by digging a pipeline from Long Island Sound to pump water in.\nIn 1965, the two original pools were replaced by one larger pool measuring 165 by 75 feet.\nThough the two sports are not reflected in the club's name, swimming and diving are activities that members have excelled at in competitions throughout Westchester County.\nControversies.\nIn 2013, it was discovered that the general manager of Rye Golf Club, Scott Yandrasevich, had been embezzling money from the Club and defrauded the City of Rye. An investigation and lawsuit ensued and Yandrasevich was convicted and sent to prison.\nThe City of Rye was sued by several club members in 2017 over alleged negligence in the handling of application of pesticides to the greens which resulted in the golf course being closed to members in 2015.\nAdditional lawsuits related to staff have continued to plague the club.\nThe most recent controversy surfaced in 2021 as neighbors and Rye residents questioned plans for tree removal."

Webb made only one appearance in 1977 against Newtown and did not play in the 1978 regular season, however he made an appearance in Parramatta's 11-17 loss to Manly-Warringah in the minor semi finals.\nIn 1979, Webb was promoted to a starting role at hooker and played substantially more games.

On the Roosters, Webb found instant success, scoring a try on debut with the club in a round 5 to Penrith. He made 3 more appearances for the team, scoring tries in round 12 and 13 against the Sea Eagles and Canberra Raiders respectively.

Both sides netted 2 goals and finished with a tie.\nArmy lost their starting center, Woods, to a broken ankle and O'Shea was put in his place for the final two games.

        "text": "The men's 50 kilometre freestyle competition in cross-country skiing at the 2022 Winter Olympics was held on 19 February, at the Kuyangshu Nordic Center and Biathlon Center in Taizicheng. Alexander Bolshunov, representing the Russian Olympic Committee, won the event, and Ivan Yakimushkin, also of ROC, won silver, his first Olympic medal. Simen Hegstad Krüger of Norway won the bronze medal, competing in his first and only race at these Games after an illness. Bolshunov became only the second skier who won 30 km and 50 km at the same Olympics, after Russian Nikolay Zimyatov accomplished this in 1980.\nThis event was delayed by an hour and shortened to due to high winds and freezing temperature. Temperature was or with windchill, while wind gusts varied within 17-30 mph (27-48 km/h), according to the local weather. Athletes complained that the weather conditions were too severe, but many also criticized the decision to shorten the race. 28th place finisher, Finland’s Remi Lindholm, suffered a frozen penis as a result of the extreme conditions. The decision means that the gap between \"proper\" Olympic men's 50 km freestyle races will be at least sixteen years from Sochi 2014 to the 2030 Olympics. It also caused the rare occurrence that the women's 30-kilometre race, held the following day, was the longest cross-country skiing race in the Beijing Olympics both in course length and duration, despite women's distance races usually being significantly shorter than men's.\nSummary.\nThe distance event alternates between classical style and free style skiing in succeeding Olympics, and in 2022 it was the free style event. The defending champion was Iivo Niskanen, who declined to compete due to favoring classical style. The silver medalist, Alexander Bolshunov, qualified for the Olympics but the bronze medalist, Andrey Larkov, did not. The overall leader of the 2021–22 FIS Cross-Country World Cup before the Olympics was Johannes Høsflot Klæbo, and the distance leader was Bolshunov. The season was dominated by the Norwegians and Russians, who together took 20 podium places in distance events out of 24, and three more podium places were taken by Niskanen. Emil Iversen was the 2021 World Champion in 50 km classical.\nAt , a group of 14 skiers were within 6 seconds of each other and had a gap of 6 seconds to the next pursuer and almost half a minute to the rest of the skiers in the race. This group included all four ROC skiers. At , only 10 skiers remained in the leading group. Even when they were entering the stadium, Bolshunov, Artem Maltsev, Yakimushkin, Sjur Røthe, and Krueger were skiing in a group. Bolshunov was the fastest at the finish line.\nResults.\nThe race was scheduled for 14:00, but the start was delayed to 15:00 and the race distance shortened to 28.4 km due to inclement weather."

        "title": "Eric Fletcher (rugby)",
        "text": "Eric Gordon Fletcher (23 June 1910 – 15 April 1996) was a rugby union and rugby league player. He represented the New Zealand rugby league team in 1 test against Australia in 1935. In the process he became the 239th player to represent New Zealand. Fletcher also played rugby union representatively for Manawatu province and the combined Manawatu-Horowhenua side whilst a member of the Old Boys and later Massey College club sides. After moving to Auckland he also represented Auckland in a sub-union match with Thames. After switching to rugby league he played for the Richmond Rovers club and played for Auckland, and Auckland Province. He was also a talented cricketer and played a handful of games for Manawatu in his younger years. After retiring from rugby he played representative golf in the Manawatu region and in 1939 played in the New Zealand Golf Open.\nEarly family life.\nEric Gordon Fletcher was born on 23 June 1910 to Sarah Isabel Fletcher (née Harkers) and James Fletcher in Kyeburn, central Otago in the South Island of New Zealand. He had an older brother named Lloyd James Fletcher who had been born a year earlier in 1909. Lloyd would later be killed in fighting in Tunisia during World War 2. His parents then had a son named Lawrence Neil Fletcher (b. 1912), Wilfred who was born in September 1913 but died days later, another son named Alan Logan Fletcher (b. 1914), and a fifth son named Keith Walter Fletcher (b. 1917). The family grew up in Palmerston North. Eric went to Campbell Street School and all the brothers attended Palmerston North Boys' High School where the feats of Alan, Keith, and Eric were well known. In fact on 17 November 1936 they donated a silver cup to the school to award for “senior club relay races”.\nSporting career.\nPalmerston North Boys High School.\nEric Fletcher became a prominent and celebrated athlete whilst at Palmerston North Boys' High School. In 1926 he was the junior swimming champion at the school. He began playing for the 1st XV in 1927 and in a June match scored 2 tries in a 28–16 win over Old Boys. He played centre for them and on 15 June played in front of 10,000 spectators at the Palmerston North Showgrounds as part of the Winter Show events. PNBHS beat Te Aute College 6–5. His efforts weren't finished there however as he also won the “milk testing” competition with 84 points. He went on to play over 10 matches for them during the season including a Moascar Cup match against Te Aute College though they lost 8–5 to the holders. Fletcher, reportedly weighing 10st 2 lb, scored his side's only try after chasing a kick following a break.\nIn September Fletcher was selected for the Manawatu junior rep side to play Bush juniors. Manawatu won easily 26–12 with Fletcher scoring a first half try where he “badly fooled the defence prior to cutting clean through to outpace the opposition and score behind the posts”. It was said that he and Weston at full-back were the outstanding backs on their side. The 2 sides played again a day later at Spriggens Park in Whanganui and Manawatu won again though by 6 points to 5 this time with Fletcher crossing for a try in the corner. He was then selected to play in the same side against the Wellington juniors. The match was a curtain-raiser to the Ranfurly Shield match between Manawhenua and Canterbury in Palmerston North and saw Wellington win 6–3.\nOn the evening of 16 December Palmerston North Boys High School held their annual prize giving along with the Girls School at the Opera House. Fletcher, who was in his second to last year of school won the Tucker Brothers Cup for winning the high jump championship (clearing 4 feet 10 inches), the Whalley Cup for winning the road race in a school record time of 12 minutes 55.35 seconds, and the Old Boys Cup for being the senior swimming champion. He also won a medal for being part of a winning shooting team. Whilst he had finished 2nd in the 120 yard hurdles and 3rd in the 880 yard senior championship. On 18 January he competed in the Palmerston North Amateur Swimming Club's Carnival at the municipal baths and he won the Manawatu boy's 100 yard race in the intermediate division in a time of 70.15 seconds. He then went to Marton to compete on 20 January and won the 50 yard final, finished second in the 100 yard open handicap, won the dual relay along with “Miss Cameron”, and also won the 50 yard breaststroke. He was also a member of the Y.M.C.A. and over the summer he won their intermediate championship for the 100 yards.\nIn 1928 Fletcher became the captain of the school 1st XV. The Manawatu Standard reported at the start of the year that he was one of only two backs to be returning but was “one of the most promising backs in the Manawatu”. He was a regular try scorer for the side throughout the year. In their 14–9 Moascar Cup loss to Te Aute College he was involved constantly on attack and defence and scored a “beautiful try”. He injured his ankle in a game against St Patrick in July and missed several matches before returning to play against Napier Boys' High School in their annual match on 15 August. He played well but went off with his ankle causing him trouble in the 3–3 draw.\nTowards the end of the 1928 school year Fletcher played for the 1st XI cricket team as an opening batsman. Playing in a pre-season match against a Palmerston men's side he scored 18 runs. Then in November he competed in several events at the school sports day. He finished 2nd in the 220 yard race, 3rd in the 100 yard race, and 2nd in the 440 yard race. He finished 2nd in the long jump with a distance of 17 ft, 10 inches, 2nd in the high jump, and he won the 120 yard hurdles. At the conclusion of the event he was declared the “Senior Champion” and won the Board of Governor's Cup. He had also won the road race for the second year in a row, along with the McSweeney Cup for fielding in cricket, and was again the swimming champion of the school.\nRugby union.\nOld Boys, Manawatu and Manawhenua.\nAfter leaving school at the end of 1928 Fletcher joined the Old Boys club in Palmerston North. He began the season playing 4 games in their junior side before debuting for the senior team on 18 May in a 27–20 loss to Feilding Old Boys on the main Oval at the Palmerston North Showgrounds. He was heavily involved in the match and afterwards the Manawatu Times reported that he had been “borrowed for the day from the junior grade” and “was the one player who was consistently solid in defence and attack. His passing was excellent and his kicking judicious”. His first try for the senior side came a week later on 25 May against Woodville. He scored the first points of the match after receiving a pass from Riddell and “raced over” with the match finishing 3–3. He scored another try in a win over Feilding Old Boys on 1 June and the Manawatu Standard said that “Fletcher is a great asset to Old Boys’ back line and if he stands up to senior play he should make a name for himself in Manawhenua football. He set a good example to the other backs in falling back when Old Boys’ line was threatened”. He scored 3 more tries against Athletic on 8 June. He would finish the year having played 13 games for Old Boys, scoring 5 tries and kicking 3 conversions and a penalty. In mid June he was selected to play in a trial match for Manawatu A at Shannon against Horowhenua A. In this period in Manawatu's history they fielded an amalgamated representative side with Horowhenua known as Manawhenua. Fletcher played at centre and kicked 3 conversions in a 15–14 win. The two teams met again on 10 July at the Showgrounds with Horowhenua winning this time by 18 points to 14. Fletcher kicked a penalty and a conversion for the losers. Following the match he was chosen in the Manawhenua side to play Wairarapa on 17 July at centre. On his debut for Manawhenua at the Palmerston North Showgrounds Fletcher played well but Wairarapa won 12–10 after scoring a last minute try. The Horowhenua Chronicle made note of his play when they said “Fletcher was remarkably sound on defence, his tackling being performed in a capable and business-like manner that left his subjects under no misconception as to the solidity of Mother Earth. He did not shine so much on attack as is usually the case, but when it is considered that he was playing his first big representative match, and that he was up against unusually formidable opposition, this is easily understandable. On his game, the quothful Old Boys’ star has certainly consolidated his claims for continued consideration”.\nOn 27 July he played a match for Manawatu against Bush. He set up a try for winger Page, while he converted a try by the other winger Strange, in a 14–9 win at Pahiatua. He then played in a practice match for Manawatu against “The Rest”, or essentially a Manawatu B team. The main side won 40 points to 8 with Fletcher kicking 2 conversions and a penalty. He was then selected in the Manawhenua side to play in a Ranfurly Shield match against Wairarapa at Memorial Park in Masterton. It was reported that he now weighed 10st 8 lb. Manawhenua were well beaten by 37 points to 16 with Fletcher kicking 2 conversions and 1 penalty. On the opposition was the famous Bert Cooke who Fletcher would later play with at Richmond Rovers after they both converted to rugby league.\nOn 24 August Fletcher played for Old Boys against Feilding in their final championship game. They had already secured the championship but they won 12–11 to end up 4 competition points ahead of Feilding (21 versus 17). A week later he played in a Manawatu trial match for Town against Country. The Town side won 24 to 9 with Fletcher kicking 2 conversions and a penalty. He was selected in the squad to play for Manawhenua against Hawke's Bay but was ultimately only an emergency player.\nHe did however get selected for the next 3 matches for Manawhenua against Whanganui, Taranaki, and Wellington B. The match with Wanganui was played on 7 September in Levin. He set up Satherley for an early try, and then scored one of his own in the second half by the posts before being involved in a try for Conrad. The final scores was 35 to 19 in favour of Manawhenua. The match with Taranaki was played at the Showgrounds in Palmerston North before a crowd of 2,000. Manawhenua were well out played, losing 15–3 with Fletcher missing two shots at goal. Fletcher then travelled south with Manawhenua to take on a Wellington B side at Athletic Park on 14 September. Fletcher kicked an early penalty to give Manawhenua a 3–0 lead before they fell behind 17–3 by half time. However they stormed home to win on fulltime 24 to 20. After a match for Old Boys against Kaierau on 4 October between the champions of the Manawatu competition and the champions of the Whanganui competition, Fletcher's rugby season came to an end. The match was for the Licensed Victuallers Cup and was played at the Showgrounds. Kaierau won 18–13 with Fletcher having a quiet game and mainly being called on to defend.\nThe 1930 season saw Fletcher again playing for Old Boys. He made 12 appearances mostly at centre, scoring 7 tries, kicking 8 conversions and 2 penalties for 43 points. In the first game of the season on 26 April he scored a try and kicked 2 conversions in a 26–11 win over Feilding Old Boys at the Showgrounds. Then 2 weeks later he played in a Manawatu trial for the South team against the North. Manawhenua were due to play the touring British side 3 weeks later so the selectors were staging trial matches earlier than usual in the season. Fletcher kicked a penalty but missed a couple of others shots at goal in a 17–9 loss on 7 May. He was selected in the Manawatu side to play Horowhenua on 17 May in Levin as part of another trial match. He was involved in their first try and had a try for himself ruled out through a forward pass in a 10–3 win. It was said after the match that “Fletcher, Riddell and Akuira, the Manawatu trio were distinctly preferable to Bevan, Westwood and Bull”.\nFletcher was perhaps unsurprisingly then chosen for the Manawhenua side to play Britain by selectors J. Ryan and M. Winiata. He was now reportedly weighing 11st 2 lb though in later newspapers this was stated as 11st exactly. The Manawatu Times wrote descriptions of the players and included a small portrait photograph of Fletcher. The comments on him were: “Eric Fletcher (Palmerston North Boys’ High School, Manawatu and Manawhenua). One of the youngest and most versatile members of the team. A fast and very useful centre three-quarter, “Curly” is one of those fortunate people born with the football sense. He is a very attractive back to watch and is an excellent product of the rugby training of the Palmerston North Boys’ High School. “Curly” captained P.N.B.H.S. in 1928 but gained his first fifteen school cap in 1927. He left school at the end of the 1928 and during the 1929 season linked up with Old Boys and represented both Manawatu and Manawhenua. As one of the most important links in the backline of both club and representative teams, he paved the way to many fine movements and both as a scoring back and place-kicker has scored many points for his side”. Manawhenua (red, white, and blue) were well defeated on the scoreboard by 34 points to 8 though were said to have put up a good fight. The Horowhenua Chronicle said “the three-quarter line, Page, Fletcher and Strange, did not see a great deal of the ball but was called on for a lot of solid defensive work. Page and Fletcher in particular tackled with deadly accuracy in many tight corners and generally acquitted themselves well”. With the score 34–5 Fletcher and Page were involved in some “good work” that led to a try for Fletcher on full-time after he burst through gathering a loose ball from a kick near the try line. He took the conversion attempt but missed before a record crowd of around 12,000 at the Palmerston North Showgrounds. It was reported that “Fletcher stood out in the rearguard”.\nFletcher then played a handful of matches before appearing in a Manawatu jersey again to play against Southern Hawkes Bay at Dannevirke on 21 June. Manawatu lost 24–15 in what was described as a “wretched display” with Fletcher's name not mentioned beyond when he kicked off. Then on 2 July he played in a trial match for a Manawatu Town side against Manawatu Country at Johnston Park in Feilding. Fletcher's ‘Town’ side went down 12–6. On 19 July Fletcher played for Manawhenua against Wairarapa at the Showgrounds. They were well beaten by 29 points to 3 with Fletcher scoring Manawhenua's lone try. In an 13 August trial at the Showgrounds between Manawatu and Horowhenua he kicked 5 conversions in a 37 to 3 thrashing.\nHe was once again selected for the Manawhenua side and would finish the year playing 4 matches for them against Wairarapa, Auckland, Hawke's Bay, and Wellington B. The match with Wairarapa was played on 16 August at Masterton. Once again Manawhenua were well beaten by Wairarapa, losing 32 points to 7. Manawhenua then played the touring Auckland side on 20 August in Palmerston North and went down 21 to 12. Fletcher scored Manawhenua's first try after Tilley had intercepted Berridge's pass and he ran to the corner before passing back on the inside to Fletcher. The Manawatu Standard said that “Fletcher was, without doubt, the outstanding rearguard member, and it is unfortunate that this player cannot see more of the ball in handling bouts”. The Manawhenua team then travelled to New Plymouth to play Taranaki but Fletcher stayed behind and instead turned out for a weakened Manawatu side who played Bush. He scored a try in a 19–14 loss. He then returned to the Manawhenua side for their match against Hawke's Bay on 20 September in Palmerston North. In a tight match Manawhenua scored a surprise win by 4 points to 3. The win was their first of the season as was significant for Fletcher as he was captaining the side. After the match the Manawatu Standard said that “the transfer of Fletcher into the five-eighth position did not show the local player in quite his customary favourable light, his handling close in not being so sure. However, when given more time, he accepted cleanly enough and his kicking proved very useful, for he has a powerful punt. In this respect he resembles All Black Cooke who, despite his light physique, has a phenomenal boot”. Manawhenua's final game of the season was against Wellington B. Wellington had originally promised to send their top side to Palmerston North but later reneged and sent their B team. Despite this they still won in heavy rain with a “gusty win blowing” by 19 points to 6. Fletcher scored one of the home side's tries after chasing a kick, “snapping the ball up and diving over for a great try”.\nIn 1931 Fletcher began his third season for Old Boys. He played 14 matches, scoring 2 tries and kicking 5 conversion and 2 penalties. On 20 June he played in a trial for Manawatu for the South side. He kicked a penalty in a 35–21 loss. He was an emergency player for Manawatu v Bush in late July before playing for them against Horowhenua on 5 August. He was playing in one of the five-eighths positions in a 9–8 loss. It was said after the match that he was “an eleventh-hour inclusion”, but played a prominent role with “the length in his kicking being remarkable for one of his light build”. He then played for Manawatu in a midweek game against Te Kawau. He scored a first half try in a 31–6 win in the match at the Showgrounds but went off with an injured leg when the score was 20–3. He then played in Manawatu's second match against Horowhenua at Levin on 16 August. Horowhenua won 12 to 5.\nFletcher was then chosen for the Manawhenua side. Three days later on the 19th Fletcher journeyed to Masterton to play against Wairarapa. Wairarapa won by 29 points to 17. He scored a try after he “cut in beautifully” and was involved in some attacking movements. On 29 August Fletcher appeared for Manawhenua against a weakened Hawke's Bay side at McLean Park in Napier. The local side won 13 to 10 with it said by a local reporter that “Fletcher attacked and defended in capable style.\nManawhenua hosted the touring Otago at the Palmerston North Showgrounds on 3 September. Fletcher was back in the centres and he was involved on attack and defence several times. His only contribution to the scoreboard was a conversion of captain Colin Le Quesne's try late in the match which was witnessed by 3,000 spectators. Just 2 days later they played on the same ground against Wanganui. The field was described as a “quagmire” and Fletcher was appointed captain in Le Quesne's absence. Manawhenua won 20 to 6 with Fletcher scoring 11 of their points through 2 tries, a conversion, and a point. His first try came after following up after a kick and then he also converted it. He then scored again after taking a pass from Graham and “cut through between Morgan and Williams and raced away to score a brilliant try”. His last scoring act was to kick a penalty which gave them a 14–3 lead.\nFletcher played his 5th match for Manawhenua on 16 September in Palmerston North. The match was played in a “steady breeze” with rain falling. Early in the match Fletcher “electrified the crowd with a brilliant cut in”. He was involved in two of their tries through passing movement and several other attacking plays but Manawhenua nonetheless went down 13 to 9. Manawhenua's penultimate game of the season was against Wellington B at Athletic Park in Wellington. It was played in front of 2,000 people and saw the Wellington side win 33 to 21 after a 22–0 halftime lead. Fletcher missed an early penalty and was involved in a couple of attacking movements in the first half but otherwise had a quiet game. Fletcher's final game for Manawhenua was against Wairarapa at Palmerston North on 26 September. They won 26 to 22 with Fletcher heavily involved. After a couple of near misses he scored after he “raced up and kicked the ball across to the goal front and, streaking after it, found the bounce just what the doctor ordered and raced over by the posts”. Then a while later after some build up work from his fellow backs he received the ball and “side-stepping his way through for another good try” giving them a 21–13 lead after the successful conversion. Later on he blocked multiple attacks and “was proving a tower of strength, both on attack and defence”. He was one of only 7 players who played all 7 of Manawhenua's matches during the year. He was their top scorer with 5 tries, 2 conversions and a penalty for 22 points. His season finished with a 16–9 knockout cup loss to Feilding Old Boys while playing for Old Boys though he did manage to cross the try line once more.\nAt the start of the 1932 season Fletcher was elected on to the Old Boys club's committee however he was not to stay for the full season. He played just 9 matches, scoring 4 tries, kicking 7 conversions and 2 penalties before leaving Palmerston North. He had been in good enough form to be nominated by the sole selector from the Manawatu Union (A. W. Thompson) for the North Island side however he was ultimately not chosen. A rugby correspondent for the Manawatu Standard had said that Fletcher “appears to have developed additional speed this season. Some of his sharp bursts are phenomenal”. One of his final appearances before departing was for South in the trial against North at the Showgrounds on 18 June. The match was drawn 9–9 with Fletcher scoring after being first to the ball following a kick. On 25 June he played his last match for Old Boys against Kia Toa and the same day the Manawatu Standard wrote a lengthy piece about his rugby career to that point. It said that he \"intends leaving for the north on Monday on a holiday and may definitely settle there. The intimation will be sincerely regretted by all local players and enthusiasts, irrespective of the clubs they support, for it is readily granted that Fletcher is one of the most promising rugby exponents this centre has possessed for a long time past, and one whom Manawatu and Manawhenua can ill afford to lose\"... \"Of a somewhat light frame, Fletcher has been repeatedly likened to Cooke, the former brilliant All Black, for despite his comparative lightness he can get tremendous power behind his kicking, has a fund of pace and elusiveness, and has football brains. With those attributes at his command Fletcher should go far if given the opportunity and, much as lovers of the game will regret his departure, he will carry with him everyone's best wishes for the future\". It was then reported on 2 July that he had indeed departed for Auckland.\nMove to Auckland, Technical Old Boys and Auckland representation.\nAfter moving to Auckland Fletcher joined the Technical Old Boys club. They were the Old Boys of Seddon Technical College which was a school based at the top of Wellesley Street in the city before later moving out to Carlton near Cornwall Park and renaming themselves. After several mergers over the following decades they are now a part of the Grammar TEC rugby club. His first match for them was against Grafton on 9 July. The New Zealand Herald made mention of him saying Technical Old Boys “will be strengthened by the inclusion at centre three-quarter of Fletcher, an ex-Manawatu representative”. It was said after the match that his play was “closely watched by the team's supporters. Fletcher received very few opportunities, but by one or two of his actions he showed that he has unusual ability, and that he should be an asset to the team”. In his second game against Marist he scored both of Technical's tries in a 12–6 loss, with it reported that “no player earned as much favourable comment as did the Technical centre, Fletcher, the former Manawatu representative, … a thrustful player of more than ordinary ability, Fletcher repeatedly broke through the defence by means of his deceptive runs”. After matches against Grafton and Manukau he missed selection for the Auckland B team against Thames Valley and was said to be “unfortunate” as he had been “displaying great form since arriving in Auckland, proving himself to be one of the brainiest backs playing here”. He was however selected to play centre for Auckland B against South Auckland (partly modern day Waikato) at Eden Park on 20 August. Auckland B won 13 to 11 with Fletcher moving from centre to second five at halftime, switching places with Harold Tetley, then later in the half he moved to the wing, swapping with K Carter. The following weekend in an 11–0 loss to Grammar Fletcher was prominent and the “most effective back” but had to leave the field with an injury. After matches against Otahuhu and Manukau Fletcher was chosen for the Auckland match against Thames. Thames was a sub union of Auckland at this time and so it was not a full ‘Auckland’ team. The match was played on 8 October in Thames on Rhodes Park. Thames won the match 15 to 12 with the only mention of Fletcher was for a nice deep kick that put Thames in trouble. It was his final match of the season.\nThe 1933 season was to be his final playing rugby for some time. He began on 22 April playing for Technical Old Boys in a practice match before 2 competition games against North Shore and College Rifles however he injured a knee at some point early in the season. There was no mention of it in the Auckland newspapers but the Manawatu Standard said “I would almost appear as though his doubtful knee is keeping “Curly” Fletcher out of the game this season, for a perusal of the teams participating in Auckland failed to disclose his name”.\nRugby league.\nRichmond Rovers.\nFletcher had not played for over a year before he appeared in Richmond Rovers rugby league's senior side on 14 July 1934 against Newton Rangers. The match was played at Carlaw Park on the number 1 field. He played at centre and played well over all but made a mess of a try when he knocked on whilst attempting to pick the ball up on the try line with “no opponents within 20 yards”. The New Zealand Herald said he “showed promise as second five-eighths for Richmond and when settled down he should be very prominent. He showed on the few occasions he got the ball on attack that he can seize an opening quickly and run his supports into good positions”. On 18 July his registration with rugby league was confirmed with it reported “Mount Eden to Richmond” which was likely the suburb he was living in. In a 13–10 win over Marist Old Boys the following weekend he was said to be “prominent on attack”. Then after the game against City Rovers on 4 August the Auckland Star said he protected Jack Satherley at full-back well and he “has the makings of a fine player”. On 18 August in the first round of the Roope Rooster competition he scored 2 tries in a 26–5 win over Devonport United. He was said to be “settling down to the game well and is a most promising young player, who should go far in the code. He shows cleverness and good anticipation on attack, while being sound on defence”. He scored a try in their 20–13 Roope Rooster final win over Marist at Carlaw Park. On 29 September he played for Richmond against the touring Western Suburbs side who had recently won the New South Wales competition. Richmond upset them 18–16 before a crowd of 15,000 at Carlaw Park with Fletcher kicking 2 conversions. Fletcher was opposite Stan Tancred, the Western Suburbs centre. With Richmond trailing 13–8 he cross kicked and it beat Hines with O’Neil getting to the ball and scoring wide out. With Fletcher goaling from near the touchline to tie the scores. He then converted Roy Powell's try to make the score 18–13 with Richmond hanging on for the win. It was said afterwards that he was “steady at centre but did not appear to get a good service of the ball”. A week later Richmond played Western Suburbs for a second time and once again won by 10 points to 3 before 13,000 spectators at Carlaw Park. Fletcher missed a conversion and penalty but was said to have been “good at centre, and while varying his methods, was sound on defence”. While the Herald said he “was one of the best Richmond backs, his tackling again being splendid. His final match of the season was for Richmond against Newton Rangers in the Stormont Shield champion of champions match. Richmond won easily by 21 points to 5 with “Fletcher, Prentice, and Powell making the play neatly as inside backs”. By winning the match Richmond had created history by become the first team in Auckland senior rugby league to win the Fox Memorial Shield, Roope Rooster, and Stormont Shield in the same season. Fletcher was originally selected to play in an Auckland Colts side to play against Tamaki (Auckland Māori) on 20 October but he was not in the match day side.\nAuckland and New Zealand.\nIn 1935 the Herald in a preview of the season said that “much can be expected of E. Fletcher, who made a good impression at centre toward the latter end of the season”. For Richmond he played 14 matches in total, scoring 5 tries, kicking 5 conversions and 1 penalty for 27 points. He had moved into the second five eighth spot outside Noel Bickerton and the Auckland Star reported after a round 3 match against Devonport United that they were “as good a pair of five-eighths seen together this season”. The following week after a game against Ponsonby United on 18 May he was described as “steadying” and “incisive” with his attack. While his “fine tackling” was also noted and the herald stated he is fulfilling the promise he showed last season, and is a tower of strength to the team on defence, besides being good on attack”.\nOn 20 July Richmond played a match at the Winter Showgrounds in Wellington against the Wellington representative side and won 32 points to 4 in front of 3,000 spectators. It was mentioned in the Manawatu Standard that following the game Fletcher “took the opportunity” “to visit his parents in Palmerston North” after the game. It was also reported that he had given his playing boots to his younger brother Keith (7 years his junior) who was playing for the Palmerston North 1st XV like his brother had years ago. However he had not enjoyed his new boots once back in Auckland and had Keith send the old ones north to him.\nInterestingly Fletcher had started the year having mostly played at centre but he had moved into second five-eighth and had also switched with Cooke at fullback during a match with Marist. Then on 27 July he replaced New Zealand at halfback in their match against City Rovers. He scored a “doubtful” try but “played ably” and Richmond won 19 to 6 which forced a playoff for the championship with Mount Albert United which they won 14–9 to claim their second consecutive Fox Memorial title. \nThe weekend prior to the final he had been chosen as a reserve for the Auckland A and B teams which were taking on Taranaki and South Auckland teams at 1:30 and 3:00pm respectively. On 17 August he was chosen in the Auckland A team to play a B team as curtain raiser to the inter-island match. The selectors were looking to see as many players as possible in the lead up to the tour of the Australian team. He played second five with Ted Brimble at five eight. Fletcher had a strong game scoring a try and kicking 4 conversions and a penalty in 22–19 win. The Herald reported that he was “the most impressive back for the A team”. After 2 more matches Fletcher was selected for the Auckland team for their southern tour which included games against Wellington, West Coast, and Canterbury. Against the West Coast Fletcher did play and he kicked a conversion in 32–14 win at Greymouth. He then played against Canterbury at Monica Park in Christchurch with Auckland winning 26 to 13. After returning to Auckland Fletcher missed selection for Auckland in Australia's tour opener on 21 September.\nNew Zealand upset Australia in the first test at Carlaw Park on 28 September by 22 points to 14, but then were well beaten in the second test 29–8. It was at the point that the selectors looked to make several changes and Fletcher was chosen to make his one and only appearance for New Zealand. He came in to the side replacing his Richmond teammate Powell in the halfback position. He was relatively new to the position having played just two club matches there and the two tour matches for Auckland in the same position. He was playing inside another Richmond teammate Stan Prentice at five eight. The changes had little effect on the result with Australia winning 31 to 8 at Carlaw Park before 20,000 spectators. Fletcher had a relatively quiet game as the Australians “ran rings” around New Zealand. Late in the first half with the game close he missed the conversion of Brian Riley's try with the scores 8–8. Earlier in the match from a scrum he had passed to Prentice who put a kick down field that Riley got to and scored by the posts. He was far more involved in the final match of the Australian tour when they took on Auckland Province with Fletcher again at halfback. Australia won 36 to 18 on 9 October but Fletcher contributed 15 of their points through a try, conversion, and 5 penalties.\nEnd of rugby league career.\nFletcher once again started the year playing for Richmond however his season was cut short by injury and then a move back to Palmerston North. He played the first 4 matches of the 1936 season, kicking a conversion in their round 1 win over Ponsonby United. His injury came on 16 May in the round 3 match against Mount Albert United when he “retired with a foot injury” in the first half. The Herald reported that it was in fact an ankle injury. It was said on 27 May that Fletcher was standing “down owing to injuries” however this was not the case as he had in fact left Auckland and moved back to Palmerston North. Interestingly Eric's younger brother Keith had moved to Auckland (with the family at an earlier point) and registered to play league, joining the Richmond club less than 3 weeks earlier. He went on to play for Richmond until 1939 before he enlisted in the war effort and he later went on to be promoted to the rank of sub-lieutenant in the Navy.\nReturn to rugby union.\nMassey College and Manawatu.\nOn 27 May it was reported in the Manawatu Standard that Fletcher had applied for reinstatement in rugby union and it had been approved by the New Zealand Rugby Union. Just 3 days later he turned out for Massey College (later renamed Massey University) in Palmerston North. They were playing Feilding A and lost 15–10 on the Showgrounds. The Manawatu Times said “Fletcher, making his first appearance for college, played in their rearguard with fine dash, and had a couple of bright sorties”. After his second match it was reported that he was in the representative frame saying he “appeals most… when here before he was recognised as one of Manawatu's outstanding players and several season in the League should, if anything, have improved his handling”. In the very next match however against Victoria College on 11 June he received a very bad knee injury after making an attacking run into the corner. The “front of his left leg just below the knee, a fairly extensive part of flesh being lacerated to the bone. An operation was carried out last evening [June 11] to aid the healing process, but it was stated that he may be ten days of so in the hospital. This is the second injury Fletcher has received in three matches dislocated on his first appearance”.\nHe had recovered sufficiently to be named in a 30-man squad for Manawatu 4 weeks later on 6 July. The team would be narrowed down before a South Island tour. On 29 July he was down as an emergency player for Manawatu's match with Horowhenua but on match day he was included at centre. He scored a try with an “electric dash” in a 44–0 win.\nManawatu departed on their South Island tour and the first match was against North Otago at Oamaru on 9 August. Manawatu won 17–11 with Fletcher scoring a try to make the score 12–8 to Manawatu. Their next match was against Otago in a Ranfurly Shield match in Dunedin on 12 August. Before a crowd of 8,000 Manawatu played well but lost 11–5. Fletcher, playing at second five and now weighing 11st 4 lb went well and set up their lone try through a “stab punt” across to R. Gillespie who scored in the corner. The Otago Daily Times published a photograph of the Manawatu team with Fletcher sitting in the front row on the left. After the match he was amongst 7 of the Manawatu team who were guests at the annual ball for J.R. McKenzie, Ltd. They travelled further south to play Southland on 15 August in Invercargill. Fletcher scored a try in a 13–12 loss. He levelled the scores at 6–6 when he “took advantage of Southland's bad tackling to run through their backs in easy fashion”. He was playing at first five but was replaced late in the match. He was at second five again 4 days later on 19 August for their match with Canterbury at Lancaster Park in Christchurch. Canterbury won 22–9 before a crowd of 6,000. In the Southland match it had been noted that Fletcher had run the ball well but his passing let the team down somewhat but against Canterbury it was said he and Bramwell “were generally content to hand the ball on”. In a tour review by the Manawatu Standard they said “the backs, on defence, all shone out, while Fletcher and Bramwell always played very good football”.\nAfter their return to the Manawatu province they played Wanganui on 29 August. They won 29 to 6 with Fletcher kicking a conversion and he “gave a good account of himself” with his accurate handling along with Thurston at five eighth “being of tremendous value in the passing rushes”. On 5 September Manawatu played Wellington in Palmerston North and lost narrowly, 13–12. Fletcher had moved back to the centre position and scored a try after supporting a break. Four days later Fletcher was again on the scoring sheet with a try against Taranaki again in Palmerston North. Manawatu continued their good form with a 25–22 win. Aside from scoring he was involved in attacking movements throughout the game. Comments on the match said he “was excellent at centre, and kicked to his wings judiciously”. On 12 September Manawatu were again playing at home against Hawke's Bay. They won a close game once more by 12 points to 11. Fletcher gathered a bouncing ball from a missed penalty attempt and “sent a long pass to Waugh” who took it and scored to make it 12–8. They then finished their season with a 28–27 win over Wairarapa in Masterton but it appears that Fletcher did not play after being named in a large travelling squad but not being mentioned at all in any reports of the match.\nThe 1937 season saw Fletcher as part of the Massey College squad but they didn't play in the entire first round of the competition. In May he was selected to play for Manawatu against Horowhenua however he didn't play. It was reported that he was quitting rugby and going to concentrate on the sport of golf and “in any event, he will be returning to Auckland in three weeks’ time”.\nCricket.\nFletcher was also a handy cricketer in his younger years. He played cricket at school for senior teams including the first XI from 1926 to 1928. After his final season at school he was presented with the McSweeney Cup for fielding at the end of year prize giving. When he left school he joined the Old Boys club, and was named 12th man for Manawatu against Rangitikei for the Hawke Cup which Manawatu were the holders of in mid December 1928. Then at the end of January he played for Manawatu against Wairarapa in a Hawke Cup and scored 35 runs out of a total of 427 while batting at number 9. In the following December he batted at 11 for Manawatu against Poverty Bay and was 0 not out in their first innings. After the game he was selected to play for Manawatu against Taranaki. In January 1930 he was named 12th man for the Manawatu side to play against the touring Marylebone cricket team. At the end of that season his averages for Old Boys in senior club cricket with the bat was 15.1 (136 runs) from 12 innings, with a top score of 38 not out. With the ball he obviously only bowled briefly as he took none for 2 for the season. For Manawatu he had scored 22 runs from 3 innings, had 2 not outs, and a high score of 20*. In mid January, 1931 he made 80 not out in a match for Old Boys against United with the Manawatu Times giving some description of the innings. It was said that he had a slow partnership with L. Spring, and that later “Fortune smiled on Fletcher, who scoring intermittently, stayed to enjoy a short partnership with Ensor. In a partnership with Cameron he was now “batting steadily”. Old Boys later declared at 263/7 with Fletcher unbeaten after having opened. Later in the season he scored 129 against PNBHS, and he finished the season with an average of 39.5 from 8 innings (277 runs). He played relatively little the following summer and there are no records of him playing cricket beyond this point.\nGolf.\nFletcher had been playing golf during the year prior to seriously committing himself to it. He played in tournaments most weekends throughout 1937, 1938 and 1939. In late March he won the A grade division of the second stroke handicap as part of the Manawatu Golf Club's Easter tournament. He was beaten by J.F. Field in the Hokowhitu Handicap (1-up) during the same weekend. In 1939 he won the Bloomfields handicap at the Woodville Golf Tournament when he beat F.D. Mackie and then A.J. Morgan in the final.\nIn April 1939 as part of the North Island championships as part of the Easter Championships section he lost in the semi-finals to Knights. He had earlier beaten M.H. Oram in the first round of Group B, and then defeated J. Coupe. In August at the Hokowhitu tournament he shot the best score in the August Stroke Handicapin A Grade with a 77 (69 including his 8 handicap).\nIn October 1939 he played in the New Zealand Golf Open at the Miramar Links course from 9 to 11 November. There were 160 golfers competing in a field which did not include any foreign entries owing to the outbreak of the war. He shot 80 in the first round which left him in 34th place in very difficult windy, rainy conditions. In the second round he shot 85 and had dropped to 58th position on the leader board. The conditions were extremely difficult again with a northerly gale blowing and low scores nearly impossible. He made the cut but struggled more in the 3rd and 4th rounds with scores of 83 and 86 to finish 52nd with a score of 334, 41 shots behind the winner John Hornabrook. He continued to play golf through 1940 but played less beyond that due to the war.\nPersonal life.\nEric was educated at Campbell Street School, now named Takaro School, before progressing to Palmerston North Boys’ High School. After moving to Auckland the 1935 census showed that he worked as a Fruiterer. Then after moving back to Palmerston North he took on work as a garage attendant and was living at 320 Ferguson Street in 1938. From the 1960s until the 1980s Eric's occupation was listed as a clerk and he lived at 8 Winston Avenue in Palmerston North the entire time.\nEric Fletcher married Nina May Offwood in 1941. She also played golf and they played together years before their marriage, including in the Awatapu opening day competition at the Palmerston North Golf Club in April 1939 which they won. Fletcher was called up for service on 6 August 1941 but never went away to fight. His older brother Lloyd and younger brother Keith both served in the war. Lloyd was killed in action in Tunisia, North Africa on 26 March 1943. In an article in the newspaper following his death it was said that he had attended Palmerston North Boys High School from 1922 to 1925 and had been managing a farm in the Manawatu District at the time of his enlistment. Keith had enlisted in the navy as a volunteer reserve. He was promoted to sub lieutenant in 1944 whilst with the Royal New Zealand Naval Volunteer Reserve.\nOn 24 September 1942 they had a daughter named Meryll Yvonne Fletcher at “Rostrata”. She died aged just 2 on 14 September 1944. They were living at 12 Phoenix Avenue in Palmerston North at the time and Meryll was buried at Kelvin Grove Cemetery.\nEric died on 15 April 1996 and was buried at Kelvin Grove Cemetery in Palmerston North. His wife Nina died on 4 June 2006 and was also buried at Kelvin Grove Cemetery."

Yuliya Stupak, Natalya Nepryayeva, Tatiana Sorina, Veronika Stepanova, representing the Russian Olympic Committee, won the event, the first Russian win since 2006. Germany were second, and Sweden third.\nSummary.\nNorway were the defending champion, and Sweden and Russian Olympic Committee athletes were the 2018 silver and bronze medalist, respectively. The only relay in the 2021–22 FIS Cross-Country World Cup was won by Russia, with Sweden second and Norway third. Norway were also the 2021 World Champion, with Russian Ski Federation second and Finland third. Only five nations – Finland, Germany, Norway, Russia, and Sweden – ever won the women's Olympic cross-country skiing relay.\nIn the first leg, Yuliya Stupak of the Russian Olympic Committee won, closely followed by Katherine Sauerbrey of Germany, but developing 12 seconds lead over Finland, 20 seconds over Sweden, and 27 seconds over Norway, for which Therese Johaug, already a double gold medalist at these Olympics, was skiing the second leg. In the second leg, Natalya Nepryayeva of ROC and Katharina Hennig of Germany skied together, with about 25 second lead over a group of skiers, representing Norway, Sweden, Finland, the United States, and Switzerland, with others out of medal contention. At the second exchange, Germany were leading, with ROC 4 seconds behind, Norway 23 seconds behind, and Sweden and Finland 25 seconds behind. The same situation persisted for most of the third leg. Victoria Carl of Germany developed a 5 second lead over Tatiana Sorina of ROC. Norway and Finland were 14 and 18 seconds behind Germany, respectively, Sweden dropped to 35 seconds, with others out of medal contention. In the last leg, Jonna Sundling of Sweden, who earlier became the 2022 Olympic champion in the individual sprint, quickly caught up with her competitors from Norway and Finland.

        "text": "The men's 4 × 10 kilometre relay competition in cross-country skiing at the 2022 Winter Olympics was held on 13 February, at the Kuyangshu Nordic Center and Biathlon Center in Zhangjiakou. Aleksey Chervotkin, Alexander Bolshunov, Denis Spitsov, and Sergey Ustiugov, representing the Russian Olympic Committee, won the event. It was first gold for Russian athletes in the relay since 1980, when the Soviet Union won. Norway won the silver medal, and France bronze.\nSummary.\nNorway were the defending champion, and Russian Olympic Committee athletes and France were the 2018 silver and bronze medalists, respectively. The only relay in the 2021–22 FIS Cross-Country World Cup was won by Norway, with Russia second. Generally, the season was dominated by Norwegians and Russians, who together took 34 podium places in individual distance events out of 45. Norway were also the 2021 World Champion, with Russian Ski Federation second and France third. Only five nations - Finland, Italy, Norway, Russia, and Sweden - ever won the men's Olympic cross-country skiing relay.\nDuring the whole competition, the Russian Olympic Committee team were in the lead, as Aleksey Chervotkin escaped from the rest of the competitors after 3 km. At the second interchange, Alexander Bolshunov had a minute lead over Norway and Sweden, and 1:10 over France, Germany, and Finland. These five teams skied the third leg together, though Finland soon started to drop behind. Eventually, Germany also dropped out of the pursuers group. At the third interchange, Denis Spitsov was 45 seconds ahead of Norway and Sweden and 50 seconds ahead of France, with other teams out of medal contention. The last leg featured Johannes Høsflot Klæbo for Norway, who previously became the individual sprint champion at these Olympics. After 2 km, Klæbo escaped from Maurice Manificat and Johan Häggström, but at 3 km he was still 40 seconds behind Sergey Ustiugov. At 5 km, Manificat escaped from Häggström and caught up with Klæbo, leaving Sweden without a medal. Ustyugov comfortably finished his leg with a minute of advantage, leaving him free to carry the ROC's Olympic flag across the finish line. Klæbo and Manificat skied together, several times trying to escape, until Klæbo managed to break away before entering the stadium, winning silver for Norway. France were third, as they were at the 2014 and 2018 Olympics.\nBlowing fresh snow conditions made the ski tracks slow in Beijing, especially on the first two classic ski legs, contributing to a winning time more than 20 minutes slower than Norway's gold-medal time win at the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics and nearly 30 minutes back of Sweden's at Sochi in 2014. Television coverage showed maintenance workers using leaf-blowers to clear loose fresh snow out of the ski tracks.\nResults.\nThe race was started at 15:00."

He played for the South Sydney Rabbitohs from 1937 to 1940 and the Balmain Tigers in 1941 and 1943.\nPlaying career.\nIn round 1 of the 1937 season, Brown made his rugby league debut in South Sydney's huge 63-0 win over University. This was South Sydney's biggest win since the club's 67-point win over Western Suburbs in July, 1910. He played the remaining 7 games of the shorterned season (due to a Kangaroos tour).\nIn 1938, Brown was moved from lock to second-row and front-row. Playing in all 14 of the season's games, he experienced significant success, scoring 5 tries, including a 2-try performance in round 12 to help Souths win by 30 points against St. George. Brown played in Souths' semi-final match up against Eastern Suburbs, however his team lost 10-19.\nIn 1939, he played another full season, recording 3 tries. Souths defeated St. George in the semi-finals and advanced to the club's 20th grand final appearance. Brown played in the grand final at the Sydney Cricket Ground, though Souths lost to Balmain by 29 points.\nBrown played another full season in 1940, this time having stints at centre. Souths had minimal success over the season. In round 13, Brown scored two tries in Souths' 24-22 win over Canterbury-Bankstown.\nBrown signed with Balmain at the start of the 1941 season. He made his debut for the club in a 5-15 loss to Wests. He made 3 more appearances in 1941. While Balmain performed well in the regular season (tying with Easts and Canterbury for 9 wins for the season), they were upset by St. George 8-32 in the semi-final. Brown did not play in the semi-final.\nAbsent in 1942, 1943 was Brown's final season in the NSWRL. He only played one game that season in a 12-point loss to Easts. He concluded his career with 10 tries in 57 appearances."

Prior to his first grade stint, Thornton was remembered for his rivalry with Bob Crane of the (now defunct) Northern Suburbs Bulldogs RLFC. He was also noted for his heavily aggressive play in scrums, leading to frequent scrum infringements, which consequently resulted in many penalty calls from the referees.\nThornton made his professional rugby league debut with South Sydney in the opening round of the 1953 season against the Western Suburbs Magpies. He made three more consecutive appearances for the club, before making his final first grade appearance in Round 4.\nHe retired from rugby league on 2 June 1954, citing that the weekly Saturday afternoon games were interfering with his work commitments. Thornton also stated he wanted to spend more time with family, although numerous pundits believed Thornton's decision to retire from the game occurred out of frustration and dissatisfaction from the referees' officiating around scrum penalties, especially after Central's game against the Western Suburbs Rosellas in May that year."

He was an All-American for North Dakota.\nPlaying career.\nJohnson began attending the University of North Dakota in the fall of 2014 and served as the backup to Zane McIntyre during his freshman year. McIntyre signed professionally after the year, giving Johnson a shot at the starting job. He eventually won the position and backstopped the newly named Fighting Hawks to a first place finish. He was named an All-American for the year but faltered in the conference semifinals. Fortunately, the team's record was good enough to earn the #3 overall seed and UND went on a run through the NCAA Tournament. While the offense averaged 5 goals a game, Johnson didn't allow more than 2 goals in any of the four matches. He helped the program cruise to one of the more dominant postseason performances, winning the 8th national title in team history. He remained with UND for two more seasons, serving as the primary starter. His numbers, however, were not as strong as they had been in the championship year. The Hawks finished 4th in the NCHC both years and only played one more game in the NCAA Tournament.\nAfter graduating, Johnson signed with the New Jersey Devils and was assigned to their minor league affiliate. His performance with Binghamton was less than impressive and he was demoted to the ECHL before his first full season was over. Johnson joined the Florida Everblades for the following season and began to acclimate to the pro game. While he only ended up playing in 7 matches during the COVID season in 2021, he resigned with the Columbus Blue Jackets for the 2021–22 season.\nHaving claimed the Kelly Cup in the ECHL with the Florida Everblades during the 2021–22 season, Johnson left the Blue Jackets as a free agent in the off-season. On July 20, 2022, Johnson was signed to a one-year AHL contract with the Charlotte Checkers, the affiliate to the Everblades.\nJohnson and the Everblades won a second Kelly Cup in the 2022–23 season, and he become the first player in ECHL history to win back-to-back Kelly Cup Most Valuable Player awards."

The team was coached by Talbot Hunter in his second season.\nSeason.\nAfter a forgettable season the year before, coach Talbot Hunter received a boon when many men showed up to tryouts, swelling the ranks of the team further than it had even been before. Prospects for a good season were in doubt at the start, when warm weather in December forced the team to practice in the basement of a gymnasium. However, winter soon settled over New York and the team was able to open the season with a solid victory over a team made up primarily of former college players. The Cadets continued playing well when they met Colgate, as their experienced defense kept the opposition from scoring.\nArmy suffered its first loss to an amateur club from Buffalo but immediately got back on to the positive side of the ledger with a string of consistent play against three colleges. The win over Hamilton was particularly interesting since the Continentals were one of the best teams in the country. The team slipped a bit when the calendar changed to February and MAC broke through the Cadets' defense for four goals. After Dartmouth shut out the Cadets for the first time in over two years, Army recovered in the final game to earn a split with Williams.\nArmy's record, which included four shutout wins, was one of the best the program had ever posted.\nJames Whetton served as team manager with John Binns and Francis Graling as his assistants.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n&lt;br&gt;"

Traditionally the Challenge Cup final is held at Wembley Stadium in London.

        "title": "Comparison of Major League Baseball and Nippon Professional Baseball",
        "text": "Major League Baseball (MLB) and Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) are the highest levels of baseball in the United States and Japan, respectively. MLB started in 1876, while NPB was not formed until 1950, following reorganization of the Japanese Baseball League, which had been in existence since 1936. Though ostensibly the same game, baseball, is played in both MLB and NPB there are a number of differences between the game in the two organizations.\nGame rules.\nThe NPB rules are essentially those of the American Major League Baseball (MLB), but technical elements are slightly different.\nBall.\nMLB uses a standardized ball manufactured by Rawlings. Its seams are rather flat, and it is prepared for use by rubbing it with a special mud to reduce the slipperiness of the new leather. For a long period there was no standard ball in NPB, but currently a standard ball manufactured by Mizuno is used across all teams in the league. The NPB ball is slightly smaller than its MLB equivalent and has better grip, making it easier to manipulate and spin. \nField.\nThe NPB uses a smaller strike zone, and playing field. The strike zone is narrower \"inside\" than away from the batter. Five NPB teams have fields whose small dimensions would violate the American Official Baseball Rules. The note set out at the end of Rule 1.04 specifies minimum dimensions for American ballparks built or renovated after 1958: down each foul line and to center field. Though this rule is not rigidly enforced in MLB either, where, for example, Yankee Stadium was built after 1958, opening in 2009, and does not comply with the rule, having a distance down the right field line of and down the left field line of .\nTies.\nUnlike North American baseball, Japanese baseball games may end in a tie. If the score is tied after nine innings of play, up to three additional innings will be played; this includes the playoffs, but not the Japan Series going beyond Game 7. If there is no winner after 12 innings, the game is declared a tie; these games count as neither a win nor a loss to team standings or to postseason series.\nLeague format.\nMLB teams play 162 games in the regular series, while NPB teams each play 143.\nThe end-of-season championship in MLB is the World Series, a best-of-seven competition in which a team must win four games to clinch the title. NPB's championship is the Japan Series, also a best-of-seven competition. However, since games can end in a tie, it may take more than seven games to decide the series. If the series must be extended, all games beyond Game 7 are played with no innings limit, with Game 8 being played in the same venue as Game 7, and Game 9 and beyond played in the opposing team's venue following a moving day. A Game 8 has only happened once in Japan Series history, in the 1986 Japan Series between the Hiroshima Toyo Carp and Seibu Lions.\nRosters.\nMLB teams have 26-man active rosters, drawn from a larger 40-man roster of players under contract with the club. Players on the 40-man roster who are not on the active roster are typically either players currently on the injured list (or other temporary inactive list) or are assigned to the team's Triple-A minor league affiliate.\nAlthough each NPB team roster has 28 players there is a 25 player limit for each game. Managers scratch three players before each game, typically including the most recent starting pitcher, similar to professional basketball.\nMost NPB teams have a six-man starting pitcher rotation while MLB teams feature five-man rotations.\nGameplay.\nUnlike association football, which uses arithmetic coefficients to compare and rank the competitiveness of different leagues, no such system exists for club-level professional baseball. American MLB players, scouts, and sabermetricians have described play in the NPB as \"AAAA\" or \"Quad-A\"; less competitive than in MLB, but more competitive than in Triple-A. However, some commentators have pushed back on this characterization in recent years, suggesting that the talent level in NPB varies, with many active players who would be successful on the MLB level.\nJapanese baseball is generally considered more of a contact-oriented game that American baseball; it has been said that Japanese teams practice \"small ball\" rather than hitting for power. However, this was questioned by FanGraphs analyst Eno Sarris in 2017, who noted that contact rates in MLB are comparable to those in NPB.\nIn addition, Japanese teams practice much more often than American teams; the game relies more on off-speed pitching and not as many fastballs, and team harmony is stressed over individual achievements. As American journalist Robert Whiting wrote in his 1977 book \"The Chrysanthemum and the Bat\", \"the Japanese view of life, stressing group identity, cooperation, hard work, respect for age, seniority and 'face' has permeated almost every aspect of the sport... Baseball Samurai Style is different.\"\nBaseball in the United States has been described as offensive while in Japan it is defensive. Because of the relative strength of pitching in the Japanese league, some have suggested that batting and fielding statistics are more influential in differentiating successful NPB teams from unsuccessful ones."

Besides wearing pads and batting gloves, players also wear traditional dress of Maasai, red shawls and jewels. Players often wear coloured bead-necklace during matches.\nFundraising.\nThe International Cricket Council (ICC) provided financial aid to the team in the late 2010 for World AIDS Day tournament. It also received financial assistance from the Cricket Without Boundaries, Last Man Stand, 28Too Many British Army Training Unit Kenya, International cricket Council for safeguarding cricket. among many other organisations.\nMCW in films.\nIn 2015, a documentary titled \"Warriors\" was created by a British film director, Barney Douglas, consisting a detailed account of the team.\n\"The Journey Is The Destination\" is a 2016 biographical drama film based on the life of photojournalist Dan Eldon. The film follows Dan's journey as he travels to Somalia to document the conflict and famine, and his ultimate death at the age of 22 while covering the refugee crisis in Somalia. The film highlights Dan's passion for life, art, and activism, as well as his commitment to shining a light on the suffering of others. The film stars Ben Schnetzer as Dan Eldon, and was directed by Bronwen Hughes.\nAfrican Drivers “\"Lion Lights Story\"” is a short documentary about the Masaai community and their effort to conserve all African Wildlife and preserve the landscape.\nNarrated from the safari driver’s point of view African Drivers \"Lion Lights Story\" is an immersive journey conformed by special and unique moments of the people of Africa capturing the viewer’s emotions through the Masaai’s daily activities, customs and surroundings; It delivers extraordinary and intimate insights providing a wealthy legacy of knowledge in wildlife conservation to the inhabitants of this world.\nWildlife Conservation is a matter that concerns us all. Let us commit to our planet and protect it for the good of our present and future generations. After all, under the heavens there is but one great family and the responsibility is entirely ours."

As such, the championship was decided in a one-off match between the remaining two teams, with Fiji winning to advance to the Repechage tournament in Hong Kong."

        "title": "2021–22 Major League Baseball lockout",
        "text": "The 2021–22 Major League Baseball lockout was the ninth work stoppage in Major League Baseball (MLB) history. It began at 12:01 a.m. EST on December 2, 2021, after MLB owners voted unanimously to enact a lockout upon the expiration of the 2016 collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between the league and the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA). It ended on March 10, 2022, with the signing of a new agreement. Issues raised between the league and union involved compensation for young players and limitations on tanking to receive higher selections in the MLB draft.\nOn March 1, 2022, following over a week of daily negotiations between the two sides, and three months of on and off negotiations, MLB cancelled the first two series of the regular season. MLB and the MLBPA reached an agreement on a new five-year CBA on March 10. The new CBA salvaged the full 162-game 2022 season by delaying Opening Day from March 31 to April 7, with originally cancelled games to be made up during the season.\nThe 2021–22 lockout was the first MLB work stoppage since the 1994–95 strike and the first lockout of the players since 1990. This was the second interruption of regular season play in three seasons, with the 2020 season having been delayed and shortened in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nBackground.\nCollective bargaining agreements (CBAs) between Major League Baseball (MLB) and the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA), the labor union, business, and charitable foundation of MLB players, are typically ratified on a five-year basis, with the most recent CBA ratified on December1, 2016. MLB and the Players Association operated under the terms of the CBA until 11:59p.m.EST on December 1, 2021. The CBA affects all of the economic aspects of an MLB season, including the length of the season, the \"per diem\" that players may receive on a road trip, and the semantics of both free agency and salary arbitration. The most recent prior MLB work stoppage was a strike that lasted from 1994 to 1995 and resulted in the cancellation of the 1994 World Series. The last time the owners had initiated a lockout of the players was 1990. The most recent prior dispute between MLB and the players' union was in , as players and teams debated how to restructure a season affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nPlayer demands.\nIn a November meeting, the MLBPA drafted a proposal for the upcoming CBA with a number of demands that would expand player control over the terms of their contract, particularly for younger players, who are under control of the team that drafts them for the first six years of their professional baseball career. Of particular concern to the players' union was the ongoing trend of tanking, in which teams trade or release productive players and become relatively inactive in free agency in the hopes that they will finish with a losing season and receive higher compensation in future MLB drafts. The union has argued that tanking reduces competitive integrity within MLB and incentivizes teams with no intention of winning games. MLBPA executive director Tony Clark also voiced a desire to create new systems that would increase compensation for talented young players, and the union vocally disapproved of implementing a salary cap.\nOwners' proposal.\nMLB's first proposal for a 2021 CBA was aimed at establishing narrower ranges for each team's combined salary, with a hard minimum of US$100million per team and an incremental luxury tax beginning at $180million. As negotiations continued, owners made three separate proposals to the players' union, all of which were rejected, and which contained a number of concessions to player demands. These included eliminating the requirement for teams to lose a draft pick when signing a free agent who rejected their qualifying offer; a draft lottery modeled after that of the National Basketball Association; a universal designated hitter; and increases to both the player minimum salary and the competitive balance tax threshold. MLB was also seeking an expanded postseason for the , which would allow 12 of the league's 30 teams to reach the playoffs, as opposed to the previous 10-team playoff field that was introduced in 2012.\nNegotiations.\nPre-lockout.\nMany MLB teams, fearing the freeze in contract signings that would arise in a lockout, scrambled to sign prominent free agents at the end of November. More than $1.9billion in new contracts were signed during the free agency period before the lockout, including a one-day record of $1.4billion in contracts signed on December1.\nAt 10:00a.m.CST on November 30, 2021, one day before the CBA was set to expire, the MLBPA made its economic proposal to MLB at the Four Seasons hotel in Irving, Texas. MLB owners and negotiators then discussed the proposal independently, and both sides reconvened at 3:00p.m. for additional negotiations. Talks resumed for seven minutes on the afternoon of December 1 before ending abruptly. The union rejected the league's proposal to drop certain demands, including alterations to the free agency process. Negotiations came to a halt when league representatives Dan Halem and Richard Monfort left the hotel. That evening, MLB owners voted unanimously to enact a lockout upon the expiration of the 2016 CBA.\nDecember.\nThe lockout officially began at 12:01a.m.EST on December 2, 2021, announced via a press release from Rob Manfred, the Commissioner of Baseball. It instituted a transaction freeze, including the postponement of the major league portion of the Rule 5 draft. It was the first year since 1920 to not have a major league phase of the Rule 5 draft, though the minor league phase went ahead as scheduled.\nAs to not use their likenesses for commercial purposes absent a CBA, all official MLB properties removed imagery of active players, including player head shots, from their content upon its expiration. MLB.com (which had not yet launched at the time of the last lockout) was primarily publishing retrospective-based articles, while MLB Network eventually suspended all regular offseason studio programming in favor of only carrying documentaries and classic game broadcasts. As a show of solidarity, some players changed their avatars on social media accounts to the generic silhouette image being used on MLB.com.\nJanuary.\nThe first meeting between the league and the players' union occurred over Zoom on January 13, 2022. The league offered a proposal which included pay increases for veteran players, performance bonuses, and several other changes on issues of tanking, expanding the playoff field, and use of a universal designated hitter. The MLBPA was unimpressed with the proposal, which explicitly did not address the issue of free agency eligibility and which prevented any player with fewer than three years of major league play from salary arbitration; previously, a select number of players who had spent two years in the league were eligible for arbitration.\nThe parties met again on January 24. The MLBPA rejected most of the terms put forth by the league during the January 13 meeting.\nThe parties met for a second consecutive day on January 25. The league increased its proposed minimum salary to $615,000.\nFebruary.\nThe parties met for a fourth time on February 1. In a counter offer, the players association lowered the bonus pool money that would be awarded to exceptional pre-arbitration performers from $105 million to $100 million.\nOn February 3, the league requested a federal mediator to help resolve the lockout. The league also said they would not make a counter offer to the players association. One day later, the MLBPA rejected the league's request for a federal mediator.\nOn February 10, Manfred held a press conference, where he said that the league had \"agreed\" both to the implementation of a universal designated hitter and the elimination of draft-pick compensation for free agents who reject qualifying offers.\nOn February 18, the league announced that it had cancelled all spring training games through March 4.\nMLB told the players' union on February 20 that the last day to come to an agreement and have the season start on time would be February 28 and that the games missed would not be made up.\nWeek of February 21.\nBeginning on February 21, in the final week before the league's self imposed deadline, the two sides began meeting every day in an attempt to start the regular season on time.\nDuring the February 23 meeting, the league proposed a bump in the leaguewide minimum salary to $640,000 in the upcoming season. The minimum salary would raise by $10,000 per season for the rest of the CBA.\nOn February 25, the league announced they had cancelled all spring training games through March 7. The February 25 meeting focused on the format for the lottery determining the draft order.\nDuring the February 26 meeting, the union made a proposal that addressed key monetary issues.\nMonetary issues were further discussed during the February 27 meeting. While there were fewer formal proposals in this meeting, both sides felt it was productive.\nOn February 28, the two sides held a marathon negotiating session that continued until the early hours of March 1. The two sides agreed to a 12-team postseason, something that was previously thought to be a major point of strife. While the session did not end in an agreement between the two sides, both sides were reportedly optimistic that an agreement could be reached soon thereafter. The league decided to move its self-imposed deadline for cancelling regular season games to 5p.m.EST on March 1.\nDespite reports that the two sides were optimistic in coming to an agreement, they struggled to come to one during the March 1 meeting. During the negotiations, the league released statements to the press claiming that the union's tone had changed. The union, and several players on social media denied their tone had changed. The major disputes between the two parties centered around the luxury-tax thresholds, pre-arbitration bonus pool, and the minimum salary. The league made its \"best and final offer\" prior to the 5p.m. deadline. The players were extremely disappointed with the offer, with one union official saying \"We are done. This was always [the league's] plan.\" The union unanimously rejected the offer. The two sides then ended their negotiations. In a press conference immediately thereafter, commissioner Rob Manfred officially announced that the first two series of the regular season had been cancelled.\nMarch.\nThe two sides met again for an informal meeting on March 3. Unlike previous meetings, only two members of each side were in attendance, including MLB's Dan Halem and the MLBPA's Bruce Meyer. According to reports, no official proposals were made as the meeting was intended to map out further negotiations. \nOn March 4, Major League Baseball cancelled all spring training games through March 17.\nThe two sides met for a more formal meeting on March 6. The union did not change their proposals for the luxury tax thresholds, something that was reportedly a major disagreement between the two sides.\nWeek of March 7.\nThe lead negotiators for both sides met for another informal meeting on March 7. \nThe two sides met again formally on March 8. The league proposed an increase on the base luxury tax threshold to $230 million in 2022, rising to $242 million in 2026. The league also proposed a $50 million pre-arbitration bonus pool with no increases, $30 million short of the player association's request for $80 million with a $5 million increase per year. The league added several new facets to the proposal, including a third surcharge to the luxury tax, reportedly in response to New York Mets owner Steve Cohen's willingness to spend record-setting amounts on his team's payroll. Cohen reportedly was fine with the new surcharge if \"MLB thought it was for the greater good.\" Other aspects of the new offer included a maximum of five options before a player is put on waivers. The league also proposed that \"small-market\" teams could only pick in the draft lottery for two consecutive years before being downgraded to the 10th overall pick, while \"big-market\" teams could only do so for one year. The threshold to qualify as a \"small-market\" or \"big-market\" team was not initially defined to the public. Under MLB's proposal, the top two vote-getters for each league's Rookie of the Year Award would receive a full year of service time. Negotiations continued into the early morning of March 9. The players association “requested to speak to its board again early tomorrow before coming back with a proposal.” The league moved its deadline for a new collective bargaining agreement to be in place to conduct a 162-game season to March 9.\nThe two sides continued negotiations on March 9 where an international draft became a focal point in negotiations. The league also proposed a slot value of $5.5 million for the first overall draft pick, which was slightly up from their last proposal. In the union's counter proposal, its proposed CBT thresholds dropped further. After previously seeking year-to-year thresholds of $238 million, $244 million, $250 million, $256 million and $263 million, the March 9 proposal from the union offered thresholds of $232 million, $235 million, $240 million, $245 million, and $250 million. The union also proposed a $710,000 league minimum in 2022, $10,000 away from the league's proposed $700,000 figure. Despite the league and the union closing the gap on these core economics issues, the international draft was a major disagreement. The league would not give a full counter to the union until they picked one of those choices, and set a deadline for 6p.m.EST for a decision to be made. When the union declined all three offers, the league postponed games once again, this time until April 14. Despite this, negotiations between the two sides on the international draft continued into the early morning hours of March 10. While no deal was made, the two sides did announce they would meet again later in the day.\nNegotiations continued formally on March 10. The two sides reached an agreement regarding the international draft, something that halted negotiations a day prior. Following this agreement, the league made a full counter-proposal which saw its proposed pre-arbitration bonus pool rise from $40 million to $50 million. The players' union voted 26–12 to accept the league's proposal. During a meeting at 6:00p.m.EST, MLB team owners voted unanimously to ratify the new collective bargaining agreement. The lockout was officially lifted one hour later at 7:00p.m.EST.\nAftermath.\nThe lockout was officially lifted at 7:00p.m.EST, on Thursday, March 10, restoring teams' abilities to be in contact with players and effectively reopening free agency. At the time of the lockout's lifting, there were approximately 250 free agents remaining unsigned, including notable players such as Carlos Correa, Freddie Freeman, and Clayton Kershaw. As the lockout was lifted, the likeness of active players was reinstated on official MLB websites and social media accounts after a three-month hiatus with only content relating to retired players, minor leaguers, and miscellaneous topics.\nPlayers began to arrive at Cactus League and Grapefruit League training sites on March 11, two days before the mandatory reporting date and 27 days before the regular season's Opening Day on April 7.\nThe first free agent to be signed following the lockout was Drew VerHagen by the St. Louis Cardinals on March 11. The first eight-figure contract agreed upon post-lockout was Carlos Rodón with the San Francisco Giants for $44 million over two years.\nReactions.\nPlayers.\nSeveral players spoke out about the lockout, mostly in alignment with the MLBPA and often in criticism of MLB. Upon the instatement of the lockout, many players took to social media to share their reactions, Jake Diekman and Andrew McCutchen sharing memes about the situation. Several players, including Trevor Williams, changed their Twitter avatars to a blank silhouette of a player used on MLB.com player profiles due to the lockout. Marcus Stroman criticized Rob Manfred after several failed negotiations in early February, calling him \"Manclown\" and saying that he needed to \"stop ruining baseball.\" Following the cancellation of regular season games after more failed negotiations in late February, Stroman criticized Manfred again, taking to Twitter to call for his firing and expressing his grievances with MLB's marketing of players. Mike Trout spoke out on the cancellations, criticizing the league's perceived unwillingness to compromise and saying that a fair CBA needed to be achieved despite his desire to play games.\nMedia.\nMany members of baseball media criticized the lockout, both through social media and opinion articles. ESPN's Jeff Passan tweeted that \"If you went and got the next 1,200 best players in the world, the product would suffer greatly. If you handed MLB teams over to any 30 competent businesspeople, the sport would not suffer. Actually, it might improve.\" Tyler Kepner of \"The New York Times\" described MLB's final February offer as \"an offer that was engineered to be rejected.\" Grant Brisbee of \"The Athletic\" criticized the owners and the dialogue surrounding the lockout, declaring that there was \"no both-sidesing this one.\"\nFans.\nIn a poll conducted by the \"Los Angeles Times\" among adults who considered themselves baseball fans, 6 in 10 respondents said that the lockout was making them lose interest in the 2022 MLB season. A Morning Consult poll released on March 8 found that among self-identified MLB fans, 45% blamed team owners for the stalemate in negotiations while 21% blamed the players and 34% had no opinion. The survey found a higher percentage of blame for the owners than a 2020 Morning Consult poll that was taken when the league was attempting to negotiate a shortened season in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSpecific aspects of MLB and MLBPA proposals were met with mixed reactions by fans. The prospect of larger bases was met with criticism by some fans while others praised the idea for its potential to reduce player injuries from sliding or tripping."

        "text": "The 1931–32 Clarkson Golden Knights men's ice hockey season was the 12th season of play for the program. The team was coached by Jack Roos in his 3rd season.\nSeason.\nFrom the start, the team knew that this season would be a bit more trying than the past near-championship years. Clarkson lost three of its defensive stalwarts to graduation and would have to find a replacement for All-American goaltender Wally Easton. Coach Roos took charge of the team just before classes let out for the winter break and proceeded to lead the team through practices in Canada. The first two games for the team were against amateur clubs before Christmas and the team earned a split on the road. The players were then allowed to go home for the last week of December and reconvened in Potsdam after the new year. The Golden Knights were greeted by the sight of their new rink; located on Clarkson avenue, the venue was less centrally located than their previous home, but the site was chosen to take advantage of the hills on the Clarkson campus. High winds had been plaguing the team at Ives Park and they were hoping the new location would fix or at least improve that issue.\nIn spite of a raucous crowd, the team lost its first home game since 1926, ending a streak of 24 wins. Curiously, it was the offense that failed Tech as the team lost to Queen's on a goal scored in the last minutes of the match. The team rebounded with a 6–0 win over Victoria a few days later but the weather soon became a factor. A game on January 8 against Saint Mary's was cancelled when the rink's ice melted from a sudden thaw. While the rink was tended to, the team was forced to practice on the Raquette River in preparation for their trip south.\nThe first game of the road trip was a meeting with Princeton for the fifth consecutive year. With fog making visibility poor throughout the game, Clarkson's offense played well but they couldn't match the Tigers' netminder. Sticky ice kept the game slow and Tech could only muster a single goal in the loss. The following evening, the team played an amateur team in Atlantic City in front of a crowd of 8,000 spectators. The ice conditions were much more favorable and the team skated better, but they fell by the same margin. In what was shaping up to be a bad year for the team, the Knights' next opponent was the defending intercollegiate champion, Yale. While not as strong as they had been, the Elis were still 8–3 and in position to repeat as champions. The game started as expected, with the Bulldogs scoring twice to build an early advantage. The second, however, saw a dramatic change with Clarkson scoring four times with seemingly all of their skaters out playing the Elis. Clarkson produced what was considered the biggest win in the history of the program, being the first college team to take down the Bulldogs in almost three years.\nThe victory seemed to solve most of team's problems, but it couldn't settle the trouble with the weather. A lack of ice forced the cancelation of games against the Polish national team, Marquette and Ottawa. The team was only able to play one further game at home but they showed out, dominating Loyola 9–2. Tech continued winning as they finished the year on the road. The offense, led by 'Peck' Donald and Clarence 'Ike' Houston, made a strong showing in each game, allowing the Knights to end the year on a high note.\nDonald Orton served as team manager for the season.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The 1973 Major League Baseball lockout occurred from February 8 to February 25. The lockout did not result in any regular season games being canceled, but the start of spring training was delayed.\nThe lockout was initiated by Major League Baseball (MLB) team owners, who wanted an agreement with the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) on the use of arbitration in settling salary disputes. Resolution was reached via a three-year agreement between owners and the MLBPA, under which players with two years of consecutive major-league service (or three years of non-consecutive service) could use arbitration. Only \"early\" spring training (for pitchers and catchers) was impacted, as the dispute was settled before the contractual start of spring training, March 1."

        "title": "1976 Major League Baseball lockout",
        "text": "The 1976 Major League Baseball lockout occurred from March 1 to March 17. The lockout was instituted after the expiration of the league's Basic Agreement. A primary issue addressed during lockout negotiations was the longstanding reserve clause and the players' desire to become free agents. The lockout did not result in any regular season games being canceled.\nBackground.\nFollowing the expiration of the league's Basic Agreement between the owners and the players, there were rumors of a potential lockout due to the inability of the two sides to negotiate a new deal in a timely manner. The Major League Baseball Players Association asked a caucus of team owners if a lockout would happen, but the group told union director Marvin Miller that it \"wasn't their decision to make.\" Commissioner of Baseball Bowie Kuhn stated in a meeting with the league's 24 owners that because there was no agreement in place between the owners and players, dates and times for the upcoming spring training had not been set. On January 15, 1976, Miller met with the Owners-Players Relations Committee for three hours to discuss issues in an attempt to work towards a deal before a potential lockout. The league's pension plan was discussed and Miller advocated for spring training games not to be cancelled in any circumstance. No deal was met at that meeting.\nOne of the largest issues looming over negotiations was the prospect of free agency. Baseball's longstanding reserve clause began to fall into question as players sought to have more freedom in where they played. The first instance of the reserve clause being challenged was the Supreme Court case \"Flood v. Kuhn\" where St. Louis Cardinals outfielder Curt Flood refused to be traded to the Philadelphia Phillies in 1969. The court ultimately ruled against Flood in 1972, but comments made by the justices on the case were used to later nullify the reserve clause in the December 1975 Seitz decision, effectively creating free agency in baseball. With the possibility of a lockout less than a month after the decision, free agency rules and guidelines became a key issue to be negotiated between the owners and players.\nTensions rose as the two sides could not agree to come to a new deal. Marvin Miller claimed that a refusal by the league's team owners to open spring training camps to the players would be a violation of their contracts, thus making them free agents, comparing it to the Catfish Hunter breach of contract scenario from 1974. \nThe team owners were often blamed as the agitator in the dispute, receiving criticism from various sports media members. \"Newsday\" writer William Nack wrote in a February edition that \"the owners have since carried on \"ad nauseam\", to put it with charity, and contrived to emerge ironically as graceless, irrational fugitives running naked through the streets of perhaps the most graceful, rational of American games.\" Longtime sportswriter Red Smith called the owners' actions \"childish\" in his column for \"The New York Times\".\nLockout.\nThe lockout was initiated by the owners on March 1, 1976. The lockout was not total as Chicago White Sox owner Bill Veeck opened spring training camp to some of his players. MLB and the MLBPA met for five hours on March 2 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida to discuss the reserve clause amongst other issues, but little progress was reportedly made. MLB offered that players must have eight years of service time before being eligible for an option year in their contract, a proposal that union director Marvin Miller deemed \"unacceptable.\" American League president Lee MacPhail rebutted by saying that Miller was \"making a mountain out of a molehill.\" Early in the lockout, there was alleged indication that the ownership group was backing down. On March 2, the Atlanta Braves opened spring training camp to a handful of non-roster players, and several other teams reportedly told their players to get ready for spring training. \nThe two sides met again on March 3 in Miami Beach for two and a half hours. The players argued that they should be able to have an option year after one year of service, colloquially dubbed the \"one-one rule.\" The owners argued that they could not allow the Seitz decision that granted Andy Messersmith and Dave McNally free agency become the norm. The owners made a revised proposal that would allow players to seek free agency after six years of service time, but Marvin Miller said that MLB was not willing to hear out the MLBPA's counter-proposal.\nMore owners began to ease their lockout stance; Jim Kaat and Steve Carlton were among 22 Phillies players at spring training camp by March 4.\nMLB and the MLBPA conducted another meeting on March 5 in New York City. The meeting lasted for one hour and was abruptly ended in a reportedly negative fashion. The reserve clause was once again discussed but no notable concessions were made. Marvin Miller conducted an MLBPA press conference March 6 to address the meeting, stating that the dealings were professional but not progressive. He announced that the MLBPA was setting April 25 as a deadline for negotiations to conclude, threatening that they would argue breach of contract otherwise and seek to grant players free agency. MLB released a statement, claiming that the players were obligated to comply in the creation of a new reserve system. Following the March 5 meeting, no further meetings were scheduled but the two sides stayed in contact through the phone.\nCommissioner of Baseball Bowie Kuhn, who largely separated himself from the dispute between MLB owners and the MLBPA, began to receive calls to alleviate the problem before regular-season games were cancelled. As commissioner, Kuhn held the power to open up the spring training camps and effectively end the lockout.\nBy March 9, strife developed between MLBPA director Marvin Miller and several players. Some players began to call for Miller to ease up in negotiations and give more credence to the owners' stances. Cincinnati Reds superstars Johnny Bench and Pete Rose claimed that Miller was not listening to the players. Bench joined Tom Seaver and Joe Torre in a trio advocating for a quick resolution so that play could resume. Montreal Expos pitcher Woodie Fryman said that he did not care which way the negotiations swung, just that he wanted to play.\nMLB and the MLBPA met again on March 9 in New York City to no avail. The meeting reportedly featured \"raised voices\" and obscenities coupled with no progress towards a deal. Miller alleged that MLB was misleading the players on the status of the negotiations. Despite the hostile nature of the meeting, the sides agreed to meet again in Florida on March 11 and 12.\nOn March 10 in Tampa, Florida, MLB met with a contingent of roughly 50 players for two and a half hours to discuss the situation. Johnny Bench, who was among the group of players in the meeting, shared a sense of pessimism, as did MLBPA director Marvin Miller. Bench noted that many players were training on high school and collegiate fields in Florida and paying their own housing fees because they did not have access to team facilities. The groups reconvened in St. Petersburg, Florida on March 11, meeting for two hours but leaving disappointed. A group of players decided to cancel the voluntary practices they were holding at Eckerd College as they believed practicing during the lockout could only stand to benefit the owners.\nOn March 14, Commissioner of Baseball Bowie Kuhn announced that the regular season would occur and that the regular season would commence on the scheduled April 8 opening day. At the time, Kuhn stated that he had would open spring training once he saw considerable progress between MLB and the MLBPA. At a meeting, Marvin Miller made a new proposal that would institute a one-year test trial of the \"one-one rule\" so that the two camps could witness its cost-effectiveness and make a later decision. The meeting lasted into the night and negotiators were seen walking around the hotel premises and discussing, leading the media to believe an agreement was imminent. Another meeting was set for the morning of March 15.\nOn March 16, the ownership group gave their final offer which included an acceptance of the players' much-desired one-one rule. AL President Lee MacPhail said that MLB \"bit the bullet\" on the rule and added that spring training camps would not be opened until the deal was accepted. MLBPA Director Marvin Miller described the offer as a sudden turnaround from previously hostile negotiations and said that the players would convene to discuss the following day. On March 17, Commissioner of Baseball Bowie Kuhn ordered that training camps be opened immediately, effectively ending the lockout. At the time, the MLBPA had not accepted or declined the owners' \"best and final\" offer. Miller stated that the MLBPA did not vote on the owners' proposal because it did not address issues that were important to the players' union."

        "title": "Lido Golf Club",
        "text": "The Lido Golf Club was a golf course in Long Beach, Nassau County, Long Island, New York.\nHistory.\nThe Lido was designed by Charles B. Macdonald, with contributions from other designers, and constructed in 1915.\nOverseen by engineer Seth Raynor, construction required that \"thousands of pounds of sand\" be pumped out of the bay to reclaim what had been a marsh. The advantage was that \"the exact contours required by the course architects\" could be achieved. Turf bricks were cut from nearby property to lay the greens.\nThe course opened by the summer of 1917.\nMore than 2,000,0000 cubic yards were pumped in from Long Beach channel by five hydraulic dredges. Hills forty feet high and undulations corresponding were thus constructed. Forty thousand cubic yards of meadow muck were lifted and placed as a soil for all the fairways, greens and tees. Among the incidentals more than 2,500 tons of lime, 6,000 tons of fertilizers, and 35,000 tons of top soil. The entire rough was planted by hand with beach grass, each in squares eighteen inches apart. Nearly a million plants were required. They hold the sand in place and at the same time afford an excellent hazard. An irrigation system provides for every foot of the expanse.\nUnfortunately, its opening coincided with the United States' entry into World War I. During the summer of 1918, management was forced to lower the annual dues from $200 to $60 and make the course easier to attract more amateur players.\nIn 1942, during World War II, the United States Navy acquired the property and destroyed the course to construct a naval base. After the war, in 1953, a new course was built in nearby Lido Beach with a design by Robert Trent Jones. While different from the original, the Trent Jones course features a replica of Macdonald's 4th hole.\nCourse.\nThe Lido provided a championship, a regular, and a short course.\nReception.\nIn 1921, Walter Hagen listed the Lido as one of golf's \"Big Three\" courses, along with the National Links, and Pine Valley. An assessment after completion described the course as \"the greatest test in the world, with the possible exception of Pine Valley.\" \nOn two holes at high tide the surf scatters spray over the greens, while the ocean seems scarcely more than a drive, a brassey and approach from any of the tees. The course proper covers 115 acres, over seven of which flows the lagoon, an artificial lake dredged twelve feet deep with made-land in the centre constituting the island hole... The home hole was built after the design of the best of more than one hundred plans submitted in a prize contest conducted in England for the best two-shot stretch.\nLegacy.\nIn 2021, Michael and Chris Keiser, operators of Sand Valley Golf Resort in Nekoosa, Wisconsin undertook to construct a replica of the Lido in the Wisconsin sand barrens. Golf historian Peter Flory spent years studying the original course's design and created a virtual, 3-D computer simulation. Impressed by Flory's photorealistic model, Keiser hired architect Tom Doak to bring the replica to life. It's expected to be completed in 2023.\nAnother Lido-inspired course opened in 2022 at Ban Rakat Club near Bangkok, Thailand. Designed by architect Gil Hanse alongside business partner Jim Wagner, Ballyshear Golf Links features 18 holes reinterpreted to fit the site's landscape."

        "text": "The women's super-G in the 2022 FIS Alpine Skiing World Cup consisted of nine events including the final. Although no Italian woman had ever won the super-G championship, the battle in 2021-22 was between three of them: speed specialists Sofia Goggia and Elena Curtoni plus 2020 overall champion Federica Brignone. Through the first six races, Curtoni had won one, and each of the others had won two. However, Goggia was injured in a crash in the sixth race, in Cortina d'Ampezzo, and missed the next set of speed races as well as the super-G in the 2022 Winter Olympics. The seventh race, which was held days before the Winter Olympics, was skipped by many of the other top competitors, but was won by Brignone, enabling her to open a sizable lead in the discipline, and Brignone was able to clinch the season championship in the next Super-G when neither Curtoni nor Goggia scored points.\nAs noted above, the season was interrupted by the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, China (at the Yanqing National Alpine Skiing Centre in Yanqing District) from 6–19 February 2022. Although the Alpine Skiing branch of the International Ski Federation (FIS) conducts the World Cup and co-organizes the Alpine skiing at the Winter Olympics (along with the International Olympic Committee {IOC)), the Winter Olympics are organized by nation (a maximum of four skiers is permitted per nation), and (after 1968) the Olympic results do not count for World Cup points. Accordingly, the results in the Olympics are highlighted in blue and shown in this table by ordinal position only in each discipline. The women's super-G was held at the \"Rock\" course on 11 February 2022.\nThe World Cup final was held on Thursday, 17 March in the linked resorts of Courchevel and Méribel, France, which are located in Les Trois Vallées, on the new L'Eclipse course at Courchevel. Only the top 25 skiers in the World Cup downhill discipline and the winner of the Junior World Championship, plus athletes who have scored at least 500 points in the World Cup overall classification for the season, are eligible to compete in the final, and only the top 15 earn World Cup points. Due to injuries, only 20 of the top 25 were able to compete, along with one 500+ point qualifier (Petra Vlhová) and the junior winner."

The sixth discipline, Alpine combined (AC), had all of its events in the 2021–22 season cancelled due to the continuing schedule disruption cased by the COVID-19 pandemic, which also happened in 2020-21. In an adjustment that was partially motivated by the pandemic, each of the four main disciplines had nine races, while the parallel discipline had only one. The season did not have any cancellations.\nThe season was interrupted by the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, China (at the Yanqing National Alpine Skiing Centre in Yanqing District) from 6–19 February 2022.\nIn the 35th event of the season, with just two events in the finals remaining, three-time overall champion Mikaela Shiffrin of the United States clinched her fourth championship, building an insurmountable 236-point lead over defending overall champion Petra Vlhová of Slovakia. Although Shiffrin had a huge lead early in the season, she then had a bout with COVID and also skipped several races both while preparing for and then immediately after the Winter Olympics, giving Vlhová a chance to catch up (of which she took advantage). However, Shiffrin re-established her lead in the first events in March. After Vlhová closed to 56 points, Shiffrin won the downhill at the World Cup finals, an event in which she rarely competes, to re-establish a triple-digit lead, and her second place in the next day's Super-G clinched Shiffrin's fourth overall title, drawing her even with Lindsey Vonn and behind only Annemarie Moser-Pröll, who won six, among women.\nThe last events of the season took place at the World Cup final, Wednesday, 16 March through Sunday, 20 March in the linked resorts of Courchevel and Méribel, France, which are located in Les Trois Vallées. Only the top 25 in each specific discipline for the season and the winner of the Junior World Championship in each discipline were eligible to compete in the final, with the exception that athletes who have scored at least 500 points in the overall classification were eligible to participate in any discipline, regardless of their standing in that discipline for the season."

He responded by leading the RedHawks in scoring as a sophomore and leading the team to just the second 1st-place finish in program history. During the season, Davis was a member of the United States national junior team. They finished a disappointing 4th for the 2006 World Junior Championships.\nDavis was named an alternate captain for his junior season and continued to lead the team in scoring. He was named an All-American for the year and led the program to its first ever NCAA Tournament victory, scoring the first goal in a 2–1 win. After the season, Davis played for the US national team but went scoreless in seven games. He returned to Miami for his senior year but things couldn't have started worse. He injured his shoulder in the season opener and missed several games. The team was able to persevere without their star center and ended up post the best record in program history. Davis would eventually rejoin the team, playing in half of their games, and led Miami into the postseason with the 2nd overall seed. In the first game of the tournament, Davis reinjured his shoulder and he was unable to participate in the quarterfinal game against Boston College. Miami ended up losing the match 3–4 in overtime.\nAfter graduating cum laude with a degree in political science, Davis signed with the Blackhawks and was assigned to the Rockford IceHogs. After playing just over half of the team's games in 2009, he was limited to just 23 appearances in his second season. Rather than continue fighting through the injury that never fully healed, Davis retired from professional hockey.\nHe returned to Ohio and worked as an intern for Senator Sherrod Brown. He had another brief stint as a sales representative for the Wirtz Beverage Group, operated by the owners of the Chicago Blackhawks. He tried yet a third career, this time as an account executive with Evolve Vacation Rental Network in Denver, Colorado. In 2013 he decided to go back to school and earn a J. D. He attended the University of Colorado Law School for three years, graduating in 2016. While there he served as a legal intern for NBCUniversal and also joined the school's club team as a coach. After passing the bar, Davis joined the Holland &amp; Hart law firm as an associate. He remains with the LLP as of 2021."

        "text": "Erik Anderson is an American former ice hockey center who was an All-American for St. Lawrence.\nCareer.\nAnderson saw a great deal of success in his junior hockey career. His first year with the Stratford Cullitons saw him win both the league championship as well as the Sutherland Cup. The team repeated as MWJHL champions in 1996 and, while they were stopped just shy of a three-peat, Anderson personally had a superb final season. In 1997 he led the league in all three statistical categories, averaging more than 3 points per game for the year. He took his considerable scoring prowess to St. Lawrence but his freshman year was anything but spectacular. The decline was only temporary, however, and he more than doubled his point production as a sophomore, helping turn the Larries into one of the top teams in ECAC Hockey and getting them into the NCAA Tournament for the first time in seven years. Entering his junior season, Anderson was named an alternate captain and continued his scoring pace. This time, the team captured both conference championships and reached the Frozen Four for the first time in twelve years (the program's last appearance as of 2021). He was named team captain as a senior and, while the team declined a bit, Anderson had his best season yet, being named an All-American and ECAC Player of the Year.\nAfter graduating, Anderson began playing professionally and started with the Milwaukee Admirals. He had some difficulty in adjusting to the AHL, averaging just over 1 point every 5 games, and found himself demoted to the ECHL before season's end. His second year began with him as a member of the Toledo Storm but he got off to a tremendous start. After six games, he had scored 10 points, was the team's leading scorer, and was recalled to the Milwaukee Admirals. While his scoring improved in year two, it still wasn't enough for the Admirals to keep him on the roster and he was eventually returned to Toledo.\nRather than continue in the minors, Anderson headed to England and joined the Sheffield Steelers. He finished second on the club in scoring and helped them win the inaugural EIHL championship, being named a second-team all-star for the year. After reaching the semifinals the next year, Anderson left the team and split the following year with two clubs in central Europe before returning across the pond and ending his playing career with the Elmira Jackals.\nAnderson was inducted into the St. Lawrence Athletic Hall of Fame in 2019."

Founded in 2021, they competed in the Canadian Elite Basketball League (CEBL) and played their home games at the Field House at Memorial University of Newfoundland. They were owned and operated by Deacon Sports and Entertainment, the same organization that operated the professional hockey team that is also called the Newfoundland Growlers. The Growlers are the third professional basketball team to be based in the St. John's area after the St. John's Edge of the National Basketball League of Canada and the Newfoundland Rogues of the American Basketball Association.\nHistory.\nOn July 15, 2021, the St. John's Edge of the National Basketball League of Canada (NBL Canada) were unable to secure a lease with St. John's Sports and Entertainment (SJSE), the group that owns Mile One Centre, and were announced as not returning to the venue for the 2022 season. The Edge's ownership had been negotiating with the arena alongside Deacon Sports and Entertainment (DSE), the majority owner of the arena's hockey tenant Newfoundland Growlers, where DSE would have taken over as primary owner of the Edge upon the lease renewal. DSE chose not to sign the lease as SJSE had included terms that the Edge's debts for the installation of a 360 LED board must be rectified or taken on by DSE.\nSJSE instead awarded a lease to an outside ownership group, 2001 Investments Limited, and their American Basketball Association franchise. On September 10, the sale of the Edge to DSE was approved by the league if an arena deal could be settled. DSE stated they were committed to keeping the Edge in the region, but no home arena was announced at the time. The Growlers were also evicted from the arena in October 2021 leading an on-going lease dispute between SJSE and DSE, leading to their first six home games of the season being moved to Conception Bay South. The Edge were granted a leave of absence by the NBL in November 2021 in order to obtain a new lease but the sale of the team to DSE was never finalized.\nAfter the deal for the Edge fell through, DSE instead founded a new basketball team in the Canadian Elite Basketball League (CEBL), which they also named the Newfoundland Growlers. The new Growlers began play in the 2022 CEBL season playing out of Memorial University's Field House.\nOn November 11, 2022, it was announced the Growlers would be ceasing operations after the amenities at the Memorial University's Field House were deemed to be inadequate for long term use and the team was unable to obtain a lease at a new venue. The team said however it is open to discussion if an opportunity to play in a new professional arena presents itself."

The match was played on 13 June 2022 at the Ahmad bin Ali Stadium in Al Rayyan, Qatar. Australia won 5–4 on penalties following a 0–0 draw after extra time to qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.\nBackground.\nThe draw for the inter-confederation play-off fixtures was held on 26 November 2021.\nThe match was the second meeting between Australia and Peru. The sides previously met four years earlier in the 2018 FIFA World Cup Group C, with Peru winning 2–0 when \"La Blanquirroja\" was already eliminated. Before the match, most football commentators lauded Peru as the better team and had low expectations of Australia, which struggled in the Asian qualifiers.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nThe match ended as a scoreless draw. In the 120th minute, Australian goalkeeper Mathew Ryan was subbed off for Andrew Redmayne. During the penalty shoot-out, Redmayne gained notoriety for his dance-like movements, which he used to confuse the Peruvian players. This strategy succeeded, as Redmayne stopped the decisive penalty from Alex Valera diving low to his right-hand side.\nGraham Arnold's decision to sub Redmayne in evoked the 2014 FIFA World Cup quarter-final match between Costa Rica and the Netherlands, when Dutch coach Louis van Gaal subbed Jasper Cillessen off for Tim Krul in the 120th minute, as Krul successfully stopped two penalties to eliminate Costa Rica.\nDetails.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

        "text": "The 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification CONCACAF–OFC play-off was a single-leg match between the fourth-placed team of the CONCACAF third round, Costa Rica, and the winners from the OFC, New Zealand. Before their identity was known, the winners of the play-off had already been allocated to Group E at the World Cup.\nThe match was played on 14 June 2022 at the Ahmad bin Ali Stadium in Al Rayyan, Qatar. Costa Rica won the match 1–0 to qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.\nBackground.\nThe draw for the inter-confederation play-off fixtures was held on 26 November 2021.\nBoth teams had met once, a friendly won 4–0 by Costa Rica at the Ricardo Saprissa stadium on 24 March 2007. Current Costa Rican captain Bryan Ruiz, then 21 years old, scored a goal and gave an assist in that match. He is also the only player from that match to remain active with his national team. Current New Zealand's coach Danny Hay also played that match.\nThe match was the second inter-confederation play-off for Costa Rica, having previously lost 1–2 on aggregate to Uruguay in 2009. Since the OFC had no direct qualification spots, New Zealand reached the intercontinental play-offs for the fourth consecutive time, winning the first (against Bahrain in 2009) and losing the remaining two (against Mexico in 2013 and against Peru in 2017).\nCosta Rica had a complicated start of the qualifying process. During the first half of the CONCACAF third round, Costa Rica stood fifth at only six points out of twenty-one, five points behind Panama, then the fourth-placed team. The second half of the round began on 16 November 2021; that night, as Costa Rica was drawing a home match against Honduras, their gap against the Panamanians almost increased to seven points; however, a late goal by Gerson Torres gave a crucial victory for the \"Ticos\", who from then onwards enrolled in an unprecedented comeback, with six victories and one draw that saw them overtaking Panama, ending Canada's undefeated streak, and finishing fourth of the table, with only the goal difference preventing them to overtake the United States for the third place.\nMarked by several delays due to effects of the COVID-19 pandemic such as travel restrictions that national teams couldn't be able to travel in those countries, the OFC qualification round announced the tournament scheduled to be held in Qatar in March 2022. New Zealand won the tournament and qualified to the play-off match against the CONCACAF fourth-placed team, who was unknown at the time.\nThe group stage draw took place on 1 April 2022, leaving the CONCACAF–OFC play-off winners allocated in Group E, alongside Spain, Japan, and Germany. Later, in May, FIFA revealed the stadium that would host both the AFC vs CONMEBOL and CONCACAF vs OFC play-off matches: the Ahmad bin Ali Stadium. The winners of the CONCACAF vs OFC play-off match are set to return to the stadium at the World Cup to face Japan on 27 November.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nThree minutes into the match, Joel Campbell received a cross from Jewison Bennette to score the lone goal. At the 39th minute, Chris Wood scored a goal after a poor clearance by Yeltsin Tejeda. However, his goal was nullified as the video assistant referee (VAR) showed that Matthew Garbett had fouled Óscar Duarte prior to the goal. The VAR was also used at the 69th minute, after Kosta Barbarouses, who had been subbed in just nine minutes prior, tackled Francisco Calvo's ankle. Referee Mohammed Abdulla Hassan Mohamed originally showed Barbarouses a yellow card, but after checking the VAR, Hassan changed it to a red card, leaving New Zealand down to ten men for the rest of the match.\nThe refereeing caused frustration in the New Zealand team. Coach Danny Hay said that \"FIFA has let us down\" because of the relative inexperience of the referees compared to the European officials for the Australia vs Peru match. Former Costa Rican referee Ramón Luis Méndez considered both the goal disallowance and the red card as valid decisions, but questioned why the VAR did not check a foul by Kendall Waston on Chris Wood that should have been a penalty.\nDetails.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nMan of the Match:\nKeylor Navas (Costa Rica)"

        "text": "This list of minor Negro league baseball teams consists of teams that played in the various minor Negro baseball leagues, as well as the independent teams, teams that played in proto-leagues and teams that played after integration. \nIn Negro league baseball, organized major league play began in 1920, however informal \"proto\" leagues arose in the 1880s. Most teams up to about 1920 were able to survive, and even profit, by barnstorming small towns and playing local semi-pro teams. After 1920, most teams found financial security by forming leagues, but it was common for teams each season to play as many games outside of the league's schedule. Generally, leagues in the north were major while leagues in the south were minor.\nWith the integration of Organized Baseball beginning 1946, Negro leagues lost elite players to white leagues causing former major Negro leagues to slip to minor league status, and historians do not consider any Negro league \"major\" after 1950. By default, leagues established after integration are considered minor league, as is the one of two 1940s majors that continued after 1950. Also at this time, Negro leagues began to appear in the west.\nBelow are some of the better-documented leagues:\nBelow is the list of minor Negro league teams. Teams in bold are considered to have been of major league caliber for at least one season of their existence. Other teams included in this list were either a semi-pro, barnstorming or traveling team and not necessarily a member of a league."

        "title": "Marlborough cricket team",
        "text": "The Marlborough cricket team represents the Marlborough Region of the South Island of New Zealand. It competes in the Hawke Cup. Its base is in Blenheim.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nA Marlborough Cricket Club was formed in Blenheim in late 1860. The first properly organised match in the region appears to have been held at Blenheim in January 1862, between Blenheim and Picton, in a paddock belonging to the Resident Magistrate, S. L. Muller. Picton won.\nMarlborough teams travelled to play interprovincial matches against Nelson in Nelson in March 1863 and against Wellington in Wellington in March 1866. Marlborough lost both matches, by 42 runs and 45 runs respectively.\nThe Marlborough Cricket Association was formed in October 1886 by five clubs from Blenheim, Picton, Spring Creek, Wairau and Havelock. Apart from establishing a local competition, the main intention was that Marlborough should be able to host a match against the touring English team later that season, but that tour did not eventuate. It was not until January 1903 that an overseas touring team played in Marlborough, when the English touring team Lord Hawke's XI beat a Marlborough XXII by nine wickets in a two-day match at the Wairau Cricket Club's ground in Blenheim.\nHawke Cup years.\nMarlborough competed for the Hawke Cup for the first time in 1912–13, the third season of the competition, when the title was decided in a final match after preliminary rounds. Marlborough's scheduled preliminary matches were cancelled, and so the three-day final against South Auckland in Hamilton was Marlborough's first Hawke Cup match. South Auckland won by 87 runs. For Marlborough, Roy Pearpoint took six wickets in each innings.\nAfter the Wairau club ground was sold for development, Marlborough moved to nearby Horton Park, playing their first match there in December 1919 against the Thorndon club from Wellington. Marlborough won by an innings and 133 runs, Edgar Neale scoring 201.\nCentral Districts, of which Marlborough is one of the eight constituent associations, began playing in the Plunket Shield in the 1950–51 season. Marlborough's first player in the Central Districts team was Fen Cresswell, who played in their inaugural Plunket Shield match. His brother and Marlborough teammate Arthur joined him in the team for the second match, when they opened the bowling together and took 12 wickets in Central Districts’ first victory. Between 1972 and 2002 Central Districts played nine Plunket Shield and three one-day matches at Horton Park.\nMarlborough have competed regularly in the Hawke Cup ever since 1913. They won the title for the first time in January 1968 when they defeated Hutt Valley by 77 runs. The Test player Gary Bartlett captained Marlborough, and scored more runs and took more wickets than anyone else in the match. Marlborough have since won the title twice: in February 1994, when they narrowly beat Manawatu, and February 2011, when they beat Otago Country by an innings."

Joanne Hewson scored a try against Auckland, and another try in the 1st Test. Joanna Will scored two tries in the match against Canterbury. \nThe Jumper Number column shows the order players were listed in the team named for the 2nd Test, which appeared in a preview article in the Christchurch newspaper, The Press.\nResults.\nA 'spectacular' try to Brenda Dobek in the closing minutes won the match for Great Britain, against an Auckland side that were missing their national team representatives.\n1st Test.\nPlaying a more physical game, to dominate possession and territory, New Zealand scored three converted tries in the first 30 minutes. A slick switch pass by Debbie Chase sent Trish Hina in for the opener. Leah Witehira found a gap for the second and Germaine Wiki broke through tackles for the third try.\nBoth teams displayed improved defence in the second half, with Great Britain 'tackling ferociously' on their own line. Capitalising on sustain pressure, Trish Hina scored her second try after 15 minutes. In an 80-metre run, winger Sara White fended off two defenders and outsprinted others for an 80th minute try. \nThe Canterbury team included a mother &amp; daughter pairing, second rower Mary Brennan, aged 41, and centre Mereana Brennan, aged 17. Other players to feature for Canterbury included loose forward Vicki Blair, Kylie O'Loughlin, Melany Taniora-Green and Vicki Logopati.

He attended Huntington Beach High School in Huntington Beach, California. He was First Team All-Sunset League in 2014 and 2015. He was 12–0 with a 1.27 earned run average (ERA) in his junior season, in which he was First Team All-California and All-County, and won the 2015 CIF Southern Section Division I Championship, throwing a complete-game four-hitter with 10 strikeouts in the title game.\nDavis enrolled at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where he played college baseball for the UC Santa Barbara Gauchos while majoring in environmental studies. In 2016 he was named Big West Freshman of the Year. In 2017, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Cotuit Kettleers of the Cape Cod Baseball League. In 2018, he pitched in three games before undergoing Tommy John surgery in March. He was still selected by the Cincinnati Reds in the 11th round of the 2018 Major League Baseball draft, and signed for a signing bonus of $127,500.\nProfessional career.\nCincinnati Reds.\nDavis made his professional debut, after rehabbing from his surgery, in June 2019 with the Arizona League Reds, and was promoted to the Billings Mustangs during the season. Over innings between the two teams, in 13 starts he went 1–3 with a 3.19 ERA and 35 strikeouts. He did not play a game in 2020 due to the cancellation of the minor league season. He began 2021 with the Dayton Dragons.\nColorado Rockies.\nOn July 28, 2021, the Reds traded Davis and pitcher Case Williams to the Colorado Rockies for reliever Mychal Givens. He was assigned to the Spokane Indians, where he ended the season. Over 19 starts between Dayton and Spokane, he went 6–7 with two complete games and a 3.60 ERA, 76 hits, and 106 strikeouts in 100 innings, a 9.5 K/9 rate.

He started one game for the Triple-A Albuquerque Isotopes of the Pacific Coast League, and was 0–0 with a 1.93 ERA. On September 16, 2022, the Rockies called him up to the major leagues. Colorado manager Bud Black said that Davis could be a starter for the Rockies in the near future, if he can adapt to major league hitters. However, he was optioned back to Albuquerque on September 24 without making an appearance, briefly becoming a phantom ballplayer. On October 4, Davis was recalled back to the major league roster. He made his major league debut on the next day, the final day of the season, against the Los Angeles Dodgers.\nDavis was optioned to Triple-A Albuquerque to begin the 2023 season. In 8 appearances (6 starts) for the Rockies, he posted an 0–4 record and 8.70 ERA with 26 strikeouts across 30.0 innings of work. Davis was again optioned to Triple–A Albuquerque to begin the 2024 season.\nPitching repertoire.\nAs of January 2022 his pitching repertoire with a short-arm, low-slot delivery was a slider averaging about 93 mph and touching 62 mph, a curveball about 77 mph, and an occasional changeup."

        "title": "Super Bowl LXI",
        "text": " \nSuper Bowl LXI is the planned American football championship game of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2026 season. The game is scheduled to be played on February 14, 2027, at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California. This would be the ninth Super Bowl hosted by the Greater Los Angeles area, and the second at this venue, the first being Super Bowl LVI in 2022.\nThe game is planned to be nationally televised by ABC and ESPN, marking the first Super Bowl simulcast between the two sister networks, the first time ABC has aired the Super Bowl since Super Bowl XL (21 years earlier), and the first time that ESPN has aired the Super Bowl. There is also the option for Disney Channel and/or Disney XD to produce an alternate telecast similar to Nickelodeon's Super Bowl LVIII.\nBackground.\nHost selection.\nThe league has made all decisions regarding hosting sites from Super Bowl LVII (held in February 2023) onward. There is no bidding process per site: the league selects a potential venue unilaterally, the chosen team puts together a hosting proposal, and then the league votes to determine whether it is acceptable. \nOn December 13, 2023, the NFL announced that SoFi Stadium, home of both the Los Angeles Rams and the Los Angeles Chargers, was selected as the Super Bowl site.\nBroadcasting.\nUnited States.\nTelevision.\nSuper Bowl LXI will be televised nationally by ESPN and simulcast on ABC as part of the 11-year NFL television contract, which allows a four-year rotation between CBS, Fox, NBC and ABC/ESPN. This would mark the first time ABC has aired the Super Bowl since Super Bowl XL, and the first time ever that ESPN has aired the Super Bowl. When ESPN took over the \"Monday Night Football\" package from ABC in 2006, the NFL was reluctant to give the cable network any broadcasting rights to the Super Bowl or any playoff games. ESPN was then given the rights to air a first-round Wild Card playoff game on the channel after the conclusion of the 2014 season. The cable-only playoff game experiment would only last one season, and ABC would start simulcasting ESPN's Wild Card playoff game in the 2015 season. But the NFL refrained from having an ABC/ESPN simulcast of the Super Bowl until Super Bowl LXI.\nIt is expected that ESPN Deportes will air a Spanish-language feed of the game.\nThere is also the option for one of or both of Disney Channel and Disney XD, two children's channels operated by The Walt Disney Company, to carry an kid-focused alternate broadcast of Super Bowl LXI in a similar way to Nickelodeon's simulcast of Super Bowl LVIII. Disney XD has simulcasted the Pro Bowl (both under its original guise and the Pro Bowl Games format) alongside ABC and ESPN since 2019 and Disney+ and ESPN+, two of The Walt Disney Company's streaming services, aired a kid-focused alternative broadcast of an NFL regular season game themed around the \"Toy Story\" franchise in 2023 known as \"\"Toy Story\" Funday Football\". In addition, Disney Channel, Disney XD, Disney+ and ESPN+ have aired alternate broadcasts of NHL games themed around the Disney animated series \"Big City Greens\" and Disney XD has aired Overwatch League esports matches during the OWL's run as part of its short-lived \"D|XP\" block.\nStreaming.\nThe game is planned to be streamed live on NFL+ via mobile devices.\nRadio.\nWestwood One holds the national radio rights to the game."

It began on Sydney Harbour at 13:00 on 26 December 2021, before heading south for via the Tasman Sea, Bass Strait, Storm Bay and up the River Derwent, to cross the finish line in Hobart, Tasmania.\nFollowing the cancelled 2020 race, 112 entries were submitted for the 2021 edition. By 25 December, the starting lineup was down to 91 and only 88 left the harbour to start the race. The mass withdrawal was due to crew members testing positive for COVID-19 or deciding not to compete to avoid catching the virus. 5 boats withdrew in the 24 hours before the race started. For the first time, entries were accepted for a two-handed division (sailed by a crew of 2 people) but, due to the use of autopilot, they were ineligible for the overall handicap prize. Within the first two days, 36 boats retired due to injuries or damage caused by strong weather. 50 completed the race."

He took a more prominent role as a sophomore, leading the Friars' defense in scoring for three consecutive seasons. Unfortunately, the team was only marginally successful during this period. After finishing with a sub-.500 record in 2002, Wood helped Providence keep their heads above water as an upperclassmen but only just. In his final three years, the Friars went 1–6 in playoff games, losing the conference quarterfinals each season. Despite the middling results, Wood was well-regarded and named an All-American as a senior.\nAfter graduating with a degree in business management, he signed a professional contract with the Philadelphia Flyers and began in their minor league system. He split his first full season between the AHL and ECHL, finishing the year with the Trenton Titans and helping the club win the Kelly Cup. After a second divided season, Wood began to move around and played for four different teams over a two year period. In 2008 he travelled to Europe and played two more years before retiring.\nWood's second career began shortly thereafter when he started working as an account executive for Hitachi Data Systems. After five years he joined Dell Technologies as a global account manager. In 2017, Wood left the accounting world and founded his own company, Beyond the Ice. The business provides a 7-week virtual hockey school for youth players, focusing on character building and mental aspects of the game."

        "title": "Diversity in swimming",
        "text": "The racial composition of swimming and other aquatic sports has long been influenced by the history of segregation and violence at pools as well as the building patterns of public and private pools in America. Throughout U.S. history, pools have existed at the background of conversations around racism, discrimination, and the lasting impacts of systemic inequalities on accessibility. The exclusion of people of color from public pools during the 20th century not only denied them a space for recreation and exercise but also reinforced disparities that persist to this day. African Americans, in particular, continue to be underrepresented in swimming and aquatic sports, many facing barriers such as lack of access to swimming lessons, limited exposure to water-based activities, and lingering stereotypes of swimming as a \"white\" sport. \nTransformation of Pools.\nPools as Bath Houses.\nWhen swimming first became popular in America, pools were segregated by gender and class, not race. At the end of the 19th century and early 20th century, municipal pools were built in the north mainly for poor, urban, working class Americans and used as bathing sites. Large groups of working class men and women flocked into their gender assigned public pools and rid themselves of the dirt and grime acquired over the course of their day, while wealthier middle and upper class citizens used their own private baths to clean. This picture changed as a result of the redefinition of the germ theory of disease in the late 1890s. This change concluded that disease was not linked to dirtiness but rather linked to small microbes transferred by physical contact between people and the touching of shared objects or spaces. Pools, as the bathing site for many working class Americans, were now recognized as a public health danger so cities built bath house facilities instead of pools.\nThe Privatization of Pools.\nAfter the revelation of the germ theory of disease, the influence and popularity of pools was not completely diminished but rather transformed. Pools became an arena for exercise, leisure, and sport -- not cleanliness. In West Chicago Park, the Chicago Douglass Park Pool was built for the purpose of sport with a longer length suited for race competition, areas for spectators, and springboards. Initially, the facilities brought together a diverse group of poolgoers with people of all races from nearby middle and lower-class neighborhoods attending. However, soon the park board began charging an entry fee to cut down on the costs of the park, simultaneously ridding it of the boisterous lower class boys that always seemed to cause problems. It was entry fees and intentionally choosing wealthier areas to be the host of pools that sidelined many lower-class Americans, both Black and white, from using the nice public pools. \nSeveral strategies began being implemented by city and state officials to minimize the presence of minorities at public pools. The rise of club memberships and annual fees swept the United States around the time of the Civil Rights Movement in an effort to exclude lower-income families from pools. Some public pools changed their hours to make it increasingly difficult for working parents to bring their children, including closing on weekends and only having open hours during the day. Other pools opted to entirely drain their pools in order to avoid integration. \nThe mid-1900s saw millions of white families leaving their homes to move into newly suburban communities, where they invested in country clubs and private recreational facilities of their own, ultimately withdrawing the taxpayer and monetary power needed to build, expand, develop, and maintain public pools. Budget constraints for public pools have led to complications such as neglect of equipment and decreased staff. This phenomenon occurred throughout the country. Between 1970 and 1980, when Clevland’s white population of the city decreased by 250,000, their recreational budget was cut by over 80%. In Mississippi, nearly 50% of all public pools had closed by 1972. Meanwhile, residential pools in the United States more than tripled between 1971 and 2000. \nModern Day Pools.\nOver time, the number of public swimming pools in the United States decreased dramatically, reflecting the persistent legacy of racism and segregation in American society. Today, while there are more than 10 million swimming pools throughout the U.S. – approximately one pool per 30 citizens – only 309,000 are public – boiling down to just one public pool per 1,050 citizens. So although the United States has more pools than most other countries, they are highly concentrated among private (and oftentimes inaccessible) spaces.\nThe last significant monetary investment in public pools was shortly after the Great Depression under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and since then, there has been a noticeable lack of state and federal funding. As of 2023, 96.91% of pools in the United States are private (hotels, schools, or home-owned), showcasing the difficulty of access to these facilities for the general public. Most of these private pools opened between 1950 to 1962, at around the same time as national desegregation. \nCurrently, the United States is undergoing a “pool shortage” – and neighborhoods of color are suffering at the forefront of this deficiency. In June of 2023, Algonquin, West Louisvelle’s only public pool, was shut down for repairs due to decades of neglected maintenance – leaving the city of over 60,000 residents without convenient access to any pool. Characterized as a predominantly black community, West Louisville especially suffers from further disparities in swimming ability and water safety. Across the United States, black and brown cities face this same story of disinvestment in public amenities and infrastructural neglect, exacerbating pre-existing disparities. \nGender Segregation.\nFrom the 1890s to the 1920s, many pools were gender segregated due to the visual and physical intimacy created by the pool deck atmosphere. Swimming suits for both men and women involved minimal clothing and coverage, thus making the pool deck area visually intimate. In addition, the social and interactive aspects of swimming also made way for more physical contact, both intentional and accidental, between fellow swimmers. The issue of men and women swimming together eventually became the grounds by which many pools were segregated.\nUpon desegregation in the 50s and 60s, the added complexity of racial tensions to these gender dynamics further acted as fuel to complicate public swimming in the United States. Black men, in particular, faced compounding barriers to swimming due to the intersection of racial and gender-based stereotypes. Societal ideas about the hyper-sexuality of black women and men have perpetuated harmful narratives surrounding their presence and integration in public swimming spaces. During this period, the rise of fashion trends that popularized more revealing feminine swimwear also fueled race-gender tensions. \nThese narratives made it to the legal courts, too; shortly after the decision of Brown v. Board, the NAACP initiated a local trial in Baltimore seeking to desegregate the city’s municipal pools. Ultimately, the Baltimore attorney decided that despite the Supreme Court’s decision to desegregate public schools, public pools were “too intimate” of a place for integration, specifically alluding to the potential dangers of white women and black men sharing sexualized spaces. Concerned with interracial intimacy, white American society upheld segregationist policies within public swimming places for much longer than the desegregation of other public facilities. \nRacial Segregation of Pools in America.\nDe Jure Segregation.\nLocal governments officially segregated pools in their cities and deployed police officers to enforce these laws.\nDe Facto Segregation.\nFor pools that were not legally segregated, white swimmers intimidated and inflicted violence, such as drownings and beatings, on Black swimmers to enforce the divisions.\nTransition to Racial Segregation.\nPool Intimacy.\nIn the 1920s during the first pool building boom in the United States, pools began to be gender integrated in an attempt to promote family, community, and the pool as a prominent area for socialization. As gender integration was implemented, racial segregation was simultaneously adopted due to the physical and visual intimacy of swimming attire and pool decks. Pools physically intimacy, stemming from the sharing of the same water, made way for racist assumptions determining that Black Americans were dirtier and thus had more diseases that white people could contract from swimming together. Also, because of the minimal coverage of swimsuits and close proximity of poolgoers, the racist belief that Black men were “sexually aggressive” led to racial segregation of pools because white men didn't want Black men and white women to interact. The white community feared that integrated pools would allow Black men to “visually consume”, touch, assault, and rape white women. The threat of sexual violence on white women was the grounds by which pools were segregated. \nRacialized Masculinity.\nEarly 20th-century prevailing social expectations deemed black men as overly masculine and as a perceived threat to white masculinity, sparking concerns that the presence of African American males in public pools would undermine white male supremacy. Thus, the exclusion of African American participants from certain spaces, including access to pools, was often motivated by an underlying desire to maintain racial segregation and uphold notions of white superiority. Using their positions of power, white men in city council authorities and social authority to perpetuate sentiments of fear and reinforce racial segregation. By enacting and enforcing discriminatory policies, these individuals sought to assert and maintain white supremacy, safeguarding their perceived social dominance and privilege. \nThe Great Migration.\nThe Great Migration changed the matter of cleanliness in pools from a class issue from the 1890s to the 1910s to a race issue from the 1920s to the 1930s due to the development of city slums of Black Americas.\nThe Great Migration was the movement of millions of Black Americans from the rural south to north, west, and midwest cities from the mid 1910s to the 1930s. A key impact of the Great Migration is the development of redlining and race restrictive housing covenants in the north to concentrate Black Americans in specific neighborhoods. Black communities dealt with restrictive housing covenants and higher rent prices which left many Black Americans with minimal options for housing. As a result, Black families were forced to subdivide their apartments and cram in extra tenants to make the inflated monthly rent payments, which left little money or time for regular maintenance of their homes. Black neighborhoods quickly became run down and overcrowded at the hands of this cycle. From a white Americans' perspective, Black migrants replaced the poor, white, European immigrants that previously inhabited the slums: the noticeably dilapidated working class neighborhoods were now solely identified as Black communities. The worry of disease transmission in bathhouses and recreational pools was now linked to Black Americans. Pools were also unlikely to be built in or near these overcrowded black neighborhoods and entry and membership fees for other pools would have been unaffordable to Black Americans. The Great Migration shifted the societal view on cleanliness to an issue of the Black community and created deteriorated Black neighborhoods with little access to aquatic facilities.\nNew Deal &amp; Swimming.\nFollowing the initial pool boom from 1920 to 1929, public pool construction slowed as the Great Depression began. The building and repair and renovation of pools also gave jobs to millions of unemployed Americans under the New Deal agency known as the Civil Works Administration (CWA) which later became the Works Progress Administration (WPA). In the United States, the WPA workers built 805 new swimming pools and 848 wading pools while repairing or improving 339 existing pools. The pools built and improved were described to be \"examples of state-of-the-art engineering\" with \"massive filtration systems, heating units, and even underwater lighting\" and also able to adapt to off-season recreation uses like tennis, handball, and volleyball. Pools were built in even the smallest towns and cities uniting the communities in recreation and companionship and serving as a reminder of the government's assistance during the crisis of the Great Depression.\nSince this major investment, pools and most other public recreational facilities have not been able to get this level of funding. So although pools built during the New Deal era served as symbols of progress and community unity, many have since fallen into disrepair or been closed due to budget constraints and changing priorities. The lack of sustained investment in public pools has caused detrimental effects on marginalized communities, where access to safe and affordable recreational opportunities remain extremely limited. In urban areas of predominantly minority populations, the closure of public pools has left residents with few options for swimming and water-based recreation, exacerbating existing health and social disparities. Further, the decline in public pool infrastructure has contributed to the privatization of swimming facilities, with many communities shifting to expensive membership-based pools or water parks for recreational swimming -- widening the gap in access to swimming between affluent and low-income communities. \nDesegregation of Pools.\nLegal End of Segregation.\nIn the early 1960s, African American swimmers were still banned from swimming in white owned pool in places such as Centennial Park Swimming Pool in Nashville, Tennessee. Although some cities and public pools already had begun the process of desegregation, in 1954, due to the \"Brown v. Board of Education\" decision that declared the separate but equal doctrine unconstitutional, segregation in the public sphere became illegal. Thus the division of public pools on the basis of race also became illegal because the designation of public pools based on race was inherenty unequal. Later, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 further made the segregation of public facilities illegal by prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race and color.\nWhite Flight.\nDespite this judicial decision and government legislation, because many pools were unofficially segregated through violence and intimidation by white swimmers, the issue of access for the Black community in many ways persisted. Desegregation often brought intense racial conflict at pools so sometimes Blacks were not admitted on the grounds that their use would cause “disorder” among pool goers. In addition, instead of participating in integrated swimming, whites fled in mass numbers to the newly developed suburbs home to their private home pools and extensive aquatic facilities provided by their expensive, member-only country clubs. For example, the average number of daily white swimmers at a pool in Druid Park, Baltimore plummeted from 775 swimmers in 1955 to just six swimmers in 1956 post desegregation. This retreat marked a new private pool building boom that took place during the 1950s and 1960s which was almost exclusively accessible to whites. The boom included the construction of thousands of house pools and private swim clubs in suburban America. During the mass construction of private pools, the Federal Housing Administration openly discouraged the building of public pools, which were most accessible to Black and lower class Americans, but encouraged private pools, which were solely available to wealthy whites living in the suburbs.\nPrivate club memberships and home pools were exclusively available to wealthy, mainly white, Americans and their departure of the cities left the state of public pools uncertain. Without white Americans flocking to the pools for exercise and on hot summer days, there was no longer an urgent need for public pools. Cities closed and defunded pools altogether leaving almost no pools for the millions of Blacks concentrated in American cities.\n\"Palmer v. Thompson\".\nThe Supreme Court case \"Palmer v. Thompson\" addressed the issue of shutting down public pools -- the only pools accessible to the poor -- post desegregation. The case involved the city of Jackson, Mississippi closing four public pools and transferring the fifth to the YMCA, which was only available to whites. In 1971, the court ruled that the city government could choose to not operate their desegregated facilities if the decision appeared neutral at face value and they are spreading “equal damage” on each person in the area. However, in reality the damage was not equal: the city closed all of the public pools that were affordable to lower income residents whom were largely composed of Black Americans.\nMajor Incidents and Turning Points.\nHighland Park Pool (Pittsburg, PA).\nOn opening day of the pool park in 1931, that included two gender integrated pools, a sun deck, and a sandy beach area that overall could hold 10,000 people, prospective Black swimmers were asked to present a “health certificate” indicating the individual was disease free, while white swimmers entered without problem. When some Black swimmers were finally able to get into the park area, violence ensued: a group of Black swimmers who endured verbal intimidation to enter the pool were pelted by rocks, dunked, and punched by white swimmers, while police stationed on deck did nothing except charge the Black swimmers with inciting a riot. In 1935, a Girl Scout troop composed of Black youth organized a day to go to Highland Park Pool with the assistance of the mayor of Pittsburg. The girls were dunked and splashed by a mob of white youth as stationed police officers turned a blind eye.\nPaulson Pool (Pittsburg, PA).\nIn July 1935, at the gender-segregated Paulson Pool, nine year old Frank Reynolds was punched and kicked in the dressing room by a gang of white kids then later held underwater by the same group. When Reynolds’ mother filed a police report, inspector Kellie of the local police station, scolded her saying “Why can’t you people use the Washington Boulevard pool (the pool designated for Black swimmers also known as the “Jim Crow Pool”) … I don’t approve of colored and white people swimming together”.\nFairgrounds Pool Park (St. Louis, MO).\nThe Fairgrounds Pool Park, originally built in 1919, reopened on June 21, 1949 for the first day of racially integrated swimming. Black swimmers lined up to enter the pool while being berated by loud boos from white youth outside of the fence surrounding the area. Inside the pool park, a Black man and white youth were stabbed and ten plus others were injured during the ongoing violence that took place over the course of the entire day. Some intimidated Black swimmers who retreated from the pool were followed and beaten up in a nearby street, while those that stayed faced attacks by whites in the pool.\nWhen the pool closed to youths at 5pm, a white mob that had been growing the entire day roamed the park with bats and clubs attacking every Black person in sight. This event became known as the Fairground Park riot: an event of such violence that the city of St. Louis resorted to segregation to maintain the peace.\nThe NAACP fought the decision to re-segregate the pool and filed a lawsuit that eventually ended segregation at Fairgrounds pool park the very next summer. That summer, the number of swimmers plummeted from 313,000 to 10,000 swimmers and just six years later in 1956 the pool was closed completely.\nMonson Motor Lodge (St. Augustine, Fl).\nMonson Motor Lodge in northern Florida was a hotspot for leisure and tourism. In the early 1960s, Monson Motor Lodge was still illegally segregated, actively denying access to the pool and other amenities to people of color. On June 11th, 1964, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was refused service by the hotel manager. After refusing to leave, the manager called law enforcement and got Dr. King arrested and sent to Saint Augustine Jail, where he famously wrote “Letter from the Saint Augustine Jail”, calling for people to continue the fight against racial discrimination at Monson Motor Lodge. \nOn June 18, 1964, black and white protestors entered the strictly whites-only pool in Monson Motor Lodge in St. Augustine, Florida. This effort also included college students on Spring Break, where they joined forces with local Civil Rights activists to protest the segregation in Monson Motor Lodge. Over 17 Rabbis and several more protestors were arrested in one of the largest mass arrests of the decade. During this chaos, college students and other young activists jumped into the Monson Motor Lodge pools in what would later famously be known as a 'wade-in'. In an attempt to rid the protestors, Monson Motor Lodge owner James Brock then poured muriatic acid on the swimmers. This image of Brock dumping buckets of acid on the swimmers made it all over U.S. newspapers and media, serving as the face of the Civil Rights Movement in Florida. \nThe next day, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed into law the Civil Rights Act of 1964 -- which many believe was an immediate product of the national embarrassment that the Monson Motor Lodge incident caused.\nMonson Motor Lodge was demolished in 2003, against the demands of protestors who wanted to preserve the national memory of one of the greatest Civil Rights sit-ins of the 20th century. Replacing it was a new hotel, Hilton Bayfront, with only a singular plaque commemorating the efforts of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, the Rabbis, and the college students on Spring Break that catapulted the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\nDorothy Dandridge Pool Show (Las Vegas, NV).\nA Las Vegas hotel completely drained their pool in 1953 because nationally-renowned Black entertainer Dorothy Dandridge stuck her toe in the water during one of her performances.\nSwimming at Historically Black Colleges and Universities.\nHoward University.\nAs far back as the 1920s, African American swim coach Clarence Pendleton made significant efforts to have the Howard University swim team nationally recognized and award the team the ability to compete with other swim teams. By 1933 he was no longer coaching the team but returned to Howard to give a talk about swimming. In the 1950s, while recreational facilities were still segregated in Washington, D.C., Pendleton worked as a superintendent for the \"colored\" facilities. Despite continued employment in aquatics and recreational jobs, Pendlton Sr. and his wife struggled financially due to segretation. Pendleton Sr. instilled a strong work ethic in his son, Clarence M. Pendleton Jr., who also coached the Howard Swim team. Pendleton, Jr., who was also known as Penny, was quoted as saying his father was a strict disciplinarian who highly valued education and frequently told his son, \"If you don't think, you stink.\" In 1965, Pendleton, Jr. traveled to Egypt to coach and mentor Egyptian athletes. In the 1980s, Pendleton's son controversially served as chair of the United States Commission on Civil Rights under President Ronald Reagan.\nHoward University is the only HBCU Division 1 team in the United States. As a team that is composed of almost all black swimmers, they are actively fighting the stereotype that black people are less capable swimmers. This assumption along with the fact that minority Americans are twice as likely to drown than white Americans have prompted the Howard team to fight this problem. Occasionally, the team, Sigma Gamma Rho sorority, and Olympians Maritza McClendon and Cullen Jones have worked together to provide free swim clinics to kids in the DC community.\nSandra Ann Arrington.\nIn 1966 a woman named Sandra Ann Arrington from Columbus, Ohio joined coach Clarence Pendleton, Jr.'s team roster at Howard University as the only woman on the swim team. She was promised the opportunity to tryout for the team when she enrolled at Howard. While at Howard she competed in numerous swimming events and majored in physical education. As a result of her accomplishments in the pool, Arrington was featured in both Jet and Ebony Magazines. In December 1966 she won first place in a diving competition against Millersville State College. The press coverage highlighting her accomplishments frequently mentioned her gender. For example, the Howard University Hilltop newspaper referred to her in print as a \"lady diver.\"\nIn 1967 Arrington defeated the men she competed against in a diving competition in the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association (CIAA).\nSpelman College.\nIn 1961 a swim club for women at Spelman College was established.\nMedia Influences.\nTV Shows \nAdvertising\nLasting Legacy.\nThe impacts of the United States' history of exclusionary, discriminatory, and racially-charged practices in swimming pools have created cross-generational effects, shaping social, cultural, and health implications, particularly for communities of color. \nEvery year in the United States there are an estimated:\nDrowning death rates for people of color in the United States are higher than the drowning rates of white people.

Although Shiffrin won the next race on 11 January in Schladming and set a career record for World Cup victories in any discipline with her 47th slalom victory, Vlhová finished second and, with a 220-point lead and just two more races scheduled on the slalom calendar for 2021-22, she clinched the season crystal globe in slalom over two months before the end of the season.\nAs noted above, the season was interrupted by the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, China (at the Yanqing National Alpine Skiing Centre in Yanqing District) from 6–19 February 2022. Although the Alpine Skiing branch of the International Ski Federation (FIS) conducts the World Cup and co-organizes the Alpine skiing at the Winter Olympics (along with the International Olympic Committee {IOC)), the Winter Olympics are organized by nation (a maximum of four skiers is permitted per nation), and (after 1968) the Olympic results do not count for World Cup points. Accordingly, the results in the Olympics are highlighted in blue and shown in this table by ordinal position only in each discipline. The women's slalom was held at the \"Ice River\" course on 9 February 2022.\nThe World Cup final was held on Saturday, 19 March in the linked resorts of Courchevel and Méribel, France, which are located in Les Trois Vallées, on the Roc de Fer course at Méribel. Only the top 25 skiers in the World Cup giant slalom discipline and the winner of the Junior World Championship, plus athletes who have scored at least 500 points in the World Cup overall classification for the season, are eligible to compete in the final, and only the top 15 earn World Cup points. 2022 World Junior champion Zrinka Ljutić of Croatia surprisingly finished fifth in the final."

        "text": "The 2022–23 UEFA Champions League qualifying phase and play-off round began on 21 June and ended on 24 August 2022.\nA total of 52 teams competed in the qualifying system of the 2022–23 UEFA Champions League, which included the qualifying phase and the play-off round, with 42 teams in Champions Path and 10 teams in League Path. The six winners in the play-off round (four from Champions Path, two from League Path) advanced to the group stage, to join the 26 teams that enter in the group stage.\nTimes are CEST (), as listed by UEFA (local times, if different, are in parentheses).\nTeams.\nChampions Path.\nThe Champions Path included all league champions which did not qualify directly for the group stage, and consisted of the following rounds:\nAll teams eliminated from the Champions Path entered either the Europa League or the Europa Conference League:\nBelow are the participating teams of the Champions Path (with their 2022 UEFA club coefficients), grouped by their starting rounds.\nLeague Path.\nThe League Path included all league non-champions which did not qualify directly for the group stage, and consisted of the following rounds:\nAll teams eliminated from the League Path entered the Europa League:\nBelow are the participating teams of the League Path (with their 2022 UEFA club coefficients), grouped by their starting rounds.\nFormat.\nEach tie, apart from the preliminary round, was played over two legs, with each team playing one leg at home. The team that scored more goals on aggregate over the two legs advanced to the next round. If the aggregate score was level at the end of normal time of the second leg, extra time was played, and if the same number of goals were scored by both teams during extra time, the tie was decided by a penalty shoot-out.\nIn the preliminary round, the semi-finals and final were played as a single match hosted by one of the participating teams. If the score was level at the end of normal time, extra time was played, and if the same number of goals were scored by both teams during extra time, the tie was decided by a penalty shoot-out.\nThe 2022–23 season saw the video assistant referee (VAR) used for the first time during the qualification phase following its introduction in the third qualifying round.\nIn the draws for each round, teams were seeded based on their UEFA club coefficients at the beginning of the season, with the teams divided into seeded and unseeded pots containing the same number of teams. A seeded team was drawn against an unseeded team, with the order of legs (or the administrative \"home\" team in the preliminary round matches) in each tie decided by draw. As the identity of the winners of the previous round was not known at the time of the draws, the seeding was carried out under the assumption that the team with the higher coefficient of an undecided tie advanced to this round, which means if the team with the lower coefficient was to advance, it simply took the seeding of its opponent. Prior to the draws, UEFA formed \"groups\" in accordance with the principles set by the Club Competitions Committee, but they were purely for convenience of the draw and did not resemble any real groupings in the sense of the competition. Teams from associations with political conflicts as decided by UEFA should not be drawn into the same tie. After the draws, the order of legs of a tie could be reversed by UEFA due to scheduling or venue conflicts.\nSchedule.\nThe schedule of the competition was as follows (all draws were held at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland).\nPreliminary round.\nThe preliminary round consisted of two semi-finals on 21 June 2022 and the final on 24 June 2022. The draw for the preliminary round was held on 7 June 2022.\nSeeding.\n&lt;section begin=PR /&gt;\nA total of four teams played in the preliminary round. Seeding of teams was based on their 2022 UEFA club coefficients, with two seeded teams and two unseeded teams in the semi-finals. The matches took place at Víkingsvöllur in Reykjavík, Iceland so the first team drawn in each tie in the semi-finals, and also the final (between the two winners of the semi-finals, whose identity was not known at the time of draw), would be the \"home\" team for administrative purposes. &lt;section end=PR /&gt;\nSummary.\nThe preliminary round matches consisted of two semi-finals on 21 June 2022 and the final on 24 June 2022.\n&lt;section begin=PR /&gt;The winner of the preliminary round final advanced to the first qualifying round. The losers of the semi-finals and final were transferred to the Europa Conference League Champions Path second qualifying round.\nFirst qualifying round.\n&lt;section begin=Q1 /&gt;\nThe draw for the first qualifying round was held on 14 June 2022. &lt;section end=Q1 /&gt;\nSeeding.\nA total of 30 teams played in the first qualifying round: 29 teams which enter in this round, and 1 winner of the preliminary round. Seeding of teams was based on their 2022 UEFA club coefficients. For the winner of the preliminary round, whose identity was not known at the time of draw, the club coefficient of the highest-ranked remaining team was used. Prior to the draw, UEFA formed three groups of five seeded teams and five unseeded teams in accordance with the principles set by the Club Competitions Committee. The first team drawn in each tie would be the home team of the first leg.\nSummary.\n&lt;section begin=Q1 /&gt;The first legs were played on 5 and 6 July, and the second legs were played on 12 and 13 July 2022.\nThe winners of the ties advanced to the Champions Path second qualifying round.

        "text": "The 1930–31 Clarkson Golden Knights men's ice hockey season was the 11th season of play for the program. The team was coached by Jack Roos in his 2nd season.\nSeason.\nWith Clarkson having established itself as one of, if not the, best team in the country outside of the 'Big Four', Tech was able to schedule games against three of college hockey's elites this season. The only missing team from their slate was Harvard and despite rumors to the contrary, the two wouldn't until 1935. Clarkson didn't lose any players to graduation and were expected to be even better this season. Early on, however, injuries and departures left their offense struggling. While the first scheduled game of the season, a match against Loyola, was cancelled, the meeting with Victoria College was able to be played. Without Guest, Levia and Bob Houston, the team's offense looked strong but disjointed, failing to score on several early opportunities. The same could not be said for the defense, which was as stout as it had ever been. Wally Easton earned his first shutout of the season and Clarkson started off the year with a win.\nThe team then headed south for a swing through southern New England. The first match came against Princeton, who had already compiled a record of 9–1 and were in the running for the national championship. The game was filled with penalties but the defenses for both teams were all but impenetrable. Clarence 'Ike' Houston scored a shorthanded marker near the end of the first and Easton turned aside shot after shot for the remainder of the game. Despite a furious attack from the Tigers, Houston's goal stood as the game-winner and Easton earned a second shutout. Two nights later the team was in Williamstown and had another game slowed by infractions. Easton, however, was equal to the task once more and posted his third goose egg and set a program record for consecutive shutouts that still stands (as of 2021).\nFor the fourth game of the season, the Knights faces defending national champion Yale. With the way the early part of the season was shaping up, it could possibly decide the eastern intercollegiate championship. Unfortunately for Clarkson, they were completely outplayed by the Elis. The team appeared disorganized and allowed 4 goals to the Bulldogs while their offense was nonexistent. Even late in the game, with Yale down two players, Clarkson was unable to find the back of the net and were themselves shutout for the first time in over 5 years.\nThe loss seemed to awaken Clarkson's offense from its slumber. While swapping Moore and Guest in as the starting defenseman, the Knights scored 14 goals in two home games against Canadian teams and continued to score for the remainder of the season. 'Peck' Donald was particularly strong during this time, leading the attack from his center position. The match against Dartmouth was more lopsided than expected, not least of which because the Indians were weaker than anticipated this season. This time Ike Houston was the star, netting 4 goals in the game.\nBack home, the team found the weather to be freezing, which was good for their ice conditions, but bad for attendance. The sub-zero weather didn't harm the on-ice product, however, and Clarkson kept rolling with wins over St. Patrick's (of Ottawa) and the Ottawa Gee-Gees. The team ended its official season with a road match at Ithaca. On one of the rare occasions that Beebe Lake had good playing ice, Clarkson knocked off Cornell with Donald scoring a hat-trick. The following weekend, the team assembled for an exhibition match against an All-Star squad at the Syracuse Coliseum.\nThe loss to Yale may have prevented the team from earning its first national championship, however, Clarkson was in a dead heat with Harvard for the runner-up position.\nBernard LaRue served as team manager for the season with Donald Orton as his assistant.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "text": "The 8th FINA World Junior Swimming Championships was held from 30 August to 4 September 2022 at the Videna Aquatic Center in Lima, Peru. It was open to competition for girls ages 14 to 17 years old and boys ages 15 to 18 years old at the end of the 2022 calendar year. All events were conducted in a 50-metre (long course) pool.\nOriginally the competition was planned for 24–29 August 2021, however the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in its postponement to 24–29 August 2022. In April 2022, FINA announced a change of dates as well as a change host from Kazan, Russia to Lima, Peru due to the 2022 Russia invasion of Ukraine. The same month, FINA announced athletes and officials from Belarus and Russia were banned from the Championships.\nQualification.\nVarious qualification systems were implemented internationally, one of which used by Swimming New Zealand and Swimming South Africa was the selection of swimmers to compete at the 8th World Junior Swimming Championships from pre-defined national-level competitions based on the swimmers's times and overall national rank of their performances across the defined competitions, only the top two were eligible per individual event. Another selection procedure, put forward by Swim Ireland before the location and dates of the Championships were changed and retained after the change, was based on swimmers achieving pre-defined consideration times at a national championships or the 2022 European Junior Championships and overall national rank. Prior to the change of dates and location in 2022, British Swimming also announced a selection procedure, basing selection on swimmer performances at a single selection meet, the 2022 British Swimming Championships.\nSchedule.\nA total of 42 events were competed over six days, starting on 30 August and concluding on 4 September.\nResults.\nMen's events.\n Swimmers who participated in the heats only and received medals.\nWomen's events.\n Swimmers who participated in the heats only and received medals.\nMixed events.\n Swimmers who participated in the heats only and received medals.\nChampionships records set.\nThe following Championships records were set during the course of competition.\nParticipating countries.\nSwimmers from the following countries participated at the Championships.\nChange of dates and location.\nPostponement due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn March 2021, British Swimming announced that the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic combined with other factors, including no publicly revealed dates nor venue for the 8th World Junior Swimming Championships, had changed how they were conducting their selection trials for the 2020 Summer Olympics. By the end of the month, Swimming Australia had withdrawn its swimmers for the championships due to concerns about transmission of COVID-19 to its athletes. The following month Swimming Canada pulled out of the competition as well, in part due to concerns about the health and safety of its swimmers and in part due to difficulties fairly running qualification events. Two months later, in June, FINA postponed the championships to August 2022 in the pursuit of safer travel conditions and less COVID-19 related risks for participating athletes. Frustration was vocalized by USA Swimming following the postponement of the championships, and youth who would have competed at the championships had they been held in 2021 instead competed at the 2021 FINA Swimming World Cup.\nPath to cancelation.\nThe 8th World Junior Swimming Championships was originally scheduled to take place at the Palace of Water Sports in Kazan, Russia in 2021, and in June 2021 it was postponed to 24–29 August 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This followed the implementation of a ban by the Court of Arbitration for Sport spanning 17 December 2020 to 16 December 2022 not allowing Russians to compete at World Championships with their country name, flag, or anthem, meaning Russian youth competing at this Championships would be required to compete without their country name, flag, and anthem in their own country.\nOn 25 February 2022, elevated political tensions between Russia and Ukraine resulted in FINA cancelling water polo, artistic swimming and diving events that had been scheduled to take place in Russia for March and April 2022, in regards to other competitions scheduled to take place in Russia for the 2022 year, FINA stated, \"Other FINA events that are scheduled in Russia for later in the year are under close review, with FINA monitoring events in Ukraine very carefully.\"\nOn 26 February 2022, nine members of various Nordic Swimming Federations published a joint statement announcing their withdrawal from the Championships if it is hosted in Russia as a form of protest in opposition to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. The following national swimming federation presidents signed the statement: Danish Swimming Union (Denmark), Estonian Swimming Federation (Estonia), Faroe Islands Swimming Association (Faroe Islands), Finnish Swimming Federation (Finland), Icelandic Swimming Association (Iceland), Latvian Swimming Federation (Latvia), Lithuanian Swimming Federation (Lithuania), Norwegian Swimming Federation (Norway), and Swedish Swimming Federation (Sweden).\nOn 27 February 2022, FINA published an official statement canceling the 8th FINA World Junior Swimming Championships. FINA was one of a number of sporting organizations, which also included Formula One and the International Ski Federation, to boycott holding competitions in Russia by canceling an event originally scheduled to be held in the county.\nPath to reinstatement.\nOn 23 March 2022, FINA announced its intent to reinstate the 8th World Junior Swimming Championships with a change host venue and possibly dates. The same day, FINA announced the Russian Swimming Federation had earlier withdrawn its athletes from FINA events for the remainder of the 2022 calendar year, meaning they would not send athletes to the Championships.\nOn 14 April 2022, FINA announced the reinstatement of the Championships with Lima, Peru serving as the new host of the event, Videna Aquatic Center serving as the new venue, and a change of dates to 30 August through 4 September 2022.\nOn 21 April 2022, FINA published a statement instituting a ban on all athletes and officials from Russia and Belarus for the Championships, and all remaining FINA events in 2022."

        "text": "The 2022 Daytona 500 was the first stock car race of the 2022 NASCAR Cup Series and the 64th running of the event. The race was held on Sunday, February 20, 2022, in Daytona Beach, Florida at Daytona International Speedway, a asphalt superspeedway. In a green-white-checker finish, rookie Austin Cindric, driving for Team Penske, led 21 of the final 45 laps and held off challenges from teammate Ryan Blaney, RFK Racing's Brad Keselowski and eventual second-place finisher Bubba Wallace of 23XI Racing to win his first career NASCAR Cup Series race. Chase Briscoe of Stewart-Haas Racing finished third. Team Penske dedicated their Daytona 500 win to legendary sportscaster Bob Jenkins after the race. Jenkins used to broadcast NASCAR Races on ESPN from 1981 to 2000.\nThis race marked the point race debut of the Next Gen car, which replaced the previous Generation 6 car body.\nReport.\nDaytona International Speedway is a race track in Daytona Beach, Florida that is one of six superspeedways, the others being Auto Club Speedway, Pocono Raceway, Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Michigan International Speedway, and Talladega Superspeedway.\nBackground.\nDaytona International Speedway is one of three superspeedways to hold NASCAR races, the other two being Indianapolis Motor Speedway and Talladega Superspeedway. The standard track at Daytona International Speedway is a four-turn superspeedway that is long. The track's turns are banked at 31 degrees, while the front stretch, the location of the finish line, is banked at 18 degrees.\nDue to shortage issues surrounding the new Next Gen car, it was planned that the team that won the race would retain their car for the rest of the season, with NASCAR instead scanning the winner's car and place an identical paint scheme wrap (complete with Victory Lane confetti) on a prototype that would be shown at the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America, with the tradition of the exact winner's car being displayed at the Hall of Fame (formerly the Daytona 500 Experience) for a year being scheduled to continue in 2023. However, it was later announced on March 8 that Austin Cindric's exact winning car would be displayed at the Hall of Fame.\nThis was the first Daytona 500 without 2008 winner Ryan Newman since 2001. This was the first Daytona 500 for The Money Team Racing and Team Hezeberg. This was also the first Daytona 500 since 2016 to feature Greg Biffle, and the first Daytona 500 ever to feature Jacques Villeneuve. (Villeneuve previously failed to qualify for the event in 2008.)\nPractice.\nFirst practice (February 15).\nMichael McDowell was the fastest in the first practice session with a time of 46.696 seconds and a speed of .\nSecond practice (February 15).\nRyan Blaney was the fastest in the second practice session with a time of 46.732 seconds and a speed of .\nQualifying.\nKyle Larson scored the pole for the race with a time of 49.680 and a speed of .\nBluegreen Vacations Duel.\nThe Bluegreen Vacations Duels are a pair of NASCAR Cup Series races held in conjunction with the Daytona 500 annually in February at Daytona International Speedway. They consist of two races 60 laps and 150 miles (240 km) in length, which serve as heat races that set the lineup for the Daytona 500. The first race sets the lineup for cars that qualified in odd-numbered positions on pole qualifying day, while the second race sets the lineup for cars that qualified in even-numbered positions. The Duels set the lineup for positions 3–38, while positions 39 and 40 are filled by the two \"Open\" (teams without a charter) cars that set the fastest times in qualifying, but did not lock in a spot in the Duels.\nPractice (post–Duels).\nThird practice (February 18).\nMichael McDowell was the fastest in the third practice session with a time of 46.710 seconds and a speed of .\nFinal practice (February 19).\nHarrison Burton was the fastest in the final practice session with a time of 47.782 seconds and a speed of .\nRace.\nStarting in 3rd place, Brad Keselowski took the lead from Kyle Larson and Alex Bowman and led the first lap of the race. On lap 7, Keselowski began to battle for the lead with Kyle Busch with Busch leading that lap but Keselowski got out in front of Busch on lap 8. On lap 27, Busch took the lead from Keselowski but Keselowski battled with him on lap 32 which Keselowski would lead that lap before Busch took it back the next lap. During green flag pitstops on lap 39, Jacques Villeneuve, making his first Daytona 500 start, spun coming to pit road and was able to keep the car going and no caution was thrown. The first caution flew on lap 41 when Kaz Grala's right rear wheel came off and Chase Briscoe got turned by Austin Cindric. The race restarted on lap 46 with Kyle Busch remaining as the leader. On lap 52, the second caution flew when Justin Haley's right front wheel came off. The race restarted on lap 57 with Kyle Busch remaining as the leader. On lap 58, William Byron took the lead from Busch. Harrison Burton took the lead from Byron on lap 59 but Burton lost the lead to Martin Truex Jr. on lap 61. With 3 laps to go in stage 1 on lap 63, an 8 car wreck occurred on the backstretch. It started when Brad Keselowski was pushing Harrison Burton when Keselowski pushed Burton at the wrong angle turning Burton into William Byron, Kyle Busch, Denny Hamlin, Ross Chastain, Christopher Bell, and Alex Bowman. Burton's car caught air, flipped over, and landed back on all 4 of his wheels. Everyone walked away ok. Stage 1 ended under caution with Martin Truex Jr. winning the stage. Ryan Blaney led the field to the restart on lap 72. After green flag pit stops, Brad Keselowski took the lead on lap 110. On lap 125, Kyle Larson took the lead from Keselowski but Keselowski took it back from Larson on the next lap. With 2 laps to go in stage 2, Martin Truex Jr. took the lead and also won the stage edging out Joey Logano. The race restarted on lap 138 with Brad Keselowski leading the race. With 50 laps to go, the 5th caution flew for a 5 car crash on the front stretch. It started when Tyler Reddick got turned by Jacques Villeneuve collecting Martin Truex Jr., Joey Logano, and Kurt Busch. The race restarted with 41 laps to go with Austin Cindric leading the field. Cindric soon began to battle for the lead with Bubba Wallace.\nFinal laps.\nWith 23 laps to go, Ricky Stenhouse Jr. took the lead from Wallace. Wallace led with 22 to go but Stenhouse took full advantage the next lap. With 10 laps to go, a 6 car crash occurred in the tri-oval. Kevin Harvick got turned by Kyle Larson in which Harvick turned left and hooked Noah Gragson sending Gragson into the outside wall. The wreck also collected Chase Elliott, Todd Gilliland, and Erik Jones. The race was red flagged for a short period of time for over 5 minutes. On the restart with 6 laps to go, Austin Cindric took the lead with help from his teammate Ryan Blaney. Out of turn 4 on the same lap, Ricky Stenhouse Jr. got turned by Brad Keselowski and collected Chris Buescher bringing out the 7th and final caution of the race. The race would set up overtime. On the restart, Cindric held onto his lead with help from Ryan Blaney. In just his 7th Cup Series start and his 2nd Daytona 500 attempt, Austin Cindric held off the pack and beat Bubba Wallace by half a car length to win his first Cup Series race of his career. Chase Briscoe, Ryan Blaney, and Aric Almirola rounded out the top 5 while Kyle Busch, Michael McDowell, David Ragan, Brad Keselowski, and Chase Elliott rounded out the top 10.\nStage Results.\nStage One\n\"Laps:\" 65\nStage Two\n\"Laps:\" 65\nFinal Stage Results.\nStage Three\n\"Laps:\" 71\nMedia.\nTelevision.\nSince 2001—with the exception of 2002, 2004 and 2006—the Daytona 500 has been carried by Fox in the United States.

MacLeod, the local representative and Colliery Superintendent of MacLeod and Co. of Dalhousie Square has been shot dead. The painful information was contained in a terse telegram from one of the company's representatives at Sitarampur received yesterday. This simply gave the bare fact that Mr. MacLeod had been shot dead by a man named Myers that morning. Mr. Norman Angus MacLeod, the brother of the deceased gentleman left for Sitarampur last night; and the funeral took place this afternoon.\nThe man Myers is a Eurasian, and was as an assistant of the Sodeeh Coal Company.

MacLeod who was a popular man and greatly respected throughout the colliery districts. Mr. D.A. MacLeod was in Calcutta as recently as October and was well-known here. He had been in India for about 18 years, the first portion of his experience being gained in Behar. It will be remembered that some three or four months ago Mr. D. A. MacLeod was attacked in a train by a railway thief. He was a man of powerful physique and captured the fellow.

        "text": "The Hofstra Pride men's basketball statistical leaders are individual statistical leaders of the Hofstra Pride men's basketball program in various categories, including points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks. Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Pride represent Hofstra University in the NCAA's Coastal Athletic Association.\nHofstra began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1936. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Hofstra's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

        "text": "The 2022 PBA Tour season, the 63rd season of play for the U.S. Professional Bowlers Association's ten-pin bowling tour, begins on January 15 with the Regional Portions of the PBA Players Championship. The season included 16 title events (14 singles, two doubles), three special non-title events, and the PBA League team event.\nOn January 5, 2022, the PBA announced that CEO Colie Edison resigned, having accepted the position of Chief Growth Officer for the WNBA. A successor to Edison has yet to be named.\nSeason overview.\nThe PBA opened the 2022 season, as it did in 2021, with the expanded PBA Players Championship. Five Regional events (East, South, Midwest, Southwest and West) were hosted first, with each Region holding a televised stepladder final round on FS1. The five Regional winners then competed in the tournament finals held in Euless, Texas on January 29.\nThe Tour's other four major championships (U.S. Open, Tournament of Champions, PBA World Championship and USBC Masters) are all contested within the first 13 events of the season. The PBA League team competition returns in July, after a one-year hiatus. All five majors and the PBA Tour Playoffs offer a $100,000 top prize, marking the first time in PBA history that six events have paid out a six-figure first place check.\nThe season currently has 36 broadcasts scheduled, including 25 on FS1, four on Fox, two on CBS Sports Network and five on the FloBowling web channel. Fox is scheduled to broadcast the stepladder finals of three major tournaments (Tournament of Champions, PBA World Championship and USBC Masters), plus the final round of the PBA Tour Playoffs.\nOn November 17, 2021, the PBA announced that Pabst Blue Ribbon will be a title sponsor as “official beer” for the 2022 PBA Tour. During the season (except for the Collegiate Invitational where regulations on alcohol advertising are in effect as many players are under 21 years of age and for amateurism regulations, as men's bowling is governed by the USBC, not the NCAA), Fox Sports broadcasts will feature a “PBR 6-Pack Alert” whenever a bowler achieves five strikes in a row. If the bowler gets the sixth consecutive strike following the alert, he will win a $1,000 bonus. If the sixth strike is not achieved, $500 is added to the jackpot for when the next 6-Pack Alert comes around, and Pabst will continue adding $500 each time the alert appears and the sixth strike is not achieved.\nStorm Bowling sponsors four events in the 2022 season that make up the Storm Cup series: David Small's Best of the Best Championship (Feb. 7–9), David Small's PBA Kokomo Championship (Feb. 14–16), Lubbock Sports Open (Mar. 18–20) and Colorado Springs Open (Mar. 22–24). Each event awards a PBA title, $20,000 top prize, and Tier 3 Tour points. The top five players in points over the four events will share in a $25,000 bonus pool, with $10,000 going to the player (Jason Belmonte) with the most points. All four events are live-streamed exclusively on the FloBowling Web channel.\nThe PBA League returns July 6–10 after a one-year hiatus, and features ten teams. In a change from previous events, each player on a team bowls a full game in the division qualifying round. Teams are seeded for the division stepladder based on total team scores, and the six highest-scoring bowlers from each division are awarded spots in the Strike Derby, which takes place in the same location. The division stepladders and Elias Cup Finals will still use the traditional Baker game format.\nSeason awards.\nEnd-of-season awards announced on November 2–4, 2022:\nTournament summary.\nThe events for the 2022 PBA tournament schedule are shown below. Major tournaments are in bold. Career PBA title numbers for winners are shown in parentheses (#). Winner's share prize money is shown in US dollars ($), except where indicated.\nTour points are awarded for most events. Besides the season-ending Harry Smith PBA Points Winner award, points are one consideration for Player of the Year voting, and also affect eligibility for the PBA Tour Playoffs, PBA Tour Finals (combined with 2021 points), and the 2023 DHC PBA Japan Invitational. Points for tournaments are awarded differently based on a \"tier\" system. The tier of each qualifying tournament is shown in the Notes column on the tournament schedule, and is explained below."

He lettered in football and basketball, and was team captain in both sports as a senior. He was named the team's Lineman of the Year and earned \"Sun Chronicle\" All-Star honors.\nCollege career.\nMurphy committed to University of Rhode Island, and as a true freshman in 2016 appeared in ten games. He made three starts at left guard and also was a special teams performer. He made his debut against Kansas on September 3. Against Elon on November 12, Murphy started and helped block Rhode Island to a season-high 226 rushing yards.\nAs a sophomore in 2017, Murphy was a starter in all 11 games, five at right tackle and six at left guard. He also played center several times due to injuries to Dwayne Scott. Murphy blocked for quarterback JaJuan Lawson, who completed .597 percent of his passes, a mark which was the fourth-best for a single year in team history. He also helped the team to 101.2 rushing yards per-game.\nIn 2018, as a junior, Murphy started every game, ten at left tackle and one at center, earning first-team all-conference honors and New England Football Writer's Association All-New England honors. He helped them average 121.6 rushing yards per game.\nIn 2019, his senior season, Murphy was named team captain and was the starting left tackle in 11 games. With his help, Rhode Island allowed only 2.17 sacks per game, despite leading the conference in pass attempts per game with 42. After blocking for 3,500 passing yards and 1,000 rushing, Murphy was named first-team All-Colonial Athletic Association and second-team All-America by Associated Press. After the season ended, he was invited to the 2020 NFLPA Collegiate Bowl.\nProfessional career.\nMurphy was one of three Rhode Island players invited to attend the 2020 NFL Combine. After going unselected in the 2020 NFL Draft, he was signed by the New York Giants as an undrafted free agent. He was waived at roster cuts and re-signed to the practice squad the next day. Murphy was signed off the practice squad to the active roster on November 13, but was inactive for each game. He was placed on injured reserve to start the season. His contract was not tendered in 2022, making him a free agent."

        "text": "The 1926–27 Clarkson Golden Knights men's ice hockey season was the 7th season of play for the program. The team was coached by Gordon Croskery in his 4th season.\nSeason.\nThe potential that Clarkson had shown in the second half of last season was fully realized this year. With all of their principle players returning and several more being welcomed in, the Golden Knights got off to a hot start against Cornell. \"String\" Macartney opened the scoring while new entry Harrison Heintzman netted the game-winner at the end of the second period. The team was short-handed when they met Hamilton a week later, missing both Dion and Heintzman, but gave the Continentals a fight. The teams battled to a 2–2 draw after 60 minutes but Tech fell in the extra session.\nThe team was back at full strength for the following match, a continuation of their brand-new rivalry with St. Lawrence, and Clarkson really let the Larries have it. The Knights beat the Saints 10–1 with captain Wayland scoring a hat-trick from the blueline. The team then headed to Brooklyn to face NYU in their opponent's first game in 14 years. The Violets' goaltender, Vye, put up a tremendous effort, limiting Clarkson to just 3 goals in the game. The NYU offense, however, could only muster 3 shots on Klube for the entire match and Tech easily shut out the Violets. On their way home, Clarkson stopped in West Point and received a hard test from Army. The Knights got out to an early lead but the Cadets tied the game at 3-all in the second. After exchanging goals in the third, Clarkson played its second overtime game of the season. Northup netted the go-ahead goal 2 minutes into the frame and then the entire team played defense for the remainder of the 10-minute session to secure their fourth win on the year.\nCoach Croskery had more than a week to work with the team before their next match and he had them in fine form when they hosted Syracuse. The Orange had won both of the previous games between the two, but Clarkson wouldn't let that trend continue; Tech swamped Syracuse in front of about 800 fans at home to the tune of 8–0. Wayland ended up with his second hat-trick on the year but Heintzman finished one goal better. Their third and final home game of the year occurred over that weekend when Vermont arrived in town. The game was slowed by poor ice conditions but Tech was still able to pump 5 goals into the cage, easily carrying the match.\nClarkson rounded out its season with two rematch games over the next couple of weeks. The first was at Syracuse, where the teams were limited to three 15-minute periods, but Tech continued their winning streak with a solid 4–1 victory. The second was against St. Lawrence and the Knights faced a far tougher task than they had the first time around. The Saints' defense had vastly improved over the course of the season and they held Clarkson off of the scoresheet for the first half of the match. Fortunately for Clarkson, their defense was just as impenetrable. The stronger legs of the Knights showed as the game went on and eventually they broke through. \"Chesty\" Northup broke the tie in the second and then added another in the third, allowing Clarkson to earn its seventh-consecutive win and third shutout on the year.\nWith much of the team returning for next season, there were now high expectations for the Knights.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

Lamar, which initially planned to make the opposite move in 2023, pushed this move forward to 2022.\nThe 2022−23 season was the last for at least 16 Division I schools in their current conferences, and the final season for a single Division II school before reclassifying to Division I.

This list will highlight those upsets of ranked teams by unranked teams as well as upsets of No. 1 teams. Rankings are from the AP poll. Bold type indicates winning teams in \"true road games\"—i.e., those played on an opponent's home court (including secondary homes). \"Italics\" type indicates winning teams in an early season tournament (or event). Early season tournaments are tournaments played in the early season. Events are the tournaments with the same teams in it every year (even rivalry games).\nIn addition to the above listed upsets in which an unranked team defeated a ranked team, there have been eight non-Division I teams to defeat a Division I team so far this season.

The team with the best regular-season record in each conference received the number one seed in each tournament, with tiebreakers used as needed in the case of ties for the top seeding. Unless otherwise noted, the winners of these tournaments received automatic invitations to the 2023 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament.\nStatistical leaders.\nSource for additional stats categories\nPostseason tournaments.\nThe NCAA tournament tipped off on March 14, 2023, with the First Four in Dayton, Ohio, and concluded on April 3 at NRG Stadium in Houston.

Eight teams were given automatic bids for winning their conference regular seasons, and 24 other teams were also invited. \nCollege Basketball Invitational.\nAfter the NCAA tournament field was announced, the College Basketball Invitational invited 16 teams to participate.\nCoaching changes.\nMany teams will change coaches during the season and after it ends.

        "text": "The 2022 European Cricket League (abbreviated as ECL22) also known as the 2022 Bet2Ball European Cricket League was the second edition of the European Cricket League that was held at the Cartama Oval in Málaga, Spain. It was postponed from 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain.\nBackground.\nThe European Cricket League was founded in 2019 by German cricketer Daniel Weston intended as a way to develop cricket in emerging nations in Europe as a cricket equivalent to football's UEFA Champions League. In 2020, it was announced the European Cricket League expanded from 8 teams to include the national club champions of 30 European countries. This came after Weston signed agreements with several European cricket boards to ensure their domestic champions would be invited.\nThe host for the 2021 and 2022 editions was announced as Spain. The Cartama Oval in Málaga was chosen as the host city ahead of La Manga, Murcia, who were due to host in 2021. It was announced the 2022 edition would run from 7 February 2022 to 25 March.\nParticipants.\nThe following teams were invited to take part as champions of their domestic leagues. The draw was made according to International Cricket Council seedings with England's ECB National Club Twenty20 champions Tunbridge Wells entering as top seeds. Jersey's Farmers expressed concern about the scheduling of the tournament due to the Jersey national cricket team's participation in the 2019–2022 ICC Cricket World Cup Challenge League and qualifiers for the 2022 ICC Men's T20 World Cup, as well as their players needing to use leave from their jobs to play. The reigning European Cricket League champions VOC Rotterdam were also invited back to participate.\nIt was announced that, due to issues with getting visas, that Petersburg Sporting would not be taking part in their group. They would be replaced by the Calpe Giants of Gibraltar. \nGroup stage.\nThe Group Stage is to be played across the first 5 weeks of the tournament, with each Group lasting a week. Each week starts with a 3-day round-robin tournament, from which the top 3 progress to a Super 3 playoff. The bottom two teams face off in an eliminator, with the winner going on to play the team who finished 4th. The winner of that game then plays the 3rd place team from the Super 3 playoff, while the Top 2 from that playoff play each other in the first Qualifier. The loser of that game and the winner of the third eliminator then play in the second qualifier. The winners of the Qualifiers then play in the group final to decide the overall Group Winner.\nChampionship Week.\nThe Champions Week features a slightly modified version of the Group Stage model. The 5 group winners play in a double round-robin format from the Monday to Thursday. The top 2 teams after this progress to the 1st Qualifier, while 3rd and 4th go to the Eliminator. The loser of the Qualifier and the Winner of the Eliminator then face off for the right to play the Qualifier winner in the Championship Final. The teams moving on to the Finals week are:\nDue to adverse weather conditions in Malaga, the first 3 days of competition were suspended. The games were shortened to 5 overs a side, with 10 games on Day 1 (Thursday), and 10 games on Day 2 (Friday), with the Saturday now acting as the Final Day of the tournament"

        "title": "Fabian Holland (rugby union)",
        "text": "Fabian Holland (born 9 October 2002) is a Dutch rugby union player, who currently plays as a lock for in New Zealand's domestic National Provincial Championship competition and for the in Super Rugby.\nEarly life.\nHe grew up in a family where rugby was not directly central. But when he was allowed to try out some sports at a young age, he ended up at the Castricumse Rugby Club at the age of five. There he found himself becoming a different boy when he entered the rugby field. \"I was more myself.\"\nThe fire in him was further fuelled when the All Black Sevens team, which represents New Zealand at the major international sevens tournaments, held a training camp at the club where he played in 2014. \"I thought it was so cool to see that the players as one whole worked hard to become the best in the world. I thought: wow, I want to be among that later.\" That is why Holland went to New Zealand in early 2019 to study and play rugby at Christchurch Boys' High School. And as it often happens: he ended up in the right place via via. Thanks to the contacts of an acquaintance from his rugby club in Castricum, who was also active in New Zealand, Holland was able to book a ticket.\nHolland was sixteen when he set foot on the other side of the world for a stay of only six months. But with his 2.04 metres, 118 kilograms and talent, he caught the eye in Christchurch. He went from the second to the first XV team and his stay was extended. After graduating from high school in Christchurch, several major clubs lined up for the rugby player, including the successful team from the city, the . Nevertheless, the Dutchman chose the Under 20 of the from Dunedin, because they had a plan there about how he could develop further as a rugby player and student. Holland: \"You don't want to know how much research they did. They even went back to matches I played when I was under eight years old.\"\nHe initially arrived in 2019 for a six-month period at Christchurch Boys' High School, where he played for the first XV. After the six-month period, he enrolled full time at Christchurch Boys'.\nRugby career.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, which largely paralyzed the sports world, did not throw a spanner in the works for Holland. The virus did less well on the island group, although the rugby player had to go into lockdown for a while. He used that period to obtain his VWO diploma. Holland has now started studying sports science at the University of Otago. Moreover, on the other side of the world, he gathered around him people who are dear to him. \"Quite special in such a short time,\" said the rugby player. He has also developed within the field. Holland played in a position in the backline in the Netherlands and ended up in a 'lock position' via the number 8 spot. He does not want to fill that position in the traditional way. \"In New Zealand they look at this position in a completely different way,\" says the relatively fast and agile rugby player.\nCalled during lecture\nTabai Matson also noticed this, the head coach of the New Zealand Under 20 team, who wanted to add Holland to his team. \"He called while I was having a lecture, so I didn't answer. When I called back, he didn't answer,\" said Holland. Eventually the message got through, after which Holland contacted his parents at two o'clock in the morning Dutch time. \"That was emotional, because of course we never expected this when I left here two years ago.\"\nThrough the Baby Blacks he hopes to follow in the footsteps of his great examples Samuel Whitelock and Brodie Retallick, the locks of the All Blacks and \"masters of their position\". However, it is not that far yet, because to be eligible for the prestigious team you have to live in New Zealand for five years from the age of eighteen. Meanwhile, the Dutch rugby team is also making progress with a talented batch. What would Holland do if national coach Zane Gardiner contacts him? \"Then I would very kindly say no. I have everything here: my girlfriend, friends and study. Moreover, it becomes difficult to arrange visas.\" Holland says it is following the actions of Orange with great interest. \"I will always proudly say that I am a Dutchman. I am happy that I grew up in the Netherlands, I would not have wanted it any other way. Holland made his debut for on 9 October 2021, in a 30–23 defeat at home to . He made his second NPC appearance on 5 November against .\nIn 2021, he signed a high performance contract with the and has played for the Highlanders development team, known as the Bravehearts.\nOn 23 June 2022, the announced that Holland had signed a three-year (fully professional) contract with the Dunedin-based franchise.\nInternational rugby career.\nHolland has played for the New Zealand national under-20 rugby union team in 2021 and the New Zealand Barbarians under-18 team in 2020. In 2020 Holland made the New Zealand Schools team."

Following the matches in the United States, the Ireland team then toured the West Indies for a three-match ODI series. \nThe United States recovered from 16/4 in the first T20I to reach 188/6. Ireland were unable to chase down the target, resulting in a 26-run win for the Americans. The visitors levelled the series with a 9-run win in the second T20I, with Lorcan Tucker scoring his second half-century of the series.\nA practice match, scheduled to be played on 20 December 2021, was cancelled due to COVID-19 issues within the squads. The first ODI was cancelled after a match official tested positive for COVID-19 and other officials were deemed close contacts. On 28 December 2021, the remaining ODI matches were each moved back by one day after a number of positive COVID-19 tests in the traveling parties, before the series was ultimately cancelled. The curtailment of the series resulted in financial losses for USA Cricket, contributing to its year-end debt load.\nSquads.\nJosh Little was initially left out of Ireland's T20I squad due to his participation in the 2021 Lanka Premier League. However, on 17 December 2021, he was recalled to the team. Ahead of Ireland's departure to the United States, Craig Young was identified as close contact of someone with a positive COVID-19 case. Therefore, per Northern Irish travel guidance, Young was unable to travel for ten days, ruling him out of the T20I matches.

Karima Gore, Jaskaran Malhotra and Aaron Jones were all ruled out of the T20I matches due to COVID-19, while Rusty Theron was ruled out due to a groin injury. They were replaced by Ritwik Behera, Yasir Mohammad, Ali Sheikh, and Ryan Scott in their T20I squad, and Kyle Phillip withdrew due to work commitments.

        "text": "The Ireland cricket team toured the West Indies in January 2022 to play three One Day International (ODI) matches and a one-off Twenty20 International (T20I) match. The ODI series formed part of the inaugural 2020–2023 ICC Cricket World Cup Super League. On 6 December 2021, the full schedule for the tour was confirmed by both cricket boards. Ireland last toured the West Indies in January 2020. Prior to the series, the Irish team were scheduled to play five white ball matches against the United States in Florida. However, the ODI matches were cancelled due to COVID-19 cases within the squads.\nThe second ODI, originally scheduled to be played on 11 January 2022, was postponed after Ireland captain Andrew Balbirnie, wicket-keeper Lorcan Tucker and interim head coach David Ripley tested positive for COVID-19. On 11 January 2022, both cricket boards agreed to reschedule the remaining fixtures, with the one-off T20I match being cancelled. With Balbirnie ruled out of the remaining matches, Paul Stirling was named as Ireland's captain for the second and third ODIs.\nAhead of the ODI series, Ireland played a 50-over tour match against Jamaica, losing the fixture by five wickets. The West Indies won the first ODI match by 24 runs, with Shamarh Brooks on debut top-scoring with 93. The second ODI was shortened due to rain, with Ireland winning the match by five wickets to level the series. Ireland won the third and final ODI by two wickets to win the series 2–1. Other than Afghanistan and Zimbabwe, it was Ireland's first ODI series win against a Test side. It was also Ireland's first ODI series win away from home against an ICC Full Member team.\nSquads.\nCricket West Indies named Keacy Carty and Sheldon Cottrell as reserves in their ODI squad, with Jayden Seales, Alzarri Joseph and Devon Thomas named as reserves in their T20I squad. Simi Singh and Ben White were both ruled out of Ireland's squad for the first ODI after providing positive COVID-19 tests. Singh and White were later ruled out of the rest of the series, after returning another positive test for COVID-19. Ireland's Paul Stirling and Shane Getkate also missed the first ODI, after they had to remain in the United States following positive COVID-19 tests, but rejoined the squad ahead of the second ODI. Andrew Balbirnie and Lorcan Tucker tested positive for COVID-19 ahead of the second ODI, resulting in the match being postponed."

        "text": "The 1928–29 Clarkson Golden Knights men's ice hockey season was the 9th season of play for the program. The team was coached by Gordon Croskery in his 6th season.\nSeason.\nClarkson entered its ninth season having already established itself as one of the top programs in the East. Despite the departure of its two defensive stalwarts, The Golden Knights were looking to try and finish the year undefeated, having missed that mark by just one game in back-to-back campaigns. From the start of the season, the team looked like they had a chance to do just that when they easily won a game over visiting Victoria College. The game saw the debut of three new players, with 'Ike' Houston leading the team in scoring. The match also saw the appearance of an 8-foot wooden fence around the Ives Park rink. The palisade was put in place so that spectators would have to pay an entry fee to watch the game.\nThe performance in the second game was just as dominating for Tech as the team brushed Vermont aside 9–0. The only thing that marred the game was a snow flurry that caused the final period to be cut down to 15 minutes. For their third game of the season, Clarkson travelled to Canton and met St. Lawrence without the services of three players. Donald, Houston and Williams were unable to participate because they were freshmen (Clarkson and St. Lawrence belonged to the same athletic conference which did not allow freshmen to play on varsity teams) and the shorthanded Knights had a fight on their hands as a result. The missing offensive punch caused Tech to be held back by the Larries' defense early, enabling the home team to score first. All-American captain Fred Dion scored twice before the end of the first but the offense continued to fall short afterwards. St. Lawrence tied the game in the second and the already-bitter rivals held one another scoreless for most of the third. Near the end of the game, Johnny Burke slipped through the defense and netted the game-winner, keeping Clarkson's record spotless.\nNext, Clarkson went south to New Jersey to take on Princeton in a rematch of last year's 8–5 classic. With the ice in rough shape, the Tigers weren't about to take Tech lightly and put forth a stout performance. Princeton held the Clarkson offense at bay and built a 3–0 lead by the early part of the second period. Tech finally got their shots to go in afterwards, cutting the lead to just 1 by the start of the third, but the Tigers closed out the game strong and won 3–5. The Knights didn't have much time to lick their wounds as they returned home and faced an equally stiff challenge from Queen's. Leading up to the game the weather seemed to be accommodating, remaining cold and dry most of the week. Unfortunately, on game day the thermostat rose and sleet showered the ice, turning the match into a slog. To top it off, near-gale-force winds swept the rink during the game and hampered both teams abilities and opportunities. While Clarkson eked out a 1–0 victory, calls for an enclosed rink were renewed as a team befitting Clarkson's talent shouldn't have to put up with such circumstances.\nFor their first game in February, Clarkson met another member of college hockey's elite in Dartmouth. The Indians were in the midst of a very strong season, holding a record of 6–2–2 and having lost only to the nation's best squad (Yale). The Knights weren't favored in the match and were only given a fighting chance in the contest. It must have come as a shock to the blue-bloods when Tech manhandled the Green throughout the game, which was place before a packed house at Ives Park. With clean ice for the first time in recent memory, Clarkson out-skated, out-shot and out-hit their opponents. More so than any game in program history, the Knights victory over Dartmouth announced that they were a force to be reckoned with.\nThe momentum was carried over into the next three games and Clarkson rolled over its collegiate competition by a combined score of 24–4. In Late February the team concluded its season against the Nichols Club of Buffalo. The game was loose defensively and Clarkson allowed 6 goals to Nichols, however, they were also able to fire six shots into the net. For the overtime, the two teams had agreed to play two 5-minute periods and Clarkson was dominant in both, scoring three times while the play became increasingly physical. While the team's historical records includes a further game, contemporary accounts have Nichols being the final match. After the year, Fred Dion, who had switched from center to defense at the start of the season, was named to the (unofficial) All-American squad for a second straight year.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

The tournament was held during March 3–8, 2022, at the Orleans Arena in Paradise, Nevada. Los Angeles–based University Credit Union was the title sponsor of the tournament for the fourth consecutive year. TritonPoint Wealth and Sterling Global Financial's SCRED fund are the presenting sponsors of the tournament. The winner of the tournament, the Gonzaga Bulldogs, received the conference's automatic bid to the 2022 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament.\nVenue.\nFor the 14th consecutive year, the 2022 WCC Tournament was held in the Orleans Arena. When Orleans Arena is set up for basketball games, the seating capacity is 7,471. The Orleans Arena is located at the 1,886-room Orleans Hotel and Casino, about 1 mile west of the Las Vegas Strip. Tickets for the WCC Tournament typically sell out quickly. In 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, no fans were permitted to attend this tournament.\nSeeds.\nAll 10 WCC schools participated in the tournament. Teams are typically seeded by conference record, with a tiebreaker system used to seed teams with identical conference records. However, due to numerous regular-season game cancellations, the WCC announced that the seeding for the 2021 edition would be determined using an adjusted conference winning percentage. With several conference games being canceled during the 2022 regular season, the conference was expected to use the adjusted conference winning percentage for seeding the 2022 tournament. Developed in partnership with Ken Pomeroy, the adjusted conference winning percentage (Pomeroy AWP) takes into account the strength of the opponent and the location where each game was played. The tournament followed a format similar to that used from 2003 to 2011. The 7 through 10 seeds played in the \"first round\", the 5 and 6 seeds started play in the \"second round\", and the 3 and 4 seeds started in the \"quarterfinals\". The top two seeds received byes into the semifinals. As expected, the WCC released the tournament seedings based on the Pomeroy AWP a few days prior to the start of the tournament."

        "text": "The Poverty Bay cricket team represents the Poverty Bay region of the North Island of New Zealand. It competes in the Hawke Cup. Its base is in Gisborne.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nCricket was established in Gisborne in the 1870s. A Poverty Bay team travelled to Taradale to play a team from Napier in March 1877. Poverty Bay and the neighbouring region Hawke's Bay thereafter played each other regularly. The Poverty Bay Cricket Association was formed in October 1896.\nThe touring Australian team played Poverty Bay in February 1914. It was the first visit of an international cricket team to Gisborne, and the Gisborne Borough Council declared a half-holiday for the first day of the match, a Friday, and gave a civic reception to the Australians on the Friday morning. The Poverty Bay captain, Len McMahon, scored 87 not out in the drawn match, and was later selected in the New Zealand team for the second match against the Australians.\nHawke Cup years.\nThe Hawke Cup began in 1910-11. Poverty Bay played their first Hawke Cup match in April 1914, when they lost to Wanganui by 201 runs. After another unsuccessful challenge in 1915, they defeated Wanganui by three wickets in March 1919. They defended the title in Gisborne four times before losing to Wairarapa by two wickets in February 1921. Poverty Bay have been a regular competitor in the Hawke Cup ever since, but have not won the title again.\nNorthern Districts, of which Poverty Bay is one of the constituent associations, began playing in the Plunket Shield in 1956-57. The first Poverty Bay players to represent Northern Districts in the Plunket Shield in 1956-57 were Bernie Graham and Ken Hough. When Northern Districts won the Plunket Shield for the first time in 1962-63, Poverty Bay's Peter Barton was a member of the team.\nPoverty Bay and the other five Northern Districts association teams compete each season in two-day matches for the Fergus Hickey Rosebowl. The winner has the right to challenge for the Hawke Cup. Poverty Bay also compete in the Brian Dunning Cup, the 50-over competition among the six teams.\nThe six clubs that compete in the senior Poverty Bay competition are Campion College, Gisborne Boys' High, Horouta, HSOB, Ngatapa and OBR. Most matches in the competition take place in Gisborne at Harry Barker Reserve, which is large enough to stage three matches at the same time."

He also represented the club for the Scottish Rugby Union.\nHe graduated with Glasgow University and at the start of the 1891 season, it was stated that he would then play for West of Scotland. This caused the \"Scottish Referee\" newspaper of 26 October 1891 to report:\nThey say that W. A. Macdonald will be seen permanently in the ranks of the West. Now that the 'varsity seems dead, his connection with that club as representative on the Union is a great hardship to other and more deserving clubs. Should Mr. Macdonald transfer his services to the West it will be competent for the Union, in accordance with Rule 7, to appoint another member. Mr. Macdonald, of course, would require to resign his seat and in justice to the other clubs we trust he will see it as his duty to do so.\nHowever for the 1891 inter-city fixture Macdonald was still noted as a Glasgow University player.\nProvincial career.\nHe turned out for West of Scotland District to play against East of Scotland District while still with 1st Lanark.\nHe was capped by Glasgow District in the inter-city match of 1885, while with 1st Lanark. By 1889, now with Glasgow University, he was captaining the side. He was still playing in the fixture in 1890 although the captainship passed to Charles Orr.\nInternational career.\nMacdonald played 3 times for Scotland.\nLaw career.\nHe was a solicitor in Insch, Aberdeenshire. He became a Justice of the Peace.\nAfter his death the goodwill of his legal business went on sale. The advert stated that it 'affords a splendid opportunity of a successful legal business being established in a wide and prosperous agricultural district of Aberdeenshire'.\nFamily.\nHis father was Donald Macdonald (1811-1898), a farmer, and his mother Margaret Ross (1821-1895). He was one of their eleven children.\nHe married Alice Sarah Boulton (1877-1960).\nDeath.\nHis cause of death was marked as arteriolosclerosis. He died on 24 January 1941 at St. Andrew's House in Insch. There was a service at St. Drostan's church and he was cremated in Aberdeen Crematorium on 27 January 1941."

He was selected in the fourth round, 124th overall, by the Canadiens in the 2020 NHL Entry Draft.\nPlaying career.\nAmateur.\nAfter two years with USA Hockey's National Team Development Program, Farrell began playing in the United States Hockey League (USHL) with the Chicago Steel. He was originally meant to begin his collegiate career with the Harvard Crimson during the 2020–21 season, but following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ivy League teams opted not to participate in the athletic season. As a result, it was decided that he would return for an additional season in the USHL. The pandemic also resulted in the 2020 NHL Entry Draft not being held in-person as originally planned, with Farrell and his father watching his draft announcement in a pub at the Steel's Fox Valley Ice Arena. He later called it \"a bright spot in a pretty weird year for everyone.\"\nDuring the 2020–21 season, Farrell recorded 29 goals and 72 assists in 53 games for the Steel, becoming the second player in USHL history to surpass 100 points in a season, after Kevin Roy in 2012. Following an outstanding season, he was awarded the USHL Player of the Year and Dave Tyler Junior Player of the Year Award.\nFarrell belatedly began his collegiate career for the Harvard Crimson during the 2021–22 season. During his sophomore year, he led the conference in goals (17), assists (19), and points (36). He finished fourth in the conference with three game-winners and third with 77 shots through 22 games. Following an outstanding season he was named to the All-ECAC Hockey First Team and the ECAC Hockey Player of the Year.\nProfessional.\nFarrell was drafted 124th overall by the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League (NHL) in the 2020 NHL Entry Draft. On March 26, 2023, Farrell signed a three-year, entry-level contract with the Canadiens. Two days later he made his NHL debut in a game against the Philadelphia Flyers. Farrell scored his first goal on his first shot in the league on March 30, in a 5–2 loss to the Florida Panthers. He played five more games that season. Farrell attended the Canadiens 2023 training camp but was assigned to Montreal's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Laval Rocket, to start the 2023–24 season.\nInternational play.\nFarrell represented the United States at the 2019 IIHF World U18 Championships, where he recorded two assists in seven games and won a bronze medal. On January 13, 2022, Farrell was named to Team USA's roster to represent the United States at the 2022 Winter Olympics. In his Olympic debut, he scored a hat-trick to help lead Team USA to an 8–0 victory over the host nation China.\nOn May 5, 2022, Farrell was named to the United States men's national ice hockey team to compete at the 2022 IIHF World Championship. He recorded two goals and four assists in ten games.\nPersonal life.\nFarrell began his studies at Harvard University online during his final season in the USHL while the collegiate athletics season had been canceled. He graduated with a degree in economics in 2023, having completed the typical four-year curriculum in three years by taking summer courses."

Their previous titles were in 1913, 1914, 1928, 1932, and 1933. This was to be their last first grade championship title. They finished with a 13 win, 1 draw, 2 loss record for 27 competition points, just one competition point ahead of Manukau. Both teams were well out in front in the title race with Richmond Rovers in 3rd, 8 points behind Manukau.\nManukau did however win the Roope Rooster knockout final when they defeated Ponsonby United 28–10 in the final. This was their second Roope Rooster win, following their 1936 win over City. Mount Albert United won the Phelan Shield for the first time when they beat Richmond 8–7 in the final. The Phelan Shield was competed for between teams who had been knocked out of the Roope Rooster in the early rounds. In the Stormont Shield, champion of champions match between North Shore (first grade winners), and Manukau (Roope Rooster winners) the Onehunga based Manukau side won easily 30–10. This was also the first time Manukau had won the Stormont Shield.\nGeorge Mitchell of the Richmond club won the J.F.W. Dickson medal for the most sportsmanlike player, while Ralph Martin, an Otahuhu 5th grade player won the same award for junior players.\nThe season was extremely disrupted by World War 2 with a huge number of senior grade players in first grade, reserve grade, and the senior B grade going away to fight. As a result, the reserve grade and senior B grade were merged and City Rovers, Newton Rangers, and Papakura unable to field any teams in the grade. Otahuhu Rovers won the senior B grade for the 4th consecutive time, although it was essentially a combined grade with the reserve competition. As a result, they gained admission to the Roope Rooster competition where they beat Papakura in the first round before losing by a point to City Rovers in round 2.\nWith the war on the representative season was once again relatively short with matches only played within a small geographical area. Auckland Māori played against South Auckland (Waikato) and an Auckland Pākehā side. Auckland played twice against South Auckland, winning both matches. Also a senior B trial match was played between senior and junior affiliated clubs on September 13 and the recently formed New Zealand Old Boys Association played a match against the South Auckland Old Boys at Western Springs in late September.\n \n \nAuckland Rugby League News.\nSeason prospects.\nThe Auckland Rugby League held a special meeting on March 13. It was indicated that the competitions would carry on as usual and be successful “in spite of many players being in the fighting forces”. The chairman, Mr. G. Grey Campbell said that “last season was easily the best experienced for many years, as the annual report would show, and already several clubs were mustering their forces in anticipation of another good year… it is pleasing to know that progress during the past three years has been marked, and every thanks is due to the excellent co-operation of the players and all officials, even down to the ball boys. The enthusiasm shown in club competition was remarkable and the public gave most generous support”. They then decided to hold their annual meeting on April 2.\nAnnual meeting.\nTheir 31st Annual Meeting was held at the League Rooms in the Grey Buildings, Courthouse Lane on Wednesday, April 2 at 7.45pm. Remarkably despite the disruption caused by the war the 1940 season had turned out to be a record year for revenue for Auckland Rugby League. Revenue from gates and the grandstand were £4370 which was the highest ever. This allowed £1885 to be transferred to the appropriation account, compared with £1537 in 1939. “Liberal expenditure was allowed for maintenance, £218 was paid to injured players, and grants amounting to £705 were made to clubs”. A benefit match for the injured players’ fund realised £169. The league also raised £398 for “patriotic purposes”, and £198 was granted to the Sports’ Queen fund. The “total assets of the league were £10,853, and a reserve had been created for expenses of a capital nature likely to occur during the coming season”. It was stated that 800 players competed in the junior grades and there were 38 teams in the schoolboy competition. The ladies committee was also referred to in the annual report. They held many functions and from these donated £161 to patriotic funds, and £64 to the injured players fund and “also assisted several patriotic organisations”. At the meeting president John A. Lee spoke, saying “in spite of the war conditions, so satisfactory a balance-sheet speaks volumes for the excellent spirit which prevailed last year… the league code has gone from success to success, and in the forces fighting in the Middle East, league players are doing well in the rugby union fifteens”. Chairman C. Grey Campbell said “in days of stress ahead the management would rally round any deserving war cause… [and] the future was very uncertain from a playing point of view, but the speaker had no hesitation in saying that the right thing was to carry on doing a part in New Zealand affairs as a sports organisation. It was far better that the public should be occupied in their thoughts away from the tragic happenings in England. The game’s players, officials and supporters were behind the government and the people of Britain in their great struggle”. The following officers were elected at the meeting:- Patron, Mr. J.B. Donald; vice patron, Mr. J.F.W. Dickson; president, Mr. John A. Lee, M.P., vice presidents, the Mayor, Sir Ernest Davis, Messrs. J. Donald, C. H. Drysdale, H. Grange, R.J. Laird, W.J. Lovett, E. Morton, F. W. Schramm, M.P., W. Wallace, H.W. Brien, L. Coakley, H. Luke, R. D. Bagnall, E. Montgomery, T.G. Symonds, G.T. Wright, R.H. Wood, H. Walmesley, Joe Sayegh, R.H. Benson, A. Moody, H. W. Gray, J. C. Gleeson, B. Brigham, N. Kyle; trustees, Messrs. G. Grey Campbell, Edward John Phelan, A. Stormont; auditor, Mr. R.A. Spinley; hon. solicitor Mr. H.M. Rogerson; hon. physicians, Drs. M.G. Pezaro, S. Morris, K.H. Holdgate, J.N. Waddell, G.W. Lock, H. Burrell, H. Smith; board of control, Messrs. G. Grey Campbell (chairman), Edward John Phelan, William Mincham, V. Rose, R. Doble, T. Davis, J.W. Probert, T. Wilson, Jim Clark, J.F. Knowling (treasurer), Ivan Culpan (secretary); finance committee, Messrs. J.W. Probert, T. Wilson, William Mincham; delegate to New Zealand Rugby League, Mr. R. Doble. At the meeting a framed photograph of the board of control was presenting by Mr. J. A. Lee to chairman Mr. C. Grey Campbell.\nCommunication with English rugby league.\nIt was decided at a meeting early in the season to send a message of support to the English rugby league which was endeavouring to carry on its operations in spite of the war. They had “expressed deep appreciation and admiration of the magnificent courage of the English people”. It was reported in the New Zealand Herald on April 12 that the English Rugby League replied: “our heartfelt thanks for your inspiring message. We are playing football: we are cheerful; we will ever be strong”.\nAmalgamation and suspension of the reserve grade.\nAt the annual meeting on April 2 the possibility of amalgamating some senior clubs was discussed with delegates being asked to keep an open mind on the idea. It was decided to suspend the senior reserve grade competition for the 1941 season. They also planned a series of preliminary games on Saturday, April 19 to see first hand the playing strength of the senior clubs, so they could then finalise the details regarding the senior grade competition. At the board of control meeting on April 23 Mr. J. Rutledge of the City Rovers club suggested that “the stronger clubs give their strength to the weaker clubs, and then you would have a better balanced competition”. The City, Newton and Papakura clubs had all been in conference with the league about their prospects for the season after having struggled somewhat in recent time. Chairman Campbell remarked that there might be some merit in the suggestion. Richmond Rovers was named by Rutledge as a club in particular that had a lot of strength.\nHuntly teams desire to join the Auckland competition.\nAt the board of control meeting on April 16 the Huntly club sent a deputation to ask about entering a team in the senior championship. Mr. W.C. Davies, the South Auckland Rugby League's chairman spoke on their behalf and said they “desired to play matches at Carlaw park and at Huntly on alternate Saturday’s and the clubs were not concerned with gate receipts” at Carlaw Park. Auckland Rugby League's deputy-chairman, Mr. E. J. Phelan said that the clubs had already discussed the issue and had raised many questions and difficulties. Mr. F. T. McAneny, chairman of the senior clubs’ officers’ association said “the general impression of his executive was that the scheme was a wartime measure, but, judging from the remarks of members of the deputation, their idea was a permanent one. Auckland clubs… had a strong objection to playing what appeared to be a fully representative South Auckland (northern Waikato) team,… and the question of transport was also a matter to consider”. Phelan said that in the absence of chairman Campbell no final decision could be made until after their meeting the following week. In mid May the South Auckland (northern Waikato) wrote to the ARL “expressing its intention of inviting Auckland senior clubs to play matches at Huntly”. The secretary, Ivan Culpan, was advised by the ARL board to advise all clubs of the offer for when they had their byes. Richmond and North Shore had already travelled to Davies Park in Huntly to play local sides.\nSenior competitions.\nAt the meeting on April 23 it was decided to make no alteration to the senior teams from the previous season and to decline the applications from Huntly and Otahuhu to enter sides. It was “resolved that senior clubs with teams in the senior B competition be allowed to draw on senior B players, provided the players concerned do not participate in three consecutive games, or five at intervals, in the second round of the competition. Richmond reported that their senior team was unable to obtain a supply of the club coloured jerseys, and permission was given to them to wear white jerseys and pants, and maroon stockings in place of their usual maroon and blue.\nProtest by Otahuhu.\nIn early May the Otahuhu club wrote a letter of protest to the Auckland Rugby League regarding their non-acceptance of their senior team. They “made suggestions that a fairer method of selection be devised in future. The letter pointed out that the Otahuhu club was in a position to field a strong team at the start of the season, but since then senior clubs in the city had made Otahuhu a recruiting ground”.\nJunior competitions.\nThere were fifty three team nominations for junior sides received by the Auckland Rugby League when nominations closed in late April. It was then decided to commence the season on May 10.\nCarlaw Park and other grounds.\nOn the afternoon of January 16 a grass fire on the railway embankment threatened the railway grandstand before it was extinguished by fire fighters from the central fire station. Only slight damage was caused to the advertising hoardings behind the stand. Carlaw Park was being used regularly for military activities after the Auckland Rugby League having granted its use to the army in 1940 with the first Battalion, Auckland Regiment parading there in January. Indeed, the ground during the summer of 1940-41 saw the ground and facilities being loaned out to “various bodies and letters of thanks were read [at a meeting on March 13] from the military authorities, the New Zealand Red Cross Society, the Patrotic Sports committee, and Home Guard units”. At the annual meeting on April 2 chairman Campbell announced that the lease for Carlaw Park had been extended by 21 years. It was also reported at the meeting that Carlaw Park would not be available for night training “owing to the blackout regulations” but “other arrangements, however, were being made”. Chairman Campbell said that training could take place “between the hours of 5 p.m. and 7.30 p.m.” and a suggestion was made that a “well-known gymnasium might be taken over for physical training”. Whilst many teams had their own grounds in the outer suburbs and could train at them, City Rovers, Ponsonby United, Marist Old Boys, and Newton Rangers all relied on Carlaw Park for the majority of their training. On April 5 they were all scheduled to train on the same day with Newton allocated the No. 1 ground from 2 pm to 3:30 pm, Ponsonby No. 1 from 3:30 to 5 pm, Marist No. 2 from 2pm to 3:30 pm, and City No. 2 from 3:30 to 5pm. As in previous times, soldiers, sailors, and airmen were admitted to the ground free of charge along with children. On match days special trams ran from Customs Street to Carlaw Park. In May the Auckland Council advised that the following grounds had been allocated for rugby league for the season: Auckland Domain (2), Outer Domain (1), Victoria Park (1), Walker Park (2), Western Springs (1), Grey Lynn (1).\nIn June the Mount Albert club requested that the league consider improving the lighting in the dressing rooms at Carlaw Park and the league agreed to the request.\nIn September Opai Asher, the custodian of Carlaw Park had his handcart stolen and smashed up. After not being able to find it in the morning he searched up into the Auckland Domain and \"spied what looked like a heap of wood. It was the remains of the handcart, upside down, absolutely dismantled, with the wheels, springs and axle missing\". The police were left to look into the matter.\nAt the June 25 ARL meeting the Newton club “drew attention to the lack of protection afforded players through goal posts on suburban grounds not being properly padded. Many injuries had been reported during the last few Saturdays as the result of crashing against the posts”. The league decided to take the issue up with the local bodies involved. It was reported that the Auckland City Council's parks and reserve committee that “provided the necessary equipment was available, the groundsmen would attend to the requirements”.\nTenders for refreshment rights and programme rights.\nOn April 5 the Auckland Rugby League put out a tender advertisement in the Auckland newspapers. It asked for tenders for “Refreshment Rights” for Carlaw Park, and “Programme Rights” for the 1941 season with it stated that the highest or any tender not necessarily accepted”.\nAuckland representative team.\nIn April Hec Brisbane notified the league that due to “private reasons” he would not be able to offer his services as a selector this year. The ARL then appointed Bill Cloke, Dougie McGregor, and Stan Prentice as selectors for the season.\nOld Boys club rooms.\nOn June 14 the Rugby League Old Boys’ Association opened its “newly established” club rooms on Great North Road in the evening with nearly 200 in attendance. The opening ceremony was performed by Mr. John A. Redwood, the president of New Zealand Rugby League. The club rooms were large and contained 2 full sized billiard tables, 2 indoor bowling greens, reading rooms, and with photographs around the walls of “historic events since the inception of league football in Auckland”. Those who spoke at the opening included ARL chairman C Grey Campbell, president John A. Lee, and Steve Watene who was chairman of the Māori Control Board. The secretary of the club was Mr. William Opie and he said that one of the objectives of the club was to give assistance to “old players of the league game who were financially embarrassed”. During the evening “use was made of the recreation facilities of the club, Clark McConachy, New Zealand billiards champion figuring in an exhibition of billiards and snooker in association with E.V. Roberts, a former New Zealand champion and Craddock Dufty, of full back fame, respectively”. Toasts were offered for “the King”, “Absent Friends”, “Parent Bodies”, and “Visitors Club Rooms Opened/League Old Boys.\nLadies Committee.\nOn July 2 the Auckland Rugby League Ladies Social Committee held a dance at the Peter Pan Cabaret. The evening featured “modern and old-time dancing” from 8 to 12pm. It “attracted a crowded attendance” with guests including Ivan Culpan, the secretary of Auckland Rugby League and chairman Campbell. The proceeds from the dance were to be “divided between the injured players’ fund and the sick benefit of the ladies’ committee. The committee was:- Mrs. I Stonex, Mrs. C. Howe, Mrs. Chernside, Mrs. R. Doble and Mrs. A Scott (secretary). On August 20 the board thanked the ladies committee for a donation of £25 for the injured players fund.\nPlayers in military service and military related news.\nIt was reported on June 21 that three former senior players were reported safe and back in the Middle East after “participating in the Greece and Crete campaigns. They were Laurie Mills, Trevor Bramley, and J. Vernall who had all played for the Richmond senior side, with Mills and Bramley meeting up on the same transport in a “hurried evacuation”. Bramley had played in several army games in Cairo and had won the General Freyberg Medal for being part of a New Zealand unit which won a seven-a-side rugby tournament. Mills was later killed in battle. Jack Campbell who had played for Ponsonby senior side in 1938 before transferring to Christchurch was reported missing after serving in Greece and being evacuated to Crete. Around the same time Ivor Stirling was also reported missing in the Middle East. Both players were part of the same unit. Stirling had played for the North Shore Albions in 1937 and 38. He ultimately survived the war and his son Ken Stirling also represented New Zealand at rugby league while his daughter Glenda Stirling represented New Zealand at the 1968 Summer Olympics and 1970 British Commonwealth Games.\nPrior to round 9 on July 5 both Verdun Scott of North Shore and Arthur McInnarney of Mount Albert departed to join up to camps at Trentham and Papakura respectively. It was reported on July 7 that Private H. A. Meyer of the Point Chevalier club was a prisoner of war. On July 12 it was reported that Lance-corporal H. R. McKinnon was missing. He had played “for the Richmond club for over ten years, from schooldays to his enlistment, when he was playing senior grade”. On July 26 it was reported that Martin Hansen, the captain of the Mount Albert team had returned from the war. He fought in Egypt and was evacuated from Greece. While overseas he saw other Auckland league players W. Walker (Mount Albert), Trevor Bramley and Laurie Mills (Richmond), Noel Martin and Dan Klane (Ponsonby). The latter two were now prisoners of war. Hansen had been wounded and spent time in a Scottish hospital before moving to another hospital and then returning to New Zealand.\nWith several players in the army in the Wellington area it was asked who the players would return to if they played league for various Wellington clubs while on service. “it was eventually decided, subject to approval of the New Zealand Rugby League, that any players on active service are free to play for any club without registration, but upon return to Auckland on military leave the player must revert back to his former club”.\nIn August the league donated £75 to the Fighters’ Mother Fund and the Auckland Trotting Club wrote a letter expressing their appreciation for the donation on behalf of the Allied Sports Gymkhana.\nRepresentative fixtures.\nAuckland decided to play South Auckland on July 12 after a request from their southern neighbours. Mr. W. C. Davies, secretary of the South Auckland League also requested a higher percentage of the gate receipts as the gate percentages offered to his team had been gradually reduced over time. They felt that 40% was a reasonable request after amusement taxes were deducted especially after their “fine showing” in their last two matches. After a discussion in committee, chairman Campbell told the deputation that the request would be granted. Mr. T. Shaw of Huntly said that their fans in the Lower Waikato were looking forward to seeing an Auckland team in action.\nObituaries.\nWalter Roland Clarke.\nIt was reported in May that former Papakura senior player, Gunner Walter Roland Clarke was killed in action on April 15 as part of an anti-tank unit. Clarke was the first Papakura player killed in action in the war. He had been educated at Papakura District School and as well as playing for the Papakura senior side in the forwards and was also a “keen supporter of the Papakura Greyhound Racing Club”. Before enlisting in the military he had been working as a grocer's assistant driving the mail and grocers van. Clarke enlisted in 1940 with the second Echelon and spent 7 months in England before moving to Egypt. He was aged just 24 at the time of his death.\nJohn David Campbell Long.\nJohn David Campbell Long was killed on May 11, 1941, after having initially been reported missing in action. He was a player in the Avondale 3rd grade side. Long had joined the Royal New Zealand Air Force and trained at the Levin and Ohakea stations before leaving for the war on April 26, 1940. His last rank was Sergeant (Rear Gunner). He had been educated at Owairaka Primary School and Mount Albert Grammar School before becoming employed at the Otahuhu Railway Workshops. He was just 21 years of age when he was killed. His name is on the Otahuhu Railway Workshops War Memorial on the corner of Piki Thompson Way in Ōtāhuhu, Auckland.\nGeorge Gardiner.\nOn May 17 George Gardiner was killed in action in Tobruk. Gardiner had played rugby league for New Zealand on 21 occasions and represented Marist Old Boys in 1924, and Ponsonby United from 1925 to 1932. He also played 4 matches for Auckland in 1924–25, and one for Auckland Province in 1925. After his rugby league career finished he moved to Australia and enlisted in the army there aged over 40 using a fake age as he was 'too old' to enlist, after having earlier fought in World War 1 also using a fake age as he had been too young at that time. He was part of the Australian 2/23rd Battalion and left for the Middle East in November 1940. In early 1941 a German advance in Libya pushed British and Commonwealth forces back towards the Egyptian border. In “the early hours of 17 May the 2/23rd Battalion participated in an unsuccessful attempt to recapture the lost ground”. They made some gains but most of the Australian attacking forces were forced back and they suffered heavy casualties. After the operation there were 95 Australians reported missing including Gardiner amongst six other officers. There were conflicting reports of what had happened to him including him being taken to a hospital in Egypt, or that he had been captured. It was later determined after an inquiry that he had been shot “through the abdomen and died of his wounds the day after the battle”. His death occurred in fighting at Cyrenaica near Tobruk with the cause of death recorded as peritonitis. George Gardiner was buried in the Knightsbridge War Cemetery in Acroma, west of Tobruk in Libya.\nOn May 13, 1942, the Bay of Plenty Times published an obituary for George Gardiner. On 10 April 2016 the Australian War Memorial held a ceremony to commemorate Lieutenant George Gardiner's life and service. Gardiner was survived by his wife Mary Gardiner and a son, Parata Ngatai Gardiner.\nWalter Gamble Mulholland.\nOn August 2, Walter Gamble Mulholland passed away aged 58. He was a former secretary of Newton Rangers and secretary of the Auckland Rugby League Referees’ Association in 1909–10.\nBernard George Evans.\nIt was reported in mid August that North Shore senior player Bernard George Evans had been killed “in the course of air operations”. He had been born at Takapuna and educated at Takapuna Grammar School before playing rugby union for Takapuna Rugby Club. He moved to Sydney and joined the rugby league code and then returned to New Zealand. He then joined the North Shore Albions. He was also a cyclist competing in Takapuna events and a member of the Takapuna junior surf club. He had volunteered into the Air Force early in 1940 and after spending six months preliminary training at Levin and Ohakea he left for Scotland to complete his training as an air gunner. Details of his death later revealed that the aircraft he was on was attacked on its way back to base on the night of August 13–14. Wing Commander and New Zealander, Trevor Owen Freeman wrote he “immediately returned the fire and succeeded in beating off the first three attacks, but on the fourth attack an unlucky bullet from the enemy fatally injured him. Although your son was a comparatively new member of the squadron he was already very popular, and we will miss him greatly. He died gloriously in the service of the empire, maintaining to the end the highest traditions of the Royal Air Force”.\nRobert Arthur Spinley.\nOn August 29 Mr. Robert Arthur Spinley died suddenly at the age of 53. He was the secretary of Auckland Rugby League from 1914 to 1917, and auditor from 1920 to 1941 and was closely involved with the formation of Carlaw Park.

He went on to be a member of the first executive of the Auckland Rugby League from 1915 to 1923 and a vice-president for many years. He played for Auckland in 1910 in a match against Nelson and for Auckland again in 1913 in an exhibition match at Pukekohe against the champion North Shore Albions side.\nSenior first grade competitions.\nPreliminary rounds.\nPreliminary round 1.\n Alan Sayers, the former New Zealand 440 yard champion in 1937, and 1938 British Empire Games representative was on debut for Richmond Rovers. He had previously been playing rugby for Waikato, though he was originally from Auckland where he had been educated at Royal Oak Primary School and Auckland Grammar School. He had scored a record 53 tries for Hamilton Old Boys in the Stag Trophy but had broken his collarbone in a match in 1939 and not played again until this season with Richmond Rovers.

Joe Gunning was called up for military service at home but he expected to be available for club matches.\nFox Memorial results.\nRound 1.\nIn City Rovers match with Newton Rangers they passed 5,000 points scored in the first grade competition and were the first team to do so.\nRound 2.\nNo games were going to be played at Carlaw Park on May 10 due to a military parade being held there on Saturday. However, after receiving more information from the military authorities it was found that the parade would be finished in time for one match to be played at 3pm. Therefore, the Richmond v Marist match went ahead at the later start time of 3:30pm. Unofficial shorter matches were also played between Newton and City at 2pm, and Ponsonby and North Shore at 2:45. Newton won their match 19 to 15, while the Ponsonby-North Shore score was not reported if it indeed took place at all. In the City match Lindsay Simons played for City after returning from Wellington where he had spent some seasons. He had previously been a North Shore player. Schultz, who had also played in Auckland for Mount Albert before moving to England to play for York had now returned and played for Newton. He broke his collarbone and was out for the season. Manukau played Papakura in a friendly at Prince Edward Park in Papakura and won 35 to 20. Jack Hemi played his first game of the season for Manukau.\nRound 3.\nAbbie Graham in the Richmond side played his last game before going into camp. Newton, who had the bye were supposed to play Huntly during the weekend but the match fell through.\nRound 4.\nFuture All Black Johnny Simpson scored his debut try for Marist seniors in their 23-23 draw with Newton.\nRound 5.\nDespite heavy rain during the week the Carlaw Park fields were still in good conditions. Alan Sayers scored a remarkable 7 tries for Richmond in their match against Papakura which was a senior club record. Joe Cootes played for Manukau after moving up from Wellington but was said to be returning to Wellington that week.\nRound 6.\n At this point of the season it was proposed to relegate senior B teams to the reserve grade and attach them to affiliated senior clubs. However the Junior Control Board strongly objected. It was decided to try and play senior B games earlier so that players could then play for senior sides in the 3pm matches if they were short.\nRound 7.\nIn the match between North Shore and Papakura played at the Ellerslie Domain, Clarrie Peterson of North Shore scored 5 tries while playing in the forwards. It was suggested in the New Zealand Herald match report that this may have been a record for a forward in senior matches. It was mentioned in the same newspaper that Joe Murray, who had joined Manukau at the start of the season had been a Hawke's Bay rugby player prior to coming to Auckland. In the Manukau v Newton match, Barnard was on debut for Newton. He had previously been a South Island representative. Alan Watkins was also now playing with Newton after previously having played for Richmond and Mount Albert. During Ponsonby's 8–8 draw with City they brought up their 5,000 point in the senior grade competition becoming the second team to do this after City had done it earlier in the season.\nRound 8.\nJames Brassey was on debut for City and scored a try. He had played in the preliminary games at the start of the season. He was a very good athlete, particularly running. He had also been part of the Auckland Grammar 1st XV before leaving school 2 years prior.\nRound 9.\nJoe Cootes had returned again from Wellington and was back playing for Manukau. W Shilton was forced to play halfback for Manukau with the unavailability of Osborne. Verdun Scott was unavailable for North Shore as he had gone into camp at Trentham. Arthur McInnarney was also away at camp as well and unable to play. Des McLeod was sent off for Marist in their match with Papakura. He failed to attend the disciplinary meeting mid week and was stood down until he attended to explain the referees charge. Taripo was on debut for Marist in the same match and it was said that he was “a recent arrival from the islands”. Up to this point few players from the Pacific Islands had played in Auckland though Dave Solomon who had been at Richmond for 2 seasons had been born in Fiji, while his team mate George Mitchell had also been born in the Pacific. George's brother Alf Mitchell had also played for Richmond from 1933 to 1936 and had been born in Tonga to an English father and Samoan mother.\nRound 11.\nG Kelly was refereeing his 50th match involving first grade sides in the clash between Richmond and Marist. He had begun his first grade coaching career in 1937.\nRound 12.\nJack Hemi scored 24 points for Manukau which included nine successful kicks at goal (7 conversions and 2 penalties). Jack Smith had been in camp at Trentham and played rugby for the Army team the weekend prior. He returned to North Shore and kicked a penalty in their 8–8 draw with Ponsonby. While playing for Marist, William John Bates was concussed and taken to Auckland Hospital.\nRound 13.\nJack Hemi scored his 100th point in senior games for the season in their win over City. There was controversy during the week with O Chalmers appointed the referee for the Manukau v City match but Manukau officials requested a different referee and J. O’Shannessey refereed instead. Discussion over the matter was taken in committee at the control board meeting the following week and Manukau were summoned to appear. They then expressed regret over their actions and it was decided to take no further action. Former New Zealand representative Dick Smith came out of retirement to fill the fullback position which was usually occupied by his brother Jack Smith. Jack was away for military training.\nRound 14.\n Papakura recorded their first and last win of the season when they defeated City 5–2. A novel event happened during the weekend when Manukau, who were on their bye, played at Te Kohanga in a game of rugby union. They played under the name of 'Tamaki Rugby' team. The match was to assist (Princess) Te Puea Hērangi in raising funds for the New Zealand Māori Red Cross Society with a dance being held in the Te Kohanga Hall in the evening with music supplied by the T.P.M. orchestra from Ngaruawahia. ‘Manukau’ won by 37 points to 6 and the day also raised £56. Former Manukau player and New Zealand representative Jack Brodrick made his first appearance for the season.\nRound 16.\nVerdun Scott of North Shore had gone back to camp and J Greenwood replaced him at centre. City Rovers signed Takapuna rugby wing three quarter H. Rogan. L. Naughton, a North Shore rugby played joined North Shore Albions and played centre.\nRound 17.\nThe Auckland representative team was playing South Auckland in Huntly at the same time as the Carlaw Park matches were on. It had been arranged that 3 teams would have a bye to allow for enough talent to be in the Auckland team. They were Mount Albert, Richmond, and Marist. There was supposed to be a match between City and Ponsonby played at Carlaw Park 2, however it appears that these teams decided not to play the match as they were both out of championship contention. During the week the Auckland Star published a piece on Claude List who was remarkably now in his 29th season of rugby league. He had debuted at the senior level for the Kingsland Rovers in 1921. He remained with them for many years and was selected to play for Auckland and New Zealand despite the fact that they were a senior B side. He was the first player ever to do this. After Kingsland amalgamated with Grafton and then essentially folded he joined Marist, and then Mount Albert who he was currently playing with.\nRound 18.\nAfter round 18 had been completed North Shore Albions had secured the title ahead of Manukau after their 19–9 win over Newton.

        "text": "The 1920–21 Clarkson Golden Knights men's ice hockey season was the inaugural season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nWith colleges in the United States now back in full swing after the end of World War I, the Thomas S. Clarkson Memorial College of Technology, or Clarkson for short, joined a growing list of schools who added ice hockey as a varsity sport. Students at Clarkson had organized a team before the war but it was not officially recognized by the school. Their continued efforts, however, led the college to sign off on the 'minor' program for the 20–21 scholastic year. Gordon Croskery is listed by Clarkson as being the team's head coach this season, however, according to their records, Croskery was still attending MIT and wouldn't graduate until the spring of 1922. For their ice rink, the team was forced to wait for the weather to grow cold enough to freeze the water in and around Ives Park, a wooded area on the shore of Norwood Lake. This would serve as the team's home for the first 18 years of its existence.\nOn the ice, sophomore Bill Johnson was the team's captain and, by all accounts, its best player. In the program's first game, they played an amateur club from Alexandria Bay. Johnson scored all 6 of the Knights' goals in their 6–4 win. Four days later the team was in Clinton for its first intercollegiate match, facing off against Hamilton College. Their second game didn't go nearly as smoothly and Clarkson lost 1–6. Their final game of the season served as not only the team's first ever home game but also as a rematch with Alexandria Bay. The two produced a near replica of the first match with Clarkson winning 5–4.\nWhile its first season lasted just over a week, the team could take pride in being able to produce a winning record, albeit against relatively weak competition.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

On the negative side, the Golden Knights would end up finishing with a losing record. The positives, however, would end up being much more important. While the team was unable to expand on their three game schedule, the number of players doubled. If nothing else, this indicated that the team had a better chance to survive after the initial lineup graduated. A further indication that the team was becoming popular was its inclusion on the school's newspaper. While only a monthly circular at the time, the Clarkson Integrator published the results of the games for the first time in 1922.\nThe first game for the team was the third meeting with Alexandria Bay. As the previous two had been, it was a close, high-scoring game. However, Clarkson ended up on the losing side for the first time. Despite roaring out to a 5–0 lead in the first, the Golden Knights didn't have the defensive acumen to hold the lead and fell 7–8. captain Bill Johnson was the star of the game with 5 goals to his credit. The Knights had to wait nearly a month for their next game and the time off did not serve the team well. Clarkson was whipped by Hamilton 2–12. The second game was marked by a change in style by the team's defenders shifting from point positions (one in front of the other) to the newer side-by-side arrangement.\nClarkson lists a third game being played that season, a win over an amateur club from Massena. However, according to contemporary reports, three other games, including the one against Massena, were apparently cancelled due to a lack of available ice.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

The Chinese badminton team was the member of WBF due to dispute, she therefore wasn't able to participate in many of the big tournaments which were handled and sanctioned only by the IBF, but still excelled in various continental championships which included Asian Games, Asian Championships and Asian Invitational Championships. She was the gold medalist in the World Championship which rival organisation WBF conducted in 1979.\nCareer &amp; Early life.\nIn 1970, when Liu Xia was a 15 years of age, she was studying at Chengdu No. 2 Middle School in Shanghai. Being a 15-year-old, it was the first time she was exposed to badminton and thereafter joined the Shanghai team. Just after an year, she got selected to the national badminton training team. Because of her extreme talent in the sport, which included broader skills, coordination of movements, flexible pace, etc. she immediately became the main force of the Chinese women's team. In 1975, Liu travelled to Japan with the Chinese youth team and became the press attention after defeating strongest of Japanese players at that time. After winning several Asian championships, Liu ushered in the pinnacle of her career: in the first World Games badminton competition held in the United States in July 1981, she teamed up with Zhang Ailing to win the women's doubles championship. Due to the organisational divide, the Chinese badminton team failed to participate in the World Championships, Olympic Games and other competitions, and she did not have a bigger stage to show her skills, but proved herself of being an elite player of that generation. \nAfter retirement, Liu Xia returned to her hometown Shanghai and then went to Thailand as a coach in 1990. She also has her own business in Shanghai. On the one hand, she is in charge of the development department of the East Asian Sports and Cultural Center, and also opened an indoor badminton hall next to the Shanghai Stadium, which holds the \"Liu Xia Cup\" amateur badminton competition on annual basis.

The team was coached by Ray Marchand in his 5th season.\nSeason.\nWith all three defensive starters having graduated, coach Marchand moved McNamara back to the blueline to help out. He replaced on the forward line by Lindquist but that was the least of Army's worries. Once again, the team's chances were harmed by poor weather. While Stuart Rink was formed, the skating surface was just 10 feet wide at times and could barely be used for practice, let alone a game. Army had to travel south to use the rink at Bear Mountain for the opening match against Clarkson. In spite of the difficulties, the Cadets performed well and kept the game close, losing 0–1 with a strong game from Browning, who stopped 21 shots. When the weather didn't improve, there was little hope of getting their normal rink in any kind of usable condition. As a result, the team decided to use Bear Mountain as their home venue for the year.\nAfter a second shutout loss to Bates, Army got their first win in almost two years when they defeated Massachusetts Agricultural College. Even at their new digs, however, Army couldn't escape poor ice conditions and most of their games devolved into a slog. A lack of practice time finally caught up to the team at the end of the month when Boston University visited. Being unable to get much cohesion going between the players, Army was dominated 0–9.\nIt was almost two weeks before the Cadets played their next game but the time off didn't appear to help. Despite Dartmouth having a bit of a down year, they were nonetheless able to overwhelm Army 1–12 and began a stretch of subpar play for the Cadets. Army played four games over a two-week span and lost them all. While the scores were close in the first two matches, Royal Military College was again too powerful for the Cadets, who finished their season with a poor effort against Williams. Army was only able to muster 8 shots on net, 1 more than the Ephs' total number of goals.\nWith a second consecutive season apparently ruined by poor weather, an increasing level of pressure was being put on the administration for the team to have better facilities.\nJohn Oakes served as the team's manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

The 42nd edition of the tournament began on December 1, 2022, in various college campuses across the country, location determinations were chosen based on participating teams seedings. The tournament concluded with the championship game at CHI Health Center in Omaha on December 17, when Texas defeated Louisville 3–0. The win gave Texas its 4th national title and first since 2012.\nThe 2022 NCAA tournament was the first time that 32 teams were seeded (previously, only 16 national seeds were awarded). For the first time since 2013, Texas earned the number 1 overall seed. Louisville, defending 2021 NCAA champion Wisconsin, and Stanford, rounded out the overall number 2–4 national seeds. Penn State, the no. 4 regional seed in the Wisconsin bracket, earned its 42nd straight bid to the NCAA tournament, remaining the only Division I team to participate in every NCAA tournament since its inception in 1981.\nAmong the Power Five conferences, the SEC led all conferences with seven bids, followed by the Big Ten and Pac-12 with six each, and the ACC and Big 12 with five each.\nThroughout the first two rounds of play, only one top four regional seeded team failed to advance to the Sweet 16 (No. 4 Creighton in the Stanford regional). The Big Ten conference recorded the best win/loss record in the first two rounds, going 11–1 in matches played and advancing 5 of 6 teams to the Sweet 16. Additionally, only three non-Power five conference teams advanced past the second round (San Diego, Marquette, and Houston). The wins gave Houston the program's first NCAA tournament match win since the 1994 tournament.\nTexas, Louisville, Pittsburgh, and San Diego advanced to the final four. Pittsburgh's upset win over Wisconsin and Texas's defeat of Ohio State snapped a 14-year streak of at least one Big Ten conference team in the final four. Stanford and Oregon's losses also shut out the Pac-12 from advancing, marking the first time in the 42-year history of the NCAA tournament that no final four teams came from the Big Ten or Pac 12 conference. San Diego advanced to its first final four in school history after upsetting Stanford 3–2. Louisville and Pittsburgh advanced to its second straight final four, setting up a rematch between the ACC foes; they split their regular season matches, handing each other its only conference loss of the season as they ultimately won a share of the conference title.\nTournament Schedule and Venues.\nFirst and Second Rounds (Subregionals)\nRegional Semifinals and Finals\nNational Semifinals and Championship\nBracket.\nAustin, TX Regional.\nRegion all-tournament team.\nThe following players were named to the Texas regional all-tournament team:\nPalo Alto, CA Regional.\nRegion all-tournament team.\nThe following players were named to the Stanford regional all-tournament team:\nMadison, WI Regional.\nRegion all-tournament team.\nThe following players were named to the Wisconsin regional all-tournament team:\nLouisville, KY Regional.\nRegion all-tournament team.\nThe following players were named to the Louisville regional all-tournament team:\nFinal Four.\nNational Semifinals.\nGame Recap.\nTexas defeated San Diego in the first semifinal match.

Oklahoma State did not participate due to its postseason ban. The only other time this happened was in 2004, when Baylor missed the tournament.\nThe top seven teams earned a first-round bye. Teams were seeded by record within the conference, with a tiebreaker system to seed teams with identical conference records. The first tiebreaker, as is standard in most sports, is head-to-head results between the tied teams. The second tiebreaker is taking the head-to-head results against each team in the conference beginning with the first-place team and working down until there is no longer a tie."

        "text": "The 1923–24 Army Cadets men's ice hockey season was the 21st season of play for the program. The team was coached by Ray Marchand in his 1st season.\nSeason.\nArmy's hockey team began a tremendous change when Talbot Hunter was replaced by Ray Marchand as head coach. Their new bench boss overhauled the entire style of play for the Cadets and, while the new scheme would eventually pay dividends, the team was a little slow on the uptake. Part of the problem early in the year was the lack of ice resulting from a late winter. Army had just two partial practice sessions before their first game on January 5 and the resulting 3–7 loss was hardly surprising. Army fared much better in their second match, holding a 1–1 tie with Pennsylvania until the last minute of play. After the match with Penn, Stuart Rink was turned into little more than a puddle for a 10-day period and the Cadets were again unable to improve their play. The lack of ice time caused Army to drop their third game of the season to Bates which did not bode well for the remainder of the year.\nAfter games against Amherst and Princeton were cancelled due to a lack of ice, February brought colder temperatures to West Point and Army was able to welcome MIT to Stuart Rink. Army played far better than they had in any of their previous games and dominated the Engineers despite the close score. A week later, a hat-trick by Walter Marinelli gave the Cadets a 3–2 win. Army ran its winning streak to 3 with a strong performance against Union but were then thoroughly beaten by their rivals to the north, the Royal Military College Paladins.\nEntering their final weekend of the season, Army had a chance to earn a winning record. That possibility was ended, however, when Williams lost their goaltender Lowes before the match. Army's reserve netminder Lewis was put into the Ephs' cage and the two teams agreed to count the match as an exhibition. Army still had a chance to reach .500 but they would have to get through one of the nation's top teams in Boston College. Another hat-trick from Marinelli gave the Cadets a miraculous lead, which they carried late into the game, but BC managed to tie the score with just a few minutes to play. In the overtime session, the Bostonians overwhelmed Army and scored three times to capture the match and end the Cadets' season on a loss.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "Tom Stewart (born 11 January 2001) is a professional rugby union player who plays as a hooker for United Rugby Championship club Ulster and for the Ireland national rugby union team.\nYouth.\nBorn in Belfast, Northern Ireland, Stewart attended Belfast Royal Academy and was named Ulster Schools Player of the Year in 2019, and captained Ulster at under 18 level. He joined the Ulster Rugby academy in June 2019. He was named in the Ireland squad for the 2020 Six Nations Under 20s Championship, starting in the wins against Scotland and Wales before the tournament was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In January 2021 he signed a one-year development contract with Ulster, intended to be upgraded to a senior professional contract for the 2022–23 season. \nCareer.\nStewart was named in the Ulster Rugby senior squad for the 2021–22 season, and made his senior debut off the bench in an away defeat to Ospreys on 4 December 2021. He scored his first try in a 48-12 home victory against Cardiff on 4 March 2022. He was selected for the Emerging Ireland squad for the Toyota Challenge in South Africa in September 2022.\nAfter scoring 7 tries in 11 appearances for Ulster in the 2022–23 season, he was called up to the Ireland squad for the 2023 Six Nations Championship, as cover for the injured Rónan Kelleher. That year Stewart would go on to break the United Rugby Championship single season try-scoring record, with his second hat trick of the year in a victory over Dragons, bringing his season tally to 16 tries. This beat the 14 scored by Edinburgh's Tim Visser in 2010-11 and the Cheetahs' Rabz Maxwane in 2018-19, and earned him the URC's Top Try Scorer award. He also won the URC's Next-Gen Player of the Season award for players under 23 who have fewer than five international caps. He was called up to Ireland's preliminary 42-man squad ahead of the 2023 Rugby World Cup, made his international debut off the bench in the warm-up game against Italy on 5 August 2023, and his first international start on 26 August against Samoa."

He played college baseball at Central Missouri from 1998 to 2000, before playing professionally from 2000–2003. He then served as the head coach of the Northwestern Wildcats (2022).\nPlaying career.\nReynolds attended and played college baseball at the University of Central Missouri. As a freshman, Reynolds was a second team All-Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association (MIAA) selection and was named the Conference's Freshman of the Year. As a sophomore in 1999, he led the Mules in wins (11), strikeouts (67) and innings pitched (87.0), on his way to being named First Team All-MIAA. Reynolds turned in his best season of his college career in 2000, registering 12 wins in 97.0 innings. His efforts during the 2000 season earned him the MIAA MVP.\nReynolds was selected in the 3rd round of the 2000 Major League Baseball draft by the New York Mets.

Saint Peter's received a No. 15 seed in the NCAA tournament East Region, and faced No. 2 seed Kentucky in the first round. They became the tenth No. 15 seed on record to upset a No. 2 seed in the NCAA tournament with a shocking 85–79 victory in overtime. Advancing to the second round, they took on No. 7 seed Murray State, winning that game 70–60, and became the third No. 15 seed to advance to the Sweet 16. At the same time, they became the first MAAC men's basketball program to ever advance to the Sweet 16 as well.

        "title": "Virtual Bowling",
        "text": " is a 1995 sports video game developed and published by Athena in Japan for the Virtual Boy. In the game, the player participates in a series of bowling tournaments consisting of four 10-frame matches at various alleys against computer-controlled opponents, in order to obtain a high score and progress further. Its gameplay, featuring three modes of play, is viewed from a first-person perspective.\n\"Virtual Bowling\" was created by Athena, a developer known for their bowling games, with producer Sakae Nakamura heading its development. The game was reportedly rushed to market amid Nintendo planning to cease support for the Virtual Boy, becoming one of the platform's last official Japanese titles alongside Bandai's \"SD Gundam Dimension War\", and was produced under a very limited run. It is considered by gaming journalists as one of the rarest, most valuable and sought-after Virtual Boy titles.\n\"Virtual Bowling\" garnered mixed reception from gaming publications since its release; criticism was geared toward the odd physics, lack of multiplayer and unbalanced scoring mechanics, but its sense of realism, playability and use of the Virtual Boy's hardware were commended. Retrospective commentary has been more positive, with some considering it one of the best games for the platform, being praised for its 3D visuals, controls, fast-paced tournament mode and use of the system's hardware.\nGameplay.\n\"Virtual Bowling\" is an arcade-style sports game similar to \"World Bowling\" on Game Boy and \"Nester's Funky Bowling\", where the player participates in one of three modes of play available: Standard, Training and Tournament. Standard is a quick match mode, where the player attempts to knock 10 pins under 10 frames. Training, as the name implies, is a practice mode where the player can place pins at any position before making a shot. In the Tournament mode, the player participates in a series of four matches consisting of 10 frames at various alleys against computer-controlled opponents, in order to obtain a high score and progress further. Prior to starting, the player can input their name and adjust various settings such as the ball's weight, amount of wax to apply at the lane's surface or a dominant arm.\nGameplay is viewed from a first-person perspective; the player adjusts their position and aim using the left and right d-pads. Afterwards, the player is presented with spin and power gauges, which determines how the ball will go and how hard the ball is thrown. The power gauge is split into two phases, with the first part determining the ball's power, and the player must match a circle spot during the second part to pull off a shot. However, the ball can veer off the lane if the player fails to match the spot during this second phase. Once the ball is released, the camera follows it through the lane before knocking the pins.\nDevelopment and release.\n\"Virtual Bowling\" was developed by Athena, a game developer known for their experience with bowling titles such as \"World Bowling\" (1990) for Game Boy. Development was headed by producer Sakae Nakamura, while the music was co-composed by Ryoue Takagi and a member only known by the pseudonym of \"Nicochimans\". The game was first previewed on June 1995, prior to the launch of the platform, in a Virtual Boy-dedicated supplement of \"Family Computer Magazine\" and later in July on the Japanese magazine \"The Super Famicom\" respectively. Like all other Virtual Boy games, the title sports a red-and-black color scheme and uses stereoscopic 3D visuals to create the illusion of depth. It was first showcased to the video game press and attendees at the 1995 Consumer Soft Group (CSG) trade show and later at Shoshinkai 1995. \nFollowing a final call issued by Nintendo regarding Virtual Boy releases before ceasing support for the system, Athena, alongside Bandai, J-Wing and Taito, reportedly rushed their titles to market in order to recoup investment. \"Virtual Bowling\" was originally slated for a December 8 launch by Athena, but was published on December 22 instead and was housed in an eight megabit cartridge. It served as one of the last official Japanese Virtual Boy games published alongside \"SD Gundam Dimension War\", also released on the same day. It is considered by gaming journalists as one of the rarest, most valuable and sought-after Virtual Boy titles; It became a rare collector's item that commands high prices on the secondary game collecting market, due to being produced under a very limited run of copies. Though it was never released in North America, all the in-game text is displayed in English. Some hobbyists load the ROM image onto actual Virtual Boy cartridges and sell reproduction copies online.\nReception.\n\"Virtual Bowling\" received mixed reception from gaming publications since its release. \"Famitsu\"s four reviewers criticized the game for its \"odd\" physics, lack of multiplayer and unbalanced scoring mechanics. However, they commended its sense of realism, playability and use of the Virtual Boy's qualities. The Japanese book \"Virtual Boy Memorial Commemorative Guidebook\" gave the title an average rating, stating that \"It's pretty good, as long as you don't think about why you should take the trouble to bowl with this hardware.\" In contrast to the other publicacions, a writer for British magazine \"Retrogames\" was more positive towards the game, giving positive remarks to the visuals for making good use of the Virtual Boy's hardware, and the skittle sprites for their animations and realistic physics, while finding the sound to be \"chirpy\". The writer stated that the game was \"a refreshing return to a simple yet addictive gaming format\" and regarded it as one of the best Virtual Boy titles.\nRetrospective commentary for \"Virtual Bowling\" has been more positive, with some considering it one of the best games for the platform. \"Nintendo Life\"s Dave Frear found the game to be a \"very impressive bowling sim\", praising the 3D visuals, atmospheric sound, responsive controls, tournament mode and catchy music but also criticized this latter aspect for being repetitive, as well as the default power metter setting for enabling easy strikes and lack of a saving system to keep high scores. \"Retro Gamer\" also commended its number of customizable options, detailed graphics and simple bowling system, regarding it as one of the best titles for the Virtual Boy. \"Retronauts\" writer Jeremy Parish called it one of the stronger titles for the Virtual Boy and found it to be better than \"Nester's Funky Bowling\". Parish gave the game positive remarks for making subtle use of the system's hardware despite the premise, as well as its straightfoward mechanics, fast-paced tournament mode and controls."

        "text": "The South Florida Bulls lacrosse team will represent the University of South Florida in the sport of women's lacrosse beginning in spring 2025. They will compete in the American Athletic Conference of NCAA Division I. The Bulls will play their home games at Corbett Stadium on USF's Tampa campus, which they will share with the USF men's and women's soccer teams. It is the university's newest varsity sports team and the first new USF team since football was established in 1997. It will be the first new women's team in an NCAA sport at USF since women's soccer in 1995 (USF's women's sailing team was established in 1997, but it competes in the Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association rather than the NCAA).\nThe team will be coached by Mindy McCord.\nHistory.\nThe USF women's lacrosse team was first announced in November 2021 and will become the university's 20th varsity sports team. They were originally scheduled to take the field for the first time in spring 2024, but this date was later pushed back to spring 2025. Their first home field will be the on-campus Corbett Stadium which was built in 2011 as the new home for the Bulls soccer teams. This will be a temporary arrangement until plans are made for a lacrosse-specific stadium some time in the future.\nIn May 2022, athletic director Michael Kelly announced that former Jacksonville Dolphins head coach Mindy McCord would be the first head coach of the program.\nSee also.\nSouth Florida Bulls"

        "text": "Charles Berry (6 September 1863 – 11 October 1947) was a Scotland international rugby union player.\nRugby Union career.\nAmateur career.\nHe played for Fettesian-Lorettonians.\nHe became a student at Oxford University; and played for the Oxford University.\nHe then played for Edinburgh Wanderers.\nProvincial career.\nHe played for Edinburgh District in the 1886 inter-city match against Glasgow District.\nHe played for East of Scotland District in the January 1887 match against the West of Scotland District, scoring a conversion in the match. He played in the corresponding fixture the following year, in 1888, again for East of Scotland.\nInternational career.\nHe was capped 9 times for Scotland in the period 1884 to 1888. He scored 7 goals; 6 conversions and 1 goal from mark in those 9 matches.\nFamily.\nHis father was Walter Oliphant Berry (1827-1905); and his mother was Emily Eliza Hanson (1827-1909).\nDeath.\n\"The Scotsman\" of 15 October 1947 reported Berry's death:\nOne of Scotland ' s Oldest Rugby Caps.\nBy the death of Mr Charles Walter Berry in Edinburgh, at the age of 84, Scotland has lost one of her senior Rugby internationalists and Loretto School one of a notable band of pupils who provided the nucleus of the Oxford University XV in the match with Cambridge in the 1880s. When at Loretto Mr Berry was three years in the Rugby team, and four seasons in the cricket eleven, of . which he was captain in 1882. Proceeding to Oxford University, he got his Blue for Rugby in 1883, and again the following year, when there was a notable representation of seven players from the Musselburgh school in the team. The others were H. B. Tristram , G. C. Lindsay , A. S. Blair, A. G. G. Asher, A. McNeill , and R. C. Kitto. About the same time Mr Berry, a forward of fine physique, had attained international status, getting the first of his eight [sic] Scottish caps. Mr Berry, who was a bachelor, and lived at 11 Atholl Crescent, Edinburgh, never lost his interest in sport or in his old school. His copy of the Loretto Register was kept up to date in meticulous fashion. Gifted with an excellent memory he could recall incidents of long ago with rare facility. Last winter , when a representative of The Scotsman sought his help on behalf of a Welsh Veteran, against whom he had played at Newport in 1888, and who was anxious for news of Scottish Rugby survivors of that period, Mr Berry readily provided accurate details of the match as well as of his opponent. Among many other interests, Mr Berry, who was a merchant, was especially fond of music."

In the following season of 2005, the club placed second in the group stage, advancing to the final group, which they won after a key winning match with Al-Ittihad (73–65) and became the SBL champion and defended the title.\nIn 2005, the club also participated in the WABA Cup for the first time, where, after winning over Al-Shabab (98–51) and Al-Hillah, it placed 4th and advanced to the FIBA Asia Champions Cup.\nIn the 2005 FIBA Asia Champions Cup \ngroup stage, Al Jaish first lost to Kuwait SC 85–89, Fastlink SC 78–94 and Al-Rayyan 54–79.

        "title": "2022 in tennis",
        "text": "This page covers all the important events in the sport of tennis in 2022. It provides the results of notable tournaments throughout the year on both the ATP and WTA Tours, the Davis Cup, and the Fed Cup.\nNews.\nRafael Nadal won his second Australian Open title and record-breaking 21st major title overall (breaking a tie he held with Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer), defeating Daniil Medvedev in the final.\nNadal began 2022 with a 22-match win streak which ended with his loss in the finals of the 2022 BNP Paribas Open to Taylor Fritz.\nDjokovic, who is unvaccinated, did not play the Australian Open or tournaments in the United States because of vaccination requirements. Djokovic traveled to Australia believing he'd be able to play with a medical exemption but after a short detainment by the Australian Border Force, was deported from the country by Alex Hawke, the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs. In an interview with BBC News' Amol Rajan, Djokovic said missing tournaments because of his vaccination status was \"the price that I'm willing to pay\".\n2022 saw a rise in violent incidents with players like Alexander Zverev, Nick Kyrgios, and Jenson Brooksby throwing rackets and either hitting or nearly hitting officials or ball kids. Former players including Andy Roddick and Patrick McEnroe expressed their anger on Twitter that players weren't being punished. McEnroe wrote: \"Seriously what is it going to take …drawing blood …to properly punish a tennis player. This is absolutely absurd.\"\nThree-time grand slam champion Ashleigh Barty retired at 25 years old and was removed from the rankings making Iga Świątek the first Polish world No. 1.\n2021 US Open champion Daniil Medvedev claimed the No. 1 ranking following many of Djokovic's absences. This ended Djokovic's record 361 weeks as No. 1 and made Medvedev the first player outside of The Big Four to be No. 1 since Andy Roddick in 2004. Djokovic regained his No. 1 position after Medvedev was defeated at the 2022 BNP Paribas Open.\nAs part of international sports' reaction to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the WTA, the ATP, the ITF, and the four Grand Slam tournaments jointly announced that players from Belarus and Russia would not be allowed to play under the names or flags of their countries, but would remain eligible to play events until further notice. Certain Russian and Belarusian players such as Medvedev, Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, and Andrey Rublev spoke out against the war. After winning his semifinal match at the 2022 Dubai Tennis Championships, Rublev wrote \"No war please\" on a camera lens, a few days into the invasion. Belarusian and former No. 1, Victoria Azarenka was seen visibly crying during her third round loss at the 2022 BNP Paribas Open, and a few weeks later, stormed out of her match for good at the third round of the 2022 Miami Open against Linda Fruhvirtová. In a statement following her retirement, Azarenka said that her personal life had been \"extremely stressful\" and that she \"shouldn't have gone on the court today\". She deleted her social media accounts and said that she planned to take a break from the tour.\nTwenty-three-time Grand Slam champion and 5 time Olympic gold medalist Serena Williams made her return to the 2022 WTA Tour after sustaining a hamstring injury in the first round of the 2021 Wimbledon Championships. Accepting a wildcard into the women's draw of the 2022 Wimbledon Championships, Williams lost in the first round to Harmony Tan. This was only the second time in her career that she lost in the first round of a Grand Slam tournament. Following her Wimbledon loss, she returned for the US Open Series, where she beat Nuria Párrizas Díaz in straight sets at the 2022 National Bank Open. The following day, in an essay in Vogue, Williams announced she would be \"evolving away\" from tennis, signaling the end of her career after the 2022 US Open. The next day, she lost in the second round to Belinda Bencic. At the 2022 Cincinnati Masters, Williams lost to reigning US Open champion, Emma Raducanu. Prior to the US Open, Williams announced she would be playing doubles with her sister, Venus Williams. At her first round match at the 2022 US Open against Danka Kovinic, Williams won in straight sets. She then drew world no. 2 Anett Kontaveit, who she beat in three sets. With her win against Kontaveit, Williams became the oldest woman to defeat a top 3 player. The following night, Serena and Venus' doubles match was the first opening round doubles match to be televised in primetime. In her third round match against Ajla Tomljanović, Williams lost in three sets, despite commanding an early lead. With this loss, Williams confirmed her retirement after 27 years on the professional tour. Serena Williams is considered by many to be the greatest women's tennis player of all time.\nFurthermore, twenty-time Grand Slam champion Roger Federer announced his retirement at the end of 2022 Laver Cup after numerous injury setbacks at the end of the 2021 Wimbledon Championships."

        "text": "Mark Brown is a Welsh former rugby union international player. He was the first Black Welsh person to represent the Wales national rugby union team.\nEarly life.\nBrown was born in the Pillgwenlly area of Newport in 1958, to a Jamaican father and a mother from Yorkshire, England. Brown's family moved to Cwmbran at the age of six, where he attended Mount Pleasant and Coed Eva schools. Brown has stated that he was not from a rugby family, that his dad had no interest in the sport, being an avid cricket player and fan. As such, Brown did not pick up a rugby ball until he was seventeen.\nCareer.\nAt the age of seventeen Brown was invited to train with Cwmbran RFC (coached by former Ebbw Vale and Wales flanker Graham Jones). Brown only took the opportunity as a way to improve his fitness for the coming soccer season, but soon found himself playing matches for the club as a centre.\nBrown's career as a flanker started at a Gwent Youth match, Brown was in attendance as a spectator but was soon asked to fill in at openside flanker, as the Gwent team was short of players. Despite having to borrow a pair of boots, and never playing the position before, Gwent Youth won the match and Brown was formally invited to join the squad as a flanker. The team would go on to win that year's Welsh Youth Cup.\nBrown was then asked to play a single match for Jones' former club, Ebbw Vale away to Pontypool RFC. Despite losing heavily, Brown caught the eye of the Pontypool staff, and was soon invited to join them. By 1983, Brown had established himself as a first choice player in the Pontypool team. That year Pontypool won their first Schweppes Cup, with an 18-6 victory over Swansea RFC in the final. After a successful season, Brown was selected in the Welsh squad to play against Romania in Bucharest in November 1983; this ended in a 24-6 defeat for Wales, and he would not win another cap for two years. Brown was next called up for the 1986 Five Nations Championship, starting the first two games against England and Scotland, and played in all three tests of Wales' South Seas tour that summer.\nWales' first black player.\nBrown's international selection is retrospectively notable as he is now considered the first black Welshman to represent Wales in its national sport (sometimes attributed to Glen Webbe). Despite this, Brown has stated that it was not something that was talked about at the time adding, \"I didn’t even think about it. It didn’t even enter my head.\""

        "text": "The Counties Manukau cricket team represents the southern part of the Auckland Region, including the Auckland outer suburbs of Manurewa, Manukau and Papakura and the surrounding rural areas, and including Tuakau in the Waikato region. It competes in the Hawke Cup. Its base is in Manurewa, where its home ground is Weymouth Oval.\nTeams that previously represented the area in the Hawke Cup were Franklin (1957 to 1977) and Counties (1979 to 1994). Counties Manukau began playing in 1996.\nHistory.\nFranklin and Counties teams.\nCricket was played in the region in the late 1850s, and possibly earlier. The Mauku Cricket Club, which still competes at senior level, was established in 1859. There was a Franklin Cricket Association in the 1890s and 1900s, and the Warin Cup was instituted for competition between the region's clubs beginning with the 1911–12 season. The Association lapsed but was revived in 1921.\nFranklin, based in Pukekohe, was a part of the Auckland team's region until 1957, when the Franklin Cricket Association was affiliated with the New Zealand Cricket Council, entitling it to field a team in the Hawke Cup. By this new affiliation Franklin also became a constituent association of the Northern Districts team, which had begun competing in the Plunket Shield in 1956–57. Franklin competed for the first time in the Hawke Cup in December 1957, and continued doing so until 1977. In 1969-70 Philip Havill became the first Franklin player to represent Northern Districts in first-class cricket.\nFranklin were succeeded by Counties, also based in Pukekohe, who competed in the Hawke Cup from 1979 to 1994. In their first season they were captained by the Test batsman John Wright. Neither Franklin nor Counties ever won the title.\nCounties Manukau.\nThe Counties Manukau Cricket Association was established in 1996. Counties Manukau first challenged for the Hawke Cup in 2011–12. Captained by Luke Williamson, they won the title in the first challenge match of 2017-18 when they beat Bay of Plenty. They held the title against challenges from Taranaki and Canterbury Country at Weymouth Oval in Manurewa, before losing the last match of the season to Southland.\nCounties Manukau and the other five Northern Districts association teams also compete each season in two-day matches for the Fergus Hickey Rosebowl. The winner has the right to challenge for the Hawke Cup. Counties Manukau also compete in the Brian Dunning Cup, the 50-over competition among the six Northern Districts teams.\nClubs.\nIn the Counties Manukau Cricket Association, 12 clubs compete for the Warin Cup (overall champions), the W. H. Taylor Shield (two-day matches), the Duthie Cup (one-day matches) and the Inder-Lynch Trophy (T20 matches): Clevedon, Glenbrook-Maramarua, Karaka, Manukau City, Mauku, Papakura, Pohutukawa Coast, Pukekohe Metro, Tuakau, United, Waiuku and Weymouth."

        "text": "The list of Olympic men's ice hockey players for Germany consisted of 161 skaters and 20 goaltenders. Men's ice hockey tournaments have been staged at the Olympic Games since 1920 (it was introduced at the 1920 Summer Olympics, and was permanently added to the Winter Olympic Games in 1924). Germany has participated in six tournaments, the first in 1928 and the most recent in 2018. Between 1968 and 1988 Germany was divided at the Olympics, and both West Germany and East Germany sent separate teams. Germany's best finish is second overall, winning a silver medal at the 2018 Winter Olympics, while their lowest finish was eleventh place in 2010.\nMarkus Egen has scored the most goals, 14, and points, 16, while Thomas Brandl has the most assists with 6. Both Christian Ehrhoff and Stefan Ustorf Udo Kiessling have competed in the most Olympics, appearing in four tournaments with Germany, with Ustorf playing the most games, with 24.\nSeven players, Rudi Ball, Dieter Hegen, Gustav Jaenecke, Udo Kiessling, Uwe Krupp, Hans Rampf, and Xaver Unsinn have been inducted into the International Ice Hockey Federation Hall of Fame, though Unsinn was inducted as a builder."

        "text": "The women's ski cross competition in freestyle skiing at the 2022 Winter Olympics was held on 17 February, at the Genting Snow Park in Zhangjiakou. Sandra Näslund of Sweden won the event, which was her first Olympic medal. Marielle Thompson of Canada, the 2014 champion, won the silver medal. The bronze medal was split between Fanny Smith of Switzerland and Daniela Maier of Germany following a Court of Arbitration of Sport decision on 13 December 2022 in regards to an interference call in the final.\nThe 2018 champion, Kelsey Serwa, retired from competitions. The silver medalist Brittany Phelan and the bronze medalist Fanny Smith qualified for the Olympics. At the 2021–22 FIS Freestyle Ski World Cup, before the Olympics, Näslund won all events but one and consequently led the ranking, followed by Smith. Näslund was also the 2021 world champion, while Smith was the silver medalist.\nBronze medal controversy.\nFanny Smith of Switzerland, the 2018 bronze medalist, initially crossed the line in third place and thought she had won the bronze medal. Daniela Maier of Germany finished fourth. However, following a 10-minute review by race judges, Smith was penalised for a clash with Maier, so at the awards ceremony on 17 February 2022, Maier was awarded the bronze.\nOn 26 February 2022, after the end of the Olympic Games, following an appeal from Fanny Smith, the FIS Appeals Commission made the decision to overturn the FIS Jury decision. As a result of winning the appeal, Smith was promoted to third place, while Maier officially finished in fourth place, which was reflected on the FIS website.\nFIS has no right to make a decision on the return and redistribution of medals, as this issue is in the exclusive competence of the IOC; therefore, in its decision, the FIS Appeals Commission did not mention any words about the medals and their redistribution, and the IOC has the last word on this issue. On 13 December 2022, the Court of Arbitration for Sport decided both competitors will be awarded duplicate bronze medals and share third place.\nQualification.\nA total of 30 ski cross athletes qualified to compete at the games. For an athlete to compete they must have a minimum of 80.00 FIS points on the FIS Points List on January 17, 2022 and a top 30 finish in a World Cup event or at the FIS Freestyle Ski World Championships 2021.

        "text": "The Philippines national esports team represents the Philippines in international esports tournaments. It is organized under the Philippine Esports Organization.\nHistory.\nA national esports team representing the Philippines took part in the 2017 Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games in Turkmenistan, where the esports was held as a demonstration event. The Philippines did not have any esports representatives at the 2018 Asian Games in Indonesia, where it was likewise held as a demonstration event.\nWhen the Philippines hosted the 2019 Southeast Asian Games, it organized esports as a medal sport. A national esports team, under the moniker \"Sibol,\" was formalized by the Philippine Southeast Asian Games Esports Union (PSEU) for the purpose of the Philippines' participation in the regional games as hosts. The PSEU consists of officials of the National Electronic Sports Federation of the Philippines (NESFP) and the Esports National Association of the Philippines (ESNAP). Sibol fielded teams in all six events.\nIn 2020, the Philippine Esports Organization (PESO) was recognized by the Philippine Olympic Committee (POC) as the national sports association for esports in the Philippines. This recognition was disputed by the NESFP, which was involved in the PSEU. The other involved organization, ESNAP, already merged with PESO.\nSibol took part again in the 2021 Southeast Asian Games in Vietnam, where esports returned as a medal event. It intends to compete in all titles at the regional games. A national selection tournaments were held for each title, wherein the winning team from each selection would form the core of the Sibol lineup for their respective event. The qualifiers ended on February 28, 2022, and a total of 55 esports athletes represented the country. The campaign ended with two gold and two silver medals; which was considered as a success by PESO.\nThe team took part in the 2023 Southeast Asian Games and the 2023 ASEAN Para Games in Cambodia.\nThey made their Asian Games debut in the 2022 edition held in Hangzhou in September 2023 where esports was held as a regular event for the first time. Sibol did not win any medal.\nTeam image.\nThe Philippine esports team is also known as Team Sibol (stylized as SIBOL). The name \"sibol\" comes from the Filipino word for growth. The team logo is in red, yellow, and blue. The shape of the logo forms the abbreviation for the country, \"PHI,\" in a form that could represent a leaf or a flame.\nTitles.\nThe Philippine esports team has fielded teams and/or players for the following titles."

The event was won by Natalie Geisenberger, Johannes Ludwig, Tobias Wendl / Tobias Arlt. All these athletes previously won gold in their corresponding events. In particular, for Geisenberger this was the sixth gold Olympic medal, more than any other luger ever won. Austria, with Madeleine Egle, Wolfgang Kindl, and Thomas Steu / Lorenz Koller, won silver, and Latvia, with Elīza Tīruma, Kristers Aparjods, and Mārtiņš Bots / Roberts Plūme, bronze.\nGermany won both previous mixed team relays, at the 2014 and 2018 Olympics, and were leading the 2021–22 Luge World Cup before the Olympics. Latvia were second, and Austria third. In 2018, Canada were second and Austria third, however, after the retirements of Alex Gough and Samuel Edney, Canada were not performing well in the 2021–22 Luge World Cup and were not considered a medal contender.\nCanada, starting at number 8, set the track record, to be overtaken by the Russian Olympic Committee, who started at number 8, with four teams to go. Italy could not set the new track record, but Latvia did, taking the lead and ensuring a medal. So did Austria. Germany, a clear favorite, were still losing to the Austrians after the second leg, but Wendl and Arlt were faster and brought the team to the gold medals.\nQualification.\nAll countries qualifying a sled in each of the three individual/doubles events qualified to compete in the relay.\nOn December 17, 2021, the International Luge Federation announced that the qualification system was changed. The qualification system was changed due to training runs being cancelled at the first World Cup, and equipment not being delivered to the following World Cups. The new system will see athletes qualify based on their top four results during the World Cup season, (as opposed to the previous all seven results counting).\nOn January 19, 2022 the International Luge Federation announced the list of qualified athletes."

        "text": "Bombay Cricket Club was an Indian and Middle Eastern restaurant in Portland, Oregon's Buckman neighborhood, in the United States. Karim and Sherri Ahmad owned and operated the business from 1995 to 2016. The popular restaurant screened cricket matches and garnered a positive reception. It was named the city's best Indian restaurant by \"Portland Monthly\" in 2004.\nDescription.\nBombay Cricket Club was an Indian and Middle Eastern restaurant on Hawthorne Boulevard in southeast Portland's Buckman neighborhood, owned by Karim and Sherri Ahmad. One guide by Moon Publications described Bombay Cricket Club as an \"always packed two-tiered\" restaurant with many vegetarian options. The business aired cricket matches on televisions. \nMichael Russell of \"The Oregonian\" wrote, \"Like its predecessor, Masala Grove, the Bombay Cricket Club combined decadent Indian dishes with a handful of Middle Eastern specialties.\" The \"comprehensive\" menu included coconut curry with prawns, lamb vindaloo, okra, samosas, tandoori lamb, and mango margaritas.\nAccording to \"Portland Monthly\", Karim's chai recipe \"reflects the Kashmiri influence common in his native Punjab\". The magazine's Deena Prichep wrote in 2010: \"Lightly sweetened and seasoned with clean-tasting cardamom and aromatic saffron from India’s Moghul tradition, the drink has an interplay of sweet, sharp, floral, and rich flavors that seem to evolve with each sip, as the spices settle and your palate teases them apart.\" \nHistory.\nKarim and Sherri Ahmad opened the restaurant in 1995. The owners said approximately 90 percent of their customers were \"repeat visitors\".\nIn August 2016, the Admads confirmed plans to retire and close the restaurant on August 31, after operating for 21 years. Samantha Bakall included Bombay in \"The Oregonian\"'s list of the 15 \"biggest Portland restaurant and bar closings of 2016\". The vegetarian Indian restaurant Maruti began operating in the space in November.\nReception.\nIn 2003, \"Willamette Week\" Kelly Clarke said, \"Saburo's, along with places like Bombay Cricket Club and Escape from New York Pizza shake up routine meals by challenging our notion of what makes great restaurants tick.\" Bombay Cricket Club was named Best Indian Restaurant by \"Portland Monthly\" in 2004. In 2016, the magazine's Michelle Porter said the restaurant had \"[maintained] its reputation (and long lines) through several food revolutions—including the rise of Bollywood Theater\".\nIn 2016, Michael Russell of \"The Oregonian\" said the tandoori lamb was a \"standout\" and wrote, \"In the days before Bollywood Theater introduced Portland to Indian street snacks and Hillsboro's Indian food scene had blossomed, Bombay Cricket Club was considered among the best Indian restaurants in Portland. Judging from recent comments on the restaurant's Facebook page, it remained a favorite for many both inside and outside of Portland.\" The newspaper's Grant Butler included Bombay Cricket Club in a 2016 list of \"97 long-gone Portland restaurants we wish were still around\", writing, \"For years, one of the happiest places along lower Southeast Hawthorne Avenue was a seat at the bar at this popular Northern Indian spot.\""

        "text": "The Russian Volleyball Federation ( in Russian: Всероссийская федерация волейбола, Vserossijskaja Federacija Volejbola hence the acronym Latinized VFV or in Russian ВФВ) is the governing body of volleyball in Russia; although existing since 1991, it is the prosecutor of the pre-existing Soviet volleyball federation (Федерация волейбола СССР, Federacija Volejbola SSSR).\nIt organizes the men's and women's volleyball championships in Russia as well as the activities of the men's and women's national teams of Russia.\nIn response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the International Volleyball Federation suspended all Russian national teams, clubs, and officials, as well as beach and snow volleyball athletes, from all events, and stripped Russia of the right to host the 2022 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship in August 2022, and will relocate games that were to be in Russia in June and July. The European Volleyball Confederation (CEV) also banned all Russian national teams, clubs, and officials from participating in European competition, and suspended all members of Russia from their respective functions in CEV organs. It also canceled all competitions in Russia.\nHistory (Russia and Soviet Union).\nVolleyball appeared in Russia in 1914 in Kazan and Nizhny Novgorod, where it was promoted by American instructors. In 1915, they got acquainted with volleyball in Khabarovsk and Vladivostok.\nThe official date of birth of Soviet volleyball is considered to be July 28, 1923, when a match between the men's teams of the Higher Art and Theater Workshops (VKHUTEMAS) and the State School of Cinematography (VKHUTEMAS) took place in Moscow with official arbitration. From the mid-1920s, volleyball teams began to appear in Kharkov, Baku, Tbilisi, Grozny, and Leningrad.\nSince 1927, official competitions for the city championship began to be held in Moscow.\nOf importance for the further development of volleyball in the USSR was its inclusion in the program of the 1928 All-Union Spartakiad. Preparation for these competitions took place throughout the country. Qualifying tournaments were held in Moscow, Kharkov, and Tbilisi. The main competitions took place in Moscow. The Ukrainian team won the men's tournament, the Moscow team won the women's tournament.\nAfter the All-Union Spartakiad, the popularity of volleyball began to grow rapidly. In volleyball centers such as Moscow, Leningrad, Kharkov, the number of teams ran into many dozens. The geography of the game has also expanded significantly. Sections and teams began to appear in many cities of Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Transcaucasia, and Central Asia. Tournaments were held between the national teams of the cities and many exhibition matches.\nIn 1932, the All-Union Volleyball Section (since 1959, the USSR Volleyball Federation) was formed as an independent structure within the VSFC. Alexander Abramovich Potashnik was elected its first president.\nThe popularity of volleyball in the country was growing. In April 1933, the All-Union Volleyball Festival was held in Dnepropetrovsk, involving teams from all volleyball centers in the country. The combined men's and women's teams from Moscow became the winners of the tournament. In terms of their importance, these competitions were already actually the USSR championship. Therefore, it is customary to calculate the serial numbers of the All-Union championships, beginning in 1933.\nSince 1938, the USSR championships began to be held between club teams. The first winners of such competitions were \"Spartak\" (Leningrad) for men and \"Spartak\" (Moscow) for women.\nIn 1947, Soviet volleyball entered the international arena. In August in Prague (Czechoslovakia) at the 1st World Festival of Youth and Students, the men's team from Leningrad (reinforced by the volleyball players from Moscow) won a landslide victory in the tournament. In October of the same year, Dynamo Moscow (reinforced by players from other Moscow clubs) beat all their rivals during a tour of Poland.\nIn 1948, the All-Union Volleyball Section was admitted to the FIVB.\nIn September 1949, in Prague (Czechoslovakia), the USSR women's team competed in the First European Championship, and the men's team competed in the First World Championship. Both teams became winners of the competition.\nIn 1950, the first USSR Cup was held. The men's and women's teams of Dynamo (Moscow) became the owners of the new honorary trophy.\nIn October 1950, in Sofia (Bulgaria), the men's team competed for the first time in the European Championship and won it.\nIn August 1952 in Moscow, the USSR women's national team made its World Championship debut and became the winner of the competition.\nIn 1956, the 1st Summer Spartakiad of the Peoples of the USSR was held in Moscow, the winners of which the volleyball competitions were the Ukrainian men's national team and the Moscow women's team. These competitions were also the USSR championship. Volleyball was invariably present in all subsequent Spartakiads.\nIn 1960, the volleyball European Champions Cup was played for the first time between men's club teams, which was won by the CSKA team. A similar women's tournament was held in 1961 and the Soviet team Dynamo (Moscow) also became its winner.\nIn 1964, volleyball competitions were held in Tokyo (Japan) for the first time on the program of the Olympic Games. The USSR men's national team became the winner, and the women's team took second place.\nA year later, for the first time in Poland, the World Cup was played between men's teams, which was won by the USSR team.\nIn 1966, the USSR national teams debuted at the European Championships among youth teams. Both the men's and women's teams became champions.\nIn 1973, for the first time, CEV held a cup competition for club teams, the winners of which were volleyball players from the Zvezda (Voroshilovgrad) team and athletes from CSKA.\nIn 1977, the USSR national teams made their debut at the World Junior Championships. The men's team became the champion.\nIn the 1990/1991 season, under the auspices of the USSR Volleyball Federation, the last USSR championship and the USSR Cup took place, and in the 1992 Olympics season, the already open championships were played. Russia for women's teams and the CIS for men. \nIn 1991, the All-Russian Volleyball Federation was formed. Valentin Vasilyevich Zhukov, who held this position until 2004, was elected president.\nOn October 1, 1992, the USSR Volleyball Federation ceased to be a member of the FIVB and CEV. The volleyball federations of Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and other former Soviet republics became members of these international organizations.\nStructure.\nThe supreme body of the All-Russian Volleyball Federation is the Conference, which can have the status of report and election (which is held once every 4 years for the election of the leadership of the federation) and extraordinary (to resolve other issues). The last 13th information and election conference was held in December 2008 in Moscow.\nIn order to resolve the tasks set by the Conference for the RVF, as well as the statutory requirements, the conference delegates elect the Presidium for a period of 4 years. From among its members, the Presidium elects the Executive Committee, which implements the decisions of the Conference and the RVF Presidium and also organizes the day-to-day activities of the federation. Its work is headed by the President of the All-Russian Volleyball Federation, elected by the Conference for a term of 4 years. In addition to the President, the Executive Committee is made up of the RVF First Vice President, Vice Presidents, Secretary General, Director General, and other members.\nTo solve the special tasks facing the RVF, permanent technical commissions and councils have been created in its structure: an international commission, a commission for the logistics of competitions and the training process, a beach volleyball council, and a council of veterans. In addition, the structure of the VFV includes the All-Russian College of Judges and the Commission for Arbitration and Control and Audit elected at the conference.\nThe All-Russian Volleyball Federation includes 83 volleyball federations from Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Sevastopol, republics, territories, regions, and districts of the Russian Federation. In addition, 4 associations of regional volleyball federations (ARFV) have been formed: the Far East, Central Russia, Siberia, and the Urals.\nOfficial tournaments.\nAs part of its activities, the All-Russian Volleyball Federation is responsible for holding the following annual tournaments:"

        "text": "The 2022 Chinese Professional Baseball League season was the 33rd season of the Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL), based in Taiwan.\nSeason schedule.\nThe regular season began on 2 April 2022 at the Taichung Intercontinental Baseball Stadium. Teams are playing a split-season, while second-half games started on 22 July at the newly-renovated Hsinchu Municipal Baseball Stadium. The CPBL All-Star Game is being played the weekend of 30–31 July.\nThe postseason started on 29 October, followed by the first game of the Taiwan Series on 5 November. Postseason play featured a Playoff Series, played by the half-season champion with the lower winning percentage against the team with the next-highest winning percentage. The winner of the Playoff Series faced the half-season champion with the higher winning percentage in the Taiwan Series.\nDraft.\nFrom 2022, foreign-born players can be considered domestic draft picks if: they have attended a Taiwanese high school for three years, a Taiwanese university for four years, or have lived in Taiwan for five years, while playing for a Taiwanese semi-professional league for three years.\nMilestones.\nOn Opening Day, Lin Chih-sheng, who was released by the CTBC Brothers at the end of last season, hit the 290th home run of his career, breaking the league record held by Chang Tai-shan, who is a coach for his newly adopted team, the Wei Chuan Dragons.\nControversies.\nOn the opening weekend of the second half of the season, the high expectations for the re-opening of the Hsinchu Municipal Baseball Stadium were dashed when the league announced that the stadium was to be closed temporarily due to player safety issues. Injuries to players in both games played showed inadequacies in the stadium, including the nature of the dirt in the infield. The stadium was to have been a second home to the Wei Chuan Dragons for the second half of the season, but as of this time it is unclear when games will be played in the stadium again. \nPlayoffs.\nCPBL Playoff Series.\nThe series started with a 1–0 advantage for the second-placed team."

In his final year of eligibility, he received significant playing time with the Gloucester Rangers and posted strong numbers. He began attending Northeastern University the following year, serving as the Huskies starter as a freshman. In the program's first season under Bruce Crowder, Northeastern wasn't good and finished last in the Hockey East standings. The team saw a huge turnaround the following year and the team posted its first 20-win season in a decade. Robitaille was in net for each of those victories and lowered his goals against average by more than a goal per game. The massive swing to their success led the Toronto Maple Leafs to offer Robitaille a professional contract after the season. He jumped at the chance and ended his college career after being named an All-American.\nIn his first season with the Leafs, Robitaille was assigned to their AHL affiliate in St. John's. He split time in goal with two other netminders and while he did end up playing the most minutes, Robitaille did not distinguish himself as the top goalie on the team. His second season with the club turned out even worse and he watched most of the games from the bench after his GAA ballooned. Rather than continue his playing career, Robitaille retired after the season at the age of 23.\nRobitaille returned home and began attending the University of Ottawa, graduating with a degree in business administration in 2003. He went on to work in the energy industry, mostly as a trader, spending nearly 12 years with Brookfield Renewable Partners."

Since the Stuart Rink was not yet ready, this was critical to the progress of Army's team. While Kevin O'Shea was the only returning starter, the team coalesced swiftly around the forward combinations between O'Shea, Stevenson, Marinelli and Caywood. After New Years, consistent weather allowed army to play its full schedule of 14 games. Unfortunately, the cold temperatures, combined with the lack of seating at Stuart Rink, also restricted the size of the crowd at each of their games. With Baird providing capable goaltending, Army got off to a hot start, winning its first three games of the year. As their opposition become stronger, the Cadets began losing matches and they swiftly dropped down to a .500 record.\nIn early February, the defense put up a stout defense and Army was able to blank Dartmouth, defeating one of the best teams in the country. Army could not, however, sustain that effort and lost three of their last four games. While the cadets did break even with their record, the team's offense was limited to 1 goal or fewer in half of its games and would need to be better if Army was going to compete with the elite teams.\nJohn Binns served as team manager with Charles Mason and Francis Graling as his assistants.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"

Five years later, St. Lawrence founded its program and, with less than 10 miles separating the two campuses, they swiftly became rivals. They played one another at least once a year until warm weather and the great depression forced the Larries to suspend operations. The rivalry was eventually renewed in 1941 but World War II caused a second interruption in the series. In 1950 both schools were founding members of the Tri-State League, the first official conference for NCAA ice hockey. They remained in the league for over a decade until all three remaining teams were absorbed during the formation of ECAC Hockey in 1961. Being in the same conference for several decades has led to both teams playing one another on a consistent basis as well as common but infrequent postseason meetings.\nFrom 1970 through 1982, Clarkson and St. Lawrence jointly held the North Country Thanksgiving Festival, an in-season tournament.\nGame results.\nFull game results for the rivalry, with rankings beginning in the 1998–99 season."

After having received a scholarship from Florida State in November 2019, he committed to the Seminoles on March 3, 2020, one day after making his first visit to the school. He made his choice over offers from Alabama, Auburn, Clemson, Florida, Georgia, Michigan and Oklahoma, among others.\nOn December 15, 2021, Hunter flipped his commitment to the Jackson State Tigers coached by Deion Sanders, a Florida State alum, in an unprecedented move. He had visited the school the month before, attending their sellout Soul Bowl victory on November 20. As the number one recruit in the nation, Hunter became the first five-star recruit to ever sign with a HBCU or an FCS program. Dustin Lewis of \"Sports Illustrated\" called it \"probably the most shocking decision in the history of college football recruiting\" while Steve Wiltfong, the national director of recruiting for 247Sports.com, said it was \"the biggest signing day moment in the history of college football\".\nCollege career.\nJackson State.\n2022 season.\nHunter recorded two receiving touchdowns and two interceptions in the Jackson State spring game, which was the first HBCU spring game to ever be nationally televised. Hunter recorded his first collegiate touchdown as well as his first interception against Alabama A&amp;M on November 12, 2022. As a freshman, Hunter accumulated 19 total tackles, eight pass breakups, two interceptions, one fumble recovery and one defensive touchdown in seven games played. On offense, he added 18 receptions for 188 yards and four touchdowns.\nColorado.\n2023: Paul Hornung Award.\nHunter transferred to the University of Colorado in 2023, following Jackson State head coach Deion Sanders. In his FBS debut, Hunter played 147 total snaps across offense and defense in a 45-42 upset win over the TCU Horned Frogs.\nPersonal life.\nHunter's father, Travis Sr., starred on the football and track teams at Boynton Beach Community High School. He went on to play semipro football in the Florida Football Alliance and the Southern States Football League, winning the latter's Offensive Rookie of the Year award in 2007.\nIn February 2022, Hunter signed a Name, Image and Likeness (NIL) deal with J5 Caffe, a coffee company based in Columbus, Mississippi. In July 2022, Hunter signed a multiyear endorsement deal with Greenwood, a financial technology company based in Atlanta, Georgia. He is the first NIL deal for Greenwood. In September 2022, he became a brand ambassador for Michael Strahan's brands."

That run was something that we may never see again from anyone else. Unbelievable. Level raised. By such a large margin. They are going to give him a score that is going to be just out of this world.\" However, judges scored the run a 91.75, leaving him in second behind Scotty James. \nImmediately on-air, NBC's Richards blasted the judges, proclaiming “Ahhh what? What? Is there a mistake? There's no way, there is no way. A 91.75? ...as far as I'm concerned, the judges just grenaded all their credibility.\" He went on to add, \"It's unbelievable that this is even happening. It's a travesty to be completely honest with you. I am irate right now. Someone call the authorities, there's been a robbery.\" People online began to dub this controversy \"triple-gate\". X games silver medalist Nikko Landeros tweeted that Hirano \"just got robbed... this should never happen in the Olympics... what a disgrace.\" Ultimately, Hirano secured the gold medal on his third run by scoring a 96.00 by performing a triple cork and a 1440."

        "text": "The 2022 Rafael Nadal tennis season officially began on 3 January 2022, with the start of the ATP 250 tournament in Melbourne. It includes Nadal's best start to an ATP Tour season, when he won his first 20 matches (and three titles, including the Australian Open) in a row. It was also his career-first season winning the first two majors of the year, hence completing the Australian-French title double. As such, Nadal broke his tie with Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic, and became the first man in history to win a total 21 (after winning the 2022 Australian Open), and 22 (after winning the 2022 French Open) Grand Slam singles titles.\nYearly summary.\nEarly hard court season.\nMelbourne Summer Set 1.\nRafael Nadal won his 89th ATP singles title at Melbourne Summer Set 1 without dropping a set en route, defeating qualifier Maxime Cressy in the final.\nAustralian Open.\nNadal won his second Australian Open title and 21st men's singles major title overall, surpassing an all-time record he jointly held with Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer. Nadal defeated Denis Shapovalov and Matteo Berrettini en route to the final, where he outlasted Daniil Medvedev in five hours and 24 minutes. Nadal was down two sets, and serving at 2-3 0-40 in the third, eventually winning 2-6 6-7(5-7) 6-4 6-4 7-5. It was Nadal's 90th ATP title, and he became the second man in the Open Era, after Djokovic, to achieve the double career Grand Slam.\nMexican Open.\nNadal stormed to the title in high form, not dropping a set in any of his five matches (including a win over Medvedev, who earlier that week had clinched the world No. 1 ranking). He beat Cameron Norrie in the final to win his third title of the year and extend his unbeaten streak for the season to 15-0, his career-best start to an ATP Tour season.\nIndian Wells Masters.\nNadal reached the final for a fifth time after beating Sebastian Korda, Daniel Evans, Reilly Opelka, Nick Kyrgios and compatriot Carlos Alcaraz. He then lost in the final to Taylor Fritz, ending his 20 match winning streak, which marks his career-best start to a season.\nClay court season.\nNadal missed the Monte Carlo Masters and the Barcelona Open citing a rib injury sustained in the Indian Wells final. It was the first time in his career that he was forced to miss Monte Carlo and Barcelona where he has won 11 and 12 titles respectively.\nMadrid Open.\nNadal returned to play in Madrid. In his first match he beat Miomir Kecmanović, then saved 4 match points to beat David Goffin to reach the quarterfinals, where he was defeated by eventual champion Carlos Alcaraz in three sets.\nItalian Open.\nNadal returned to Rome as the defending champion, and defeated John Isner in straight sets in the second round. Nadal faced physical pain during his third round encounter with Denis Shapovalov due to his prevailing chronic foot injury, and lost in three sets.\nFrench Open.\nNadal won his 14th French Open title and a record-extending 22nd men's singles major title overall. He defeated four Top-10 players en route to the title; Félix Auger-Aliassime (fourth round), Novak Djokovic (quarterfinals), Alexander Zverev (semifinals), and Casper Ruud (final). Nadal completed the Australian–French double for the first time in his career, and became one of five men to do so in the Open Era. Nadal also became the oldest singles champion (36 years 2 days) in the history of the French Open.\nGrass court season.\nWimbledon.\nAfter treating his foot injury, Nadal returned to Wimbledon for the first time in three years. However, he tore an abdominal muscle during the tournament, which was aggravated after his quarterfinal match against Taylor Fritz. Despite winning the encounter, Nadal withdrew from the tournament the following day.\nNorth American hard court season.\nCincinnati Masters.\nNadal returned to the Cincinnati Masters in his first match since facing an abdominal muscle tear at Wimbledon, however lost to the eventual-champion Borna Ćorić in the opening round.\nUS Open.\nNadal returned to the US Open after not playing for 3 years and had his first hard court match since Cincinnati. He beat Rinky Hijikata in the first round, Fabio Fognini in the second round and Richard Gasquet in the third round. In the fourth round Nadal lost to Frances Tiafoe, ending his bid of a 3rd major in 2022.\nLaver Cup.\nNadal participated at the Laver Cup in London. He played just one doubles match, alongside longtime friend and rival Roger Federer in what was Federer's final professional tennis match. The pair lost to Jack Sock and Frances Tiafoe 11-9 in the final set tiebreak, despite holding a match point on Federer's serve.

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Panthers represent High Point University in the NCAA's Big South Conference.\nHigh Point began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1927. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but High Point's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

        "text": "Surfing Santas is an annual festival held in Cocoa Beach, Florida, on Christmas Eve. Participants dress up as Santa Claus and surf, while thousands of spectators watch from the beach, which hosts a costume competition and live music.\nEvent.\nSurfing Santas is a free beach party held between 8a.m. and noon on Christmas Eve at the Minutemen Causeway area of Cocoa Beach, Florida; the Santas surf from 10a.m.\nIt attracts hundreds of surfers, traditionally dressed as Santa Claus but some also wearing elf, reindeer, and Grinch costumes, as well as thousands of spectators every year. Local food stalls open on the beach for the event. A live band plays music at the event, which also features a costume competition and Hawaiian dancers. Festival regulars include \"Mr. and Mrs. Surfing Santa\" – Clifford \"Peanut\" and Terrie Keuhner. The festival collects charity donations for the Florida Surf Museum and Grind For Life. The festivals have raised over $90,000 for local charities. As Cocoa Beach is on the Space Coast, themed shirts depicting Santa in space are sold at the event.\nHistory.\nCocoa Beach has a prominent surfing history, and is considered a capital of the activity. Surfing Santas began in 2009, started by George Trosset and his family, and since 2014 the event has been organized along with the Florida Surf Museum. Trosset grew up in Rockledge, Florida, and was around surfing Santa iconography from his childhood. He moved to Cocoa Beach to take over his grandfather's boat shop in 1979, selling the business in 1998. Inspired by a Honda commercial showing surfers driving to the beach on Christmas and surfing while wearing Santa hats and white beards, Trosset decided to expand on this and make it a Christmas tradition. His wife made him a Santa costume and he went out surfing on Christmas Eve 2009 with his children; \"Florida Today\" photographer Rik Jesse was at the beach, and published photographs he took of Trosset in the Christmas Day paper. As he intended, Trosset continued his tradition, inviting along friends and drawing crowds of similar-minded people. The surfing Santas all convened near Trosset's beach house, but grew too numerous in 2013. Cocoa Beach city council then approved organizing the event downtown.\nIn 2018, around 10,000 people attended, 75% of which spent more than one day for their visit, creating Christmas tourism in the area. \"Beach Grit\" suggested that Surfing Santas had become Cocoa Beach's biggest claim to fame, overtaking Kelly Slater. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the event continued in 2021; it had been held virtually in 2020, though several hundred people still went to the beach to surf as Santa without the festival."

Additionally, Campbell chose to pursue rugby over football, and joined Young Munster ahead of the 2021–22 All-Ireland League, quickly impressing in a series of strong performances for the Limerick club.\nMunster.\nCampbell scored a hat-trick of tries for a Munster Development XV against Ulster in September 2021 and, in November of the same year, joined Munster's academy. He was registered with Munster's Champions Cup squad in December 2021 following the disruption caused by the province's recent tour to South Africa, and made his senior competitive debut for the province in their opening 2021–22 Champions Cup fixture away to English club Wasps on 12 December 2021, starting and scoring a try in the province's 35–14 win.\nCampbell signed a new contract that will see him continue as an academy player for the 2022–23 season before joining Munster's senior squad on a two-year contract from the 2023–24 season. He featured off the bench in Munster's historic 28–14 win against a South Africa XV in Páirc Uí Chaoimh on 10 November 2022.\nIreland.\nHaving featured in the warm-up games against Munster and Leinster development sides, Campbell was selected in the Ireland under-20s squad for the 2022 Six Nations Under 20s Championship when it was announced in January 2022. He made his competitive debut for the under-20s in their tournament-opening 53–5 win against Wales on 4 February, though Campbell had to leave the field due to an injury during the first-half. That injury did not prevent Campbell from starting in Ireland's 17–16 away win against France one week later, the 39–12 win against Italy on 25 February, the 42–27 away win against England on 12 March, and the 59–5 home win against Scotland on 20 March that secured a Grand Slam for Ireland.\nCampbell was initially ruled out of the Under-20s Summer Series due to a thumb injury and was not selected in Ireland' squad, however, he recovered faster than anticipated and only missed the opening fixture against France, returning to start against South Africa on 29 June 2022 and played the full 80 minutes in Ireland's 33–24 defeat, before also starting in the 37–36 win against England on 5 July and the 41–24 win against Scotland on 12 July in Ireland's final match of the series."

It was one of a pair of portraits of Moncada simultaneously commissioned in 1634, just after his return to his native Flanders after a stay in London - the other is in the seated \"Portrait of Francisco de Moncada\" (Kunsthistorisches Museum). He probably copied the pose from a drawing of a horse-rider seen face on by his former master Peter Paul Rubens, whilst Charles Coypel in turn produced a copy of the work.\nThe two best-known versions of the portrait are in Spain: one in the Museu de Belles Arts in Valencia and the other in the collection of the Duke of Alba. The first, made by Van Dyck himself, was acquired by Manuel Montesinos y Molina and remained in his family until 1941 when it was donated to the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Carlos to be exhibited in the Valencian art gallery. The second, a copy of the Van Dyck, would have been commissioned by the mother of the Marchioness of Carpio, Catalina Fernández de Córdoba, and, after the extinction of the house of Haro, it passed with the titles and other properties to the Dukes of Alba.\nOther copies are those made by Géricault and Watteau that are in the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam and the Lousada collection, respectively."

        "text": "Ice hockey at the 2022 European Youth Olympic Winter Festival comprised two ice hockey tournaments in the under-17 competition class – a boys' tournament and a girls' tournament – during the Vuokatti 2022 edition of the European Youth Olympic Festival (EYOF). The boys' tournament was held from 13 to 17 December 2021 and, following the postponement of the event due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the girls' tournament was played from 21 to 25 March 2022. Both tournaments were played at the Kajaanin jäähalli in Kajaani, Finland. The girls' tournament marked the first time women's ice hockey was included in the programme of a European Youth Olympic Festival.\nBoys' tournament.\nPlayed during 13 to 17 December 2021, the boys' ice hockey tournament was the first event contested as part of the EYOF Vuokatti 2022. The five participating teams played a single round-robin of ten games and ranking was determined by a standard point system: three points were awarded for a win, two points for an overtime win, one point for an overtime loss, and no points were awarded for a loss in regulation.\nHosts Finland were victorious in each of their four games, successfully sweeping the tournament and winning their third EYOF gold medal. Belarus took home silver after beating bronze medalists Russia by just one point in the points tally – the result of their overtime win over Russia in game four. Despite ranking second in goals scored, the Czech Republic took fourth place in the final rankings and Latvia rounded out the table in fifth place.\nThe Czech team featured the top three point scorers of the tournament: scoring leader Eduard Šalé, who scored 2 goals and 6 assists for 8 points; second ranked Šimon Slavíček, who scored 4 goals and 2 assists for 6 points; and third ranked Adam Dvořák, who scored 4 goals and an assist for 5 points. Four Finns tied for fourth in scoring with 2 goals and 3 assists for 5 points each: Jere Lassila, Lenni Hämeenaho, Aleksanteri Kaskimäki, and Oskari Vuorio. The goal scoring table was topped by a three-player tie between the Czech Republic's Slavíček and Dvořák and Nikolai Tishkevich of Belarus, all of whom tallied 4 goals apiece.\nThe leading scorer of those teams not represented in the top-five on the points table were: Nikolai Tishkevich (4+0) for Belarus, Artem Duda (0+4) for Russia, and Emīls Veckaktiņš (2+1) for Latvia.\nGames.\n\"All times are local (UTC+2).\"\nGirls' tournament.\nThe girls' tournament was played in two stages, a preliminary round followed by the finals, a different format than was used for the boys' single pool tournament. In the preliminary round, the six participating teams were separated into two groups of three and played a single round-robin of three games per group. Ranking from the preliminary round established placement for the finals.\nThe Czech Republic and Sweden, winners of Group A and B respectively, faced off in the gold medal game. After sixty minutes of play, the match was tied 1–1, with a Czech goal from Adéla Šapovalivová and the Swedish goal from Olivia Sohrner. The tie was maintained through an overtime period and held steady until the fourth round of the shootout, when the Czech Republic's Zikmunda Mazancová scored what would stand as the only goal registered by any of the ten shooters and the Czechs won the inaugural gold medal in girls' ice hockey at a European Youth Olympic Winter Festival.\nFinland claimed victory over Switzerland with a 5–1 score in the bronze medal game and Slovakia held Hungary scoreless to take fifth place.\nThe girls' ice hockey tournament was the third-most viewed event of the EYOF Vuokatti 2022 in terms of streaming, with 13,624 viewers.\nPlayer statistics.\nScoring leaders.\nList shows the top skaters sorted by points, then goals.\nLeading goaltenders.\nOnly the top five goaltenders, based on save percentage, who have played at least one third of their team's minutes, are included in this list."

While historically skaters share the work by rotating the front athlete to the back, they transferred energy from one athlete to the other by pushing and not rotating. The technique has since become known as the American Push.\nIn February 2021 the Canadian team won a World Cup using this new technique. In an ISU press release the second place Dutch team conceded that the strategy was superior to their approach.\nIn the last World Cup before the Olympic Games the US team set a world record on home ice using the new technique.\nAll three medal winning teams at the 2022 Beijing Olympics used the American Push technique.\nThe significance of the American Push has been compared to the Fosbury Flop and the Clap Skate.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world, Olympic and track records were as follows.\nA new Olympic record was set during the competition.\nResults.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe quarterfinals were held on 13 February at 21:00.\nSemifinals.\nThe semifinals were held on 15 February at 14:52.\nFinals.\nThe finals were held on 15 February at 15:43."

While no Russians competed in Cottbus, some competed at the following World Cup in Doha alongside Ukrainian athletes. During the medal ceremony for the parallel bars Russian gymnast and bronze medalist Ivan Kuliak wore a Z on his chest – a military symbol and a sign of support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine – despite sharing a podium with gold medalist Illia Kovtun, a Ukrainian athlete, and Kazakh gymnast and silver medalist Milad Karimi who lives and trains in Ukraine. The FIG announced that it will ask the Gymnastics Ethics Foundation to open disciplinary proceedings against Kuliak. The day before the incident the FIG announced that starting March 7 Russian and Belarusian athletes would be banned from participating in FIG-sanctioned competitions.\nThe FIG sanctioned Kuliak with a one-year ban, ending May 17, 2023 or six months after the ban on Russian athletes is lifted and ruled that he is to be stripped of his bronze medal and prize money."

Diving took place at the purpose-built Royal Commonwealth Pool.\nCanada performed the strongest at the event, winning 6 medals overall, including the gold and silver at both women's events. Canada missed out on a clean sweep of medals on the women's event by a small margin, with Australia's Gaye Morley beating Canada's Nancy Robertson on the 3m event by less than 4 points, while on the 10m event, Canada's Kathleen Rollo missed out on a bronze medal to England's Shelagh Burrow by just 0.3 points. All four girls were described as being \"overcome by the tension\" in what were emotional scenes. On winning the 3m event, Beverley Boys conveyed that she did not feel as confident in that event as she was feeling for the upcoming 10m tower event. Her total score of 432.87 in the 3m event was her highest ever achieved in an international competition.\nCanada's overall performance at the event was praised by \"The Brandon Sun\", who described the country as being a \"dominant power in Commonwealth Games diving\", following the second gold medal won by Beverley Boys. The 1970 women's diving event was the start of a gold medal winning streak for the Canadian team that would last until the 1982 Commonwealth Games, where Canadian women competitors had to settle for silver medals.\nDon Wagstaff, who picked up gold in both of the men's events, became the first Australian man to win a gold medal in a springboard event at any previous Olympic or Commonwealth Games. Wagstaff was described as having given \"the best exhibition of spring-board diving seen by an Australian\", which was witnessed by his mum who had to save $1000 to travel to the games.\nIn each of the four events, competitors from the host country Scotland finished last.\nReferences.\nCitations\nSources"

        "title": "2022 Japanese Grand Prix",
        "text": "The 2022 Japanese Grand Prix (officially known as the Formula 1 Honda Japanese Grand Prix 2022) was a Formula One motor race held on 9 October 2022 at the Suzuka International Racing Course in Suzuka, Japan. Max Verstappen secured his second World Championship title after finishing first, in front of Sergio Pérez and Charles Leclerc. Despite only 28 of the scheduled 53 laps being completed, full points were awarded due to a loophole in the regulations regarding how points should be allocated, with the rules stating that reduced points should only be awarded in shortened races that end under red flag conditions. As this race ended under green flag conditions, this system was not applied. The wording of the sporting regulations was subsequently amended for 2023, so races that do not reach the 75 percent distance are awarded shortened race points regardless of whether a race finishes under red or green flag conditions.\nBackground.\nThe event was held across the weekend of the 7–9 October. It was the eighteenth round of the 2022 Formula One World Championship and the first time the event had been held since , with the and races cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Valtteri Bottas entered as the defending race winner.\nChampionship standings before the race.\nGoing into the weekend, Max Verstappen led the Drivers' Championship by 104 points from Charles Leclerc, second, and teammate Sergio Pérez, third, by 106. Red Bull Racing team led the Constructors' Championship, leading Ferrari by 137 points and Mercedes by 203 points. For the second race running, Verstappen had an opportunity to secure his second World Drivers' Championship in a row. He needed to outscore Leclerc by eight points and Pérez by six. Verstappen could have won the title as follows:\nEntrants.\nThe drivers and teams were the same as the season entry list with no additional stand-in drivers for the race.\nTyre choices.\nTyre supplier Pirelli brought the C1, C2, and C3 tyre compounds (designated hard, medium, and soft, respectively) for teams to use at the event.\nPenalties.\nWilliams' Nicholas Latifi carried a five-place grid penalty for causing a collision with Zhou Guanyu at the previous round, the Singapore Grand Prix.\nQualifying.\nAfter qualifying, Max Verstappen was given a reprimand by stewards for an incident in Q3 involving loss of control of the car requiring Lando Norris to manoeuvre around Verstappen at speed coming out of 130R. There was no grid penalty issued.\nQualifying classification.\nNotes\nRace.\nRace report.\nBefore the race started, voice actress, singer and narrator Nana Mizuki sang the Japanese national anthem. The race started at 14:00 local time on 9 October 2022 under torrential rain (which was the reason for so many incidents in the race) and was red-flagged on lap 2 after Ferrari driver Carlos Sainz Jr. lost control into the hairpin of the opening lap and aquaplaned into the barriers. A recovery vehicle was immediately dispatched, with several drivers passing the tractor at speed under double-yellow flags on the second lap. Alex Albon also retired due a collision with Kevin Magnussen which caused damage to his radiator.\nThe race resumed at 16:15 local time behind the safety car. Only twenty-eight laps were completed before the race was curtailed due to it passing the three-hour time limit, with Verstappen taking his twelfth victory of the season. Leclerc, who finished second on track, was given a five-second penalty for cutting the final chicane whist defending from Pérez in third, which demoted him to third behind Pérez. The win meant that Verstappen took the Championship title, leading Pérez by 113 points, with 112 points still available.\nPost-race.\nAs less than 75% of the scheduled race distance had been completed, the majority of the paddock were under the impression that Verstappen would not be awarded full points, Verstappen instead earning 19 points and Leclerc 12, which would have left Verstappen one point short of claiming the championship. Verstappen himself expressed surprise in the cooldown room that full points had been awarded, making him champion.\nThe confusion regarding the number of points awarded was as a result of a rule change introduced for the 2022 season. Although historically races curtailed on such a scale as this Grand Prix would see half-points awarded, the wording of the new regulation only applied \"If a race is suspended and cannot be resumed\"; as the race was resumed and completed short, the FIA awarded full points under a strict reading of the regulations, effectively bypassing the gradual scale points system that had been introduced for 2022, following dissatisfaction with how points were allocated at the 2021 Belgian Grand Prix. Red Bull Racing team principal Christian Horner expressed his view that the rule would be revised for the season to closer match the teams' intentions when the rule was written. Prior to the 2023 championship the F1 Commission agreed to alter the wording of the regulations to ensure all races where less than 75% of the race distance is completed now use the sliding scale system to determine the points being given, regardless of whether they finish under red or green flag conditions. This wording change satisfies the original intention of the gradual scale points system when it was introduced in 2022.\nThe deployment and position of the recovery vehicle on the track was criticised after AlphaTauri driver Pierre Gasly narrowly missed the vehicle due to poor visibility, angrily remonstrated that \"[he] could have killed [himself]\" if he had lost control and hit the vehicle, even at reduced speed. Gasly also attacked the deployment as \"disrespectful\" to the memory and family of his childhood friend Jules Bianchi, who suffered fatal injuries at the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix when he crashed into a recovery vehicle after aquaplaning off the circuit. Bianchi's godson Charles Leclerc also said that the sport should learn from Bianchi's death and not have similar issues in the future, and Bianchi's father wrote on Instagram that the race officials had \"no respect\" for either the life of the drivers or Bianchi's memory. The FIA confirmed there would be an investigation into the deployment of recovery vehicles.\nRace classification.\nNotes\nFIA investigation.\nOn 21 October 2022, the FIA published its review into the Grand Prix with the FIA's report recognising that the deployment of the recovery vehicle could have been handled better.\nThe FIA is due to implement a warning system of recovery vehicles on track. The FIA stated that the VSC system would be improved so that the drivers speed limit could vary depending on where the car is in relation to the site of any on-track incident. In addition the FIA said it would look into further improvements to the full wet weather tyres and to circuit's drainage capabilities. The FIA stated the intention to review how points were awarded at the next World Motorsport Council meeting.\nThe FIA abandoned the idea of rotating race directors, leaving Niels Wittich as the sole serving race director for the final four rounds of the championship. The rotation policy was not met with favourable reviews from drivers, as well as being in response to criticism of Eduardo Freitas' performance as race director at this event."

The start of the race was delayed by over an hour due to a thunderstorm and led to the race starting under wet conditions which gradually dried to allow slick tyres in the second half of the race. Despite a five-second time penalty, the race was won by Red Bull Racing driver Sergio Pérez, with pole sitter Charles Leclerc finishing second and his Ferrari teammate Carlos Sainz Jr. finishing third.\nBackground.\nThe event was held across the weekend of the 30 September – 2 October. It was the seventeenth round of the 2022 Formula One World Championship and the first time the event had been held since , with the and races cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Sebastian Vettel entered as the defending race winner.\nChampionship standings before the race.\nMax Verstappen led the Drivers' Championship by 116 points from Charles Leclerc, second, and teammate Sergio Pérez, third, by 125. Red Bull Racing team led the Constructors' Championship, leading Ferrari by 139 points and Mercedes by 164 points.\nVerstappen could have secured his second World Drivers' Championship in a row. He had to outscore Leclerc by 22 points, Pérez by 13 and George Russell by six. Verstappen could have won the title as follows:\nEntrants.\nThe drivers and teams were the same as the season entry list with no additional stand-in drivers for the race. The Grand Prix marked the 350th race start for Fernando Alonso, breaking the record previously held by Kimi Räikkönen.\nTyre choices.\nTyre supplier Pirelli brought the C3, C4, and C5 tyre compounds (designated hard, medium, and soft, respectively) for teams to use at the event.\nTrack changes.\nThe first and the third activation point of the DRS were moved further back, being positioned after turn 5 and after the apex of turn 23, respectively.\nQualifying.\nQualifying began under wet conditions with the drivers starting on intermediate tyres, then switching to dry, soft compound tyres in Q3. Charles Leclerc took pole position, ahead of Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton. Championship Leader Max Verstappen was in contention for pole position, but had to abandon his final lap after running short of fuel, leading to him qualifying eighth.\nQualifying classification.\nNotes\nRace.\nRace report.\nThe race was held on 2 October. It was due to start at 20:00 local time (), before being delayed to 21:05 due to thunderstorms. The race started with all cars on the intermediate tyres. Sergio Pérez took the lead from Charles Leclerc into turn 1, while Carlos Sainz Jr. passed Lewis Hamilton into third place. Max Verstappen dropped to twelfth place on lap 1, before recovering to ninth by lap 7 when a safety car was triggered following a collision between Nicholas Latifi and Zhou Guanyu, forcing both to retire. Following the restart, Verstappen advanced to seventh, being unable to overtake Fernando Alonso until Alonso's retirement on lap 21 due to an engine failure. Alonso's retirement caused a virtual safety car, leading to Mercedes pitting George Russell for dry medium tyres. An additional two virtual safety car periods followed, the first when Alexander Albon struck the wall, resulting in the loss of the front wing and his retirement due to damage, and the second after Esteban Ocon suffered an engine failure. On lap 33, after running in fourth since the start of the race, Hamilton went into the wall at turn 7. He was able to re-join the track just behind Lando Norris, defending against Verstappen.\nAs Russell's pace improved, setting fastest laps, the rest of the field switched to slick tyres (Pierre Gasly being the first on lap 34). Due to Hamilton's accident, he additionally had to change his front wing, dropping him to ninth. Yuki Tsunoda crashed out at turn 10 on lap 36, triggering a second safety car. Having stayed out of the pits for an additional lap, this allowed the two McLarens of Norris and Daniel Ricciardo to pit for slick tyres with Norris maintaining fourth position and Ricciardo moving up to sixth. Upon the restart, Pérez continued to lead from Leclerc and Sainz. In an attempt to overtake Norris into turn 7, Verstappen locked up, initially falling to eighth, then requiring an extra pitstop for fresh soft tyres. This briefly placed Verstappen in last until a minor collision between Russell and Mick Schumacher, resulting in both pitting for soft tyres. After leading the majority of the race, Pérez was challenged by Leclerc for the lead. Despite Leclerc gaining DRS assistance and coming within two tenths of a second behind Pérez, he was unable to retake the lead of the race. After recovering to his starting position, Verstappen overtook Sebastian Vettel on the final lap to take seventh. Pérez, having widened his lead to 7.595 seconds late in the race, claimed his fourth career victory and first in Singapore, ahead of Leclerc in second, and Sainz in third. Russell set the fastest lap on lap 54, but finished outside of the point scoring positions.\nPérez was investigated for two separate breaches of article 55.10 of the sporting regulations - falling more than ten lengths behind the safety car, receiving a warning for the first offense, and a five-second time penalty for the second, due to repeating the offence after being warned not to. This reduced his lead to 2.595 seconds, but did not affect his race win. Because both Alonso and Ocon retired during the race, while Norris and Ricciardo finished fourth and fifth, this promoted McLaren to fourth in the Constructors' Championship ahead of Alpine. Additionally, Vettel's finish in eighth and his teammate Lance Stroll finishing in sixth, promoted Aston Martin to seventh in the Constructors' Championship. Latifi received a five-place grid penalty for the Japanese Grand Prix, for causing the collision with Zhou on lap seven.\nRace classification.\nNotes"

As Boca Juniors won both the 2019–20 Primera División and the 2020 Copa LPF, River Plate and Banfield (the runners-up in those competitions) played a semi-final on 22 February 2023 to determine who would play Boca Juniors in the final."

The sixth discipline, Alpine combined, had all of its events in the 2021–22 season cancelled due to the schedule disruption cased by the COVID-19 pandemic, which also happened in 2020–21. The schedules were also revamped as a consequence of the pandemic, thus ensuring that the combined number of speed races (18, consisting of 11 downhills and 7 Super-Gs) was the same as the combined number of technical races (18, consisting of 10 slaloms and 8 giant slaloms), with just one parallel race. The season did not have any cancellations.\nThe season was interrupted by the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, China (at the Yanqing National Alpine Skiing Centre in Yanqing District) from 6–19 February 2022.\nAfter 34 events, Marco Odermatt of Switzerland had clinched the season championship. Although Odermatt was less than 200 points ahead of Aleksander Aamodt Kilde of Norway on 6 March, Kilde announced that he would skip the next three races, allowing Odermatt to build an insurmountable lead.\nThe last four events of the season took place at the World Cup final, Wednesday, 16 March through Sunday, 20 March in the linked resorts of Courchevel and Méribel, France, which are located in Les Trois Vallées. Only the top 25 in each specific discipline for the season and the winner of the Junior World Championship in each discipline were eligible to compete in the final, with the exception that athletes who have scored at least 500 points in the overall classification were eligible to participate in any discipline, regardless of standing in that discipline for the season."

The first two matches were played in Bloemfontein, and the last match in Kimberley.\nEngland lost the opening ODI by 27 runs despite a century for Jason Roy helping them to 146/0 inside 20 overs, chasing South Africa's total of 298/7. South Africa completed their third-highest successful ODI chase in the second match, with a Temba Bavuma century leading them past England total of 342/7.

In May 2022, Cricket Australia (CA) confirmed the fixtures for the tour.\nEngland won the first T20I in Perth by 8 runs, Alex Hales top scoring with 84 runs from 51 balls after David Warner had scored 73 from 44 for the hosts. A talking point from the match came in the 17th over of Australia's innings when Matthew Wade appeared to block England bowler Mark Wood from fielding the ball after it had looped up off the top edge of Wade's bat. England captain Jos Buttler opted not to appeal for a dismissal under Law 37 \"obstructing the field\", citing a long tour and preferring not to risk such an appeal on this occasion. England sealed the series with another 8-run victory in the second T20I, with Dawid Malan's 82 runs from 49 balls helping them recover from a poor start in Canberra. The final T20I was eventually abandoned due to rain after England's innings had been reduced to 12 overs and Australia lost three early wickets in their run chase.\nSquads.\nEngland also named Tymal Mills, Richard Gleeson and Liam Dawson as travelling reserves for the T20I series and the T20 World Cup. On the same day as the squad announcement, Jonny Bairstow was ruled out of the tournament after sustaining a possible broken leg while playing golf. On 7 September, Alex Hales was named as Bairstow's replacement in the squad. On 6 October, CA announced the squad for the T20I series with their plan of pre-World Cup squad shuffle between the first and last two T20Is. Glenn Maxwell was ruled out of Australia's ODI squad before the start of the ODI series after suffering a broken leg, with Sean Abbott named as his replacement. Josh Inglis was added to Australia's ODI squad before the second ODI in place of Cameron Green, after which Mitchell Starc was rested for the third ODI and Riley Meredith was added to the squad as a replacement."

Defending champion Sofia Goggia of Italy, who won four of the five downhills in which she competed in 2020-21, continued her domination in 2021-22 by again winning four of the first five downhills. Goggia took a commanding lead in the discipline after American Breezy Johnson, who finished second in each of the first three downhills, missed the rest of the season with a knee injury. Goggia then suffered her own knee injury, including a broken bone and ligament tears, while training for the last downhill prior to the 2022 Winter Olympics, but she was able to continue competing within a month and, after all but the final race of the season, had such a commanding lead that only one other competitor (Corinne Suter of Switzerland) even had a theoretical possibility of overtaking her. At the finals, Suter failed to score, and Goggia won her second consecutive (and third overall) discipline championship.\nAs noted above, the season was interrupted by the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, China (at the Yanqing National Alpine Skiing Centre in Yanqing District) from 6–19 February 2022. Although the Alpine Skiing branch of the International Ski Federation (FIS) conducts the World Cup and co-organizes the Alpine skiing at the Winter Olympics (along with the International Olympic Committee {IOC)), the Winter Olympics are organized by nation (a maximum of four skiers is permitted per nation), and (after 1968) the Olympic results do not count for World Cup points. Accordingly, the results in the Olympics are highlighted in blue and shown in this table by ordinal position only in each discipline.The women's downhill was held at the \"Rock\" course on 15 February 2022.\nThe World Cup final took place on Wednesday, 16 March in the linked resorts of Courchevel and Méribel, France, which are located in Les Trois Vallées, on the L'Eclipse course at Courchevel. Only the top 25 skiers in the World Cup downhill discipline and the winner of the Junior World Championship, plus athletes who have scored at least 500 points in the World Cup overall classification for the season, are eligible to compete in the final, and only the top 15 earn World Cup points. Because of the close race for the overall title, three athletes with 500+ overall points (Mikaela Shiffrin, Petra Vlhová, and Marta Bassino) entered the final, and one of them (Shiffrin, who had only raced two World Cup downhills all year) won it."

        "text": "The men's parallel competition in the 2022 FIS Alpine Skiing World Cup involved only 1 event, a parallel giant slalom, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The sole event was won by Christian Hirschbühl of Austria, who thus won the season championship. However, because there was only one race, Hirschbühl did not win a crystal globe symbolizing his championship. This specific championship includes both parallel giant slalom and parallel slalom races. At this time, individual parallel races are not included in the season finals.\nThe season was interrupted by the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, China (at the Yanqing National Alpine Skiing Centre in Yanqing District) from 6–20 February 2022. The only parallel competition was a mixed team competition (2 men and 2 women per country), which was held on 20 February 2022."

Between 1971–1975 and in 2000, only one team was selected per year. In 1969–1970, 1976 and 1987, two teams were selected per year. Each team has consisted of between 10 and 25 players at various designated positions.\n, the schools with the most selections all-time are Cherry Creek High School in Greenwood Village, Colorado, Farragut High School in Farragut, Tennessee, Bishop Gorman High School in Las Vegas and Stillwater High School in Stillwater, Oklahoma, with eight apiece. California has had more selections and more than twice as many First Team selections as any other state, with 318 and 142 respectively.\nThirty-two players have been named to the team twice. Bill McGuire of Creighton Preparatory School was the first to accomplish the feat in 1981 and 1982. , Tripp MacKay, Joey Gallo, Jack Flaherty, Jace Bohrofen and Druw Jones are the only players to be named to the First Team twice. \nIn 2001, Casey Kotchman and John Killalea of Seminole High School became the first pair of high school teammates to be named to the First Team in the same year. Scott Kazmir and Clint Everts of Cypress Falls High School accomplished the same feat in the following year. Adrian Cárdenas and Chris Marrero of Monsignor Edward Pace High School followed in 2006.\nTen honorees have gone on to be enshrined in the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum while seven have been inducted into the National College Baseball Hall of Fame. John Elway of Granada Hills High School is enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame and Condredge Holloway of Lee High School is enshrined in the Canadian Football Hall of Fame.\nEighteen selectees have later won a Major League Baseball (MLB) Most Valuable Player Award, nine players have won a Cy Young Award. As highly touted prospects, 23 players have subsequently been selected first overall in the MLB draft and ten have won an MLB Rookie of the Year Award.\nEighteen players named to one of the three teams have played football professionally, including Josh Booty, Chad Hutchinson and Drew Henson who played in both the National Football League and MLB. Ryan Minor of Hammon High School in Hammon, Oklahoma played professional basketball and in MLB. Scott Burrell of Hamden High School is the only honoree to go on to play basketball in the National Basketball Association.\nBefore being sponsored by Rawlings, the team was sponsored by Converse."

        "title": "Mike Ayers (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Michael Ayers (born January 16, 1980) is an American ice hockey coach and former goaltender who was an All-American for New Hampshire.\nCareer.\nAfter graduating from Thayer Academy in 1998, Ayers spent another year playing prep school hockey before ending his junior career with the Dubuque Fighting Saints. Despite playing for the worst team in the USHL that season, Ayers was drafted by the Chicago Blackhawks after the year. That fall, he began attending the University of New Hampshire and served as the team's third goaltender as a freshman. After Ty Conklin left in 2001, Ayers split time in goal with senior Matt Carney and helped the team finish atop the Hockey East standings. The two goalies were platooned through the Hockey East Tournament with Ayers in net for the Wildcats championship game victory. UNH got the top overall seed for the NCAA Tournament and Ayers got in goal for the team's semifinal match. Unfortunately, the team was outplayed by conference rival Maine and Ayers allowed 7 goals on 40 shots.\nFor his junior season, Ayers took over as the primary netminder and produced his best season yet. He set program records for wins, save percentage and shutouts, leading the team to a second consecutive conference title. Ayers backstopped the Wildcats to a conference championship and the team earned the third overall seed. In his second postseason run, Ayers was a clutch player for UNH, allowing 4 goals through three games, and led the program to only its second championship game. Facing down defending champion Minnesota, Ayers turned aside 29 of 30 shots through 40 minutes and had the Wildcats tied with the Gophers. However, the wheels came off in the third. Ayers surrendered three goals in a just over five minute span and New Hampshire lost the game 1–5. Ayers did return for his senior season, but both he and the team declined. While he finished with respectable numbers, they weren't enough to get him back onto the All-American team. New Hampshire did receive a bid to the NCAA Tournament for a third consecutive season, but the team lost its opening match. While the ending was disappointing, Ayers did finish as the program's all-time wins leader (since broken).\nAfter graduating with a degree in kinesiology, Ayers began playing professionally. He spent most of his first season in the ECHL and slowly worked his way up into the AHL. His numbers slid in his third season and he only saw limited minutes before finishing the season in Europe. He returned to the ECHL for one final season before ending his playing career in 2008.\nAyers began his second career after a short time off, becoming the goaltending coach for the Iowa Chops mid-season. He stayed with the team until the end of the year while pulling double-duty as a goaltending director for FHIT, a youth hockey organization in Minnesota. After leaving the Chops, Ayers founded his own goaltending academy, MVP Goaltending. He operated the business for just over two years. In the fall of 2009, he returned to the college ranks as an assistant for St. Cloud State. He attempted to hold three positions simultaneously, but left FHIT in November to focus on the newer positions. He remained an assistant coach and ran his goalie clinic until August 2011 when he joined USA Hockey full time as a goaltending coach. Among other duties, he served as an assistant on the US U-18 teams at the world championships in 2012 and 2013, winning a gold and silver medal respectively.\nIn 2013, he was lured back to college hockey, this time as an assistant for Boston College under Jerry York. Since then, he's helped develop two NHL goaltenders, Thatcher Demko and Spencer Knight. Prior to the 2020 season, Ayers was promoted to Associate Head coach, a position he continues to hold as of 2021."

They lost in the semifinals of the NEC tournament to Mount St. Mary's. Due to the ongoing pandemic, the National Invitation Tournament was modified and, as a result, did not award bids to teams who had won their regular season championship, but failed to qualify for the NCAA tournament. The Seahawks did not receive a bid to the NIT.\nSchedule and results.\nFollowing wins in the first two games of the season, the Seahawks were forced to postpone three consecutive non-conference games due to COVID-19 issues within the program. They returned to play on December 1, but were without head coach Mason and two of their leading scorers.\nNEC COVID-19 policy provided that if a team could not play a conference game due to COVID-19 issues within its program, the game would be declared a forfeit and the other team would receive a conference win.

        "text": "The women's giant slalom World Cup 2021/2022 consisted of 9 events including the final. Overall World Cup leader Mikaela Shiffrin from the United States, who started out in the early lead in this discipline, contracted COVID-19 at the end of 2021 and missed the post-Christmas giant slalom, then Shiffrin lost the lead in this discipline to Sara Hector of Sweden in the first race in 2022. \nAs noted above, the season was interrupted by the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, China (at the Yanqing National Alpine Skiing Centre in Yanqing District) from 6–19 February 2022. Although the Alpine Skiing branch of the International Ski Federation (FIS) conducts the World Cup and co-organizes the Alpine skiing at the Winter Olympics (along with the International Olympic Committee {IOC)), the Winter Olympics are organized by nation (a maximum of four skiers is permitted per nation), and (after 1968) the Olympic results do not count for World Cup points. Accordingly, the results in the Olympics are highlighted in blue and shown in this table by ordinal position only in each discipline. The women's giant slalom was held at the \"Ice River\" course on 7 February 2022.\nHector continued to hold the lead in the discipline into March, as 2017 discipline champion Tessa Worley of France emerged as her main late-season competition. Going into the final, Hector held only a five point lead over Worley. Shiffrin held a huge lead of almost a second after the first run and seemed likely to win the title, but she shockingly melted down in the second run, finishing seventh and handing the season title to Worley.\nThe World Cup final was held on Sunday, 20 March in the linked resorts of Courchevel and Méribel, France, which are located in Les Trois Vallées, on the Roc de Fer course at Méribel. Only the top 25 skiers in the World Cup giant slalom discipline and the winner of the Junior World Championship, plus athletes who have scored at least 500 points in the World Cup overall classification for the season, were eligible to compete in the final, and only the top 15 earned World Cup points."

The sole event was won by Andreja Slokar, who thus won the season championship. Because only one race was run, Slokar will not be awarded a crystal globe for winning this discipline. This specific championship includes both parallel giant slalom and parallel slalom races. At this time, individual parallel races are not included in the season finals.\nThe season was interrupted by the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, China (at the Yanqing National Alpine Skiing Centre in Yanqing District) from 6–20 February 2022. The only parallel competition was a mixed team competition (2 men and 2 women per country), which was held on 20 February 2022."

It was his second Australian Open title and 21st major singles title overall, surpassing the all-time record he had jointly held with Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic. Nadal became the fourth man, after Roy Emerson, Rod Laver, and Djokovic, to achieve the double career Grand Slam, and the second in the Open Era. He also became the first man in the Open Era to win an Australian Open final after losing the first two sets. This marked the third consecutive year a man trailed by two sets in a major final yet rallied to win, following Djokovic's two-set comeback at the 2021 French Open and Dominic Thiem's at the 2020 US Open.\nDjokovic was the three-time reigning champion, but did not compete after his visa was cancelled shortly before the tournament began due to an intervention from Australia's Immigration Minister Alex Hawke, citing risks to public health and good order in Australia. That meant Nadal was the only former champion (2009) to compete in the tournament, with both Federer and Stan Wawrinka sidelined by injury. Djokovic retained the world No. 1 singles ranking despite being unable to defend his points after Medvedev and Alexander Zverev lost in the final and fourth round, respectively.\nMatteo Berrettini became the first man born in the 1990s to reach the quarterfinals at all four majors, and the first Italian man to reach the semifinals of the Australian Open.\nSeeded players.\nThe following are the seeded players. Seedings are based on ATP rankings as of 10 January 2022. Rank and points before are as of 17 January 2022.\nAs a result of pandemic-related adjustments to the ranking system and changes to the ATP Tour calendar in 2020 and 2021, ranking points after the tournament (as of 31 January 2022) were calculated as follows:\nNote that this is a different ranking adjustment system than the one being used by the WTA for the women's event.\n† The player's 2020 points were replaced by his 2022 points, and his 19th best result was replaced by his 2021 points. The 2021 points will be dropped three weeks after the end of the 2022 tournament.\n§ The player was defending points from a 2020 ITF tournament.\nWithdrawn players.\nThe following players would have been seeded, but withdrew before the tournament began.\nDjokovic visa controversy.\nDjokovic lost his ability to compete when his visa to enter Australia was cancelled. Despite being granted a medical exemption to the tournament's COVID-19 vaccine requirement by Tennis Australia, the Australian Border Force confirmed that after being detained at Melbourne Airport for eight hours, Djokovic's visa had been cancelled and he would be denied entry to the country due to not meeting exemption criteria to Australia's vaccination requirements. Djokovic sought an injunction to prevent his deportation. The Federal Circuit and Family Court ruled in favour of Djokovic, ordered his release from detention and directed the federal government to pay his legal expenses. On 14 January Minister for Immigration Alex Hawke used his discretionary power under sections 133C(3) and 116(1)(e)(i) of the \"Migration Act 1958\" to cancel Djokovic's visa on health and good order grounds. Djokovic sought a judicial review against deportation, but three Federal Court of Australia judges unanimously rejected the review on 16 January, preventing him from defending his title.\nOther entry information.\nWildcards.\nSource:\nWithdrawals.\nSources:"

        "title": "Adaptive Standing Tennis",
        "text": "Adaptive Standing Tennis is a form of tennis for individuals with physical disability who play the sport of tennis standing, or ambulatory as opposed to their counterparts who play wheelchair tennis, playing tennis in a wheelchair.\nThe newly emerged form of tennis allows individuals with physical disability the opportunity to choose whether to play tennis ambulatory or in a wheelchair. People who play adaptive standing tennis may have an amputation, cerebral palsy, limb malformations, or hemiplegia. Adaptive standing tennis is also referred to as Para-Standing Tennis (PST), or Tenis Adaptivo de Pie (TAP), meaning stand-up adaptive tennis in Spanish.\nPST is recognized by the International Tennis Federation and is seeking certification from the International Paralympic Committee to be played at tennis grand slams and in the Paralympics.\nHistory.\nThis form of tennis has its organized roots coming from Latin America. Locations in Mexico and South America were the first to begin organizing efforts for tennis tournaments and programming specifically tailored to individuals who qualified to play adaptive standing tennis. The form of tennis became referred to as tenis adaptivo de pie. Translated from Spanish to English as playing from the foot up, or standing adaptive tennis. Tenis Adaptivo de pie is also referred to by the acronym TAP.\nThroughout the years and origin of adaptive sports many individuals began to participate not only for their own interest but for socialization. In 1937, John Poulin of Austria started playing tennis with a lower limb amputation to one of his legs against pedestrians with the aid of crutches. He is considered to be the first known adaptive standing tennis player. Antonio Solano of Mexico, born in 1960, is considered to be the first known person with upper extremity disability, congenital limb malformation or shortened arms, to play tennis adapted standing. \nAs advancements in technology in prosthetics and orthotics has increased over the years, persons with physical disabilities began to compete in tennis tournaments with the aid of prosthetic legs, arms, and orthotic braces. Before being labeled a more organized modality of tennis, several exhibitions and tournaments took place around the world. Today, a growing number of organizers operate a schedule of tournaments around the world.\nTournaments.\nSince adaptive standing tennis was not recognized by governing federations of tennis until 2023, previous tournaments were considered exhibition events.\nThe first organized International adaptive standing tennis tournament took place at the Tres Marias Club in Morelia, Michoacán, Mexico in 2013. Participants from five countries came to compete in the tournament.\nOn December 11-12, 2015 the Master Final TAP was held in Santiago, Chile. The tournament was organized by the TAP Foundation as part of the TAP World Tour. The TAP World Tour is an International tennis circuit for persons who play adaptive standing tennis. Enzo Amadei Jerez and Ana Maria Rodriguez are the founders of the TAP Foundation and TAP World Tour. \nThe United States hosted its first International event with the Inaugural USA TAP Open which was held December 9–11, 2016 in Houston, Texas. The tournament was organized by Cindy Benzon, Jeff Bourns, Harold Graham, Enzo Amadei Jerez, and Ana Maria Rodriguez with support from the United States Tennis Association of Texas. 1987 International Tennis Hall of Fame inductee Dennis Ralston was the honorary tournament ambassador. 28 players from 11 countries around the world came to compete in the inaugural event. The USA TAP Open served as the International Adaptive Standing Tennis World Championships from 2016 until 2019 before being interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Orthotics Prosthetics Activities Foundation (OPAF) was founded by Robin Burton. The foundation held \"first volley\" clinics across the United States in an effort to get people playing tennis. The clinics were for both wheelchair and standing amputee tennis players. OPAF held the first United States based amputee tennis tournament in November 2016. \nThe Carolinas Adaptive Standing Tennis Association (CAST) began to host annual tournaments at Pinetop Tennis Club with the Inaugural CAST Open April 26–28, 2019 in Greensboro, North Carolina. The organization was founded by John Hizer.\nEurope hosted its first international level tournament at the 2018 Malmo Open in Malmo, Sweden. The Malmo Open is Europe's largest para sporting event. The tournament was organized by Harald Von Koch and the organizing staff of the Malmo Open. Europe has since seen expanded growth and development in Para-Standing Tennis. In 2023, the PST Italian Open in Turin featured 30+ athletes from 12 different countries. The tournament singles winners were Brazilian Thalita Rodrigues (PST1-2) and American Danny Scrivano (PST3-4).\nJapan is known to be the first country that created a national incorporated organization, Japan Adaptive Stand-Up Tennis Association (JASTA). The organization was formed in 2019 by Ken Shibatani and Reiko Shibatani."

        "text": "The 1929–30 Clarkson Golden Knights men's ice hockey season was the 10th season of play for the program. The team was coached by Jack Roos in his 1st season.\nSeason.\nAfter three consecutive seasons being one of the best teams in the country, Clarkson had to contend with serious problems at the start of the season. In August, captain-elect William Harrison Heintzman was suffering from a throat infection and had an operation to address the condition. He appeared to recover after surgery and began to train for his senior season but began experiencing complications. His condition worsened and he deteriorated, dying on August 21 at the age of 25. While that tragedy unfolded, the team also had to deal with the loss of Professor Gordon Croskery, the team's head coach, who had left the college after the previous season. Harry Hodge, the school's assistant coach of athletics, was put in charge of the team until a permanent replacement was found. Jack Roos was eventually hired for the job and had a tough task to lead the team after Heintzman death.\nIn Heintzman's memory, no captain was named for the year and the team did well to soldier on. After several exhibition wins in Canada, Clarkson opened the season in Ottawa and played a raucous game against Ashbury, winning 9–6. Upon returning home, the defense recovered its typical form and the team shutout Loyola 2–0. Warm weather forced a game with MIT on 10 January to be rescheduled for early February. After dropping a Ashbury college in a mid-January rematch, the team headed on a trip south. They sandwiched two overwhelming victories around a close loss to Princeton, ending Tech's 10-game winning streak.\nSoft ice against forced the postponement of a game, this time the tilt against St. Lawrence was moved from January 28 until mid-February. Rink conditions improved well enough for the match against McGill to take place. Entering the contest, the Redmen were one of the top teams in Canada and were expected to be a tough challenge for the Knights. 1,500 fans shoed up to Ives Park to watch Tech roll over the visitors and earn their sixth win on the season. Three days later, the team performed a similar feat against the weaker team from MIT and notched their fourth shutout of the season. At the end of the week, Clarkson travelled down to New Haven to take on the top team in the nation, Yale. Tech was able to keep the game close in the first period, but the Elis dominated the second and then closed down all avenues of attack in the final frame. The 1–5 loss signaled that Clarkson still had a ways to go before they could compete for a national championship.\nThe Knights ended their season at home against bitter rival St. Lawrence, demolishing the Saints with a 17–0 victory. Even without the normal center Williams, it was both the most goals scored and largest margin of victory for Tech in the ten years of the program's existence. Wally Easton needed to only make 3 saves in his fifth shutout on the year while 'Peck' Donald and Clarence 'Ike' Houston led the offense to a triumphant win.\nKenneth Armin served as team manager for the season.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "title": "List of Southwestern Athletic Conference baseball champions",
        "text": "This list of Southwestern Athletic Conference baseball champions concerns the overall conference baseball championship of the National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I Southwestern Athletic Conference. The top four finishers in each conference division participate in a two-bracket, double-elimination tournament to determine the overall conference champion; it was most recently played in Birmingham, Alabama, between May 25 and May 29. The winner of the tournament also receives an automatic berth to the NCAA tournament and, since 2019, to the HBCU World Series.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nThe SWAC was established in 1920, and the conference is known to have sponsored baseball as a league sport until around the uncertain times of the Great Depression and World World II before sanctioning it again in 1949 (even early SWAC power Wiley College shut down its baseball program after the 1932 season, despite featuring a rising young star infielder from the Chicago area in Pat Patterson). Between 1959 and 2003, only Southern, Jackson State, and Grambling State won SWAC championships. The league office itself has even been known to refer to these schools as the \"Big Three.\" However, since 2004, seven programs have won championships, suggesting greater competitiveness in the league. Also, with the SWAC tournament now including eight schools, simply more lower-seeded teams have an opportunity to compete for the conference crown.\nDetermining conference champions.\nThough the league championship was normally determined by the regular season conference standings, for the first three seasons after the SWAC had renewed sponsorship of baseball in 1949, a championship series was held; the conference was divided into northern and southern divisions during that time period. In 1977 the league returned to division play—this time with eastern and western divisions (reflecting the changes in conference membership)—with the division winners again facing off in a best-of-three championship series. After the 1980 series featured a fourth consecutive JSU–SU match-up, the series was successfully converted into a more inclusive four-team, double-elimination tournament for the 1981 season, guaranteeing that at least one school that had never won the SWAC title before could compete in it (the four-team field was expanded to six teams in 2000 and eight teams in 2008).\nCurrent status.\nA three-year deal was signed in 2020 to return the tournament to Smith–Wills Stadium in Jackson, Mississippi. However, just two weeks after that agreement was announced, the NCAA canceled all spring championship events for the 2020 season, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Then, less than a month before the 2021 tournament, it was announced that it would be relocated from Jackson to Toyota Field in Madison, Alabama \"due to enhanced COVID-19 protocols.\" The 2022 tournament was split between Regions Field and Jerry D. Young Memorial Field in Birmingham.\nChampions.\nConference championships by year.\nThe following is a list of conference champions, organized by year. The league office apparently does not acknowledge titles earned prior to 1959 in its public releases. It is not immediately clear if this is due to space constraints or poor record-keeping—or if the conference simply does not consider pre-1959 titles as \"official.\" At that time the SWAC began to change significantly with a shift in membership from smaller, private Christian colleges in and around Texas—many of whom are now members of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics's Red River Athletic Conference—to larger, secular public universities spread throughout the Deep South (Grambling and Jackson State were particularly notable additions, especially as far as baseball competition was concerned). Southern also won the NAIA World Series in 1959. The conference began changing demographically at that time as well, with southern universities beginning to integrate."

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Jayhawks represent the University of Kansas in the NCAA's Big 12 Conference.\nKansas began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1898. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Kansas' record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

The team was coached by Gordon Croskery in his 2nd season.\nSeason.\nThere was a good deal of anticipation for the team entering the year, with ice hockey swiftly becoming popular on campus. Unfortunately for Tech, the results on ice could hardly have been worse. The first game against Syracuse happened after only a week of practice, so when the team flagged towards the end of the match there wasn't much concern. The second game against Massena, with Clarkson now playing at home, saw the team pitted against a squad made up mostly of Canadians. Even with a loss, scoring 5 goals showed that the team was at least playing better.\nThe weather became a factor in the third match. Snowy conditions made it almost impossible to move the puck along the ice so there was little that could be taken from their 2–5 loss. Even with all the excuses, Tech was 0–3 going into a big test in the Capital District. Neither Union nor Rensselaer were expected to be very good. RPI in particular had posted a losing record every year since 1907, and were embarrassed more often than not when playing other college teams. Clarkson arrived in Schenectady looking for their first win and instead they got flattened. Union took the first game 1–5 but it was the drubbing by Rensselaer that was surprising. The Cherry and White used their smaller rink to their advantage and walloped the Golden Knights 1–14.\nThe team had two weeks off before their final match, travelling downstate to play Hamilton, but the result was predictable. Because of weather conditions, the two ended up playing 4 periods rather than the standard three, but that hardly mattered for the final score. The Continentals were one of the best teams in the country and they proved as much with a 0–9 win, though Clarkson did perform better than they had in January.\nSmith led the team in scoring with 4 goals.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The 1925–26 Clarkson Golden Knights men's ice hockey season was the 6th season of play for the program. The team was coached by Gordon Croskery in his 3rd season.\nSeason.\nAfter a dismal season the year before, the program had nowhere to go than up. The team lost seven of its nine players to graduation, but that was a blessing in disguise as it allowed professor Croskery to swiftly remake the team. With the temporary on-campus rink not being sufficient, a new venue was built in Ives Park and practice began in earnest immediately after Christmas. 20 men showed up for the start, which was not an inconsiderable number for a school boasting a student body of less than 1,000. The team got in as much practice as they could before heading down to Ithaca for their first match. From the start the team looked much better than it had the year before, skating up and down the ice against Cornell The game was close throughout and Clarkson had a chance to end their losing streak all the way until the end, but ultimately fell 1–2.\nThe second game for tech would be their first at the new rink and they played host to Syracuse. Sensing a chance for the Knights to win, a large crowd of about 1,000 people showed up to the game. They were witness, however, to a masterful performance by the Orange netminder, Beishline, who turned away every Clarkson shot and allowed his team to win 4–0. Nearly two weeks passed before the third game but the extra practice time seemed to spark the Knights offense. Against the Cornwall Greys, an amateur club from Canada, Clarkson debuted their new goalie, John Klube. The team got down 2–5 after two periods but came storming back in the third. Wayland made a name for himself in the game as the Knights' comeback came up just short but the with the team playing much better it was only a matter of time before they finally won a game.\nThe finally happened against the Winter Park Club from Ogdensburg. Even when they were missing their normal center, Jack Croskery, Tech ended their 10-game losing streak one day shy of the 2-year anniversary of their last win. Warm weather melted the ice for their next game, the first in program history against local college St. Lawrence. The Larries were fielding a varsity team for the first time and Clarkson welcomed them with an ice surface that was little better than a pond. Wayland was again the star for the team in their 1–0 win.\nClarkson ended its 4-game home stand and headed down to play Hamilton, who were having another strong season. The Knights were keen to improve on their 0–9 loss from a year before and did just that, scoring 5 times against the Continentals. Unfortunately, Tech couldn't pull away from Hamilton and ended up losing the match in overtime. Clarkson ended the year with a pair of game, the first a rematch with St. Lawrence on their rink. The change of venue didn't alter the result, however, and Clarkson won the game despite it devolving into a physical contest. The final game came against the Junior Chamber of Commerce team at Watertown and got a strong effort from their opposition. The game was close for the first half of the match, with Watertown twice taking a lead, but Clarkson proved stronger as the game went on and outpaced their opposition in the later half.\nThe vast improvement of the team over the course of the season, particularly since most of the players would be back next year, signaled good fortune for the Golden Knights in the near future.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The Alaska–Alaska Anchorage men's ice hockey rivalry is a college ice hockey rivalry between the Alaska Nanooks men's ice hockey and Alaska Anchorage Seawolves men's ice hockey programs. The first meeting between the two occurred on November 16, 1979.\nHistory.\nAlaska, originally Alaska Agricultural College, began playing ice hockey in 1925. However, due to being so far away from any other college team, the program had difficulty finding opponents. This was a contributing factor in the school suspending its ice hockey program several times over the next 50 years. Alaska Anchorage, with assistance of head coach Brush Christiansen, promoted its ice hockey program to varsity status in 1979. A year later Alaska, then Alaska–Fairbanks, followed suit. The two programs were able to stabilize one another by providing a consistent opponent and allowing each team to steadily improve. Due to their proximity and the sheer number of times they played one another in the 1980 it would have almost been impossible for the two programs to not have become rivals.\nIn 1984, both programs were promoted to Division I status when the entire Division II level collapsed. A year later they joined with two teams from the lower-48 to form the Great West Hockey Conference. The experiment lasted just three years but it did give the two Alaska schools a greater profile in college hockey and eventually led to both joining other more established conferences. When Alaska Anchorage joined the WCHA in 1993, it caused the number of meeting between the two schools to drop but they continued to play one another each season. In order to continue the relevance of the rivalry, the 93–94 season was the inaugural year that the Governor's Cup was awarded.\nIn the interim, Alaska joined the CCHA and remained with the league for 19 years until it was dissolved in 2013. Alaska then joined the WCHA and the two programs became conference rivals once more. In 2010s, with Alaska facing an economic downturn, there were rumors that the two programs would be merged to reduce the cost of operating both programs. While this plan never came to fruition, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a financial crisis for both clubs. Alaska was able to survive the troubles but in 2020, Alaska Anchorage announced that the 2020–21 season would be their last. In the end, the pandemic forced the Seawolves to cancel the campaign and suspend operations in November.\nFundraising efforts did eventually succeed in allowing Alaska Anchorage to announce its return for the 22–23 season. While both teams will likely be playing one another soon, neither is a member of a conference and their long-term viability has yet to be settled.\nGame results.\nFull game results for the rivalry, with rankings beginning in the 1998–99 season."

The Russian Volleyball Federation is the Official governing body for this sport After the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the International Volleyball Federation stripped Russia of hosting the men's World Cup in August 2022.\nHistory.\nDevelopment of volleyball in Russia.\nVolleyball began to develop widely in Russia in 1920–1921 in the Middle Volga (Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod). Then it appeared in the Far East in Khabarovsk and Vladivostok, and in 1925 in Ukraine. At that time volleyball was jokingly referred to as \"the actors game\" in Ukraine.
