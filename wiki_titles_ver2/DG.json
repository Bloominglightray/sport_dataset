        "text": "Mount Kilimanjaro () is a dormant volcano in the United Republic of Tanzania, 5,895 meters (19,341 ft) above sea level. \nThere are several routes by which to reach Kibo, or Uhuru Peak, the highest summit of Mount Kilimanjaro, namely: Marangu, Rongai, Lemosho, Shira, Umbwe and Machame.\nBeing one of the most popular mountains in the world, roughly 50,000 trekkers every year try to reach the summit of Mt Kilimanjaro. According to research published by the Climb Kilimanjaro Guide, the average summit success rate across all climbers and routes is 65%. However, summit success rate heavily depends upon what route is climbed, as routes vary considerably in terms of acclimatization profile and duration of the climb. \nTrekking routes.\nKilimanjaro has a number of official climbing routes. These are:\nNorthern Circuit,\nMachame,\nMarangu,\nRongai,\nLondorossi Lemosho,\nUmbwe,\nShira, and\nMweka (descent only).\nMarangu Route.\nThe Marangu Route (also known as the \"Coca-Cola\" route) is the easiest ascent of Kilimanjaro. Climbs can be done over 6 days. It crosses \"The Saddle\", a wide, high-altitude, semi-desert that separates craggy Mawenzi from the main summit Kibo. From the summit, glaciers, screes, cliffs, afro-alpine moorland, and forests lead down to the cultivated foothills.\nThe Marangu route is a favorite of local tour operators as it is the shortest route and requires no camping gear to be carried. For this reason, it is often the cheapest option. Because of its short profile, the Marangu route has the lowest summit success rate out of any route.\nTrekkers sometimes spend an extra day to acclimate to the altitude at Horombo Hut. Also, trekkers often start the final ascent to Uhuru Peak early from Kibo Hut, because the scree is easier to climb when frozen, and they get a dawn view from the crater rim.\nRoute Outline"

        "text": "John C. Odom (January 6, 1982 – November 5, 2008) was a minor league baseball right-handed pitcher notable for being traded for ten baseball bats while playing in the independent Golden Baseball League in May 2008. Before his stint in the Golden Baseball League, Odom played baseball at Tallahassee Community College and in the minor-league system of the San Francisco Giants.\nBecause of the trade, Odom was known to fans as \"Bat Man\", \"Bat Guy\" and \"Bat Boy.\" Odom left baseball three weeks after the trade, and he died of an accidental drug overdose a few months later.\nEarly life.\nOdom, 6-foot-2, described himself as a \"lost youth.\" He was kicked off of his high school baseball team in Roswell, Georgia. He then played two seasons for the Tallahassee Community College baseball team, going 6-1 with a 2.75 ERA in . In , he was drafted in the 44th round by the San Francisco Giants.\nCareer.\nOdom played for the Giants' affiliates Salem Keizer Volcanoes in and , and the Augusta Greenjackets in . He missed most of the 2005 season because of a right elbow injury, having Tommy John surgery in June 2005. He did not play in due to a dislocated left shoulder. In three seasons and 140.1 career innings in the Giants' farm system, Odom compiled a 3.98 ERA and averaged 7.35 strikeouts per nine innings. He was minor league teammates with Tim Lincecum and Kevin Frandsen.\nThe trade.\nThe Giants released Odom during spring training . He then signed in May with the Calgary Vipers of the Golden Baseball League, but a mark on his criminal record, a 1999 conviction for aggravated assault when he was a minor, prevented his entry into Canada. The Vipers offered Odom to the Laredo Broncos for a Bronco player, but that player refused to move to Calgary. The Broncos then offered $1000 cash for Odom, but the Vipers felt cash deals made the team appear financially unstable. The teams then came to an agreement on May 20 to exchange Odom for ten Prairie Sticks maple bats, worth a total of $665.\nIn Laredo, they called him \"Bat man\", and played the Batman Theme when he took the mound. After a bad outing on June 5 in Amarillo, Texas, the heckling from fans and even an umpire was more than he could handle. Although his following outing in San Angelo on June 10 went well, he decided to leave the team.\nDeath.\nOn November 5, 2008 Odom died of an accidental overdose from heroin, methamphetamine, benzylpiperazine and alcohol. It was election night, and Odom's family said that he had gone out partying that night. Dan Shwam, Odom's former Broncos manager, suggests the media and fan response to the trade \"drove him back to the bottle, that it put him on the road to drugs again.\"\nThe ten bats that the Vipers received for Odom were never used, and the Vipers planned to auction them off for charity, but Ripley's Believe It or Not! purchased them for $10,000."

        "title": "Matt Joyce (baseball)",
        "text": "Matthew Ryan Joyce (born August 3, 1984) is an American former professional baseball outfielder, who played 14 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB). Between 2008 and 2021, he played for eight MLB teams, most notably the Tampa Bay Rays, with whom he was named an MLB All-Star in 2011.\nRaised by a single father in Tampa, Florida, Joyce frequently attended Rays games at Tropicana Field as a child. The Detroit Tigers attended an exhibition game that Joyce played with Florida Southern College and selected him in the 12th round of the 2005 MLB Draft. Joyce debuted with the Tigers in 2008 and was traded to the Rays the following season. After five years in St. Petersburg, Florida, Joyce was traded to the Los Angeles Angels, where his performance suffered after a 2015 concussion.\nAfter stints with the Pittsburgh Pirates, Oakland Athletics, and Atlanta Braves, as well as minor-league appearances for the Cleveland Indians and San Francisco Giants, Joyce signed a one-year deal with the Miami Marlins in 2020. There, he helped Miami reach their first Major League Baseball postseason appearance since 2003. Joyce retired from professional baseball after a stint with the Philadelphia Phillies in 2021, becoming a sports analyst for the Rays.\nEarly life.\nMatthew Ryan Joyce was born in Tampa, Florida to Matthew Ryan Joyce Sr. and Vallie Klein. When Matt Jr. and his sister Danielle were youngsters, their mother, Vallie, who was dealing with substance abuse problems, left the children's father and took the rest of the family to New Jersey. Matt Sr. obtained a court order to reclaim his children, and raised Matt and Danielle as a single father, with the help of Vallie's mother, Patricia Klein. Joyce's father encouraged his son to learn baseball, helping with backyard batting practice and giving his son the nickname \"Slugger\" at the age of 10.\nA childhood fan of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays of Major League Baseball (MLB), Joyce frequently attended home games at Tropicana Field. His favorite Ray was Fred McGriff, while his overall favorite baseball player was Ken Griffey Jr. Joyce's baseball career began with the North Brandon Little League in Brandon, Florida. He went on to attend Armwood High School in Seffner, Florida, where he described his athletic performance as not \"too ridiculous as far as being that far above everybody.\" Joyce was the second Armwood baseball player to play in MLB, following left-handed pitcher Sterling Hitchcock, and Armwood retired his No. 24 jersey in February 2009.\nCollege career.\nAlthough Joyce received offers to play college baseball for the University of Tampa and the University of South Florida, he chose to attend Florida Southern College, who offered him an opportunity to begin playing as a freshman. As a sophomore in 2005, Joyce earned All-Sunshine State Conference honors and helped lead Florida Southern to their ninth NCAA Division II title.\nThe Detroit Tigers took notice of Joyce when they played an exhibition game against Florida Southern during spring training in 2005. That year, the Tigers selected Joyce in the 12th round of the 2005 MLB Draft, and he signed with the team shortly afterwards. In three seasons with Florida Southern, Joyce hit 22 home runs and had 121 runs batted in (RBIs) in 170 games. Statistically, his best season was as a freshman in 2003, when he batted .329 with eight home runs, 44 RBIs, and 13 stolen bases. Florida Southern retired Joyce's No. 24 jersey in January 2018.\nMinor league career.\nAfter being drafted in the 12th round of the 2005 MLB draft by the Detroit Tigers, Joyce spent the 2005 season with the Class A Short Season Oneonta Tigers of the New York–Penn League. There, he lived at a dormitory at Hartwick College, in the same hall as Burke Badenhop and Will Rhymes, all of whom would remain teammates as they moved through the Tigers' farm system. He played 65 games with Oneonta that season, batting .332 and recording four home runs and 46 RBIs in 247 at bats.\nThe following year, Joyce was promoted to the Class A West Michigan Whitecaps. He struggled in the jump to Class A; by mid-May, his batting average had fallen under .200, and he had suffered an injury to his quadriceps. Manager Matt Walbeck told Joyce to focus on changing his mindset as he approached the plate rather than working on his physical ability, and Joyce credits this mental approach to his improvement over the course of the season. He finished 2006 with a .258 average and 11 home runs, and led the team with 86 RBIs. The Whitecaps went on to win the Midwest League championship. In 2013, fans voted Joyce onto the Whitecaps All-Time Team, and in 2019, he was inducted into the Whitecaps Hall of Fame.\nJoyce was promoted to the Double A Erie SeaWolves in 2007, and once again suffered an early-season slump. By May 19, his batting average had sunk to .168. He had recovered by the end of the season, finishing with a .257 average, 17 home runs, and 70 RBIs in 456 at bats and 130 games. Joyce, along with fellow outfielder Clete Thomas, was considered a likely future major leaguer. Commenting on the two, Tigers general manager Dave Dombrowski remarked that, \"We think they're both prospects... We're not counting on them for this year, but they've got a chance to play at the Triple-A level (this season), depending on how they do this spring.\"\nMajor league career.\nDetroit Tigers (2008).\nJoyce began the 2008 season with the Triple A Toledo Mud Hens, with whom he hit .299 with five home runs and 21 RBIs in the team's first 28 games. After outfielder Jacque Jones was designated for assignment in early May, Joyce was called up to the Tigers in his stead. He made his major league debut on May 5, 2008, starting in right field for a 6–3 loss to the Boston Red Sox. His first major league home run followed shortly after, in a 5–2 loss to the New York Yankees on May 10. Joyce told reporters that he initially did not think he had hit a home run, as he saw Yankees outfielder Bobby Abreu running for the ball, but \"[t]hen I heard the crowd start cheering, so I knew it had gone out.\"\nAfter a strong first impression, Joyce began to struggle with hitting against curveballs and changeups. Joyce believed that he was putting too much effort into impressing the major league coaches. He was optioned back to Toledo at the end of May to make room for outfielder Marcus Thames. He returned to the Tigers on June 29 when Magglio Ordóñez was placed on the disabled list with a pulled oblique, remaining in the lineup even after Ordóñez returned. Joyce was named the American League (AL) Player of the Week on July 19. He was the first rookie position player for the Tigers to win the award since Tony Clark in 1996. In his rookie season, Joyce batted .252 in 92 games with the Tigers and .270 in 56 games with the Mud Hens.\nDuring the offseason, Joyce played for the Águilas de Mexicali of the Mexican Pacific League. He batted .295 in 35 games with Mexicali, striking out less against curveballs.\nTampa Bay Rays (2009–2014).\nOn December 10, 2008, the Tigers traded Joyce to the Tampa Bay Rays in exchange for pitcher Edwin Jackson. Although Joyce missed time in spring training due to tendinitis in his leg, he was named to the Rays' Opening Day roster after B. J. Upton sustained a shoulder injury. On April 9, Joyce hit his first major league home run, a solo shot off of Daisuke Matsuzaka in the second inning of a 4–3 victory over the Boston Red Sox. When Upton returned from the disabled list on April 13, Joyce was optioned to the Triple-A Durham Bulls. Joyce played only three games with the Rays in his first major-league call-up, and his only hit in 10 at bats was the home run against Matsuzaka. In the minor leagues, Joyce helped the Bulls capture the Triple-A National Championship in a 5–4 victory over the Memphis Redbirds. He batted .273 in Triple-A, with 16 home runs and 66 RBIs in 111 games.\nJoyce missed the first half of the Ray's 2010 season after injuring his elbow during spring training. He returned to the team on June 25, and the Rays optioned catcher Dioner Navarro to make room in the lineup. In his first game upon returning, Edwin Jackson, for whom Joyce had been traded, pitched a no-hitter against the Rays. Later that season, on July 27, Joyce hit a grand slam in the sixth inning of Matt Garza's no-hitter against the Tigers. His home run was also the first hit of the game, against Detroit starting pitcher Max Scherzer. It was the second grand slam of his career, following an eighth-inning blast against the Minnesota Twins on July 3. He batted .241 for the season, with 10 runs and 40 RBIs in 216 at bats. Joyce also appeared in the 2010 American League Division Series (ALDS), against the Texas Rangers. His pop fly in Game 4 allowed Carlos Peña to score, brought the Rays back from a 2–1 series deficit, and forced a deciding Game 5. The Rangers went on to take the series, breaking a 39-year postseason drought. In nine postseason at bats, Joyce hit .222, with two hits and one stolen base.\nAfter a lukewarm spring training performance, Joyce found his stride in 2011, leading the league with a .370 batting average by June 1. He received his first All-Star Game selection that season, alongside fellow Rays James Shields and David Price. He cooled a bit after the All-Star break, finishing the season with a .277 average, 19 home runs, and 75 RBIs. The Rays spent the final part of a season deadlocked with the Red Sox in the Wild Card race. On the final day of the regular season, a three-run home run from Joyce helped the Rays clinch a Wild Card berth, leading to a series against the Yankees. The Rays once again lost to the Rangers at the 2011 ALDS in a 3–1 series. Joyce appeared in all four games, where he batted .200 and scored one home run and four RBIs. Rays manager Andrew Friedman quickly signed Joyce to a one-year, $499,500 contract over the offseason.\nJoyce hit his third career grand slam on May 19, 2012, in the third inning of a 5–2 game against the Atlanta Braves. In June, Joyce was placed on the 15-day disabled list with an oblique strain, with recent acquisition Ben Zobrist taking his place in the outfield. Joyce's injury, combined with an extended absence from Evan Longoria, caused a downturn in the Rays' season. By the time that Joyce returned, the Rays had lost 19 of their last 30 contests and had sacrificed their lead in the AL East to the Yankees. Joyce missed 23 games before returning on July 17, and Rhymes was optioned to Durham to make room on the roster. Joyce batted .241 for the season, with 17 home runs and 59 RBIs in 124 games.\nThe Rays avoided arbitration with Joyce going into the 2013 season, agreeing to a one-year, $2.45 million contract. In the second game of the season, Joyce recorded his first walk-off home run against Tommy Hunter of the Baltimore Orioles, winning the game 8–7. The following month, he hit a two-RBI double in the ninth inning of a game against the same team, helping the Rays win 10–6, and breaking the Orioles' 109-game winning streak when leading after seven innings. Overall, Friedman described Joyce's 2013 performance as \"up-and-down ... where there were a couple hot months and a couple months where he struggled more.\" He hit .235 with 18 home runs and 47 RBIs in 481 plate appearances. Going into the 2013 ALDS against the Red Sox, Joyce was in an offensive slump, hitting .089 in the final 21 games of the regular season. Joyce continued his slump into the playoffs, going 0 for 8 in the four-game series.\nJoyce's contract increased in his second year of arbitration, as he agreed to a one-year, $4.7 million deal with the Rays in 2014. He remained in the outfielder and designated hitter rotation alongside David DeJesus, Desmond Jennings, and Wil Myers. After a slow start to the season, in which he hit no home runs for over a month, Joyce tied Rays franchise records with five hits and 12 total bases when he hit two home runs in a 12–7 win against the Orioles on June 29. The game came just over a week after Joyce gained some notoriety for hitting a ball back into a pitching machine during batting practice. Joyce had another productive season in 2014, hitting .254 with nine home runs, but a projected raise to $5 million and steep outfield competition from Jennings, Myers, DeJesus, and Kevin Kiermaier, made the Rays seek to trade him at the conclusion of the year.\nLos Angeles Angels of Anaheim (2015).\nOn December 14, 2014, the Rays traded Joyce to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in exchange for right-handed reliever Kevin Jepsen. The Angels were interested in having Joyce serve as their primary designated hitter. On February 10, 2015, Joyce signed a one-year, $4.75 million contract with the Angels.\nEarly in the 2015 season, Joyce was scratched from a game against the Toronto Blue Jays after arriving late to batting practice. He was later fined by the MLB. He told the \"Los Angeles Times\" that he assumed the Monday game was at night and not in the early afternoon, and he worried that the mistake would cause friction with manager Mike Scioscia. Troubles continued to follow Joyce, who sustained a concussion after colliding with shortstop Erick Aybar in the fourth inning of a 13–7 victory over the Texas Rangers on July 26. Although he was eligible to leave the concussion list seven days later, Joyce continued to suffer from residual headaches and whiplash after the injury. He appeared in only six games in the month of September, and his final hit of the season was on July 9. Joyce batted .174 in 2015, with 43 hits, 21 RBIs, and five home runs in 247 at bats. At the conclusion of the 2015 season, Joyce became a free agent.\nPittsburgh Pirates (2016).\nOn February 20, 2016, the Pittsburgh Pirates signed Joyce to a minor league deal, including an invitation to spring training and a chance to make the major league roster. Throughout spring training, he was in competition with Sean Rodriguez and Jake Goebbert for a bench position as the Pirates' fourth outfielder.\nJoyce had a career revival with the Pirates, hitting .360 with five home runs and 15 RBIs in his first 40 games. Although he was rarely used as an outfielder, Joyce established himself as an effective pinch hitter. In addition to setting an all-time single-season MLB record for pinch-hit walks with 21 in 81 plate appearances, Joyce led all pinch hitters that season in RBIs with 15 and tied for first with four home runs. He finished the season with a .242 average in 293 plate appearances. Joyce became a free agent at the conclusion of the season.\nOakland Athletics (2017–2018).\nJoyce signed a two-year, $11 million deal with the Oakland Athletics on November 30, 2016. He had an uneven start to the season, batting around .200 until the start of June, at which point he improved to a .250 average and a .429 on-base percentage. On June 4, Joyce hit a grand slam against Shawn Kelley in the ninth inning of a game against the Washington Nationals. Although Joyce's hit helped the Athletics to rally, they were unable to complete the comeback, and lost the game 11–10. Although his offensive performance was strong, Joyce struggled in the outfield; his .973 fielding percentage was the lowest for any Athletics outfielder since Chris Singleton in 2003, and his seven errors were the most by any Oakland right fielder since Ruben Sierra in 1994. Most egregiously, on May 28, Joyce committed an error that allowed the New York Yankees to load the bases, paving the way for slugger Aaron Judge's first career grand slam.\nOn August 5, 2017, Joyce received a two-game suspension without pay after using a homophobic slur against a fan in the eighth inning of a game against the Angels. Joyce apologized the following day, and the A's donated $54,000 from Joyce's salary to PFLAG, an organization for families of LGBTQ+ individuals. He additionally clarified in a statement that the outburst had been motivated by a fan saying \"vulgar and obscene words\" about Joyce and his family, and that he \"fully support[s] and hope[s] to help the LGBTQ community with their efforts in being treated fairly.\" Joyce finished the season with a .243 average with 25 home runs and 68 RBIs in 469 at bats.\nJoyce's 2018 season with the A's was hampered by a recurrent lumbar strain. He was first placed on the disabled list for the injury on June 6, and returned to the lineup on June 22 after completing a rehab assignment with the Nashville Sounds. He returned to the disabled list again on July 7 with the same injury, and said that the pain had been bothering him for most of the season, and no one moment was responsible for this recurrence. His recovery process was repeatedly set back; Joyce did not begin rehab assignments until late August, and he was reactivated on September 1 when MLB rosters expanded. Appearing in only 83 games, Joyce batted .208 for the season, including seven home runs and 15 RBIs. He became a free agent at the conclusion of the season.\nAtlanta Braves (2019).\nJoyce signed a minor league contract with the Cleveland Indians on February 8, 2019, with an invitation to spring training. He was released from the team in mid-March, and signed another minor-league deal with the San Francisco Giants on March 20, 2019. On March 23, the Giants traded Joyce to the Atlanta Braves in exchange for cash considerations. Joyce served primarily as a pinch hitter for the team until August 13, when right fielder Nick Markakis suffered a broken wrist. When Markakis returned to the lineup in September, the Braves decided to keep Joyce in right field and shift Markakis to left. Joyce batted .295 for the season in 238 plate appearances, with seven home runs and 23 RBIs.\nMiami Marlins (2020).\nA free agent in the 2019–20 offseason, Joyce signed a one-year, $1.5 million contract with the Miami Marlins on February 3, 2020. Joyce contracted COVID-19 shortly before the Marlins' second summer training camp begun, and, although he was cleared for play prior to Opening Day, he was assigned to the team's alternate site to prepare for live pitching. The Marlins were forced to temporarily pause their 2020 season due to an outbreak of COVID-19 within the team, and when they returned to play, Joyce had been added to the active roster. Playing in 37 of the 60 games in the pandemic-shortened 2020 MLB season, Joyce recorded a .252 average, with 32 hits, 14 RBIs, and two home runs in 127 plate appearances.\nOn October 2, Joyce threw out Willson Contreras of the Chicago Cubs in the fourth inning of the final game of the 2020 National League Wild Card Series. In the seventh inning, Joyce hit a double, and his pinch runner Lewis Brinson scored off of an RBI single from Magneuris Sierra. These two plays helped the Marlins win the game 2–0 and advance to the postseason for the first time in 17 years. The Marlins were later swept by the Braves in the 2020 National League Division Series (NLDS). Joyce took the final out of the series, a line drive to right field that was caught by Cristian Pache. In five postseason games with the Marlins, Joyce recorded two hits and one RBI. Joyce became a free agent after the season.\nPhiladelphia Phillies (2021).\nOn February 10, 2021, Joyce and Marlins teammate Brandon Kintzler signed minor-league deals with the Philadelphia Phillies. Both players were named to the 40-man roster on March 26. On June 1, Joyce hit a grand slam against Cincinnati Reds infielder Alex Blandino, who had stepped in to pitch, taking the Phillies to a 17–3 lead. Joyce suffered a strained lower back in mid-June, and was placed on the injured list on June 19, with Matt Vierling called up in his place. On July 30, he was transferred from the 10-day to the 60-day injured list. Joyce was designated for assignment at the end of September and released into free agency on September 28, the final week of the MLB regular season. He batted just .091 for the year, with two home runs and seven RBIs in 55 at bats.\nRetirement and post-playing career.\nAfter the disruptions caused by the 2021-22 MLB lockout, Joyce did not receive any contract offers from MLB teams. He received an invitation to play in an independent baseball league, which he ultimately rejected, choosing to retire instead. Joyce finished his career with a lifetime .242 batting average in 1,400 games across 14 major league seasons, recording 149 home runs, 898 hits, and 503 RBI in the process.\nIn 2023, Joyce joined Bally Sports Sun as a part-time sports analyst for his former team, the Tampa Bay Rays.\nPlaying style.\nBeginning in 2016, Joyce operated primarily as a pinch hitter rather than a position player. The transition was successful: he led all active MLB pinch hitters with 40 hits and 70 total bases from 2017 through 2020, tying for first with seven home runs. A left-handed batter, most of his plate appearances during this period were against right-handed pitchers, against whom he had an .818 on-base plus slugging (OPS) since the 2016 season. As his batting improved over the course of his major league career, Joyce told MLB.com that he would watch YouTube videos of performances from Barry Bonds, Ken Griffey Jr., Jose Bautista, and Robinson Cano to understand what made each player successful behind the plate. While his mechanics were consistently strong throughout his MLB career, Joyce occasionally struggled with timing at the plate. During a decline in his productivity at Anaheim, Scioscia, the manager at the time, encouraged Joyce to think of \"a concept like driving the ball up the middle or to left center\" rather than focusing on physical mechanics of batting.\nPersonal life.\nIn December 2018, Joyce and his wife, Brittany, alongside business partner Blair Johnson, purchased the rights to five F45 Training fitness franchises, the first of which opened in New Tampa in May 2020. He also works as a real estate investor."

The winner of the tournament receives the MAC's automatic bid to the NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament. As of the next MAC tournament in 2021, the top eight teams in conference play will qualify for the tournament.\nFormat.\nOn May 12, 2020, the MAC announced a series of changes to its competitive format in multiple sports in response to fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic; these changes took effect in the 2020–21 school year and will remain in place through at least 2023–24. With respect to men's and women's basketball, the MAC abandoned its divisional format for a single league table, increased the conference schedule from 18 to 20 games, and reduced the conference tournament field to 8. All qualifying teams will continue to play at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse in Cleveland, and the men's and women's tournaments will continue to run concurrently.\nThrough the 2020 edition, canceled in progress due to COVID-19, the tournament involved all 12 conference members. In 2019 and 2020, the top four seeds received byes into the quarterfinals; all other teams started play in the first round at campus sites. The survivors of these games joined the top four seeds in Cleveland for the remainder of the tournament. This structure was used in the MAC men's tournament from 2016 to 2020.\nFrom 2012 to 2018, the No. 1 and 2 seeds earned a \"double-bye\" to the semifinals, with the No. 3 and 4 seeds beginning tournament play in the quarterfinals. Teams seeded 5–12 had to play an additional two rounds, beginning with campus-site games in the first round. All other games were at the venue now known as Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse, which has served as the regular host for the men's tournament since 2000. When the MAC adopted this format, it abandoned a former practice of awarding the top two seeds to its divisional winners. Teams were (and still are) seeded based on conference record, regardless of their place in their division — though no division champion was seeded lower than fourth.\nIn the previous tournament format, teams were seeded per division by conference record using a series of specified tiebreakers when necessary. The top two seeds in each division received byes into the quarterfinals.\nStarting in 2021 only the top eight teams qualify and the entire tournament has been played in Cleveland."

        "text": "Tom Willis (born 20 April 1979 in Dunedin, New Zealand) is a former New Zealand international rugby union player who played in the hooker position.\nPlaying career.\nNew Zealand.\nWillis made his provincial debut for Otago in 1999 and his Super Rugby debut for the Highlanders the following year, but found playing time difficult to come by in the same sides as incumbent All Black hooker Anton Oliver and fellow rising star Andrew Hore.\nInjury to Oliver saw Willis finally see a starting role for the Highlanders in the 2002 Super 12 season, and he impressed enough that he was starting Tri Nations games for the All Blacks following the campaign. However, with Oliver back healthy Willis again found himself on the reserve bench for both the 2003 Super Rugby and NPC seasons. Despite a lack of playing time, he still managed to show his substantial ability in limited minutes - in the 2003 NPC he scored 5 tries despite making only 2 starts in 9 total appearances.\nFollowing the 2003 provincial season, Willis transferred to Waikato and the Chiefs in a bid to get more consistent playing time. However, shortly thereafter he suffered complications following a back injury, which forced him out of rugby for over a year.\nAfter missing the entire 2005 Super 12 season, Willis returned to hold down the starting position at hooker for the Chiefs for another three seasons through 2008.\nHowever, it was as captain of Waikato that he achieved his greatest triumphs, as he led the province to the 2006 Air New Zealand Cup championship as well as a Ranfurly Shield triumph over North Harbour in 2007.\nEurope.\nOn 23 April 2008, Willis confirmed he was joining Welsh Celtic League side Newport Gwent Dragons for the following European season.\nAfter arriving in Wales, he was quickly appointed team captain and made 25 appearances in his first season for the club.\nWillis retired from rugby in January 2012 due to injury.\nInternational Play.\nWillis was first selected to the All Blacks for their end of year tour in 2001, where he made starts - and was named team captain - against Ireland A and Scotland A. However, neither of these contests were considered test matches.\nAfter a strong 2002 Super 12 season, he was again selected to the All Blacks for that year's domestic and Tri Nations tests. He made his test debut on 8 June 2002, starting in a 64–10 win over Italy in Hamilton. He would go on to make another four appearances for New Zealand that year.\nHowever, these would be his final international appearances. Injury ruled him out of the 2002 end of year tour, and he was left off the 2003 Rugby World Cup squad. His long injury layoff in 2004-2005 would then ultimately serve to permanently end his international career."

It aired on ABC from December 26, 1948, to October 30, 1949, and on DuMont from November 13, 1949, to April 9, 1950.\nThe series aired from Rego Park Lanes in Queens, New York. The original commentators were Jimmy Powers and Al Cirillo. When the show moved to DuMont, Joe Hasel took over as host. Cirillo also produced the program. Other hosts included Russ Hodges and Bill Slater.\nEach episode of \"Bowling Headliners\" had two nationally known professional bowlers competing as part of a found-robin elimination tournament. An audience-participation feature invited viewers to send letters about their bowling abilities. Each week two letter-writers were selected to compete against two members of the audience at the bowling alley in three-frame matches with prizes available.\\\nEdelbrew Brewery Inc. of Brooklyn signed a contract in January 1949 to sponsor a 15-minute segment of \"Bowling Headliners\" on four of ABC's eastern stations. It was the show's first sponsor. In March 1949, the program lost what would have been another beer sponsorship. The New York State Liquor Authority canceled a contract that would have added Ballantine as a sponsor. The authority cited the bowling alley's selling of Ballantine, saying that the proposed advertising would amount to subsidizing the alley's operations. Officials of the alley and Ballantine proposed stopping sales there, but the authority did not change its decision.\nThe show was featured on the cover of the October 29, 1949, \"TV Guide\" when the magazine was still a local publication from New York City.\nThe series is believed to be lost."

A total of 18 players from 7 nations competed in the event, which was held from 16 to 24 August 1920 at the Beerschot Tennis Club. The event was won by Suzanne Lenglen of France, defeating Dorothy Holman of Great Britain in the final. It was the second consecutive victory for a French woman, with Marguerite Broquedis winning the pre-war 1912 tournament. Kathleen McKane Godfree of Great Britain defeated Sigrid Fick of Sweden in the bronze-medal match.\nLenglen's victory was comprehensive, as she lost only 4 games in her 5 matches (1 to Fick in the semifinals, 3 to Holman in the final).\nBackground.\nThis was the fourth appearance of the women's singles tennis. A women's event was held only once during the first three Games (only men's tennis was played in 1896 and 1904), but has been held at every Olympics for which there was a tennis tournament since 1908. Tennis was not a medal sport from 1928 to 1984, though there were demonstration events in 1968 and 1984.\nFrance's Suzanne Lenglen was the \"dominant women's player in the world, and considered by some as the greatest female player of all time.\" She highlighted a strong field, including top British players Dorothy Holman and Kathleen McKane Godfree. Absent were Molla Mallory (a bronze medalist for Norway in 1912 who had emigrated to the United States; in 1921, she would be the only woman to beat Lenglen post-war), Dorothea Douglass Lambert Chambers of Great Britain (the 1908 Olympic gold medalist and seven-time Wimbledon winner, who had reached the Wimbledon finals in 1919 and 1920, losing both to Lenglen), and Elizabeth Ryan of the United States (long-time doubles partner of Lenglen, who would reach the 1921 Wimbledon singles final against her).\nBelgium, Denmark, and Italy each made their debut in the event. France and Great Britain each made their third appearance, tied for most among nations to that point.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition was a single-elimination tournament with a bronze-medal match. All matches were best-of-three sets."

The special election was held due to some ineligible players having received votes in the prior year's balloting, and the BBWAA wanting \"to give those eligible every opportunity\" to be selected.\nIn this year's voting, the BBWAA did not elect anyone on the first ballot. In a second (runoff) election, Red Ruffing received the most votes, resulting in his election to the Hall of Fame. Had this year's special election not been held, Ruffing would have been ineligible for selection by the writers in 1968, as he last played in 1947 and would have exceeded the 20-year eligibility limit. BBWAA rules were subsequently updated to return to annual voting, while eliminating runoff ballots.\nThe Veterans Committee met in closed sessions to consider executives, managers, umpires, and earlier major league players. It selected two people, Branch Rickey and Lloyd Waner. A formal induction ceremony was held in Cooperstown, New York, on July 24, 1967, with Commissioner of Baseball William Eckert presiding.\nBBWAA election.\nThe BBWAA was authorized to elect players active in 1947 or later, but not after 1961; the ballot included selected players, chosen by a screening committee, whose last appearance was in 1961. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote.\nVoters were instructed to cast votes for up to 10 candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall. The ballot consisted of 47 players; a total of 292 ballots were cast, with 219 votes required for election. A total of 2,321 individual votes were cast, an average of 7.95 per ballot.\nNo one reached the threshold, so there was a runoff election featuring the 31 leading candidates (30, including a tie). There would be one winner regardless of numerical support on the second ballot; in fact, winner Red Ruffing tallied 266 of 306 votes or 87%. A total of 1,198 individual votes were cast in the run-off, an average of 4.10 per ballot, as voters concentrated their support on the leading candidates.\nCandidates who were eligible for the first time are indicated here with a dagger (†). Candidates who have since been elected in subsequent elections are indicated in \"italics\".

The club plays in the Polish Basketball League (PLK), the highest-tier level in Polish men's basketball. The home court is Hala Orbita, but many games are played in Centennial Hall.\nHistory.\nSince the basketball section was founded in 1948, \"Śląsk Wrocław\" has been the most decorated and most recognizable club in Polish basketball. The team has won the Polish league championships 18 times so far. Most recognized period of Śląsk's history is the \"Great Śląsk Era\" when the team won five championship titles in a row (1998–2002). \nMost of those successes where achieved with coach Andrej Urlep. The notable players playing for Śląsk Wrocław over the years were: Mieczysław Łopatka (1960s), Edward Jurkiewicz (1970s and 1980s), Jerzy Binkowski (1980s, 1990s), Dariusz Zelig (1980s, 1990s), Maciej Zieliński (1980s, 1990s, 2000s), Adam Wójcik and Dominik Tomczyk. \nIn 2008 the club has gone into serious financial difficulties, which resulted in withdrawing the team from Polish Basketball League. After years of rebuilding attempts, the club is now back playing in the Polish Basketball League top division. \nIn the 2020–21 PLK season, the team finished third. Śląsk defeated Legia Warszawa 86:85 in overtime of the decisive game 3 of the bronze medal series. The result exceeded expectations as it was the club's first league podium finish in 11 years. Key players of that team included Aleksander Dziewa, Kyle Gibson, Elijah Stewart and Strahinja Jovanović.\nThe following season the club returned to the top of the domestic competition becoming Polish champions, twenty years after the last championship won in 2002. Travis Trice won MVP awards for both the regular season and the finals."

He played professionally as a quarterback for the New York Jets of the National Football League (NFL). Taylor played college football for the California Golden Bears and was selected by the Jets in the fourth round of the 1990 NFL Draft.\nAfter his playing career, Taylor served as co-head football coach at Folsom High School in Folsom, California, from 2012 to 2015; co-offensive coordinator at Eastern Washington University in 2016; offensive coordinator at the University of Utah from 2017 to 2018; and as head coach at Sacramento State from 2019 to 2022.\nPlaying career.\nTaylor attended Cordova High School in Rancho Cordova, California. He led his team to a perfect 14–0 record and section championship, also being named northern California player of the year. Taylor played college football at California as starting quarterback from 1986 to 1989 and was the team MVP 1987–89. He led the Pac-10 conference in total offense in 1989 (253 yds. per game). He finished his collegiate career as Cal's all-time leading passer (8,126 yds.) and total offense leader (8,236 yds.), records that stood until they were broken by Jared Goff in 2015. His 51 career touchdown passes stood as a school record until surpassed by Pat Barnes in 1996.\nTaylor was drafted in the fourth round (84th overall pick) of the 1990 NFL Draft by the New York Jets. In his career, Taylor saw action in seven games and threw for 2 touchdown passes.\nCoaching career.\nIn 1994, Taylor served as offensive coordinator at Casa Roble High School in Orangevale, California. He served one year on Rick Neuheisel's staff at the University of Colorado as a graduate assistant in 1995 primarily working with wide receivers. He was hired by Steve Mariucci as Cal's wide receivers coach in 1996, and later served 2 years as a QB coach and 1 year as a tight ends coach under Tom Holmoe.\nFrom 2000 to 2002, Taylor served as an assistant athletic director and coach for Christian Brothers High School in Sacramento. From 2002 to 2004, Taylor served as the Co-head coach of football at Folsom High School. He left that position in 2005 to serve as color analyst for the California Golden Bears' radio broadcast. In 2012, he returned to Folsom High as co-head coach of football, during the 4-year period he was there the bulldogs went 58-3 winning 4 consecutive section championships and a state title.\nTaylor coached Washington quarterback Jake Browning since he was in 5th grade up until his senior year in high school, when he set the national touchdown record in a career with 229 TD passes while also tying a record of 91 touchdown passes in a single season, all while going 16–0 and a D1 state championship.\nTaylor's offense at Folsom High School broke the state in passing for 4 straight years and set a state record for most points scored in a season, a record that still stands today.\nOn February 18, 2016, Taylor was announced as the passing game coordinator and quarterbacks coach for Eastern Washington.\nAt Eastern Washington, Taylor called plays and took an already stellar offense to new heights as they set 2 all-time FCS records for passing yards (5,160 yards) and total offense (5,766 yards) in a season.\nTaylor was instrumental in helping develop former walk-on quarterback Gage Gubrud into a record-setting QB who broke the all-time single-season FCS passing record and the all-time record in total offense. Gubrud also won the FCS player of the year award from numerous sites along with Big Sky Conference co-MVP (with teammate Cooper Kupp). Eastern Washington was also the only team to have 3 wide receivers over 1,000 yards in the season.\nGubrud also set 16 school records, 7 Big Sky records, and 2 FCS records, all while winning the Big Sky Conference title and going undefeated in conference play. Eastern Washington improved in almost every offensive statistical category in his first year. A notable win came in the first game of the season against Washington State where the Eagles won 45–42 and set a school record for total offense.\nOn December 17, 2018, Taylor accepted the head coaching position at Sacramento State after spending the previous two years as the offensive coordinator at Utah.\nOn August 31, 2019, Taylor debuted in his first collegiate game as head coach, in which his team defeated Southern Oregon 77–19.\nOn November 23, 2019, Taylor and his Hornets football team clinched the school's first-ever share of the Big Sky Conference title in a 27–17 victory over the UC Davis Aggies in the 2019 Causeway Classic game. This was Sacramento State's first Big Sky Conference title since the team's induction into the Big Sky in 1996.\nOn November 19, 2022, Taylor would lead the Hornets to their first undefeated regular season in school history after a 27–21 victory over UC Davis in the 2022 Causeway Classic along with their third Big Sky Conference title."

        "text": "The 2008 Italian Open (also known as 2008 Rome Masters and the \"Internazionali BNL d'Italia\" for sponsorship reasons) was a tennis tournament played on outdoor clay courts. It was the 65th edition of the Rome Masters, and was part of the ATP Masters Series of the 2008 ATP Tour, and of the Tier I Series of the 2008 WTA Tour. Both the men's and the women's events took place at the Foro Italico in Rome, Italy, with the men playing from 5 May through 11 May 2008, and the women from 12 May through 18 May 2008.\nThe men's field featured world No. 1 and Monte-Carlo Masters runner-up Roger Federer, defending champion, Monte Carlo and Barcelona winner Rafael Nadal, and Australian Open champion Novak Djokovic. Others top seeds competing were Miami Masters champion Nikolay Davydenko, Valencia Open winner David Ferrer, Andy Roddick, David Nalbandian, and James Blake.\nThe women's draw was headlined by WTA No. 2 and Indian Wells champion Ana Ivanovic, Australian Open winner Maria Sharapova, and Indian Wells finalist Svetlana Kuznetsova. Other notable names in the field were defending champion Jelena Janković, Miami and Charleston winner Serena Williams, Anna Chakvetadze, Venus Williams, and Marion Bartoli.\nReview.\nMen.\nThird seed Novak Djokovic overcame a number of upsets to his fellow top seeds to win his fourth ATP Masters Series title. He beat the unseeded Stanislas Wawrinka in the final, who was aiming to become the second unseeded champion in Rome in the Open Era, and the first Swiss to win the title here.\nThe tournament was notable for its semifinals, where both Radek Štěpánek and Andy Roddick retired before the completion of their matches. It was the first time this situation had happened at a Masters Series event in ATP history. The two matches combined lasted a mere forty-nine minutes, and fans in attendance were refunded with 50% off tickets for the following week's women's tournament.\nThe big story at the beginning of the week was Rafael Nadal's shock second round loss to Juan Carlos Ferrero, his second defeat in one-hundred-and-five matches on clay. Nadal was trying to win his third tournament in three weeks. He had earlier complained about the ATP schedule, saying it was \"impossible\" for the players to maintain their best level at all four of the European clay tournaments back-to-back.\nBob Bryan and Mike Bryan won the doubles title, beating Daniel Nestor and Nenad Zimonjić in the championships match.\nWomen.\nJelena Janković successfully defended a title for the first time in her career with a straight set victory over qualifier Alizé Cornet in the final. Cornet was the first female qualifier to reach the final at this tournament in the Open Era. She defeated two Top Ten players, Svetlana Kuznetsova and Anna Chakvetadze to reach the biggest final of her career so far.\nLike the men's event, the later stages of the women's tournament were hit by two high-profile withdrawals. Serena Williams withdrew before her quarterfinal match with Cornet due to a back injury, and new world No. 1, Maria Sharapova, withdrew before her semifinal match with Janković due to a left calf injury.\nTsvetana Pironkova caused the biggest shock of the tournament in the second round, beating top-seeded and WTA No. 3, Ana Ivanovic, for her second career Top Ten victory. She eventually made her first ever Tier I quarterfinal, benefitting from Victoria Azarenka's retirement in the third round, before losing to Chakvetadze in three sets.\nThe doubles title was won by Taiwanese pairing Chan Yung-jan and Chuang Chia-jung, after they beat Iveta Benešová and Janette Husárová in straight sets to win their first ever Tier I title as a team.\nFinals.\nMen's singles.\n Novak Djokovic defeated Stanislas Wawrinka 4–6, 6–3, 6–3\nWomen's singles.\n Jelena Janković defeated Alizé Cornet 6–2, 6–2\nMen's doubles.\n Bob Bryan / Mike Bryan defeated Daniel Nestor / Nenad Zimonjić 3–6, 6–4, [10–8]\nWomen's doubles.\n Chan Yung-jan / Chuang Chia-jung defeated Iveta Benešová / Janette Husárová 7–6 (7–5), 6–3"

He also struck out 108 batters in 118 innings. He was ranked the 89th best prospect by Baseball America in 1991.\nRogers split time between the Shreveport Captains and Phoenix Firebirds in 1992, going a combined 11–8 with a 3.16 ERA.

Facing the St. Louis Cardinals, Rogers pitched six innings, allowing three earned runs on eight hits and two walks. He allowed one home run, which he gave up to the first batter he faced – Gerónimo Peña. Although he had proven himself to be a strikeout pitcher in the minors, he struck out only one batter in his first major league start – that batter being Ray Lankford. Rogers finished 0–2 with a 4.24 ERA in six starts. He struck out 26 batters in 34 innings pitched.\nAlthough Rogers had been a starter throughout his entire career, he found his niche as a reliever in 1993. In 64 relief appearances, he was 2–2 with a 2.68 ERA and 62 strikeouts in 80 innings of work. In 1993, he was ranked the 50th best prospect by Baseball America.\nRogers made only nine relief appearances in 1994 due to a clot in his pitching shoulder, posting a 3.48 ERA in 10 innings of work. He appeared in his final big league game on May 1 of that year.\nDespite never pitching in the majors again, Rogers pitched in the minors until 1998. In 1995, he appeared in a total of seven games - five of which were starts – while splitting time between San Jose and Phoenix. Combined, he went 0–2 with a 2.51 ERA in 14 innings of work. He struck out a total of six batters.\nPitching for San Jose in 1997 after missing all of 1996, Rogers went 0–0 with a 2.76 ERA in eight games started.

Combined, he went 0–2 with a 4.02 ERA. In 40 innings of work, he struck out 36 batters.\nRogers pitched his final season in professional baseball in 1998.

He went 2–1 with a 5.03 ERA in 62 innings of work, striking out 52 batters.\nOverall, Rogers went 2–4 with a 3.17 ERA in 79 major league appearances. In 125 innings, he allowed 118 hits, struck out 95 batters and walked 47 batters. In eight minor league seasons, Rogers went 46–40 with a 3.59 ERA in 184 games (131 starts).

Hale Irwin won his second U.S. Open title, two strokes ahead of former champions Jerry Pate and Gary Player.\nSummary.\nFor the first time, the USGA granted exemptions to Order of Merit champions of the top five international tours. The tours granted exemptions were: Southern African Tour, European Tour, PGA Tour of Australia, Asia Golf Circuit, and Japan Golf Tour.\nHale Irwin, the 1974 champion, held a three-stroke lead over Tom Weiskopf going to the final round. Irwin did not play particularly well, recording bogeys at 11, 14, and 18, and a double-bogey at 17. His final-round 75 tied the post-World War II tournament record for highest final round score by the champion. Jerry Pate, the 1976 champion, began the day five behind Irwin and carded a 72 to finish two back. 1965 champion Gary Player, nine behind at the start of the round, fired a 68 to tie Pate for 2nd. Weiskopf struggled on his way to a 76 and finished in 4th.\nDuring the first round a mini controversy sprung up when Lon Hinkle purposefully hit his tee shot on the par 5 8th hole on to the fairway of hole 17, dramatically shortening the hole by cutting off the dogleg. Hinkle reached the green in two with an iron, two putted for birdie and shared the first-round lead. USGA officials were not pleased by Hinkle's ingenuity and the following morning planted a tree off the side of the 8th tee so that players would not be able to take Hinkle's shortcut again.\nPlayer's runner-up finish was his final top-10 in a U.S. Open. Fred Couples, age 19, played in his first major championship and was low amateur.\nThis was the fourth U.S. Open at Inverness, which hosted in 1920, 1931, and 1957.

Andy North held on for a one-stroke victory over runners-up Dave Stockton and J. C. Snead to claim the first of his two U.S. Open titles.\nThe strength in North's game was putting, and he needed only 114 putts over 72 holes, tying the record set by Billy Casper in 1966. This was North's second win on the PGA Tour, but he would not win again until the 1985 U.S. Open; of North's three career PGA Tour wins, two of them came at the U.S. Open.\nThis was the third U.S. Open at Cherry Hills, which previously hosted in 1938 and 1960. It was also the site of the PGA Championship in 1941, and later hosted in 1985. The average elevation of the course exceeds above sea level.\nThree players received special exemptions into the field. They were Billy Casper, Seve Ballesteros, and Arnold Palmer.\nForty-three golfers received an exemption from the qualifying process. The PGA Tour felt this was too few players.

Two months earlier, Player had won the Masters with a blistering 64 in the final round. History, however, would not repeat itself, as this time around Player struggled to a 77 (+6) and finished in a tie for 6th. North owned a four-shot lead over Snead heading to the back-nine, and after birdies at 11 and 13 he appeared to have the championship wrapped up. A bogey at 14, however, combined with a double-bogey at 15 and a birdie by Dave Stockton at the same hole dropped his lead to just one. Stockton, however, missed an 18-footer (5.5 m) for par at 18, increasing North's lead to two.\nSnead had a chance for birdie at the last after his tee shot skipped off the water and onto the fairway, but he missed the birdie putt. Needing just a bogey at 18 to win, North's drive found the rough. He hit his second shot into the fairway, then his third found a greenside bunker. Needing to get up-and-down, he played his sand shot to five feet (1.5 m), and after backing off twice, sank the bogey putt for the one-stroke win.\nAmateurs: Bobby Clampett (+13), Jim Holtgrieve (+20)\nScorecard.\n\"Final round\"\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\"&lt;br&gt;"

Hubert Green won the first of his two major titles, one stroke ahead of runner-up Lou Graham, the 1975 champion.\nGreen began the final round with the lead, but 11 players were within three shots. Graham made a charge on the back nine, collecting birdies at 12, 14, 15, and 16 en route to a 68 (−2) and a 279 (−1) total. With four holes to play, Green needed to play even-par to win the championship. As he stepped off the 14th green, however, he was approached by tournament officials and a lieutenant with the Tulsa police, who told him that they had received a phone call threatening to assassinate Green while he played the 15th hole. Green decided to play on, then proceeded to hit his drive into a tree—which probably saved it from going out of bounds. He managed to hit his approach to and two-putt for par without incident. Green birdied the 16th and took a two-stroke lead to the 18th tee. Although he struggled on the hole, he managed to make a four-footer for bogey and the victory.\nThis year marked the final U.S. Open appearance by Sam Snead, two-time champion Julius Boros, and Tommy Bolt, who had won the 1958 Open at Southern Hills.

Tour rookie Jerry Pate won his only major championship, two strokes ahead of runners-up Al Geiberger and Tom Weiskopf.\nJohn Mahaffey, who lost the U.S. Open in a playoff the year before, took the lead with a 68 in the second round. He followed that up with a 69 in the third round on Saturday for a two-stroke lead over Jerry Pate after 54 holes, with Geiberger three back and Weiskopf four back. The gap was still two strokes after fourteen holes, but Pate hit a one-iron close and birdied the par-3 15th; and when Mahaffey bogeyed 16, the two were tied. Mahaffey three-putted for bogey on 17 and Pate took a one-stroke lead as Mahaffey fell into a tie for second with Geiberger and Weiskopf, both in the clubhouse with 279.\nBoth Mahaffey and Pate found the rough off the 18th tee. Mahaffey, behind by a shot and trying for birdie, hit his approach shot into the water fronting the green and made bogey, and fell into a tie for fourth. Having a better lie in the rough, Pate gambled that he could clear the water and then hit one of the most memorable shots in U.S. Open history. His 5-iron approach from flew directly on to the green and stopped from the hole, and he made the birdie putt for a two-stroke victory.\nThe U.S. Amateur champion two years earlier in 1974, Pate was only 22 in 1976 and appeared to have a bright future ahead of him, but shoulder injuries significantly shortened his career. He won seven more PGA Tour tournaments, the last in 1982, and finished runner-up in two additional majors in the late 1970s.\nFuture champion Fuzzy Zoeller made his major championship debut at this U.S. Open and finished in 38th place. Mike Reid, a 21-year-old amateur, led by three shots after the first round, but a second-round 81 dashed any hope of an amateur champion. He shared low-amateur honors with John Fought at 300 (+20).\nJack Nicklaus finished tied for eleventh and saw his streak of 13 consecutive top-10s in majors come to an end. He began a new streak and finished in the top-10 in the next nine majors. Only Harry Vardon made more consecutive major top-10s when he made sixteen in a row – fifteen Open Championships (1894–1908) and the U.S. Open in 1900.\nThis was the first of four majors held at the Highlands Course; it hosted the PGA Championship in 1981, 2001, and 2011.\nThis was the first year that players were allowed to have their own caddies at the U.S. Open.

Lou Graham defeated John Mahaffey by two strokes in an 18-hole Monday playoff to win his only major championship.\nTom Watson shot 135 (−7) to tie the U.S. Open record for the first 36 holes of play, but 155 (+13) on the weekend forced him down the leaderboard, three shots out of the Graham-Mahaffey playoff. It marked the second straight year Watson failed to maintain a weekend lead in the championship; he was the 54-hole leader in 1974 at Winged Foot. He won the next major a month later in Scotland at Carnoustie.\nArnold Palmer finished in a tie for ninth place, his final top-10 finish at the U.S. Open. Jerry Pate tied for 18th place and shared low amateur honors with Jay Haas; Pate won the following year as a tour rookie.\nPaired with Palmer was Masters champion Jack Nicklaus, who was two-under in the final round and just missed a birdie putt on the 15th green. He carded three consecutive bogeys to finish and ended up two strokes back. Nicklaus rebounded and won the PGA Championship in August at Firestone.\nThe quality of the play was generally regarded as poor. Despite the high scores Jack Nicklaus said it was the \"easiest\" U.S. Open he had ever remembered playing. Runner-up John Mahaffey stated at the end of the event, \"This course was never as difficult as the scores looked. I agree with everybody who said it was the easiest Open in history to have won. At least 10 guys could have won it by five shots if they'd played golf.\" The sportswriter Dan Jenkins regularly panned the performance of the players in his \"Sport Illustrated\" cover profile, stating in his opening sentence that \"it was a golf tournament that begged to be forgotten.\"\nSince moving to the four-day format in 1965, this is the only U.S. Open in which the final round was not scheduled for Father's Day, the third Sunday in June.\nThis was the second U.S. Open at Medinah, the first was held in 1949. It later hosted in 1990, also a playoff, and the PGA Championship in 1999 and 2006, both won by Tiger Woods.

Mahaffey holed a putt for birdie at 14, then parred out the rest of the way to post an even-par 71 and 287 total. Graham went to the 18th with a one-stroke lead and a chance to win in regulation, but he hit his approach into a bunker and failed to save par and fell into a tie with Mahaffey. Several other players had an opportunity to join the playoff. Bob Murphy was tied until a bogey at 18 dropped him a shot out of the playoff, and Ben Crenshaw found the water on 17 and also finished a stroke out, as did defending champion Hale Irwin.

In what became known as the \"Massacre at Winged Foot,\" Hale Irwin's score of 287 (+7) was good enough for the first of his three U.S. Open titles, two strokes ahead of runner-up Forrest Fezler.\nTournament summary.\nIn the first round, with an even-par 70, Gary Player took the solo lead. In the second round Player shot a three-over-par 73 and retained the lead, now tied with Hale Irwin, Raymond Floyd, and Arnold Palmer. This group led by one over Tom Kite and Tom Watson.\nIn the third-round Watson shot a one-under-par 69 to take a one-stroke lead over Irwin. Palmer stayed in contention with a 73 (+3), now in solo third. However Player, Floyd, and Kite fell out of contention with significantly over-par rounds.\nIn the final round Watson bogeyed holes 4, 5, and 8 on the front nine to lose the lead to Irwin. He then bogeyed six more holes on the back nine to fall out of contention. Journeyman golfer Forrest Fezler shot one-under-par through the first 15 holes to suddenly move into contention. He then made long par putts at 16 and 17 to stay near the lead. Needing a birdie at 18 to tie Irwin, Fezler missed the green and could not convert another lengthy par save at the last, missing from to finish with an even-par 70. He finished at 289 (+9), the clubhouse leader, but multiple strokes behind Irwin, still the overall leader. Irwin bogeyed the 15th and 16th holes but made a 10-footer (3 m) to save par at 17th. With a two-shot lead heading to the 18th, Irwin hit his approach to the center of the green and two-putted for par and the championship.\nWinged Foot played extremely difficult throughout the tournament, leading sportswriter Dick Schaap to coin the phrase \"The Massacre at Winged Foot,\" also the title of his book about the tournament. Irwin's 7-over total tied for second-highest aggregate winning score since 1935.

After a 76 (+5) on Saturday, Miller started the final round six strokes back, in a four-way tie for 13th place at three strokes over par, and few gave him any chance of winning. Miller birdied the first four holes, but after a bogey at the eighth, it certainly did not appear like he was on the brink of the greatest round in U.S. Open history.\nBut he then birdied four of the next five holes, and after a par at 14 he was tied for the lead with Palmer, Boros, and Tom Weiskopf. At the 15th hole, Miller hit his approach to and converted for birdie to take solo possession of the lead.

Jack Nicklaus, age 32, captured his third U.S. Open title, three strokes ahead of runner-up Bruce Crampton. This was the first of six major championships held to date at Pebble Beach: five U.S. Opens and the PGA Championship in 1977. This was also the first time the U.S. Open was played at a public golf course. \nScoring conditions during the final round were extremely difficult; the average was 78.8, the highest in post-war U.S. Open history. Nicklaus' 290 (+2) was the second-highest winning score during that span. It was Nicklaus' eleventh career major championship as a professional, tying the record of Walter Hagen. When combined with his two U.S. Amateur wins, it was his thirteenth major, equaling Bobby Jones for most \nDefending champion Lee Trevino had been hospitalized in Texas for several days for bronchitis and pneumonia; he was released on Tuesday, two days before the first round, and tied for fourth.\nIt was the second consecutive major title for Nicklaus, who won the Masters in April.

Lee Trevino, the 1968 champion, won his second U.S. Open, defeating Jack Nicklaus by three strokes in an 18-hole playoff. It was the second of Trevino's six major titles and the second of four times in which Nicklaus was the runner-up to Trevino in a major; Nicklaus won his third U.S. Open the following year.\nThe U.S. Open was just part of an outstanding year for Trevino in 1971 and following this playoff win, his confidence soared. Two weeks later he won the Canadian Open in a the next week the British Open, and became the first to win those three national opens in the same only Tiger Woods has done it since, in 2000. Trevino won six times on tour in 1971 with two majors and was PGA Player of the Year. He was named athlete of the year by the Associated Press and \"Sporting News\", and was the \"Sports Illustrated\" \"Sportsman of the Year.\" Trevino was the first to win the U.S. and British Opens in the same year in 18 years, last accomplished by Ben Hogan in 1953. The others were Gene Sarazen in 1932 and amateur Bobby Jones in 1926 and 1930, his grand slam year. Subsequent winners of both were Tom Watson in 1982 and Woods in 2000.\nFor Jim Simons, a Pennsylvania native entering his senior year at Wake Forest, his fifth-place finish remains the most recent top ten by an amateur at the U.S. Open. It is the best since Nicklaus' tie for fourth in 1961, following his runner-up finish the year before at age 20 in 1960. The last victory by an amateur at any major was at the U.S. Open in 1933, won by Johnny Goodman of Omaha. Bobby Jones won four U.S. Opens as an amateur, the last in 1930 was part of his grand slam.\nThis was the third U.S. Open played at Merion, which previously hosted in 1934 and 1950.

Needing a birdie to tie, his tee shot found the thick rough; a double bogey six yielded a 76 and he finished three strokes back in a tie for fifth place. Trevino took the lead with a birdie at 14, but then missed an 8-footer (2.4 m) for par at the last. He backed off before the putt after a disturbance in the gallery. Nicklaus' birdie putt for the win on the 72nd green also narrowly missed, and settled for par to force a Monday afternoon playoff.

Trevino had acquired it at a zoo gift shop and used it earlier in the week along with a pith helmet and hatchet during a whimsical photo shoot emphasizing Merion's thick and penal rough. Hot and humid in the early afternoon, Trevino reached into his golf bag for a fresh glove and came across the snake and took it out to entertain the crowd. Nicklaus then asked him to toss it over, which Trevino did. Nicklaus picked it up, laughed with the crowd, then threw it back to Trevino. It would later be written that Trevino had tossed the snake at Nicklaus in an attempt to unnerve his rival; in reality, Nicklaus was the one who asked him to throw the snake.\nWhen the playoff began, Trevino bogeyed the first hole and Nicklaus took the lead, but then hit two poor bunker shots on the next two, allowing Trevino to open a two-stroke lead. Although Nicklaus cut into the lead several times, to within one stroke as late as the 12th tee, Trevino never relinquished it. He carded a 68 to Nicklaus' 71 to win by three. Nicklaus won his third U.S. Open the following year in 1972 at Pebble Beach, and a record-tying fourth at Baltusrol at age 40 in 1980.\nTelevision coverage by ABC Sports for the Monday playoff was scheduled for just an hour, beginning at 4:30 p.m. EDT.

Tony Jacklin shot under-par in all four rounds on his way to a seven-stroke victory and his only U.S. Open title, the second of his two major championships. He was the first champion born in England since Cyril Walker in 1924.\nJacklin led wire-to-wire and was hardly threatened throughout the championship.\nThe first round was played in extremely challenging conditions with winds blustering up to 41 miles an hour and resulted in generally high scoring with only 7 players in the field breaking 75. Arnold Palmer shot 79, Gary Player 80, and Jack Nicklaus 81. In contrast Jacklin thrived in the conditions and returned a 71 saying the wind blew harder in England and \"the more it blows, the better I like it.\"\nJacklin took a four-shot lead over Dave Hill into the final round, and despite bogeys at the 7th and 8th, made a long birdie putt at 9 to quell any talk of a collapse. Jacklin shot a third consecutive round of 70 and a 281 total, seven clear of the field and the only player under par.\nThe final round was broadcast by ABC. The existing footage includes commentary from Byron Nelson, Dave Marr and Henry Longhurst.\nOpened eight years earlier, Hazeltine was hosting its first men's major championship, and reviews were mixed. Runner-up Hill, when asked what the course lacked, said: \"Eighty acres of corn and a few cows. They ruined a good farm when they built this course.\" Jacklin was more philosophical about the course. \"We have to accept things as they are\" he said. \"After all, they aren't going to change the course just for me. No golf course will suit everybody perfectly.\"\nThe course underwent significant renovations; when the U.S. Open returned twenty-one years later in 1991 it drew generally positive reviews, even from Hill. Hazeltine later hosted the PGA Championship twice (2002, 2009) and the Ryder Cup in 2016.\nJacklin's win was the first in the U.S. Open by a European in over forty years and the last for forty more, until Graeme McDowell won at Pebble Beach in 2010. The next win by an Englishman was three years later in 2013, Justin Rose at Merion.\nFuture major winners Ben Crenshaw (age 18) and John Mahaffey (age 22) tied for low amateur honors at 301 (+13), tied for 36th place. Just out of high school, Crenshaw was tied for eighth after each of the first two rounds.\nRound summaries.\nFirst round.\n\"Thursday, June 18, 1970\"\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, June 19, 1970\"\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, June 20, 1970\"\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, June 21, 1970\""

It remains one of the few men-only golf clubs in the United States.\nThe course first opened on May 29, 1897 as the Island Golf Links, a nine-hole layout for guests of the Garden City Hotel. Designed by Devereux Emmet, it was soon expanded to eighteen holes with a total length of over , making it the longest course in the United States. The expanded course was incorporated as the Garden City Golf Club on May 17, 1899. Its club house was designed by Richard Howland Hunt.\nGarden City Golf Club hosted the U.S. Open in 1902, which was won by Laurie Auchterlonie. It marked the first time that a player had shot lower than 80 in all four rounds. Amateur Walter Travis, a founding member of the Garden City Golf Club, finished second in the tournament. A few years later, Travis redesigned the layout of his home course, adding numerous bunkers and modifying the greens. During the U.S. Amateur at the Garden City Golf Club, Travis hit a ball into a new pot bunker near the eighteenth green, which led to his defeat in a semifinal match against Jerry Travers. In addition to hosting the U.S. Amateur in 1908, Garden City Golf Club also hosted the tournament in 1900, 1913, and 1936. Garden City was also the host of the Walker Cup in 1924.\nAfter the death of Walter Travis, the Garden City Golf Club renamed its Spring Invitational to the Walter J. Travis Invitational in 1927. Held annually since 1902, it has now become one of the premier mid-amateur golf tournaments in the New York metropolitan area.\nIn 2013, the Garden City Golf Club was ranked 26th overall in \"Golf Magazine\"s list of the Top 100 Courses in the U.S., 47th in \"Golf Magazine\"s list of the Top 100 Courses in the World, 55th in \"Golf Digest\"s list of America's 100 Greatest Golf Courses, and 9th among Golf Digest's golf courses in New York City."

Controversy arose both over the selection of a pitcher with only 28 major-league victories (Negro league baseball statistics were not considered major-league statistics until 2020) and about the original plan not to include Negro league players in the main Hall of Fame. In July, officials announced that Paige and future Negro league selections would be included in the main Hall of Fame. Paige was honored alongside other Hall of Fame inductees in August.\nOtherwise, the elections continued a system of annual elections in place since 1968. The Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) voted by mail to select from recent major league players and elected no one. The Veterans Committee met in closed-door sessions to select from executives, managers, umpires, and earlier major league players. It elected seven, the most in its 1953 to 2001 history: Dave Bancroft, Jake Beckley, Chick Hafey, Harry Hooper, Joe Kelley, Rube Marquard, and George Weiss.

All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote.\nVoters were instructed to cast votes for up to 10 candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall. The ballot consisted of 48 players; a total of 360 ballots were cast, with 270 votes required for election. A total of 2,681 individual votes were cast, an average of 7.45 per ballot. Those candidates receiving less than 5% of the vote will not appear on future BBWAA ballots but may eventually be considered by the Veterans Committee.\nCandidates who were eligible for the first time are indicated here with a dagger (†).

He scored 21-point on his full debut for Munster against Llanelli Scarlets on 22 September 2007. He was on the bench for Munster for the 2008 Heineken Cup Final against Toulouse, but did not come on. In April 2009, Warwick scored two monster drop-goals and a try in Munster's 2008–09 Heineken Cup quarter-final against Ospreys, a game in which he won the Man-of-the-Match award. On 27 January 2009, he reportedly signed a three-year deal with Aviva Premiership club London Irish, starting at the start of the 2009–10 Guinness Premiership season. However, there was speculation as to whether he would be joining London Irish or remaining with Munster for the start of the next season, and a Tug-of-War started between the two sides looking to secure his services. On 9 April 2009, Munster and London Irish announced that the issue over Warwick has been resolved to the satisfaction of all parties and that Warwick would be remaining with Munster for 2010–11. He was part of the Munster team that won the 2008–09 Magners League. Warwick scored all of Munster's points during their historic 15–6 win over Australia in November 2010, kicking 3 penalties and 2 drop goals. On 20 December 2010, Munster confirmed that Warwick would leave at the end of the 2010–11 season. He attracted the interest of several European clubs, who offered terms that Munster could not match. Warwick's last appearance for Munster was when he came off the bench during the 2011 Celtic League Grand Final. Munster won the match, against newly crowned Heineken Cup champions and fierce rivals Leinster, 19–9 in Thomond Park.\nAs Warwick has played Rugby sevens with the Australia Sevens, he will never be eligible to play for Ireland, despite the fact that he would now qualify through marriage and residency.\nStade Français.\nHe joined Stade Français in 2011 on a two-year contract.\nWorcester Warriors.\nIt was announced on 25 January 2013 that Warwick will join Aviva Premiership side Worcester Warriors at the beginning of the 2013–14 season.

It was held from 15 to 23 February 1947 at Štvanice Stadium in Prague, Czechoslovakia. Eight teams participated, but the competition was notably missing the reigning world champion, Canada. The world champion was decided for the first time by round robin league play. Czechoslovakia won the world championship for the first time and the European championship for the seventh time. King Gustav V had sent a telegram of congratulations to the Swedish team after beating the Czechoslovaks, but they had barely finished celebrating when they were upset by the Austrians, costing them the gold medal.\nHistory.\nThe 1947 congress of the Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace (LIHG) was the first meeting or the organization since World War II. During the war, the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) united with the Amateur Hockey Association of the United States (AHAUS) to form the International Ice Hockey Association, and invited the British Ice Hockey Association to join. The new group was led by CAHA president W. G. Hardy, and was a means of shifting the control of world hockey from Europe to Canada.\nThe CAHA severed its ties to the LIHG in 1944, and pledged allegiance to the International Ice Hockey Association instead, and a closer relationship to AHAUS. The CAHA and AHAUS agreed in 1946 to propose a merger with the LIHG to oversee international ice hockey. The proposal sought for the Ice Hockey World Championships to alternate between Europe and North America, with the Olympic hockey tournaments played under the same rules as the CAHA and the National Hockey League. The CAHA attended the LIHG meeting during the 1947 championships, and pushed for the definition of amateur to be anyone not actively engaged in professional sport. The LIHG agreed to a merger where the presidency would alternate between North America and Europe every three years, and recognized AHAUS as the governing body of hockey in the United States instead of the Amateur Athletic Union. The CAHA was permitted to have its own definition of amateur as long as teams at the Olympic games adhered to existing LIHG rules.\nMany notable changes were made to the rules for this championship. The game was standardized to be played in three 20 minute periods, aligning with the Canadian practice. The net size was standardized as well. There would be no more one- and three-minute penalties, and penalty shots were instituted.\nJapan and Germany were barred from participation, but the LIHG was careful to illustrate that it was the politics, not the people, who were at fault, and allies like Austria and Italy were admitted.\n1947 World Ice Hockey Championships (Prague, Czechoslovakia).\nFinal standings.\nWorld Champion 1947\n Czechoslovakia\nFinal rankings -- European Championship.\n1947 European Champion\n Czechoslovakia"

        "title": "Doping in American football",
        "text": " \nThe use of anabolic steroids and performance-enhancing drugs in American football is officially prohibited by virtually every sanctioning body.\nThe National Football League (NFL) began to test players for steroid use during the 1987 season, and started to issue suspensions to players during the 1989 season. The NFL has issued as many as six random drug tests to players, with each player receiving at least one drug test per season. One notable incident occurred in 1992, when defensive end Lyle Alzado died from brain cancer, which was attributed to the use of anabolic steroids; however, Alzado's doctors stated that anabolic steroids did not contribute to his death.\nThe use of performance-enhancing drugs has also been found in other levels of football, including college level, and high school. The most recent figures from the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) football drug tests (see NCAA drug testing) show that one percent of all NCAA football players failed drug tests taken at bowl games, and three percent have admitted to using steroids overall. In the NCAA, players are subject to random testing with 48 hours notice, and are also randomly tested throughout the annual bowl games. The NCAA will usually take approximately 20 percent of the players on a football team to test on a specific day.\nAnabolic steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs are also used throughout high school football. Steroid use at this level of play doubled from 1991 to 2003, with results of a survey showing that about 6 percent of players out of the 15,000 surveyed had admitted to using some type of anabolic steroid or performance-enhancing drug at one point in their playing time. Other data shows that only 4 percent of high schools have some form of drug testing program in place for their football teams.\nUse in the NFL.\nThe use of performance-enhancing drugs and anabolic steroids dates back to the late 1960s in the National Football League (NFL). The case of Denver Broncos defensive lineman Lyle Alzado notably exposed early use among NFL players. In the last years of his life, as he battled against the brain tumor that eventually caused his death at the age of 43, Alzado asserted that his steroid abuse directly led to his fatal illness, but his physician stated it could not possibly be true. Alzado recounted his steroid abuse in an article in \"Sports Illustrated\". He said:\nFormer player and NFL coach Jim Haslett said in 2005 that during the 1980s, half of the players in the league used some type of performance-enhancing drug or steroid and all of the defensive lineman used them. One of the players from the Super Bowl winning 1979 Pittsburgh Steelers team who had earlier confessed to using steroids (in a 1985 \"Sports Illustrated\" article) was offensive lineman Steve Courson. Courson blamed a heart condition that he developed on steroids. However, Courson also said that some of his teammates, such as Jack Ham and Jack Lambert, refused to use any kind of performance-enhancing drug.\nThe BALCO Scandal in 2003 also revealed many users of steroids in the NFL. The scandal followed a US Federal government investigation of the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (BALCO) into accusations of its supplying anabolic steroids to professional athletes. U.S. sprint coach Trevor Graham had given an anonymous phone call to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) in June 2003 accusing a number of athletes being involved in doping with a steroid that was not detectable at the time. He named BALCO owner Victor Conte as the source of the steroid. As evidence, Graham delivered a syringe containing traces of a substance nicknamed \"The Clear\".\nShortly after, then-director of the UCLA Olympic Analytical Laboratory Don Catlin, developed a testing process for The Clear (tetrahydrogestrinone (THG)). With the ability to detect THG, the USADA retested 550 existing urine samples from athletes, of which several proved to be positive for THG.\nA number of players from the Oakland Raiders were implicated in this scandal, including Bill Romanowski, Tyrone Wheatley, Barrett Robbins, Chris Cooper and Dana Stubblefield. Recently, many players have confessed to steroid use. One of these players was former Oakland Raiders player Bill Romanowski. Romanowski confessed on \"60 Minutes\" to using steroids for a two-year period beginning in 2001. He stated that these were supplied by former NFL player and former head of BALCO Victor Conte, saying:\nA notable occurrence happened in 2006. During the season, San Diego Chargers linebacker Shawne Merriman failed a drug test and was suspended for four games when his primary \"A\" sample and backup \"B\" sample both tested positive for a banned substance. Merriman was named NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year in 2005, with 54 tackles and 10 sacks. He also had a total of five passes defended and two forced fumbles. He was a starting player in the 2005 Pro Bowl, and was a leader on his team in sacks in the 2006 season. The incident led to the passage of a rule that forbids a player who tests positive steroids from being selected to the Pro Bowl in the year in which they tested positive. The rule is commonly referred to as the \"Merriman Rule\". However, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has tried to distance the policy from being associated with the player, stating that Merriman tested clean on 19 of 20 random tests for performance-enhancing drugs since entering the league.\nThe NFL drug testing season commences on 4/20 of each year. The NFL is known to take drug tests seriously. When an athlete is selected for a drug test, they must have it completed within 4 hours of notice, or else the league will start to impose fines and suspensions for not complying. If athletes fail to complete the test in the 4-hour window, the NFLPA will still treat it as if they tested positive, even if no drugs were found. The NFL has drastically increased the frequency of testing athletes. In the past 10 years, the NFL has begun to crack down heavily on athlete's use of performance-enhancing drugs and has further improved their testing methods each year since. The drug testing season closes at the end of the season; up until Super Bowl week, players may be subject to random drug tests.\nPlayers are notified usually after practice via a note on their chair next to their locker that they are required to complete a drug test. Any failure or refusal to complete the test will be treated as a positive result, and the athlete will be given the full punishment as if they were tested positive. The athletes then have limited time to complete the test to be eligible to play the next week and so forth. The athlete will then urinate into a cup and that will be sent to an official testing facility to deem if the athlete is clean or is tested positive for an illegal substance. After all testing is completed, the athlete and club manager are notified of the results. If the test indicates that the athlete has taken performance-enhancing drugs, both individuals are notified of the imposed sanctions. Players can be tested either at a team facility or if the team is away they can be tested at the nearest NFL testing station.\nAppeals process.\nIf an athlete is deemed positive for PEDS every player has the option to appeal the result. The most noticeable appeal that has been won in recent years was Richard Sherman in 2012 when he avoided a 4-game suspension because of wrongful practices when he was being tested. Although the likelihood of an appeal going the players way is unlikely. Very few players that are tested positive end up winning the appeal only a few have won the appeal in recent years.\nNFL banned substances policy.\nThe NFL banned substances policy has been acclaimed by some and criticized by others. Critics argue that the NFL's policy on performance-enhancing drugs, set by the NFL and by the players' union (National Football League Players Association) instead of an independent agency like USADA, bans a specific list of stimulants rather than a \"catchall\" approach like the World Anti-Doping Agency, and uses random testing instead of the globally accepted intelligence-driven testing. The policy is one of the longest running in professional sports, beginning in 1987. Since the NFL started random, year-round tests and suspending players for banned substances, many more players have been found to be in violation of the policy. By April 2005, 111 NFL players had tested positive for banned substances, and of those 111, the NFL suspended 54.\nThough the policy involves all players getting tested times throughout the regular season, the playoffs, and during the off-season, Dr. Forest Tennant, the former drug adviser to the National Football League, stated that “its current policy, based on random testing, has not eliminated the problem.” The policy was different in the 1990s than it is today, due to heavy criticism from the United States Government. Originally, there were specific guidelines for when the player was caught using a steroid or other performance-enhancing drug. If a player was caught using steroids during training camp or some other off-season workout, they were suspended for 30 days for a first-time offense. Typically, this would mean missing four games, three in the pre-season and one in the regular season. Players would then be tested throughout the year for performance-enhancing drugs and steroids. A player who tested positively during a previous test might or might not be included in the next random sampling. A player who tested positive again would be suspended for one year, and a suspension for a third offense was never specified, because it never happened. In later years when many players ignored the policy, NFLPA director Gene Upshaw sent out a letter to all NFL players that stated:\nThe current policy includes having 20% of each team’s players blood-tested at random each year in training camp, and the offseason, 10% are blood-tested. The NFL employs isoform blood tests for Human Growth Hormone instead of the more precise biomarker test, which only has a detection window of 24 to 48 hours, and when notified at home, a player may take up to 24 hours to submit a sample.\nUse in college football.\nSteroids and performance-enhancing drugs have been reportedly used by many college football players in the NCAA. According to a recent drug test and survey, about one percent of all NCAA football players have tested positive for a performance-enhancing drug or steroid, and about three percent have admitted to using one sometime during their college football career.\nControversy arose in 2005, when former Brigham Young University player Jason Scukanec, although never admitting to using steroids himself, stated that steroids were used in many notable Division I programs.\nScukanec, who is the co-host of a sports talk radio show \"Primetime With Isaac and Big Suke\" on KFXX-AM (AM 1080 \"The Fan\") in Portland, Oregon, made these statements:\nPortland State University coach Tim Walsh commented on the situation, declining the remarks:\nThe number of players who have admitted using steroids in a confidential survey conducted by the NCAA since the 1980s has dropped from 9.7 percent in 1989 to 3.0 percent in 2003. During the 2003 season, there were over 7,000 drug tests, with just 77 turning up as positive test results. Scukanec claims that methods were used to get around the drug testing, whether it be avoiding the tests by using the drugs during the off-season, or flushing the drugs out of your system. This was used with a liquid he referred to as the \"pink.\" He stated:\nHealth issues.\nPerformance-enhancing drugs, most notably anabolic steroids can cause many health issues. Many American football players have experienced these health issues from using anabolic steroids, which have even resulted in some player's deaths. Most of these issues are dose-dependent, the most common being elevated blood pressure, especially in those with pre-existing hypertension, and harmful changes in cholesterol levels: some steroids cause an increase in LDL cholesterol and a decrease in HDL cholesterol. Anabolic steroids such as testosterone also increase the risk of cardiovascular disease or coronary artery disease. Acne is fairly common among anabolic steroid users, mostly due to stimulation of the sebaceous glands by increased testosterone levels. Conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) can accelerate the rate of premature baldness for those who are genetically predisposed.\nOther side effects can include alterations in the structure of the heart, such as enlargement and thickening of the left ventricle, which impairs its contraction and relaxation. Possible effects of these alterations in the heart are hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, heart attacks, and sudden cardiac death. These changes are also seen in non-drug using athletes, but steroid use may accelerate this process. However, both the connection between changes in the structure of the left ventricle and decreased cardiac function, as well as the connection to steroid use have been disputed.\nHigh doses of oral anabolic steroid compounds can cause liver damage as the steroids are metabolized (17α-alkylated) in the digestive system to increase their bioavailability and stability. When high doses of such steroids are used for long periods, the liver damage may be severe and lead to liver cancer.\nThere are also gender-specific side effects of anabolic steroids. Development of breast tissue in males, a condition called gynecomastia (which is usually caused by high levels of circulating estrogen), may arise because of increased conversion of testosterone to estrogen by the enzyme aromatase. Reduced sexual function and temporary infertility can also occur in males. Another male-specific side effect which can occur is testicular atrophy, caused by the suppression of natural testosterone levels, which inhibits production of sperm (most of the mass of the testes is developing sperm). This side effect is temporary: the size of the testicles usually returns to normal within a few weeks of discontinuing anabolic steroid use as normal production of sperm resumes. Along with this the use of anabolic steroids also leads to an increased risk for prostate cancer. Female-specific side effects include increases in body hair, deepening of the voice, enlarged clitoris, temporary decreases in menstrual cycles, and male pattern baldness. When taken during pregnancy, anabolic steroids can affect fetal development by causing the development of male features in the female fetus and female features in the male fetus. In teens anabolic steroids can stunt the growth at an early age due to high hormone levels signaling the body to stop bone growth and can also stunt the growth of teens if the teens use the steroids before their growth spurt.\nEven though anabolic steroids do not cause the same high as other drugs, they can lead to addiction. Studies have shown that animals will give themselves steroids when they have the chance, just as they do with other addictive drugs. People may continue to use steroids despite going through physical problems, and can cause family issues just like any other addictive drug. These behaviors show steroids' addictive potential. Research has found that some steroid users turn to other drugs, such as opioids, to reduce sleep problems and irritability caused by steroids. People who abuse steroids may go through withdrawal symptoms such as mood swings, fatigue, restlessness, loss of appetite, sleep problems, decrease of sex drive, and steroid cravings."

The Veterans Committee met in closed sessions to consider executives, managers, umpires, and earlier major league players. It selected three players: Roger Connor, Cal Hubbard, and Freddie Lindstrom. The Negro Leagues Committee also met in person and selected Oscar Charleston. A formal induction ceremony was held in Cooperstown, New York, on August 9, 1976, with Commissioner of Baseball Bowie Kuhn presiding.\nBBWAA election.\nThe BBWAA was authorized to elect players active in 1956 or later, but not after 1970; the ballot included candidates from the 1975 ballot who received at least 5% of the vote but were not elected, along with selected players, chosen by a screening committee, whose last appearance was in 1970. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote.\nVoters were instructed to cast votes for up to 10 candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall.

        "text": "The Kansas State Wildcats women's basketball program is the intercollegiate basketball program of the Kansas State Wildcats. The program is classified in the NCAA Division I, and the team competes in the Big 12 Conference.\nThe team has been invited to 22 NCAA and AIAW tournaments (second-most among Big 12 teams), and was crowned champion of the 2006 Women's National Invitation Tournament. Kansas State is in the top 20 all-time for wins among Division I programs.\nThe team's head coach is Jeff Mittie. He was hired before the 2014–2015 season, after spending the prior fifteen seasons at TCU.\nHistory.\nKansas State began offering women's basketball as an organized intercollegiate sport in the 1968–1969 school year, under head coach Judy Akers. Because the NCAA did not sponsor women's sports until 1982, the governing bodies for women's basketball in the earliest years were the Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (CIAW) and the AIAW.\nThe Big Eight Conference likewise did not sponsor women's basketball in its earliest years, so Kansas State competed against the University of Kansas, Wichita State, and other state schools for the \"Kansas State Conference\" championship. Kansas State won eight straight Kansas Conference titles, from 1972 to 1979. The Big Eight Conference began offering a mid-season basketball tournament in the 1975–1976 season, and then began sponsoring a regular season competition in 1982–1983. Kansas State won the first two Big Eight tournament titles, in 1976 and 1977, and then won the first two Big Eight regular season titles, in 1983 and 1984.\nThe longest-tenured and winningest head coach in team history is Deb Patterson. Patterson spent eighteen years at Kansas State and compiled a 350–226 () record. She won two Big 12 Conference titles (2004 and 2008) and a WNIT title (2006). Before Patterson, the winningest coach at Kansas State was Judy Akers, the first coach in program history, who compiled a 206–94 () record. Akers also captured eight Kansas State Conference titles (1972-1979) and the first two titles in the Big Eight Conference after it began sponsoring women's basketball (1976 and 1977 mid-season tournaments).\nPostseason history.\nAIAW tournament results.\nThe Wildcats appeared in six AIAW tournaments prior to the creation of the NCAA tournament. In 1971, Kansas State also appeared in the even earlier tournament sponsored by the Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (CIAW), advancing to the Elite Eight.\nThe Wildcats had a combined record of 7–10.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe first tournament the NCAA sponsored was the 1982 edition. Kansas State has appeared in 17 NCAA tournaments since that time, with a record of 13–16.&lt;includeonly&gt;13-16 RECORD DOES NOT INCLUDE 2022&lt;/includeonly&gt;\nWNIT results.\nKansas State has appeared in the Women's National Invitation Tournament eight times, including the first tournament held, in 1969. Kansas State won the tournament in 2006 and reached the semifinals (final four) again in 2007 and 2013."

        "text": "The 1960 U.S. Open was the 60th U.S. Open, held June 16–18 at Cherry Hills Country Club in Cherry Hills Village, Colorado, a suburb of Denver. Arnold Palmer staged the greatest comeback in U.S. Open history, erasing a seven-stroke deficit during the final round to win his only U.S. Open title. It is remembered as a crossroads for the three primary contenders in the final round: Palmer, Ben Hogan, and amateur Jack Nicklaus, three of the greatest players in the history of golf.\nHaving already won the Masters, Palmer was half-way to the single-season Grand Slam with his win at Cherry Hills. His quest ended three weeks later at the British Open, when he lost to Kel Nagle by one stroke at St Andrews. Two weeks later, he finished five strokes back in a tie for seventh at the PGA Championship, the only major that eluded him for his career. This was Palmer's only victory at the U.S. Open; he finished second four times, including three losses in playoffs in 1962, 1963, and 1966.\nThis was the third major championship at Cherry Hills, which previously hosted the U.S. Open in 1938 and the PGA Championship in 1941. The U.S. Open returned in 1978 and the PGA Championship in 1985. The average elevation of the course exceeds above sea level.\nCourse layout.\nLengths of the course for previous major championships:\nRound summaries.\nFirst round.\n\"Thursday, June 16, 1960\"\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, June 17, 1960\"\nAmateurs: \"Cherry (-1), Nicklaus (E)\", Beman (+6), Fowler (+6), Courtney (+7), Coody (+8), Kocsis (+8), Carmichael (+9), Chapman (+11), Schmidt (+12), Wright (+12), Donohue (+13), Weber (+13), English (+14), Konsek (+14), Moore (+15), Welauffer (+15), Gardner (+16), Rose (+17), Eisinger Jr (+19), Hane (+20).\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, June 18, 1960 - (morning)\"\nFinal round.\n\"Saturday, June 18, 1960 - (afternoon)\"\nPalmer trailed leader Mike Souchak by eight strokes after 36 holes, and by seven shots after 54 holes. Almost everyone believed he was out of contention beginning the final round, tied for fifteenth place. Palmer drove the green on the par-4 1st to set up a two-putt birdie, then chipped in from for birdie at the second. After nearly making an eagle at 3 and tapping in for another birdie, he holed an 18-footer for birdie at 4 then made two more birdies at 6 and 7. He cooled off the rest of his round, finally carding a 65 (−6) for a 280 (−4) total.\nTwenty-year-old Jack Nicklaus, the reigning U.S. Amateur champion playing in his fourth Open, was also in contention during the final round, briefly holding the lead after making eagle at 5 and birdie at 9. Two three-putts on the back-nine dropped him to a 282 (−2) total, two strokes behind Palmer. His second-place finish was the best showing by an amateur at the U.S. Open since Johnny Goodman won in 1933. Aiming for a record fifth U.S. Open title at age 47, Ben Hogan was tied for the lead on the 71st tee, a par 5. On his third shot he hit a wedge on to the green but it spun back all the way off the green into the confines of the water hazard fronting the green and made bogey. Needing birdie to tie on 18, he again found water, triple-bogeyed, and finished in a tie for ninth place. Souchak shot a final round 75 on his way to a tie for third.\nScorecard.\nArnold Palmer's final round 65 (−6)"

        "title": "Nine-pin bowling",
        "text": "Nine-pin bowling (also known as ninepin bowling, nine-pin, kegel, or kegeln) is a bowling game played primarily in Europe. European championships are held each year. In Europe overall, there are some 130,000 players. Nine-pin bowling lanes are mostly found in Austria, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Estonia, Switzerland, Serbia, Slovenia, Croatia, Poland, North Macedonia, Hungary, France, Brazil and Liechtenstein. \nIn English-speaking countries, where ten-pin bowling (which originated in the United States) is dominant, facilities for nine-pin bowling are uncommon, though it remains popular in areas such as the Barossa Valley in South Australia where many German people settled in the 19th century. A modified version is played in the US state of Texas.\nEuropean version.\nEquipment.\nThis game is played by rolling a ball down an alley towards nine pins. There are three variations of lane shape:\nThe nine pins are placed in a square shape whose diagonal coincides with the axis of the lane. In modern systems the pins are reset by a pinsetter which lifts up the pins, each connected by a string on top, and lowers them back into the square shape for the next throw. The pins usually have a weight of approximately .\nThe ball is in diameter and weighs approximately . (For younger or novice players, the ball is and weighs .) Unlike the ball used for ten-pin bowling, but like the ones used for other \"small-ball\" forms of bowling such as five-pin, candlepin and duckpin, the nine-pin ball has no finger holes, although there are also special balls with two finger holes designed for novice and amateur players.\nScoring.\nThe game is played by taking 120 throws across four lanes. Each player takes 30 throws on each lane. The pins are reset after each throw for the first 15 throws, while the pins are reset on the next 15 throws only after all the pins are knocked down (fallen pins remain out of play until no pins are left). After 30 throws are completed at each lane, players shift to the next lane to the right (except for the player in fourth lane, who moves to the first lane) until the match is over. Pins are added up for each throw.\nMatches may be played by individual players, where the overall winner is the player with the most pins after all lanes are played, or in a team format. \nTeams are composed of six players, with four players starting the match and two substitutions allowed. Players compete against each other for team points. A player who knocks down more pins on a lane gets one set point (each player gets a half point for a draw). The player with more set points after all four lanes are played gets a team point. If they have two set points each after bowling in each of the four lanes, the player with the higher total number of pins gets the team point. If they have the same number of pins, each team gets one-half team point. Players then rotate which member of the opposing team they play against. The team with more team points after all opponent pairings have been completed wins the match. Matches can end in ties.\nLeague play is organized in many World Ninepin Bowling Association member countries, and national championships are held in many countries.\nWorld records.\n\"Updated 10 June 2019.\"\nAmerican version.\nOrigins.\nStandardized rules and organization of nine-pins were developed by the American Bowling Congress in 1895. Nine-pins was the most popular form of bowling in much of the United States from colonial times until the 1830s, when several cities in the United States banned nine-pin bowling out of moral panic over the supposed destruction of the work ethic, gambling, and organized crime. Ten-pin bowling is said to have been invented in order to meet the letter of these laws, even with evidence of outdoor bowling games in 1810 England being bowled with ten pins set in an equilateral triangle as is done today in ten-pin bowling. \nToday, nine-pin bowling has disappeared from all of the United States except Texas, where, by 1837, ninepin alleys were numerous enough that rather than a ban, the 1st Congress of the Republic of Texas chose to subject them to an annual tax of $150 (), and all forms of bowling have remained legal and subject to taxation in Texas ever since. By World War I most Texas bowling establishments, both private and commercial, had changed to ten-pin. However, nine-pin remained popular in predominantly German communities like Fredericksburg, New Braunfels and Bulverde, until the introduction of fully automated pin-setting machinery in the 1950s caused most of them to make the change as well. Those bowlers who still preferred the teamwork and camaraderie of nine-pins then moved to the nine-pins clubs in small outlying communities of Bexar, Comal, and Guadalupe counties.\nEquipment.\nThe American variation of nine-pin bowling is played with the same lane as in conventional ten-pin bowling. The difference is the lack of automatic pinsetter and electronic scoring system. Both of these are done manually, similar to how ten-pin bowling was in the early 20th century. The lane is usually under a \"dry lane\" condition (without oil), or rarely oiled in \"typical house shot\", allowing players to release a hook ball in a similar fashion as ten-pin bowling. The pins used in the Texas version of nine-pins are the same dimensions as those used in ten-pins, and the bowlers use ten-pin balls, with finger and thumb holes drilled in them.\nScoring.\nScoring in nine-pin is also different. Each frame begins with a \"full house\". If a bowler knocks down all nine pins in a \"full house\", that bowler has achieved a \"nine-ringer\" and is given a score of 9 with a circle around it. There are no additional points for a \"ringer\". If a bowler knocks down all the pins except for the center pin in a \"full house\", that bowler has achieved a \"twelve-ringer\" and is given a score of 12 with a circle around it. If a bowler’s roll does not result in either “9” or “12” points, that bowler’s roll is given a “-“ (dash) or a “√” (check) which carries no point value.\nThe one exception to this is the last ball rolled by the last bowler in the frame. This bowler will receive credit for the number of pins knocked down. For example, if the last bowler has rolled their second ball for this frame, and three pins remain standing (six pins knocked down), that bowler will receive credit for those six pins, regardless if that bowler knocked these six pins down or not.\nWhen a bowler takes a turn and knocks down the remaining pins, that bowler receives nine points for that shot, regardless of the number of pins knocked down to receive these nine points.\nIf a bowler knocks down the remaining pins, except for the center pin, that bowler receives 12 points for that shot regardless of the number of pins knocked down to receive those 12 points.\nBecause bowlers face the pins their teammates have left, the better teams are those who have a mix of bowlers that can hit the left side, hit the right side, or can \"roll ringers\". This leads to specialization. A good team captain can also help their team by sending the bowlers in the order that maximizes their success."

Their statutes and regulations were officialized at 16 December 1963. It is affiliated to the Olympic Committee of Chile, the Confederación Sudamericana de Rugby, FIRA and World Rugby. In July 2022 the men's national team defeated the USA to qualify for the 2023 Rugby World Cup in France, the first time the country has qualified for the competition. Following this the team reached an all time high world ranking of 21.\nHistory.\nRugby was first introduced into South America in the late 19th century by British immigrants, but this was mainly in Brazil and neighbouring Argentina.\nIt was introduced by the British in the 19th century. It is believed that the first people who played it in Chile were the English who worked at the saltmines in Iquique. Rugby was also developed by the English private colleges. For many years it was a sport mostly played by the upper classes in Chile. The first teams appeared in Valparaíso and Santiago de Chile, who later formed the Unión de Rugby de Chile. The British influence can be noticed by the fact that several of the main Chilean teams have English names.\nSome rugby did trickle across the border from Argentina, but it was not until the 1920s that the game really became established, around Santiago and Valparaíso.\nDuring the 1950s, Chile was visited by the Irish tour of 1952 and a 1954 French tour.\nChilean delegates were amongst those who went to the centenary congress of the International Rugby Football Board in 1986.\nIn South America, with the dominance of Argentina, Chile used to consider itself the best of the rest. This was confirmed in many people's minds when Chile won the second place in the 1981 South American Championship in the absence of Argentina. However, of the other South American nations only Uruguay The Only One That Had qualified for the Rugby World Cup Until 2022 When Chile Qualified To Its First Rugby World Cup by beating USA Rugby 52-51 .\nIn the late 1980s, former French coach Jean-Pierre Juanchich became national administrator of the sport, lending it some extra credibility. During the 1980s, Chilean rugby participation increased by 400%, and whereas it was previously confined to the cities of Santiago and Valparaíso, it began to spread throughout the country.\nFlight 571 &amp; \"Alive\".\nThe tragic crash of Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571, and the resulting books and films, \"\" and \"Alive\" brought Uruguayan and Chilean rugby into the global limelight. The Uruguayans were on tour, and had played several games in Argentina, and were due to play some return matches in Chile.\n\"Alive\" tells the story of a Uruguayan Rugby team (who were alumni of Stella Maris College (Montevideo)) and their friends and family who were involved in the airplane crash of Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571 which crashed into the Andes mountains on October 13, 1972. It was published two years after survivors of the crash were rescued.\nNational team.\nThe Chile national rugby union team, known as \"Los Condores\" (\"The Condors\") it is currently ranked 25th in the World Rugby Rankings, and it is the third best team from South America, after Argentina and Uruguay.\nWomen's rugby.\nAlthough Chile's women have not yet played test match rugby, they have been playing international sevens rugby since 2004.

        "text": "The 2009 Daytona 500, the 51st running of the event, was held on February 15, 2009, at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida as the first points-paying race of the 2009 NASCAR Sprint Cup season and the last 500 of the 2000s decade. The race was won by Matt Kenseth, making a car numbered 17 winning the race for the first time in 20 years since Darrell Waltrip's win back in 1989 and the first Daytona 500 win for Roush Fenway Racing. The race was called off with 48 laps to go after a severe rainstorm that had been lingering throughout the area hit the track.\nThis marks the first Daytona 500 without The Petty family and the first without Dale Jarrett since 1990.\nDefending champions.\nFor the first time since 1981, the defending race champion driver and the team have been split. Ryan Newman, the champion driver, drove for Stewart Haas Racing in the No. 39 Chevrolet Impala. The team that he won with, Penske Racing, fielded the No. 12 Dodge Charger with David Stremme behind the wheel.\nThe last time a driver and team split was when Buddy Baker drove for Harry Ranier Racing in winning the 1980 event, but the next year was the driver of Hoss Ellington's No. 1.\nFormer winners Kevin Harvick (2007), Michael Waltrip (2001, 2003), Jeff Gordon (1997, 1999, 2005), Bill Elliott (1985, 1987), Dale Earnhardt Jr. (2004), Jimmie Johnson (2006), and Ryan Newman (2008) did race in the event finishing second, seventh, thirteenth, twenty-third, twenty-seventh, thirty-first, and thirty-sixth respectively. Derrike Cope (1990) and Geoff Bodine (1986), also former winners, failed to qualify.\nQualifying.\nThe Daytona 500 is the only event with a unique qualifying system on the NASCAR circuit. In the primary qualifying, only the front row (the pole position and the second-fastest driver) are locked into the race positions. Since 2005, NASCAR's top 35 owners points standings from the previous season automatically qualify those teams (not the drivers) into the event. The top two teams that are not within the owners' Top 35 automatically qualify in the Gatorade Duels, a pair of races. This is followed by a combination of last years' owners' points, pole qualifying speed and if needed, a past champions' provisional fills out the field.\nQualifying• One round of NASCAR Sprint Cup Series timed qualifying will be held. Each team may run two laps with the fast lap setting the qualifying time. The two fastest qualifiers set starting positions one and two and are the only guaranteed positions, filling the front row for the Daytona 500.\n• The Gatorade Duels, the 150-mile qualifying races, will determine starting positions for the Daytona 500 beyond the front row. In the event of cancellation, the field will be set according to the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Rule Book.\nGatorade Duel Assignment\n• The eligible highest ranked 35 in 2008 car owner points will be assigned to Gatorade Duel races based on their standing in the 2008 final car owner points. Odd-numbered owner points will compete in the first Gatorade Duel; even-numbered owners will compete in the second. The only exception is that the fastest\nqualifier will start on the pole in the first Gatorade Duel and the second-fastest will start on the pole in the second, regardless of 2008 car owner point standings.\n• Owners who failed to finish in the top 35 of the 2008 car owner points will be assigned to a Gatorade Duel based on qualifying times – the highest qualifying owner to the first Duel; the next to the second and alternating through the remaining entries. Starting positions for the Gatorade Duels are based on\nqualifying times.\nDaytona 500 Lineup\n• Finishing positions in the Gatorade Duels will determine starting positions in the Daytona 500 once the two fastest qualifiers will start on the front row of the Daytona 500 based on their qualifying times, regardless of their finish in the Duels. Based on their finish in the first Duel, the eligible highest ranked 35 in car owner points plus the two highest finishing non-top 35 teams will be lined up in the odd-number starting positions. Based on their finish in the second Duel, the eligible highest ranked 35 in car owner points plus the two highest finishing non-top 35 teams will be lined up in the even-number starting\npositions.\n• The remaining positions will be filled based on qualifying times beginning with the next available position.\n• The composition of the front row will reduce the above numbers. If there are top-35 teams on the front row, the number of guaranteed starters is reduced accordingly. If there are no top-35 teams on the front row, the number of cars that get in based on time is reduced accordingly.\n• The 43rd starting position will be assigned to any car owner who has the most recent eligible past NASCAR Sprint Cup champion as long as the past champion competed in the 2008 NASCAR Sprint Cup season. If the 43rd position is not used by a past champion, it will be assigned to the next highest qualifying time.\nRecap\nThe bottom line – for the 2009 Daytona 500 – is that the top-two qualifiers are in. The remaining top-35 guaranteed starters are in. Four drivers will make the field based on their performance in the duels and the remaining positions will be filled based on qualifying times or being a past champion.\nRace summary.\nPre-Race.\nCountry singer Keith Urban performed a concert on the infield singing \"Days Go By\", \"Sweet Thing\", and \"Better Life\". Urban tossed his guitar pick into the crowd at the end of his performance. The first episode of the miniseries \"The Adventures of Digger and Friends\" premiered during the FOX pre-race coverage; Keith Urban's \"Little Digger,\" the theme song to \"The Adventures of Digger and Friends,\" also premiered. However, from there on, Digger would draw much opposition, including sites, forums, and blogs warning FOX about his use.\nThe Grand Marshal was the Florida Governor Charlie Crist. RCA Records recording artist Gavin DeGraw sang the USA National Anthem, and actor Tom Cruise drove the 2010 Chevrolet Camaro pace car to the start of the race.\nRace.\nDuring the drivers' meeting, NASCAR announced there would be a competition caution on lap 25 because of overnight rain. Despite threatening weather, the race started at 3:30 pm, with the green flag at 3:41 pm, waved by three-time champion Bobby Allison as the \"Martin and Martin\" front row led the field to the start of the race. Martin Truex Jr. led the first lap and Mark Martin led the next one before being passed by Kyle Busch. The first caution came out on lap 9 when Aric Almirola got tapped from behind by David Ragan and spun near the entrance to pit road, nearly collecting Travis Kvapil. The race restarted on lap 11, with Busch still leading; Busch would remain there until lap 53 when Dale Earnhardt Jr. passed him for the lead. With the help of his Busch (his former teammate), Tony Stewart passed Earnhardt Jr. for the lead while entering turn 4. Shortly after, Travis Kvapil smacked the wall twice on lap 55, bringing out the third caution. Earnhardt Jr. missed his pit stall and lost a lap because he was forced to pit again. Tony Stewart came out of the pits with the lead, until being passed by Jeff Gordon on lap 70. On lap 72, Ryan Newman was in the pits changing tires under green flag conditions when somehow the car fell off the jack while changing the left-side tires. Newman's crew had to use two jacks to lift the car off the ground and complete the pit stop. On lap 80, Daytona 500 rookie Joey Logano avoided Scott Speed losing control out of turn 4 but made contact with the front of Greg Biffle's car, causing him to crash head-on into the inside retaining wall on the front stretch, ending his day. Busch won the race off pit road edging ahead of his teammate Denny Hamlin by over half a car length, while Hermie Sadler reported bad weather about 40 minutes away from the track.\nGreen flag pit stops began on lap 113 when Gordon over tire wear concerns, and his crew changed tires on lap 113, with the rest of the field on lap 119. David Stremme blew a tire on pit road as soon as his teammates Reed Sorenson and Elliott Sadler exited. Sadler wound up in 2nd and Sorenson in 3rd while the entire field had to pit one lap later. Earnhardt Jr. mistakingly made his second pit stop in Lap 121 by completing his pit stop with his right front tire over the outside boundary line of his pit box, resulting in a one-lap penalty.\nOn lap 124, the race for the beneficiary resulted in the \"Big One\". This began when Earnhardt Jr. spun Brian Vickers into traffic toward the end of the backstretch, collecting race dominator Busch and his brother Kurt, Robby Gordon, Jamie McMurray, Carl Edwards, Denny Hamlin, Scott Speed, and Earnhardt Jr.'s teammate Jimmie Johnson. R. Gordon's car slid in front of Earnhardt Jr. within a couple of feet of contact. Many of Earnhardt Jr.'s fans, the Daytona 500 participants, and the drivers believed that the contact was done intentionally; and many fans (including those of the No. 88 fans) and drivers (such as Vickers, Ku. and Ky. Busch, R. Gordon, Hamlin, and McMurray gave NASCAR requests and calls to black-flag Earnhardt Jr. Earnhardt was penalized on two counts by NASCAR; first, he was sent to the tail end of the longest line for overaggressive driving, and the ensuing penalty meant he was not granted the beneficiary as a result. (A driver cannot cause the caution to be granted the beneficiary.) Brian Vickers was angry and said when interviewed \"To wreck somebody intentionally like that in front of the entire field is really kind of dangerous. That's my biggest problem with it. But, apparently, (Earnhardt Jr.) wanted a caution pretty bad.\" Both Vickers and Earnhardt Jr. were a lap down before the wreck occurred, and Earnhardt Jr. was unaware that he was battling Vickers for the position. At this time, Kevin Harvick pushed Matt Kenseth into a battle for first between Kenseth and Sadler. On lap 138, Jeff Burton smacked the wall, collecting Paul Menard. Burton was then black-flagged for having a piece of sheetmetal hanging from his bumper.\nOn lap 146, Matt Kenseth took the lead from Sadler a lap after the action resumed. Almirola was then spun by Kasey Kahne after Almirola made contact with Sam Hornish Jr. on the backstretch. At this time, rain began to fall on the track under the yellow. On lap 152, the cars came into pit road under the red flag. Some drivers exited their cars while others, including Kenseth, remained in theirs. During the red flag period, asked what happened with Brian Vickers, Dale Earnhardt Jr. said, \"I got a run on him and he (Vickers) saw me coming. I had a big old run on him and I went to the inside. I didn't try to make any late move and make some kind of surprise or anything. I just kind of ease on over and he went to block me and hit me in the fender sending us both off, sent me down into the grass and I tried to recover my car. I got back into him coming back into the racetrack.\" When asked what happened was accidental, Earnhardt Jr. was unrepentant and said, \"Yeah, it was accidental. I didn't want to wreck the field.\" Later that week, Earnhardt Jr. gave a public apology for the incident and decided that he should have thought before he made his move that obviously would have crashed Vickers.\nAt 6:49 pm. EST, sixteen minutes after the start of the red flag, NASCAR officials decided to call the race declaring Kenseth as the winner. \"It's going to be really wet out here because I'm crying like a baby,\" said Kenseth moments after the race was called. \"I tell you what, after last year, winning a race means a lot to me,\" Kenseth later said who was winless in 2008. Harvick, winner of the Bud Shootout, was second. Richard Petty Motorsports drivers A. J. Allmendinger (#44), Sadler (#19), and Reed Sorenson (#43) finished 3rd, 5th, and 9th respectively. Michael Waltrip had the best finishing Toyota in the 7th. Stewart was 8th in his first race as a driver and team owner. Truex Jr. finished 11th, J. Gordon (Gatorade Duel No. 1 winner) finished 13th, Marcos Ambrose (in his first 500 starts) finished 17th, Johnson (the defending Series champion) finished 31st, Speed (the high-finishing rookie) finished 35th, Ryan Newman (the defending 500 winners) finished 36th, Ky. Busch (who led the most laps at 88 and won Gatorade Duel #2) finished 41st because of him being involved in the lap 124 multi-car crash, and Logano (also in his first Daytona 500 start also) finished 43rd."

        "text": "The FIFA World Cup is said to have a significant impact on the host country's economy.\nUnited States (1994).\n in the United States was, as usual, hosted in a number of cities. In Los Angeles, site of the final, there was a total economic profit of $623 million that went directly into the metropolitan economy. In comparison, in the same year the Super Bowl only accounted for $182 million (Nodell). These figures were calculated over just the one-month period in which these games took place. In California alone, reports from the Pasadena Convention and Visitors Bureau conclude that 1,700 part-time jobs became available during the preparation and duration of the event (Deady). New York City, San Francisco, and Boston received combined revenue of $1.045 billion. The overall increases from the previous year on hotels and on food and beverages were 10% and 15%. This money spent on hotels and restaurants helped the entire U.S. economy.\nIn addition to the direct impacts of the 1994 World Cup, there were also indirect impacts: in order to host the Cup the United States had to develop a national soccer league, resulting in the formation of Major League Soccer (MLS) in 1996. Construction of new facilities, sponsorship of new teams, and the revenue of the ticket sales all resulted in economic boosts. The newly introduced professional league engendered one of the fastest growing youth sports in the country. Youth soccer took off and the selling of apparel and gear for the sport was an opportunity for private businesses.\nSouth Korea / Japan (2002).\nIn the 2002 World Cup, several other advantages were discovered when the competition was split between Japan and Korea. This was the first time the tournament had been hosted in two countries, with 32 matches played in each country and a total of 64 matches. With the three million live spectators ticket sales were 1.2 billion dollars. FIFA promised each country $110 million for hosting and all revenue from their ticket sales. \nEach country expanded their 20 soccer facilities, with a total investment of $4.7 billion. A host country can also see value in the national exposure, with so many people viewing and attending the event.\nIt was predicted prior to the 2002 Cup that the England team's absence would cost the economy $4.7 billion in lost output, or about 0.3% of their GDP (Gross Domestic Product) were they to win the entire tournament. Should the England team lose in just the first two weeks however, the losses were only expected to reach a total of 1.8 billion.\nGermany (2006).\nThe 2006 World Cup was judged a success comparable to that of the 1994 US World Cup. The German government reported that tourism revenue over the month of the World Cup was up roughly 400 million dollars. They made about 3 billion more dollars in retail such as jerseys and other paraphernalia regarding the Cup. Lastly, a reported 500,000 new jobs were yielded in preparation for the tournament. This impact sends ripples through an economy. Restaurants and bars were full to capacity at all hours of the tournament, and 15 million more spectators arrived in Germany than was expected.\nThis success drew attention to the German professional league, the Bundesliga. As a result, sales of tickets and team paraphernalia have increased dramatically. Many global corporations witnessed the craze in Germany during the World Cup and in recognizing the country's passion for the sport they have begun to sponsor many more German teams than prior to 2006. The global viewing of Bundesliga games has increased as well, helping these sponsors and German telecasters the profits they were expecting.\nThe 2006 World Cup had an operating budget (for staging the event, not inclusive of capital infrastructure costs) of €425 million. The German Football Association announced a profit before tax of €135 million. After tax and repaying the FIFA contribution of €40.8 million - the net profit was €56.6 million which was distributed to the German Football Association and the German Football League.\nFor Germany 2006 that the host country was entitled to the gross receipts of all ticket sales. In October 2007 FIFA announced : reassumed responsibility for ticket sales and will establish a company named '2010 FIFA World Cup Ticketing Ltd' to this end.\".\nSouth Africa (2010).\nThe 2010 FIFA World Cup was held in South Africa, for the first time in the tournament's history. Even though it may not have attracted as many foreign visitors as the US and Germany World Cups, it did have an economic benefit due to the location and already emerging economy.\nAny predictions about the economic impact of the 2010 FIFA World Cup on South Africa had to take into account the state of the South African economy, which still has one of the largest disparities between the rich and the poor. One main factor for South Africa is attracting international investors. To increase the international trade and foreign direct investment, South Africa must have stability throughout their whole region in their economy and government. If this is achieved then South Africa could be in the top choices for foreign direct investment and collect the potential benefits of the 2010 FIFA games. Because FIFA gathers all of its finances through marketing tournaments such as the World Cup, they aim to ensure the event's success, and assist the hosting country accordingly. Since South Africa is still a developing country, FIFA will have an important role in funding the tournament. Along with other developing countries that host mega-events, the investment of larger capital investment is required.\nThe projected total direct economic value for GDP is approximately R 21.3 billion. Also, 159,000 new jobs are predicted, including full- and part- time jobs, both permanent and temporary. The government also plans to spend millions on upgrading stadiums and building a new international airport. The tournament will host 32 teams with an average of 50 people per team, 14,500 VIPs and dignitaries, 500 officials and 10,500 media. A projected number of half a million foreign visitors (located outside of Africa) are expected and staying an average of 15 days.\nBrazil (2014).\nIn 2014, the FIFA World Cup was hosted in Brazil. This decision was based on location and close evaluation through various economical models. After years of unnecessary construction, eminent domain and countless protests, Brazil was found to be in a worse state than before. Costs of the tournament totalled $11.6 billion, making it the most expensive World Cup to date, until surpassed by 2018 FIFA World Cup which cost an estimated $14.2 billion. FIFA was expected to spend US$2 billion on staging the finals, with its greatest single expense being the US$576 million prize money pot. That money could have been allocated to other departments of the inner communities of this country including health care and education to name a few.\nRussia (2018).\nRussia's official budget of 678 billion rubles spent on projects for the tournament is less than the $15bn spent by Brazil on the 2014 World Cup. FIFA has budgeted spending $791m on teams and players - including prize money, compensation, insurance for players injured on national-team duty, and the preparation costs for the 32 featured teams.\n2018/2022 World Cup winning bids.\nOn 2 December 2010, Russia and Qatar were awarded the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, respectively.\nThe United States was a bidder for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, although questions were being raised about the US bid and whether its economic impact on the US would in fact be as favorable as promised. A new report argues that the US World Cup in 1994 lost billions of dollars despite a positive economic impact estimate, noted that the same company is creating the estimate for the current bid, and predicts that a 2022 US World Cup could again lose billions of dollars in lost in revenue."

        "title": "Variations of golf",
        "text": "Variations of golf include methods of scoring, starting procedures, playing formats, golf games, and activities based on or similar to the sport of golf which involve golf-like skills or goals.\nSome variations are essentially identical to golf, but with only minor differences or focusing on a specific aspect of the game, while others are more distant and arguably not simple variations but distinct games. Many of these variations are played in non-professional settings, without the presence of officials and sometimes without strict adherence to any official rules. Sometimes the rules are in place to provide a structure for side-betting that is independent of the final \"traditional\" score.\nScoring formats.\nStroke play.\nIn stroke play, the score is derived by counting the total number of strokes taken.\nMatch play.\nIn match play, the score is derived by counting the total number of holes \"won\" and subtracting the number of holes \"lost\".\nStableford.\nUnder the Stableford scoring system the player gains points according to the number of strokes taken on each hole in relation to par. Standard scoring is 1 point for a bogey, 2 points for a par, 3 points for a birdie, 4 points for an eagle. The points achieved for each hole of the round or tournament are added to produce the total points score, and the player with the highest score wins.\nIn Modified Stableford, the standard Stableford system is altered to use different point levels.  For example, in professional golf at the Barracuda Championship on the PGA Tour, the points system is:  plus 8 for an albatross, plus 5 for an eagle, plus 2 for a birdie, 0 points for par, minus 1 for a bogey, and minus 3 for a double bogey or worse.\nPar and bogey.\nIn par and bogey competitions each participant competes in match play against the course. On each hole, the player competes against par or bogey (in the traditional sense), and \"wins\" if they score a birdie or better, \"lose\" if they score a bogey or worse, and \"halve\" by scoring par. The player with the best win–loss differential is the winner.\nPlaying formats.\nIn addition to playing as an individual, golf affords the opportunity to play in many pairs and team formats.\nFoursomes.\nFoursomes, or \"alternate shot\", is a pairs format. Each pair has only one ball in play and players alternate playing strokes until the hole is completed. Foursomes can be played as match play or stroke play.\nA variant of foursomes is \"greensomes\", also called \"Scotch Foursomes\" or \"modified alternate shot\". In greensomes, both players tee off and then select which ball with which to complete the hole. The player who did not hit the chosen first shot plays the second shot and play then alternates as in foursomes. A variant of greensomes, often referred to as \"gruesomes\" or \"bloodsomes\", is sometimes played where the opposing team chooses which of their opponent's tee shots they should use, usually the worse one which may even be unplayable. Play then continues as in greensomes.\nAnother variation of foursomes is \"Chapman\", also known as Pinehurst or American Foursomes. Under Chapman rules, both players tee off and then play their partner's ball for the second shot before alternately taking strokes having selected the ball with which to complete the hole; the next (third) stroke is played by the player who hit the chosen ball from the tee.\nFour-ball.\nFour-ball (also known as \"better-ball\", and sometimes best-ball) is a pairs format. Each player plays their own ball, with the better of the two scores on each hole counting as the pair's score. Four-ball can be played as match play or stroke play.\nBest ball.\nIn \"best ball\", each member of the team plays their own ball as normal, but the lowest/best score of all the players on the team counts as the team's score on each hole.\nVariations of best ball include \"Bowmaker\", \"1-2-3 Best Ball\" (or \"ChaChaCha\"), \"Fourball Alliance\", \"Arizona Shuffle\" and \"Low Ball/High Ball\"; in each of these formats a set number of the players scores count for the team on each hole.\nThe term best ball is also sometimes used when referring to four-ball.\nScramble.\nIn a \"scramble\" each player in a team tees off on each hole, and the players decide which shot was best. Every player then plays their second shot from within a clublength of where the best ball has come to rest, and the procedure is repeated until the hole is finished. The format is used in the PGA Tour's QBE Shootout and Father/Son Challenge, titled since 2020 as the PNC Championship.\nThere are many variations on the scramble format. Commonly played ones include \"Ambrose\", which uses net scoring with a team handicap; \"Florida scramble\", where after each stroke the player whose ball is selected does not play the next one; and \"Texas scramble\", in which a set number of each team member's tee shots must be used. In a \"champagne scramble\" or \"shamble\" each player tees off on each hole before selecting the best drive and completing the hole in using a variation of best-ball format.\nPatsome.\n\"Patsome\" is played in pairs with holes being played in a rotation of four-ball, greensomes and foursomes formats. Typically, the first six holes will be four-ball, the next six greensomes, and the final six foursomes.\nGolf games and betting.\nNassau.\nThe Nassau is three bets in one: best score on the front nine, best score on the back nine and best score over the full 18. The Nassau is perhaps the most common bet among golfers and can be applied to all standard scoring formats.\nSkins.\nIn a skins game, golfers compete on each hole as a separate contest. The player with the best outright score on each hole wins the \"skin\", which is prize money in the professional game or a wager for amateurs. If the hole is tied by any number of the competitors, the skin rolls over to the next hole so that it is then worth two skins. It is common for the value of the skins to increase as the round progresses.\nNines.\n\"Nines\", or \"9-points\", is a variant of match play typically played among threesomes, where each hole is worth a total of nine points. The player with the lowest score on a hole receives five points, the next-lowest score 3 and the next-lowest score 1. Ties are generally resolved by summing the points contested and dividing them among the tying players; a two-way tie for first is worth four points to both players, a two-way tie for second is worth two points to both players, and a three-way tie is worth three points to each player. The player with the highest score after 18 holes (in which there are 162 points to be awarded) wins the game. This format can be used to wager on the game systematically; players each contribute the same amount of money to the pot, and a value is assigned to each point scored (or each point after 18) based on the amount of money in the pot, with any overage going to the overall winner.\nA variation on nines is \"sixes\", or \"split sixes\", in which six points are available on each hole, awarded 4-2-0 with ties resolved as in nines.\nBingo Bango Bongo.\nBingo Bango Bongo is a points-based game that can be played by two or more players or teams. In Bingo Bango Bongo, three types of achievements are rewarded with a point: first player to get their ball on the green (bingo), closest to the hole once all balls are on the green (bango), first to hole out (bongo). The player with the lowest outright score on hole wins 2 points, i.e. if 2 or more players tie no points are given out. At the end of the game the player with the most points wins. Bingo Bango Bongo is considered a game for skilled players, and its point-based scoring makes it a popular side-game for wagering.\nWolf.\nWolf is a golf game for groups of four. It is scored individually but played as 2-on-2 better-ball or 3-on-1 best-ball in teams that are determined at the start of each hole. The order of play from the tee is decided prior to the start and is kept throughout the round, except the starting player (the \"Wolf\") rotates each hole, i.e. if the order for hole 1 is ABCD, the order for hole 2 would then be BCDA, etc. Everyone plays individually, with each of the players on the team with the lowest individual score on each hole earning a point. After hole 16 the rotation has completed four times, and it is usual for the player in last place to be designated as the Wolf for the final two holes. The player with the most points at the end of the round wins.\nAt the start of each hole, the Wolf decides whether or not they want each of the other players as their team-mate for the hole immediately after each of them tee off. The Wolf may choose to reject all the other players, in which case the hole is played as 3 against 1 and the points are doubled. The wolf can also elect to be a \"Lone Wolf\" before their own tee shot, in which case the points are multiplied by 4, or after they have played but before the others, in which case the points are multiplied by 3.\nAcey deucey.\nAces and deuces, or acey deucey, is a bet in which there is a winner, two modest losers, and one big loser on each hole. A game for groups of four, the low scorer (\"ace\") on each hole wins a certain amount from each of the other three players; while the high scorer (\"deuce\") on each hole owes each of the other three. The ace is usually worth twice the deuce, and there is nothing for ties.\nRound robin.\nRound robin, also known as Hollywood or sixes, is a game for groups of four. Players compete against each other in pairs, rotating partners every six holes.\nCriers and whiners.\nCriers and whiners is known by many different names including No Alibis, Replay, Play it Again, and Mulligans. As the latter would suggest, it's a game of mulligans with handicaps being translated into the number of do-overs golfers are allowed during the round.\nSide bets.\nSandies.\nA betting game whereby any player making par after having been in a bunker on the hole wins points or money. The bunker can be at any spot on the hole, yet particulars are dependent on local rules.\nBarkies.\nBarkies, sometimes called Woodies or Seves (as in Seve Ballesteros), are paid automatically to any player who makes par on a hole on which they hit a tree. The value of a Barkie is determined before the round.\nArnies.\nArnies are side bets whose value should be determined prior to the round. They are won automatically by any golfer who makes a par without having managed to get their ball into the fairway. Named in honor of Arnold Palmer, who made quite a few \"Arnies\" in his time.\nStarting procedures.\nCompetition format and organization sometimes necessitate variations on the usual starting procedure, where everyone begins from the first tee and plays all holes in order through to the eighteenth, in order for the course to accommodate all competitors effectively.\nTwo-tee start.\nSome 18-hole courses are configured in loops, usually of 9 holes, that start and end close to the clubhouse which facilitate two or more starting points. In large field tournaments, especially on professional tours before the field is reduced by a cut, a two tee start is commonplace with the field being split between starting on the first tee and the tenth tee (sometimes the ninth or eleventh depending on proximity to the clubhouse).\nShotgun start.\nShotgun starts are mainly used for amateur tournament or society play, and allows all players to start and finish their round at roughly the same time. In this variant, each of the playing groups starts their game simultaneously on a different hole, for example a group starting on hole 5 will play through to the 18th hole and continue with hole 1, ending their round on hole 4.\nGolf based games.\nGolf based games may be minor adaptations of the sport, games focused on a specific skill, or hybrid games that integrate skill-sets and equipment from other sports or games. The term indoor golf encompasses a wide array of different golf related activities, including simulators and various practice facilities.\nSome games that retain most characteristics of golf but with some specific adaptations. For example, pitch and putt is played on courses made up of very short holes; hickory golf eschews much modern technology; beach golf and snow golf are played on very different surfaces to a normal golf course; park golf uses a special club, plastic resin ball and course; urban golf does not use a traditional golf course; and speed golf is simply golf against the clock, but played with a limited number of clubs.\nActivities that focus on a single aspect of golf include miniature golf which is a putting-based game, long drive where players compete to hit the ball the farthest, target golf where points are awarded corresponding to proximity to a target, and clock golf in which players putt to a single hole from each of 12 points arranged in a circle.\nGames based on golf but using items other than clubs and a golf ball, often incorporating skills from other activities, include disc golf, footgolf, fungo golf, codeball, dart golf, GolfCross, Sholf and Swingolf."

        "text": "City Without Baseball (; stylized: ; jyutping: mou4 je5 zi1 sing4) is a 2008 Hong Kong drama film starring Ron Heung and other members of the Hong Kong National Baseball Team. It is directed by South African-born Hong Kong filmmaker Lawrence Ah Mon, about a city where baseball is almost unknown, and where the team plays to empty stadia.\nThe film explores several themes traditionally regarded as 'taboo' in Hong Kong society. The film is the first of seven such films by Scud (the production-crediting name of Hong Kong writer/film producer Danny Cheng Wan-Cheung). The six later films are: \"Permanent Residence\" in 2009, \"Amphetamine\" in 2010, \"Love Actually... Sucks!\" in 2011, \"Voyage\" in 2013, \"Utopians\" in 2015 and \"Thirty Years of Adonis\" in 2017. His eighth film, \"Apostles\", was made in 2022, as was his ninth, \"Bodyshop\".\nHis tenth and final film, \"Naked Nations: Hong Kong Tribe\", is currently in production.\nPlot.\nThe actual members of the Hong Kong National Baseball Team appear in the film as themselves, in a story set in 2004. Their isolated existence leads them to take unconventional choices in both love and friendship, and to summon great courage in the face of their lonely and disconnected existence.\nThe story focuses on the easy-going, yet often detached, main character, \"Ronnie\", as played by Ron Heung, and his friendships and relationships with others, both on and off the sports field.\nHome media.\nA Panorama Distributions Co.:"

It was held between March 19 and 27, 1982, and concluded with North Dakota defeating Wisconsin 5-2. All Quarterfinals matchups were held at home team venues while all succeeding games were played at the Providence Civic Center in Providence, Rhode Island.\nQualifying teams.\nThe NCAA permitted 8 teams to qualify for the tournament and divided its qualifiers into two regions (East and West). Each of the tournament champions from the three Division I conferences (CCHA, ECAC and WCHA) received automatic invitations into the tournament. Two additional automatic bids were received by the two ECAC division champions that did not contain the ECAC champion. At-large bids made up the remaining 3 teams, an additional 1 eastern and 2 western schools.\nFormat.\nThe tournament featured three rounds of play. The two odd-number ranked teams from one region were placed into a bracket with the two even-number ranked teams of the other region. The teams were then seeded according to their ranking. In the Quarterfinals the first and fourth seeds and the second and third seeds played two-game aggregate series to determine which school advanced to the Semifinals. Beginning with the Semifinals all games were played at the Providence Civic Center and all series became Single-game eliminations. The winning teams in the semifinals advanced to the National Championship Game with the losers playing in a Third Place game."

        "title": "Cricket in Zimbabwe",
        "text": "Cricket is a popular sport in Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC) is a full member of the International Cricket Council (ICC).\nHistory.\nCricket was introduced to Rhodesia in the 19th century and the Rhodesian Cricket Union was formed in 1898. Rhodesia participated in the Currie Cup, the South African inter-province competition in 1904/05 and then again from 1929/30 until 1979/80 as for cricketing purposes Rhodesia were under the authority of South Africa's administrators until independence in 1980. In May 1980, newly renamed Zimbabwe, the country severed its cricketing ties with South Africa and it became an Associate Member of the then \"International Cricket Conference\".\nZimbabwe became a full member of the ICC on 6 July 1992 and played its first Test match on 18–22 October the same year, against India at the Harare Sports Club in Harare. The match was drawn.\nPolitical issues.\nDuring the 2003 Cricket World Cup, the political situation in Zimbabwe came to the fore on the cricket field. Two Zimbabwean players, Andy Flower (white) and Henry Olonga (black), defied orders and wore black armbands during matches in protest against the \"death of democracy in Zimbabwe\" – a reference to their concern over the political actions of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe. Both players subsequently retired from cricket and emigrated from Zimbabwe. In 2004, Zimbabwe announced that test captain Heath Streak had resigned the captaincy and retired from cricket, but it soon became clear that Streak had been dismissed. His fellow white players submitted a list of demands to Zimbabwe Cricket, including the reinstatement of Streak and a review of the team selection process with a view to eliminating political and racial bias imposed by the Mugabe government. The ZC ignored the demands and fielded a team of inexperienced youths in two Tests and three One Day Internationals against the touring Sri Lankan side. The understrength Zimbabwe team was resoundingly defeated, resulting in calls from many players, ex-players, commentators, and fans for the ICC to strip the ZC of Test status until the internal crisis could be resolved. The matter reached a climax when ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed flew to Harare on 17 May to meet with ZC officials and discuss the crisis. The ZC refused to see him. Speed called an emergency meeting of the ICC Board to vote on the issue of Zimbabwe's suspension as a Test nation. On 21 May, with the vote just hours away, the ZC contacted Cricket Australia with an offer to cancel the two Test matches against Australia, due to begin the next day. Cricket Australia accepted the offer, thus averting the vote against the ZCU. On 10 June, representatives of the ZC, Cricket Australia, the United Cricket Board of South Africa, and the Board of Control for Cricket in India met and agreed that all remaining Test matches involving Zimbabwe for 2004 would be cancelled.\nIn November 2005, Tatenda Taibu the young captain of the Zimbabwe national team resigned citing the \"Current Situation in Zimbabwe Cricket\" as the main reason. In March 2007, ZC ordered national team members participating in the Cricket World Cup in to remove their dreadlocks. Two months later, after consulting the Australian cricket team, Australian Prime Minister John Howard declared his opposition to the political situation in Zimbabwe and the conduct of the Mugabe government by formally blocking the proposed Australian tour of Zimbabwe in September 2007.\nGoverning body.\nZimbabwe Cricket (ZC) (formerly known as the Zimbabwe Cricket Union) is the governing body for the sport of cricket in Zimbabwe. It is a full member of the International Cricket Council and African Cricket Association, and operates the Zimbabwean cricket team, organising Test tours and One Day Internationals with other nations. It also organises domestic cricket in Zimbabwe.\nTeams.\nZimbabwean domestic first-class cricket involved the following teams before the introduction of the franchise system in Zimbabwe Cricket:\nThe newly introduced five franchise sides are as follows:\nRangers played in the 2019–20 Logan Cup but were replaced the following season by the returning Southern Rocks.\nFormer teams that played in the Logan Cup:\nMasvingo were expected to receive first-class status in 2005–06, but that season of the Logan Cup was cancelled, and the team never had the opportunity to participate.\nTeams which have also enjoyed first-class cricket status at some point include:"

The defending series champions New Zealand finished fourth.\nSevens is traditionally played in a two-day tournament format. However, the most famous event, the Hong Kong Sevens, is played over three days, largely because it involves 24 teams instead of the normal 16. Starting in 2008–09, the Australia leg (which involves the normal 16 teams) was spread out over a three-day period.\nTournaments.\nThe series' tournaments are identical to 2007–2008 and span the globe:\nThe 2009 Rugby World Cup Sevens was not a part of the 2008-09 series. Unlike the 2005 edition held in Hong Kong, the 2009 edition did not replace one of the 2008-09 series events. The World Cup was held in Dubai from March 5–7, 2009 and won by Wales.\nCore teams.\nPrior to the season, the IRB announced the 12 \"core teams\" that would receive guaranteed berths in each event in the 2008–09 series:\nThe one new core team was the USA, which replaced its neighbor Canada.\nPoints schedule.\nThe season championship is determined by points earned in each tournament. For most events, points are awarded on the following schedule:\nPoints are awarded on a different schedule for the Hong Kong Sevens:\nTournament structure.\nIn all tournaments except Hong Kong, 16 teams participate. Due to its place as the sports most prestigious annual event, the Hong Kong tournament has 24 teams. In each tournament, the teams are divided into pools of four teams, who play a round-robin within the pool. Points are awarded in each pool on a different schedule from most rugby tournaments–3 for a win, 2 for a draw, 1 for a loss. The first tiebreaker is the head-to-head result between the tied teams, followed by difference in points scored during the tournament.\nFour trophies are awarded in each tournament, except for Hong Kong. In descending order of prestige, they are the Cup, whose winner is the overall tournament champion, Plate, Bowl and Shield. In Hong Kong, the Shield is not awarded. Each trophy is awarded at the end of a knockout tournament.\nIn a 16 team tournament, the top two teams in each pool advance to the Cup competition. The four quarterfinal losers drop into the bracket for the Plate. The Bowl is contested by the third-place finishers in each pool, while the Shield is contested by the last-place teams from each pool. In Hong Kong, the six pool winners, plus the two highest-finishing second-place teams, advance to the Cup. The Plate participants are the eight highest-ranked teams remaining, while the lowest eight drop to the Bowl.\nFinal standings.\nThe points awarded to teams at each event, as well as the overall season totals, are shown in the table below. Points for the event winners are indicated in bold. A zero (0) is recorded in the event column where a team competed in a tournament but did not gain any points. A dash (–) is recorded in the event column if a team did not compete at a tournament.\nNotes:\n\"Light blue line on the left indicates a core team eligible to participate in all events of the series.\""

Ernie Els, age 24, won the first of his four major titles on the second sudden-death hole to defeat Loren Roberts, after Colin Montgomerie was eliminated in an 18-hole playoff. (Both Roberts and Montgomerie were winless in major championships, but each won several senior majors while on the Champions Tour.) It was the seventh U.S. Open and tenth major held at Oakmont, and was Arnold Palmer's final U.S. Open as a participant.\nPalmer's last.\nPalmer, age 64, played in his final U.S. Open in 1994. He had not played in the tournament in eleven years, since it was last at Oakmont in 1983, but received an exemption by the USGA to play in his home state. As an amateur, his first U.S. Open in 1953 was also played at Oakmont, won by Ben Hogan.\nTelevision.\nThis was the last U.S. Open for ABC Sports, which had televised the U.S. Open in the United States since 1966, 29 consecutive years. NBC Sports televised the event for twenty years, from 1995 through 2014. Starting in 2015, Fox Sports began a 12-year contract to televise the championship and other USGA events.

At the start of the Sunday's final round, Els was the beneficiary of a controversial ruling. After he hit his opening drive into deep rough, a tournament official ruled that a broadcast truck and aerial camera was in his line of play. He was allowed to take a drop in a spot where escape was much more likely, but still ended up with a bogey on the hole. Afterwards, some pundits suggested that the ruling was wrong and Els should have been forced to play from his original location, since it was possible to move the aerial camera out of the way. Roberts and Montgomerie both recorded a 70 (−1) in the round to challenge Els. Roberts could have posted a −6 (278) clubhouse score, but he missed a par putt on the 18th. Strange was in contention most of the day, but made bogeys on 15 and 16 and a birdie on 18 left him at −4 (280). Els needed par on the last to hold off Roberts and Montgomerie, but he hit his drive into the rough and made bogey from there, forcing a three-way playoff. It was the first three-way playoff at the U.S. Open in 31 years, when Julius Boros defeated Jacky Cupit and Palmer in 1963.\nScorecard.\n\"Final round\"\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\"&lt;br&gt;\nPlayoff.\n\"Monday, June 20, 1994\"\nAll three players struggled as the Monday playoff began. Montgomerie recorded double-bogey at the 2nd, 3rd, and 11th and fell out of contention. Els began the playoff bogey-triple bogey, while Roberts double-bogeyed the 5th. Roberts had a one-stroke lead over Els on the 16th, but he bogeyed the hole to fall into a tie. Els and Roberts both carded a 74 (+3), while Montgomerie finished with a 78 (+7) and was eliminated.\nAfter halving the first extra hole with pars, they headed to the 11th where Roberts found a greenside bunker on his approach while Els safely hit the green. After Roberts' par putt lipped out, Els two-putted for par and the championship. It was the second time for sudden-death at the U.S. Open, which was first implemented in 1990.

Tom Kite, long considered one of the best players to never win a major, finally broke through with a U.S. Open title, two strokes ahead of runner-up Jeff Sluman.\nGil Morgan was the story of the opening two rounds. He took the first-round lead with a 66, then recorded a second-round 69 for the 36-hole lead. After a birdie at the 3rd hole of the third round, Morgan was at 10-under, becoming the first in U.S. Open history to reach double-digits under-par. He got as low as 12-under after a birdie at the 7th, but then collapsed. He made three double-bogeys the rest of the round, but still held the lead by one over Kite, Ian Woosnam, and Mark Brooks. Morgan finally fell out of the lead after a double-bogey at the 6th in the final round. He eventually finished in 13th place, playing his final 29 holes in 17-over par. As Morgan was falling, Kite played steady golf, recording two birdies at 12 and 14 to offset bogeys at 16 and 17. He finished with an even-par 72 and a 3-under total of 285 for a two-stroke win over Jeff Sluman.\nWindy conditions combined with lightning-fast greens made scoring conditions in the final round extremely difficult. Morgan shot an 81, Woosnam, one back at the start of the round, shot 79, Brooks, also one back, shot 84, and Nick Faldo, two back at the start, carded a 77.

It was the second of Stewart's three major championships.\nStewart held the lead through each of the first three rounds, but in the final round he found himself trailing Simpson by a stroke heading to the 18th. Simpson hit his drive into the rough and could only manage a bogey to Stewart's par, forcing an 18-hole playoff. Both players shot a final-round 72 to finish at 282 total, three shots clear of Larry Nelson and Fred Couples. In the playoff, Simpson led by two-strokes heading to the 16th. He then bogeyed the hole, however, while Stewart made birdie to even up the contest. At the par-3 17th, Simpson found the water on his tee shot and recorded another bogey, giving Stewart a one-shot advantage. Simpson then made bogey on the 18th while Stewart made a par, giving Stewart a two-stroke win and the championship. Stewart's winning score in the playoff of 75 was the highest since Tommy Armour won with a 76 in 1927.\nPlay was interrupted during the first round due to a severe thunderstorm.

Scottish pro Willie Macfarlane won the 36-hole playoff by one stroke on the final hole to secure his only major championship and deny Bobby Jones his second Open, which he won the following year.\nThis was the last year that the first two rounds of the U.S. Open were played on the same day. Francis Ouimet, the 1913 champion, held the lead after the first round on Wednesday morning. Macfarlane tied Leo Diegel for the second round lead after a 67 that established a new tournament record. Macfarlane carded a 72 in the third round that gave him a one-stroke lead over Johnny Farrell. Macfarlane, however, struggled in the final round on Thursday afternoon on his way to a 78 and 291 total. That was still good enough to tie Jones, who shot 74 after a 70 in the morning. Farrell and Ouimet (who was playing in his final Open), shot 78 and 76, respectively, to finish a shot out of the playoff.\nThe 18-hole playoff on Friday morning ended in a tie, with both Macfarlane and Jones at 75. In the era before sudden-death, another full round was required to break the tie, and it was held that afternoon. Jones took a four-stroke lead after nine, but Macfarlane managed to tie after recording birdies at 10 and 13, while Jones bogeyed 13. The match was still all square heading to the 18th tee. Macfarlane found the green on his approach while Jones hit into a bunker. After Jones failed to get up-and-down, Macfarlane two-putted for the title. Macfarlane was the first Scot to win the Open in fifteen years, since Alex Smith in 1910.\nDuring the first round, Jones was getting set to hit an iron shot out of the rough on the 11th hole when he felt his club move the ball ever so slightly. No one else seemed to have seen this movement, but Jones called a penalty on himself. After officials were unable to confirm that the ball had actually moved, they allowed Jones to make his own ruling on whether or not he should be penalized. Jones said he was certain the ball had moved and penalized himself. The decision cost him the title, but forever added to Jones's legacy. Spectators praised him for his sportsmanship, but he would have none of it. He flatly replied, \"You might as well praise me for not robbing a bank.\" Because there were so many players with a chance on the final nine of regulation and both playoff rounds were drama-filled, William D.

        "text": "Richard Paul \"Red\" Smith (May 18, 1904 – March 8, 1978) was an American player and coach in both professional baseball and professional football. A native of Brokaw, Wisconsin, Smith stood 5'9\" (175 cm) tall, and weighed 215 pounds (97 kg). A catcher in baseball, he batted and threw right-handed. He played under three of the early 20th century's most famous American sporting coaches—football's Knute Rockne and Curly Lambeau, and baseball's John McGraw.\nAfter attending Kaukauna High School in Kaukauna, Wisconsin, Smith attended the University of Notre Dame, where he played football for Rockne and captained the Fighting Irish varsity baseball team. In , he turned professional in both sports. He appeared in one game for the New York Giants of baseball's National League, where he recorded one putout and made no errors in the field, but did not record an official at bat. He was then farmed to the Jersey City Skeeters of the AA International League. That turned out to be Smith's only game as a Major League Baseball player, although he played in the minor leagues throughout much of the next decade. In the autumn of 1927, he also turned professional in football with the Green Bay Packers of the National Football League, where he played five games. In the NFL, he also played for the New York football Giants and the New York football Yankees, appearing in 37 total games and playing in the offensive backfield and as a guard.\nSmith continued as a coach in both sports after his playing career ended. He was the head baseball coach at Georgetown University (1930) at Seton Hall University (1931–1932) and an assistant coach for the Packers and Giants from 1936 to 1944.\nIn baseball, he managed in three Class D minor leagues—the Bi-State League, KITTY League and Wisconsin State League—from 1936 to 1938 and in 1941–42. He also served as a coach for the Milwaukee Brewers of the American Association (1939–40; 1943–44). In he returned to the majors as a coach for the pennant-winning Chicago Cubs, working under Charlie Grimm, who had been his skipper in Milwaukee. Smith served on the Cub coaching staff through . He then returned to the minor-league Brewers as the team's business manager, briefly filling in as manager in 1952, and moved with the franchise to Toledo, Ohio, when it became the Toledo Sox in 1953. He left baseball in 1955, when the Toledo franchise moved to Wichita, Kansas. He then worked in the brewery industry.\nSmith died in a suburb of Toledo in 1978 at age 73. Every January a fund raising banquet named in Smith's honor is held in Appleton, Wisconsin."

This very small country, which had a population of just 9,872 at the time of the 2002 census, succeeded in winning at least one medals on each occasion, including at least one gold in their first four appearances.\nNauru is renowned particularly for weightlifting; all its medals in the Commonwealth Games have been achieved in that field. Apart from runners Frederick Cannon in 1994 and Aneri Canon in 1998, Nauru has only ever sent weightlifters to the Games.\nTo date, three Nauruans—Reanna Solomon, Marcus Stephen and Yukio Peter—have won gold medals, and a total of eight Nauruans—Reanna Solomon, Marcus Stephen, Yukio Peter, Jalon Renos Doweiya, Ebonette Deigaeruk, Sheba Deireragea, Mary Diranga, Itte Detenamo, and Charisma Amoe-Tarrant—have won medals.\nMedal tally.\nNauru ranks twenty second on the all-time medal tally of the Commonwealth Games.\nHistory.\nFor its first participation in the Commonwealth Games, in 1990, Nauru sent only one representative, Marcus Stephen, who competed in only three events, all of them in weightlifting. He created a surprise by winning a medal in each of those events, including gold in the Men's 60 kg Snatch.\nStephen competed again in 1994, along with weightlifter Gerard Jones and runner Frederick Cannon. Stephen won his country's only medals - three gold. In 1998, Nauru sent six weightlifters and a runner to the Games, and Stephen again won his country's only medals - again, three gold.\nIn 2002, Nauru sent a team consisting solely of weightlifters, including the first Nauruan women to represent their country at the Games. For the first time, Stephen failed to win a gold medal, but obtained three silver. Nauru won fifteen medals, ten of which were won by women, including two gold by Reanna Solomon. Six Nauruan weightlifters, an astonishing proportion of the country's population, won medals at the 2002 Games.\nIn 2006, Stephen did not compete. Nauru failed to win a gold medal for the first time, but weightlifters Sheba Deireragea and Itte Detenamo obtained a silver and a bronze respectively.\nIn 2007, Marcus Stephen, Nauru's most successful sportsman, became President of the Republic of Nauru. In 2008, he became President of the Oceania Weightlifting Federation.\nAt the 2010 Games in New Delhi, India, Yukio Peter won a gold medal for Nauru in the 77 kg division in weightlifting with a new Games record of 333 kg. It was the country's tenth gold medal in their history.\nAt the 2014 Games in Glasgow, Scotland, Itte Detenamo won silver in the +105 kg event, his third medal in consecutive Games."

Clarke from Great Britain, Walter Jakobsson from Finland, and Hermann Kleeberg from Germany decided at their meeting to have both heats reskated, and in fairness to all concerned all the original starters were allowed to compete the following morning.\nBoth reskated heats were held on the morning of Saturday, February 6, 1932.\nHeat 1\nHeat 2\nNote that exactly the same eight skaters qualified in the reskated heats."

The team is currently ranked 18th in the world.\nResults and fixtures.\nThe following is a list of professional baseball match results currently active in the latest version of the WBSC World Rankings, as well as any future matches that have been scheduled.\nTeam history.\nThe Brazil National Baseball team is controlled by the Confederação Brasileira de Beisebol e Softbol. The team represents the nation of Brazil in senior-level men's international competition and is a member of the COPABE or Pan American Baseball Confederation. Though not a major competitor in the world scene, Brazil has steadily been improving and managed to provide a scare for both the Cuba national baseball team and the United States national baseball team in the first decade of the 21st Century. Due to the popularity of the sport among the Japanese, the Brazilian team is composed in large part of Japanese-Brazilian players. Jo Matumoto, a Brazilian team pitcher, got a chance at Organized Baseball in 2007 where he flourished in the Toronto Blue Jays AA system. \nBaseball World Cup.\nThe Baseball World Cup is an international tournament. National baseball teams from around the world compete with one another to crown a champion. It is run by the International Baseball Federation (IBAF) and is one of two active tournaments, the other being the World Baseball Classic, considered by the IBAF to be a major world championship.\n2003.\nIn 2003, Brazil placed 7th in the Baseball World Cup. The field of teams consisted of 15 teams split into two groups. Group A included Cuba, Nicaragua, Chinese Taipaei, South Korea, Canada, Italy and Russia while group B consisted of Japan, team USA, Panama, Brazil, the Netherlands, Mexico, China and France.\nThe order the teams are listed in above shows the teams success in the first round of the tournament. The four teams from each group who finished the first round with the best records went on to play in the placing rounds, which began with the quarterfinals. Brazil played their quarterfinal against the eventual tournament Champions, the Cuba national baseball team and nearly pulled off a huge upset. Pitcher Kléber Ojima nursed a 3–2 lead into the ninth inning, but Cuba's offense proved too powerful for the underdogs to hang on. After a deep triple and a two-run game-winning home run, the Brazilian team are crushed and stunned at their 4–3 loss. In their next game the team suffered a lopsided defeat to the United States 14–3, a game in which they were forced to use 5 different pitchers. This defeat sent Brazil into the Seventh place game where they faced and beat the South Korea national baseball team by the score of 8–3, taking advantage of pitcher Cláudio Yamadao throws eight scoreless innings and Brazil officially finishing out their first ever appearance in the Baseball world cup with a win.\n2005.\nIn 2005 Brazil competed in their second Baseball World Cup, where they were managed by Mitsuyoshi Sato. Coming off a Seventh place finish in 2003, the team was hungry for more success. The first game of pool play had Brazil taking on China. A hard-fought game by both teams ended in the 15th inning when China scored twice to beat Brazil 6–5. Brazil had a 3-run lead going into the seventh inning of the contest. Next up for Brazil were the South Africa national baseball team. Behind a strong pitching performance and sturdy defensive play, the Brazilian team one-hit South Africa and improved to 1–1. The success did not last however, as the team faced a powerful team Cuba in their next game. The final score was 11–1 in Cuba's favor and Brazil was left sitting at 1–2. The woes continued to pile up for Brazil as they lost the following three games 7–0 to the Netherlands, 4–0 to South Korea and 8–5 over Panama. In the latter game of the skid Brazil actually found itself in the lead with just four innings to play. However the bats for the Panama national baseball team came alive and they rallied for the victory. Brazil finally was able to find its stroke against an unsuspecting Sweden team and took and 11–4 victory while scoring all of their runs in each of the first three innings. The victory gave Brazil a record of 2–4 in the games and a hope to finish with a win and boost their winning percentage. Alas, Brazil would taste no more victory as they dropped their final game 12–4 to Canada, a game in which they led 3–0 early on. Their 15th-place finish in 2005 was the last time the team competed in the Baseball World Cup.\nIntercontinental Cup.\nThe Intercontinental Cup is a tournament between the members of the IBAF. Originally held in 1973 in Italy, the Cup was held every other year following until 1999. Since, there has been a competition in 2002 and 2006. As is the trend in many international baseball competitions, Cuba has dominated the Intercontinental Cup, winning 10 golds and three silvers in 16 tournaments. The 2006 tournament was held in Taichung, Taiwan November 9–19.\n1995.\nIn 1995 Brazil competed in the Intercontinental Cup for the first time. The team took 5th place that year, as the dynasty that is Cuban baseball rolled to their seventh consecutive title. Japan would take second place while the Nicaragua national baseball team was left holding the bronze.\n2002.\n2002 was Brazil's second shot at Intercontinental Cup glory. However, Cuba ended their drought of Golds with yet another first-place finish, one of their ten in Cup history. South Korea took the silver while the Dominican Republic national baseball team hoisted the bronze. Brazil was left with a seventh-place finish and hasn't competed in the tournament since.\nPan American Games.\nThe Pan American Games are a sort of warm up for the Olympic Games in the sense that they are held every four years and occur one year prior to the Summer Olympic Games each cycle. The Pan American Games hold competitions in multiple sports and have been held since 1951. \n2007.\nIn 2007 Brazil competed in its very first Pan American Games for baseball. The team opened up pool play with an impressive 1–0 win over Nicaragua. Pitchers Claudio Yamada and Kléber Ojima combined for the four hit shutout while the lone run was scored on a home run by Tiago Magalhaes. Brazil had put themselves in the drivers seat with a huge game 1 win, but took a step back with a 14–2 spanking handed to them by the Dominican Republic national baseball team. This loss put the team's record at 1–1 and meant that the next and final game of pool play was make it or break it for Brazil. In the matchup between Brazil and a powerful United States team, Things were extremely close for the majority of the game. Brazil took an early one-run lead in the first inning but saw it quickly taken away in the second as the U.S. pulled even. The game would stay deadlocked until the fifth when the U.S. would gain a one-run advantage, and later in the seventh would tack on what proved to be a decisive five runs. Despite late efforts by Brazil, who came up with two runs in the eighth and one in the ninth, the American team shut the door for the win and finished pool play undefeated on the 7–5 victory. This loss dropped Brazil to 1–2, a record which proved not good enough to make advance to the medal rounds. The United States would end up making it all the way to the championship where they were beaten by Cuba 3–1.\n2023.\nThe Brazilian team surprised the baseball world. They start beating Venezuela 3-1, Cuba 4-2, and Colombia on a hard match, 8-7, in the first phase and qualifying for the SuperRound. On this phase beating Panama 5-3, but losing to Mexico 5-1, Brazil could make it through the finals for the first time. Facing Colombia again they were beaten 9–1, thus winning the silver medal. The first medal in Pan American Games of the team's history.\n2013 World Baseball Classic.\n2013 roster.\nPreliminary roster for 2013 World Baseball Classic.\nManager: Barry Larkin&lt;br&gt;\nCoaches: Tiago Caldeira, Marcos Guimaraes, Go Kuroki, Ricardo Matumaru, Mitsuyoshi Sato, Satiro Watanabe."

It would go on to win the 1947 edition, which it hosted in Barranquilla. Colombia again hosted, and won, in 1965, though the Colombian government notably denied the defending-champion Cuban team entry into the country, due to tensions with Fidel Castro's government.\nIn 2017, Colombia defeated Spain and Panama to secure their first ever appearance in the World Baseball Classic.

        "text": "The 1934 Rose Bowl, played on January 1, 1934, was an American football bowl game. It was the 20th Rose Bowl Game. The Columbia Lions defeated the Stanford Indians (now Cardinal) 7-0. Cliff Montgomery, the Columbia quarterback, was named the Rose Bowl Player Of The Game when the award was created in 1953 and selections were made retroactively. At 35,000, it has the lowest attendance in the Rose Bowl game since the Rose Bowl Stadium was built in 1922. This was one of the few rainy New Year's Day celebrations in Pasadena, California. Rain three days before had turned the Rose Bowl stadium into a small lake.\nTeams.\nFor New Year's Day, 1934, the Lions traveled to Pasadena, California to play the heavily favored Stanford Indians. Stanford had only been scored on four times the entire season, but the Light Blue had performed well, going 7–1 for the season.\nColumbia University Lions.\nColumbia entered the bowl with a 7–1 record, having lost only one game, to Princeton, who finished their season undefeated.\nStanford University Indians.\nIn the previous season, the \"Thundering Herd\" of the 1932 USC Trojans, coached by Howard Jones, defeated Stanford 13–0 on the way to a second consecutive national championship and victory in the 1933 Rose Bowl. Freshman players at Stanford (members of the class of 1936) vowed never to lose to the Trojans, and became known as the \"Vow Boys\". During the 1934 season, USC (6–0–1) hosted Stanford (5–1–1) on November 11 in Los Angeles. The Trojans suffered their first defeat in 27 games, losing 7–13, as the Stanford players kept their vow in a game that ultimately decided the Pacific Coast Conference championship.\nGame summary.\nFor the three days before the game, torrential rains soaked the field. “When we arrived the day before the game after traveling from New York by a train, the Rose Bowl looked like a lake,” Montgomery, the team captain, recalled in a 1981 article in \"The New York Times\". The Pasadena fire department pumped out the stadium. Game day itself, though, was also uncharacteristically rainy for Southern California, and the muddy field rendered the game scoreless going into the second quarter. At that time, and with the ball on the Stanford 17-yard line, Columbia quarterback Cliff Montgomery '34 executed a trick play called KF-79. During the play, he spun and slipped the ball to Al Barabas '36, then faked a hand-off to Ed Brominski '35, who ran in the opposite direction. While the Indians went for Montgomery and Brominski, Barabas successfully ran around the defense to score for the Lions. Stanford \"Vow Boys\" Bobby Grayson (152 yards on 28 carries), end Jim \"Monk\" Moscrip, lineman Bob Reynolds and other stars could not overcome the margin as mishaps ruined Stanford's chances. Columbia ended up winning the game, 7–0, capping one of the biggest upsets in Rose Bowl history. The win also cemented Lou Little's reputation at Columbia as the Lions' greatest coach to that time.\nAftermath.\nWinning the 1934 Rose Bowl has, to date, been \"the\" greatest accomplishment in Columbia football history. The Columbia Lions had a notable losing streak from 1983 through 1988, losing 44 games in a row during these years, the second-longest losing streak in major college football history. Cliff Montgomery died on April 21, 2005.\nThe \"Vow Boys\", the Stanford class of 1936, never did lose to USC, defeating them again 16–0 in 1934, and 3–0 in 1935. The 1933 Michigan Wolverines football team, who tied for first in the Big Ten Conference with Minnesota on a 0–0 tie between the two teams, was voted the 1933 national champion. USC, who had won the previous two years, and who finished the season 10–1–1, was denied a third consecutive national championship."

        "title": "Cycling in New York City",
        "text": "Cycling in New York City is associated with mixed cycling conditions that include dense urban proximities, relatively flat terrain, congested roadways with stop-and-go traffic, and streets with heavy pedestrian activity. The city's large cycling population includes utility cyclists, such as delivery and messenger services; cycling clubs for recreational cyclists; and increasingly commuters. Cycling is increasingly popular in New York City; in 2018 there were approximately 510,000 daily bike trips, compared with 170,000 daily bike trips in 2005.\nHistory.\nEarly days.\nThe bicycle boom of the late 19th century had a strong impact in the area. New York did not manufacture as many bicycles as other cities, and imported many from elsewhere, including Freehold Township, New Jersey. As a spectator sport, six-day racing was popular and spurred the building of velodromes in suburbs including Washington Heights, Manhattan, and Jersey City, New Jersey.\nWeekly races were held in suburban roads, including Pelham Parkway in the Bronx. The biggest races were in inner city locations, notably at the original Madison Square Garden which had been designed for cycle racing and at the time was located adjacent to Madison Square. The Olympic sport, Madison Racing, is named after cycle races that became popular at Madison Square Garden.\nSeveral of the mid-20th-century parkway projects of Robert Moses included bike paths; however, when more people could afford cars, bicycling declined and the bikeways fell into disrepair. Provisions for pedestrians and bicyclists were not included in the bridges connecting Queens to the Bronx (Throgs Neck Bridge and Bronx–Whitestone Bridge), and Brooklyn to Staten Island (Verrazano-Narrows Bridge). Since July 2018, buses along the Q50 route, which travels across the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge, contain bike racks at the front of each vehicle.\nLate 20th century.\nLate in the century, bicycling resurged. Inspired by a trip to China in early 1980, Mayor Ed Koch ordered buffered bike lanes to be built on some Manhattan streets. Opened in October, the lanes were protested by merchants as well as taxi and trucking interests, while garages and other businesses unsuccessfully sued to stop construction. NYCDOT reported that cycling traffic had doubled while the number of crashes remained unchanged, though it also reported an average of 5 to 10 minutes' extra travel time for drivers, compared to before the bike lanes' installation. In June 1981, the Mayor ordered removal of bike lane barriers due to controversy and a decline in cyclists using the lanes (estimated at 10–15 thousand a day). The lanes were removed by November of the same year. A narrow, physically separated bike lane on Sixth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan remained as a remnant of the Koch lanes. According to a 1990 survey, less than one percent of vehicle trips in New York City were made by bicycle, but by 1991, it was reported that over 75,000 New Yorkers used bicycles to commute to work each day. Simultaneously, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan had introduced legislation that became the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA).\n21st century.\nBike lanes on major bridges were also created, refurbished, or improved, and the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, in partnership with other agencies, created the Manhattan Waterfront Greenway, Brooklyn-Queens Greenway and other bikeways. The Department of Parks and Recreation also added a vendor program to provide \"hop on, hop off\" bicycle rental services across various city parks. The linked network of bicycle rentals is facilitated through concessions in Central Park, Riverside South, West Harlem Piers Park, and the Battery.\nBy 2017, there were 450,000 bike rides per day in New York City, up from 180,000 per day in 2006. Of these, 20% were commuter trips. Between 2014 and 2019, under the mayoralty of Bill de Blasio, over of bike lanes have been added, totaling over citywide.\nTransportation commissioner Polly Trottenberg pushed for increasing bike lanes to demonstrate the city's progress and commitment to transportation safety. However, with the expansion of cycling in New York City, there has been pushback from motorists. For example, in 2019, motorists and Upper West Side residents objected after two hundred parking spaces along Central Park West were eliminated to allow bike lane expansion.\nTypes.\nUtility cycling.\nDelivery bikes are commonly used in New York for fast food deliveries over short distances, sometimes using mountain bikes outfitted with a wide carrier for larger loads such as pizza, or other accessories. Electric bicycles are increasingly used for this service; the bikes were initially illegal (although enforcement was sporadic), but legalized in 2020. Proposals in the New York State Legislature in 2015 would define, legalize and regulate certain \"electric assist bicycles\" with small electric motors.\nBicycle messengers use narrower wheels to carry lighter loads short distances. Specialized cargo bicycles and tricycles carry heavier loads.\nPedicabs became commonplace at the turn of the 21st century, offering novel travel over short distances, including guided tours of Central Park. In April 2007 the New York City Council voted to limit the number of pedicabs to 325. A court overturned the limit, later regulatory efforts concentrated on requirements for insurance and safety equipment and in April 2011, new legislation tightened parking regulations and capped pedicab licenses at 850.\nBicycle sharing.\nIn 2007 the department studied the prospects of a bicycle sharing system and announced in 2011 that kiosks would be built for the service to begin in 2012. The project was slated to introduce 10,000 bikes that would be available from 600 stations made by PBSC Urban Solutions and operated by Alta Bicycle Share, the operators of similar schemes in other U.S. cities.\nCitigroup bought a five-year sponsorship, and as a result, the bike-share system was named Citi Bike. Stations in the first stage were located between 59th Street in Manhattan, the Hudson River, Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn, and Bushwick Avenue. The system opened for business in May 2013 with 330 stations and 4,300 bikes. In October 2014, Citi Bike and the city announced a price increase and a plan to expand the program to add thousands of bikes and hundreds of stations, to cover most of Manhattan and several other areas.\nAfter Citi Bike was launched, the city also started experimented with dockless bike sharing, wherein bikes do not need to be returned to a dock after the trip is complete. The bikes would instead lock themselves into place, and can only be used once a cyclist pays using an online application. In early August 2017, the dockless bike-sharing company Spin had started a dockless operation in the Rockaways, but had been told to cease and desist operations by the NYCDOT, which had licensed Citi Bike as the only official bike-share operator in New York City. In July 2018, the city rolled out a dockless bike-sharing pilot in conjunction with five companies, with 200 bikes provided in each of three outer-borough neighborhoods.\nResearch conducted by Quinnipiac University Polling Institute in June 2013 showed that a majority of New Yorkers support the initiative.\nRecreational.\nSome parks ban or restrict motor vehicles to promote bicycling, including Central Park and Prospect Park. Bike and Roll NYC operates bike rental stations in several city parks and local bike shops also rent them, especially in areas of tourism. Less formal operators work on street corners or out of the back of a truck or in parking garages, although this type of operation is illegal on city park property. Additional services include paid guided tours.\nSeveral organizations, including Five Borough Bicycle Club and Bike New York, conduct tours every weekend. Most are day trips for no fee; some larger or overnight tours require payment. New York City is host to several long annual recreational rides, including the Five Boro Bike Tour. New York Cycle Club and others specialize in fitness and speed. Bicycle track races run most summer weekends in Kissena Park and elsewhere. Road races are held on weekends and some weekday evenings at Prospect Park, Central Park, and Floyd Bennett Field.\nCommuting.\nLike other forms of cycling in New York City, commuting by bicycle has increased significantly over the years. In 2015, 46,057 people said they used a bicycle as their primary mode of commuting, compared with just 16,468 who commuted primarily by bicycle in 2005. Commuters accounted for approximately one fifth of bicycle trips in New York City in 2017. Many New Yorkers live less than from their job, and can be seen bicycle commuting over various bridges connecting Manhattan with the outer boroughs and along the Hudson or elsewhere in good weather. In 2008 the NYC Department of Transportation released a \"screenline count report\" suggesting that commuter cycling had more than doubled since the turn of the century.\nFor mixed-mode commuting most suburban commuter rail stations provide free parking in racks, and some have bicycle lockers for security. Regulations on bicycles on trains vary by railroad and time of day; until 2021 Metro-North and LIRR required a permit. New Jersey Transit also allows bicycles onboard trains en route to New York City but restricts them on rush hour trains.\nBikes are allowed on New York City Subway trains at all hours, though it is sometimes difficult to fit a bike into a packed subway car. Typically, cyclists use the subway security gates to bring bicycles into the system, and board either the very first or very last train car. Due to traffic patterns and transport network geometries, mixed-mode bicycling-plus-subway can be the fastest way to commute, or to achieve transport within New York City, for many routes and times.\nFolding bicycles, which often allow parking in a workplace or home closet where there isn't room for a full sized bike, became increasingly popular early in the 21st century. European city bikes from the Netherlands, though lacking this virtue, became a lesser trend in 2008.\nIn 2009, a law created by the New York City Council went into effect, requiring commercial buildings with freight elevators to allow employees to transport their bikes on them up to tenant floors. The purpose of the bill was to allow access to indoor storage spaces to encourage commuting by cycling. The City Council also created another local law in 2009 requiring many off-street parking facilities to replace some of their spaces for vehicles with bicycle racks. So far there has been limited demand by cyclists for paid off-street bicycle parking at these garages and lots. The Alliance for Downtown New York, a local Business Improvement District, announced in late 2018 that the Oonee Company would install a new kind of secure bike pod for parking on Whitehall Street.\nThe non-profit organization Transportation Alternatives promotes bicycle commuting and bicycle friendly facilities to lessen the impact of cars on urban life. On its website, the organization states that is \"working to make New York City's neighborhoods safer and restore a vibrant culture of street life\" and advocates \"for safer, smarter transportation and a healthier city.\"\nBike lanes.\n, New York City had of bike lanes, compared to of bike lanes in 2006. The New York City Department of Transportation distributes a free and annually updated bike map online and through bike shops.\nTypes.\nThere are three types of bike lanes on New York City streets: Class I, Class II, and Class III. Class I bike lanes are typically physically separated from vehicular/pedestrian paths. Class II bike lanes are simply marked with paint and signage and lie between a parking lane and a traffic lane. Class III bike lanes are shared vehicular/bike lanes, usually only marked by signage and sharrows. The majority of bike lanes in New York are Class II or Class III bike lanes.\nClass I.\nBetween 2007 and 2018, New York City added just over 100 miles of Class I bike lanes. As of the end of 2018, there were 16 corridors with Class I bike lanes. In October 2019, it was announced that an additional of Class I bike lanes would be built starting in 2021. At that point, there were of Class I bike lanes citywide.\nOne of the most heavily used Class I bike lanes is the Hudson River Greenway, which is segregated from pedestrians. Other parts of the Manhattan Waterfront Greenway and the Brooklyn-Queens Greenway are less continuously segregated. An east-west greenway runs through Pelham Bay Park and Pelham Parkway in the Bronx, connecting via Mosholu Parkway to Van Cortlandt Park, which in turn connects to the South County Trailway.\nGreenways are prevalent along major parkways: the Bronx River Parkway, Hutchinson River Parkway, Eastern Parkway, and Ocean Parkway. Others include foreshoreways along the north shore of Jamaica Bay and the south shores of Little Neck Bay and Flushing Bay. Some boardwalks such as the Rockaway Beach Boardwalk, the Riegelmann Boardwalk, and the South Beach Boardwalk allow bicycles at some times. Several destinations such as Central Park, Prospect Park, and Governors Island contain extensive Class 1 bike lane networks.\nClass I bike lanes are the safest road design for cyclists and are credited with helping increase the number of cyclists in the city while reducing crashes and injuries to all road users. Between 2009 and 2014, cyclists riding in parking protected bike lanes experienced a 75% reduction in crash-related injuries, while pedestrians on those routes experienced a 22% decrease in crash-related injuries.\nCriticism.\nDespite their documented safety benefits, some have been critical of bike lanes. A group in Park Slope sued in March 2011 to remove a new bike lane, and in November the City Council voted to slow the installation of new lanes and pedestrian plazas. Much of the opposition has been concentrated in Manhattan and Queens neighborhoods, where opponents claim that bike lanes are a nuisance or danger to pedestrians and nearby businesses. However, an August 2012 survey found two-thirds of New Yorkers in favor of bike lanes.\nHistory.\nIn response to the bicycle boom of the 19th century, the City of Brooklyn was especially responsive, building bike lanes in Eastern Parkway, Ocean Parkway, and elsewhere. The \"Coney Island Cycle Path\" (now Ocean Parkway Bike Path) of 1894 was the first bike path in the United States.\nIn 1934 Robert Moses became Parks Commissioner and Chairman of the Triborough Bridge, he used these positions to transform the city's infrastructure. However, Moses prioritized private cars over other transportation, and he viewed bicycles as tools for recreation instead of serious transportation. His 1938 plan for cycling declared that \"bicycles have no place on public highways.\" His era of greatest power (from 1934 - 1960) was an era of parkways, and he built cycle tracks within parks and along parkways.\nAs a result of Moses' philosophy, by the 1960s, New York City's protected bicycle infrastructure was limited to parks and parkways. In the late 60s mayor John Lindsay made some moves to accommodate cycling such as creating limited \"car-free\" hours on the Central Park roads. In response to the first Earth Day in 1970 he proposed the idea of a bike lane on 5th Avenue. Retail interests along 5th avenue were skeptical of the plan and blocked the project, fearing it would hurt business.\nIn 1973 Transportation Alternatives was founded and began its decades-long project of advocating for more bicycle infrastructure. But this would be a long effort because in the 1970s and 80s the only dedicated bicycle infrastructure was limited to city parks.\nIn June 1980 Mayor Ed Koch created a protected bike lane along 6th Avenue from Washington Square Park to Central Park. But the bike lanes and the mayor came under heavy criticism for this project, with Koch himself complaining to DOT commissioner Sam Schwartz \"'I can't go anywhere in this freaking city without somebody complaining about these bike lanes.\" After 6 months the mayor bowed to pressure and ripped out the bike lanes in November 1980.\nBy 1987 Koch had completely changed his mind about bicycles and now attempted to ban them entirely from 3 major avenues in Manhattan. A protest movement erupted in response in the summer of 1987, and by March 1988 the city withdrew the Bike Ban.\nThe next great change happened in the 1990s with the creation of the Hudson River Park. The plan for the new park was announced in 1992 and construction began in 1994 and was complete by 2003. This park runs along the Hudson River and created a continuous park from Riverside Park on 72nd street all the way to the southern tip of Manhattan. The park also includes a jogging/cycling mixed use path called the \"Hudson River Greenway.\" Sections of this path began opening in 1999 and were an important evacuation route during the September 11 attacks in 2001. The greenway has now become the most used bike path in America with around 7000 riders per day.\nTraffic lights.\nIn July 2019, the New York City Council approved legislation that allows bikers to follow pedestrian walk signals at intersections where no dedicated traffic light for cyclists is present. The program applies particularly to intersections with leading pedestrian intervals, intersections where the pedestrian signal displays the walk indication for several seconds before the vehicular traffic light indication changes from red to green.\nGreen waves.\nA \"green wave\" refers to the programming of traffic lights to allow for continuous traffic flow (a series of green lights) over a number of intersections in one direction. Any vehicle directed by lights, including cars, buses, trucks, and bicycles, will see a change in movement patterns and movement regulation following this programming. Traffic engineers decide on an approximate average speed of each vehicle type, and thus program the traffic lights accordingly, based on which vehicle the city aims to prioritize. In New York City, this \"green wave\" prioritizes bikers by timing traffic lights around the average biking speed, in addition to mitigating the negative effects of heavy automotive congestion. After a series of bicyclist deaths in 2019, the highest death toll for cyclists in two decades, the city decided to retime traffic lights, so that vehicles would have to travel an average of between consecutive green lights.\nThe green wave concept was traditionally utilized by traffic engineers to move cars more efficiently and quickly through congested urban streets. It was adapted by cyclists in Copenhagen in 2007 and quickly spread to other locales. This programming marks a shift in prioritizing the biker over the driver, a conflict that has wider class, race, and geographical implications. This implementation of green wave traffic signal programming in New York City has followed smaller instances of success in the U.S., including San Francisco, Portland, and Denver.\nBoth local government and non-profit transportation constituencies have supported bringing the \"green wave\" to New York City, America's most congested urban area. Aaron Villere, a senior program associate for the National Association of City Transportation Officials, has cited the findings of cities that have retimed signals for cyclists, stating, \"We've seen it improves safety… we've seen it makes the streets more comfortable for people biking, walking, and driving.\"\nHowever, there is also some criticism, with several critics saying that cyclists often run red lights, and that this behavior is unlikely to change based on new traffic light programming. Spokespeople from Transportation Alternatives, a group that promotes cycling, argued that drivers were likely to object to any proposed change to their long-held claim to the streets.\nRiding.\nLaws and rules.\nA bicycle is treated similarly to a motorized vehicle under the law of the State of New York with several exceptions. No license is required to operate a bicycle. Cyclists must ride in the direction of traffic. On one-way streets 40 feet or wider, they may ride on either the left or right side. Children aged 13 years and under must wear a helmet. Adult cyclists must use hand signals, must only wear headphones in one ear, must not ride on sidewalks, and must use lights at night (red in rear and white in front). The NYPD issues moving violations to riders who break the rules.\nRules against fastening bikes to subway property, including fences around street stairs, are enforced more rigorously than those concerning lampposts and other street furniture. Municipal bicycle racks are installed in many neighborhoods. Most are of the traditional design, but the city has added larger protected bicycle parking structures in a handful of locations such as near Union Square. More are planned.\nDangers.\nWhen mayor Bill de Blasio entered office in 2014, he sought to bring all traffic fatalities to zero through his Vision Zero initiative. In 2017, 24 cyclists were killed, and 4,485 were injured in crashes in New York City. Private parties have made maps of fatal crashes, and some fatality locations are marked by white-painted ghost bikes. Although crash-related injuries to cyclists are not uncommon, their incidence has decreased even as the number of cyclists in New York City has increased. Between 2011 and 2015 there were 12.8 cyclist fatalities per 100 million cycling trips, compared with 44.2 cyclist fatalities per 100 million cycling trips between 1996 and 2000.\nBeing doored (colliding with the door of a car unexpectedly opened) is a hazard. Many Class II/Class III bike lanes run in the door zone. There has a been an updated list showing different intersections with the most fatalities in NYC.\nNew York State has established No-Fault auto insurance laws (NYIL §51-52) to pay the medical (and some other) expenses of bicyclists, pedestrians, and other people struck by vehicles. The system is highly complex, however, and no public authority has published instructions on how to access it. Individuals hit by cars should file a crash report with the NYPD or DMV. Cyclists who are hurt in non-vehicle crashes, due to mechanical problem, pothole, etc., should ask the police or EMT to write up an Aided Report; this may be used for insurance claims or to report road hazards to the City so that others are not hurt.\nPublic efforts.\nLocal group Bike New York encourages cycling and bicycle safety. They host rides throughout the year, including the Five Boro Bike Tour. The group also offers bicycle education programs for all ages through ten \"community bike education centers.\"\nMonthly Critical Mass rides in New York have resulted in conflict between the New York City Police Department (NYPD) and bike riders. On August 27, 2004, during the Republican National Convention, more than 400 riders were arrested for 'disrupting traffic'. The arrests, thought to be preemptive action against protests during the convention, spawned lawsuits. Other rides were also followed by arrests, and tickets though in 2008 the NYPD drew back the targeted enforcement effort.\nExternal links.\nClubs:\nAdvocacy:"

        "text": "Brad L. Hill (born May 2, 1962) is an American baseball coach and former player, who is the head baseball coach of the Emporia State Hornets. He played college baseball at Emporia State from 1982 to 1985. He then served as the head coach of the Hutchinson Blue Dragons (1988–1990), Central Missouri State Mules (1995–2003) and the Kansas State Wildcats (2004–2018). Under him, the Wildcats have appeared in six consecutive Big 12 baseball tournaments (2007–2012). His teams have also qualified for three NCAA Division I Baseball Championships. Hill was the coach at Central Missouri from 1995 to 2003. He won a Division II National Championship there in 2003, and was National Runner-up in 2001.\nPlaying career.\nHill played collegiately at Emporia State University. He capped off his four-year career by helping Emporia State to the 1984 NAIA College World Series. Hill still owns a majority of the Hornets' offensive marks, including the career marks for games played (244), at-bats (809), hits (302), runs scored (241), RBIs (264), doubles (71) and home runs (47).\nHe was drafted by the Texas Rangers in the 1984 Major League Baseball Draft in the 35th round (778th overall). He advanced as high as Class AA.\nCoaching career.\nHill was the head coach at Hutchinson Community College in Hutchinson, Kansas, for three seasons from 1988–90, compiling an 83–50 overall record. His 1989 squad posted a school-record 34 wins, while in 1990 the Dragons registered the highest winning percentage in school history with a 32–9 mark.\nHill was an assistant coach at the University of Kansas for 4 seasons under his college coach, Dave Bingham. As the Jayhawks' hitting coach and recruiting coordinator from 1991–94, he helped Kansas to a 144–92 overall record and a pair of NCAA tournament appearances, including the school's first and only trip to the College World Series in 1993. The 1993 team broke school records for most hits, doubles, triples, home runs and stolen bases in a single-season. The Jayhawks posted a 10–7 record against the Wildcats during Hill's tenure in Lawrence.\nHill was hired by Central Missouri State in 1995. He led the Mules to a National Championship in 2003, with a record of 51–7, including 27–2 in conference play.\nIn the summer of 2003, Hill was hired by Kansas State University as the head baseball coach. He replaced Mike Clark, who coached the team for 17 years. In 2004, Hill lead the Wildcats to their first-ever national ranking at No. 30 during that pan, which included an 11-game winning streak.\nThen, in 2005, the Wildcats took the next step as they won 30 games in a season for just the 10th time ever, doubled their conference wins from the previous season, swept a season series from in-state rival Wichita State for the first time in 50 years and knocked off a No. 1-ranked team for the first time in school history, eventual national champion Texas.\nIn 2006, the Wildcats won a school-record 16 straight games and also ended the season on a 5-game winning streak, wrapping up the season with a sweep of # 22 Baylor at Tointon Family Stadium. Statistically, K-State finished the season in the top half of the league in both hitting (.314) and ERA (3.94). The 3.94 team ERA was the lowest since the 1975 season and the best since the addition of aluminum bats in college baseball.\nHis teams have won 40 or more games eight times and 50-plus games on four occasions.\nOn April 29, 2009, Hill won his 600th career game, beating North Dakota, 10–2.

        "text": "Thomas Roland Burgess (September 1, 1927 – November 24, 2008) was a Canadian professional baseball player, coach and manager. An outfielder and first baseman, Burgess had two trials in Major League Baseball (MLB); a 17-game stint with the St. Louis Cardinals in , and a full season with the Los Angeles Angels in . He then forged a long career as a minor-league manager, and served as a major-league third base coach for the New York Mets and Atlanta Braves. \nIn his playing days, he threw and batted left-handed and stood tall and weighed .\nBiography.\nA native of London, Ontario, Burgess attended the University of Western Ontario. He first signed with the Cardinals in 1946, making his debut with the Hamilton Red Wings of the Class D Pennsylvania–Ontario–New York League (PONY League). Despite compiling a robust .350 batting average in 1947 in the Class C Interstate League, by 1949 Burgess was voluntarily retired and spent three seasons with the London Majors of the Canadian Intercounty Baseball League. He resumed his pro playing career in 1952 in the Class A South Atlantic League and batted .328, then continued his hot hitting in 1953, batting .346 with 22 home runs and 93 runs batted in with the Cards' top farm team, the Rochester Red Wings of the Triple-A International League. That earned him a promotion to St. Louis for the start of the 1954 campaign, but Burgess collected only one hit—a double off Paul LaPalme of the Pittsburgh Pirates on June 13—in 21 at bats, an .048 batting average, before being sent back to Rochester.\nBurgess spent the next seven seasons in the International League, with Rochester and the Columbus Jets, and then was acquired by the expansion Angels in their maiden season of 1961. He spent that year with the Triple-A Dallas-Fort Worth Rangers of the American Association, then made the 25-man roster of the 1962 Angels. He appeared in 87 games and batted 143 times over the course of a full season, but could muster only a .196 batting average. By 1963, he was back in the International League for his final pro season. All told, Burgess batted .177 with 29 hits, two home runs and 14 RBI in 104 major-league games.\nHe returned to the game as a manager in the farm systems of the Cardinals, Braves, Mets, Texas Rangers and Detroit Tigers in the 1970s and 1980s. He managed in Triple-A with the Tidewater Tides, Richmond Braves, Oklahoma City 89ers and Charleston Charlies, and among his achievements won championships in the Appalachian League, Texas League and the California League. During his 1977 campaign with the Mets, he was the third base coach on the staff of Joe Frazier and Joe Torre and, the following year, served under Bobby Cox in Atlanta. He was named to the Rochester Red Wings Hall of Fame in 1992, the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in 1992, and the London (Ontario) Sports Hall of Fame in 2003.\nBurgess died from complications due to cancer on November 24, 2008, in Lambeth, London, Ontario.\nExternal links.\n, or pelotabinaria (Venezuela)"

        "text": "The 1941 AFL season was the second and final season of the third American Football League. After deeming the 1940 season to be a success, the league made overtures of expansion, even going to the point of having a press conference to announce the addition of new teams (July), but when the press conference was held, the Boston Bears had withdrawn from the league and the new Detroit franchise deferred entry for the 1942 season (interests representing Philadelphia and Baltimore also applied for membership and were denied).\nThe New York Yankees were sold to promoter and agent Douglas Hertz in January; by mid-summer, the AFL revoked the franchise in light of controversies involving Hertz’s finances. A syndicate headed by William Cox was awarded the franchise in August, but Hertz kept the name for his new independent team (which later in the season became a traveling team in the American Association). Cox and the new owners of the AFL franchise redubbed the team the Americans. In Buffalo, a less contentious change of ownership resulted in the Indians becoming the Tigers.\nThe Columbus Bullies successfully defended their 1940 AFL championship. Their 5-1-2 record edged the 5-2-1 of the Americans and the 4-3-1 of the Milwaukee Chiefs.\nAt the beginning of the 1941 season, the Bullies accepted a challenge from the defending Western Interprovincial Football Union champion Winnipeg Blue Bombers for a three-game series; the Bombers had been banned from Grey Cup contention that year due to rules discrepancies between the WIFU and the other organizations playing Canadian football at the time. The Bullies and Blue Bombers played three games, at least partially by Canadian rules (as one of the games, the deciding third game, has Winnipeg's final score as 1 point, which is not possible in the American game). Columbus won the series, 2-1; Winnipeg won the first game 19-12, but Columbus won the next two, 6-0 and 31-1.\nFinal standings.\n\"W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, Pct.= Winning Percentage, PF = Points for, AP = Points against\"\n1941 All-League Team.\nThe league's coaches selected the all-league team:\nAfter the 1941 season.\nPrecisely one week after the last regular season AFL game --- Sunday, December 7, 1941 --- Pearl Harbor was attacked by Japanese military forces. The euphoria of a successful season gave way to the realization that the military demands of the American participation in World War II would put the continued success of the AFL (and the NFL, for that matter) into question. As both major football leagues were losing personnel to military service, both made plans for a 1942 season (the AFL as a six team loop with a new Detroit franchise). Ironically, the NFL came close to suspending operations, but continued as a ten-team league, but on September 2, 1942, the AFL suspended operations “until the end of the war.” AFL president William Cox announced the suspension, stating “We do not have the time to go into the football business this fall. I want to stress that there is no financial problem involved. Each team definitely has enough finances to continue.”\nThe league did not return after the end of World War II. In 1946, a minor league, the American Association, appropriated the American Football League name for itself, and the All-America Football Conference replaced the suspended league as the primary rival of the National Football League."

        "text": "The Ice Hockey European Championship was an annual ice hockey tournament for European countries associated with the International Ice Hockey Federation. A total of 66 European Champions were crowned in between the years 1910 and 1991.\nIndependent championship tournaments were organized between 1910 and 1927, and again in 1929 and 1932. The 1928 European Championships medals were awarded to the European participants of the Olympic tournament in St. Moritz. After 1932, the European Championship was awarded to the top European team among the participants in the Ice Hockey World Championships. Until 1970, the final standings for the European Championship was determined simply by where European teams placed in the World Championships. Starting in 1971, a separate final standings was maintained, determined by using only the games played between European teams at the World Championships.\nBetween 1954 and 1991, in all but six tournaments, the only three teams to medal were the Soviets, Czechoslovakia, and Sweden. The Soviets led all European countries with 27 championships in that span.\nThere were no European (or World) Championships awarded in the Olympic years of 1980, 1984 and 1988."

        "text": "Michael Douglas (born March 31, 1971) is a Canadian skeleton racer who has competed since 2006. He played football and competed in track whilst at University in Toronto, and at the age of 30 he was discovered by racer Pascal Richard. He competed in the 2010 Winter Olympics but was disqualified before his third run for failing to remove the covers off the runner guards of his sled.\nEarly life.\nDouglas was born in Toronto, Ontario and raised in Kleinburg. He attended King City Secondary School, from which he graduated in 1990. He studied at Fanshawe College and went on to play Canadian football for the University of Toronto as a cornerback. He gave up football after as backup to the first team and moved onto athletics instead, a decision he says he has since regretted as the football team went on to win the Vanier Cup three years later, with a team that featured several players who too were backup players when Douglas was on the team.\nSkeleton racing.\nSkeleton racer Pascal Richard spotted Douglas playing soccer and suggested he try skeleton instead, resulting in Douglas starting to race at the age of 30. He started on the European circuit in 2004, and moved to the World Cup circuit in 2007. He failed to qualify for the 2008 team by two tenths of a second, resulting in him being removed from the team. He returned in the 2009–10 season, taking the place of Keith Loach, who he beat again in a two race runoff to join Jeff Pain and Jon Montgomery in the Olympic team.\nWhilst racing on the track used in the 2006 Winter Olympics at Cesana Pariol in Italy, he was part of a Canadian team holding all three top spots. However, after the second run through, Douglas dropped into the fourth place where he finished.\nAt the 2010 Winter Olympics he placed in fifth position following the first run, but his second run was slower resulting in him going into the final run in seventh place and was considered to be in the running for a bronze medal. Douglas spoke of his runs, \"That second run was not very good for me, I’ve been generally consistent here, and that (second result is) not where I want to be. So we’ll clean it up tomorrow and hopefully get up on the podium.\"\nHowever he was late removing the runner guards off of his sled by three minutes in the parc fermé (a holding area for the sleds prior to the race), and was disqualified from the race. Warmer sled runners can cut through the ice on the track faster, Fédération Internationale de Bobsleigh et de Tobogganing (FIBT) spokesman Don Krone explained, \"The reasons the runners need to be uncovered is so that they're all at the same ambient air temperature, It's a standard procedure at every single skeleton competition, so the procedures are well known. It's not something different for the Olympic Games.\" Teammate Jon Montgomery went on to win the gold medal.\nAs of the end of the 2010–11 season, Douglas is ranked 13th overall according to the FIBT rankings making him the second highest Canadian competitor. This included a season high placing of 6th at St. Moritz, Switzerland, where he beat Olympic champion Jon Montgomery.\nPersonal life.\nWhen not racing, Douglas is a radiologic technologist at the Foothills Medical Centre in Calgary."

        "text": "Zigzag was started in 1976 and inspired by a meeting with the publisher of a Hawaiian tabloid magazine named \"Backdoor\". The headquarters is in Durban.\nThe original team was Paul Naude, Mike Larmont and Doug MacDonald. They set up shop in the rooftop of Larmont's surfboard factory, working nights while keeping their daytime jobs. Initially the magazine was tabloid-sized and released quarterly. In 1988 the magazine, struggling to make ends meet and with a full-time staff of one, was sold. \nCraig Sims and Rob van Wieringen, the new owners, teamed up until 1991. Sims soldiered on and in March 2007 Touchline Media bought Atoll Media. At the end of 2007 Sims passed the custodianship of the fourth oldest surfing magazine in the world to the Publisher/Editor partnership of John McCarthy and Will Bendix. McCarthy left less than a year later to start a rival magazine.\nMeanwhile, \"Zigzag\" continued under the guidance of the Editor, William Bendix, with a former Editor, Jeremy Saville, entering the fray in 2008 as the magazines brand manager. \nDue to the global economic recession and Publishing House handovers, 2008 and 2009 was a roller coaster period for the Title. The magazine had to negotiating major staff retrenchments and lacked a dedicated publisher to lead the magazine. Despite the major re-structuring, in 2009 \"Zigzag\" reached a celebratory milestone by printing its 200th issue. Later that year \"Zigzag\" beat other popular national magazines (boasting more than double and triple the circulation of \"Zigzag\") by taking out the 2009 'Best Special Interest Magazine' at the prestigious annual PICA awards. The PICA's are regarded as the Academy Awards for South Africa's magazine publishers and the 'Special Interest' category one of their premier awards. \nTouchline Media was bought out by the largest media company in Africa, Media24 (Naspers), and \"Zigzag\" was moved around the company, first as a subsidiary of Famous Publishing (2010) and then from 2011 it was moved across to Media 24 Magazines until 2013. In October 2013 the magazine was acquired by Jingo Media, a content creation company that publishes South African creative culture magazine, \"Mahala\", owned by Andy Davis, a regular \"Zigzag\" contributor. In so doing, \"Zigzag\" magazine moved back into the hands of an independent publisher and surfer. \nIn 2014, after 38 years of publishing, \"Zigzag\" has only had six Editors. It remains South Africa's most successful surfing publication."

From 2001 through 2007, 30 points were required to win a game.\nUniversity Park Regional.\nRegional recap.\nJust as they had done all season, Penn State swept past Western Michigan, who was making their first Sweet 16 appearance in 21 years. When Penn State won the third set, they broke the NCAA record for consecutive sets won at 106 (The previous record of 105 was held by Florida from 2003.)\nIn the other Sweet 16 match, California swept Illinois, setting up a rematch of the 2007 NCAA National Semifinals with Penn State.\nDespite getting a test from California in the first set, Penn State swept the Bears again to head to their second straight Final Four, bringing the program's total to seven Final Four appearances. California ended their season at 26-7, which was the most wins in the program's history in a single season.\nUniversity Park Regional All-Tournament Team:\nSeattle Regional.\nRegional recap.\nWashington and Nebraska both swept past their Sweet 16 opponents with ease, to set up a rematch of the 2005 NCAA National Championship.\nWashington, who had never lost an NCAA regional that they hosted, seemed to be heading to the Final Four after going up 2-0 on Nebraska. Out of the break, however, Nebraska regained focus and easily beat Washington in set 3, before winning a close set 4. In the decisive fifth set, Washington looked to be on the brink of victory after building a seemingly insurmountable 9-3 lead. Nebraska mounted a stunning comeback, though, and took 9 straight points. The Huskies tied it up at 13, before a Husky hitting error gave the Huskers match point. Nebraska senior Jordan Larson served out an ace to close out the stunning comeback. Nebraska advanced to their third Final Four in four years, and eleventh overall. Washington finished their season 27-5 and was the Pac-10 runners-up.\nSeattle Regional All-Tournament Team:\nAustin Regional.\nRegional recap.\nTexas defeated UCLA in four sets to advance to their third straight NCAA Regional Final. Iowa State continued their dream run, upsetting 11th-seeded Oregon in five sets, just after upsetting sixth-seeded Minnesota in four sets in Minneapolis in the second round.\nAfter Texas took the 2-0 lead, Iowa State bounced back to take the third set and extend the match. However, Texas responded in the fourth set, defeating the Cyclones easily to advance to the program's first final four since 1995. Iowa State ended their season at 22-13 and made their first Elite Eight appearance in school history.\nAustin Regional All-Tournament Team\nFort Collins Regional.\nRegional recap.\nSecond seeded Stanford had no troubles with 15th-seeded Florida, sweeping them to earn their spot in the Elite Eight. Hawaii defeated Purdue in four close sets to advance.\nStanford dominated Hawaii in the regional final, which included winning the second set 25-9. Hawaii recorded 29 hitting errors in the match, while Stanford had just 7. Hawaii ended their season at 31-4 as the WAC co-champions. Stanford advanced to their third Final Four in a row, bringing the school total to an NCAA record 18 appearances.\nFort Collins Regional All-Tournament Team\nNational Semifinals recap.\nStanford vs. Texas.\nIn a rematch of the 2008 AVCA Showcase, Stanford once again beat Texas in five sets to advance to their 14th NCAA title match in school history.\nAfter Texas went up two sets to none, Stanford came back to win in five sets behind play from seniors Foluke Akinradewo and Cynthia Barboza. It was the first time in the history of the NCAA tournament that a team came back to win after being down two sets to none in the National Semifinals. Stanford advanced to their third straight title match, while Texas, who had advanced to their first Final Four since 1995, finished their season at 29-4.\nPenn State vs. Nebraska.\nPenn State, unbeaten in both matches and individual sets, seemed to be easily heading to their second straight final after going up 2 sets to 0 on Nebraska in front of an NCAA record crowd of 17,430, mostly Husker fans. The Nittany Lions NCAA record of consecutive sets won stood at 111 before it being snapped by Nebraska.\nComing out of the break, Nebraska mounted a big comeback. The Huskers forced a game five off of Penn State. The Huskers, unbeaten at the Qwest Center with a 14–0 record and never having lost a match in the state of Nebraska in 96 matches, went up 10–8 in the decisive fifth set. However, AVCA National Player of the Year Nicole Fawcett served six straight points, which included a service ace, to swing the momentum to the Nittany Lions at 14–10. Nebraska fought off one match point before Megan Hodge crushed her 23rd kill of the night to finish the match and set up a rematch of the 2007 NCAA championship.\nNational Championship recap: Penn State vs. Stanford.\nFor the first time in NCAA tournament history, the same two teams met for the national title in consecutive years. Stanford's senior class, appearing in their third straight title match, was attempting to win their first national title. A Stanford class had not gone through without winning at least one NCAA championship since the program won their first national championship in 1992. Penn State and Stanford met for the fourth time in the NCAA championship - all of which have occurred since 1997 - which is the most meetings between any two schools. Penn State and Stanford are the only two programs to appear in every NCAA tournament since the NCAA started to sponsor women's volleyball in 1981.\nStanford started the match on fire, going up 10-5, then 15-10 at the media timeout. However, Penn State went on a 15-5 run to close out the first set, 25-20. Both teams remained even in set 2, with a Hodge kill giving Penn State the narrow 15-14 lead heading into the media timeout.\nThe national championship was halted in set 2 for at least 10 minutes, though, after a scoring discrepancy. Penn State seemingly earned the point to go up 21-19 after a Nicole Fawcett kill, but the scoring table had a miscommunication, thinking Stanford had gotten the point and that it was 20-20. Despite both Penn State head coach Russ Rose and Stanford head coach John Dunning agreeing the score was, in fact, 21-19 in favor of Penn State, the scoring table did not adjust the score and replayed the point. Another scoring miscommunication took place once again later in set 2, but Penn State eventually prevailed, 26-24, to take the 2-0 lead to the match. The incident led the NCAA Volleyball panel to recommend a protocol for score discrepancies.\nIn what was the final set, Penn State eased up to the 21-17 lead. Two consecutive kills from Megan Hodge put Penn State just two points away from their second straight national title at 23-18. Stanford, however, managed to pull within one at 23-22 after four consecutive kills from Alix Klineman. Another Hodge kill halted the run to give Penn State two championship points at 24-22. After Stanford scored another kill to stave off one championship point, Penn State senior Nicole Fawcett sealed the set with a tip off of the Stanford block to take the national championship and the match. Penn State extended their NCAA record of consecutive matches won to 64 while Stanford's 16 match winning streak was snapped.\nStanford became the first team to ever lose in three consecutive title matches. Penn State joined USC from 2003 to become the only repeat champions to go undefeated, while also joining Long Beach State's 1998 team and Nebraska's 2000 team to be the only undefeated teams in NCAA history. The Nittany Lions joined USC's 2003 team and Nebraska's 2006 team as the only schools to be ranked #1 in the coaches poll for the entire season.\nWith the dominance Penn State showed throughout the 2008 season - going 114-2 in individual sets, 38-0 in matches, breaking the NCAA record for consecutive matches and sets won, being the first team in NCAA history to go through the regular season without losing a single set, leading the NCAA in blocks per set, and breaking the NCAA rally-scoring era record for team hitting percentage in a season (.390), some think Penn State could perhaps be the best team to ever play women's college volleyball.\nTwo of the best middle blockers in NCAA history ended their careers as well. Stanford senior Foluke Akinradewo broke the NCAA Division I all-time career hitting percentage, ending her career with a .443 overall percentage. Penn State senior Christa Harmotto finished her career second all time in NCAA history, hitting .433 for her career."

        "title": "University Libraries at Bowling Green State University",
        "text": "The University Libraries are the academic library system for Bowling Green State University and its regional campuses.\nHistory.\nEstablishment.\nThe first library of the Bowling Green Normal College was established in 1914 in the basement of a nearby Methodist Church, with its first professional librarian hired in 1915. Also in 1915, the library was moved from its temporary location off campus to the third floor of University Hall.\nMcFall Center.\nIn 1927 the library moved into its first dedicated building, The McFall Center. In the 1950s, the old library was expanded; by 1961, it contained 330,000 items.\nJerome Library.\nConstruction of a new library began in 1965. In 1982, the completed building was named in honor of William Travers Jerome III, the sixth president of Bowling Green State University. As of 2017, Jerome Library served about 450,000 people annually and held over two million items.\nJerome Library.\nThe building was designed by state architect Carl E. Bentz. It features unique non-objective murals on its east and west facades, created by Don Drumm, an artist in residence during the 1960s. \nDrumm first outlined his contemporary designs on the concrete; construction crews then sandblasted the designs into the surface. Drumm added shadow pins to the west facade which cast light in a way that completed the mural. The nine-level, 156,895 square foot mural sits between Memorial and East Halls.\nThe William T. Jerome Library is open to the community. It is also a member of OhioLINK, a statewide library and information system that enables BGSU students, faculty, and staff to borrow books from other Ohio libraries and access many online research databases.\nLearning Commons.\nThe Learning Commons opened in the fall of 2011, consolidating the Study Skills Center, Writing Center, and Mathematics and Statistics Tutoring Center. It offers 13,565 square feet of study space, computers, and a tutorial center.\nSpecialized collections and branches.\nGovernment Documents (1st floor).\nBowling Green State University, which serves Ohio's 5th Congressional district, became a federal depository in 1933. Librarians select 57% of the offered items, receiving approximately 400 documents monthly. This collection of 700,000 publications is rich in historical and current material, including the following materials:\nThe collection emphasizes materials in business, civil rights, economics, education, environment, foreign relations, health, housing, justice, labor, presidential materials, small business, and social welfare. Librarians also select congressional materials, including hearings, reports, documents, floor debates, bills and public laws, and studies.\nThe department became an Ohio depository in 1953 and received all agency publications from the state depository program. As a result, the collection includes agency publications such as reports, directories, pamphlets, leaflets, posters, newsletters, and journals; Judicial Branch materials including administrative opinions and the Supreme Court of Ohio opinions and decisions; and Ohio General Assembly materials, including the Laws of Ohio and the House and Senate Journals.\nIn the early 1980s, selected material from the city of Bowling Green was added to the collection, including City Council Minutes, Mayor's Reports, the Bowling Green City Code of Ordinances, and the Annual Report of the Bowling Green Police Division.\nBGSU became a Canadian Government Documents Depository in October 1999. This collection focuses on business, environment, Great Lakes, Native Peoples, and social issues. It includes journals, reports, and cd-roms. The library also collects some of the essential statistical reports produced by Statistics Canada.\nCurriculum Resource Center.\nThe Curriculum Resource Center (CRC) supports the undergraduate and graduate teaching programs in the College of Education and Human Development and other BGSU education-related areas by maintaining a collection of high-quality preschool through grade twelve materials reflecting innovation in teaching practices and standards-based instruction. Materials held by the CRC comprise the Frances F. Povsic Collection, so named on March 30, 2001, in honor of Professor Povsic's significant, enduring, and distinctive contributions to the CRC, the University Libraries, and BGSU. The CRC is also home to the Children's Book Center\nMusic Library and Bill Schurk Sound Archives.\nThe Music Library and Bill Schurk Sound Archives, located on the third floor of Jerome Library, contains materials related to the study of music. Although the collection primarily supports the undergraduate and graduate programs in the College of Musical Arts, the Department of Popular Culture, and the Center for American Culture Studies, the resources of the library are available to all interested users.\nThe Music Library contains more than 60,000 books and scores related to all aspects of the study of music. Studies ranging from biography to general histories of music, from theoretical treatises to studies of such diverse elements as country music, opera, and band music are included in the collection. The score collection includes solos, orchestral studies, exercise books, and chamber music for ensembles from two to ten parts. The recordings collection, which circulates on a limited basis, contains more than 16,000 recordings of music from all periods of music history as well as ethnic music, musical theatre, and jazz. In addition, the Music Library maintains recital tapes from the College of Musical Arts dating from 1966. All masters' theses In addition, all documents written by graduate students in the College of Musical Arts are housed in the collection.\nThe Music Library houses two special collections: The Bill Schurk Sound Archives and the Archives of the MidAmerican Center for Contemporary Music. The Bill Schurk Sound Archives considered the nation's premier collection of popular music sound recordings, contains more than 700,000 recordings representing all styles of popular music and all recorded formats. Established in 1967 for the scholarly study of popular music, the Bill Schurk Sound Archives serves campus patrons and researchers from around the world. Discographies, books, and periodicals related to popular music and the recording industry are also included in this collection. Established in 1987, the Archives of the MidAmerican Center for Contemporary Music contains music submitted to and performed at the College of Musical Arts' New Music and Art Festival. The collection currently contains more than 3800 contemporary music scores, many in manuscript.\nBrowne Popular Culture Library.\nThe Browne Popular Culture Library (BPCL), founded in 1969 and dedicated to the acquisition and preservation of research materials on American popular culture (post-1876), is the most comprehensive repository of its kind in the United States.\nThe Browne Popular Culture Library holds more than 190,000 cataloged books. Popular fiction predominates, particularly novels in the romance, mystery-detective, science fiction-fantasy, and western genres. This Library also contains extensive collections of late 19th- and 20th-century juvenile/young adult series fiction.\nOther major strengths of the Browne Popular Culture Library include materials documenting popular entertainment and the entertainment industry (e.g., television, film, radio, and the mass communications industry), graphic arts, recreation and leisure, and popular religion. Non-fiction holdings also include books on the occult and supernatural, parapsychology, manner and customs, etiquette and advice, arts and crafts, hobbies, games and amusements, sports, foodways and cookery, domestic arts, costume and dress, and humor. Users can also find popular reference and informational materials (self-help and how-to books, for example) in the library's collections.\nIn addition to many rare hardcover and paperback books and magazines, the Browne Popular Culture Library houses archival and special collections, including literary manuscripts and movie and television scripts. Non-traditional library resources such as dime novels, story papers and nickel weeklies, pulp magazines, fanzines and other amateur publications, comic books and graphic novels, and posters, postcards, greeting cards, mail-order catalogs, and travel brochures, comprise some of the library's most unusual collections. There are approximately 85,000 comic books in the collection. The Browne Popular Culture Library also collects manuscripts to support and complement existing print collections.\nBPCL includes the Marie Wakefield Star Trek Collection. The Star Trek Collection includes Star Trek memorabilia given to the Popular Culture Library principally by Marie Wakefield but also contains items received from Sandra Springer and other miscellaneous sources. The collection consists of a wide range of materials including, but not limited to, books, journals, clothing items, models, posters, games, puzzles, greeting cards, playing and trading cards, and calendars.\nCenter for Archival Collections.\nThe Center for Archival Collections is an archives and manuscripts repository within the University Libraries at Bowling Green State University. The primary mission of the CAC is to actively acquire, preserve, and make accessible to researchers historical materials in Northwest Ohio. In addition, it houses the BGSU University Archives, the Historical Collections of the Great Lakes, a rare books collection, special collections, and the National Student Affairs Archives.\nThe collection emphasizes local history, Great Lakes maritime history, women's history, the Civil War, education, and all aspects of northwest Ohio's social, cultural, economic, and industrial history.\nHistorical Collections of the Great Lakes.\nThe Historical Collections of the Great Lakes (HCGL) is part of the Center for Archival Collections at Bowling Green State University.

        "text": "The Texas Tech Red Raiders baseball team represents Texas Tech University in NCAA Division I college baseball. The team competes in the Big 12 Conference and plays at Dan Law Field at Rip Griffin Park. Their head coach is Tim Tadlock and is entertaining his 9th season with the Red Raiders.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nAlong with the football and men's basketball teams, the Texas Tech baseball team was founded during the university's initial academic year, in 1925–26. The team's first series was against the West Texas A&amp;M Buffaloes in 1926, an 18–9 victory in the first game and 14–9 loss in the second. The third game in the team's history—this one against Daniel Baker College—ended in a 3–3 tie after 11 innings.\nE. Y. Freeland was the first coach of the Red Raiders, though the team was known as the Matadors at the time. He remained in the position for three years before R. Grady Higginbotham took the role. Higginbotham coached for only two years. From 1930 to 1953, Texas Tech did not field an intercollegiate baseball team.\nRevival era.\nWhen the program returned in 1954, Beattie Feathers became the head coach of the Red Raiders and remained until 1960. He was followed by Berl Huffman (1961–1967), Kal Segrist (1968–1983), and Gary Ashby (1984–1986). Texas Tech joined the Southwest Conference in 1968, but experienced little success. During this 26 season period, the Red Raiders had only seven winning seasons; only twice finishing as high as third, with only three winning records in conference play.\nModern era.\nLarry Hays took over the Red Raiders baseball team in 1987. Under Hays, Texas Tech endured only two losing seasons, his first and last, and enjoyed their greatest success in baseball. Hays took Texas Tech from having a losing tradition to being a national contender. When Hays started with the Red Raiders, the team's overall record stood at 550–576–5. By the time he left, he was the fourth-winningest coach in college baseball history and improved the team's record to 1,365–1,054–8. The Red Raiders reached eight straight NCAA tournaments from 1995 to 2002 and again in 2004, three of which were held at Dan Law Field at Rip Griffin Park. They also won the 1995 Southwest Conference championship, and the inaugural Big 12 Conference championship in 1997. The Hays-led Red Raiders also won the SWC Tournament in 1995, and the Big 12 Tournament in 1998.\nOn June 2, 2008, Larry Hays announced his retirement, paving the way for assistant coach Dan Spencer to take over. Spencer, a former Texas Tech player, won back-to-back national championships as an assistant head coach for the Oregon State Beavers. In Spencer's four seasons as head coach, he led the Red Raiders to only one winning season. Prior to Spencer's fourth, and final, season as head coach, Tim Tadlock was hired as associate head coach for the Red Raiders under Dan Spencer. The following season saw Tadlock replace Spencer as the ninth head coach of the Red Raiders following Spencer's firing.\nTadlock was a starting shortstop for the Red Raiders during the 1990 and 1991 seasons. Tadlock previously led the Grayson College Vikings to back-to-back NJCAA Division I World Series championships in the team's five appearances over his 9 seasons as head coach. Tadlock's first season saw the team finish 26–30, and 8th of 9 in Big 12 play. Prior to the 2014 season, the Red Raiders were selected to finish in 8th place in the Big 12 Conference in the preseason polls. In only his second season, the Red Raiders won their first NCAA tournament Regional Championship, defeating the Columbia Lions and host team Miami Hurricanes to advance to the program's first Super Regional appearance. The team would host College of Charleston in the Lubbock Super Regional before shutting them out twice in two 1–0 games, earning the programs first berth in the College World Series on the back of a 0.65 post season earned run average produced by assistant coach Ray Hayward's pitching staff. The Red Raiders have since gone on to win Big 12 regular season conference championships in 2016, 2017 and 2019 and again host both Regional and Super Regional rounds of the NCAA tournament in Lubbock while also making three more appearances in the College World Series (2016, 2018-2019).\nSeason-by-season results.\nSource:\nIndividual accomplishments.\nUnanimous All-American\nNational Pitcher of the Year Award\nBig 12 Conference Player of the Year\nBig 12 Conference Pitcher of the Year\nBig 12 Conference Freshman of the Year\nBig 12 Conference Coach of the Year\nBig 12 Conference Tournament MVP\nSouthwest Conference Coach of the Year\nSouthwest Conference Tournament MVP\nNCAA Division I Regional Tournament MVP\nSkip Bertman Award\nRed Raiders in the Major Leagues.\nAt least 30 former Texas Tech Red Raiders have gone on to play Major League Baseball."

The national team is controlled by the governing body for badminton in the country, USA Badminton. The woman's team has won a total of 3 consecutive titles in the Uber Cup from 1957 to 1963. The men's team were runners-up at the 1952 edition of the Thomas Cup where they lost to Malaya. \nIn individual events, the United States has won 1 gold medal in the BWF World Championships. It was won by Howard Bach and Tony Gunawan in the 2005 edition held in Anaheim, California.\nHistory.\nBadminton in the United States dates back to the late 19th century. The first American badminton club was formed in New York in 1878. During the 1930s, badminton had become a popular sport in the United States. Establishments such as the YMCA, universities and more all formed badminton clubs and the popularity of the sport began to take growth. The sport was also aided by the support of celebrity participation. \nCelebrities such as Bette Davis, Douglas Fairbanks, Dick Powell, and others all participated in the sport, helping badminton gain popularity during the mid-half of the 20th century.\nMen's team.\nThe United States competed in the first edition of the Thomas Cup in 1949. The team won bronze after losing 6–3 in the knockout stages to Malaya. American badminton legends Joe Alston and Wynn Rogers helped the team to advanced one step further and reach the final of the 1952 Thomas Cup when they defeated the Indian doubles pair and earned the winning point for the team. In the final of the 1952 Thomas Cup, the team lost to Malaya. After their participation in the 1967 Thomas Cup, the men's team started to show a decline in quality after failing to qualify for the Thomas Cup for almost 4 decades.\nIn 2004, the team qualified for the 2004 Thomas Cup again after they won the 2004 Pan American Men's Team Championships. The team were eliminated in the wild-card knockout stage thrice in 2004, 2006 and 2010. In 2022, the team finished in 4th place at the 2022 Pan Am Male Badminton Cup. The team however still qualified for the 2022 Thomas Cup after the withdrawal of New Zealand. They were placed in Group D with Malaysia, Japan and England.\nWomen's team.\nThe American women's team triumphed between the 1950s and the 1960s. They were the first to be crowned as Uber Cup champions in 1957. The team, led by stalwarts such as Judy Devlin and Margaret Varner first defeated Canada 7–0 in the qualifying round, then beat India 7–0 in the knockout round. In the final stage, they overcame their Danish opponents and defeated them 6–1 in the final. The team won their second Uber Cup by beating Denmark for a second time. In 1963, the American team won the Uber Cup title for a third time after winning 4–3 against England. In 1966, the team's Uber Cup reign came to an end when they lost 5–2 to Japan in the 1966 Uber Cup final. The women's team also suffered a massive decline after the 1960s and failed to qualify for the Uber Cup for a few years. The team finished third in the 1978 Uber Cup.\nIn 2006, the team qualified for the Uber Cup once again after failing to qualify for almost 30 years. The team were eliminated in the first round of the knockout stages. In 2022, the women's team won the 2022 Pan Am Female Badminton Cup and qualified for the 2022 Uber Cup. The team finished last in the group.\nMixed team.\nThe United States first competed in the 1989 Sudirman Cup. The team were grouped with New Zealand, Finland and Austria in the Group 5 classification group. The team lost 5–0 to New Zealand, then beat Finland and Austria 5–0 to finish in 21st place. In 2001, the team made history by winning their first mixed team title at the 2001 Pan Am Mixed Team Championships after beating Canada in the final. In the 2019 Sudirman Cup, the United States finished in 19th place after defeating Israel in the 19th place tie. \nIn 2023, the United States reached the final of the 2023 Pan Am Mixed Team Championships but lost 3–0 to Canada."

        "title": "2009 NBA Finals",
        "text": "The 2009 NBA Finals was the championship series of the National Basketball Association's (NBA) 2008–09 season and the conclusion of the season's playoffs, played from June 4 and 14, 2009. A best-of-seven playoff series, it was contested between the Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers, and the Eastern Conference champion Orlando Magic. The Lakers were heavily favored to win the championship over the Magic.\nThe Lakers defeated the Magic, four games to one, to win the franchise's 15th NBA championship. Kobe Bryant was named the Finals MVP. The Orlando Magic's Game 3 victory was the first win in an NBA Finals game in franchise history; they were previously swept in 1995 by the Houston Rockets.\nBackground.\nThe two team captains (the Lakers' Kobe Bryant and the Magic's Dwight Howard) were teammates and starters on the United States men's national team the previous summer, winning a gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Each player defeated another fellow Olympic starter in his respective conference final series: Bryant defeated Carmelo Anthony's Denver Nuggets and Howard advanced past LeBron James' Cleveland Cavaliers.\nThis series was nicknamed the \"Disney Series\" for its connections to The Walt Disney Company. Disney owns both ESPN, and Finals broadcaster ABC; Walt Disney World is located from Orlando in nearby Lake Buena Vista, and Disneyland is located from Los Angeles in nearby Anaheim.\nLos Angeles Lakers.\nThe Lakers were the favorite to emerge from the Western Conference, but their road to the Finals was a tough one. They played three physical series against the Utah Jazz, Houston Rockets, and Denver Nuggets, winning in 5, 7, and 6 games, respectively. Going into the Finals, the Lakers finished off the Nuggets in the Western Conference Finals with two good performances in Games 5 and 6, making analysts pick them as the favorites in the Finals. It was their sixth Finals appearance of the decade and a record-extending 30th Finals appearance overall, the most for any NBA team.\nOrlando Magic.\nThe Magic were overlooked by many to even reach the Eastern Conference Finals, as they played in the shadows of the #1-seeded Cleveland Cavaliers, led by regular-season MVP LeBron James, and defending champion #2-seed Boston Celtics. However, after dispatching the Philadelphia 76ers in six games, the Magic stunned the Celtics by winning Game 7 in Boston. The Celtics were previously 32–0 when leading a series 3–2, and 17–3 previously in Game 7s at home. Orlando assistant coach Patrick Ewing had publicly \"guaranteed\" that Orlando would win Game 7.\nIn the next round, Orlando was given little chance by many to defeat the top-seeded Cleveland Cavaliers, but a combination of three-point shooting and the inside presence of Dwight Howard created a matchup nightmare for Cleveland on defense, and Orlando ultimately won in six games. In Game 6, Howard's stellar performance with 40 points and 14 rebounds helped the franchise earn its second all-time Finals appearance and its first Finals appearance since 1995, where a Shaquille O'Neal and Penny Hardaway-led Magic were swept by the Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler-led Houston Rockets.\nSeries preview.\nAlthough the Magic won both regular-season matchups with the Lakers, Los Angeles was able to take four out of five games in this series. Both regular-season games and three of the NBA Finals games were close contests, decided by six points or fewer or in overtime. The Lakers won Game 2 on June 7, 101–96 in overtime. Then they won Game 4 on June 11 in overtime as well.\nTyronn Lue, a backup point guard with Orlando, appeared with the Lakers during their initial championship run in the early 2000s and faced his former team in the finals. Lue and another backup point guard, Anthony Johnson were the only players on Orlando's roster with NBA Finals experience. However, neither saw playing time during the series, as Lue was inactive with an injury and Johnson lost his minutes to teammate Jameer Nelson, who returned from a shoulder injury in time for the Finals, where he led the Magic to sweep the Lakers in regular season. Trevor Ariza, the Lakers starting small forward, faced the team that traded him to the Lakers in 2007.\nRegular-season series.\nThe Orlando Magic won both games in the regular-season series:\nSeries summary.\nStarting this Finals, Sunday games are now moved up to 8:00 PM (ET) from the previous 9:00 PM (ET) timeslot.\nGame summaries.\nGame 1.\nAfter an evenly battled first quarter, the Magic took the lead thanks to field goals and assists from point guard Jameer Nelson, who was playing his first game since injuring his shoulder during the regular season in February. Down 33–28 with 8:38 left in the 2nd quarter, the Lakers went on a 10–0 run and never looked back. The Lakers ended the 3rd quarter on a 25–10 run, led by the fierce play from Kobe Bryant, who finished with 40 points, 8 rebounds, and 8 assists, joining the likes of Shaquille O'Neal, Michael Jordan, and Jerry West to put up those numbers in a single NBA Finals game. The 25-point margin of victory was the 6th-largest in NBA Finals Game 1 history.\nDue to stellar defense by the Lakers, Dwight Howard was a dismal 1–6 from the field, his fewest made field goals in his playoff career, and finished with 12 points, 10 of which came from free throws. The Magic shot only 29.9% (23–77) from the field, the second lowest percentage in the NBA Finals.\nGame 2.\nBoth teams got off to a slow start and were tied at 15 after the first quarter, setting a record-low for combined score (30) in the first quarter of an NBA Finals game. The Lakers picked up the pace in the 2nd quarter, but Rashard Lewis kept the Magic in the game, scoring 18 of the team's 20 points in the quarter, including the final 16, on his way to a playoff career-high and Finals franchise-high 34 points for the game. The Magic outscored the Lakers in the 3rd quarter to take a 2-point lead in the 4th.\nWith the game tied at 84, Rashard Lewis hit a jumper with 1:32 remaining to give the Magic a 2-point lead. Kobe Bryant responded with a jumper of his own to tie the game. With 47 seconds left, Hedo Türkoğlu hit a jumper that was originally called a three-pointer. However, replay showed that his foot was on the line, giving the Magic a two-point lead. With 33 seconds remaining, Dwight Howard was able to deflect, but not steal, a Derek Fisher pass, and Pau Gasol was able to again tie the game at 88 with a layup.\nOn the ensuing Magic possession, the Lakers played great defense and forced Courtney Lee to miss an awkward layup shot with 10.5 seconds left. With a chance to take a 2–0 series lead, Kobe Bryant was blocked on a jumper by Türkoğlu, who gained control of the ball and called time-out with 0.6 seconds left. After another timeout, Türkoğlu threw a half-court lob to Courtney Lee, who had come free after a screen on his defender. However, Lee was traveling too fast and launched his layup from almost behind the backboard, causing it to miss.\nWith the Lakers up 1 in overtime with 1:55 left, Derek Fisher stole a JJ Redick pass and was fouled on the ensuing fast break, making both free throws. After the Magic were unable to convert, Kobe Bryant made a pivotal assist to Pau Gasol for a layup-and-one, giving the Lakers a 6-point lead and the eventual victory.\nGame 3.\nThe Magic came out in Game 3 with fire. The Magic shot a field goal percentage of 63% for the game, a Finals record. This also included a 75% first quarter, also a Finals record. However, despite the incredible shooting percentage, the Lakers managed to stay close for much of the game. The game was only sealed for the Magic on a Mickaël Piétrus steal from Kobe Bryant in the waning minute of the 4th quarter.\nThis win marked the first Finals win in Magic franchise history, losing their first 6 Finals games (being swept in their first appearance and losing Games 1 and 2)\nGame 4.\nComing off their franchise's first NBA Finals game victory, the Magic quickly took the lead in the first quarter. However, Kobe Bryant kept the Lakers in the game, scoring 13 of the team's 20 first-quarter points. Dwight Howard played a great first quarter, with 11 rebounds and 4 blocks in the opening frame. In addition, he drew many fouls, putting Andrew Bynum, Pau Gasol, and Lamar Odom in foul trouble and forcing Lakers coach Phil Jackson to use Josh Powell and D. J. Mbenga early in the game. The Magic were able to increase the lead to 12 at halftime.\nThe Lakers came out of the locker room aggressive and outscored the Magic 30–14 in the 3rd quarter, led by Trevor Ariza, who scored 13 points in the quarter, including two three-pointers. Down by six in the opening minutes of the 4th quarter, the Magic took a 76–75 lead halfway through the quarter, but were unable to increase the lead due to poor free-throw shooting, specifically from Hedo Türkoğlu and Dwight Howard.\nWith 3 minutes left in the 4th quarter and the game tied at 79, Howard converted a three-point play to give the Magic an 82–79 lead. On the next Laker possession, the Magic played good defense, but Trevor Ariza was able to hit a 3-pointer as the shot clock expired to tie the game at 82. After Hedo Türkoğlu hit a stepback 3-point shot, Howard blocked Gasol's jumper, giving him a single-game NBA Finals record with 9 blocked shots. On the bench to witness it was a previous record holder, his assistant coach Patrick Ewing, who had 8 in Game 5 of the 1994 NBA Finals while with the New York Knicks. Türkoğlu made another jumper with 1:34 remaining to give the Magic a five-point lead.\nDown 87–82 with 31 seconds left, Kobe Bryant spun through the lane and passed to Gasol for a dunk to cut the lead to three. On the next Magic possession, Howard was fouled by Bryant with 11 seconds remaining. Needing just one free-throw to make the game a 2-possession affair, Howard missed both shots.\nOut of the timeout, the Lakers elected to take the ball out at three-quarters court instead of half-court in order to space out the floor. The Magic double-teamed Bryant in the backcourt, allowing him to pass the ball up to Ariza, who in turned passed it to Derek Fisher on the right wing. Having missed his first five three-point shots of the game, Fisher spotted up and hit a pivotal three-pointer over Jameer Nelson to tie the game at 87 with 4.6 seconds left. On the final possession of regulation, Mickaël Piétrus missed a 20-footer.\nThe overtime session began with a three-pointer by Rashard Lewis and two contested jumpers by Kobe Bryant to give the Lakers a 91–90 lead. With 1:27 left in overtime, Howard split a pair of free throws to tie the game at 91. On the next possession, the Lakers would miss a layup and a jumper, but regained possession on an offensive rebound by Ariza and a loose-ball foul on Jameer Nelson. With 31 seconds left, Kobe Bryant passed out of a double-team with the controversy of no called after Jameer Nelson got hit by Kobe Elbow as Fisher hit a three-pointer to give the Lakers a 94–91 lead.\nOut of a timeout, Türkoğlu rushed a three-point shot and missed. Rashard Lewis backtapped the rebound to center court, but the ball went to Pau Gasol, who ran in unimpeded for a dunk, giving the Lakers the lead for good. In the next possession, the Magic missed another shot, bouncing the ball to Fisher, who passed it to Ariza, then to Gasol for a dunk, but Pietrus slammed both arms on his back, resulting in Gasol getting a technical foul and Pietrus a flagrant-1 foul.\nUpon the game's finish, Oasis's \"Don't Look Back in Anger\" was played throughout Amway Arena.\nGame 5.\nThe Magic, facing the prospect of the Lakers winning a championship on their home floor, came out with a good start, leading by as much as 9 in the first quarter. In the opening frame, all 5 starters scored and assisted on at least one field goal, but the Lakers pulled within two at the quarter break. Down 40–36 with 7:11 in the 2nd quarter, the Lakers went on a 16–0 run, fueled by two 3-pointers and solid defensive play from Trevor Ariza. The Lakers led by as much as 12 in the 2nd quarter and the score was 56–46 at halftime.\nComing out of the half, Orlando cut the lead to 5 with 7:45 remaining in the 3rd on a three-pointer by Rafer Alston. Lamar Odom answered with back-to-back three-pointers to restore the Laker lead to double digits. Leading by as much as 18 in the half, Los Angeles led by 15 going into the 4th quarter. In the final quarter, Orlando attempted a run but managed to cut the lead down to only 12; at the buzzer, the Lakers celebrated their 15th title.\nFollowing the game, NBA commissioner David Stern presented the Lakers with the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy and presented Kobe Bryant with the Bill Russell NBA Finals MVP Trophy during a presentation on center court at Amway Arena. Bryant averaged 32.4 points, 5.6 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game during the series.\nStatistics.\nThe series was the third straight championship the Lakers clinched on the road (after 2001 and 2002); the last time the Lakers clinched the championship at home was in 2000. With their team's win, Pau Gasol became the first Spaniard and D. J. Mbenga the first Belgian Congolese player to win an NBA championship. Bill and Luke Walton became the third father-son pair to each win a championship as a player; the other father-son combinations are Matt Guokas, Sr. (1947) with Matt Jr. (1967) and Rick Barry (1975) with son Brent (2005 and 2007). Kobe Bryant averaged 32.4 points and 7.4 assists in this series, which was the best combination of those categories since Jerry West averaged 37.9 points and 7.4 assists (1969).\nFor the Magic, Game 3 marked their first Finals game victory in franchise history after losing their first six Finals games, including being swept in their first Finals appearance in 1995. In Game 3, the Magic set the Finals record for the best field goal percentage with 63 percent, and the Finals record for best field goal percentage in the first half with 75 percent. As of 2023, this is the most recent Magic finals appearance.\nThis was the first NBA Finals series since 1984 to have two games go into overtime (Games 2 and 4); both were won by the Lakers. Dwight Howard set an NBA Finals single-game record with 9 blocked shots in Game 4. The previous record holders, all of whom had blocked eight shots in a Finals game, were: Bill Walton of the Portland Trail Blazers in Game 6 of the 1977 NBA Finals; Hakeem Olajuwon of the Houston Rockets in Game 5 of the 1986 NBA Finals; Howard's assistant coach Patrick Ewing of the New York Knicks in Game 5 of the 1994 NBA Finals; Shaquille O'Neal of the Los Angeles Lakers in Game 2 of the 2001 NBA Finals; and Tim Duncan of the San Antonio Spurs in Game 6 of the 2003 NBA Finals.\nThis was the seventh time in NBA Finals history that a team that lost the championship the previous season has won the Finals the very next year. It is the second time in Lakers history, after the 1984 and 1985 teams.\nThis was also the first odd season since 2001 that the San Antonio Spurs did not win the NBA Finals; they won in 2003, 2005, and 2007.\nThis was the last Finals in which a trophy silhouette was painted in mid-court. The tradition began in 2005 and ended for the 2010 series. This was also the last NBA Finals to be played at Amway Arena; the Magic moved to the Amway Center for the 2010–11 season.\nInternational broadcasts.\nAside from ABC (U.S.) and TSN (Canada), other broadcasters across the world covered the Finals:\nImpact and aftermath.\nLakers.\nThe series win brought the Lakers' franchise championship total to 15, trailing only to the Boston Celtics. The championship was the fourth of the 2000s decade for the Lakers, most among all teams in the four major professional sports leagues in North America.\nBy virtue of their win this year and loss in the previous year, this marked tenth occurrence that the winners of the NBA Finals were losers in the preceding year's Finals, previously the Detroit Pistons had lost and won the Finals in and respectively. The victory was noted by many as a personal success for Finals MVP Kobe Bryant, winning his first championship and succeeding in the playoffs without the presence of former Lakers center Shaquille O'Neal where some people had previously speculated that Bryant could not \"win one without Shaq\". Head coach Phil Jackson captured his 10th NBA championship as a coach, surpassing Red Auerbach for most championships all-time by an NBA coach. Jackson also passed Auerbach and NHL coach Scotty Bowman for most championships all-time by a head coach in a major American sports league. Having achieved three Game 1 victories throughout the postseason (first round vs. Utah, conference finals vs. Denver, and NBA Finals vs. Orlando), Phil Jackson-coached teams were now 44–0 in series where they win the first game, later improved to 48–0 by the time Jackson retired after the 2011 NBA Playoffs.\nThe Lakers' only offseason change was the acquisition of Ron Artest from the Houston Rockets, in an essential trade where they let Trevor Ariza sign with the Rockets. Again the Lakers won the top seed in the West, though winning just eight games less than the year before. They eliminated the Oklahoma City Thunder in six, the Utah Jazz in four, and the Phoenix Suns in six to return to the NBA Finals and renew their heated rivalry with the Celtics. In the Finals the Lakers won a hard-fought seven game series against the Celtics to retain the NBA title, becoming the first team to repeat as champions since the 2002 Lakers.\nMagic.\nThe Magic again won 59 games and the division title in the 2009–10 season, in which they relinquished Hedo Türkoğlu to the Toronto Raptors and acquired 8-time All-Star and NBA veteran Vince Carter from the New Jersey Nets. Dwight Howard won Defensive Player of the Year for the second straight year. In the playoffs the Magic swept the Charlotte Bobcats and the Atlanta Hawks, becoming the first team in NBA history to win their first eight playoff games by 20 or more points. However, the Magic would lose to the Boston Celtics in six games of the Eastern Conference Finals, marking the final games held at Amway Arena. The Magic moved to the Amway Center the next season, then proceeded to lose in the first round for two straight years to the Hawks and the Indiana Pacers, respectively. After the 2011–12 season Stan Van Gundy was fired, and in a blockbuster offseason trade, Howard was traded to the Lakers, which he spent one season with the Lakers and later move to Houston Rockets. However, the team failed to reach NBA Finals due to the rise of the Golden State Warriors. Thus, Howard return to the Eastern Conference teams after signing with Atlanta Hawks."

Da'Tara went off at 38–1 odds, making the win a monumental upset. Entrants included the favorite, winner of both the Kentucky Derby and Preakness, Big Brown, but he eased on last place, a first for any Triple Crown hopeful. A win by Big Brown would have marked the first Triple Crown since Affirmed in 1978. Other entrants were Derby runners Denis of Cork, Tale of Ekati, and Anak Nakal; Preakness runner up Macho Again and third-place finisher Icabad Crane; and Peter Pan runner, Ready's Echo. The sire of Anak Nakal, Victory Gallop, is a Belmont winner, while Casino Drive has two Belmont-winning siblings.\nCasino Drive was scratched from the race the morning of the race with an injured hoof. He was the Peter Pan Stakes winner, and the half brother of 2007 Belmont Stakes winner Rags to Riches and 2006 Belmont Stakes winner Jazil. A win by Casino Drive would have been the first time that siblings have won the same Triple Crown race in three consecutive years.

The woman, then 33, recalls being taken to an apartment, where she claims Batch, Ward and Talton repeatedly raped her, according to the suit.

        "text": "The 2011 UEFA Champions League final was an association football match played on 28 May 2011 at Wembley Stadium in London that decided the winner of the 2010–11 season of the UEFA Champions League. The winners received the European Champion Clubs' Cup (the European Cup). The 2011 final was the culmination of the 56th season of the tournament, and the 19th in the Champions League era.\nThe final was contested by Barcelona of Spain and Manchester United of England, in a repeat of the 2009 final held in Rome, which Barcelona won 2–0. The match kicked off at 19:45 BST. The referee for the match was Viktor Kassai from Hungary. The venue, the new Wembley Stadium, hosted its first European Cup final, having opened in 2007; the old Wembley Stadium hosted the finals in 1963, 1968, 1971, 1978 and 1992.\nBoth teams entered the competition having won it three times previously; Manchester United in 1968, 1999 and 2008, and Barcelona in 1992, 2006 and 2009. To reach the final, in the knockout phase Barcelona beat Arsenal, Shakhtar Donetsk and lastly Real Madrid in the 212th \"El Clásico\" derby, while Manchester United beat Marseille, Chelsea and Schalke 04. Both teams also entered the final as champions of their domestic leagues (the Premier League and La Liga, respectively), but neither team had won a domestic cup that season.\nBarcelona dominated the match, winning 3–1 with goals from Pedro, Lionel Messi and David Villa, securing their fourth Champions League title. Wayne Rooney scored for Manchester United to level the score going into half-time.\nAs a result, Barcelona qualified to play against Porto, the winners of the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League, in the 2011 UEFA Super Cup in Monaco on 26 August 2011, and they also earned a place in the semi-finals of the 2011 FIFA Club World Cup in December 2011 as the UEFA representative.\nBackground.\nThe original Wembley Stadium hosted five European Cup finals prior to 2011. The 1968 and 1978 finals were both won by English sides: Manchester United beat Benfica 4–1 in 1968 and Liverpool defeated Club Brugge 1–0 in 1978. Benfica also lost in the 1963 final, beaten 2–1 by A.C. Milan, while Ajax won the first of three consecutive European Cups at Wembley in 1971, beating Panathinaikos 2–0. In the 1992 final, Spanish club Barcelona defeated Italian side Sampdoria 1–0 in the final match played as the European Cup prior to the following season's introduction of the current Champions League format.\nFirst opened for the British Empire Exhibition in 1923, the stadium was originally known as the Empire Stadium. That year, it hosted its first FA Cup Final, when almost 200,000 spectators attempted to watch the match between Bolton Wanderers and West Ham United. Wembley played host to all of England's matches at the 1966 FIFA World Cup, including the 4–2 victory over West Germany in the final, and at UEFA Euro 1996. The original stadium was closed in 2000 and demolished three years later, to be replaced by a 90,000-capacity arena, which opened in 2007.\nThe match was a rematch of the final two years earlier, which Barcelona had won 2–0 in Rome. United and Barcelona had both won three European titles prior to the match. United had won three years earlier against Chelsea, Bayern Munich in 1999, and Benfica in 1968. Barcelona had won their first title 19 years earlier, against Sampdoria at the Wembley Stadium. They then won their second title in 2006, beating Arsenal 2–1 in Paris. The most recent title win for Barcelona was against United in 2009 and it was the most recent final for both of these teams. However, in 2008, United defeated Barcelona 1–0 on aggregate, at the semi-final stage, en route to claiming their third trophy. Barcelona were appearing in the final for the third time in six years while United were for the third time in four years.\nRoad to the final.\n\"Note: In all results below, the score of the finalist is given first (H: home; A: away).\"\nPre-match.\nVenue.\nWembley Stadium was selected as the venue for the 2011 UEFA Champions League final at a meeting of the UEFA Executive Committee in Nyon, Switzerland, on 29 January 2009. Other stadia in contention to host the final included the Allianz Arena in Munich and Berlin's Olympiastadion. The Allianz Arena instead hosted the 2012 final. The weekend set aside by UEFA for the 2011 Champions League final was originally scheduled by The Football League as the date for the Football League play-off finals, which are traditionally held on the British May bank holiday weekend; however, due to UEFA's requirement that they be given exclusive use of the venue in the lead-up to the final, the play-off finals had to be relocated. Due to this breach of their contract with The Football Association, The Football League demanded compensation. On 21 January 2011, as part of a settlement agreement with the FA, the League One and League Two play-off finals were moved to Old Trafford, Manchester, to be played respectively on 29 May and 28 May 2011; the Championship play-off final was not rescheduled. The Conference National play-off final was also moved to Manchester, to be played at the City of Manchester Stadium on 21 May 2011.\nUEFA's ambassador for the 2011 Champions League final was the former Tottenham Hotspur forward Gary Lineker. In his first duty as ambassador, on 26 August 2010, Lineker helped to conduct the draw for the group stage of the competition. Lineker was later involved in the unveiling of the branding design for the 2011 final at an event at Wembley Stadium on 25 November 2010. Hosted by Sky Sports presenter Richard Keys, the event was also attended by UEFA competitions director Giorgio Marchetti, former British Minister for Sport and representative of the City of London Kate Hoey, General Secretary of The Football Association Alex Horne, and England Women's international Faye White. The logo for the final is in the style of a heraldic crest and features the European Champion Clubs' Cup in the centre, flanked by two lions. According to the designers of the logo, London-based Radiant Studios, the lions are intended to represent the two teams that would contest the final, battling over the trophy. The use of traditional elements in a contemporary style in the design is said to have been inspired by modern British designers such as Vivienne Westwood and tailors on Savile Row.\nOfficials.\nIn May 2011, Hungarian referee Viktor Kassai was chosen to referee the final. He was joined by fellow Hungarians Gabor Erös and György Ring as assistant referees, fourth official István Vad, additional assistant referees Tamás Bognár and Mihaly Fabian, and reserve assistant referee Róbert Kispál.\nTicketing.\nAlthough Wembley Stadium can usually hold up to 90,000 spectators, the capacity for the 2011 Champions League final was approximately 86,000. The two teams that reached the final were allocated 25,000 tickets each, while a further 11,000 tickets were put on general sale. The application period for the latter opened on 24 February 2011 and closed at 17:00 GMT on 18 March, with recipients to be determined by a random ballot before 6 April.\nA ticket launch event was held at London's City Hall on 17 February 2011, at which the above ticketing process was explained. The event was also used to promote the start of ticket sales, and was attended by final ambassador Gary Lineker, his women's final counterpart Hope Powell, UEFA Champions Festival ambassador Graeme Le Saux, UEFA fourth vice-president Marios N. Lefkaritis, and vice-chairman of The Football Association Barry Bright. Le Saux and Powell were presented with the first symbolic tickets for the final by four local schoolchildren.\nMatch ball.\nAs with the previous ten UEFA Champions League finals, beginning with the 2001 final, the match ball was provided by German sports equipment company Adidas. Revealed on 3 March 2011 at Wembley Stadium, the \"Adidas Finale London\" features the \"Starball\" design synonymous with the UEFA Champions League. In reflection of the St George's Cross seen on the flag of England, the ball itself is white with red stars, connecting to a central, bright orange star. Technically, the ball shares its structure with the \"Adidas Finale Madrid\", which was used for the 2010 final.\nOpening ceremony.\nThe 2011 Champions League final was officially opened on 21 May 2011 with the opening of the 2011 UEFA Champions Festival at Speakers' Corner in Hyde Park, London. The festival ran for the entire week leading up to the show-piece match at Wembley, closing a few hours before kick-off. Among the attractions at the festival were displays detailing the history of the European Cup, miniature football pitches for use by the public, and the trophy itself.\nThe UEFA Champions League Anthem was performed by British classical crossover group All Angels. The opening ceremony also featured a performance from English rapper Tinchy Stryder.\nBroadcasting.\nThe match was shown on ITV and Sky Sports in the United Kingdom. In the United States, Fox aired the final for the second consecutive year. UK-based outside broadcast facilities provider NEP Visions provided host coverage of the event. In South America, Rede Globo and Rede Bandeirantes broadcast the match for Brazil. Sky Deutschland (Pay TV) and Sat. 1 were broadcasting the match for Germany, public broadcaster SF 2 showed the final in Switzerland, as well as, the public broadcaster ORF 1 in Austria.\nThe match was broadcast live in 3D in the Trädgår'n club hall in Gothenburg, Sweden on the \"Guinness Book of World Records\"' largest television.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nFirst half.\nBarcelona outplayed Manchester United, controlling 68% of possession and having 22 attempts on goal compared to United's four. United's game plan was to get bodies in front of Barcelona's attack and hope to keep the ball away from their end whenever they received possession. United would therefore often try long balls as their method of attack. Manchester United started the better of the sides, with more possession and brief sights of goal in the opening minutes. Javier Hernández had a shot towards goal blocked, and another fly over the bar (he had been offside anyway in the approach play). Barcelona came into the game after their slow start and created a few chances. David Villa had a shot from range go just wide in the 19th minute, and another in the 21st minute was saved well by Van der Sar. Barcelona then took the lead in the 27th minute when Xavi played in Pedro, who struck from inside the penalty area. It looked as if Barcelona could keep possession to win the game with just that goal. However, United equalised seven minutes later against the run of play. After some pressuring by United on Barcelona who were taking a throw-in deep in their own half, Wayne Rooney received the ball, played a one-two with Ryan Giggs, and curled the ball into the corner from 15 yards. Replays showed that Giggs may have been just offside in the approach play. On the stroke of half-time, Messi almost latched onto a cross from Villa but could not turn it into the net from a few yards out. The whistle blew soon afterwards for half-time.\nSecond half.\nBarcelona's dominance continued in the second half. Messi almost gave Barcelona the lead in the 52nd minute when he latched onto a rebound from a Van der Sar save from Dani Alves, but Patrice Evra cleared off the line with his head. Barcelona regained the lead in the 54th minute when Messi received the ball and fired home from 20 yards out. Barcelona dominated for the next 15 minutes or so. Messi turned Rio Ferdinand and got a shot away from about eight yards out, forcing a save from Van der Sar. In the 66th minute, Xavi had a long shot saved by Van der Sar, and Iniesta had another long shot saved by the United keeper a few minutes later. A third goal came in the 69th minute. David Villa got the ball about 20 yards out and curled a shot into the top corner to seal the result. United tried to hit back immediately with an attack, with Rooney having a curling shot go just over the bar. Nani then made a run across Barcelona's 18-yard box in the 85th minute and got a shot away which went just wide. But there was no way back for United and Barcelona held on comfortably to win their fourth European title and the third in six years.\nDetails.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nPost-match.\nTrophy presentation and celebrations.\nIn a gesture by his teammates, Eric Abidal, who had undergone surgery only two months earlier to remove a tumour in his liver, was given the honour of wearing the captain's armband during the trophy presentation ceremony. He was the first player to lift the trophy. Speaking afterwards, Abidal, who was in tears, appreciated the gesture, and spoke of how \"special\" his club was.\nBarcelona coach Pep Guardiola singled out Messi after the game, stating the Argentine was \"the best player [he'd] ever seen\" and that Messi \"made the difference\" in the game. Meanwhile, Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson acknowledged that the Barcelona side was the best team he had ever faced. His sentiments were echoed by United captain Nemanja Vidić and defender Rio Ferdinand.\nGerard Piqué cut the mesh from the net in front of the Barcelona fans where Barcelona had scored the two winning goals, and took it back to the club museum at the Camp Nou. The Barcelona players, coaches, and their families then formed a circle at centre field and danced. The sprinklers at Wembley came on at this time and the players and coaches celebrated under them.\nThe match was the last for Manchester United goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar, who had announced his retirement from football to follow the 2011 season."

        "title": "Sunningdale Golf Club",
        "text": "Sunningdale Golf Club is a golf club in Sunningdale, Berkshire, England, located approximately west-southwest of London.\nSunningdale Golf Club was founded in 1900 and has two eighteen hole golf courses: the Old Course, designed by Willie Park Jr., and the New Course, designed by Harry Colt, which opened in 1923.\nSunningdale has hosted many prestigious events in golf, including the British Masters, Walker Cup, Women's British Open, and The Senior Open Championship. From 2004 to 2013, Europe's International Final Qualifying tournament for The Open Championship was held over both the Old and New courses at Sunningdale. It hosted the Seniors Amateur Championship in 2017.\nHistory.\nSunningdale Golf Club was founded in 1900 on Chobham Common, on land owned by St. John's College, Cambridge. Its first Secretary was Harry Colt, who went on to design golf courses of international renown, such as the New Course at Sunningdale, Ealing, and Swinley Forest. Colt was highly influential in the creation of the Pine Valley Golf Club in New Jersey, widely acknowledged as one of the best golf courses in the world. The original 18-hole course, set in a heathland area, with sandy subsoil amid mixed treed foliage, was designed by Willie Park Jr., and was ready for play in 1901. It was also among the first successful courses located away from the seaside, as many people had thought at the time that turf would not grow well in such regions.\nFrom the start, Sunningdale was well regarded and has hosted many important events. Examples include News of the World Match Play in 1903, 1907, 1912, and 1922; several stagings of the British Masters in the 1940s and 1950s; the 1974–79 Colgate European Open; the 1987 Walker Cup; the 1985, 1986, 1988, and 1992 European Open and the 1997, 2001, 2004, and 2008 Women's British Open. The Open Championship, International Final Qualifying has been held annually over the Old and New Courses since 2004. It was also the venue of the 2009 Senior British Open Championship, which was won by Loren Roberts. It hosted the Senior Open Championship again in July 2015, the winner being Marco Dawson. Bobby Jones had great fondness for Sunningdale. He scored 66-68 over it during qualifying for the 1926 British Open, with the 66 consisting of 33 full strokes and 33 putts, with every hole played in either 3 or 4; this has sometimes been described as the perfect round of golf. Jones said afterwards: \"I wish I could take this course home with me.\" The original course is now called the Old Course, with the club having opened the New Course in 1923; it is also excellent and was designed by Harry Colt.\nColt was also the first secretary of Sunningdale, and recollections of his days at the club are described in \"Sheridan of Sunningdale\", a unique history of the early years of Sunningdale, which was written in 1967 by Jimmy Sheridan, caddie master at Sunningdale for 56 years from 1910. The book is available on Kindle.\nThe club's first professional was Jack White, winner of the 1904 Open Championship, played at Royal St. George's. The course record on the Old Course is 62, jointly held by Nick Faldo at the 1986 European Open and Shane Lowry in the first round of Open Championship qualifying in 2010. Graeme Storm holds the course record on the New Course, a 62 recorded during the Open Championship, International Final Qualifying, Europe, 2009.\nIn the final round of the 2004 Women's British Open at Sunningdale (Old), eventual winner, English professional Karen Stupples began her round with an eagle followed by an albatross on the two opening par-5 holes. This score of five under par after only two holes is believed to be a world record at any level of competition.\nLike many golf courses in Britain, Sunningdale is dog-friendly; canines are very welcome to accompany their owners on the course, provided they can conduct themselves reasonably. Halfway on the course is a refreshment hut known for its sausages and other victuals."

It was preceded by the European Championship which was held from 1910 to 1932. The first World Championship tournament was decided at the 1920 Summer Olympics. Subsequently, ice hockey was featured at the Winter Olympic Games, where the World Championship was decided when the two events occurred concurrently, until the 1968 Winter Olympics. The first three championships were contested at the Olympics, while the first World Championships that were an individual event were held in 1930.\nThe modern format for the World Championship features 16 teams in the championship group, 12 teams in Division I and 12 teams in Division II. If there are more than 40 teams, the rest compete in Division III. The teams in the championship play a preliminary and qualifying round, then the top eight teams play in the playoff medal round and the winning team is crowned World Champion. From the 1920 Olympics until the 1976 World Championships, only athletes designated as \"amateur\" were allowed to compete in the tournament. Because of this, players from the National Hockey League and its senior minor-league teams were not allowed to compete, while the Soviet Union was allowed to use permanent full-time players who were positioned as regular workers of an aircraft industry or tractor industry employer that sponsored what would be presented as an after-hours amateur social sports society team for their workers. In 1970, after an agreement to allow just a small number of its professionals to participate was rescinded by the IIHF, Canada withdrew from the tournament. Starting in 1977, professional athletes were allowed to compete in the tournament and Canada re-entered, using some NHL players from those teams that were not good enough to reach the Stanley Cup playoffs.\nAs of 2022, 85 tournaments have been staged. From 1920 to 1930, the Winter Olympic Games Ice Hockey Tournaments held counted as the World Championships and no tournaments in between were held. No championships were held from 1940 to 1946 due to World War II, nor during the Olympic years 1980, 1984 and 1988, nor in 2020 due to COVID-19 pandemic. Ten nations have won a gold medal at the World Championships and a total of fourteen have won medals. Canada has won 53 medals overall and 28 gold, the most of any nation. The Soviet Union, which began competing in the year of 1954 and last competed in 1991, captured a medal in each of 34 tournaments they entered. In winning the 2006 World Championships, Sweden became the first nation in ice hockey history to win an Olympic gold as well as a separate World Championship in the same season.

The game was played on July 15, 1975, at Milwaukee County Stadium in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, home of the Milwaukee Brewers of the American League. The game resulted in a 6–3 victory for the NL.\nWhile this was the first time that the Brewers were acting as hosts of the All-Star Game, this was not the first time the game had been played at Milwaukee County Stadium. The 1955 game had been played there when the Braves had called Milwaukee home. Thus, Milwaukee County Stadium joined Sportsman's Park in St. Louis and Shibe Park in Philadelphia as the only stadiums to host All-Star Games with two different franchises as host.\nThis would also be the last time Milwaukee County Stadium would host the game. When the game returned to Milwaukee in 2002, the Brewers had moved into their new home at Miller Park.\nThe 1975 All-Star Game saw the start of the tradition of naming honorary captains to the All-Star teams. The first honorary captains were Mickey Mantle (for the AL) and Stan Musial (for the NL).\nIt would also mark the final All-Star Game in which only \"The Star-Spangled Banner\", sung this year by Glen Campbell, was performed prior to the game. Beginning the following year, \"O Canada\" would also be performed as part of the All-Star pregame ceremonies.\nNational League roster.\nThe National League roster included 8 future Hall of Fame players, denoted in \"italics\".\nAmerican League roster.\nThe American League roster included 9 future Hall of Fame players, denoted in \"italics\".\nStarting lineups.\nWhile the starters were elected by the fans, the batting orders and starting pitchers were selected by the managers.\nScoring summary.\nThe National League took a 2–0 lead in the top of the second off of AL starter Vida Blue when Steve Garvey and Jimmy Wynn led off the inning by hitting back-to-back home runs.\nThe NL added another run in the top of the third, this time off of new AL relief pitcher Steve Busby. Lou Brock opened the inning with a single. With Joe Morgan batting, Busby balked, sending Brock to second base. After Morgan flew out, Johnny Bench came to bat, during which, Brock stole third base. Bench singled, scoring Brock from third base to give the NL a 3–0 lead.\nThe AL did not respond until the bottom of the sixth inning. Tom Seaver had just entered the game as the NL's relief pitcher. Joe Rudi led off with a single, and was immediately replaced for pinch runner George Hendrick. With Graig Nettles batting, Hendrick stole second base. After Nettles struck out, Gene Tenace walked. Carl Yastrzemski pinch hit for Jim Kaat, and hit a home run, scoring Hendrick and Tenace to tie the score.\nAL pitcher Catfish Hunter was entering his third inning of relief work when the NL closed out the scoring in the top of the ninth. Reggie Smith singled. Al Oliver, pinch hitting for Jon Matlack, doubled, sending Smith to third base. Catfish Hunter was replaced by relief pitcher Goose Gossage. The next batter, Larry Bowa, was hit by a pitch, and went to first base, loading the bases. Bill Madlock singled, scoring Smith and Oliver, sending Bowa to third base, and advancing himself to second base on a Gene Tenace throwing error. Pete Rose hit a sacrifice fly, scoring Bowa, sending Madlock to third base, and securing a 6–3 win for the National League.\nGame notes and records.\nJon Matlack was credited with the win. Catfish Hunter was charged with the loss.\nThis was Hank Aaron's 25th and final All-Star Game. It was his first and only appearance for the American League squad, and came in the former home of the Milwaukee Braves, the first Major League team for which he had played."

Truman Sports Complex, hosted the 1974 Pro Bowl about six months after this game.\nThis game marked the 40th anniversary year of the first All-Star Game in 1933. As a part of that recognition, some of the surviving stars from that first game, including Dick Bartell, Joe Cronin, Jimmie Dykes, Charlie Gehringer, Lefty Gomez, Lefty Grove, Bill Hallahan, and Carl Hubbell were in attendance.\nNational League roster.\nThe National League roster included 11 future Hall of Fame players and coaches, denoted in \"italics\".\nAmerican League roster.\nThe American League roster included 11 future Hall of Fame players and coaches, denoted in \"italics\".\nStarting lineups.\nWhile the starters were elected by the fans, the batting orders and starting pitchers were selected by the managers.\nScoring summary.\nScoring began in the bottom of the second inning, with Rick Wise in his second and final inning of pitching for the NL. Reggie Jackson led off with a double, and came home when the next batter, Amos Otis, singled. This would be the beginning and end of scoring for the American League.\nThe National League wasted no time coming back, taking advantage of new pitcher, Bert Blyleven, in the top of the third inning. Darrell Evans, pinch hitting for Rick Wise, walked, and was forced out at second base when Pete Rose hit into a fielder's choice. Joe Morgan walked. César Cedeño's single scored Rose, and sent Morgan to third base. Hank Aaron singled to Murcer who threw out Cedeño at third, but not before Morgan had scored to give the NL a 2–1 lead.\nThe NL added a single run in the top of the fourth inning, as Johnny Bench, the first hitter AL relief pitcher Bill Singer faced, hit a lead off home run.\nIn the top of the fifth inning, the NL scoring continued off of Bill Singer. Joe Morgan led off with a double. Three hitters later, with two outs, Bobby Bonds hit a two-run home run, bringing the score to 5–1.\nIn the top of the sixth inning, Nolan Ryan came in to pitch in relief, though the outcome was virtually identical to the previous inning. Ron Santo led off with a walk. Two batters later with one out, Willie Davis, pinch hitting for the pitcher, Don Sutton, hit a two-run home run to extend the NL lead to 7–1, and closing out scoring for the game.\nGame notes and records.\nRick Wise was credited with the win. Bert Blyleven was credited with the loss. Jim Brewer was credited with the save.\nThis was the 24th and final All-Star Game appearance for Willie Mays. Mays appeared in every game from 1954 to 1973. Only Hank Aaron and Stan Musial have played in as many All-Star Games as Mays.\nJim Spencer became the first member of the Texas Rangers to appear in an All-Star Game. The Rangers were playing their second season in Arlington, Texas after moving from Washington, D.C., where they were the second incarnation of the Washington Senators from 1961 to 1971. Toby Harrah, Texas' lone representative in the 1972 game, was injured.\nCatfish Hunter was removed from the game in the second inning after Billy Williams hit a line drive that hit Hunter's right hand, breaking his thumb. He missed two weeks of the regular season.\nThis All-Star Game saw 54 players (28 for the NL and 26 for the AL) enter the game. This became a new All-Star Game record for participating players.\nBuddy Bell became the second son of a former All-Star (Gus Bell) to appear in an All-Star Game.\nIn total, there were 19 future hall of famers involved with the game. The non-players involved in the 1973 All-Star Game that have been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame are Sparky Anderson, Dick Williams, Whitey Herzog, and Nestor Chylak.\nAs of 2020, Royals Stadium is the last facility to host the MLB All-Star Game in its first season of operation. Cincinnati's Riverfront Stadium hosted the 1970 game 12 days after it opened, and St. Louis' Busch Memorial Stadium opened two months prior to the 1966 game. Pittsburgh's Three Rivers Stadium, which opened two weeks after Riverfront, hosted the 1974 game. Royals Stadium was scheduled to open for the 1972 season, but labor strife and bad weather caused long delays, forcing the Royals to spend 1972 at Municipal Stadium."

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the St. Louis Cardinals, Milwaukee Brewers, and Philadelphia Phillies, and in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) for the Yokohama Taiyo Whales. He attended Southern Illinois University, where he played college baseball. He is the father of former MLB player Jim Adduci.\nCareer.\nOn June 7, 1977, Adduci, after graduating from Chicago's Brother Rice High school, was drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies in the 28th round of the amateur draft. However, Adduci chose to continue his education instead. On June 3, 1980, Adduci was drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals in the 7th round of the amateur draft.\nAdduci made his major league debut on September 12, 1983, with the Cardinals. Adduci was hitless in his only at bat in his debut. That year, Adduci had a batting average of .050 in 20 at bats. On October 2, 1984, he was traded with Paul Householder to the Milwaukee Brewers for three minor leaguers. Adduci made his Brewers debut in 1986, and had a batting average of .091 in 11 at-bats that season.\nOn April 19, 1987, Adduci was purchased by the San Francisco Giants from the Milwaukee Brewers, only to be sent back to Milwaukee a week later. On June 4, 1987, the Brewers released Adduci. Adduci finished 1987 playing for the Yokohama Taiyo Whales in Japan.\nAdduci re-signed with the Brewers on January 18, 1988. That season, he had a batting average of .266 in 94 at-bats. Since he had three sacrifice flies, his on-base percentage was lower than his batting average, which is a very rare occurrence in Major League Baseball.\nPrior to the 1989 season, Adduci was sent to the Philadelphia Phillies, hitting .368 in 19 at-bats. Adduci played his final major league game on July 26, 1989. After the 1989 season, he was granted free agency and never returned to the major leagues.\nAdduci had a career batting average of .236, in 144 at-bats over the course of 70 games. All 15 of his career runs batted in came in the 1988 season, as well as his only career home run.\nPost-playing career.\nAfter retirement following a 1990 season spent in the minor leagues, the Chicago native Adduci entered DePaul University, and in 1991 he earned a communications media degree. He ran summer baseball camps for the cities of Evergreen Park and Oak Lawn. As parents requested private instruction for their children, Adduci decided to open a storefront children's baseball school in Chicago, and ran it there through the summer of 1992. \nAs of 1993, Adduci was living in Evergreen Park, with his wife, two daughters and a son. He was running the baseball school in a more spacious location in Tinley Park. Fellow ex-professionals Steve Otto and Tim Pyznarski were on staff helping Adduci as instructors. \nAlthough feeling professional baseball was too much of a business and that he did not get a shot at a major-league career, Adduci said he loved baseball and building up kids' self-esteem by teaching them the sport. During his playing career, he befriended players like Paul Molitor and Andy Van Slyke, who named Adduci the godfather of his son.\nCurrently, Adduci works for the Chicago Bulls/Sox Training Academy as the director of the White Sox Elite baseball program and as a hitting instructor."

        "text": "The 1976 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 47th midseason exhibition between the all-stars of the American League (AL) and the National League (NL), the two leagues comprising Major League Baseball. The game was played on July 13, 1976, at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, home of the Philadelphia Phillies of the National League. The game resulted in a 7–1 victory for the NL.\nThis was the third time that the All-Star Game had been played in Philadelphia, though the first to be played in Veteran's Stadium. Both the 1943 and 1952 games were played in Philadelphia's Shibe Park with the then Philadelphia Athletics hosting in 1943 and the Phillies hosting in 1952. The All-Star Game would return to Veterans Stadium in 1996.\nThe honorary captains were Robin Roberts (for the NL) and Bob Lemon (for the AL).\nStarting with this All-Star Game, both \"O Canada\" and \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" would be sung as part of the annual pregame ceremonies.\nAmerican League roster.\nThe American League roster included 7 future Hall of Fame players, denoted in \"italics\".\nNational League roster.\nThe National League roster included 5 future Hall of Fame players, denoted in \"italics\".\nStarting lineups.\nWhile the starters were elected by the fans, the batting orders and starting pitchers were selected by the managers.\nScoring summary.\nFollowing the pattern of many of the previous All-Star Games, the NL scored first and early, putting up two runs in the bottom of the first inning. Pete Rose led off with a single, and scored when the next batter, Steve Garvey, tripled. After Joe Morgan flew out, George Foster grounded out, allowing Garvey to score from third base.\nThe National League added two more runs in the bottom of the third inning, with Catfish Hunter pitching in relief. With one out, Joe Morgan singled. George Foster then hit a home run, scoring Morgan to bring the NL lead to 4–0.\nThe lone AL run came in the top of the third inning, with Tom Seaver pitching for the NL in relief of Randy Jones. With two outs, Fred Lynn hit a home run to reduce the NL lead to 4–1.\nThe game's scoring was closed out in the bottom of the eighth, as the NL scored three runs off of AL relief pitcher Frank Tanana. Dave Cash led off with a single, and went to second base when Tony Pérez walked. Bill Russell grounded into a 5–4–3 double play, with Pérez out at second base, Russell out at first base, but Cash advancing to third base. Ken Griffey singled, scoring Cash. César Cedeño then hit a home run, scoring Griffey, and giving the NL a 7–1 lead that would hold up as the final score.\nGame notes and records.\nRandy Jones was credited with the win. Mark Fidrych was credited with the loss.\nMark Fidrych was only the second rookie to ever start as a pitcher in an All-Star Game (Dave Stenhouse had started the second All-Star Game of 1962).\nThe five Cincinnati Reds selected by the fans to start the game, and the two reserves selected by manager Sparky Anderson combined for seven hits, four runs scored, and four runs batted in.\nAs part of the United States Bicentennial observances, the city of Philadelphia – site of the Continental Congress and the signing of the Declaration of Independence – was selected to host the 1976 NBA All-Star Game, the 1976 National Hockey League All-Star Game, and the 1976 NCAA Final Four in addition to the 1976 Major League Baseball All-Star Game."

        "text": "Robert Park (May 12, 1880 – November 22, 1961) was an American college football coach. He was the tenth head football coach at Geneva College in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, serving for one season, in 1922, and compiling a record of 4–6. He also coached other sports for many years, but he was best known for his work as an academic and a minister of the Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America (RPCNA).\nCareer.\nBorn in Rome, New York on May 12, 1880, Park attended the city schools of Syracuse and graduated from Syracuse University, where he was the captain of the football team in 1905. After graduation, he studied at the Reformed Presbyterian Theological Seminary (RPTS) from 1907 to 1910. Licensed by the Rochester Presbytery on May 4, 1909, he was ordained to the ministry by the Pittsburgh Presbytery and installed as pastor of the denomination's Parnassus congregation on November 11, 1910. Park remained pastor of the congregation until August 28, 1922, when he resigned to serve at Geneva.\nWhile Park was the head of the history department at Geneva, he was also a longtime sports coach: he coached the football team in 1922, the cross country team from 1926 to 1928, and the track team from 1929 to 1949 . He was also the Dean of the College and the chairman of the Bible Department from 1949 until 1955. Park continued to serve his church, being chairman of various committees and sitting on the boards of both Geneva College and RPTS. In 1929, he was elected the church history professor at RPTS. Park continued his schooling after beginning his professorship, earning an M.A. from the University of Pittsburgh in 1924 and eventually earning a PhD. He was recognized for his accomplishments later in life, being elected the Moderator of the Synod of the RPCNA in 1951, and receiving a D.D. from Syracuse University in 1934.\nBeginning in 1929 and continuing until his death, Park spent his summers pastoring at the Reformed Presbyterian congregation in Cornwallis, Nova Scotia.\nFamily.\nPark was born into an Irish family: his father and mother were natives of County Tyrone and County Cavan respectively. Park married the former Emma Dodd on July 23, 1907 while teaching at the Arkansas Military Academy in Little Rock, between his college and seminary careers; with her, he had three sons: Robert, David, and James. After her death in Beaver Falls in 1939, he married the former Jennie Hayes on December 31 1940, by whom he had two more sons: John and Eric. They were married until his death in Beaver Falls on November 22, 1961. Park is buried in Syracuse."

        "title": "Jackpot Bowling",
        "text": "Jackpot Bowling (also known as Phillies Jackpot Bowling and Jackpot Bowling Starring Milton Berle) was a professional bowling show on NBC from January 9, 1959, to March 13, 1961.\nBroadcast history.\nShort-form version.\n\"Jackpot Bowling\" was the first national TV bowling show since \"Bowling Headliners\" aired in the early days of television (1948–50). \"Jackpot Bowling\" originally aired on Fridays at 10:45 PM following the \"Cavalcade of Sports Friday Night Fight\". It took place at the T-Bowl in Wayne, New Jersey. In its original format, \"Jackpot Bowling's\" time slot varied widely because it was led into by professional boxing bouts, which could end very quickly or stretch out to the full fifteen rounds at the time. \"Jackpot Bowling\" would thus pad out the time slot for however much extra time was needed to round out the hour. (\"Make That Spare\", a show produced by rival ABC with the sanctioning of the Professional Bowlers Association, followed a similar constraint when it debuted a year after \"Jackpot Bowling\" and would maintain that format throughout its four-year run.)\nLeo Durocher was the show's first host, but bowed out after only two shows and was replaced by Mel Allen. On April 10, 1959, Bud Palmer became the show's third host. Allen and Palmer each had obligations during their respective sport's seasons (Allen was a baseball man, Palmer was from the field of basketball), and thus they would trade positions each October and April throughout the show's first run. Of the three hosts, Allen, who knew little about bowling, was the most poorly received.\nThe show was put on a summer hiatus after the June 24, 1960, episode, as its \"Cavalcade of Sports\" lead-in had ended its run on NBC.\nLong-form version.\nOn September 19, 1960, \"Jackpot Bowling\" returned as a stand-alone show with its own 30-minute time slot, Mondays at 10:30 p.m. Brunswick became a co-sponsor with Bayuk's Phillies Cigars, and the series moved west to Hollywood, with the Hollywood Legion Lanes becoming the show's new studio. Milton Berle was installed as host with Chick Hearn providing play-by-play. (NBC installed Berle as host in part because the network was desperate to burn off its 30-year contract with Berle, whose popularity had been in steady decline, and also to emphasize more comedy as the nation's taste for high-budget contests had waned in the wake of the 1950s quiz show scandals.) The professional bowler challenges were supplemented with a late-night-style monologue from Berle and segments of celebrities being interviewed by Berle and then rolling a shot for charity.\nThe series would run only another six months with Berle as host and would end on March 13, 1961.\nGameplay.\nTwo players competed to bowl up to nine strikes. After each bowler took nine turns, the player who bowled the most strikes won $1,000. Any player who rolled six strikes in a row won a jackpot which, in the earlier seasons, started at $5,000 and increased $1,000 each week it was not won.\nIn the final season hosted by Milton Berle, two matches were played in each show. Rolling six strikes in a row in the first match won a flat $5,000. The winner of the first match played against the \"king of the hill\" bowler for another $1,000, and the right to return the following week as \"king of the hill\". Rolling six strikes in a row in this second weekly match won the jackpot, which now started at $25,000, with $5,000 added each week that it was not broken.\nEpisode status.\nThe show's status is unknown. Five Berle episodes exist, including the January 2, 1961, episode on which Detroit's Therm Gibson won a record $75,000 jackpot, the January 16 episode with British sex symbol Diana Dors bowling (and her husband Richard Dawson in the audience), and the January 23 episode where comic Harry Ritz bowled himself down the lane and got a strike."

        "title": "Brunswick Bowling &amp; Billiards",
        "text": "Brunswick Bowling &amp; Billiards was the business segment of Brunswick Corporation that historically encompassed the following three divisions:\nBilliards.\nThe billiards division was established in 1845 and was Brunswick Corporation's original business. Brunswick Billiards designs and/or markets billiards tables, table tennis tables, air powered table hockey games, and other gaming tables, as well as billiard balls, cues, game room furniture, and related accessories, under the Brunswick and Contender brands. Consumer billiards equipment is predominantly sold in the United States and distributed primarily through dealers.\nJohn Brunswick built his first billiards table in 1845 at his woodworking shop in Cincinnati, Ohio, for a successful Chicago meatpacker. The popularity of billiards grew quickly, and by the late 1860s, the U.S. billiards market was dominated by Brunswick's firm and two others. In 1873 Brunswick merged with one of his competitors, Julius Balke's Cincinnati-based Great Western Billiard Manufactory, to form J.M. Brunswick &amp; Balke Company. In 1884, the company merged with the other competitor, New York-based Phelan &amp; Collender, to form the Brunswick-Balke-Collender Company. (The company name was changed to Brunswick Corporation in 1960.) The company grew quickly and added new product lines to its business in the 1880s. Brunswick began selling functional and decorative wooden backs for bars. Prohibition prompted a drastic change in the products offered by the company. And while the Depression was a difficult period for Brunswick, World War II brought a great deal of new business. The company's billiard products were popular in the United Service Organizations (USO) centers.\nMore than 13,000 billiards tables were installed at military bases by 1945. In 1972 Brunswick Billiards began the design and manufacture air hockey tables. In 2008 the company introduced a line of game room furniture.\nBrunswick Billiards dabbled in retail at two times in its history. In 1947 the company opened \"Cue and Cushion\" establishments, family-friendly billiards establishments that include a lounge and soda fountain. In 2003 the company opened its first “Home &amp; Billiards Store” in the Chicago area, and went on to open one other store in Boston and two in Denver. All of these establishments were later closed, and the company returned to selling its products exclusively through dealers.\nBrunswick announced in July 2014 its intention to leave the bowling business by the end of 2014, retaining its heritage billiards business as part of the fitness segment.\nIn 2018, the company announced it would be spinning-off its fitness equipment business, including its Brunswick Billiards division, as Life Fitness Holdings in 2019. In May 2019, Brunswick announced its intention to sell Life Fitness Holdings to KPS Capital Partners. The sale was completed in June 2019.\nIn 2022, Life Fitness agreed to sell its Brunswick Billiards business unit to Escalade Sports for $32 million.\nBowling.\nEquipment and products.\nBrunswick began production of wooden lanes, bowling balls, and bowling pins in the 1880s as taverns began to install bowling lanes. John Brunswick's son-in-law Moses Bensinger, who was then directing Brunswick's day-to-day operations, actively promoted bowling as a participatory sport and was instrumental in organizing the American Bowling Congress in 1895.\nIn 1906 Bensinger opened a large manufacturing plant in Muskegon, Michigan. The plant became the cornerstone of the firm's manufacturing, producing such products as the revolutionary $20 Mineralite (hard rubber) bowling ball, and grew to over one million square feet by the 1940s. During World War II, United Service Organizations (USO) centers and military bases eagerly purchased bowling equipment, leading to more than 3,000 bowling lanes being installed at military bases by 1945.\nAt the time, Brunswick manufactured “spotting tables” which were manually operated to place bowling pins in their proper places on a lane before a bowling ball was thrown at them. The company had toyed with the idea of an automatic pinsetter since 1911, when inventor Ernest Hedenskoog joined the company. Many of his patents provided the basis for the automatic pinsetter later introduced.\nIt was not until the American Machine and Foundry Company (AMF) introduced the first fully automatic pinsetter in 1952 that Brunswick scrambled to get its own machine to market. In 1954 Brunswick formed the Brunswick-Murray Pinsetter Corporation with Murray Corporation of America, a manufacturer of components for autos and aircraft. By the time Brunswick's “Model A” pinsetters were in full production in 1955, Brunswick had bought out Murray.\nBrunswick's policy of selling pinsetters on credit, suburban expansion, and an aggressive advertising campaign all combined to make bowling centers enormously popular in the late 1950s. By the mid-1960s, however, overexpansion led to a period of decline. Brunswick had begun assembling bowling equipment in Dublin in 1959, but it closed its Italian factory in 1966 and the Dublin facility in 1972. Then, in 1973, it entered into a manufacturing joint venture with Fuji Kikai-Hiroshima. In 2005 Brunswick moved its bowling ball production to Reynosa, Mexico, and in 2006 it closed the Muskegon plant.\nIn 1967 Brunswick introduced the automatic scorer. In 1984, Brunswick acquired the Schmid Company of Scherzenbach, Switzerland, and with it the rights to manufacture and sell its GS pinsetter. The GS is Brunswick's current pinsetter series. The mechanical portion of the pinsetter was originally manufactured in the Brunswick plant located in Stockach, Germany. In 1999 the mechanical manufacturing was relocated to Hungary.\nBrunswick completed its exit from the bowling business in May 2015 with the sale of the bowling equipment and products division to BlueArc Capital Management, a private investment firm based in Atlanta, Georgia. BlueArc completed the acquisition with investments from Gladstone Investment Corporation, a publicly traded business development company in McLean, Virginia, and Capitala Finance Corp., a business development company in Charlotte, North Carolina. On November 15, 2019, Brunswick acquired Ebonite International and all of its bowling product brands.\nThe division's products for bowling centers include capital equipment, such as Sync, a scoring and management system, Spark, an immersive interactive bowling experience, automatic pinsetters, bowling pins, \"house\" bowling balls, ball returns, lane surfaces, and bowling center furniture, as well as aftermarket products such as pinsetter parts, lane conditioning machines, and conditioners and cleaners for lane machines. The company's current pinsetter model is in the GS Series, but many A Series models remain in active service. Similarly, many centers still use Brunswick AS-80, AS-90, 2000, Classic, Frameworx, Vector, and Vector Plus scoring systems. Brunswick lane surfaces include the Anvilane and Pro Lane brands.\nThe division's consumer products include its bowling balls, as well as, through licensing arrangements, bowling shoes, bags and accessories. Products are marketed under the Brunswick, DV8, Radical, Ebonite, Columbia 300, Hammer, and Track brands.\nProducts are manufactured or sourced mainly from facilities located in Michigan and Wisconsin in the United States, as well as in Hungary and Mexico. Bowling products are sold through a direct sales force or distributors in the United States and through distributors in non-U.S. markets.\nBowling centers.\nBefore its acquisition by Bowlmor AMF (now known as Bowlero Corporation) in October 2014, the Brunswick bowling center division was the second largest operator of bowling centers in the United States, with 88 centers in the US and Canada. Brunswick centers offered bowling and, depending on size and location, in-house restaurants, taverns, outdoor patios, billiards, video and redemption games, laser tag, pro shops, and meeting and party rooms.\nIn 1965, facing a decline in business after a period of rapid expansion, many privately owned centers found it difficult to pay the bills, and Brunswick took physical possession of 131 of these centers as payment for bowling equipment. In 1966, still suffering from the decline, Brunswick closed many European bowling centers.\nIn 2007 the company opened its first Brunswick Zone XL centers, large, smoke-free facilities aimed at families, bowling leagues, parties, corporate meetings and group events, offering bowling, laser tag, bumper cars, video game arcades, Brunswick billiards tables, large screen TVs, and spacious meeting rooms.\nDuring 2013 Brunswick Bowling divested its seven remaining European bowling centers.\nIn July 2014 as part of its exit from the bowling business, Brunswick announced that it had agreed to sell the bowling center business, which brought in $187 million in revenue in the prior year, to its much larger competitor Bowlmor AMF (now known as Bowlero Corporation) for $270 million. The sale of the bowling center division to Bowlmor AMF was completed in September 2014.\nBy January 2020, all remaining Brunswick Zone locations were rebranded with either the either Bowlero or AMF names."

        "text": "The 2008–09 international cricket season was between September 2008 and March 2009. The season saw the security concerns for cricket in Pakistan reach a pinnacle. The ICC Champions Trophy, scheduled to be held in Pakistan in September 2008, was postponed to 2009 after five of the participating nations refused to send their teams for the event. In November 2008, a Pakistani militant group launched terror attacks in Mumbai. This led to India cancelling their tour of Pakistan originally scheduled for January and February 2009. Sri Lanka agreed to tour Pakistan in place of India. However, the tour was jeopardised by a terror attack in Lahore where gunmen fired at a bus carrying the Sri Lankan team, injuring six team members. The Champions Trophy was later relocated to South Africa. No international cricket were played in Pakistan for more than five years. This period of isolation ended when Zimbabwe toured Pakistan in May 2015. After successfully hosting a few T20Is against World-XI, the Sri Lanka cricket team and the West Indians from 2017 to 2018, a few matches of the Pakistan Super League from 2017 to 2019, the whole season in 2020 as well as hosting complete tours against Sri Lankan and Bangladeshi cricket teams respectively during the 2019–20 season, built a good reputation of Pakistan.

        "text": "Charles Lawrence \"Chicka\" Cahill (28 January 1916 – 14 July 2007) was an Australian premiership-winning rugby league footballer. He played in the forwards for the Newtown club in the New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership from 1941 to 1947.\nPlaying career.\nBorn in Wickham, New South Wales, Cahill's first senior football was played in the Newcastle Rugby League with the Northern Suburbs club. He came to Sydney during WWII joining Newtown from the 1941 season. Cahill first enjoyed premiership success in the 1943 season with Newtown. His good form continued in the 1944 season, as he helped Newtown become minor premiers and runners-up.\nIn the 1945 season Cahill was the competition's top try-scorer. He also represented New South Wales in the 1940s and was probably denied international representative honours due to the war.\nCoaching and Administrative career.\nHe took up coaching with the Thirlmere club in the Wollongong competition from 1948 to 1950. He then coached Newtown from 1959 to 1961, later becoming an administrator at the club, holding the positions of selector, vice-president, secretary and president in the 1960s and 1970s. He was awarded life membership of the NSWRFL in 1966 for his contribution to rugby league.\nCahill was voted as President of Newtown Jets in 1978, getting in by one vote when club millionaire backer, John Singleton, stated he would pull his support for the club if Chicka Cahill lost the vote.\nCahill died on 14 July 2007 at Hillview House, an aged care facility at Ashmore, Queensland, age 91."

        "text": "The 2008–09 Euroleague was the 9th season of the professional basketball competition for elite clubs throughout Europe, organised by Euroleague Basketball Company, and it was the 52nd season of the premier competition for European men's clubs overall. The season, which featured 24 teams from 13 countries, culminated in the 2008–09 Euroleague Final Four at the new O2 World arena in Berlin, Germany. It was won by Panathinaikos, who defeated in the final, the defending champions, CSKA Moscow.\nWhile the general structure of the competition was identical to that used in recent seasons, changes were made to the format for two of its phases, the Regular Season and Quarterfinals.\nFormat.\nRegular Season\nThe first phase was a regular season, in which the competing teams were drawn into four groups, each containing six teams. Each team played every other team in its group at home and away, resulting in 10 games for each team in the first stage. The top 4 teams in each group advanced to the next round. This was the first year for this particular format; previously, the competing teams were split into three groups of eight teams each, with the top five teams in each group plus the best sixth-place team advancing.\nIf two or more clubs finished level on won-lost record, tiebreakers were applied in the following order:\nGames were played from October 22, 2008 to January 15, 2009.\nTop 16\nThe surviving teams were then divided into four groups of four teams each, and again a round-robin system was adopted resulting in 6 games each, with the top 2 teams advancing to the quarterfinals. Tiebreakers are identical to those used in the Regular Season. Games began on January 28 and ended March 12.\nQuarterfinals\nIn the quarterfinals, the top placed teams from each Top 16 group played second placed teams from a different group in a best-of-five playoff series, with the winners of those series advancing to the Final Four. This was the first season in which the quarterfinals were best-of-five; previously, they had been best-of-three. The quarterfinal matches were played from March 24 until April 9.\nFinal Four format\nThe culminating stage of the Euroleague in which the four remaining teams played a semifinal match and the winners of those advance to the final. The losers played in a third-place playoff. The team which was victorious in the Final (Panathinaikos) would be Euroleague champion. The Final Four semifinals were played May 1, with the third-place game and final on May 3.\nRegular season.\nThe regular season began on October 20, 2008 and concluded on January 15, 2009.\nTop 16.\nThe Top 16 stage was played from January 28 to March 12, 2009.\nThe draw was conducted on January 19 at Euroleague Basketball Company headquarters in Barcelona. The group winners in the Regular Season were drawn from one pot, the runners-up from one pot, the teams in 3rd place from one pot and those in 4th place from one pot. Teams that played in the same group in the Regular Season could not meet again in the Top 16. Also, teams from the same country could not be drawn into the same pool unless it was necessary to prevent teams from the same Regular Season group from being drawn together.\nQuarterfinals.\nTeam 1 hosted Games 1 and 2, plus Game 5 if necessary. Team 2 hosted Game 3, and Game 4 if necessary.\nFinal four.\nThe Final Four was played on May 1 and on May 3. Semifinal games were played on Friday, while the third-place playoff and Final were played on Sunday. The event was hosted at the O2 World in Berlin. It was the first time the event was held in Berlin."

        "text": "The 2008 NCAA Division I lacrosse tournament was the 38th annual tournament hosted by the National Collegiate Athletic Association to determine the team champion of men's college lacrosse among its Division I programs. The tournament was played from May 10–26, 2008.\nSyracuse beat Johns Hopkins in the championship game, 13–10.\nThe championship game was played at Gillette Stadium, the home of the NFL's New England Patriots, in Foxborough, Massachusetts, with a crowd of 48,970 fans. \nThe first round of the single-elimination tournament was played on May 10–11 at the home field of the top-seeded team. The quarterfinals were held on May 17–18 on two separate neutral fields: the Navy–Marine Corps Memorial Stadium in Annapolis, Maryland, and Schoellkopf Field in Ithaca, New York. The tournament culminated with the semifinals and finals held on Memorial Day weekend. The championship weekend, which included the Division II and Division III championships, was hosted by Harvard University and the Eastern College Athletic Conference. \nQualifying.\nThe Division I NCAA Men's Lacrosse Committee was responsible for selecting the teams that competed in the championship tournament. The qualifying teams, along with the seeding for each team in the tournament, were announced on Sunday, May 4, 2008. Seven conferences received automatic bids to the tournament for its top team. The remaining nine teams were selected as \"at large\" bids by the committee.\nFive conferences held a conference tournament championship to award the conferences' bid. Canisius earned an automatic bid by winning the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC) championship which marked the first time that Canisius College has gained entry to the National Championship tournament.\nColgate earned an automatic bid by winning its first-ever Patriot League championship.\nHofstra earned an automatic bid by winning Colonial Athletic Association (CAA) championship,\nNotre Dame earned an automatic bid by winning Great Western Lacrosse League (GWLL) championship, and UMBC earned an automatic bid by winning America East Conference championship.\nTwo conferences award their bids based on regular season conference records. Loyola earned an automatic bid by winning the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) championship with a 6–1 conference record.\nThe Ivy League's automatic bid was awarded to Cornell. Cornell and Brown had identical conference records, but due to a victory by Cornell in head-to-head competition earlier in the season the tiebreaker was given to Cornell.\nThe Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) conference tournament champion was Duke. However, the ACC does not receive an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament because a conference must have at least six members competing (for 2 years) in order to be awarded an automatic bid.\nThe following teams were awarded at-large bids by the NCAA Selection Committee: Duke (ACC), Virginia (ACC), Syracuse (Independent), North Carolina (ACC), Johns Hopkins (Independent), Maryland (ACC), Denver (GWLL), Navy (Patriot), and Ohio State (GWLL).\nGame summaries.\nFirst round.\nThe first round of the 2008 championship tournament saw upsets, an overtime game, and the NCAA career points record broken.\nUnseeded Ohio State bested #8 Cornell 15–7. The opening goal of this game was scored by Ohio State goaltender Stefan Schroder, who ran the length of the field to put one past the Big Red netminder.\nNavy upset #4 seeded North Carolina in Chapel Hill with a final score of 8–7 on the strong play of the Midshipmen defense and the four goal effort of Tim Paul, who was honored with Nike Player of the Week honors.\nNotre Dame, who was hosting its first NCAA Tournament game, topped Colgate in a contest that was settled in overtime. In a victory over Loyola, Duke's Matt Danowski broke the NCAA career points record, eclipsing Joe Vasta's mark. Syracuse ended Canisius's first ever appearance in the tournament early with a 20–3 victory. Johns Hopkins was led by Paul Rabil's four goals in a 10–4 win over Hofstra. Virginia's Garrett Billings third goal of the game with 6:50 left in the game sealed the Cavaliers win over UMBC. Maryland beat GWLL's Denver 10–7.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe quarterfinals were held at two separate locations the weekend of May 17 and May 18. On Saturday, 17,017 people attended the quarterfinals at Navy–Marine Corps Memorial Stadium. This set an attendance record for the most people to attend the quarterfinal round of the lacrosse championships. Fans in attendance saw Johns Hopkins defeat Navy 10–4. Navy was held without a goal for both the second and third quarters. The other game played in Annapolis was Maryland versus Virginia, which went into overtime. Ben Rubeor scored the game-winning goal in the extra period to send the Cavaliers to the semifinals.\nOn Sunday, at Cornell's Schoellkopf Field, Syracuse defeated Notre Dame 11–9 on the play of midfielder Dan Hardy who recorded four points, including three goals and the game winning score. Also, Duke routed Ohio State 21–10 on the offensive efforts of Zack Greer who recorded a career-high eleven points on six goals and five assists.\nFinal Four.\nOn Saturday, May 24, 48,224 fans were spectators for the 2008 Division I Final Four doubleheader held at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts. The first game featured Syracuse versus Virginia, and the second was a rematch of last year's championship game between Johns Hopkins and Duke.\nSyracuse vs. Virginia.\nIn the first game of the Final Four doubleheader, Syracuse defeated Virginia 12–11 in a double overtime thriller.\nVirginia commanded the first half of the contest due in part to extra-man opportunities resulting from penalties by Syracuse. In the second quarter, the Cavaliers went on a run of five unanswered goals and entered half-time with a 6–3 lead, and the game's momentum. The game remained in Virginia's favor through the third quarter, prior to the Orange fourth quarter comeback.\nSyracuse's Mike Leveille scored five goals, including a goal with 3:00 remaining in the game to send the game into overtime, and the eventual game-winner in the second overtime period to propel the Orange into the Championship game. Syracuse's come-from-behind victory included scoring six of the final eight goals of the contest.\nSyracuse's Junior midfielder Matt Abbott, known more for his groundball and clearing game, tallied three goals in the second half for his first career hat trick to spark to second half rally. Extra possessions earned by face-off specialist Danny Brennan, including both opportunities in the overtime periods and 70% total for the game, helped the Orange stage the comeback. While, Syracuse goalkeeper John Galloway settled down in the second half and made a number game saving stops as regulation time expired.\nVirginia scoring was led by Danny Glading with three goals and one assist, while Garret Billings scored two goals. Ben Rubeor, a Tewaaraton Trophy finalist, was held to one point on an assist.\nJohns Hopkins vs. Duke.\nJohns Hopkins defeated Duke 10–9 in the second game of the Final Four doubleheader. The heavily favored Duke team, who had beaten the Blue Jays earlier in the season 17–6, were handed only their second loss of the season.\nHopkins controlled the deliberate tempo of the game, and held a 4–2 lead going into halftime. After scoring first after halftime, Hopkins saw Duke pull even with three goals in 45 seconds during the third quarter, including back-to-back goals just 7 seconds apart.\nIn fourth quarter, the speed of the game accelerated as Duke began to push offensively. Johns Hopkins goaltender Michael Gvozden was up to the task. He recorded 7 of his 17 saves in the fourth quarter, including one as time expired to seal the victory.\nHopkins was led by Senior Kevin Huntley who netted four goals in the contest.\nChampionship: Syracuse vs. Johns Hopkins.\nOn Memorial Day, Monday May 26, Syracuse defeated Johns Hopkins in the national championship game 13–10 in front of 48,970 fans at Gillette Stadium. This game set the attendance record for the NCAA lacrosse championship game and for any NCAA outdoor championship. This marks the 10th victory in a national championship game for the Syracuse program. This is John Desko's, Syracuse's Head coach, fourth championship in his ten-year career at Syracuse.\nThe Orange were led by midfielder Dan Hardy with a team-high three goals, fifth-year Senior face-off specialist Danny Brennan who scored his first career goal, and attackman Mike Leveille, the tournament's Most Outstanding Player honoree and 2008 Tewaaraton Trophy winner, who recorded three points on one goal and two assists.\nSyracuse goalkeeper John Galloway became the first freshman goaltender in NCAA history to record 16 wins in one season, and just the fourth to win an NCAA title.\nJohns Hopkins' Paul Rabil played an outstanding game leading his team with career-high six goals and one assist in the losing effort. In addition, Blue Jay netminder Michael Gvozden made 20 saves, the most saves in a Championship game since Maryland's Brian Dougherty in 1995."

Jack Nicklaus shot a final round 65 and established a new U.S. Open record of 275, four strokes ahead of runner-up Arnold Palmer, the 1960 champion. It was the second of Nicklaus' four U.S. Open titles and the seventh of his eighteen major championships.\nNicklaus' record score surpassed the 276 of Ben Hogan in 1948 at Riviera. His final round 65 (−5) tied the U.S. Open record for lowest final 18 holes, broken six years later by Johnny Miller at Oakmont. The 275 record stood for thirteen years, when Nicklaus broke it on the same course in 1980. For Palmer, it was his fourth runner-up finish at the U.S. Open in six years; the earlier three were in playoffs (1962, 1963, 1966). Hogan, age 54, played in his final major; he shot 72 in each of the first two rounds and tied for 34th place.\nAfter winning the Masters in 1965 and 1966, Nicklaus missed the cut there two months earlier, which also kept him off the first Ryder Cup team for which he was eligible. (Other than a withdrawal in 1983, it was his only missed cut at Augusta from 1960–1993).\nLee Trevino, then a club pro from El Paso, finished fifth at Baltusrol in only his second major championship; he made the cut in his debut in 1966 at Olympic in San Francisco. The fifth place earnings of $6,000 allowed him to play in enough tournaments the rest of the 1967 season to earn his tour card for 1968. The high finish gave Trevino an exemption into the U.S. Open in 1968 at Oak Hill, which he won.\nThis was the fifth U.S. Open at Baltusrol and the second on the Lower Course; it previously hosted in 1954. The Upper Course was the site in 1936 and the defunct Old Course in 1903 and 1915. The U.S. Open returned in 1980, also won by Nicklaus, and its most recent appearance was in 1993.

Nicklaus birdied five of his first eight holes to open up a four-stroke advantage over Palmer, and that is how they finished. At the par-5 18th, Nicklaus played safe with a 1-iron off the tee, but it went right and required a recovery shot from the rough.

Billy Casper, the 1959 champion, staged one of the greatest comebacks in history by erasing a seven-stroke deficit on the final nine holes to tie Arnold Palmer; he then prevailed in an 18-hole playoff to win the second of his three major titles. It was the fourth playoff in five years at the U.S. Open, and the third for Palmer, the 1960 champion.\nOf the fifteen sub-par rounds posted in this U.S. Open, four belonged to Casper. He one-putted 33 greens and did not three-putt a green until the 81st hole. The \"continuous putting\" rule was in effect for this Open. Once putting on a green, the players had to keep putting until holing out. There was no marking of balls on the green except for lifting to clean. The rule was put into effect to speed up play at the Open.\nThree future champions made their major championship debuts and all made the cut: Lee Trevino and collegians Hale Irwin and Johnny Miller. Irwin was entering his senior year at Colorado, where he was also an all-conference defensive back for the Buffaloes in football. Miller was a San Francisco native and junior merit member of the Olympic Club entering his sophomore year at BYU; he finished tied for eighth and was the low amateur by three strokes.\nIt was the penultimate appearance at the U.S. Open for four-time champion Ben Hogan; he finished twelfth at age 53. Cary Middlecoff, champion in 1949 and 1956, made his final appearance this year but withdrew after the first round. Sam Snead, 54, failed to qualify for the U.S. Open for the first time in thirty years; he had played in every edition since 1937, but never won.\nThe winner's share was $25,000 and both playoff participants received a $1,500 bonus. Daily admission was five dollars for the first two rounds, seven dollars on the weekend, and five for the playoff.\nThis was the second U.S. Open at the Lake Course of the Olympic Club, the first was in 1955 and also ended in a playoff.

Palmer shot 32 (−3) on the front nine and with Casper's 36, the lead was seven strokes at the turn. With his eye on Hogan's U.S. Open scoring record (276 in 1948), Palmer needed to shoot just 36 (+1) on the back nine for 275. But after the turn, his game quickly unravelled; he bogeyed 10, rebounded with a birdie at 12, but bogeyed 13. At the par-3 15th, Casper made birdie and Palmer missed a par putt, dropping the lead to just three. After another birdie-bogey swing at the par-5 16th, Palmer's lead completely disappeared with another bogey at 17. Palmer needed a difficult up-and-down from the rough for par on 18 just to force a playoff.\nPalmer shot 39 (+4) on the inward nine, Casper 32 (−3), and the two tied at 278 (−2), seven strokes ahead of solo third-place finisher Jack Nicklaus, the 1962 champion. The Bay Area's affable Tony Lema tied for fourth. He and his wife were killed in a plane crash a month later.

Palmer took a two-stroke lead to the back nine, only to fall apart once again. The pair halved 10 and 11, but Casper birdied 12 and Palmer bogeyed to even up the playoff with six holes remaining. Palmer bogeyed 14 and 15, then double-bogeyed the par-5 16th. Casper finished with a one-under 69, four strokes ahead of Palmer, who shot a 40 (+5) on the back nine.

Player was the first foreign-born winner of the U.S. Open since 1927, and the win completed his career Grand Slam at age 29. It was the fourth of his nine major titles. The 1965 U.S. Open was the first U.S. Open broadcast on color television.\nThe five-year-old course at Bellerive was the U.S. Open's longest to date at , and had the potential to reach . The quality of the young course's turf varied, with burned out or diseased areas which the USGA did not allow relief from. The field consisted of 136 professionals and 14 amateurs, with the top fifty and ties advancing after 36 holes. This was the first time that the U.S. Open was scheduled for four days, with the final round on Sunday. Previously the third and fourth rounds were both played on Saturday. The U.S. Women's Open also changed to this format, held two weeks later in early July.\nFinal round and playoff.\nIn the final round on Sunday, Player owned a three-stroke lead over Nagle with just three holes to play. But while Player double-bogeyed the par-3 16th hole, Nagle birdied the 17th. As Player reached the 18th tee, he knew he needed a birdie to win outright, as Nagle had parred the final hole for 282 (+2). Player had a putt for birdie, but left it short and tapped in for a 72-hole tie. In the 18-hole playoff on Monday afternoon, Player built a five-shot lead after eight holes and held on to win by three strokes, 71 to 74.

Ken Venturi won his only major title, four strokes ahead of runner-up Tommy Jacobs.\nJacobs held the 36-hole lead after shooting a 64 (−6) in the second round, tying the U.S. Open record at the time for a round, set by Lee Mackey in 1950. In the third round on Saturday morning, he carded an even-par 70 and retained the lead after 54 holes, two strokes ahead of Venturi, who made up four shots with a 66 (−4). Masters champion Arnold Palmer had led after the first round, but hopes of a grand slam faded with a 75 in the third.\nBefore the final round began on Saturday afternoon, Venturi was advised by doctors to withdraw from the tournament. He was suffering dehydration due to an oppressive heat wave and had to take treatments with tea and salt tablets in between rounds. To play the final round, doctors warned, was to risk heat stroke. Venturi, however, ignored the advice and played on, then shot a 70 to Jacobs' 76 to claim a four-stroke victory. Venturi's score of 206 over the final 54 holes set a new U.S. Open record, as did his score of 136 over the last 36. The win was his first on tour in four years.\nFuture champion Raymond Floyd made his U.S. Open debut this year at age 21 and finished in 14th place.

Julius Boros won his second U.S. Open title in an 18-hole Sunday playoff with Jacky Cupit and Arnold Palmer. The U.S. Open returned to The Country Club for the first time in fifty years to celebrate the golden anniversary of Francis Ouimet's playoff victory in 1913. Boros won eleven years earlier in 1952, and won a third major at age 48 at the PGA Championship in 1968.\nAt 43, Boros was the second-oldest winner in U.S. Open history, and only a month younger than Ted Ray when he won the 1920 Open. For Palmer, it was the second consecutive year he lost in a playoff at the Open.\nHigh winds made scoring conditions extremely difficult throughout the entire week, especially on Saturday during the final two rounds, when gusts approached . The winning score of 293 remains the highest in post-World War II U.S. Open history, while the 77.4 final-round scoring average set a record for the post-war era, later broken in 1972 at Pebble Beach. For the first time in U.S. Open history, no amateur made the cut.\nDefending champion and Masters winner Jack Nicklaus missed the cut by a stroke; his next missed cut at the U.S. Open came 22 years later in 1985.

Boros recorded two birdies on his final three holes to post a 72 and 293 total. Cupit still held the lead until a double-bogey on the 17th dropped him into a tie with Boros and Palmer. He then missed a putt for birdie at the last that would have won the championship. Playing several groups in front of the final group of Jacky Cupit and Dow Finsterwald, Paul Harney came to the 18th hole at 9-over and went over the back of the green in two.

        "text": "The 1962 U.S. Open was the 62nd U.S. Open, held June 14–17 at Oakmont Country Club in Oakmont, Pennsylvania, a suburb northeast of Pittsburgh. Jack Nicklaus defeated 1960 champion Arnold Palmer in an 18-hole Sunday playoff that marked the beginning of their legendary rivalry. For Nicklaus, it was his first professional win, the first of four U.S. Open titles and a record 18 major championships. Though just 22, it was Nicklaus' sixth U.S. Open and tenth major, having played in four Masters. He had won the U.S. Amateur twice (1959, 1961) and was the top amateur at the previous two Opens, placing second to Palmer in 1960 and fourth in 1961.\nNicklaus earned $15,000 for his first professional win, and Palmer $8,000 as runner-up. Each received a playoff bonus of $2,500 from the Sunday gate receipts.\nOnly two of the six former champions in the field made the 36-hole cut, Palmer and defending champion Gene Littler.\nCourse layout.\nLengths of the course for previous major championships:\nThe first hole was a par 5 for the previous majors at Oakmont, set at in 1953.\nRound summaries.\nFirst round.\n\"Thursday, June 14, 1962\"\nDefending champion Littler took the first round lead with a 69 (−2) before a record opening round gallery of 17,486, mostly following Palmer in the afternoon, paired with Nicklaus. The previous record was 13,916 in 1960 near Denver.\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, June 15, 1962\"\nPalmer carded a 68 in the morning and Bob Rosburg a 69 to co-lead after 36 holes at 139 (−3), with Nicklaus three strokes back in a tie for fourth. Palmer and Nicklaus were paired together in the first two rounds. The second round attendance record was broken with 19,971 in the gallery, surpassing the previous mark of 15,225 set in 1961 near Detroit.\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, June 16, 1962 - (morning)\"\nFinal round.\n\"Saturday, June 16, 1962 - (afternoon)\"\nAfter 54 holes at Oakmont, Palmer held a share of the lead with Bobby Nichols, with Phil Rodgers and Bob Rosburg a stroke back, and Nicklaus and Gary Player two back. Rosburg shot a 79 (+8) in the final round and quickly fell out of contention, while Nichols and Rodgers carded scores of 73 and 72, respectively, to share 3rd place. But the story of this day was the duel between Palmer and Nicklaus. Although he bogeyed the 9th, Palmer still led Nicklaus as they made the turn. That would change quickly as Nicklaus birdied 11 and Palmer bogeyed 13, evening up the score. Nicklaus missed a birdie attempt at the last to finish with a 69, while Palmer missed a birdie at 18 from that would have won the championship. This set up an 18-hole playoff between golf's most popular player and the game's rising star.\nScorecard.\n\"Final round\"\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\"\nPlayoff.\n\"Sunday, June 17, 1962\"\nThe 10,000 that showed up for the playoff on Sunday were decidedly pro-Palmer, constantly taunting the 22-year-old upstart from Ohio. (Palmer was from nearby Latrobe and had won two of the last three majors, with five overall.) Nicklaus, however, silenced the crowd by going up by four strokes after six holes. Palmer then launched one of his patented charges with birdies at 9, 11, and 12 to close within one, but a three-putt bogey at 13 proved to be costly for Palmer. Nicklaus held him off from there and prevailed by three strokes, carding a 71 to Palmer's 74. Nicklaus won the championship on the greens; he had just one three-putt the entire week, while Palmer had 10. Nicklaus became the youngest winner of the U.S. Open since Bobby Jones in 1923, and became the first since Jones to hold the Open and the U.S. Amateur championship at the same time; he had won the Amateur the previous year before turning pro in the winter. For Palmer, this began a frustrating stretch as a runner-up in four U.S. Opens in six years, with three in playoffs. His words after the tournament proved prophetic, saying of Nicklaus: \"Now that the big guy is out of the cage, everybody better run for cover.\"\nScorecard.\n\"Playoff\""

Gene Littler shot a final round 68 for 281 (+1) to win his sole major title, one stroke ahead of runners-up Bob Goalby and Doug Sanders, the 54-hole leader.\nAmateur Jack Nicklaus tied for fourth at age 21, the second of his three consecutive top-4 finishes at the U.S. Open. The runner-up the previous year, he turned professional in November and won the first of four U.S. Open titles the following year. Defending champion Arnold Palmer made the cut on the number at 149 (+9), then shot even-par twice and climbed into a tie for 14th place, eight strokes behind Littler. Four-time champion Ben Hogan also tied for 14th, the only time since 1940 that he was outside the top ten at this major. This course was the site of his third title a decade earlier in 1951, a rare successful defense. Hogan did not enter for five years and made his final U.S. Open appearances in 1966 and 1967.\nThe South Course previously hosted the U.S. Open in 1924, 1937, and 1951. It later hosted in 1985 and 1996, and the PGA Championship in 1972, 1979, and 2008.\nRound summaries.\nFirst round.\n\"Thursday, June 15, 1961\"\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, June 16, 1961\"\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, June 17, 1961   (morning)\"\nFinal round.\n\"Saturday, June 17, 1961   (afternoon)\"\nAt the start of the final round on Saturday afternoon, Littler was at 213 (+3), three strokes behind 54-hole leader Sanders. After a 34 on the front-nine, Littler tied the lead with a birdie at 11. With a birdie at 13 combined with a Sanders bogey at the same hole, Littler was two strokes ahead. Sanders rebounded with a birdie at 16 to move within one. As Littler and Sanders reached the 18th, Goalby had already posted a 282 total, two off the pace. Littler needed no worse than bogey to get in ahead of Goalby, and that is what he shot, recording his lone bogey of the round for a 68 and a 281 total. Sanders, meanwhile, narrowly missed a birdie putt at 17, then almost chipped in for birdie at the last that would have forced a Sunday playoff. Sanders' putter cost him the championship, as he three-putted five of the last 36 greens. (He later missed a short putt to win The Open Championship in 1970.) Littler was the only player to break par twice."

        "text": "The EDHEC Sailing Cup (« ESC ») (Course Croisière EDHEC or « CCE » in French) is the leading student sporting event in Europe and the world's biggest intercollegiate offshore regatta. It takes place every year in a French harbour of the Atlantic Ocean. First held in 1969, nowadays it gathers 3,200 participants coming from 23 countries and from more than 165 universities. In 2017, the association received the award of the best student organization in France by the ANEO challenge.\nToday the ESC is composed of three different trophies that include diverse sports: The Sea Trophy (a regatta), the Land Trophy (a multi-sport raid), and the Sand Trophy (a beach soccer, beach rugby, and beach volley competition).\nHistory.\nThree French students from the prestigious EDHEC Business School willing to broaden the sport of sailing, Jean-Luc Picot, Francis Prat, and Pierre Jouannet, decided in 1968 to organize a student regatta. It took place from May 1 to May 4, 1969, in Dunkirk. For its first edition, the then-called EDHEC Business School Cup, gathered 18 crews and was won by a Dutch team. Older than the Vendée Globe, the Volvo Ocean Race and another sailing event, the EDHEC Sailing Cup constitutes a precursor in the high-level competitions.\nSeven years after its creation the regatta reached 100 crews from 10 nationalities and took its actual name, the \"EDHEC Sailing Cup\". 329 boats attended the 18th edition, a record. For the 19th edition the Organizing Team decided to build a Village to welcome participants, partners and activities in one place. The same year the \"Chaîne Avitaillement\", an open-air free supermarket, was also created. For its 23rd edition, 20 international boats participated in the regatta including the first African boat, from Tunisia, and boats from the United States and from Brazil. In 1994 was created the Land Trophy. It was first created as a replacement of the Sea Trophy. Since it was a great success, it became a full trophy. In 1998 an Israeli-Palestinian team participated in the regatta – it was the ancestor of the \"Peace Boat.\" 6,000 participants attend to the EDHEC Sailing Cup in Brest. In 1999, the EDHEC Sailing Cup became the leading student sporting event in Europe.\nTo give a more sporting dimension to the event, the Sand Trophy was created in 2007. For the first time in 2010 was organized the Orange Port of Call, a coastal race that gathers the participants, at night, in an area away from the Village under a marquee build up for the occasion. In 2013, the EDHEC Sailing Cup and the Intercollegiate Offshore Regatta, organized by Storm Trysail Foundation and Larchmont Yacht Club, created a partnership. It enables the winners of each regatta to have their costs of participation for the other one covered.\nAmong the renowned sailors who have participated at least once in the event are Eric Tabarly, Alain Colas, Franck Cammas, Olivier de Kersauson, Vincent Riou, Jean Le Cam, Marc Thiercelin, Yves Parlier, Marc Pajot, Yann Eliès, Yvan Bourgnon, Jean-Luc Van Den Heede and Jimmy Pahun.\nThe Sea Trophy.\nThe Sea Trophy, created in 1969, is the historic heart of the EDHEC Sailing Cup and remains the biggest trophy of the EDHEC Sailing Cup. Each year, the competition gathers more than 230 boats. The French Federation of Sailing (FFVoile) and its National Race Committee supervise the race. It is open to all monohull boats with a length overall between 8 and 16 meters (approximately 25 to 50 feet) with a rating of 14 to 33.5 net handicap as well as Longtze boats. The three common boats used are Grand Surprise (around 40 boats), J/80 (around 40 boats) and Longtze (around 10 boats). The competition is divided in several rankings: An Overall Ranking, a 100% Student and the 100% International, and each competition is rewarded by different prizes. The results of the EDHEC Sailing Cup are used in order to choose which French team will be selected for the Student Yachting World Cup.\nThe other trophies.\nThe Land Trophy.\nThe Land Trophy was created in 1994. More than 150 teams of four or five are competing in several sports such as mountain bike, running, orienteering, canoeing, zip-line or abseiling. In 2017, an obstacle course was organized between participants of the Land Trophy and of The Sand Trophy: The Mud Contest.\nThe Sand Trophy.\nCreated in 2007, this trophy is divided in more than 80 teams of 5 to 9 individuals. There are competitions of beach soccer, beach rugby and beach volleyball during the day and concerts in the evening. The competitors spend all of their time on the Village with their teammates and other teams. They can rent a stand of 16m2 to represent their school and their sponsors and organize activities in it such as fast-food contest or a petanque tournament.\nIn 2017, the Sand Trophy evolved for its 10th edition. The day is divided into two parts. One part is for classical sporting challenges and the other for more various challenges with, for example, an escape game, an archer arena and a nautic trophy.\nThe Air Trophy.\nThe latest Trophy, which last took place in 2016, was a competition of kitesurfing and windsurfing. Initiated in Lorient in 2011 and officially launched in 2012 during the 44th edition, the trophy was the first kitesurfing competition in teams ever organized in France. The windsurfing competition was divided into two different elements: A race and a freestyle contest. The kitesurfing was divided into a race, a freestyle and a boarder cross contest.\nThe Organizing Team.\nThe EDHEC Sailing Cup is an event organized by students for students. Indeed, the entire event is organized by students, from the logistic to the communication of the event and its 3 trophies. Divided into four divisions - Logistic, Sports, External Relations and Communication - with a head office, the association works likes a real SME, with presidents that devote their whole gap year to this mission."

        "title": "Nettuno Baseball Club",
        "text": "Nettuno BC 1945 is an Italian baseball club located in Nettuno, a \"comune\" of the Metropolitan City of Rome. The club competes in the first division (Serie A) of the Italian Baseball League. Training and home matches are held at Stadio Steno Borghese, which has a capacity of 10,000. The club currently holds the Italian baseball record for most league titles (17).\nHistory.\nThe spread of baseball and the craze for it in Nettuno is attributable to the number of U.S. military bases present in the area after the end of World War II. U.S. soldiers stationed at the bases often played baseball and softball and involved many local Italians in their games. One of the Italian baseball pioneers, Alberto Fasano, was a Nettunese. Fasano and his friend Julius Zerella eventually founded Nettuno's first softball team – called \"Nettuno PS\". The team's first players were: John Petrelli, Luciano Serpe, Luciano Verlezza, Manrico David, Fulvio Verlezza, Tonino Marcucci and Sergio Serpe. Their official debut was in 1946 in the First Division Male Softball championship against Milan. The nettunesi won by a score of 32–7. \"Nettuno PS\" won its first title in 1949.\nIn 1950, \"Nettuno PS\" became \"Nettuno USMC\". In its first championship, the club finished second, with 12 wins out of 14. Over the next four years (1951, 1952, 1953, 1954), \"Nettuno USMC\" won 4 consecutive championships, making the Lazio region most titled of the Italian championship, with 17 league titles. The team won its first European Cup in 1965, and has since won the Cup five more times. The team won the CEBCup 3 times (1993, 1995 and 2000) and the Italian Cup in 1970, 1995 and 1998. In the 2007 and 2008 seasons, they advanced to the finals seven of the Italian Baseball League Series, but lost the title to the Grosseto BBC in 2007 and the San Marino BBC in 2008.\nThis club has most of the times made the playoffs. The club did not make it to the Playoffs only in 2003. During the 2009 season, the club was defeated on 11 April in a home match against Godo. The club bought Manuel Gasparri from Fortitudo Bologna, Manny Alexander from Rimini BC, and other important players from Central America, including Abraham Núñez. Within Europe, Nettuno won the 2009 European Cup in Barcelona, first defeating Haarlem Kinheim and then triumphing in an all-Italian final against Fortitudo Bologna with a result of 1–0, winning the European Champions Cup for the second time in a row."

        "title": "Parma Baseball Club",
        "text": "Parma Baseball Club is a professional baseball team that plays in the Serie A. Founded in 1949, the team is based in the city of Parma in Italy and plays its home games at the Stadio Nino Cavalli. It is currently the second-largest stadium in Italy after Nettuno's Steno Borghese, and along with Bologna's home park, often hosts Italian national team home games. \nThe club, managed by Gianguido Poma, finished the 2020 season with a 15-11 record, good for 3rd place in Italy, behind Bologna and San Marino. So far in 2021, Parma took home the European Champions Cup in July, their European record 14th title. Parma will play in a modified playoff later this month to determine if they will get the opportunity to defend their title and participate in the 2022 Champions Cup.\nOne of the most successful clubs in the Italian League, Parma has won 10 IBL championships, as well as 15 European Cup titles, the most in European baseball.\nHistory.\n2019.\nItalian national team players Sebastiano Poma (.380, 4 HR, 26 RBI), Aldo Koutsoyanopulos (.317, 1 HR, 11 RBI), Ricardo Paolini (.308, 1 HR, 17 RBI) led the offense. Veterans Charlie Mirabal (.297, 1 HR, 10 RBI) and Luca Scalera (.364, 1 HR, 8 RBI) also made their impact in the lineup. Erly Casanova led the pitching staff with 50.2 IP to go with a 3.02 ERA and 52 K. Marc-Andre Habeck (2.48 ERA, 38 K in 29.0 IP), Owen Ozanich (3.86 ERA, 18 K in 18.2 IP) and Yomel Rivera (4.50 ERA, 24 K in 18.0 IP) were also very steady. Veteran hurler Mauro Schiavoni proved to be an important addition, the right hander from Argentina posted a 0.00 ERA in the regular season, not allowing a single run in 11.1 IP. He also had an impressive 1.93 ERA in the Champions Cup. Parma finished 4th in the week long tournament where the top 8 club teams face off to crown the new European champion. In the event, Casanova and Habeck led the staff with 8.0 innings pitched, Habeck posted the best ERA (1.12), while Ozanich finished with a team high 9 strikeouts in 5.2 IP. Offensively, Koutsoyanopulos hit .421 (8-for-19), Paolini .353 (6-for-17), Mirabal .333 (5-for-15), Poma .313 (5-for-16) and Alex Sambucci .313 (5-for-16).\nParma found themselves in a rematch of the 2018 finals, this time in the semis, against rival Bologna. After shotting out to a 2-0 series lead, Parma lost three straight as Bologna came from behind, not only in the best of five series, but in game five as well. Erly Casanova was Parma's top playoff performer, logging 14.2 innings, allowing just two earned runs (1.23 ERA), walking one batter while striking out 15. Yomel Rivera (5.2 scoreless with 3 K), Junior Oberto (1 ER in 5 IP) and Marc-Andre Habeck (2 ER in 7.1 IP) also pitched well in the series. At the plate, in the playoffs, Ricky Paolini (.381), Rafael Vinales (.375), Stefano Desimoni (.333), and Mattia Mercuri (.300) were the club's .300 hitters. Longtime shortstop Charlie Mirabal injured his shoulder diving for a ball in the hole in Bologna, an injury that sidelined him for the first month of 2020 as well.\n2020.\nThe 2020 offseason saw many changes to the Parmaclima roster. Gone were pitchers Erly Casanova, Mauro Schiavoni, Marc-Andre Habeck and Junior Oberto. Infielder Mattia Mercuri and catcher Rafael Vinales also moved on from Parma. Alessandro Deotto returned to the club he called home in 2017 and 2018, Deotto started off hot, batting .344 with 3 home runs in 12 games before missing the second half of the 2020 season. Longtime infielder Luca Scalera opted to change clubs in 2020, moving to cross town Collecchio. Left-handed national team pitcher and current Cubs minor leaguer Luis Lugo along with righty Michele Pomponi were the club's two main starters. The 26-year-old Lugo posted a 6-0 record, 3.47 ERA in 59.2 innings for double-A Tennessee in 2019 and appeared in a 2020 MLB spring training game where he recorded a scoreless inning for Chicago. Lugo had previously pitched for Parma in 2018 before being signed as an international free agent, and returned following the cancellation of the 2020 minor league season. The big lefty posted a 3-3 record in 40.0 IP, striking out 69 while issuing only 10 walks to go with an impressive 1.40 ERA. Pomponi came back with Parma after having missed the entire 2019 season due to injury. The young righty logged 39.2 IP, striking out 48 to go with a 2.47 ERA. Italian national team hurlers Mattia Aldegheri (31.1 IP, 33 K, 4.02 ERA) and Yomel Rivera (18.0 IP, 30 K, 3.11 ERA) solidified the Parma bullpen. Philadelphia Phillies pitching prospect Samuel Aldegheri pitched well for Parma, posting a 2–0 record in 9.1 innings while striking out 13 to go with a 3.75 ERA. Veteran lefty Francesco Nardi (4-0 in 18.1 IP), two way player Francesco Pomponi (0 R in 3.2 IP, 3 K) Venezuelan righty Anthony Gonzalez (5.12 ERA in 13.2 IP) and French righty Owen Ozanich (2.0 IP, 0 R, 3 K) rounded out the bullpen.\nThe club's everyday lineup featured utility man Aldo Koutsoyanopulos (.230, 17 R, 12 SB), infielder Ricardo Paolini (.325, 1 HR, 5 SB), and centerfielder Sebastiano Poma (.380, 4 HR, 19 RBI) at the top of the order. First baseman Alex Sambucci (.265, 1 HR, 15 RBI), outfielders Leonardo Zileri (.311, 1 HR, 9 RBI), Stefano Desimoni (.333, 11 R, 9 RBI), and Alexander Viloria (.241, 1 HR, 14 RBI) batted in the heart of the order. Smooth fielding shortstop Charlie Mirabal (.286, 8 RBI, 4 SB) returned mid-way thru the season and added depth to Poma's lineup.\nThe 2020 season featured six teams, a 26 game regular season between July 8 and September 12. The top two regular season clubs, San Marino and Bologna advanced to the Italian Finals featured a best-of-seven series to be played between September 17–26. With a 15-11 record in 2020, Parma qualified for the 2021 European Champions Cup as the second Italian team alongside Fortitudo Bologna. \n2021.\nThe 2021 edition of Parma Clima will be remembered as the revamped 'squadra' which took home July 2021's European Champions Cup, hosted by Arrows Ostrava in the Czech Republic. First baseman Alex Sambucci took home tournament MVP honors, batting .333 with 3 homers and 7 driven in. First year third baseman and Spanish national team infielder Leo Rodriguez also blasted 3 homers in the week long event, while veteran outfielder Stefano Desimoni batted a team leading .421, also scoring 5 runs, leading Parma to a final victory over Bonn (Germany).\nPrior to the start of the 2021 season, The Italian Serie A increased the number of clubs in the league to 32. Sebastiano Poma replaced Leonardo Zileri as the club's captain. Poma, a fixture on the Italian national team, hit .304 with 1 HR and 9 RBI in 2021. Offensively, the club was led by Cuban outfielder Noel Gonzalez (.420, 1 HR, 22 RBI), Alex Sambucci (.361, 3 HR, 18 RBI) and Rodriguez (.347, 6 HR, 26 RBI). On the mound, Michele Pomponi went 3-0 with a 0.53 ERA in 17.0 IP before suffering a season ending arm injury. Jose Campos (2-0, 1.59 in 34.0 IP) and Mattia Aldegheri (7-3, 3.74 in 53.0 IP) led the rotation. Yomel Rivera (2-0, 6.35 in 22.2 IP) and Danny Rondon (2-2, 5.63 in 24.O IP) made important contributions as well."

        "text": "2008–09 Eurocup Basketball was the seventh edition of Europe's second-tier level transnational competition for men's professional basketball clubs, the EuroCup, and the first to be contested under the Eurocup name. From the inception of the competition in 2002, it had been known as the ULEB Cup. The EuroCup is the European-wide league level that is one tier below the EuroLeague level.\nDuring this season, there were 48 teams, from 22 countries. After the preliminary rounds, there were 32 teams left for the regular season, with the 16 eliminated teams being relegated down and parachuting into Europe's third-tier transnational competition, the EuroChallenge. Lithuanian club Lietuvos Rytas of Vilnius, won the tournament and promotion to the top level EuroLeague for the next season.\nFormat.\nThe competition format was also revamped. A total of 48 clubs participated, down from 54 in the previous year's competition. The competition was jointly organized by Euroleague Basketball Company and FIBA Europe.\nFirst preliminary round.\nSixteen teams competed in the first preliminary round, which was organised by FIBA Europe. These teams were paired in two-legged matches, with winners decided on aggregate score. The eight winners advanced to the second preliminary round, and the eight losers parachuted into the third-tier European competition, the EuroChallenge. The matches were played from October 14 through October 21.\nDue to a decision of the Italian Basketball Federation to revoke Capo d'Orlando's first division license, followed by an Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI) tribunal rejected appeal by the club, Capo d'Orlando lost the right to participate in European competitions. As a result, Benetton Treviso automatically qualified to the group stage, while Benetton Fribourg advanced to the second qualification round where they met Kalise Gran Canaria.\nSecond preliminary round.\nThe second preliminary round, also organised by FIBA Europe, also featured 16 teams, with the eight winners from the first preliminary round joined by eight automatic qualifiers to that phase. As in the first preliminary round, matches were two-legged and decided on aggregate score, with the winners advancing to the Eurocup regular season and the losers parachuting into the EuroChallenge. Matches were played from November 4 to November 11.\nRegular season.\nThirty-two teams—24 automatic qualifiers and the eight survivors of the second preliminary round—entered the Regular Season. From this point onward, the competition is organised by Euroleague Basketball Company. The teams were divided into eight groups of four teams each, with each group playing a double round-robin schedule. The first and second-place teams in each group advanced to the Last 16. Regular Season matches were held from November 25, 2008 until January 13, 2009.\nLast 16.\nFor the first time in the history of the competition, a second group phase was played. The survivors of the Regular Season were divided into four-team groups, each playing a double round-robin schedule. This phase has a direct analogue in the top-tier EuroLeague, which conducts an identical group phase, the Top 16, at the same stage of the competition. As in the EuroLeague Top 16, the first- and second-place teams in each group advance to the next phase. However, unlike the EuroLeague, which conducts a separate quarterfinal round before its Final Four, the Eurocup sent its surviving teams into a single knockout tournament, the Final Eight. Last 16 matches were played from January 27 to March 10, 2009.\nFinal eight.\nLike the Euroleague Final Four, this was a knockout tournament, conducted in one-off matches, held at a single site. The semifinal losers played a single match for third place, and the semifinal winners played a single match for the Eurocup title and an automatic place in the 2009-10 Euroleague. This phase was carried over from the prior ULEB Cup format. Matches were played from April 9 through April 12.\nThis was the last season for the Final Eight format. From 2009–10 onward, a quarterfinal round has been introduced, consisting of two-legged ties between a group winner and the runner-up from a separate group, with the winner of each tie determined on aggregate score. The quarterfinal winners will advance to the Eurocup Finals, with one-off semifinals followed by a one-off final.\nPreliminary rounds.\nSixteen teams participated in the first preliminary round, and after the first preliminary round matches, sixteen teams played in a second preliminary round, with the top eight teams from the first preliminary round. Teams that were eliminated from the first or second preliminary round games competed in the EuroChallenge 2008-09.\nTop 16.\nThe second grand stage begins from January 27, 2009.\nFinal eight.\nThe Final Eight was the last stage of EuroCup 2008-09.\nQuarter finals.\nApril 2, Pala Alpitour, Turin\nApril 3, Pala Alpitour, Turin\nSemi finals.\nApril 4, Pala Alpitour, Turin\nFinal.\nApril 13, Pala Alpitour, Turin"

        "title": "Long Beach State Dirtbags baseball",
        "text": "The Long Beach State Dirtbags baseball team is the college baseball program that represents California State University, Long Beach. Although all Long Beach State sports teams are officially known as the Beach, the baseball team is typically referred to as the \"Dirtbags\". Their colors are black and gold.\nLong Beach State (LBSU) has competed since 1969 in the NCAA Division I Big West Conference (BWC), known at the time as the Pacific Coast Athletic Association. Before becoming a founding member of the PCAA, LBSU participated in the Division II California Collegiate Athletic Association (CCAA) from 1957 to 1969, and before that spent three years as an independent team.\nThe Long Beach State baseball team gained national prominence in 1989, with the hiring of Dave Snow as head coach. The Dirtbags established themselves as one of the strongest teams on the West Coast. From 2010 to present day, more active Major League professional ballplayers are alumni of Long Beach State than any other school.\nSince 1993 the Dirtbags have played their home games exclusively at Blair Field, a semi-professional baseball facility located less than from campus and owned by the city of Long Beach.\nHistory.\nThe McConnell era (1954–1959).\nIn 1954, then 5-year old Long Beach State College asked newly hired P.E. professor John McConnell (a former cross country runner also serving as the school's associate basketball coach) to be the first head coach of the new baseball team. Helming a program with only 14 players on the roster, no athletic scholarships, and a shoestring budget, the team was forced to hold practices on the public field at Whaley Park adjacent to campus. All of the team's first 11 games were played on the road; only towards the very end of the season, when the school's field was finally completed, could the 49ers host their first home game. The young 49ers posted a modest 3–13 record for the 1954 season.\nFrom 1955 to 1956, still hampered by a limited roster and forced to employ a 3-man pitching rotation, the 49ers posted significantly improved records of 17–4 and 18–6, respectively. They were paced by utility man Carl Evans, who would later become Long Beach State's first All-Conference player (after the school's admission to the CCAA).\nIn 1957 Long Beach State was admitted into the NCAA's College Division (now Division II) after three years of competition as an independent. McConnell remained as head of the baseball program for three more years, accumulating a 48–42 cumulative record in NCAA play and finishing between 3rd and 5th in the conference each year. After the 1959 season McConnell stepped down as coach of the Long Beach State baseball team, however he stayed on as a staff member in the P.E. department for nearly 30 more years. When asked later which accomplishment he was most proud of during his time with the baseball program, he responded it was that 50 of the 57 baseball players he coached graduated.\nThe Clegg era (1960–1963).\nDick Clegg took over the program after McConnell's departure, and almost immediately he appeared capable of taking the 49ers to heights that his predecessor had been unable to. Led by the team's first future Major Leaguer in pitcher Dick Nen, the 1960 team finished the season with a promising 20–14 overall record and a 9–6 mark in CCAA play for a third-place finish in the conference, and there seemed to be reason to hope that the future held even brighter things for the 49ers baseball program. But unfortunately Clegg was unable to reproduce the success of his first season with the club, and under his guidance the 49ers failed to garner another winning season. Clegg's teams accumulated a disappointing 32–65–1 record over the next three years, including an abysmal 6–25–1 record in 1963. This lack of production led to Clegg's resignation following the 1963 season.\nThe Wuesthoff era (1964–1969).\nTrue success came when the program handed the reins to former freshman junior varsity coach, and assistant basketball coach Bob Wuesthoff in 1964. In Wuesthoff's first year as head coach, the 49ers rebounded impressively from the previous year's meltdown by going 31–13, earning the program's first conference championship and first entry into the NCAA National Tournament and setting a school record for wins that would stand until 1979 (The .704 winning percentage wouldn't be topped until 1989). This time, the first-year optimism did not give way to letdown.\nUnder Wuesthoff, the 49ers finished with a winning record in each of his six years as skipper at Long Beach State, accumulated a 161–101–4 (.613) overall record, and only once finished worse than third in the conference. By the time the 49ers won their second CCAA title in 1969, Wuesthoff was already the most successful coach in Long Beach State's short sports history. But changes came to the school in 1970, when Long Beach State was admitted to the NCAA's Division I. One of those changes came when Wuesthoff announced that he would not return for the 1970 season.\nThe Gonsalves era (1970–1988).\nThe 1970 season not only marked LBSU's first foray into Division 1, it also marked the first hiring of a team alumni as head coach. Incoming skipper John Gonsalves had played second base for the team from 1964 to 1965, and even earned NCAA all-district honors his senior year. After a mildly distinguished 3-year career in the New York Mets minor league system (netting one selection to the class A New York – Penn League all-star team), Gonsalves returned to his alma mater to take over the reins from his former coach Bob Wuesthoff who was retiring.\nAt the beginning of LBSU's time in Division 1, and for much of Gonsalves's time as head coach, the baseball program was afforded only 2 scholarships per year, significantly less than the NCAA maximum of 13. In addition, chronic underfunding of the program forced Gonsalves to split time between his coaching responsibilities and fund raising in order to meet his team's basic operating requirements. However, in his first year, despite the team's relatively uninspiring 29–23 overall record, Gonsalves led the team to an 11–4 record in conference play. This was enough to capture the first ever conference title of the newly formed Pacific Coast Athletic Association (PCAA), which sent the 49ers to the NCAA tournament. At season end, Gonsalves received the inaugural PCAA Coach of the Year award. Gonsalves would remain at the helm of the program for the next 19 seasons, and through two conference changes. The first came in 1977, when Long Beach State joined the upstart Southern California Baseball Association (SCBA), an NCAA Division 1 baseball-only conference consisting of baseball teams from schools that otherwise competed in either the PCAA or the WCC.\nThe 49ers posted their best year to date in 1979, when the 49ers compiled a 40–22–3 mark that set a new school record for wins and was good enough for a second-place finish in the competitive SCBA (behind Cal State Fullerton, who would go on to win their first national championship that year). They were paced by the team's first ever All-American selection, center fielder Rob Townley. Unfortunately, Gonsalves would never again coach a team to that level of success. Over the next 5 seasons, the 49ers only once posted a winning record or finished better than 4th in the conference. Even the demise of the SCBA and the renewal of PCAA competition (now known as the Big West) in 1985 couldn't change the fortunes of the hard luck 49ers, as they placed seventh in the conference in '85 and eighth in each of the next three years. Over his final 9 seasons, Gonsalves managed only a 205–342–10 cumulative record. After the 1988 season Gonsalves stepped down as head coach, citing physical exhaustion and a desire to spend more time with his family. Gonsalves remained on staff as a professor in the kinesiology department until 2002, and had his jersey number retired in 2001.\nThe Snow era (1989–2001).\nDave Snow was hired as head coach in 1989 after a successful four-year run at Loyola Marymount, where he had led the Lions to two WCC titles and their first ever CWS appearance. By contrast, Long Beach was coming off the worst stretch in program history, going a combined 66–163 over four seasons. Additionally, the team was being forced to play without the benefit a true home field, splitting games between Long Beach City College, Cerritos College, and Blair Field. (Ironically, the lack of a field ended up being a crucial ingredient in the creation of the team's iconic nickname – see below).\nSnow set out with the aim of raising the program back to a competitive level. Unexpectedly, that year Snow wound up engineering the greatest single-season turnaround in NCAA history. Long Beach State exploded onto the college baseball scene by winning their first 18 games to start the 1989 season. Just one season removed from a 14–45 record, the reborn 49ers performed a complete turnaround by going 50–15 overall and winning their first conference title in two decades. In the NCAA tournament, the \"Dirtbags\" went undefeated in their Regional and reached the College World Series, a school first. Though they failed to win a game in the Series, the Dirtbags' improbable run earned Snow NCAA Coach of the Year honors (three years after having won the same award at LMU, making him the first repeat winner of the prestigious award).\nThe team suffered a regression in 1990, slipping to 4th in the conference and missing the postseason. But the following year Snow led the '91 team to a 46–19 record – good for a 2nd-place finish in the conference and an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament. The team again won their regional and advanced to their second College World Series, this time reaching the second round before being eliminated.\nFrom 1992–'94 the Dirtbags won three consecutive Big West titles and reaching the College World Series yet again in '93, for their third CWS berth in five years. 1993 was arguably the Dirtbags' finest season, as the Dirtbags advanced farther in a postseason than ever before or since: 3 outs from a berth in the National Championship Game. After capturing the Big West Title and earning a top 10 ranking in all the major polls, the Dirtbags swept through their regional with four straight wins. In the College World Series, the Dirtbags eliminated Kansas and Texas A&amp;M en route to a semifinal matchup with the LSU Tigers. LBSU and LSU each held one victory going into the rubber match of the series, and the Dirtbags played their way to a 5–3 lead going into the bottom of the ninth inning. But the Tigers used their final at-bats to mount a 3-run rally, eliminating the Dirtbags in dramatic fashion. The Tigers went on to dominate the National Championship Game, beating Wichita State 8–0 for their second national title.\nLong Beach State reached the College World Series again in 1998, led by an offense that has been recognized as \"the best offensive power in program history.\" Lefty Mike Gallo turned in a particularly memorable postseason performance, shutting out Big West tournament host Cal State Fullerton in a dominant complete game outing. The following week he again went the distance to stun regional host Stanford 5–1 in Palo Alto. After eliminating Alabama the next day to reach their fourth College World Series, the Dirtbags fought past Florida State and Miami to again reach the national semifinal round. There they were eliminated by Arizona State 14–4, again falling just short of the national title game.\nAn unexpected side effect of The Dirtbags' newfound success was the triggering of a regional rivalry between LBSU and established baseball powerhouse Cal State Fullerton, where Snow had previously spent 7 years as an assistant under Augie Garrido and had declined an offer to return as head coach in 1987 (during Snow's time at LMU). The two Cal States proceeded to dominate Southern California baseball: during Snow's 13-year tenure, the Dirtbags and the Titans won 12 of 13 Big West Championships (1 shared) and combined for 22 NCAA tournament appearances and 10 College World Series berths. (By way of comparison, traditional SoCal athletic powerhouses USC and UCLA combined for only 19 Tournament appearances and 6 CWS berths over the same period.) The Long Beach-Fullerton rivalry remains heated to this day.\nSnow retired following the 2001 season for family reasons. In 13 years at LBSU, Snow compiled a record of 511–290–4 (.638 winning percentage), 6 Big West championships, 11 NCAA tournament appearances, and 4 College World Series berths, including 3rd-place finishes in 1993 and 1998 - he still holds the LBSU career coaching records in all the aforementioned categories. Snow also received more Big West Coach of the Year accolades (5) than any other coach in program history, and remains the only LBSU coach to be named NCAA Coach of the Year (1989).\nThe Weathers era (2002–2010).\nImmediately after Snow's departure, LBSU athletic director Bill Shumard confirmed that Snow's longtime assistant Mike Weathers would take over as head coach. Weathers, who had known Snow since the pair's playing days at Cerritos College in the late 1960s, had previously served as head coach at Utah and Chapman College before spending the last 9 seasons working under Snow at LBSU. Having served as associate head coach the year before, the veteran Weathers sought to utilize his coaching experience to maintain the level of success that Snow had established before him.\nIn Weathers's first year after taking the reins from Snow, the Dirtbags didn't skip a beat as they cruised to a 39–21 overall record and an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament. This turned out to be the first of a seven-year run for the team, where from 2002 to 2008 the Dirtbags never finished worse than second in the conference and only once ended with fewer than 37 wins. Six of those 7 seasons also saw the Dirtbags earn a berth in the NCAA tournament.\nA notable hallmark Weathers' tenure was the amount of Major League talent produced at Long Beach State. Because of the limited budget afforded to the state-funded school, the Dirtbags staff was often forced to focus on recruiting and developing prospects that were overlooked by other schools. One such case was Jered Weaver, who was dismissed by many scouts on the belief that he was more cut out for basketball than baseball. But Weaver's junior season in 2004 became the most decorated for a player in school history, netting him his second consecutive first team All-America selection while also winning (among other honors) the Dick Howser Trophy, the Roger Clemens Award, and the Golden Spikes Award.\nAnother example of prospect development was Evan Longoria, who (being widely regarded as too scrawny to compete for a Division 1 program) received no scholarship offers at all out of high school. Undeterred, Longoria enrolled at Rio Hondo Community College and played for one season, after which he was finally offered a scholarship at Long Beach State. Longoria would spend the next two seasons as the starting third baseman for the Dirtbags, and by the end of his junior year at LBSU, diligent hard work and expert instruction had transformed him into an imposing physical specimen who was described by various media outlets as the \"top position player\" and \"best pure hitter\" available in the 2006 draft. That year Longoria became the highest-drafted player in school history (3rd overall), which also marked the third straight year that Long Beach State had a player selected in the first round of the draft (Weaver went 12th in 2004, and Troy Tulowitzki 7th in 2005).\nPerhaps predictably, the rivalry between the Dirtbags and the Cal State Fullerton Titans continued as heated as ever under Weathers; the annual season-ending series between the two teams more often than not decided the conference championship. From 2002 to 2008, the two rivals combined to win 6 more Big West titles (1 shared). In the 20 seasons from 1989 to 2008, 17 ended with either the Dirtbags or the Titans being crowned Big West champions.\nImmediately after capturing the 2008 Big West title, the Dirtbags saw the conference power balance tip decidedly against them. It started in the off-season, when LBSU lost 11 players to the 2008 draft, making it the largest draft class in school history and one that featured several star contributors, including All-Americans Shane Peterson and Andrew Liebel. Ultimately the Dirtbags proved unable to compensate for such a mass exodus of talent, and they fell into a major slump as they skidded to a 25–29 overall record in 2009, their first losing record in over two decades. The team's funk deepened in 2010 as they finished 23–32, dead last in the Big West for the first time in 22 years. Also of note, the Dirtbags lost each of their 7 meetings with the arch-rival Titans over that two-year span.\nOn May 11, 2010 (two weeks before the close of the season), Weathers announced that he would be retiring at season's end. \"There needed to be a change and new energy in the program, because it hasn't been going great the last couple years,\" Weathers said. \"I've been doing this for 32 years, and so it's time. It can give somebody else a chance, and there's no hard feelings.\" Weathers was remembered by CSULB President F. King Alexander as \"an outstanding leader of the program and a great representative of the university.\" Weathers left LBSU with the second-most conference championships and postseason appearances to his name, as well as the second-highest winning percentage in school history (all behind his predecessor and mentor Dave Snow). Weathers also had coached the most Big West Players/Pitchers of the Year (6) and the most future MLB draft picks (56) of any coach in school history at the time of his retirement.\nFollowing Weathers's retirement announcement, the Dirtbags lost 9 of their last 10 games in 2010.\nThe Buckley era (2011–2019).\nOn June 1, 2010, two days after the close of the 2010 season, athletic director Vic Cegles held a press conference to formally introduce associate head coach Troy Buckley as LBSU's 7th head coach. A former professional player himself, Buckley first joined the Dirtbags' program as an assistant 2001, Dave Snow's final year as head coach. During his seven years as pitching coach he tutored seven future Major Leaguers including Abe Alvarez, Jason Vargas and 2004 National Player of the Year Jered Weaver. Buckley then spend two seasons serving as pitching coordinator for the Pittsburgh Pirates minor league system, before returning to LBSU in 2010 to take the position of associate head coach under Mike Weathers.\nFollowing Weathers's retirement and his own promotion, Buckley promised to carry on the Dirtbag tradition. \"We're still going to play a gritty type of baseball and hopefully show our fans that these guys don't quit. They fight and they grind and they get knocked down, but they keep coming back. We want to be fundamentally sound and not beat ourselves. We want to do things the right way.\" But while speaking highly of the program's legacy of fundamentally-sound baseball, Buckley also shared Weathers's growing concern that the team's recent history of producing highly regarded MLB talent had been causing the team to lose sight of that legacy. \"We just have to make sure these guys that are coming here are doing it for the right reasons. Not just to get to the big leagues or be a first-round draft choice.\"\nBuckley's first season as skipper was far from overwhelming, as the team finished with a paltry but promising 29–27 overall record. This marked the first time in 3 seasons that the Dirtbags finished over .500, and also saw the team climb from 9th place back into 4th in the Big West with a conference record of 12–12.\n2012 saw little change in the Dirtbags' overall record (28–27), but the team performed well in conference play, winning all but 2 of their head-to-head series. In fact, heading into the final weekend of the season, the Dirtbags found themselves only 1 game behind Fullerton, with the final 3-game series between the two rivals once again set to determine the Big West title. Fullerton ended up winning two of the three games, clinching the Titans' 3rd straight conference championship. (Cal Poly's 7-game winning streak to close the season allowed the Mustangs to finish 2nd in the Big West ahead of Long Beach.)\nAfter another middling season in 2013, the Dirtbags broke their 7-year postseason drought in 2014 by posting a 32–24 record and finishing 2nd in the Big West behind Cal Poly, good for an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament. Long Beach reached the final of the Gainesville regional before being eliminated by the underdog fourth seed Charleston.\nOn March 1, 2015, freshman starter Chris Matthewson and freshman reliever Darren McCaughan combined for the first no-hitter in program history against Wichita State. The Dirtbags finished the season at 28–26 and placed 6th in the Big West.\nIn 2016 the Dirtbags finished the regular season with a strong 36–20 record, barely missing the Big West championship after losing to Fullerton in the final game of the season. They were awarded an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament for the second time in three seasons, where they were eliminated in the regional final after losing two dramatic matches with #8 ranked regional host Miami.\n2017 turned out to be the team's finest season under Buckley. On the backs of a pitching squad that ranked 8th in the nation in ERA and an offense that ranked 184th in runs scored, the Dirtbags finished the regular season with a 37–17–1 record, including a dominant 20–4 campaign in the Big West that netted the program's first conference title since 2008 and earned Buckley the honor of being named Big West coach of the year. The Dirtbags also compiled a 5–1 regular season record against arch rival Fullerton, and were recognized with a top 10 ranking in all major polls. Long Beach went on to host their first NCAA regional since 2008, and after an early loss to Texas the Dirtbags won 3 consecutive games out of the loser's bracket and advance to the Super Regional. There they faced none other than the Fullerton Titans, marking the first time in history that the heated rivals had played each other with a trip to the College World Series on the line. The Titans ultimately eliminated the Dirtbags on their home turf in the third and final game of the series. At season end the Dirtbags' record stood at 42–20–1, marking the most wins by the program in 20 years, since the 1998 team that reached the College World Series semifinal. 2017 also saw LBSU's largest draft class since the MLB draft was reduced in 2012, with 8 dirtbags drafted, headed by first team All-American catcher David Banuelos and second team All-American pitcher Darren McCaughan.\nAfter missing the postseason in 2018 by finishing 5th in the Big West, the Dirtbags began the 2019 season with a 5–26 Start, and Buckley was relieved of his coaching job. Assistant coach Greg Bergeron was named interim head coach following his firing. The team finished the season with a 14–41 overall record, the worst winning percentage since 1988, the year before Dave Snow was hired as head coach.\nThe Valenzuela era (2020–2023).\nOn June 9, 2019, LBSU athletic director Andy Fee announced the hiring of St. Mary's Eric Valenzuela as head coach. In his six seasons as head coach of the Gaels, Valenzuela took a program that had only two winnings seasons in its history prior to his arrival and produced four consecutive 30-win seasons from 2016 to 2019, along with its first ever postseason appearances in 2016 and 2017. A former player at Arizona State and later Pepperdine (from where he graduated), Valenzuela became the first LBSU head coach since Dave Snow (and only the second in over 60 years) to have no prior playing or coaching experience at Long Beach State. But at his opening press conference, Valenzuela spoke highly of the Dirtbag spirit: \"Everyone can play, we can go sign a ton of guys who can play. What separates kids for me is that mentality, that fight.\" Later, in regards to perceived concern among the LBSU alumni base about his lack of roots in the program, he also remarked, \"I'm not an alum, I get it. I do. But if you're talking about any one person that didn't go to Long Beach State that you could call a Dirtbag, you're talking about me.\"\nValenzuela's first season at Long Beach State ended up being the pandemic-shortened 2020 season. The season began promisingly, with the Dirtbags winning all four weekend series to begin the season (including vs then #17 Wake Forest and then #6 Mississippi St). On March 9, the Dirtbags' season record stood at 10-5 and they were ranked in all major polls, including a #12 ranking by Baseball America. On March 12, with LBSU already en route to #29 Tulane for their first away series of the season, the Big West announced the indefinite suspension of all spring competition. Later that same day, the NCAA announced the cancellation of all spring championships. The following day, the Big West announced the immediate cancellation of all remaining spring competition. The Dirtbags' abortive season was described by Baseball America as \"one of 2020's great stories before the season was cut short,\" and caused others to draw parallels between Valenzuela's first season and Dave Snow's iconic rookie campaign in 1989.\nFor the 2021 season, while still operating under pandemic-related restrictions, the Big West announced more restrictive limits on out-of-conference competition. As a result, nearly all of the Dirtbags' out of conference slate was eliminated, the lone exception being a three-game road series in April against fellow California school Pacific. Despite not having any fall practice and being one of he last teams in the country to resume practice in the Spring, the Dirtbags finished third in the conference with an overall record of 28–15, winning 16 of their final 19 contests. During the offseason, Valenzuela was awarded a contract extension though the 2026 season.\nThe Dirtbags' 2022 season was marked by alternating streaks of brilliance and disappointment. The team opened the season with two convincing victories over then #3 Mississippi St), then promptly lost each of their next 6 games, then won 10 of their next 12. The team slumped again just in time for the beginning of conference play, and by the last weekend of April they sat near the bottom of the conference with an overall record of 15–24. But over the last month of the season, the Dirtbags won 14 of their final 17 games and salvaged a 4th-place finish in the conference. At season end, the team ranked 7th in the country in ERA and 247th (out of 293 Division 1 teams) in runs scored per game. In the offseason, athletic director Andy Fee announced he would be leaving to take the same position at the Washington Huskies.\n2023 saw the Dirtbags' highest win total under Valenzuela, as they posted a 33–22 overall record. Their 17–13 mark in conference play was identical to the previous season's, but this time netted only a 7th-place finish in the Big West. Three weeks after the close of the season, Valenzuela made the surprise announcement that he would be leaving Long Beach State to return to St. Mary's to take over the newly vacant head coaching position. At the same time, Associate Head Coach Bryan Peters was announced as the Interim Head Coach. Valenzuela later suggested that Long Beach's prolonged absence of a permanent athletic director played a role in his decision.\nThe Dirtbag spirit.\nAlthough the baseball team – like all other LBSU sports teams – is officially known as the Beach (formerly the 49ers), the baseball team's players and fans alike generally prefer the more colloquial name the \"Dirtbags\". This ironic handle is a great source of pride and shared identity for the program, in no small part because it is frequently misinterpreted by outsiders as being a disparagement (in fact various media outlets have highlighted the program's moniker as particularly undesirable). But regardless of public perception, the term \"Dirtbag\" is in fact distinct from truly pejorative demonyms that have been adopted later as symbols of pride (such as Limey and Hoosier). The term was instead adopted as something to be proud of, referring to the team's scrappy playing style (which left the aggressive players' white uniforms covered in dirt – a \"dirtbag\") and success against higher profile programs.\nThe term first appeared in 1989, the first year under head coach Dave Snow. Inheriting a program that was mired in an extended stretch of sub-par seasons, Snow began his tenure (partly by necessity) by focusing his recruiting efforts on prospects who had been overlooked by higher-profile programs, with an emphasis on finding \"hard-nosed guys with something to prove.\" Over the course of the season, infield coach Dave Malpass would routinely take his players to a local (all-dirt) Pony League field for practices, which Malpass wryly termed \"Dirtbag Field\". As the season progressed, the label was adopted by the players and coaches as symbolic of the tough and gritty mindset that Snow and his staff were cultivating. That year the team (which had finished 14–45 the year before Snow arrived) fought its way to an unexpected 50–15 record, and the school's first ever berth in the College World Series. Decades later, the Dirtbag name continues to be worn with distinction by players old and new.\nYear-by-year results.\n†Poll rankings are from Collegiate Baseball unless otherwise noted\nNotable former players.\nAs of 2023, no fewer than 56 players who played for Long Beach State have made appearances in Major League Baseball, a figure which consistently ranks as one of the highest of any university in the nation.

        "text": "The 1933 National Challenge Cup was the annual open cup held by the United States Football Association now known as the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup. As in 1931, the ASL teams played a round robin format instead of direct knockout games. The five New York teams formed the Metropolitan group. The New England group included the three remaining ASL teams along with Victoria Mills of the Southern New England Association who qualified by defeating Fairlawn Rovers. The Round Robin was somewhat unpopular because of the methods used. Despite a league setup, games tied at the end of regulation were to go into overtime. In the event of a tie in the standings, goal average was used to break the tie. A slight controversy ensued when a game between Boston and Fall River was called at the 78th minute with the score 0-0. Fall River later forfeited the replay leaving Boston tied for first with Pawtucket. The Rangers advanced on better goal average leaving Boston unable to make up the difference in a replay with Fall River or a playoff with Pawtucket. In the West it was business as usual with the standard knockout procedure and the Stix of St. Louis making their second of what would be six consecutive trips to the national final. Other highlights include Bert Patenaude's five goal performance against Fairhill in the First German Club's first round match on January 14.\nWestern Division.\na) aggregate after 3 games&lt;br&gt;\nb) replayed after protest\nRound Robin Groups"

        "text": "The 2009 NCAA Division I lacrosse tournament was the 39th annual tournament hosted by the National Collegiate Athletic Association to determine the team champion of men's college lacrosse among its Division I programs, held at the end of the 2009 NCAA Division I men's lacrosse season. The tournament was played from May 9–25, 2009.\nSyracuse defeated Cornell in the final, 10–9 in overtime.\nThe championship game was played at Gillette Stadium, the home of the NFL's New England Patriots, in Foxborough, Massachusetts, with 41,935 fans in attendance. \nThe first round of the tournament was played on May 9–10 at the home fields of the seeded teams. The quarterfinals were held on May 16–17 on neutral site fields at Hofstra University (James M. Shuart Stadium) and the United States Naval Academy (Navy–Marine Corps Memorial Stadium). The tournament culminated with the semifinals and final held on Memorial Day weekend. \nQualifying teams.\nSixteen NCAA Division I college men's lacrosse teams met after having played their way through a regular season, and for some, a conference tournament, to play in the NCAA Tournament.\nThe NCAA Division I Men’s Lacrosse Committee selected the participating teams for the championship tournament. The committee announced the qualifying teams and the seeding order on Sunday, May 3, 2009. Seven conferences received automatic bids for their top team. The remaining nine teams were selected by the committee as \"at-large\" bids.\nFive conferences held tournament championships, which also determined their NCAA bids. Siena earned an automatic bid by winning the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC) championship for both their first conference title and first NCAA tournament appearance. Villanova earned an automatic bid by winning Colonial Athletic Association (CAA) championship and also made its NCAA tournament debut. Navy earned an automatic bid by winning its fifth Patriot League championship in six years. Both Notre Dame and UMBC repeated as conference champions by winning the Great Western Lacrosse League (GWLL) and America East Conference, respectively.\nTwo conferences awarded their bids based on regular season performance. UMass earned the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) championship and its automatic with a 6–1 conference record. The Ivy League awarded its automatic bid to Cornell. Princeton and Cornell possessed identical conference records and were named co-champions. The head-to-head regular season game, which Cornell had won, acted as the tie-breaking criterion.\nThe remaining nine berths were awarded to at-large teams. Duke won the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) tournament for the third straight season, but the league does not receive an automatic bid because it does not have at least six members. Nevertheless, all four ACC teams received at-large bids: Duke, Maryland, North Carolina, and Virginia. Additionally, the NCAA Selection Committee awarded at-large bids to: independents Johns Hopkins and Syracuse, Brown and Princeton of the Ivy League, and Hofstra of the CAA.\nGame summaries.\nFirst round.\nThe 1st round of the tournament, seven of the eight seeded teams advanced. Every past NCAA tournament had been won by seven of the eight teams that advanced to the quarterfinals, with Duke being the only one to have never won a national title, up to this tournament. For the first time, all four Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) teams advanced to the second round. It was just the second time in tournament history that four teams from the same conference advanced. The first instance occurred in 1990 with Brown, Harvard, Princeton, and Yale of the Ivy League.\nThe tournament began on Saturday, May 9, when the Brown Bears traveled to face the eighth-seeded Johns Hopkins Blue Jays at Homewood Field in Baltimore. The Blue Jays pulled away to three-goal leads in the first and final quarters, but the Bears equalized both times. In the final ten seconds of regulation, Brown attackman Kyle Hollingsworth batted in a loose ball to even the score, 11–11. In overtime, Hopkins won the faceoff and called a timeout, before Brian Christopher drove up the right side of the field and made a game-winning top-corner shot on the run. It was the third overtime goal by Christopher in Hopkins' past four games.\nUMBC then played at number-six seed North Carolina. The UMBC Retrievers possessed the most efficient extra-man offense (EMO) and the best-rated midfield in the nation. Their roster, however, lacked depth, and the first-string midfielders were forced to play in the  heat for almost the entire game. At halftime, the Retrievers led the Tar Heels, 8–6. The lead changed hands several times in the third period, before North Carolina took control for the remainder of the game to win, 15–13. Tar Heels attackman Billy Bitter, who attempted only nine shots, matched the school single-game record with eight goals.\nHofstra played at fifth-seeded Cornell, where the teams were even at halftime, 5–5. The third period was the decisive quarter, and Cornell won three face-offs and outscored Hofstra five-to-one. In Durham, third-seeded Duke hosted Navy. At halftime, the Blue Devils led 10–0 and expanded the rout to 13–1 at the start of the final period. Duke advanced with a final score of 14–5.\nThe second day of the tournament began with the Maryland Terrapins facing the seventh-seeded Notre Dame Fighting Irish at home in South Bend, Indiana. The Fighting Irish entered the game in possession of a perfect 15–0 record, but still considered an unknown variable due to their schedule. The magazine \"Inside Lacrosse\" called the Terrapins a talented team that had underachieved during the regular season. The first-ranked Notre Dame defense frustrated Maryland, but the Terps still managed to gain a 6–1 lead in the third quarter. Maryland's defense effectively shut-down Notre Dame and the leading Irish scorer Ryan Hoff was unable to make a single shot on goal. Maryland was the only unseeded team to advance to the quarterfinals.\nBoth schools making their inaugural NCAA tournament appearance suffered quick elimination. The Villanova Wildcats were trounced by the Virginia Cavaliers, 18–6. The Cavaliers were led by Brian Carroll's career-high five goal performance. The Siena Saints were held scoreless for nearly 42 minutes in their loss to the Syracuse Orange, 11–4. Onondaga Community College transfer Cody Jamieson, who had just been cleared academically, scored three goals in his first start for the Orange.\nAt Princeton University, the Tigers defeated the visiting UMass Minutemen, 10–7. Princeton was led by Mark Kovler's six-point effort. The game was the final in the collegiate career of Minutemen goalkeeper Doc Schneider who led his team to the 2006 championship game as a freshman. His opposite number, Princeton's Tyler Fiorito, became just the second freshman goalkeeper to start an NCAA tournament game for the Tigers.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe quarterfinals took place over the weekend of May 16 to 17 at two neutral sites. The first doubleheader was sponsored on Saturday by Hofstra University, followed by games held at the United States Naval Academy on Sunday. Despite overcast weather at both locations, it was the first time that each NCAA quarterfinals venue attracted in excess of 11,000 spectators.\nThe second round opened at Hofstra's James M. Shuart Stadium with the Maryland–Syracuse match-up. Al Cavalieri filled in as the Orange goalkeeper for long-time starter John Galloway who was sick with the flu. Syracuse scored three unanswered goals in the first quarter before Maryland goalie Brian Phipps suffered an ACL tear. Terrapins midfielder Grant Catalino narrowed the deficit to 5–3 before halftime on an extra-man score. In the second half, Syracuse made defensive adjustments to shut down Maryland's behind-the-goal attack, and the Orange tallied three times in the span of 2:10 to pull away in the third quarter. Syracuse won, 11–6, and extended its postseason streak against Maryland to five.\nIvy League rivals Cornell and Princeton then had their 70th meeting, but first in the NCAA tournament. Earlier in the postseason, the Big Red defeated the Tigers to split the Ivy League championship. Three Princeton shots hit the post in the first half of the second quarter, and Cornell entered halftime with a 5–1 advantage. In the third quarter, Tigers attackman Tommy Davis ended their 27:58 scoring drought with a 15-yard shot. Princeton quickly tallied again with 28 seconds in the period. In the final quarter, the Big Red withstood two penalties to win, 6–4.\nThe second day of the quarterfinals took place at Navy–Marine Corps Memorial Stadium in Annapolis, Maryland. The first game featured top-ranked Virginia and Johns Hopkins. The Cavaliers dominated the Blue Jays, 19–8, in their worst postseason defeat in school history. Shamel Bratton of Virginia scored a career-high five goals. The victory marked the 300th of head coach Dom Starsia's career, and he became the third coach in Division I lacrosse history to win as many games. Virginia advanced to their fourth Final Four appearance in five seasons. With the quarterfinals elimination of both Maryland and Johns Hopkins, 2009 became only the third time since the NCAA tournament began that no team from the state participated in the Final Four.\nThe final game of the round featured intrastate rivals Duke and North Carolina in their third meeting of the season. In the first quarter, the Blue Devils jumped out to an early lead and survived a two-man-down penalty, but the Tar Heels scored four unanswered goals to briefly take the lead in the second quarter. Late in the final period, North Carolina rallied from a four-point deficit to trail by one goal, 12–11. As time expired, a shot by Sean Delaney missed high over the goal, and Duke defeated North Carolina for the third time of the year. The Blue Devils' Zach Howell scored a career-high three goals and Tewaaraton Trophy finalist Ned Crotty tallied twice and had six assists. The Duke defense held Carolina's leading scorer, Billy Bitter, to just two assists.\nSemifinals.\nSyracuse vs. Duke.\nSyracuse met Duke for the first game at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, which was attended by 36,594 fans, a decrease from the previous year's 48,224. Nine Orange players scored in a rout of the Blue Devils, 17–7, which demonstrated the depth of the Syracuse offense. It was the most goals allowed by Duke all season. Seniors Kenny Nims and Patrick Perritt led the Orange with four goals each. Freshman Tim Desko, son of head coach John Desko, and heralded transfer Cody Jamieson each tallied twice. The Orange dominated the faceoff circle and won 18 of 28 draws. To open the third quarter, senior Jake Moulton won the opening faceoff and scored nine seconds into the half. With the victory, the Orange advanced to the championship game for the seventh time since 1999.\nCornell vs. Virginia.\nIn the second game of the day, fifth-seeded Cornell upset first-ranked Virginia. The Big Red upset the Cavaliers decisively, 15–6, and advanced to the championship game for the first time in over two decades. Cornell controlled the game from the start, and accounted for the game's first three tallies and entered halftime with an 8–2 advantage. Big Red freshman Rob Pannell, junior Ryan Hurley, and senior Chris Finn each scored three times. The Cornell defense created 18 turnovers and stymied Virginia's high-powered attack. Commenting on the upset, Cornell head coach Jeff Tambroni said, \"We knew we weren't going to have a whole lot of believers out there. We needed to play hard first and believe second.\"\nChampionship.\nSyracuse vs. Cornell.\nThe final game was also held at Gillette Stadium on Memorial Day May 25. Cornell controlled the game for the first 56 minutes and frustrated Syracuse with a tough defense. With just over five minutes to go in the fourth quarter, the Big Red led, 9–6, before Syracuse's Stephen Keogh and Cody Jamieson narrowed the deficit to one goal with 2:46 remaining. Keogh attempted another shot but missed and Cornell took possession with 27.6 seconds left to play. Kenny Nims dislodged the ball from Matt Moyer and Keogh recovered the ball, making a wild pass, which was caught by Syracuse's Matt Abbott. As he was flattened by Cornell defenders, Abbott got off a desperation pass to Nims, who had run from midfield to the very edge of the crease. The pass was tipped by Cornell’s Roy Lang, but Nims was able to gather in the tipped pass and connect with his shot on goal with four seconds left, sending the game into overtime. Cornell won the overtime faceoff, but Syracuse defenseman Sid Smith stripped Ryan Hurley to create a turnover. Dan Hardy feigned a shot before passing to Jamieson, positioned just beyond the crease, who scored the game-winner.\nPost-tournament honors.\nAfter the championship, Cornell midfielder Max Seibald was honored with the Tewaaraton Trophy for the most outstanding Division I men's lacrosse player. Syracuse attackman Kenny Nims was named the Most Outstanding Player of the tournament. The NCAA named its \"All-Tournament Team\" following the championship game, which consisted of five players each from Syracuse and Cornell. The following individuals made up that team:"

The Rangers made their third Conference Final appearance and first since defeating New Jersey in seven games in 1994. Philadelphia made their fifth Conference Final appearance and first since losing to New Jersey in six games in 1995.\nNew York out shot Philadelphia in Game 1 25–21, but the Flyers ended up winning 3–1. Wayne Gretzky had his second hat-trick of the playoffs in Game 2 as the Rangers edged the Flyers 5–4. With the series tied at 1–1, the two teams moved to Madison Square Garden in New York for Games 3 and 4. This time, it was the Flyers' Eric Lindros who scored a hat-trick as Philadelphia won 6–3. In Game 4, Lindros broke a 2–2 tie with just seven seconds remaining in regulation, and the Flyers won 3–2. The Rangers scored twice in 26 seconds in the first period to take a 2–1 lead. The Flyers scored three unanswered goals and won the game 4–2 and the series 4–1. This was the last playoff game for both Gretzky and Mark Messier, as neither of the players' teams made the post-season for the rest of their careers.\nWestern Conference final.\n(1) Colorado Avalanche vs. (3) Detroit Red Wings.\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with Colorado winning the only previous series. This was a rematch of the previous season's Western Conference Final, which Colorado won in six games. This was Detroit's third straight and fifth overall Conference Finals appearance, while it was Colorado's fourth trip to Conference Final. The rivalry between the two teams was as heated as ever after the events of a brawl during a game on March 26 still fresh.\nThe Red Wings played a determined Game 1 as Brendan Shanahan broke a scoreless tie at 1:13 of the third period to give Detroit a 1–0 lead. Joe Sakic scored just 27 seconds later and Mike Ricci added another at 6:13 gave Colorado a 2–1 lead that they would not relinquish. In Game 2, Colorado led 2–0 but Detroit pulled to within one on a power-play goal by Igor Larionov at 16:51 of the second period. The Red Wings then went on to score three times in the third period to win 4–2 and tie the series at one game apiece. In Game 3, the Red Wings got two goals from Vyacheslav Kozlov and went on to win 2–1. Detroit also won Game 4, 6–0. Red Wings goaltender Mike Vernon made 19 saves in the shutout and Igor Larionov and Kirk Maltby both scored twice. Detroit now led the series three games to one. Embarrassed and frustrated after such a lopsided loss in Game 4, Colorado came right back in Game 5 with a 6–0 win of their own, with Patrick Roy stopping all 32 shots he faced. Claude Lemieux and Joe Sakic both scored two goals in the victory. In Game 6, the Red Wings looked to close out the series. Sergei Fedorov's goal at 6:11 of the third period gave Detroit a 2–0 lead. Scott Young pulled Colorado to within one on a goal at 14:48, but the Avalanche could not score the equalizer, and Brendan Shanahan sealed the game and series for Detroit with an empty net goal at 19:30.\nStanley Cup Finals.\nThis was the first and to date only playoff series between these two teams. Detroit made their twentieth appearance in the Finals and second in the past three years. Their last appearance was in 1995, where they were upset by the New Jersey Devils in a sweep. Philadelphia made their seventh appearance in the Finals and first since 1987 when they lost to the Edmonton Oilers in seven games. Detroit last won the Stanley Cup in 1955, while Philadelphia last won the Stanley Cup in 1975. The Red Wings swept the Flyers to win their first Stanley Cup since 1955 and eighth overall, ending what was the longest Stanley Cup title drought in the league at that time.\nWith the loss, the Flyers' record in the Stanley Cup Finals fell to 2-5. The Red Wings would win the Stanley Cup three more times after this in 1998, 2002, and 2008. The 1997 Stanley Cup Finals began a streak of playoff success for Detroit-based teams over their Philadelphia counterparts. After the Red Wings' victory, the NBA's Detroit Pistons would defeat the Philadelphia 76ers in the NBA playoffs in 2003, 2005, and 2008.\nPlayoff statistics.\nSkaters.\nThese are the top ten skaters based on points.\nGoaltenders.\nThis is a combined table of the top five goaltenders based on goals against average and the top five goaltenders based on save percentage, with at least 420 minutes played.

        "text": "The 1996 Stanley Cup playoffs, the playoff tournament of the National Hockey League (NHL), began on April 16, 1996. The playoffs ended on June 10, 1996, with the Colorado Avalanche sweeping the Florida Panthers to win their first Stanley Cup in franchise history in both teams' first Finals appearance. Colorado became the first relocated team to win the Stanley Cup in their inaugural season after relocating from Quebec City prior to the start of the regular season.\nThe New Jersey Devils became the first defending champion to fail to qualify for the playoffs since the Montreal Canadiens in 1970. Five Canadian teams qualified for the playoffs and all of them were eliminated during the opening round. This was the first time that both Florida teams (the Florida Panthers and Tampa Bay Lightning) made it to the playoffs, each in their inaugural appearance. For the second time in three years and the last time until 2013, all of the Original Six teams reached the playoffs. This was also the last time all three California-based teams missed the playoffs in the same year until 2020.\nPlayoff seeds.\nThe following teams qualified for the playoffs:\nPlayoff bracket.\nIn each round, the highest remaining seed in each conference was matched against the lowest remaining seed. The higher-seeded team was awarded home ice advantage. In the Stanley Cup Finals, home ice was awarded to the team with the better regular season record. Each best-of-seven series followed a 2–2–1–1–1 format: the higher-seeded team played at home for games one and two (and games five and seven, if necessary), and the lower-seeded team was at home for games three and four (and game six, if necessary).\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nConference quarterfinals.\nEastern Conference quarterfinals.\n(1) Philadelphia Flyers vs. (8) Tampa Bay Lightning.\nThis was the first playoff meeting between these two teams.

They last met in the 1989 Clarence Campbell Conference final, which Calgary won in five games.\n(4) Toronto Maple Leafs vs. (5) St. Louis Blues.\nThis was the fifth playoff meeting between these two teams: with the teams splitting the four previous playoff series.

This was Pittsburgh's third Conference Final appearance. They last made the Conference Final in 1992, where they defeated the Boston Bruins in four games. This was Florida's first Conference Final appearance in their third season since entering the league as an expansion team in 1993.\nDespite being outshot 33–25 in game one, the Panthers came out on top with an impressive 5–1 win. Florida goaltender John Vanbiesbrouck made 32 saves and Florida forward Tom Fitzgerald scored twice. The Penguins wanting to avoid going down two games to none against the Panthers came out with a better effort in game two and won the game 3–2 and evened the series at one game each. In game three, the Panthers fired an incredible 61 shots on Penguins goaltender Tom Barrasso and it paid off as the Panthers won 5–2 to take a 2–1 series lead, with Florida forward Stu Barnes scoring twice. Going into the third period of game four, the Penguins trailed 1–0. Pittsburgh tied the score on Brad Lauer's goal with 11:03 remaining in regulation, then Bryan Smolinski scored the go ahead goal with 3:31 to go to give the Penguins a 2–1 lead.

In game seven, Florida took a 1–0 lead on Mike Hough's goal at 13:13 of the first period. After a scoreless second period, Pittsburgh tied the game on Petr Nedved's power-play goal at 1:23 of the third period. The Panthers regained the lead on Tom Fitzgerald's bizarre 58-foot slapshot at 6:18 and got an insurance goal from Johan Garpenlov at 17:23. Florida hung on to win the game 3–1 and the series four games to three, John Vanbiesbrouck making 39 saves in the victory. This was the last playoff series victory for the Panthers until 2022 when they beat the Washington Capitals in six games, and was their last appearance in the Conference Finals until 2023.\nWestern Conference final.\n(1) Detroit Red Wings vs. (2) Colorado Avalanche.\nThis was the first playoff meeting between these two teams. This was Detroit's second consecutive and fourth overall Conference Final appearance. They defeated the Chicago Blackhawks in the previous year in five games. This was Colorado's third Conference Final appearance in franchise history and first since relocating to Colorado. They last went to the Conference Final in 1985, which they lost to the Philadelphia Flyers in six games when the team was known as the Quebec Nordiques.\nGame 1 was a hard-fought battle. The score was tied at two in the first overtime period when Mike Keane scored at 17:31 to give Colorado a 3–2 win. The Avalanche won Game 2, 3–0, with Colorado goaltender Patrick Roy stopping all 35 shots faced. Down two games to none, the Red Wings played solidly in Game 3. Detroit defencemen Nicklas Lidstrom and Vladimir Konstantinov combined to score three goals (including a shorthanded goal by Konstantinov) and Detroit won 6–4. In game four the Red Wings outshot the Avalanche 31–17 but lost the game 4–2 thanks to 29 saves made by Patrick Roy.\nDetroit played with desperation and determination in game five. Inspired by Vladimir Konstantinov's big body check on Avalanche forward Claude Lemieux, the Red Wings went on to win 5–2. The Red Wings victory forced a Game 6 back in Colorado. Game 6 became famous in the history of the Red Wings-Avalanche rivalry. At 14:07 of the first period, Detroit forward Kris Draper was down along the half-boards at centre ice when Colorado forward Claude Lemieux checked Draper's head from behind into the edge of the bench. The hit sent Draper to the hospital with a broken jaw and a shattered cheek and orbital bone, which required surgery and stitches. Draper did not return to play until the middle of the 1996–97 season. While Lemieux was assessed a five-minute major penalty and a game misconduct match penalty for the hit, the Avalanche went on to win the game 4–1 and completed the upset. The controversial hit on Draper by Lemieux was a catalyst (along with a rough hit by Kozlov on Foote in Game 3) for the Detroit–Colorado rivalry that endured for a decade.\nStanley Cup Finals.\nSince the formation of the NHL in 1917 this was the only time to date that both teams competing in the Stanley Cup Finals made their first appearance.\nThis was the first and to date only playoff series between these two teams. This was also the first Stanley Cup Finals ever played in the Deep South. Colorado made their first Finals appearance in their first season in Denver, this was the franchise's seventeenth season in the league, while Florida made their first Finals appearance in just their third season of existence. Colorado became the third NHL team to win the Stanley Cup following a relocation, and the first to do so in their inaugural season after relocation. This was the Panthers' last Finals appearance until 2023. The Avalanche swept the Panthers to win their first Stanley Cup title in franchise history.\nPlayoff statistics.\nSkaters.\nThese are the top ten skaters based on points.\nGoaltenders.\nThis is a combined table of the top five goaltenders based on goals against average and the top five goaltenders based on save percentage, with at least 420 minutes played.

        "title": "1994 Stanley Cup playoffs",
        "text": "The 1994 Stanley Cup playoffs, the playoff tournament of the National Hockey League (NHL), began after the conclusion of the 1993–94 NHL season. The sixteen teams that qualified, eight from each conference, played best-of-seven game series for conference quarterfinals, semifinals and championships; and then the conference champions played a best-of-seven series for the Stanley Cup. The playoffs ended when the New York Rangers defeated the Vancouver Canucks in the seventh game of the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals. In total, an NHL record seven game sevens were played in this year's playoffs, two of which went to overtime.\nFor the first time since joining the NHL, all four former WHA teams (the Edmonton Oilers, Hartford Whalers, Quebec Nordiques, and Winnipeg Jets) failed to make the playoffs. Wayne Gretzky also missed the playoffs for the first time in his career. Conversely, the San Jose Sharks became the first post-1990 expansion team to make the playoffs. All series played between Central and Pacific Division teams had a 2–3–2 format to reduce travel. This remains the last time that two Canadian teams made it to the Conference Finals in the same year, let alone faced each other in that particular round.\nPlayoff seeds.\nThis was the first season of the NHL's new conference-oriented playoff format, emulating the NBA's seeding format in use then for the opening round. The following teams qualified for the playoffs:\nPlayoff bracket.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nConference quarterfinals.\nEastern Conference quarterfinals.\n(1) New York Rangers vs. (8) New York Islanders.\nThe New York Rangers earned the Presidents' Trophy as the NHL's best regular season team with 112 points. The Islanders qualified as the eighth seed earning 84 points during the regular season. This was the eighth playoff series between these two rivals, with the Islanders winning five of the previous seven series. They last met in the 1990 Patrick Division Semifinals which the Rangers won in five games. The Islanders won the season series earning six of ten points during this year's five game regular season series.\nThis was the last time that the Islanders got swept in a playoff series until the 2019 Eastern Conference Second Round.\n(2) Pittsburgh Penguins vs. (7) Washington Capitals.\nThe Pittsburgh Penguins entered the playoffs as the second seed in the Eastern Conference by winning the Northeast Division with 101 points. The Washington Capitals earned 88 points during the regular season to finish seventh overall in the Eastern Conference. This was the third playoff meeting between these two rivals, with Pittsburgh winning both previous series. They last met in the 1992 Patrick Division Semifinals which Pittsburgh won in seven games after erasing a 3–1 deficit. Washington won the season series earning five of eight points during this year's four game regular season series.\nUntil their championship season, this was the only time the Capitals had defeated the Penguins in their first ten playoff series.\n(3) New Jersey Devils vs. (6) Buffalo Sabres.\nThe New Jersey Devils entered the playoffs as the third seed in the Eastern Conference with 106 points. The Buffalo Sabres earned 95 points during the regular season to finish sixth overall in the Eastern Conference. This was the first playoff meeting between these two teams. New Jersey won three of the four games in this year's regular season series.\n(4) Boston Bruins vs. (5) Montreal Canadiens.\nThe Boston Bruins entered the playoffs as the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference with 97 points. The Montreal Canadiens earned 96 points during the regular season to finish fifth overall in the Eastern Conference. This was the twenty-eighth playoff meeting between these two rivals, with Montreal winning twenty-one of the previous twenty-seven series. This was also the tenth time in eleven years these two team had met in the playoffs. They last met in the 1992 Adams Division Finals, which Boston won in a four-game sweep. Montreal won the season series earning six of ten points during this year's five game regular season series. Game six was the final playoff game in the Montreal Forum.\nWestern Conference quarterfinals.\n(1) Detroit Red Wings vs. (8) San Jose Sharks.\nThe Detroit Red Wings entered the playoffs as the Western Conference regular season champions with 100 points. The San Jose Sharks earned 82 points during the regular season to finish eighth overall in the Western Conference. This was the first playoff meeting between these two teams. The Sharks made their first appearance in the Stanley Cup playoffs in their third season since entering the league in the 1991–92 season. The most recent team to represent the San Francisco Bay Area prior to this was the Oakland Seals, who lost in the Stanley Cup Quarterfinals in 1970. Detroit won three of the four games in this year's regular season series. The Sharks shocked the top-seeded Red Wings in seven games, becoming the first eighth-seeded team in North American sports history to defeat a number one seed.\n(2) Calgary Flames vs. (7) Vancouver Canucks.\nThe Calgary Flames entered the playoffs as the second seed in the Western Conference by winning the Pacific Division with 97 points. The Vancouver Canucks earned 85 points during the regular season to finish seventh overall in the Western Conference. This was the fifth playoff meeting between these two rivals, with Calgary winning three of the previous four series. They last met in the 1989 Smythe Division Semifinals which the Flames won in seven games. Calgary won the season series earning nine of fourteen points during this year's seven game regular season series.\nThe Canucks won the series after being down 3–1. They are the only team to date to win a series after being down 3–1 with all three games being won in overtime.\n(3) Toronto Maple Leafs vs. (6) Chicago Blackhawks.\nThe Toronto Maple Leafs entered the playoffs as the third seed in the Western Conference with 98 points. The Chicago Blackhawks earned 87 points during the regular season to finish sixth overall in the Western Conference. This was the eighth playoff meeting between these two teams, with Toronto winning five of the seven previous series. They last met in the 1986 Norris Division Semifinals which Toronto won in a three-game sweep. These teams split their six-game regular season series. Game six was the last NHL game played at Chicago Stadium.\n(4) Dallas Stars vs. (5) St. Louis Blues.\nThe Dallas Stars entered the playoffs as the fourth seed in the Western Conference with 97 points. The St. Louis Blues earned 91 points during the regular season to finish fifth overall in the Western Conference. This was the tenth playoff meeting between these two teams, with St. Louis winning five of the nine previous series. They last met in the 1991 Norris Division Finals which the then Minnesota North Stars won in six games. Dallas won the season series earning seven of twelve points during this year's six game regular season series. This was the first time the city of Dallas was represented in the Stanley Cup playoffs.\nGame four was the last game played at the St. Louis Arena.\nConference semifinals.\nEastern Conference semifinals.\n(1) New York Rangers vs. (7) Washington Capitals.\nThis was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams, with Washington winning two of the previous three series. They last met in the 1991 Patrick Division Semifinals, which Washington won in six games.\n(3) New Jersey Devils vs. (4) Boston Bruins.\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams. Their only previous meeting was in the 1988 Prince of Wales Conference Final, which Boston won in seven games.\nWestern Conference semifinals.\n(4) Dallas Stars vs. (7) Vancouver Canucks.\nThis was the first playoff meeting between these two teams.\n(3) Toronto Maple Leafs vs. (8) San Jose Sharks.\nThis was the first playoff meeting between these two teams.\nConference finals.\nEastern Conference final.\n(1) New York Rangers vs. (3) New Jersey Devils.\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with New York winning the only previous series. They last met in the 1992 Patrick Division Semifinals, which New York won in seven games. New York made their third Semifinals/Conference Final appearance since the league began using a 16-team or greater playoff format in 1980. They were defeated in five games by the Montreal Canadiens in their most recent Conference Finals appearance in 1986. New Jersey made their second appearance in the Conference Final. Their most recent appearance was in the 1988 Prince of Wales Conference Final, which New Jersey lost against the Boston Bruins in seven games. New York won all six games in this year's regular season series.\nWith a minute remaining in game one at Madison Square Garden, New York was leading 3–2. However, Devils forward Claude Lemieux tied the game on a scramble in front of New York goaltender Mike Richter. The Devils went on to win the game on Stephane Richer's breakaway goal at 15:23 of the second overtime. The Rangers evened the series winning game two in a 4–0 shutout. The series then turned to the Meadowlands in East Rutherford, New Jersey, for games three and four. Like game one, game three went into double overtime but this time it was New York who won 3–2 on Stephane Matteau's goal at 6:13 of the second overtime period. The Devils won game four by a final score of 3–1 and evened the series at 2–2. The Devils took the series lead with a 4–1 win at Madison Square Garden in game five.\nDespite the fact that his team trailed in the series 3–2, Rangers captain Mark Messier made a highly publicized guarantee that New York would win game six. After trailing New Jersey by a score of 2–1 after two periods Messier himself scored a third-period hat trick to rally the Rangers to a 4–2 victory. Rangers coach Mike Keenan said of the guarantee, \"Mark was sending a message to his teammates that he believed together we could win. He put on an amazing performance to make sure it happened.\"\nGame seven played at Madison Square Garden, was a goaltending battle between New Jersey's Martin Brodeur and New York's Mike Richter. Brian Leetch gave the Rangers a 1–0 lead in the second period. Richter shut out the Devils for over 59 minutes before conceding a goal to Devils forward Valeri Zelepukin with just 7.7 seconds remaining in regulation. The two teams played into double overtime for the third time in the series and for the second time in the series it was Stephane Matteau who scored the game winner. Matteau scored on a wrap-around at 4:24 of the second overtime period as the Rangers won the game 2–1 and the series 4–3. Many consider this one of the greatest hockey playoff series of all time.\nWestern Conference final.\n(3) Toronto Maple Leafs vs. (7) Vancouver Canucks.\nThis was the first and to date only playoff series between these two teams. Toronto made their second consecutive and second overall Conference Final appearance. They were defeated in seven games by the Los Angeles Kings in the previous year. Vancouver made their second appearance in the Conference Final. Their most recent appearance was in the 1982 Clarence Campbell Conference Final, which Vancouver won against the Chicago Black Hawks in five games. These teams split their four-game regular season series. This remains the last Conference Finals series to be played entirely in Canada by two Canadian-based teams.\nToronto won Game 1 at Maple Leaf Gardens on Peter Zezel's goal at 16:55 of the first overtime period. After that, however, the Maple Leafs could not seem to slow down the bigger, more powerful Canucks. Vancouver edged Toronto 4–3 in Game 2 and then shut out the Maple Leafs at the Pacific Coliseum in Games 3 and 4 by scores of 4–0 and 2–0 respectively. Down three games to one and facing elimination, the Maple Leafs played much better in Game 5. They pushed Vancouver to double overtime, but Vancouver forward Greg Adams beat Leafs goaltender Felix Potvin just 14 seconds into the second overtime period to give the Canucks a 4–3 win and a 4–1 series win.\nStanley Cup Finals.\nThis was the first and to date only playoff series between these two teams. This was Vancouver's second appearance in the Finals; in their last Finals appearance they were swept by the Islanders in . The Rangers were making their tenth appearance in the Finals and first since losing in five games to Montreal in . The Rangers last won the Stanley Cup in 1940. With the Rangers having 112 points against Vancouver's 85, the 27 point difference was the largest point differential between two teams in the Stanley Cup Finals since 1982 when 41 points separated the New York Islanders (118) and Vancouver (77).\nIn a back and forth series that went the maximum seven games, one lengthy drought ended and another began. The Rangers won the Stanley Cup for their fourth title in franchise history, and first since , while the Canucks were the last Canadian team to play for the Stanley Cup until the Calgary Flames. This was the longest streak that Canadian teams did not qualify for the Finals from 1995 to 2003 (9 years). Prior to this the longest streak of Canadian teams missing the Finals was just three years.\nPlayoff statistics.\nSkaters.\nThese are the top ten skaters based on points.\nGoaltenders.\nThis is a combined table of the top five goaltenders based on goals against average and the top five goaltenders based on save percentage, with at least 420 minutes played.

        "title": "News of the World Snooker Tournament",
        "text": "The News of the World Snooker Tournament was one of the leading professional tournaments of the 1950s, widely considered as more important than the world championship due to the involvement of Joe Davis. The event was sponsored by the Sunday newspaper \"News of the World\". The highest break of the tournament was 140 or more on four occasions, which was unusual at that time.\nThere were three distinct periods in the tournament's history. The first six editions, from 1949/50 to 1954/55, were held at Leicester Square Hall in London. The event was played on a round-robin basis and used a handicap system. Matches were played over three days as the best of 37 frames. The total prize money was £1,500 with £500 awarded to the winner. There were initially eight competitors, and later nine, requiring 28 or 36 matches to be played. With two matches played per week, this meant that the tournament extended over 14 or 18 weeks, although it was somewhat longer because of the Christmas break.\nAfter the closure of Leicester Square Hall in January 1955, the tournament was held at a variety of venues around England and Jersey from 1955/56 to 1957/58. The number of competitors was reduced to six, meaning that only 15 matches had to be played. Generally, two matches were played over the course of one week at each of the selected venues in turn, but otherwise the format of the tournament remained unchanged.\nThe format changed again in late 1958. All matches were held at Burroughes Hall in London but the number of competitors was further reduced to four. Instead of a best-of-37-frame match, each competitor played the others in three separate 13-frame matches, and there were no handicaps. With only six matches to be played, two per week, the tournament was completed in three weeks. The first prize was £400. The final edition, in late 1959, was also played at Burroughes Hall. It used the Snooker Plus rules, with three competitors playing 25-frame matches and was again completed in three weeks.\nHistory.\nThe first edition of the tournament was held between September 1949 and January 1950 using a similar format to the 1948 Sunday Empire News Tournament but without the \"sealed handicap\" aspect. Four players were involved in a qualifying competition, the winner joining seven others in the main event. The eight competitors in the main event were Joe Davis, Walter Donaldson, George Chenier, Horace Lindrum, Sidney Smith, Peter Mans and Albert Brown who won the qualifying event. The 1949 World Snooker Champion, Fred Davis, did not enter because he objected to the matches being played over three days rather than the normal six. All matches were played over 37 frames and each player was given a handicap at the start of the tournament. Davis received a handicap of −7, Donaldson zero, Chenier 13, Lindrum 13, Smith 13, Pulman 14, Mans 16, and Brown 19. The player with the higher handicap received a start in every frame, his starting score being the difference between the two handicaps. Despite being the only player with a negative handicap, Joe Davis won six of his seven matches, and the tournament. Albert Brown had seemed the likely winner going into his last match, but he lost the match and eventually finished in third place behind Sidney Smith.\nThe 1959 tournament was played under the snooker plus format, a new variant with two additional (orange and purple), allowing a maximum break of 210. The format, which was developed by Joe Davis, made its professional debut at this tournament on 26 October at the Burroughes Hall in London. There were only three players in the competition, with Davis becoming champion after winning five of his six matches. The 'snooker plus' experiment was not a success; the format was abandoned and the tournament series discontinued.\nWinners.\nSource:"

        "title": "English cricket team in Australia and New Zealand in 1881–82",
        "text": "An England cricket team toured Australia, New Zealand and the United States between September 1881 and March 1882. The tour was privately organised by the professional players James Lillywhite, junior, Alfred Shaw and Arthur Shrewsbury. In all matches other than Tests, the team was called A. Shaw's XI. In Australia, the tour itinerary consisted of seven first-class matches, including a four-match Test series against Australia. The Test series was won 2–0 by Australia with two matches drawn. The Ashes, which began later in 1882, were not at stake. None of the matches in either New Zealand or the United States have been ascribed first-class status.\nThe team left England in September 1881 and sailed across the Atlantic first to play five matches in the United States during October. Their first match in Australia began on 23 November. After completing the first Test at the turn of the year, the team went to New Zealand for seven matches before returning to Australia in February and playing the last three Tests. The tour ended on 18 March. Besides the four Tests, two matches against Victoria and one match against New South Wales have been recognised as first-class.\nThe tour became the subject of a potential betting scandal after certain English players were implicated in rumours about receiving money to participate in match-fixing. The match in question was against Victoria at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, played 16–20 December 1881. In the end, nothing could be proven and the matter was eventually dropped, but not until after a degree of public discussion in English cricket.\nTest series.\nAustralia and England played four Tests between 31 December 1881 and 14 March 1882. Australia won the series 2–0 with two matches drawn:\nThroughout the series, overs consisted of four deliveries each.\nFirst Test – Melbourne.\nWhilst this match was designated as a timeless Test, the ship that was due to take the tourists to New Zealand was set to depart on the morning of 4 January. The authorities pushed back the ship's departure time to 3:45 pm in the hope that the match would yield a result. However, it was all in vain as after 55 overs in the fourth innings Australia were still 156 runs short of their target with three wickets down. The result was Test cricket's first ever draw.\nFourth Test – Melbourne.\nWhilst this match was designated as a timeless Test, the tourists were due to depart Melbourne on the evening on 14 March in order to play a two-day match in Dunolly the following day. With rain washing out the entire fourth day's play, this resulted in Test cricket's second ever draw and Australia taking out the series 2–0.\nControversy.\nA potential scandal arose following the match against Victoria in December when it was alleged that certain English players had agreed to take part in a betting scam and attempt to throw the match. Team captain Alfred Shaw suspected there was a conspiracy but his team won by 18 runs and, as he later said: \"Whatever the scheme actually was, it failed\".\nThe issue became the opening topic in the inaugural issue of \"\", published on 10 May 1882. The editor's first words were: \"The new cricket season will probably begin with a scandal\". He went on to bemoan his perception that, in Australia, \"large sums are betted on matches\" but admitted the same was true of England until about fifty years previously. After paying his respects to \"the class of gentlemen of leisure\" who run cricket in England, he concluded by saying that \"it is worth no man's while to buy or sell a match; and we may trust that the colonial vice (\"sic\") will never take firm root at Lord's or at the Oval\". No details of the expected scandal were given at that time. The affair dragged on for a few weeks and Lord Harris, first among the class of gentlemen of leisure, became involved by writing a letter to \"The Times\" in which he demanded \"public refutation\" of the rumours.\nAccording to Shaw, he was told that Billy Midwinter had been approached by George Ulyett and John Selby, who wanted Midwinter to take part in the scam. Victoria were in a strong position but the weather was against them and there was the strong probability that they would need to bat on a \"sticky wicket\" in their final innings. That is what happened and Shaw's XI surprisingly won by 18 runs after being obliged to follow on. Even so, Shaw was aware that \"most extravagant odds\" were being offered on Victoria to win and, although he was sceptical about the allegation, he refused to let either Midwinter or Ulyett bowl. He relied mainly on Ted Peate, who was the match-winner with a return of 6/30, and used four other bowlers in support: himself, Billy Bates, Tom Emmett and Dick Barlow.\nThe tour had ended and the players were sailing home when the rumours became public. There were later reports of two fights on ship-board, both apparently involving Selby. In one of these, Selby allegedly assaulted Midwinter because he had refused to participate in the scam, but Midwinter got the better of him and Ulyett intervened. It is not clear if Ulyett attacked Midwinter or if he stopped the fight. The second fight allegedly involved William Scotton who had taken exception to something, and this may also have involved Selby. However, Scotton had known marital issues and his fight may well have been about that.\nIn the end, after various denials had been publicly stated as demanded by Harris, nothing could be proved and the whole matter was dropped."

        "title": "1923 Rose Bowl",
        "text": "The 1923 Rose Bowl, played on January 1, 1923, was an American Football bowl game. It was the 9th Rose Bowl Game. The USC Trojans defeated the Penn State Nittany Lions 14-3. Leo Calland, a USC guard, was named the Rose Bowl Player of the Game when the award was created in 1953 and selections were made retroactively. It was the first bowl game appearance for both the University of Southern California and Pennsylvania State University football teams. It was also the first Tournament of Roses football game held in the newly constructed Rose Bowl Stadium, although other games had been played in it prior to this one.\nStadium.\nThe game now known as the Rose Bowl Game was played at Tournament Park until 1922 when it was known as the \"Tournament East-West football game\". Organizers of the Tournament of Roses realized that the temporary stands were inadequate for a crowd of 40,000+, and sought to build a better, permanent stadium.\nThe Rose Bowl was designed by architect Myron Hunt in 1921. His design, as well as the name for the stadium, was influenced by the Yale Bowl. The Arroyo Seco (translation \"dry stream\") was selected as the location for the stadium. The Rose Bowl was under construction from 1921 to 1922.\nA number of regular season games were played there before the actual Tournament of Roses football game to try out the new stadium. USC had actually already played three games in the new stadium: USC lost to California in the very first game in the stadium on October 28, 1922, and defeated Idaho and Washington State in the new stadium to close out their season. The Olympic Club also played a football game there. The stadium was dedicated officially on January 1, 1923.\nTeams.\nPenn State Nittany Lions.\nIn the 1921 season, Penn State was 8–2–0 with wins over Navy, Georgia Tech, and Washington. In the 1922 season the Lions opened with wins over St. Bonaventure, William and Mary, Gettysburg, Lebanon Valley. By mid October they were viewed as a likely candidate to be invited to play in the Rose Bowl. On October 21, the Nittany Lions got their fifth straight season win against Middlebury for their homecoming game. Penn State was officially extended an invitation by the Tournament committee, and they accepted.\nThe Lions tied Syracuse 0–0 at the Polo Grounds in New York city in front of their largest seasonal crowd to date, 25,000. Then the Nittany Lions lost to Navy 0–14 in Washington D.C., breaking a 30-game undefeated streak on November 3. Despite the loss, the Tournament selection committee re-affirmed its choice. They beat Carnegie Tech, but the Tournament committee still faced controversy. They re-affirmed their decision again. The Nittany Lions then lost to in-state rivals Pennsylvania and Pittsburgh.\nUSC Trojans.\nThe Trojans opened 5-0 to start the season. This was the first season of competition in the Pacific Coast Conference for the USC Trojans. The first PCC conference game was against California. The very first game in the Rose Bowl stadium was the regular season contest on October 28, 1922, when Cal defeated USC 12-0. This was the only loss for USC, and California finished the season undefeated. Cal declined the invitation to the 1923 Rose Bowl game by vote of the associated students. This made the deciding games to be whether Cal would defeat Washington by more than 12, and whether USC would defeat Stanford on November 11. USC went on to beat Occidental and Stanford. The Trojans then played Idaho, and Washington State in the new Rose Bowl stadium and defeated both. The Trojans actually finished fourth in the PCC behind Cal, Oregon, and Washington. The PCC committee held a mail vote. The Trojans were given the berth on the basis of the defeat of Washington State and the tie between Washington and Oregon on Thanksgiving Day. The Trojans received six of eight conference votes.\nGame summary.\nThe 29-member Penn State traveling party left State College, Pennsylvania, by train on December 19. They stopped in Chicago and the Grand Canyon. They arrived in Pasadena, California, on December 24. The Nittany Lions worked out in the Rose Bowl stadium, alternating with the Trojans. Lions coach Bezdek was noted for changing their play style frequently.\nThe morning of the game on January 1, the team watched the Tournament of Roses Parade. The Lions left in several taxi cabs at 11 a.m. for the drive to the Rose Bowl, but as the 2:15 p.m. kickoff approached, the team was delayed by post-parade traffic. Only after the cab drivers drove over the lawns of local residents did the Penn State team finally reach the Rose\nBowl stadium.\nWhen the team arrived, they found kickoff already had been delayed by 10 minutes. Penn State coach Hugo Bezdek and USC coach Gus Henderson almost came to blows as Bezdek successfully lobbied game officials for additional warmup time. The game finally started an hour late and ended in moonlight, with sportswriters lighting matches in order to finish their stories.\nPenn State scored first on a 20-yard drop-kick field goal by Mike Palm. Roy \"Bullet\" Baker rushed for 123 yards and one touchdown for the Trojans. The Lions were held to five first downs and 104 yards.\nScoring.\nFourth Quarter.\nno score\nAftermath.\nThe nearby Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum also was under construction during this time and would be completed in May 1923. It would become the home stadium for both USC and UCLA for decades until UCLA moved to the Rose Bowl for its home games in 1982.\nPenn State's share of the proceeds, $21,349.64, was directed toward the $2 million Emergency Building Fund and in particular the construction of Varsity Hall (now Irvin Hall) on campus.\nThe game was the first USC game attended by Giles Pellerin, at the time a high school student. Pellerin, who became known as the \"Super Fan\", would go on to attend 797 consecutive USC football games over a period of 73 years until his death at age 91 just outside the same stadium in 1998."

        "text": "The Mount Juliet Hotel &amp; Golf Course is situated in Mount Juliet Estate Thomastown, County Kilkenny, Ireland.\nHistory.\nThe estate developed from what was previously the lands of the Norman Walton family known as Walton's Grove and was owned by them until Oliver Cromwell seized the lands in 1653. This was combined with the area and townland known as Ballylinch () which was also dispossessed by Cromwell from a Norman family and later granted to one of his supporters. The surrounding area of Thomastown had originally been granted to Thomas FitzAnthony on the Norman conquest of Ireland and it is from this Thomas that the town got its name.\nThe Mount Juliet Estate was constructed by Somerset Butler, 1st Earl of Carrick between 1768-71 and named after his wife Juliet. It consists of a Georgian house set on a hill overlooking the River Nore, surrounded by over of land.\nFrom the early 1900s the property and lands were owned by the McCalmont family including Hugh McCalmont and later his son Dermot McCalmont (1887–1968) who inherited a large fortune from his cousin Harry McCalmont. Extensive renovations and upgrading was carried out by them on the house in 1905-06.\nThe house and lands were sold to the Killeen Group in 1987, who proceeded to develop the estate, incorporating a hotel, stud, golf course and residential properties. The contents of the original house were also sold at auction by Sotheby's in 1986 and 1987.\nIn 2002, a deal was signed that saw the hotel, spa and stud join the Conrad Hotels brand operated by Hilton Hotels Corporation. That arrangement was terminated late in 2009.\nIn 2014, the estate was purchased by the Tetrarch group. The hotel also has a Michelin starred restaurant, the Lady Helen.\nGolf.\nThe par 72, Jack Nicklaus designed golf course opened in 1991. It was voted the \"Best Parkland Golf Course\" in Ireland by Backspin Golf Magazine in 2008 and 2010. Other facilities at Mount Juliet include a driving range, practice putting greens and a golf academy.\nMount Juliet was the venue for the 2002 and 2004 WGC-American Express Championship, and hosted the European Tour's Irish Open on three occasions between 1993 and 1995. The event is scheduled to return in 2022. The course was also visited by Shell's Wonderful World of Golf in 1997, for a challenge match between Tom Watson and Fred Couples."

        "title": "Northland cricket team",
        "text": "The Northland cricket team represents the Northland region of New Zealand. It competes in the Hawke Cup.\nHistory.\nThe first mention of cricket in the history of New Zealand is from Northland: a game on the beach at Paihia, in the Bay of Islands, in December 1832. However, it was not until 1926 that a regional cricket body, the North Auckland Cricket Association, was established. The first match for the Dargaville Shield, contested by clubs within the Association, was played in January 1927, when Mangonui beat Northern Wairoa. North Auckland, captained by W. J. Dunning, played their first representative match when they drew a two-day match with Auckland in Auckland in April 1928.\nThe Association applied for affiliation with the New Zealand Cricket Council in 1932 in order to be eligible to compete for the Hawke Cup. The NZCC granted Northland minor association status in 1936.\nNorthland (playing as North Auckland) challenged for the Hawke Cup for the first time in April 1939, when they were overwhelmed by Waikato by 341 runs at Seddon Park in Hamilton, although Noel Vipond took five wickets in each Waikato innings. At the time, most pitches in Northland were of concrete covered with matting, and Northland players found it difficult to adapt to turf pitches. There was a push to develop more turf pitches after World War Two. Northland’s first match with a touring international team, against Fiji in February 1948, was held at the Whangarei Boys' High School ground, which had a turf pitch. The match was drawn after Fiji failed by two runs to score the required 61 runs to win in seven overs. The North Auckland Cricket Association was renamed the Northland Cricket Association in 1947.\nNorthland won the Hawke Cup for the first time in January 1956 when, captained by Ellis Child, they defeated Hutt Valley by 90 runs in Lower Hutt. They successfully defended the title later that season against Southern Hawke's Bay at the High School and against Marlborough at Cobham Oval (when Len Wyatt scored 74 and 104), but lost to Waikato at the High School in the first match in 1956–57.\nNorthern Districts, of which Northland is one of the constituent associations, began playing in the Plunket Shield in 1956–57. The first Northland player to represent Northern Districts in the Plunket Shield was Len Wyatt, who played in four matches in 1956–57. When Northern Districts won the Plunket Shield for the first time in 1962–63, Northland's Brian Dunning played in every match. \nNorthland won the Hawke Cup for a second time in 1982–83. They have held it seven times in all, most recently between March 2003 and February 2004, when they played their home matches at Kensington Park in Whangarei. When Cobham Oval, Northland's home ground, was sold in the early 2000s, the Northland Cricket Association developed a new ground about 300 metres to the south, also called Cobham Oval. It has been in use for domestic first-class and international matches since 2009.\nNorthland also compete in the Fergus Hickey Rosebowl, the competition of two-day matches among the six constituent associations of Northern Districts, and the Brian Dunning Cup, the 50-over competition."

Curtis Strange won his second consecutive U.S. Open, one stroke ahead of runners-up Chip Beck, Mark McCumber, and Ian Woosnam, becoming the first successful defender of a U.S. Open title since Ben Hogan in 1951. Strange became the sixth player to defend the U.S. Open title. This was the last of his 17 wins on the PGA Tour.\nHeavy rains before the tournament allowed for some low scores in the early rounds, with a record 38 under-par rounds in the first two rounds. During the second round, four players (Jerry Pate, Nick Price, Doug Weaver, and Mark Wiebe) recorded holes-in-one at the downhill 6th hole, the most hole-in-ones in U.S. Open history. All four hit a 7-iron past the flag, taking advantage of the damp conditions. The rest of the field had thirty birdies at the hole during the second round.\nGary Player, the 1965 champion and winner of nine major titles, played in his final U.S. Open in 1989. He shot 78-69=147 and missed the cut by two strokes.\nThis was the third U.S. Open and the fourth major at the East Course. Previous U.S. Opens were in 1956 (Cary Middlecoff) and 1968 (Lee Trevino), and the PGA Championship in 1980 (Jack Nicklaus).

Instead of pairs, the players went off on split tees in groupings of three, a first at the U.S. Open. A 73 (+3) in the third round dropped Strange to three back of Tom Kite, whose first three rounds were in the 60s.\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, June 18, 1989\"\nKite led by three after four holes in the final round, but a triple bogey at the 5th hole and bogeys at 8 and 10 dropped him a stroke back of Strange. Double bogeys at 13 and 15 dropped him from contention. Kite recorded a 78 (+8) and finished in ninth place. Strange played steadily in the penultimate pairing, with fifteen consecutive pars until a birdie at the 16th, his first since the second round.

Strange rebounded with a birdie on 13 and took a commanding three-shot lead when Faldo bogeyed.

Raymond Floyd won his fourth and final major, two strokes ahead of runners-up Chip Beck and Lanny Wadkins. It was Floyd's only U.S. Open title and he became its oldest winner, a record he held for four years.\nThe opening round on Thursday had high winds with occasional heavy rain; the best score was Bob Tway's even-par 70, with Greg Norman a stroke behind. Norman led after 36 holes, and took the lead into the final round, a stroke ahead of Lee Trevino and Hal Sutton, but a 75 dropped him back six strokes to twelfth place. Norman led each of the four major championships in 1986 after 54 holes, but won just once, at the British Open.\nDuring the final round, ten players either led or shared the lead; after Floyd birdied the par-3 11th, he was part of a nine-way tie for first. Floyd began the round three strokes back and separated himself from the pack with a bogey-free 66. After the birdie at 11, he saved par at 12, then recorded another birdie at 13 to tie for the lead. Floyd took sole possession of the lead after the 14th, then added another birdie at the 16th. After finishing his round, he was two strokes ahead of his closest pursuers: Wadkins and Beck both shot 65 to climb the leaderboard and shared second place. They tied the course record, set earlier in the day by Mark Calcavecchia.\nWith the win, Floyd became the oldest winner of the U.S. Open at , surpassing the long-standing record of Ted Ray from 1920 by several months (Julius Boros was also 43 in 1963). It was Floyd's fourth and final major championship, and he only won twice more in his career. At age 46, Masters champion Jack Nicklaus overcame an opening round 77 and tied for eighth, his last top-ten finish at the U.S. Open. Hale Irwin won his third U.S. Open at age 45 in 1990 in a playoff and remains the oldest champion; in 1986, he was the only former champion in the field to miss the cut. Boros remained the oldest winner of a modern major at age 48 at the PGA Championship in 1968, until Phil Mickelson broke the record to become the oldest winner of a major at age 50 at the PGA Championship in 2021.\nEntering this championship, Floyd had played in 21 U.S. Opens and had only two finishes in the top ten. His best result was a tie for sixth in 1965; he finished eighth in 1971, fifteen years earlier. His winner's share in 1986 was more than double his previous career earnings at the U.S. Open.\nIt was the second U.S. Open at Shinnecock Hills, which previously hosted 90 years earlier in 1896.

        "text": "The 1985 U.S. Open was the 85th U.S. Open, held June 13–16 at the South Course of Oakland Hills Country Club in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, a suburb northwest of Detroit. Andy North, the 1978 champion, won his second U.S. Open title by a stroke over runners-up Dave Barr, Chen Tze-chung, and Denis Watson.\nChen had a historic beginning to the U.S. Open. In his first three rounds, he established a new course record at Oakland Hills with a 65, made the first double eagle in U.S. Open history, and established both 36 and 54-hole scoring records. Heading into the final round, he owned a two-stroke advantage over North, who shot 65 in the second round and 70 in the third. Chen increased his lead over North to four shots after just four holes of play. But at the 5th hole, disaster struck for Chen as he saw his lead dissolve in unique fashion. His approach shot from the fairway found deep rough well short and right of the green. His first chip shot stopped several yards short of the green. Hitting his fourth shot, and still in the deep rough, Chen's wedge got tangled up in the grass upon impact and struck the ball a second time on the follow-thru, sending the ball careening short of the green. Chen was assessed the stroke and a penalty. Now lying five, he chipped on and two-putted for a quadruple bogey 8. He had seen a four-stroke lead vanish in one hole and was now tied with playing partner North.\nUnnerved by the mistake, Chen proceeded to bogey the next three holes, and North took a one-stroke lead over Barr at the turn. Chen recovered with a birdie at 12, and with North bogeying 9, 10, and 11, he found himself back in the lead. North, however, would be the last man standing. He birdied 13 while Chen bogeyed 14 and 17, and Barr bogeyed his final two holes. At the 18th, Chen narrowly missed a bunker shot to miss a chance at forcing a playoff, and both Barr and Chen finished at 280. North could protect his lead and two-putted for bogey and a one-stroke victory.\nPenalties played an additional role in the 1985 U.S. Open, as Denis Watson of Zimbabwe, who also finished 1-stroke behind North, had been assessed a two-stroke penalty in the first-round for taking too long over a putt, as USGA rules allowed a 10-second wait for a ball resting on the cup edge, and an official ruled he took 35-seconds and assessed the penalty. The rules to assess penalties on both Chen and Watson have since been changed.\nIn the final round, North hit only four fairways and recorded just one birdie. For the tournament, he had just nine birdies, the lowest by a champion in post-World War II U.S. Open history. North finished at 279 (−1), the only player to finish under par. It was his first PGA Tour win since the 1978 U.S. Open, and was his last on tour.\nJack Nicklaus shot 149 (+9) and missed the cut by three strokes, ending a streak of 21 consecutive cuts made at the U.S. Open.\nThis was the seventh major championship at the South Course, which previously hosted the U.S. Open in 1924, 1937, 1951, and 1961, and the PGA Championship in 1972 and 1979.

Larry Nelson won the second of his three major titles, and only U.S. Open, one stroke ahead of defending champion Tom Watson.\nWatson and Seve Ballesteros shared the 54-hole lead, with Nelson a stroke back. Nelson was 7-over for the championship after four holes in his third round, but then played the final fourteen holes on Saturday in 7-under to get to even-par 213, one shot behind the co-leaders. Watson was attempting to become the first to successfully defend a U.S. Open title in over thirty years, last achieved by Ben Hogan in 1951.\nIn the final round, Watson opened with a front-nine 31 to open up a three-stroke lead over Nelson, who shot 33. Nelson tied Watson with a birdie at 14 after Watson had bogeyed 10 and 12. A storm came through Oakmont around 5:30 p.m., which postponed play to the following morning. Watson was on the 14th green, Nelson on the 16th tee, tied at four-under for the championship.\nOn Monday morning, Nelson holed a birdie putt at the par-3 16th, but then three-putted at the 18th for bogey. Nelson finished at four-under 280 total and waited for Watson. After he failed to save a par from a bunker at the 17th, Watson was one stroke behind Nelson. Watson needed a birdie at 18 to tie but his approach flew over the green. Nelson became the winner when Watson failed to hole out his chip shot.\nNelson established a new tournament record with 132 strokes over the last 36 holes, breaking Gene Sarazen's 51-year-old mark. It was the second consecutive runner-up finish at Oakmont for Watson, who lost a sudden-death playoff to John Mahaffey five years earlier at the PGA Championship in 1978.\nArnold Palmer made his last cut in a U.S. Open here and tied for 60th place. He played the Open just once more, in 1994 when he was granted a special exemption when it returned to Oakmont. Future major champion Paul Azinger made his major championship debut but missed the cut. Johnny Miller, the champion when the Open was last played at Oakmont in 1973, battled health issues, and also missed the cut.\nThis was the sixth U.S. Open at Oakmont, and ninth major championship.

        "text": "The 1981 U.S. Open was the 81st U.S. Open, held June 18–21 at the East Course of Merion Golf Club in Ardmore, Pennsylvania, a suburb northwest of Philadelphia. David Graham won his second major title and became the first Australian to win the U.S. Open, three strokes ahead of runners-up George Burns and Bill Rogers.\nAfter a first round 66, Jim Thorpe made history as the first African-American since 1896 to lead the U.S. Open. Burns took a one-stroke lead over Graham with a 66 in the second round, then increased his lead to three strokes after 54 holes.\nIn the final round on Sunday, Graham shot one of the most precise rounds in U.S. Open history. He hit nearly every green in regulation, missed just one fairway, and recorded four birdies, missing several other opportunities from within . The only bogey was a three-putt at the fifth, after his approach shot stopped above the hole. After a string of eight pars, Graham finally passed Burns with birdies at the 14th and 15th holes. Graham carded a 67 to Burns' 73 to win by three strokes. Rogers shot 69 to tie Burns for 2nd and won the British Open four weeks later.\nThis was the fourth U.S. Open played at Merion, all at its East Course. Previous editions were hosted in 1934, 1950, and 1971. At , the same length as 1971, it was the shortest U.S. Open course since 1947. With heavy rains softening the course before the tournament, 93 rounds of par 70 or better were recorded. Fifteen players were under par after 36 holes, but only five finished under par for the four rounds. Five more were at even par 280, including defending champion Jack Nicklaus, a four-time winner.\nAfter 1981, the U.S. Open was not played at Merion until 2013.\nCourse layout.\nEast Course \nLengths of the course for previous U.S. Opens:\nRound summaries.\nFirst round.\n\"Thursday, June 18, 1981\"\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, June 19, 1981\"\nAmateurs: \"Rassett (E)\", Cooksey (+6), Norton (+8), Pavin (+9), DeFrancesco (+10), White (+10), Sindelar (+11), Faxon (+12), Lawrence (+14), Sanchez (+14), Moore (+15), Mudd (+15), Yokoi (+15), Biancalana (+16), Jones (+16), Ludwig (+16), Magee (+17), Hurter (+21), Brodie (+22).\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, June 20, 1981\"\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, June 21, 1981\"\nAmateur: Rassett (+14).\nScorecard.\n\"Final round\"\n\"Cumulative playoff scores, relative to par\""

Jack Nicklaus set a new tournament scoring record to win his fourth U.S. Open title, two strokes ahead of runner-up Isao Aoki; in fact, as the tournament transpired these two golfers ended up playing all four rounds together.\nNicklaus and Tom Weiskopf began the tournament by shooting a record-tying 63 in the first round on the Lower Course on Thursday. Weiskopf, however, did not shoot better than 75 in any other round and finished 37th. After a second round 71, Nicklaus owned a two-stroke lead over Isao Aoki. Aoki, however, carded a third consecutive round of 68 in the third to tie Nicklaus.\nIn the final round on Sunday, Nicklaus birdied the 3rd after Aoki recorded a bogey on 2, taking a two-shot lead. Nicklaus, however, could not separate himself from his challenger. After he hit his approach to 3 feet on 10, Aoki made a long putt from the fringe for a birdie. On the 17th Nicklaus holed a 22-footer for birdie while Aoki made his own 5-footer for birdie. And at the 18th Nicklaus rolled in another birdie from 10-feet to win the championship, his sixteenth major title as a professional.\nNicklaus' winning total of 272 established a new U.S. Open standard, breaking the record 275 he set in 1967 on the same Lower Course. He also tied Willie Anderson, Bobby Jones, and Ben Hogan by winning his fourth U.S. Open title. Nicklaus had failed to win a tournament in 1979 for the first time in his career, and at 40 many believed his best days were behind him. He won four more times on the PGA Tour with two majors, including the PGA Championship two months later and the Masters in 1986.\nSeve Ballesteros, the reigning champion of the British Open and Masters, was late to the course on Friday, missed his tee time, and was disqualified; he had carded a 75 on Thursday.\nThe U.S. Open returned to the Lower Course in 1993, and the PGA Championship was played there in 2005 and in 2016.\nCourse layout.\nLower Course\nLengths of the course for previous major championships:\nRound summaries.\nFirst round.\n\"Thursday, June 12, 1980\"\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, June 13, 1980\"\nAmateurs: \"Hallberg (+2), Clampett (+6)\", Sigel (+7), Sindelar (+7), Wagner (+9), Wood (+10), Blake (+11), Sutton (+11), Rassett (+13), Sluman (+15), Clearwater (+16), Mudd (+16), Norton (+16), O'Meara (+16), Bergin (+17), Landers (+20), Chalas (+21), Glickley (+22).\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, June 14, 1980\"\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, June 15, 1980\"\nAmateurs: Gary Hallberg (+5), Bobby Clampett (+10).\nScorecard.\n\"Final round\"\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\"&lt;br&gt;"

        "title": "Cricket in Bangladesh",
        "text": "Cricket is the most popular dry season sport in Bangladesh. It is played nationwide through the months of November to May. Governance of the sport is the responsibility of the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB), which was established in 1972.\nBangladesh is a full member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the Asian Cricket Council. Full ICC membership was achieved in 2000 and the Bangladesh men's team played its inaugural Test match that year. The national team is known as the \"Tigers\" – after the Royal Bengal Tiger. The women's national team has played top-level international cricket since 2014.\nBangladesh has three nationwide domestic competitions. The most lucrative is the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL), a Twenty20 tournament played in January and February which attracts international players from other countries. There are two first-class championships: the National Cricket League, played by teams representing the country's administrative divisions; and the Bangladesh Cricket League, played by zonal teams.\nHistory.\nCricket was introduced to Bengal by the British in the eighteenth century. Following Partition and the creation of East Pakistan, both first-class and Test cricket were played there during the 1950s and 1960s. The sport continued to be popular after independence, especially in Dhaka, but the country lost first-class status and had to establish itself in international competition as an Associate Member of the International Cricket Council (ICC).\nProgress was made in the 1990s. The Bangladesh men's team won the 1997 ICC Trophy and made a good showing at the 1999 Cricket World Cup. Beginning in 1994, Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) in preparation for full membership of the ICC, began instituting multi-day matches in domestic tournaments starting with the 1993-94 National Cricket Championship (with the semi-finals and final being two-day matches each of a single innings per team 60 and 80 overs respectively) and then continuing again (after a return to the traditional one day formats in 1995 and 1996) for the 1997, 1998/99 and 1999 National Cricket Championships with teams playing multiple innings over 3 days for the semi-finals and 4 days for the final. Also only for the 1998/99 season of Dhaka Premier Division Cricket League the BCB introduced two-day matches of 80 overs per side. In the 1999–2000 season, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) in the final push for full membership, created the National Cricket League (NCL). In November 2000, Bangladesh played their inaugural Test match against India at the Bangabandhu National Stadium in Dhaka. The NCL was granted first-class status ahead of the 2000–01 season.\nInternational cricket.\nTest cricket.\nThe Bangladesh national cricket team, known as \"The Tigers\", is the national cricket team of Bangladesh. Bangladesh became a full member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2000 and played their first Test match that year against India in Dhaka, becoming the tenth Test cricket playing nation. They also take part in officially sanctioned ACC tournaments including the Asian Test Championship.\nOne Day Internationals.\n\"placeholder – to be completed\"\nTwenty20 Internationals.\n\"placeholder – to be completed\"\nWomen's international cricket.\nBangladesh has an active women's team which gained One Day International status after finishing 5th at the 2011 Women's Cricket World Cup Qualifier. The women's team also claimed the silver medal at the 2010 Asian Games cricket tournament and won the 2018 Women's Asia Cup.\nDomestic cricket.\nFirst-class cricket.\nNational Cricket League.\nSoon after the establishment of the BCB, a cricket league commenced in Dhaka and Chittagong at district (regional) level. It became a national tournament in 1974–75. Other tournaments were organised at school, college, youth and university levels.\nThe National Cricket League was founded in the 1999–2000 season ahead of Bangladesh being promoted to full membership of the ICC. It became a first-class competition in 2000–01. It involves eight teams, seven representing administrative divisions and one from the Dhaka Metropolis. There are eight administrative divisions but Mymensingh is not represented. Since the 2015–16 season, the league has been split into two tiers with promotion and relegation. In the 2022–23 tournament, won by Rangpur Division, the structure was as follows:\nA team sponsored by Biman Bangladesh Airlines played in the 2000–01 season and won the NCL title. That was their only appearance. Since then, the most successful teams (see table above) have been Khulna, Rajshahi and Dhaka Division.\nBangladesh Cricket League.\nA second first-class tournament, the Bangladesh Cricket League, was launched in 2012. This has a similar concept to India's Duleep Trophy as the contestants are zonal teams: Central, South, East and North Zones. The most successful team has been South Zone with five league titles between 2014 and 2020.\nPerformances.\nThere have been numerous instances of batters scoring 1,000 first-class runs in a Bangladeshi season. The highest aggregate to date is 1,249 by Tushar Imran of Khulna in the 2016–17 season. His average was 89.21 runs per completed innings. Many bowlers have taken 50 wickets in a season and the highest aggregate to date is 68 by Abdur Razzak, also of Khulna, in the 2017–18 season. Razzak has been the country's leading wicket-taker in four seasons between 2014–15 and 2019–20.\nTwenty20 cricket.\nIn 2010, the NCL T20 was launched. This was a Twenty20 tournament which was dropped after its first and only season and was replaced by the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) in 2012. The BPL is a Twenty20 league with seven franchises based on the concept of the Indian Premier League and has attracted many international players. Rajshahi Rangers won the NCL T20. Comilla Victorians have been the most successful BPL team to date with three titles.\nOne-day cricket.\nThe National Cricket League One-Day tournament began in 2000–01 as Bangladesh's principal domestic limited overs cricket competition. It was terminated in 2011 and has since been superseded by the Dhaka Premier Division Cricket League, which gained List A status in 2013. Rajshahi Division were the most successful team in the NCL One-Day with three titles. In the Dhaka competition, Abahani Limited have won the title three times to 2022.\nWomen's cricket.\nIn March 2023, the BCB launched an annual first-class cricket competition for women named Bangladesh Women's Cricket League, with three teams competing.\nClub Cricket.\n\"placeholder – to be completed\"\nInternational grounds.\n\"Updated: 7 February 2021\"\n\"Listed in order of match first used for international match\"\nIn Bangladeshi culture.\nCricket holds a significant position in the culture of Bangladesh.

        "text": "Scott Campbell (born 25 September 1984) is a retired Minor League Baseball infielder. In , he was selected 300th overall by the Toronto Blue Jays. He retired on 15 March 2012 due to recurring injury problems in his hip.\nHe played college baseball at Gonzaga University. In 2007, Campbell played for the class-A affiliate of the Blue Jays, the Lansing Lugnuts. In 2007, he showed some promise as a hitter, hitting .279/.390/.397. However, he was not considered a top prospect of the Jays given his age and the level where he played. In 2008, Campbell had a breakout year, increasing his batting average to .341 and his OBP to .435 while moving up two levels to AA. He was chosen to represent the World team at the 2008 All-Star Futures Game. Given his reputation as a solid defensive second baseman, Campbell was once widely considered one of the better prospects in the Toronto Blue Jays minor league system, and had been compared to Chase Utley by Blue Jays General Manager J.P. Ricciardi.\nEarly career.\nHigh school.\nCampbell got started on the sport when he was 9 after his mother signed him up after seeing an advertisement in a local newspaper and a year later was inspired to play baseball further after attending the World Children's Baseball Fair in Japan. He attended Macleans College in Auckland, there was no high school baseball in New Zealand so he played three years of football (or soccer) at Macleans as a member of New Zealand Olympic Youth Development Program for baseball in New Zealand and played for the New Zealand national baseball team while at high school.\nCentral Arizona Community College.\nDuring his freshman year in 2004 he played at Central Arizona Community College, hitting .423 with 34 runs scored and 10 stolen bases. He earned his first-team All-Region I and National Junior College All American honors while leading the team to the Region I championship and runner-up finish at Western District championships.\nDuring his sophomore year in 2005 he transferred to Gonzaga University, a private Catholic Jesuit university located in Spokane, Washington, United States. He played and started in all 54 games, posted a team-leading .332 batting average, while also tying for the team-lead with 70 hits, had 10 doubles, one triple, one home run and 30 RBI and posted 17 multi-hit games including a 4-for-5, two RBI and one double performance against Oklahoma in the Coca-Cola Spring Training Tournament.\nProfessional career.\nIn 2006, Campbell was drafted in the 10th round of the 2006 Major League Baseball draft by the Toronto Blue Jays as the 300th pick overall and signed a seven-year contract with the club. Campbell started his professional career playing in the New York–Penn League for the rest of 2006 with the Auburn Doubledays where he had a successful season, batting at .292 in 68 appearances.\nThe following year, Scott was promoted to class A in the Midwest League playing with the Lansing Lugnuts, but failed to be listed as an official top prospect during the season despite finishing the season batting at a respectable .279, having an on-base percentage of .390 and making the New York–Penn League all-star squad where he walked in two appearances.\nCampbell continued to rise through the ranks, being promoted two levels to AA for where he played 112 games with the New Hampshire Fisher Cats as their starting second baseman. The year would prove to be a very successful one for Scott as he batted at a .302/.398/.427 clip and was selected in the World team for the 2008 All-Star Futures Game and the 2008 Eastern League all-star team.\n2009 gave Campbell a taste of AAA where he played 27 games for the Las Vegas 51s towards the twilight of the season. He played the majority of his games in AA, where he batted .269."

        "text": "Elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame for 1953 followed a radically new procedure. The institution appointed its Committee on Baseball Veterans, the famous \"Veterans Committee\", to meet in person and consider pioneers and executives, managers, umpires, and earlier major league players. Committees in the 1930s and 1940s had chosen several pioneers and executives, but this was the first direction of anyone's attention to field personnel other than players, the managers and umpires.\nThe first Veterans Committee met in closed sessions and elected six people: Ed Barrow, Chief Bender, Tommy Connolly, Bill Klem, Bobby Wallace, and Harry Wright. The Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) voted by mail, per usual, to select from recent players and elected two, Dizzy Dean and Al Simmons. A formal induction ceremony was held in Cooperstown, New York, on July 27, 1953, with Commissioner of Baseball Ford Frick in attendance.\nBBWAA election.\nThe 10-year members of the BBWAA had the authority to select any players active in 1928 or later, provided they had not been active in 1952. Voters were instructed to cast votes for 10 candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall.\nA total of 264 ballots were cast in the Baseball Writers Election, with 2,525 individual votes for 83 specific candidates, an average of 9.56 per ballot; 198 votes were required for election. The two candidates who received at least 75% of the vote and were elected are indicated in bold italics; those candidates who were selected in subsequent elections are indicated in \"italics\".\nThe rules at the time indicated that players were eligible if they had been out of baseball for at least one season, so this was Joe DiMaggio's first season of eligibility, as he had retired after the 1951 season.\nVeterans Committee.\nBy 1953, the Old-Timers Committee had not met for seven years (1946), and had only elected two players by mail, Mordecai Brown and Kid Nichols. They had not elected any non-players since the mass induction of 1945, and no players whose careers had begun before 1890 since the election of 1946.\nIn response to this and the Old-Timers Committee members' increasing ages, a new \"Committee on Baseball Veterans\" (commonly known as the Veterans Committee) was created, consisting of:\nThe first Veterans Committee met in closed sessions and elected six people: Ed Barrow, Chief Bender, Tommy Connolly, Bill Klem, Bobby Wallace, and Harry Wright. Afterwards, the Veterans Committee was limited to two selections per meeting. It was also decided in 1953 that the new Veterans Committee would meet only in odd-numbered years. On July 22, 1956, it was decided that the BBWAA would vote only in even-numbered years.\nOf the 11 members of the Veterans Committee, Charlie Gehringer had already been inducted in the Hall as a player in 1949; Branch Rickey would be inducted as an executive/pioneer in 1967, Will Harridge would be inducted as an executive in 1972, and Warren Giles would be inducted as an executive in 1979. Additionally, J. G. Taylor Spink (1962), Frank Graham (1971) and Warren Brown (1973) would be honored with the J. G. Taylor Spink Award."

        "title": "Chess World Cup",
        "text": "The FIDE World Cup is a major chess event organized by FIDE, the international governing body. Three different formats have been used:\nSimilarly named tournaments.\nBefore FIDE introduced the Chess World Cup, the breakaway Grandmasters Association (GMA) organised six tournaments in 1988–1989 which they termed the 'GMA World Cup'. Participants were high-ranking grandmasters; each round was a large round robin termed a 'Grand Prix'. They were considered the flagship tournaments of the GMA but were abandoned as the association gradually collapsed in the early 1990s.\nFIDE World Cup (2000–2002).\nIn 2000 and 2002 FIDE, the International Chess Federation, staged their \"First Chess World Cup\" and \"Second Chess World Cup\" respectively. These were major tournaments, but not directly linked to the World Chess Championship. Both the 2000 and 2002 events were won by Viswanathan Anand of India.\nWinners.\nBoth tournaments began with a round-robin stage, consisting of four groups of six players each. The top two players from each group were subsequently seeded into an eight-player single-elimination bracket.\nFIDE World Cup (2005–present).\nSince 2005, a different event of the same name has been part of the World Chess Championship cycle. This event is being held every two years. It is a 128-player knockout tournament, in the same style as the Tilburg tournament between 1992 and 1994, or the 1998, 1999, 2000, 2002 and 2004 FIDE World Championships.\nThe event was held in 2005, 2007, 2009, and 2011 in Khanty-Mansiysk, and subsequently FIDE has given preference to bids for the Olympiad that also contain a bid for the preceding World Cup. During the 2015 finals of the World Cup, the main organizer commented \"We received the right to host the Olympiad and then we were given an additional event – the World Cup.\"\nThe Chess World Cup 2005 qualified ten players for the Candidates Tournament for the World Chess Championship 2007. Since then, every World Cup has qualified between one and three players for the Candidates Tournament.\nTwo World Cup qualifiers (Boris Gelfand in 2009 and Sergey Karjakin in 2015) won the subsequent Candidates tournament and played in the World Championship match, in 2012 and 2016 respectively.\nFormat.\nSince 2005, the format has been 128 players with 7 single-elimination rounds of \"mini-matches\", which are 2 games each followed by a series of rapid then blitz tiebreaks if necessary. The final usually has 4 games before the tiebreaks start. Since 2015, an extra rest day has recently been added before the semi-finals, in addition to before the final.\nSome criticism has been leveled at the scheduling effects, with the event being rather long (26 days), particularly with almost all of the players having left long before the end. Fatigue thus plays a critical role, and while some players seek to conserve energy by avoiding tiebreaks, others \"agree\" (either explicitly or implicitly) to make short draws in the 2 long games and decide the winner in tiebreaks. It is often remarked that the system is mostly a lottery of who survives, though better players have more chances on the whole. The anticlimax of the 4-round final, with both players now already qualified for the Candidates, has also been criticized.\nWinners.\n\"Qual\" refers to the number of players who qualify for the Candidates Tournament (marked with green background). For example, in 2015, the top 2 finishers qualified for the 2016 Candidates Tournament. In 2021, Sergey Karjakin qualified for the 2022 Candidates Tournament via the World Cup, but was subsequently disqualified for making statements in support of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In 2023, only the top three players were meant to qualify, but Magnus Carlsen declined to participate in the Candidates; thus the fourth place, Nijat Abasov, qualified as well.\nAll tournaments since 2005 were played in single-elimination format, as seen in the format section above."

        "title": "Romford and Gidea Park Rugby Club",
        "text": "Romford and Gidea Park Rugby Club is a rugby union club in Romford, east London, England. They currently play in London &amp; SE Division, Counties 1 Essex - a league at the seventh tier of the English rugby union system.\nA Brief history.\nLike nomads, rugby players in Romford have been on the move since their first match in 1929. It was not until September, 1983 that the club were able to 'touch down' at a base that they could properly call home, following the purchase of a site in Crow Lane.\nIn 1929, the founder members, Leslie Diebel and Jimmy Paxton, placed an advert in the local newspaper inviting anyone interested in playing rugby to attend a meeting in the Ship Inn in Gidea Park. Following this meeting, \"The Ship\" became the first headquarters of the Gidea Park Rugby Club. The first match was played against Chingford, but the result has long since been forgotten in the mist of time. In those early days, the club used a sports ground at Gallows Corner in Gidea Park for their home matches.\nWith no rugby during the Second World War, the club was reformed in 1946, moving in 1949 to play home matches at Raphael's Park. It was then that the now familiar colours of black, purple and white were adopted from the crest of Lord Raphael.\nIn 1953, the club moved again - this time to Cottons Park. The players built their own clubhouse and as the club's popularity increased, so did the clubhouse! As befitting its new location, Romford was added to the club's name - \"Gidea Park and Romford RFC\". Two years later, this appellation was changed to the present \"Romford and Gidea Park RFC\". With Ralph Klar MC as the driving force, another small extension was added. In 1961, Ralph was elected as the club's first life member.\nDuring the 1960s and 70s, the club flourished and was the welcome recipient of a healthy influx of Welsh schoolteachers, including Romford legends like Glyn Johns (an inspiring and uncompromising prop forward) and Lynn Herbert (a product of the Welsh fly-half factory). Indeed, at one time, the first XV boasted a total of 14 Welsh regulars, along with their captain Alec Daly - A Scot!\nIn the 1970s, the club regularly fielded 5 senior sides and, with the increasing popularity of junior and mini rugby, the clubhouse and playing facilities were outgrown. So the search was on to find yet another home. In 1981, with Pat Ridley (a much revered club character and Club President 1975–85) to the fore, the club negotiated the purchase of their present home within easy access of Romford centre. After two years hard work and fundraising, of land were converted into four pitches and a purpose built clubhouse with changing accommodation was constructed.\nThe club continued to thrive. Former youth Scrum half Dave Duffus returned from Hong Kong, where he had played for the colony in their Hong Kong Sevens, to skipper the club for, at the time, a record 5 seasons. Other notable captains included Maurice Washbourne, who later became a successful Club Chairman during the 1990s, and the Scottish trialist Mike Lovatt.\nAnother important development was the installation of floodlights on the main pitch, which then enabled the club to start hosting county finals.\nRecent seasons have seen the senior sides to strive to match the developments and success of a youth and mini section. Different teams have won a number of county leagues and cup finals. Numerous tours have been undertaken both at home and abroad including trips to France, Italy and South Africa.\nThere have been some fine individual achievements. In 1988 Ian \"Paddy\" Dunston was selected for the England Colts and gained the distinction of being the club's first international. In 1997 Terry Ellis played for England Schools U16s. The 2004 season saw Jon Mason represent England 18 Group v France Ireland and Wales, while Frank Neale was selected for England Colleges. Adam Powell was also fast-tracked into the U19 England squad and played in their Grand Slam Six Nations programme and also played in the U19 World Cup in South Africa where England finished fourth. \n2002 bought another milestone to the club when club stalwart Dai Davies was elected County president. During his two-year presidency, Essex became independent of Eastern Counties and gained their own Constituent Body Status of the RFU. Dai has now taken over the Presidency from the long serving Ron Johnson for the start of the 2005/06 season.\nThe 2003-04 season saw the club establish a Ladies XV – the “Romford Ravens”. The team developed well and, in 2013 they were successful in winning a National Challenge Cup, a title they were able to retain the following season. The Ravens continue to play a prominent role in the life of the club.\nThe club has seen two major refurbishments. In 2009, an ambitious extension doubled the size of the clubhouse, adding a function room, shop, extra changing accommodation and treatment room. This improved facility was opened by RFU President Brian Williams, along with Jason Leonard who opened the new Ron Johnson Room in memory of the former club president. In 2020, with planning permission finally granted to sell two unused parcels of land for a housing development, the club were now able to pay off any existing loans. The profits were used to fund the laying of tarmac for the long-awaited improved car park, the provision of a modern catering facility and a general facelift to the clubhouse buildings.\nRecent seasons have seen the senior side fluctuate between levels 6 and 7 of the RFU league pyramid. During this time, Micky James completed a remarkable ten seasons of club captaincy between 2009-19. As with many clubs, the club is now focused on recruitment and the retention of its playing membership in the aftermath of Covid-19, along with facing the challenges posed by the modern game, work-life balance and competition from other leisure activities.\nClub Honours.\nEssex 7’s winners 1984-85. 1993-94.\nEssex Colts Cup Winners 1992-93 and 1994-95.\nRavens-National cup winners 2013 &amp; 2014"

        "text": "The 2006 NCAA Division I women's volleyball tournament began on November 30, 2006, with 64 teams and concluded on December 16, 2006, when top ranked Nebraska defeated second ranked Stanford 3 sets to 1 in Omaha, Nebraska for the program's third NCAA title.\nAt the time, the 17,209 national championship match attendance was the highest attended volleyball match ever in the United States. The record was later broken during the 2008 NCAA Semifinals, also held at the Qwest Center.\nRecords.\nThirty-one conferences had an automatic berth to the 2006 NCAA Tournament, and the other 33 spots were filled by at-large bids. The Big Ten, Big 12, and Pac-10 were well-represented as usual, as teams from these conferences made up the top 8 seeds.\nGainesville Regional.\nUpsets.\nIn the Gainesville region, no seed was a victim of an upset, although some were very close to doing so. In the first round, unseeded American put a scare into top seeded Nebraska by taking game 3 from them, but Nebraska responded by winning the fourth game, 30–16. In the second round, unseeded St. John's took 8th seeded Minnesota to 5 games, losing the 5th, 15–12. As expected, Nebraska and Minnesota reached the regional finals, and Minnesota almost pulled off the biggest upset of the tournament by winning the first two games. Top seeded Nebraska rallied back from the 0–2 deficit and won the fifth game, 15–9. Nebraska sophomore Jordan Larson was named the regional's most outstanding player, as she tallied a career high 21 kills in the dramatic comeback win.\nThis marked the first time in Nebraska's history that they won a regional final outside of the state of Nebraska. Nebraska advanced in hopes of making up for their 2005 national championship loss to Washington.\nHonolulu Regional.\nUpsets.\nEach expected team, Hawai'i, UCLA, Southern California and Oklahoma reached the regional semifinals, and as expected, UCLA defeated Oklahoma. The other semifinal was a different story, as 12th seeded Hawai'i pulled off the biggest upset of the regional by defeating Southern California in 5 games, 28–30, 30–21, 21–30, 30–27, 15–5 in front of a partisan Hawai'i crowd. Hawai'i could not continue the upsets however, against overall number 4 seed UCLA in the regional finals. UCLA advanced to their first final four since 1994.\nSeattle Regional.\nUpsets.\nMuch like the previous two regionals, each seeded team reached the Sweet 16 as expected. Penn State swept past Big Ten foe Purdue, while host Washington swept past Ohio State. Perhaps the biggest upset of the tournament occurred in the regional final, when defending champion Washington defeated third seed Penn State on UW's home floor in front of 6,000 fans. The win improved the Huskies to 12–0 at home in postseason play. Washington advanced to their third consecutive final four in hopes of defending their 2005 national title.\nAustin Regional.\nUpsets.\nThe Austin regional saw no major upsets. In sub-regional final action, California upset #15 seed Cal Poly to become the only unseeded team to make the Sweet 16 and unseeded Missouri gave #2 seed Stanford a scare by pushing them to five games.\nNational Semifinal recap.\nNebraska vs. UCLA.\nThe first semifinal began on December 14, 2006. Top seeded Nebraska was playing in front of an NCAA record 17,013 Husker fans in Omaha. Nebraska dropped the first game, 23–30, but rallied to win the next three. AVCA National Player of the Year Sarah Pavan served 10 straight points in one of the games and had 22 kills in the match. The loss ended UCLA's bid to win their first NCAA title since 1991, but it was still a successful season as AVCA National Coach of the Year Andy Banachowski guided the 2006 squad to its first 30-win season since 1994.\nStanford vs. Washington.\nIn the second semifinal, second seeded Stanford completely dominated the match, knocking out defending national champion Washington. As a team, Washington hit .000% compared to the Cardinal's .315. Four of six Washington players hit either negative or .000 %. The Cardinal advanced to their 12th title match in school history, in hopes of winning their 7th NCAA title.\nNational Championship recap: Nebraska vs. Stanford.\nNebraska and Stanford were the top two overall seeds and it was only the second time the top two seeds met in an NCAA Division I Women's Volleyball Championship title match.\nStanford took game 1, 30–27, thanks to a .304 hitting % compared to the Huskers' .196. Nebraska responded in game 2, defeating the Cardinal, 30–26, to send the teams into the locker room with one game won apiece.\nGame 3 was close like the first two, until the Huskers saw a 26-22 point deficit. With game 3 looking close to a Cardinal victory, behind good Husker defense, they rallied to tie the game at 28, and eventually won the game on a kill by Pavan, 30–28.\nGame 4 was once again close until the end, when the Huskers took a 27–22 lead. However, by good defense and a reversal from game 3, the Cardinal rallied to catch up. Stanford staved off two championship points and came within two at 29–27, but a kill after a Huskers' timeout by sophomore Jordan Larson ricocheted off a Stanford defender and sent the Huskers to victory and their first title since going undefeated in 2000. They also became the first school since 1991 to win the national title as the host institution. Nebraska finished the season with a 33–1 record, with their only loss coming to Big 12 opponent Colorado in a five-game upset. Nebraska became just the second team in NCAA history to stay at a number 1 ranking for the entire year."

Fifteenth-seeded Tennessee and unseeded Santa Clara upset their way into the semifinals. In the rally scoring era (since 2001), no unseeded team had ever reached the national semifinals, while Tennessee was the lowest overall seed to reach the Final Four.\nThe 2005 NCAA Tournament was the 25th anniversary of the NCAA Women's Volleyball Championship.\nOmaha Regional.\nUpsets.\nAs expected, Nebraska, UCLA, Louisville, and Florida got to the Sweet 16 round. Florida swept past Louisville and top seeded Nebraska swept past UCLA to advance to the regional finals. Nebraska defeated Florida, 30-26, 30-24, 30-16 to advance to the final four.\nStanford Regional.\nUpsets.\nMany upsets were seen in this regional. In the second round, defending national champion and fifth seeded Stanford was stunned by unseeded Santa Clara on their home floor. Then, unseeded Pepperdine defeated twelfth seeded Southern California on Southern California's home court. The upsets continued in the second round, as unseeded Ohio defeated thirteenth seeded Ohio St. on the Buckeye's home floor. The only upset not seen was 4th seeded Arizona defeating Utah, and advanced to the Sweet 16 as the only remaining seeded participant.\nSanta Clara defeated Pepperdine, 3-0, to advance to the regional finals. Arizona was nearly the victim of yet another upset, outlasting a 5-game match to Ohio. However, in the next round, Arizona was the victim of an upset, as Santa Clara defeated them, 3-2, to advance to their first final four in school history. Santa Clara won the fifth and deciding game, 17-15.\nCollege Station Regional.\nUpsets.\nNo upsets were seen up until the regional semifinals, when Wisconsin defeated 6th seeded Notre Dame in a 5-game match.\nUniversity Park Regional.\nUpsets.\nThe University Park regional ended up much like the Stanford regional in terms of upsets. In the first regional semifinal, Missouri surprised Hawai'i by defeating them, 3-1. Then, Tennessee stunned second seeded Penn State on Penn State's home floor, 3-1. Missouri and Tennessee battled in University Park, with Tennessee outlasting Missouri in four games, and much like Santa Clara in the Stanford regional who upset high seeds, advanced to their first final four in school history.\nNational Semifinal recap.\nNebraska vs. Santa Clara.\nSanta Clara's dream run came to an end, as top seeded Nebraska overpowered them, 30-24, 30-19, 30-21. Nebraska hit .449% as a team, while Santa Clara hit just .145%. Nebraska advanced to the title match, sweeping through each opponent in the process.\nWashington vs. Tennessee.\nOddly similar to the first semifinal, Tennessee's dream run came to end in another sweep with nearly identical scores to the Nebraska/Santa Clara match, by defeating them 30-25, 30-19, 30-21. Much like Nebraska, Washington swept through each opponent to earn a spot in the title match. It is the first national title attempt in school history.\nNational Championship recap: Nebraska vs. Washington.\nIn front of 9,000 fans in the Alamodome, top ranked and top seeded Nebraska battled second ranked and third seeded Washington for the national title. Nebraska was ranked number one in the coaches poll all season long, and was trying to become the second school in NCAA history to hold the top spot every week in the season, as Southern California did it in 2003. Washington is coached by Jim McLaughlin\nWashington jumped out to a quick 2-0 lead in the first game, prompting AVCA National Coach of the Year John Cook to take an early timeout. Washington dominated throughout the match, winning the first two games, 30-26, 30-25. Despite Nebraska taking an early 7-2 lead in the third game, Washington closed the gap and at 18, it was tied up. The teams remained close until the end, when Washington went on a 4-1 scoring run, and off a solo block from MVP Christal Morrison, Washington stunned Nebraska in a sweep, to claim their first ever national championship.\nWith the sweep, Washington became just the second school in NCAA history to sweep through every opponent en route to winning the NCAA title, joining Texas from 1988. It was the first time since 2002 that Nebraska had been swept.\nWashington coach McLaughlin became the first coach in NCAA history to win a national championship in both men and women's volleyball, as he guided Southern California men's team to the 1990 NCAA title. Before McLaughlin took over for the Washington program in 2001, their record was 8-19. Washington finished off the 2005 season 32-1, the only loss coming to UCLA in a five set match. Ironically, that loss was UCLA head coach Andy Banachowski’s 1,000th career win.\nNCAA Tournament records.\nThere are two NCAA tournament records that were set in the 2005 tournament that still stand."

        "title": "History of basketball",
        "text": "Basketball began with its invention in 1891 in Springfield, Massachusetts, by Canadian physical education instructor James Naismith as a less injury-prone sport than football. Naismith was a 31-year-old graduate student when he created the indoor sport to keep athletes indoors during the winters. The game became established fairly quickly and grew very popular as the 20th century progressed, first in America and then in other parts of the world. After basketball became established in American colleges, the professional game followed. The American National Basketball Association (NBA), established in 1946, grew to a multibillion-dollar enterprise by the end of the century, and basketball became an integral part of American culture.\nEarly history.\nInvention of the game.\nA game similar to basketball is mentioned in a 1591 book published in Frankfurt am Main that reports on the lifestyles and customs of coastal North American residents, \"Wahrhafftige Abconterfaytung der Wilden\".\"\" Among other things, a game of skill is described in which balls must be thrown against a target woven from twigs, mounted high on a pole in the middle of a large playing field. There's a small reward for the player if the target is being hit.\nThe game of basketball as it is known today was created by Dr. James Naismith in December 1891 in Springfield, Massachusetts, to condition young athletes during cold months. Naismith was a physical education instructor at YMCA International Training School (now known as Springfield College) in Springfield, Massachusetts. Upon the request of his boss, Naismith was tasked to create an indoor sports game to help athletes keep in shape in cold weather. It consisted of peach baskets and a soccer style ball. He published 13 rules for the new game. He divided his class of eighteen into two teams of nine players each and set about to teach them the basics of his new game. The objective of the game was to throw the basketball into the fruit baskets nailed to the lower railing of the gym balcony. Every time a point was scored, the game was halted so the janitor could bring out a ladder and retrieve the ball. After a while, the bottoms of the fruit baskets were removed.\nThe first public basketball game was played in Springfield, Massachusetts, on March 11, 1892.\nNaismith's original rules.\nThere were only thirteen rules of \"basket ball\":\nThe first basketball game.\nOn December 21, 1891, Naismith published rules for a new game using five basic ideas and thirteen rules. That day, he asked his class to play a match in the Armory Street court: 9 versus 9, using a soccer ball and two peach baskets. Frank Mahan, one of his students, wasn't so happy. He just said: \"Harrumph. Another new game\". Someone proposed to call it \"Naismith Game\", but he suggested \"We have a ball and a basket: why don’t we call it basketball?\" The eighteen players were John G. Thompson, Eugene S. Libby, Edwin P. Ruggles, William R. Chase, T. Duncan Patton, Frank Mahan, Finlay G. MacDonald, William H. Davis and Lyman Archibald, who defeated George Weller, Wilbert Carey, Ernest Hildner, Raymond Kaighn, Genzabaro Ishikawa, Benjamin S. French, Franklin Barnes, George Day and Henry Gelan 1–0. The goal was scored by Chase. There were other differences between Naismith's first idea and the game played today. The peach baskets were closed, and balls had to be retrieved manually, until a small hole was put in the bottom of the peach basket to poke the ball out using a stick. Only in 1906 were metal hoops, nets and backboards introduced. In 1894 the soccer ball was replaced by a ball Naismith contacted Spalding to make.\nWomen in basketball.\nShortly after, Senda Berenson, instructor of physical culture at the nearby Smith College, went to Naismith to learn more about the game. Fascinated by the new sport and the values it could teach, she started to organize games with her pupils, following adjusted rules. The first official women's interinstitutional game was played barely 11 months later, between the University of California and the Miss Head's School. In 1899, a committee was established at the Conference of Physical Training in Springfield to draw up general rules for women's basketball. Thus, the sport quickly spread throughout America's schools, colleges and universities with uniform rules for both sexes.\nYMCA, U.S. Army spread development.\nYMCA had a major role in spreading basketball throughout the United States, Canada, and the world. In 1893, Mel Rideout arranged the first European match in Paris, in Montmartre. At the same time, Bob Gailey went to Tianjin, China, Duncan Patton to India, Genzabaro Ishikawa to Japan, and C. Hareek to Persia.\nThe First World War broke out in 1914, and the U.S. Army started fighting in Europe in 1917. During World War I, the American Expeditionary Force took basketball wherever it went. Together with the troops, there were hundreds of physical education teachers who knew basketball. Naismith also spent two years with YMCA in France in that period.\nEarly professional leagues, teams, and organizations.\nThe first professional league was founded in 1898. Six teams took part in the National Basketball League, and the first champions were the Trenton Nationals, followed by the New York Wanderers, the Bristol Pile Drivers and the Camden Electrics. The league was abandoned in 1904. Then, many small championships were organized, but most of them were not as important as some teams who played for money against challengers.\nThe Original Celtics, for instance, are considered the \"fathers of basketball\" and were presented as \"World’s Basketball Champions\"; the players had to sign a contract to play with them, and Jim Furey organized matches as a circus, moving daily from town to town. The Celtics became the strongest team, and their successes lasted from 1922 until 1928, when the team disbanded due to ownership problems. The Original Celtics are sometimes incorrectly thought of as forebears of the current Boston Celtics of the NBA; in reality, they share only a name, as today's Celtics were not founded until 1946, nearly two decades after the demise of the Original Celtics. In 1922, the first all–African American professional team was founded: the Rens (also known as New York Renaissance or Harlem Renaissance). The Rens were the Original Celtics’ usual opponent, and for their matches a ticket cost $1. They took part in some official championships and won the first World Professional Basketball Tournament in 1939. The team disbanded in 1949.\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, Eastern Basket Ball League (founded in 1909), Metropolitan Basketball League (founded in 1921) and American Basketball League (founded in 1925) were the most important leagues.\nBasketball in American colleges.\nThe greatest level of early basketball activity outside of YMCAs was seen in American colleges. The first known U.S. college to field a basketball team against an outside opponent was Vanderbilt University, which played against the local YMCA in Nashville, Tennessee, on February 7, 1893. The second recorded instance of an organized college basketball game was Geneva College's game against the New Brighton YMCA on April 8, 1893, in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, which Geneva won 3–0.\nThe first recorded game between two college teams occurred on February 9, 1895, when Hamline University faced Minnesota A&amp;M (which later became a part of the University of Minnesota). Minnesota A&amp;M won the game, which was played under rules allowing nine players per side, 9–3. The first intercollegiate match using the modern rule of five players per side is often credited as a game between the University of Chicago and the University of Iowa, in Iowa City, Iowa, on January 18, 1896. The Chicago team, which was organized by Amos Alonzo Stagg, who had learned the game from James Naismith at Springfield YMCA, won the game 15–12. (Some sources state the first \"true\" five-on-five intercollegiate match was a game in 1897 between Yale and Penn, because the Iowa team, that played Chicago in 1896, was composed of University of Iowa students, but did not officially represent the University of Iowa – rather being organized through a YMCA.) By 1900 the game of basketball had spread to colleges across the country .\nBy 1897 the U.S. Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) had taken over oversight of basketball activity from YMCA. In April 1905, representatives of fifteen colleges separately took over control of the college game, creating the collegiate \"Basket Ball Rule Committee\". The committee was in turn absorbed into the predecessor of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in 1909. The extremely popular NCAA men's basketball tournament was started in 1939.\nFirst international games.\nAfter its arrival in Europe, basketball developed very quickly. In 1909 the first international match was held in Saint Petersburg: Mayak Saint Petersburg beat a YMCA American team. The first great European event was held in 1919 in Joinville-le-Pont, near Paris, during the Inter-Allied Games. United States, led by future Hall of Fame player Max Friedman, won against Italy and France, and then Italy beat France. Basketball soon became popular among French and Italians. The Italian team had a white shirt with the House of Savoy shield and the players were: Arrigo and Marco Muggiani, Baccarini, Giuseppe Sessa, Palestra, Pecollo and Bagnoli.\nFormation of FIBA.\nWorld basketball was growing, but it was on June 18, 1932, that a real international organization was formed, to coordinate tournaments and teams: that day, the following representatives of the 8 national federations: Attilio Ponisio (Argentina), Simeon Mavroskoufis (Greece), Count Giorgio Asinari di San Marzano (Italy), Joseph Shadeiko (Latvia), Henry Brandt (Portugal), D.D. Teica (Romania), Léon Bouffard (Switzerland), and Ladilslav Kapucian (Czechoslovakia) founded the International Basketball Federation (Fédération internationale de basketball amateur, FIBA) in Geneva. Its work was fundamental for the first inclusion of basketball in the Berlin Olympic Games in 1936. The first Olympic title was won by the U.S. national team: Sam Balter, Ralph Bishop, Joe Fortenberry, Tex Gibbons, Francis Johnson, Carl Knowles, Frank Lubin, Art Mollner, Donald Piper, Jack Ragland, Willard Schmidt, Carl Shy, Duane Swanson, Bill Wheatley and the trainer James Needles. Canada was runner-up; the games were played on an outdoor clay court. The first World Championship was held in Argentina in 1950.\nNBA.\nThe Basketball Association of America (BAA) was founded on June 6, 1946, in New York City. The league adopted the name National Basketball Association (NBA) in 1949 after merging with the rival National Basketball League (NBL). As of the early 21st century, the NBA is the most significant professional basketball league in the world in terms of popularity, salaries, talent, and level of competition. \nThe NBA's commissioner's name is Adam Silver and his job is to oversee the tasks in the organization. \nMany rule changes have occurred since the inception of professional basketball that has altered the game to what we now recognize today. These rule changes did not occur all at once but instead evolved to suit the changing style of play. Starting with the widening of the free-throw lane in 1951 and a further extension in 1964, this change was made to reduce the dominant impact of centers who played with their back facing the basket - otherwise known as Post Position. Then in 1954, the 24-second shot clock was introduced. This was done to increase the speed of the game, by forcing the team with the basketball to shoot the ball before the 24-second timer is up. Finally, the NBA introduced the three-point line, in the 1979–1980 season. This was done to spread out the players, which were predominantly playing underneath the basket at this time as well as add a further degree of difficulty to the game.\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, the influx of black athletes increased excitement and revitalized the NBA. By this time, the league was mainly composed of African American players, and most of the top stars were black. However, in the late 1970s, the popularity of the NBA was once again threatened by the decline in attendance and television ratings. In 1979, the NBA's TV audience declined by 18%.\nIn the 1980s, former university superstar Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson of Los Angeles and Larry Bird of Boston once changed the way the game was played. Despite both being Johnson and Bird could play many roles previously reserved for shorter players. They have been described as two of the 50 best players in NBA history. Just when the NBA needed a new force, Johnson and Bird gave the NBA a new big game to restore its low popularity. During and after that, some superstars entered the league, including Charles Barkley, Hakeem Olajuwon, David Robinson, and Michael Jordan.\nModern-day NBA.\nThe NBA has helped popularize basketball in other parts of the world. A large part of this is due to the transcendent stars that have played the game through the years. It was because of the play of Michael Jordan that basketball started to reach international audiences, especially on the 1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team, known as the Dream Team.\nAfter his final championship and second retirement in 1998, there was a void as in who would be the face of basketball. Soon after with the help of Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant would go on to win three straight championships from 2000 to 2002 with the Los Angeles Lakers, helping make basketball more popular in many places around the world, most noticeably China. Further championships in 2009 and 2010 helped raise his popularity. In 2015, he announced the following season would be his last. He would have played in 20 seasons by then.\nAnother player who revolutionized the game of basketball was LeBron James. He was taken as the first overall pick in the 2003 NBA draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers, and has worked his way to become the face of the NBA and basketball around the world. He left the Cavaliers in 2010 to join the Miami Heat along with fellow stars Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in what become known as \"The Decision\", winning back-to-back championships in 2012 and 2013 before returning to the Cavaliers in 2014 where he won a third championship in 2016. He joined the Los Angeles Lakers on July 1, 2018.\nThere have been many international players who helped globalize the game. The most noticeable would be Yao Ming. He was the first ever Chinese player to be selected with the number one overall pick in 2002 by the Houston Rockets. His play and presence in the NBA brought attention to basketball in Asian countries.\nThe style of basketball has evolved over time as well. Basketball, especially in the 1990s and 2000s, used to give importance to big men. Now, because of teams like the San Antonio Spurs and the Golden State Warriors, ball movement and team play is more common. The pace of play has also increased. In recent years, players such as Stephen Curry have increased the prevalence of the three-point shot in the professional game.\nAmerican Basketball Association.\nThe American Basketball Association (ABA) was founded as an alternative to the NBA in 1967 at a time when the NBA was experiencing a lot of popularity. The ABA offered an alternative ethos and game style as well as some changes in the rules. Julius Erving was the leading player in the league, and helped launch a modern style of play that emphasizes leaping and play above the rim. His playing strength helped legitimize the American Basketball Association. The league emphasized excitement and liveliness, be it in the color of the ball (red, white and blue), the manner of play, wild promotions, or the three-point shot. National recognition and earnings were low, leading the league to look for a way out of its problems. Merger with the more established and very successful NBA was seen as a solution. The ABA was folded into the NBA in the summer of 1976, its four most successful franchises (the New York Nets, Denver Nuggets, Indiana Pacers, and San Antonio Spurs) being incorporated into the older league. The aggressive, loose style of play and the three-point shot were taken up by the NBA.\nAfrican Americans in basketball.\nWith racial segregation affecting all areas of public life in the U.S. including sports, all-black basketball teams (Black Fives) were established in 1904. Dozens of all-black teams emerged during the Black Fives Era, in New York City, Washington, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and other cities.\nThe Smart Set Athletic Club of Brooklyn and the St. Christopher Club of New York City were established as the first fully organized independent all-black basketball teams in 1906. These teams were amateur.\nIn 1907 the amateur, all-black Olympian Athletic League was formed in New York City consisting of the Smart Set Athletic Club, St. Christopher Club, Marathon Athletic Club, Alpha Physical Culture Club, and Jersey City Colored YMCA. The first inter-city basketball game between two black teams was played in 1907 when the Smart Set Athletic Club of Brooklyn traveled to Washington, DC to play the Crescent Athletic Club.\nIn 1908 Smart Set Athletic Club of Brooklyn, a member of the Olympian Athletic League, was named the first Colored Basketball World's Champion.\nIn 1910 Howard University’s first varsity basketball team began.\nIn 1922 the Commonwealth Five, the first all-black professional team was founded. The New York Renaissance was founded in 1923.\nIn 1939 the all-black New York Renaissance beat the all-white Oshkosh All-Stars in the World Pro Basketball Tournament.\nFrom the late 1920s the African American Harlem Globetrotters were a successful touring team, winning the WPBT in 1940.\nThe all-white National Basketball League began to racially integrate in 1942 with 10 black players joining two teams, the Toledo Jim White Chevrolets, and the Chicago Studebakers. The NBA integrated in 1950–51 seasons, just two years after its founding, with three black players each achieving a separate milestone in that process. In the draft held immediately prior to that season, Chuck Cooper became the first black player drafted by an NBA team. Shortly after the draft, Nat Clifton became the first black player to sign an NBA contract. Finally, Earl Lloyd became the first black player to appear in an NBA game as his team started its season before either Cooper's or Clifton's.\nAfter the integration of the NBA, the Harlem Globetrotters started to focus on international touring and exhibition performances, including comic routines. These tours helped to popularize basketball internationally, and gave the Globetrotters the reputation as basketball's goodwill ambassadors.\nOlympic basketball.\nBasketball was invented by James Naismith in Springfield, Massachusetts, in 1891. Within a few decades, the new game became popular throughout the United States as an indoor sport. The popularity spread overseas and the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) was organized in 1932 in Geneva, Switzerland.\nThanks in part to the effort of Phog Allen—a Kansas Jayhawks collegiate coach—the first Olympic basketball tournament was organized in the 1936 Berlin Olympics on outdoor tennis courts. Dr. Naismith presented the medals to the top three teams. According to the Olympic rules of that time, all of the competitors were amateurs. The tournament was held indoors for the first time in 1948. The American team proved its dominance, winning the first seven Olympic tournaments through 1968, without losing a single game. While the Americans were barred from sending a team that contained players from the professional National Basketball Association, they instead sent in college players; teams from some other countries sent in their best players, as some of their players were classified as \"amateur\" by FIBA, by earning allowances instead of wages.\nThe U.S. winning streak ended in 1972 in one of the most controversial matches in history, when the Soviet Union beat them in the gold-medal game by one point.\nThe U.S. team reclaimed the gold medal in 1976, with Yugoslavia, which had beaten the Soviet Union in the semifinal, finishing runner-up for the second time. In 1980, with the Americans' absence due to the boycott, Yugoslavia became the third team to win the title, after beating the Soviets anew in the semifinals and Italy in the final. The Americans regained the title in 1984, by beating Spain in the final, with the Soviets boycotting this time. The Soviets won the gold medal for the second time in 1988, after beating the U.S. team for the second time in the semifinal, and the Yugoslavs in the gold medal game.\nThe advent of the state-sponsored \"full-time amateur athlete\" of the Eastern Bloc countries eroded the ideology of the pure amateur, as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. The Soviet Union entered teams of athletes who were all nominally listed in the military, but all of whom were in fact paid by the state to train full-time. In April 1989, through the leadership of Secretary General Borislav Stanković, FIBA approved the rule that allowed NBA players to compete in international tournaments, including the Olympics. In the 1992 Summer Olympics, the U.S. \"Dream Team\" won the gold medal with an average winning margin of 44 points per game, and without calling a timeout. By this time, the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia no longer existed, but their successor states continued to be among the leading forces. Two newly independent countries of the former Yugoslavia and Soviet Union, Croatia and Lithuania, won the silver and bronze medals respectively.\nThe American team repeated its victory in 1996 and 2000, but its performance was not as dominant as in 1992. Since active NBA players have been allowed to compete in the Summer Olympics, the 1996 Games in Atlanta is the only instance where the Olympic host city also had a home NBA team — the Hawks. Yugoslavia was the runner-up in Atlanta, and France in Sydney, with Lithuania winning bronze again on both occasions.\nThe renewed dominance of the U.S. was interrupted in 2004, when the Americans barely made it to the semifinal, after losing to Puerto Rico and Lithuania in the preliminaries; Argentina defeated them in the semifinals, on their way to a gold medal finish, where they beat Italy in the final, and became the fourth team to win the Olympic title.\nThe Americans regrouped in 2008, beating the reigning FIBA world champions, Spain, in an intense gold medal game, with the Argentines beating the Lithuanians in the bronze medal game. The Americans and the Spaniards met again in the 2012 gold medal game, with the U.S. again winning, although with the closest winning margin for the American team. The U.S. won again in 2016, defeating the Serbians in the gold medal game, a rematch of the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup Final, after eliminating the Spaniards, who settled for bronze.\nThe first women's tournament was staged in the 1976 Summer Olympics. The Soviet Union won five straight games, becoming the inaugural champion. The next two tournaments followed the six-team round-robin format, with the Soviets defending their title in 1980 amid the U.S.-led boycott, and the U.S. winning in 1984, against the South Koreans, amid the Soviet-led boycott. In 1988, the tournament expanded into eight teams, with the Americans beating Yugoslavia in the gold medal game. In 1992, the Unified Team, consisting of the former Soviet republics, defeated China in the gold medal game. In 1996, the tournament settled into its current 12-team format; the U.S. has swept all of the tournaments since then, winning 48 consecutive games."

        "text": "The Bowling Green Falcons ice hockey team is the ice hockey team that represents Bowling Green State University in Bowling Green, Ohio. The school's team competes in the Central Collegiate Hockey Association. The Falcons last played in the NCAA Men's Division I Ice Hockey Tournament in 2019. The Falcons have won one NCAA Division I championship, coming in 1984, defeating the Minnesota-Duluth Bulldogs in the longest championship game in the tournament's history.\nHistory.\nEarly history (1960-1973).\nIce hockey at Bowling Green has existed since the early 1960s in club form. It was not until the late 1960s that the university took interest in adding men's ice hockey to its list of varsity sports. Jack Vivian took over the program in the 1966. and in the University opened the BGSU Ice Arena in 1967 and Vivian guided the program into the NCAA in 1969. The team joined the Midwest Collegiate Hockey Association (MCHA) for the 1969-70 season and in its first season in the conference, the Falcons finished 1st in the regular season with a record of 13-12-5.\nThe team continued that initial success into the 1970-71 season. BG again took first place in the MCHA regular season with a record of 18-12-1. Vivian was a key figure in creating the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA) and in 1971 Bowling Green joined as a charter member.\nIn their first season in the CCHA Bowling Green finished with a record of 21-10-2. BG lost to Saint Louis University 5-6 in overtime in the CCHA Semifinal game and beat Ohio University 6-5 in OT in the Third Place Game.\nDespite a sub .500 record in the 1972-73 season the Falcons won 6-5 in overtime over St. Louis in a rematch of the 1972 Semifinal game and beat Ohio State 8-1 to win BGSU's first CCHA Tournament Championship and Jack Vivian's first and only CCHA Championship. Following the 1972-73 season Vivian left to become the General Manager and coach of the Cleveland Crusaders (WHA).\nRise to a national powerhouse (1973-1990).\nRon Mason took over as head coach of the Falcons for the 1973-74 season after coaching from 1966-73 at Lake Superior State where he led the Lakers five NAIA Tournament appearances, three straight runner-up spots from 1968–70 and an NAIA Championship in 1972.\nWith Mason behind the bench BG won their second CCHA Tournament Championship with a 5-4 victory over St. Louis University. The win gave the Falcons their first bid to the NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament in 1977. Bowling Green State lost in their first NCAA tournament appearance in a high scoring game, 7-5 to Michigan.\nBG continued where they left off the season before and claimed another CCHA Regular Season Championship. The Falcons picked up wins over Ohio State and Saint Louis University to win the CCHA Playoff Championship. This gave Bowling Green their second ever and second straight NCAA tournament appearance. BG won 5-3 over Colorado College for the program's first NCAA post season win. With the win over CC BG advanced to the Frozen Four for the first time. Bowling Green fell to Boston College 6-2. The Falcons came back in the Third Place Game with a 4-3 win over the Wisconsin Badgers. The following season, in 1978-79, Bowling Green again claimed first place in the CCHA regular season and CCHA playoffs after wins from Lake Superior State and Ohio State. BG advanced to the third consecutive NCAA tournament in 1979 under Mason. Their season was ended by Minnesota 6-3. Bowling Green finished the 1978-79 season with a record of 37-6-2, to date, the most wins in school history and then an NCAA record 37 wins.\nThe 1979-80 season saw the second coaching change in the program's history after Mason left to coach Michigan State. Bowling Green hired Jerry York, formerly head coach of the Clarkson Golden Knights since 1972.\nThe Falcons continued their winning ways and BGSU won the CCHA Regular Season Championship the third season with York as head coach. After a 8-5 loss in the CCHA semi-final game to Notre Dame BG took third place in the CCHA playoffs after a 2-1 win over Michigan Tech. Bowling Green received an at-large bid to the 1982 NCAA tournament but lost 5-4 in OT to Northeastern.\nThe 1983-84 season was one of the most historic seasons in Bowling Green Hockey history. BGSU finished first place in the CCHA regular season for the third straight season but fell in the CCHA Playoffs in the CCHA Semifinals, 4-3 in the second overtime to Western Michigan. Despite the loss, Bowling Green received an at-large bid to the 1984 NCAA tournament. The Falcons won the opening round series in overtime to Boston University The Falcons then won 2-1 over Michigan State in the Frozen Four. The win over the Spartans set up a Championship game in the Herb Brooks Arena located in Lake Placid, New York, site of the Miracle on Ice during the 1980 Winter Olympics, against Minnesota–Duluth. The game was tied at 4 after regulation and went into overtime. Bowling Green won in the fourth overtime from a goal by Gino Cavallini 7:11 into the fourth overtime, also at the 97:11 mark of total game time, it stands today as one of the longest games in Division I hockey history and the longest NCAA D1 Men's Ice Hockey Championship Game.\nThe Falcons finished high in the CCHA standings during the following season, including first place in the regular season during the 1986-87 season and a CCHA Playoff Championship in the 1987-88 season. The team qualified for the NCAA tournament four straight seasons from 1987–1990, a program high for consecutive appearances.\nFalling into the shadows (1991-2008).\nBG failed to qualify for the NCAA post season from 1991–94 and finished with a winning record only once, with a record of 19-17-2 (.526 pct.) in 1993-94. Following the 1993-94 season York accepted a head coaching position at his alma mater Boston College. Buddy Powers was appointed the head coach at Bowling Green on July 12, 1994, becoming the fourth head coach in the program's history. He had previously served as the head coach at the Rochester Institute of Technology (DIII) and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Powers had also served as an assistant coach, chief recruiter, and on-ice instructor for BGSU under York from 1982-88. During the time the Falcons had a record of 174-74-8 (.695 pct.), including 129-50-8 (.710 pct.) in league play and finished either first or second in the CCHA on five occasions.\nPowers lead the Falcons to a 25-11-2 record and a second-place finish in the CCHA during the 1994-95 campaign. It marked their best finish in the league in eight years. He was named the CCHA's Coach of the Year and was a finalist for the Spencer Penrose Award presented annually to the nation's top head coach. Also that year, Brian Holzinger was named CCHA player of the Year. Holzinger won the NCAA All-American Award in ice hockey along with Kelly Perrault. Holzinger became BGSU's second Hobey Baker Award winner, the other being George McPhee in 1982 during Powers' first season as BGSU's assistant coach.\nAlthough the first half of his time as BGSU's head coach was strong, the lack of top players coming to BGSU affected his overall record; Powers finished with losing records in his last five seasons. \nOver eight seasons as BGSU's head coach, Powers has compiled a 135-149-26 record at Bowling Green. Powers left in 2002 and eventually became the ice arena director at BG until taking an assistant coaching position in 2009 with his alma mater, Boston University.\nScott Paluch became the fifth coach in program history starting in the 2002-03 season. The change of coaching staff did not yield any better results as the trend of sub-.500 seasons continued.\nPaluch's best season came in 2007-08 when he led the Falcons to their first CCHA post season win in seven years during the 2007-08 season when the Falcons picked up a 4-3 win over Lake Superior State on March 7, 2008. The game marked the first CCHA playoff win since 2001 Bowling Green defeated Northern Michigan 2-1 in overtime. The win over Lake Superior in 2008 also marked the first playoff win at home since 1995 against Notre Dame. CCHA Quarterfinal round in the 2007-08 season. Lake Superior rebounded the next night with a 6-1 win to tie the best-of-three series at 1 game each. Bowling Green finished the Lakers off in the third game after being down 1-3 early in the second period. The Falcons push with a second period goal by Derek Whitmore and a late goal by Todd McIlrath to tie the game with three minutes left in the third period by was capped off 1:34 into overtime when Freshman Jacob Cepis found the back of the LSSU net.\nBowling Green would fall in their first CCHA quarterfinal match up since 2001 at Miami two games to none. The RedHawks would go on to the 2008 NCAA tournament, losing in the Quarterfinals to the eventual National Champion, Boston College.\nPossible end (2008-2010).\nBy late 2008 and early 2009, after years of low rankings in the CCHA and NCAA, lack of post season success, an aging arena desperate for renovations and the program's lack of top players, rumors that the university was investigating canceling hockey as a varsity sport in efforts to cut budget losses were confirmed to be among a number of options. The news shocked both the BGSU and college hockey communities. College hockey had already been hit by a number of folding varsity hockey programs in the previous decade, including nearby Findlay. But unlike some of the smaller programs to be discontinued, Bowling Green was close to becoming the first NCAA Championship-winning hockey program to be eliminated.\nThe Falcons were without a winning season since 1996-97, and had had only one .500 season during that stretch. Soon after the rumors began, program alumni, Falcon hockey fans in the form of university alumni and current students, BGSU figure skating alumni and various other users of the BGSU Ice Arena began grassroots efforts to save the program. A program, that eventually transformed with the university's help into the Bring Back the Glory Campaign, began to raise money for ice arena renovations, hockey scholarship endowments and other funds. Leaders of the Campaign included notable alumni Rob Blake, Garry Galley, Alissa Czisny, Scott Hamilton, Tom Blakely, Steve Green, and the programs first head coach Jack Vivian, among others.\nFollowing the conclusion of the 2008-2009 season, BGSU head coach Scott Paluch resigned. Paluch posted a record of 84-156-23 (.363 pct.) in his seven seasons as head coach of the Falcons. His best season came in 2004-05 when the team finished with a .500 record of 16-16-4. Dennis Williams, previously a head coach at Neumann College (DIII) and assistant coach at BG for the 2008-2009 season took over as interim head coach. Although Williams posted a record of 5-25-6 in his only season behind the bench, the 2009-10 season was a success in a number of areas. The future of the program was secured with the help of the university and Bring Back the Glory campaign and Williams stopped the outflow of players and recruits after news of the possible end of the program.\nBring Back the Glory (2010-2018).\nThe rapid success of the Bring Back the Glory campaign to establish an endowment and raise necessary funds to secure the program's future was seen when the BGSU Ice Arena began a $4 million renovation to upgrade the compressors, chillers, build new locker rooms, add an additional multipurpose ice sheet, and infrastructure and lighting upgrades.\nChris Bergeron was hired as head coach beginning in the 2010-11 season, along with Barry Schutte and Ty Eigner. Bergeron came to Bowling Green after serving as assistant coach and recruiting coordinator at Miami University, where he helped head coach Enrico Blasi build the RedHawks program into a national powerhouse. Bergeron was brought in by the university to turn around the struggling program. After starting the season 0-3-0 losing two games to Michigan and one to Clarkson, Bergeron picked up his first win as a college head coach in the second game of the road series against Clarkson on October 16, 2010. The Falcons finished the regular season 11th in the CCHA with a record of 8-24-4. The Falcons then upset Northern Michigan in the first round of the CCHA Tournament winning the best-of-three series when freshman Bryce Williamson scored the 34 seconds into the second overtime. The 2-1 win sent the Falcons to the CCHA quarterfinals for the first time since the 2007-08 season where the Falcons were matched up against top-seeded Michigan. The Wolverines ended the season for Bowling Green by sweeping the Falcons in the best-of-three series 1-5 and 1-4.\nIn August 2011, the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA) announced it extended invitations to five CCHA members, after eight of the WCHA's members announced they were leaving for the Big Ten Conference and National Collegiate Hockey Conference in 2013. BGSU gained an extension of the invitation while the athletic department investigated other opportunities. On October 4, 2011, the university announced its intentions to leave the CCHA in 2013 and join the WCHA beginning In 2013-14. The move will allow the falcons to maintain existing rivalries with Alaska-Fairbanks, Ferris State, Lake Superior State and Northern Michigan, all of which announced acceptations of the WCHA invite prior to Bowling Green's announcement.\nThe Falcons finished the 2011-12 regular season with an overall record of 10-21-5 and a conference record of 5 wins, 19 losses, 4 overtime games and three shootout wins; the record positioned the team in last place in the conference. In the first round of the 2012 CCHA Tournament BGSU was set to play Northern Michigan. In a rematch of the prior season's tournament, Bowling Green again upset the six-seeded Wildcats three games to two. In the second round, Bowling Green played top-seeded Ferris State, also ranked second in the national poll. The Falcons won the first game of the three-game series in overtime, followed by the Bulldogs winning the second game to force a third game. In the third game of the series, Ferris State recorded three goals in the first period before Bowling Green rallied to score four unanswered goals, the final goal in overtime. Bowling Green advanced to the CCHA Semifinal round at Joe Louis Arena in Detroit for the first time since the 2001 season with the win over Ferris State. The season ended in the CCHA Semifinal game when Michigan rallied from a two-goal deficit and tied the game with 2:45 left in regulation to force overtime. The tie was not broken until Michigan's Luke Moffatt scored at the 1:04 mark of the second overtime to give the Wolverines a 3-2 win. BGSU goaltender Andrew Hammond finished the game with 55 saves that came within one save of the school record is 56 saves set by Jordan Sigalet in 2003. The team lost the third place 4-1 to Miami (OH) game and finished fourth in the CCHA Playoffs. Bowling Green finished the season with an overall record of 14-25-5.\nThe team recently held ceremonies in the 2014 season to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the National Championship Team. Also the Falcons will be playing in an outdoor game against Robert Morris University at Fifth Third Field.\nOn November 17, 2014, the Falcons appeared in the USCHO.com Division I Men's Poll at number 19 for the first time since the 2007-2008 season. The Falcons have moved up in the rankings in subsequent weeks, reaching 18th, 15th and 14th, in consecutive weeks.\nIn 2017-18, the Bowling Green Falcons won the Great Lakes Invitational Tournament, the first in Detroit's Little Caesar's Arena. They defeated the Michigan Wolverines 6-4 in the semifinals, and they defeated the Michigan Tech Huskies 4-1 in the championship game the following day.\nThe Glory Is Back (2018–present).\nIn 2018-19, Bowling Green had a hot stretch to start the season, highlighted by an 8-2 victory over a top-10 Ohio State team in Columbus and culminating in finishing the first half of the season with a sweep of then-#3 Minnesota State to go into the Christmas break with a 13-3-3 record. Despite their struggles with consistency down the stretch to close the regular season, the Falcons swept their way through the first 2 rounds of the playoffs, defeating Michigan Tech 3-2, 6-2 at home and Northern Michigan 6-1, 2-1 on the road along the way en route to a WCHA Championship game in Mankato, MN on March 23, 2019, where the Falcons fell to Minnesota Statein overtime, 3-2. Despite the loss, they had officially done what no Bowling Green team had done since 1990 - earn a bid to the NCAA tournament. They were selected as the 15th seed, which was the last at-large bid to make it into the tournament. This was a monumental occasion, drawing a crowd of Falcon fans to a \"watch party\" for the selection show inside the Slater Family Ice Arena as Bowling Green heard their name called for the first time in 29 years that night. In addition to the selection show, that day was also the 35th anniversary of the 1984 NCAA Championship, which saw the Falcons earn a 5-4 victory in four overtimes over the Minnesota-Duluth Bulldogs, who would coincidentally end up being their first round opponent in the Midwest Regional out of Allentown, PA in the 2019 tournament. Unfortunately for the Falcons, they would drop the contest 2-1 in overtime, and their season would come to a close with a record of 25-11-5 for the year, their most wins in a single season since they earned 26 victories during the 1995-96 campaign. On April 5, 2019, it was announced that Chris Bergeron would be leaving to assume the head coaching job at Miami University, his alma mater. He left Bowling Green as the 2nd-winningest head coach in school history, with 171 wins.\nOn April 20, 2019, after a 15-day search, Ty Eigner was hired as the 8th head coach in Bowling Green hockey history. A Bowling Green alumnus and former captain for the BGSU hockey team, Eigner was hired after spending the previous 9 seasons as an assistant coach. In his time as an assistant, BGSU amassed a total overall record of 171-154-44, winning 20+ games in his final 5 seasons as an assistant and making the NCAA tournament for the first time in 29 years. On the day Eigner was hired, Boston College head coach and former BGSU head coach Jerry York discussed the move, saying, \"The first thing I remember about coaching Ty was how well-respected he was in our locker room -- an outstanding teammate. His progression and growth in coaching has been very impressive from my viewpoint. He is an excellent hire to lead the Falcons!\"\nOn June 28, 2019, it was announced that Bowling Green would leave the WCHA following the 2020–21 season, along with 6 other league schools to re-form the CCHA, the Falcons' previous conference, which had been dormant since the 2012–13 NCAA Hockey season. To begin the 2019–20 season, Eigner's Falcons traveled to take on Bergeron's Redhawks in their respective coaching debuts at each school, with Bowling Green taking the win, 7-4. In November 2019, BGSU split with then-#2 Minnesota State and swept then-#5 Notre Dame to win three times against top-5 opponents in a span of one month. It was a signal to many fans that the program would be just fine under Eigner. Bowling Green followed the Notre Dame sweep with a colossal offensive performance, scoring 9 goals in a 23 minute span to defeat the Alabama-Huntsville Chargers, 9-3. The Falcons won a first round series on the road in Fairbanks, Alaska in March 2020, sweeping the Nanooks 4-2, 3-2. On the Thursday before their semifinal series against Bemidji State, the WCHA and NCAA announced that the rest of the season was canceled due to the COVID-19 outbreak, ending Eigner's first season in charge with an overall record of 21-13-4. After having a difficult and oftentimes frustrating January, the Falcons finished the season as one of the hottest team in the country, with a 10-game unbeaten streak (8-0-2), longest in the nation. That year, Eigner coached defenseman Alec Rauhauser to a 2nd-team All-American (West) finish and a WCHA Defensive Player of the Year Award, adding to his successful track record of developing tremendous defensive hockey players. Also in 2019-2020, with the help of assistant coach Maco Balkovec, the re-designed Falcon powerplay unit scored the most goals on the man advantage in Division I hockey.\nIn 2020–21, in the final year of the WCHA and a season shortened due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Bowling Green started the season on a scorching pace, winning 12 of their first 13 games and finding themselves at 16-4-0 through 20 games. Unfortunately, the hot start did not last, and the Falcons went 4-6-1 down the stretch, including their first quarterfinal playoff series loss since joining the WCHA in 2013, losing to Northern Michigan in three games. Still, with their 20-10-1 record, there was a thought that they may still have a chance at an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament, being one of the five programs in the country to win 20+ games on the season. However, those dreams were dashed on Selection Sunday, when the Falcons were left out for a 14-13-2 Notre Dame team from the Big Ten.\nStill, 2020–21 had some great moments, as Bowling Green won the program’s 1,000th game in program history on January 16, 2021. In addition, three of Eigner’s Falcons were named as First Team All-WCHA performers, in seniors Brandon Kruse and Connor Ford, and junior Will Cullen, who also claimed Bowling Green’s third WCHA Defensive Player of the Year award in four seasons.\nStatistical leaders.\nCareer goaltending leaders.\n\"GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\"\nFalcons in the NHL.\n†Dan Bylsma won a Stanley Cup as head coach for the Pittsburgh Penguins\nOlympians.\nThis is a list of Bowling Green alumni were a part of an Olympic team.\nAward winners.\nNCAA.\nIndividual awards.\nHobey Baker Award\nNCAA Scoring Champion\nNCAA tournament MOP\nAll-Americans.\nFirst Team\nFirst Team\nCCHA.\nIndividual awards.\nPlayer of the Year\nRookie of the Year\nBest Offensive Defenseman\nTerry Flanagan Memorial Award\nPerani Cup\nCoach of the Year\nTournament MVP\nAll-conference teams.\nFirst Team All-CCHA\nSecond Team All-CCHA\nAll-CCHA Rookie Team\nWCHA.\nIndividual awards.\nDefensive Player of the Year\nAll-conference teams.\nFirst Team All-WCHA\nSecond Team All-WCHA\nThird Team All-WCHA\nAll-WCHA Rookie Team\nSchool records.\nSeason.\nPlayers\nTeam\nGame.\nPlayer\nTeam"

        "text": "The 1982 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 53rd midseason exhibition between the all-stars of the American League (AL) and the National League (NL), the two leagues comprising Major League Baseball. The game was played on July 13, 1982, at Olympic Stadium in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, home of the Montreal Expos of the National League. The game resulted in a 4–1 victory for the NL, and Cincinnati Reds shortstop Dave Concepción was named the MVP.\nIt is notable for being the first All-Star Game ever played outside the United States. This would be the only All-Star Game to be played in Montréal, as the Expos would leave in 2005 to become the Washington Nationals before having an opportunity to host another. Four members of the Expos were voted into the starting lineup. The flyover at the conclusion of the National Anthems was done for the first time by a national air squadron other than those from the United States Air Force or Air National Guard as the Snowbirds from the Canadian Forces Air Command flew over Olympic Stadium, marking the first of their two All-Star appearances; they would perform the flyover for the 1991 Major League Baseball All-Star Game in Toronto nine years later. It is also the last All-Star Game in which the manager of the runner-up for any league pennant managed in place of the manager of the defending league champions due to the latter's unemployment; Billy Martin of the Oakland Athletics managed in place of Bob Lemon, who had been fired by the New York Yankees, Martin's former team.\nRosters.\nPlayers in \"italics\" have since been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\nGame.\nGame summary.\nThe AL drew first blood in the first off NL starter Steve Rogers when Reggie Jackson drove home Rickey Henderson with a sacrifice fly. Dave Concepción responded for the NL with a two-run homer in the second off AL starter Dennis Eckersley and the NL never looked back. The NL tacked on a run in the third when Ruppert Jones tripled and Pete Rose hit a sacrifice fly. The NL got their final run in the sixth on a Gary Carter RBI single that scored then-Expo teammate Al Oliver."

        "text": "The Winnipeg Maroons were a senior ice hockey team based in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.\nHistory.\nThe Winnipeg Maroons existed as a senior hockey team of and on from at least 1925 to 1964. Senior hockey leagues did not consistently exist in Manitoba during those years, so the club would have competed in exhibition games during the years it was not part of an official league. This would have also prepared them for late season Allan Cup competition, where the winner of the Western Canada playdowns would face the representative from Eastern Canada for the Allan Cup senior ice hockey national championship.\nThe Winnipeg Maroons played in 1925–26 in the Central Hockey League; this league reorganized as the American Hockey Association, where the Maroons competed during the 1926–27 and 1927–28 seasons. Afterwards, the franchise became the St. Louis Flyers. A later senior team of the same name participated in the single 1954–55 season of the Manitoba Senior Hockey League.\nThe Winnipeg Maroons played a goodwill exhibition tour of Czechoslovakia from December 1960 to January 1961, accompanied by Canadian Amateur Hockey Association representative W. A. Hewitt.\nThe Winnipeg Maroons squad participated in the Saskatchewan Senior Hockey League from 1962–63 through 1964–65.\nAllan Cup.\nThe Maroons lost to the Regina Capitals in the Western Canada quarterfinals for the 1953 Allan Cup.\nIn the Western playdowns for the 1954 Allan Cup, the Maroons defeated the Fort William Beavers in the quarterfinals, the Moose Jaw Millers in the semifinals, then fell to the Penticton Vees in the Western final. The Vees would go on to win that year's cup, defeating Eastern Canada's Sudbury Wolves.\nIn the Western playdowns for the 1955 Allan Cup, the Maroons lost to the Fort William Beavers in the semifinals.\nIn the Western playdowns for the 1956 Allan Cup, the Maroons defeated the Fort William Beavers in the semifinals, then fell to the Vernon Canadians in the Western final. The Canadians would go on to win that year's cup, defeating Eastern Canada's Chatham Maroons.\nIn the Western playdowns for the 1958 Allan Cup, the Maroons defeated the Fort William Beavers in the quarter-finals, the Red Deer Rustlers in the semifinals, then fell to the Kelowna Packers in the Western final. The Packers would lose to Eastern Canada's Belleville McFarlands at that year's national finals.\nIn the Western playdowns for the 1959 Allan Cup, the Maroons lost to the Port Arthur Bearcats in the quarterfinals.\nThe Maroons advanced to the Allan Cup national finals for the first time in 1961, where they lost to the Eastern Canada champion Galt Terriers at the 1961 Allan Cup. To become the Western Canada champion that year, the Maroons defeated the Port Arthur Bearcats, Moose Jaw Pla-Mors and Nelson Maple Leafs in the Western playdowns. \nThe 1964 team beat the Woodstock Athletics 4 straight games - 5-0, 7-1, 5-0, and 5-3. It was the Maroons' third appearance in four years in the Allan Cup final. After losing to Galt Terriers in 1962 and Windsor Bulldogs in 1963, they were not to be denied in 1964. The Maroons were overpowering in their championship quest in 1964, winning 12 of their 13 playoff games and outscoring their rivals 79 - 32 with veteran Ross Parke leading the team in scoring with 26 points. Eggie Kukulowicz with 22 points, and Elliot Chorley with 19 points. Another veteran, Chuck Lumsden, scored the winning goal and Ross Parke the last goal of the Allen Cup playoff finals. Two keen Maroon players, Fred Dunsmore and Reg Abbot missed the playoffs due to injuries. This 1964 Maroon Club were true amateurs as no players were paid and home game venues went to Winnipeg charities. The Maroons also played approximately twelve games against the Russian, Czechoslovakian, Swedish and USA national teams in Winnipeg. The Maroons held their own against such fine teams even though the players were all from Winnipeg. In 1965, the CAHA asked the team to give up its identity and become Canada's First National Team.\nThe team roster was: Reg Abbott, Gary Aldcorn, Terry Ball, Sheldon Bloomer, Dick Braun, Ron Castelane, Elliot Chorley, Don Collins, Murray Couch, Mike Daski, Gord Dibley, Fred Dunsmore, Ron Farnfield, Bernie Grebinsky, Al Johnson, Bill Johnson, Lou Joyal, Leo Konyk, Julian Klymkiw, Aggie Kukulowicz, Ron Kullman, Chuck Lumsden, Jim MacKenzie, Tom Marshall, Ross Parke, John Russell, Danny Summers, Terry Hind, President, Bud Holohan (G.M.), Gord Simpson (Coach). The general manager was Charles \"Chas\" Maddin, father of filmmaker Guy Maddin, who profiled the Maroons in his semi-documentary film \"My Winnipeg\".\nThe 1964 Winnipeg Maroons team was inducted into both the Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame, and the Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame and Museum in 2003.\nThe Canadian Amateur Hockey Association merged the Canada men's national ice hockey team into the Maroons in 1965, and Gord Simpson continued as coach. Father David Bauer who had founded the national team, continued as its manager and saw the merger as the beginning of a truly national team based in the geographic centre of the country.\nIn 1967, the Maroons relocated to St. Boniface and became the St. Boniface Mohawks."

The game was played on July 8, 1980, at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, California, home of the Los Angeles Dodgers of the National League. The game resulted in a 4–2 victory for the NL.\nWhile this would mark the second time that the Dodgers had hosted the All-Star Game in Los Angeles, it was the first time that the game was being held at Dodger Stadium. Their first time as host in 1959 saw the game played at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum; the Dodgers' Los Angeles home field until the construction of Dodger Stadium.\nThis All-Star Game would be known for some exemplary pitching performances, most notably AL starter Steve Stone's (three perfect innings, three strikeouts). Jerry Reuss struck out the side for the NL in the sixth, as well.\nIt would also be one of the final games for NL starter J. R. Richard. Richard was diagnosed with a career-ending stroke weeks later.\nThe pregame ceremonies of the All-Star Game featured Disney characters. Later, Edwards Air Force Base of Rosamond, California, provided both the colors presentation and, after the Los Angeles All-City Band performed the Canadian and U.S. National Anthems, the flyover ceremonies. This All-Star Game marked the first nationally televised US performance of \"O Canada\" after it had officially been designated the Canadian National Anthem seven days earlier on July 1, 1980. It also marked the debut of the modern-day large-scale video screen, with the first such video scoreboard, Diamond Vision by Mitsubishi Electric, being introduced at this game.\nGame summary.\nThe AL and NL were locked in a scoreless duel for four innings, including Stone's performance mentioned above. Fred Lynn would break the deadlock in the top of the fifth with a two-run homer off Bob Welch.\nThe National League came back with a single run in their half of the fifth when Ken Griffey homered off Tommy John. The NL took the lead in the bottom of the sixth when George Hendrick singled home Ray Knight and Phil Garner scored on a Willie Randolph error.\nThe NL's final run scored in the seventh when Dave Concepcion reached on a fielder's choice, went to second on a wild-pitch by Dave Stieb, then to third on a passed ball by Darrell Porter, and came home on another Stieb wild pitch.\nRosters.\nPlayers in \"italics\" have since been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame."

From 2021, the men's team is to consist of players selected from the New South Wales Rugby League Ron Massey Cup competition to play against a combined team selected from Country, New South Wales competitions. The women's team is selected on a region of origin basis from the NSWRL Women's Premiership.\nThe reorganisation in 2021 means the Sydney / City team is selected from a third-tier competition, as the Ron Massey Cup sits below the first-tier National Rugby League and the second-tier New South Wales Cup. Previously, the Sydney / City team was selected from the first-tier competition. The first match by a Sydney Metropolitan team was held in 1909 against New Zealand. The first match against a Country representative team was held in 1911. Matches by Sydney against international touring teams continued until the 1970s. Annual matches by City against Country were played in most years until 1993. A City vs Country Origin match was introduced in 1987 and this ran until 2017, with a three season hiatus in the years 1998 to 2000.\nHistory.\nThe New South Wales City team first competed against New South Wales Country on 10 June 1911 which City won 2–8. The first time the match was made an annual event began in 1928 with NSW Country defeating City 35–34.\nA Sydney team was assembled for the 1953 American All Stars tour of Australia and New Zealand. The first City V Country origin match occurred on 16 May 1987 with City running out winners 30–22.\nIn 2016, it was announced by the NRL that the City V Country fixture was to be scrapped beyond the 2017 season. The reasons behind the decision were to clubs pulling their players out of the match and others cited player drain as a reason for the fixture to be culled. There was also a sentiment that the fixture had gone from being a genuine audition match for a potential New South Wales origin jersey to being a regular game as most of the New South Wales side had already been picked prior to the match starting.\nOn 14 May 2017, the final City v Country fixture was played with NSW City defeating Country 20–8.\nOverall, New South Wales City were much more successful than New South Wales Country winning a total of 68 games in the annual fixture as opposed to Country's 22 wins with City winning each year from 1976 to 1991.\nLocation.\nAny players whose junior football was played for a club within the greater area of Sydney city is deemed eligible to play for the City RL.

The tournament format, which has changed several times, currently consists of an eight-team double-elimination tournament format, in which the winners of two four-team brackets play in a single-game final. Rice, which has won the tournament seven times, is the most successful team in the tournament's history.\nHistory.\nThe tournament was first held in 1996, the first season after Conference USA was formed from the merger of the Metro Conference and the Great Midwest Conference.\n1996–1999.\nFrom 1996 to 1999, the tournament format consisted of an eight-team double-elimination tournament preceded by a single-game play-in round. The play-in round determined which of the lowest seeds (by regular season conference record) would qualify for the eight-team bracket. In 1996, when the league had nine baseball-sponsoring schools, the play-in round included the 8th and 9th seeds. When Houston joined from the Southwest Conference prior to the 1997 season, the play-in round featured the 7th–10th seeds. The eight-team double-elimination tournament consisted of two four-team double-elimination brackets, the winners of which met in a single-game final.\n2000–2009.\nIn the 2000 tournament, the play-in round was eliminated, and the top eight seeds qualified for the eight-team double-elimination tournament automatically. The eight-team bracket followed the same format as it had from 1996 to 1999.\n2010.\nIn 2010, the tournament format was changed from double-elimination to round robin. The top six regular season finishers qualified for the tournament field, which consisted of two three-team \"pods.\" Pod 1 included the 1st, 4th, and 5th seeds, and Pod 2 included the 2nd, 3rd, and 6th seeds. Each team played three preliminary games, two against its podmates and one against a team from the opposite group. The cross-group games matched up the seeds as follows: 1st vs. 6th, 2nd vs. 5th, and 3rd vs. 4th.

(According to the interpretation of the narrow definition of Amateur status then enforced by the ARA rules, these men were to be considered professionals).\nThis definition of \"amateur\" was finally resolved in the 1920s and in 1930 NARA was reconstituted, its objectives being \"to foster and encourage amateur rowing and to watch over and generally protect its interests.\" (Articles of Association 1930). \nIn 1939 NARA was incorporated as a non-profit making company.\nThe new body gained significant support though practically, the only difference between the two organisations was their outlook on the bar on manual labour; in all other respects the NARA was as strict about amateurism as the ARA. Its first president was the Duke of Fife and its last Lord Iveagh.\nThe organisation was however very different from that of the ARA, as the NARA was composed of ten self-governing regional associations:\nAll of these were actively engaged in organising regattas for their member clubs and around 90 regattas a year followed NARA rules.\nThe End of the divide.\nFrom about 1929 discussions took place with ARA about the possibility of merging to form one governing body. In 1937 the ARA abolished its objectionable definition of \"amateur\", although it would still not recognise the suitability of any man who worked with boats to race against amateurs, and another 20 years went by before the sport was finally united under one governing body.\nThe Times leader at the time congratulated the ARA and the Henley Stewards on their decision to remove this \"invidious bar\", and remarked that most oarsmen had long regarded it as a blot on the sport. \nIn 1954 the NARA had around 130 affiliated clubs, compared to 245 affiliated to the ARA. Some clubs were affiliated to both governing bodies which finally amalgamated in 1956. . It was proposed to call the resulting organisation the British Amateur Rowing Association and NARA was dissolved in June of that year. (BARA as a name didn't last long and was soon shortened back to ARA)."

        "text": "The 2010 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 81st midseason exhibition between the All-Stars of the American League (AL) and the National League (NL), the two leagues comprising Major League Baseball. The game was held on July 13, 2010, at Angel Stadium of Anaheim, the home of the American League Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, and was telecast by Fox Sports in the US, with Joe Buck and Tim McCarver in the broadcast booth. Fox also teamed with DirecTV to produce a separate 3D broadcast, the first ever for a network Major League Baseball game. Kenny Albert and Mark Grace called the 3D telecast. ESPN Radio also broadcast the game, with Jon Sciambi and Dave Campbell announcing. The National League won the game 3–1, ending a 13-game winless streak.\nThis was the third All-Star Game hosted by the city of Anaheim, California, which previously hosted the game in 1967 and 1989. From 2003 to 2016, the winning team earned home field advantage for the World Series. This was the first All-Star Game the National League won since 1996, giving the NL said advantage in the World Series for the first time since 2001 – ironically, the winning pitcher, Washington Nationals closer Matt Capps, would go on to participate in the \"American\" League playoffs after his trade to the Minnesota Twins just a couple of weeks following the Midsummer Classic.\nA short memorial honoring George Steinbrenner, the owner of the New York Yankees who died early that morning, was held prior to the game.\nNew rules.\nThe 2010 All-Star Game marked the first time major changes took place since the 2003 decision to begin handing home field in the World Series to the winning league. The designated hitter became a permanent fixture of the game regardless of site (a change which became more noticeable when the game was next played in a National League park – in 2011 at Chase Field in Phoenix). But, continuing with past precedent, whereas fans voted the American League starter in, as they did in previous years when an A.L. city hosted the game, the National League's manager continued to name his team's DH before the game from the list of reserves (player-elected and manager-chosen).\nOther changes included having the rosters of each league team increased to 34 players. Pitchers who started the regular-season game on the Sunday immediately before the game became ineligible to pitch in the game, and were replaced on the roster (this rule would be invoked for three players selected for the American League squad – Trevor Cahill, CC Sabathia and Jered Weaver). As with any player ineligible or unable to play, each was still recognized as an All-Star.\nFinally, a modified re-entry rule also made its debut (though saw no usage in this contest). In addition to the existing injured catcher rule, the manager was now allowed to select one position player to re-enter a game in the event that the last available position player at any position is injured.\nFinal roster spot.\nAfter the rosters were revealed, a second ballot of five players per league was created for the All-Star Final Vote to determine the 34th and final player of each roster, with online balloting conducted from Sunday afternoon, July 4, through Thursday afternoon, July 8. The winners of the final vote were Nick Swisher of the New York Yankees and Joey Votto of the Cincinnati Reds.\n§ – When Bell replaced Yovani Gallardo due to injury on Wednesday, July 7, his name was withdrawn from the Final Vote ballot.\nRosters.\nPlayers in \"italics\" have since been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\nGame.\nGame summary.\nUMPIRES: Home Plate – Mike Reilly; First base – Mike Winters; Second base – Brian O'Nora; Third base – Laz Díaz; Left Field – Bruce Dreckman; Right Field – Jim Wolf&lt;br&gt;Weather – , clear; Wind 5 mph (8 km/h) from the southwest – out to center field.&lt;br&gt;Time of Game – 2 hours, 59 minutes. Attendance – 45,408\nPitching dominated the first half of the ballgame, as both starting pitchers and their immediate successors put up zeroes. Both teams finally threatened to score in the fifth inning. With Justin Verlander on the mound for the American League, David Wright singled and stole second. Andre Ethier singled but Josh Hamilton was able to hold Wright at third with a strong throw from right field. With runners on the corners, Verlander was able get the final two outs of the inning. In the bottom of the inning, Hong-Chih Kuo walked Evan Longoria before allowing Joe Mauer to reach first and advance to second by throwing a ball over the first baseman's head and into the dugout. With runners on second and third and no outs, Kuo and Heath Bell were able to escape the inning by limiting the damage to one unearned run on a Robinson Canó sacrifice fly.\nThe game remained quiet until the top of the seventh inning. Phil Hughes allowed two singles before being lifted in favor of Matt Thornton. After getting Chris Young to pop up, Thornton loaded the bases on a walk to Marlon Byrd before allowing a bases-clearing double down the right field line to Brian McCann. Those would be the last runs scored in the game. The American League would threaten again in the bottom of the seventh. With runners on the corners and two outs, Torii Hunter struck out swinging against Adam Wainwright to end the burgeoning rally.\nThe bottom of the ninth would provide some drama, both on the field and in the dugout. With Jonathan Broxton in to close the game, David Ortiz hit a leadoff single to right. However, Ortiz was not lifted for a pinch runner although American League manager Joe Girardi still had Alex Rodriguez available on the bench. After Broxton struck out Adrián Beltré, Ortiz was thrown out advancing to second on a strong throw from Marlon Byrd on a John Buck single. In a controversial decision, Girardi allowed Ian Kinsler to bat despite having Rodriguez available to pinch-hit, and Kinsler subsequently flew out to center. His out not only ended the ballgame, it also ended the American League's run of dominance in the Midsummer Classic. This was also the second straight All-Star Game without a home run hit by either side.\nEntertainment.\nThe Canadian Tenors performed the Canadian national anthem in English and French. Amber Riley sang the American national anthem and Beautiful by Christina Aguilera. Colbie Caillat sang God Bless America during the seventh inning stretch."

Since 1984 the Korean team has not only participated constantly in Olympic Games but also ranked among the top four nations every time until 2012. Korea grabbed the gold medal in 1988 and 1992, won the silver medal in 1984, 1996, 2004 and took bronze medal in 2008. They have earned two World Championship medals so far: In 1995, they also won the World Championship title in Austria/Hungary 1995 World Women's Handball Championship, they came off third to secure the bronze medal at the Croatia in 2003 World Women's Handball Championship. It is a twelve time Asian Champion, the tournament has been won by any other nation only twice.\nBoth the men's and women's and children's teams failed to qualify in the regional qualifiers for the 2008 Beijing Olympics in 2007 August due to the biased refereeing, but the International Handball Federation ordered replays of both qualifying tournaments after acknowledging biased officiating by Middle Eastern referees. South Korea beat Japan in both the men's and women's matches and qualified for the Beijing Olympic Games in 2008 January. However, the Executive Committee of the Kuwait-based federation, which had rejected the International Handball Federation's ruling to hold the replays, agreed to fine Japan and South Korea $1,000 and issued a warning to both countries. In addition, the Asian Handball Federation appealed the IHF's decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which ruled the Asian women's qualification invalid and forced the Korean ladies to play in the final Olympic qualifying tournament. The replay was decided to be invalid by the Court. The Korean women's team earned their ticket to the Beijing Olympics at the Olympic qualifying game held at Nîmes, France.\nIn the semi-final match of 2008 Beijing Olympic games with Norway, Norway's deciding goal was requested to be annulled by the Korean delegation, because they claimed the ball had not crossed the goal line before the end whistle of the game. Korea's appeal was turned down by the IHF's Disciplinary Commission, confirming the end result to be 29–28 in favor of Norway.\nThe 2008 film \"Forever the Moment\" is a fictionalized account of the teams' journey to the 2004 Athens Olympics.\nTeam.\nCurrent squad.\nRoster for the 2023 World Women's Handball Championship.\nHead coach: Henrik Signell"

        "title": "European Champions League (table tennis)",
        "text": "European Champions League (ECL) is the seasonal table tennis competition for the highest ranked European club teams and is regarded as the most important international club competition in Europe. It is organised by the European Table Tennis Union (ETTU) and replaced the European Club Cup of Champions (ECCC), the previous prominent club competition, since the 1998/99 season. Originally there was only a men's competition; a women's competition was introduced in the 2005/06 season. The competition starts in September and the champions are usually determined in May in recent years.\nGerman club Borussia Düsseldorf is the most successful club in the history of the men's competition, having won the competition seven times and being the runners-up three times, while Belgian club La Villette Charleroi and Russian club Fakel Gazprom both have won five titles.\nIn the women's competition, TTC Berlin Eastside from Germany has won the league five times, making it the most successful club.\nHistory.\nThe Men's Champions League was first organised in the 1998/99 season, with the aim to replace the European Club Cup of Champions, the previous highest level European club competition held since 1960/61 season. In the second season (99/00), the playing system was changed. The maximum number of games had been reduced from seven to five, and the double had been cancelled, with the aim of having a better presentation on TV and more excitement for the spectators. The competition came into a new era in 2005/06, when the Women's Champions League started with eight clubs and the men's league was expanded from 8 to 16 clubs, enabling a greater number of nations to participate. These changes were undertaken in the hopes of making table tennis more popular in a European level as well as motivating the coming generation. However, the number of teams in the women's competition decreased from eight to six in season 09/10.\nIn season 10/11, because of the global financial crisis, there were just four teams entering the women's competition, a number lower than the previous year (there were six teams in season 09/10). As a result, the women's competition was suspended for one year. The men's competition was also affected, causing the number of teams to decrease from 16 to 14.\nThe women's competition resumed in season 11/12, with six teams entering the competition. The number of teams in the men's competition was also restored to 16.\nQualification.\nOnly teams from any top National Leagues have the right to enter in the competition.\nFor the men's competition, the 4 semi-finalists of the previous year are automatically included in the competition. The remaining 12 places are filled by the 12 teams with the highest total number of ranking points for their three best ranked players on the current world ranking, with only one \"foreign player\" being considered.\nFor the women's league, the previous year's two finalists compete in the competition with the six teams with the highest total number of ranking points for their three best ranked players, also with only one \"foreign player\" being considered.\nMoreover, there is a limitation on the number of clubs from the same nations. Not more than 4 or 3 clubs, men's and women's respectively, from the same association are entitled the right to enter in the competition. In the men's competition, if the semi-finalists of the previous year came from the same association and a 5th team has the highest ranking points, the ranking of the final national team championships would decide on the qualification.\nFormat.\nThe league is completed in two stages. The first stage is the group round robin matches while the second stage is the straight 2-leg knock-out stage.\nFor the men's league, the 16 teams are divided into four groups within which they play round robin matches. The four teams with the highest ranking points will be seeded and play in the four groups respectively. During the group stage, 2 match points are awarded for a win, 1 for a loss and 0 for a loss in a not played or unfinished match, and the ranking order is determined by the numbers of match points gained.\nIf two or more teams have gained the same number of match points, their relative position are determined by the results only of the matches between them, taking successively the numbers of match points, the ratios of wins to losses in individual matches, games and points, as far as it is necessary to resolve the order. Lot is used to determine the position if teams are equal in all of the above criteria.\nThe top two teams in each group qualified for the knock-out stage. Those eight teams would play in a single knock-out system, with quarter-finals, semi-finals and finals, to determine the winner of the competition. At any stages two legs, home and away, are played for each tie, and teams win the tie if they win both legs. If each team wins one leg, the result is determined by aggregate score first in individual matches, then in games and finally in points.\nThe women's competition is held in similar format, with the exception that the six teams are divided into two groups and the two teams with the highest ranking points would be the seeds.\nPlaying system.\nThe competition is played under the new Swaythling Cup system (best of 5 singles). A team consists of 3 players selected from those nominated for the event. The opposite teams play 5 single matches with the match order A v X, B v Y, C v Z, A v Y, B v X. The team match will end if one of the teams has won 3 matches.\nComposition of teams.\nA club may nominate up to 8 players for the entire event, within which there can be a maximum of 2 foreign players. Only 1 foreign player can play in each team match and only players who have participated in at least 50% of the group matches are eligible to play the second stage. Reserve players being present in the hall would be considered as participants of the match, if confirmed on the result sheet by the referee.\nEach player can only play for one club in a season. This regulation also applies to players taking part in any other team competition on the national level under the authority of an ITTF member association, except commitments for their national team."

        "text": "Richard Frank Barker (born October 29, 1972) is a former right-handed relief pitcher in Major League Baseball for the Chicago Cubs. Barker's major league career consisted of just five games in the 1999 season.\nBarker was drafted by the Cubs in the 37th round (1,030th overall) of the 1994 amateur draft out of Quinsigamond Community College. Only three other players drafted in that round made the majors-- Bronson Heflin, Matt Blank, and Mike Lincoln. Barker was one of only four Cubs draftees (out of 75) that year who eventually made the big leagues. The only player drafted later than Barker that year by the Cubs to make the leap was Kyle Farnsworth, a 47th round selection.\nBarker made his debut with the Cubs on April 25, 1999, throwing 1 innings against the New York Mets and allowing one run on three hits. He'd make four more appearances in relief, including his final game on May 5, 1999. Barker's final statistics featured no wins, losses, or saves, an ERA of 7.20, four walks, and three strikeouts. After returning to the AAA Iowa Cubs after his cup of coffee with the parent club, Barker was unable to make it back to the majors. He pitched just 20 games in the minors in 2000 before he then retired from baseball due to an injury and moved to a suburb of Phoenix, Arizona, where he married and started a small sports business."

        "text": "Collegiate fencing in the United States can be traced back to as early as 1941. Some of the earliest programs in the US came from the Ivy League schools, with the first Ivy League fencing championships taking place in 1956. As of 2023, there are 112 club teams, 43 women's varsity fencing programs and 33 men's varsity teams in the US. Both clubs and varsity teams participate in the sport, however only the varsity teams may participate in the NCAA championship tournament. Due to the limited number of colleges that have fencing teams, NCAA fencing combines the three divisions into a combined National Collegiate sport, all participating in one NCAA Championship.\nTournament Format.\nRegular season tournaments.\nCollegiate fencing tournaments are \"team tournaments\", but unlike team matches in national and international level competitions, collegiate meets are not run as 45-touch relays. Schools compete against each other one at a time. In each weapon and gender, three fencers from each school fence three fencers on the opposing team in five-touch bouts. Substitutions are allowed, so more than three fencers per squad can compete in a tournament. A total of nine bouts are fenced, and the school with the most bouts won, wins the match. A fencer's individual results in collegiate tournaments and regional championships are used to select the fencers who will compete in NCAA championships. To qualify for the NCAA Regional competition, a fencer needs to meet the minimum win percentage and bout participation rate set by the NCAA.\nPost-season tournaments.\nClub fencing.\nCollegiate fencing clubs participate in a championship hosted by the United States Association of Collegiate Fencing Clubs in the spring.\nNCAA fencing.\nFencers that qualify for the Regionals compete in one of four regions: Northeast, Mid-Atlantic/South, Midwest, and West. Unlike regular season tournaments, fencers compete as individuals. Athletes qualify for the NCAA Fencing Championship based on their finishing position in the regionals along with their regular season performance. All regional competition are conducted using a pool format that includes a minimum one round of pools. The minimum number of finalists must be at least equal to the number of regional allocations plus two. Each region has a varying number of qualifiers allocated by the NCAA. Up to 12 fencers per school can participate in the event.\nIn the Championship, fencers compete in a round-robin of 24 fencers in five-touch bouts. The top four fencers in each event fence direct elimination, 15-touch semifinals and championship bouts. No more than 2 fencers from each weapon per gender can be selected from one institution. A pre-championship manual is provided to the coaches of all NCAA fencing team that includes information on rules, formats and important dates. An institution’s final place in the final round of the championships will be based on points earned by each individual. Each team is awarded one point for each individual’s five-touch bout victory fencing in the round robin of 24 and results from the top four finals bouts do not count toward team standings.\nMany college teams are also members of athletic conferences and compete in conference championships. The Ivy League, Atlantic Coast Conference and the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation are the only major conferences to sponsor fencing. Other conferences include the Central Collegiate Fencing Conference, the New England Intercollegiate Fencing Conference and the women's team only Eastern Women's Fencing Conference. Teams can be members of multiple conferences and hence compete in more than one conference championship. \nScholarships.\nAccording to official NCAA regulations, colleges are limited to granting five full (\"free ride\") fencing scholarships per year for women and 4.5 for men."

        "title": "High school fencing",
        "text": "Fencing at the high school level has varied in popularity.\nEurope.\nIn many European countries fencing is growing more popular each year. In Scotland many new competitions have arisen to get these new fencers into fencing at higher levels, such as the Leon Paul Youth Development series where fencers fit in as much fencing as possible against as many of those in their age and weapon group to gain experience.\nUnited States.\nFencing was once a part of many schools' physical education (PE) curriculum, and many schools had clubs and would compete in inter-school tournaments. In the second half of the 20th century, fencing gradually faded from physical education curricula in the United States. This has been attributed to worries about 'weapons in schools' or that it requires expensive equipment. Fencers dispute the characterization of fencing foils as weapons since they fail to meet the applicable criteria - a tool of injury or destruction - since foils are engineered specifically to contact the human body without injury.\nHowever, youth fencing has remained a club sport at some schools, and the last several years have seen an increase in fencing clubs and tournaments at the high school level. The United States Fencing Association has encouraged this through the Regional Youth Circuit program. High school fencing season is generally in winter.\nHigh school fencing has also gained a renewed following in the United States, evidenced by the establishment of state leagues, and an increase in Junior level national competitors.\nHigh school competitive fencing has grown significantly in the state of New Jersey, one of the few states where it remains a varsity sport. The league is growing steadily, and there are currently 55 varsity programs in the state. The New Jersey Interscholastic Fencing Association includes Montgomery High School, The Pingry School, Voorhees High School, and more. \nGeorgia in particular has seen growing interest in high school fencing. The Georgia High School Fencing League was founded in 2004 and in the 2013–14 season numbers 17 schools and over 350 fencers. Member schools hold their own practices and come together about once a month during the fall and winter seasons to fence other member schools, primarily in épée. Additionally, the On Guard High School League of Georgia was created to allow high school fencers to fence all three weapons (épée, foil and sabre). This league was formed in 2010 in the 2012–13 season numbered seven schools and over 150 fencers.\nThe North Carolina Fencing League has grown to include Chapel Hill High School, Elkin High School, Morehead High School, East Chapel Hill High School, the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, Bishop McGuinness High School in Kernersville, Cape Fear Fencing Association of Wilmington, Salem Academy, Epiphany School of Global Studies, Reynolds High School and even a non-North Carolina school, Carlisle Preparatory Academy in Martinsville, Virginia. The latest champion of the league is East Chapel Hill High.\nThe Great Lakes High School Fencing Conference, consisting of schools in Illinois, Wisconsin and Indiana, was founded in 1981. Current information about GLHSFC membership, rules and competition schedules can be found on the New Trier HS Fencing Team page.\nThere is also a detailed history of high school fencing in Illinois from 1903–2013, written by Robert Prueter, on the web site of the IHSA (Illinois High School Association) - \"Fencing: A Long-time Illinois Sport\"."

        "title": "Baseball uniform",
        "text": "A baseball uniform is a type of uniform worn by baseball players, coaches and managers. \nMost baseball uniforms have the names and uniform numbers of players who wear them, usually on the backs of the uniforms to distinguish players from each other. Baseball shirts (jerseys), pants, shoes, socks, caps, and gloves are parts of baseball uniforms. Most uniforms have different logos and colors to aid players, officials, and spectators in distinguishing the two teams from each other and the officials.\nBaseball uniforms were first worn by the New York Knickerbockers Baseball Club in 1849. Today, sales of replica uniforms and derivative branded products generate large amounts of income for Major League teams through merchandising.\nHistory.\nEarly developments.\nThe New York Knickerbockers were the first baseball team to wear uniforms, taking the field on April 4, 1849, in pants made of blue wool, white flannel shirts and straw hats.\nThe practice of wearing a uniform soon spread, and by 1900, all Major League Baseball teams had adopted them.\nBy 1882 most uniforms included stockings, which covered the leg from foot to knee, and were used to differentiate one club from another. The uniforms themselves had different colors and patterns that reflected the different baseball positions. \nIn the late 1880s, the Detroit Wolverines and Washington Nationals of the National League and the Brooklyn Bridegrooms of the American Association were the first to wear striped uniforms.\nHome and road uniforms.\nBy the end of the 19th century, teams began the practice of wearing one of two different uniforms, one when they played in their own baseball stadium and a different one when they played on the road. It became common to wear white at home and one of gray, solid dark blue, or black on the road. An early example of this is the Brooklyn Superbas, who started to use a blue pattern for their road uniforms in 1907.\nIn 1916, on the New York Giants' road uniforms, purple lines gave their uniforms a tartan-like effect, and another kind of road uniform was a solid dark blue or black material with white around this time. The Kansas City Athletics' home and road uniforms were changed by Charles O. Finley in 1963, to the colors of gold and green. Some teams used light blue for their road uniforms from the 1970s to the early 1990s. Early striped patterns developed into long stripes along the length of the uniforms, called pinstriping. This was first worn on some major league baseball team's uniforms in 1907, and the pinstripes were then widened in 1912, so that the crowd could see them more clearly.\nThe Chicago Cubs were wearing pinstripes in 1907\nThe Brooklyn Bridegrooms used checked uniforms in 1889, and brought them back in 1907 (as the Superbas) and 1916–1917 (as the Robins). Satin uniforms were developed by several teams including the Brooklyn Dodgers for night games, as the sheen of the fabric was more reflective and thus easier to see. Pinstripes were commonly worn on the uniforms of the New York Yankees. Legend had it that the stripes were adopted to make Babe Ruth look slimmer, but since the Yankees had already been wearing pinstripes a few years before Ruth played for them in 1920, the legend is most likely a myth. The Yankees' pinstripes on their home uniforms soon became a team symbol.\nIn 1916, the Cleveland Indians became the first team to add numbers on their uniforms, positioned on the left sleeve of the home uniforms only. (Okkonen, p. 36, p. 120) In 1929, numbers were first added on the backs of uniforms by the New York Yankees and the Cleveland Indians. By 1932, all major league baseball teams had numbers on their players' uniforms. The Brooklyn Dodgers, in 1952, became the first baseball team to add numbers to the fronts of their uniforms. In 1960, the Chicago White Sox were the first team to place players' names on the back of their jerseys, doing so on their road jerseys; within a few years, this practice became almost universal in MLB, though to this day the Yankees have only worn names on their uniforms for Players Weekend, a discontinued event (2017-2019) where alternate uniforms with nicknames were used.\nIn most parts of the world, numbers are no more than two digits long; however, Japanese players who are on their team's developmental roster have three-digit numbers. Major league teams typically assign the highest numbers (#50 and above) in spring training to the players who are not expected to make the regular-season roster; hence the lower numbers are considered more prestigious, although there are many veterans who wear high numbers anyway. Two Hall of Famers who wore high numbers are Don Drysdale, who wore #53 for the Brooklyn and Los Angeles Dodgers, and Carlton Fisk, who wore #72 for the Chicago White Sox (reverse of the #27 he wore with the Boston Red Sox; Fisk also was the American League Rookie of the Year in 1972).\nControversy over major league baseball teams' newly redesigned uniforms erupted during spring training in 2024. Major League Baseball debuted a slate of new uniforms that were designed by Nike and manufactured by Fanatics. Many players were upset with the way the jerseys looked, saying that the smaller numbers and letters made them feel as if they were wearing replicas. One player complained that the team name on jerseys for the Philadelphia Phillies was off-center. Concerns about the new uniform pants included the observation that tucked in jerseys were visible through home white pants. In response, Nike issued a statement saying that \"We will continue to work with MLB, the players, and our manufacturing partner to address player uniforms.\"\nCap styles.\nCaps, or other types of headgear with eye-shades, have been a part of baseball uniforms from the beginning.\nFrom the 1840s to the 1870s, baseball players wore various types of hats, or even no cap at all, since there was no official rule regarding headgear. Examples included full-brimmed straw hats such as boating caps, jockey caps, cycling caps, and flat-topped caps.\nThe Brooklyn Excelsiors was the first team to wear what would later become the modern baseball cap, with its distinctive rounded top and peak, in the 1860s. By the early years of the twentieth century, this style of cap had become common, but some teams occasionally revived the flat-topped cap, such as the New York Giants in 1916 and the Pittsburgh Pirates as recently as during the 1979 World Series. Over time, the peak has enlarged slightly to further protect the player's eyes from the sun. More recently, players have worn hats with fold-down ear flaps in cold weather.\nShoes.\nIn the late 19th century, soft but durable leather shoes were the preferred choice of baseball players.\nIn the 1970s, as artificial turf became prominent on developed countries' baseball fields, modifications to footwear became necessary. Detachable spikes became popular in the 20th century, as they helped players to avoid slipping, especially on turf, but they were banned in 1976.\nIn the 19th century and the first part of the 20th, baseball shoes were commonly black in color. In the 1960s, the Kansas City Athletics began wearing revolutionary white shoes, a tradition carried over when they moved to Oakland. Since then, some teams are wearing colored cleats corresponding to their team colors. For example, the Philadelphia Phillies and St. Louis Cardinals now wear red cleats, the Chicago Cubs and the Los Angeles Dodgers wear blue cleats, and some of the San Francisco Giants players wear orange cleats. In recent years, however, players are now allowed to wear cleats regardless of team color, and often customize them as a form of self-expression.\nStockings and pants.\nInspired by the Cincinnati Red Stockings, the stocking colors of teams in the 1860s onward were a principal device in distinguishing one team from another (hence team names such as the Chicago White Stockings, St. Louis Brown Stockings (or Browns), etc.). Except for a few \"candy-cane\" varieties (particularly by the New York Giants, St. Louis Cardinals and Washington Senators), striping was quite minimal during the 1920s and, in contrast, a revival of other sorts in the early 1930s.\nBy the 1990s, new styles of close-trimmed pants legs made it possible for players to wear pants that ran clear to the shoetops, in lieu of the traditional knee-breeches style that had prevailed for generations. This led to a violation of the literal concept of a \"uniform\", in that different players on a given team might wear knee-length and full-length pants on the field at the same time. Players such as Manny Ramirez took this fashion trend to an extreme, wearing loose-fitting pants whose legs nearly lapped under the heels of the shoes. Some, such as Gary Sheffield, even developed straps that hooked under the cleats. Meanwhile, players such as Alfonso Soriano continued to wear the traditional knee-breeches, though most of these players still lacked the traditional stirrups.\nBy the end of the first decade of the 21st century, nearly all players wore either traditional knee-high socks or pants that covered the shoetops and contained no elastic in the bottom. Such loose-fitting pants were called \"pro-flare\", as they are worn by most major league players. However, a few older players, like Derek Jeter, wore pants that stopped right at the shoes, like the style of the late 1990s/early 2000s.\nIn recent years teams that wear throwback uniforms usually outfit themselves with stirrups or knee-breeches, to simulate the look of a particular era. In addition, some teams began to wear stockings with stripes. Examples include the Tampa Bay Rays sporting Columbia blue and white striping on their navy stockings, the St. Louis Cardinals with navy and white stripes on their red stockings, and the San Francisco Giants in black stockings with orange stripes.\nGraphics and logos.\nFrom the beginning, graphic designs were used to identify teams. Often an Old English letter was worn on the chest. This style survives with the Detroit Tigers and their gothic style \"D\" on their home jerseys and caps and the Oakland Athletics, who currently have an Old English \"A\" on their caps and their alternative jerseys.\nAs official nicknames gained prominence in the early 1900s (in contrast to media-generated and unofficial nicknames of prior generations), pictorial logos began emerging as part of the team's marketing. Some early examples include a small red tiger on the black cap of the 1901 Detroit Tigers, as they were officially the Tigers from the beginning; and a bear cub logo on the Chicago Cubs shirts by 1907, as that unofficial nickname was then adopted officially by the club.\nIn another famous example, the Boston Americans (an unofficial designation that merely distinguished them from their across-the-tracks rivals) adopted the Nationals' abandoned red stockings in , and have been the Boston Red Sox officially ever since then.\nBy the 1930s, nearly every team had distinctive logos, letters or the team nickname on their home shirts, as part of the team's marketing. The trend of the city name on the road jerseys continued. In recent years, with team nicknames being so strongly associated with the clubs, logos that were once only used at home also turned up on road jerseys, in place of city names."

They just planted them. It's some large conspiracy. He does not believe that dinosaurs ever existed and he thinks that mermaids are real. I love dinosaurs, so we have a big point of contention.\"\nIn a 2016 segment on HBO's \"Hard Knocks\", it was revealed that Hayes is a firm believer in mermaids. According to head coach Jeff Fisher, \"I remember him getting really excited about the potential for moving out here [from St. Louis to Los Angeles] because he knew he would be closer to mermaids here on the West Coast.\"\nOn an episode of \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" in November 2016, Hayes toured the Dinosaur Hall at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County with Kimmel and a paleontologist, Daniel Caballero. He claimed that all of the skeletons and fossils were fake and had been planted by people in order to allow for the supposed discovery of the fossils by paleontologists. This visit further solidified his denial of the existence of dinosaurs. However, the visit reinforced his belief in the existence of mermaids after a short discussion about the potential for the future discovery of the species. He also briefly discussed his belief of unicorns in the episode. "

The top-ranked Ohio State Buckeyes of the Big Ten Conference defeated the defending national champions - #2 USC Trojans of the Pacific-8 Conference, 27–16. Sophomore quarterback Rex Kern of Ohio State was the Player of the Game.\nHeisman Trophy winner O. J. Simpson rushed for 171 yards and an 80-yard touchdown run, but USC had five turnovers, including an interception and a fumble by Simpson. It was only the second #1 vs. #2 matchup in the Rose Bowl, the first was six years earlier. It was the first time in the history of the Big 9(Ten) – PCC/Big Ten – AAWU agreements that two unbeaten teams met in the Rose Bowl.\nIt was the first of four Rose Bowl matchups between the head coaches; Woody Hayes of Ohio State and USC's John McKay. It was the first of three with the national championship on the line for both schools.\nTeams.\nThis was only the second time in the Rose Bowl where the #1 and #2 teams in the AP Poll played and only the third time in a bowl game: the 1963 Rose Bowl was the first and the 1964 Cotton Bowl Classic was the second. It was the 12th time overall that the #1 and #2 team faced each other since the inception of the AP Poll in 1936. The Bowl Coalition, Bowl Alliance, BCS, and College Football Playoff were created later to make at least one matchup of the top two teams in the nation.\nOhio State Buckeyes.\nThe Buckeyes featured a group called \"The Super Sophomores\" playing in their first varsity season: John Brockington, Leo Hayden, Rex Kern, Jim Otis, Jim Stillwagon, and Jack Tatum. \nThe Buckeyes throttled #4 Michigan 50–14 to complete the regular season, and were favored in the Rose Bowl by 3½ points.\nUSC Trojans.\nThe defending national champion Trojans finished undefeated with one tie, which occurred at the end of the regular season against ninth-ranked Notre Dame. They had been ranked first since October 14, but dropped to second after Ohio State routed #4 Michigan; USC stayed in that runner-up position even after the 21–21 tie on November 30. They were captained by Heisman Trophy winner O. J. Simpson; it was the third of four consecutive Rose Bowl appearances for USC.\nGame summary.\nThis Rose Bowl was also the beginning of a celebration of a century of college football. Later during the 1969 season, many teams wore uniform patches or helmet stickers with \"100\" to signify the centennial.\nA number of celebrities were present, including President-elect Richard Nixon, Bob Hope, California Governor and future United States President Ronald Reagan and his wife Nancy Reagan, and former Oklahoma head coach and then-ABC analyst Bud Wilkinson. First Lady Pat Nixon was a graduate of USC, but President Nixon spent time on both sidelines. Richard Nixon called the Rose Bowl Game, \"the prize game of all bowl games.\"\nAfter O. J. Simpson scored on an 80-yard run to give USC a 10–0 lead, a Trojans fumble at their 21-yard line set up a Rex Kern pass to Leo Hayden for the final four yards. A fumbled reception cost Southern Cal the ball again at its own 16. USC had five turnovers, including two by Simpson. Simpson, besides having a fumble and interception, also underestimated the speed of Jack Tatum, the Ohio State cornerback. This happened on a swing pass that should have been a touchdown, and then on the same series when Simpson overthrew a touchdown pass to Ted DeKraai. Ohio State had one fumble, but managed to keep possession.\nAftermath.\nThe following season, Ohio State was stunned in defense of their national title against Michigan, led by first-year head coach Bo Schembechler, in one of the most notable games in the rivalry. When the Super Sophomores were seniors in 1970, OSU went undefeated in the regular season and returned to Pasadena in January 1971, but was upset by Stanford, led by Heisman Trophy winner Jim Plunkett, the first pick of the 1971 NFL Draft.\nAfter losing this Rose Bowl, the Pac-8/10 dominated the series for the next two decades, winning the next four Rose Bowls, ten of the next eleven, and sixteen of the next eighteen.\nThe next Rose Bowl that matched the #1 and #2 teams was thirty-three years later in January 2002, with Miami (Big East) and Nebraska (Big 12), in the BCS National Championship Game."

The third-ranked Iowa Hawkeyes of the Big Ten Conference defeated the #10 Oregon State Beavers of the Pacific Coast Conference by a score of 35–19, in a rematch of a regular season contest in early October at Iowa City, where the home team rallied to win, 14–13.\nIowa quarterback Ken Ploen was named the Player of the Game.\nThis was the first trip to Pasadena for both teams: it was Iowa's first bowl appearance and Oregon State's second. The Beavers won the Rose Bowl fifteen years earlier in January 1942, which was moved to Durham, North Carolina.\nGame summary.\nPloen completed nine of ten passes and rushed for 59 yards, including a 49-yard run for Iowa's first score. Collins Hagler scored twice for the Hawkeyes, the second on a 66-yard run. For Oregon State, Joe Francis ran for 73 yards and was ten of twelve passing for 73 yards and a touchdown. The Beavers were hurt by three fumbles, two in the first seven minutes, and both led to Iowa touchdowns. The Hawkeyes led 21–6 at halftime and were up by 23 points early in the fourth quarter. OSC closed the margin to sixteen points with under ten minutes remaining, but that was the last of the scoring and Iowa won 35–19."

        "text": "The 1920 Rose Bowl, known at the time as the Tournament East-West Football Game, was a college football bowl game in Pasadena, California, played on January 1, 1920. In the sixth Rose Bowl, the once-tied Harvard Crimson met the once-defeated Oregon Webfoots at Tournament Park; Harvard won with all of the scoring in the second quarter.\nCrimson halfback Edward Casey was named the Rose Bowl Player of the Game when the award was created in 1953 and selections were made retroactively. It was the first Rose Bowl game following World War I in which college football returned to the Tournament of Roses. The two previous Tournament games had featured teams from the United States armed forces.\nThis game established a pattern of inviting a team from the Eastern half of the United States to face one from the West Coast. Except for the 1944 game during World War II, this continued until the advent of the Bowl Championship Series game in January 2002.\nGame summary.\nFollowing a field goal by future Oregon Sports Hall of Famer Bill Steers, Harvard scored on a 13-yard run by Fred Church on a drive that was keyed by two catches by future College Football Hall of Famer Eddie Casey. Arnold Horween added the extra point, which would prove critical as Oregon could only manage one more score, a field goal from Skeet Manerud. Four other Oregon kicks were blocked or missed, including a fourth-quarter Manerud attempt that just missed.\nAftermath.\nThe 1919 Harvard team was undefeated, with two close calls; the only blemish was a come-from-behind tie at Princeton on November 8. Oregon finished with two losses; during the regular season, the Webfoots fell 7−0 to Washington State in Portland, also on November 8."

In honour of the International Ice Hockey Federation's (IIHF) 100th anniversary, the World Championship was hosted in Canada for the first time. Held in Quebec City and Halifax, Canada, the 2008 IIHF World Championship was the 72nd edition of the tournament. Russia won the Championship, the second time they had done so and their 24th title if including those won by the Soviet Union. Dany Heatley of Canada led the tournament in scoring with 20 points, and was named the tournament's most valuable player and top forward. Canadian Brent Burns was named top defenceman, while Evgeni Nabokov of Russia was selected as top goaltender.\nBefore the start of the World Championship, each participating nation had to submit a list of players for its roster. A minimum of 15 skaters and two goaltenders, and a maximum of 20 skaters and three goaltenders had to be selected. If a country selected fewer than the maximum allowed, they had to choose the remaining players prior to the start of the tournament. After the start of the tournament, each team was allowed to select an additional two players, either skaters or goaltenders, to their roster, for a maximum roster of 25 players. Once a player was registered to the team, he could not be removed from the roster.\nTo qualify for a national team under IIHF rules, a player must follow several criteria. He must be a citizen of the nation, and be under the jurisdiction of that national ice hockey association. Players are allowed to switch which national team they play for, providing they fulfill the IIHF criteria. If participating for the first time in an IIHF event, the player would have had to play two consecutive years in the national competition of the new country, without playing in another nation. If the player has already played for a national team before, he may switch nationality if he is a citizen of the new country, and has played for four consecutive years in the national competition of the new country. This switch may only happen once in the player's life."

        "text": "Thomas H. Barlow (1852–?) was an American Major League Baseball player who played as a catcher and shortstop for three different teams in his entire four-year career, spent entirely in the National Association. Barlow is credited as the pioneer of the bunt.\nCareer.\nIn , Barlow played catcher and shortstop in for the Star club of Brooklyn, who were one of the top amateur teams in the country. The Stars played many exhibition games against professional teams from the newly-established National Association. They won the championship of the short-lived National Association of Amateur Base Ball Players, and are credited with a 30-13 won-loss record. Future Hall of Famer Candy Cummings was one of Barlow's teammates.\nBarlow moved up to the next level the next season in , beginning his professional career with the National Association's Brooklyn Atlantics. He played 37 championship games, most of them as catcher, along with four games at shortstop. He hit well that season, hitting .310, and scored 34 runs. In , he caught 53 games, becoming the second player credited with catching all of his team's games, a feat that has been accomplished just seven times, the latest occurring in when Mike Tresh caught all 150 of the Chicago White Sox' games.\nBarlow stated several years after the fact that he sustained an injury to his side during the season while catching pitcher Cherokee Fisher, while playing for the Hartford Dark Blues. Later, when he was being treated at his hotel room, a physician administered a morphine injection, which began his addiction to the drug, and subsequently, he lost his baseball career to it. Barlow documented his troubles in a letter, which is read by actor David Caruso in Ken Burns's 1994 documentary, Baseball. In the letter, he lamented on how he was once the catcher for the Mutuals, and the Atlantics, \"but no one would know it by looking at me now.\" He also said \"I'd had rather died behind the bat, than have had that first dose.\" \nThe specific details in the letter are mostly, but not totally, supported by the historical record. Fisher and Barlow were indeed teammates with the 1874 Hartford Dark Blues. Fisher started 35 of the Dark Blues' 53 games. Barlow was however a shortstop that season, playing in 32 games. Barlow says the injury happened when the Dark Blues were playing the Chicago White Stockings in Chicago on August 10, 1874, but the record shows that on that date the Dark Blues were playing at home against the Philadelphia Athletics, and Bill Stearns was Hartford's starting pitcher.\nBarlow was taken out in the middle of the game that day, which was highly unusual at the time. He skipped Hartford's next game, but returned to the lineup for five games, before missing the rest of the season. His last appearance on September 10, 1874 was indeed against the White Stockings, but it was a home game for the Dark Blues. He was hospitalized for a while in the fall of 1874, and at one point was rumored to have died.\nDuring the 1874-1875 off-season, he was one of several players who got into trouble by signing contracts with multiple National Association teams. He accepted advance payments from his old team the Atlantics as well as the newly-admitted New Haven Elm Citys.\nBarlow ended up playing two National Association games in , one each for the Elm Citys and the Atlantics. The 1875 Atlantics set a major-league record for futility which still stands: their won-loss record was 2-42 (.045). Ironically, the Atlantics' wins were both against New Haven, whose won-loss record was 7-40 (.149). It is unknown if Barlow participated in either game. It is known that Barlow played the second and last game of his season with the Atlantics on July 30, 1875. He was their second baseman for their 6-3 loss at home to the Chicago White Stockings.\nIn September 1877, Barlow was arrested for shoplifting in New York City. He told the court that he was under the influence of opium, and that his addiction began four years earlier when he was a catcher for Hartford. (In 1873, he was a catcher, but with the Brooklyn Atlantics.) \nCurrently, there is no information of his life after baseball, to include where he lived, or where he died. He can be found in the 1880 census as living with his parents in Brooklyn and his occupation is listed as \"ball player.\""

        "text": "The Louisiana State University Rugby Football Club, often referred to as LSU Rugby, represents Louisiana State University in college rugby and rugby sevens. The team is part of the Southeastern Collegiate Rugby Conference (SCRC) and they play their home matches at the UREC Field Complex on LSU's campus.\nHistory.\nThe LSU Rugby team dates back to 1970, founded by Rob Haswell, Jay McKenna and Hal Rose. LSU won the 1976 college rugby unofficial national tournament.\nLSU Rugby became a member of the Texas Rugby Union in 1996. LSU Rugby competed at the 1998 Western Rugby Collegiate Championships, led by Head Coach Steve Triche.\nIn 2005, Scott McLean was named head coach of the LSU Rugby team. In the 2008-09 season, the team won the SEC rugby title in the fall, and in the spring advanced to the quarterfinals of the Division I national rugby tournament. During the 2009-2010 season, LSU went to its second consecutive Sweet 16 appearance, but lost to Penn State 31–25. LSU players Adam Ducoing, Bobby Johns, and Cody Cadella were named to the Collegiate All-American teams at the conclusion of the 2009-10 season.\nLSU Rugby joined the College Premier Division (later named Division 1-A), where they played in the Mid-South conference against teams such as Texas A&amp;M and Oklahoma.\nLSU competed at the 2011 Collegiate Rugby Championship, a tournament held at PPL Park in Philadelphia and broadcast on NBC. LSU finished in ninth place, winning the consolation bracket with victories over Boston College, North Carolina, and Notre Dame.\nLSU Rugby joined the Southeastern Collegiate Rugby Conference in 2011.

        "title": "Florida Gators baseball",
        "text": "The Florida Gators baseball team represents the University of Florida in the sport of baseball. Florida competes in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA), and the Eastern Division of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). They play their home games in Condron Ballpark on the university's Gainesville, Florida, campus, and are currently led by head coach Kevin O'Sullivan. In the 105-season history of the Florida baseball program, the team has won 16 SEC championships and has appeared in 13 College World Series tournaments. The Gators won their first national championship in 2017.\nHistory.\nThe modern University of Florida was created in 1905 when the Florida Legislature passed the Buckman Act, and thereby consolidated the university's four predecessor institutions into the new \"University of the State of Florida.\" The university fielded its first varsity baseball team, and enjoyed its first winning baseball season, in 1912.\nDuring most of Florida baseball's early existence, the new university's athletic association suffered from a lack of financial resources, and few of the head baseball coaches were full-time baseball coaches. William G. Kline was also the athletic director, head football coach, and head basketball coach; James L. White was Florida's athletic director and head basketball coach; Brady Cowell, Ben Clemons and Lewie Hardage were assistant football coaches; and Sam McAllister was the head basketball coach and an assistant football coach. A notable exception was Lance Richbourg, who was a Florida alumnus and a Major League Baseball outfielder for the Boston Braves and others, and led the Gators to an impressive 39–21 overall record (a .650 winning percentage) in 1922, 1923 and 1926. McAllister was the Gators' last pre-World War II coach, and he returned from military service to lead the Gators baseball team again in 1946 and 1947.\nFuller era: (1948–1975).\nThe modern post-war era of the Florida Baseball program began with head coach Dave Fuller assuming control in 1948. Fuller was originally hired as a physical education instructor in 1946, and also served as an assistant football coach under four different Gators head coaches. Ultimately, he became the longest-serving Gators head coach in any sport, and won more games than any other Gators coach, after leading the Gators baseball team for 28 seasons. Fuller brought stability and consistency to the program, and his Gators teams won SEC championships in 1952, 1956 and 1962, and made appearances in the NCAA tournament in 1958, 1960 and 1962. His final record was 557–354–6 (.611).\nBergman era: (1976–1981).\nFuller's successor, Jay Bergman, advanced the Florida baseball program a step further. After a difficult transition season in 1976, Bergman's Gators showed marked improvement, winning an SEC championship and SEC tournament title in 1981. His teams also qualified for the NCAA regionals in 1977, 1979 and 1981, and compiled a 7–6 tournament record, but in each instance did not advance beyond the double-elimination opening round of the NCAA tournament. In his six seasons as the Gators' skipper, Bergman posted an overall win–loss record of 216–113 (.657)—the best multi-season winning percentage until that time, and still the second best in Gators baseball history.\nArnold era: (1984–1994).\nJoe Arnold followed Jack Rhines' short two-season stint as Florida's head coach. Arnold's Gators won SEC championships in 1984 and 1988, and SEC tournament titles in 1984, 1988 and 1991. His teams made seven appearances in the NCAA tournament, and for the first and second time ever, the Gators advanced to the College World Series in 1988 and 1991. In 11 seasons coaching the Gators, Arnold compiled an overall record of 434–244–2 (.640).\nLopez era: (1995–2000).\nAndy Lopez took over the program in 1995, two seasons removed from leading the Pepperdine Waves of Pepperdine University to their only national championship in the 1992 College World Series. In his second season as Florida's head coach in 1996, he led the Gators to a 50-win season and the semifinals of the College World Series. In 2000 and 2001, however, the Gators were eliminated in the opening rounds of the NCAA tournament, and Lopez was replaced. In seven seasons, Lopez posted an overall record of 278–159–1 (.636).\nMcMahon era: (2001–2007).\nPat McMahon became Florida's baseball coach in 2001, after coaching the Mississippi State Bulldogs for the four preceding seasons.\nEarly in the 2003 season, the Gators began to make a comeback with several freshly scouted prospects, including Andy Ramirez (first base) David Headage (right field), and Randy Thompson (shortstop). The 2003 season set the standard for the next two years of baseball, entering the NCAA tournament in both the 2003 and 2004 seasons. The 2005 season was the best in school history, as the team won the SEC championship and advanced to the College World Series for the first time in seven years, ultimately losing to the Texas Longhorns, two games to none in the final championship round of the Series.\nThe expectations for the Gators were high in 2006; they were the consensus No. 1 team in the preseason polls, but the team struggled through the 2006 season. The Gators found themselves one game under .500 (26–27) heading into their final series against the LSU Tigers in Gainesville. The team surprisingly won two of the three games to finish the season at .500 (28–28). The Gators' 10–20 SEC record was the second worst in the conference, and they did not qualify for the SEC Tournament, nor were they selected for the NCAA regionals.\nAfter missing the NCAA regionals again in 2007, McMahon was fired on June 7, 2007. McMahon finished his six seasons as the Gators' head coach with an overall record of 202–113–1 (.641).\nO'Sullivan era: (2008–present).\nKevin O'Sullivan became the head coach of the Florida baseball team following the 2007 season. In each of his first four seasons, O'Sullivan's Gators improved their overall record and SEC standing. In 2008, his first season as the Gators' skipper, the team finished 34–24 overall, 17–13 in SEC play, and in second place in the SEC Eastern Division standings. In 2009, the Gators compiled an overall record of 42–22, 19–11 in the SEC, and in first place in the SEC Eastern Division. O'Sullivan's 2010 Gators finished with an overall win–loss record of 47–17, 22–8 in SEC play, and SEC regular season champions. In each of his first three seasons, his Gators also showed post-season improvement, too: early elimination in the NCAA regional in 2008; progressing to the NCAA Super Regional in 2009; and a berth in the College World Series in 2010.\nIn 2011, Florida finished the regular season 41–15 overall, 22–8 in the SEC, and SEC regular season co-champions—sharing the regular season conference title with the South Carolina Gamecocks and Vanderbilt Commodores. After defeating the Mississippi State Bulldogs, Alabama Crimson Tide, Georgia Bulldogs and Vanderbilt Commodores to win the SEC tournament, the Gators received the overall No. 2 seed in the sixty-four team NCAA tournament. The Gators swept the NCAA regional three games to none, and beat the Mississippi State Bulldogs two games to one in the NCAA Super Regional, and advanced to the 2011 College World Series. By beating the seventh-seeded Texas Longhorns 8–4 in the opening game of the 2011 Series, and then defeating the sixth-seeded Vanderbilt Commodores twice, 3–1 and 6–4, the Gators earned a berth in the best-of-three College World Series championship finals. In the championship finals, the South Carolina Gamecocks defeated the Gators in two straight games, 2–1 and 5–2; the Gators finished the 2011 season with an overall record of 53–19—the most games the Gators have ever won in a single season.\nFlorida finished the 2012 regular season with a record of 40–16, and were selected as the No. 1 seed in the 2012 NCAA Division I baseball tournament. Jonathon Crawford pitched the seventh no-hitter in NCAA tournament history against the Bethune-Cookman Wildcats in the opening round of the Gainesville Regional. The Gators swept the double-elimination regional tournament in three straight wins over Bethune-Cookman (4–0) and the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets (6–1, 15–3), and then swept the NC State Wolfpack in two straight games to win the best-of-three Gainesville Super Regional (7–1, 9–8) and earn a bid to the 2012 College World Series. The 2012 season came to an abrupt end in the College World Series, as the Gators lost their first two games to the South Carolina Gamecocks 7–3 and the Kent State Golden Flashes 5–4.\nFlorida returned to the College World Series for the ninth time in 2015 and for the tenth time in 2016. The Gators made their 11th College World Series in 2017, finally breaking through and winning their first national championship after sweeping LSU two games to none in the championship series. They returned to the College World Series in 2018 to defend their title, but fell to Arkansas in the semifinals. After an up-and-down 2019 campaign, the 2020 Gators got off to a school-best 16–1 start before the remainder of the season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nStadium facilities.\nCondron Ballpark at Alfred A. McKethan Field is the home field for the Florida baseball team. The playing surface is named for Florida alumnus Alfred A. McKethan and is located on the University of Florida's Gainesville campus. The stadium includes seating for approximately 7,000 fans (expandable to 10,000), a press box, locker rooms and coaching staff offices. The ballpark replaced Alfred A. McKethan Stadium at Perry Field after the 2020 season.\nHome plate faces northeast with the sun behind the stadium to provide shade for fans. A 360-degree open concourse allows fans a constant field view. Permanent chairback seats accommodate 4,000 spectators, with 700 club seats, berm capacity of over 2,000, and an option to temporarily expand capacity to around 10,000. The new ballpark is adjacent to Pressly Softball Stadium and Dizney Stadium for lacrosse. McKethan Stadium was demolished to make way for the James W. \"Bill\" Heavener Complex, a football training facility.\nCollege World Series appearances.\nThe Florida Gators have reached the College World Series 12 different times, including three consecutive trips from 2010 to 2012 and four consecutive trips from 2015 to 2018 under Kevin O'Sullivan.\nChampionships.\nNational championships.\nFlorida won its first national championship in 2017, sweeping rival LSU in the CWS Championship Series to emerge victorious in the school's third CWS Finals appearance.\nThe Gators have also reached the College World Series Championship Series three additional times.\nSEC regular season championships.\nThe Gators have won a total of 16 SEC regular season championships, second most among the 14 current SEC members. Their most recent title came in 2023 under Kevin O'Sullivan.\nSEC Tournament championships.\nThe Gators have won seven SEC Tournament championships, third most among the SEC's current 14 members. However, after winning five in 11 years from 1981 to 1991, it was 20 years before Kevin O'Sullivan led the Gators to their sixth SEC Tournament Championship in 2011.\nFormer players in Major League Baseball.\nMany former Florida Gator baseball players have gone on to play in Major League Baseball and other professional leagues. As of 2015, over 170 UF alumni have been chosen in the Major League Baseball draft and over 60 players have appeared in a Major League game. The first was Lance Richbourg, who made his MLB debut with the Philadelphia Phillies in 1921. Other notable alumni include 1953 American League MVP Al Rosen, 2006 World Series MVP David Eckstein, 2019 All-MLB First Team Pete Alonso, 2021 NL Rookie of the Year Jonathan India, 2021 Gold Glove Award winner Harrison Bader, and former Boston Red Sox managing general partner Haywood Sullivan."

        "text": "Elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame for 1973 followed the system in place since 1971, plus the special election of Roberto Clemente, who had died in a plane crash on New Year's Eve. The Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) voted by mail to select from recent major league players and elected Warren Spahn. The Veterans Committee met in closed sessions to consider executives, managers, umpires, and earlier major league players. It selected three people: Billy Evans, George Kelly, and Mickey Welch. The Negro Leagues Committee also met in person and selected Monte Irvin. A formal induction ceremony was held in Cooperstown, New York, on August 6, 1973, with Commissioner of Baseball Bowie Kuhn presiding.\nBBWAA election.\nThe BBWAA was authorized to elect players active in 1953 or later, but not after 1967; the ballot included candidates from the 1972 ballot who received at least 5% of the vote but were not elected, along with selected players, chosen by a screening committee, whose last appearance was in 1967. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote.\nVoters were instructed to cast votes for up to 10 candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall. Results of the 1973 election by the BBWAA were announced on January 24. The ballot consisted of 44 players; a total of 380 ballots were cast, with 285 votes required for election. A total of 3,044 individual votes were cast, an average of 8.01 per ballot. Those candidates receiving less than 5% of the vote will not appear on future BBWAA ballots but may eventually be considered by the Veterans Committee.\nCandidates who were eligible for the first time are indicated here with a dagger (†). The one candidate who received at least 75% of the vote and was elected is indicated in bold italics; candidates who have since been elected in subsequent elections are indicated in \"italics\".\nThe top two vote getters were first-year candidates. One of them, Warren Spahn, was elected to the Hall of Fame. Johnny Mize, Marty Marion, Dom DiMaggio, Bobo Newsom, Dutch Leonard, and Harry Brecheen were on the ballot for the final time.\nThe newly-eligible players included 24 All-Stars, 16 of whom were not included on the ballot, representing a total of 95 All-Star selections. Among the new candidates were 17-time All-Star Warren Spahn, 10-time All-Star Whitey Ford, 9-time All-Star Smoky Burgess, 8-time All-Stars Dick Groat and Bill Skowron, 7-time All-Star Robin Roberts, and 5-time All-Star Earl Battey.\nPlayers eligible for the first time who were \"not\" included on the ballot were: Joey Amalfitano, Earl Battey, Jackie Brandt, Eddie Bressoud, Bob Buhl, Don Demeter, Rubén Gómez, Jim King, Johnny Klippstein, Jim Landis, Barry Latman, Charley Lau, Bob Lillis, Jerry Lumpe, Billy O'Dell, Jim O'Toole, Jim Owens, Jimmy Piersall, Andre Rodgers, Johnny Romano, Jack Sanford, Bob Shaw, Bill Skowron, Ralph Terry, and Hal Woodeshick.\nSpecial election of Roberto Clemente.\nOn March 20, the BBWAA held a special election for Roberto Clemente, who had died in a plane crash on December 31, 1972. Clemente was elected after receiving 393 votes out of 424 ballots cast.\nVeterans Committee.\nThe 12-member Veterans Committee met in January 1973 to consider executives, managers, umpires, and earlier major league players, for election. It selected umpire Billy Evans, early 20th century player George Kelly, and 19th century player Mickey Welch. Kelly was cited by writer Bill James as the worst player in the Baseball Hall of Fame.

When Sewell played for Alabama, they were not in the Southeastern Conference. This means that only Frank Thomas, of Auburn, is the only SEC player to make the Baseball HOF. For 12 of the last 13 seasons Alabama has ranked in the top 10 nationally in attendance.\nIn 2016 the team moved into the newly renovated Sewell-Thomas Stadium, a $42 million renovation making The Joe look like a totally new ball park.

Along with most other Auburn athletic teams, the baseball team participates in the Western division of the Southeastern Conference. The Tigers play their home games on campus at Plainsman Park, and they are coached by Butch Thompson.\nHistory.\nAuburn Baseball has won six SEC championships, three SEC Tournament championships, appeared in 22 NCAA Regionals, and reached the College World Series (CWS) six times.\nFollowing the 2000 season, Hal Baird retired as a head coach. After 16 years at head of the Auburn baseball program, Baird posted an impressive 634–328–0 overall record.\nOn September 1, 1999, Steve Renfroe was named head baseball coach at Auburn University, as the successor to Hal Baird following the 2000 season. Renfroe was longtime assistant coach at Auburn before being named head coach, having begun his coaching career at Auburn in 1981 as an assistant and remaining in that position until 1995 when he was named assistant head coach.\nOn June 7, 2004, Renfroe was relieved of his duties as head baseball coach at Auburn. He posted an overall mark of 145–92, including a 60–60 SEC record, during his tenure. Each of Renfroe's first three Auburn squads advanced to the NCAA Baseball Tournaments, with stops in Tallahassee, FL, in 2001, Tuscaloosa, AL, in 2002, and hosting a 2003 Regional in Auburn.\nOn June 29, 2004, Tom Slater was named as Steve Renfroe's replacement. After only having 2 coaches in 38 years, Auburn was now on the second coach within a five-year period. Slater was previously an assistant at Auburn during the 1990s before taking a head coaching job at his alma mater Virginia Military Institute following the 2000 season. After the 2003 season, Slater left VMI to take an assistant job at the University of Florida where he helped lead the Gators to their first ever Super Regional appearance.\nOn June 20, 2008, John Pawlowski was introduced as the 16th Head Coach of the Auburn Tigers baseball program. Pawlowski was previously the head coach at the College of Charleston. He took over that program in 2000, and posted a 338–192–1 record during his tenure. Under his direction, the Cougars made three straight NCAA post-season appearances, including their first ever appearance in 2004. He was named the Southern Conference coach of the year in 2004, 2005, and 2007, and coached 17 All-Americans during his tenure. At Auburn, he took over a very young baseball team that included two freshman all-American selections, Hunter Morris and Brian Fletcher.\nOn May 27, 2013, John Pawlowski was fired after finishing the 2013 season with a 33–23 record overall and a 13–17 record in the SEC. The Tigers failed to reach the NCAA tournament for three straight years. Pawlowski compiled a 167–126 overall record and a 71–79 SEC mark at Auburn. His 2010 team won the SEC West, but his four other teams had losing conference records.\nStadium.\nPlainsman Park.\nSamford Stadium-Hitchcock Field at Plainsman Park is a baseball stadium located in Auburn, Alabama. It is the home field for the Auburn Tigers baseball team. Commonly known as \"Plainsman Park\", it is widely considered one of the finest facilities in college baseball and has a seating capacity of 4,096 not including lawn areas.\nThe field was named in 1997 to honor two former Auburn players, Billy and Jimmy Hitchcock. The Hitchcock brothers were popular athletes in the 1930s. Jimmy was Auburn's first All-American in football and baseball, and later coached the Tigers during the 1940s.

        "text": "The Kentucky Wildcats baseball team represents the University of Kentucky in NCAA Division I college baseball and competes in the Eastern division of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The current head coach of the Wildcats is Nick Mingione.\nHistory.\nThe baseball program, partly hampered by being the northernmost school in the heavily warm-weather SEC (until Missouri's arrival in 2013), has historically achieved only modest success at best. Under longtime coach Keith Madison (1979–2003), the Wildcats had some good teams. However, due to playing in the same league as national powers Florida, LSU (which won five national championships under Skip Bertman from 1991 through 2000), Mississippi State, and South Carolina, regular-season success was rarely rewarded with a postseason berth. In 28 years, Madison was only able to lead the Wildcats to two NCAA tournaments, in 1988 and 1993. The Wildcats won their first three regional games in 1988 to move to within one win of the CWS, but lost twice in the championship round to 1987 national champion Stanford, which went on to successfully defend its title.\nWildcats baseball hit bottom at the turn of the 21st century, with only one winning season from 1997 through 2004, and five straight last-place finishes in the SEC East from 2001 through 2005. In 2003, after Madison's retirement, Kentucky hired Florida assistant John Cohen as head coach. Cohen was able to lead the Cats to a winning overall season in 2005, despite another SEC cellar finish.\nFew could have expected the Cinderella season the Cats would have in 2006. They went from worst to first in the SEC, winning a regular-season conference title for the first time in three decades, and being ranked as high as fourth in the country by one major baseball poll during the season. However, the newly energized Kentucky baseball faithful saw the Cats crash out of the SEC tournament early and fail to make it out of the regionals of the NCAA tournament at home.\nThere were high hopes for the 2007 team and for the most part they delivered. They started the season 19–0 before falling to Arkansas. They then fell into a tailspin but rebounded at the end of the year to just miss the SEC playoffs after a Tennessee Volunteers win. They finished with a 37–19 record. Jason Kipnis, who was an outfielder for that team, is now a second baseman for the Cleveland Indians.\nIn 2008, Kentucky started off strong posting a 19–0 record and being ranked as high as #4 in the nation. The Wildcats rolled into conference play and began to struggle after being swept by eventual College World Series runner-up Georgia and College World Series participant LSU. The Wildcats finished the season strong and made it into the NCAA tournament. The Wildcats would end up losing to Arizona in the regional final in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The Wildcats finished the season with a 44–19 record, the most wins in school history. They finished 25th in the final ESPN/USA Today poll.\nThe Wildcats slumped back to the SEC's second division in 2009, though they finished two games over .500 overall. Cohen left for Mississippi State after the season, and pitching coach Gary Henderson was named his successor.\nIn 2012, Kentucky garnered its most successful season ever in program history. Henderson was voted SEC Coach of the Year by the league coaches. Henderson directed the Wildcats to a school-record 45-win season, with UK completing its best finishes in the SEC and NCAA tournaments in school annals. The 2012 season also marked the first time that UK had ever been ranked No. 1. UK finished the season with a No. 11 ranking by Baseball America. UK also achieved a program record by winning seven of ten series in SEC play. UK also ran up a school-record 22-game winning streak, which is the second longest in SEC history.\nStadium.\nThe Wildcats played their home games on campus at Cliff Hagan Stadium from 1969 through 2018. On October 21, 2016, Kentucky announced plans to build a new stadium, with fixed seating for 2,400, additional grass berm seating for a permanent capacity of 4,000, and the capability to add temporary seating to raise capacity to as much as 7,000. The new stadium, Kentucky Proud Park, opened on February 26, 2019, with a 7–3 win over Eastern Kentucky in front of 4,074 fans.\nPlayer awards.\nNational awards.\nDick Howser Trophy\nGolden Spikes Award \nAll-Americans.\nThe following is a list of Kentucky's All-Americans:\nWildcats in MLB.\nSeveral Wildcats players have gone on to play in Major League Baseball."

        "text": "Ancient Teaching of the Masters (ATOM) was an American religious group founded by Darwin Gross in 1983.\nDarwin Gross was an American Army veteran, vibraphone musician, and religious leader. For ten years, he was idolised as the spiritual and corporate head of the “ECKANKAR” religion founded in 1965 by Paul Twitchell. Gross became “the 972nd Living ECK Master” in 1971 when Twitchell’s widow Gail handed him a blue carnation at an ECKANKAR corporate meeting. In 1981, Gross stepped down as spiritual head of ECKANKAR and appointed a follower, Harold Klemp, as “the 972nd Living ECK Master.” In 1983, Gross founded “Ancient Teaching of the Masters” (ATOM) subsequent to his expulsion from ECKANKAR by Klemp.\nBackground.\nAs followers would describe it, \"Ancient Teaching of the Masters\" is the name that Darwin Gross used to carry on the original teachings of Paul Twitchell after his termination from Eckankar.\nDarwin Gross became the new Living Eck Master upon the death of Paul Twitchell in 1971. In 1981, he named Harold Klemp to take that position, continuing to function as the president of the Eckankar Corporation himself. In 1983, his relationship with Eckankar was formally terminated by Klemp, who formally terminated all of his agreements with the corporation and his status as an Eck Master, amid a cloud of charges of misappropriation of funds that were later sustained in court. His followers believe that the court transcript exonerates Gross from misappropriation of funds, that he never stole $400,000 as rumored among Eckists, and that frivolous lawsuits nearly destroyed his wealth.\nAt that time, Darwin Gross began teaching independently, clearly stating that he was not creating a separate teaching, but that he was maintaining the original teachings of Paul Twitchell.\nHaving retained copyright for all of his own books and music, Gross began publishing these works, and the works of his students, independently, under the SOS (\"Sounds of Soul\") Publishing label through 1989. Darwin Gross died on March 8, 2008."

        "text": "The England cricket team in Australia in 1886–87, generally known as Alfred Shaw's XI, was described by \"Wisden\" as \"one of the strongest that ever left England for the Colonies\". The team played 10 first-class matches, winning 6 with 2 draws and 2 defeats (both against New South Wales). It was the 9th English team to visit Australia, the first tour having occurred in the summer of 1861–62.\nBackground of the Tour.\nSince the 1860s there had been five visits by Australian teams to England. These tours were lucrative for the players and organisers involved and immensely popular in England. During the visit of the eighth English team to Australia in summer of 1884-1885 Lord Harris, the former English captain (of the 1878-79 tour to Australia) and now an administrator, had suggested to the powerful Melbourne Cricket Club that they send a team to England for the summer of 1886, and this would be known as an Australian team. Throughout the Australian summer of 1884-85 there was conflict between the Australian colonial Associations over the selection and organisation of this Australian team. There were also pay disputes with the team from the first test being replaced by an entirely new team for the second test. Former player Tom Horan stated that the \"Melbourne Cricket Club had become the leading cricket club in Australia and stands alone in influence, wealth, power and position.\" Cricket writer David Montefiore stated that there was a near total collapse in support for the emerging institution of Anglo-Australian cricket. Eventually the team to travel to England was selected on an amateur basis with some prominent professional players being left out. The 1886 Australian team to England performed poorly. The team lost all three test matches and won only nine of 39 matches. There were also reports of ill discipline and poor behaviour by some of the Australian players. The prominent sports\njournal \"The Referee\" reported \"never since Australian cricketers became prominent in the world’s esteem have they met with such an overwhelming defeat as that which the MCC Eleven has sustained in England.\" However the tour was a financial success with the Melbourne Club making a profit of £1083.\nOrigin of the Tour.\nDuring the tour 1886 tour to England the Melbourne Cricket Club's secretary Ben Wardill entered into negotiations with the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) to bring an English XI to Australia for the forthcoming Australian summer. Whilst negotiating with the MCC, Wardill discovered that the prominent English cricketers Shaw, Shrewsbury and Lillywhite were organising a team of their own, all professionals, to tour Australia. Wardill was asked to intervene with the trio and ask them to postpone their visit so that two English teams would not visit at the same time. Wardill failed in this task and was instructed to cease negotiations on an MCC visit. Shaw &amp; Co., \"who through the medium of the Press and otherwise made some very caustic remarks upon the action of the popular M.C.C. Secretary. They claimed that they were the first to propose bringing a team to the colonies for the coming season and offered to refer the question to arbitration.\" Arrangements with the Shaw group for their team to visit for 1886–87 season were then entered into by the Melbourne Cricket Club and the Australian associations.\nTeam members.\nThe party comprised 13 players, all of them professionals: Arthur Shrewsbury, Billy Barnes, William Gunn, William Scotton, Wilfred Flowers, Mordecai Sherwin and Alfred Shaw (all Nottinghamshire); Dick Barlow and Johnny Briggs (both Lancashire); George Lohmann and Maurice Read (both Surrey); Billy Bates (Yorkshire); and James Lillywhite (Sussex)."

The England side was a private venture of Archie MacLaren at the invitation of the Melbourne Cricket Club, after MCC had declined to send a team. Prior to this, all Test tours of Australia had been privately organised, but MCC took over the responsibility with the following tour in 1903–4. George Hirst, Wilfred Rhodes, KS Ranjitsinjhi, Stanley Jackson and CB Fry were all unavailable.\nOnly three centuries were scored in the series and only one team innings exceeded 400 (the first innings of England in the first Test). Clem Hill managed 521 runs at an average of 52.10, making successive scores of 99, 98 and 97, without scoring a century. England's most successful batsman was MacLaren, with 412 runs at 45.77.\nSydney Barnes made his debut for England and took 19 wickets in the first two Tests before being injured in the third and taking no further part in the series. His selection for the tour was something of a coup for MacLaren, as Barnes had very little first-class experience behind him: a total of seven games. He had been playing in the Lancashire League during the 1901 English season, but appeared in one game for Lancashire near the end of the season, taking 6/70 and 0/29.

Filed in 1970, the lawsuit was settled in 1976 and resulted in the free agency rules now used in the NBA.\nFacts.\nRobertson sought through his lawsuit to block any merger of the NBA with the American Basketball Association (ABA), to end the option clause that bound a player to a single NBA team in perpetuity, to end the NBA's college draft binding a player to one team, and to end restrictions on free-agent signings. The suit also sought damages for NBA players for past harm caused by the option clause.\nRobertson's lawsuit prevented the planned 1970 merger of the National Basketball Association with the American Basketball Association.\nJudgement.\nThe court issued an injunction against any merger. The ABA-NBA merger was thus delayed until 1976.\nSignificance.\nIn 1972, Congress came close to enacting legislation to enable a merger but the measure was not passed. As a result, the two leagues did not merge until 1976.\nAlthough he wasn't playing anymore, Robertson was not out of sight. As president of the NBA players union, Robertson's 1970 suit against the NBA contended the draft, option clause and other rules restricting player movement were violations of antitrust laws. The suit was settled in 1976, when the league agreed to let players become free agents in exchange for their old team's \"right of first refusal\" to match any offer they might receive."

        "text": "The University of Arkansas Razorbacks baseball team is a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Southeastern Conference (SEC), and is coached by Dave Van Horn. The program started in 1897, and is in its 102nd season of play (77th consecutive) in 2024. Arkansas is one of only four schools in the SEC to turn a profit from its baseball program in recent years, along with SEC Western division rivals LSU, Mississippi State and Ole Miss.\nThe Razorbacks have been to 32 NCAA tournaments and eleven College World Series: 1979, 1985, 1987, 1989, 2004, 2009, 2012, 2015, 2018, 2019, 2022.\nVenue.\nThe Razorbacks play baseball home games in Baum-Walker Stadium at George Cole Field, which holds 11,749. Arkansas was the first program in the nation to have an average attendance over 8,000 for the course of the season. Baum Stadium has hosted NCAA regionals in 1999, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2010, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2021 and 2023. The Arkansas baseball team also hosted an NCAA Super Regional in 2004 against Florida State, in 2015 against Missouri State, in 2018 against South Carolina, in 2019 against Ole Miss, and again in 2021 against North Carolina State. One of the games in the 2015 Super Regional series against Missouri State set the all-time stadium attendance mark at 12,167. The first game of the South Carolina Super Regional series had 11, 722 in attendance making it the 3rd highest attended game in Baum stadium history. Baum stadium was voted top ballpark in collegiate baseball by Baseball America, 20 years after claiming the top spot in a 1998 poll.\nIn 2007, Arkansas led the nation in attendance, with 8,069 attendees per game, over 700 more per game than second-place LSU. Mississippi State, another SEC school, was third with an average of 6,795 per game.\nBefore Baum Stadium was built, the Razorbacks played on the original George Cole Field from 1975 to 1995, named for former all-conference quarterback, shortstop and athletic director George Cole. The field was next to John McDonnell Field, home of the outdoor track and field team, and has since been turned into the practice field for the football team.\nHistory.\nArkansas first fielded a baseball team from 1897 to 1930. The modern era of Razorbacks baseball began in 1947, under Deke Brackett. Bill Ferrell led the team from 1950 to 1965, and Wayne Robbins took over from 1966 to 1969.\nIn 1970, Cole hired 28-year-old Norm DeBriyn after another man took the job but resigned after only one day. DeBriyn inherited a program that played at a dilapidated stadium at the Washington County Fairgrounds, and whose paperwork was contained in a single manila folder. He immediately set about upgrading the program. Within three years, he had the Razorbacks in the NCAA tournament for the first time in school history. He then persuaded athletic director Frank Broyles to build a new on-campus stadium, George Cole Field. Arkansas' baseball program has won six conference championships, two in the Southwest Conference in 1989 and 1990, and four in the Southeastern Conference in 1999, 2004, 2021, and 2023. They have also won two conference tournament titles, the first in 1985 as a member of the SWC, the second in 2021 in the SEC. In addition to those championships, the Razorbacks have also won eight SEC West Division championships in 1999, 2004, 2007, 2011, 2018, 2019, 2021, and 2023. In Arkansas' eleven College World Series appearances they have finished as national runners-up twice, in 1979 and 2018.\n1979 College World Series.\nDeBriyn's 10th team put the Razorbacks on the national map. The Razorbacks won 49 games, lost 15, and finished second in the Southwest Conference (SWC). The Hogs defeated George Washington, Florida, and Delaware twice to move out of the East Regional (played at Seminole Stadium in Tallahassee, Florida). The Razorbacks then went to Omaha and defeated Pepperdine, 5–4 and an Arizona Wildcats club, with a young Terry Francona, 10–3. A match-up with SWC champion Texas loomed next for the Razorbacks. The Hogs had gone 1–4 against the Longhorns up to this point in the season. The Razorbacks prevailed, 9–4, and earned a contest with Cal State Fullerton for a championship. Texas was eliminated. Arkansas lost twice to the Titans, 13–10, and 2–1, to give the trophy to Cal State Fullerton. Freshman Kevin McReynolds was named to the all-tournament team as an outfielder, along with Steve Krueger at pitcher, Larry Wallace at shortstop, and Marc Brumble as an outfielder.\n1985 College World Series.\nArkansas came into the South regional hot winning twelve straight games (last loss against fellow CWS team Mississippi State), and winning the SWC tournament with the help of tourney-MVP Dave Patterson. A 20–13 victory over Eastern Kentucky started things off on the right foot for the Hogs. Wins against George Mason, hometown FSU, and Georgia Tech would push the Hogs to their second College World Series.\nArkansas arrived in Omaha in as dramatic fashion as they left it. The Diamond Hogs defeated the Gamecocks of South Carolina in a 14 inning affair, 1–0, but Arkansas would lose to Mississippi State three days later, and fall to the loser's bracket. Facing elimination, the Razorbacks crushed Stanford 10–4, eliminating the Cardinal from the College World Series. Now a win away from the Championship series with Miami (Fl), Arkansas had to face Southwest Conference rival Texas.\nSaid Razorback third baseman Jeff King of Texas, \"We figured we would meet them again.\" The Hogs were 4–1 against the Longhorns in 1985, including two wins in the Southwest Conference Tournament. Arkansas lead the game 7–0, but the Longhorns battled back and sent the game to extra innings. Texas' Bill Bates hit a leadoff triple in the bottom of the tenth inning with the score tied 7–7. Arkansas coach Norm DeBriyn opted to intentionally walk the bases full and pull the infield in. Doug Hodo then hit a single past the infielders, allowing Bates to score and the Horns to move on, 8–7 in ten innings. The situation was oddly similar to the last time the Hogs reached the College World Series, except Texas was 4–1 against the Hogs in 1979 (including two SWC tournament wins), and Arkansas prevailed in the 1979 CWS match up.\nFreshman third baseman Jeff King and junior outfielder Ralph Kraus were named to the All-College World Series team.\n1987 College World Series.\nArkansas was 51–16 in 1987, and finished in fifth place at the CWS. The Hogs finished second in both the SWC regular season and postseason tournament. The Regional was played in Huntsville, Alabama, and the Razorbacks defeated Middle Tennessee, West Virginia, and Clemson (twice) in order to play in Omaha. Texas, who Arkansas had gone a lowly 1–4 against during the season and now was ranked #1 nationally, loomed in a Rosenblatt Stadium showdown.\nTexas defeated Arkansas, 13–6, but Arkansas rebounded with a win against future SEC foe Georgia, eliminating the Bulldogs. Georgia was led by pitcher Derek Lilliquist (14–2), who had 19 HR and 60 RBI entering Omaha. Another future SEC opponent was on the horizon, this time in the form of Tigers from LSU. The Tigers came out on top, 5–2, but were eliminated two days later, with Texas eliminated a day later.\n1989 College World Series.\nTen years after the successful 1979 campaign, the Razorbacks were again headed to Omaha. First, the 51–16 Razorbacks played their way through the Northwest Regional, losing first to Le Moyne before defeating George Washington, Illinois, Arizona State, and Le Moyne to move to the College World Series.\nOnce in the College World Series, the Diamond Hogs met Wichita State. The Shockers had actually been defeated by the Razorbacks 5–1 in Fayetteville, which was the Razorbacks' first game of the season. Arkansas lost 3–1 on June 2, and had to stave off elimination against North Carolina. The Tar Heels were eliminated, and Arkansas had another shot at the Shockers, who had lost to Florida State and was now fighting to remain in Omaha, as one more loss would eliminate them.\nWichita State defeated Norm DeBriyn's Razorbacks, 8–4, eliminating them. The finish was good for fifth place in the CWS. Wichita State would go on to win the National Championship, fighting off elimination three times more. Six of the 11 all-CWS team were members of the Wichita State Shockers, including Eric Wedge. Arkansas Razorbacks outfielder Troy Eklund was elected to the All-American team.\n2004.\nArkansas won the SEC Western Division, a portion of the SEC crown, and visited the College World Series again in 2004.\n2004 SEC tournament.\nThe Hogs were picked to finish last in the SEC, but instead was the #1 seed in the SEC Tournament. The Diamond Hogs lost to Luke Hochevar and the Volunteers of Tennessee, 6–8 in 13 innings. Kyle Norrid of Tennessee hit a three-run double in the 12th inning, but the Hogs returned with four straight singles to keep the game going. Chris Kemp hit a game-winning double the next inning, and Craig Cobb retired the Razorbacks to earn the save. The game was the third of the day to extend into extra innings. The Hogs then defeated Ole Miss and Tennessee by the counts of 4–3 and 4–1 respectively, before losing to South Carolina, 2–3. Arkansas went into the ninth down 3–0, and loaded the bases with no outs. Jake Dugger drove in a run with a single. Following a strikeout, Brett Hagedorn added to the Razorbacks score with a sacrifice fly. Scott Hode grounded out for out number three, and the rally fell short. The Gamecocks would win the championship by defeating Vanderbilt. Arkansas finished third in the SEC tournament.\n2004 College World Series.\nThe Razorbacks began play in their home stadium in the Fayetteville Regional. Arkansas defeated Le Moyne first, but lost to Wichita State 4–1. The Razorbacks had not seen the last of the Shockers, though, and after a 10–7 win over Missouri, defeated them two times on June 6, 2004, to advance to the Super Regionals.\nArkansas had to play Florida State twice to move on to Omaha, but the games were again at Baum Stadium. The Diamond Hogs prevailed, 7–4 and 4–2 and went on to Omaha.\nArkansas was an eight seed in 2004, and for the fourth time in five Hog appearances, Arkansas' first game in Omaha was against the Texas Longhorns. #1 Texas prevailed 13–2, and the Razorbacks were one loss from elimination. The Arizona Wildcats would bump the Razorbacks from Rosenblatt Stadium in their next game, 7–2.\n2009 College World Series.\nArkansas began hot in 2009, starting the year at 10–2 including back-to-back wins over #1 Arizona State that set Baum Stadium attendance records. The Hogs luck changed entering SEC play, as they dropped series against Vanderbilt, Georgia, and LSU, and were swept by Alabama and Ole Miss to end the year. Limping into the 2009 SEC baseball tournament, the Hogs defeated Florida twice, but were bumped from the tournament by Vanderbilt. The Razorbacks were the #2 seed in the Norman Regional, hosted by the Oklahoma Sooners.\nThe Hogs defeated Washington State in game 1 in Norman, setting up a match up with #9 Oklahoma, who the Hogs had beaten at home a month earlier on a Brett Eibner walk-off bases-loaded walk. Arkansas collected 20 hits in a 17–6 win over the Sooners, setting up super regional berth with another win. Razorback Andy Wilkins went 5–5 in the following game with two doubles, two home runs, four runs scored and five RBI in an 11–0 rout. The win pushed the Hogs to a meeting with Florida State in Dick Howser Stadium.\nThe Hogs last met Florida State in the 2004 Fayetteville Super Regional, with the Hogs advancing to Omaha. Arkansas scored five runs in the last three innings to win game 1, and Andrew Darr propelled the Hogs to the College World Series on his two-run walk-off double in the bottom of the ninth.\nThe Razorbacks opened the College World Series in game 1 against #1 national seed Cal State Fullerton. Dallas Keuchel pitched well, with Zack Cox and Andy Wilkins both homering in a resounding 10–6 win. The win set a rematch with LSU, who had beaten Arkansas in a hard-fought series earlier in the year. LSU got a first-inning home run from pitcher Brett Eibner, and the Hogs bats fell silent in a 9–1 loss. Both fighting for their tournament lives, Arkansas met Virginia in an elimination game. The Razorbacks offense was again quiet, and the Hogs were down to their last strike when Brett Eibner homered to keep the Razorbacks in Omaha. The Hogs would prevail after another timely Andrew Darr double in the tenth inning. A rematch with LSU sat on the horizon, and the drained Arkansas pitching staff struggled. Closer Stephen Richards started the game for the Hogs, who were losing 4–0 by the third inning. After an error and a wild pitch, the Razorbacks gave up runs in six separate innings, and lost 14–5. The Hogs finished tied with Arizona State (who Arkansas defeated twice in the regular season) for third place.\n2012 College World Series.\nArkansas began the 2012 season with high expectations, including a consensus top ten ranking and D. J. Baxendale, Nolan Sanburn, Dominic Ficociello, and Ryne Stanek receiving preseason All-America honors. The team began the season playing well in non-conference games, and finished with a 16–14 SEC record. After a quick two losses at the SEC tournament, it was announced the Hogs would play in the Houston Regional, hosted by Rice University. Arkansas defeated the Sam Houston State Bearkats twice and Rice once to advance to the Waco, Texas, Super Regional against Baylor. The Razorbacks dropped the first game to Baylor, 8–1. Facing elimination, Arkansas won game 2 after consecutive hit by pitches with the bases loaded gave the Hogs the tying and winning runs. Arkansas won game 3 when Jake Wise drove in Brian Anderson with a double in the 10th inning, pushing across the game's only run and sending the Hogs to Omaha.\nArkansas won their first game of the 2012 College World Series, an 8–1 victory over Kent State Golden Flashes. D. J. Baxendale pitched into the seventh inning, with Joe Serrano, Brian Anderson, Bo Bigham, and Jake Wise all collecting multiple hits. Two nights later the Razorbacks faced SEC foe and two-time defending champion the South Carolina Gamecocks, who came into the game with a 22-game postseason win streak. A Dominic Ficociello RBI in the first inning gave Arkansas a 1–0 lead, as they never trailed, winning a 2–1 pitcher's duel. Stanek pitched six innings, allowing just one run on three hits. Reliever Barrett Astin pitched the final three innings allowing no runs, and just one hit.\n2015 College World Series.\nArkansas was not expected to make it to the College World Series in 2015, especially after a slow start to the season left the Razorbacks sitting at .500 heading into April. But the Razorbacks caught fire behind SEC and national player of the year Andrew Benintendi and won both the Stillwater Regional and Fayetteville Super Regional to advance to Omaha for the eighth time and fourth time under Van Horn.\nIn the first game, Arkansas got a stellar pitching performance from Trey Killian, but normally lights-out closer Zach Jackson didn't have his best stuff and Virginia came back and forced the Razorbacks into an elimination game, beating them 5–3.\nArkansas then faced No. 5 national seed Miami, and fell behind 2–0 when Jacob Heyward hit a 2-run shot off reliever Jackson Lowery, who had just been inserted for Keaton McKinney. The Razorbacks rallied twice to tie the game at 2–2 and 3–3, but lost 4–3 when Heyward hit a walk-off single. It was the first time since 2004 that they failed to win a game in Omaha.\n2018 College World Series.\nThe Razorbacks entered Omaha with a 44–19 record, co-champions of the SEC West with Ole Miss, and having won the Fayetteville Regional and Super Regional at home in Baum Stadium. The team set a school record for home wins, going 34–4 at Baum. Beginning the year as a top ten team, the Razorbacks never left that spot throughout the season. Arkansas previously played four of the other seven teams in Omaha, compiling a 4–5 record against them prior to the CWS.\nArkansas defeated Texas in its opening game 11–5 behind pitcher Blaine Knight, who improved to 13–0 on the year. A three-hour rain delay marred the contest. It then went on to beat Texas Tech 7–4 in a game pushed back a day because of weather, and then eliminated defending national champion Florida 5–2 to earn a spot in the championship series against Oregon State. Arkansas won the first game of the championship series 4–1, but Oregon State completed a comeback 5–3 win in game two thanks in large part to a dropped foul ball by Arkansas with two outs in the 9th inning. The Oregon State batter hit a home run two pitches later to win the game, and the Beavers would win decisively in game three, 5-0. The game two loss is considered one of the most heart-breaking losses in program history.\nPostseason appearances.\nNCAA tournament.\n\"Source: Razorbacks baseball History in NCAA and Conference Postseason Tournaments\"\nConference affiliations.\nSource:\nAlumni.\nGolden Spikes Award &amp; Dick Howser Trophy.\nArkansas has produced two winners of the Golden Spikes Award and Dick Howser Trophy, bestowed annually to the best amateur baseball player in the United States.

        "text": "The Israel National Baseball Team () represents Israel in international competitions. It is managed by Ian Kinsler.\nAt the 2017 WBC, Team Israel came in 6th. In 2022, Israel was ranked 20th in the world. The Israel national baseball team competed at the 2020 Summer Olympics in 2021, where it beat Mexico and finished 5th. It also competed in the 2023 World Baseball Classic, where it did not progress to the quarterfinal round.\nHistory.\nIn the 1970s American immigrants started playing baseball in Israel. In December 1986, the Israel Association of Baseball (IAB) was formed as a non-profit organization to develop baseball in Israel. Israel has baseball teams in all age groups from 10 to 30.\nIn 2015, Israel senior national team pitcher Dean Kremer became the first Israeli to be selected in the Major League Baseball draft. He was picked by the San Diego Padres in the 38th round. Kremer opted to fulfill his college commitment, and play for the UNLV Rebels baseball team. After playing for the Rebels for the 2016 season, Kremer was drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 14th round of the 2016 draft. In 2019, Kremer reached Class AAA for the first time, pitching for the Norfolk Tides of the International League. In 2020, Kremer made his debut for the Baltimore Orioles, becoming the first Israeli citizen to pitch in the major leagues.\nPrior to the 2017 World Baseball Classic (WBC), Israel was the 41st-ranked national baseball team in the world (and ranked 16th in Europe). After its performance in the 2017 WBC, in which Team Israel came in 6th, the team was ranked 19th in the world (and 4th in Europe). The most recent ranking was released in 2022, with Israel ranked 20th in the world. The Israel national baseball team that competed at the 2020 Summer Olympics was composed mostly of Israeli-American Jews, with four Israeli-born players.\nIn 2019 Israel won the European Baseball B-Pool competition, with a 5–0 record. It then won the best-of-three 2019 European Qualification Playoff Series, with a 2–0 record. Consequently, it qualified for the 2019 European Baseball Championship 12-team tournament in Germany, where it came in fourth. As one of the top five teams in the Championship, it thereby moved on to compete in the Africa/Europe 2020 Olympic Qualification tournament. It won that tournament, and thus qualified to be one of six national teams that competed in 2021 in baseball at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.\nAt the Olympics in 2021 the team faced Japan, Mexico, South Korea, the United States, and the Dominican Republic. Israel beat Mexico but finished 5th, after losing to the Dominican Republic 7-6 in the Round 2 repechage.\nThe team also competed in the 2023 World Baseball Classic, where it defeated Nicaragua but lost to Venezuela and did not progress to the quarterfinal round. However, its win guaranteed it a spot in the following Classic. Among the players who played for the team were All Star outfielder Joc Pederson and starting pitcher Dean Kremer.\nThe senior national team manager is Israeli-American former Major League Baseball World Series champion, World Baseball Classic champion, four-time All Star, and Olympian Ian Kinsler.\nResults and fixtures.\nThe following is a list of professional baseball match results currently active in the latest version of the WBSC World Rankings, as well as any future matches that have been scheduled.\nCompetitions.\nWorld Baseball Classic.\n2013 World Baseball Classic.\nTeam Israel competed in the September 2012 Qualifier Round 1, in Jupiter, Florida, against Spain, France, and South Africa. Israel won easily in their first game. Israel then beat Spain in the winner's bracket. Spain then eliminated South Africa to earn a rematch with Israel, in the final game. Spain won the winner-take-all final game, 9–7 in 10 innings, to advance to the main tournament.\n2017 World Baseball Classic.\nIn September 2016, Team Israel competed in the 2017 Qualifier 4 round. Colorado Rockies coach Jerry Weinstein served as the manager. Israel's roster included 20 MLB-affiliated minor leaguers, making up 86% of the team, more than any other team in the qualifiers even before including recent Major Leaguers.\nIsrael won all three of their games in the qualifier, beating Great Britain twice and Brazil once. With the win, Israel advanced to play in Pool A in South Korea in March 2017, against South Korea, Taiwan, and the Netherlands.\nPrior to the start of the 2017 tournament, ESPN considered Israel, ranked 41st in the world, to be the biggest underdog in the tournament, referring to them as the \"Jamaican bobsled team of the WBC\". Israel began the round robin tournament with wins against world # 3 Korea and world # 4 Chinese Taipei, and world # 9 Netherlands. Team Israel's first round performance afforded it a spot in the second round, in Pool E in Japan, and ensured its participation in the 2021 World Baseball Classic tournament. Ryan Lavarnway was named Pool A MVP.\nIn the first game of the second round, Team Israel beat Team Cuba (world # 5) by a score of 4−1. Israel lost the next two games, to the Netherlands and world # 1 Japan, and came in third in Pool E.\nIn 2018 a documentary was released entitled \"Heading Home: The Tale of Team Israel\", which covered the experience of Team Israel at the 2017 World Baseball Classic.\n2023 World Baseball Classic.\nTeam Israel will compete in the 2023 World Baseball Classic in March 11-15, 2023. It will play in Miami, Florida. Israel will face Team Puerto Rico, Team Dominican Republic, Team Venezuela, and Team Nicaragua. \nAmerican-Israeli Ian Kinsler, a former Major League All Star and two-time Gold Glove winner, and Israeli Olympian, will manage the team. Among the players who have committed to play for the team are All Star outfielder Joc Pederson, outfielder Alex Dickerson, catcher Garrett Stubbs, and American-Israelis catcher Ryan Lavarnway, infielder Danny Valencia, and infielder Ty Kelly, along with prospects Matt Mervis (who in 2022 he led Minor League Baseball in RBIs and was third with 36 home runs), Zack Gelof, and Spencer Horwitz. Pitchers who will be on the team include Israeli-American Dean Kremer, Richard Bleier, Robert Stock, Jake Bird, and American-Israelis Jake Fishman, Zack Weiss, and Bubby Rossman, while Scott Effross was slated to be on the team but injured his arm.\nOthers who may possibly join Team Israel include All Star pitcher Max Fried, pitcher Noah Davis, pitcher Kenny Rosenberg, and outfielder Mike Moustakas. Third baseman All Star Alex Bregman has chosen not to play in the WBC, first baseman Rowdy Tellez has chosen to play for Team Mexico, and Adam Ottavino has chosen to play for Team Italy. Gold Glove outfielder Harrison Bader, outfielder Kevin Pillar, and pitcher Eli Morgan originally intended to play for the team, but at the end of the day will not play.\nBrad Ausmus will be one of the team's coaches. He is a former Team Israel manager, has managed in the major leagues for five years, and during his 18-year playing career won three Gold Glove Awards for his defense. Kevin Youkilis will be the team's hitting coach. In his 10-year major league career, he won two World Series titles with the Boston Red Sox, was a three-time All Star, and won a Gold Glove Award. Jerry Narron, who in his 30 year career has been as a manager or coach with eight different major league teams and been the third base coach for Team Israel at the 2017 World Baseball Classic qualifier, will also serve as a coach for the team.\nEuropean Baseball Championship.\n2019 European Baseball Championship.\nTeam Israel won the 2019 European Baseball Championship - B-Pool in early July 2019 in Blagoevgrad, Bulgaria, winning all five of its games. It thus advanced to the playoffs against Team Lithuania in the 2019 Playoff Series at the end of July 2019 for the last qualifying spot for the 2019 European Baseball Championship. Israel won the best-of-three playoff series 2–0, and thereby qualified for the 2019 European Baseball Championship.\nIn preparation for possible qualification by Israel to play baseball at the 2020 Summer Olympics, 10 American baseball players made \"aliyah\" in 2018 in order to qualify under the citizenship requirement for the 2019 European Baseball Championships and the Olympics. The players were Corey Baker, Eric Brodkowitz, Gabe Cramer, Blake Gailen, Alex Katz, Jonathan de Marte, Jon Moscot, Joey Wagman, Zack Weiss, and Jeremy Wolf (who lives in Tel Aviv). They were followed in 2019 by Jeremy Bleich, Ty Kelly, Nick Rickles, Danny Valencia, and Ben Wanger.\nIn Round 1 of the 2019 European Baseball Championship, Israel went 4–1 (defeating world # 18 the Czech Republic, Sweden, Germany, and Great Britain while losing to the Netherlands). The team thereby advanced to the Championship's eight-team playoffs, with Mitch Glasser leading all Championship batters in runs with 7, and Blake Gailen tied with Germany's Marco Cardoso for the lead in hits, with 8. In the Championship playoffs, Israel defeated Team France in the quarterfinals, lost to Team Italy in the semi-finals, and came in fourth. In the Championship, Joey Wagman led all pitchers with a 0.00 ERA over 10.2 innings.\n2021 European Baseball Championship; silver medal.\nAt the 2021 European Baseball Championship held September 12–19, 2021, in Turin, Italy, Israel won the silver medal. Third baseman Assaf Lowengart led the Championship with 13 RBIs and tied for the lead in home runs with four, second baseman Mitch Glasser was 5th with an on base percentage of .615, and shortstop Ty Kelly was 5th with seven walks. Joey Wagman led the Championship with 18 strikeouts and tied for the lead with 16 innings pitched, and Ben Wanger tied for the lead with two wins.\nOlympics.\n2020 Olympics.\nBecause Team Israel finished in the top five in the 2019 European Baseball Championship, it earned the right to participate in the 2020 Olympics qualifiers. That round robin tournament took place in Italy between September 18 and 22, 2019. As the winner of that tournament it qualified to be one of the six national teams that competed at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.\nThe Israeli team started strong at the September 2019 Africa/Europe Qualifying Event, by defeating all three 2019 European Baseball Championship medalists - world # 8 Netherlands, world # 16 Italy, and Spain, before losing to the Czech Republic. In its final game, Israel beat South Africa 11–1 in a game that was stopped in the 7th inning due to the mercy rule. Team Israel won the tournament with a 4–1 record. It thereby qualified to be one of six national baseball teams that competed in the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. First baseman/DH Danny Valencia batted .375 and led the tournament in runs (7), home runs (3), RBIs (9), walks (5), and slugging percentage (1.000), and starting pitcher Joey Wagman tied for the tournament lead with two wins, and led in complete games (1) and strikeouts (14) as he had an 0.56 ERA in 16 innings.\nEvery member of the 24-member Team Israel that competed to qualify in the Olympics was Israeli, with four of the players native-born. The others made \"aliyah\" to Israel, under Israel's Law of Return, which gives anyone with a Jewish parent, grandparent, or spouse the right to return to Israel and be granted Israeli citizenship. Native-born Israeli team member Shlomo Lipetz observed: \"There is no other country like Israel that carries an identity as it does with Jews around the world. We’re not the only team here with citizens that don't live in the country. There were other teams like Spain that had 22 Venezuelans and two Spaniards. But they didn't have that connection. This wasn't just a group of people, All-Stars who came together. It was people who all had a Bar Mitzvah. We were joking around that everyone will post their Bar Mitzvah photo.\"\nAt the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo in the summer of 2021, Israel beat Mexico and finished fifth after going 1-4 and losing to the Dominican Republic 7-6 in the Round 2 Repechage. The Israel national baseball team that competed at the 2020 Summer Olympics was composed mostly of American Jews who were dual American-Israeli citizens, in addition to four Israeli-born players. Danny Valencia tied for the lead in the Olympics with three home runs, tied for second with six runs and seven RBIs, and had the fourth-best slugging percentage (.778), Ryan Lavarnway had the 5th-best slugging percentage (.700), and Mitch Glasser's .474 on base percentage was 5th-best at the Games.\nPast rosters.\n2020 Olympics.\n&lt;section end=ISR/&gt;"

The first Serbian baseball club was formed in the late 80s as part of the JSD Partizan society, with their first match being in late May 1989 against Varaždin 1181 in Belgrade, the first recorded match there since 1935. BK Partizan played in the second tier of the Yugoslavian baseball league until the breakup of Yugoslavia. With the breakup of Yugoslavia, in order to maintain baseball's continued domestic survival, BK Partizan split into two teams, leading to the formation of BK Kings, based in Košutnjak. Alongside BK Dogs, based in Batajnica, BK Sleepers, based in Kragujevac (otherwise known at the time as the 'American Embassy' team), and BK Orlovi, the national league of what was now Serbia and Montenegro (FR Yugoslavia) continued from 1993 on, with its national team forming in 1994, and the Yugoslavian Baseball Federation (now Serbian Baseball Federation) being founded the same year.\nThe Yugoslavian Baseball Federation was admitted to the International Baseball Federation in 1995, and the Confederation of European Baseball in 1996. That same year, the national team participated in the B-group European Baseball Championship in Great Britain, recording five defeats. BK Kings and BK Dogs would merge into BK Beograd '96, and would help record the national team's first victory against Lithuania in 1998 on the B-group European Championships in Stockerau, Austria, finishing the championship with three victories and one defeat. \nThe first dedicated baseball field in Serbia was built in 2001 on the Ada Ciganlija recreational ground in Belgrade, which helped the development of the sport. Some have since called for another court to be built in Novi Sad. By September 2017, at least 10 baseball clubs were playing nationally, with others having come and gone since.\nThe best performance of the national team since 1998 was achieved in the 2004 B-group championship in Germany, taking the fourth place. In the next two B-group championships, the team did not fare well. Afterward, Serbia won the 2016 C-group European Baseball Championship in Slovenia, thus qualifying for the B group, its best performance since 2004. Along with Poland, it hosted the B group European Championship in Belgrade, on 24–29 July 2017. In 2022, along with Bulgaria and Lithuania, it hosted the European Baseball Championship Qualifiers in Belgrade. Domestically, in 2020, Beograd '96 would be crowned national champions for the 20th time.\nRoster.\nSerbia's roster for the European Baseball Championship Qualifier 2022, the last official competition in which the team took part.\nTournament results.\nEuropean Baseball Championship - B-Pool\nEuropean Under-21 Baseball Championship"

He was educated at Llandovery College and Jesus College, Oxford, where he obtained an M.A. degree. Whilst he did not win a \"Blue\" for rugby, he was a triple \"Blue\" – he played cricket against Cambridge, won the hurdles race and threw the hammer. In all, he played five matches for Oxford University Cricket Club in 1876, scoring 76 runs and taking 17 wickets, his best bowling figures being 7 wickets for 35 runs.\nHe was a fullback and represented the Wales national rugby union team on five occasions (four times during the Home Nations Championship and one friendly). His debut for Wales was in a friendly on 28 January 1882 against Ireland, when he converted two tries. This was only the second match that Wales had played. In the following season, he played against England and Scotland, scoring a further conversion against Scotland. In the next year, he again played against England and Scotland, and converted a try against England. He was captain of Wales in his first three matches.\nLewis was the representative of Llandovery at the inaugural meeting of the Welsh Rugby Union in Neath on 12 March 1881. He was at that time a schoolmaster in Llandovery. Llandovery RFC is recognised as one of the founder-members of the WRU on account of his representation of the town at the meeting. He became the first president of Llandovery RFC in 1885. He worked as a solicitor in Llandovery. He was a member of the MCC and was once picked to play for England against Australia but failed to make the journey. He was a member of the town council in Llandovery (1889–1920), becoming an alderman in 1899 and twice serving as mayor (1894–95, 1904–05). He was appointed as a magistrate for Carmarthenshire in 1898. He died on 27 May 1923."

It determined the champion of the PCC for the 1943 season, and the USC Trojans shut out the Washington Huskies 29–0 in a one-sided game.\nUSC backup quarterback Jim Hardy threw three touchdown passes to lead the Trojans to their seventh Rose Bowl victory and eighth PCC championship.\nFor the first time, the Rose Bowl was broadcast on the radio abroad to all American servicemen, with General Eisenhower in Western Europe allowing all troops who were not on the front lines to tune in and listen.\nTeams.\nWashington Huskies.\nFavored Washington won all four of its games in an abbreviated season without any PCC matchups, as the other five programs in the Northern Division were on hiatus in 1943 (and 1944).

The Rose Bowl was the Huskies' sole conference game of the season; the three teams of the Southern Division (USC, UCLA and California) played each other twice; Stanford was on hiatus until the 1946 season.\nWashington's most recent game was two months earlier on October 30, and they had lost a dozen players to active military duty since, including two of their best backs, Jay Stoves (a transfer from idle Washington State) and Pete Susick. Head coach Ralph Welch filled roster holes with Navy V-12 trainees and draft rejects who recently arrived at campus, leaving only 28 players available for the game. Oddsmakers made the Huskies two-touchdown favorites to beat USC, but the fielded team differed greatly from that of the regular season."

It rows on the River Dee and has around 30 km of rowable river, much of which straight and broad.\nThe club colours are dark blue \nand orange.\nHistory.\nGrosvenor ( ) or is named in honour of the Grosvenor family who own the land on which the club is built. The club names its eights (8+s) after members of the family. The club was formed in 1869 to enable the less fortunate people of Chester to take up the sport of rowing. The club's crest states \"Virtus non stemma\" which translates to \"Valor, not garland\" or \"Virtue, not pedigree\" derived from the motto of the Duke of Westminster's Eaton Hall home (hist. Earl Grosvenor) which is their surname, which is further up the Dee. The motto also sums up the open membership of the club since its inauguration; originally contrasting to the closed membership of Royal Chester Rowing Club which was traditionally home to the alumni of the \"public\" independent King's School, Chester. Today the rivalry is sporting rather than based on social class as both clubs have completely open membership policies.\nIn 2019 the club celebrated its 150th anniversary and were honoured to be granted a row-past by Sir Steve Redgrave on the Saturday lunchtime of Henley Royal Regatta.\nRecent results.\nIn 2019 (the club's 150 year) Lucy Iball, in the Aspirational Single Sculls (A1x), won the Bernard Churcher Trophy at Henley Women's Regatta. She also became the club's first-ever women's sculler to qualify for Henley Royal Regatta in the Princess Royal Challenge Cup\n2014 saw the Grosvenor senior women's intermediate club fours win The Lester Trophy at Henley Women's Regatta.\nGrosvenor's men's 1st VIII/8+ finished 14th at the 2008 Head of the River Race after starting 153rd, beaten narrowly to the Jackson Trophy (One of three regional cups, namely for British non-tideway, non-Thames basin clubs) by 5 seconds by Agecroft Rowing Club, Manchester who finished 11th. The latter boat was seeded in 37th place which can provide flatter water.\nIn 2008 the men's 1st 8+ reached the quarter-finals of the Thames Challenge Cup at Henley Royal Regatta emulating the club's successes at the 2007 regatta.\nIn 2007 Grosvenor's Coxless Four (4-) which reached the semi-finals at Henley Royal Regatta in the Wyfold Challenge Cup.

        "text": "In ice hockey, a pass is the movement of the puck from one player to another, usually by a motion of the stick. A pass differs from a shot, in that a pass is typically weaker than a shot and is not directed at the opponent's net with the intention of scoring a goal. The function of passing in ice hockey during gameplay strongly resembles the role of passing in other goal sports such as soccer and lacrosse. Passing (along with skating, shooting, and stick handling) is one of the most fundamental skills in hockey. An effective pass is described as being \"stick to stick\" or \"tape to tape\", referring to the tape on the blade of a hockey stick. Effective passing requires good vision, anticipation, and timing, as well as execution. A player that is an effective passer will normally record many assists, which are awarded to the second and third to last player to touch the puck before a goal. The National Hockey League record for most career assists is 1,963 by Wayne Gretzky, who is considered one of the best passers of all time.\nDifferent types of passes are employed in different situations or using different techniques:"

The biggest shock was when Gary Mawson beat world number one and five-time former World Champion, Raymond van Barneveld in the last 32. Current World Champion, John Part went out in round two to Roger Carter who also progressed to the last 16. Bill Davis beat Tony Eccles to reach Saturday's main stage competition.

World number seven, Andy Hamilton, was beaten in the third round by Buddy Lessig. Number three seed, James Wade withdrew from the event due to illness. Out of the top 8 seeds, only two, Phil Taylor and Roland Scholten, made it to the last 16.\nSaturday 17th May.\nThe fifth round action opened with David Fatum being the first player and first American to reach the quarter-finals, beating out fellow countryman Bill Davis. Davis however did save some face with a 164 checkout, the highest of the night. Roger Carter was another American player to lose out, to Chris Mason. Mark Dudbridge also put on an impressive display in beating Dave Honey in straight sets.\nVeteran Dennis Priestley moved into the quarters, dropping only one leg against Adrian Gray. Phil Taylor continued his imposing form, averaging 107 against Colin Osborne, who did take a set out of 'The Power'. American Gary Mawson, who had earlier knocked out the number one seed Raymond van Barneveld, lost 3–1 to Blackpool's Ronnie Baxter, and Colin Lloyd also looked to be in menacing form, not dropping a leg against world number eight Roland Scholten. The biggest shock of the night came with America's Ray Carver beating Wayne Mardle 3–1 in a high quality match including a 131 checkout from Carver.\nResults.\nTotal Prize Fund £126,000 (unchanged from 2007)\nEarlier rounds.\nThird round.\nLosers £1,000\nFourth round.\nLosers £1,500\nNorth American Darts Championship.\nFor the first time the PDC staged a large tournament available only to citizens and Green Card holders from the US and Canada. The tournament was worth $50,000, with $15,000 going to the winner. It was played separately from the US Open on the 16th and 17 May, though players could enter for both tournaments. Darin Young, who had been knocked out in the first round of the US Open, emerged the victor.\nOn the first night the main shock was the defeat of World Champion and number one seed John Part, who was beaten by Buddy Lessig in the third round. The number two seed, Gerry Convery, also lost in the second round to Paul Lim. Leading American and third seed Ray Carver was defeated in the fifth round by Brad Wethington and John Kuczynski was beaten in the quarters by Brian Blake.\nThe second night saw the semi-finals and final being played out. Number eight seed Darin Young beat out Bill Davis in a close 7–5 game in the first semi-final, while Brad Wethington just beat Chris White in a 7–6 affair. The final followed suit. Wethington missed a dart to win the title before Young came back to win 8–7 and claim the title. Young said it was 'the biggest win of [his] career'. That moment was dubbed the 'most interesting' part of the Championship."

The supervising body is the Slovak Basketball Association (SBA).\nSlovakia is one of the newest national basketball teams in the world, having split from Czechoslovakia following the dissolution of the unified state in 1993. They joined FIBA later that year, and played in their first international match against Bosnia and Herzegovina. Slovakia to date does not have much history on the international level. Although they have attempted to qualify for major tournaments such as EuroBasket and the FIBA World Cup, but have yet to reach qualification.\nHistory.\nThe Czechoslovak era.\nUntil 1993, Slovakia was a part of Czechoslovakia, with Slovak born players taking part on the Czechoslovakia national team. One of the most notable players who was born in Slovakia, and played for the Czechoslovakia national team to achieve success at the international level was Stanislav Kropilák. He helped lead Czechoslovakia to three medal finishes at the EuroBasket, in 1977, 1981, and 1985.\nAfter independence.\nAfter gaining independence from Czechoslovakia, the Slovak national team on numerous attempts during their early years strived to qualify for EuroBasket, but ultimately came up short. In qualification to reach EuroBasket 2017, Slovakia was slotted into Group F to begin the qualifiers. Slovakia, however, would go on to struggle to a (1–5) record and missing their chance to qualify.\nFor qualification to the 2019 FIBA World Cup, Slovakia took part in European Pre-Qualifiers, but were eventually eliminated after amassing a (1–5) record in their group.

        "text": "Quaker Ridge Golf Club is a private golf club in Scarsdale, New York, that contains the Quaker Ridge Golf Course. Additionally, club grounds encompass numerous tennis courts, a swimming pool, a clubhouse and many other structures along the property.\nHistory.\nThe club was formed as a Jewish country club in 1916 by a group of businessmen who had acquired the land a year earlier from a smaller, financially strained club. Renowned golf course designer A. W. Tillinghast was brought in to redesign the seven existing holes and construct 11 new ones. The course was completed in 1918 and the Tudor-styled clubhouse was built in 1923. In 1925, the purchase of additional property prompted the club to recommission Tillinghast to incorporate the new land into the existing course. The course has remained relatively unchanged since its construction. A few outdated bunkers were replaced in 1965. Between 1991 and 1993 all the bunkers were restored and several tees were added. Among its many noted features, the course has distinctly narrow fairways.\nJohnny Farrell was the head professional at the Quaker Ridge from 1919–1930. Mario Guerra is the current head professional.\nQuaker Ridge has hosted a number of tournaments including two Metropolitan Amateurs, three Metropolitan Opens, two Metropolitan PGA Championships and the 1997 Walker Cup. Quaker Ridge also hosted the Curtis Cup in 2018.\nIn 1969, Jimmy Demaret stated, \"Quaker Ridge is the most underrated golf course in the New York area, because it has never been host course to a major championship. I'd like to go on record as saying it would be a tough test of golf for any tournament – the U.S. Open and the PGA included.\" Two-time PGA Champion Paul Runyan, who played the 1936 Metropolitan Open at Quaker, said that Quaker Ridge \"is the greatest golf course in the world.\"\nIn 2008, \"Golf Digest\" rated Quaker Ridge the 30th best course in the United States. The course was also ranked 64th in the world in 2007 by \"Golf Magazine\"."

        "text": "William Oliver Gilbert (June 21, 1876 – August 8, 1927) was an American professional baseball second baseman who played from the 1890s through 1912. Gilbert played in Major League Baseball from 1901 to 1909, for the Milwaukee Brewers, Baltimore Orioles, New York Giants, and St. Louis Cardinals.\nStanding at just , Gilbert was a weak hitter but a good defensive second baseman. He did hit .313 in the 1905 World Series, which the Giants won.\nBaseball career.\nEarly career.\nGilbert made his professional baseball debut in minor league baseball with Lewiston of the Maine State League and the Pawtucket Phenoms and Fall River Indians of the Class-B New England League in 1897. He pitched for the Lyons franchise and the Johnston/Palmyra Mormans in the New York State League in 1898. Now rated a Class-C league, Gilbert returned to the New York State League to play for the Utica Pent-Ups in 1899.\nThe Milwaukee Brewers of the American League (AL) drafted Gilbert in 1900. They assigned him to the Syracuse Stars of the Class-A Eastern League for the season.\nMLB career.\nGilbert made his MLB debut with the Brewers in 1901. After the season, Baltimore Orioles player-manager John McGraw bought his contract from the Brewers prior to the 1902 season.\nMcGraw jumped to the New York Giants of the National League during the 1902 season. He signed Gilbert to the Giants for the 1903 season and installed him as the team's starting second baseman. Not a highly regarded hitter, Gilbert contributed with his bat as the Giants defeated the Philadelphia Athletics in the 1905 World Series, leading the team in batting average during the series.\nHe played with the Giants through the 1906 season. Down the stretch in 1906, McGraw replaced Gilbert with Sammy Strang, who produced better offense. After the season, the Giants tried to assign Gilbert to the Newark Indians of the Class-A Eastern League. Not wanting to play in Newark, Gilbert refused to report. Wanting to stay in the NL, Gilbert attempted to negotiate a contract with the Brooklyn Superbas.\nUnable to sign with Brooklyn, he contemplated signing with an outlaw team. Instead, Gilbert played for the Trenton Tigers of the Class-B Tri-State League in 1907, and coached the Columbia Lions, the college baseball team of Columbia University.\nGilbert returned to MLB in 1908 with the St. Louis Cardinals. After the Cardinals fired John McCloskey as their manager after the 1908 season, Gilbert was considered for the job. They instead acquired Roger Bresnahan and made him their player-manager. He made his final MLB appearance on June 27, 1909, and served as a Cardinals' scout during the remainder of the season. He was released by Cardinals manager Roger Bresnahan, a former teammate with the Giants, in March 1910.\nLater career.\nGilbert played for the Albany Senators of the now Class-B New York State League in 1910. He served as player-manager for the Erie Sailors when they competed in the Class-C Ohio–Pennsylvania League in 1911 and the Class-B Central League in 1912. Gilbert stayed with Erie, competing in the Class-B Interstate League, as manager in 1913. He was fired after the season.\nGilbert spent the next few seasons managing independent teams in New York. Gilbert was hired to manage the Waterbury Brasscos in the Class-A Eastern League in 1921 and 1922, leading them to a second-place finish. He managed the Denver Bears of the Class-A Western League in 1923, and Pittsfield Hillies in the Eastern League in 1924. Gilbert then served as a scout for the Newark Indians of the Class-AA International League.\nDuring his career, Gilbert was highly regarded for his work ethic. He was described as taking after McGraw.\nLater life.\nGilbert died on August 8, 1927, at his home in New York as a result of apoplexy. He attended a doubleheader in Newark the day before, and was reportedly in good health."

        "title": "Ice hockey in popular culture",
        "text": "Ice hockey, partially because of its popularity as a major professional sport, has been a source of inspiration for numerous films, television episodes and songs in North American popular culture.\nFilms.\nA number of notable Hollywood films have been made about hockey. Notable hockey films include \"Slap Shot\"; \"The Mighty Ducks\", successful enough to spawn two sequels, a cartoon series, and an NHL team named the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim (now the Anaheim Ducks); and \"Miracle\". The first two are fictional comedies; the last is a drama based on the true story of the 1980 \"Miracle on Ice\" USA Olympic gold medal team.\nOther hockey films include \"Youngblood,\" \"Hockey Night\", ', \"H-E Double Hockey Sticks\", \"Mystery, Alaska\", \"The Rocket: The Maurice Richard Story\", \"The Sweater\", ', 2010's Canadian produced miniseries \"\", its 2012 follow up, \"s\" and the 1937 John Wayne film \"Idol of the Crowds\".\nOne of the earliest commercial films that featured the sport prominently was the 1972 Canadian production \"Face-Off\", starring Art Hindle. Many other films are less hockey-oriented but nonetheless prominently involve the sport. \"Ice Angel\" involves a male ice hockey player who dies and comes back to life in the body of a female figure skater. Both \"Happy Gilmore\" and \"The Cutting Edge\" centre around failed hockey players using their talents for other sports (golf and figure skating, respectively), while \"Wayne's World\" contains a number of prominent references to the sport during the film. The movie \"Big Daddy\" features actor Adam Sandler watching a hockey game involving the New York Rangers. The Jean-Claude Van Damme vehicle \"Sudden Death\" is set and shot entirely in the Pittsburgh Civic Arena, the (supposed) stage for the seventh game of the Stanley Cup Finals. In the movie \"The Town\", bank robber Doug MacRay (played by Ben Affleck) is a former draft pick of the Boston Bruins whose hockey career derails because of his propensity to get into fights with his teammates. In another Boston-based movie, \"The Friends of Eddie Coyle\", Eddie (played by Robert Mitchum) is taken to a Boston Bruins game (against the Chicago Black Hawks during the 1972–1973 season at the old Boston Garden) right before he is killed. Upon watching Bruins great Bobby Orr, he states \"Can you imagine being a kid like that? What is he, 24 or something? Greatest hockey player in the world. Number four – Bobby Orr. Geeze, what a future he’s got, huh?\" The Canadian buddy cop film \"Bon Cop, Bad Cop\" features a by-the-book English Canadian teamed with a rule-bending French Canadian to investigate a series of murders connected to professional hockey.\nIn Quebec, the 1997 film \"Les Boys\" is a cult classic for many hockey fans, enough to spawn three sequels. The fourth installment of \"Les Boys\" featured \"Hockey Legends\" such as Guy Lafleur, Pierre Bouchard, Martin Brodeur, Yvon Lambert and more.\nHockey has also been referenced many times in the series known as the View Askew Movies, which were written and directed by actor/director/writer/hockey fan Kevin Smith. His first movie, \"Clerks\", featured a street hockey game played on the roof of a store, but many of the players in the game wore ice hockey jerseys, including jerseys of the New Jersey Devils, Pittsburgh Penguins and the Soviet Union. \"Mallrats\" shows the character Brodie (Jason Lee) playing an ice hockey game on the Sega Genesis game console. \"Chasing Amy\" includes a scene in which Joey Lauren Adams and Ben Affleck attending a high school ice hockey game. \"Dogma\" did not feature ice hockey but included three street hockey playing teenagers as henchmen for a demon. More recent, Smith's film \"Zack and Miri Make a Porno\" features a rec league ice hockey scene, several Pittsburgh Penguins references and a scene outside Mellon Arena.\nIn the animated motion picture \"A Boy Named Charlie Brown\" (1969), Snoopy skates on the ice rink at Rockefeller Center in New York City, fantasizing about scoring the winning goal in the final game of the Stanley Cup playoffs.\nRyan O'Neal's character in the international hit 1970 film \"Love Story\" (based on the novel of the same name by Erich Segal) was a hockey player for his college.\nWhile \"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation\" was not a hockey movie, Chevy Chase's lead character, Clark Griswold, was famous for wearing a light Chicago Blackhawks jersey with \"Griswold\" and the numbers \"00\" on it during certain scenes. It also plays a part in Disney Channel original movies \"Go Figure\" and \"Genius\", and romantic comedy \"Just Friends\".\nThe 1986 film \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" features Ferris's best friend Cameron wearing a vintage Detroit Red Wings Gordie Howe jersey through most of the movie.\nIn the 1996 cult favorite \"Swingers\", Trent (played by Vince Vaughn) is playing an NHL 93 video game with his friends and extolling the toughness of Jeremy Roenick (then of the Chicago Blackhawks) and takes delight in bashing Wayne Gretzky (then of the Los Angeles Kings) in the game.\nIn the film \"The Love Guru\", Mike Myers is hired by the Toronto Maple Leafs as a counsel to their star player.\nDwayne Johnson starred in the film \"The Tooth Fairy\", where he played an ice hockey player forced to moonlight as a tooth fairy.\nThe 2012 film \"Goon\" starred Seann William Scott as a bouncer from Boston who becomes an enforcer in a Canadian hockey league.\nThe 2013 Russian film \"Legend № 17\", a biopic of Russian ice hockey legend Valeri Kharlamov from early childhood, rising to the pinnacle of the sport and his untimely death.\nTelevision.\nUnited States.\nHockey also frequently shows up in American television, particularly in shows set in the colder regions of the US, such as the Northeast and Midwest. One of the recurring characters on \"Cheers\" was Eddie LeBec, a French-Canadian Boston Bruins goalie who married regular character Carla Tortelli. LeBec later was cut from the team and joined a traveling ice show; the character was eventually killed off. One memorable episode of \"Seinfeld\", \"The Face Painter\", involves the antics of Elaine's face-painting boyfriend Puddy, a rabid New Jersey Devils fan, and Jerry's stubborn refusal to thank an acquaintance for New York Rangers playoff tickets after the game when he had already thanked him numerous times beforehand. In \"NYPD Blue\", the character of PA Donna Abandando, played by Gail O'Grady and a love interest of Detective Greg Medavoy in season 3, was a noted New York Rangers fan, having previously dated one of the players. Her Rangers pennant famously hung over her desk at the front of the squad room. Many episodes of \"Home Improvement\" included references to the Detroit Red Wings and in one episode, Tim and his neighbour Wilson are at a game when Wilson wins the door prize. Many \"Friends\" episodes also involve Joey, Chandler, and Ross attending New York Rangers games. While it is true they are Ranger fans, a Detroit Red Wings jersey can also be seen hanging below a goalie mask in Joey and Chandler's apartment in season two.\nIn an episode of \"The Simpsons\", \"Lisa on Ice\", Bart is the star of his peewee hockey team, the Mighty Pigs, coached by Chief Wiggum. Lisa is eventually forced to become a goaltender on an opposing team—the Kwik-E-Mart Gougers, coached by Apu—to avoid a failing grade in gym, and she blossoms from a nervous wreck to an intimidating star. Eventually, the two teams play each other. Towards the end of the game, Bart is awarded a penalty shot, but before he shoots, he thinks of all his memories with Lisa.

Then Avalanche team is replaced (on their suggestion) by 2- and 3-year-old kids due to \"mental hell they had\" (kids were meant to play with other kids between intermissions and they promised to their friend suffering leukemia that they will win for him). Kids obviously cannot rivalize with professional hockey players and they lose 31-2 and in addition all kids are getting injured due to extremely brutal play from Red Wings including intentional skate kicks and punching. Red Wings are celebrating win and kid with leukemia dies \"just because they lost match, so he lost with sickness\". Also in the episode \"It's Christmas in Canada\", when the boys are in Canada, one of the members of the Canadian crowd is an ice hockey player, no doubt a reference to the popularity of the sport in Canada.\nThe FX show \"Rescue Me\", starring Denis Leary, featured hockey games as an integral part of several episodes.

Angela asks Tony what the red circle on the ice is for, and Tony indicates that it is blood (humorously furthering the stereotype of hockey violence). In \"Scrubs\", Dr. Cox frequently wears a Detroit Red Wings jersey while not at the hospital; this is because of John C. McGinley's real-life friendship with Red Wings defenceman Chris Chelios. Joey from \"Full House\" also frequently wears Detroit Red Wings jerseys on the show, while his room is also decorated with several pieces of Detroit Red Wings decorations.\n\"House M.D.\" is filled with reference to the sport.

At the beginning of the episode Unfaithful a homeless man is offered a New York Rangers sweatshirt to which he jokingly responds \"Are you crazy? We're here in Jersey\". The cold opener of the season 8 episode Perils of Paranoia features an attorney knocking down an alibi by demonstrating that the defendant read about a New Jersey Devils game in the paper rather than watching it on TV.

In the popular Canadian animated series \"The Raccoons\", ice hockey played a big role in the 1981 special 'The Raccoons on Ice'. CBC and its French language division, SRC, have made several entries into the \"He Shoots, He Scores\"/\"Lance et Compte\" franchise. The original series was filmed in both French and English, while subsequent series and movies have just been in French. The CBC premiered the hockeydrama \"MVP\" in January 2008. Long running Canadian comedy series \"The Red Green Show\" incorporated a hockey reference on each program as Red Green would end each show by saying, \"Keep your stick on the ice.\" Popular television comedy series Letterkenny creator Jared Keeso prominently featured ice hockey in that Crave/Bell Media production. Before Letterkenny ended, Keeso created a hockey specific spinoff series which he writes as well as plays the eponymous character \"Shoresy\", Captain of the Sudbury Blueberry Bulldogs, who vows the team will never lose again. It has been praised by fans who watched the Letterkenny series as well as new viewers who tuned in for the hockey. Critics often remark on its authenticity to both the sport and those who participate in it.\nJapan.\nThe Fuji TV-produced drama \"Pride\" (2004) centred on Satonaka Haru, played by Takuya Kimura, whose life revolves around ice hockey and dreams of moving to Canada to play in the NHL.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the UK a \"Pingu\" episode called \"Pingu Plays Ice Hockey\" was produced in 1989 which featured Pingu, Robby, Pongi, and various hockey players.\nComics.\nCharles Schulz's character Snoopy is well known for his love of ice hockey.

Snoopy would occasionally join his human friends on the ice (once drawing a two-minute penalty for kissing Lucy on the nose during the face-off). In the off-season, Snoopy would sometimes “skate” barefooted atop his doghouse, wielding his hockey stick, and fantasizing about winning the Stanley Cup. Linus, watching from below, would be the “hockey fans”. In one strip, Linus challenges Snoopy: \"Prove to me that you're a real hockey player.\" Snoopy grins, revealing that several of his front teeth have been knocked out. Linus walks away, convinced. In later years, Snoopy would play ice hockey with his bird pal Woodstock and his bird friends, using a frozen birdbath as the skating rink.\nYouth hockey is celebrated in cartoons and comic strips such as \"Small Saves\".\nCanadian comic book artist Jeff Lemire created the series \"Essex County\", set in his hometown.

Warren Zevon is known for a hockey song called \"Hit Somebody! (The Hockey Song)\" from his 2002 album \"My Ride's Here\". The song's title is in reference to the commonplace fights that tend to break out between players during games and tells the tale of Buddy, a Canadian farmboy turned hockey goon. \"The Hockey Theme\", the long-time theme music of \"Hockey Night in Canada\" (now the theme song for the \"NHL on TSN\"), has been described as \"Canada's second national anthem\".\nThere are several less well-known songs which either directly or indirectly feature hockey references and hockey teams, such as \"Zamboni\" (a reference to the machine used to resurface the ice between periods and after games) by the Gear Daddies; \"Helmethead\" by Great Big Sea, which details the romantic exploits of an AHL player; and \"Time to Go\" by the Dropkick Murphys, which references hockey directly, as well as the colours of Boston's NHL team, the Boston Bruins (black and gold).\nInstrumental-only songs that have become associated with ice hockey include \"Nutty\" by The Ventures, itself likely based on the B. Bumble and the Stingers' earlier, and similar work Nut Rocker, as \"Nutty\" was used by television station WSBK-TV for their Boston Bruins telecast theme for over twenty years, and was used later for some years by NESN for their Bruins telecasts, and \"Brass Bonanza\", used for the now-defunct Hartford Whalers NHL team's games at the start of a home game.\nCanadian band The Tragically Hip has a number of songs that with hockey references, including \"Fifty Mission Cap\", about former Toronto Maple Leaf Bill Barilko, \"Fireworks\", and \"Lonely End of the Rink\".

The Misfits recorded the song \"I Wanna Be a New York Ranger\".\nSwedish hardcore band 59 Times the Pain have recorded the song \"2 Minutes remaining in the 3rd\" on their album \"More Out of Today\", a song explicitly talking about ice hockey; in their video clip for the song \"More Out of Today\", the singer of the band wears a Chicago Blackhawks jersey.\nCanadian punk rock band Propagandhi have made numerous references to the sport in their lyrics, with ice hockey often being used as a political metaphor.

After two trophy-less seasons and a failure to get out of the pool in Europe, Richards left the club in February 2004, ending a 23-year association with the club.\nGrenoble.\nIn June 2004, Richards was appointed as coach at French club FC Grenoble for the following season. Grenoble struggled in the French rugby championship and it was announced in May 2005 that Richards would leave the club at the end of the season by mutual consent.\nHarlequins.\nHe was appointed Director of Rugby at Harlequins in May 2005 following their relegation from the Zurich Premiership in the 2004–05 season, and led them back to the Premiership at the first attempt, in a season where they lost only one league game.\nBloodgate.\nRichards resigned from Harlequins in August 2009 after an incident which became known as Bloodgate. He had orchestrated and had \"central control\" over a fake blood injury to Harlequins player Tom Williams to bring a more experienced replacement kicker onto the field during a Heineken Cup match against Leinster. With the game poised at 6-5 late in the second half, a successful penalty kick would have resulted in a place in the semifinals for Harlequins. Richards was found to have been involved in four similar incidents, and was banned from coaching for three seasons.\nHarlequins were fined £259,000, and Williams was banned for four months. Harlequins' physiotherapist Steph Brennan was banned for two years. The doctor involved, Wendy Chapman, who cut the player's lip to try to cover up the incident, was reprimanded by the Medical Council, but escaped a ban.\nNewcastle.\nIn spring 2012 Richards was named Director of Rugby at Newcastle Falcons when his ban ended in August and, as he had with Harlequins, led Newcastle to promotion back to the Premiership at the first attempt.\nRichards led the Falcons to an 8th-place finish in the 2016-17 Aviva Premiership, with Falcons ending up just 3 points off the top 6. This was their best finish in 11 years, and their biggest number of wins in 15 years.\nIn May 2022, it was announced that Richards would be stepping down as Director of Rugby at the end of the season but continuing to work as a part-time consultant for the Falcons."

        "title": "WWE Legends of WrestleMania",
        "text": "WWE Legends of WrestleMania is a professional wrestling video game featuring legends of the professional wrestling promotion, World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), who have appeared at WrestleManias 1 to XV in the 1980s and 1990s; during that time, WWE was known as the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). The game was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in March 2009 to coincide with WrestleMania 25. The game was developed by Yuke's and published by THQ, the same developer and publisher for the \"WWE SmackDown vs. Raw\" video game series. The retro WWE logo featured in the game was a slight modification of the 1980s and early 1990s WWF logo to match the letter design of the current logo. Unlike all other \"WWE Smackdown vs. Raw\" games released, this game was not ported over to the PlayStation 2 or Wii.\nGameplay.\nMatch gameplay.\nThe game features a new grapple-based combo fighting system. To differentiate itself from the \"SmackDown\" series, \"Legends of WrestleMania\" focuses more on arcade-style gameplay (similar to \"WWF WrestleFest\") with only the D-pad (or left analog stick) and the four face buttons needed on the gamepad. During play, the player's HUD features a health bar and a number between one and three. After successful chains of attacks, the number increases with more devastating moves now available. After completing the third level of moves, the wrestler's finishing move can then be performed. Continuous chains of moves are performed by pressing a button allocated by the screen before the player's opponent can. If the opponent beats the player at this, then the move is blocked and the chain is broken. Each wrestler has five taunts, which will either increase his health meter or his speed, among others. In addition, when a wrestler is being pinned, a meter displays that determines how likely it is for the opponent to kick out of the pin. Unlike the \"WWE SmackDown\" games, a submission meter is the only indication to specific damaged body parts, as opposed to a body model located in the HUD.\nManagers play a significant part of the game, and interfere on behalf of their clients. Four such managers appear in the game: Bobby Heenan, Jimmy Hart, Mr. Fuji, and Paul Bearer. Features similar to the \"SmackDown\" series such as create-a-legend mode and online gameplay are also featured in the game. There are many new moves created for this game, along with most moves that appeared in \"Smackdown vs. Raw 2009\". Most moves were used for \"SvR 2010\". A new mode featured is the \"WrestleMania Tour\" where classic WrestleMania matches can be recreated with classic WWE footage included to introduce the bout. The game also includes a feature to import the full playable roster from \"SvR 09\" (excluding Big Daddy V, Chuck Palumbo, Elijah Burke, Lance Cade, Paul London, Trevor Murdoch, the Masked Man and Tony).\nGame modes.\nThe game features a WrestleMania Tour mode consisting of three options: Relive, Rewrite, and Redefine. In Relive, the player can play as a legend that won a match over a certain wrestler. Rewrite allows the player to play as the loser of a certain historic match in order to \"rewrite\" history. The player in this mode can watch a recap of the history of certain wrestlers, a recap of their feud, and a recap of their match at WrestleMania. In this mode, the player must complete certain objectives, besides winning the match. In Redefine, the player chooses any wrestler to play and the ability to change the match type. A Movie Theater is available to watch all unlocked match clips. The match types are Single, Tag Team, Triple Threat, Steel Cage, Ladder, Submission, Iron Man, Handicap, Hell in a Cell, and Royal Rumble.\nAnother game mode is the Legend Killer mode. The mode features six tiers, with four tiers having ten legends waiting to challenge the player, and the two others will have all the Legends from the game and a tier list for the Superstars from \"SvR 09\" respectively. This mode is used to enhance the player's Create-a-Legend attributes. Also featured is a Hall of Fame Mode, allowing players to view what they have unlocked.\nRoster.\nThe game features 38 playable characters by default, and 4 non-playable managers, while match commentary is provided by Jim Ross and Jerry Lawler. Players could extend the roster by choosing the \"Import \"WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009\"\" option on the main menu. This would import most of the male characters from \"SvR 09\" into the game. Unlockable characters would only be available if they had been previously unlocked in \"SvR 09\", but female and downloadable content characters could not be imported. Each imported character had a unique moves set designed specifically for the \"WWE Legends of WrestleMania\" game. These moves sets became available automatically in \"Create-A-Moves-Set\" mode. This function required \"SvR 09\" to be loaded onto the console's internal memory, but once imported, the characters remained permanently unlocked in \"WWE Legends of WrestleMania\". Players did not need to retain the \"SvR 09\" game files on the internal memory in order to retain the characters. Big Daddy V, Chuck Palumbo, Elijah Burke, Hornswoggle, Lance Cade, Masked Man, Paul London, Tony, Trevor Murdoch and all the DLC characters could not be imported.\nPlayers could also create their own custom characters in \"Create-A-WWE-Legend\" mode. Alternatively, they could also import user-created characters from \"SvR 09\" save files. If the \"Import \"WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009\"\" function had been used, it made most entrance animations, videos and theme music from this edition available in the \"Create-An-Entrance\" modes.\nArenas.\nThe game features the arenas used from WrestleMania I to XV as a Royal Rumble arena based on the 1995 Royal Rumble. \nReception.\n\"WWE Legends of WrestleMania\" received \"mixed or average\" reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.\nSome critics praised the game's focus on nostalgia from the earlier days of the event. Other reviewers, such as GameSpot and IGN, criticized the game for being repetitive, lacking in replay value, being overly simplistic, and how wrestler models were beefed up to look too \"action figure\" like."

Rosburg made a run at Casper's lead when he holed out a bunker shot for birdie at 11 and made a putt for another birdie at 12 to draw even with Casper.

The difference for Casper proved to be his putting; he needed only 114 putts over 72 holes with 31 one-putts and just one three-putt.\nThis U.S. Open was the first to be played over four days; thunderstorms and heavy rain delayed third round play on Saturday morning and the final round was postponed to Sunday.\nThe final round at the U.S. Open was first scheduled for Sunday in 1965.\nCharlie Sifford, the pioneering African-American golfer, played in his first major championship, two years before the PGA of America allowed African-Americans to play on the PGA Tour; he finished in 32nd place.\nAmateur Jack Nicklaus, 19, played in his third straight U.S. Open but missed the cut for the second time with two rounds of 77.

Thomson won five British Opens, and his third consecutive (1954–56) came three weeks later at Royal Liverpool.\nSeveral future champions made their mark at this U.S. Open. Arnold Palmer, 26, recorded the first of his thirteen top ten finishes at the U.S. Open, six strokes back in seventh place. Ken Venturi captured low-amateur honors in eighth place, two months after he lost a four-stroke lead at The Masters with an 80 in the final round. Billy Casper, 24, made his major championship debut and finished 14th.\nDefending champion Jack Fleck, who upset Hogan in a Sunday playoff the year before at Olympic, shot 76-74 and missed the cut by a stroke. Jack Burke Jr., winner of the Masters two months earlier, also missed with a 152.\nA record-setting 13,914 were in attendance for the final two rounds on Saturday.\nThis was the first of three U.S. Opens at the East Course at Oak Hill; Lee Trevino won in 1968 and Curtis Strange successfully defended in 1989.

        "text": "The 1955 U.S. Open was the 55th U.S. Open, held June 16–19 at the Lake Course of the Olympic Club in San Francisco, California. In one of the greatest upsets in golf history, Jack Fleck, a municipal course pro from Iowa, prevailed in an 18-hole playoff to win his only major title and denied Ben Hogan a record fifth U.S. Open.\nFleck, 32, won two more titles on the PGA Tour and later won the Senior PGA Championship in 1979. He won the U.S. Open with clubs manufactured by Hogan's company.\nHogan, 42, never did win his fifth U.S. Open or a tenth major; he won just one more tour event the rest of his career, in 1959. It was his fourth and final playoff in a major championship, all at 18 holes. Hogan won at the U.S. Open in 1950 but lost twice by a stroke at the Masters, to Byron Nelson in 1942 and Sam Snead in 1954. He repeated as runner-up at the U.S. Open in 1956, and had top ten finishes in 1958, 1959, and 1960. (A pre-tournament favorite in 1957, he withdrew due to a back ailment before teeing off.) When the U.S. Open returned to Olympic in 1966, Hogan finished twelfth at age 53 and received a standing ovation at the 72nd green.\nByron Nelson came out of semi-retirement to play in his final U.S. Open and finished in 28th place. Arnold Palmer made the cut for the first time at the U.S. Open and finished in 21st. For the first time since 1919, Gene Sarazen did not play in the U.S. Open, ending a streak of 31 consecutive appearances.\nThis was the first U.S. Open at the Lake Course of the Olympic Club; it returned in 1966, 1987, 1998, and 2012.\nCourse layout.\nLake Course\nRound summaries.\nFirst round.\n\"Thursday, June 16, 1955\"\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, June 17, 1955\"\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, June 18, 1955 (morning)\"\nFinal round.\n\"Saturday, June 18, 1955 (afternoon)\"\nAfter Hogan made par on the 72nd hole to post a 287 total, most observers believed that he had already locked up the championship. Gene Sarazen, providing television commentary, congratulated him on the win and the NBC broadcast went off the air after proclaiming Hogan the champion. Fleck, however, was only a stroke behind playing the 14th. A bogey there, however, dropped him to two back. Fleck then made birdie on 15 and pars at 16 and 17, after a birdie attempt lipped out. Needing a birdie on 18 to tie Hogan, Fleck played his approach from the edge of the rough to , then knocked in the putt for a 67 and forced an 18-hole playoff on Sunday.\nPlayoff.\n\"Sunday, June 19, 1955\"\nDespite overwhelming odds against him, Fleck held a two-stroke lead over Hogan at the turn. After a third consecutive birdie at 10, Fleck's lead was three. But after a bogey at 17, the lead had dropped to just a single stroke on the 18th tee. Hogan hooked his drive into the very deep rough and took three strokes to get on the fairway: he made a putt to save double-bogey, but Fleck's regulation par sealed the upset by three strokes, 69 to 72."

On the Lower Course, Ed Furgol won his only major title, one stroke ahead of runner-up Gene Littler.\nLittler owned the 36-hole lead by two strokes over defending champion Ben Hogan and Furgol. After a 76 in the third round, Littler fell three strokes back of Furgol, who shot a 71 to take a one-stroke lead over Dick Mayer. Hogan made four bogeys at the first six holes and fell out of contention with a 76.\nIn the final round on Saturday afternoon, Littler rebounded with a 70, but it was not enough. Furgol was helped by a great recovery on the 18th. After hitting his drive into the trees, he played his escape shot onto the 18th fairway of Baltusrol's other course. From there he managed to make par, carding a 72 for a 284 total. Mayer was tied with Furgol as he played 18, but he double-bogeyed the hole to fall into third.\nThis U.S. Open was the first to be nationally televised, one hour of the final round, carried by NBC. It was also the first in which ropes were used to control the gallery, and prize money was increased by 20% over the previous year.

Ben Hogan won a record-tying fourth U.S. Open title, six strokes ahead of runner-up Sam Snead.\nOverview.\nAlthough a three-time champion, Hogan was required to participate with the rest of the field in 36-hole qualifying on Tuesday and Wednesday, immediately preceding the championship. The only exemption at the time was for the defending champion, Julius Boros. The field for the qualifier was 300, with one round at Oakmont and another at the Pittsburgh Field Club, host of the PGA Championship in 1937.\nAfter qualifying, Hogan shot a tournament-low 67 (−5) in the first round on Thursday and an even-par 72 on Friday to hold a two-stroke lead over Snead and George Fazio. Snead's third-round 72 on Saturday morning left him just a shot back of Hogan heading into the final round in the afternoon. With nine holes to go in the final round, Snead trailed by just one shot. Hogan made three birdies on Oakmont's back nine, including a birdie putt at 13 on his way to a 71 and a 283 total, six shots clear of Snead, who shot a final round 76. Hogan's first-round 67 and Snead's second-round 69 were the only sub-70 rounds by any players for the entire tournament. Hogan's win at Oakmont was his fourth U.S. Open title, equaling the record of Willie Anderson and Bobby Jones (Jack Nicklaus would win his fourth U.S. Open in 1980). The four wins came in the last five U.S. Opens in which Hogan had entered; he missed the 1949 edition following his near-fatal automobile accident.\nTwo future champions made their U.S. Open debuts in 1953 as amateurs: Arnold Palmer, 23, of nearby Latrobe and Ken Venturi, 22, of San Francisco. Both missed the cut; Venturi (78-76=154) by one stroke, Palmer (84-78=162) by nine.\nHogan in 1953.\nAlready the Masters champion, Hogan followed up his U.S. Open win with another at the British Open at Carnoustie a few weeks later. He became the first to win three professional majors in a single season, a feat matched only by Tiger Woods in 2000. Through 2018, Hogan remains the only golfer in history to win the Masters, U.S. Open, and British Open in the same calendar year. His margins of victory in the 1953 majors were five, six, and four strokes, respectively.\nIn 1953, the final two majors were in conflict on the schedule. The match-play PGA Championship was a seven-day event, held July 1–7 near Detroit; the British Open in Scotland was played July 8–10, with a mandatory 36-hole qualifier on July 6–7.\nCourse layout.\nLengths of the course for previous major championships:\nThe first hole became a par 4 for majors in 1962.\nRound summaries.\nFirst round.\n\"Thursday, June 11, 1953\"\nSource:\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, June 12, 1953\"\nSource:\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, June 13, 1953 (morning)\"\nFinal round.\n\"Saturday, June 13, 1953 (afternoon)\""

Julius Boros captured the first of his three major titles, four strokes ahead of runner-up Ed Oliver.\nTwo-time defending champion Ben Hogan, raised in nearby Fort Worth, attempted to become the second to win three consecutive U.S. Opens, and with two rounds of 69 he had the 36-hole lead, two strokes ahead of George Fazio. But consecutive rounds of 74 in the Saturday heat dropped Hogan back to third place, five strokes behind. Boros carded a third-round 68 to take a two-stroke lead, then shot a 71 for a 281 total and waited in the clubhouse to see if anyone would catch him, but none did. The closest was Oliver with a 72 to finish at 285, four behind Boros. Temperatures reached under sunny skies on Saturday, with a gallery estimated at 15,000.\nHogan was admittedly affected by the heat, and his final round included an out-of-bounds approach shot on the dogleg par-4 sixth hole and numerous three-putts. Boros successfully scrambled during both rounds on Saturday, chipping close and making lengthy putts. Hogan told Boros he was \"a magician.\"\nIt was Boros' first win on the PGA Tour at the age of 32; just three years earlier he reached the quarterfinals of the U.S. Amateur. Boros won 17 more times as a professional, including a second U.S. Open in 1963. Five years later he won the PGA Championship in 1968 at age 48, the oldest ever to win a major championship until surpassed by Phil Mickelson in 2021.\nHogan regained the title in 1953 for four U.S. Open wins in five attempts (he won his first in 1948 and did not enter in 1949 due to a near-fatal automobile accident). Through 2015, Willie Anderson remains the only winner of three consecutive U.S. Opens, with titles in 1903, 1904, and 1905. The only repeat winners since 1951 are Curtis Strange in 1989 and Brooks Koepka in 2018.\nThe PGA Championship in 1952 was played the following week in Louisville, Kentucky. Boros was not eligible as he had been a pro less than five years, but received a special invitation from the PGA of America.

Ben Hogan won his second consecutive U.S. Open title, two strokes ahead of runner-up Clayton Heafner. Hogan missed the 1949 U.S. Open due to an automobile accident; this was his third title in his last three attempts.\nThe South Course, dubbed \"The Monster,\" played exceptionally tough for the first three rounds. No player was able to break par the first two days, and Jimmy Demaret's 70 was the only score to equal par in Saturday morning's third round. Sam Snead owned the first round lead at 71 (+1), while Bobby Locke led after the second round at 144 (+4) and shared the lead with Demaret after the third at 218 (+8).\nTwo strokes back after a 71 in the third round on Saturday morning, Hogan played one of the finest rounds in U.S. Open history that afternoon. Even-par on the front nine, he birdied the 10th and 13th holes. After a bogey at 14, he responded with another birdie at 15. At the 72nd hole, Hogan hit his approach shot on the par-4 to and sank the birdie putt to post a 67 (−3), the lowest round of the week, one of two sub-par rounds for the round (and championship). His 287 (+7) was two ahead of Heafner, who shot 69, the only other round under 70. At the trophy presentation, Hogan uttered the famous quote: \"I'm glad I brought this course—this monster—to its knees.\"\nThis was the first U.S. Open that was notably toughened up by the USGA with narrow fairways and deep rough, attributing to \"The Monster\" nickname. The course also underwent a redesign by Robert Trent Jones prior to the championship, modifying the original Donald Ross design.\nThe South Course previously hosted the U.S. Open in 1924 and 1937; the winning score in 1937 was 281, sixteen strokes less than in 1924.

In what became known as the \"Miracle at Merion,\" 1948 champion Ben Hogan won the second of his four U.S. Open titles in an 18-hole playoff over 1946 champion Lloyd Mangrum and George Fazio, just 16 months after being severely injured in an automobile accident. It was the fourth of Hogan's nine major titles.\nLee Mackey established a new tournament record by shooting a 64 in the first round, but followed that up with an 81 and finished in 25th place. His score of 64 was not bettered in any other major championship for 23 years, until Johnny Miller closed with a 63 at the U.S. Open in 1973 to win at Oakmont. Tommy Armour, three-time major champion and winner in 1927, played in his final major and missed the cut.\nThis was the second U.S. Open played at Merion's East Course, which previously hosted sixteen years earlier in 1934, won by Olin Dutra. Opened in 1912, the course was the site of the U.S. Amateur in 1916, 1924, and 1930; the first was the debut of Bobby Jones at age 14 (quarterfinalist) and the latter two he won. The 1930 victory was the fourth and final leg of his grand slam.\nHogan made his U.S. Open debut at Merion in 1934 at age 21. He shot 79 (+9) twice and missed the 36-hole cut by three strokes.

Hogan had a chance to win the tournament in regulation but missed a short putt for par at 15 and then bogeyed the par-3 17th.

Mangrum's tee shot at 16 went into heavy rough but his third shot stopped from the hole.

Mangrum rolled it in, but was assessed a two-stroke penalty at the next tee; the double-bogey allowed Hogan to cruise to a four-stroke victory.

For Snead, it was the third of four second-place finishes at the only major championship he never won. Middlecoff, a dentist, won his second U.S. Open in 1956.\nMiddlecoff began the championship with a 75, but rebounded with scores of 67-69 in the next two rounds to take a one-shot lead over Buck White after 54 holes. In the final round, Middlecoff was paired with Heafner, and the two exchanged the lead several times during the round.

He had won the Los Angeles Open at the course in early 1947 and 1948. It was the third of Hogan's nine major titles; he had won his second PGA Championship a few weeks earlier. He was only the second to win both titles in the same year, joining Gene Sarazen in 1922. Later winners of both were Jack Nicklaus in 1980 and Tiger Woods in 2000.\nAlthough Sam Snead held the lead by a stroke after 36 holes with a record 138, Hogan dominated the final two rounds, shooting 68-69 on Saturday for a total of 276 (−8), two shots ahead of runner-up Jimmy Demaret. Hogan decimated the U.S. Open scoring record (281 by Ralph Guldahl in 1937) by five strokes, and his three rounds in the 60s was a tournament first. The scoring record stood for 19 years, until bested by a stroke by Jack Nicklaus in 1967. Hogan's 8-under-par set a U.S. Open record that stood until 2000, when it was broken by Tiger Woods (12-under, broken by Rory McIlroy in 2011 at 16-under).\nEight months later, Hogan and his wife were involved in a serious automobile accident, a head-on collision with a Greyhound bus in west Texas. The injuries he sustained prevented a defense of his title in 1949 while he recovered. Hogan returned to competition and won the U.S. Open in 1950, 1951, and 1953.

A significant reason this occurred is because the British Open, which is usually won by international golfers, was cancelled for most of the 1940s due to World War II.\nThe purse was $10,000 with a winner's share of $2,000 and $1,500 for the runner-up. In addition, both playoff participants received a $500 bonus.\nRound summaries.\nFirst round.\n\"Thursday, June 12, 1947\"\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, June 13, 1947\"\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, June 14, 1947 (morning)\"\nFinal round.\n\"Saturday, June 14, 1947\"\nWorsham began the final round with a stroke lead over Snead and Bobby Locke. A front-nine 33 kept him in the lead, but after three bogeys on the back he had to settle for a 71 and a 282 total. Snead overcame two early bogeys with birdies at 5, 6, and 15. After a bogey at 17, Snead needed a birdie on the 72nd hole to tie Worsham and force a playoff the next day. His approach shot left him away, which he rolled in for final-round 70. Locke shot 73 to finish three strokes back, in a tie for third place.\nPlayoff.\n\"Sunday, June 15, 1947\"\nIn the 18-hole playoff on Sunday morning, Snead led Worsham by two strokes with just three holes remaining. Worsham birdied the par-3 16th with a putt and Snead bogeyed 17 after he missed the fairway and overshot the green from the rough. The match was all-even at the tee of the 90th hole, a par-4 of . Both put lengthy drives in the fairway, and Snead's approach shot stopped pin-high and left of the hole. Worsham was long and lay feet past the cup on the apron of the green. His downhill chip hit the hole without dropping, and ended up away, leaving Snead his birdie putt for the win. Snead left it well short and as he prepared to hole out in continuation, Worsham called for an official to determine who was further away. With a tape measure, it was determined that it remained Snead's turn, who was visibly flustered with the unnecessary interruption and delay. Snead missed the putt. Worsham then rolled in his par-saving putt for a 69 and the title, which averted an additional 18-hole playoff in the afternoon."

        "text": "The 1946 U.S. Open was the 46th U.S. Open, held June 12–16 at Canterbury Golf Club in Beachwood, Ohio, a suburb east of Cleveland. In the first U.S. Open since 1941, Lloyd Mangrum, a World War II veteran and recipient of two Purple Hearts, defeated Byron Nelson and Vic Ghezzi in 36 playoff holes to win his only major title.\nNelson's caddie possibly cost Nelson the championship in the third round when he accidentally kicked Nelson's ball; Nelson was assessed a one stroke penalty. Two months after the championship, Nelson announced his retirement from the tour at age 34, though he continued to play at the Masters through 1966. He also played twice again at the U.S. Open (1949 and 1955), and once at the British Open in 1955.\nThe purse was $8,000 with a winner's share of $1,500. The three participants received a playoff bonus of $333 each.\nThis was the last playoff at the U.S. Open that ended in a tie without sudden-death. The next dozen 18-hole full round playoffs determined a winner without the need for extra holes. The first time sudden-death was used for the 91st hole was in 1990, Hale Irwin's third title. It was needed again in 1994 and 2008.\nThis was the second U.S. Open at Canterbury in six years; the 1940 edition was won by Lawson Little. It later hosted the PGA Championship in 1973, won by Jack Nicklaus.\nRound summaries.\nFirst round.\n\"Thursday, June 13, 1946\"\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, June 14, 1946\"\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, June 15, 1946 (morning)\"\nFinal round.\n\"Saturday, June 15, 1946 (afternoon)\"\nNelson began the final round with a one-stroke lead over Mangrum and Ghezzi. Ghezzi was the first to finish and carded a 72 and a 284 total. Nelson and Mangrum were playing together, and Nelson had a two-stroke advantage with three holes remaining. But after bogeys at his final two holes, combined with two pars by Mangrum, Nelson fell back into a tie and forced a three-way playoff.\nPlayoff.\n\"Sunday, June 16, 1946\"\nAll three players shot even-par 72 during the first 18 holes on Sunday morning, which forced another 18-hole playoff in the afternoon, as there was no sudden-death playoff at the time. At the 9th, Mangrum nearly shot himself out of contention with an out of bounds tee shot, but a putt for bogey allowed him to minimize the damage. Nelson and Ghezzi were tied at the turn, with Mangrum two back. But Mangrum then collected two birdies, while Nelson bogeyed 13 and Ghezzi recorded bogeys at 14 and 15. Mangrum took a two-stroke lead with a birdie at 16, and despite a bogey-bogey finish, his 72 was good enough to hold off Nelson and Ghezzi by a stroke.\nScorecards.\n\"Morning round\"\n\"Afternoon round\"\n\"Cumulative playoff scores, relative to par\""

It borders the neighborhoods of Roundhill on the north, Washington Park on the east, Loudon-Melrose and Harrison on the south and Fairland and Villa Heights on the west. Its northern and eastern boundary is concurrent with Interstate 581 and its southern boundary is concurrent with U.S. Route 460 (Melrose Avenue).\nHistory.\nMelrose–Rugby developed between 1889 and 1920, as various land companies subdivided and developed the land within the neighborhood. The primary impetus for the development of the neighborhood was the expansion of the streetcar into Melrose by 1890. The neighborhood is characterized with American Foursquare and cottage style home towards the south and more modern split-level ranch home towards the northwest.\nThe Roanoke based Woman's Civic Betterment Club was instrumental in cleaning and improving this area in 1907-1912. In preparing the Melrose-Rugby Historic District in Roanoke, the effects of the Woman's Civic Betterment Club were appreciated.\nToday Melrose–Rugby is the location of the Roanoke Academy for Math and Science, Eureka Park Recreation Center and the J. F. Kennedy Park. The Melrose–Rugby Neighborhood Forum serves as the communities citizen advocacy group.\nThe Melrose–Rugby Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012."
