        "text": "Wade Allen Davis (born September 7, 1985) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Tampa Bay Rays, Kansas City Royals, Chicago Cubs, and Colorado Rockies. Davis is a three-time MLB All-Star. He was a member of the Royals' 2015 World Series-winning team, and earned the Babe Ruth Award for his performance in the 2015 MLB playoffs.\nEarly life.\nBorn and raised in the small town of Lake Wales, Florida, Davis attended Lake Wales High School. After high school, Davis originally committed to attend the University of Florida, but later turned down the offer to play professional baseball.\nProfessional career.\nTampa Bay Rays.\nDraft and minors.\nThe Tampa Bay Devil Rays selected Davis in the third round, with the 75th overall selection, of the 2004 MLB draft. In the minors, he sported a 93–94 mph fastball, and a spike curveball. Davis has expanded his repertoire to include a two-seam fastball, a slider, and a changeup.\n2009.\nDavis made his major league debut on September 6, 2009, against the Detroit Tigers. He earned a no-decision after pitching seven innings, allowing one run, with nine strikeouts.\n2010.\nDavis was the July 2010 AL Rookie Pitcher of the Month, after posting a 4–0 record with a 3.03 ERA in five starts.\nHe was named a starting pitcher on \"Baseball America\"'s 2010 All-Rookie Team. The Tampa Bay chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America also named Davis the Most Outstanding Rookie of the Tampa Bay Rays for the 2010 season. He came in 4th in the voting for 2010 AL Rookie of the Year.\n2011–2012.\nAfter two years in the Rays' starting rotation, Davis spent 2012 coming out of the Rays' bullpen and had a strong season.\nKansas City Royals.\nOn December 9, 2012, Davis was traded to the Kansas City Royals (along with James Shields and Elliot Johnson) in exchange for Wil Myers, Jake Odorizzi, Mike Montgomery and Patrick Leonard.\n2013.\nDavis spent most of 2013 in the Royals' rotation and compiled a 6–10 record through the end of August. He moved to the bullpen for September 2013 and remained in the bullpen through 2014.\n2014.\nIn 2014, Davis posted one of the most dominant seasons ever by a reliever. From June 25 to September 16, Davis did not give up an earned run. On September 15, his ERA was an astonishing 0.69. On September 22, 2014, Davis struck out Yan Gomes for his 104th strikeout of the season, breaking the Royals record for most strikeouts by a relief pitcher, which was 103 and had been shared by Jim York (1971) and Greg Holland (2013). Davis finished the regular season with a 9–2 record, posting a 1.00 ERA. He struck out 109 batters and walked 23. He did not give up a home run in 2014. This dominance continued through the postseason, with Davis posting a 2–0 record and an ERA of 0.63. He struck out 20 batters and walked only 2.\n2015.\nIn 2015, Davis continued his dominance in the bullpen, pitching almost exclusively in the 8th inning, much like 2014. On June 28, Davis' homerless streak almost ended, giving up a double off the top of the wall at O.co Coliseum to Marcus Semien. On August 1, Davis' homerless streak ended at 125.2 innings, giving up a home run to the Blue Jays' José Bautista. His streak was the second longest in Royals history, and the longest such streak by a reliever. On September 22, Davis was selected by manager Ned Yost as the Royals' new closer, as the Royals announced that Greg Holland was done for the year and possibly all of 2016 due to pending Tommy John surgery. On October 23, Davis forced Blue Jays slugger and 2015 American League MVP candidate Josh Donaldson to ground out to Mike Moustakas at third base, which was the final out to secure the Royals' second consecutive American League Championship Series title. Davis later recorded the final three outs of the 2015 World Series, as the Royals defeated the New York Mets in five games.\nIn the 2015 MLB postseason, Davis went 1-0 and earned four saves in four opportunities. He struck out 18 batters while allowing no earned runs over innings pitched. This performance earned him the 2015 Babe Ruth Award, recognizing Davis as the most valuable player in the MLB postseason.\n2016.\nOn July 5, Davis was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to a right forearm strain. On November 4, 2016, the Royals picked up Davis's option for the 2017 season.\nChicago Cubs.\nOn December 7, 2016, the Royals traded Davis to the Chicago Cubs for Jorge Soler. Davis was selected as the only Cub representative to the 2017 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. He gave up a game-winning tenth inning home run to Robinson Canó.\nOn August 29, 2017, Davis set the Chicago Cubs franchise record with his 27th consecutive save.\nIn Game 5 of the 2017 National League Division Series, he tied a Division Series record with 3 saves which tied Aroldis Chapman. But he tied a record by getting one in each of his 3 opportunities; matching Dennis Eckersley's feat in the 1996 National League Division Series.\nColorado Rockies.\nDavis signed a three-year, $52 million contract with the Colorado Rockies on December 29, 2017.\n2018.\nIn his first season in Colorado, Davis led the NL in saves with 43. He ended the season with a 4.13 ERA, his highest ERA since 2013. He struck out 78 batters in innings.\n2019.\nHe was placed on the disabled list on May 22, 2019, with a left oblique injury. He was removed from the closer role on August 2. At the end of the season, Davis put out the worst season of his career, posting a 8.65 ERA in 50 games. In innings, he struck out 42 batters while inducing 29 walks.\nOn December 21, 2019, he was named as one of the two closers for All-Decade second team of 2010's with Kenley Jansen.\n2020.\nDavis began the shortened season as the Rockies closer but after blowing saves within a week he was removed from the role. On September 19, 2020, Davis was designated for assignment by the Rockies. He had allowed 10 runs in under 5 innings. Davis was released by the Rockies on September 21.\nKansas City Royals (second stint).\nOn January 20, 2021, Davis signed a minor league contract with the Kansas City Royals organization. On March 28, 2021, Davis was selected to the 40-man roster.\nDavis pitched in 40 games for the Royals in 2021, going 0–3 with a 6.75 ERA and 38 strikeouts. He became a free agent following the season.\nOn November 24, 2021, Davis announced his retirement.\nPitch selection.\nAs a starter, Davis threw five pitches (four-seam fastball, cut fastball, curveball, slider and changeup). As a relief pitcher, he has relied primarily on three pitches: a four-seam fastball in the 95–98 MPH range (topping out at 99 MPH), a cut fastball that averages 92–93 MPH, and a knuckle curve in the mid-80s that he started throwing in 2013.\nPersonal life.\nDavis is the second-cousin of former Major League Baseball player Jody Davis.\nWade Davis married long-time girlfriend, Katelyn Casey, in November 2009 in her hometown of Marlboro, New York. The couple has two children and three dogs.\nThe couple run a non-profit organization called \"Full Kount\", which benefits children age 18 and younger who use sports as a positive influence in their lives."

        "title": "1982 U.S. Open (golf)",
        "text": "The 1982 U.S. Open was the 82nd U.S. Open, held June 17–20 at Pebble Beach Golf Links in Pebble Beach, California. Tom Watson won his only U.S. Open, two strokes ahead of runner-up Jack Nicklaus, for the sixth of his eight major titles.\nWatson also won the British Open a month later, to become the fifth player to win both Opens in the same year, joining Bobby Jones (1926, 1930), Gene Sarazen (1932), Ben Hogan (1953), and Lee Trevino (1971). It was later accomplished by Tiger Woods in 2000, the first half of his Tiger Slam; all six are Americans.\nThis was third major played at the Pebble Beach Golf Links; Nicklaus won the U.S. Open in 1972 and Lanny Wadkins won the PGA Championship in 1977.\nThe total purse was $375,000, with a winner's share of $60,000.\nCourse layout.\nPebble Beach Golf Links\nRound summaries.\nFirst round.\n\"Thursday, June 17, 1982\"&lt;br&gt;\nWinner of five professional majors, Watson entered the 1982 U.S. Open as one of the favorites and as the number one golfer in the world. A steady performer, he had six top-10 finishes in his previous eight U.S. Opens, but had never finished closer than three strokes from the leader.\nWatson did not get off to a fast start and his even-par 72 opening round was nearly much worse; he was +3 through 14 holes when he began to catch fire, scoring three birdies on the final four holes. On a tough scoring day at Pebble Beach, the 72 put him just two back of first round leaders Bruce Devlin and Bill Rogers. Rogers was the defending British Open champion and was coming off the best year of his career. Jack Nicklaus opened with a disappointing 74. Nicklaus, though in the declining phase of his career, was considered a strong contender as well: he was a winner (at the time) of 17 professional majors including both the 1980 U.S. Open (where Watson had his best previous U.S. Open finish, third place) and the 1972 U.S. Open (the last U.S. Open held at Pebble Beach). Nicklaus had also finished one shot off the pace at the 1977 PGA Championship, the last professional major held at Pebble, a course he considered perhaps his favorite in the world.\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, June 18, 1982\"&lt;br&gt;\nIn the second round, Devlin surged into the lead with a brilliant 3-under 69. Devlin too was in the declining phase of his career, but had 17 wins worldwide by that time, and had 15 top tens in majors to his credit. His last major top 10, however, had been in 1973, and at 44 years of age, a win would have made him (at that time) the oldest winner of the U.S. Open. Larry Rinker also surged into contention with a blistering 5-under 67, putting him two back of Devlin. Rogers lost a little ground with a second round 73.\nWatson, meanwhile, was grinding. As he later said of his second round, \"I shot a 77 and scored a 72.\" A master of the short game, Watson made several saves from the thick U.S. Open rough thanks to his skill chipping and putting. He saved bogey twice from greater than , and birdied the difficult 17th and 18th for the second straight round.\nAmateurs: \"Crosby (+6), Pavin (+7)\", Marlowe (+8), Faxon (+9), Wilson (+9), Nelson (+11), Wood (+12), Fogt (+13), Fuhrer (+13), Perry (+13), Player (+16), Bill (+17), Crowl (+18), Bliss (+22), Dupre (+22).\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, June 19, 1982\"&lt;br&gt;\nWatson's Open turned around for him on the weekend, which he attributed to minor swing adjustments before the third round. On a day that saw a number of sub-70 rounds (including a 67 by Lanny Wadkins, who won the 1977 PGA Championship also played at Pebble Beach), Watson was the best of the leaders, firing a 4-under 68. The score was enough to give him a share of the third round lead with Bill Rogers, who returned to contention with a 69. Devlin, meanwhile, slipped with a 75 and would not be a factor on Sunday after the first few holes.\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, June 20, 1982\"&lt;br&gt;\nNicklaus, meanwhile, shot a 71 and was 3 shots behind the leaders. Nicklaus had not truly been a factor in the tournament, despite playing (according to him) some of his very best golf. His tee to green game had been excellent, but he was unable to make putts to score birdies. On Sunday, Nicklaus was one-over after the two relatively easy starting holes, and then electrified the tournament crowd with five consecutive birdies at 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.\nThe tournament at that point essentially became a three-way battle between Nicklaus, Rogers, and Watson. Rogers and Watson were paired together three groups behind Nicklaus. Watson missed a short birdie putt at 7, and Rogers played steadily early. Rogers lost the lead with a three-putt bogey at nine and also bogeyed the tenth.\nThe tenth was a pivotal hole for Watson as well. Watson pushed his approach shot badly, nearly sending it over the cliff into Carmel Bay. That the ball remained in play was encouraging, but it was so embedded in thick rough that it was difficult to find - it looked to be all Watson could do to save bogey. With an aggressive hack at it, Watson was able to get the ball to the green, but short of the hole. But as he had been able to do in the second round, he struck another long saving putt into the cup for a par 4. Rogers later said the par save there was \"unbelievable\". After another 20-footer (for birdie) at 11, Watson was two strokes in front of Nicklaus.\nNicklaus regained a tie for the lead with a birdie putt on 15 while Watson bogeyed 12 and had to save par at 13. On the uphill par 5 14th, Watson holed a lengthy birdie putt that both he and his caddie (Bruce Edwards) called the best read Edwards had ever given Watson. Watson had over-hit his short approach shot, leaving the ball in perhaps the worst position on the green - well above the hole. Although in length, the putt required a very delicate touch. It was nearly impossible to stop the ball near the hole except by banging into the back of the cup and falling in - which is what Watson did.\nWatson's next brilliant putt was a miss for par - but he would credit it as one of his most important putts of a tournament won with his putting. His tee shot at 16 landed in a narrow neck of a fairway bunker, requiring Watson to come out sideways. His approach shot landed from the hole. Facing the prospect of a double bogey from that distance, Watson's severely breaking putt was nearly holed and his tap-in saved bogey.\nPebble Beach has two of the great closing holes in golf - a par three of nearly with a devilishly shaped green (17), and a par 5 hugging the cliffs of the Pacific Ocean (18). Watson had played these holes very well during the tournament, and would likely need to do so again to hold off Nicklaus, who was in the clubhouse at 4-under (shooting 69 on Sunday). The closing stretch began disastrously for Watson. His 2 iron at 17 sailed left of the flagstick and tumbled into the gnarly rough behind the green and above the hole. Nicklaus later said that, after seeing the tee shot on TV, he was confident he would at least have a chance at Watson in a playoff.\nWatson knew he had a fairly good lie in the rough, but caddie Bruce Edwards also knew that the shot would be difficult to control and almost impossible to stop near the hole. There was a danger of failing to hit the shot crisply enough, leaving the ball above the hole with a slippery putt to follow, or of missing the hole and leaving a long uphill putt. Either scenario would likely lead to bogey. To remind Watson to, at all costs, give himself a chance to make another par putt, he told Watson, \"Get it close.\" Watson replied, \"Get it close? Hell, I'm going to sink it.\"\nIndeed, he struck the chip and it bounced against the flagstick before dropping in. Watson jubilantly ran after it, pointing at Edwards, enjoying one of the great moments in golf history. His confidence carried over to the final hole, which he also birdied, giving him a hard fought 70 and, at 6-under for the tournament, a two shot win over Nicklaus. It was the 18th runner-up finish at a major in Nicklaus's career (he would finish second again at the 1983 PGA Championship) and turned out to be his last best chance to win his fifth U.S. Open. Although he called it a heartbreaking defeat, Nicklaus was the first to congratulate Watson as he walked off the 18th green.\nAmateurs: Nathaniel Crosby (+15), Corey Pavin (+16)\nScorecard.\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\"&lt;br&gt;"

        "title": "1972 NCAA lacrosse tournament",
        "text": "The 1972 NCAA lacrosse tournament was the second annual tournament hosted by the National Collegiate Athletic Association to determine the team champion of college lacrosse among its members in the United States. \nThis was the last NCAA championship in which the Wingate Memorial Trophy was also presented to the national champion. Prior to NCAA Lacrosse Championships, the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA) awarded the Wingate Memorial Trophy to the NCAA annual champion based on regular season records.\nVirginia, led by coach Glenn Thiel, defeated Johns Hopkins in the championship game, 13–12. The victory gave Virginia its first NCAA championship in lacrosse and its third overall (including USILA titles in 1952 and 1970). The victory also gave Virginia its first official NCAA national title in any sport.\nThe championship game was played at Byrd Stadium at the University of Maryland in front of a crowd of 7,001 fans. \nOverview.\nAs in 1971, teams were first selected from the college lacrosse divisions, and then at-large teams were chosen. Army, Navy, Maryland and Johns Hopkins were selected as \"seeded\" picks. And Virginia, Cortland, Rutgers and Washington &amp; Lee were picked as the at-large teams.\nVirginia had USILA player of the year Pete Eldredge, who finished with four goals in the finals scoring the game winner with four minutes left in the fourth quarter. The Cavaliers had lost to Hopkins, Maryland and Navy during the regular season.\nMaryland, the pre-tournament favorite and host team, fell in the semifinals to Johns Hopkins, 9-6, before 7,000 fans.\nThe Cavaliers survived a late rush by Jack Thomas, who with 12 seconds left in the game appeared to have a clear shot at the net. Bob Scott however had, unknown to the ball players called a timeout, negating what would have been a last-second game-tying attempt. Virginia twice had a three goal lead in this game, only to see Hopkins tie the score. Once UVA took its final lead, they were able to play ball control for the final four minutes of the game, except for the final Hopkins try at the end, aided by 4 Hopkins penalties. Hopkins got the ball back with 41 seconds left for that final rush to goal by Thomas. Hopkins was able to get one final shot off as the gun sounded, but the shot hit a defenseman. UVA held Thomas in relative check with Thomas ending the game with 2 goals and 1 assist.\nThis tournament saw the entry in the tournament of two early innovative lacrosse programs, Cortland State and Washington and Lee. Cortland was notable for going 14-2 that season while knocking off defending champion Cornell, Syracuse and Navy, and earning the number 3 seed in the tournament. Cortland was coached by Jack Emmer who later took Washington and Lee to consecutive NCAAs before moving on to be the longtime coach at Army.\nPaced by veterans Jay Connor, Tom Duquette, Pete Eldredge and Chip Barker as well as freshman Richie Werner, Virginia got the winning goal from Eldredge, unassisted with 4:11 left in the contest. Maryland, the pre-tourney favorite, fell in the semifinals to Johns Hopkins 9–6. Connor, the tourney’s leading scorer, set a meet record for assists. Maryland’s John Kaestner broke the single-game assist mark. Virginia and Johns Hopkins combined to shatter all three of the tournament records for shots on goal.\nIn the first round, Jack Emmer's Cortland team edged Navy 10 to 9 in double overtime, led by Paul Wehrum's 3 goals. Cortland scored three goals in the fourth quarter to erase a 9–6 deficit and won the game despite being outshot by Navy 57–28.\nOutstanding player.\nThe NCAA did not designate a Most Outstanding Player until the 1977 national tournament. The Tournament outstanding player listed here is the tournament leading scorer."

        "text": "Robert William Humphreys (born August 18, 1935) is an American former professional baseball player and executive. A right-hander, Humphreys was a relief pitcher over all or parts of nine Major League Baseball seasons (1962–1970) with the Detroit Tigers, St. Louis Cardinals, Chicago Cubs, Washington Senators and Milwaukee Brewers. Humphreys was a member of the 1964 World Series champion Cardinals.\nAn alumnus of Hampden-Sydney College, Humphreys was born in Covington, Virginia, and graduated from high school in Montvale. He was listed as tall and .\nPlaying career.\nHumphreys' pro pitching career began in the Tigers' organization in 1958 and lasted through 1971. After trials with Detroit (1962) and St. Louis (1963), Humphreys was recalled from the Triple-A Jacksonville Suns in July 1964, and worked in 28 games out of the Redbird bullpen. He won his only two decisions (both coming during the September pennant race) and posted two saves with a 2.53 earned run average as St. Louis overcame the Philadelphia Phillies to win the National League championship. In Game 6 of the 1964 World Series, he worked the ninth inning and retired the New York Yankees in order; it was Humphreys' only post-season appearance. The Cardinals won the Series' deciding seventh game a day later.\nHumphreys was traded to the Cubs just prior to the 1965 campaign. In his only season with Chicago, he appeared in 41 games and again posted a 2–0 record. Then, prior to 1966, he was traded to the Senators, where he played four full years and part of a fifth. In 214 games pitched as a Senator, he compiled a 21–15 record with 14 saves. Released by the Senators, he signed with the Brewers two days later on June 15, 1970.

James was an outfielder over all or parts of six Major League Baseball seasons (1960–65) with the St. Louis Cardinals and Cincinnati Reds, appearing in 510 games. Born in St. Louis, Missouri, he grew up in suburban Rock Hill and graduated from Webster Groves High School. James was also a letterman as a football halfback for the University of Missouri Tigers in 1956 and 1957 before starting his professional baseball career. He later earned a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering at Washington University in St. Louis.\nJames threw and batted right-handed and was listed as tall and . He signed with his hometown Cardinals and began his baseball career in the high minors in 1958, where he collected 104 runs batted in in the Double-A Texas League and made the Triple-A International League's All-Star team in successive seasons.\nThe Cardinals recalled him in August 1960, and he spent the rest of his baseball career in the majors. James platooned in right field with left-handed hitter Joe Cunningham in , then was the Redbirds' most-used right-fielder in , starting 95 games and hitting a career-best .276. In , he shared the left field job with Baseball Hall of Famer Stan Musial in Musial's last season in the game. He began as the Cardinals' regular left fielder, but after he had started 40 games, St. Louis acquired future Hall of Famer Lou Brock from the Chicago Cubs on June 15, and Brock took command of the position, hitting .348 and leading the Cardinals into the 1964 World Series. James spent the rest of the season as an occasional right fielder and frequent pinch hitter, and his batting average fell to .223.

He appeared in only 26 games and collected only eight hits in 39 at bats. Although he went to spring training with the Reds, he did not make the early-season 28-man roster, and retired rather than report to Triple-A.\nIn his 510 MLB games, James batted .255 with 358 hits, 56 doubles, nine triples, 29 home runs, and 172 runs batted in. With his degree in electrical engineering, he built a successful business career as the president of a Missouri-based manufacturing company, retiring in 1998."

        "text": "Steven Wayne Pearce (born April 13, 1983) is an American former professional baseball left fielder and first baseman. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Pittsburgh Pirates, Baltimore Orioles, Houston Astros, New York Yankees, Tampa Bay Rays, Toronto Blue Jays and Boston Red Sox. Pearce is only the second player in MLB history to have played for every team in the American League East, the first being Kelly Johnson. He is also the first and only player to have hit two walk-off grand slams in the span of a single week.\nPearce was instrumental in Boston's 2018 World Series triumph over the Los Angeles Dodgers, displaying key outbursts of power en route to being named the World Series Most Valuable Player.\nAmateur career.\nPearce graduated in 2001 from Lakeland High School in Lakeland, Florida, where he was a three-year letterman in baseball and posted a career .383 batting average. Pearce's father, also named Steve, was born in Rehoboth, Massachusetts, south of Boston. As a result, Pearce became a fan of the Boston Red Sox growing up, a team he would eventually play for. “I was brainwashed as a kid. Had no choice.”\nPearce played two seasons (2002–2003) at Indian River Community College in Fort Pierce, Florida, leading Indian River in batting average both seasons and hitting a total of 17 home runs. Pearce was inducted to the Indian River Pioneer Athletic Hall of Fame on April 16, 2015.\nPearce was selected twice in the MLB draft, but did not sign; in the 45th round in the 2003 MLB draft by the Minnesota Twins, and in the 10th round in the 2004 MLB draft by the Boston Red Sox.\nPearce played for the Cotuit Kettleers of the Cape Cod Baseball League in the summer of 2004, hitting .277 with one home run and seven RBIs in 24 games.\nPearce transferred to the University of South Carolina and led the team in batting average, home runs and RBIs in 2004 and 2005, hitting 42 home runs in his two seasons with the Gamecocks, to become the first player in school history to reach the 40-homer plateau that quickly. As a transfer junior in 2004, he hit .346 with 21 home runs and 70 RBI, helping to lead the Gamecocks to their third consecutive appearance in the College World Series. Pearce was named the team's Rookie of the Year and was selected to both the NCAA Regional All-Tournament Team and the College World Series All-Tournament Team. He set a South Carolina school record with a 1.000 fielding percentage (416 putouts, 22 assists, 0 errors) in 50 games at first base. Pearce was named to the watch lists for both the Golden Spikes Award (USA Baseball's top amateur baseball player) and the Dick Howser Trophy (top collegiate baseball player) prior to the 2005 season. As a senior in 2005, he hit .358 with 21 home runs and 63 RBIs, and was a Second-Team All-SEC selection, a \"Baseball America\" Second-Team All-American and the NCBWA District IV Player of the Year.\nProfessional career.\nPittsburgh Pirates.\nThe Pittsburgh Pirates selected Pearce in the eighth round of the 2005 MLB draft.\nIn 2005, Pearce played for the Class A Short Season Williamsport Crosscutters, batting .301 with seven home runs and 52 RBIs in 72 games.\nIn 2006, he then spent with the Class A Hickory Crawdads and the Class A-Advanced Lynchburg Hillcats, batting a combined .273 with 26 home runs and 98 RBIs in 131 games played.\nIn 2007, he began the season with Lynchburg, then move on to the Double-A Altoona Curve, and the Triple-A Indianapolis Indians. During his 2007 run in the minors, Pearce had 31 home runs, 113 RBIs, and a .333 average in 134 games played. On September 1, 2007, he made his MLB debut for the Pirates, against the Milwaukee Brewers, starting in right field and going 2-for-4 at the plate where both of his hits were off Dave Bush. He would go on to play 23 games with the 2007 Pirates, batting .294 with six RBIs.\nIn 2008, Pearce spent the majority of the year with Triple-A Indianapolis, but made several appearances for the Pirates. On September 2, he was recalled again when the roster expanded. With the 2008 Pirates, Pearce batted .248 with four home runs and 15 RBIs in 37 games played.\nIn 2009, Pearce failed to make the Pirates opening day roster after spring training, and began the year in Triple-A. With the recent addition of outfield prospects in the organization, Pearce was moved back to playing first base. He was recalled on June 20. Pearce joined the Pirates on July 23 to become the starting first baseman following the trade of Adam LaRoche. He ended a poor season for the 2009 Pirates with a slash line of .206/.296/.370 in 60 games played, with four home runs and 16 RBIs.

Pearce continued his hot streak the following night hitting his third home run of the year in the Orioles 4–3 victory over the Houston Astros. He and teammate Adam Jones were named co-AL Players of the Week for the week ending on July 6. Pearce had an extremely successful 2014 season, setting career-highs in home runs (21), RBIs (49), runs scored (51), batting average (.293), and doubles (26).\nPearce received a significant upgrade in salary for the 2015 season; settling on a salary of $3.7 million with the Orioles, well above the $700,000 he had made the previous season.

In 60 games, he hit .309 with 10 home runs.\nThird stint with the Orioles.\nOn August 1, 2016, the Rays traded Pearce to the Orioles for Jonah Heim. With the 2016 Orioles, Pearce appeared in 25 games, batting 13-for-60 (.217) with three home runs and six RBIs.\nToronto Blue Jays.\nOn December 5, 2016, Pearce signed a two-year, $12.5 million contract with the Toronto Blue Jays.

He returned to the lineup on June 16 and hit a home run against the Chicago White Sox. Pearce hit the third walk-off grand slam in franchise history on July 27, lifting the Blue Jays to an 8–4 victory and a four-game sweep of the Oakland Athletics. Three days later, he hit another walk-off grand slam, giving the Blue Jays an 11–10 win over the Los Angeles Angels. In doing so, Pearce became the 29th player in MLB history to hit an ultimate grand slam, and the third player to hit two walk-off grand slams in a season, joining Cy Williams and Jim Presley, who did so in 1926 and 1986 respectively. Pearce also became the first player in MLB history to hit multiple walk-off grand slams within the span of a single week.

On August 2, in a game against the Yankees, Pearce hit three home runs and led the Red Sox in a 15–7 rout at Fenway Park. He became just the sixth player to hit three home runs in a Red Sox–Yankees game. After the game, Pearce was called the best acquisition the Red Sox made during the 2018 season. During the regular season, Pearce batted .279 for the Red Sox, with seven home runs and 26 RBIs in 50 games played.\nAfter an injury to regular first baseman Mitch Moreland in Game 2 of the American League Division Series, Pearce became the everyday first baseman for the Red Sox in the playoffs.

In the next inning, Pearce came up with the bases loaded and hit a base–clearing double, putting the Red Sox up 8–4 in a game they would go on to win 9–6. In Game 5, Pearce hit a two-run home run in the first inning off of former Cy Young Award winner Clayton Kershaw, and added a second home run in the eighth inning off Pedro Báez to extend the lead to 5–1. The Red Sox would go on to win the game and the series, giving Pearce his first World Series ring. He became the first Red Sox player to hit three home runs in the World Series since Carl Yastrzemski in 1967, and in three fewer games. He joined Babe Ruth and Ted Kluszewski as the only players 35 or older to have a multi-home run game in the World Series.

He was sent on a rehabilitation assignment with the Lowell Spinners on June 14, and with the Pawtucket Red Sox on June 18. His rehabilitation assignment was stopped by the team on July 1, for what was later described as a posterior ligament injury to his knee. Pearce was moved to the 60-day injured list on August 11, and did not play again during the season, finishing with one home run and nine RBIs in the 29 games he appeared in. He became a free agent on October 31.\nPearce announced his retirement on April 13, 2020.\nPersonal life.\nPearce and his wife, Jessica, have a son and a daughter together.\nExternal links.\n, or Retrosheet"

Reed was a member of the 1961 and 1962 World Series champion Yankees, although he did not appear in the latter series. An alumnus of the University of Mississippi, Reed's primary role for the Yanks was as a late-inning defensive replacement for injury-riddled star outfielder Mickey Mantle. For this reason, he was popularly known as Mantle's \"caddie.\"\nReed threw and batted right-handed; he was listed as tall and . He spent his entire professional career in the Yankee organization as a player (1953–1955; 1958–1964) and minor league manager (1965–1967). During his Major League career, Reed hit .233 with one home run and six runs batted in in 222 games played (and 129 at-bats). He was only one of seven players in Major League Baseball history with more career games played than plate appearances. He appeared in three games of the 1961 World Series against the Cincinnati Reds (won by the Yankees in five games) as a defensive replacement, spelling Mantle, Héctor López and Johnny Blanchard; he did not have a plate appearance.\nOn June 24, 1962, Reed hit the only home run of his career in the top of the 22nd inning, as the Yankees beat the Detroit Tigers 9–7 in the longest game in Yankees' history. The blow came off Phil Regan at Tiger Stadium. Reed's 30 MLB hits also included two doubles and one triple.\nReed died on November 10, 2022."

        "text": "The Salford Triathlon was an international-level triathlon event held annually from 2000 to 2007 in the city of Salford in north west England. It was the only United Kingdom leg of the International Triathlon Union's Triathlon World Cup during this time.\nHistory.\nWith the sport of triathlon becoming increasingly popular, in 2000 Greater Manchester’s councils created a role for a Triathlon Development Officer who would encourage the sport at a grass roots level in schools and the community. The interest was incredible and it was from here that the Millennium Waterfronts Triathlon was born.\nThe MWT combined the north west regional championships and national championships for under 21s - with 500 people competing for the titles, including Richard Allen, Richard Stannard, and Jodie Swallow.\nThe success of that first event was proved when Salford won the right to hold the National Triathlon Championships in 2001 - attracting 1000 competitors from all over the world, including a host of big names for the elite races, like Simon Whitfield and Leanda Cave.\nIt was the first time the nationals had come to the North of the country - John Lunt, Race Director, said at the time:\n\"This has been the best course in the country for competitors. Having a closed city centre course is very rare and lets athletes go right into the heart of Manchester - creating a fantastic atmosphere between them and the spectators.\"\nThose national championships also proved to be an important rehearsal for the Triathlon events at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester - which ran over the now tried and tested course. Over 100,000 spectators lined the route to view one of the few free Games events and the atmosphere they created was amazing as Simon Whitfield and Carol Montgomery raced to gold!\nWorld Cup.\nA legacy of the Commonwealth Games event was the awarding of a leg of the 2003 World Cup to Salford. Further successful events in the following years allowed promoters Salford City Council and event operator Human Race to bid to host the 2010 ITU Triathlon World Championships. The bid however was unsuccessful.\nThe event was not held in 2008 because of its proximity to the Olympic Games, the absence of BBC Sport coverage, and major building work (part of MediaCityUK) close to the area usually used for transition.\nThe future.\nThe Salford Triathlon has been set a provisional return date of 26 July 2009. With the Olympic Games due to be held in London in 2012, it is possible the World Cup may not return to Salford since as part of London's preparation it must hold an international-level test event on the Olympic course at least once in the years prior to the Games. Whilst possible, it is unlikely the ITU would hold more than one World Cup event in the United Kingdom in any one year.\nPrevious World Cup winners.\nThis table lists the previous winners of the World Cup events held in Salford from 2003 to 2007."

        "text": "The Nebraska Cornhuskers women's volleyball team competes as part of NCAA Division I, representing the University of Nebraska–Lincoln in the Big Ten. Nebraska plays its home games at the Bob Devaney Sports Center and has sold out every home match since 2001. The team has been coached by John Cook since 2000.\nThe program was founded in 1975 and is one of the most decorated in women's volleyball, with more wins than any other program and five national championships. Nebraska has been ranked in every weekly poll since the introduction of the AVCA National Poll in 1982 and has spent more weeks ranked number one than any other program. The Cornhuskers' ninety-nine All-Americans are the most in the country. Nebraska regularly leads the NCAA in average attendance and has participated in several of the highest-attended women's volleyball games ever played. On August 30, 2023, Nebraska and Omaha played at Memorial Stadium in front of 92,003 people, the highest-attended women's sporting event in the United States.\nHistory.\nPat Sullivan (1974–76).\nUntil the 1972 passing of Title IX, Nebraska's volleyball program existed for four years as an \"extramural\" sport operating as a part of the school's physical education department. Pat Sullivan was hired in 1974, and she led the program's first season of varsity competition. Though the school offered its first scholarships for female student-athletes to members of this team, which went 25–10–1 and placed sixth in the AIAW's Region VI tournament, the university recognizes 1975 as its inaugural season due to \"a lack of records [from 1974] and tradition.\" Sullivan compiled an 83–21 record over two official seasons, including an AIAW regional final appearance in 1975 and NU's first Big Eight championship in 1976. Sullivan would later go on to coach volleyball at George Washington University for nine seasons, as well as be a professor there.\nTerry Pettit (1977–99).\nTerry Pettit was hired as Nebraska's second head coach in 1977. Pettit, an Indiana native, was an English teacher and volleyball coach at Louisburg College in North Carolina when a fellow coach found out about Nebraska's open job and directed Pettit to apply. From 1977 to 1999, he led the Cornhuskers to a record of 694–148, winning twenty-one conference championships and the 1995 national championship.\nIn his twenty-three years as head coach, Pettit built the program into a national power. Under his guidance, Nebraska appeared in nineteen consecutive NCAA tournaments, including six national semifinals, two national runner-up finishes, and NU's first national title. Pettit's teams won a conference championship in all but two seasons during his tenure. His list of honors includes induction into the AVCA Hall of Fame in 2009, USA Volleyball All-Time Great Coach Award, and several national and regional coach of the year awards from various publications. Under Pettit, Nebraska became one of the first schools to offer scholarships to female athletes. In 1978, Terri Kanouse and Shandi Pettine were the first players to receive full scholarships for volleyball, and just three years later, the university allowed Pettit to offer up to twelve scholarships. Pettit coached thirty-six AVCA All-Americans at Nebraska, the highest number of any school in that time span.\nPettit's only national championship as a head coach came in 1995. After dropping an early-season match to Stanford, NU swept twenty-two consecutive opponents and won thirty-one straight matches. Nebraska defeated Texas 3–1 to win the title, and AVCA National Player of the Year Allison Weston was among three Huskers named first-team All-Americans. Before the 1999 season, Pettit hired former assistant John Cook as associate head coach. Following Nebraska's loss in the national semifinals, Pettit retired and Cook became head coach. In 2020, Pettit was inducted into the Nebraska Athletics Hall of Fame.\nJohn Cook (2000–present).\nCook succeeded the retiring Pettit before the 2000 season after a seven-year stint as head coach at Wisconsin. He was Pettit's assistant coach from 1989 to 1991. In twenty years at Nebraska, Cook has guided the Huskers to four national championships, five other national semifinal appearances and an NCAA tournament berth in each season. Cook was named National Coach of the Year in 2000 and 2005, Central Region Coach of the Year four times, and conference coach of the year six times. He was awarded the USA Volleyball All-Time Great Coach Award in 2008, and was inducted into the AVCA Hall of Fame in 2017. Under Cook, Greichaly Cepero, Christina Houghtelling, and Sarah Pavan won AVCA National Player of the Year, and Pavan won the Honda-Broderick Cup in 2007 as the Collegiate Female Athlete of the Year.\nIn his first year as NU's head coach, Cook guided the Huskers to their second national championship. After starting the season outside the national top ten, Nebraska went 20–0 in Big 12 play and defeated Cook's former team, Wisconsin, in a five-set national title match to cap a 34–0 season and become the second undefeated team in NCAA volleyball history. Sophomore setter Greichaly Cepero was named National Player of the Year and won the Honda Sports Award as the best female athlete in collegiate sports. Nebraska finished the 2001 and 2002 seasons 20–0 in conference play, but lost late in the tournament to Stanford and Hawaii, ending both seasons 31–2. Nebraska's seventy-seven game Big 12 winning streak ended with a loss at Kansas State in 2003 as the Cornhuskers failed to make it out of a regional.\nNebraska earned the number one overall seed in the 2004 NCAA tournament, which began an NCAA-record eighty-eight consecutive weeks the Cornhuskers were ranked atop the AVCA weekly poll. The Huskers fell to two-time defending champion USC but freshman Sarah Pavan was named AVCA National Freshman of the Year. Pavan became one of the most decorated players in volleyball history, including four First-Team All-American honors and the 2006 National Player of the Year award. Nebraska was again the top seed in the 2005 NCAA Tournament and swept through the first five rounds, but was upset by Washington in the national title match.\nNebraska lost only once in the 2006 regular season as its streak at the top of the rankings continued. The Cornhuskers were the top seed in the NCAA Tournament for the third consecutive year and returned to the national title match after a five-set win over Minnesota. Nebraska dropped the first set to Stanford but won the next three to win the school's third championship in front of a then-NCAA volleyball-record crowd of 17,209. Nebraska swept twenty-four of its thirty-three opponents and lost just fourteen sets all season and became the first team to win the championship while hosting the finals since UCLA in 1991. Pavan won numerous awards after the season and sophomore Jordan Larson was named a first-team All American.\nNebraska's season opener in 2007 marked the program's 1,000th game, a sweep of Tennessee in the AVCA Showcase. The Cornhuskers' eighty-eight week streak at number one came to an end in October, but NU won its fourth straight Big 12 title. After surviving an upset bid by unseeded Michigan State in the NCAA Tournament, Nebraska fell to California in the regional final. Pavan joined Texas softball pitcher Cat Osterman as the only repeat Big 12 Female Athlete of the Year and Nebraska placed a then-record five players on All-America teams. Nebraska won its fifth consecutive Big 12 title in 2008 and advanced through the first three rounds of the NCAA Tournament to face Washington. After losing the first two sets, Nebraska came back to tie the match, and used a nine-point run to win set five. Nebraska met undefeated Penn State in the national semifinal and again fell behind 2–0. The Huskers rallied to deal the Nittany Lions their first two set losses of the season, snapping their NCAA-record 111 consecutive set wins, but lost the match in five sets.\nNebraska's NCAA-record ninety-game home winning streak came to an end at the beginning of the 2009 season. In the 2009 NCAA Tournament Texas became the first team to beat NU three times in one season after ending the Huskers' five-year stretch atop the Big 12. In 2010, the University of Nebraska announced it would be ending its fifteen-year relationship with the Big 12 and joining the Big Ten. The Cornhuskers won the Big 12 in 2010, departing with an all-time conference record of 278–22.\nMove to the Big Ten\nThe University of Nebraska joined the Big Ten Conference in 2011. This meant for the first time NU would regularly play longtime rival Penn State along with other nationally relevant programs including Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Illinois. The Huskers won the Big Ten in their first year of competition but failed to make a regional semifinal for the first time since 1993. Nebraska did not win another Big Ten title until 2016 and failed to make the national semifinals in six straight seasons, the longest stretch for the program in over thirty years. Nebraska's drought ended in 2015 when the Cornhuskers swept former Big 12 rival Texas to win the program's fourth national championship in front of an NCAA-record crowd in Omaha. Mikaela Foecke had nineteen kills in the title game and became the third freshman named the NCAA tournament's Most Outstanding Player. The Cornhuskers spent much of the following season ranked number one in the country and won the program's first conference title since 2011. In the 2016 NCAA Tournament, Nebraska fought off two match points to defeat Penn State in the regional semifinals but fell to Texas in the national semifinals.\nNebraska's 2017 season opened with consecutive losses to Florida and Oregon, but the Cornhuskers finished the regular season with just two more losses, ultimately sharing the Big Ten title with Penn State. NU defeated the top-seeded Nittany Lions in five sets to advance to the national title match, defeating Florida 3–1 to win the school's fifth national title in front of a then-record crowd of 18,516. Outside hitter Mikaela Foecke was again named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player, making her one of four players to win the honor more than once. NU made a program-record fourth straight trip to the national semifinals in 2018 but fell to Stanford in a five-set national title match.\nAfter a pair of regional final losses in 2019 and 2020 (though the 2020 Tournament was held in the spring of 2021), NU defeated No. 2 Texas and No. 3 Pittsburgh in the 2021 Tournament to reach the school's tenth national title match; Nebraska's five-set loss to Wisconsin set a new NCAA volleyball attendance record. Following the season, freshman libero Lexi Rodriguez became the second Cornhusker and first libero to win AVCA National Freshman of the Year.\nOn August 30, 2023, Nebraska hosted \"Volleyball Day in Nebraska\" at Memorial Stadium, with a temporary court on the football playing field. The event featured an exhibition between two of the state's three Division II schools, Nebraska–Kearney and Wayne State, followed by a regular-season match between the Cornhuskers and Omaha. The event was declared a sellout on April 27, three days after tickets went on sale. The official attendance for Nebraska's 3–0 victory was 92,003, the highest ever for a women's sporting event in the United States. It also set an all-time attendance record for a sporting event in Memorial Stadium history.\nCoaches.\nCoaching history.\nAssistant coaching history\nVenues.\nNebraska Coliseum.\nNU compiled an all-time record of 511–36 at the 4,030-seat Nebraska Coliseum, losing just three home matches in thirty-three seasons of conference play. In 1991, the Cornhuskers played home games at the Bob Devaney Sports Center while the Coliseum was being renovated specifically to host volleyball matches. NU has hosted at least one NCAA Tournament match every year since 1984, including a 52–4 postseason record at the Coliseum. Nebraska established an NCAA record with their 88th consecutive home win in 2009, a streak that ended at ninety when UCLA defeated NU in front of an NCAA regular season-record crowd of 13,870. In 2008, the AVCA's Kathy DeBoer described the Coliseum as \"the epicenter of volleyball fandom\".\nThe Coliseum was one of few collegiate arenas designed specifically for volleyball. It is noted for its classical architecture and intimate atmosphere. At the Coliseum, the Huskers began an NCAA record for most consecutive sellouts in a women's sport, a streak that continues at the Devaney Center. The Coliseum was the subject of a CBS Sports documentary in 2011.\nBob Devaney Sports Center.\nNebraska's volleyball program moved to the Bob Devaney Sports Center in 2013, which was vacated when Pinnacle Bank Arena was built for NU's basketball teams. The Devaney Center's capacity was decreased from 13,596 to 7,907 with luxury suites on the south side of the court. The capacity was modestly increased to 8,309 prior to the 2023 season. Despite the increase in capacity from the Coliseum, the Huskers' sellout streak still continues and stands at 303, the longest in any NCAA women's sport. Nebraska has led the country in attendance every year since moving to the Devaney Center, averaging over 8,000 fans per game each season. The move to the Devaney Center has made Nebraska's volleyball program profitable each year, a rarity in women's college athletics. With no financial support from tax dollars, tuition, or student fees, the team is entirely self-sufficient.\nHighest-attended matches.\nNebraska has played in eleven of the twelve highest-attended matches in NCAA volleyball history.\nAwards.\nNational Player of the Year\nNational Freshman of the Year\nNational Coach of the Year\nAll-Americans.\nNebraska has had 53 total players account for 102 AVCA All-American selections, including 50 First-Team AVCA All-American selections.\nNational records.\nTeam\nIndividual\nBeach volleyball.\nThe Nebraska Cornhuskers women's beach volleyball team began play in the spring of 2013 as the school's twenty-second intercollegiate sport. In 2016, the NCAA began sponsoring a beach volleyball tournament (previously the sport was run by the AVCA), but Nebraska did not attempt to qualify. Despite the sport's increasing popularity, Nebraska, nearby Wayne State, and Eastern Illinois fund the only volleyball programs in the Midwest. NU generally plays the bulk of its season during a spring break trip to California and Hawaii, and its beach roster is made entirely of players from its indoor program. John Cook, who coaches both programs, has said the school views beach volleyball primarily as a training and recruiting tool for its indoor team. Beach volleyball competes as an independent, making it one of only three programs at Nebraska not affiliated with the Big Ten.\nOn March 8, 2017, Nebraska hosted Missouri Baptist at the Hawks Championship Center. The match, closed to the public due to space limitations, was the first collegiate beach volleyball match held in the state of Nebraska. The Cornhuskers swept the Spartans 5–0.\nIn 2007, Jordan Larson and Sarah Pavan defeated student-athletes from seven other schools to win the Collegiate Beach Volleyball Championship, an invitational tournament featuring two players per school."

This was the first Masters played with a 36-hole cut; 101 players started and forty made the cut at 150 (+6).\nDoug Ford won his only Masters, three strokes ahead of runner-up Sam Snead, a three-time champion. Snead was the third round leader, but could only shoot even-par in a round that included six birdies and six bogeys. Ford was three strokes back after 54 holes, but was bogey-free on Sunday. On the final hole, Ford holed out from the bunker for birdie for his 66 (–6). This was Ford's second and final major title; he also won the 1955 PGA Championship.\nThis year was the Masters debut of Gary Player, age 21, and he tied for 24th. He won three Masters, in 1961, 1974, and 1978. Five-time British Open winner Peter Thomson was fifth, his best career finish in the Masters. Amateur Harvie Ward was fourth at even-par 288, five strokes behind Ford.\nTwo-time champion Ben Hogan had finished in the top ten in the last fourteen Masters that he had entered, but had 32 putts on Friday and missed the event's first-ever cut by a stroke. It was the only cut he missed at Augusta; in nine more Masters he had three top ten finishes, including his final appearance at age 54 in 1967.\nField.\nThis was the last year when professionals were invited based solely on qualification in amateur events.\nJack Burke Jr. (4,8,10,11), Jimmy Demaret, Claude Harmon (10), Ben Hogan (2,3,4,8,9), Herman Keiser, Cary Middlecoff (2,8,9,11), Byron Nelson (2,4), Henry Picard (4), Gene Sarazen (2,3,4), Horton Smith, Sam Snead (3,4,8,9,10,11), Craig Wood\nJulius Boros (8,9), Billy Burke, Jack Fleck, Ed Furgol (8,9,10), Lawson Little (5), Tony Manero, Lloyd Mangrum (8), Fred McLeod, Sam Parks Jr., Lew Worsham\nJock Hutchison (4), Denny Shute (4)\nWalter Burkemo (8), Doug Ford (8,9,11), Vic Ghezzi, Bob Hamilton, Chick Harbert (11), Chandler Harper (11), Johnny Revolta, Paul Runyan, Jim Turnesa (8)\nDick Chapman (a), Charles Coe (a), Joe Conrad (6), Gene Littler (8), Billy Maxwell (9), Arnold Palmer (8,9), Skee Riegel, Frank Stranahan (8), Sam Urzetta (8), Bud Ward, Harvie Ward (6,7,a)\nWilliam C.

        "text": "The 1958 Masters Tournament was the 22nd Masters Tournament, held April 3–6 at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia. Arnold Palmer won the first of his four Masters titles, one stroke ahead of runners-up Doug Ford and Fred Hawkins. It was the first of his seven major titles.\nPalmer, age 28, was the third round co-leader and eagled the 13th hole on Sunday to propel him to victory, as he three-putted on the final green. Three-time champion Sam Snead, age 45, was the other co-leader after 54 holes, but shot a 79 (+7) on Sunday to fall to 13th place. One stroke back entering the final round was 1955 champion Cary Middlecoff, who carded a 75 in the final round and tied for 6th.\nPalmer's first Masters victory was not without some controversy. On the 12th hole of the final round, Palmer thought his tee ball was embedded behind the green but the on-site rules official would not give him relief. Playing that ball as it lay, Palmer made a double-bogey. Upset over the questionable ruling and the double-bogey, Palmer then played a second ball from behind the green and, after taking relief, made a par. Several holes later word came from the tournament officials that Palmer was entitled to relief and his par score on 12 would stand.\nPrior to the tournament, two stone arch bridges crossing Rae's Creek were dedicated, honoring two-time champions Ben Hogan and Byron Nelson. Hogan's is at the par-3 12th hole, and commemorated his record 72-hole score in 1953, his second win at Augusta and first of three consecutive majors that year. The other bridge departs the 13th tee; Nelson went birdie-eagle at these two holes in the final round in 1937, gained six strokes on the leader, and won the first of his five majors.\n\"Sports Illustrated\" writer Herbert Warren Wind first used the term \"Amen Corner\" in a story to describe where the critical final day's action had occurred.\nThis was the first major to have a five-figure winner's share; six figures arrived at the 1983 PGA Championship and seven at the 2001 Masters.\nField.\nJack Burke Jr. (4,8,11), Jimmy Demaret (8,9), Doug Ford (4,8,11), Claude Harmon (10), Ben Hogan (2,3,4), Herman Keiser, Cary Middlecoff (2,9), Byron Nelson (2,4,8), Henry Picard (4), Gene Sarazen (2,3,4), Horton Smith, Sam Snead (3,4,8,9), Craig Wood (2)\nJulius Boros (9), Billy Burke, Jack Fleck, Ed Furgol (8,11), Tony Manero, Lloyd Mangrum, Dick Mayer (9,10,11), Fred McLeod, Sam Parks Jr., Lew Worsham\nJock Hutchison (4), Denny Shute (4)\nWalter Burkemo (9,10), Vic Ghezzi, Chick Harbert (9), Chandler Harper, Lionel Hebert (10,11), Johnny Revolta, Paul Runyan, Jim Turnesa\nDick Chapman (7,a), Charles Coe (a), Hillman Robbins (7,a), Harvie Ward (8,a)\nRex Baxter (7,a), Arnold Blum (a), Joe Campbell (a), William C.

He played college football for the Miami Hurricanes from 1991 to 1994.\nBiography.\nCosta played several sports at St. Joseph's Preparatory School in Philadelphia. When he graduated from high school, he held virtually every passing record in the city's history including completions in a game (27), season (196), and career (373); as well as yards passing in a season (2547) and career (4760); and touchdowns in a season (24) and career (35). \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" named Costa as the quarterback on their all-decade high school team for the 1980s. After being recruited nationally, he chose to play football at the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida.\nIn his first two seasons with the Hurricanes, Costa was a backup quarterback, behind starter Gino Torretta. In his final two seasons, Costa was the starter for most of Miami's games, including a memorable win against rival Florida State on October 8, 1994. The 1994 Hurricanes reached the Bowl Coalition's championship game for that season, the 1995 Orange Bowl, where Costa passed for 248 yards (18-for-35) with two touchdowns and one interception, as Miami lost to Nebraska, 24–17. Costa finished his college career with a record of 19–3 as a starter; he appeared in a total of 34 games for the Hurricanes, passing for 4256 yards and 22 touchdowns.\nCosta was not selected in the 1995 NFL Draft. He had tryouts with the Cleveland Browns, Miami Dolphins, and Philadelphia Eagles, but did not make an NFL roster. Costa played two seasons with the London Monarchs of the World League of American Football, and then one season for the Mobile Admirals of the short-lived Regional Football League (RFL). Costa was the winning quarterback of the league's only championship game, played in June 1999.\nAfter the Regional Football League ceased operation, Costa moved back to the Philadelphia area and became a financial adviser."

        "title": "Bill Edwards (American football coach)",
        "text": "William Miller Edwards (June 21, 1905 – June 12, 1987) was an American football player and coach. He served as the head football coach at Western Reserve University, Vanderbilt University and Wittenberg University in a career lasting more than 30 years, compiling a win-loss-tie record of 168–45–8. Edwards also coached the Detroit Lions of the National Football League (NFL) from 1941 to 1942, tallying a 4–9–1 record, and served as an assistant coach for the NFL's Cleveland Browns in the late 1940s.\nRaised near Massillon, Ohio, Edwards was the son of an immigrant from Wales who worked in the area's coal mines. He played football at Massillon Washington High School and enrolled at Ohio State University, where he stayed for a year before transferring to Wittenberg University. After college, Edwards began his coaching career at high schools in Ohio. He got his first job as a college head coach in 1935 at Western Reserve, now known as Case Western Reserve University, in Cleveland, Ohio and guided the team to a 49–6–2 record over six seasons. Edwards was then hired to coach the Lions, but his brief stay there was unsuccessful, and he was fired at the beginning of the 1942 season. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy later that year and served in the military during World War II until his discharge in 1946.\nEdwards spent a year selling sporting goods in Cleveland, returning to football in 1947 with the Browns as an assistant to head coach Paul Brown, a close friend and former Massillon schoolmate. After two years as the team's tackle coach, he was hired by Vanderbilt in 1949. He stayed there for four years and amassed a 21–19–2 record, but resigned in 1953 under pressure from alumni. After two years as an assistant coach at the University of North Carolina, Edwards was hired by Wittenberg, his alma mater, as head football coach and athletic director. He spent the rest of his career there, serving as head coach until 1968 and remaining as athletic director until 1973. While at Wittenberg, he was named the country's college football coach of the year twice, and his teams posted an overall record of 98–20–4. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1986. Edwards, described as a tough but compassionate coach, had an influence on many men he worked with, including Steve Belichick, the father of New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick. Steve Belichick played for Edwards at Western Reserve and with the Lions, and coached with him at Vanderbilt. Edwards was the godfather of Bill.\nEarly life and college.\nEdwards grew up in Massillon, Ohio and attended Massillon Washington High School. He was a schoolmate of Paul Brown, who later became the coach of the Cleveland Browns and helped found the Cincinnati Bengals in the National Football League. The son of a Welsh coal miner, Edwards dropped out of school when he was 14 to help his family by working in the mines of East Greenville, near Massillon. He returned three years later, however, and became a star player on Massillon's football team. Edwards was a linebacker at Massillon between 1922 and 1924.\nEdwards enrolled at Ohio State University where he captained the Buckeyes freshman football team and was roommates with Paul Brown, his former Massillon teammate. After the season, however, he transferred to Wittenberg University in Springfield, Ohio. At Wittenberg, he played as a center starting in 1928 and was the captain of the football team in 1929 and 1930. A tough player, Edwards did not like to wear a helmet, saying \"you skin your ears a little without them, but I never had any trouble.\" He won All-Ohio honors at Wittenberg and was named an honorable mention All-American in 1930. One of Edwards's most memorable games as a collegian came in 1928 against the Ohio Wesleyan Battling Bishops. In the last game of a season in which Wesleyan had a perfect record and beat football powerhouses Michigan and Syracuse, Edwards kicked an extra point as time expired and gave Wittenberg a 7–6 victory. Grantland Rice, a prominent sportswriter of the time, called him the best center in college football. Walter Eckersall of the \"Chicago Tribune\" named him an All-American.\nCoaching career.\nHigh school and Western Reserve.\nEdwards got his first coaching job in 1931, when he was hired as an assistant football coach at Springfield High School. He also taught history at the school. The following year, he got his first head coaching job at Fostoria High School in Fostoria, Ohio. After two seasons at Fostoria, during the second of which the team put in its best performance in 10 years with an 8–2 record, he left to coach the freshman football team at Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio in 1933. When Reserve head coach Sam Willaman died suddenly in August 1935, players lobbied for Edwards to take his place; Edwards got the job. Edwards brought in former Massillon and Wittenberg teammate and Fostoria aide Roy A. \"Dugan\" Miller as his chief assistant, and the Western Reserve Red Cats went undefeated in his first two seasons as coach. The team had a 49–6–2 record between the 1935 and 1940 seasons under Edwards. In his last season, Western Reserve reached the Sun Bowl in El Paso, Texas against Arizona State and won the game 26–13 on New Year's Day in 1941.\nDetroit Lions, military service, and Cleveland Browns.\nHaving built a strong record at Western Reserve, Edwards was in the running for head coaching roles at a number of larger universities and professional teams. He met with officials at Marquette University and was considered a candidate for coaching duties at the University of Colorado and for the National Football League's Detroit Lions. After visiting with Lions owner Fred Mandel, Edwards ultimately was hired in February 1941 to succeed George Clark. Both Edwards and Dugan Miller signed two-year contracts. Edwards was given a $10,000 annual salary ($ in dollars), more than double the $4,420 he was paid at Western Reserve.\nEdwards's stint as the Lions coach was unsuccessful. He guided the team to a 4–6–1 record in 1941, and Mandel fired him after three straight losses to begin the 1942 season as the team's roster was depleted by players' service in World War II. Detroit went on to lose all the rest of its games after John Karcis was named his replacement.\nEdwards enlisted in the U.S. Navy later in 1942 as America's involvement in the war intensified. While in the military, he served at St. Mary's Pre-Flight, a training program in California, and coached the Air Devils football team there. He also served at a base in Pensacola, Florida. Edwards was discharged in 1946, and spent a year in the sporting goods business in Cleveland, Ohio before reuniting with Brown, who had become the first coach of the Cleveland Browns in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Edwards took a position as a tackle coach and remained with the team for two seasons. He coached tackles including Ernie Blandin, Lou Rymkus and future Pro Football Hall of Fame member Lou Groza. The Browns won the AAFC championship in both of Edwards's years as an assistant; the team won all of its games in 1948, turning in professional football's first perfect season.\nVanderbilt, North Carolina, and Wittenberg.\nEdwards was hired as Vanderbilt University's head football coach and athletic director in 1949, replacing Henry Russell Sanders when Sanders left to become head coach at the University of California, Los Angeles. Vanderbilt gave the 43-year-old coach a three-year contract paying a $12,500 salary ($ in today's dollars). \"I don't like to leave the Cleveland Browns and Paul Brown in particular,\" he said at the time. \"I'll never forget my experiences with the Browns over the past two years.\" Edwards remained at Vanderbilt for four seasons, building up a 21–19–2 record. He instituted a modern T formation offense to replace Sanders's more traditional single-wing formation. He resigned in 1953 under pressure from Vanderbilt alumni following a 3–5–2 season. He then moved to the University of North Carolina, where he was an assistant on the football team's coaching staff in 1953 and 1954.\nEdwards was hired as athletic director and head football coach at Wittenberg, his alma mater, in 1955. He put in a pro-style offense and focused on passing because his players were smaller than many opponents. \"We had small players, but little guys can throw the football and little guys can catch it, whereas you need big guys to block for a running game,\" he said in 1973. Under Edwards, the Wittenberg Tigers were a major success, amassing a 98–20–4 record in 14 seasons and winning the NCAA College Division national championship poll in 1962 and 1964. Edwards's teams were unbeaten three times and lost one game in five of his seasons there. He was named Ohio College Football Coach of the Year in 1957 by his fellow coaches. The American Football Coaches Association named him coach of the year in 1963 and 1964, when the Tigers won all of their games. He was called \"a combination of Genghis Khan and Santa Claus\" by \"Sports Illustrated\" for being both tough and sympathetic to his players.\nLater life and death.\nEdwards resigned from coaching in 1969, when he was 63 years old, although he continued to work at Wittenberg as the school's athletic director. Dave Maurer, his long-time assistant, took over as the school's coach. By the end of his career, Edwards's 168–45–8 overall college record gave him the second-best winning percentage in the country among active coaches with at least 100 wins. Edwards was given a commendation by President Richard Nixon for his achievements as a coach and won a Football Writers Association of America award for contributions to the game. \"His retirement is Wittenberg's loss, but more than that, it is college football's loss,\" University of Alabama coach Bear Bryant said at the time.\nEdwards retired in February 1973 after 39 years as a coach and administrator and said he would concentrate on hunting and fishing. He was inducted into the Ohio Football Coaches Association Hall of Fame in 1979, Wittenberg's Athletics Hall of Honor in 1985 and into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1986. He was also inducted into the Western Reserve Hall of Fame and the Vanderbilt Hall of Fame in 1986. Edwards died in 1987. He and his wife Dorothy had three children.\nThe tough but compassionate approach to coaching Edwards espoused influenced many men who worked under him, including Maurer, who led Wittenberg to a 129–23–3 record between 1969 and 1983. Wittenberg's football stadium is named Edwards-Maurer Field in honor of both head coaches. The winner of the Wittenberg-Case Western Reserve football game receives the \"Bill Edwards Trophy\".\nEdwards was also close with Steve Belichick, who played for him at Western Reserve and for the Detroit Lions and later served as an assistant under him at Vanderbilt and North Carolina. Belichick's son Bill was named after Edwards, who was also Bill's godfather. Bill Belichick later became an assistant coach in the NFL and is the head coach of the New England Patriots as of . At what is now known as Case Western Reserve University, the football stadium, DiSanto Field, hosts its distinguished guests inside the \"Coach Bill Edwards President's Suite.\""

        "title": "Soviet Union national rugby union team",
        "text": "The USSR national rugby union team (, ) represented the Soviet Union in rugby union until the early 1990s.\nHistory.\nAlthough tournaments such as the Soviet Cup and the Soviet Championship existed, rugby never became a major sport in the USSR. Rugby union was the more popular of the two rugby codes, however, as rugby league only began being played following the collapse of the Soviet Union.\nRugby football was played in the Russian Empire as early as 1884; however, the first official match, played in Moscow, did not take place until 1923. Because of the Russian Revolution, some Soviet/Russian players emigrated and/or ended up playing for foreign sides, a notable example being Prince Alexander Obolensky (Александр Сергеевич Оболенский) who played for Oxford and England in the 1930s – he was the scorer of 2 tries on his England debut in their win over New Zealand in January 1936. His noble birth precluded him from playing in his home country and his family had fled the country when he was only a year old.\nIn 1935 the Moscow Championship was initiated, followed by the first Soviet Championship which took place in 1936.\nIn 1949, rugby union was forbidden throughout the USSR during the \"fight against cosmopolitanism\". Competition was resumed in 1957, and the Soviet Championship recommenced in 1966. In 1975, the Soviet national team played their first ever match.\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, the Soviet team began to improve their performances, often coming second to France, or third to Romania in the FIRA tournament. The team were never given the opportunity to play a tier 1 nation where test caps were awarded.\nThe organisers of the 1987 Rugby World Cup had intended to invite the USSR as one of the participants. However, before the invitation could be made, the USSR refused to take part on political grounds, allegedly due to the continued IRB membership of South Africa. The first tournament was by invitation rather than qualification, and despite successes against teams such as Italy and Romania in the years leading up to the inaugural Cup, the USSR did not enter.\nThe Soviet team did not attempt to qualify for the 1991 Rugby World Cup finals. They played their last game against Spain in the FIRA tournament in November 1991, shortly before the country's own dissolution. The USSR's successor was briefly the Commonwealth of Independent States, after which the former constituent states formed their own national teams.\nUSSR tour to New Zealand.\nIn 1991, in preparation for the Rugby World Cup New Zealand hosted short tours by Western Samoa, Fiji, Romania and the USSR. There were no matches of Test status played by New Zealand against the tourists, but a side designated \"New Zealand XV\" met both the Romanians and Soviets, and both opponents awarded caps for the XV game. The tours gave the New Zealand selectors a chance to gauge the form of players likely to be on the periphery of selection for the World Cup. \nThe USSR tour party comprised 26 players and was led from the front-row by Sergei Molchenov. They won four and lost four matches:\nThe teams in the \"test\" match:\nJune 16, 1991 at Rugby Park, Hamilton&lt;br&gt;\nNew Zealand XV 56 (8G 2T) – USSR 6 (1PG 1DG)&lt;br&gt;\nNew Zealand XV: E J Crossan; E Clarke, W K Maunsell, T D L Tagaloa; A F McCormick, J P Preston; J A Hewett; O M Brown, N J Hewitt, M R Allen, R M Brooke, D W Mayhew, M P Carter, W T Shelford (captain), W R Gordon\nTries: McCormick (2), Crossan (2), Maunsell (2), Tagaloa (2), Shelford, Carter &lt;br&gt;\nConversions: Crossan (8)\nSoviet Union: V Voropaev; A Zakarliuk, I Kuperman, A Kovalenko, I Mironov; S Boldakov, A Bychkov; E Kabylkin, S Molchenov (captain), R Bikbov, S Sergeev, E Ganiakhin, V Negodin, A Ogryzkov, A Tikhonov &lt;br&gt;\nReplacements used: Y Nikolaev, V Zykov\nPenalty Goal: Boldakov &lt;br&gt;\nDropped Goal: Boldakov\nReferee: Mr D J Bishop\nSoviet tour to England.\nIn September, the USSR were guests of the RFU and played the Combined London Old Boys at Croxley Green (OMTs' ground) before meeting an England XV in a World Cup warm-up game on September 7, 1991 at Twickenham where they lost 53–0 to a full-strength non-cap XV side led by Will Carling.\nFinal games as CIS.\nTheir last representative matches as a united Soviet side were during the 1991–92 season. A team labelled \"CIS\" fulfilled their remaining FIRA Championship fixtures against Italy, Spain, Romania and France A.\nRussia has competed as a separate entity at the international level since 1992.\nNotable players.\n200 Soviet players became Masters of Sport. Two notable ones are:\nSuccessor teams.\nThe rugby teams of the USSR's successor states have had varying success.\nInitially, the former USSR competed under the Commonwealth of Independent States banner, but this itself terminated in 1992. It had played four matches.\nThe most successful \"successor\" rugby team has been Georgia, which competed in the 2003 Rugby World Cup, 2007, 2011, 2015 and 2019. They had a respectable performance against Ireland and defeated Namibia twice in 2007 and 2015, defeated Tonga 17-10 in 2015. The Rugby World Cup, coincidentally, got going at around the point that the Soviet Union was disintegrating – no other ex-Soviet team other than Georgia had ever qualified until 2011 when Russia qualified, and the early World Cups were also smaller tournaments. The Georgia Rugby Union was founded in 1964, but did not compete as a national team during the Soviet Era.\nAs of 3 March 2008, however, Russia's form had improved greatly, being placed at 17th position in the world rankings, ahead of Portugal, the USA, Japan, and coming one point behind Romania.\nAfter the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, World Rugby and Rugby Europe suspended Russia from international and European continental rugby union competition. In addition, the Rugby Union of Russia was suspended from World Rugby and Rugby Europe.\nENC.\nThe following successor teams are in the European Nations Cup:"

        "text": "Kevin Richard Hart (born December 29, 1982) is a former professional baseball pitcher who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Chicago Cubs and Pittsburgh Pirates. As of , he is a Major League Professional Scout for the New York Yankees.\nCareer.\nHart attended Jesuit College Preparatory School of Dallas and played collegiately at the University of Maryland before being selected by the Baltimore Orioles in the 11th round (319th pick) in the 2004 Major League Baseball Draft. On December 7, 2006, Hart was acquired by the Chicago Cubs as the player to be named later in a trade that had sent Freddie Bynum to the Orioles a day earlier.\nWhen rosters expanded, he made his major league debut on September 4, , after being called up from the Double-A Tennessee Smokies that same day. Hart's debut came under difficult circumstances, as he was summoned to relieve Will Ohman in the 8th inning of a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers with the bases loaded and nobody out. After walking the first batter (former Cub Ramón Martínez) on 4 pitches to force in a run, Hart struck out Mark Sweeney, and Rafael Furcal hit into an inning-ending double play. Hart gave up one hit in his second inning of work while also striking out Jeff Kent and Andre Ethier, for a total of three strikeouts, one hit, and no runs in his two-inning Major League debut.\nDespite his inexperience, manager Lou Piniella showed a willingness to use Hart as the Cubs progressed through the stretch run of a pennant race, and he appeared in several close games in September. He was impressive enough during his limited time to be chosen as one of the 11 pitchers on the team's playoff roster. Hart made 8 appearances in September's stretch playoff run. He held a 0.82 ERA with 11 innings pitched, 13 strikeouts, and held batters to a .189 batting average.\nAfter spring training in 2009, he was sent to the Triple A Iowa Cubs.\nHart made his first start of 2009, on July 8, against the Atlanta Braves at Wrigley Field. In that game, Hart pitched five innings and allowed only four hits and one run, but was the losing pitcher, as the Cubs lost 4–1. Hart was optioned to the Single-A Peoria Chiefs after the game in order to continue to pitch on his regular schedule while the Cubs were on the All-Star break. He was recalled on July 19.\nOn July 19, 2009, Hart recorded his first career Major League hit and his first career RBI. During a 7-run 4th inning against the Washington Nationals at Nationals Park, Hart, squaring around as if to sacrifice bunt, pulled his bat back and lined a pitch from Garrett Mock into center field, driving in Mike Fontenot from second base, and thwarting the Nationals' defensive attempt to execute a wheel play. Hart would later score himself during the inning on a sacrifice fly by Ryan Theriot. Hart pitched five innings and recorded his first win of the 2009 season in that game, as the Cubs went on to win 11–3, completing a four-game sweep of the Nationals.\nOn July 30, 2009, Hart was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates along with right-handed pitcher José Ascanio and third baseman Josh Harrison for left-handed pitchers John Grabow and Tom Gorzelanny. Just hours before the trade Hart started for the Cubs against the Houston Astros, he went six innings and gave up three earned runs while recording his third win of the season.\nHe would go on to have shoulder surgery in May 2010 and spend all of the 2010 and 2011 seasons on the MLB disabled list. He missed the rest of the season and all of the 2011 season.\nIn August 2012, Hart signed with the Southern Maryland Blue Crabs. He would retire from baseball after the 2012 season.\nExternal links.\n, or Chicago Tribune article, or Chicago Cubs press release, or Play-by-play of Hart's debut He went to Jesuit in Dallas, Tx."

        "text": "Ronald Wesley Taylor (born December 13, 1937) is a retired Canadian physician and former professional baseball player; he is a member of Canada's Sports Hall of Fame and the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame. Born in Toronto, he was a relief pitcher over all or parts of 11 seasons (1962–1972) in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the Cleveland Indians, St. Louis Cardinals, Houston Astros, New York Mets and San Diego Padres. He was a key contributor to two World Series-winning teams: the 1964 Cardinals and the 1969 Mets.\nTaylor threw and batted right-handed, and was listed as tall and (13 stone, 13). He attended the University of Toronto, where he earned a degree in electrical engineering in 1961; he returned to the university to attend medical school after the conclusion of his baseball career in May 1972 when he was 34. Taylor also served in the Royal Canadian Air Force.\nCareer.\nAs a pitcher.\nTaylor entered pro baseball in the Cleveland organization in 1956, attending university during off-seasons. After steady progress up the ladder in the Indians' farm system through 1961, he made Cleveland's Opening Day roster in . On April 11, the Indians' second game of the regular season, Taylor drew the starting assignment against the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park. He proceeded to throw 11 shutout innings and collect two hits in four at bats at the plate—one half of the Indians' hit total against Boston starter Bill Monbouquette. But in the 12th inning of the scoreless tie, Taylor loaded the bases with no out, then surrendered a game-deciding, walk-off grand slam home run to Carroll Hardy and was charged with the 4–0 defeat. Appearing in eight games pitched for the Indians, he returned to the minor leagues after May 20 and spent the rest of the year in Triple-A. Then, on December 15, Cleveland traded him to the Cardinals to obtain first baseman Fred Whitfield.\nTaylor spent the remainder of his pitching career in the National League. With the Cardinals, he worked in 58 games and posted nine wins, two complete games in nine starts, 11 saves, and an earned run average of 2.97. The following year, his eight wins and eight saves contributed to the Cardinals' successful, 11th-hour drive to the National League pennant. In the World Series that followed, Taylor worked in two games and threw 4 hitless innings against the New York Yankees; notably, he went four innings in Game 4 at Yankee Stadium to preserve Roger Craig's 4–3 triumph and get credit for a save. When the Redbirds prevailed in seven games, Taylor earned his first World Series ring.\nHe then suffered through two off-years in and . In 1965, Taylor appeared in 25 games for St. Louis through June 15, then was traded to the Astros for left-handed relief specialist Hal Woodeshick. He pitched poorly in Houston for the next season and a half, winning only three of 11 decisions (with four saves), and logged a nightmarish 6.03 earned run average in 68 total games pitched. On February 10, 1967, former Cardinals general manager Bing Devine, now president of the Mets, purchased his contract and revitalized his career.\nAlthough the five-year-old Mets remained a second-division team in both and , Taylor enjoyed two sparkling campaigns coming out of the New York bullpen, with 22 saves in 108 total relief appearances and a composite ERA of 2.47. Then, in , Taylor was a key member of the \"Miracle Mets,\" who stunned baseball by rising from their ninth-place 1968 finish all the way to the world championship. Taylor formed half of a formidable bullpen duo with left-hander Tug McGraw, leading the club in games pitched (59) and saves (13), winning nine of 13 decisions, and posting an effective 2.72 earned run average during the regular season. He then pitched 3 innings of scoreless relief in the 1969 National League Championship Series against the Atlanta Braves, allowing just three hits in his two appearances, and gaining credit for a victory in Game 2. Then, in the 1969 World Series against the favoured Baltimore Orioles, Taylor worked in two games, surrendered no hits in 2 innings pitched, and saved Jerry Koosman's Game 2 victory that kick-started the Mets' five-game Series triumph. Thus, in his four career World Series games, Taylor allowed no hits and only two bases on balls in seven full innings, with five strikeouts, and faced the minimum of 21 hitters.\nTaylor remained a Met in and and posted seven more wins and 15 saves in 102 total games, although his ERA rose to 3.79. Then his contract was sold to the Montreal Expos, who released him on April 20, 1972, without bringing him into a game. Taylor signed with the Padres, but was ineffective in three of his four appearances in a San Diego uniform; on May 14 against Montreal at Jarry Park Stadium, he gave up home runs to Ken Singleton and Ron Fairly in his final major league pitching appearance.\nOver his regular-season career, Taylor compiled a 45–43 won–lost record, 74 saves and three complete games in 491 appearances, 474 of them as a relief pitcher. In 800 innings pitched, he allowed 794 hits and 209 walks, striking out 464. His career ERA was 3.93. He posted a .103 batting average (12-for-116) in his major league career. He was good defensively; Taylor made only three errors in 169 total chances for a .982 fielding percentage, which was 27 points higher than the league average at his position. In his post-season career, including the 1969 NLCS, he was 1–0 with three saves and a 0.00 ERA in six games pitched, permitting only three hits in 10 innings pitched.\nAs a physician.\nAfter his playing career ended in 1972, Taylor entered medical school at the University of Toronto, having been inspired to do so after visiting field hospitals while on a USO goodwill tour during the Vietnam War. Taylor received his medical degree in 1977; two years later, he returned to baseball as the team physician of the Toronto Blue Jays, serving in that role for three decades, including during the Jays' 1992 and 1993 World Series championships. He also opened a private practice in Toronto, retiring from medicine in 2014.\nRon Taylor was inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in 1985, Canada's Sports Hall of Fame in 1993, and the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 2010. He was appointed a member of the Order of Ontario by the province's lieutenant governor in 2005."

        "title": "Frank Stanton (rugby league)",
        "text": "Frank Stanton (born 7 February 1940 in St Leonards, New South Wales), also known by the nickname of \"Biscuits\", is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1960s, and was a successful club and national representative coach in the 1970s and 1980s. He was educated at North Sydney Boys High School. Both his playing and his club coaching careers were with the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles, although he later also went on to coach the Balmain Tigers and North Sydney Bears. He enjoyed success as coach of the Australian national side from 1978 to 1984, being at the helm in the period when the Kangaroos began to consistently dominate the other rugby league playing nations. Since the death of Norm Provan on 13 October 2021, Stanton is both the oldest and earliest winning of all the living premiership winning coaches.\nPlayer.\nA local Manly junior graded from the Belrose Eagles club, Stanton was a versatile back who played 129 first grade games for Manly between 1961 and 1969. He started out as a talented halfback and later played at in Manly's 1968 Grand Final loss to South Sydney.\nHe made two state appearances for New South Wales and was honoured with national selection for the 1963 Kangaroo tour. He appeared in 18 minor matches on this tour, but did not play in any of the Tests, with the Australian selectors at the time having a wealth of three-quarter talent available in Graeme Langlands, Reg Gasnier, Peter Dimond, Michael Cleary, Ken Irvine and Les Johns.\nCoach.\nAfter retiring as a player at the end of the 1969 season, Stanton became the Sea Eagles' reserve grade coach in 1971, leading the team to the reserve grade premiership in 1973. In 1975, he took over as coach of Manly-Warringah from Ron Willey and was in charge of the side for five seasons until the end of 1979, guiding Manly to premiership success in 1976 and 1978. The 1976 win was a triumph for the astute and powerful Manly triumvirate of captain Bob Fulton, coach Stanton and club secretary Ken Arthurson, who would all go onto higher honours in the game over the next two decades. Stanton spent 1980 coaching Redcliffe in the Brisbane Rugby League premiership, leading the Dolphins to a fifth-place finish.\nStanton was appointed coach of New South Wales in 1978 when selection of players for interstate games was still determined by the traditional \"state of residence\" rules. In 1982, Stanton replaced Ted Glossop as the Blues' State of Origin coach, being the first NSW coach to contest a three-game Origin series. Queensland won the series 2–1 and Glossop returned to coach the Blues in 1983. Stanton again coached New South Wales in the 1984 Origin series, suffering another 2–1 loss to the Maroons.\nStanton was appointed Australia's Test coach in 1978 and over the next six years was rewarded with whitewash wins over Great Britain (1979, 1982 and 1984), New Zealand (1978, 1980 and 1982) and France (1981 and 1982). His 1982 side also won the first-ever Test played against Papua New Guinea.\nThe 1978 Kangaroo tourists, after a successful 2–1 Ashes campaign in England, wound up the French section of the tour in embarrassment, unexpectedly losing both Tests in France. Whilst the refereeing in the first Test came in for criticism, Stanton acknowledged no excuses for the Australians' defeat in the second Test. The 1982 Kangaroo touring side later avenged the French humiliation of 1978, becoming Australia's most successful ever national side by going through the 23-match tour of Papua New Guinea, England and France unbeaten and becoming known as the Invincibles.\nStanton retired as national coach in 1983 and was succeeded by Queensland coach Arthur Beetson. Beetson only lasted for the 1983 series against New Zealand, and was replaced after Australia had won the first Test at Auckland's Carlaw Park, but lost the second Test at Lang Park in Brisbane. For the 1984 Ashes series against Great Britain, Stanton returned for his final stint as Australian coach. The Aussies won the series 3–0 and Stanton retired from representative coaching. During his time as national coach, Stanton oversaw the start of the stellar international careers of players such as Wally Lewis, Wayne Pearce, Mal Meninga, Peter Sterling, Brett Kenny, Kerry Boustead and Eric Grothe.\nStanton was the chief executive of the Manly club from the late 1980s through to the mid-1990s. He was also the interim chief executive of the Melbourne Storm for a period from 2004 to 2006, and was a board director of the Storm as well.\nIn 2010, Stanton was temporarily re-appointed as Storm caretaker-CEO following the sacking of Matt Hanson in the wake of the Storm's salary cap scandal. He remained in this role for three months until Ron Gauci took over.\nAfter his season with Redcliffe in 1980, Stanton then shifted to Balmain to coach the Tigers from 1981 until 1986, during which they won the mid-week Panasonic Cup in 1985. From 1987 to 1989, he coached North Sydney and in 1978, 1979, 1982, and 1984 he coached both the NSW State of Origin and the City teams.\nSources.\n \n "

During his playing career, Klein was a minor league first baseman in the Washington Senators farm system from 1962 to 1968. A left-handed batter and thrower, he hit .278 in 1,733 at bats. After retiring from the field, he spent 16 years as a minor league manager and front office executive with the franchise, beginning in 1969 when it was still the expansion edition of the Senators, and continuing after it became the Texas Rangers in 1972.\nHe managed farm clubs in the Class A Western Carolinas League and Carolina League, the Double-A Eastern League (where his 1973 Pittsfield Rangers club won a division championship) and the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League between 1969 and 1978. In 1976, Klein also added the title of assistant farm system director of the Rangers, and was promoted to head of the club's farm system and then director, player procurement and development, between 1978 and 1982.\nGeneral manager of Rangers, Indians and Tigers.\nIn October 1982, he was promoted to general manager of the Rangers, who had finished next-to-last in the American League West Division that season. The Rangers improved by 13 games to finish third in the AL West in 1983, but the team regressed to only 69 wins in 1984 and Klein was fired.\nHe then joined the Kansas City Royals as assistant general manager for 1985, working with John Schuerholz during the Royals' first world championship season.\nIn 1986, Klein received his second GM opportunity when he took over the front office of the Cleveland Indians. The '85 Indians had lost 102 games and finished last in the AL East, but, buoyed by the slugging of Joe Carter and Cory Snyder, Cleveland won 84 games in 1986—a 24-game improvement—and compiled its first winning campaign since strike-shortened 1981. The Indians were seen as a dark-horse contender for the AL East title in 1987 (making the cover of the spring training edition of \"Sports Illustrated\"), but instead they collapsed completely, losing 101 games and falling into the division basement. The front office was overhauled, and Klein was demoted. He eventually rejoined the Royals, this time as vice president of player personnel, in 1990–91.\nIn 1992, he moved on to the Detroit Tigers, who were in a period of transition with former University of Michigan football head coach Bo Schembechler serving as the team president. Klein was hired as the Tigers' scouting director, but moved into the general manager position at the end of the 1993 season. He ran the Detroit front office for two losing seasons, 1994 and 1995, which were also the last two clubs of the Sparky Anderson era, until another front office housecleaning cost him his job.\nAtlantic League executive.\nIn his later life, Klein was an important figure in independent baseball. As executive director of the Atlantic League, Klein was in charge of day-to-day baseball operations for the organization. In August 2007, he returned to the public eye when he was called upon to discipline former MLB infielder José Offerman after a bat-swinging episode in Bridgeport, Connecticut.\nKlein was associated with the Atlantic League from its founding until his death on August 23, 2017, at Temple University Hospital in Philadelphia from complications from quadruple bypass surgery, only one day after his 75th birthday."

In 2012 this was replaced by a series of four finals. Regardless of that, ISEC was struggling with prestige and promotion and the best European riders were mostly avoiding this contest.\nOn 20 December 2012, at a press conference in Warsaw, Poland it was announced that the competition would be replaced by a new series similar in format to the Speedway Grand Prix. The Speedway European Championship series is promoted by One Sporta Ltd. from Poland for next three seasons (2013-2015).\nAs of 2022, the competition is staged over four rounds in a Grand Prix format, with the winner being the rider who accumulates the most points over the four rounds. The minimum age of a rider to compete is 16 years of age (starting on the date of the rider's birthday).\nDenmark is the most successful nation having had six champions, Jesper B.

        "text": "Front Page Sports Baseball was a series of baseball games created by Dynamix in the mid to late 1990s. It remains popular as a simulation engine for online leagues.\nEditions.\nThe first edition was \"Front Page Sports: Baseball '94\" for DOS. This was followed by the release of \"Front Page Sports: Baseball Pro '96\" released on 30 June 1996. \"\" was released on 31 May 1997.\nGameplay.\nIn batter/pitcher mode, the view is 2D. When the ball is in play the game switches to 3D mode. Team colors can be adjusted, but there are no logos on player uniforms. Each team holds 50 players: 25 players on active roster, 15 in AAA, and 10 in low minors.\nReception.\n\"94\".\nA reviewer for \"Next Generation\" gave \"Front Page Sports Baseball '94\" four out of five stars, lauding it for the ability to control every aspect of the game in order to recreate any baseball game in history. He added that \"Injuries, recovery time, weather conditions, and both amateur and free-agent draft options create an amazingly realistic approach to the management of baseball, while the multiple camera angles, joystick and mouse controls, and crisp VGA graphics keep the arcade aspect of play fresh and exciting.\"\n\"96\".\n\"Computer Game Review\"s Tasos Kaiafas called the game \"not much of a step up from the last\".\n\"98\".\nStephen Poole of GameSpot gave \"Front Page Sports: Baseball Pro '98\" an 8 out of 10, commenting that \"But just as with Sierra's Football Pro games, arcade-style play is not this game's strong point. The graphics, at least from the batter-pitcher perspective, are certainly decent - until you notice there's no option for a pitcher-batter perspective, and that, with the exception of skin tone, all the players are generic in the way they look, the way they step up to the plate, and the way they swing. On the up side, you do have a nice variety of managerial options available in the hands-on mode, as well as extensive control over pitching (type, location, speed) and batting (type of swing and area to look for the pitch). The game looks and feels a lot like real baseball - the animations are dead-on without looking canned and the ball physics seem to be about right.\"\nPB.INI file.\nThe pb.ini file is a standard windows configuration file. Each section affects game play. Some physical factors cannot be altered in a ridiculous way however. For example, there is a section to alter pitch breaks, but you cannot create a \"bugs bunny\" change up or an unrealistic curveball. But the file can be tweaked it so that a pitcher could throw 200 mph or cause a batter to hit the ball 1000 feet. Turf resistance and bounce can be altered; as well as the effect that altitude and temperature has on gameplay. How a pitcher would pitch was based on the count, and game situation. All of the player related factors in the pb.ini file use the player's ratings or a percentage of them based on the corresponding entry in the pb.ini file. Most factors have a base number, then a percentage of the player's rating was added to this base. Here is how bat speed is calculated.\nswingspeedbase=70\nswingspeedPHpct=30\nThis means that the bat speed for a player with a 0 PH rating would be 70 mph, a player with a 99 PH would have a 99.7 mph swing (99/30). This method also applies to pitch identification, run speed, catch chance, and so on.\nThis file gives the game ultimate control. However it was not until recent years that some of the file's effect on the game was clearly understood. Some entries are still not understood completely. Most were learned through trial and error."

        "text": "\"Talkin' Baseball (Willie, Mickey &amp; The Duke)\" is a 1981 song written and performed by Terry Cashman. The song describes the history of American major league baseball from the 1950s to the beginning of the 1980s. The song was originally released during the 1981 Major League Baseball strike, and was inspired by a picture of the three outfielders of the title (Willie Mays, Mickey Mantle, and Duke Snider) together. (Joe DiMaggio was also in the photograph, but he was left out of the song and airbrushed from the record's picture sleeve.) The original sheet music for the song is a part of the Cooperstown Collection, and Cashman was honored at the 2011 Hall Of Fame weekend.\nEach version begins with a synthesizer version of the first ten notes of the song \"Take me Out to the Ballgame\", before the singing starts. Each version ends on a fade.\nA parody of the song, entitled \"Talkin' Softball\", also sung by Cashman, appeared in the 1992 episode of \"The Simpsons\" (\"Homer at the Bat\"). It can also be found on the 1999 CD compilation \"Go Simpsonic With the Simpsons\". \nTalkin' Baseball closes out the \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\" episode \"The Gang Beats Boggs\".\nReferences in song.\nDirect player references.\nThe song's refrain of \"Willie, Mickey and the Duke\" refers to Willie Mays, Mickey Mantle, and Duke Snider, three Hall-of-Fame center fielders, all of whom played in the same city at the same time—Mays for the New York Giants, Mantle for the New York Yankees and Snider for the Brooklyn Dodgers. Other players and managers are referred to in the song, some by full name, some partial name, and some by nicknames. Those mentioned, in order, are:\n\"The Bachelor\" and \"Cookie\" mentioned in the song's bridge are not baseball figures, but childhood friends of Cashman's: Mike Green and Bobby Cook.\nOther references.\nExplanations of some other references in the song:\nLater versions.\nThe song quickly gained popularity among baseball fans, and soon Cashman began recording alternate versions of the song, each focusing on a single major-league team. In some cases, the team-specific versions have been rewritten and updated over time."

        "text": "William Barry Wood, Jr. (May 4, 1910 – March 9, 1971) was an American football player and medical educator. Wood played quarterback for Harvard during the 1929–1931 seasons and was one of the most prominent football players of his time. He was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1980.\nAn accomplished student as well as a gifted athlete, Wood went on to a highly successful academic career in medicine and microbiology at Washington University in St. Louis and Johns Hopkins University.\nEarly life.\nWood was born in Milton, Massachusetts. His father was a Harvard graduate and trustee. He attended Milton Academy. After graduating, he spent a year at The Thacher School in California, then entered Harvard in 1928.\nAthletic and extracurricular career at Harvard.\nA multitalented athlete, Wood earned a total of ten varsity letters at Harvard: three each in football, hockey, and baseball, plus one in tennis.\nWood first made his national reputation as a sophomore in 1929, when he led Harvard to a comeback 20-20 tie with Army: Wood threw a 40-yard touchdown pass and drop-kicked two extra points, including the kick to tie the game at the end. Michigan's Fielding H. Yost called Wood in 1929 the greatest passer he had ever seen.\nIn Wood's senior year, 1931, he was team captain. In one noted game, Harvard came back from a 13-0 deficit to beat Army 14-13 as Wood led two touchdown drives, and made two crucial defensive plays (a touchdown-saving tackle and an interception) to save the win. He appeared on the cover of the November 23, 1931 issue of \"Time\" magazine. He was the consensus first-team quarterback as selected by most of the 1931 College Football All-America Teams.\nWood was at the center of a controversy involving the famous sportscaster Ted Husing. Commenting on Wood's poor play in the 1931 Harvard-Dartmouth game, Husing opined, \"Wood is certainly playing a putrid game today.\" Two plays later, Wood threw the winning touchdown pass in Harvard's 7–6 win. Harvard fans protested Husing's use of the word \"putrid\", and the Harvard athletic director notified Husing's boss, William S. Paley at CBS, that Husing would be banned from broadcasting Harvard home games.\nWood was well known for his role in Harvard's rivalry with Yale, which was led by its own three-sport star, Albie Booth. In the words of the 1931 \"Time\" article, \"the essence of Harvard football this year, as Booth has been the essence of Yale football since his sophomore year, is William Barry Wood Jr., called \"Barry\" by sportswriters and \"Bill\" by friends.\" When the two met for the first time as freshmen, Yale's freshman team beat Harvard's 7–6. Harvard beat Yale in Wood's sophomore and junior years. The Crimson won the 1929 game 10-6 as Wood drop-kicked a field goal and an extra point. Booth, suffering from a leg injury, did not start and had a second-quarter field goal attempt blocked, although he did later throw a touchdown pass for Yale's only points; Booth also nearly took a second-half kickoff return 96 yards for the potential winning score, before Harvard's Hall of Fame center Ben Ticknor managed to tackle him from behind by grabbing his sweater. In 1930, the Harvard defense stymied Booth while Wood threw two touchdown passes, leading Harvard to a 13-0 win. In 1931, The Game\" neither team scored until Booth kicked a late-game drop kick field goal to win 3–0, for Wood's only varsity football loss to Yale in three games. Wood and Booth picked up their rivalry in the spring, and Booth had the last word, hitting a two-out grand slam home run to beat Wood and the Harvard baseball team 4–3. Wood was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1980.\nWood was president of the student council, elected to Phi Beta Kappa, and graduated summa cum laude.\nMedical career.\nWood was also a leader off the field, praised as a model student-athlete by celebrated writers of the day such as Westbrook Pegler and Damon Runyon. He was class president as a freshman and student council president as a senior, and he graduated summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa in 1932. After college, he went on to study medicine at Johns Hopkins Medical School in Baltimore, Maryland. In 1932, he married Mary Lee Hutchins. To earn money for medical school, he wrote a book entitled \"What Price Football – A Player's Defense of the Game\".\nWood earned his medical degree in 1936. He was a National Research Council Fellow in bacteriology at Harvard, then returned to Hopkins in 1940 as a faculty member. In 1942, at the age of 32, he became head of the Department of Medicine at Washington University in St. Louis and physician-in-charge at Barnes Hospital. He remained in St. Louis for 13 years, then returned to Hopkins in 1955 as vice president of the university and hospital, and as a professor of microbiology. In 1959, he became director of the department of microbiology, and remained in that post until his death in 1971.\nBeginning in his undergraduate days, Wood had developed an interest in the role of leukocytes that continued through his career. Wood was an early participant in the Army Epidemiological Board. He was part of a group that published an early paper on penicillin in 1943. He worked on the mechanism of recovery from pneumonia and was noted for early work on surface phagocytosis, research into the pathogenesis of fever, and endogenous pyrogen (now known as interleukin-1).\nWood wrote more than 125 papers and several books, including co-authorship of a microbiology textbook. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1959. He served as president or a board member of numerous professional organizations, including the Central Society for Clinical Research, the American Society for Clinical Investigation, and the Association of American Physicians. He was a member of the Harvard Board of Overseers, the Board of Trustees of the Rockefeller Foundation, and the President's Science Advisory Committee. He received a Distinguished Achievement Award from \"Modern Medicine\" and a posthumous Kober Medal from the Association of American Physicians.\nWood died in 1971. Shortly before his death, an interview with Wood was videotaped for a documentary motion picture in the \"Leaders in American Medicine\" series produced by the medical honor society, Alpha Omega Alpha. The Wood Basic Science Building at Hopkins is named in his honor."

He played college football as a halfback at Marshall College—now known as Marshall University from 1910 to 1911 and Washington and Lee University from 1913 to 1916. Young served as the head football coach at the College of William &amp; Mary for one season, in 1917, compiling a record of 3–5. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1958.\nEarly life and playing career.\nA native of Charleston, West Virginia, attended three colleges and participated in the athletic programs of all three. In 1910–11, Young matriculated to Marshall College (now Marshall University), where he played varsity football, track and field, and baseball. He attended the University of Michigan where he played for the junior varsity football team for one year, and then transferred to Washington &amp; Lee University, where he was a four-sport player, lettering 16 times. During his football career at Washington and Lee, Young led the team in scoring four straight years and served as captain of the team in 1916. At that time, Washington and Lee played such powerhouses as Army, Navy, Georgia Tech, Indiana, North Carolina and Cornell.\nYoung's basketball career equaled his football, playing four years at Washington and Lee, leading the team in scoring three of the four years, and serving as captain in 1915. The Helms Foundation selected him as an All-American in 1917. Young's baseball career also covered a four-year period, in which he led the team in runs scored and in stolen bases each of the four years. He was captain of the 1917 team. Young's track record also covered a span of four years where he ran the 100 and 220-yard dashes. He only lost one race during his college career and held many of the school's track records some of which still stand.\nCoaching career.\nYoung was the head football coach at the College of William &amp; Mary for one season, guiding the 1917 William &amp; Mary Indians football team to a record of 3–5. He was also head coach for the William &amp; Mary Tribe men's basketball team for the 1917–18 season, leading his team to a mark of 6–11.\nYoung served in the United States Army in France during World War I. After the war, he worked in the lumber business in Helena, Arkansas. He returned to coaching in 1928, when he was appointed freshman coach at William and Mary. He retired as Washington and Lee Alumni Secretary in 1958.\nHonors and death.\nYoung was selected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1958 and to the West Virginia Sportswriters Hall of Fame in 1966. He is also an inductee of the Marshall University and Washington &amp; Lee University halls of fame. In 1976, Young was also inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame.\nYoung died on September 24, 1977, at a hospital in Richmond, Virginia."

To avoid injury, she did not perform her vault and slowed down before she hit the apparatus, stepping onto the springboard and touching the vault table. Thinking she would be able to perform another vault, Kramarenko walked back down the runway but was escorted off the floor. The judges immediately gave her a score of \"0\", which was counted as one of three scores for the team's vaulting apparatus. This score was assigned in observation of section 8.1 of the WAG \"Code of Points\", which states that a gymnast is not allowed a second attempt if she has touched the springboard or vault itself in any way on her first attempt, and with which coaches and gymnasts are expected to be familiar.\nThe Russian team petitioned that Kramarenko's qualification score of 13.725 be able to carry over as a mock-compulsory score, but were refused. In another petition to have Russian team members Yulia Lozhechko and Elena Zamolodchikova's vaulting scores averaged and then counted, Russia was again refused. When asked to comment on the incident, Russian coach Andrei Rodionenko explained, \"Nobody knows what happened, it was a shock for everyone.\"\nAny team that scratched on vault would have immediately finished last in the competition, whether it be in first or last rotation."

The ground was built on in 1883. The boundaries of the site, laid out on the former Cattleugh's nursery gardens, are marked by Cadogan Square West, Milner Street, Lennox Gardens Mews, Walton Street and Pont Street.\nThe 1872 edition of \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" described the ground as 'grand and quick and one of the finest playing grounds in England'.\nThe first match played on the ground was Household Brigade v. Lords and Commons on 3 June 1871.\nMiddlesex County Cricket Club used the ground between 1872 and 1876 and played their first match on 23–25 May 1872 against Yorkshire. The ground was also used by South of England and by Gentlemen of the South. Several Gentlemen v Players fixtures were also played there, the first taking place in July 1873. In 1878, the touring Australians played two matches on the ground: Gentlemen of England v Australians and Players v Australians (the last first-class match held on the ground, scheduled for 11 to 13 September but finished in two days). The increasing acquisition of portions of the site for building development, made possible by 'The Cadogan and Hans Place Improvement Act of 1874', discouraged its further use.\nThe former first-class cricketer Thomas Box was employed as an attendant at the ground. On 12 July 1876, during the Middlesex v Nottinghamshire match, he collapsed. He died three hours later.\nThe site was also used for lawn tennis, badminton and other games. A permanent roller skating rink was also added."

        "title": "International Handball Federation",
        "text": "The International Handball Federation (IHF) is the administrative and controlling body for handball and beach handball. IHF is responsible for the organisation of handball's major international tournaments, notably the IHF World Men's Handball Championship, which commenced in 1938, and the IHF World Women's Handball Championship, which commenced in 1957.\nIHF was founded in 1946 to oversee international competitions. Headquartered in Basel, its membership now comprises 209 national federations. Each member country must each also be a member of one of the six regional confederations: Africa, Asia, Europe, North America and Caribbean, Oceania, and South and Central America. Hassan Moustafa from Egypt has been President of the IHF since 26 November 2000.\nHistory.\nThe IHF was founded on 12 July 1946, in Palace Hotel in Copenhagen (Denmark) by representatives of eight national federations. The founding members were Denmark, Finland, France, Norway, Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, and Switzerland. The first president of IHF was Gösta Björk from Sweden. Björk was replaced in 1950 by Hans Baumann from Switzerland. In 1954, the first IHF Men's World Championship, was conducted under the aegis of the IHF, in Sweden with the participation of six national teams. In 1957, the first IHF World Women's Handball Championship was held in SFR Yugoslavia with the participation of nine national teams. Handball was included in the Olympic Games for the first time under the auspices of IHF in Munich 1972 (men's tournament) and Montreal 1976 (women's tournament).\nStructure.\nLaws and governance.\nIHF is headquartered in Basel, and is a federation established under the Law of Switzerland.\nIHF's supreme body is the IHF Congress, an assembly made up of representatives from each affiliated member association. Each national handball association has one vote, regardless of its size or handballing strength. The Congress assembles in ordinary session once in two years (odd years) after the IHF World Men's Handball Championship. The congress makes decisions relating to IHF's governing statutes and their method of implementation and application. Only the Congress can pass changes to IHF's statutes. The congress approves the annual report, and decides on the acceptance of new national associations and holds elections. Congress elects the President of IHF, its General Secretary, and the other members of the IHF Council. IHF's Council, chaired by the President, is the main decision-making body of the organisation in the intervals of Congress. The Council is composed of 18 people: the President, 5 Vice Presidents, and 12 members. The Council is the body that decides which country will host the World Championship.\nThe President and General Secretary are the main officeholders of IHF, and are in charge of its daily administration, carried out by the General Secretariat. Hassan Moustafa is the current president, appointed in the year 2000 at the 28th Ordinary IHF Congress.\nSix confederations and 209 national associations.\nThe IHF is composed of six continental federations which organize continental championships held every other second year: African Handball Confederation, Asian Handball Federation, European Handball Federation, North America and the Caribbean Handball Confederation, Oceania Continent Handball Federation, and South and Central America Handball Confederation. In addition to continental competitions between national teams, the federations arrange international tournaments between club teams.\nUntil 2017, there were five continental confederations. On 14 January 2018, the IHF Council divided the Pan-American Confederation into the North America and the Caribbean Handball Confederation and the South and Central America Handball Confederation. The authority to divide a continental confederation was assigned to the IHF Congress, but the 36th IHF Congress in 2017 authorized the IHF Council to divide the Pan-American Team Handball Federation.\nIHF presidents.\n† Hans Baumann died in office on 9 February 1971 due to illness.\nIHF Executive committee.\nThe following is the IHF Executive Committee for the term 2021 — 2025.\nIHF Council.\nThe IHF Council is the IHF's main decision-making body between meetings of the IHF Congress. It is currently serving a 2021—2025 term.\nIHF Awards.\nThe IHF issues awards to organisations and individuals in recognition of their particular contribution to developing the sport of handball and the IHF.\nThese awards are:"

        "text": "Charles Pierre Thomas Jr. (born December 18, 1984) is an American former professional football player who was a running back in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Illinois Fighting Illini. He was signed by the New Orleans Saints as an undrafted free agent in 2007. Thomas developed into an all-around threat as a runner, pass catcher, blocker, and special teams player. He led the Saints in rushing yards in 2008 and 2009 and again in 2013, when he also led all NFL running backs in receiving yards. He became known for his excellence in executing the screen pass; it was a screen pass on which he scored the Saints' first touchdown in their 31–17 win in Super Bowl XLIV, two weeks after he had scored two touchdowns in the Saints' victory.\nEarly years.\nThomas played high school football at Thornton Fractional South High School in Lansing, Illinois, where he ran for 5,565 yards and 88 touchdowns in his career. He was twice named to the all-state teams of the \"Chicago Tribune\" and \"Chicago Sun-Times\" and as a senior he was player of the year for the \"Champaign News-Gazette\". Some of his self-taught practice for high school football included running up a steep hill with a backpack full of books on and pushing cars around.\nCollege career.\nHe was recruited by the University of Illinois. He led the team in rushing for three seasons. In 40 games he ran for 2,545 yards (6th all-time in Illinois history) and 20 touchdowns, had 57 catches for 411 yards and 3 touchdowns, and a total of 4,451 all-purpose yards (then second all-time at Illinois). Nevertheless, he was not invited to the NFL combine, and ultimately he was not selected in the 2007 NFL Draft.\nProfessional career.\nNew Orleans Saints.\nBrief Overview.\nThomas signed with the New Orleans Saints as an undrafted free agent, on the recommendation of special teams coach Greg McMahon, who had previously been an assistant at Illinois. He was impressive in preseason games and the Saints ultimately decided to keep him while releasing the running back they had chosen with their fourth round draft pick, Antonio Pittman.\nHe signed a new four-year contract before the 2011 season, and in March 2014 he signed a two-year contract extension, ending widely reported speculation that he might be released due to team salary cap problems.\nOn March 4, 2015, the Saints released Thomas, making him a free agent.\n2007.\nThomas's rookie year saw him buried on the depth chart behind Reggie Bush, Deuce McAllister, and Aaron Stecker, only logging 79 touches all year. During Week 2, Thomas turned only the second touch from scrimmage of his NFL career into a 24-yard touchdown against the Saints’ longtime rival, the Atlanta Falcons. However, it was not until Week 17 against the Chicago Bears that the NFL world first witnessed the kind of production Thomas would display over the course of his NFL career. In a game that saw notable Saints’ players Bush, McAllister, Marques Colston, and Terrance Copper all sit or leave the game with injuries, Thomas was afforded the opportunity to touch the ball on 32 of the 83 offensive plays. He finished the game with 226 yards from scrimmage and the second touchdown of his career.\n2008.\nAfter once again starting the season buried on the depth chart, a mid-season injury to Reggie Bush gave Pierre Thomas the lead-back opportunity on the NFL's highest scoring offense. During Weeks 11–16, Thomas averaged 112.8 scrimmage yards per game as the Saints went 4–2. He scored at least one touchdown in all six games, including two-touchdown performances in three of them.\n2009.\nAfter losing the majority of Week 1 to injury, Thomas got his first full-game action of the season going in Week 2 with a rushing performance that would end up as the best of his entire 9-year career. Thomas ran for 126 yards and 2 touchdowns on just 14 carries in a dominant 27–7 victory over the Buffalo Bills. Thomas only received more than 14 carries once more all season, but at 5.89 scrimmage yards per touch, he served as an efficient Saints’ contributor during their 13–0 start to the season. In the NFC Championship Game against the Minnesota Vikings, Thomas contributed 99 yards and 2 touchdowns in a narrow 31–28 overtime win that sent the Saints to Super Bowl XLIV. He produced another 85 yards and the Saints first touchdown of the game on his famous screen pass to help put the Saints in position to beat the Indianapolis Colts with a score of 31–17. This win marked the first championship in New Orleans Saints history, capping off an impressive 16–3 season and Thomas's career best 1,095 yards from scrimmage.\n2011.\nAfter losing all but 6 games of the 2010 season due to ankle injuries, Pierre Thomas bounced back in 2011 with another productive season for the 13-3 Saints. He only had two games all season with over 100 yards from scrimmage, however he still finished with 987 yards on 6.17 yards per touch. After totaling 121 yards in the NFC Wildcard Round against the Detroit Lions, Thomas's season ended earlier than expected against the San Francisco 49ers. In the NFC Divisional Round, he took a shot to the head on the 1-yard line that resulted in a concussion. The Saints lost the game 32-36 and Thomas did not see the field again until the 2012 season.\nThomas is best remembered for the Monday Night Game against Atlanta on December 26, 2011, when he placed a Christmas bow on a football then gave it to a fan as a Christmas present during a touchdown, drawing a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty. The next day, he was fined $7,500 and an additional $5,000 for wearing red and green tape, a violation of the league's uniform policy.\nSan Francisco 49ers.\nOn November 3, 2015, Thomas was signed by the San Francisco 49ers. He was cut by the 49ers on November 10, 2015, after only playing one game against the Atlanta Falcons.\nWashington Redskins.\nOn December 11, 2015, Thomas was signed by the Washington Redskins.\nPersonal life.\nThomas was born on Chicago's South Side, the son of Charles and Greta Thomas. His parents divorced a few years later and Greta moved with her children to Lynwood, Illinois, where she worked for the United States Postal Service.\nCharitable activities.\nIn 2013, Thomas was the Saints' team nominee for the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award in acknowledgment of his extensive charitable activities, including his iCan Foundation, which fights childhood obesity."

        "text": "Alfred Edward Street (7 July 1869 – 18 February 1951) was a cricketer who played for Surrey and later a respected cricket umpire who stood in several Test matches between 1912 and 1926. He was born at Godalming in Surrey in 1869.\nAs a player, Street was a middle or lower order right-handed batsman and an occasional medium-pace bowler. He played regularly for the successful Surrey side in only three seasons, from 1894 to 1896, and his one innings of distinction was an unbeaten 161 against Leicestershire at Grace Road, Leicester in 1895, when his batting enabled a Surrey recovery from 94 for six wickets to reach a total of 385, which proved enough to win by an innings. He disappeared from first-class cricket after 1898.\nIn 1909, Street joined the list of first-class umpires and remained on it for the following 25 years, retiring at the end of the 1934 season, though he reappeared for one match in 1939. He officiated in Test matches for the first time during the 1912 Triangular Tournament and stood again in matches in the 1921, 1924 and 1926 seasons. In all, he umpired in 523 first-class matches.\nIn the 1919 season, Street was the central figure in the Heygate incident in the match between Somerset and Sussex at the County Ground, Taunton. With the scores tied, the injured Sussex batsman Harold Heygate took more than the two minutes allowed to come to the wicket, and, following a Somerset appeal, Street adjudged him to be timed out and the match result to be a tie. Street's decision was upheld by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), though the Laws of Cricket at the time did not allow for a \"timed out\" dismissal and Heygate was marked on the scorecard as \"absent hurt\". For a fuller description of this incident, which caused considerable controversy at the time, see the article on Heygate.\nHis father, James Street, was also an umpire, who stood in one Test in 1890, as well as a player for Surrey. His uncle, George Street, was an umpire too, but was not a player at first-class level. Street died at Exmouth in Devon in 1951."

        "text": "This is a list of Major League Baseball players who have compiled 1,000 runs batted in (RBIs). RBIs are usually accumulated when a batter in baseball enables a runner on base (including himself, in the case of a home run) to score as a result of making contact at-bat (except in certain situations, such as when an error is made on the play or during a double play). A batter is also credited with an RBI if he reaches first base with the bases loaded via a base on balls (walk), being hit by a pitch, or interference.\nAs of April 29, 2024, Freddie Freeman is the active leader in career RBIs, in 182nd with 1,162.\nMLB's official list does not include RBIs accumulated before 1920 when runs batted in became an official statistic. The list on this page is compiled from Baseball-Reference, which credits RBIs from 1907 to 1919 as recorded by baseball writer and historian Ernest Lanigan. One difference between the lists is that Babe Ruth is ranked third by Baseball Reference, but seventh by MLB, which does not count Ruth's 224 RBI compiled before 1920.\nList.\nThrough April 30, 2024, these active players have at least 850 RBIs."

        "text": "Raymond Lawrence Perry (December 23, 1919 – May 3, 1973) was an American professional baseball player, manager and scout.\nCareer.\nPerry was born in San Francisco, California, in 1919. He was 5'7\" tall and weighed 175 pounds. Primarily a third baseman, he started his professional baseball career in 1940 with the Salt Lake City Bees of the class C Pioneer League. That season, he had a .295 batting average, 17 home runs, and 94 runs batted in. In 1941, he spent most of the season with the Tacoma Tigers of the class B Western International League and batted .313 with 12 home runs and 88 RBI. In 1942, Perry played for the San Francisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League, the best minor league during that era. In 167 games, he batted .256 with 12 home runs and 75 runs batted in.\nPerry then missed the 1943 and 1944 seasons while he was in the military during World War II. He returned to the Seals in 1945 and batted .271 with 5 home runs and 67 RBI. In April 1946, he fractured his leg during a game, which kept him out for the rest of 1946 and 1947.\nIn 1948, Perry returned to professional baseball as a player-manager with the Redding Browns of the class D Far West League. He led the league in all three triple crown categories with a .411 batting average, 36 home runs, and 163 RBI. In 1949, he won the triple crown again with a .404 batting average, 45 home runs, and 155 RBI. In 1950, Perry batted .366 and led the league with 44 home runs and 170 RBI. He also managed the Browns to the league championship. In 1951, he batted .349 and led the league with 18 home runs and 128 RBI.\nIn 1952, Perry had short stints in the Pacific Coast League and the class AA Southern Association but played poorly, and he spent most of the season as a player-manager of the El Dorado Oilers of the class C Cotton States League. There, he batted .308 with 15 home runs and 60 RBI, leading the league in homers. In 1953, Perry became a player-manager of the Bakersfield Indians of the class C California League. He batted .337 with 36 home runs and 119 RBI, leading the league in homers. In 1954, he batted .341 and led the league with 37 home runs and 128 RBI. In 1955, he was a player-manager for the Cedar Rapids Raiders of the class B Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League. He batted .268 with 23 home runs and 82 RBI.\nIn 1956, Perry returned to the California League as a player-manager for the Reno Silver Sox. He batted .316 with 20 home runs and 101 RBI. In 1957, he batted .350 with 19 home runs and 124 RBI. In 1958, he batted .290 with 8 home runs and 50 RBI. In 1959, he continued to manage the Silver Sox but did not play. In 1960, Perry managed the Macon Dodgers of the class A South Atlantic League. He finished his professional baseball playing career with a .323 batting average, 348 home runs, and 1,609 RBI. In his 2001 book \"The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract\", Bill James noted that Perry missed four seasons early in his career due to a war and an injury, which hurt his chances of making the major leagues.\nFrom 1961 to 1967, Perry was a scout for the Chicago Cubs. He was a scout for the New York Yankees from 1968 to 1969 and for the Los Angeles Dodgers from 1970 until his death. In 1973, Perry died of a heart attack in Fremont, California. He had a wife and daughter."

        "text": "John Joseph Greene (April 21, 1920 – November 4, 2010) was an American collegiate wrestler and football player.\nGreene competed in wrestling and football at the University of Michigan from 1940 to 1944. He was captain of the Michigan wrestling team in 1944 and was also selected to play in the 11th annual Chicago College All-Star Game that same year. He was inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor in 1989.\nGreene was drafted by the Detroit Lions in the 1944 NFL Draft and played seven seasons for the Lions from 1944 to 1950. After moving to the end position in 1945, Greene became a star, ranking among the National Football League (NFL) leaders in receptions and/or receiving yards each year from 1945 to 1949. He had an 88-yard touchdown reception that was the longest pass play in the NFL during the 1946 season and the longest in Detroit Lions history up to that time. When he retired, he was the Lions' all-time leading receiver with 2,965 receiving yards, 26 touchdown catches, and 173 receptions. He also served as an assistant coach for the Lions during the 1951 season.\nUniversity of Michigan.\nGreene enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1940. While he was a student at Michigan, Greene was a member of the Michigan Wolverines wrestling team coached by Cliff Keen. In 1943, he lost 15 pounds to qualify for the 175-pound weight class. He finished the 1943 season in third place in the Big Ten Conference. In 1944, he was the team captain, compiled a 16-7 record, and was the Big Ten Conference runner up.\nGreen also played for the Michigan Wolverines football team under head coach Fritz Crisler. In 1940, he played for Michigan's all-freshman team. As a sophomore, he was a 6-foot, 0 inch, 191-pound backup at the quarterback position for the 1941 Michigan Wolverines football team.\nGreene remained at Michigan during the World War II years, having been classified 4-F due to a perforated or punctured eardrum. During Greene's junior year, George Ceithaml started all 10 games at quarterback for the 1942 Michigan football team, and Greene became a backup at the tackle position. As a senior, Greene remained a backup at the tackle position, but he was awarded a varsity letter for his contributions to the 1943 Michigan Wolverines football team.\nDespite the fact that he was not a starter at Michigan, Greene was invited in the summer of 1944 to participate on the 11th annual Chicago College All-Star Game, an annual game matching a collegiate all-star team against the prior season's NFL championship team.\nDetroit Lions.\nGreene was drafted by the Detroit Lions in the fifth round (35th overall pick) of the 1944 NFL Draft. As a rookie in 1944, Greene appeared in nine games, five of them as a starter. He was used principally as a blocking back.\n1945 season.\nFor the 1945 season, the Lions' head coach Gus Dorais moved Greene to the end position after being impressed with his speed. Greene started all 10 games for the Lions at the end position in 1945. He led the 1945 Lions in receiving with 26 receptions for 550 yards (21.2 yards per catch) and five receiving touchdowns. He also ranked fifth among all NFL players in receptions, receiving yards, and yards per catch during the 1945 season.\n1946 season.\nGreene's production fell off during the 1946 season, as he appeared in all ten games, but only started two games. The highlight of Greene's 1946 season came in a 17-7 victory (the Lions' only victory in 1946) over the Pittsburgh Steelers on November 10, 1946. In that game, Greene caught a pass from Dave Ryan at midfield and ran the remaining 50 yards for a touchdown. The play, good for an 88-yard gain, was the longest pass play in the NFL during the 1946 season and the longest in Detroit Lions history up to that time. Even with the reduced playing time, Greene's 22 receptions in 1946 ranked eighth in the NFL.\n1947 season.\nDuring the 1947 season, Greene was the Lions' leading receiver for the third straight year. He appeared in 12 games (six as a starter) and caught 38 passes for 621 yards (16.3 yards per catch). He ranked sixth in the NFL in both receptions and receiving yards. Greene's longest reception of the 1947 season was a 47-yard gain on a pass from Roy Zimmerman in a 35-7 victory over the New York Giants. Greene acquired the nickname \"the Cinderella Kid\" while playing for the Lions, a reference to \"his rise to stardom after comparative obscurity while a lineman in college and early in his Lions' career.\"\n1948 season.\nIn 1948, Greene led the Lions in receiving yards for the fourth consecutive season. He appeared in 12 games (five as a starter) and caught 25 passes for 595 yards and five touchdowns. His average of 23.8 yards per reception was the best in the NFL.\nThe 1948 Detroit Lions season was notable for the racial integration of the team. African-American halfback Mel Groomes joined the Lions in 1948, as did African-American end Bob Mann. Mann and Greene, both University of Michigan alumni, led the Lions' receiving corps. Mann caught 33 passes for 560 yards in 1948, only 35 yards behind Greene. Wallace Triplett, an African-American player who joined the Lions in 1949, praised Greene for his leadership in welcoming the African-American players. Triplett recalled: \"I want to say 'thank you' to John because what we have now in the NFL would not have been possible had it not been for him and others like Bill Dudley. John was a star and a captain for the Lions. So, when he and Bill came over to me in the locker room, shook my hand and welcomed me to the Lions, it made a huge impact in my acceptance on the team and in the League. I will always appreciate what John and Bill did for me.\"\n1949 season.\nFor the 1949 season, Greene was selected as a co-captain of the Lions along with Russ Thomas. Greeene appeared in all 12 games for the 1949 Lions, 11 of them as a starter. He had career highs in receptions (44) and receiving touchdowns (7), and ranked seventh and fifth among all NFL players in those two categories.\n1950 season.\nThe 1950 season was Greene's last in the NFL. The season began on a high note for Greene as he caught a pass from Bobby Layne for a 78-yard gain in a pre-season game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Greene appeared in all 12 games for the 1950 Lions, but he was not a starter. He caught 22 passes for 368 yards. Cloyce Box and Doak Walker led the 1950 Lions in receiving, as Bobby Layne began his tenure as the team's quarterback.\nCareer statistics.\nGreene played seven seasons in the National Football League, all for the Lions.

Among the high-profile injured judokas that were unable to participate were Brazil's Flávio Canto, bronze medallist in the -81 kg category at the 2004 Summer Olympic Games, who tore a ligament in his right elbow during the 2007 Pan American Games (during the event, Canto participated as a commentator for the Brazilian paid sports channel, SporTV); and Japan's Tadahiro Nomura, the three-time Olympic champion and heavy favorite in the -60 kg category was forced to withdraw only a few weeks before the event due to injury (his replacement was able to place 7th in the competition).\nIn the leadup to the event, Rio de Janeiro also hosted the IJF's International Congress, congregating the heads of all the national confederations affiliated to the IJF. The meeting took place on September 12, eve of the first day of competition, and in it, some important decisions were made. The first was the election of the new IJF president. Marius Vizer was elected by the attending representatives to replace Yung Sang Park, the current president. In addition, the Congress voted and approved unanimously, the extension of the IJF's president term from 2 years to 6 years. Another decision made in the meeting was the selection of the city that would host the 2011 World Championship. The contenders were the cities of Paris, France and Hamburg, Germany, and the French capital was selected as the host city for the 2011 event. Finally, the Congress also voted on the new presidency of the European Judo Union, with Russia's Sergei Soloveychik being elected president and Jean-Luc Rougé and Vladimír Bárta being elected as first vice president and vice president respectively. Newly appointed IJF president, Marius Vizer, was made honorary president of the European Judo Federation as well.\nAfter the conclusion of competition in the last day of the event, the IJF members voted on the best athletes of the World Championship. In the men's side, Brazil's Tiago Camilo, who won in the -81 kg category by defeating all opponents by ippon (the perfect score, which ends the match automatically), was selected; and in the women's side, North Korea's Kye Sun-hui, who won in the -57 kg category, was chosen as best female athlete in the competition. Both athletes were presented with an obelisk-shaped, acrylic trophy for the achievement.\nResults overview.\nMen.\n60 kg.\n16 September – Final \n66 kg.\n15 September – Final\n73 kg.\n15 September – Final\n81 kg.\n14 September – Final\n90 kg.\n14 September – Final\n100 kg.\n13 September – Final\n+100 kg.\n13 September – Final\nOpen class.\n16 September – Final\nWomen.\n48 kg.\n16 September – Final\n52 kg.\n15 September – Final\n57 kg.\n15 September – Final\n63 kg.\n14 September – Final\n70 kg.\n14 September – Final\n78 kg.\n13 September – Final\n+78 kg.\n13 September – Final\nOpen class.\n16 September – Final"

Foreword by Serge Betsen.\"\nThere are records of women's rugby being played in France as early as the mid-1890s, and in the 1920s a form of the game called \"barette\" was very popular, with national championships. However, after the 1930s the game had all but disappeared and was not revived until 1965 when groups of students in Lyon and Toulouse decided to take part in the great charitable campaign against world hunger. Most of them had brothers and friends who played rugby, so they decided to organise a charity game at Bourg-en-Bresse.\nSo successful was this that a regular series of games began, with clubs being formed as students graduated, initially mainly in the south. In 1969 a national association – the ARF [Women's Rugby Association] – was formed. Despite initial opposition to the game from both the government and the FFR (who briefly banned any FFR officials from officiating at women's games) by 1976 12 clubs were taking part in national competitions.\nIn 1982, by which time the number of clubs had more than doubled, the ARF signed a memorandum of understanding was agreed with the FFR which finally gave their official backing – and in the same year France took part in the first ever women's rugby international.\nPlayers.\nCurrent squad.\nFrance announced their 35-player squad on 8 March for the 2024 Women's Six Nations Championship.\nAward winners.\nWorld Rugby Awards.\nThe following France players have been recognised at the World Rugby Awards since 2001:\nSix Nations Player of the Championship.\nThe following France players have been shortlisted for the Women's Six Nations Player of the Championship since 2020:\nRecord.\n\"Note: Although the FFR list all of the following as full internationals or \"test matches\" in their publications (including their website), they do not award caps for all of the games. In particular, no caps have been officially awarded for appearances before 1989 (when the FFR became responsible for women's rugby), and most matches in FIRA tournaments after 2004 are uncapped. As a result, there can be a significant difference between the number of appearances players may have made for France and their official number of caps\".\nOverall.\n\"(Full internationals only)\"&lt;br&gt;\"Correct as of 29 April 2023\"&lt;br&gt;"

It was released in March 1987.\nReception.\nChristopher Michael Baker of \"AllGame\" rated the game two out of five and said that it showed the developer's inexperience at creating volleyball games. He could not figure out which character he controlled at any given point nor the ball's location as poorly anticipated by its shadow. He criticized the \"annoying\" sound effects. He said that Nintendo had made games for all other sports and likely was obliged to make a volleyball game. He ultimately recommended \"Kings of the Beach\" and \"Super Spike V'Ball\" instead.\nLucas M. Thomas of \"IGN\" said that \"Volleyball\" could be Nintendo's worst sports game, worse than even \"NES Soccer\". He said the controls were automatically frustrating."

        "text": "The Ukraine men's national basketball team () represents Ukraine in international basketball competitions. They are controlled by the Basketball Federation of Ukraine.\nAfter Ukrainian Independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, and joining FIBA in 1992, the national team played their first official match against England on 30 May 1993. Their biggest success so far on the international stage has been qualifying for the EuroBasket nine times, and reaching the FIBA World Cup for the first time in 2014.\nHistory.\nGaining Independence.\nBefore the Ukraine's independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukrainian players took part on the Soviet Union national team during international competition. The Soviets were one of the strongest national teams in the world during this period.\nEuroBasket 1997.\nUkraine made their EuroBasket debut in 1997. Their first match at the tournament was not a warm welcome for the national team, as they were demolished by Spain 54–82. With less than 24 hours to regroup for their next game, Ukraine faced Germany where they lost again, this time by the score of 81–60. In their final match of group play, they defeated Croatia 88–95, to earn their first ever win at the EuroBasket. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough for the team to advance to the knockout stage, as they were relegated to the classification rounds for 13th–16th place. There, the team defeated Latvia, and Slovenia to finish the tournament 13th overall.\nEuroBasket 2013.\nAfter failing to qualify for the EuroBasket in 1999, along with uninspiring results at the finals in 2001, 2003, 2005, and 2011 respectively, Ukraine was eager to turn their fortunes around at EuroBasket 2013. Ukraine was placed into Group A to begin their tournament run. The national team was victorious in their first three matches of the tournament, against Belgium, Israel, and Germany. Heading into their fourth match against the heavily favoured France, Ukraine displayed genuine toughness in a losing effort to the eventual tournament champions 71–77. In their final game of the preliminary phase, the team turned around and displayed resilience in blowing out Great Britain 68–87 to advance to the second group phase. There, they were blasted in their first match of group play against Latvia, but redeemed themselves with a quality victory over Serbia a few days later. Ukraine went on to lose their final game in the group to Lithuania, however, it was enough to clinch a spot into the knockout rounds. In the quarter-finals, Ukraine was paired up against Croatia, although the national team would come up short 84–72. With the loss, Ukraine went on to play in classification matches to determine 5th–8th place. The team defeated Italy, before falling to Slovenia to finish up in sixth place. It was the best result for Ukraine at the EuroBasket to that point.\n2014 FIBA World Cup.\nUkraine made their first appearance on to the global stage at the 2014 FIBA World Cup, through their surprising performance at EuroBasket 2013. Led by former NBA head coach Mike Fratello, the national team won their first ever match in the World Cup, defeating the Dominican Republic 72–62. With their historic win under their belt, the team went into their second match of the tournament confident. However, Finland would pull out a narrow 81–76 victory to drop Ukraine to a record of (1–1). Entering their third match, Ukraine went up against Turkey, and the national team didn't disappoint. They eventually won a hard-fought 64–58 contest, before their pivotal game versus New Zealand.\nWith a berth into the Round of 16 on the line, Ukraine needed one more victory to advance. But they were unsuccessful in the crucial match, as they lost 73–61, to head into their do-or-die game against the tournament favourite United States in a dire position. In the must win game for Ukraine, the national team got off to a strong start, to even possess the lead after the first period. However, the Americans flexed their dominance thereafter, which led to the team being eliminated from the tournament altogether by the score of 71–95.\nEuroBasket 2017.\nAfter failing to make it out of the group stage in 2015, Ukraine looked to make amends on the continental stage at EuroBasket 2017. Ukraine went through qualifiers where the team finished at a record of (4–2), to earn a spot back to the EuroBasket finals. Placed into Group B to begin the tournament, Ukraine was defeated in their first two matches against Germany and Italy. In their third game, the national team would eventually pickup their first victory against Georgia 81–88. Sitting at a record of (1–2), Lithuania handed Ukraine a damaging 62–94 defeat. With one game remaining in group play, and a spot into the knockout stage on the line, the team was up against one of the tournament co-hosts Israel. The national team ultimately displayed supreme urgency to punch their ticket to advance, with a dominant 64–88 win. Entering the Round of 16, however, was where Ukraine would come up short, by getting thoroughly defeated by the eventual champions of the tournament Slovenia 55–79.\n2019 FIBA World Cup qualification.\nFor the first round of qualifying to the 2019 FIBA World Cup, Ukraine was drawn into Group B. The national team would open up their qualifying campaign with a solid road victory against Sweden 76–84. They would eventually attain a (3–3) record in the group to advance to the second and final phase of qualifying.

        "text": "Robert \"Bobby\" Crawford (born May 27, 1960 in Long Island, New York) is a retired American ice hockey right winger. He played in 16 National Hockey League games for the Colorado Rockies and the Detroit Red Wings.\nProfessional career.\nMinor league hockey.\nCrawford joined the Austin Mavericks of the Midwest Junior Hockey League when he was only 14. He played hard and was promised a spot on the roster if he were to return after high school. He graduated and returned to the Mavericks, now a member of the United States Hockey League. In ten games during the 1977–78 season, Crawford scored 17 points and showed he could control the tempo of a game. He was selected to play for the U.S. in the World Junior Championships and scored 13 points in the six games in which the U.S. appeared. After the WJC, Crawford decided to head to Canada to compete at higher levels and joined the Oshawa Generals of the Ontario Hockey Association. He remained with the Generals for three seasons, posting huge numbers. In 144 games over three seasons, Crawford scored 123 goals and 142 assists for 265 total points. His last season with the Generals was his best, as Crawford had been signed as a free agent by the New York Rangers of the NHL on November 16, 1979, right before the start of the season. His confidence high, Crawford led the team in scoring during the 1979–80 season with 129 points, placing him seventh in the league in both total points and goals scored. He was named to the OHA Second All-star team and led the Generals into the playoffs, losing in seven games to the Ottawa 67's. On January 15, 1980, Crawford was traded from the Rangers to the Colorado Rockies to complete a transaction that sent Barry Beck to New York. Crawford would join the Rockies for the 1980–81 season.\nNHL.\nCrawford started out the season scoring three points in his first five games, but slowly tapered off after that. He only scored one assist in his next ten games and was sent back down to the Rockies' affiliate the Fort Worth Texans of the Central Hockey League. There he finished out the 1980–81 season, leading the team with 37 points. Crawford scored two goals in the Texans' short playoff series against the Salt Lake Golden Eagles. He remained on the Texans for the 1981–82 season scoring 54 points, but failing to help his team make the playoffs. After that season, Crawford was released from his contract and he quickly signed as a free agent with the Detroit Red Wings in June 1982.\nCrawford started out the season with the Adirondack Red Wings of the American Hockey League where he regained his scoring touch. He ended up second on the team in scoring behind Ted Nolan with 61 total points. He was also called up for a single NHL game during the 1982–83 season in which he failed to record a point for the Red Wings. Back in the minors, Crawford increased his scoring during the six game playoff series against the Fredericton Express, but despite his seven points, Adirondack failed to make it out of the first round. Crawford retired from North American hockey after that season and decided to try his luck overseas.\nInternational play.\nCrawford started out in the Swiss league for HC La Chaux-de-Fonds. He again found his scoring touch, albeit in a weaker league, scoring 78 points in only 38 games. He later joined EHC Olten for the 1984–85 and 1985–86 seasons before moving on to Germany, playing for EC Bad Tölz where he scored 137 points in 50 games. He again led his team in scoring and again was seventh in the league for total points. Crawford also added 41 points in 17 playoff games for a grand total of 178 points in 67 games, ending in a 2.7 point-per-game total for the entire 1986–87 season. Crawford then headed to Italy, where he joined HC Merano of the Serie A. He scored 38 points for them before moving to Britain, to join the Southampton Vikings of the British Hockey League. After scoring 102 points for the 1987–88 season, Crawford again moved, this time back to Germany. He would play for three more German teams, Star Bulls Rosenheim, Bayreuth SV, and Regensburg EV before retiring after the 1991–92 season."

He was born in St. Louis, Missouri.\nBecker started his professional career in the St. Louis Cardinals minor league system, and played for various clubs between 1930 and 1933. After not playing in 1934, he spent 1935 with the San Francisco Seals. He was then picked up by the Cleveland Indians, and played for them for two seasons. In his major league career, he played in 40 games and had a .241 batting average. His 20 hits included five doubles, two triples, and one home run, which came against Jim Henry of the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park on June 2, 1936. He was credited with 13 runs batted in.\nManager and pitching coach.\nAfter serving in the United States Navy during World War II, Becker managed in the minor leagues from 1946–54, including stints with the Triple-A Toronto Maple Leafs, Jersey City Giants and Charleston Senators.\nBetween 1955 and 1970, Becker was a pitching coach in the National League for the Brooklyn / Los Angeles Dodgers (1955–64), St. Louis Cardinals (1965–66) and Chicago Cubs (1967–70). A member of the relatively small fraternity of former catchers who became celebrated throughout baseball as pitching coaches (which included men such as Ray Berres, Dave Duncan, Rube Walker and Mike Roarke), Becker worked for four NL championship Dodger clubs, including the 1955, 1959 and 1963 world champions. He also doubled as the Dodgers' first-base coach during the early 1960s.\nBecker's coaching career ended in August 1970, when he was felled by a heart ailment while in uniform for the Cubs at Wrigley Field, forcing his retirement at age 62. He survived his 1970 illness, and died on January 11, 1998, at age 89 in Sunset Hills, Missouri."

Born in Topeka, he attended the University of Kansas, where he received a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering in 1960. He threw and batted left-handed, stood tall and weighed .\nMiller signed with the Dodgers in 1959 and spent three years in the club's farm system, and then missed the full 1962 and 1963 seasons while performing United States Army service. After starting 1964 with the Albuquerque Dukes, he was recalled by the Dodgers in June after he went 8–0 with a standout 1.68 earned run average in the Double-A Texas League. He was plugged into the 1964 Dodgers' starting rotation, with 14 starts among his 16 appearances. On August 2, he threw his only MLB complete game, a 6–1 triumph over the first-place Philadelphia Phillies at Connie Mack Stadium. He allowed seven hits and only one base on balls, and fanned five. Overall, as a rookie, he fashioned a 4–8 record and a 4.18 earned run average. Then in October he was swapped to the Mets for outfielder Dick Smith, a former Dodger farmhand. Hurling for the tail-ending Mets, Miller appeared in 32 games (with six starts) over parts of two seasons, but won only one of seven decisions with a poor 5.35 ERA. His final MLB game was September 17, 1966.\nMiller's final major league pitching line included a 5–14 won–lost record (for a winning percentage of .263) and an ERA of 4.71. In 145 innings pitched, he allowed 162 hits and 57 walks; he struck out 93.\nHe then pitched three more seasons at the Triple-A level before leaving the game at age 32 after a nine-year professional baseball career. He settled in the Phoenix area and earned a master's degree in engineering at Arizona State University. He spent three decades as a management consultant on major construction projects. Larry Miller died March 21, 2018, in Phoenix, aged 80."

        "title": "Backcountry snowboarding",
        "text": "Backcountry snowboarding is snowboarding in a sparsely inhabited rural region over ungroomed and unmarked slopes or pistes in the backcountry, frequently amongst trees (\"glade boarding\"), usually in pursuit of fresh fallen snow, known as powder. Often, the land and the snow pack are not monitored, patrolled, or maintained. Fixed mechanical means of ascent such as ski lifts are typically not present, but alternative means such as splitboarding, hiking, snowshoeing and helicopters (\"heliskiing\") are sometimes used to reach the mountain's peak.\nHistory.\nIn the early 1960s, at the height of surfing's popularity, the first snowboard ever was created by a chemical engineer named Sherman Poppen in Muskegon, Michigan. Poppen was inspired by watching his daughter attempt to sled down a hill standing up and so he decided to fashion his skis together and then tie rope to the nose for more stability. His wife named his creation the \"Snurfer\", a combination of snow and surfer, and between 1966 and 1977, Poppen sold over half a million all around the country. The snurfer was originally marketed to kids in grocery stores but when more traditional models were created, they were marketed to surfers and skateboarders. Despite the increasing popularity, snowboarding was seen as a gimmick and wasn't recognized as a true sport. More importantly, it was banned from all ski resorts in North America, forcing any prospective boarders to look elsewhere. Backcountry snowboarding became the original kind of snowboarding simply because there was no other choice, boards were specifically designed for powder snow and the experimental board designs weren't designed for groomers. It wasn't until the 1980s that snowboarders were finally accepted into resorts. Despite the new access to resorts and lifts, some boarders chose to continue to ride in the backcountry.\nIn the late 1980s, a snowboarder named Brett Kobernick changed the backcountry snowboarding game forever by cutting a snowboard in half with a hacksaw and then using the two halves to get up the mountain and reattaching them to descend. This later became known as splitboarding and has become an increasingly popular alternative to hiking or snowshoeing. Splitboards gives snowboarders the range and versatility of alpine touring skis while retaining the freedom of a snowboard for the descent. Unlike using snow shoes to access backcountry, the rider does not need to carry a board during the ascent, and does not need to carry snow shoes on the descent.\nSafety Issues and Prevention.\nAlthough backcountry snowboarding is rising in popularity, activities normally performed in backcountry are dramatically different and more dangerous than those performed in winter resorts. Those participating in backcountry runs do not have access to runs that have been logged, bulldozed or previously tested, as well as quick help via snow patrol. This difference causes many more health and safety issues to arise. In general, musculoskeletal injuries suffered in the backcountry occur at a similar rate to those in the resorts due to the fact that the riders venturing in to these areas normally have a certain level of experience. However, backcountry snowboarders are susceptible to more environmental issues like avalanche, frostbite, hypothermia, dehydration, and excessive fatigue due to the lack of snow patrol or warming huts. With that being said, the largest risk when riding in uncharted areas is deep snow immersion asphyxiation. This occurs when riders fall head first into very deep snow, normally around a tree well. The unfortunate occurrence makes it hard for snowboarders to right themselves and they suffocate or essentially “drown” in the snow.\nWhen planning to ride in uncharted areas, snowboarders must follow a list of requirements to ensure their safety. This list includes:\nFollowing these guidelines is imperative to preventing dangerous situations in the backcountry. Practicing these, a rider can ensure he is prepared by also having a pack of emergency supplies at all times. In addition to a helmet and snowboard repair tools, a rider should carry basic safety gear including a map, compass, headlamp, matches, food, water, extra clothing, first aid kit, and water purification tablets. Being prepared for an emergency when riding in the backcountry is crucial considering there is normally no form of help near by.\nEquipment.\nConsidering backcountry snowboarders are in a much more isolated area than people who choose to snowboard at a resort, it is imperative that the proper equipment and tools are packed in order to reach your desired location. While some backcountry trails can be accessed by hiking, some slopes can be very difficult to get to. Oftentimes, it is not feasible to ascend the slopes solely using a snowboard. Common alternative forms of transportation include snow shoeing, or using short skis. These items are ideal because they are short enough to attach to a pack without having to worry about them dragging on the ground when descending the slope.[1] The splitboard is also commonly used as it does not require carrying additional equipment for transportation.[2]\nBackcountry snowboarders should also consider the type of board they use when descending the slopes. The preferred structure of a snowboard differs depending on the desired use of the snowboard (halfpipe, racing, rail riding, etc.). When it comes to backcountry slopes, snowboarders are looking for slopes with fresh powder. The shape of the underside of the snowboard is one element that will effect the board's ride. The terms rocker and camber are used to describe the profile of the board's shape. A camber board has one upward arc in the center of the board with the front and back end of the board touching the ground. A rocker board (or reverse camber) has a downward arc in the center so the front and back of the board have an upward curve and are therefore not touching the ground. Although it can have a slippery feel at first, most backcountry boarders prefer the rocker style snowboard rather than the camber style. The rocker style board provides more flexibility and maneuverability which is ideal for backcountry areas. [3]\nBesides the equipment needed to access the slopes, backcountry travelers of any kind should also consider bringing mountaineering equipment as a safety precaution.[4] Considering the extreme danger someone could be in due to an avalanche occurring, it is encouraged that boarders bring an avalanche airbag pack. An avalanche airbag pack can be a life-saving device. The pack is designed to inflating if a victim becomes caught in an avalanche. The device helps the victim stay close to the surface if they are being carried in the snow, and the inflation of the device helps create a barrier between the victim and the snow to help prevent them from being suffocated by the snow.[5]"

He attended Mesa Community College prior to signing with the Baltimore Orioles as an amateur free agent on August 24, 1970. He played parts of four seasons with the Orioles before being traded to the California Angels for Floyd Rayford and cash on June 3, 1979.

Most of Harlow's career highs came during the season with Baltimore when he scored 67 runs, recorded 112 hits, and 14 stolen bases. Harlow played his final MLB game on October 3, 1981, finishing with a career .248 batting average.\nHarlow made the only pitching appearance in his MLB playing career in a one-sided 24–10 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays at Exhibition Stadium on June 26, 1978. The first of two consecutive position players used as a relief pitcher, he entered the game with the Orioles losing 19–6 at the start of the fifth inning.

        "title": "Sailing in Anguilla",
        "text": "Sailing in Anguilla has a long and deep history, and is one of the defining characteristics of the island. The history of Anguillian sailing is often indistinguishable from the history of the island itself. Sailing craft date back to the Taino and Arawak peoples who inhabited Anguilla before the British Colonisation. However these craft have had little influence on the unique sailing practiced in Anguilla. Instead, it originated from the fishing vessels constructed and built locally after colonization and the subsequent collapse of the local plantation system to provide food and modest income to the inhabitants.\n\"The Battle of Anguilla\".\nThe earliest reference to sailing in Anguillian history involves what is unofficially known as \"The Battle of Anguilla\". In 1796, during the height of the Napoleonic Wars, 400 men were dispatched from the neighboring French colony of St. Martin aboard two frigates, Le Decius and Le Valiant. This force landed on what is now known as Rendezvous Bay. An Anguillian defense force was led by Lieutenant Governor Benjamin Gumbs, and for the next four days they were beaten back through the capital of The Valley and onto Sandy Hill, where they fortified themselves in a former Dutch Fort. Desperate for ammunition, they were said to have used lead weights from fishing nets and musket shot, and an Anguillian sailing ship was sent to St. Kitts to request aid. This ship, whose name was not recorded, came into contact with the H.M.S. Lapwing led by Commander Barton. Barton acted swiftly to relieve Anguilla, and the Lapwing's presence drove the French to attempt to retreat. Le Decius and Le Valiant fled and attempted to escape the British frigate, leaving the soldiers stranded. They surrendered to the Anguillian forces, were imprisoned and then massacred in retaliation for the massive amount of damage inflicted by the invaders. The Lapwing sank Le Decius and drove the Le Valiant onto the rocks in St. Martin, where it was set ablaze.\nEffects.\nThe Battle of Anguilla had several interesting cultural effects on the island. Rendezvous was named because it was the site where the French held their \"rendezvous\" for the invasion. Lead sinker balls are referred to locally as \"bullets\" after the desperate attempts of the besieged militia. However, the main effect was a result of the devastation inflicted on the plantations, in addition to the island's naturally arid climate and hurricanes doomed large scale agricultural efforts. By 1821, plantations were almost totally eliminated. Despite this, Anguillian subsistence farmers managed to grow corn, pigeon peas and other staples. The surplus of especially good yields was shipped overseas. However, as a result of the failure to maintain effectively the only profitable economy it could as a British colony it fell into poverty. Twice, in 1832 and 1843, the Governor of the Leeward Islands recommended a complete evacuation of the island and resettlement of the residents to Guyana and Trinidad. With no other alternative, the Anguillian people turned to maritime occupations - fishermen, shipwrights, riggers and traders.\nIt is considered ironic that the name of the Anguillian ship which was sent for rescue, almost undoubtedly the forerunner of the modern Anguillian racing boat was lost, while the name of the Lapwing survives as a favored name for boats even today, especially among the police force boats.\nTrade with Nova Scotia.\nAfter the American Revolution the Navigation Acts banned trade between the new United States of America and the British West Indian colonies. Canadian territories, especially schooners from Nova Scotia filled this gap in trade. These ships exported Canadian timber and fish and were then reloaded with West Indian sugar, rum, molasses and salt.\nSalt Industry.\nThe salt industry began in 1769 providing Anguilla with an export. This industry was based in the village known as \"Sandy Ground\", which is situated on a stretch of sand between the large Road Salt Pond and Road Bay. Anguilla has roughly of salt ponds, less than half of that of the Turks and Caicos. Although it lacked plantations and had smaller salt ponds, the salt industry benefited from close proximity to Demerrara, Trinidad, Barbados, Antigua and St. Kitts. Schooners returning to Canada from these colonies would make a last stop in Anguilla or St. Martin to purchase salt. These ships would jettison their ballast in Road Bay as the salt was loaded on board. The granite rocks used as ballast accumulated at the northern end of Road Bay and formed a reef known locally as \"The Ballast\".\nPhosphate Mining.\nThe short lived phosphate mining industry was a major source of income for Anguilla in the 19th century. Although there was some mining on the mainland of Anguilla, the majority of the phosphates were mined from quarries on Sombrero. Beginning in 1860, American entrepreneurs invested in several pieces of equipment and construction on the island, including a steam railway, accommodation for workers from Anguilla, a rock crusher and several loading points for ships. The operations on Sombrero declined drastically in 1880, and the supply had been exhausted by 1890.\nEffect of industries.\nThe presence of the schooners and the income from the trading allowed Anguillian sailing to advance. Shipwrighting and rigging were honed considerably during this period. Foreign exchange earnings allowed the purchase of metal pieces for use on ships, such as hawse-pipes and deck pumps. Anguillians who sailed with Canadian and other crews were able to learn and teach new knowledge and traditions to Anguillian sailing peers, improving sailing knowledge in Anguilla. In addition, due to a Canadian policy of replacing Grand Bank fishing schooners after 10 years. Many of these were purchased by Anguillians. By the end of the 19th century, an impressive number of the roughly 4,000 residents of Anguilla owned a trading sloop or schooner. These Anguillians earned a living with their vessels by running a trading fleet. They mostly made shipments for merchants from more prosperous islands. Uniquely among trading boats in the Caribbean, Anguillian boats deducted running expenses from gross earnings, and then the pay was divided up as follows: The owner earned one third of the net earnings and the remaining two thirds. The captain was then paid an additional half-share of the captain's earning. This scheme, known as the \"Share Plan\", was typically used by fishermen, but only by traders in this case.\nMigration to Santo Domingo.\nIn 1895, major American investment spurred the growth of the sugar industry in the Dominican Republic. Large plantations recruited cane cutters from Eastern Caribbean islands - Particularly, St. Martin, Tortola, Anguilla, St. Kitts and Antigua. Although the pay was merely $0.17 per ton of cane and conditions were poor, the opportunity was considered a \"saviour\" by those who took it up, especially among the still poverty stricken Anguilla.\nThe Anguillian trading fleet found it an even greater opportunity - Many of the labourers from islands in the southern end of the archipelago came to St. Martin to find transportation to Santo Domingo. In addition, the exchange also opened up new trade routes between the Eastern Caribbean and Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. However, British law limited the number of passengers to a number equal to its weight in tons. Most schooners, weighing between sixty and ninety tons, were limited to sixty to ninety passengers. To avoid this law, the ships would load to full legal capacity in Anguilla and leave for St. Martin. Once in Marigot, under French jurisdiction, they would be allowed to take on as many passengers as they desired. Usually each schooner carried roughly two hundred men in cramped conditions on leaving Marigot.\nThe schooners (and occasionally sloops) would leave St. Martin on the first or second of January. The ships would leave en masse, on a downwind run to Santo Domingo and La Romana. (The wind typically blows from the east in the West Indies.) On these downwind legs, the crew of each vessel would often attempt to outrun each other to alleviate the boredom of a journey that often took four days. The return trip in July, being a beat directly to windward, was difficult and long, taking up to twenty-one days. It was also more competitive, with much debate on tactics and weight distribution on each ship. Some even breached international navigation rules and switched their starboard and port lights in attempt to fool their opponents. In addition to being a source of entertainment, the schooners that could outrun their opponents were able to deliver their loads home faster. Those with a reputation for speed were able to charge more per passenger, and were usually guaranteed a full load of passengers. Even after the schooners had been derigged and the crews turned to fishing, their passion for racing and sailing experience carried on into the smaller fishing craft.\nThe racing fervor was not limited to crew, however. Passengers on the boats were spectators and volunteers, usually rooting for the boat that they were traveling on. In addition, as most of the able-bodied men were employed as either mariners or cane cutters, the elderly, women and children highly anticipated the return of the schooners. On the event of the top of a mast being spotted, eager loved ones on shore would watch anxiously as two or three ships would fight for first anchorage. In this way, with essentially all Anguillians in one way or another involved in the boat race, it would have an indelible mark upon the culture of the island.\nMany stories are passed down of this time, often considered the \"golden age\" of Anguillian sailing.\nOn one occasion the Ismay and the Warspite were close at the end of the journey to their anchorage in Sandy Ground. These impromptu races would cause great excitement among the people in Anguilla, especially in Sandy Ground, who had their own favourite. The Ismay usually won. On one occasion, the Warspite was tacking back and forth up to the anchorage. The Ismay was on a long tack and passed close to Sandy Island and continued all the way up until she was almost under the lee of the hills. Many of her supporters, some of whom had placed bets, were worried that the hills would kill her wind. It was a beautiful sight to see the Ismay under full sail. The Warspite looked certain to win. Then the Ismay tacked and in a straight reach beat the Warspite to the mooring. The congregation in a church on South Hill slowly emptied as the worshipers slowly went out toi watch, finally followed by the Minister.(Source Daphne Gillanders née Lake -Captain Olando Lake's daughter).\nThe schooners became legends and their captains became heroes in Anguillian history. Some of the notable ships include the Yolanda (owned by Captain Olando Lake), the Ismay (Captained by Orlando Lake and now commemorated on the Anguilla $3.00 stamp) and the Warspite (captained by Joe Romney). The Warspite, which continued sailing decades later under various captains, was later commemorated as a symbol of Anguilla and featured on the EC ten dollar bill.\nIn 1930 the dictator Rafael Trujillo rose to power in the Dominican Republic. The resulting instability and terror sent the schooner trade into decline, and was finished by the end of the decade. The trading fleet switched over to sailing up and down the islands for irregular cargo duties.\nFishing.\nFishing was the main source of food for Anguillians, though it was complemented by subsistence farming. Surplus fish were sold in St. Martin to support the purchase of foods such as flour, rice, cornmeal and salt pork, which were unavailable in Anguilla otherwise.\nThe boats were typically between 17 and , with no deck. The mast was tall and made of soursop wood, with mainsails made of 8 ounce duck cloth and jibs of 7 ounce \"duck\". Three times a week they would leave their villages before dawn and set fish traps at reefs along the length of the island. Usual catches included grouper, butterfish, goatfish, grunt, snapper, oldwife and hammerheads (a blue fish which is now rarely seen). The fish were sold in \"straps\" (six to eight pounds of fish strung together through the gills) for between two and four pence. As refrigeration was unavailable at the time, boats were required to reach shore before midday to sell their catch quickly.\nThey typically sailed in convoys of three or four boats from a particular village. If one boat finished fishing before the others in its convoys, it would \"lay to\" (furl the jib and slacken the mainsail) and wait for the others. Once all were finished, they would race home. These impromptu competitions were the basis for modern Anguillian races.\nSmuggling.\nAs a result of living off of mainly fishing and subsistence farming, Anguillians had little money to hire labor for plowing, or \"holing ground\" as it was locally called. Instead, a communal effort called \"jollification\" would provide the labor for such a task. Several neighbors and friends of the person who needed the help would gather and work together to prepare the ground. This labor would be paid for in demijohns of rum which would be available at the jollification. With little money, Anguillians could hardly the exorbitant duties on rum -- a gallon of rum purchased in St. Martin for 3 shillings in the 1930s would cost 20 shillings including tax. Instead of paying this, the majority of the fishing boats began to smuggle at night. Although the majority of the cargo was rum, staples including flour, rice and sugar were also smuggled.\nContraband would be loaded in St. Martin and then carried at night to Sandy Hill Bay and Little Harbour on the southern side of the island and occasionally to Mead's Bay (then Maid's Bay) on the northern side of the island. The sales were legal in St. Martin, and friendly suppliers would open themselves for business at night as a convenience to smugglers. Jules Petit in particular was a major supplier and owner of an infamous racing boat, the Polaris, which led the St. Martin contingent to races in Anguilla. Police efforts in Anguilla at the time were concentrated on capturing smugglers, which made them unpopular among the people - on one occasion, police escorting two captured smugglers were assaulted and the smugglers freed. (They were re-arrested the next morning.) Many stories and calypsos have been written about the exploits of the smugglers and confrontations with the police and colonial magistrate from St. Kitts.\nThe smuggling boats were typically small, quick and maneuverable fishing boats with an easily collapsible rigging. The ideal smuggling boat would be able to sail across the channel from St. Martin laden with cargo and arrive in Anguilla well before dawn. Upon arrival, it was necessary to collapse the sail and rigging quickly to avoid attracting attention of the authorities. This design lent itself well to racing, and as a result the smuggling boat is the direct forerunner of the Anguillian racing sloop.\nCommunities and families highly prized the smuggling boats, and depended on them to outwit the Revenue Officers. This passion was a precedent to the modern racing fervor.\nRegattas.\nThere are regular sailing regattas on national holidays which are contested by locally built and designed boats. These regattas do not conform to international sailing rules with regard to right of way. Instead, there is only one rule, known as the \"hard lee\" rule. (The name derives from the motion required to tack a tiller boat, which is to push the tiller \"hard to leeward\"). In the event that two boats on opposite tacks are on a collision course, one or both of the captains may elect to call \"hard lee\" to the other. When this call is made, both boats must tack regardless of whether it is advantageous or not. The objective of this manoeuvre is to attempt to gain as much distance upwind as possible before having to tack to avoid a collision. Alternatively, one captain may decide to \"draw\" and either tack earlier or change his point of sail to avoid the manoeuvre. This means a loss in height, but it may be preferable to tacking towards a shallow reef or other unfavourable position.\nAugust Week.\nThroughout the English-speaking Caribbean the first Monday in August is a national holiday commemorating the Emancipation Act passed by the British House of Commons on July 31, 1833. The act took effect on August 1, 1834 and freed all slaves under British control.\nBefore 1840.\nBefore 1840, August Monday in Anguilla was celebrated at \"Landsome Pasture\" (Now Ronald Webster Park). The Anglican Vestry would organize a fair, bazaar and sports meet. A few days prior, the schooner Betsy or the sloops Speed would sail to St. Kitts for supplies including ice packed in sawdust. This fair would last from ten in the morning until sunset, and the proceeds went towards the church. Fishing villages would celebrate informally by holding \"stem-to-stem\" races between fishing boats. West End, Island Harbour, Sandy Ground and Blowing Point would hold their own races with little organization and no prizes. Each village had their own roster of racers and their own courses.\nAugust Monday Boat races.\nThe first organized regatta on August Monday can be credited to good friends Melrose MacArthur Owen and William Elliot Carty, both residents of North Hill.\n\"Mac\" Owen was a highly respected, multi-talented man who was respected island-wide. The son of Herbert Owen (a principle Sombrero lighthouse keeper), he was employed at \"The Factory\" (a general store, small cotton gin and blacksmith's shop), he often experimented with plumbing, electricity and machines at a time when such objects were rare in Anguilla. Despite seldom reading, he was technically gifted and his advice was often sought for repairs varying from roofs to cars. He was also a notable local cricketer. One of the few Anguillians to not fish for a living, he viewed sailing as a sport and developed his boats as such. His vessel, the Violet, a formidable craft, was noteworthy for its odd initial launching (It was lowered down a steep hillside near his home) and its purpose - unlike most Anguillian sailing craft, it was designed first for racing and secondly for fishing. He was known for being reserved and thoughtful, preferring to think deeply before giving his opinion (often some days later).\nElliot Carty, on the other hand, was known for his spontaneous, aggressive and forceful nature. The son of Arthur Romney Carty, owner of the Warspite, he was heavily involved in schooner building, fishing/racing boat building, fishing, trading, rigging and most things associated with boats and the sea. He is credited with building Anguilla's largest schooner, the Liberator, in addition to several others. He took over the management of the Warspite after his father became too ill to work, and later passed it down to Sir Emile Gumbs, his nephew."

In 2002, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Orleans Cardinals of the Cape Cod Baseball League, where he was named a league all-star and received the league's outstanding pitcher award.\nProfessional career.\nDetroit Tigers.\nHe was selected by the Detroit Tigers in the 11th round of the 2003 MLB Draft. Detroit assigned him to the Low-A Oneonta Tigers in the New York–Penn League, where he went 3–2 with a 3.34 ERA in twelve starts. In 2004 Detroit promoted Rogers to the Single-A West Michigan Whitecaps, where he went 6–8 with a 4.55 ERA. Lack of run support contributed to several losses: at one point in April, Rogers was 0–1 despite three consecutive quality starts and a 2.38 ERA. For 2005, Detroit converted Rogers into a relief pitcher and promoted him to the High-A Lakeland Tigers, where he posted a 2.06 ERA in 52 appearances. Rogers and fellow middle-reliever Danny Zell were cited by manager Mel Rojas as integral to Lakeland's success that year, while pitching coach Britt Burns called Rogers \"the most improved pitcher on this staff.\"\nDetroit promoted Rogers to the Double-A Erie SeaWolves where he continued to work as a reliever, compiling a 3–2 record with an ERA of 2.39 by the end of July, when the Tigers traded him to the Pittsburgh Pirates for first basemen Sean Casey.\nPittsburgh Pirates.\nRogers made a whirlwind tour through Pittsburgh's minor league system, making a combined nine appearances with the Double-A Altoona Curve and Triple-A Indianapolis Indians, during which he posted a 1–1 record and an ERA of 0.93. The Pirates called Rogers up at the end of August, and Rogers made his major league debut on September 1, 2006. In ten appearances with the Pirates, Rogers posted an ERA of 8.31, but did not figure in any decisions. Rogers spent most of the 2007 season in Indianapolis, where he went 2–1 with a 3.05 ERA. The Pirates recalled Rogers briefly in May 2006, but optioned him back to Indianapolis after he gave up three runs (including two home runs) in just two innings of work.\nRogers returned to the Pirates' minor leagues for 2008, but was released in mid-June. The Tigers, who had traded Rogers in 2006, promptly signed him to a contract and sent him to the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens. After posting an ERA of 7.65 in sixteen appearances the Tigers released Rogers to make room for Gary Glover. He finished the season playing for the Binghamton Mets in the New York Mets' minor leagues and became a free agent at the end of the season."

        "title": "Danny Thomas (baseball)",
        "text": "Danny Lee Thomas (May 9, 1951June 12, 1980) was a Major League Baseball player who played for the Milwaukee Brewers in late 1976 and early 1977. During his brief major league career, he became known as the \"Sundown Kid\" because of his well-publicized refusal to play on seventh-day Sabbath.\nEarly years.\nBorn in Birmingham, Alabama, Thomas grew up in East Carondelet, Illinois, graduated from Dupo Senior High School, and played college baseball at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale. In June 1971, he played in the College World Series; the Southern Illinois Salukis advanced to the championship game, but lost to the USC Trojans 7–2 on June 17.\nThe next year, Thomas was picked sixth overall in the 1972 amateur draft by the Milwaukee Brewers. In 1975, he was suspended for a half-season for striking an umpire, but in 1976 he had a league-leading .325 batting average in the Eastern League, playing for the Berkshire Brewers, and was named the league's Player of the Year. He won the Eastern League's Triple Crown by also leading in home runs and runs batted in, an accomplishment that was not equalled in that minor league until Lou Montañez garnered the Eastern League Triple Crown 32 years later, in 2008.\nMajor league career.\nJoining the Brewers in September 1976, Thomas played 54 games for the Brewers in 1976 and 1977 as an outfielder and designated hitter. He had a career batting average of .274, an on-base percentage of .363, and a .457 slugging percentage.\nThe \"Sundown Kid\".\nThomas joined the Worldwide Church of God and began practicing strict Sabbath observance. When he arrived for spring training in 1977, he informed the Brewers that he would not play on the Sabbath, from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday. \"The Sundown Kid\", as he came to be called, missed a night game on Saturday, April 23, 1977, when he was slated to be in the lineup as cleanup hitter and left fielder, after having been excused from pre-sundown batting practice earlier in the day. Thomas said he heard on the radio that he was scheduled to play in the game and apologized to Brewers manager Alex Grammas.\nHe told \"People\" magazine, \"If I'm good at baseball, it's only because God gave me the talent. I'll give it all I've got, but I won't play on the Sabbath\". Thomas was also outspoken in criticizing pitchers who hit batters, saying, \"I think they ought to make a rule that if a guy gets hit and is able to get up, they should tie the pitcher's hands behind his back and let the hitter smack him in the face.\"\nEnd of his baseball career.\nAfter playing 22 games for the Brewers in 1977, Thomas was demoted on May 20 to the Spokane Indians, the Brewers' Triple-A Pacific Coast League farm team in Spokane, Washington, although his batting average with Milwaukee was a respectable .271. A \"Milwaukee Journal\" columnist, Bill Dwyer, wrote, \"No matter how tolerant and ecumenical Brewers' management wants to be, they are irked by having a player sit out two games a week.\" While playing for the Indians, Thomas agreed to a pay reduction of one day per week due to his missed Saturday games. His batting average declined considerably, however, and the Brewers announced his reassignment to their Eastern League Class AA affiliate in August. Thomas refused the demotion and did not play the remainder of the season, saying \"It's like they're asking me, 'Do you want to stay in the minor leagues the rest of your life? Conform or get out.'\" Brewers president Bud Selig said, \"It's just a tragic story. I know a lot of people are mad at us because of what they think we've done to him ... He's really a nice kid who wants to do the right thing.\"\nThomas was unsuccessful in his later attempts to rejoin the Brewers or sign with another major league baseball organization in 1978. He then played in Boise, Idaho, for the independent Boise Buckskins (predecessor of the Boise Hawks) in the short-season Northwest League, where he won the Class A league's batting title in 1978. In 1979, Thomas played for the Miami Amigos of the short-lived Inter-American League. Afterwards, Thomas quit baseball.\nPersonal life.\nThomas and his wife Judy had two children. The family lived near Spokane, where he had difficulty finding steady employment after baseball. He worked for a pool company for a time.\nThomas suffered from mental health problems beginning not long after his promotion to the major leagues. Thomas would later say that he \"couldn't take success\" and that he began to drink and take pills. While playing winter ball in Venezuela after the 1976 season, Thomas was hospitalized after overdosing on pills; he was flown back to Milwaukee for psychiatric care. According to a friend who lived with Thomas and his wife, Thomas knew that he had problems: \"Danny knew he wasn't right. He told us that. He once said to his wife, 'Judy, I wish I had cancer, then at least people would realize what was the matter with me.'\" In June 1980, Thomas was arrested in Mobile on a rape charge involving a 12-year-old girl.\nDeath.\nWhile in jail on the rape charge, Thomas committed suicide by hanging on June 12, 1980. His family was so impoverished by then that they were unable to afford funeral expenses or even remain in Alabama for his potter's field burial. After the outfielder's death, sports columnist John Blanchette of the Spokane \"Spokesman-Review\" described him as a \"troubled soul,\" saying, \"no one was more haunted than Danny Thomas.\""

An Australian Kangaroos and New South Wales Blues representative, he played for Western Suburbs between 1975 and 1984 in the New South Wales Rugby League premiership.\nPlaying career.\nDonnelly who was also commonly known by his nickname \"Dallas\", referring to his size, came from the New South Wales country town of Gunnedah, representing New South Wales and winning the award for \"country player of the year\" in 1973. He moved to Sydney's Western Suburbs club in 1975 and quickly gained a reputation that grew to almost cult status for his fiery on-field play as well as his off-field larrikin persona.\nWith Wests, Donnelly formed part of one of the most dominant forward packs in Australian Rugby League history under coach Roy Masters in the late 1970s, earning test selection for Australia in 1978 against New Zealand. By the 1980s however, he was plagued by increasing weight problems and constant suspensions, subsequently moving to English club Southend Invicta for the 1985–1986 seasons.\nDeath.\nDonnelly returned to Australia in 1986 immediately after his season in England, where he took on a position as captain/coach of the Byron Bay Red Devils in Group 18 of the Country Rugby League. However, Donnelly, who had epilepsy throughout his career, drowned after having a seizure while surfing at Byron Bay before the season began and died at the age of 31.\nAccolades.\nDonnelly was awarded life membership of the Western Suburbs Magpies after his ten-season career with the club. Former Wests coach and player Ron Watson said of Donnelly, \"I've seen a lot of players come through this club. I've never known anyone as popular as Dallas.\" Writer Alan Whiticker described Donnelly's career as being \"central to the heart of the Wests club.\"\nIn 2004, Donnelly was named at prop in the Western Suburbs Magpies Team of the Century."

        "text": "Butler National Golf Club is a private golf club located in Oak Brook, Illinois.\nHistory.\nButler National was the creation of Paul Butler, an affluent entrepreneur, philanthropist, and sportsman who was also the founder of the village of Oak Brook, Illinois.\nIn 1972, renowned golf course architect George Fazio designed Butler on what was previously York Country Club. It was built and seeded in the relatively short span of two years, and the construction was completed under the supervision of Fazio's nephew Tom Fazio, an internationally acclaimed architect in his own right.\nThis club was home to the PGA Tour's Western Open from 1974 to 1990. The course policy of not allowing female members caused the club to lose the Western Open.\nIn May 2007, \"Golf Digest\" rated Butler 21st of \"America's 100 Greatest Courses.\"\nCourse.\nButler National is a relatively flat, tree-lined course, requiring solid golf shots to shoot a good score. The Fazio design is penal and rewards successful positioning and shot shaping. A right to left ball flight is preferable as there are more dog leg lefts than rights. Water hazards will frequently come into play as do the deep faced bunkers. There are approximately 40 sand bunkers.\nThe Butler (back) tees play , with a course rating of 78.1 and slope rating of 155.\nIn the fall of 2004, all of the greens were converted to an A-1 Bent grass and the sand to tour grade signature. The greens are fast, but the difficulty comes in reading the greens as they are very subtle.\nMembership policy.\nButler National Golf Club is one of four all-male golf courses in the Chicago area, which is subject to criticism. Butler has not hosted a PGA or USGA tournament since 1990 due to their admissions policy, most notably missing the opportunity to host the US Open."

        "title": "Australian rugby league wooden spooners",
        "text": "The Australian rugby league wooden spooners are the team that finished last in the premier top-grade rugby league competition in Australia, which is currently the National Rugby League, and was previously the New South Wales Rugby Football League (1908-1994), the Australian Rugby League (1995-1997), and Super League (1997). Each of these seasons is considered to represent one continuous line of competition dating back from the first season in 1908. The wooden spoon is an unofficial award, however, fans often bring \"real\" wooden spoons to taunt opposition sides who are struggling on the bottom of the ladder.\nSince the Melbourne Storm's salary cap breach which saw them win the wooden spoon in the 2010 NRL season (more below), betting agencies have instead placed wagers on who would suffer the most losses in a single season, rather than win the wooden spoon itself.\nNRL Women's Premiership.\nBold teams indicate that the club still exists in the present competition.\nQueensland Cup.\nBold teams indicate that the club still exists in the present competition.\nReversing fortunes.\nWestern Suburbs were the only team to finish last in a season (1933) and then back up with a premiership in the following year. In season 2009 the Sydney Roosters finished last, winning just five games, however conjured a remarkable turnaround on and off the field to make the Grand final the following season. \nIn 2003, the Penrith Panthers won a premiership after finishing wooden spooners in 2001, and after finishing round 2 of the 2003 season in last place (15th). In the 2014 NRL season, the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks were the wooden spoon recipients. They went on to win the 2016 Premiership.\nAfter winning the 1942 premiership, Canterbury-Bankstown then crashed to last place in season 1943. After winning the 1952 premiership, Western Suburbs finished last in the season 1953. South Sydney went from minor premiers in 1989 to wooden spooners in 1990. \nIn 2010 the Melbourne Storm repeated this feat, albeit in unusual circumstances. The Storm then went on to win its first official minor premiership in the 2011 season, before finishing one game short of the Grand Final.\nAvoiding the spoon.\nAs of 2023, the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles have avoided the wooden spoon in their 74 completed seasons since entering the competition in 1947. They are the only current club from the pre-ARL era to have avoided the wooden spoon.\nThree other current clubs have also never claimed the wooden spoon: New Zealand Warriors (20), St. George Illawarra (25), and Dolphins (1).\nThe Balmain Tigers enjoyed a sixty-two season wooden spoon drought from 1911-1974, and St. George Dragons had gone 60 seasons (1939-1998) prior to the joint venture with the Illawarra Steelers\nSpoon Bowl.\nIn recent NRL seasons, the media had started to describe the matches between the two last placed sides as the \"Spoon Bowl\". One of the first instances the term being used was in 2011 when the Parramatta Eels and the Gold Coast Titans played against each other in the final match of the regular season with the loser receiving the wooden spoon. In 2014, the term was used again when Canberra played against Cronulla with both sides sitting on the bottom of the table. In 2015, Newcastle and Penrith played against each other in the third instance of the \"Spoon Bowl\" term to be used. In 2017, the Wests Tigers and Newcastle played in the fourth spoon bowl game with Wests defeating Newcastle and avoiding last place. In 2018, Parramatta who were in last place and Canterbury who were in second last faced off against each other in the fifth edition of the spoon bowl. There were fears before the match that it could have been the lowest crowd for an NRL game in 20 years. Parramatta went on to win the game 14-8. In Round 24 of the 2018 season, Parramatta played against North Queensland in the sixth edition of the spoon bowl. North Queensland won the match 44-6 in Townsville which was also Johnathan Thurston's final home game before retirement, the match was also Matt Scott's 250th game. The result ensured Parramatta finished with the wooden spoon, their 14th in total.\nIn round 24 of the 2022 NRL season, the Gold Coast who were second last on the table played against Newcastle who were third bottom in the Spoon Bowl match. The Gold Coast needed a win to ensure their survival from the wooden spoon whilst Newcastle could have mathematically still received it. The Gold Coast would win the match 36-26 ensuring the Wests Tigers would finish last for the first time in their 22-year history.\nIn round 21 of the 2023 NRL season, St. George Illawarra and the Wests Tigers contested the 8th edition of the spoon bowl match. St. George Illawarra were in second last place on the table just two points clear of Wests Tigers who were bottom of the ladder. St. George Illawarra would win the match 18-14 in a close contest."

Pocatello's teams since then have played in the Pioneer League. The Pocatello Cardinals, an affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals, played during the seasons of 1939–1942 and 1946–1951, as the league paused for three years during World War II. The Cardinals won two Pioneer League titles in 1942 and 1949.\nA new version of the Pocatello Bannocks started in 1952, originally as a St. Louis Browns affiliate for the first two years. In 1957, they changed their name to the Pocatello A's to reflect their new connection to the Kansas City Athletics, and then in 1960 to the Pocatello Giants as the San Francisco Giants took over as their affiliate. After a final season as the Pocatello Bannocks in 1961, they changed their name to the Pocatello Chiefs in 1962 and remained under that name until they moved to Ogden, Utah, to become the Ogden Dodgers in 1966. Hall of Fame manager Tommy Lasorda managed the Chiefs in 1965.\nIn 1984, baseball returned to Pocatello for two seasons, when the Lethbridge Dodgers relocated as the Pocatello Gems. This was the same team that had left in 1966.\nThe Pocatello Giants were affiliated with the San Francisco Giants for the 1988 and 1989 seasons; prior affiliation was with the Oakland A's. The home stadium was Halliwell Park, located on Alameda Drive. After the 1989 season the Giants ended their farm team affiliation with the franchise. The franchise became an independent/co-op team and was renamed the Gate City Pioneers for the 1990 season; that team featured players from the Montreal Expos and Chicago White Sox farm systems as well as minor league players from the Hiroshima Toyo Carp of the Nippon Professional Baseball. For the 1991 season, the team changed its name to the Pocatello Pioneers. The franchise to relocated to Lethbridge, Alberta, where they became the Lethbridge Mounties.\nPocatello gained one more team in 1993, when the Salt Lake City Trappers - forced out by the move of a Class AAA Pacific Coast League team to the city - moved to town as the Pocatello Posse in 1993. After the 1993 season, the team moved to Ogden, Utah, to become the Ogden Raptors. \nA new team, the Gate City Grays, was formed in 2014 as part of the Northern Utah League. They were undefeated in their first regular season and won the league championship the next two seasons. The Grays are a semi-professional team not associated with MLB. Games are played at Halliwell Park."

He progressed up the ranking list between 2005 and 2007, jumping 30 places. His consistency was epitomised in 2006 as he lost his opening match in just one of the seven ranking events and had his best result in Aberdeen at the Royal London Watches Grand Prix when he reached the last 16 before losing to the eventual winner, Neil Robertson. In 2009, he was ranked 75 in the World Rankings, however, since then he fell out of the top 100. In May 2011, he won a qualifying game at the 2011 Q School to regain his tour card for the 2011–12 season.\nNorman would need to win four qualifying matches to reach the main draws of the ranking events in the new season. He came closest to doing so in the first two events of the year, the Australian Goldfields Open and the Shanghai Masters, where on both occasions he won two matches before losing in the third qualifying round. His performances throughout the season were not enough to see him enter the top 64 in the world rankings who retain their places for the 2012–13 season and dropped off the main tour.\nNorman could only enter Players Tour Championship events in the 2012/2013 season. He took part in 10 of them with his best finish coming in the European Tour Event 1 in Germany where he beat Ben Harrison, Nigel Bond, Phil Barnes and top 16 player Ricky Walden, before losing to Joe Swail 3–4 in the quarter-finals. It was this result which largely contributed to him finishing 57th on the Order of Merit to claim one of the eight spots on offer to players not on the main tour for the next season.\nNorman did not win a match at the venue of a full ranking event during the 2013–14 season. He played in seven of the eight European Tour tournaments with his best results being three last 32 defeats to be placed 60th on the Order of Merit and 110th in the world rankings. Norman won only one match during the 2014–15 season, and following a 10–2 loss against Tom Ford at the 2015 World Championship qualifiers he decided to retire from professional snooker to concentrate on his coaching work at the South West Snooker Academy."

It hosts the ATP Buenos Aires, an ATP Tour tournament played on clay. The club is a founding member of the Argentine Tennis Association, established 2 September 1921, along with Quilmes, Ferrocarril del Sud, GEBA, Lomas, Belgrano, Ferro Carril Oeste, and Estudiantes BA and 12 other institutions.\nIts main stadium court, Horacio Billoch Caride Stadium, has a capacity of 5,500. It was named after former club president Horacio Billoch Caride, who is considered one of the most notable tennis executives and who also presided over the Argentine Tennis Association. The stadium has hosted numerous Davis Cup and Fed Cup events.\nHistory.\nThe first recorded plans for a tennis club in Buenos Aires can be found on a letter sent by Arthur Herbert, W. H. Watson, Adrián Penard, C.R. Thursby, H. M. Mills, and F. E. Wallace, who proposed the idea to the British community living in Argentina. At the first meeting, held in the British Consulate, Penard offered land he owned on Alvear and Callao Avenues, and suggested the name \"Alvear Lawn Tennis Club\".\nWhen the initiative received approval from other members, they formed a committee, which concluded that the Alvear Avenue would accommodate only two courts. As a result, they chose a parcel at Vicente López and Ayacucho Streets, owned by Federico Leloir. The club was officially founded on April 19, with Arthur Herbert as president. With the money earned from fees, the club built four courts, a clothing shop, and other facilities.\nWhen members of the Rosario Lawn Tennis Club in Rosario, Santa Fe heard about the new club in Buenos Aires, they suggested a match between eight players from both cities. The match, the first held at BALTC, was held on June 29, 1892.\nAs BALTC's membership and activities increased, it decided to move to a bigger place. After considering several locations, the committee was granted concession for land adjacent to Central Argentine Railway's golf course (now Lisandro de la Torre). After the land was reconditioned, the club built four courts there. The new facilities were inaugurated on June 12, 1920, and the club has remained there since.\nStadium.\nBALTC's stadium and main court is Horacio Billoch Caride Stadium, with a capacity of 5,500. Since 2003, the club has also hosted an exhibition tournament, \"La copa Argentina de tenis Peugeot\" (Peugeot Argentina Tennis Cup). Held each December, it features top tour players. During the event, the stadium's surface is hard court instead of the usual clay.\nIn 2015, there was a proposal to rename the Billoch Caride Stadium to Guillermo Vilas Stadium, to honor the best Argentine player ever, who began his career at BALTC at 15 years old. Vilas also debuted for the Argentine team that competed with Chile in the South American zone of the 1970 Davis Cup, which was held in BALTC. However, the initiative did not succeed.\nIn 2018, BALTC was the venue for all the tennis tournaments at the 2018 Youth Olympic Games, first time the court hosted an Olympic competition."

In 1868 Walter Bradford Woodgate arranged for his Brasenose cox to jump overboard at the start of the race to lighten his boat. While the unwanted cox narrowly escaped strangulation by the water lilies, Woodgate and his home-made steering device triumphed by 100 yards and were promptly disqualified. Whatever passing fame the hapless cox gained on the Henley reach in 1868 was eventually eclipsed by his accomplishments in later life when he, Frederic Edward Weatherly, wrote and published the Irish ballad \"Danny Boy\".\nA special prize for four-oared crews without coxswains was offered at the regatta in 1869 when it was won by the Oxford Radleian Club. When Stewards' became a coxless race in 1873, Woodgate \"won his moral victory\", the Rowing Almanack later recalled. \"Nothing but defeating a railway in an action at law could have given him so much pleasure.\""

The trophy was designed and created by Hector Miller and was presented by Imperial College London - the 2004 winners. It is named after Prince Albert who became the first Royal Patron of the Regatta in 1851 and was also closely associated with the origins of Imperial College.

        "text": "The men's sprint event was part of the track cycling programme at the 1920 Summer Olympics. There were 37 competitors from 11 nations, with each nation apparently limited to four cyclists (down from 12 the last time the event was held, in 1908). The event was won by Maurice Peeters of the Netherlands, the nation's first victory in the men's sprint. Two British cyclists, Thomas Johnson and Harry Ryan, were in the final as well, taking silver and bronze.\nSummary.\nOne day before the Olympic tournament, Peeters had become amateur world champion in track cycling. One day later he rode the Olympic 1000 m sprint, and of course he was considered a favourite. He lost in the first round, but his second place was enough to progress to the next round. He then won the quarter final and the semi-final. In the final, he rode against two British cyclists, Harry Ryan and Tiny Johnson. They tried to make use of their numerical advantage, and Ryan attacked, so that Peeters had to get him back. In the final corner, Johnson tried to come around the corner to win the race, but Peeters was ahead and kept his lead. The British team protested the race, arguing that Peeters had obstructed Johnson by forcing him up the bank, but the protest was denied.\nBackground.\nThis was the fourth appearance of the event, which has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1904 and 1912. None of the finalists from 1908 returned. Peeters was the favorite.\nAustralia, Denmark, and Luxembourg each made their debut in the men's sprint. France made its fourth appearance, the only nation to have competed at every appearance of the event. For the first time, Germany did not compete in the men's sprint, having been excluded from the 1920 Games after World War I.\nCompetition format.\nUnlike modern sprint events (which use a flying 200 metre time trial to cut down and seed the field, followed by one-on-one matches), the 1920 sprint used a competition format featuring four main rounds and a two-round repechage. \nThere were 12 first-round heats, mostly with three cyclists each but one with four. The top two in each heat advanced to the quarterfinals. The 24 quarterfinalists were divided into eight heats of three cyclists each; the winner of each quarterfinal advanced directly to the semifinals while the other two cyclists competed in the repechage. There were four repechage semifinals of four cyclists each, with the winner of each heat advancing to the repechage final. The four repechage finalists competed in a single heat, with the winner joining the eight quarterfinal winners in the semifinals. There were three semifinals of three cyclists each, with the winners advancing to the three-man final.\nRecords.\nThe records for the sprint are 200 metre flying time trial records, kept for the qualifying round in later Games as well as for the finish of races.\nThomas Johnson matched the Olympic record in heat 6, as did Gerald Halpin in heat 12. Halpin matched it again in quarterfinal 2. Johnson broke the record in the fifth quarterfinal, recording 11.8 seconds for the final 200 metres. \nAlbert White, Harry Ryan (cyclist), and Maurice Peeters also tied the old record, but after Johnson had set a new one.\nResults.\nRepechage.\nRepechage semifinals.\nRepechage semifinal 1.\nYoung finished first, but had cut off Bellivier and was penalized by dropping him to second place, eliminating him and allowing Bellivier to advance."

        "title": "Marty Bergen (baseball)",
        "text": "Martin Bergen (October 25, 1871 – January 19, 1900) was an American professional baseball player who murdered his family before slicing his own throat. From 1896 to 1899 he played in 344 games with the Boston Beaneaters of Major League Baseball, 337 of them as their catcher. Bergen helped the Beaneaters to National League pennants in 1897 and 1898, as well as a second-place finish in 1899.\nA 2001 \"Sports Illustrated\" article described him as \"a nimble fielder with a bullwhip arm who could snap the ball to second base without so much as moving his feet\". In 1900, future Hall of Fame outfielder Jesse Burkett characterized Bergen as the best catcher in baseball history. He received a few Hall of Fame votes in 1937–1939, though not nearly enough to be elected.\nBergen appeared to have a mental illness. By 1899, he experienced hallucinations, had to be removed from a game due to odd behavior, and walked off from the team train during a trip to Boston. On January 19, 1900, he killed his wife and two children before dying by suicide.\nEarly life.\nMartin Bergen was born to parents Michael and Ann on October 25, 1871, in North Brookfield, Massachusetts. His parents were Irish immigrants who had arrived in the United States just after the Civil War. Michael made an income for the family by making shoes at a local factory. Martin was the third of six children, all girls except for him and the youngest, Bill.\nWhile still just a teenager, Marty was playing baseball for a local team, the Brookfields. One of his teammates was Connie Mack, who would later manage the Philadelphia Athletics for 50 years. Recognized as a great fielder, Bergen tended to obsess about minor problems and displayed an argumentative personality, traits that negatively affected his enjoyment of the game.\nMinor league career (1892–1895).\nBergen's professional baseball career started in 1892, when he served as the catcher for the Salem Witches of the New England League. He played 59 games for them, batting .247. Following their season, he returned to play some games for the Brookfields, a practice he would continue in subsequent years. He spent most of the 1893 season with a team in Northampton, though he also played three games for the Wilkes-Barre Coal Barons of the Eastern League. On July 11, still in the midst of the season, he married Hattie Gaines, who had moved to North Brookfield a year before to work at a flour mill. The couple had three children: Martin Jr., Florence, and Joseph. They kept their permanent residence in North Brookfield, purchasing real estate on Boynton Street, which they named Snowball Farm.\nIn 1894, Mack became the manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates of the National League (NL). He tried to draft Bergen, but the contract was voided when the Pirates assigned the catcher to a minor league team, a practice which major league teams were not allowed to do at the time. The minor league team was Lewiston of the New England League, for whom Bergen played even though he was no longer under contract with Pittsburgh. Playing 97 games, Bergen batted .321.\nTeams at higher levels were interested in Bergen again in 1895. This time, they were the Washington Senators of the NL (major league) and the Kansas City Blues of the Western League (minor league), both of which drafted him. Baseball officials sent him to the Blues, where he had a strong performance in 1895. However, his moody behavior caused trouble. In the middle of the season, Bergen left the Blues suddenly over a perceived slight and did not return until over a week had passed. Nevertheless, he played 138 games for the club, batting .372 with 118 runs scored and 188 hits. Kid Nichols, who was from Kansas City, recommended the player to Frank Selee, manager of the Boston Beaneaters. The team drafted him and looked forward to employing him for 1896, though team owner Arthur Soden had to go to North Brookfield to assure Bergen he was wanted and valued by his new club.\nBoston Beaneaters (1896–1899).\nWith the Beaneaters, Bergen became one of the two main catchers for the ballclub in 1896, alongside Charlie Ganzel. Bergen made his first major league appearance on April 17 in a 7–3 loss to the Phillies at the Philadelphia Baker Bowl. Catching 65 games for the Beaneaters in his rookie season (18 more appearances than Ganzel), he batted .269 with 39 runs scored, 66 hits, four home runs, and 47 runs batted in (RBI). His team finished fourth in the NL.\nIn 1897, Bergen received a greater share of the catching duties, playing 87 games to Ganzel's 30; a third catcher, Fred Lake, only made 19 appearances. Bergen batted .248 with 47 runs scored, 81 hits, two home runs, and 45 RBI. With a record of 93–39, the Beaneaters won the NL pennant after a three-year absence. They then faced the Baltimore Orioles in the Temple Cup, an 1890s series that pitted the first-place NL team against the second-place NL team in a best-of-seven postseason series to determine the league champion. Despite having the better record, the Beaneaters lost the series four games to one.\nThe 1898 season saw Bergen set a number of career highs. He played in 125 games, catching 117 of them; backup George Yeager only caught 37. Bergen batted .280 with 62 runs scored, 125 hits, three home runs, and 60 RBI. The Beaneaters won the NL pennant for the second year in a row, facing no challenge for the championship this year, as 1897 was the last year of the Temple Cup. Nichols credited Bergen with helping the team win: \"Baltimore beat us the next three years, after we lost (catcher Charlie) Bennett. Then we got Marty Bergen from Kansas City and won the pennants again in 1897 and 1898.\"\nBergen had been troubled by right hip issues throughout his career, and on January 28, 1899, he had surgery to address an abscess on the hip. That season, he only played 72 games, with Boileryard Clarke (60) and Billy Sullivan (22) also chipping in. He batted .258 with 32 runs scored, 67 hits, one home run, and 34 RBI. Though there were rumors that he broke his hip during the year, evidence suggests otherwise. Bergen played all nine innings of the team's second-to-last game of the year on October 13 and did not mention a broken hip in a visit to his doctor after the season. The Beaneaters had a 95–57 record but finished second in the NL this time, behind the Brooklyn Superbas. \"The Sandusky Star\" and \"The Bangor Daily Whig and Courier\" pinned the blame for the second-place finish on a rift that had developed between the sullen Bergen and his teammates. For years, Andrew Freedman, owner of the New York Giants, had been interested in acquiring the catcher in a trade, and most people within the game of baseball believed Bergen would be a Giant in 1900.\nOver four seasons, Bergen played in 344 major league games for the Beaneaters, 337 of which came at the catcher position. He had a career batting average of .265 with 180 runs scored, 339 hits, 69 extra base hits, 10 home runs, and 176 RBI.\nDefensive prowess.\nBergen's defensive skills helped him earn a reputation as one of, if not the best, catchers in the NL during his tenure. He exhibited a strong arm and quick reflexes, which helped him throw out baserunners. Mack said Bergen was the only catcher he ever saw remain on his knees to throw a player out at second. William Nack of \"Sports Illustrated\" wrote in 2001 that Bergen was \"a nimble fielder with a bullwhip arm who could snap the ball to second base without so much as moving his feet.\" Although catchers in his day did not wear shin guards, Bergen was particularly skilled at blocking the plate when a runner was trying to score from third. This involved him in several collisions, none of which seriously injured him.\nFuture Hall of Famer Jesse Burkett remembered Bergen's skills with high praise in 1900: \"As a catcher, Martin Bergen was the best the world ever produced. No man acted with more natural grace as a ballplayer. There was finish in every move he made. His eye was always true, and his movements so quick and accurate in throwing that the speediest base runners [...] never took chances when Bergen was behind the bat.\" The infielders that played with him spoke glowingly of his abilities. Said second baseman Bobby Lowe, \"Bergen's throws were always strong and very rarely, if ever, sailed. He positioned himself behind the plate as well as any catcher I have ever seen.\" Wrote a sportswriter in 1898, \"Martin Bergen is a kingpin of catchers, and without him the Bostons would be probably in second place or even lower down the ladder.\"\nMental illness.\nBergen's teammates appreciated his strong arm and hustling style of play, but relations between the catcher and the team soured quickly. An article from May 1896 related how \"Martin Bergen, the young backstop [...] is unpopular with his fellow players on the Boston team. Bergen is a sullen, sarcastic chap, never associates with the players, and always nurses a fancied grievance. His disposition handicaps his playing talents.\" While the team was on a road trip to St. Louis in 1898, Bergen slapped teammate Vic Willis while the ballclub was eating breakfast. He threatened to club his teammates to death at the end of the year. The team's mixed emotions were expressed by an anonymous Boston player quoted in the press: \"He has made trouble with a good many of the boys and we just give him a wide berth. But he's a ballplayer, and once we get into a game, personal feelings are set aside in admiration of the artist, for such he is.\"\nBergen's condition worsened in 1899, which led to internal turmoil for the Beaneaters. His January hip surgery took over four hours, and he seemed different mentally afterwards. He was having hallucinations that enemies were trying to poison him. The Beaneaters started the year by playing 16 of their first 17 games on the road; in the midst of this trip, while they were playing the Senators in Washington on April 24, Bergen found out that Martin Jr. had died of diphtheria. Soden and manager Frank Selee granted him time off until he felt recovered enough to rejoin the team; Bergen was back with the club after two weeks. Though his teammates tried to welcome him back, Bergen continued to clash with them, imagining that they were making jokes behind his back about the death. He began sitting sideways and walking in a particular manner so that he could spot assassins approaching from either side of him. Boston's team president urged the other players to avoid Bergen, fearing what he might do. Some blamed his condition on heavy drink, but Bergen was regarded by others as a teetotaler.\nOn July 20, 1899, Bergen silently walked off the team's train at the beginning of a road trip, returning to North Brookfield and leaving Boston with just a backup catcher (Clarke) during a heated pennant race. \"Boston Globe\" reporter Tim Murnane journeyed to North Brookfield to convince Bergen to come back; the catcher complained that his teammates were mistreating him, that Selee would not give him time off to be with his family, and that he was battling injuries that could only be dealt with by his local physician, Dr. Louis Dionne. A week and a half later, he rejoined the team, receiving lusty cheers from the fans. In September, Bergen disappeared again for a few days, then showed up unannounced a few minutes before a game and put on his catching gear without speaking to anyone. On October 9, Bergen had to be removed from a game when he dodged the pitches rather than catching them, claiming that he was preoccupied with avoiding knife thrusts from an invisible assailant. Bergen was aware of his mental state, and actively sought help from both clergy and physicians. However, he refused to take any of the bromides prescribed by his doctor, explaining, \"I thought someone in the National League had found out that you were my family physician and had arranged to give me some poison. I did not take it from my wife because I didn't wish hers to be the hand that poisoned me.\"\nKaense, Spahn, and Johnson's 2004 book on the Boston Braves recounts that, after Bergen's son's death, the player \"would catch a few games, then ask Selee if he could return home for a few days.\" When Selee refused permission, Bergen would go home anyway. Bergen complained that players kept reminding him of his son who had died, and he resented a $300 fine imposed for being AWOL. \"Black moods came on Bergen who seemed to be happy only when on his farm in North Brookfield.\" Most of his teammates were avoiding him completely by the end of the year, and several players said they would not return to the Beaneaters in 1900 if the increasingly erratic Bergen was still with the club.\nDeath.\nIn January 1900, at his home in North Brookfield, Massachusetts, the 28-year-old Bergen was found dead in a murder–suicide. Neighbors expressed shock and said they saw no warning signs. Several had seen him before the tragedy unfolded, and recalled him as \"unusually cheerful\" and \"pleasant\" when conversing with them. The neighbors also told reporters how devoted he always seemed to his wife. The medical examiner reported that Bergen killed his wife and two children with an axe, then used a straight razor to forcefully cut his own throat. Bergen's father discovered the bodies. According to \"The New York Times\":\nIn actuality, the razor cut likely would not have been able to sever enough ligaments to go deep enough to nearly sever Bergen's head, but it would have created a lot of blood from slicing the jugular vein and carotid artery, making it appear that the head had been nearly severed from the body.\nFollowing Bergen's death, media outlets reported that he had been subject to \"fits of melancholy\" and had \"showed signs of insanity\" in the fall of 1899. After examining contemporary accounts, the Harvard Medical School's Dr. Carl Salzman felt that Bergen likely had schizophrenia with possible manic depression. Baseball historian Frank Russo wrote, \"If he were alive today, he most surely would be diagnosed with some sort of clinical depression or perhaps borderline personality disorder,\" adding that he was showing strong signs of schizophrenia in late 1899.\nBergen and his wife and children were buried at Saint Joseph's Cemetery on Bell Street in North Brookfield; his grave remained unmarked for several years. In 1934, Mack and George M. Cohan, both of whom had ties to North Brookfield, helped raise funds to erect a granite memorial to Bergen. The inscription reads: \"In memory of Martin Bergen, 1871–1900. Member of the Boston National League Club. Erected in appreciation of his contribution to American's national game.\" Bergen received a few Hall of Fame votes in 1937–39, though not nearly enough to be elected. Sportswriter Joe Posnanski mentioned this when he argued that the Hall of Fame needs to strike the character clause from its membership requirements.\nThe death of Bergen prevented him from ever playing against his brother Bill, who was also a major league catcher for the Cincinnati Reds and the Brooklyn Superbas from 1901 to 1911. Several years after the murder–suicide, Bill reminisced to a reporter about his brother. \"It was as if he was possessed. The demons got to him and never let him go.\""

        "text": "A swimming pool service technician is a person who maintains swimming pools, including keeping the water clean and safe by fixing pool equipment such as pumps, motors and water filters.\nDescription.\nPool and spa service technicians provide services in the swimming pool and spa industry. There are various national trade associations in the United States that offer memberships in these services, including the Pool &amp; Hot Tub Alliance, the Independent Pool And Spa Service Association, Inc. and the United Pool Association. Certification can be obtained through various organizations, including the National Swimming Pool Foundation.\nThere are approximately 15 million residential pools and spas in the United States, and about 400,000 commercial and public swimming pools. The two service industry trade organizations boast of having about 15,000 members. These workers generally clean either residential or commercial swimming pools. Not all pool service professionals are members of these organizations, and many residential pool owners clean their own pools.\nAccording to the National Swimming Pool Foundation, which has certified hundreds of thousands of pool service operators with its Certified Pool Operators course, only 26 states require that operators of public or commercial pools be properly trained and certified. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has published guidance to \"help ensure healthy and safe experiences in public pools\" in reports called the Model Aquatic Health Code. \nAn automated pool cleaner can also be used to clean some pools.\nVarious Roles.\nThe swimming pool service technician industry has various jobs that extend beyond cleaning and sanitizing. Swimming pool service technicians are required to have an understanding of basic water chemistry readings, such as chlorine, pH, alkalinity, stabilizer, and salt levels. Additionally, they must have knowledge in maintaining and repairing pool and spa equipment, including filters, pumps, chlorinators, heaters, pool lights, and automation systems and are also responsible for maintaining safety by ensuring that diving boards, water slides, and other pool accessories are in safe working condition.\nAnother aspect of repairing or installing pool equipment is setting up automation systems. This includes running high and low voltage wires from a main breaker box to a separate automation panel where that electricity is then sent to the various pool equipment. Communication wire is also sent to the equipment to switch them on and off via the automation motherboard. \nPay scale.\nThe average swimming pool technician hourly pay rate in the United States is $17.30.\n This figure may vary depending on many factors, including the employer, location and worker's expertise.\nPopular culture.\nA swimming pool service technician is the title character of the \"Seinfeld\" episode \"The Pool Guy\".\nThere has also been an episode of Saturday Night Live called \"Pool Boy\", depicting a swimming pool service technician, played by comedian Pete Davidson. \nIn Legally Blonde, a pool boy named Enrique Salvatore (played by Greg Serano) is a key witness in the trial at the center of the movie.

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball career on-base percentage leaders",
        "text": "In baseball statistics, on-base percentage (OBP) is a measure of how often a batter reaches base for any reason other than a fielding error, fielder's choice, dropped or uncaught third strike, fielder's obstruction, or catcher's interference. OBP is calculated in Major League Baseball (MLB) by dividing the sum of hits, walks, and times hit by a pitch by the sum of at-bats, walks, times hit by pitch and sacrifice flies. A hitter with a .400 on-base percentage is considered to be great and rare; only 61 players in MLB history with at least 3,000 career plate appearances (PA) have maintained such an OBP. Left fielder Ted Williams, who played 19 seasons for the Boston Red Sox, has the highest career on-base percentage, .4817, in MLB history. Williams led the American League (AL) in on-base percentage in twelve seasons, the most such seasons for any player in the major leagues. Barry Bonds led the National League (NL) in ten seasons, a NL record. Williams also posted the then-highest single-season on-base percentage of .5528 in 1941, a record that stood for 61 years until Bonds broke it with a .5817 OBP in 2002. Bonds broke his own record in 2004, setting the current single-season mark of .6094.\nPlayers are eligible for the Hall of Fame if they have played at least 10 major league seasons, have been either retired for five seasons or deceased for six months, and have not been banned from MLB. These requirements leave 6 living players ineligible who have played in the past 5 seasons; 5 players (Bill Joyce, Ferris Fain, Jake Stenzel, Bill Lange, and George Selkirk) who did not play 10 seasons in MLB; and Shoeless Joe Jackson, who was banned for his role in the Black Sox Scandal."

He is a , center. González has dual Argentine and Italian citizenship.\nProfessional career.\nGonzález is widely reputed to be a globetrotter, as he cannot settle with a team for a long period of time. González has played in the following leagues: Argentine First Division, Argentine Second Division, Bolivian League, Uruguayan League, Italian Second Division, Spanish Second Division, Saudi Arabian League, Venezuelan League, and the Dominican Republic League. Having started his career in 1996, González debuted in Argentina with Gimnasia y Esgrima Comodoro Rivadavia, averaging 2.6 points per game in 7 games. Continuing with Gimnasia in the 1997–98 season, he only averaged 0.8 points per game in 28 games. In 1998, González signed with San Andres of the TNA League (Argentine Second Division), where he played until 2000.\nGonzález signed with Libertad de Sunchales in August 2000. There he went on to win several honors with that team, including one South American Championship in 2002, averaging 11.1 points in 49 games. In 2002, González had a short spell in the Bolivian League club Real Santa Cruz, but he made a comeback to Libertad for the 2002–03 season; averaging 20.2 points in 20 games played. However, González left Libertad in 2003, due to an undisciplined record. He signed with the Uruguayan League club Aguada BC in March 2003, where he averaged 19.3 points per game in 16 games. Therefore, he was regarded as one of the best players in the Uruguayan League in 2003, along with his fellow Argentine national basketball team teammate Paolo Quinteros.\nLater that year, González signed a contract with the Basket Crabs Rimini of the Italian Second Division. It was the first time González played in Europe. There too, he was successful with his team, averaging 11.3 points in 35 games in 2003-04 and 14.8 points in 33 games in the 2004–05 season. González helped Rimini to reach the quarterfinals of the league both seasons. González, having claimed that he had declined the chance to continue in Italy, left the team after the 2004–5 season; and returned to Argentina.\nGonzález debuted with Argentino Atletico de Junin in September 2005. In 44 games he averaged 18.1 points per game. His performance in that team was stellar, as he led Argentino de Junin to a second-place finish at the 2005 Super 8 Tournament (for Argentine clubs). He was one of the best players on the team and in turn he named was the MVP of that year's Super 8 competition.\n2006 was a roundabout year for González, as he played for five different clubs during that year.\nNational team career.\nGonzález is also a member of the senior men's Argentine national basketball team. With Argentina's senior national team, he won silver medals at both the 2005 FIBA Americas Championship and the 2007 FIBA Americas Championship. He also won bronze medals at both the 2008 Olympic Basketball Tournament and the 2009 FIBA Americas Championship.\nPersonal.\nGonzález was born in Lanús, but when he was young, he moved to Puerto Madryn, and then to Punta Alta. He played for some time with Manu Ginóbili in Bahiense del Norte. He is married to Raxanne, with whom he has two children.\nHis son is also named Román. He has vacationed in the Dominican Republic."

        "text": "Ronald Bernard Francis (born April 7, 1964) is an American former professional football player who was a cornerback in the National Football League (NFL) for the Dallas Cowboys. He played college football for the Baylor Bears.\nEarly years.\nFrancis was one of the best state running backs at La Marque High School as a senior, receiving All-district honors. He played as a quarterback, wingback and safety in the previous years. He also practiced track.\nHe accepted a football scholarship from Baylor University. As a freshman, he was moved from running back to cornerback, starting 4 games while making 23 tackles and 6 passes defensed. In 1983, he was declared academically ineligible.\nIn 1984 as a sophomore, he was moved back to tailback and named the starter. He averaged 95.6 yards per game with three 100-yard efforts before suffering a pulled hamstring in the sixth game. He was also used as the short yardage quarterback. He finished with 127 carries for 558 yards (led the team), 5 rushing touchdowns, 12 receptions for 119 yards and 2 receiving touchdowns.\nAs a junior, he was moved again to cornerback, where he teamed with Thomas Everett to form one of the best defensive secondaries in college football. He posted 64 tackles, 6 interceptions (led the conference) and 12 passes defensed. He made 2 interceptions and a career-high eight tackles against the SWC champion Texas A&amp;M University. In 1985, the defense ranked number 3 in the nation against the pass and he was named Southwest Conference defensive player of the year.\nIn 1986, the defense ranked third overall in the nation, with him recording 8 interceptions (led the conference), 2 fumbles recoveries and 11 passes defensed. He had a career-high 3 interceptions against the University of Texas.\nFrancis was a standout player in one of the school's most successful eras, as the Bears won 30 games and appeared in three Bowl games (2 wins). He was a two-time All-SWC selection and an honorable-mention All American. He finished with 14 interceptions and 29 passes defensed. In limited duty as a return man, he averaged 8.9 yards on 9 punt returns and 16.7 yards on 3 kickoff returns.\nIn 2017, he was inducted into the Baylor Athletics Hall of Fame.\nProfessional career.\nDallas Cowboys.\nHe was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the second round (39th overall) of the 1987 NFL draft. After the team traded cornerback Ron Fellows, Francis became the first rookie in 6 years to open the season as a starter for the team. He registered 48 tackles, 2 interceptions (one returned for a touchdown), 12 passes defensed (second on the team), 2 fumble recoveries (tied for the team lead).\nIn 1988, he entered the season as the starter at right cornerback, before dislocating his left shoulder during an intrasquad game in pre-season. The injury forced him to miss 2 months and allowed former Baylor teammate Robert Williams to win the starting position outright. Francis returned in the third game and would play as the third cornerback on passing situations. He collected 25 tackles, one interception and 7 passes defensed.\nIn 1989, Williams suffered a sprained knee in the third game against the Washington Redskins, opening the door for Francis to regain the starting position. In the fourth game against the New York Giants he tallied one interception. The next game against the Green Bay Packers he had a career-high 10 tackles and one pass defensed. After Williams returned to the lineup, they split time at cornerback until the fourteenth game against the Philadelphia Eagles, when he had 2 passes defensed during extended action in the second half. He started the last 2 games of the season. He posted 34 tackles, one interception (tied for second on the team) and 10 passes defensed (tied for the team lead).\nIn 1990, he returned to a backup role, appearing in 15 games.\nNew England Patriots.\nFrancis was traded to the New England Patriots on February 19, 1991. In exchange for the first overall draft pick of the 1991 NFL draft (Russell Maryland), he was traded to the Patriots along with linebacker Eugene Lockhart, linebacker David Howard, a 1991 first round pick (#11 Pat Harlow) and a 1991 second round pick (#41 Jerome Henderson). He was waived on August 26.\nBC Lions.\nIn 1992, he was signed by the BC Lions of the Canadian Football League. He appeared in 9 games, making 20 tackles, 2 fumble recoveries and one sack. The next year, he appeared in 2 games.\nPersonal life.\nHis brother James Francis played linebacker in the NFL for the Cincinnati Bengals."

        "text": "Sport Lisboa e Benfica (), commonly known as Benfica, is a professional basketball team based in Lisbon, Portugal, that plays in the Liga Portuguesa de Basquetebol (LPB), where they are the current champions. Founded in 1927, it is the senior representative side of the basketball section of multi-sports club S.L. Benfica.\nIn June 2007, the club decided to leave the professional top league, then known as LCB, and join the Proliga, a league organized by the Portuguese Basketball Federation. From 2008 onwards, they returned to the LPB after the federation took over the realms of the competition.\nBenfica is the most successful Portuguese club, having the record for most championships (29), cups (23), league cups (12), super cups (15), and other national competitions plus the Supertaça da Lusofonia, totalling 85 trophies. It is also the Portuguese team that advanced the furthest in the European top club championship, now known as EuroLeague.\nSome of their most memorable moments were European victories against clubs that have won the Euroleague, such as Virtus Bologna, Real Madrid, Cantù, Cibona, Joventut Badalona, Panathinaikos, Partizan, CSKA Moscow, and Varese.\nAlong with its several youth teams, which play in their respective top division championships, Benfica also has a developmental basketball team, Benfica B, that plays in the Proliga, the second highest tier in Portugal.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nCreated on 20 March 1927, the basketball team followed the steps of many other sports that were supported by the club, achieving great success almost immediately. The team established itself as a main contender by the 1940s and during the whole 1960s gained the status of championship favourite and was already the club with the most titles won. By this time the club had won eight national championships and eight cups. This dominating spell decreased the following decade until the early 1980s. In this time-span Benfica could only win two championships, in the 1969–70 and the 1974–75 season, but won four national cups, the second most prestigious Portuguese tournament, in 1969–70, 1971–72, 1972–73 and 1973–74. After these years, Benfica again dominated the national scene.\nGolden years.\nThe most successful period of the club was between 1985 and 1995. In eleven seasons, the team won ten national titles, seven of which in a row, five national cups, five league cups and six super cups, achieving the best season ever by a Portuguese basketball team in 1994–95 winning the Portuguese League, Portuguese League Cup, Portuguese Super Cup, Portuguese Basketball Cup and finishing the European Champions' Cup in the Top 16. One of the highlight from that European Champions' Cup season was a 22-point victory (102–80) against CSKA Moscow in Lisbon on 12 January 1995. Benfica also made successful international campaigns in the other seasons considering the budget the team had compared with other European big teams. Some of the most successful of those campaigns include the 1993–94, when Benfica was close to reach the Top 8, and for a third season in a row Benfica managed to reach the Top 16 again in the European Champions' Cup, in 1995–96, grabbing a win against Panathinaikos, the eventual champions.\nDecline in the late 1990s.\nThis period was followed by a dark era in which Benfica was internally overshadowed by Ovarense, Portugal Telecom and FC Porto. Even though this period is considered to be a dark one, Benfica did manage to reach the LPB final once as well as winning Super Cups and finishing runners-up in the national cup and in the league cup. Also noteworthy is an away win against Real Madrid, in the 1996–97 EuroCup, the same season the Spaniards won the competition. The team finally decided to withdraw from the top tier and applied for the second league, the Proliga, which was the highest division run by the Federação Portuguesa de Basquetebol. However the first division was folded and the LPB (league) was again being overviewed by the national federation. This allowed the team to make a comeback to the main league.\nRevival in the late 2000s.\nAfter more than a decade without any titles and in the same season Benfica had made a return to the first league, the 2008–09 season, the team won the Portuguese League, with a perfect score of 100% wins during the regular season, becoming the second team in the world to do so, after Maccabi Tel Aviv in the 1970s, and thrashing Ovarense 4–0 in the best-of-four game final. Benfica won the championship again the following season with a 91% winning record in the regular stage and a 4–1 final against Porto. The recent success brought the team to participate in the EuroChallenge, thus marking the end of a mid-term long hiatus from Portuguese clubs in European basketball competitions. The following year, Benfica won the League Cup and the Super Cup but did not renew the championship as it lost 4–3 in the final to Porto.\nRecent years.\nIn the next season Benfica regained the title of Portuguese champion after defeating Porto in their home court Dragão Caixa (53–56) in the last best-of-five series game following a 2–2 playoff tie. Benfica retained the title the following season, having only lost two games, one in the regular season, and the other in the play-off final, which they won 3–1 against Académica de Coimbra, both defeats coming only in overtime. Overall Benfica won every title except the Cup, losing against Vitória de Guimarães in the final, amassing only three losses in the entire season in all competitions. On 23 May 2014, Benfica defeated Vitória de Guimarães (3–0) and conquered its 25th champions title (third consecutive), completing the domestic treble of League, Portuguese Cup and Hugo dos Santos Cup. In this season they won a total of 4 titles (including the 2013 Super Cup).\nIn the 2014–15 season, Benfica returned to the European competitions, playing in EuroChallenge where they finished in third place of Group E. At domestic level, Benfica won all the five competitions. Starting the 2015–16 season, they won their fifth and fourth consecutive António Pratas Trophy, setting a club record of ten consecutive Portuguese trophies won. They achieved the domestic treble of League Cup, Portuguese Cup, and league title the next season.\nIn September 2022, Benfica qualified for the regular season of the 2022–23 Basketball Champions League. It was the first time a Portuguese team entered the regular season of the league.\nResults in international competition.\nNote: Benfica score is always listed first.\nHome arenas.\nBenfica played its home basketball games at the Pavilhão dos Desportos, from 1946 to 1965. The club then played its home games at the Pavilhão da Luz, from 1965 to 2003. Since 2003, Benfica has hosted its home games at the Pavilhão Fidelidade, which has a seating capacity of 2,400 people.\nPlayers.\nFormer players.\nPlayers who won a league title with Benfica or who were picked in the NBA draft."

        "title": "Deed of Gift of the America's Cup",
        "text": "The Deed of Gift of the America's Cup is the primary instrument that governs the rules to make a valid challenge for the America's Cup and the rules of conduct of the races. The current version of the deed of gift is the third revision of the original deed. The original deed was written in 1852 and forwarded to the New York Yacht Club on July 8, 1857.\nBrief history.\nThe surviving members of the syndicate which owned the yacht \"America\", the first winner of what would become the America's Cup (née \"Royal Yacht Squadron Cup\" or the \"RYS Cup for One Hundred Sovereigns\"), donated the America's Cup through a deed of gift to the New York Yacht Club on July 8, 1857. The cup would be held in trust as a \"challenge trophy\" to promote friendly competition among nations, with the deed of gift being the primary instrument governing the rules to make a valid challenge for the America's Cup and the rules of conduct of the races.\nAfter the 1881 Cup match, the New York Yacht Club officially returned the Cup to George L. Schuyler, the sole surviving member of the syndicate that owned \"America\" to rewrite the deed to discourage Canadian yacht clubs based on the Great Lakes from challenging the Cup. This revised Deed incorporated, among other things, the following rules: the challenger's yacht club's annual regatta must take place on the sea or on an arm of the sea, and the challenging boat must sail to the site of the contest on her own bottom, as the yacht \"America\" did when first winning the cup in England.\nIn 1887, the challenging yacht's hull was much longer than originally stated by the challenger, a potential advantage. The difference alarmed the N.Y.Y.C., but they rectified the situation by handicapping the challenger. Although the N.Y.Y.C. successfully defended the Cup that year, the problem spurred them to rewrite the Deed. Once again the club officially returned the Cup to Schuyler. The third Deed is much longer and couched in legal terminology. The third Deed tightened the rules for challenging; for example, it stated explicitly that the challenger must not exceed the dimensions provided to the holder of the Cup. The new version of the rules created an uproar among many British yachtsmen, who claimed that the new rules made it impossible to challenge as sailboats with a longer length have a higher speed than boats with a shorter length. No one challenged until six years later, when British railroad tycoon James Lloyd Ashbury set forth his first of two challenges.\nAfter the Second World War, the N.Y.Y.C. amended the Deed by changing the requirement regarding waterline length: the minimum waterline length was reduced from to to allow the use of the 12-metre class. In addition, the rule that the challenging boat had to sail on her own bottom to the site of the match was eliminated, permitting boats to be shipped to the venue without requiring them to be able to sail across oceans (or contain living accommodations).\nIn 1985 a second amendment was made to allow for matches to take place during the summer in the Southern Hemisphere.\nInterpretation.\nThe Deed of Gift is a registered Trust document in the New York Supreme Court in Manhattan (New York County), New York City, New York, which is a court of first instance, unlike supreme courts of other jurisdictions. An interpretation of the document, when contested, can be taken before that Court for clarification on whether the Deed of Gift's terms and conditions (as written by George L. Schuyler) are being met.\nThe wording of the deed is comparatively straightforward but written in the legal language, style and terminology of the time it was written. In later years this has given rise to disputes relating to the meaning of particular phrases and words and clarified or further confused by taking a view on what the donor actually intended when the deed was written.\nThere have been two instances of litigation regarding interpretation appealed to the New York Court of Appeals, that state's highest court. The first concerned the challenge for the 1988 America's Cup, where the question was first, whether the Mercury Bay Boating Club was a valid challenger and if the San Diego Yacht Club had to accept their challenge; and second, whether the Defender's boat (a catamaran) complied with the terms of the Deed of Gift. The answer was yes to both questions.\nThe second concerned Société Nautique de Genève, the defender of the 2010 America's Cup, where the question was whether a valid challenge could be accepted by the defender from a 'shell' yacht club that was formed for the specific purpose of challenging and had not previously held a properly constituted annual regatta on an ocean water course or an arm of the sea. The court's answer was no. There were subsequently a number of additional issues raised regarding the type of boat to be used, the venue and other points which were put to the court by the court adjudicated valid challenger Golden Gate Yacht Club. All were upheld by the court with the exception of two issues which were open and still awaiting court decisions even after the completion of the 2010 America's Cup races but both sides agreed to drop all outstanding legal actions soon after."

Plate appearances ending in walks are specifically excluded from this calculation, as an appearance that ends in a walk is not counted as an at-bat.\nBabe Ruth is the all-time leader with a career slugging percentage of .6897.

Masters Swimming is a club-based organization that maintains a list of all Masters clubs in the country, and oversees structured swimming programs for adults which include competitions in pools or open water. The word \"Masters\" in Masters Swimming refers to age and not skill level. In Canada, swimmers must be 18 years of age to register as a Masters Swimmer. The slogan of Masters Swimming Canada is \"Fun and Friendship, Health and Wellness, Participation and Achievement\".\nMasters Swimming Canada is registered as a federally incorporated non-profit corporation and is governed by an elected board of directors. Registered Masters clubs are the voting members of the corporation. The board of directors acts as a policy-governance board with an executive director responsible for ongoing operations. It is a member of Swimming Natation Canada Inc., the national governing body for swimming in Canada.\nHistory.\nCanada's first Masters Swimming club was established in 1971 by Hud Stewart, a professor at Osgoode Hall Law School and a Canadian track and field Olympian who had become interested in adult fitness. Stewart and his friend Al Waites had entered the second US Masters National Championship in Amarillo on May 7 and May 8, 1971, alongside 106 US swimmers. On his return to Toronto, Stewart established Canada's first Masters Club, \"The University of Toronto Masters\", swimming at Hart House and consisting primarily of university staff, as well as some older students who were not on the University swim teams.\nPrograms.\nCompetition.\nMasters Swimming Canada oversees competition programs for Masters Swimming, including short and long course pool competition as well as open water events, maintaining a calendar of all sanctioned competitions, a database of competitive results, the national rankings, and the Canadian national Masters records. The organization also, through Swimming Canada, maintains the Canadian Masters Swimming Rule Book, which governs all Masters swimming competitions in Canada.\nMasters Swimming Canada organizes the annual Canadian Masters Swimming Championships. A bidding process is conducted each year for the selection of a local organizing committee.\nMillion Metre Challenge.\nThe Million Metre Challenge is a Masters Swimming Canada program that allows swimmers to track their training by recording the number of metres swum in each workout online. As swimmers reach various milestone distances they receive recognition and awards. The program also has components involving total metres swum by clubs and virtual swims where individual and club metres achieved are plotted on maps. Swimmers can log distances by strokes, kicking, and drills, or by total metres, and can record further specifics or notes.\nLike so much of master swimming in Canada, the history of tracking workouts has it roots in Ontario.  A summary of that history is publshed on the Masters Swimming Ontario website."

        "title": "West Indian cricket team in England in 1939",
        "text": "The West Indies cricket team toured England in the 1939 season to play a three-match Test series against England. England won the series 1–0 with two matches drawn. A total of 25 first-class matches were played and the West Indian side won eight of them and lost six, with the others drawn. The tour was abandoned a few days after the final test match because of the worsening international situation with the Second World War imminent. The last six matches from 26 August to 12 September were cancelled (see the schedule in the 1940 Wisden).\nWest Indies did not play Test cricket again until January 1948 when England came to the Caribbean and played four Test matches. England did not play Test cricket after August 1939 until their 1946 season when India toured.\nThe 1940 Wisden had Learie Constantine of Barbados as Cricketer of the Year along with English players Bill Edrich, Walter Keeton, Brian Sellers and Doug Wright (see Wisden on Cricinfo).\nThe West Indies team.\nThe manager of the team was John Kidney, who played 11 first-class matches for Barbados between 1909 and 1932 and who had managed the 1933 touring team in England.\nOf the 16 players in the side, Martindale, Barrow and Headley had toured with the previous West Indies side to visit England in 1933, and Constantine (who toured England in 1923 and 1928) and Grant had been co-opted to that side for a few matches. Constantine had played in West Indies' first-ever Test on the 1928 tour and Sealy (the youngest Test player for the WI) had played Test cricket in the first matches in the West Indies in 1929–30. Grant and Hylton had made their Test debuts in the 1934–35 series in the West Indies.\nEight of the nine other players in the side made their Test debuts during the 1939 tour. They were Cameron, Clarke, Gomez, Johnson, the Stollmeyer brothers, Weekes and Williams. Only Bayley was not capped on this tour, and he never played Test cricket (he probably would have but for the war).\nTest series.\nThree Test matches of three days' duration each were played on the tour.\n1st Test.\nHeadley, with 106 in the first innings and 107 in the second, became the first cricketer to make separate hundreds in a Test at Lord's. It was the second time he had achieved this feat against England, having made 114 and 112 at Georgetown in 1929–30. Jeff Stollmeyer, on his Test debut, made 59 out of 147 in West Indies' first innings, and Bill Copson, also making his Test debut, took five for 85. England's reply was based on 196 for Len Hutton. Hutton shared a fourth wicket partnership of 248 with Denis Compton, who made 120. With the whole of the final day to save the match, West Indies looked to be on course at 190 for four, but lost their last six wickets for 35 runs. Copson took four in the innings to finish with match figures of nine for 152. England had 110 minutes to make 99 for victory and did it with 35 minutes to spare.\n2nd Test.\nRain and bad light ruined the match, with only 35 minutes play possible on the first day. Clarke's leg-spin and Grant's off-spin caused an England collapse to 62 for five, but Joe Hardstaff made 76 out of 111 in 100 minutes. England declared when Hardstaff was out with the thought that the pitch would get more difficult, but Grant made 47 out of 56 with three sixes off Tom Goddard. On the morning of the last day, only Headley, with 51, offered much resistance, Bill Bowes taking six for 33 in 17.4 (eight-ball) overs. England's batsmen failed to take the initiative in the second innings, and the match petered out to a draw. The catch that Wally Hammond took to dismiss Headley in West Indies' second innings was his 100th in Tests: the first player to achieve this apart from wicketkeepers.\n3rd Test.\nDebutant Johnson took the wicket of Walter Keeton with his first delivery in Test cricket, but Norman Oldfield made 80 on his first appearance for England, and with Hutton making 73 and Hardstaff 94, England were all out for 352 before the end of the first day. Jeff Stollmeyer and Headley both made 50s for West Indies in a cautious start on the second day, but then Vic Stollmeyer, making his Test debut, and Weekes added 163 in 100 minutes for the fifth wicket. Stollmeyer was out for 96 but Weekes went on to a hundred in 100 minutes and finished with 137. On the final morning, Constantine hit 79 out of 103 from the final 92 balls of the innings. England lost Keeton and Oldfield cheaply in their second innings, but Hutton (165 not out) and Hammond (138) shared a third wicket partnership of 264, then a world Test record, to make the match and the series safe."

West Indies won the series 3–1 with one match drawn.\nThe tour was arranged at shorter notice than usual following the big success of the 1963 tour, with touring teams from New Zealand and South Africa \"doubling up\" in the 1965 season so that the West Indies could be brought back sooner than scheduled.\nThe West Indies team.\nThe touring team was captained by Gary Sobers, with Conrad Hunte as the vice-captain. The team manager was the former West Indies Test captain Jeffrey Stollmeyer. The full side was:\nTwelve of the team had toured England on the 1963 tour. The newcomers were Brancker, Cohen, Hendriks, Holford and Lashley, and only Brancker, Cohen and Holford had not played Test cricket before the tour. Holford played in all five Tests on the tour but Brancker and Cohen did not appear in the Test series and never won a Test cap.\nTest series summary.\nFirst Test at Old Trafford, 2–4 June 1966.\nEngland's first three-day defeat since 1938 came about through dominant batting by the West Indies' captain and vice-captain, followed up by high quality spin on a receptive pitch. Hunte hit 135 out of 283 in five hours on the first day, and then Sobers took over with 161 in 248 minutes. England dropped several catches, including both century-makers, and of the bowlers only Fred Titmus, with five for 83, emerged with credit. England started badly, with Colin Milburn run out for a duck in his first Test innings, and only a late stand between Jim Parks and David Allen lasted long against the spin of Gibbs (5-37) and Holford (3–34 on his debut). In the follow-on, Milburn made a quick 94 with sixes off Hall and Gibbs, but of the other batsmen only Colin Cowdrey (69) coped with the spin of Gibbs and Sobers. Gibbs finished with five for 69, taking his match figures to 10 for 106.\nSecond Test at Lord's, 16–21 June 1966.\nOne of the great partnerships of Test cricket took the match away from England after they appeared to be on the way to a straightforward victory. Sobers and Holford came together with West Indies just nine runs ahead with five second innings wickets down. In 320 minutes, they put on an unbeaten 274, with Sobers making 163 and Holford, in just his second Test, 105. Earlier sound batting by Butcher, Nurse and Sobers in West Indies's first innings middle order enabled a respectable total despite Higgs' six wickets for 91. England's reply relied on 96 from Tom Graveney, 91 from Jim Parks and 60 from Geoffrey Boycott. Basil D'Oliveira, in his first Test, was unluckily run out when a shot from Parks deflected on to the stumps at the bowler's end and Hall pulled a stump out. After Sobers' second innings declaration, England lost four quick wickets, but Milburn, in his second Test also, hit an unbeaten 126 and he and Graveney saw out time.\nThird Test at Trent Bridge, 30 June–5 July 1966.\nAs at Lord's, West Indies displayed second innings resilience in the face of a deficit, and this time took it through to victory. This time the hero was Butcher, whose unbeaten 209 was stretched across three consecutive century partnerships – 110 with Kanhai (63), 107 with Nurse (53) and then 173 with Sobers (94). Earlier, Nurse with 93 had alone offered forceful resistance in a first innings dominated by pace, though Lashley made a stubborn 49. England's lead was due largely to three players: Graveney (109) and Cowdrey (96) put on 169 after three wickets had gone for 13, and then D'Oliveira made 76 to shepherd the tail to a 90-run lead, sharing a last-wicket stand of 65 with Derek Underwood, who was making his debut. Sobers' declaration left England more than a full day to survive, and though Boycott made 71, including a six off Sobers, and D'Oliveira 54, the match ended with 85 minutes to spare.\nFourth Test at Headingley, 4–8 August 1966.\nAn overwhelming victory with more than a day to spare was built on a fifth wicket stand of 265 between Nurse, who made 137, and Sobers (174). England suffered from the West Indian pace attack – in Milburn's case literally so, for he was forced to retire hurt after a blow to the elbow. Not until D'Oliveira (88) and Higgs (49) came together at 83 for six was there resistance, and Sobers took five for 41. It was a similar story in the follow-on, with Bob Barber reaching 55 but otherwise only the injured Milburn passing 40. Gibbs took six for 39 and Sobers, mostly bowling spin, a further three to finish with match figures of eight for 80 to go with his 174.\nFifth Test at The Oval, 18–22 August 1966.\nWholesale changes to the England side, including a new captain in Brian Close, led to a smarter bowling and fielding performance, but England's victory was based on surprise batting contributions from lower order players. West Indies won the toss for the fifth time, but only Kanhai, with 104, and Sobers (81) prospered against a varied attack. England in turn slumped to 166 for seven before wicket-keeper John Murray joined Graveney. Together they put on 217 for the eighth wicket, with Graveney hitting 165 and Murray's 112 more than doubling his previous Test best. The ninth wicket fell at 399, but Higgs and Snow then scored maiden first-class 50s in a last wicket stand of 128, two short of the-then Test record. Butcher made a quick 60, but Sobers was out for a duck and though Nurse made 70, West Indies were all out with more than a day-and-a-half to spare.\nOther matches.\nThe West Indians played 22 other first-class matches in addition to the Tests, winning five, losing three and drawing 14. Their wins were against Cambridge University, Derbyshire, Kent, Warwickshire and Leicestershire. They lost to Sussex, Northamptonshire and T. N. Pearce's XI. Including the Tests, their record was eight wins, four defeats and 15 draws. They also played six one-day matches and one two-day match, which were not first-class; of these they won five, lost one and drew one."

The other two, Blair and Roberts, never played Test match cricket.\nNotable absentees were Rohan Kanhai (injured) and wicketkeeper Deryck Murray, who would not be released for the full tour by Nottinghamshire.\nThe Test Matches.\nFirst Test at Old Trafford, June 12–17, 1969.\nEngland's success was built on 128 from Geoffrey Boycott, who shared a 112 opening partnership with John Edrich (58) and a third wicket 128 with Tom Graveney, who scored 75 in his 79th and final Test, during which he was 42 years old. West Indies dropped eight catches on the first day alone. Basil D'Oliveira (51) and the tail took the total beyond 400 and West Indies were soon five for two with both openers gone. David Brown and John Snow each took four wickets and no West Indian batsman reached 35. England captain Ray Illingworth enforced the follow-on, and despite consistent batting by the upper order, with 64 from Fredericks, 44 from Carew, 48 from Butcher and 48 also from Sobers, the deficit was only just cleared.\nSecond Test at Lord's, June 26-July 1, 1969.\nBatsmen dominated in sunny conditions. West Indies opened with 106 from Camacho (67) and Fredericks (63) and Davis hit 103 in 375 minutes. At 61 for five, England were in trouble, but debutant John Hampshire hit 107 and shared a 128-run sixth wicket partnership with Alan Knott, and then captain Ray Illingworth hit his first Test century, 113, and John Snow contributed only nine to a last-wicket partnership of 84. West Indies batted brightly, with Fredericks making 60 and Lloyd 70, and Sobers, batting with a runner, contributed an unbeaten 50 before declaring, setting England 332 to win in five hours. They made too slow a start, so that when Phil Sharpe (86) and opener Boycott (106) accelerated with a partnership of 126 in 90 minutes, they had left too little time to complete the task.\nThird Test at Headingley, July 10–15, 1969.\nA slow pitch and damp conditions favoured the bowlers. Edrich's 79 and 40s from D'Oliveira and Knott led England to 223, but no West Indian managed more than 35. Shepherd was unable to bat in West Indies' first innings and could not bowl in England's second, where all players except Boycott made 15 or more, but none reached 40. Set 303 to win in better conditions, West Indies looked to be on course when Camacho, with 71, and Butcher (91) put on 108 for the third wicket, which fell at 177. At 219 for three, Butcher, Sobers (for a duck), Lloyd and Shepherd went for the addition of just nine runs and the tail was able to prolong the match only an hour into the last day."

        "text": "The Junior League World Series is a baseball tournament for children aged 12, 13, and 14 years old. The tournament is held annually at Heritage Park in Taylor, Michigan. It is patterned after the Little League World Series, which was named for the World Series in Major League Baseball.\nThe Junior League World Series is one of eleven tournaments sponsored by Little League International. Each of them brings baseball or softball teams from around the world together in one of four age divisions. The tournament structure for each division's World Series is similar to that used for the Little League Baseball World Series.\nTournament history.\nThe tournament started in 1981, and was originally created for 13-year-old players competing in Little League's Senior League division (which at the time included 13- to 15-year-olds). In 1999, Little league spun a separate Junior League division off from the Senior League division, which included 13- and 14-year-old players (currently, 15-year-olds are also eligible if their date of birth is after May 1 of the current season). Unlike the Little League World Series — which has sixteen regions (eight in the U.S. and eight international) — the Junior League World Series has only twelve regions. The twelve regional champions are divided into two pools (USA and International). The two best teams from each pool advance to the semi-finals, to determine the US champion and the International champion. The semi-final winners play for the World Series Championship. The losing teams face off in classification games.\nOriginally only US teams played in the tournament. As time progressed, however, international teams began to participate. The Puerto Rico Region was established as the first international region, in 1982. The Mexico Region followed in 1986, the Canada Region in 1988, the first European team in 1990, and the Australia Region in 2016. Prior to 2000, the Mexico and Puerto Rico regions each received automatic berths into the tournament. In 2000, a Latin America Region was formed and included the former Mexico and Puerto Rico regions. Starting in 2004, the Mexico Region now receives an automatic berth to the tournament in even-numbered years, while the Puerto Rico Region receives an automatic berth in odd-numbered years. (Each year, the teams from the region without an automatic berth instead participate in the Latin America Region tournament.) From 1985–89 the Michigan state champion received a slot as the Host Team. In 2018, the Host Team was brought back to the tournament as the sixth United States region.\nThe six United States regions are:\nThe six International regions are:"

Also among the Union's chief activities are conferences, organising international matches, and educating and training players and officials. \nIt was formally established in 2000 and gained membership of the Asian Rugby Football Union in 2000. In 2003, it became a member of International Rugby Board. Currently, it is a full member of World Rugby, Asia Rugby, Pakistan Olympic Association, and is recognized by the Pakistan Sports Board as the governing body of the sport in the country .\nFawzi Khawaja, Arif Saeed, and Salman Muzaffar Shaikh are, respectively, the current chairman, president, and secretary-general of the Union, having been elected on 24 March 2021.\nHistory.\nThe origins of rugby union in Pakistan can be traced back to the Karachi Football Rugby Union (KFRU), which was founded in 1925. It was active on the All-India circuit up till the late 1950s. A few local players joined the club in 1968–1969. However, the sport saw a decline by the mid-1970s, as the Royal Navy reduced its presence in the Indian Ocean which caused a decline in its visits to the Pakistani ports. By the early-1980s, the sport had almost died out. KFRU continued playing, but found itself unable to travel abroad for matches dues to lack of funding. There was also a dearth of local teams who were available to play against.\nThings took a turn in the 1990s, when local players, who were introduced to the sport in the 1970s, founded clubs in Lahore and Karachi. Moreover, staff from foreign embassies, high commissions, and banks established the Islamabad Rugby Football Club in 1992. Regular matches between these clubs followed soon afterwards.\nThis led to the formation of the Pakistan Rugby Union in 2000 to further promote the game on a national level. In 2003, Pakistan fielded a national team for the first time, participating in the Provincial Tournament in Sri Lanka. It played the Indian national side there as well. Pakistan Rugby Union then became an associate member of the International Rugby Board (later renamed to World Rugby) in November 2003. It received its full membership in 2008.\nActivities.\nRugby has now been introduced at the provincial and district level by the Pakistan Rugby Union. Schools have also been targeted for rugby to be introduced at the grassroots level. PRU is also an active part of the World Rugby’s “Get into Rugby” programme, which aims to increase the participation in the sport. PRU has competed in a number of events organised by Asia Rugby, and has arranged several domestic competitions at both senior and age grade level for men and women. Regularly training and development courses are also arranged to meet the growing demand for training professionals.\nRugby is also one of the events in the National Games of Pakistan - a move that has reportedly resulted in the employment of over 200 players by universities and departments."

        "text": "Kenneth Athol Wilson (July 23, 1923 – April 3, 2008) was a minor league hockey general manager and owner for forty years. He was born in Craik, Saskatchewan. His career as a manager spanned sixteen years in the International Hockey League, five years in the Continental Hockey League and single seasons each in the National Hockey League, Western Hockey League and Eastern Hockey League. Wilson was known for identifying young talent; his players won league-wide Rookie of the Year awards seven times.\nEarly life.\nWilson played for the Mayfair Public School hockey team in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. In 1937, Mayfair won the J.D. McDonald Cup for the Saskatoon public schools hockey championship, with Wilson playing from the centre and left-wing positions.\nCareer.\nIn 1946, Wilson moved from Trail, British Columbia to Fort Worth, Texas to play for the Rangers in the United States Hockey League (1945-51).\nIn 1950, Wilson became the manager of the new Hobart Arena, in Troy, Ohio. As manager, Wilson booked and promoted many of the leading acts of the 1950s, including the first Ohio venue for Elvis Presley on November 24, 1956, Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, Nat King Cole, Tex Ritter, Sonja Henie, Victor Borge, Liberace, Guy Lombardo, and Patti Page.\nStarting in 1951 and for the next eight seasons, he owned and operated the IHL team Troy Bruins.\nWilson spent the 1959-1960 hockey season as EHL Greensboro Generals' general manager.\nFor three seasons starting in 1960, Wilson was the general manager of the Omaha Knights in the IHL.\nIn 1963, Wilson moved to Toledo, Ohio, where he owned and started the Toledo Blades in the IHL. Over the next three seasons, he served as general manager and as a mid-season replacement in 1966, as coach. In 1964, the Toledo Blades won the Fred A. Huber Trophy, awarded for \"Most Points in the Regular Season' and the Turner Cup awarded to the playoff champions.\nIn 1966, Wilson managed the Vancouver Canucks in the Western Hockey League. Bert Olmstead was the coach.\nIn 1967 the National Hockey League expanded and Olmstead was hired as general manager and coach of the Oakland Seals after the June 7, 1967 NHL player draft. Olmstead hired Wilson to run a farm team the following season. The entire hockey staff was fired at the end of the first season.\nWilson was assistant manager of the Muskegon Mohawks in the IHL for two seasons, 1970–1971 and 1971-1972.\nIn 1972 Wilson was hired as general manager by the Des Moines, Iowa franchise in the IHL. Feeling the franchise needed a new look and image, Wilson changed the name to the Des Moines Capitols. In 1973-1974, the Capitols won the Huber Trophy and the Turner Cup. This was the only season that a Des Moines-based IHL team finished first and won the playoffs. The Capitols disbanded in 1975.\nWilson managed the Flint Generals in 1975-1976 and the Dayton Gems in 1976-1977.\nIn 1981, Wilson formed a group of investors to establish an IHL team in Peoria, Illinois. The Peoria Prancers began play in the 1982-1983 season. After years of good labor relations, the United Auto Workers went on strike against Caterpillar Inc. on October 1, 1982. At the time 50% of Peorians were employed directly or indirectly by Caterpillar. The strike lasted the entire first hockey season. The Prancers were never able to recover from the effects of the strike and folded after the 1983-1984 season.\nWilson moved to Danville, Illinois and took over full-time duties for the Danville Dashers in the Continental Hockey League for the next two seasons. He retired from hockey following the 1985-1986 season.\nWilson lived in Chandler, Arizona with his wife Betty, until his death in 2008."

        "title": "Tennis Girl",
        "text": "The Tennis Girl is a British poster of a female tennis player without underwear that has become a British pop icon.\nCreation.\nThe photograph was taken by then-30-year-old Martin Elliott in September 1976 and features 18-year-old Fiona Butler (now Walker), his girlfriend at the time. The photo was taken at the University of Birmingham's tennis courts (formerly Edgbaston Lawn Tennis Club) in Edgbaston Park Road, Birmingham, England. The site is occupied now by the university's Tennis Court halls of residence. The dress was hand-made by Butler's friend Carol Knotts, from a Simplicity Pattern with added lace trim. Knotts also supplied the tennis racquet, with all of the borrowed items later returned by Butler to Knotts after the shoot with a box of chocolates. Butler borrowed the plimsoll shoes from her father, whilst the tennis balls were those used as playthings by her family's pet dog.\nHistory.\nThe image was first published as part of a calendar by Athena for the 1977 Silver Jubilee, the same year Virginia Wade achieved the Wimbledon ladies' singles title. Athena then negotiated a licence to distribute the image as a poster, where from 1978 it achieved widespread distribution, selling over 2 million copies at £2 per poster. Although Athena went into administration in 1995, the picture remains a popular print.\nButler, who broke up with Elliot three years later, said in retrospect that she was not embarrassed about posing, nor bitter that she did not receive any royalties from the photo. Butler (now Walker) is a mother of three, who works as a freelance illustrator in Droitwich Spa, Worcestershire. Elliott died on 24 March 2010. Knotts, now a barrister living in Gloucestershire, put the dress and racquet up for sale at an auction on 5 July 2014, the day of the 2014 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles final. The dress was sold for £15,000, while the racquet went for between £1,000 and £2,000. The Athena Tennis Girl poster dress is now part of the Wimbledon Museum collection.\nSubject doubts.\nIn February 2015, Peter Atkinson from Marsh Gate, Cornwall, came forward to insist the photo was actually of his ex-wife, producing in evidence two items, one showing the same image and the other a close variant (seemingly taken on the same occasion), both of which were dated 1974, two years before Fiona Butler's photo shoot. Atkinson had previously made the claim, on numerous occasions, that his ex-wife was the actual model, and had done so during Elliott's lifetime. Elliott consistently denied such claims.\nParody.\nOver the years, the picture has been parodied by various people as diverse as former tennis star Pat Cash, singer and actress Kylie Minogue and comedian Alan Carr with actor Keith Lemon featuring his parody in his 2012 calendar.\nAs an election promise for the 2012 Belgian elections, Milka Malfait, a 22-year-old candidate from Sint-Truiden promised to publish a nude photo shoot when receiving 1,000 votes. She released a picture of herself in the Tennis Girl pose prior to the elections.\nIn 2009, it was also parodied in the exit scene from episode 12 from the sixth series of \"Shameless\" when Lillian Tyler, a character played by Alice Barry, gets up and walks towards the door after winning a game console version of tennis.\nThe background of Martin Rowson's cartoon, \"Don't feed the Trolls\", appears to show a poster of Donald Trump as Tennis Girl."

He batted and threw righthanded.\nAs a professional, Perlman played one season for the Blue Sox and finished the 2007 season 3-2 with 1 save, and allowed only 1 of 13 inherited runners to score, which led the league. Perlman also served as the team's pitching and third base coach under manager Ron Blomberg and interim manager Eric Holtz, helping to lead the Blue Sox to the IBL Championship in the league's inaugural season. He was selected to represent the Blue Sox as a member of the 2007 All-Star team. Perlman, along with several members of the Israel Baseball League appeared in the documentary film \"Holy Land Hardball\", chronicling the formation of the first professional baseball league in the Middle East.\nBaseball.\nPerlman attended the Hackley School in Tarrytown, New York.

In all, Perlman appeared as a pitcher in 214 games for Pleasantville since beginning in 1991, and left with the most wins of any pitcher in the WRWBL since the league changed from metal to a wood bat format in 1999 (56-21). His list of personal accolades includes earning two defensive awards for fielding on the mound, winning the league's ERA title on six separate occasions, posting the most wins of any pitcher in 1992-1996 and 2002 and leading the league in strikeouts in 1992, 1994-1997 and 2000. He was a five-time league champion in 1994, 1996, 1997, 1999 and 2000 winning the Championship Most Outstanding Player in 2000 for his two wins in that series. His number #24 was retired by the Red Sox in 2009. Perlman was selected to enter the Westchester Rockland Baseball Hall of Fame in 2010.\nIn 2008 Perlman signed with the Kensico Mud Hens in the Hutchinson River Baseball League. He was selected to the All-Star team in 2016 at age 49. As a member of the Mud Hens he was part of four league championship teams in 2009, 2010, 2012 and 2013.

        "text": "Fred Allen Green (September 14, 1933 – December 22, 1996) was an American professional baseball player. The left-handed pitcher appeared in 88 games in Major League Baseball, all but one in relief, over all or parts of five seasons (1959–62; 1964) for the Pittsburgh Pirates and Washington Senators. A native and longtime resident of the Titusville section of Hopewell Township, Mercer County, New Jersey, he was listed as tall and . His son Gary was a shortstop for three MLB teams between 1986 and 1992, and is a former longtime minor league manager.\nFred Green signed with the Pirates in 1952 and advanced through their farm system, missing 1957 to perform military service in the United States Army. After beginning for the Pirate varsity, then making one appearance in July, Pittsburgh called him up from Triple-A Columbus in August 1959 for an extended stay in the majors. He was largely effective in 13 late-season relief assignments, and made his only MLB start on September 11 against the eventual 1959 world champion Los Angeles Dodgers, dropping a 4–0 decision at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.\nThe following season, , saw Green spend the entire campaign on the Pirates' big-league roster and set career bests in games pitched (45), innings pitched (70), wins (eight), winning percentage (.667), and saves (three), as Pittsburgh won the National League pennant. He also posted a strong 3.21 earned run average. But he was treated harshly by the New York Yankees in the 1960 World Series. In three appearances, all lopsided Pirate losses, Green surrendered 11 hits and ten earned runs in only four full innings of work—an ERA of 22.50. Two of the hits he allowed were home runs to Mickey Mantle. Nonetheless, Pittsburgh won the remaining four games by tight margins to become world champions.\nWhen Green's struggles continued in , he was sent back to Columbus for part of the season, then released on waivers to the Washington Senators. The 1962 Senators used him in five games, then sent him to the minor leagues, where the following season he ended up back in the Pirate organization.\nIn , Pittsburgh recalled Green from Triple-A in midyear and he was effective in eight relief assignments, allowing only one run in 7 innings pitched for a 1.23 earned run average. But he was sent back to Columbus after June 14 and finished his professional career there in 1965.\nAs a major leaguer, he compiled a 9–7 record and four saves, with a 3.48 earned run average and 77 strikeouts in 142 innings pitched. He allowed 142 hits and 63 bases on balls.\nAs a hitter, Green batted .176 (3-for-17) but 2 of his major league hits were home runs, both hit during the 1960 season."

        "text": "The Rugby World Cup is an international rugby union competition established in 1987. It is contested by the men's national teams of the member unions of the sport's governing body, World Rugby, and takes place every four years. The winners of the first final were New Zealand, who beat France. South Africa are the latest winners, having won the 2023 Rugby World Cup in France.\nThe Rugby World Cup final is the last match of the competition. The winning team is declared world champion and receives the Webb Ellis Cup. If the score is a draw after 80 minutes of regular play, an additional 20-minute period of play, called extra time, is added. If the score remains tied, an additional 10 minutes of sudden-death extra time are played, with the first team to score points immediately declared the winner. If no team is able to break the tie during extra time, the winner is ultimately decided by a penalty shootout. Two finals have gone to extra time: South Africa's victory against New Zealand in the 1995 final, and England's triumph against Australia in the 2003 final.\nOnly five nations have ever made it into a Rugby World Cup final. South Africa is the most successful team in the history of the tournament, with four wins, followed by New Zealand with three wins. New Zealand and South Africa are the only teams to have won consecutive tournaments, with New Zealand winning in 2011 and 2015, and South Africa winning in 2019 and 2023, Springboks currently being the only team to have won every World cup final they were in. Australia have won the competition twice, while England have one win; they are the only nation from the Northern Hemisphere to have won the competition. France are the only team to appear in a final without ever winning one, losing all three finals they have contested. Note that South Africa, due to international sanctions, was not permitted to play in the 1987 and 1991 tournaments.\nHistory.\nThe first final of the Rugby World Cup was contested in June 1987, in Auckland, between New Zealand and France. The host team opened the scoring in the 14th minute, following a drop goal by fly-half Grant Fox. They extended their lead later in the first half when Michael Jones scored a try, which was converted by Fox. Losing 9–0 at half-time, the French opened their scoring in the second half, through a penalty by Didier Camberabero. Following this, New Zealand controlled the match and tries from David Kirk, John Kirwan and the goal kicking of Fox extended their lead to 29–3. A try by Pierre Berbizier in the final minutes, which was converted by Camberabero, reduced the deficit to 29–9, as New Zealand won the tournament's inaugural final.\nAs the hosts, England reached the final of the 1991 tournament at Twickenham, where they faced Australia. Fly-half Michael Lynagh opened the scoring for Australia with a penalty in the 27th minute. They extended their lead before half-time when prop Tony Daly scored a try, which was converted by Lynagh. England scored two penalties in the second half, courtesy of full-back Jonathan Webb, but a further penalty by Lynagh sealed Australia's victory at 12–6. The tournament hosts reached the final again in 1995, as South Africa faced New Zealand in Johannesburg. Fly-half Andrew Mehrtens opened the scoring for New Zealand in the 6th minute after scoring a penalty. His opposite number, Joel Stransky, levelled the score five minutes later. The pair swapped successful penalty attempts before Stransky gave South Africa a 9–6 lead with a 32nd-minute drop goal just before half-time. New Zealand equalized in the 55th minute with a drop goal by Mehrtens, and as no further points were scored, the final went into extra time for the first time. Mehrtens converted a penalty to put New Zealand back the lead, but Stransky replied minutes later. With seven minutes to the end of extra time, Stransky scored a drop goal to secure a 15–12 victory for South Africa. Nelson Mandela, the South African President, wearing a Springboks jersey, presented the Webb Ellis Cup to South Africa captain Francois Pienaar.\nThe 1999 final saw Australia face France at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. Two tries by Owen Finegan and Ben Tune, and seven penalties by Matt Burke contributed to Australia's 35–12 win, as they became the first nation to win the Rugby World Cup twice. Australia also became the first side to contest successive finals when they faced England in the 2003 final at the Telstra Stadium in Sydney. The hosts opened the scoring in the sixth minute through a Lote Tuqiri try. England responded and scored three penalties by fly-half Jonny Wilkinson and a try by winger Jason Robinson to achieve a 14–5 lead at half-time. Three penalties from Elton Flatley in the second half allowed Australia to level the score and send the final into extra time. Wilkinson and Flatley scored a penalty apiece before the former scored a drop goal in the last minute of the match to give England a 20–17 victory. They became the first side from the Northern hemisphere to win the tournament.\nEngland reached the final again in 2007, where they faced South Africa, who had won 36–0 when the two teams met during the pool stage. South African full-back Percy Montgomery scored three penalties to Wilkinson's one to give South Africa a 9–3 lead at half-time. England had a try disallowed in the first minutes of the second half, when Mark Cueto was adjudged to be in touch before scoring. A penalty from Wilkinson and a further two penalties, one from Montgomery, and one from Steyn reduced the gap but did not prevent South Africa from winning 15–6 and secure their second World Cup victory. The 2011 final pitted hosts New Zealand against France for the second time in the tournament, after their first encounter in the pool stage resulted in a 37–17 win for New Zealand. The host team scored the first points of the match, with a try in the 15th minute through prop Tony Woodcock. Nine minutes later, New Zealand's third-choice fly-half Aaron Cruden went off injured and was replaced by Stephen Donald, who had only been called into the squad following injuries to first-choice fly-halves Dan Carter and Colin Slade. Donald extended New Zealand's lead in the second half with a penalty; a minute later, French captain Thierry Dusautoir scored a try, which was converted by François Trinh-Duc to leave France one point behind New Zealand. Despite constant pressure from the French for the remainder of the final, they were unable to score more points and New Zealand won the match 8–7 to lift their second World Cup trophy.\nNew Zealand reached the final again in 2015, where they faced Australia at Twickenham. Tries from Nehe Milner-Skudder, Ma'a Nonu and Beauden Barrett, along with four penalties, two conversions and one drop goal from fly-half Dan Carter produced a 34–17 win for New Zealand. With this victory, they became the first team to win the World Cup three times and the first holders to retain the trophy. It was also the first time that New Zealand won the competition outside of their country. South Africa beat England 32–12 in the final of the 2019 Rugby World Cup with Handré Pollard kicking 22 points to dominate the English. This was the first time the winning team had lost a match during and gone to win the competition; South Africa lost 23–13 against New Zealand in the pool stage.\nNotes.\nA.  Prior to 1992, a try was worth four points.\nB.  Score was 9–9 after 80 minutes.\nC.  Score was 14–14 after 80 minutes."

He later served in the United States Army during the Second World War, and was killed in action during the Battle of Hürtgen Forest in 1945.\nBiography.\nTurner was born in Windsor, Ontario. He played with the Guelph Indians of the Ontario Hockey Association and led the league in goals allowed on three occasions. Detroit, which held his rights, sent him to their American Hockey League affiliate, the Indianapolis Capitals, in 1941. There he played in the first AHL All-Star Game and was a first team All-Star as goaltender. He would also lead the Capitals to a Calder Cup championship. On February 5, 1942, he replaced an injured Johnny Mowers in a 3–3 tie against the Toronto Maple Leafs for his only appearance in the NHL.\nAfter the season, he signed up for the United States Army as a 2nd Lieutenant in Company K, 311th Infantry, 78th Division and fought in World War II. He was originally classified as Missing in Action in the Hurtgen Forest, Germany on December 13, 1944. For his service, the International Hockey League named its championship trophy, the Turner Cup, after him."

The caps are used to identify both the player and their team, and to protect their ears from injury possibly caused by a water polo ball hitting the head.\nUse for water polo.\nCaps are differentiated by the number printed on them as well as the color. Players from the visiting team will wear dark caps, whereas the home team players will wear white caps. The goalkeepers wear quartered red caps, numbered \"1\", while substitute goalies have caps which are either numbered \"1-A\" in NCAA games, or \"13\" in FINA international games. Thus, each team will have two sets of caps: one white and the other dark colored. According to the \"NFHS\" water polo uniform rules, the numbers on the cap contrast the color of the cap, and both the color of the cap and the color of the number contrast the color of the ball.\nUse by underwater sports disciplines.\nIn underwater football, underwater hockey and underwater rugby, water polo caps are worn by competitors to identify which teams they are playing for, and to offer some protection to individuals against the possibility of a burst eardrum caused by the blade of a fin making direct contact across the ear. Opponents in underwater hockey and underwater rugby wear either one of two colours - white or dark (i.e. blue or black) caps while the water referees wear red caps. Underwater football appears to follow this precedent. Caps are also used in Aquathlon (underwater wrestling) for identification purposes; one competitor wears either a red or blue coloured cap while the other competitor wears a white or yellow coloured cap."

Weeks after the 1957 regular season ended on September 29, the team moved to Los Angeles for the campaign.\nAlthough the Dodgers' new home was minutes from Miller's high school alma mater, he never again appeared for them after 1957. Miller played three more years in the lower reaches of the Dodgers' farm system, leaving baseball after the 1960 campaign to join the United States Marine Corps, where he served for four years.

        "text": "The Wales women's national rugby union team () first played in 1987. Wales plays in the Women's Rugby World Cup and the Women's Six Nations Championship.\nHistory.\nAs far back as the nineteenth century, the Welsh game was a notable for the high levels of female interest. As such, the newly constructed stand at Cardiff Arms Park had to be renovated for \"the comfort of the ladies\", with another reporter stating that \"fully a third\" of the spectators at Stradey Park, Llanelli were female. In 1905, an English journalist from the Daily Mail reporting on The Original All Blacks game against Newport RFC at Rodney Parade, reported: \"The average woman in Newport, judging from the expert feminine criticisms punctuating Saturday’s play, apparently knows as much of the science of rugby as any man.\"\nWhile it is still a subject of debate as to when the first female Welsh teams played, women's rugby would gain great prominence during the First World War, as many male players were called into service. One of the most notable matches took place at Cardiff Arms Park on 16 December 1917, when Cardiff Ladies (made up entirely of workers from Hancocks Brewery) beat Newport Ladies 6–0. Maria Eley played full-back for Cardiff and went on to become probably the oldest women's rugby player before she died in Cardiff in 2007 at the age of 106. A photograph of the Cardiff team is believed to be the oldest known image of a women’s rugby team and is part of the collection at Cardiff Rugby Museum.\nThe first official Wales Women team first played on 5 April 1987 when led by Liza Burgess, they took on an England Women side at Pontypool Park. Prior to 1987, Welsh players were selected to represent Great Britain with the first representative side featuring players from Wales running against France at Richmond Athletic Ground in 1986. Great Britain played as a team on several occasions until 1990, beating Italy in their final match. Wales have played England every year since 1987.\nWales hosted the first Women's Rugby World Cup in Cardiff in 1991 and since then they have participated in a further four of the five tournaments finishing fourth in 1994, their highest ever finish. The IRB adopted the competition in 1998, which was won by the New Zealand Black Ferns.\nThe Welsh Women's Rugby Union was created in 1994 charged with promoting and governing the development and practice of Women's Rugby in Wales; the other three home unions also took charge of their own administration effectively ending the function of the WRFU in the process. The WWRU also became affiliated to the Welsh Rugby Union at the same time.\nThe creation of four separate home unions for Women's Rugby in Great Britain also saw the introduction of the Women's Home Nations competition with the first set of internationals taking place in 1995. Wales Women's early years in the tournament saw victories only against Ireland Women . Wales Women also remain the only touring team from Wales to have won a Test series in South Africa, beating the Bokkies by two Test to nil back in 1994.\nFrom 2004 to 2006 a policy of selecting only players based in Wales resulted in a series of poor results – and failure to qualify for the 2006 World Cup. When the policy was reversed the team immediately recorded their best Six Nations performance, with a victory over France in 2006, wins over Scotland in 2006 &amp; 2007, ending a ten-year drought of wins against their Celtic opponents, and culminating with victory over England in 2009 on their way to a Triple Crown. The National 7s squad lifted the European 7s title in 2006, beating England in the final but narrowly failed to secure a place in the 2009 Rugby World Cup 7s. In 2007 Wales also re-entered the FIRA Championship, using the tournament to give tournament experience to its development team.\nIn November 2021, the Welsh Rugby Union announced that they would be offering 12-month contracts to Wales Women for the first time in its history.

The team played the Women's Six Nations from 2000 to 2006, but they were replaced by Italy for 2007, in order to mirror the men's tournament.\nHistory.\nCurrently there are over 200 clubs in Spain and a league similar to that of male rugby. The first steps were taken in 1913, when women played in secret in schools, but rugby first began to be played seriously at training camps at the School of Architecture of Madrid in the early 70s by a group of architecture students. They formed a group of about 20 girls who trained regularly twice per week and as they were the only ones who practiced, played sided games between themselves. They played well\nIn the late seventies a group of female PE students taught by Jose Antonio Sancha, a professor of Rugby at Barcelona INEF, decided to train with the men's rugby and played the game seriously (though they were not recognised by the Catalan Federation rugby until 1983).\nThe first game was played in Barcelona between the BUC and INEF clubs and other clubs quickly formed in different parts of Spain but mainly in the early years only came from Barcelona and Madrid. In a few years female rugby spread to Madrid, the Basque Country and Valencia. In 1991 27 women's teams participating in regional competitions.\nThe national team first played in Cardiff (Wales) at the Rugby World Cup, where they won the fifth place behind the United States, England, France and New Zealand. In 1994, the Spanish team was unable to come to Scotland because of budgetary problems, however Spain remained one of the top teams in Europe. In 1995 Spain became the unexpected champions of the first European Championship by defeating rival France, in the final 21–6. The 1996 European brought a repeat of that final but this time the Spanish lost by 15–10.\nIn January 1997 a tour of England took place where Spain and were in the lead against the World Champions until 10 minutes from the end of the match. Only a last minute try by England gave them the win and in European (the first where all the British teams competed) played the final but Spain came 3rd. Spain qualified for the World Championships in Amsterdam and managed a creditable 7th place. Spain again reached the European final in 1999 against France, losing 13–5, after beating Wales (14-8) and Scotland (11-9).\nThe 2002 World Cup was held in Barcelona, New Zealand retaining its title in defeating (19-9) to England in the final at the Olympic Stadium Lluis Companys. France took the bronze after beating Canada (41-7), while Spain finished in 8th place after yielding to the United States (23-5).\nSpain were also members of the Five and Six Nations from 2000 to 2006, finishing third on three occasions and winning 10 of the 33 games they played. However, in 2007 they were replaced by Italy because the Six Nations Committee wished to align the women's tournament with the men's. This has severely reduced Spain's opportunities to play top level international rugby, and may have been a factor in Spain's failure to qualify for the 2010 World Cup. However, they were compensated a little in 2010 when they won the \"double\" of the European 15s and 7s titles without losing a game.\nCompetitive record.\nOverall.\n\"(Full internationals only, updated to 23 March 2024)\"\nPlayers.\nRecent squad.\nSpain announced their final squad for the inaugural 2023 WXV 3 tournament in Dubai on 2 October 2023."

        "title": "Tom Rogers (baseball)",
        "text": "Thomas Andrew \"Shotgun\" Rogers (February 12, 1892 – March 7, 1936) was a Major League Baseball pitcher from 1917 to 1921 for the St. Louis Browns, Philadelphia Athletics, and New York Yankees. \nCareer.\nRogers, who was born in Sparta, Tennessee, and grew up in Gallatin, Tennessee, began his professional career with the Nashville Vols of the Southern Association in 1914. In two seasons with the Vols, Rogers had a career win–loss record of 17–20 in 46 games, having allowed 149 runs on 305 hits. The St. Louis Browns were close to signing Rogers to a major league contract in 1915, but they felt he was not yet ready and, instead, he continued with Nashville in 1916.\nOn June 19, 1916, Rogers accidentally killed a longtime friend and former teammate with a pitch. The friend, Johnny Dodge of the Mobile Sea Gulls, was hit in the temple and knocked unconscious. Dodge was helped to stand and led to the showers, where he died of a brain hemorrhage.\nOn July 11, 1916, on only two days of rest, Rogers pitched a perfect game against the Chattanooga Lookouts at Sulphur Dell ballpark in Nashville. The Lookouts nearly recorded a hit in the second inning when Joe Harris led off with a sharp line drive to right-center field. Center fielder Billy Lee made a diving catch at the base of the notorious Sulphur Dell right field incline, saving the perfect game bid in its early stages. A second defensive play was made by Vols left fielder Gus Williams in the top of the seventh when he crashed into the left field bleacher fence in the act of catching Jake Pitler's sharply hit ball to left. With two outs in the top of the ninth inning, John Peters came in to pinch hit for pitcher James Allen. He hit a soft fly ball to second base which was fielded by Thomas Sheehan for the final out. In all, Rogers struck out 4 of the 27 batters he faced. The game lasted just 1 hour and 25 minutes.\nRogers finished the season with a 24–12 record and having allowed only 75 runs on 243 hits. His 24 wins put him in a three-way-tie for the most wins in the Southern Association in 1916.\nHaving signed with the American League's St. Louis Browns for 1917, Rogers made his major league debut on April 14 against the Chicago White Sox at Sportsman's Park. Coming into the game in relief, Rogers pitched 7 innings allowing 4 runs (3 earned) while striking out 3 and walking 4 of the 25 batters he faced without figuring in the decision. He appeared in 24 games that year, including 8 starts, ending with a 3.89 earned run average (ERA) with 27 strikeouts and a 3–6 record over  innings.\nHe improved in 1918, pitching 154 innings across 29 games with 16 starts. His ERA lowered to 3.27 as he struck out 29 hitters and acquired an 8–10 record. Rogers pitched just 1 inning across 2 games for the 1919 Browns before his contract was sold in May to the Philadelphia Athletics for US$2,000. With the Athletics, he posted a 4.31 ERA with 37 strikeouts and a 4–12 record over 140 innings. He played the 1920 season with the International League's Buffalo Bisons.\nThough playing most of the 1921 season with Buffalo, Rogers, pitched five games for the New York Yankees that September. In 5 games out of the bullpen, he had an ERA of 7.36 and an 0–1 record in 11 innings of work. His final appearance came on October 7 in Game 3 of the 1921 World Series, pitching the last  innings in a 13–5 loss to the New York Giants.\nRogers continued to play for various minor league teams in each succeeding year, before playing his final professional season with the Quincy Indians of the Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League in 1930. His career minor league record was 154–117, while his major league record was 15–30 with a 3.95 ERA.\nSuffering from emotional problems as a result of Dodge's death, Rogers died in Nashville in 1936 at the age of 44."

He would play for the Chicago Cubs and Brooklyn Robins.\nBiography.\nHe was born on October 28, 1892, in Chicago. McCabe appeared in three games of the 1918 World Series. As a pinch-runner in Game 4, he scored the tying run in an eighth-inning rally at Fenway Park against Boston pitcher Babe Ruth, but the Cubs lost the game 3–2 on a wild pitch in the bottom of the eighth. He died on September 2, 1966, in Chicago.\nMcCabe also made one appearance in the 1920 World Series. He pinch-ran with two outs in the ninth inning of Game 6, which Brooklyn was losing 1–0. Duster Mails retired the final batter for a Cleveland Indians victory.\nDuring his career, McCabe batted 199 times and hit just .161, with five extra-base hits."

        "title": "Hickory golf",
        "text": "Hickory golf is a variation of golf played with hickory-shafted golf clubs. In the United States the main organizing body is the Society of Hickory Golfers (SoHG); in Canada, the Golf Historical Society of Canada; in the U.K., the British Golf Collectors Society; and leading on the continent, the European Association of Golf Historians and Collectors. \nThere are also quite active groups in Switzerland, Austria, Germany, Italy, Croatia, Sweden, Poland, Finland, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan that conduct national tournaments.\nPart of the attraction of playing with hickory clubs is that they reintroduce 'feel' to the golf shot. Adherents enjoy the challenge of finding and restoring clubs suitable for play. Proponents also claim that hickory golf allows golfers to play classic golf courses as they are meant to be played.\nDivisions.\nThere are two main divisions of play, pre-1935 and pre-1900. A small niche of golfers in the U.S. have begun experimenting with feather-ball golf and reproduction clubs. This style attempts to replicate golf as it was played prior to about 1850. \nThe pre-1900 group play a replicated gutta-percha style ball, and clubs are limited to those produced before 1900 or approved reproductions. Iron clubs are smooth-faced and woods are splice-necked. Several \"gutty\" tournaments exist in the U.S. Three of the most prominent are the long-running National Hickory Championship organized by Peter Georgiady; the Foxburg Hickory Championship, organized by Tom Johnson; and the Keeper of the Spirit Hickory Championship, organized by Greg Smith. Many of the early \"NHC\" tournaments were conducted in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia at Oakhurst Links, as restored by Lewis Keller, and identified by the National Register of Historic Places as the oldest golf course in the United States. The NHC has also been held at Pinehurst No. 8 &amp; No. 1 (one Championship) and The St. Martin's course of The Philadelphia Cricket Club (two Championships). Other gutty golf venues include the Foxburg Country Club in Foxburg, Pa., and the Eagle Springs Golf Course in Eagle Springs, Wisc. Other gutty tournaments are gaining traction throughout the U.S. as well. \nThe pre-1935 group (vintage division) play with modern balls, but play is limited to clubs manufactured before 1935 or to authorized reproductions. There are numerous tournaments and championships throughout the world.\nChampionships.\nThere are a number of Championships conducted in countries around the world. The majority of the events are currently held in the United States and the United Kingdom. The chief tournament in the U.S. is the U.S. Hickory Open, which rotates around the country at various golf and country clubs. It has been held annually since 2008. In Europe, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, Germany, Australia, France, the Czech Republic, and Finland have held national championships. In the Asia/South Pacific region, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan are leading hickory golf countries. The main international schedule of tournaments is on the SoHG website tournament page, and at Hickorygolf.com. A list of regional and national playing societies and associations may be found at the Resources page of the SoHG.\nImportant European hickory championships include the French hickory golf Championship (francehickory.com) of La Société Française de Golf Hickory; the Swiss Hickory Championship (swisshickory.ch), held on the oldest golf course in Switzerland, the Engadine Golf Club in St. Moritz/Samedan. Amateurs and professionals are welcomed to participate in this hickory event. The Polish Hickory Open is sponsored by \"Hickory World\" – an organisation promoting hickory golf.\nThe World Hickory Open Championship (www.worldhickoryopen.com), which was inaugurated in 2004 by the late Lionel Freedman, is held today on variety of courses in Scotland and annually attracts around 100 players from across the world.

        "title": "Darwin Baseball League",
        "text": "Established in 1953, the Darwin Baseball Association and latterly Darwin Baseball League (DBL) is the governing body of amateur baseball in Darwin, Northern Territory. The DBL is governed by Baseball NT and ultimately, the Australian Baseball Federation.\nHistory.\nBaseball in Darwin had its beginnings courtesy of Japanese anglers and the American servicemen settled here. Prior to 1953, baseball was a disorganised social get-together. An association was formed and regulated in 1953, thanks to a basketball fan named Charles See-Kee and Wellington Chin, who were both prominent members of the Darwin Chinese community. The game was immediately popular, despite the area's limited population and urban areas.\nIn sports-conscious Darwin, the original baseballers were already involved with other local sports, mainly Australian rules football and basketball. Darwin baseball originally comprised competitive matches amongst only four teams: DCRC (Darwin Chinese Recreation Club) Red Sox, St. Marys, RAAF Braves and Dodgers. DCRC and St. Marys players were all \"settled\" residents of Darwin, whereas Dodgers were mostly Government Dept. of Works and Housing employees or bank clerks on two-year postings. RAAF Braves were predominantly defence force personnel.\nGames were played on the old Darwin Oval, located on the Esplanade opposite the Hotel Darwin. The playing surface was a levelled out, rock-hard dirt, devoid of any grass, presenting a risk of skin injury to baserunners. It was a time wasn't a properly-shaped baseball field and children chased foul balls that went over the cliff behind the back net and into the sea.\nWithin two years the competition had grown to 7 teams, remaining through to the mid-1960s. Dodgers disappeared, to be replaced by Waratahs in 1956, which was joined by former Dodger players.\nThe early 1960s saw a shuffle of playing venues from Kahlin Oval, Waratah Oval, RAAF Base Squadron Oval, Fred Smith Oval, Nightcliff Oval before settling at Gardens Oval in 1965, where the home of baseball would remain for nearly 25 years. Up until then, the competition had always been conducted during the wet season, except in 1956, when a supplementary dry season was conducted at Coonawarra (opposite the Naval Base) to test player support. It was not until the mid-1960s that dry-season baseball was revived, with the league running additional competitions to the regular wet season competition. However, in 1968, with players tired of playing baseball year-round, clubs finally opted for Darwin baseball to remain a wet season sport. It was not until 1984, when the baseball season reverted to dry season competition, which it remains.\nIn 1989, the clubs opted for a home-and-away competition. Rebels' home ground was a purpose-built diamond at Tracy Village Sports &amp; Social Club. Nightcliff sought and obtained permission from Nightcliff Middle School to build a permanent baseball ground. South Darwin constructed a permanent facility at Warren Park, Marrara Sporting Complex. Palmerston constructed a permanent baseball facility at Archer Field in Palmerston. Pints, unable to secure a permanent facility, played their home games at Tracy Village. Home and away games continued until 2007, when it was decided to play all games at Tracy Village.\nMax Rider is a former president and of the DBL, and a Life Member. Rider's volunteer contributions over many years was outstanding and at one stage he held the position of both President and Secretary. Max was instrumental in transforming the DBL into a business-like competition by raising the quality of administration and stakeholder consultation.\nModern era.\nOf the modern clubs, Waratahs were always strong. They won a Premiership in their first year as Waratahs in 1956 and contested many Grand Finals. However, always a hard team to defeat, ultimate premiership success too often eluded them. In 1968, they went through the season and preliminary finals undefeated, only to lose the Grand Final to Eagles in a whitewash. Their limited finals success earned them the nickname of \"Cream Puffs\", which remained with them for many years. A major factor in Waratahs being such a strong and popular club in their first 12 years was the success of their recruiting network which was the envy of all other clubs. Waratahs were the only sports club which had its own licensed club house and grounds. Thus, their recruiting tentacles reached out quickly to sign-up the lion's share of talented new arrival in town. As Darwin grew and other clubs also adopted licensed clubs, Waratahs popularity declined and in the early 1980s, they nearly disbanded. Facing survival, they made the hard decision to relocate the club, in 1990, to the satellite city of Palmerston, becoming the Palmerston Reds and in 1996, they won their first Premiership under that name.\nOf the other present-day clubs, Pints Green Sox (Post-Tel Institute of the Northern Territory) is the oldest. Formed in 1968, the club gained immediate success in the 1968/69 and 1969/70 seasons. Although Pints have continued to be a competitive club, their limited finals success is arguably not a true indication of their depth.\nFor the first 12 years of Darwin baseball, DCRC Red Sox dominated the competition. However, in the mid to late 1960s, dwindling player numbers forced the club to disband, in 1969. That year saw the foundation of the Nightcliff Baseball Club, with several former DCRC players adopting the new club. Known as \"The Tigers\", Nightcliff dominated the competition throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, playing in 12 consecutive Grand Finals, winning 9 of them. Many critics argued that if Nightcliff had not entered 2 teams in the 1972/73 season, they would have easily won the Grand Final, instead of finishing second and third. Their dominance finally ended when, in 1984, the competition switched from wet-season to dry-season. Nightcliff was the only club to vote against the switch and most players refused to play in protest. As a consequence, Nightcliff did not compete in the inaugural 1984 dry season, but rejoined in 1985. Following a rebuilding program between 1985 and 1989, the Tigers re-established themselves as a competitive force in the competition.\nThe East Darwin Beasts were formed in 1978, but were previously known as the Oilers and prior to that, the Blue Jays. The Beasts only Grand Final success was in 1980/81, when they finally defeated their long-time nemesis, Nightcliff. East Darwin was the main proponent of swapping the competition from wet-season to dry season, to promote better playing conditions. However, when the change occurred in 1984, it ironically worked against them. The Beasts had large numbers of cricket players who played baseball in the cricket off-season. Thus, when the competition swapped, most of their players choose cricket over baseball. The effect was swift and despite the best efforts of a few stalwarts to keep the club running, they disbanded in 1987.\nThe South Darwin Rabbitohs was the next club formed in 1970, with the majority of their players recruited from the NT Police Force. Although success took a long time coming for the Green &amp; Reds, they finally won a flag in 1986 over Waratahs. They repeated the feat the following year and were successful again in 1990. The Rabbitohs were competitive throughout the 1990s. However, as the only club without a sound junior development program, there were limited player numbers being developed through the ranks. Without juniors and with natural attrition of senior players, the Rabbitohs finally succumbed and disbanded in 2004.\nThe newest of the modern era clubs was Northern Districts Rebels, who were formed in 1975, as a break-away faction of Nightcliff. Several Nightcliff members, disappointed at the way the club was being administered, decided to start a new club. Their early years were difficult, as the club endeavoured to develop a strong junior base for the future. Rebels' first premiership was in the shortened 1983 season, followed again in 1984 and 1985. Without a licensed club behind them, Northern Districts accepted an offer to join the Tracy Village Sports and Social Club. In 1986, they became officially known as Tracy Village Rebels. Rebels have gone on to become the most successful Darwin club, winning 16 premierships.\nRivalries.\nThere have been two significant rivalries between Darwin baseball clubs.\nBetween 1969 and 1983, Pints and Nightcliff hated each other with a passion. Both clubs had colourful, passionate and vocal players, not afraid to speak their minds. All-in brawls were a common occurrence during a game resulting in many ejections, reports and suspensions. The rivalry finally began to dissipate in 1984, when Nightcliff disbanded for one year and players from both sides either retired or moved on.\nThe current rivalry is between Nightcliff and Tracy Village. Commencing in 1990, there has been no love lost between the Tigers and Rebels, and they have squared-off against each other in 13 Grand Finals. During the 1990s and 2000s, there were many heated games as the two best teams in the league battled it out. With Rebels dominating the competition during the 2000s, the rivalry has taken a slightly different perspective, will all other clubs joining the rivalry against Tracy Village. But the rivalry between Rebels and the Tigers remains strong.\nThe issue was reflected by Clark (2003, p. 134) who stated that traditional rivalries have existed between Australian baseball clubs for many years, with all Darwin clubs squared off traditionally with Nightcliff."

He was an outfielder for the Boston Braves and Brooklyn Dodgers from 1949 to 1954.\nBaseball career.\nThompson was born in Swepsonville, North Carolina. In 1943, he signed with the Boston Red Sox organization as a pitcher. He pitched in the minor leagues for a few years but then hurt his arm. He converted into an outfielder, and in 1947 he hit .328 for the Class D Milford Red Sox.\nThompson made his Major League debut in 1949 for the Braves. After the season, he was traded to the Dodgers and spent 1950 with their top minor league club, the International League's Montreal Royals. He led the Royals in all three triple crown categories and was promoted to the Major League team in 1951. As a backup outfielder in 1951, Thompson hit just .229. He had the lowest batting average and OPS of any Dodger player with over 100 at-bats, and Brooklyn lost the pennant by one game.\nIn 1952, Thompson returned to Montreal and batted .345. He was Brooklyn's left fielder in 1953. His career highlight came in game 4 of that year's World Series, when he threw out the New York Yankees' Billy Martin at home plate to end the game. In 1954, Thompson hit just .040 in 34 games and was again sent down to Montreal. He retired after the season.\nLater life.\nThompson went into the automobile business after his baseball days were over and later became a real estate agent. He was elected into the Brooklyn Dodgers Hall of Fame in 1997.\nThompson died in 2009, at the age of 85."

        "text": "Robert Lee Atkins, Jr. (April 2, 1946 – September 22, 2020) was an American professional football player who was a defensive back in the National Football League (NFL). He played for the St. Louis Cardinals (1968-1969) and for the Houston Oilers (1970-1976). He was born on April 2, 1946, in Modesto, California, and became a native of Atlanta, Georgia. When he was three years old, his parents, U.S. Navy Sailor Robert and Mary Brown Atkins, relocated their family from California to Georgia in 1949. At Luther J. Price High School, he was an exceptional player in three sports, baseball, basketball, and football. After graduating in 1964, Atkins attended Grambling State University, in Grambling, Louisiana. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in Physical Education and Recreation in 1972. In 1986, he received a Master of Education degree from Prairie View A&amp;M University (PVAMU) in Prairie View, Texas.\nIn 1968, the St. Louis Cardinals drafted Atkins in the second round as a cornerback. After the draft, he played in two major all-star games: January 1968, the 19th Annual Senior Bowl All Star Game, and in August 1968, the College All-Star Game against the National Football League World Champs Green Bay Packers. As a rookie with the Cardinals, Atkins became known for his exceptional speed and his authoritative hits. Playing two years for the Cardinals, Atkins was traded to the Houston Oilers in 1970. During his seven-year tenure with the Oilers, he was respected on and off the field for his achievements. He won numerous game balls for outstanding game performances often cited in national and local media. Retiring from the Houston Oilers in 1976, Atkins pursued other opportunities.\nIn 1983, he became Head Women’s Basketball Coach and Assistant Football Coach at Sam Houston High School in Houston, Texas. Atkins accepted in 1984 the first of three major positions that he would hold at PVAMU: He was the Assistant Football Coach and Head Women’s Basketball Coach. Atkins resigned in 2005 from these positions and assumed the position of Director of Athletic Operations. He retired from PVAMU in August 2011.\nAtkins received recognition from Houston’s Third-Ward Community for his exemplary volunteer service rendered to the Professional United Leadership League (PULL). He worked seven years at PULL with inner-city teens for whom he was a big brother and counselor. He received the “L. J. Price School Athletic Alumni Award” at the school’s 2009 Second Annual Crimson Award Ceremony held in Atlanta, Georgia. He was commended for scholarly presentations in his fields of expertise at both state and national levels. He was also a member of the NFL Association. On July 8, 2017, Atkins was inducted into the Grambling Legends Hall of Fame. Atkins first marriage was to Norma Jo Wheeler. They had a son, Christopher E. Atkins. Atkins second marriage was to Dottie Winchester Malone Atkins. Atkins has four grandchildren; Tobias, Simeon, Moorea, and Harysn.\nAtkins died on September 22, 2020, at the age of 74."

Hall played 41 games across five seasons in the NHL, with the rest of his career coming in the minor leagues and in Europe. After retiring in 1996 he took up coaching and later became general manager for several clubs, with his longest tenure coming with the Tulsa Oilers of the Central Hockey League and later ECHL, from 2008 until 2019.\nHall is not related to the current player of the same name.\nPlaying career.\nHall played his junior hockey with the Regina Pats of the Western Hockey League, and was selected 116th overall in the 1982 NHL Entry Draft by the Vancouver Canucks. By the 1983–84 season he was dominating the WHL and finished the year with 63 goals and 142 points, good for fourth in the league. He also made his NHL debut, appearing in four games for the Canucks and scoring his first NHL goal.\nConsidered one of Vancouver's top young prospects, Hall cracked the Canucks' roster out of training camp for the 1984–85 campaign and got off to a great start with five points in his first seven games. However, in an October 23, 1984 game against the New York Islanders, Hall crashed heavily into a goalpost and blew out his left knee. The injury ended his season, and his career never really regained the momentum it had previously.\nHall returned for the 1985–86 season, but spent most of the year in the minors. When recalled to Vancouver, he performed well with 5 goals and 10 points in 19 games. However, by the 1986–87 season he had fallen down the team's depth chart, appearing in just four games, and he was released at the end of the season.\nFor the 1987–88 season, Hall signed with the Boston Bruins and turned in a strong 74-point effort for the Maine Mariners of the American Hockey League, earning him a 7-game callup to Boston. However, it would be his final taste of NHL hockey, as he would spend most of the next season in Italy. After bouncing between Europe and the International Hockey League for a few seasons, he signed with the Tulsa Oilers of the Central Hockey League, where he spent four solid seasons before retiring in 1996.\nDuring his career, Hall appeared in 41 NHL games, recording 7 goals and 9 assists for 16 points along with 29 penalty minutes. Following his playing career Hall moved into coaching, and has coached several franchises in the CHL and WPHL. He is currently serving as the General Manager of his last professional club as a player, the Tulsa Oilers."

        "text": "Stephen Bradley Dillard (born February 8, 1951) is an American former professional baseball player and manager. He played eight seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Boston Red Sox, Detroit Tigers, Chicago Cubs, and Chicago White Sox. Dillard, a reserve infielder, played mainly as a second baseman.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Memphis, Tennessee, Steve Dillard was raised in Saltillo, Mississippi. He played shortstop for Saltillo High School. Dillard was drafted by the San Diego Padres in the 13th round of the 1970 Major League Baseball draft, but did not sign as he had been awarded a full scholarship to the University of Mississippi. After two years of college, he was drafted by the Boston Red Sox in the second round of the 1972 MLB draft.\nPlaying career.\nBoston Red Sox (1972–1977).\nDillard began his professional career in 1972 playing for the Winston-Salem Red Sox of the Class A Carolina League, with whom he played the entirety of the 1973 season. After recovering from offseason shoulder surgery, Dillard was assigned to the Double-A Bristol Red Sox of the Eastern League for 1974. After approximately one month, he was promoted to the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox in the International League.\nThough having started the 1975 season at Triple-A, more shoulder problems in the first half resulted in a rehab assignment at Double-A. Dillard was called up to the Boston Red Sox in the final week of the season. He made his major league debut on September 28, scoring two runs on two hits and stealing a base.\nHe began the 1976 campaign with Boston, but was sent down to the Triple-A Rhode Island Red Sox for two months in an attempt to convert him to second, where as he had primarily played as a shortstop up until this time. While in Boston, Dillard became a valuable backup for second baseman Denny Doyle, and eventually for shortstop Rick Burleson and third baseman Butch Hobson. Dillard played the entire 1977 season with Boston, but saw little playing time. Across three seasons with the Red Sox, he appeared in 124 games, including 63 at second base, 21 at shortstop, 18 at third base, and 13 as a designated hitter.\nDetroit Tigers (1978).\nAfter the Red Sox acquired second baseman Jerry Remy from the California Angels, Dillard was sent to the Detroit Tigers in exchange for two minor leaguers and cash considerations on January 30, 1978. He provided solid support for young infielders Lou Whitaker (second base) and Alan Trammell (shortstop) for a full year. He appeared in 54 games, including 41 at second base, for the Tigers in 1978.\nChicago Cubs (1979–1981).\nDuring 1979's spring training, he was traded to the Chicago Cubs for a player to be named later (Ed Putman). His most productive season came in his first year at Chicago, when he hit a career-high .283 batting average with five home runs and 31 runs in 89 games played. The following season, he posted career-numbers in games (100), hits (55), and RBI (27). He played three seasons with the Cubs, appearing in 242 games, including 130 at second and 67 at third.\nChicago White Sox (1982).\nDillard was released by the Cubs after the 1981 season, and he later signed as a free agent with the Chicago White Sox for 1982. He played the majority of the season with the Triple-A Edmonton Trappers of the Pacific Coast League, but was called up for 16 games, all at second base, near the season's end. He was released after the season.\nIn an eight-season career, Dillard was a .243 hitter (246-for-1013) with 13 home runs and 102 RBI in 438 games, including 148 runs, 50 doubles, 6 triples, and 15 stolen bases.\nManagerial career.\nFollowing his playing retirement, Dillard started a managing career in the Chicago White Sox minor league system. In 1983 and 1984, he managed their rookie Gulf Coast League White Sox. He was reassigned to the Double-A Glens Falls White Sox of the Eastern League for 1985, but returned to the GCL White Sox in 1986 and 1987. He managed the Class A South Bend White Sox in the Midwest League in 1988.\nFrom 1989 to 1990, Dillard worked for the Houston Astros as their Minor League Infield Instructor. He continued in the Astros organization as manager of the Class A Short Season Auburn Astros of the New York–Penn League (1991–1992) and Quad Cities River Bandits of the Midwest League (1993–1994). In 1995, he was the hitting coach for the Chicago Cubs' Class A Rockford Cubbies in the Midwest League.\nAfter taking time off to see his children play baseball in high school, he returned to baseball in 2000 as skipper of the Jackson DiamondKats of the independent Texas-Louisiana League. In 2006, he joined the St. Louis Cardinals organization. He served as hitting coach for the Quad Cities Swing/River Bandits from 2006 to 2007, but was moved up to coach hitters with their Class A-Advanced Palm Beach Cardinals in the Florida State League during the 2007 season. He returned to Quad Cities as their manager in 2008 and 2009.\nPersonal life.\nHis son, Tim Dillard, a right-handed sidearm pitcher, has appeared in Major League Baseball for the Milwaukee Brewers.\nExternal links.\n or Retrosheet"

        "text": "The Italy women's national rugby union team () are the national women's rugby union team that represents Italy at international level.\nIt has been administered by the Italian Rugby Federation since 1991; previously, since its inception in 1985 up to 1991, it was administered by UISP – Unione Italiana Sport Popolari (Italian Union for People's Sports), an association which promotes amateur sports at every level of the society. The team competes in the Rugby World Cup, the Rugby Europe Women's Championship and the Women's Six Nations Championship.\nHistory.\nOn June 22, 1985 the Italian women's national team made their international debut against France. The match ended 0–0, they played again a year later in Bardos, with France winning 12–0. Italy scored their first points in their third match against France when the two neighbors met in Rome in 1987, France won 16–4.\nIn 1988 Italy participated in the first European championship organized in Bourg-en-Bresse in France by the local women's club. In addition to the hosts, the other two participants were Great Britain and the Netherlands. Italy finished last with three losses. The inaugural edition of this championship, while significant for being the first competition for women's national teams, was never recognized as official by FIRA.\nItalian Rugby Federation entry.\nIn 1991 the management of women's rugby was handed over to the Italian Rugby Federation. Their first commitment was the selection of the team for the inaugural edition of the World Cup which was held in April of that same year in Wales. The Azzurre, after having finished last in their pool, were placed in the Plate quarter-finals. They had their first victory in the tournament after defeating Sweden 18–0 in the Plate quarter-final but lost to Canada 6–0 in the Plate semi-final.\nThe progress of the national team was slow. In their first 15 years of existence, up to the end of 2000, they played in only 33 official matches. In 1995 they came third in the European championship organized at home in Treviso, a result equaled one year later in Madrid, Spain. After a first round elimination with a sixth place finish at the 1997 European Championship, they finished 12th at the 1998 Women's Rugby World Cup in the Netherlands.\nThey finished 7th at the 1999 European Championship and 8th in 2001. They won their first Nations Cup title in Veneto in 2002 ahead of the Rugby World Cup, in which Italy finished in twelfth place. Italy won the 2005 European Championship which was held in Hamburg in Germany. In the 2006 Nations Cup Italy successfully defended their title.\nAdmission to the Six Nations.\nIn December 2006, the Executive Committee of the Six Nations decided to align the composition of all competitions of the tournament with the men's, which included England, Wales, Ireland, Scotland, France and Italy; at the time the only difference with the women's tournament was the presence of Spain, which the committee replaced with Italy starting in 2007.\nRecords.\nOverall.\n\"See: List of Italy women's national rugby union team matches\"\n\"(Full internationals only)\"\n&lt;br&gt;\"Correct as of 11 February 2023\"&lt;br&gt;\nPlayers.\nCurrent squad.\nItaly's 31-player squad was announced on 11 March for the 2024 Women's Six Nations Championship.\nAward winners.\nWorld Rugby Awards.\nThe following Italy players have been recognised at the World Rugby Awards since 2001:"

Merritt led Jackson State to back-to-back appearances in the Orange Blossom Classic in 1961 and 1962 before being hired by what was then Tennessee A&amp;I. At Tennessee State (as Tennessee A&amp;I was renamed in 1968), Merritt had four undefeated seasons, claimed four Midwest Athletic Association titles, seven black college football national championships: (1965, 1966, 1970, 1971, 1973, 1979 and 1982) and earned the school's first-ever NCAA Division I-AA playoff victory in 1982.\nMerritt coached many players who went on to the National Football League (NFL), including Ed \"Too Tall\" Jones, Joe Gilliam, Claude Humphrey, Mike Hegman, and Richard Dent.\nHis coaching record at Tennessee State was 172–33–7 with an .828 winning percentage—far and away the best in program history.\nDeath and honors.\nMerritt died on December 15, 1983, at Vanderbilt University Hospital in Nashville, Tennessee, after suffering from heart disease.\nJohn Merritt Boulevard in Nashville, Tennessee is named in his honor. The Tennessee State football team usually opens every home season with the John Merritt Classic game at Nissan Stadium, traditionally against Alabama A&amp;M University, but more recently the game has also headlined other from other universities."

He was born at Edgeley House, Stockport, Cheshire, and was known as Dick. He went to Rugby School in Rugby, Warwickshire where he was Captain of Rugby in 1857. The following extract is from the \"First 125 years Liverpool Football Club Rugby Union 1857–1982\" by I R A Daglish.\nIn the Autumn of 1857, Frank Albert Mather, who had recently left Rugby School, wrote to his friend Richard Sykes the Captain of Football at Rugby School inviting him to take part in a game of football in Liverpool and bring with him one of the balls in use at the school, made by Linden a Rugby bootmaker. The game was arranged for Saturday 19 December 1857 on the Liverpool Cricket Ground at Edgehill. Fifty players arrived and they decided to play Rugby versus the World. Liverpool club was founded there and then.\nDick Sykes spent 18 months in Heidelberg, Paris and Geneva. He returned to England and helped to form the Manchester Football Club in 1860, being the club's first Captain. He was a partner in a textile firm in Manchester 'Callender, Sykes &amp; Mather' until it failed in 1878. Then he went to America and over the years acquired considerable land holdings. He continued to live in England, but made annual trips to the States where he founded and named five North Dakota towns,\nHe introduced rugby football to colleges and universities in the west of America and also introduced golf links to the northwest\nIn 1904, at the age of 65 he married Fanny Elizabeth Walton of Broughton, Salford, and sailed for the United States on their wedding day to make their future home, settling at Montecito, California. They had two sons. Sykes was the brother of Thomas Hardcastle Sykes and uncle of Sir Alan Sykes, 1st Baronet MP for Knutsford, Cheshire, and Sir Percy Sykes the geographer and explorer of central Asia."

The current format of the league consists of three divisions of six to eight teams, playing each other once at \"home\" and once \"away\". Matches were played in a timed format until 1949 but are now scheduled to start at 6.30 pm, and are limited to sixteen overs per side, with no bowler permitted to bowl more than four overs. The evening format means that matches may be played during the week after work; many teams represent workplaces in and around the city of Southampton. \nThe league is won by the team with the highest average points total, rather than overall points or wins, given the nature of the team composition, availability of pitches and the great British weather means that not all fixtures can be fulfilled.\nMatches are played at various sites around the city, including Southampton Sports Centre, Riverside Park &amp; Millbrook. As of 30 May 2012, matches have been temporarily moved away from the league's most famous venue - Hoglands Park.\nThere are also 2 Cup competitions - the Presidents Cup and the Harold Diaper Trophy. An indoor league also runs during the winter months, although not all teams play in both versions of the league.\nFamous players.\nSeveral notable Test and county cricketers have played in the league, including Robin Smith, Kevin Shine, Gary Brent and Adrian Aymes.\nOther famous players in the league include footballers Matt Le Tissier, Kevin Keegan, Ted Drake, Ted Bates &amp; Jason Dodd."

After his playing career, he became a television and radio broadcaster.\nCollege.\nBauer helped the Cal Lutheran Kingsmen reach the NAIA Championship of 1975 in his final year. He held CLU records for career carries (502), touchdowns in a game (4), a season (17) and a career (38), as well as yards in a season (1,024) and a career (2,700). He played for the Kingsmen team from 1972 to 1975 and holds the third-highest career rushing total (2,659) and all-purpose yards (2,998) in the university's history. He remains the only Cal Lutheran running back to rush for four touchdowns twice in a game.\nProfessional career.\nDallas Cowboys.\nAfter graduating California Lutheran University, Bauer signed as a free agent in 1976 with the Dallas Cowboys only to be cut three weeks into training camp.\nSan Diego Chargers.\nBauer was picked up in 1977 by the San Diego Chargers and went on to a distinguished playing and broadcasting career, entirely in San Diego. Bauer was honored in November 2009 as one of the 50 Greatest Chargers in team history as part of the Chargers' 50th Anniversary season celebration held at a large outdoor ceremony in downtown San Diego. Bauer also developed as a noted media spokesman during his career and went on to TV sportscasting as well as radio.\nBauer holds the NFL single-season record for most special-teams tackles with 52. As a short-yardage specialist and often referred to \"Hank the Howitzer\" for his explosive running style, Bauer finished one season with 18 carries for a total of 28 yards, scoring eight touchdowns and achieving nine first downs.

        "title": "Carlos Santana (baseball)",
        "text": "Carlos Santana (born April 8, 1986), nicknamed \"Slamtana,\" is a Dominican-American professional baseball first baseman for the Minnesota Twins of Major League Baseball (MLB). He made his MLB debut in 2010 with the Cleveland Indians and has also played for the Philadelphia Phillies, Kansas City Royals, Seattle Mariners, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Milwaukee Brewers. In international competition, he has participated with the Dominican Republic national team, winning the gold medal in the 2013 World Baseball Classic (WBC). Noted for plate discipline and power, Santana has also emerged as an excellent defender at first base. He stands tall, weighs , throws right-handed and is a switch hitter.\nEach season since 2011 (with the exception of the shortened 2020 season), Santana has hit at least 18 home runs while finishing within the top four in the league in bases on balls. He was named an MLB All-Star in 2019, has twice participated in the MLB Japan All-Star Series, and in 2017, was recognized as Wilson Defensive Player of the Year at first base. Santana set Indians' club records among switch hitters for both home runs in a career and in a single season, and for career runs batted in (RBIs). Over consecutive minor league seasons spanning 2008–2009, he won Most Valuable Player Awards (MVPs), first of the High-A California League, and then of the AA Eastern League. He was also named High A Player of the Year in 2008, Indians' Minor League Player of the Year in 2009, and the Indians' top prospect in 2009 and 2010.\nA native of Santo Domingo, Santana first joined the professional ranks when he signed as an amateur free agent with the Los Angeles Dodgers on August 13, 2004. He played in the Dodgers' minor league system until July 26, 2008, when he was traded to the Indians. He primarily split his time between catcher and first base through the 2013 season, and since has played mainly first base and designated hitter, and some third base. Prior to the 2018 season, Santana became a free agent and signed with the Philadelphia Phillies for three years. After one season, he was traded to the Seattle Mariners, and then back to Cleveland in the same offseason. He signed with the Kansas City Royals at the conclusion of his contract, and was traded to Seattle during the 2022 season.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Santo Domingo, Santana has five sisters and two brothers. Their parents began divorce proceedings when he was 15 years old. Santana and his sisters lived with his mother after the divorce, which afforded him the opportunity to play baseball, meanwhile emerging as a father figure to his sisters. He played baseball with his neighbors in a 5-on-5 format, and, instead of swinging with bats, they used baseball caps. After signing with the Los Angeles Dodgers, Santana received a bonus worth $75,000, taking a part of the money to buy his mother a house.\nProfessional career.\nMinor leagues.\nSantana signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2005. He began his professional baseball career with the Gulf Coast Dodgers, the rookie level minor league affiliate. He played 32 games in 2005 and batted .295. He played primarily at third base, while also appearing at catcher, second base, in left field and in right field.\nOn July 26, 2008, the Dodgers traded Santana and pitcher Jon Meloan to the Cleveland Indians for third baseman Casey Blake. Santana appeared in 130 games combined in 2008 with the Akron Aeros, Inland Empire 66ers of San Bernardino, and Kinston Indians during the 2008 season, with the majority at San Bernardino and Kinston at the Class A-Advanced level, and played primarily catcher. On offense, he hit .326, amassed .431 on-base percentage (OBP), .568 slugging percentage (SLG), .999 on-base plus slugging (OPS), 125 runs scored, 21 home runs, collected 117 runs batted in (RBI), 89 bases on balls (BB) and 85 strikeouts. Santana was named California League Most Valuable Player (MVP). He also earned mention as Hi-A Player of the Year and made the Hi-A All-Star team, California League All-Star team, and \"Baseball America\"'s All-Star second team.\nEntering the 2009 season, Santana was \"Baseball America\"'s choice as the top prospect in the Indians organization. Assigned to the Aeros of the AA-level Eastern League, he played in 130 games, batted .290, 413 OBP, .530 SLG, 23 home runs, 90 BB and 83 strikeouts. Behind the plate, he placed fifth in the league with a 30 percent caught stealing clip while helping to lead the club to a Southern Division title. In the Eastern League All-Star Game, he was named the starting catcher for the Southern Division, and participated in the All-Star Futures Game at Busch Stadium in St. Louis. Santana also won the Eastern League MVP Award and was named the Indians' 2009 Minor League Player of the Year − also known as the \"Lou Boudreau Award\".\n\"Baseball America\" ranked Santana as the organization's top prospect for the second time entering the 2010 season. The club assigned him to the Triple-A Columbus Clippers, where he hit .316 with 13 home runs and 51 RBI in 57 games prior to his first major league callup.\nCleveland Indians.\n2010−11.\nThe Indians promoted Santana on June 11, 2010, to make his MLB debut. He batted third in the order, making him the first Tribe player to debut hitting third since Jim Norris in 1977, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. Santana recorded his first major league hit in his second game, on June 12, 2010, a two-out, two-RBI double in the second inning off Washington Nationals pitcher J. D. Martin. In his next at-bat, Santana hit his first major league home run to right field in the bottom of the fifth inning.\nOn August 2, 2010, Santana was injured in a game at Fenway Park while defending home plate against Boston Red Sox baserunner Ryan Kalish. While attempting to dislodge the ball from Santana's mitt, Kalish slid into his left knee, bending it to the side. Santana was unable to walk off the field and had to be removed on a cart. Tests revealed that Santana had a high grade sprain of his LCL and a hyperextension of his left knee. The injury ended Santana's rookie season.\nSantana started a triple play against the Chicago White Sox on April 3, 2011 with a diving catch off of an Alexei Ramírez bunt. On April 29, 2011 Santana hit his first major league grand slam, a walk-off to defeat the Detroit Tigers, 9−5.\nSantana finished 2011, which was his first full season in the major leagues, with 27 home runs, setting a club record for home runs hit by a switch hitter, and played 66 games at first base. He also hit 79 RBI, 35 doubles and added 97 walks. He was one of four hitters in 2011 to reach 25 home runs, 35 doubles, and 90 walks, joining Miguel Cabrera, Prince Fielder, and Joey Votto.\n2012.\nOn April 10, 2012, the Indians signed Santana to a five-year, $21 million contract with a club option for the 2017 season. In the eighth inning of a May 25 game versus the Chicago White Sox, Santana sustained a hit in the mask from a foul tip and was removed from the game due to experiencing dizziness. He was subsequently placed on the seven-day disabled list with a concussion. Heading into the All-Star break, Santana was hitting .221, five home runs and 30 RBI in 69 games. Manager Manny Acta spoke of the hopes the Indians had for their catcher but admitted he was not hitting \"the way we expected him to hit.\"\nWhen Santana hit a home run in a July 18 game versus the Tampa Bay Rays, it was his first since May 15. He later added on a single and finished the game with a season-high four RBI, his first multi-RBI game since May 11. \"I know Santana feels so much better to get that monkey off his back. That power drought had been weighing on him\", Acta remarked after the game. Santana matched a career with five RBI in a September 23 game against the Kansas City Royals. He hit two home runs in the game, his third career multi-home run game and first of the season since April 8.\n2013−2016.\nIn 2013, Santana and the newly-promoted Yan Gomes split the catching duties nearly evenly, with Santana seeing significant time at first base and designated hitter when Gomes was catching. With the emergence of Gomes' defensive prowess, Santana saw less and less time at catcher.\nSantana started 2014 playing primarily third base, a position he had not played since single-A, with some time at catcher. After a stint on the 7-day concussion DL in early June, he played exclusively at first base for the remainder of the season and into 2015. In 2014, he reached a career-high 113 walks while also leading the major leagues, and placed tenth in the AL with 241 times on base. He became the first switch hitter since Lance Berkman in 2004 to achieve at least 25 home runs with 100 walks in the same season, and the fifth Indians switch hitter to do accordingly.\nOn September 21, 2016, Santana hit his 150th career home run, doing so against the Kansas City Royals. During the regular season, Santana batted .259, 34 home runs, 87 RBI and .865 OPS. He produced 30 home runs and 68 RBI when batting left handed. Santana homered twice in the 2016 American League Championship Series versus the Toronto Blue Jays. He also recorded the final out of the Series by catching a Troy Tulowitzki pop-up in foul territory, sending the Indians to the World Series. The Chicago Cubs defeated Cleveland in the World Series in seven games. The Indians exercised their $12 million option for 2017.\n2017.\nAfter the Indians acquired Edwin Encarnación in free agency prior to the 2017 season, he took over as the team's designated hitter, and Santana played primarily first base. During the first 84 games of the season, he hit .238 with 10 home runs. In August and September, the club won an American League-record 22 games in a row, and Santana hit .365/.484/.689 during the streak. He had hit 13 home runs and 313/.429/.596 through that point in the second half of the season. On September 10 versus the Baltimore Orioles, he drove in his 585th run, passing Omar Vizquel as the Indians' career RBI leader among switch hitters. Overall in 2017, he batted .259/.363/.445, 112 OPS+, 90 runs scored, 23 home runs, 79 RBI, 88 BB, 94 strikeouts, and five stolen bases.\nSantana placed fourth in the AL in walks and seventh in times on base (242). With significant improvement on defense, he led AL first basemen in total zone runs (13) and assists (95), was second in double plays (129), fourth in putouts (1,055), and fifth in fielding percentage (.996). The Indians won an AL-best 102 games for the regular season, but were defeated by the wild-card qualifying New York Yankees in the ALDS. He won his first career Wilson Defensive Player of the Year Award at first base, given to the top defensive player in the major leagues at each position. He was also named a finalist for the American League Rawlings Gold Glove Award at first base.\nPhiladelphia Phillies.\nOn November 2, 2017, Santana filed for free agency. On December 20, he signed a three-year contract with the Philadelphia Phillies that included a team option for the 2021 season. The value of the three guaranteed seasons was $60 million. Santana reached 1,000 hits for his career on April 7, 2018, with a three-run home run in a 20−1 win versus the Miami Marlins at Citizens Bank Park. For the season, he batted .229 and had the lowest batting average on balls in play (.231) of all major league players, and was second in the major leagues in walks per strikeout (1.18). He placed second in the National League in walks (110), hit 24 home runs, 86 RBI, and scored 82 runs.\nIn March 2019, ESPN.com reported that, in September 2018, Santana, frustrated with the team's nonchalance amidst a long losing streak, destroyed a television with a bat in the team's clubhouse at Citizens Bank Park because teammates had been using it to play \"Fortnite\" during games.\nReturn to Cleveland.\nOn December 3, 2018, the Phillies traded Santana and J. P. Crawford to the Seattle Mariners for Jean Segura, Juan Nicasio, and James Pazos. In a three-team transaction ten days later, the Mariners traded Santana with cash to the Indians, the Indians sent Encarnación and a competitive balance draft pick to the Mariners, Yandy Díaz and Cole Sulser to the Tampa Bay Rays, and the Rays traded Jake Bauers to Cleveland.\nSantana hit the 200th home run of his career on April 28, 2019, versus Wade Miley of the Houston Astros. Selected by fan voting in 2019 to his first career MLB All-Star Game, Santana was named the starting first baseman for the American League. He and Indians were hosts for the event played at Progressive Field and he batted cleanup. Santana also competed in the Home Run Derby. On August 11 versus the Minnesota Twins, he hit a game-winning grand slam in a 7–3 outcome to tie the Indians and Twins for first place. The following night, Santana hit a walk-off home run at Progressive Field to defeat the Boston Red Sox, 6–5, that allowed the Indians to reclaim sole possession of first place in the AL Central for the first time since the previous April. Through August 15, Santana homered five time times in the seventh inning or later to give the Indians a lead.\nOverall with the 2020 Cleveland Indians, Santana batted .199/.349/.350 with 8 home runs and 30 RBIs in 60 games, and led the American League in walks, with 47. The Indians declined their club option on Santana's contract for the 2021 season on October 30, 2020, making Santana a free agent.\nKansas City Royals.\nOn December 8, 2020, Santana signed a two-year, $17.5 million contract with the Kansas City Royals. He was immediately inserted into the Royals lineup at first base; no player had started more than 55% of the team's games in a season at first base since Eric Hosmer left the franchise after the 2017 season. Santana made 136 starts at first base during the 2021 season, and in 158 games overall, he hit .214/.319/.342 with 19 HR and 69 RBI for a career-low OPS+ of 80. His wRC+ of 83 was 7th-worst in the league among qualified hitters, although it was better than two of his Royals teammates. His 86 walks were good for sixth in the American League, and he did play a portion of the season with a leg injury, although he was never placed on the injured list.\nSantana remained the Royals first baseman entering the 2022 season. The Royals were 26-45 at the time of his trade away from the organization, and Santana was hitting .216/.349/.341 with 4 HR and 21 RBI in 52 games, although in a season in which league-wide offensive numbers were down, his OPS+ was at 98.\nSeattle Mariners.\nOn June 27, 2022, the Royals traded Santana to the Mariners for pitcher Wyatt Mills and minor-leaguer William Fleming.\nPittsburgh Pirates.\nOn November 29, 2022, Santana signed a one year deal with the Pittsburgh Pirates. \nOn June 30, 2023, in a game against the Milwaukee Brewers, Santana hit a walk off two run home run into the Allegheny River to win it 8-7. It was the 69th home run hit into the Allegheny River in the history of PNC Park. \nMilwaukee Brewers.\nOn July 27, 2023, the Pirates traded Santana to the Milwaukee Brewers in exchange for minor-league shortstop Jhonny Severino. On September 23, Santana hit his 300th career home run off of A. J. Puk of the Miami Marlins. In 52 games for Milwaukee, he batted .249/.314/.459 with 11 home runs and 33 RBI. He became a free agent following the season.\nMinnesota Twins.\nOn February 7, 2024, Santana signed a one-year, $5.25 million contract with the Minnesota Twins.\nInternational career.\nSantana represented the Dominican Republic national team at the World Baseball Classic in 2013 and 2017. They won the gold medal for the 2013 championship, defeating Puerto Rico 3–0 in the final. In the MLB Japan All-Star Series, he played for the United States in the 2014 and 2018 editions.\nPlayer profile.\nSantana is known by the nicknames \"Slamtana,\" \"Axeman\", and \"El Oso\" (\"The Bear\" in Spanish). He carries himself with a reserved demeanor, typically reticent to talk about his achievements and instead deflecting credit to his teammates. In 2019, Santana raised his batting average to above his career high by hitting the ball the other way more frequently.\nUntil spring training of the 2019 season, Santana did not have an established routine, he stated. It was during that period that Indians assistant hitting coach Vic Rodriguez urged him to do so, because \"if you have a consistent routine that works for you and you stick to it every day regardless of how good or bad a season you’re having, you’re going to be fine.\" The approach was designed to hit the ball with more hard contact up the middle, rather than attempt to continuously pull it, helping to significantly improve in virtually every category. He maintained better focus and increased his ability to shorten slumps. Commented longtime teammates Francisco Lindor, \"[h]e’s always been a good player, but his mental preparation is a lot better this year. ... [H]e would have just two at-bats [a game]. He would have two good at-bats and the rest, whatever. Now he has three to five good at-bats.\"\nThird baseman José Ramírez noticed a more relaxed approach. \"When he was first with us, his attitude was different, especially when things weren’t going well for him, it was very different. He’s changed. He doesn’t worry as much. He works, he knows what he has to do. I think it’s maturity and time, too. Maybe he learned from the rough year he had in Philadelphia.\"\nSantana wears the number 41 in honor of Victor Martinez, who is also a former switch-hitting catcher who started his career with the Cleveland Indians.\nPersonal life.\nSantana is married and his family resides in Cleveland. They maintained the same residence in Cleveland while he played for Philadelphia in the 2018 season. He mentioned that he considered the local police and a young boy with cerebral palsy named Niko Lanzarotta–whom he also named as his best friend in Cleveland–as part of his family.\nOn April 19, 2019, Santana became a naturalized United States citizen."

        "text": "Tiffany Jackson-Jones (April 26, 1985 – October 3, 2022) was an American basketball player and coach. She played college basketball for the Texas Longhorns, earning All-American honors. Jackson played professionally in the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) for the New York Liberty, Tulsa Shock, and Los Angeles Sparks. She also played in the Israeli Premier League for Maccabi Ashdod. She later returned to Texas as an assistant coach for the Longhorns.\nEarly life.\nJackson was born in Longview, Texas, on April 26, 1985. She began her high school career at Lincoln High in Dallas, where she led the school to consecutive appearances in the Class 4A state championship game in her sophomore and junior years. Jackson transferred to Duncanville High School in Duncanville as a senior and won a Class 5A state title. She was named an All-American by McDonald's and the Women's Basketball Coaches Association.\nCollege career.\nJackson enrolled at the University of Texas at Austin and played college basketball for the Texas Longhorns. In 2004, the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA) named her the Freshman of the Year. As a sophomore in 2006, Jackson was named a first-team college All-American by the USBWA and was selected to the third team by the Associated Press (AP). She received honorable mention as an All-American from the AP in both her junior and senior years. She earned all-conference honors in the Big 12 in all four seasons, including first-team selections in her last three seasons.\nProfessional career.\nThe New York Liberty of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) selected Jackson in the first round, with the fifth overall selection, of the 2007 WNBA draft. Jackson made her WNBA debut on May 20, 2007, in an 83–71 win over the Chicago Sky. During her rookie season, she led the league in games played (34). She later finished fourth in total rebound percentage (17.5) and fifth in defensive rebound percentage (23.6) the following year. On June 14, 2010, the Liberty traded Jackson to the Tulsa Shock for Plenette Pierson. In the 2011 season, Jackson had her best pro season, averaging 12.4 points and 8.4 rebounds with the Shock. She again led the league in games played (34) and finished second in minutes played (1152) and offensive rebounds (100), third in minutes per game (33.9), fourth in total rebounds (286) and rebounds per game (8.4), and fifth in defensive rebounds (186).\nWhile playing for Tulsa in September 2015, Jackson was diagnosed with stage III breast cancer. After undergoing treatment, Jackson resumed her career with the Maccabi Ashdod in the Israeli Premier League, with whom she had been playing during the WNBA's offseason since 2013. She signed with the Los Angeles Sparks of the WNBA in February 2017.\nIn February 2018, Jackson re-signed with the Sparks. Although she intended to play one final season with Los Angeles, she retired from the WNBA in April 2018 to return to her alma mater and become an assistant on Longhorns head coach Karen Aston's staff. Jackson continued playing with Maccabi Ashdod until 2020. She finished her career with the club with multiple league championships, and led them to their best finish in the EuroCup in 2015, when they qualified for the semifinals.\nCoaching career.\nJackson spent four years as an assistant coach with Texas. In April 2022, she was announced as the new head coach for Wiley College.\nPersonal life.\nJackson was married to Derrick Jones. Their son was born in 2012.\nJackson died from breast cancer in Dallas on October 3, 2022. She was 37."

        "text": "Alan Stewart Cameron (18 November 1929 – 20 March 2010) was an Australian rugby union footballer of the 1950s and 60s. A State and national representative lock-forward he made twenty Test appearances and over fifty additional tour match appearances for the Wallabies, captaining the national side in four Tests matches.\nRugby career.\nCameron attended Newington College from 1945 to 1948 and was selected in the GPS combined team in 1946 and 1947. After school he joined the St George Rugby Union Football Club and would go on to play 266 games for the club. In his debut year in grade and after only five club matches he was selected in the New South Wales Waratahs side to meet Queensland in the annual inter-state series. He made twenty-six State representative appearances between 1948 and 1957.\nHe made his international representative debut for the Wallabies against the All Blacks in Sydney in June 1951 debuting alongside other future Test captains in Dick Tooth and Keith Winning and played in all three Tests of that series. For the next five-year he was an automatic selection in Australian Test sides and touring squads and he formed a formidable second-row partnership with Nick Shehadie controlling the Australian line-out and ever working hard in the tight forward play. He toured New Zealand twice (1952 and 1955), South Africa in 1953 and Europe and America on the 1957–58 Australia rugby union tour of Britain, Ireland and France. He usually played in a high proportion of all the tour matches as well as the Tests. At home he played in Test series against visiting All Blacks sides in 1951 and 1957, Fiji in 1952 and 1954 and the South Africa in 1956.\nCaptaincy.\nOn the 1952 tour to New Zealand he played in nine of the total ten matches including both Tests. At aged twenty-two he was honoured with the Australian captaincy in a mid-week match against King Country. In South Africa in 1953 he played in sixteen tour matches as well as the four Tests, captaining Australia twice in tour matches. On the 1955 New Zealand tour he played in twelve of the thirteen total matches and was formally recognised as the squad's vice-captain under John Solomon. After Solomon suffered an injury, Cameron debuted as Australian Test captain in the second Test at Dunedin in September 1955. He held the captaincy for the third Test which saw a Wallaby victory at Eden Park. In 1956 when the Springboks visited Australia for a two Test series he was the captain for both. He made a further Test appearance against Ireland in 1957 and then was one of the senior players selected for the 1957–58 Wallaby tour. Tony Miller's form was on the ascendancy at that time and Cameron held his Test lock position for only the Test against Ireland, but he played in twenty-one other matches of the forty-match tour and captained the side in seven of those."

The event featured the top 12 ranked players from the PDC and BDO, seven world champions (including both incumbents) and 23 world title winners – making it possibly the strongest field assembled since the split in 1992/93. \nRaymond van Barneveld, the PDC World Champion, was beaten in the first round by fellow countryman Jelle Klaasen. The BDO World Champion Martin Adams fell at the quarter-final stage to Andy Hamilton. The final featured Gary Anderson against Phil Taylor. Taylor wasn't able to successfully defend his title despite hitting 17 maximum 180s in the final. Both players averaged over 100 in an excellent final – played over the same 13 set format as the BDO &amp; PDC World Finals. Anderson captured his second major title – adding to his International Darts League success back in May.\nQualified players.\nThe players in bold automatically qualify for the main stage and are seeded.

        "title": "Major League Baseball (video game)",
        "text": "Major League Baseball is a sports video game released in 1988 for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It is notable for being one of the first video games licensed by Major League Baseball, although it was not endorsed by the Major League Baseball Players Association. Without the backing of the Players Association, the game could not name the actual players, although it was able to use their numbers, thus accurately portraying the contemporary teams and their rosters. In doing so, it became the first baseball game for the Nintendo Entertainment System to carry official Major League Baseball licensing and lineups.\n\"Major League Baseball\" was developed by Atlus and published by LJN. It featured many facets of realistic gameplay and a focus on managerial details, which stressed the importance of choosing a well-balanced team. Despite its graphical limitations, it was considered a three-dimensional game at the time and was featured in the first issue of \"Nintendo Power\" as compared the system's other baseball games of the era.\nDevelopment.\nIn 1988 Atlus signed on to develop an \"official\" Major League Baseball game for the Nintendo Entertainment System, which would be a first for that particular console. American company LJN agreed to be the publisher and David Rolfe was brought on board as the game's programmer. Rolfe had previously worked with Activision and Intellivision.\nGameplay.\nOfficially licensed by Major League Baseball, the game features all twenty-six teams that existed in 1987. Additionally, the lineups and the player numbers are accurate to the team rosters that year. Since the game did not have the endorsement of the Major League Baseball Players Association at the time, the team members are only listed by number, not name. In addition to their numbers the players are represented by their statistics, abilities, throwing arm, and even placement in the batting order. 1988's \"Major League Baseball\" was therefore the first NES game to be officially endorsed by Major League Baseball and to feature accurate contemporary lineups, albeit without the actual player names attached to their numbers. \nManagerial decisions are a focus and game players are allowed to select their own lineups, although the game lacks Sabermetrics statistics due to the limitations of the era. Instead, the \"manager\" must make their decisions based on data such as player's average and home run totals. They also have the ability to change and decide who will be a pinch-hitter and who will be a substitute pitcher. One is even allowed to pick out a designated hitter. The game prohibits one from putting out more team members in a certain part of the field than would normally be allowed, which makes deciding which player will be used where a part of the experience.\nThere are three modes that can be played with teams from either the American League or the National League: regular season games, All-star games or the World Series (interleague). The World Series rounds, however, are only one match each, which is not accurate to the real World Series. Due to the licensing, the teams even appear complete in their official uniforms and colours and also have all the options that a real baseball player would have, including bunting, pitching out, base stealing and throwing errors.\nGameplay limitations.\nIn \"Major League Baseball\", the pitcher is unable to move around the pitcher's mound and many are also able to perform the feat of pitches. The ball's physics have been called into question, with the ball stopping on a dime after three or less bounces. The game's camera system does not function properly and, when a ball is hit, the outfield camera follows the ball looking upwards, making it impossible for the game player to see where their fielders are. The ball can also be thrown and get stuck in the well between the stands and the field on an overthrow of a baseman and cause inside the park home runs, which would not happen within a real game (in that case a ground rule double and/or error would be scored instead). Another bug allows players to go into the stands past the wall with the ball if they enter at certain points in foul territory. Each baseman is also controlled individually, allowing for user error in certain situations where a running baseman will be called out if the baseman ahead of them remains at their last base if the player fails to advance them.\nThere are also gameplay issues when the player takes their turn to bat. The AI is not developed and, when the player hits a pitch, it nearly always takes the longest possible route to the ball, making runs easier to score. It also lacks the capability to throw out a runner who is returning to a base (instead of advancing) or perform a double play after catching a fly ball. Furthermore, the batter can only move vertically, not horizontally, in the batter's box.\nTechnology.\nGraphics.\nThe graphics themselves were considered to be three-dimensional given the constraints of the technology at the time. Each player's batting stance is exactly the same. The game view is always top down; when batting or pitching, it is centered above the catcher, behind the batter and with an overhead look of the pitcher. In the outfield, there is an aerial view of a portion of the field, with the team members represented by tiny sprites and an inset with red dots representing where the players are on base. Although the official colors are intact, the actual symbols on their uniforms are absent. The crowd is represented by a series of colored dots, while the dugouts are represented by plain white parallelograms.\nMusic and sound effects.\nThere are a limited number of effects and, aside from brief ballpark jingles, there is no real background music present during the game. For example, the charge fanfare is played at random points and the introductory screen begins with a different baseball tune while the player is loading up and selecting his team, along with a home run fanfare. Generic sound effects include the bat cracking upon contact with the ball, the sound of the ball flying through the air during a pitch, bouncing and throwing effects, and a stream of crowd noises.\nReception.\n\"Major League Baseball\" was featured in the first issue of \"Nintendo Power\" and compared to \"R.B.I. Baseball\" and \"Bases Loaded\", although the magazine did not pass any judgment on which game was superior. Allgame rated it three stars out of five. The Los Angeles Times noted the game was a leading seller."

        "title": "Bill Reid (American football coach)",
        "text": "William Thomas Reid Jr. (October 25, 1878 – September 28, 1976) was an American football player and coach of Harvard's football team for the 1901, 1905, and 1906 seasons. Though his goal was to produce winning teams, mounting injuries and intensifying criticism of the game fueled demands for its abolition and pressured Reid into a leadership role in the momentous 1906 rule changes which defused this threat. He was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1970.\nEarly life and playing career.\nReid was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay area where his father, W. T. Reid, was head of a prep school. When he decided to attend Harvard University, he exhibited such athletic promise that he was actively recruited by both the football and baseball teams. He immediately proved himself to be an outstanding baseball catcher, starting his freshman year and then serving as captain of the university's championship teams his junior and senior years. In football, he started at fullback his sophomore year and scored two touchdowns in Harvard's momentous 1898 victory over Yale, its first since the initial meeting of the teams in 1875. Though injuries constrained his involvement with football over the following two seasons, the Boston Transcript later characterized him, in its account of his wedding, as \"one of the best athletes that ever came out [of Harvard].\"\nHarvard football coach.\nFollowing his graduation, Reid was appointed student coach of the football team, a long-standing practice whereby early teams selected a graduate player from the previous season to be its coach. Reid's 1901 team went undefeated and crushed Yale 22–0 in its final game. Afterwards, Reid accepted a teaching position at his father's school in order to provide financial support for his wife and family.\nEnsuing losses, especially ones to Yale, convinced the team and Harvard's Athletic Committee to dispense with student-amateur coaches in 1905 and to raise enough money to hire Reid, making him one of the game's first professional coaches. The conscientiousness with which Reid shouldered these responsibilities is reflected in his lengthy catalogues of notes. He devised both a weight training program and a special meal table. He improved equipment to reduce injuries and devised better treatment for them. He appointed a large staff of assistants so that every position got special instruction. Finally he made a concerted effort to turn his players into good students.\nGradual conversion to the cause of reform.\nReid also crafted his team's schedule so that its initial games were against weak opponents that gained the team easy victories and opportunities for improvement. However, off-field developments soon revealed that the fall of 1905 would not be a normal season. Several articles in major magazines complained about the rising number of injuries, the huge amounts of money pouring into the game, and widespread recruiting abuses. By October, President Theodore Roosevelt was sufficiently concerned about these criticisms that he summoned the coaches of the big three—Harvard, Yale, and Princeton—to a White House discussion of the situation and insisted that they sign an accord \"to carry out in letter and in spirit the rules of the game.\" Several weeks later, Reid learned that Charles Elliot, the President of Harvard, was urging his Board of Overseers to abolish football. Deciding that he needed to act, Reid gathered several supporters and drafted a public release to newspapers advocating that current rules of football be radically changed.\nReid was hoping that the season's end would quell these complaints and bring him a much needed rest, but it did not. Harvard lost its final game to Yale 6–0, the lone score coming late in the fourth quarter. This devastating loss infused a second quarter incident with a significance a Harvard victory would have trivialized. When a Harvard player fielded a punt, he was immediately hit high and low by two Yale tacklers, and fans attending the Cambridge event thought a penalty should have been called for unnecessary roughness. The Boston Globe exacerbated this belief with a front-page photograph of the controversial catch and an accompanying account which editorialized that the hit \"was certainly an instance of unnecessary roughness,\" despite its accompanying interview of Paul Dashiell, the head referee, who explained that a fair catch had never been signaled. Also on its front page that same day, the Globe reported that a Union College player had been killed in another game.\nPath to new rules.\nThe overlap of these developments produced a full-blown storm. The president of Columbia and his faculty voted to end its football program. The Chancellor of New York University proposed a meeting of representatives from colleges excluded from the big three's Intercollegiate Football Association to discuss the future of football. Meanwhile, Roosevelt summoned Reid to Washington to update him on matters since their previous meeting. The coach informed the President that Walter Camp, the architect of Yale's indomitable teams, opposed change and maintained control over IFA's rule committee via an alliance with Dashiell, who was a prominent member of the rule committee and was then on the faculty of the U.S.Naval Academy. The pair roughed out a strategy whereby Reid would meet with Harvard colleagues to complete a set of new rules and Roosevelt would pressure Dashiell into supporting them. This strategy was successfully implemented at a momentous, unanticipated amalgamation of the IFA and the fledgling alternative, a consolidation that originated today's NCAA. Reid pressured this consolidation by threatening to defect from the IFA to the new organization in order to accomplish substantial rule change. Harvard's Board of Overseers, strongly influenced by President Eliot, supported Reid's agenda with a vote to abolish its football team unless major reform was achieved.\nEnsuing approval of most of Reid's nineteen proposed changes included establishment of a \"neutral zone\" between the offensive and defensive lines. The offense was henceforth required to keep at least six men on the line of scrimmage and to make ten yards (rather than five) for a first down. The forward pass was legalized, though this revolutionary modification was delayed by an accompanying penalty for an incompletion.\nSubsequent career.\nReid craftily sought to confine his reform agenda to play itself. He especially did not want any alteration to the current eligibility of graduate students because he had been resourcefully capitalizing on Harvard's prestigious graduate schools to recruit older students whom he believed to be superior players. However, without apprising Reid of their intent, administrators from Harvard and Yale forged an agreement that banned graduate students from play. After all his work on behalf of reform, Reid felt betrayed and decided, even before it started, the following season would be his last. He produced another outstanding team that went undefeated until the final game against Yale and again lost 6–0. Afterward, Reid returned to teaching at his father's school. He soon moved back to Massachusetts to sell bonds for Dillon, Read &amp; Co. He was active in local politics in Brookline, Massachusetts, serving on the town's school committee for many years including a stint as chairman from 1933 to 1936."

        "text": "William Lucas Lush (November 10, 1873 – August 28, 1951) was an American baseball player and college athletics coach and administrator. He played seven seasons of Major League Baseball from 1895 to 1904, including three with the Washington Senators. He later worked as a college athletics coach (mostly baseball and basketball) at Yale University, Columbia University, Fordham University, the United States Naval Academy, St. John's University, the University of Baltimore and Trinity College, Hartford. He also held athletic director positions at Fordham and the Naval Academy. In the 1930s, he coached athletic teams at Sing Sing prison in Ossining, New York.\nEarly years.\nLush was born at Bridgeport, Connecticut in 1873. His father, Charles H. Lush, was a Massachusetts native who worked in a sewing machine factory. At the time of the 1880 United States Census, Lush, at age 7, was living in Bridgeport with his parents, Charles and Annie, and two younger brothers, Walter and George.\nBaseball player.\nLush played seven seasons of Major League Baseball with the Washington Senators (1895–1897), Boston Beaneaters (1901–1902), Detroit Tigers (1903), and Cleveland Naps (1904). He appeared in 489 major league games, including 461 as an outfielder. He had a career batting average of .249 and an on-base percentage of .360 (fueled by 291 walks in 2,096 plate appearances). Lush led the American League with 34 sacrifice hits for the Tigers in 1903. His .379 on-base percentage for the Tigers in 1903 was fourth best in the American League, and his 70 bases on balls was second best in the league. Lush was among the league leaders in walks four times. Lush was also a good fielder in the outfield. In 1902, Lush had 24 assists as the Beaneaters' center fielder, and a range factor of 2.37 (0.44 points higher than the league average). For the Tigers in 1903, Lush had a range factor of 2.42 (0.50 points higher than the league average).\nAthletic coach.\nAfter his playing career ended, Lush became a coach of college baseball and college basketball. He held coaching positions at Yale University, Columbia University, Fordham University, the United States Naval Academy, St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland, the University of Baltimore and Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut.\nLush began work as Yale's baseball coach in 1905, with Walter Camp serving as the team's advisory coach. In his first year, Lush led Yale to its first baseball championship in six years. Lush played for and managed the Plattsburgh minor league franchise in 1905 and 1906. One of his players in 1906 was Baseball Hall of Fame member Eddie Collins. In February 1906, Yale engaged him for a term of three years. He remained in charge of the Yale baseball team in 1906 and 1907, but he was replaced by Tad Jones in 1908. Yale decided not to retain Lush when the school decided to cease using professional coaches. As Lush had another year remaining on his contract, Yale paid him in full for his services.\nAfter separating from Yale, Lush coached the basketball team at the United States Naval Academy in the 1908–09 season. In February 1909, he was rehired as Yale's baseball coach. He remained the baseball coach at Yale through the 1911 season. He was dropped as Yale's baseball coach in August 1911.\nIn 1912, Lush was hired as the manager of the Montreal professional baseball team.\nIn 1914, Lush coached the baseball team at Columbia.\nIn the middle of the 1915 season, Lush took over as the coach of the baseball team at Fordham University. The team compiled an 8–2 record under Lush. In September 1915, he was hired as the physical director at Fordham. He assumed responsibility to oversee all branches of athletics at the school, including full responsibility for the baseball and track teams and assistant coaching duties with the football and crew programs. His contract stipulated, however, that he was allowed to coach that New York University basketball team in the winter of 1915–16. As permitted by his Fordham contract, Lush began coaching the NYU basketball team in November 1915.\nIn July 1916, Lush purchased a fifty percent interest in the baseball club at Bridgeport, Connecticut. He announced at the time that he would serve as the team's manager.\nIn November 1916, he was hired by the Naval Athletic Association to coach the baseball and basketball teams at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis. Lush's 1918–19 basketball team finished the season with a 16–0 record and was retroactively named the 1918–19 national champion by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll. In May 1922, Lush resigned his position at the Naval Academy. The press reported there was mutual dissatisfaction between Lush and the Navy Athletic Association.\nAfter leaving the Naval Academy, Lush coached the baseball and basketball teams at St. John's College in Maryland. By 1923, he had been placed in charge of athletics at St. John's. He was the basketball coach at St. John's through the 1926–27 season.\nIn October 1931, he was appointed as the head basketball coach at the University of Baltimore.\nFamily and later life.\nLush was married in approximately 1897 to Mary E. Lush (born September 1872), a fellow Connecticut native. They had five children, Mary (born c. 1900), Elizabeth (born c. 1901), William L., Jr. (born c. 1902), Frances A. (born c. 1904), Edward J. (born c. 1906).\nAt the time of the 1900 United States Census, Lush was living in New Haven, Connecticut with his wife, Mary, and their daughter, Mary. His occupation was listed as a baseball player.\nAt the time of the 1910 United States Census, Lush was living in New Haven and employed as a baseball coach.\nIn a draft registration card completed by Lush at the time of World War I, Lush indicated that his permanent residence was in New Haven, though he was employed as an athletic coach at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland.\nAt the time of the 1920 United States Census, Lush listed his residence as New Haven and his occupation as the \"physical director\" for the Naval Academy. His household at that time consisted of his wife, Mary, and four children, Elizabeth, William, Frances and Edward.\nAt the time of the 1930 United States Census, Lash was living in New Haven with his wife, Mary. His occupation was listed as a cigar maker in a cigar factory.\nIn the 1930s, Lush moved to Ossining, New York, where he coached athletic teams and assisted in the medical department at Sing Sing prison. He later operated a tea room and guest house in Ossining. In August 1951, Lush died at a convalescent home in Hawthorne, New York at age 77. He was survived by his second wife, Lillian Goodwin Lush, and six children."

It runs an annual national championship, and has hosted a number of international competitions.\nHistory.\nThe Cyprus Archery Federation was founded in 1972 but became active much later. In 1987 the Cyprus Archery Club (CAC) in Nicosia was founded later followed by Artemis and Kentavros clubs.\nOn April 8, 1989 the first Pancyprian Archery Tournament was held at Lapatsa Sporting Club using training bows at a distance of 30 m. One year later CAF held the international Tournament \"Theofanideia\" in memory of Stelios Theofanides, a major figure in Cypriot archery. Subsequently \"Theofanideia\" become an annual event that CAF holds every year at an international level archery tournament.\nSince 1991, the CAF runs a Pancyprian Championship in all age categories and disciplines. In 1993 the first beginners championship was held which was then renamed as the Academies Championship. The two championships are incorporated into the Federation's plans and the winners from each championship are awarded monetary prizes at the end of each championship year.\nIn 1993 CAF was awarded the first European Archery Grand Prix. It was the biggest athletic event ever held by the Federation and led to CAF organizing the same event in 1994. Since then it held the Grand Prix in 1999 with the participation of 180 athletes from 28 countries and in 2001 with the participation of 135 athletes from 20 countries. In 2007 the European Junior Championship was held in Limassol with the participation of 191 athletes from 18 countries.\nIn 1996 CAF held the first ever biannual European Small Nations Games. In 1998 they were held by San Marino, 2000 by Malta, 2002 by Luxembourg, 2004 by San Marino and in 2006 again by Cyprus as Monaco was unable to hold them.\nToday CAF has more than 1000 registered athletes from 22 Member Clubs. It enjoys recognition by the Cyprus Sports Organisation (KOA) and the Cyprus Olympic Committee (KOE). In addition to its activities at the competitive level, it supports training in coaching, judging and technical equipment setup. It is an active member of the International Archery Federation (FITA) and the European and Mediterranean Archery Union (EMAU).\nBoard of directors.\nElections held in March 2017 have resulted in a new board of directors with the following structure:"

        "title": "Craig Gerber (baseball)",
        "text": "Craig Stuart Gerber (born January 8, 1959) is an American former professional baseball player who played one season for the California Angels of Major League Baseball (MLB). He was a 20th round draft pick in the 1981 Major League Baseball draft. During his 65 games with the Angels he played in the field at shortstop, second and third base. He hit two home runs in a total of 1,662 minor league at bats.\nYouth and high school.\nBorn in Chicago, Illinois, Craig Gerber grew up in San Bernardino, California, where he was a standout in baseball and football. He attended San Bernardino's Cajon High School and was the first Cajon graduate to become a professional athlete. A left-hand hitting, right-handed infielder, Gerber was a three-year varsity starter in baseball, being selected to all-state teams twice and ending his senior season with a .528 batting average. In football, Gerber quarterbacked Cajon's varsity football team for two years, after seeing varsity playing time in his sophomore year. Gerber's arrival would eventually help transform the young school's run-heavy offense into a stronger dual threat, with the new passing element being described at the end of Gerber's senior season as, \"the most prolific passing attack in San Bernardino County.\" Following a 2-7 season, Cajon finished Gerber's junior year at 6-4, and his senior year at 8-3. Cajon's first-ever state playoff berths for football and baseball were in Gerber's junior year - a year that began with Gerber suffering a broken collarbone in its first football game. In his senior year, Gerber received an honorable mention in the \"Joe Namath National Prep Sports Magazine\" for 1977, and won Cajon's Ken Hubbs Award (with the overall award going to future Professional Football Hall of Fame player Ronnie Lott).\nThe Cajon baseball program recognizes exceptional infield play with its annual Craig Gerber Award for Best Infielder.\nCollege.\nGerber attended college as a business major at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, playing baseball from 1978 to 1981 for coach Berdy Harr and serving as team captain his senior year. Gerber was awarded a full four-year athletic scholarship to Cal Poly SLO, and was the only baseball player his freshman year so awarded, with the rest going to junior college transfer players. Gerber's college years included two seasons (1978 and 1979) with the Clarinda (Iowa) A's summer amateur baseball club, and one year (1981) with the Santa Maria (California) Indians semi-pro baseball team.\nA flexible multi-position infielder, Gerber took over the position of shortstop his freshman year at Cal Poly SLO from future Baseball Hall of Fame player Ozzie Smith (who graduated in 1977), was awarded the Robert Mott Award for top freshman baseball player, and was selected all-California Collegiate Athletic Association first team at second base his sophomore year.\nNear the end of Gerber's senior year, Harr was quoted saying, \"[Gerber has] thrown better, hit better and run better than Ozzie did when he was here. I have as much confidence of Craig being a success in the big leagues as I did of Ozzie when he was leaving.\"\nMinor leagues.\nGerber's first stretch in the professional baseball minor leagues included stops in Idaho Falls (Idaho), Redwood City (California), Nashua (New Hampshire), and Edmonton (Alberta ,Canada). Gerber's flexibility and dependability in the infield (leading three different minor leagues in fielding at three different infield positions) continued to serve notice for major league attention and consideration as he played regularly at second base, third base and shortstop, and even spent time at catcher and left field. In Redwood City (1981), Gerber set the league record (23) for double plays by a third baseman in a season, a record that stands as of May, 2021. \nIn Edmonton, Gerber was awarded the Rawlings Silver Glove Award for 1984, finishing with the best fielding average (.976) among triple-A shortstops. That same year, however, Gerber's batting was at times inconsistent. At mid-season in Edmonton, when he was hitting just .218, Gerber believed he would need to carry a batting average at least between .280 and .290 to get major league consideration. Edmonton's manager, Moose Stubing, disagreed with Gerber's assessment, calling it \"not even close.\" \"If he hits .250, he should get a look. You can carry him with the right club and the right park,\" Stubing said. Gerber ended the 1984 season with Edmonton with a .230 batting average.\nIn his 2022 book, \"The Book of Joe: Trying Not to Suck at Baseball and Life\", Angels organization coach and manager Joe Maddon described an incident that took place in 1981 (when he was managing the Angels single-A affiliate Idaho Falls Angels) and involved Maddon, Gerber, and Angels shortstop Dick Schofield. According to Maddon's account, a \"motorcycle gang\" would regularly attend home games to heckle players from the first base line fence, and on the first night of the incident the bikers were heckling Schofield for his salary and his play performance. In response, Maddon suggested to Schofield that while warming up at shortstop he should overthrow a ball to first base and hit one of the bikers with it. Maddon described Schofield's response by writing, \"Schoey is eighteen years old and is the nicest guy in the world and of course he wouldn't do it.\" On the second night of the incident the bikers were again heckling Schofield, but Maddon had already asked Gerber to make the warm-up overthrow instead, from his position at second base. Though Gerber's throw was low and hit the chain-link fence in front of the bikers, Maddon believed that, \"the message was delivered.\"\nCalifornia Angels.\nGerber's performance in 1984 earned him a spot in the Angels' spring training camp the following year, aided by the return of Gene Mauch as manager and his style of \"small ball\". Gerber had followed advice from Stubing's assessment the previous year to become a better bunter, and later described Stubing's work on his hitting saying, \"Moose changed me around. He knew I've never struck out a lot [just 29 times in 365 at bats in 1984] and tried to get me to hit the ball on the ground more. If you keep the ball out of the air, some are going to leak through. That can mean as many as 10-15 hits over 140 games.\" With Stubing as hitting instructor, Gerber hit .290 in instructional league, and .379 in spring training (at one point hitting .435). Among Angels spring training batters, Gerber's average was exceeded only by veteran Bobby Grich at .481. At the start of the 1985 season, Stubing credited Gerber's work in instructional league saying, \"His attitude is outstanding. He's always trying to improve [...] If he didn't dedicate himself for the amount of time he did, he wouldn't be here.\"\nEarly in spring training, Angels general manager and former director of minor league operations, Mike Port, described Gerber's route to the major leagues by saying, \"to grade him out a few years ago in the traditional way - hit, hit with power, run, field, and throw - I'm not sure you'd give him much. But he's learned to do the finer things. He's a good bunter, he knows what he's doing on the bases, he plays all the infield positions well. He's fundamentally sound. That's what will carve out a niche for him.\"\nOf Gerber's offensive skills Mauch said, \"Players that have his ability [...] must execute all the things that can win you a game in the late innings. [...] he's not going to walk up there and hit a home run for you. If you can't win a game with a home run, you have to be able to do the little things.\"\nOf Gerber's defensive performance in spring training, Mauch was quoted saying, \"you haven't even seen him play second base. Or third base. Or left field. Or right field [...] He's been all over the place. Guys who can play shortstop and quarterback can do a lot of things.\" Mauch would later add, \"Gerber's a bright kid, someone you could put anywhere and have a good feeling that he'd get the job done. He can play short, second, third, even the outfield. We put him out there in the spring, and he caught everything they hit his way.\"\nLos Angeles Dodgers special assignment scout, Mel Didier, described Gerber and the rest of the group of young rookie players at the 1985 Angels spring training camp by saying, “This is the best crop of young players I’ve ever seen in an Angels’ camp. Five or six of them have a real chance.”\nThe day before Gerber's major league debut, Mauch was quoted speaking personally about Gerber saying, \"Being an old shortstop, who played quarterback, I have a soft spot for Craig Gerber. But sometimes a fellow with his makeup gets in the way, if you know what I mean. He's too hard on himself. But I think he's a smart enough young man where that intense desire won't get in his way.\" Gerber's major league debut came in the third game of the season, in Anaheim on April 11, 1985, against the Minnesota Twins. Gerber entered the game as a pinch runner on second base, in the bottom of the ninth inning with the Angels behind, 3-1. Gerber scored to tie the game in what would turn out to be a 4-3 Angels win in the tenth inning.\nGerber played in 65 games (starting 30) of a full season with the Angels in 1985, finishing with a .264 batting average, a .277 on-base average with only three strikeouts in 97 plate appearances, a .319 slugging average, and a .971 fielding average playing mostly shortstop and third base, with one game at second base.\nAlong with winning the team's Most Valuable Utility Player award, most notable from Gerber's rookie season is his performance against 1985's eventual American League Cy Young Award winner, World Series MVP, 20-game winner, and fellow Chicago area native, pitcher Bret Saberhagen of the Kansas City Royals. Over eight plate appearances against Saberhagen, Gerber batted 6-for-7 for a .857 batting average, drove in three runs, and scored twice. After grounding out in his first at bat against Saberhagen, Gerber hit safely for the next six, and walked in his last appearance against Saberhagen. In a post-game interview after batting 3-for-3 with a triple and the three RBIs against Saberhagen, Gerber credited the combination of Saberhagen's ability to throw strikes and his own aggressiveness from only playing sporadically for the performance. Gerber stated, \"He threw the ball really hard tonight, and I knew he was going to be around the plate. His statistics are just awesome as far as his strikeout-to-walk ratio and things like that. That's good for me because I'm pretty much up there swinging, because I'm not in there every day.\" Gerber also did well against Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Dave Stieb (found on several lists of the best MLB players not in the Hall of Fame), getting his first major league hit off Stieb on his way to a 3-for-8, .375 batting average performance for the season.\nEnd of playing career.\nAfter a spring training seeing little playing time, Gerber did not return to the Angels for the 1986 season. Early speculation on reasons why Gerber might not make the team included the return of veteran infielder Rick Burleson from an injury that made him miss the entire 1985 season, team management's preference for developing younger players, and a possible move to a 24-man roster over the 25-man roster of 1985. In early February before the start of spring training, regarding the possibility of having a preferred solution to the upcoming spring training competition for roster spots, manager Gene Mauch stated that he didn't have such a solution in mind saying, \"I'd probably lie about it if I did, because I wouldn't want anyone to think he was counted out.\" Nevertheless, regarding his situation during spring training, Gerber reported to local press in March that he wasn't being informed on his status and wasn't playing, and that it seemed like Angels management had already \"made up their minds\" on him. Of Mauch specifically, Gerber said, \"He always has a plan in mind. He's probably had this whole spring planned for three months.\" By the end of March, Mauch may have considered the question of Gerber's spring training time unimportant, stating, \"I know what Craig Gerber can do,\" and adding, \"besides that, he has had a sore arm all spring.\"\nAt the end of spring training, when asked to respond to a recent question/comment from Angels General Manager Mike Port about the team moving to a 24-man roster (\"How often does your 25th man win a game for you?\") Angels third baseman Doug DeCinces stated, \"If Craig Gerber was our 25th man, he beat Stieb and he beat Saberhagen. I rest my case.\" Regarding the Angels not returning Gerber for the 1986 season, local sports columnist Gregg Patton would later write, \"The only place anyone has ever beat him out was on a piece of paper in someone's office.\"\nGerber played a limited role at Edmonton in 1986, with a quadriceps injury early in the season, and later a shoulder problem, contributing to him playing in only 74 games. In the offseason, with Gerber positioned between older veteran players with large guaranteed contracts and younger developing players, the Angels kept Gerber on their 40-man roster going into the 1987 season, preventing him from being picked up by another team and allowing the Angels to significantly cut his pay. Gerber asked to be traded or released but the Angels refused (putting Gerber in a position that Patton labeled \"infield insurance\" for the Angels), and then issued him a suspension notice that would prevent him from playing for any other organization for seven years. After sitting out the 1987 season, Gerber played his final season in baseball in 1988, at AA-level Midland (Texas), describing the experience as, \"[...] the most fun I've had in four years [...] I'm enjoying the game for the first time in four years.\""

The game was televised in the United States by Fox and began shortly after 11:40am local time (4:40pm EST) following Pole Qualifying for 2008 Daytona 500. The NFC won, 42–30, despite a 17-point first half AFC lead. NFC running back Adrian Peterson rushed 16 times for 129 yards and was named the game's MVP, winning a Cadillac CTS in recognition of his efforts.\nThe starting rosters for the game were released on December 18, 2007, with New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady starting for the AFC and the Green Bay Packers' Brett Favre for the NFC. However, Brett Favre withdrew due to an ankle injury. Notable Pro Bowl selections included the late Sean Taylor. The Dallas Cowboys had a record thirteen players named to the Pro Bowl roster, while five teams, including all four members of the NFC South, had no players initially named (Jeff Garcia of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers was later chosen as a replacement quarterback for Brett Favre.) This was the first occasion since their 1–15 1980 season that the New Orleans Saints had no player make the Pro Bowl. The AFC was coached by Norv Turner of the San Diego Chargers staff, while Mike McCarthy and the staff of the Green Bay Packers coached the NFC. Three Washington Redskins players (Chris Cooley, Chris Samuels and Ethan Albright) wore #21 in memory of Taylor, their deceased teammate. The game featured 41 players appearing in their first Pro Bowl (out of 86 total players), the most in eight years. In addition, the NFC played their first defensive play with only ten players on the field, lacking a free safety, in Taylor's honor.\nOn February 4, 2008, Brady, Patriots receiver Randy Moss, Chargers tight end Antonio Gates, and Chargers defensive lineman Jamal Williams decided to pull out of the 2008 Pro Bowl. Brady was replaced by Cleveland Browns quarterback Derek Anderson, Moss was replaced by Cincinnati Bengals receiver Chad Johnson, Gates was replaced by Browns tight end Kellen Winslow, and Williams was replaced by Pittsburgh Steelers defensive lineman Casey Hampton.\nThe game was the most watched Pro Bowl since 2000, pulling in a Nielsen rating of 6.3 and a 12 share. It also marked the first ever Pro Bowl to be televised by Fox. The 2008 Pro Bowl also marked the fewest players represented by a Super Bowl winning team, with Osi Umenyiora being the lone representative of the New York Giants, winners of Super Bowl XLII.\nNFC roster.\nSpecial teams.\nNotes:\nHalftime.\nThe halftime show featured a performance by the band Lifehouse, who played their songs \"Hanging by a Moment\" and \"First Time\"."

A native of York, Pennsylvania, Snyder was listed as tall and .\nSnyder entered baseball in 1950 as a member of the Philadelphia Phillies' organization; his career interrupted by military service during the Korean War, he never played for the Phillies. But at the end of the 1958 minor-league season, he was traded to the Dodgers along with fellow pitcher Jim Golden and veteran outfielder Rip Repulski for Sparky Anderson, the future Hall-of-Fame manager, who was then a young second baseman in the Dodger farm system.\nSnyder gained a spot on the 1959 Dodgers' roster and pitched sporadically during the season's first four months. After winning his debut game with 3 innings of relief against the St. Louis Cardinals in a wild 17–11 Dodger triumph on April 26 at Busch Stadium, he was given two starting assignments by Dodger manager Walter Alston.\nOn May 2, against the Cincinnati Reds at Crosley Field, Snyder hurled two scoreless innings before being driven from the mound in the fourth, when the Reds erupted for seven runs. Snyder took the loss in a 16–4 Cincinnati rout. Four days later, against the Milwaukee Braves at County Stadium, Snyder was far more effective; despite issuing five bases on balls, he allowed only one unearned run in five innings pitched and exited with a 4–1 lead. But he was denied his second major-league victory when the Dodger bullpen faltered and allowed the Braves to come back to win, 5–4. Milwaukee and Los Angeles would finish in a dead heat at the end of the year, necessitating a three-game tie-breaker series to determine the National League champion.\nThe Dodgers would win that tie-breaker and the 1959 World Series championship, but Snyder's last appearance for them happened July 14, when he was touched for three earned runs in only one-third of an inning in a 9–1 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates. He worked in nine games for the Triple-A Spokane Indians in 1959, then spent three more years in the minor leagues before retiring after the 1962 season.\nIn his 11 big-league games, Snyder posted a 1–1 record and an earned run average of 5.47. In 26 innings pitched, he allowed 32 hits and 20 bases on balls, with 20 strikeouts. He finished two games without earning a save."

There were 25 competitors from 6 nations. The event was won by Tommaso Lequio di Assaba of Italy, with his teammate Alessandro Valerio earning silver. Carl Gustaf Lewenhaupt of Sweden took bronze. They were the first medals in individual jumping for both nations.\nBackground.\nThis was the third appearance of the event, which had first been held at the 1900 Summer Olympics and has been held at every Summer Olympics at which equestrian sports have been featured (that is, excluding 1896, 1904, and 1908). It is the oldest event on the current programme, the only one that was held in 1900.\nThe United States made its debut in the event. Belgium and France both competed for the third time, the only nations to have competed at each appearance of the event to that point.\nCompetition format.\nThe 800 metre course consisted of 14 obstacles, all of which were 1.3 to 1.4 meters high. The water was a maximum of 4 meters in width. The pair with the fewest faults was the winner. \nThe roster of faults was changed significantly from 1912. The faults possible in 1920 were: 2 points for a first refusal, 4 for a second, 6 for a third; 8 points for a horse falling; 4 points for the rider being unseated; 2 points for knocking an obstacle down with the horse's fore legs, 1 point for knocking it down with the hind legs; 1 point for the hind legs inside the end line of a long jump, 2 points for the fore legs inside the end line; and 2 points for going off-course. Touching the end line of a distance jump was now not penalized."

        "title": "Royal Canadian Mint ice hockey coins",
        "text": "The Royal Canadian Mint has made coins with various themes. Most recently, ice hockey has been used for many numismatic releases. The first known ice hockey coin was for the 1988 Winter Olympics. Issued on February 25, 1986, the coin featured a goalie on the coin. Edge lettering was also used for the coin, the first time that it was used on silver coins.\nIn the 1990s, the theme would be used more frequently. The first issue was in 1991 and was on a coin with a denomination of $200. The coin was titled A National Passion and it was issued as a tribute to the spirit and vitality of Canadian youth and the national game of hockey. The most noticeable example was for two of the Silver Dollar series. The Silver Dollar for 1993 and 1997 would feature hockey as its theme.\nLogos from the Canadian National Hockey League franchises would start to appear on Canadian coinage. This would start in 2005 as part of various gift sets. The sets were similar to the O Canada set in terms of packaging, but the one difference is that the twenty-five cent coin had a team logo in colour. The first sets were issued for the 2005-2006 NHL regular season and the sets were issued for the Montreal Canadiens, Ottawa Senators, and the Toronto Maple Leafs. The following season, offerings included all six Canadian franchises. The sets would feature \"vintage\" logos, including the Vancouver Canucks first logo (which featured a stick and a puck) and the Senators logo from the 1920s.\nOlympics.\nTo commemorate the 1988 Winter Olympics, held in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, the Royal Canadian Mint issued five series of Olympic coins. Each series had two coins and the coin honouring hockey was featured in Series Two.\nThe coins were issued to help with the financing of the event. Edge lettering was used for the first time on Canadian coins. “XV OLYMPIC WINTER GAMES – JEUX OLYMPIQUES D’HIVER” appeared on all ten silver coins. There are existing varieties that have missed the edge lettering process.\nVancouver Games.\nSterling Silver.\nSpecifications\nMascot Sport Poses.\nEach Mascot sport pose coin features each of the Vancouver 2010 Olympic and Paralympic mascots: Miga, Quatchi and Sumi. But no coin features Mukmuk, a \"sidekick\" of these mascots. All coins had a face value of 50 cents, were packaged in a plastic sleeve, and the issue price was $9.95.\nNHL coins.\nNHL Goalie Mask Coins.\nIn October 2008, the RCM issued six sterling silver coins with a $20 Face Value. Each coin had the goalie mask of one of the six Canadian hockey teams. In the case of the Toronto Maple Leafs and Montreal Canadiens Goalie Mask coins, it is believed that the surviving mintage is less than 50.\nMontreal Canadiens 100th Anniversary.\nCanadiens executive Ray Lalonde confirmed that in March 2009, more than 10 million copies of the Canadian one dollar coin will adorn the legendary Montreal Canadiens logo. On an additional note, Canada Post will also issue four million stamps honouring the Canadiens anniversary.\nSilver Dollar.\nTwo key moments in Hockey history have been commemorated on Canada's silver dollar series. The first of these coins was the Centennial of the Stanley Cup. The Cup was first presented in 1893 to the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association team by Lord Stanley. The RCM issued the coin in 1993, and the proof coin was in a black leatherette case, with a maroon insert and a Certificate of Authenticity. The Brilliant Uncirculated version was in a clear plastic outer case, with a black plastic insert and a silver sleeve.\nTo commemorate the 25th anniversary of Paul Henderson's series clinching goal against Russia, the RCM placed Henderson on its Silver Dollar for 1997. The RCM offered two gift packages: a sterling silver pin and Uncirculated dollar, and a numbered colour reproduction print and an Uncirculated Dollar.\nMedallions.\nStarting in 1997, the Royal Canadian Mint started to sell hockey medallions to the public. To commemorate the induction of Mario Lemieux in the Hockey Hall of Fame, a set was issued honouring all three inductees. One set was issued in Sterling Silver while another was issued in Nickel. The success of the release led to future issues.\nAs a way of commemorating the retirement of Wayne Gretzky, a medallion was issued with a mintage of over 50,000. The medallions were $9.95 each and they were packaged in a blue sleeve with the number 99 in red on the packaging.\nCanada Post.\nStarting in 2000, a series of stamps was issued to commemorate the All-Star Game in Toronto. The success of the series led to future stamp releases. Starting in 2001, the stamps were issued in a special collectors set. The stamps were packaged in a hard plastic case, with a hockey puck and corresponding medallions. These medallions were struck by the Royal Canadian Mint.\n2009 IIHF World Junior Championships.\nThe Royal Canadian Mint has produced the medals for the 2009 IIHF World Junior Hockey Championship. This event will take place in Ottawa from December 26, 2008 to January 5, 2009. For the IIHF World Junior Hockey Championship medals, which were designed in collaboration with the IIHF and Hockey Canada, the Mint cut each blank – which is a medal without a design – out of copper. After the distinctive Ottawa design was struck onto each blank twice on a manual press using several tons of pressure, the medals were given their distinguishing finish: the coveted championship medals are plated with 24kt gold while the second-place medals are silver-plated and the third-place medals are finished with a warm bronze tone. All medals are lacquered and bear a Maple Leaf which is coloured with red enamel.\nThe Mint also sourced the tournament's popular Player of the Game award, which this year is a uniquely Canadian-made acrylic and aluminum Hoselton sculpture, housed in a cherry wood box."

        "title": "SummerSlam (2008)",
        "text": "The 2008 SummerSlam was the 21st annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brand divisions. The event took place on August 17, 2008, at Conseco Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, Indiana. It was the first PPV of the PG Era, although nobody noticed it at the time because there were still two Ruthless Aggression rivalries still going on, one of which ended at this event. The transition into the PG Era was more noticeable on the next episode of \"Monday Night Raw\". It was also the first SummerSlam PPV broadcast in high definition. It would be the last Summerslam to take place in a location other than Los Angeles or New York until 2019.\nSeven professional wrestling matches were featured on the event's card. The event featured a supercard, a scheduling of more than one main event. The first, featuring wrestlers from the SmackDown brand, saw The Undertaker defeat Edge in a Hell in a Cell match, a match that saw both men fight in a ring surrounded by a roofed steel cell. The other main event featured wrestlers from the Raw brand, in which Batista defeated John Cena in a standard wrestling match. Three featured bouts were scheduled on the undercard. In a standard match from SmackDown, WWE Champion Triple H defeated challenger The Great Khali to retain his title. Another was a standard match involving wrestlers the Raw brand, where World Heavyweight Champion CM Punk defeated challenger John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL) to retain his title. The ECW brand's sole contribution to the card saw Matt Hardy defeat ECW Champion Mark Henry by disqualification, as a result of WWE regulations, Hardy did not win the title as they can only be won via pinfall or submission.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSummerSlam is an annual pay-per-view (PPV) produced every August by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and Survivor Series, referred to as the \"Big Four\". It has since become considered WWE's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. The 2008 event was the 21st SummerSlam and was scheduled to be held on August 17, 2008, at Conseco Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, Indiana. It featured wrestlers from the Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brands. It was the first SummerSlam PPV broadcast in high definition.\nStorylines.\nThe buildup to the matches and the scenarios that took place before, during, and after the event were planned by WWE's creative staff. The event featured wrestlers from the Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brands: storyline expansions of the promotion where employees are assigned to wrestling brands under the WWE banner.\nThe main rivalry on the SmackDown brand was between Edge and The Undertaker. During 2008, the two had previously fought in four pay-per-view events over the World Heavyweight Championship. The two would finally face each other in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match at One Night Stand for the vacant World Heavyweight Championship. An additional stipulation was added to the match, in which, if The Undertaker should lose the match, he would be banished from WWE. Edge won the match, thus The Undertaker was forced to leave WWE as part of the storyline. On the July 18 episode of \"SmackDown\", Edge and General Manager Vickie Guerrero held their scripted wedding reception. At the end of the show as Guerrero and Edge were in the ring, Triple H appeared to reveal Edge's secret love affair with Edge and Guerrero's wedding planner, Alicia Fox. During Edge and Triple H's match for the WWE Championship at The Great American Bash, both Guerrero and Fox would interfere, in the process Vickie got speared and the distraction gave Triple H the opportunity to retain his title. Despite an apology from Edge on the July 25 episode of \"SmackDown\", Guerrero announced that she had reinstated The Undertaker and announced that he would face Edge at SummerSlam in a Hell in a Cell match.\nAnother rivalry from the SmackDown brand was between Triple H and The Great Khali over the WWE Championship. On the July 25 episode of \"SmackDown\", a Battle Royal was held, where the winner would receive a WWE Championship match against Triple H at SummerSlam. Khali won the match, which also involved The Big Show, Jeff Hardy, Mr. Kennedy, Umaga, and Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP).\nThe primary rivalry on the Raw brand heading into SummerSlam was between John Cena and Batista. On the July 21 edition of Raw, Batista faced CM Punk for the World Heavyweight Championship in a rematch from The Great American Bash. John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL) ran into the ring, trying to avoid a vengeful John Cena. When Cena looked to punch JBL, he ducked and Batista was hit instead. Batista started a brawl against Cena and the two eventually fought until referees broke it up. The next week, Batista claimed that he had no problems with Cena, who had a hard time believing it. Later that night, Cena and Batista beat JBL and Kane in a tag-team match. New General Manager Mike Adamle announced that the two men would face off at SummerSlam, making it the first time ever that the two men had faced off against each other, a match that had been six years in the making. Both men won the World Tag Team Championship against Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase Jr. in a tag team match. They lost the title a week later in a rematch.\nAnother main feud on the Raw brand was between John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL) and CM Punk for the World Heavyweight Championship. JBL became the number one contender for Punk's title, when he pinned Punk in a two-on-one handicap match, which also featured Chris Jericho as JBL's tag team partner.\nThe main feud on the ECW brand was between Mark Henry and Matt Hardy over the ECW Championship. On the July 22 episode of \"ECW on Syfy\", Hardy won the right to face Henry at SummerSlam after winning a Fatal Four-Way match against Finlay, The Miz and John Morrison.\nEvent.\nBefore the event aired live on pay-per-view, The Big Show defeated Bam Neely, who was accompanied by Chavo Guerrero Jr., in a dark match. Big Show won by pinning Neely after a WMD – Weapon of Mass Destruction.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe first match aired was between Jeff Hardy and Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP). Some of the highlights of the match included MVP delivering a belly to belly suplex to Hardy who landed hard on the turnbuckle and later, MVP kicked Hardy across the ring as the latter tried to deliver his rope-aided corner dropkick. The match involved series of counters and submission holds. Near the end, after delivering the Whisper in the Wind, when Hardy tried to execute the Swanton Bomb on MVP, Shelton Benjamin appeared, but Hardy took him out. In the ring, Hardy missed his Swanton Bomb, and MVP quickly kicked Hardy in the face and pinned him to win the match.\nThe second match of the evening was a \"Winners Take All\" intergender tag team match with the WWE Intercontinental Champion Kofi Kingston and the WWE Women's Champion Mickie James defending their titles against Santino Marella and Beth Phoenix. The match started with James and Phoenix, who countered each other's moves for sometime. Later, they both tagged in their male partners, who continued the match. In the end, Marella tossed Kingston over the top rope and then suffered from a Mickie-DT from James. This allowed Phoenix to capitalize and she delivered the Glam Slam to James and pinned her to win herself the WWE Women's Championship and Santino the Intercontinental Championship.\nThe pay-per-view continued with Shawn Michaels coming out to the ring with his wife Rebecca to announce that after consulting his doctors and his family, he had decided to, in storyline, \"retire\" from professional wrestling due to all the injuries he had suffered throughout his career. Chris Jericho interrupted Michaels' address, came down to the ring and asked him to say that he was quitting WWE because of what Jericho did to him. In retaliation, Michaels insulted Jericho, calling him a \"vile and selfish human being\", and said that he should go home and tell his family that \"he (Jericho) will never \"ever\" be Shawn Michaels\". As Michaels and Rebecca were about to leave the ring, Jericho stopped Michaels and attempted to punch him, but accidentally hit Rebecca in the face. Jericho left the ring, as Michaels and WWE medical trainers attended to Rebecca, who appeared to have a legitimate swollen lip.\nThe third match was between Mark Henry and Matt Hardy for the ECW Championship. Early on in the match, Hardy delivered a Twist of Fate to Henry and covered him for a pinfall attempt, but Henry's manager Tony Atlas pulled Hardy out of the ring and assaulted him. This forced the referee to call for a disqualification with Hardy as the winner of the match, but as titles don't change hands on disqualification or countout, Henry retained the ECW title. As Atlas was assaulting Matt outside, Jeff Hardy came down to his brother's aid and delivered a Swanton Bomb to Atlas from the ring apron. Later, The Hardys performed a double suplex on Henry outside the ring.\nMain event matches.\nThe fourth match on the card was the featured preliminary match from the Raw brand which saw CM Punk defend the World Heavyweight Championship against John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL). Both men's heads collided mid-match, resulting in some bleeding from Punk. After dominating the majority of the match, JBL was defeated after a GTS (Go To Sleep) from Punk, resulting in the champion retaining the title.\nThe next match was the featured preliminary match from SmackDown, featuring Triple H defending the WWE Championship against The Great Khali. The champion was attacked early in the match by a double-handed chokeslam from Great Khali – a move normally used as a finisher. Khali controlled the match with his strength, until Triple H attacked his legs. The end came when Khali blocked two Pedigree attempts, only to fall to a third attempt to allow Triple H to retain the title.\nThe penultimate match was the Raw brand's main event between John Cena and Batista. The fans were split on the two fan favorites, and each man performed numerous signature moves on the other to try to score the pinfall. After paying tribute to his former mentor, Ric Flair, by using his chop block and figure four leglock submission hold, Batista attempted to end the match but was trapped in the STFU. Towards the end of the match, Cena successfully countered a powerslam attempt into a fireman's carry, and executed the FU to Batista for a near-fall. In turn, Batista countered a diving leg drop into the Batista Bomb for a near-fall. Batista pinned Cena following a second Batista Bomb for the victory.\nIn the final match, The Undertaker faced Edge in a Hell in a Cell match. Early in the match, Undertaker and Edge both used the steel steps as a weapon. Edge began introducing the trademark weapons of his speciality match, the Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match. Edge put Undertaker through a table with a chair-assisted diving elbow drop. Undertaker then took control until Edge performed a Spear on Undertaker through a cell panel, causing both men to fall outside the structure near the announcers' tables. Edge and Undertaker fought outside the cell, where Edge performed another Spear through a broadcast table on Undertaker. Back in the cell, Edge performed a third Spear on Undertaker for a near-fall. Edge attempted to perform Old School on Undertaker, but Undertaker countered the move and performed a chokeslam from the top-rope through two tables positioned outside the ring on Edge. Undertaker then hit Edge with a television camera, a Spear and a con-chair-to, taking revenge on Edge for attacking him the same way at the previous year's Survivor Series. The Tombstone Piledriver ended the match with a victory for the Undertaker. After the match, however, as Undertaker was leaving, he saw on the titantron that Edge was still moving. So he went back in the ring to finish him off for good and chokeslammed Edge off of a ladder through the center of the ring, through the canvas. Then Undertaker went down and posed with flames engulfing the collapsed area of the canvas. Closing the show, commentator Jim Ross alluded that Edge had been sent to Hell.\nReception.\nConseco Fieldhouse has a maximum capacity of 18,345, but that was reduced for SummerSlam. The event had an attendance of 15,977, of which approximately 13,000 had paid a gate of $500,000.\nCanadian Online Explorer's professional wrestling section rated the entire event a 6.5 out of 10 stars, the same as the SummerSlam event in 2007. The Hell in a Cell main event match from the SmackDown brand rated an 8.5 out of 10 stars. The Raw brand's main event, John Cena versus Batista, was less well received and was rated a 6.5 out of 10 stars.\nAftermath.\nAfter their Hell in a Cell match, the year-long rivalry between Edge and Undertaker officially ended, which was one of the last two rivalries in the Ruthless Aggression Era. The last rivalry in the Ruthless Aggression Era, being the feud with Shawn Michaels and Chris Jericho, would go on until November 10, 2008. The rivalry would end with a last man standing match between the two men where Jericho beat Michaels. After that rivalry ended, it marked the true official end of the Ruthless Aggression Era to many because following the November 10, 2008, episode of \"Raw\", the transition in the PG Era became more noticeable.\nWith Edge written out of action, The Undertaker's rivalry with him was re-focused towards one with the remaining members of La Familia. On the August 22 episode of \"SmackDown\", Vickie Guerrero tried to apologize to Undertaker for her actions. Despite this, The Undertaker decided to launch an attack at La Familia. The following week saw Undertaker vow revenge on the stable.\nBoth main event feuds for the Raw brand were set to continue at Unforgiven with each men involved in a new concept five-man match called the Championship Scramble match for the World Heavyweight Championship that would also involve Kane. It was later revealed, however, that the SummerSlam match between Cena and Batista left Cena with a legitimate herniated disc. Cena's injury saw him replaced in the match with Rey Mysterio Jr. Cena would not return until three months later at Survivor Series where he defeated the reigning champion Chris Jericho to win the World Heavyweight Championship.\nThe SmackDown brand also featured its own Championship Scramble match at Unforgiven with Triple H defending his WWE Championship against The Brian Kendrick, Shelton Benjamin, Montel Vontavious Porter and Jeff Hardy. In spite of this, Triple H's rivalry with The Great Khali continued when Triple H aided Jeff Hardy during his Scramble qualification match against Khali with a chair shot.\nA title rematch between Matt Hardy and Mark Henry was made at the next episode of \"ECW on Syfy\", which Henry won from interference by Tony Atlas. Shortly afterward, ECW General Manager Theodore Long announced that ECW would have its own Championship Scramble at Unforgiven for the ECW Championship, which Hardy managed to qualify for along with The Miz, Chavo Guerrero, and Finlay."

        "text": "Oleksandr Anatoliyovych Volkov (; born 29 March 1964), commonly known as Sasha Volkov, is a retired Ukrainian professional basketball player. He was born in Omsk, RSFSR, Soviet Union. At 6'10\" (2.08 m) tall, he played at the power forward and center positions. He was versatile with the ball and quick on his feet, which made him a very sought after player.\nProfessional career.\nVolkov played professionally for Stroitel (1981–1986; 1988–1989), CSKA Moscow (1986–1988), in the NBA, with the Atlanta Hawks (1989–1992), Panasonic Reggio Calabria (1992–1993), Panathinaikos (1993–1994), Olympiacos (1994–1995), and Kyiv (2000–2002).\nIn USSR he was also selected MVP in 1989, and was one of the key players on the Soviet national team since 1985, winning the gold medal at the 1988 Seoul games.\nIn 1986 he was drafted by the Atlanta Hawks in the 6th round, together with CSKA Moscow teammate Valeri Tikhonenko. Fellow Soviet player Arvydas Sabonis was also drafted late in the first round. This was the second NBA draft when Soviet players were selected, after Alexander Belov was drafted in 1975. Volkov signed with the Hawks 3 years later on 1 August 1989. His brief career in NBA was hampered by injury as well as competition from several all-star front-men: Dominique Wilkins, Kevin Willis and Moses Malone. Volkov averaged 5 points and close to 2 rebounds per game during his first (89-90) season. After missing the whole next season, he came back stronger, roughly doubling his statistical output on the floor and even starting in 27 games. Afterwards, he chose to continue his career in Europe.\nHe was one of the founders of BC Kyiv. Volkov, who had already retired from playing in 1995, returned to play several games, to help the newly found team in 2000. He later also served as the team's President.\nNational team career.\nVolkov won a gold medal at the 1988 Summer Olympics, as a member of the senior Soviet Union national basketball team. He also briefly came out of retirement, to play for the senior Ukrainian national basketball team, in 1998.\nPolitical career.\nFrom 1999 to 2000, Volkov served as a chairman of the State Committee on Sports in Ukraine. In June 2007, he was elected the head of the Ukrainian Basketball Federation.\nVolkov was elected to the Ukrainian Parliament in 2006 on the party list of the Our Ukraine Bloc. But against the will of his faction, he joined the Anti-Crisis Coalition, which prompted early elections. In the early parliamentary elections in 2007 he was reelected to Parliament through the Party of Regions. Volkov was again elected through the Party of Regions to the Ukrainian Parliament in 2012. But left this party's faction in parliament on 17 April 2014. and joined the (then new) faction Economic Development one week later. In the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election Volkov failed to get reelected into parliament; he was number 9 on the election list of Strong Ukraine, but the party won only one constituency parliamentary seat.\nPersonal life.\nIn 2022, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Volkov joined Ukrainian volunteers fighting against Russian forces. Volkov's family home in Chernihiv was destroyed by the bombings."

        "title": "Captain (baseball)",
        "text": "In baseball, a captain is an honorary title sometimes given to a member of the team to acknowledge his leadership. In the early days of baseball, a captain was a player who was responsible for many of the functions now assumed by managers and coaches, such as preparing lineups, making decisions about strategy, and encouraging teamwork. In amateur or youth baseball, a manager or coach may appoint a team captain to assist in communicating with the players and to encourage teamwork and improvement.\nThe official rules of Major League Baseball (MLB) only briefly mention the position of team captain. Official Baseball Rule 4.03 Comment (formerly Rule 4.01 Comment), which discusses the submission of a team's lineup card to the umpire, notes that obvious errors in the lineup should be brought to the attention of the team's manager or captain.\nOnly a few major league teams have had captains in recent years, two examples being Adrián Beltré of the Texas Rangers and David Wright of the New York Mets, both of whom served in the role from 2013 through 2018. As of the season, the New York Yankees and Kansas City Royals are the only teams with captains; Aaron Judge was given the honor on December 21, 2022 and Salvador Pérez who was given the honor on March 30, 2023. Jerry Remy, who was named as captain of the California Angels in 1977 at age 24, explains that in today's modern age of baseball, \"there's probably no need for a captain on a major league team. I think there are guys who lead by example. You could name the best player on your team as captain, but he may not be the guy other players will talk to or who will quietly go to other players and give them a prod.\"\nBaseball captains in MLB generally do not wear an NHL-style \"C\" on their jersey. Mike Sweeney, captain of the Kansas City Royals from 2003 to 2007, wore the \"C\" patch, as did John Franco and Keith Hernandez of the Mets, and Jason Varitek of the Boston Red Sox. Brandon Belt of the San Francisco Giants wore an unofficial \"C\" patch (made from electrical tape) in a game on September 10, 2021, as a joke. Of the current captains in MLB, only Salvador Pérez wears the \"C\" patch.\nHistory.\nIn the 19th and early 20th century, the captain held most of the on-field responsibilities that are held by managers and coaches in modern baseball. For example, according to the 1898 official rules, the captain was responsible for assigning the players' positions and batting order, for appealing to the umpire if he observed certain violations (for example, if the other team intentionally discolored the ball or its players illegally left the bench), and for informing the umpire of any special ground rules. During a period when teams didn't carry full-time coaches, the captain and one or more other players could serve as \"coachers\" of the base runners; the lines setting off the section where they were allowed to stand were designated as \"captain's lines.\" If the umpire made a decision that could \"be plainly shown by the code of rules to have been illegal\", the \"captain alone shall be allowed to make the appeal for reversal.\" The rules stated that the captain must be one of the nine players, implying that a non-playing manager would not have been allowed to act in the captain's role. In contrast with modern baseball, the 1898 rules did not mention the managers having any rights to interact with the umpires. The rules allowed managers to sit on the team's bench during the game, but were otherwise silent with respect to rights and responsibilities of managers.\nIn early baseball, many teams had playing managers who had both the off-field responsibilities of managers and the on-field responsibilities of captains. They held the title of \"manager-captain.\" In contrast, teams that had non-playing managers hired a player to serve as captain. For example, in early 1902, Jack Doyle was signed as captain and first baseman of the New York Giants while non-player Horace Fogel was manager.\nThe role of captain has been significant in the histories of some teams, such as the Yankees, Red Sox, and Giants. Conversely, some teams have never named a captain, such as the Milwaukee Brewers."

        "text": "Scott MacKenzie (born 21 July 1980) is a Scottish former professional snooker player who lives in Renfrewshire.\nCareer.\nMacKenzie's first appearance at a ranking event came at the 2004 Daily Record Players Championship. He beat James Wattana in the final qualifying round before losing 5–1 to Marco Fu in the first round proper. He reached the last 16 of a ranking event for the first time in his career at the 2006 China Open. He won four qualifying matches to secure a place in the tournament, culminating in a 5–2 defeat of Ian McCulloch. In Beijing, he saw off wildcard Li Hang 5–2 then stunned Matthew Stevens 5–4 before losing 5–0 to eventual champion Mark Williams.\nMacKenzie enjoyed a superb run in the 2006 UK Championship with wins over Dene O'Kane and Tom Ford in the qualifiers which set up a last 48 meeting with Michael Holt whom he defeated 9–0. He then played reigning world champion Graeme Dott in his first appearance in a televised match. MacKenzie's journey ended there as Dott ran out a 9–2 winner. The remainder of the season was a disappointment, however, as he was unable to repeat that run and fell three places in the rankings to world number 63.\nMacKenzie revealed that he had previously almost quit snooker and even ditched his cue. \"After one particularly bad performance I threw my cue away. But my dad convinced me to keep trying. I borrowed a cue from Martin Dziewialtowski and that has really changed things for me.\"\nAt the 2009 World Championship MacKenzie announced that if he did not qualify for the event he would hang up his cue and retire from the game for good:\n\"I'll try not to think about it and I'll approach it the way I would any normal tournament. [...] But I imagine if I'm sitting in the chair one frame away from getting beat and knowing it is my last ever tournament, there will be a few things swirling around my head.\" Mackenzie lost in the first qualifying round, 10–9 to Wayne Cooper.\nHis best run of form in the 2011–12 season came in qualifying for the first ranking event, the Australian Goldfields Open. He beat Stuart Carrington, Andy Hicks and Tony Drago, before losing to former world champion Ken Doherty 5–2 in the final qualifying round.&lt;ref name=\"2011/12\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; MacKenzie played in 10 of the 12 minor-ranking Players Tour Championship events throughout the season reaching, but not progressing past, the last 32 on three occasions. Following his participation in the final PTC event in December, MacKenzie did not enter another tournament. He finished the season outside of the top 64 who retain their places and did not have a spot on the main tour for the 2012–13 season. MacKenzie has not played in a professional tournament since."

He appeared in nine games in Major League Baseball as a center fielder for the Chicago White Sox, but was a longtime star in the American Association and a manager of farm teams in the St. Louis Cardinals' organization.\nBorn in St. Louis, Anderson threw and batted right-handed and was listed as tall and . He entered baseball in 1922 and by 1926 he was a regular outfielder for the St. Paul Saints of the American Association, one of the three top-level minor leagues of the era. Anderson was not known for his power at the plate, but consistently reached double figures in stolen bases and batted over .295 for the next six years. His tenure with the Saints culminated with the 1931 season, during which he batted .314 and set personal bests in home runs (23) and runs batted in (95). \nThe performance led the White Sox to acquire his contract and use Anderson as their starting center fielder for their first eight games of the 1932 American League season. He broke in on April 12 with two hits in five at bats and two runs batted in, then, six days later, he had a three-hit game. But all his hits were singles and he stole no bases. With Anderson only eight-for-32 (.250), he lost his starting job to Elias \"Liz\" Funk and appeared in only one more MLB game, on April 24 as a defensive replacement. \nThe White Sox sent him back to the minors, where he played through 1939. However, in July 1932, the Cardinals purchased Anderson's contract and assigned him to the Columbus Red Birds of the American Association, where he played through 1936 and later returned as Columbus' manager from 1947–1949. Anderson spent more than two decades with the Cardinals as a scout and minor-league skipper. "

        "title": "Rugby union in Portugal",
        "text": "Rugby union in Portugal is a very prevalent sport, though still a long distance from association football. The sport is essentially amateur in Portugal, with some professionalisation in its top flight league and the national rugby union team. The rugby union teams in Portugal are mostly university sides, from Lisbon, Porto and Coimbra, with multi-sport clubs like Benfica and Belenenses having rugby union collectivities.\nGoverning body.\nRugby union in Portugal is administered by the Federação Portuguesa de Rugby. It was founded in 1926 and became affiliated to the International Rugby Board in 1988.\nHistory.\nThe first recorded game in Portugal occurred at Cruz Quebrada on the outskirts of Lisbon in 1903. All the players were British. However, it was only in the 1920s, and, later, in the 1950s that periods of consolidation occurred.\n1920s.\nIn 1922 that the game began to be organized on a formal basis. The Anglo-Portuguese playing pool at this point had been severely depleted by\nthe First World War, and the local population began to become involved. In many cases, the players were students, or ex-students, who had encountered the game abroad. The first match was played on 12 March, when a team from the Royal Football Club beat a team from Carcavelos. A second game was played in April, with the same result. Sporting recruited Maurice Baillehache, a Frenchman, as a player and coach. This led to a match between Sporting and the Royal Club on 11 November 1922, with Sporting emerging victorious. In 1927, the clubs of Benfica, the Royal Football Club, Carcavelinhos, Ginasio and Sporting came together to form the Portuguese Rugby Federation. A rugby football league was created in the same year, being won in that year by Sporting. Rugby arrived later in Porto, being played first at the Oporto Cricket and Lawn Tennis Club in 1908. The Oporto Rugby Club was founded in 1937. Lisbon first sent a team to play Porto in 1936.\n1950s.\nPortuguese rugby had once again been set back by the effects of another world war, but it was still dominated by students and ex-students.\nPortuguese rugby was heavily influenced by French rugby in this period.\n1990s.\nPortuguese rugby had a much needed \"facelift\" in this period, with some of its various problems being addressed. The shortage of facilities was partly remedied,\nand a proper youth recruitment programme put in place. In three years during the mid-1990s, Portugal managed to double its number of registered players from around\n3,000 to around 6,000\nIn 1995, however, Portugal had a major setback when they were beaten at home 102-11 by Wales in the 1995 Rugby World Cup qualifiers. This set their morale back, and led to criticism of weaknesses in scrummaging, rucking and mauling.\nPresent day.\nPortuguese rugby continues to hover around the 50,000 mark,but the main aim at the moment is to improve the national infrastructure, which has partly paid off, since the Portuguese rugby team managed to get into the 2007 Rugby World Cup - the first all amateur team to do so since professionalization. They were the only new team in the tournament since all the rest had appeared in the 2003 Rugby World Cup, and they got there by knocking out Uruguay.\nIn 2008 the Portuguese Rugby Federation, the Spanish Rugby Federation, the Gibraltar rugby authority and various clubs agreed to the formation of a \"Liga Superibérica\" (Super Iberian League), which will operate on a franchise system (similar to rugby league's Super League or Japan's bj league of basketball). The new league shall operate with 5 Spanish clubs, 4 Portuguese, and one from Gibraltar. It will operate on a different season from the main leagues.\nBecause Portugal is a popular holiday destination for people from the United Kingdom and Ireland, with reasonably priced flights etc., it has emerged as a popular tour destination.\nIn 2023, Portuguese rugby has become far more widespread and popular throughout the country. There are now multiple clubs in each major city and the number of both players and viewers have significantly increased making Rugby the second most popular sport in Portugal.\nNational team.\nThe national rugby union team made a dramatic qualification into the 2007 Rugby World Cup and become the first all amateur team to qualify for the World Cup since the sport opened itself up to professionals in August 1995 (after that year's World Cup). They qualified for the 2023 Rugby World Cup by winning the Final Qualification Tournament. Samuel Marques kicked an overtime penalty that would see \"Os Lobos\" win that qualification group on points difference. The Portuguese national rugby sevens team has performed well, becoming one of the strongest teams in Europe, and proved their status as European champions in several occasions.\nThe Portugal national rugby union team, nicknamed \"Os Lobos,\" Portuguese for \"The Wolves\", is a second tier rugby union side representing Portugal. They first played in 1935 and now compete in the European Nations Cup. Portugal qualified for their first Rugby World Cup in 2007. Portugal were in Pool C along with the New Zealand, Italy, Romania and Scotland. In the tournament, open side João Uva and outside half Duarte Cardoso Pinto were noted as particularly outstanding players.\n They were heavily beaten by New Zealand but gave both Italy and Romania serious matches with Romania being held to a 14-10 victory, only through their muscle and the second half appearance of skilled Romanian hooker Marius Țincu.\nPortugal have experienced unprecedented success in recent years. They were surprise winners of the 2003-4 European Nations Cup and have continued to record impressive results as they have now officially qualified for the 2023 Rugby World Cup after winning the Repechage Tournament for the final spot in the competition, beating teams such as Spain, Russia, Romania, Hong Kong and drawing with Georgia and The United States in the process. Portugal is in pool C and will play Wales, Australia, Fiji and Georgia.\nSevens.\nThe Portugal national rugby sevens team represent Portugal in international rugby sevens. The team compete in competitions such as the World Sevens Series and the Rugby World Cup Sevens. Pedro Leal and Pedro Cabral are two notable sevens players.\nThe IRB Sevens World Series circuit has allowed the Portuguese players to demonstrate their competence to the wider rugby world. In 2006-07 Portugal was an IRB Sevens \"core team\", participating in each of the season's events, for the first time. They have become an established power in the abbreviated form of the game. They lost core team status a year later, but regained it for the 2012–13 series in a qualifying tournament held as part of the 2012 Hong Kong Sevens."

Pangilinan as the keynote speaker. All subsequent elimination round games will be held at The Arena in San Juan (except for the penultimate playdate, which was held at the Araneta).

San Sebastian, meanwhile, hired Philippine Basketball League champion coach Jorge Gallent of the Harbour Centre Batang Pier.\nWith the suspension of the PCU Dolphins, only seven teams competed in the tournament.\nThe tournament began on June 23 with a triple-header at the Araneta Coliseum with hosts JRU facing defending champions San Beda while Intramuros rivals Letran and Mapua faced off in the last televised game.

SBC led for much of the game, but the Knights came back, capped with 6 points in the last minutes by Letran's Rey Guevarra, who converted an undergoal stab to put Letran up for good, after San Beda's Pong Escobal converted a disputed two-point shot.\nThe Red Lions rebounded after their loss and had a 5-game winning streak leading up to their second-round rematch with Letran. They won a notable game over JRU that embroiled San Beda in a legal tussle with the league (see Aljamal suspension, below). JRU committed 3 unsportsmanlike fouls as SBC head coach Frankie Lim and JRU mentor Ariel Vanguardia had a shouting match in the Arena's corridors after the game. San Beda avenged their first round loss against Letran with a win in which they led for the whole second half.\nLetran Knights.\nAfter a 4-0 start, the Knights were dealt their first loss by season's host JRU, but after rallying from 20 points down came up short. Their win over San Beda ensured a #1 finish for the Knights, but their Intramuros rivals Mapua denied them another 4-0 streak as MVP candidate Kelvin dela Peña bailed out the Cardinals with an almost triple-double performance. Letran won their next game against San Sebastian to set up their rematch.\nTrailing most of the game, Letran cut the deficit to two but a Borgie Hermida three-pointer kept the Knights from victory as they were beaten by San Beda 87-84 at the sold-out Araneta Coliseum. After the game, Letran players and San Beda supporters engaged in a brawl. The coaches and players received trivial punishments. Letran beat JRU in a frantic finish to seize the #2 seed.\nJRU Heavy Bombers.\nJRU suffered an opening game loss against San Beda but rebounded in the next game to beat San Sebastian. However, they were beaten two more times, one via overtime against UPHD to fall with a 1-3 card. JRU seized the advantage on their game against Letran and held on to win.\nJRU then made 5 consecutive wins, assuring themselves of the last semi-final berth. San Beda then broke the winning streak in a fight-marred game in which 3 JRU players were assessed with unsportsmanlike fouls. On their next game against SSC-R (which needed to win to stay in contention), the Bombers rallied with a 7-0 run in the last 2 minutes to force overtime and an eventual win. With the Bombers losing to the Knights in their rescheduled game, JRU now had to beat Letran consecutively to enter the Finals.\nMapúa Cardinals.\nMapúa started on the wrong foot with a 0-3 start with losses against rivals Letran, against CSB (their only win in the season) and San Beda without last year's suspended MVP, Sam Ekwe. Mapúa then won against JRU and Perpetual in overtime to finish the first round against 2-4.\nMapúa lost a further two games against San Beda and JRU, but defeated Letran. Anchored by two-time player of the week Kelvin dela Peña, Mapúa won the next 4 games in order to finish with 6-6. Typhoons suspended some of the games, allowing the Cardinals to finish a week early. San Sebastian's losses enabled Mapúa to clinch the #4 berth a semis rematch against San Beda, which had eliminated them in the 2006 semifinals.\nBracket.\n&lt;section begin=\"Men's playoffs\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"Men's playoffs\" /&gt;\nSemifinals.\nLetran and San Beda have the twice-to-beat advantage. They only have to win once, while their opponents, twice, to progress.\n(1) San Beda vs. (4) Mapua.\nMapua raced to an 11-6 lead, but after a Frankie Lim time out, San Beda cut the lead and eventually pulled away in the third quarter. MVP candidate Yousif Aljamal carried the team with several clutch three-pointers to keep the Cardinals at bay. Kelvin dela Peña's outside sniping cut the San Beda lead to 8 from a high of 14 before Aljamal converted another three-pointer. After not scoring, the Cardinals forced a turnover, but dela Peña was not able to convert a contested fastbreak lay-up to dash Mapua's hopes of a championship.\n(2) Letran vs. (3) JRU.\nWith fans wearing \"We believe\" shirts, the Heavy Bombers expected a battle of attrition against the Knights. Letran was able to make outside jumpers, with Bryan Faundo scoring the bulk of the points in the first three quarters; JRU meanwhile relied on the offensive rebounds of Marvin Hayes and James Sena to keep in pace with the Knights. In the fourth quarter Letran relied on RJ Jazul who scored 8 of his game-high 17 points to break the game open.\nFinals.\nIn Game 1, San Beda and Letran started the game by trading baskets, then Letran broke away after their time out to lead by seven at the end of the first period. San Beda answered with their own 10-0 run to lead by a point. The two teams battled evenly in a low-scoring third quarter. However, San Beda had a deciding run when RJ Jazul sat down after a hard foul at the beginning of the fourth quarter. Jazul came back cold and the Knights weren't able to come close as San Beda took game 1.\nSan Beda raced into an early lead in Game 2 where Letran had a tough time recovering; the nearest they came was five points late in the third quarter. San Beda held off Letran due to their fast break plays, thanks to rebounds of Nigerian behemoth Sam Ekwe.\nOgie Menor was named Finals Most Valuable Player.\nSuspensions.\nAljamal suspension.\nAfter Yousif Aljamal of the San Beda Red Lions was drafted at the 2007 Philippine Basketball Association (PBA) Draft, he was suspended by the NCAA Management Committee (MANCOMM) for the rest of the season after not informing the MANCOMM that he was joining the draft (5 other players from the previous two seasons were able to play after they were drafted). San Beda appealed the decision, and Aljamal should have served his suspension from their August 22 game against the JRU Heavy Bombers. San Beda was able to secure a 72-hour temporary restraining order (TRO) that allowed Aljamal to play in the San Beda-JRU game, while the NCAA Policy Board reduced to suspension to three games. With San Beda bringing the issue to the courts, a ranking member of suggested to \"The Daily Tribune\" that the Management Committee was considering suspending the basketball season.\nWith this development, ABS-CBN, the tournament's sole broadcaster, threatened to sue the league if the season was scrapped, citing massive advertising losses for the lost coverage; meanwhile JRU officials denied that cancellation of the season was suggested. San Beda meanwhile threatened to bolt out of the league (again) \"if no solution is found to diffuse the ongoing case involving Aljamal.\" The Manila Regional Trial Court (RTC) then granted a 20-day extension to the order after a lengthy hearing. It was also revealed that JRU President Vicente K. Fabella and top San Beda officials were to meet on Sunday (August 26).\nThe PBA stated that Aljamal \"has never played in a single tournament organized by the PBA and should not be considered a professional basketball player as of now.\" The NCAA meanwhile asked the Manila RTC to lift the TRO. ABS-CBN executives mediated the matter along with NCAA and San Beda officials. It was revealed that the PBA was the one tasked \"to inform the various leagues of their players’ participation in the draft. But problems that beset the PBA have overtaken events and Aljamal was an unwilling victim. It was not his fault and he should not be sanctioned.\"\nAt a press conference held at the ABS-CBN Compound in Quezon City, San Beda withdrew their case against the NCAA and made Aljamal \"sit out\" the remaining elimination games against UPHD and Letran. SBC also apologized to the NCAA for \"all the difficulties and bad publicity\". The NCAA for its part disregarded the suspensions, placing Aljamal back in the race for individual awards.\nJuniors' tournament.\nThe juniors' basketball tournament begins on June 25 at The Arena in San Juan with six schools participating. (Note: PCU Baby Dolphins and Mapua's Malayan Science are expected to join in Season 84.)\nElimination round.\n&lt;section begin=\"Juniors' standings\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"Juniors' standings\" /&gt;\nBracket.\n&lt;section begin=\"Juniors' playoffs\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"Juniors' playoffs\" /&gt;\nSemifinals.\n(1) San Sebastian vs. (4) JRU.\nElimination round games:\n(2) Letran vs. (3) San Beda.\nElimination round games:\nFinals.\nElimination round games:\nBroadcast notes.\nABS-CBN's UHF channel Studio 23 was the sole broadcaster of the games, covering all men's games (except for the UPHD-San Sebastian game on opening day), the Letran-San Beda juniors second-round game, and the Finals series of the juniors. 101.9 For Life!, ABS-CBN's FM radio station, delivered updates on game dates.\n\"NCAA College Hoops\" airs every Monday afternoons as a supplement for the main NCAA coverage.

It follows \"PGA Championship Golf 1999 Edition\". An upgraded version was released in December 2000, under the title \"PGA Championship Golf Titanium Edition\".\nGameplay.\nThe game features 13 courses, including 8 from \"PGA Championship Golf 1999 Edition\". Features of the game include tour play, and several versions of play used to score golf including match play and stableford. There is a community of players who visit Golf Sim Clubhouse to discuss the game on a forum and meet up to play online. Over 1,600 user created courses are also available for download and designers can upload new courses to the site.\nDevelopment and release.\n\"PGA Championship Golf 2000\" was developed by Headgate Studios and published by Sierra Sports. It is an upgraded version of its predecessor, with improvements focusing on various aspects such as game physics and the TrueSwing. Each of the courses from the previous game received graphical updates for the 2000 edition, except for the Jocassee Shoals course. For the Course Architect, new structures were added, including additional bridges, walls, and buildings, as well as more trees and other objects. Other changes include new camera modes.\nBrian Silvernail designed the game's Canaveral Dunes course. Silvernail was well known for his online golf course designs, which he would create using the course designers that came with the \"Jack Nicklaus \" games. Despite the title, the game does not include any professional PGA golfers. The development team had looked into licensing professional golfers for the game, but determined that players were more interested in other game features. The development team had a significant amount of work to do on the game and had a limited schedule to achieve it.\nThe game was announced in March 2000. Sierra began searching for beta testers in April 2000, and announced the completion of the game on May 9, 2000. The game was released in North America on June 6, 2000, and a patch was released two months later. The game was also released in the United Kingdom on August 25, 2000. An upgraded version with seven new courses, titled \"PGA Championship Golf Titanium Edition\", was released in December 2000. It was followed by \"PGA Championship Golf Collector's Edition\", announced in June 2001 and scheduled for release later that year.\nReception.\n\"PGA Championship Golf 2000\" has a score of 88 percent on GameRankings. Tom Ham, writing for \"The Washington Post\", stated \"the scenery here is top-notch--but the spectators still look like cardboard cutouts.\""

        "text": "The 1979 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 50th playing of the midsummer classic between the all-stars of the American League (AL) and National League (NL), the two leagues constituting Major League Baseball.\nIt was held on Tuesday, July 17, at the Kingdome in Seattle, Washington, the home of the third-year Seattle Mariners of the American League. The National League won 7–6 for their eighth consecutive win.\nThe game featured memorable defensive play by starting right fielder Dave Parker, as he had two assists on putouts: one at third base in the seventh inning and another at home plate to end the eighth. With Parker receiving the MVP award for this game, and teammate Willie Stargell winning the National League MVP, NLCS MVP, and World Series MVP, all four possible MVP awards for the season were won by members of the Pittsburgh Pirates. The game was also notable for the play of Lee Mazzilli, providing the margin of victory. In his only All-Star appearance, Mazzilli tied the game in the eighth inning with a pinch hit home run off of Jim Kern of the Texas Rangers, and then put the National League ahead for good in the ninth, drawing a bases-loaded walk against Ron Guidry of the New York Yankees.\nThis was the only All-Star Game at the Kingdome. When it returned to Seattle in 2001, the Mariners had moved across the street to their new home at Safeco Field.\nIt was the second All-Star Game held indoors, the first was eleven years earlier at the Astrodome in Houston. The weather outdoors was unseasonably hot in Seattle, with a high temperature of .\nRosters.\nPlayers in \"italics\" have since been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\nGame.\nGame summary.\nAmerican League starter Nolan Ryan began the game in sizzling fashion, striking out Davey Lopes and Dave Parker, but walked Steve Garvey. Mike Schmidt tripled in Garvey, and George Foster followed with a double down the right field line to score Schmidt for a 2–0 National League lead.\nThe American Leaguers came right back in the bottom of the first. George Brett walked with one out, Don Baylor doubled him in, and Fred Lynn put the AL up 3–2 with a two-out, two-run homer off Steve Carlton.\nThe NL regained the lead on a bases-loaded sacrifice fly by Parker in the second and an RBI groundout by Dave Winfield in the third. The AL went back up 5–4 in the bottom of the third when Carl Yastrzemski batted in a run with a single and Chet Lemon scored on a Schmidt error.\nThe score remained that way until the top of the sixth, when the NL tied it at five on a Winfield double off Mark Clear and an RBI single by Gary Carter. Pete Rose pinch-hit in and bounced into a double play, then entered the game, replacing Garvey at first and becoming the first player to appear in the All-Star Game at five different positions.\nThe AL went back up 6–5 in the bottom of the sixth. Gaylord Perry gave up a leadoff single to Yastrzemski, a double to Darrell Porter, and an RBI single to Mariner Bruce Bochte before leaving in favor of Joe Sambito without retiring a batter. Sambito pitched the NL out of trouble by getting Reggie Jackson to ground to Lopes at second, who gunned down Porter at the plate. After an intentional walk to Roy Smalley to load the bases, Sambito retired Brett and was relieved by Mike LaCoss. LaCoss then induced Baylor to hit into a force play end the inning.\nIn the bottom of the seventh, Jim Rice led off and blooped a double to right with a high bounce off the artificial turf, but was thrown out by Parker as he tried to stretch it into a triple. Batting for Gary Matthews, Lee Mazzilli tied the score at six in the top of the eighth with an opposite-field homer off Jim Kern, the first pinch-hit home run in MLB All-Star game history.\nThe AL mounted one last threat in the bottom of the eighth when Brian Downing led off with a crisp single off Bruce Sutter and was sacrificed to second by Bochte. Sutter walked Jackson intentionally and then struck out Bobby Grich for the second out. Graig Nettles then lined a single to right, and Downing attempted to score, but once again the arm of Parker claimed another victim. Fielding the line drive on the first bounce, he fired a perfect strike on the fly to Carter, who blocked Downing's right hand from reaching the plate. Along with his other assist an inning earlier, this play earned Parker the game's MVP award.\nThe NL took the lead in the top of the ninth without recording a base hit. Joe Morgan walked with one out and was balked to second. Kern walked Parker intentionally, retired Craig Reynolds on a foul pop, but then walked Ron Cey to load the bases. Ron Guidry came in and walked Mazzilli, forcing in Morgan with the winning run. In the bottom of the inning, Sutter retired the side, with strikeouts of Rice and Rick Burleson to end the game and earn the win."

        "text": "Rugby union in Austria is a minor but growing sport. The national team is currently ranked 79th in the World Rugby's world rankings, which ranks only the top ninety-five countries.\nTraditionally, Austrian rugby has been strongest amongst students, particularly in Vienna.\nHowever, it has faced fierce competition from soccer and skiing.\nGoverning body.\nThe governing body for Austria is Rugby Österreich, which was founded in 1990, and affiliated to the IRB in 1992.\nHistory.\nLike neighbouring Germany, Austrian rugby has a surprisingly long history, dating back to 1900\n, but the game's English image meant that its development was hindered by the events of the early 20th Century, \nparticularly the two world wars, and the rise of two major far right movements.\nThe first documented game of rugby played in Austria took place on 14 April 1912. The sport was being brought to Austria by two Englishmen hoping to expand the sports base. It was over sixty years, however, before rugby union took hold in Austria.\nNonetheless, a 1930 game between two French sides in Vienna drew no less than 10,000 spectators, \nproving that there was a significant interest at the time.\nThe post-war period has seen a revival in Austrian rugby, partly due to the large number of foreign military personnel who came to be based there. In 1946, matches were being played by the BTA (British Troops Austria) XV at Vienna and elsewhere. One of their \"home\" matches in Vienna was against a British combined services Central Mediterranean Forces XV, which featured not only the future television rugby commentator and Hawick RFC player Bill McLaren, but also a Colonel Stan Adkins, who would later play for Coventry RFC and England.\nThe London Irish player Spike Hughes wrote about the surreal world of 1960s Austrian rugby in the foreword to Michael Green's \"The Art of Coarse Rugby\":\nBecause the journey from Bucharest to Vienna took so long, it hadn't been thought worthwhile to play just one match, and as Hughes admits, many of the Austrians had had to be taken off in the previous two matches. However, the game managed to attract some interest:\nThe ÖRV was founded in 1990 and joined the International Rugby Board in 1992.\nThe main international rivalry is with the neighbouring countries of Germany and Hungary.\nIn 1992, Austria played a FIRA match with Hungary in front of 8,000 spectators.\nIn the early 1990s, former Italian cap, Dr Giancarlo Tizanini was a major driving force. Before his death in 1994, he tried hard to establish a Central European\nequivalent of the Six Nations between Austria, Hungary, Croatia, \nSlovenia and Bosnia.\nRugby union in Austria has begun to grow in recent years as they appeared in the 2008 European Nations Cup.\nSome Austrian club teams compete in the neighbouring German leagues or players from Austria play for the local German team (for example, the Bavarian team, RFC Bad Reichenhall, currently has many players who live in the neighbouring Austrian city of Salzburg)."

Seve Ballesteros gained a share of the lead on the front 9 helped by a hole-out eagle at 8. Jack Nicklaus played his first eight holes in even par, but stormed into contention with birdies at 9, 10 and 11. However, Nicklaus bogeyed the 12th to fall three behind the leaders. Greg Norman, tied for the lead at −7 as he made the turn, double-bogeyed the 10th hole to give Ballesteros the outright lead by one shot over Tom Kite. Ballesteros hit his second shot at 13 to within six feet. After Kite lagged up his own eagle putt on 13, Ballesteros holed his putt for his second eagle of the day and a three shot lead over Kite. Kite then holed his birdie putt to cut the lead back to two.\nAfter a par at 14, Nicklaus began his legendary charge at 15. After hitting his approach to , he buried the putt for eagle to pull within two shots of Ballesteros. Nicklaus then hit his tee shot on 16 to within 3 feet and after holing his birdie putt he was within one shot of Ballesteros who was playing the 15th hole. Ballesteros, who was in prime position to go for the green in two, pull hooked his approach into the water. After failing to get up and down, Ballesteros bogeyed the hole, giving Nicklaus a share of the lead. Kite made birdie at 15 to enter into a three-way tie with Ballesteros and Nicklaus. After a wayward drive, Nicklaus hit his approach on 17 to . After long deliberation, he holed his putt on 17 for sole possession of the lead for the first time in the tournament. He two-putted for par on 18 to post −9 and a one shot lead. \nBallesteros three-putted the 17th to fall out of contention, but Kite had 12 feet for birdie on 18 to tie Nicklaus. Kite barely missed his putt on the high side to miss a playoff by one shot. Norman, left for dead after his double-bogey on 10, birdied 14, 15 and 16 to pull within one shot of the lead. After hooking his drive way left on 17, Norman made an incredible shot between two pines to within eight feet. Norman buried the birdie putt, his fourth straight, to tie for the lead. Norman then hit a perfect drive on 18, needing birdie for his first major championship. However, Norman pushed his approach shot into the gallery and subsequently missed his par putt to finish one stroke behind. Nicklaus had stormed back, shooting 30 on the back nine, to win his sixth Masters title and became the oldest Masters champion at age 46.\nBoth Ballesteros and Norman stated the most regretful shots of their careers were during the final round of the 1986 Masters.

The only exception to Wembley hosting the final was during the second world war where a variety of stadiums were used to host the final and during 1932 where Central Park in Wigan hosted the final. However in 2000, the Challenge Cup Final moved out of Wembley in preparation for the start of the building of the new stadium in 2003.

The game was held on July 19, 1977, at Yankee Stadium in The Bronx, New York City, the home of the New York Yankees of the American League. The game resulted in the National League defeating the American League 7–5.\nThe host Yankees won the World Series; the third time in history that a team hosting the All-Star Game would win the World Series in the same year. As of 2021, the 1977 Yankees were the last team to accomplish this. The previous teams to accomplish this were the 1939 New York Yankees and the 1959 Los Angeles Dodgers. Since 1977, this would have happened two other times, with the 2020 Los Angeles Dodgers, but the All-Star Game was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the 2021 Atlanta Braves, but the All-Star Game was moved to Denver.\nThis was Yankee Stadium's third time as host of the All-Star Game, and it would be its last until 2008; the last year of the park's use by the Yankees.\nRosters.\nPlayers in \"italics\" have since been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\nGame.\nGame summary.\nThe National League started with Joe Morgan blasting American League starter Jim Palmer's sixth pitch into Yankee Stadium's \"short porch\" in right field. After Steve Garvey struck out, Dave Parker followed with a single and scored on a double by George Foster. After Palmer wild-pitched Foster to third, Greg Luzinski made it 4–0 with a two-run homer. Steve Garvey then sent Palmer to the showers in the third with a homer to make it 5–0 in favor of the NL.\nMeanwhile, National League starter Don Sutton cruised along with three shutout innings and Gary Lavelle added two more in the fourth and fifth. The American League first scored off of Tom Seaver in the sixth as Rod Carew led off with a single and went to second when Seaver stopped a lightning-fast shot up the middle hit by Willie Randolph. Seaver recovered to retire Randolph and retired George Brett, but then walked Fred Lynn and surrendered a two-run double to Richie Zisk. Seaver allowed the AL another run in the seventh when Butch Wynegar led off with a single, took second when Graig Nettles reached on an error, and scored on a single by Randolph.\nThe National League got their final runs in the eighth when Dave Winfield hit a two-run single off Sparky Lyle. George Scott hit a two-run homer in the ninth for the AL off Rich Gossage for the final margin."

He also was a member of the Fort Worth Cavalry in the Arena Football League. He played college football at the University of Houston.\nEarly years.\nDixon attended Vernon High School, where he played as a running back. He was named the MVP of the Oil Bowl,\nwhich matches high school senior All-stars from the states of Texas and Oklahoma. He was known as James “Dogkiller” Dixon. During his summers he worked for Animal welfare and various other JTPA jobs in Wilbarger county. He was tough to take on and protect many from stray rabid dogs.\nAfter high school he joined Cisco Junior College, where he played as a running back. In 1987, he transferred to the University of Houston to play under new head coach Jack Pardee, who converted him into a wide receiver.\nAs a junior, he posted 59 receptions (third in the conference) for 659 yards (tied for third in the conference) and 3 receiving touchdowns (tied for fifth in the conference). He set a Southwest Conference record with 908 kickoff return yards and led the conference in kickoff return average (27.5).\nIn 1988, the football team was employing the run and shoot offense with Andre Ware at quarterback and Jason Phillips as the main wide receiver. Dixon and Phillips became the first teammates in school history to register 1,000-receiving yards seasons in the same year. They are also the only wide receiver unit in NCAA history to each record over 100 receptions and rank 1-2 in the nation in receiving in the same season. \nIn the season, he posted 102 receptions (second in the nation) for 1,103 yards (eighth in the nation) and 11 receiving touchdowns (tied for fourth in the nation), while earning second-team All-American honors.

The 1,181 kickoff return yards broke Mel Renfro's franchise record of 1,017 set in 1964. His 47 kickoff returns broke Ron Fellows' franchise record of 43 set in 1983. He ranked fifth in the NFL and second in the NFC in kickoff returns with a 25.1-yard average, the highest a Cowboys player has finished since 1971. Against the Kansas City Chiefs, he returned a kickoff for a 97-yard touchdown, becoming the first Cowboy player to return a kickoff for a touchdown since 1975.

In the tournament, teams were obliged to submit a starting players table 1 hour before a game begin. Managers have made a consensus to change players if unexpected injuries were happen, which are commonly accepted in the international baseball games. \nDespite these arrangements, the South Korea manager Kim Kyung-Moon drastically changed his starting players immediately before the game, including a starting pitcher and this substitution clearly advantaged the South Korea team. Japanese manager Senichi Hoshino requested an explanation but his appeal to an umpire was turned down.\nAfter the game was over, which resulted a Japanese win, Hoshino made comments critical of South Korean acts as ungentlemanly conduct. Japanese team officially submitted a protest note to the South Korea team and the International Baseball Federation (IBAF). John C. Ostermeyer, secretary general of IBAF, acknowledged this appeal and announced that IBAF express regret at the South Korea team and plan to change regulations at a meeting held in January 2008."

He played in Major League Baseball as a shortstop from 1971 to 1979 for the Washington Senators / Texas Rangers, New York Yankees, Toronto Blue Jays, and Montreal Expos. Mason was a member of the American League pennant-winning New York Yankees team.\nCareer.\nMason was born in Mobile, Alabama, where he attended Murphy High School. He was drafted by the Washington Senators in the 2nd round of the 1968 Major League Baseball draft. He made his major league debut with the Senators on September 26, 1971 at the age of 21. The 1971 season would be the Senator's final season in Washington D.C. before moving to Texas and changing their name to the Texas Rangers. \nMason's contract was sold by the Rangers to the Yankees at the Winter Meetings on December 6, 1973. He was a member of the Yankees during the 1976 World Series against the Cincinnati Reds. Although he did not play in the 1976 American League Championship Series, he played three games in the World Series. In his only plate appearance of the series, Mason hit a home run off Pat Zachry. This turned out to be Mason's only postseason appearance, and the Yankees' only home run of their four-game series loss. It was also the 500th home run in the history of the World Series.\nBecause of Mason's low batting average, which hovered just over .200, his name, along with that of catcher Leo Dixon, was proposed for inclusion in a new term for poor hitting called the \"Mason Dixon Line\" (.204), which is closer to .200 than the Mendoza Line of Mario Mendoza (.215).\nMason is one of a handful of players to hit four doubles in one game, doing so while with the Yankees against his former team, the Rangers, at Arlington Stadium on July 8, 1974.\nExternal links.\n, or Retrosheet, or Pelota Binaria (Venezuelan Winter League)"

It constitutes the second-tier of the Italian league pyramid, below the first division LBA and above the third division Serie B, with promotion/relegation occurring between these leagues.\nIt is run by the Lega Nazionale Pallacanestro (LNP), itself regulated by the FIP, the Italian federation.\nHistory.\nThe league was created in May 1974, by the Lega Basket, the organisation in charge of running the LBA (to this day), that decided to create a new second division with 10 clubs. The two that were relegated during that season, and 8 from the now-former second tier Serie B, chosen with an on and off the court criteria.\nThe 1975–76 season saw 12 clubs take part, after a complicated system had seen a transfer of clubs from the Serie A1 to the A2.\nIn June 2001, the LegaDue was created to replace the Serie A2. Lega Basket now took part in running the league, though a system of promotion and relegation between the leagues remained.\nDuring the 2013 summer, another revamp was decided. The LegaDue was amalgamated with the third division DNA, to form a two-tiered league, the DNA (Divisione Nazionale A) Gold and DNA Silver. The two DNA's had separate season's, but the first ranked team in DNA Silver joined the seven best Gold teams to compete for the single promotion spot in the Serie A. The next best eight Silver squads fought for one spot in the next Gold season, whilst the three worst teams were relegated.\nThe next season saw the league retake its Serie A2 moniker, keeping a similar but tweaked hybrid model, with the eight best Gold and the four best Silver teams taking part in the promotion playoffs (still for the one spot), whilst the last two Gold and the penultimate and ante-penultimate Silver squads play a relegation play out (the last ranked Silver team was relegated outright).\nCompetition format.\nFor the 2015–16 season, the Serie A2 Basket is composed of 32 teams with a regional subdivision in two equal groups of sixteen, East and West.\nEach team plays the others in its subgroup twice, the first ranked team of each group then plays the eighth ranked team of the other group (e.g. East #1 against West #8), then the second best against the seventh, and so on, to form a promotion playoffs (for one place) of sixteen teams.\nSince the 2018–19 season the Playoffs winner is the third promoted team to LBA. The two other promoted clubs, which are also the top seeded on the League Table at the end of the Regular Season, have to face a final of two matches to decide the winner of the Serie A2.\nSince the 2019–20 season the Playoffs winners (2 tournaments) are promoted to LBA."

Born in Chicago, Burr was known as \"Tom\" to his friends. Press accounts throughout his life, as well as other memoirs, used this nickname, although many baseball references labeled him \"Alex\".\nBiography.\nBurr attended The Choate School (later Choate Rosemary Hall), where he was a star pitcher. He then went to Williams College, although he turned professional before he ever played a collegiate game. Burr made the 1914 New York Yankees roster as a pitcher under manager Frank Chance. However, his only appearance for the Yankees came on April 21: playing one inning defensively as the center fielder, he had no fielding chances and did not have a plate appearance. Baseball records show he pitched in seven games for the minor-league Jersey City Skeeters during 1914.\nBurr returned to Williams College after his professional career ended, although by some accounts he went into business instead of returning to school. He volunteered to serve in the war before ever graduating. He self-financed his trip to France where he volunteered as an ambulance driver before joining the aviation corps. He was killed shortly before the war ended in an airplane accident on October 12, 1918, while serving in the United States Army Air Service in Cazaux, France. After colliding with a fellow pilot, Burr's plane crashed into a lake in flames; his body was recovered after 12 days. He had been serving in France since November 1917 and was 24 years old at the time of his death.\nBurr was interred in American Expeditionary Forces Cemetery No. 29. During the years after the end of World War I, this cemetery was deconsecrated. Some of the bodies exhumed—including Burr's—were repatriated. Burr's final resting place became Rosehill Cemetery and Mausoleum in Chicago.\nBurr was one of eight Major League Baseball players known either to have been killed or died from illness while serving in the armed forces during World War I. The others were Harry Chapman, Larry Chappell‚ Harry Glenn, Eddie Grant‚ Newt Halliday, Ralph Sharman and Bun Troy.\nExternal links.\n, or Baseball Almanac"

        "title": "Royal Malta Golf Club",
        "text": "The Royal Malta Golf Club is located on Aldo Moro Street, Marsa, Malta.\nHistory.\nRoyal Malta Golf Club was founded in 1888 by Lieutenant-General Sir Henry D'Oyley Torrens KCB KCMG. A career soldier, Sir Henry was commissioned as second lieutenant in the 23rd Foot, Royal Welsh Fusiliers in 1849. His rise through the ranks was very rapid, reaching the rank of colonel in 1864, major general in 1869 and finally lieutenant-general in 1884, when he was appointed to command British troops in South Africa. He was only 52 when he arrived in Cape Town, his exceptional ability reflected in the high rank he held at a comparatively early age. Within ten days of his arrival he had launched the game of golf in South Africa. Thus the Cape Golf Club (the forerunner of Royal Cape) came into being.\nSir Henry's final posting was as governor and commander-in-chief of Malta. He arrived in Malta on 28 September 1888 and within one month he had founded Royal Malta, with a clubhouse in St Anne's Ditch and a 9-hole course laid out around the bastions (better known as the Hornworks) of Valletta. It was not much of a golf course, with practically no turf and with \"greens\" of pozzolana concrete, covered with sand to give the ball some stop. The so-called fairways were no more than wide with stone walls, in some cases high, on both sides. The ball could ricochet from one side to another or become lodged in the battlements. At least this form of golf satisfied the voracious appetite for golf of the servicemen stationed on the island. Some photographs of this unique course still survive and are on the wall of the club house. Golf was also apparently played at the Mosta garrisons but no records of this \"course\" exist. \nAt the time the then Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Albert Ernest Alfred, third son of Queen Victoria, also served in Malta and became one of the founder members of the club, hence the royal patronage from where the club gets its name. The circle of golf clubs in the Commonwealth with Royal status is an exclusive one, with just 61 members. The relationship between golf and the British monarchy started in 1833 when King William IV bestowed the appellation upon Scotland’s Royal Perth Golfing Society. The king was also a patron of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews, which he crowned one year later. Since then clubs in 12 countries have been honoured. \nThe club moved to its present location in 1904. With limited land available it only had 14 holes and the area had to be shared with tennis players and cricketers. The course was extended to 18 holes in the 1950s but a horse-racing track crossed seven of the holes and the horses obviously had priority. The track was annexed to the golf course in the late 1980s and the course is now fully self-contained. The designer of the course is not known.\nThe first known professional to be associated with the Malta course was F. Dalton, who was appointed in 1909, but the length of his stay is not known; it seems that none of the several appointees stayed for long.\nThe most renowned pro was David Llewellyn, who was there between 1978 and 1981; he was a confirmed \"islander\", for he had first learned his golf in Singapore, then on Hayling Island, before becoming a professional. He was Sir Henry Cotton Rookie of the Year in 1971 and his greatest feat after leaving Malta was to win, with Ian Woosnam, the World title for Wales in 1987.\nAfter one hundred years of existence the club decided to upgrade the overall standard of the course. The investment was considered huge and the project was based on a duration of 4–5 years. The first part of the project started in early 1988 when the club brought in consultants from the United Kingdom to redo the 18 greens. There was a six-month suspension of this project when 70% of the golf course was completely destroyed after heavy floods in late 1988, which also caused a disruption to the festivities commemorating the centenary of the club.\nDespite this huge setback, works started again in May 1989 and have continued since. To date the course has been totally upgraded, with the fairways planted with Bermuda grass, the installation of a computerised wall-to-wall watering system, the refurbishment of the sand bunkers (some 50 in total) as designed by David Llewellyn and the re-planting of the tees with TifSport-certified Bermuda grass and the greens with state-of-the-art TifEagle-certified Bermuda grass."

Through the late 60s, 70s and early 80s snowboard designs developed with the help of snowboard innovators.\n1968 – Tongue-in-cheek, students at Muskegon Community College in Muskegon, MI organize the first \"World Snurfing Championship.\" Hosted at \"Blockhouse Hill\" in Muskegon State Park, the event draws between 200 and 300 spectators, and becomes an annual affair.\n1978 – JEM Corporation, manufacturer of the \"Snurfer,\" sponsors the \"National Snurfing Championship\" in Muskegon. This is the first competition to offer prize money.\n1979 – Jake Burton and Paul Graves compete in the \"National Snurfing Championship\" in Muskegon.\n1981 – Modern competitive snowboarding begins with a small contest held in April at Ski Cooper in Leadville, Colorado.\n1982 – Paul Graves organizes the National Snowsurfing Championships\n1983 – Jake Burton Carpenter organizes the National Snowboarding Championships\n1987 – North American Snowboard Association formed\n1988 – The first World Cup is held. Four World Cup events were held with two in North America and two in Europe.\n1988 – United States Amateur Snowboarding Association formed. Former amateur surf promoter Chuck Allen incorporates the United States Amateur Snowboarding Association (USASA) in July with a $500 donation from \"Transworld SNOWboarding Magazine\". USASA is the first governing body exclusively for competitive amateur snowboarding.\n1989 – The USASA held a Trampoline Snowboarding Contest at Snow Valley, California.\n1990–94.\n1990 – The USASA holds their first national championships. Held in February, at Snow Valley, the worst snow storm of the decade hits just before the event and closes all roads to Big Bear. Amateur snowboarders from all over the country are left stranded.\n1990 – The International Snowboard Federation (ISF) forms. Following the collapse of the National Association of Professional Snowboarders, Ted Martin, Kazuo Ogura, and Christian Savioz create the ISF as the sanctioning body for international competition.\n1993 – First official World Championships held. The ISF holds its first official Snowboard World Championships in Ischgl, Austria.\n1993 – The International Ski Federation (FIS) votes to recognize snowboarding. The FIS votes to recognize snowboarding and plans several events in 1994 with a full-fledged World Cup Tour to start in 1995.\n1995–2009.\n1995 – First U.S. Snowboarding Team named. Created as the snowboarding arm of the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association, U.S. Snowboarding created a national team to compete on the World Cup tour in preparation for the Olympic Games, where the sport was to debut in 1998. Former competitor Peter Foley was named head coach.\n1995 – First World Cup tour held\n1996 – U.S. Snowboarding Grand Prix created\n1997 – U.S. Skiing changes name to U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association.

U.S. Ski &amp; Snowboard President and CEO Sophie Goldschmidt pushed back on the claims the organization had interfered in the probe. After former snowboardcross Olympian Callan Chythlook-Sifsof accused Foley of sexually and racially inappropriate remarks in Instagram posts, and others accused Foley of sexual misconduct, he was temporarily suspended by SafeSport, and then dismissed by U.S. Ski &amp; Snowboard. By August 2022, at least five women had made reports to SafeSport regarding Foley's behavior.\n2023 — On August 8, 2023, after an 18-month investigation, SafeSport suspended Foley for ten years for sexual misconduct.\nMaking the U.S. Snowboarding Team.\nThe pipeline to making the U.S. Snowboarding Team begins with young riders competing at regional competitions across the country. Riders can compete as individuals or often as part of a local club organization or team. Most regional competition series are sanctioned by the United States of America Snowboard Association (USASA). From local series events, freestyle riders make the jump to the Revolution Tour for halfpipe, snowboard cross and slopestyle.\nThe U.S. Snowboarding Race to the Cup is the national competition series for alpine riders.\nBased on results from these and other national competitions, riders earn points through a specified criteria toward qualifying for the U.S. Snowboarding Team. \nU.S. Snowboarding names team riders for halfpipe and snowboard cross. The team is named annually, usually in mid summer. The USSA is one of the only Olympic sports in America to support a full-time standing national team in every sport. These athletes compete as a team in major national competitions like the Chevrolet U.S. Snowboarding Grand Prix, X Games, Vans Cup, and US Open, as well as World Cup competitions. Teams for FIS World Championships (held every odd year) and Olympic Winter Games (every four years) are selected by specific criteria and named for those individual events. Additionally, top riders from both the Revolution Tour and Race to the Cup series receive invitations to train with U.S. Snowboarding as part of the Project Gold"

        "text": "The Soviet Union women's national rugby union team () were the women's national rugby union team of the Soviet Union. They played six matches between 1990 and 1991, losing them all. The team was severely underfunded, surviving the 1991 Women's Rugby World Cup by bartering and selling items of kit and other artefacts such as vodka. They ceased playing after 1991, because of the collapse of the Soviet Union.\nHistory.\nThe Soviet Union played their first match at RugbyFest 1990 against the New Zealand women's national rugby union team and lost 8–0. They also lost their other two matches in the tournament against the Netherlands and the United States. They were invited to participate in the 1991 Women's Rugby World Cup in Wales. This was the first time most of the players had got Soviet Union passports and traveled outside the Soviet Union. The majority of the team was made up from the Moscow-based Victoria rugby club. The team were delayed for two days and half of their luggage went missing at Moscow Airport. When the team arrived, they smuggled five crates of Russian vodka and caviar through customs at Heathrow Airport.\nWhen they arrived in Wales, they resorted to selling or bartering their vodka, caviar and sportswear in order to pay for their living expenses as they were not allowed to take any money out of the Soviet Union. Officers from HM Customs and Excise visited the team when they heard about the illicit vodka sales but left without issuing any enforcement due to the language barrier. The story was reported in national newspapers in the United Kingdom, which led to several donations being given to cover their expenses, including meals from a local pie merchant, £1,200 from an anonymous donor and £100 from the mother of the Welsh team's hooker. The Soviet Union lost all their matches during the tournament against the Netherlands, the United States and Canada; playing without scrum caps or gumshields.\nThe tournament organisers were left with a £30,000 debt owed to the Rugby Football Union after it, which was mainly attributed to the Soviet team as they were unable to pay their expenses. This was the last time the Soviet team played as following the dissolution of the Soviet Union; their place in the 1994 Women's Rugby World Cup was taken by the successor teams of Russia and Kazakhstan.\nResults summary.\n\"(Full internationals only, updated to 24 April 2023)\""
