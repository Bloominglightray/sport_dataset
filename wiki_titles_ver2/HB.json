V. Jenkins High School and Newberry College. He participated in football and baseball. For the football team, he was a tailback for his first two seasons as he rushed for 518 yards as a sophomore in 1973. He suffered a season-ending injury during the 1974 football season. In 1975, he transitioned to defensive back. \nCoaching career.\nIn 1977, after he graduated from Newberry, he was hired as an assistant football coach for Georgetown (KY). After one season he was hired as the defensive backs coach for Lenoir–Rhyne. He coached the Bears defensive backfield for five seasons before being hired for the same position for East Tennessee State in 1983. Before the next season, he transitioned from coaching the defensive backs to coaching the wide receivers. In 1986, he rejoined Lenoir–Rhyne as the team's defensive coordinator. He resigned following the season.\nAfter only one season with Lenoir–Rhyne, Taylor was hired as the head football coach for North Greenville. He was hired to coach the start-up junior college team that announced they were reinstating the previously discontinued football program. The team started practicing in the spring of 1988 and played their first varsity season in the fall of 1988. During his three-year tenure with the junior college, he finished with an overall record of 32–3, including undefeated seasons in his first and last seasons. His teams were known for their defensive prowess and his option running game. In 1992, he was hired as the head football coach for his alma mater, Newberry.

He was an out-half and played with Dublin club Lansdowne through the 1950s. His goal-kicking prowess saw him accumulate over 1,000 points in senior rugby, the first Irish player to achieve this feat.\nKelly's career coincided with Jack Kyle's time as Ireland out-half, which limited his international opportunities. He appeared sporadically between 1954 and 1960, debuting in a Five Nations win over Scotland at Ravenhill, to become the first national player to come from Wexford. Capped five times, Kelly scored a total of 12 points, with four penalties."

        "text": "Don Johnson (1930 – February 6, 2019) was an American basketball player and coach. He played college basketball for the UCLA Bruins under head coach John Wooden. As senior, Johnson received honorable mention from United Press International for their All-American team in 1952. He became a junior college coach at Cypress College in Cypress, California, leading the Chargers to a 588–259 record with two state titles and seven conference championships.\nAt the time of his retirement from Cypress, Johnson had the most wins among California junior college men's basketball coaches. He was inducted into the UCLA Athletic Hall of Fame, and Cypress dedicated its basketball court \"Don Johnson Court\".\nPlaying career.\nAfter graduating from El Monte High School in El Monte, California, Johnson attended Fullerton College from 1948 to 1950, and he was named the Eastern League's most valuable player for the 1949–50 season. He played college basketball for the UCLA Bruins early in coach John Wooden's tenure at the school, about a decade before the coach would win the first of 11 national champitonships. Replacing graduated star George Stanich at guard, Johnson led the Bruins to two Southern Division championships in the PCC, and he led the team in rebounding in both of his seasons.\nAs a junior in 1950–51, Johnson averaged 5.2 rebounds per game and received honorable mention for the PCC All-Southern Division team. He averaged 5.8 rebounds in 1951–52, when UCLA won the PCC title and qualified for the 1952 NCAA tournament. He was named a third-team All-American by the Helms Athletic Foundation and earned honorable mention from UPI. He and teammate Jerry Norman, the Bruins' co-captains, were unanimous selections for the PCC All-Southern Divison team. In 61 career games, Johnson averaged 9.8 points. His 596 points set a UCLA record for players who only played two seasons, breaking Carl Kraushaar's previous high of 543.\nStanding at and , Johnson was among the bigger guards in that era. Wooden said that he \"was a well-rounded basketball player. He played good defense, passed the ball well, could drive to the basket and was a pretty good outside shooter.\" Like a smaller guard, he could bring the ball up, and was also able to defend forwards due to his rebounding ability.\nCoaching career.\nIn 1954, Johnson became a teacher at El Rancho High School in Pico Rivera, California. As their varsity basketball coach, he led them to the playoffs six times in his 12 seasons. He joined Cypress College when it opened in 1966. He was never attracted to coaching opportunities at four-year colleges, preferring the purer coaching environment of junior colleges. Johnson led the Chargers to state championships in 1977 and 1980 along with seven conference titles. Seventeen times they won 20 or more games in a season and reached the state semifinals four times. His players included future UCLA and National Basketball Association centers Mark Eaton and Swen Nater, neither of whom had much basketball experience before joining Cypress. Afterwards, the school gained a reputation for developing big men.\nJohnson retired in 1994 after 27 seasons with Cypress, compiling a 588–259 record, at time the most wins by a California junior college men's basketball coach. In 1996, he joined Biola University as an assistant coach under Dave Holmquist, who played for Johnson at Cypress from 1969 to 1971. Johnson remained at Biola until his death in 2019.\nLegacy.\nJohnson was inducted into the Orange County Hall of Fame in 1996, the Fullerton College Athletic Hall of Fame in 2010, and the UCLA Athletic Hall of Fame in 2013. Cypress honored him in 2009 by renaming its basketball court \"Don Johnson Court\".\nPersonal life.\nJohnson's father, Jack, was a basketball coach at El Monte High. Johnson's mother, Cecile Sparks, played basketball at the University of Kansas for James Naismith, the game's inventor.\nJohnson's met his wife, Colette (née Hill), when he was attending Fullerton. They married before his second season at UCLA. They had three children. She worked at the ASUCLA News Bureau while he was playing for the Bruins. She was later as an administrative assistant at Cypress, helping open the school in 1966.\nJohnson died on February 6, 2019, at the age of 88."

        "title": "2024 NCAA Beach Volleyball Championship",
        "text": "The 2024 NCAA Beach Volleyball Championship (officially the 2024 National Collegiate Beach Volleyball Championship) is an intercollegiate tournament to determine the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) women's beach volleyball national champion for the 202324 season. The eighth edition of the tournament will be held from May 3 to 5, 2024, at Gulf Place Public Beach in Gulf Shores, Alabama. The 2024 championship will feature a single-elimination-only bracket for the second time, along with an expanded 17-team field. Nine of the participating schools automatically qualified by winning their respective conference tournaments, while the other eight were given at-large bids by the NCAA Women's Beach Volleyball Committee. The tournament was broadcast on ESPN, ESPN2, and ESPNU.\nBackground.\nThe National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) began sponsoring women's beach volleyball as a championship sport in 2016, and the sport has since experienced rapid growth at the collegiate level, with a 500 percent increase in women's collegiate beach volleyball programs in the United States from 2011 to 2020. The NCAA Beach Volleyball Championship is the tournament held at the end of every regular season to determine the women's national collegiate champion across all NCAA divisions. It has been held annually since the inaugural 2016 event, and 2023 marked its seventh edition. The 2023 tournament was held in Gulf Shores, Alabama, the same venue that hosted all six previous championships, and was co-hosted by Gulf Shores Orange Beach Sports &amp; Events, the city of Gulf Shores and the University of Alabama at Birmingham.\nPopularized on the beaches of California in the 1920s, beach volleyball is a sport played by two teams on a sand court. At the professional level, teams consist of a pair of players who compete in best-of-three-set matches, where the first two sets are played to 21 points and the third set, if necessary, is played to 15 points; each set must be won by a minimum two-point lead. Conversely, NCAA beach volleyball is played using a flighted team-dual format. In an NCAA dual, each team fields five individual pairs who are ranked from 1 to No. 5 by skill level, and each pair plays a flighted best-of-three-set match against their corresponding pair on the other team. The first team to win three of the five pairs' matches wins the dual.\nThe NCAA Beach Volleyball Championship had historically been an eight-team double-elimination tournament, in which all participating teams were selected by the NCAA Women's Beach Volleyball Committee. However, with the growing popularity of the collegiate sport, the NCAA agreed to double the field for the 2022 championship, adding a 16-team opening knockout round that led into the established eight-team double-elimination bracket. Along with the expanded field, the qualification process introduced eight automatic bids that teams earned by winning their respective conference tournaments. Further changes were adopted for 2023, with the tournament becoming a single-elimination-only event, and the field expanded to 17 teams to allow for nine automatic qualifiers.\nFormat and venue.\nThe 2024 NCAA Beach Volleyball Championship is a 17-team tournament that was held from May 3 to 5, 2024. The tournament will begin on Wednesday, May 3, with a play-in dual between the two lowest seeded teams. The 16-team single-elimination main bracket began on Friday, May 3, with the winning teams advancing to the quarterfinals and semifinals on Saturday, May 4, until a national champion was determined on Sunday, May 5.\nThe tournament will take place on one site at the Gulf Place Public Beach in Gulf Shores, which had been set up with five playing courts and five practice courts. Over the years, the playing conditions at the Gulf Shores venue have been characterized by several factors; namely the compact sand that makes it easier for players to move and jump, the strong winds, and the possibility of rain during that time of the year.\nParticipating teams.\nOf the 93 eligible NCAA teams, a total of 17 qualified for the tournament and were seeded from No. 1 to No. 17. Nine of the teams earned automatic bids by winning their respective conference tournaments. The remaining eight bids were allocated at large by the NCAA Women's Beach Volleyball Committee. The qualifying teams and seeding order were announced by the committee on April 28, 2024.\nAutomatic bids.\nThe following nine teams earned automatic bids by winning their conference tournaments.\nAt-large bids.\nThe following eight teams were allocated at-large bids by the NCAA selection committee.\nPreview.\nFrom its inception in 2016 to 2023, only two teams had won the NCAA Beach Volleyball Championship: the USC Trojans (five titles and two-time defending champion: 2016, 2017, 2021, 2022 and 2023) and the UCLA Bruins (two titles: 2018 and 2019). Both teams are in the running for the title once again in 2024. USC entered the NCAA tournament seeded No. 1 and topping the American Volleyball Coaches Association's (AVCA) rankings.\nBracket.\nThe tournament bracket is as follows:\nDual summaries.\nPlay-in.\nThe competition will begin with the play-in dual between the No. 16 seed North Florida and the No. 17 seed Chattanooga, in what will be the first-ever matchup between the two teams. \nBroadcast and attendance.\nThe first round duals on May 3, 2024, will be broadcast live on ESPNU and ESPN+. The first round matchups will all be featured on ESPNU and ESPN+. The quarterfinal and semifinal matchups will be aired on ESPN2 and ESPN+. The National Championship matchup on May 5, 2024 will be played on ESPN and ESPN+."

        "text": "The Madison Blues were an American semi-professional ice hockey team located in Madison, Wisconsin. The franchise was in operation for four seasons in the mid-1970s.\nHistory.\nThe Blues began in 1973 as members of the United States Hockey League, then a senior circuit with teams spread across the midwest. Madison had a good first season, winning the northern division and losing in the league championship. After the year, the team transferred to the Continental Hockey League, a relatively new outfit that was more compact with clubs between Milwaukee and St. Louis. The Blues weren't quite as successful after the move but they soon recovered and won a regular season title in 1976.\nThe team was organized by Campbell Enterprises, Inc. and had a contract with the city of Madison to use the Hartmeyer Ice Arena as its home rink. Part of the agreement was that Campbell was required to make improvements to the building primarily by upgrading the facilities. The James W. Thomas Construction Co. was hired to begin the upgrades in October of 1973 and finished in early 1974. Afterwards, Campbell did not pay Thomas the full amount charged, leading the construction company to sue both Campbell and the city of Madison. While the courts ultimately rules that the City was not at fault as it had not entered into any agreement with Thomas, Campbell was still required to pay for the work that had been completed. The case was decided in the summer of 1977 and shortly thereafter the team ceased to exist."

        "text": "A Difficult Game About Climbing is a 2024 indie climbing video game and rage game produced by solo developer Pontypants in the Unity engine and inspired by the gameplay of \"Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy\".\nGameplay.\nTaking inspiration from other rage games like \"Getting Over It\", \"Only Up!\", \"Pogostuck\", and \"Jump King\", the primary objective is climbing through a themed platforming obstacle course to the top of a mountain. What sets \"A Difficult Game About Climbing\" apart is its unique movement style, where mouse or joystick input directs force vectors applied to the player character's arms through Unity's physics simulation tools. This behavior is somewhat similar to \"Getting Over It\"'s hammer or the manual leg controls of \"QWOP\". Restricting movement to the character's two arms and hands limits traversal to what is possible with only two points of contact, but gaps can be crossed by swinging to create momentum.\nBodies of water are used as a checkpoint system when players fall. Each new game area or level is associated with a new body of water, so falls resulting from failing platforming challenges do not return players to the beginning of the game, but the beginning of the area.\nDevelopment.\nPontypants released a dev log on YouTube on March 6, 2024, discussing the process of building out the physics, gameplay, sound design, and map design of the game. Prototyping began in Godot before migrating to Unity.\nReception.\nThe game performed well on the Steam charts immediately on release. Like with other rage games, \"A\" \"Difficult Game About Climbing\" became popular during a window on release as a livestreaming and Let's Play title on sites like Twitch and YouTube. It also became a popular game to speedrun.\nSteven V. Santos gave a score of 70/100 for \"Game8\"."

After travelling to London for the Olympics, Kavanagh and his teammates were forced to withdraw at the last minute when the International Swimming Federation barred two of their squad from competing as they were from the north.\nA Leinster Schools Cup-winner with Blackrock College, Kavanagh went on to play rugby at UCD and won two Ireland caps, against England at Twickenham in 1952 and Wales at Cardiff in 1955. His younger brother Ronnie was also an Ireland player and both were on the 1952 tour of South America, making uncapped appearances against Argentina."

        "text": "The 2024 NCAA Men's National Collegiate Volleyball Tournament is the 53rd edition of the NCAA Men's National Collegiate Volleyball Championship, an annual tournament to determine the national champion of NCAA Division I and Division II men's collegiate indoor volleyball. The single-elimination tournament, which has expanded to 8 teams with the addition of the SIAC Champion getting an auto-bid, begins with four quarterfinal matches. The entire tournament is hosted by Long Beach State University from April 30 to May 4, 2024, at Walter Pyramid in Long Beach, California.\nThe quarterfinals and semifinals are streamed live on NCAA.com. ESPN2 has the National Championship on May 4 with ESPN+ simulcasting it.\nIn an unprecedented decision, the SIAC was granted a waiver to be allowed an automatic bid despite not meeting the two-year eligibility waiting period requirement. The SIAC was granted the bid because the conference had been fostering growth and diversity in a region that has had little representation in men's volleyball.\nWith Fort Valley State University receiving the automatic bid for the SIAC conference, the school made history as the first HBCU to compete in the NCAA Men's National Collegiate Volleyball Championship.\nOf note, the quarterfinals featured a sweep in every game, the first such occurrence since the 2013 NCAA Men's Volleyball Tournament, albeit an important difference being that the field was much smaller back then (4 compared to 8).\nBids.\nThe tournament field was announced on NCAA.com Sunday, April 21, 2024, at 1 p.m. EDT.\nAll Tournament Team.\nTo be filled in upon the conclusion of the tournament."

        "title": "DarkZero Esports",
        "text": "DarkZero Esports, or simply DarkZero (DZ), is an American esports organization. Founded in 2018, DarkZero participates in competitive \"Rainbow Six Siege\" and \"Apex Legends\" competitions. With the latter, DarkZero is an \"Apex Legends\" Global Series (ALGS) partner team. The org also formerly participated in the competitive \"Valorant\" scene.\nFounding and structure.\nAn American organization, DarkZero Esports was founded in 2018 by Zachary Matula. A private equity investor, Matula previously worked as a trader. Matula was the CEO of DarkZero until September 2021, when Don Kim filled the role; Kim previously served as the CEO of Team SoloMid (TSM), another American esports organization. DarkZero is based in a facility in Las Vegas. \nIn April 2021, DarkZero announced a partnership with Respawn Products, specifically a one-year deal for the latter to become DarkZero's exclusive gaming furniture provider. DZ also have a partnership with Aim Lab, which began in October 2020. Raven, a UK-based merchandise company, handles the team's apparel design and production. DZ also has an ownership stake in Raven. In August 2021, they announced a partnership with Resorts World Las Vegas. \nHistory in \"Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege\".\nThe organization first participated in competitive \"Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege\" (\"R6\"), joining the scene in November 2018, after acquiring SK Gaming's roster. In competitive \"R6\" play, the team won the tenth season of the North American \"Rainbow Six Siege\" Pro League in 2019. They also won the North American League's 2020 August Major. In 2022, DZ won the Charlotte Major, defeating Astralis. DarkZero's roster for the Charlotte Major title featured Hyper, Ecl9pse, njr, Panbazou, and Canadian.\nHistory in \"Valorant\".\nIn June 2021, DZ signed the Kooky Koalas roster for the org's foray into \"Valorant\". This initial roster included Kyle \"ScrewFace\" Jensen, Yannick \"KOLER\" Blanchette, Nick \"Harmon\" Harmon, Adam \"Ange\" Milian, and Andy \"Andersin\" Collins, with Zack \"huuaw\" Solomon serving as the team's coach. They introduced a new roster lineup in April 2022, which included ScrewFace, Ange, Trick, drone, and ZexRow, as well as neilzinho serving as head coach. Despite this, DarkZero announced that July, they would be exiting the \"Valorant\" scene. Performance wise, DarkZero found little success in \"Valorant\" play. Though DZ stated they hoped their departure would be temporary, the organization has not fielded a \"Valorant\" roster since.\nHistory in \"Apex Legends\".\n\"Apex Legends\" Global Series (ALGS) Year 2.\nIn July 2022, the Japanese esports organization Reignite dissolved its \"Apex Legends\" roster, which consisted of Rhys \"Zer0\" Perry, Noyan \"Genburten\" Ozkose, and Rick \"Sharky\" Wirth. Zer0 plays as the team's In-Game Leader (IGL). The trio were fresh off their win of the ALGS Split 2 playoffs in Stockholm during the 2021–22 (ALGS Year 2) season. Genburten was unable to play during these playoffs due to a COVID-19 scare; British loan player Jake \"Jmw\" Walters substituted as the third player. \nDarkZero then signed the trio as part of their entry into the ALGS scene, formally announcing their signing in July. The All-Australian trio would shortly thereafter go on to win the 2022 ALGS Championship. With TSM and OpTic enganging in a \"chaotic endgame\", DZ won out against Spacestation and GMT in the final circle of the championship match. The win marked the second consecutive title for Zer0, Genburten, and Sharky, due to their ALGS Split 2 victory. Their ALGS Championship victory came so soon after their official signing with DarkZero, that the organization had not yet updated their website to include bios for the players.\nALGS Year 3.\nIn April 2023, during the middle of the 2022–23 (ALGS Year 3) season, Sharky left the team, expressing he lost passion for \"Apex\"; Beau \"RamBeau\" Sheid would fill-in for DarkZero's vacant roster spot. This was met with controversy, with other professional players criticizing this situation. Following the end of the ALGS Pro League regular season, RemBeau was left off the DZ roster and the organization instead picked up Rody \"Xynew\" Geissler as their third player. Zer0 and Genburten cited Xynew's \"communication skills and game brain\" as reasons they greenlit his acquistion; they also expressed that these strengths were unusual for a controller player such as Xynew. Now with Xynew, DarkZero won the 2023 ALGS North American (NA) Regional Finals.\nDuring ALGS Year 3, DarkZero was considered by esports media writers and fans as one of the favorites of the competition alongside TSM. DZ were challenged by the Aurora Gaming org during the group stage of the ALGS Split 2 playoffs. DarkZero ultimately went on to win the ALGS Split 2 Playoffs. Going into the Year 3 Championship, DarkZero were ranked second in the Apex Global Power Rankings – the rankings are determined by panelists from within the \"Apex Legends\" community.\nALGS Year 4.\nAhead of the 2023–24 ALGS season (or ALGS Year 4), \"Apex Legends\" publisher Electronic Arts (EA) announced DarkZero as one of the 12 ALGS partner teams; these teams receive \"a variety of support programs and contributions\" from EA and the game's developer, Respawn Entertainment. DZ's coach, \"zz\", quelled rumors that team would be returning to the APAC region for Year 4. \nIn January 2024, DarkZero signed Nicholas \"Sikezz\" Odom. He was previously signed to XSET, but left in November 2023, stating he had another roster spot lined up. Shortly thereafter, Xynew was announced to have joined Spacestation Gaming, effectively ending his tenure with DZ. In February, DarkZero assembled an all-women's \"Apex\" roster. Dubbed \"DZ Eve\", the roster includes players \"Renee\", \"Scarlita\", and \"Samuraisky\".\nRosters.\nSource:\nSource:"

The game was played on March 31, 1991, at Lakefront Arena in New Orleans, Louisiana.

The Cavaliers finished No. 2 in the final AP poll, a spot they never fell below throughout the duration of the season.\nEntering the NCAA tournament at 27–2, Virginia held the No. 1 seed in the Midwest region. They defeated No. 8 seed Stephen F. Austin, No. 5 seed Oklahoma State, and No. 10 seed Lamar to reach the Final Four for the second straight season.

The competition featured eight European nations, including an invitational team from France, Ligue AURA, which consisted of regional U19 players. Ligue AURA's inclusion was due to Spain’s success at the World Rugby U20 Trophy in July where they qualified for the U20 Championship. Switzerland made an appearance for the first time since 2017, they qualified after defeating Bulgaria in a qualification play-off match earlier in April.\nThe Netherlands defeated Belgium in the Cup final and qualified for the 2024 World Rugby Under 20 Trophy in Scotland."

He had been a late call up to play hooker for the Possibles team in the Irish trials but impressed enough to join Ballymena teammates Willie John McBride and Syd Millar on the touring party. Ireland played twice against Argentine in Buenos Aires and Birch featured in both matches, for which the Irish Rugby Football Union retrospectively awarded caps in 2023."
