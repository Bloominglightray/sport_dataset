        "text": "Basil Mucktar Mitchell (born September 7, 1975) is a former National Football League running back. He played for two seasons with the Green Bay Packers.\nCollege career.\nA 4-year letterman at Mount Pleasant High School, Basil Mitchell ran for over 1,650 yards and 30 touchdowns during his senior campaign. This performance warranted recognition from several division I universities. He enrolled at TCU in 1994 and in two years was already their #1 running back. Basil is one of only 9 Horned Frogs to eclipse the 2,500 yard mark. He finished out his days as a Horned Frog with 2,783 yards which puts him at #6 all time. He had 12 career 100 yard rushing games, and is one of three Horned Frogs to have multiple 200 yard games, which came against UNLV in 1996 (220 yards) and Tulsa, also in '96 (215 yards). The two other members of the multiple 200 yard club are LaDainian Tomlinson with 8 and Kenneth Davis with 3.\nDuring Mitchell's senior season at TCU, the Horned Frogs' feature running back helped the team earn a trip to the 1998 Sun Bowl in El Paso, Texas in a matchup against Carson Palmer and the highly touted USC Trojans. Mitchell led the 'Frogs with 185 yards and 2 touchdowns earning honors as the 1998 Norwest Sun Bowl MVP and his effort helped to give TCU their first bowl game victory since 1957, beating USC 28-19. Mitchell finished the season with 1,100 yards rushing, and led the country in yards per carry with a 6.7 average.\nProfessional career.\nThe 5'-10\", 200 pound Mitchell was acquired by the Packers as a free agent on April 19, 1999. He played in 1999 and 2000. He played in 16 games in 1999. He had 29 rush attempts for 117 yards. That makes for an average of 4 yards per rush attempt. He also had six receptions for 48 yards. Next season, Mitchell only played one game and had two rush attempts for eight yards.\nDuring the final game of the 1999 NFL season, Mitchell and the Packers were involved in what has been described as a bizarre tie-breaking scenario which resulted in four teams that finished with 8–8 records where two of the teams would qualify for the playoffs and the other two would be eliminated. Going into their season finale against the Arizona Cardinals, the Packers needed to win their game, have the Dallas Cowboys lose their game later that afternoon, and also needed the Packers to win the net points scored tie-breaker vs. the Carolina Panthers (who were facing the New Orleans Saints). The Packers and Panthers were playing during the noon time slot and the Packers held a net eighteen point advantage. As the game progressed, Carolina was winning their game by a sizable margin to the point that they had overtaken the Packers in net points for a brief time. Since both teams were neck and neck for the tie-break advantage, both teams were frantically trying to score as many points as possible despite leading on the scoreboard by a sizable margin. The Cardinals and Saints also tried to score frantically as the game progressed to stop their opponents from gaining the net points advantage. Ultimately, the Packers prevailed in net points by +11. In the end however, the Cowboys won their afternoon contest against the New York Giants to claim the final playoff spot and thus eliminate the Packers from playoff contention. Mitchell scored a key touchdown in the contest on an 88-yard kickoff return for a touchdown. The Packers won their game 49–24 and the Panthers won their game 45–13.\nIn 2000, Mitchell was drafted for the single season XFL by the Memphis Maniax, but never played in the league. \nAs of 2009, Mitchell resides in Mount Pleasant, Texas. He and his wife Sharay have a total of five children."

        "text": "William Fraser Sutherland (November 10, 1934 – April 9, 2017) was a Canadian professional ice hockey centre and a National Hockey League (NHL) coach. He played in the NHL for five teams between 1963 and 1972, and then in the World Hockey Association with the Winnipeg Jets between 1972 and 1974. After his playing career he briefly coached the Jets between 1980 and 1981. He scored the first goal in Philadelphia Flyers history in 1967 in a 1–0 victory over the Pittsburgh Penguins.\nPlaying career.\nMinor league career.\nSutherland played two seasons with the St. Boniface Canadiens of the Manitoba Junior Hockey League, scoring 60 points in 25 games during the 1954–55 season. He then embarked on a long minor league career, serving stints with the Cincinnati Mohawks, Montreal Royals, Cleveland Barons, and Quebec Aces. He made his NHL debut in 1963, playing two playoff games after a series of injuries to the Montreal Canadiens forward unit.\nNHL.\nThe 1967 expansion gave Sutherland a chance to finally break into hockey's top league, as the Philadelphia Flyers purchased the Aces as their new top farm team and transferred Quebec's best players to the NHL squad. He scored the first goal in Flyers history on October 11, 1967. He became the first player in NHL history to score the first NHL goal in two arenas in the same season. He scored the first goal at the Long Beach Sports Arena in a 4–2 loss to the Los Angeles Kings. Five days later he scored the only goal in a 1–0 victory against the Pittsburgh Penguins at the first game at the Philadelphia Spectrum.\nThe next season, the Minnesota North Stars selected Sutherland in the 1968 NHL Intra-League Draft. However, he never played for this franchise, and instead was dealt to the Toronto Maple Leafs. After 44 games with Toronto, he was traded back to the Flyers. He spent the next year as a Flyers starter, and he then scored an NHL career-high 39 points in 1970–71 with the St. Louis Blues. The next year, he saw limited playing time with the Blues and the Detroit Red Wings. He ended his playing career with the Winnipeg Jets during their World Hockey Association days.\nCoaching career.\nAfter retirement, Sutherland was involved with sports broadcasting until his hiring by the Jets as an assistant coach in 1979. After the firing of Tom McVie with three games left in the 1979–80 season, Sutherland became head coach. However, he was fired 29 games into the next season.\nDeath.\nSutherland died on April 9, 2017, at the age of 82."

        "text": "Archery GB is the largest national governing body for the sport of archery in the United Kingdom. Archery GB is responsible for all levels of archery within the UK from elite to development level and supports over 40,000 members. Archery GB is the umbrella organisation for English Archery Association, Archery Northern Ireland, Scottish Archery and Welsh Archery Association. Under Archery GB are eight Regional Societies and many different county societies. It is affiliated to the World Archery Federation (WA); (formerly FITA, the \"Fédération Internationale de Tir à l'Arc\") and is a member of the British Olympic Association. The society's motto is: \"Union, Trueheart and Courtesie\".\nArchery GB is the trading name of the Grand National Archery Society, a company limited by guarantee no. 1342150 Registered in England\nRole.\nArchery GB, is the largest archery organisation of target archery in the United Kingdom, the society also covers either forms of archery including field archery, flight archery and Clout archery.\nThe society is currently responsible for over 750 clubs and 32,000 registered members across the UK, all of whom may receive the magazine Archery UK twice a year, included in their affiliation. It also organises its own national tournaments and is responsible for training coaches and judges, as well as ensuring affiliated clubs are covered by their public liability insurance policy. These costs are partly covered by affiliation fees, which all club members pay, both to county and regional associations and Archery GB itself.\nHistory.\nThe first Grand National Archery Meeting was held on the Knavesmire at York in 1843 but the Grand National Archery Society (later Archery GB) itself was not founded until 1861, when it met at the Adelphi Hotel in Liverpool. It confined its early activities to organising the Annual National Championships, being at that time just one of many archery Societies; and it did not become the governing body for the UK until much later. Following this, it became mandatory – rather than optional – for every archer who wished to enter a competition or shoot at a club to become a GNAS member for insurance purposes, and administration was through clubs, counties and regions.\nThree older and historically important societies – all of which survive today – were the Royal Toxophilites (founded in 1781), the Woodmen of Arden (founded in 1785), and the Royal Company of Archers (founded in 1676). They are independent of the GNAS, although some members may belong to both.\nWith archery now firmly established in the Olympics, GNAS/Archery GB has seen many international successes and British archers have won a total of 4 medals since the restoration of the sport in the 1972 Olympic Games.\nNational Events.\nArchery GB hold a series of National Championships, Events and also a National Tour where archers compete over a series of events around the UK and gain points to qualify for a grand finals. \nRebranding as Archery GB.\nAt the Annual General Meeting held at Lilleshall on 19 April 2008, an official announcement was made confirming that \"Archery GB\" would become the trading name of the GNAS. An item in the Summer 2008 edition of \"Archery UK\", the official GNAS magazine, states:"

        "title": "Bobby Carpenter (American football)",
        "text": "Robert Joseph Carpenter III (born August 1, 1983) is an American former professional football player who was a linebacker for seven seasons in the National Football League (NFL), primarily with the Dallas Cowboys. He played college football for the Ohio State Buckeyes, and was selected by the Cowboys in the first round of the 2006 NFL Draft. He also played in the NFL for the Miami Dolphins, the Detroit Lions and the New England Patriots.\nEarly years.\nCarpenter attended Lancaster High School in Lancaster, Ohio, alma mater of Super Bowl champion Jim Cordle. In addition to being a football standout, he was also a member of the swim team. During his senior year, Carpenter was selected All-Ohio first-team in football, and also went to the District Finals in swimming.\nCollege career.\nIn 50 games at Ohio State, Carpenter started 26 times. He registered 191 tackles (121 solos), 14.5 sacks and 23.5 for losses, two forced fumbles, seven passes deflected passes and three interceptions.\nIn 2002, Carpenter played in every game as a true freshman. In 2003, Carpenter started three contests at strongside linebacker, totaling 37 tackles (24 solos), 4.5 sacks, 6.5 stops for losses and a pair of forced fumbles.\nCarpenter was a full-time starter in 2004, lining up at strongside linebacker. He finished second on the team with 93 tackles (46 solos) and registered two sacks with 6.5 stops behind the line of scrimmage. He also deflected three passes and intercepted three others.\nAs a senior in 2005, Carpenter started first eleven games of the 2005 season, finishing fifth on the squad with 49 tackles and second on the team with eight sacks and 10.5 stops for losses, earning second-team All-Big Ten Conference honors. In the final game against Michigan, He fractured his right leg/ankle and was unable to play in the Fiesta Bowl.\nProfessional career.\nDallas Cowboys.\nCarpenter was the Dallas Cowboys' first round selection (18th overall) in the 2006 NFL Draft. It was later reported that head coach Bill Parcells influenced the organization into drafting him, based on his previous experience coaching his father, Rob Carpenter. His best game with the Cowboys came in a 2006 playoff loss to the Seattle Seahawks, where he started at outside linebacker and recorded five tackles and three deflected passes.\nIn 2009, he took over the team's nickel linebacker role after playing mostly on special teams. Over his four-year stint with the Cowboys, Carpenter failed to establish a starting role, registering 96 tackles and 29 special teams tackles. In the fourth episode of the 2008 \"Hard Knocks\" series, Carpenter was continuously beaten in a pads and shorts practice by right tackle Marc Colombo. During that practice Colombo referred to him as \"Barbie Carpenter\", while also making fun of his shoulder length blonde hair.\nSt. Louis Rams.\nCarpenter was traded from the Dallas Cowboys to the St. Louis Rams in exchange for offensive tackle Alex Barron on May 10, 2010. He was cut before the start of the season on September 4.\nMiami Dolphins.\nOn September 6, 2010, the Miami Dolphins signed Carpenter as a free agent, reuniting him with Bill Parcells, who drafted him with the Dallas Cowboys. He was waived on October 18, because of a mistake on his special teams blocking assignment against the Green Bay Packers, that came on the heels of two previous blocking assignment errors against the New England Patriots.\nDetroit Lions.\nCarpenter was signed as a free agent by the Detroit Lions on October 20, 2010. Following the signings of Justin Durant and Stephen Tulloch, it looked like Carpenter would test free agency again, but he was re-signed after the injury and release of Zack Follett. \nOn October 2, 2011, Carpenter had six tackles, a pass deflected and made the play of the game, returning an interception for a touchdown, which sparked a second half come-from-behind victory against his former team, the Dallas Cowboys. The 24-point collapse was Dallas' largest blown lead in team history and eventually cost them a chance to qualify for the post-season.\nNew England Patriots.\nOn April 5, 2012, Carpenter was signed as a free agent by the New England Patriots. He was among the team's final pre-season cuts on September 1. After fellow linebacker Dont'a Hightower suffered a hamstring injury, the Patriots re-signed Carpenter on October 3. He was released on October 31 after playing in four games for New England, mostly on special teams while registering two special teams tackles.\nMedia career.\nIn 2013, Carpenter joined 97.1 The Fan WBNS-FM in Columbus, Ohio and currently serves as a co-host on the morning show, Morning Juice, airing from 6am - 9am. During that time he also appear on Wall to Wall Sports for WBNS 10TV, which was also owned by Dispatch Media Group now owned by Tegna Inc. Carpenter has worked the Ohio State Spring game since 2016 for BTN and has been a color analyst for ESPN 3 since 2017.\nIn 2018, Carpenter became a regular contributor to ESPN's \"Get Up\", which airs daily from 8 AM to 10 AM EST.\nIn 2021, Carpenter began making appearances on \"The Pat McAfee Show\". He is jokingly referred to as \"General Bob\", due to his \"rallying of the troops\" which led to the Big Ten Conference reversing their decision to suspend the 2020 season. In 2023, he has a recurring college football segment, in which he ranks the top five football programs of the past weekend. It has since become a running joke that he always picks his alma mater, Ohio State, as number one.\nPersonal life.\nCarpenter is the son of former Houston Oilers, New York Giants and Los Angeles Rams running back Rob Carpenter. Carpenter and his father both played for Bill Parcells. He has three younger brothers: Jonathan, Georgie and Nathan. Carpenter is married to his wife Cortney, with whom he has four children.\nAfter completing his NFL career in 2013, Carpenter returned to Ohio State and completed his MBA with a specialization in Finance and Strategy. He is now an adjunct professor teaching a course at the Fisher College of Business in Private Equity.\nCarpenter is currently a board member of the 2nd and Seven Foundation, which promotes literacy to second graders throughout Columbus, Ohio, and the nation, and heavily involved with the Buckeye Cruise for Cancer that has raised over $20 million for the James Cancer Hospital since 2008.\nIn April 2022, Carpenter opened Carpenter Heating, Cooling, Plumbing, and Electric in Columbus with co-owner Jeff Fry. He said it is a division of Freeland Contracting, which does large commercial jobs. Carpenter's company will focus on residential clients in central Ohio."

        "title": "Minnesota Golden Gophers men's ice hockey",
        "text": "The Minnesota Golden Gophers men's ice hockey team is the college ice hockey team at the Twin Cities campus of the University of Minnesota. They are members of the Big Ten Conference and compete in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I ice hockey. The Golden Gophers are one of the most prominent and storied programs in college hockey, having made 41 NCAA Tournament appearances and 23 trips to the Frozen Four. They have won five NCAA national championships, in 1974, 1976, 1979, 2002 and 2003. The team also shared the 1929 National Intercollegiate Athletic Association championship with Yale, and captured the national Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) championship for amateur hockey in 1940. \nThe Gophers are currently coached by Bob Motzko, who joined the team in 2018, having previously served as assistant coach on the 2002 and 2003 national championship teams. They have played at Mariucci Arena in Minneapolis since 1993. The team's main historical rivalries are with the University of Wisconsin and the University of North Dakota, although several other schools claim Minnesota as their archrival.\nFor much of the team's history, there has been a strong emphasis on recruiting native Minnesotan high school and junior hockey players, as opposed to out-of-state, Canadian, or European players. This helped high school ice hockey grow in Minnesota, particularly starting with Hall of Famer John Mariucci, who refused to recruit players from Canada. Minnesota high school ice hockey programs grew from 26 in 1945 to over 150 in 1980. Hall of Famer and hockey legend Herb Brooks, who coached the Golden Gophers to three national championships in the 1970s, famously drew on Minnesota talent for his 1980 Miracle on Ice gold medal Olympic team, which included 9 of his former Golden Gophers players. Head coach Doug Woog championed home-grown talent even more, only recruiting Minnesota players in the late 1980s and 1990s. While current rosters occasionally feature players from outside the state, the team continues to heavily recruit Minnesota hockey players to the present day.\nHistory.\nEarly history 1895–1952.\nAccording to records, the first intercollegiate hockey team at the University of Minnesota was organized in 1895 by Dr. H. A. Parkyn, a Toronto native who also played on the school's football team. An early Minnesota team played the Winnipeg Seven at the now demolished Athletic Park in downtown Minneapolis. They lost 11–3.\nIn 1900 George Northrup, Paul Joslyn, and A.R. Gibbons headed a committee to create an official varsity hockey club at the U. Although there was some effort to get Northrop Field flooded, it was ultimately decided to play on Como Lake in St. Paul. Although the 1903 season saw the first scheduled organized competitions for Minnesota hockey, ultimately this season would be the last organized hockey season for almost two decades. In 1910 efforts were made to revive competition and outreach to the University of Chicago and University of Wisconsin, other members of the Big Ten Conference, but these plans never materialized.\nIn January 1914 the Minnesota Board of Regents voted to fund a hockey team. However the University Athletic Board did not officially recognize this team as a varsity team. At this time, a number of fraternity squads existed and other intramural ice hockey competitions were taking place. Professor OS Zelner worked to organize some of this competition. There was also some interest in women's hockey competition.\nIn 1920–1921, a hockey team again skated representing the University of Minnesota. W. Beaupre Eldredge of St. Paul, a student and club player at the time, was very instrumental in organizing the team, promoting the team to the University Board of Regents to become an official varsity sport. For 1921–1922 season the University Athletic Board of Control decided to finally give ice hockey varsity status on January 9, 1922, answering a petition organized by Merle \"Frenchy\" DeForest, the president of a new booster organization for the sport, which itself grew out of enthusiasm for hockey among the interfraternal league. During this season, the team finished with a 7–3 record, led by head coach I.D. MacDonald and captain Chester “Chet” Bros. Other members of the 1921–22 team include center Paul Swanson and wingman Frank R. Pond, who were named captains for the following seasons, Swanson in 1922–23 and Pond in 1923–24. DeForest, Swanson and Pond were all members of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity, while Bros was a member of Delta Tau Delta.\nFor the 1923–1924 season Danish Canadian Emil Iverson assumed the role as head coach. During Iverson's first season as coach the team attained a record of 13–1–0. The team played their games at Minneapolis Arena starting in 1924–1925 season. Such players as Chuck McCabe, Joel Brown, John H. Peterson were accorded All-American honors during this era. Iverson's coaching tenure culminated in Minnesota sharing the National Intercollegiate Athletic Association hockey championship with Yale. Following the 1929–1930 season Emil Iverson accepted a position as coach of the Chicago Blackhawks\nFrank Pond, former team captain, became coach in 1930 after the departure of Emil Iverson. The team's Rookie of the Year award is named in his honor.\nDoc Romnes era (1947–52).\nDuring Romnes's second year, the NCAA sponsored the first Division I Men's hockey tournament. Minnesota did not qualify for the four team playoff during his coaching tenure.\nJohn Mariucci era (1952–66).\nIn the 1952 season, John Mariucci led the Gophers to the National Championship game, with a 23–6 record, after going 13–13 the year before.\nMariucci was a driving force behind the philosophy of stacking the team with Minnesota talent. Even while other programs brought in older and bigger Canadian prospects, Mariucci thoroughly believed in growing the game in Minnesota, from the ground up. He held coaching clinics, and opened ice rinks in numerous Minnesota towns. This, combined with a sense of pride that the Gophers' roster was stacked with Minnesota talent, was monumental for Minnesota taking a real step forward in producing hockey talent.\nGeorge Nagobads was hired as the team's physician in 1958, and remained with the team until 1992.\nGlen Sonmor era (1966–71).\nAfter coaching one season at Ohio State, Glen Sonmor became the head coach of the Gophers in 1966. Sonmor's Gophers started off slowly, finishing 8th, 5th, and 5th in the WCHA during Sonmor's first 3 seasons behind the bench. Things turned around for the Gophers in the 1969–70 season, as Sonmor led the team to its first WCHA Championship in 16 seasons, finishing with a 21–12–0 record. In the process, Sonmor was named the WCHA Coach of the Year.\nThe following season, the Gophers ended a 10-year NCAA Tournament drought, along with capturing a WCHA Tournament Championship. Sonmor led the Gophers to the NCAA Championship game, beating Harvard 6–5 in the first round. The Gophers lost to Boston University in the Championship game, by a score of 4–2.\nDuring Sonmor's rather short tenure as Minnesota's head coach, the team saw attendance rise 60 percent. Sonmor finished his career with a 78–80–6 record, and coached 3 All Americans: Gary Gambucci (1968), Murray McLachlan (1970), and Wally Olds (1970). Sonmor left the Gophers after the 1971 season, to coach the Minnesota Fighting Saints of the World Hockey Association. Sonmor returned later to be the radio analyst for the Gophers on WCCO-AM.\nBrad Buetow era (1979–85).\nBrad Buetow was head coach from 1979 to 1985. At the start of the 1984–85 season, he hired Thomas \"Chico\" Adrahtas as an assistant coach. The team won 31 games, came in second in the WCHA, and made the NCAA tournament. Adrahtas has been accused by a number of former players of coercing them into oral sex. The United States Center for SafeSport investigated, and issued its decision declaring that Adrahtas was permanently ineligible \"from participating, in any capacity, in any event, program, activity, or competition authorized by, organized by, or under the auspices of the United States Olympic &amp; Paralympic Committee (USOPC), the National Governing Bodies recognized by the USOPC, a Local Affiliated Organization as defined by the Code, or any High Performance Management Organization (HPMO), or at a facility under the jurisdiction of the same.\"\nChampionships.\nNational Championships.\nRunners-up in 1953, 1954, 1971, 1975, 1981, 1989, 2014, and 2023.\nTrophies.\nBig Ten Regular Season Championship Trophy:\nBig Ten Tournament Championship Trophy:\nMacNaughton Cup 13 times as WCHA regular season champions:\nBroadmoor Trophy once as WCHA regular season champions (1983) and six times as the WCHA Tournament champions:\nNorth Star College Cup, the annual intrastate tournament vs. Minnesota-Duluth, Minnesota State, St. Cloud State, and Bemidji State:\nMariucci Classic Champions 14 times:\nIce Breaker Invitational Champions three times:\nMariucci-Bessone Coaches Trophy for series vs. Michigan State, started in 1993 (Minnesota leads series 13–5–5):\nMariucci-Renfrew Coaches Trophy for series vs. Michigan, started in 1993 (Minnesota leads series: 10–9–2):\nFrom 1959 to 1981, an annual Big Ten champion was crowned for the best record in regular season games among active Big Ten members, 10 times:\nSeason-by-season results.\nSource:\nRecords by opponent.\nSource:\nRivalries.\nThe Gophers have historic rivalries with some of the top men's ice hockey programs in the NCAA, including both in-state as well as out of state rivalries.\nOut of state rivalries include the University of Wisconsin Badgers and the University of North Dakota Fighting Hawks. The Gophers' rivalry against the Badgers is part of the annual \"Border Battle,\" in which both universities keep a tallied score of all athletic competitions against one another.\nThe Gophers were engaged in one of the most notorious rivalries in college hockey history with the Boston University Terriers for over 30 years from 1963 to 1995. The rivalry came to its peak during the 1976 NCAA Championship Semi-Final when a bench-clearing brawl occurred only 70 seconds into the game, delaying it for nearly 30 minutes. The Gophers would go on to win the game 4–2 and subsequently, the Championship. A number of players on both teams would end up playing together for the gold medal-winning Miracle on Ice Team USA during the 1980 Winter Olympics, coached by Minnesota Head Coach Herb Brooks. The rivalry began its decline in 1984, when the Gophers would become members of the Western Collegiate Hockey Association and the Terriers the Hockey East Division, resulting in a steep decline in games against one another.\nDue to the fact the State of Minnesota has six NCAA Division I hockey programs, the Gophers naturally share a rivalry with four of them: University of Minnesota-Duluth Bulldogs, St. Cloud State University Huskies, Minnesota State University, Mankato Mavericks and Bemidji State University Beavers. Four of the six programs (excluding Bemidji State and St. Thomas) participated in the inaugural North Star College Cup tournament during the 2013–2014 Ice Hockey Season.\nPlayers.\nOlympians.\nThis is a list of Minnesota alumni were a part of an Olympic team.\nHonored members.\nThe Gophers have retired only one number. On November 15, 1998, the team retired John Mayasich's number 8. Mayasich, a two-time All-American, played four seasons with the Gophers (1951–1955) and holds team records for goals and points scored both in a game and for a career. Although he was a member of the silver medal 1956 and gold medal 1960 Winter Olympic U.S. hockey teams, he only played professionally briefly, in minor league hockey.\nFour players from the University of Minnesota have won the Hobey Baker Award, awarded annually to \"the outstanding collegiate hockey player in the United States.\" Neal Broten (1978–1981) became the award's first recipient in 1981. Robb Stauber (1986–1989) won the award as a sophomore in 1988, becoming the first goaltender to be so honored. Brian Bonin (1992–1996) won the award in 1996 after nearly winning it the previous season. In 2002, Jordan Leopold (1998–2002) became the first University of Minnesota player to win both the Hobey Baker Award and an NCAA Championship in the same season.\nErik Johnson, Phil Kessel, Thomas Vanek, Blake Wheeler, Kyle Okposo, Erik Rasmussen, Douglas Zmolek, Keith Ballard, Michael Ramsey, Tom Chorske, Nick Leddy, Nick Bjugstad, David Fischer, Jordan Schroeder, Kris Chucko, Patrick White, Brady Skjei, James O'Brien, Jeff Taffe, Ryan Johnson, Chaz Lucius, Logan Cooley, Jimmy Snuggerud, Sam Rinzel, Oliver Moore.\nStatistical Leaders.\nSource:\nCareer goaltending leaders.\n\"GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\"\nCoaches.\nIn their eighty-five season history, the Gophers have had a total of fourteen head coaches, including three interim coaches. John Mariucci took a one-year leave of absence during the 1955–1956 season to serve as head coach of the U.S. men's hockey team that won the silver medal at the 1956 Winter Olympics. Halfway through the 1971–1972 season, Glen Sonmor left the Gophers to become the general manager and head coach for the Minnesota Fighting Saints of the World Hockey Association. Doug Woog was suspended for two games during the 1996–1997 season for concealing an illegal payment to a former player after his scholarship ended. During this time, assistant head coach Mike Guentzel served as the team's head coach.\nIn 2009, Assistant Coach John Hill coached 2 games while Don Lucia was out for medical reasons.\nAll-time coaching records.\nSource:\nProgram records.\nSeason.\nPlayers\nTeam (since 1950)\nGame.\nPlayer\nTeam\nGolden Gophers in the NHL.\nWHA.\nSeveral players also were members of WHA teams.\nSource:"

Along with Frank Washington, Long broke the color barrier in the Carolina League city of Kinston, North Carolina.\nCareer.\nLong's professional debut came with the Birmingham Black Barons of the Negro American League in 1952, and that year, he led the NAL in triples with 8. He stayed with Birmingham through the 1953 season, and in that year, was selected to the Negro League East-West All-Star Game. He started for the East team as its third baseman going hitless with four plate appearances in the All-Star game.\nIn 1954, he was signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates and was sent to their minor league team, the St. Jean Canadians of the Provincial League, in the Province of Quebec in Canada. During 1955, Long played for the Billings Mustangs in the Pioneer League and also saw some action for Phoenix in the Arizona–Mexico League.\nLong made his debut for the Kinston Eagles on April 17, 1956. During the year, he hit .291 with 18 home runs and 111 runs batted in. The Carolina League itself had been integrated in 1951 by Percy Miller Jr. of the Danville Leafs. The 111 RBI tallied by Long in 1956 has been equaled over time but has never been surpassed by any subsequent Kinston players.\nAfter playing with the Kinston Eagles in 1956, Long next played for the Beaumont Pirates of the Big State League and in the Mexican League, with the Mexico City Tigers, in 1957. A shoulder injury then curtailed his active playing career at which he left baseball to live in Kinston.\nLater life.\nLong continued to break barriers after his baseball career was over, becoming Kinston's first black bus driver as well as Lenoir County's first black Deputy Sheriff and black detective within the sheriff's department.\nLong often attended games at Grainger Stadium to watch Kinston's current team, the Kinston Indians. He was honored by the Indians with \"Carl Long Day\" games, and in 2003 he was inducted into the Kinston Professional Baseball Hall of Fame. He has traveled extensively to promote the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum.\nCarl Long died on January 12, 2015, at the age of 79, after being hospitalized from a series of minor strokes he suffered in November 2014."

        "text": "The Topps Company has created a number of different baseball card products during its existence. They originally started as a chewing gum company, using the baseball cards as a sales gimmick to make the gum more popular, but today it is primarily a baseball card company.\nTopps brands.\nFactory sets.\nTopps remains the only baseball card company today to still offer factory sets of their base brand. Their first factory set was offered in 1974 exclusively in the J.C. Penney catalog, but Topps would not begin releasing factory sets again until 1982. The 1982 Topps Factory Set is rare due to J.C. Penney's failure to sell them. J.C. Penney factory sets were available in 1982 in a color box and 1983 (SKU 672–1203), 1984 (SKU 672–1641), and 1985 (SKU 672–2029) in brown boxes. From 1986 to 1992, Topps factory sets came in two designs, Retail (or Christmas) and Hobby dealer. Retail factory sets were in very colorful boxes and were typically released near Christmas time (and for that reason are sometimes called Christmas sets). Hobby dealer sets were in much plainer boxes until 1993. Topps continues to this day to offer not only retail, hobby, and Christmas sets, but also team themed factory sets (starting in 2004) with bonus cards exclusive to each one.\nTiffany sets.\nFrom 1984 to 1991, Topps released a limited edition version of both their regular and traded sets called \"Tiffany\" sets. These sets were released in hobby dealer exclusive factory set format only and are identical to the regular cards, but these were printed in Ireland with white cardboard (instead of the then-standard gray cardboard) with a glossy finish on the front. The color of the inner boxes the Tiffany sets came in as well as the estimated number of sets produced (according to the annual Beckett price guide) are:\nBowman.\nBowman was Topps' main competitor from 1951 until Topps bought out Bowman after the 1955 season. Almost 35 years later, in 1989, Topps resurrected the Bowman brand and created a new annual baseball card set which was unique in two ways. First, the 1989 Bowman cards were 2.5\" x 3.75\" instead of the standard 2.5\" x 3.5\" card size (they went back to standard size from 1990 onwards however) and second, its main focus was on upcoming minor league players who Topps believed had a good chance of making it to the majors someday, which continues to be the focus of the Bowman set today. Although the Bowman sets were not very popular in its first three years, that changed in 1992 when Bowman was upgraded to a premium quality set (with UV coating on both sides and a special subset with bronze foil borders), and very limited production. Since then, Bowman has become more and more oriented towards prospects and rookies. New sets from several sister brands, as well as the core Bowman brand itself, continue to be released each year.\nSince the mid-1990s the vast majority of the MLB's top stars were featured on a Bowman card prior to appearing in any other set. The incredible sustained level of success enjoyed by the Bowman brand has spurred a number of spin-off products, including Bowman Chrome, Bowman Sterling, Bowman Draft Picks and Prospects, Bowman's Best, Bowman Originals, and most recently, Bowman Platinum. The key to the brand's success lies in the fact that Bowman and Bowman Chrome rookie cards are typically the most valuable and sought after of all rookie cards. This is especially true for its baseball card releases.\nStadium Club.\nTopps released their first \"premium\" set in 1991 called Stadium Club. This was the very first major baseball card set to feature glossy UV coating on both sides of the card as well as gold foil stamping on the front and a borderless (or \"full-bleed\") Kodak photo on the front. The back of the card also featured an image of the player's first Topps card. This set was a major hit at the time with packs costing $5 or more. In 1992, Topps released three different series of Stadium Club cards. There was also a factory set from 1992 in which cards were packed in a reproduction dome stadium, made of plastic, but this was not the same as the regular 1992 Stadium Club set.\nTopps Finest.\nTopps released their first \"super premium\" set in 1993 called Topps Finest (or just Finest for short). These were issued in six card packs with 18 packs in a box and 12 boxes per case, and only 4,000 cases were produced. This set was also a major hit with packs costing around $25 at the time. Many hobbyists, however, frowned upon such an expensive set thinking that it was driving the hobby away from younger collectors. Topps also included a Finest All-Star jumbo card (limited to about 1455 of each) in each box (a 4\" x 6\" version of the All-Star subset) and randomly inserted (1 in 18 packs) a Refractor insert card which was exactly like the regular card but with a rainbow sheen on the front with some of them worth over $1000 at that time. Only 241 of each Refractor were produced and continue to this day to be highly sought after.\nTopps Heritage / Bowman Heritage / Allen &amp; Ginter.\nIn 2001, Topps (for its fiftieth anniversary) released two new retro themed brands, Topps Heritage and Bowman Heritage, as part of its baseball, football and hockey card product lines. The novelty was that the brands had modern players with designs from past years. The baseball cards had the design from 1952 for its 2001 selection of Heritage baseball cards, 1953 design for 2002, 1954 design for 2003, and so on. Bowman Heritage was also started in 2001 and used the following throwback designs:\nThe Bowman Heritage brand was retired after the 2007 release, replaced by the much more popular and emerging Allen &amp; Ginter brand that captivated collectors with its 2006 debut. In 2019, Bowman Heritage returned as an online-only exclusive product using the 1953 Bowman design. Topps Heritage became a baseball exclusive brand in 2007 where it is still an active brand to this day. It is widely considered to be one of the most popular perennial preseason baseball card release.\nTopps T206.\nThe \"T206\" name (originally issued in 1909-11 by the American Tobacco Company) has been revived by Topps (under the \"Topps 206\" brand) a total three times, the first in 2002 with a second revival in 2010. Again in 2020, the company released a new collection divided into five different series, with the first (50 cards) being released in May 2020. The collection, named \"Topps 206\", include players from both, Major and Minor League. The 5th series was released in September 2020.\nThe T206 Honus Wagner card was reissued by Topps in 2002, with variations on its background color. The card was printed with the original orange color of 1909 (#179), and also in blue (#307) and red (#456). In 2020, a new Honus Wagner card was issued by the company (#45) as part of the second wave (of 5) released that year.\nTopps Project 2020.\nIn 2020 Topps released Project 2020, a 400 card online exclusive set which featured 20 artists rendition of 20 iconic Topps Cards.\nTopps baseball cards outside the United States.\nA Canadian licensed version of the Topps set was produced by candy company O-Pee-Chee from 1965 until 1992. From 1970 onward, the cards were bilingual in order to comply with Canadian language laws. There were also licensed version Topps sets issued in Venezuela from 1959 to 1977, with some changes and the addition of winter league players. In the late 1980s, Topps issued two sets for the United Kingdom market of American baseball players, complete with explanations of key baseball terms on the cards.\nProducts by year.\nEach year, Topps faced the challenge of designing new cards to distinguish them from the year before. The 1952 - 56 sets were varied in presentation, but each were the same size, 2 5/8\" x 3 3/4\". The '52, '53 and '54 sets were vertical, the '55 and '56 sets horizontal. In 1957, the 2 1/2 x 3 1/2\" size card became standard. Also, the design changed dramatically and was now a photograph of the player and not a painting (particularly 1953). The 1957 set is one of the most sought after by hobbyists due to the photographic quality and simple card design. The 1957 set is almost borderless, and the player name, team name, and position are printed in small letters so the photograph of the player is the dominant feature. More colorful designs and larger borders resumed again until the highly popular 1961 set, which again has smaller borders and less obtrusive team names, player names, and positions.\nUntil 1964, the colors of the borders, print, letters, etc. was random. Starting with the '64 set, Topps began a trend where each team had their own color scheme. For example, every Dodger card in the 1964 set featured the team name \"Dodgers\" in red across the top of the card, with the player name and position written in a powder blue field along the bottom of the card. Topps generally had 10 different color scheme designs per year, one for each team in their respective league (National and American). Thus, one team in each league shared the same color scheme with one team in the other league.\nStarting in 1966, Topps assigned a color scheme to each team that would repeat itself in the 1968 and 1969 sets. The schemes were as follows:\nThe 1969 set introduced two new color schemes to accommodate the expansion teams that began play in that year:\nPlayer depictions.\nPlayers generally gave multiple poses for Topps, and Topps chose which one to put on a card. Among these were head shots of the player with no cap, in case he was traded or the team moved. In 1966, the Braves moved from Milwaukee to Atlanta, so every card of a Braves player in the early series of cards is a head shot with no cap, or the cap logo is obstructed or hidden in some way (profile or cap tilted up). Only in the later series are there cards with Braves players wearing the new cap with the letter \"A\". The same is true for the Angels, whose move from Los Angeles to Anaheim caused a change in their cap logo from and \"LA\" to a \"CA\" as they switched from being called the Los Angeles Angels to the California Angels. In later years, Topps developed an airbrush technique where the cap logo would be manually altered or blacked out. For example, the 1968 Athletics, after moving from Kansas City to Oakland, are pictured wearing blacked out caps with green bills.\nTopps generally put the biggest stars on card numbers ending in x00 or x50. For example, in the 1966 set, Mickey Mantle is card #50 and Sandy Koufax is card #100. In 1965, Willie Mays is card #250. Other star players were put on card numbers ending in zero (10, 20, 140, 270, etc.) and minor stars were put on cards ending in \"5\". Topps continues this numbering system (at least to a degree) today."

        "title": "Rugby Lions",
        "text": "The Rugby Lions RFC, nicknamed \"The Lions\", is an English rugby union club based in Rugby, Warwickshire. The club plays its home matches at Webb Ellis Road. Its developmental squad is known as the Crusaders. The club also has a ladies team known as the Lionesses. It currently competes in Counties 3 Midlands East (South) at the ninth tier of the English rugby union system, having been readmitted to the league pyramid from at the start of the 2022-23 season.\nHistory.\nThe Rugby Lions is one of only three rugby union teams in England permitted to wear an all-white strip, with the England national team and Rugby School being the others. In recent times, the Lions have not exercised this right, with the home kit normally using black shorts. For the final game of the 2011–12 season against Hinckley however, the Lions appeared in white shorts as well. In a four-year span from April 2011 to September 2015, the Lions did not lose a single league fixture, winning all 60 matches in that period before their run was ended by a 31-35 defeat at Ledbury RFC in the 2015-16 season opener.\nOn 17 August 2012, the \"Rugby Advertiser\" released an announcement, within which was an RFU statement, which confirmed that the Lions had failed to pay off their debts in time, and had been removed from National League 2 South. It did not however say anything concerning whether or not the Lions would still compete in any division in 2012–13. At a public meeting held on 30 August, attended by over 200 people, club owner David Owen revealed that the Lions would indeed not be competing in any league for the 2012–13 season, but would instead be organising a series of friendlies. The club used the help of many supporters and local clubs to help out. With many of those present at the meeting putting their names down to volunteer. Twenty fixtures had to be fulfilled to demonstrate that the club was able to put out a side and run successfully as a club. Many former players including the clubs 'tailenders' team came together to enable the Lions to fulfill those matches.\nIn May 2013, it was announced that the Lions' bid to be accepted back into the RFU league system had been successful, although they were forced to rejoin at the lowest possible level, Midlands 5 West (South). On 9 August 2013, it was announced that the Lions would be featured on BT Sport's rugby programming into the new season; with the Lions' First XV travelling to the studio to participate in filming on the indoor pitch.\n2011–12 season.\nIn July 2011, businessman – and ex-player – Michael Aland bought the club, with an ambition to becoming a Premiership side in around 5 years. Soon after, he recruited several highly experienced players and coaches, including Neil Back (Head Coach) and Ben Gollings (Player/Backs Coach). Having been relegated to the National League 3 Midlands previous season, most players from the previous season had left the club. Players who remained with the club included Nick Walton, Ben Nuttall, Callum Tucker, Fraser Tait, Matt Mountford, Neil Davies, Paul Davies and Jack Young. This meant that almost all of the entire 2011–12 squad had to be either bought or promoted from the youth team. Some of the players brought in had been at the club before, such as Ade Hales and Beau Carney. \nThe new additions worked, with the Lions winning every game in the first half of the season, a run they carried on into 2012. The league title was secured with two games remaining on 31 March 2012 in the home game against Dudley Kingswinford, with the Lions triumphing 19–14. The Lions also won the Warwickshire Cup, winning 10–9 in the final against Sutton Coldfield."

        "text": "The Liga Națională de Rugby () is a professional rugby union club competition that is played in Romania. In the 2023 season there are 14 teams competing. The competition was established in 1913 and is governed by the Romanian Rugby Federation. Steaua București is the most successful club in the competition with 24 titles.\nHistory.\nThe first Romanian competition took place in 1914 between two Bucharest team's in Tennis Club Român and Sporting Club with Tennis Club Român taking out the first title winning both of the matches by eight and three points respectively. The competition expanded and grew in the 1920s and 1930s (with a peak in the 1970s and 1980s), after Stadiul Român and seventeen more (other) teams were founded in Bucharest-only ever since. The championship took place on an annual basis, with some gap years caused by the two World Wars mostly.\nThe first team set up outside Bucharest (to play the top-tier competition) was IAR Brașov in 1939, a team owned and run by the famous Braşov aircraft factory I.A.R. \"(Industria Aeronautică Română)\", but the first one to become champion of Romania was Universitatea Timișoara, only in 1972.\nThe European Champions Cup in its early years (1960s) used to be a Franco-Romanian affair, with RC Grivița București (1964) and Dinamo (1967) grabbing their fair share of glory. In 1995 it was Farul Constanţa the team to represent Romania in the newly born Heineken Cup (splitting with Stade Toulousain the honour of playing on home ground the first ever match of the competition), but that was to be followed by no other participation of a Romanian side ever since (as of 2020). Nonetheless, the Romanian teams turned to the European Challenge Cup although never actually advanced to the quarterfinals. To better cope with the strong clubs of the 6 Nations countries the Romanian Rugby Union pulled together an all-domestic franchise - Stejarii \"(The Oaks)\", to be later renamed Lupii București \"(Bucharest Wolves)\" - but despite the healthy idea and some gleams of success, the mighty SuperLiga clubs forced the Romanian Rugby Establishment to back off and allow again the champions of the SuperLiga to take part in the European Challenge Cup."

        "title": "Panmure Golf Club",
        "text": "Panmure Golf Club is a golf club close to the village of Barry, Angus, Scotland. It is one of the clubs that originally helped purchase the Amateur Championship trophy, and is one of the oldest golf clubs in the world, dating back to 1845. It is a private club that plays over the Barry Links, and is sometimes referred to as \"Barry\" or \"Panmure Barry\". Due to its location next to Carnoustie it is often overlooked by visitors, and with the number of members limited to 500 it is one of the most underplayed courses in Scotland.\nThe Course.\nAlthough Panmure is a links course, it has some unusual features. The course is a mile or more from the sea, and many holes have trees which rarely come into play but create an unusual backdrop to the rolling links holes. The first and last three holes are flat, but the middle twelve holes are classic links holes. This is because the clubhouse had to be built near to a railway station, and the first and last three holes were needed to get to the land where the course was originally going to be built. It is also not a very long course at 6511 yards from the championship tees. It served as the final qualifying course for the 1999 Open Championship at Carnoustie due to the well known \"barry rough\" that flanks every fairway, making accuracy from the tee essential.\nBen Hogan.\nPanmure is famous for being the place where Ben Hogan practiced away from the attention of the media, prior to his only Open Championship appearance at Carnoustie in 1953. On the sixth hole, he suggested that a bunker at the front right of the green would improve the hole, and one was subsequently created, known to this day as \"hogan's bunker\". Hogan spent much of his time hitting shots to the 17th green.\nClubhouse.\nPanmure's clubhouse is modeled spiritually on the Royal Calcutta Golf Club.\nPanmure was again a final qualifying course for the 2007 Open Championship at Carnoustie, and despite being the shortest course by far, it had the highest winning score of all three qualifiers having a 36 hole score of -5, as opposed to around -9 or -10 at the other 2 courses."

        "title": "Norway women's national handball team",
        "text": "The Norway women's national handball team represents Norway at international handball competitions, and is governed by the Norges Håndballforbund (NHF). As of 2023, Norway has been in 25 finals and is regarded as one of the finest women's national handball teams ever, with 32 medals.\nNorway women's national handball team holds the distinction in the sport for being the only handball team, on the women's side, and men's side, to have won the European Championship four consecutive times. Their 9 gold medals is a sport record. In 2011, they became the sport's third team and the second Women's team, following Denmark to have held all three titles simultaneously: The World Championship, the Olympic Championship and the Euro Championship. In 2015, they won the World Championship and have the distinction of the first Women's handball team to hold simultaneously international titles twice: the 2015 World Championship, the 2014 European Championship and the 2012 Olympic Championship.\nAs of November 2022, they are the reigning double European champions.\nHistory.\nNorway has been among the world elite in women's handball since the break-through at the 1986 World Championship where the team won a bronze medal. Since then, Norway has won eight European Championships, and four World Championships. Norway has been in four final matches at the Summer Olympics, and gold medaled in Beijing 2008 and London 2012. Norway is unsurpassed in the European Championships, having won eight golds, three silvers, and one bronze in fourteen tournaments. The 2000 European Championship where they ended 6th and in the 2018 European Championship where they ended 5th, is the only times Norway finished outside of the top three.\nEarly years (1946–1983).\nThe very first match of the Norwegian women's national handball team, against Sweden in 1946, was met with great public interest. The game ended 2–5 in favour of Sweden. During the fifties and sixties women's handball had a relatively low profile in Norway. The national team regularly participated at the Scandinavian Championships, and they qualified for the World Championships in 1971, 1973, 1975 and 1982, placing 7th twice and 8th twice.\nJacobsen period (1984–1993).\nSven-Tore Jacobsen coached the national team for ten years, from 1984 to 1993. The team qualified for the 1986 World Championships, where they sensationally won the bronze medal, and they achieved Olympic silver medals in both 1988 and 1992. The press coverage and popularity of female handball in Norway increased significantly during this period.\nBreivik period (1994–2009).\nFormer player Marit Breivik coached the team from 1994 to 2009. During her tenure, the team won six gold medals in international championships. Their achievements included gold medals at the 1999 World Championships, four gold medals at the European Championships from 1998 to 2008, and gold medals at the 2008 Summer Olympics. Their play strategy included a strong 6–0 defense and frequent fast breaks on offense.\n2008.\nAfter the defeat against Russia at the 2007 World Championship, Norway faced two important challenges in 2008: Olympic Games in August and European Championship in December. The team won their first Olympic gold medal, and they won the European Championship.\nOlympic Games 2008, Beijing.\nNorway had qualified for the 2008 Summer Olympics by winning the 2006 European Championship. The preparation for Beijing started months before the competition started, but the final squad wasn't decided until the last weeks. Several players who had trained with the team up to this point were left out or kept as reserves, most notably Isabel Blanco and Terese Pedersen. There were no debuts in the group selected by Marit Breivik, but veteran Tonje Larsen made her comeback to the team after five years of struggle with injury. Gro Hammerseng maintained her usual role of team captain, with Else-Marthe Sørlie Lybekk and Gøril Snorroeggen completing the \"captains team\" as vice-captains.\nThe competition for the Norwegian team started on 9 August against the host, China. They defeated the Chinese 30–26 and then went on to win comfortably against Angola (31–17), Kazakhstan (35–19) and France (34–24). The closest result of the preliminary round was the last match, on 17 August, against Romania (24–23). During the warm up of this match Katja Nyberg suffered a knee injury that prevented her from playing the quarter final against Sweden. Norway defeated the Swedish team 31–24, advancing to the semi-finals comfortably.\nThe semi-final match was played on 21 August. Former Olympic and World Champions South Korea turned out to be the toughest opponent of the tournament. After 58 minutes of play Norway was leading 28–25. In less than two minutes the Koreans managed to score three goals in a row, reaching the tie score of 28–28 with only two seconds left. Katrine Lunde Haraldsen quickly started the last attack of the game with a pass to Karoline Dyhre Breivang, who was already at the middle of the field. Breivang passed the ball on to Hammerseng who scored at the 60 minutes mark. The goal was validated by the referees but the Norwegians refrained from celebrating until the IHF delegate finally confirmed the decision.\nThe final match was played on 23 August. It was a replay of the 2007 World Championship, Norway vs Russia. The Norwegian victory was secured early on. They were already leading by 10 goals after 14 minutes played and Trefilov's team never managed to lower that margin below a five-goal difference. The match ended 34–27 for Norway. Linn-Kristin Riegelhuth was top scorer with nine goals out of ten shots.\nThe Norwegian team received their first Olympic gold medal after the final match. Two Norwegian players were selected into the tournament's All-Star Team: Katrine Lunde Haraldsen as goalkeeper and Else-Marthe Soerlie-Lybekk as pivot. Lunde Haraldsen was also overall top goalkeeper with a 42% save rate while Kari Aalvik Grimsbø ranked first (together with Korean Oh Yongran) at 7-metres shots with a 40% rate. Regarding team statistics, Lybekk finished the tournament as Norway's top scorer with 31 goals and a 72% scoring rate, two points ahead of Riegelhuth who scored the same number of goals but with a 70% success rate.\nEuropean Championship 2008, Macedonia.\nAfter the Olympic Games, Breivik encountered challenges for the 2008 European Championship: Lybekk retired from the national team, Snorroeggen was recovering from a shoulder injury and both Hammerseng and Nyberg would forego international play in order to recover from recent sport activity with only club matches.\nThus a new squad was formed. Three players made their debut: Heidi Løke (pivot) and Tine Rustad Kristiansen (centre back) from Larvik, and Camilla Herrem (left wing) from Byåsen. With the three members of the Olympic \"captains team\" out, Kristine Lunde was appointed new captain with Marit Malm Frafjord and Karoline Dyhre Breivang as vice-captains.\nNorway was a favorite to win the European title, especially after winning the GF World Cup '08 and Møbelringen Cup 2008. Spain was not overcome with the perceived invincibility of the competition when Norway lost to them the first match of the tournament on 3 December. The Norwegians could only tie 21–21 against Spain, the same team which left them out of the 2004 Summer Olympics in 2003. Following that first disappointment, they managed to advance through the preliminary round and main round without a loss.\nThe semi-final match was played on 13 December against Russia. It was an easy win for Norway and even goalkeeper Haraldsen was able to score once. On 14 December, Spain was waiting at the final match. After an even first half the score was 13–12 for the defending champions. During the second half Norway increased the lead to a final score of 34–21.\nEuro 2008 was the third European Championship gold in a row for Norway, and the fourth title in the history of the team. Linn-Kristin Riegelhuth was top scorer of the tournament with 51 goals and four Norwegian players were included in the All-Star Team: Riegelhuth as right wing, Katrine Lunde Haraldsen as goalkeeper, Tonje Larsen as left back and Kristine Lunde as center back. Lunde was also named MVP.\nHergeirsson period (2009–).\nIn 2009 Thorir Hergeirsson took over as coach, and the first season resulted in a bronze medal at the 2009 World Championships. A year later, in 2010, the team won its 5th European Championship title and in 2011 its second World Championship. In August 2012, the team defended its Beijing Olympic gold by beating Montenegro 26–23 in the final at the Olympic Games in London. In the European Championship the same year, the two teams met again. This time Montenegro beat Norway, who won silver. The Norwegian team won another gold medal at the 2014 European Women's Handball Championship, and at the 2015 World Women's Handball Championship in Denmark they won their third World Championship title. They won a bronze medal at the 2016 Olympics, having lost to Russia in the semi-final after extra time. At the 2016 European Women's Handball Championship in Sweden, the Norwegian team won their seventh title. The team won a silver medal at the 2017 World Women's Handball Championship in Germany, defeated by France in the final. At the 2018 European Women's Handball Championship in France they failed to reach the semi-finals, but finished 5th after defeating Sweden in the top 5 match.\nCompetitive record.\n Champions   Runners-up   Third place   Fourth place  \nOlympic Games.\nSince their first appearance in 1988, Norway has participated in eight Olympic Games. They received their first gold medal twenty years after the debut, in Beijing 2008.\nWorld Championship.\nNorway received their first World Championship medal in 1986, when they defeated three-time champions East Germany 23–19 in the third place play-off, marking also their first ever win over East Germany. They achieved a bronze medal in 1993, and a silver medal in 1997. In 1999 Norway won their first gold medal after a final match against France that needed two overtimes to break the tie. They won their second title in 2011, and their third title in 2015.\nEuropean Championship.\nAs of 2020, Norway has participated in every European Championship that has taken place. They are the most successful team in the Championships, having won nine golds, three silvers, and one bronze out of fourteen tournaments. The two times Norway finished outside of the top three were at the 2000 Championship in Romania and the 2018 Championship in France.\nTeam.\nCurrent squad.\nThe squad for the EHF Euro Cup 2024 against Hungary and Switzerland in April 2024.\nHead coach: Þórir Hergeirsson\n\"Caps and goals as of 6 April 2024.\"\nPast squads.\n1971 World Championship (7th place)\n1973 World Championship (8th place)\n1975 World Championship (8th place)\nCoach: Frode Kyvåg\n1982 World Championship (7th place)\nCoach: Karen Fladset\n1986 World Championship (Third place)\nCoach: Sven-Tore Jacobsen\n1988 Summer Olympics (Second place)\nCoach: Sven-Tore Jacobsen\n1990 World Championship (6th place)\nCoach: Sven-Tore Jacobsen\n1992 Summer Olympics (Second place)\nCoach: Sven-Tore Jacobsen\n1993 World Championship (Third place)\nCoach: Sven-Tore Jacobsen\n1994 European Championship (Third place)\nCoach: Marit Breivik\n1995 World Championship (4th place)\nCoach: Marit Breivik\n1996 Summer Olympics (4th place)\nCoach: Marit Breivik\n1996 European Championship (Second place)\nCoach: Marit Breivik\n1997 World Championship (Second place)\nCoach: Marit Breivik\n1998 European Championship (Winner)\nCoach: Marit Breivik\n1999 World Championship (Winner)\nCoach: Marit Breivik\n2000 Summer Olympics (Third place)\nCoach: Marit Breivik\n2000 European Championship (6th place)\nCoach: Marit Breivik\n2001 World Championship (Second place)\nCoach: Marit Breivik\n2002 European Championship (Second place)\nCoach: Marit Breivik\n2003 World Championship (6th place)\nCoach: Marit Breivik\n2004 European Championship (Winner)\nCoach: Marit Breivik\n2005 World Championship (9th place)\nCoach: Marit Breivik\n2006 European Championship (Winner)\nCoach: Marit Breivik\n2007 World Championship (Second place)\nCoach: Marit Breivik\n2008 Summer Olympics (Winner)\nCoach: Marit Breivik\n2008 European Championship (Winner)\nCoach: Marit Breivik\n2009 World Championship (Third place)\nCoach: Thorir Hergeirsson\n2010 European Championship (Winner)\nCoach: Thorir Hergeirsson\n2011 World Championship (Winner)\nCoach: Thorir Hergeirsson\n2012 Summer Olympics (Winner)\nCoach: Thorir Hergeirsson\n2012 European Championship (Second place)\nCoach: Thorir Hergeirsson\n2013 World Championship (5th place)\nCoach: Thorir Hergeirsson\n2014 European Championship (Winner)\nCoach: Thorir Hergeirsson\n2015 World Championship (Winner)\nCoach: Thorir Hergeirsson\n2016 Summer Olympics (Third place)\nCoach: Thorir Hergeirsson\n2016 European Championship (Winner)\nCoach: Thorir Hergeirsson\n2017 World Championship (Second place)\nCoach: Thorir Hergeirsson\n2018 European Championship (5th place)\nCoach: Thorir Hergeirsson\n2019 World Championship (4th place)\nCoach: Thorir Hergeirsson\n2020 European Championship (Winner)\nCoach: Thorir Hergeirsson\n2020 Summer Olympics (Third place)\nCoach: Thorir Hergeirsson\n2021 World Championship (Winner)\nCoach: Thorir Hergeirsson\n2022 European Championship (Winner)\nCoach: Thorir Hergeirsson\n2023 World Championship (Second place)\nCoach: Thorir Hergeirsson\nNotable players.\nSeveral Norwegian players have seen their individual performance recognized at international tournaments, either as Most Valuable Player, top scorer or as a member of the All-Star Team.\nIndividual all-time records.\nMost matches played.\nTotal number of matches played in official competitions only.\nMost goals scored.\nTotal number of goals scored in official matches only."

        "title": "Mick Cronin (rugby league)",
        "text": "Michael William Cronin OAM (born 28 June 1951) is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer and coach. He was a goal-kicking for the Australian national team and a stalwart for the Parramatta Eels club. He played in 22 Tests and 11 World Cup matches between 1973 and 1982. Cronin retired as the NSWRL Premiership's and the Australian Kangaroos' all-time highest point-scorer and has since been named amongst the nation's finest footballers of the 20th century.\nCountry and early representative career.\nCronin played for Christian Brothers (now Edmund Rice) in the Illawarra competition as an under 12. He was so good that when his team made the semi-finals the opposition appealed against Cronin's inclusion on residence grounds, claiming he was from Gerringong. \nCronin's first grade career began in 1969 for Gerringong. He was selected to play for Country in 1973 where he impressed enough to make that year's Kangaroo tour. He played in two Tests and ten minor tour matches and finished as the tour's highest point scorer with seven tries and twenty eight goals. He and Rohan Hancock (Queensland) are the last players to be selected for the Kangaroos from Country Rugby League.\nIn 1974 he was named New South Wales' Country Rugby League Player of the Year. He played in all three Tests of the 1974 domestic Ashes series against Great Britain and the following year he played in NSW Country's historic 1975 win over Sydney City. He was selected in Australia's 1975 World Cup squad and played in five matches in the tournament in the centres alongside Bob Fulton. In a match against Wales in Sydney during the series, he kicked nine goals.\nBy this time Cronin was one of the most eminent rugby league centres in the world, yet he continually rejected big money offers to go to Sydney and played for his home town of Gerringong on the NSW South Coast, where a field is now named in his honour.\nParramatta career.\nIn 1977 Cronin joined the Parramatta Eels but for many years continued to commute to training and matches from Gerringong where he owned and was publican of the local hotel. He played at centre for New South Wales in the inaugural 1980 State of Origin game.\nCronin was a member of Parramatta's star studded backlines of the early 1980s playing alongside Brett Kenny, Steve Ella, Peter Sterling and Eric Grothe. In combination with all of these greats he played in four winning Grand Finals for Parramatta (1981, 1982, 1983 and 1986). Alongside teammate Ray Price, Cronin enjoyed a fairy tale last match end to his career in the 1986 Grand Final where he kicked both goals in the Eels' 4–2 victory over Canterbury-Bankstown.\nCronin played 216 games in ten years with Parramatta placing him equal fourth with Bob O'Reilly on the list of most first grade appearances. His club point scoring tally of 1,971 points (75 tries, 865 goals and 2 field goals) is the standing Parramatta record and is over 150 points clear of the next contender Luke Burt. He kicked 11 goals in a round 14 match of 1982 against the Illawarra Steelers, and 10 goals in the round 22 clash of 1978 against the Newtown Jets. He twice scored 27 points in a match for Parramatta.\nIn 1985 he overtook Graham Eadie's record for the most points scored in an NSWRFL career (1,917); Cronin's eventual total of 1,971 stood as the new career record for sixteen seasons until it was bettered by Daryl Halligan in 2000.\nLater representative career.\nThe 1978 Kangaroo tour was Cronin's second, and he played in all five Tests plus 12 minor matches again returning home as the tour's highest point scorer with 142 points. He played in all Tests of the 1979 domestic Ashes series against Great Britain kicking 24 goals in the course of the three games. He played in seven Tests over three series against New Zealand in 1978, 1980 and 1982 before he retired from international representative football.\nIn 22 Tests for Australia between 1973 and 1982 he scored 5 tries and 93 goals for 201 points. Aside from Cronin's first 5 Tests in 1973 and 1974 when Graeme Langlands was captain and goal kicker, Mick Cronin was Australia's first choice kicker in his next seventeen Test appearances.\nState of origin folklore.\nCronin made 21 appearances for New South Wales Blues up till 1981 under the old place of residence rules. He played in the inaugural State of Origin match in 1980 and made five further appearances for the Blues under the origin criteria up till the game III in 1983, despite having retired from international representative availability in 1982.\nMick Cronin's name was etched into Origin folklore that first night in July 1980 when, fifteen minutes from the end of the game, his Parramatta club teammate Arthur Beetson pirouetted in from the right side while Cronin was held up in a tackle by Queensland half Greg Oliphant, and threw a loose left-arm around Cronin's chin. To this day that incident is cited in evidence that, from the outset, State of Origin football was \"the real deal\" where deeply rooted State passion would take priority over club friendships and loyalties. State of Origin rugby league has ever since been promoted as \"state against state, mate against mate\". This archrivalry was typified by the Cronin/Beetson altercation; notwithstanding that it was quickly forgotten and that they sat next to each other on the return plane trip to Sydney and did not mention the incident.\nAltogether Cronin represented New South Wales 27 times from 1973 to 1983, scoring 7 tries, 87 goals for 195 points.\nPoint scoring feats.\nWhen he retired in 1986 he was the greatest point-scorer in the history of the NSWRL premiership with 1,971 points and other point-scoring honours include:\n • Country record of 316 pts in 20 Group 7 matches in 1971\n • Most points in a club season (282 in 1978) – the standing Parramatta club record.\n • Most points in a calendar year (547 from 52 games in 1978)\n • Most points by a player from any country in World Cup clashes (108)\n • Most points in the world in Tests (199)\n • Most points in a Test series (54 against Great Britain 1979)\n • Most successive successful kicks for goal in top-grade rugby league (26 in 1978).\n • Leading point-scorer in 1977, 1978, 1979, 1982 &amp; 1985\nCoaching.\nIn 1990 he took on the coaching responsibility at Parramatta in a period when their playing roster was at its weakest for years. In 1992, he coached a Country origin side to victory over City origin. He coached the Parramatta club until the end of the 1993 NSWRL season.\nIn 2009 he coached the Gerringong Lions in the Group 7 Rugby League competition until stepping down from the top job after winning a premiership in 2020. He won 5 premierships as coach with the Lions(2010,2013,2015,2016,2020)\nAccolades.\nCronin was named \"Country Player of the Year\" in 1974. He won unprecedented consecutive Rothmans Medals in 1977–78. In 1985 he was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia \"in recognition of service to the sport of Rugby League Football\". Cronin received the Australian Sports Medal in 2000 and was honoured further in 2001 by being awarded the Centenary Medal \"for service to Australian society through the sport of Rugby League\".\nAt the 2007 Dally M Awards Cronin was inducted into the Australian Rugby League Hall of Fame.\nIn February 2008, Cronin was named in the list of Australia's \"100 Greatest Players\" (1908–2007) which was commissioned by the NRL and ARL to celebrate the code's centenary year in Australia.\nThe eastern grandstand of Western Sydney Stadium is named the Mick Cronin Stand in his honour."

The tour immediately followed the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy in India, where West Indies reached the final, and they played their first tour match three days after playing the final. Pakistan's recent results included a 3–0 loss in a Test series in England, where the final match ended in farce, and they were eliminated at the group stage of the Champions Trophy. The Pakistan Cricket Board had also recently suspended fast bowlers Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammad Asif due to a doping case.\nTour matches.\nPatron's XI v West Indians.\nThe PCB Patron's XI made 305 for four declared on the first day, with Salman Butt retiring after making 106, sharing an opening stand of 175 with Yasir Hameed, who was first to fall, caught behind off Dave Mohammed for 92. On the second day, West Indies replied with 279 for five, with Dwayne Bravo replicating Butt's feat. No bowler took more than one wicket in the game.\nTest series.\n1st Test.\nWest Indies batted first, but Pakistan earned a first innings lead of 279, enough to stretch West Indies' their sequence of Tests without a win to 14, and they had now played 17 Tests away from home without a win. The visitors started with an opening stand of 41, but then four wickets fell within 26 balls, and they were 52 for four. Brian Lara made a half-century and Dwayne Bravo and Dave Mohammed chipped in with 30s, but Umar Gul (five for 65 including the last three wickets) and Shahid Nazir (three for 42) had done the damage, and they were bowled out for 206.\nPakistan's score at the fall of the second wicket was just four ahead of the West Indies'; however, Mohammad Yousuf nearly outscored the West Indies on his own. He shared century stands with Shoaib Malik and Kamran Akmal, while Jerome Taylor took four wickets in his 33 overs. Dave Mohammed bowled 31 overs, taking three for 98 including the two last batsmen, but West Indies had to make 279 just to see Pakistan bat again.\nThey did, just. Overnight on day three they were 74 for three, with two wickets taken by Umar Gul, as opener Daren Ganga fell in single figures for the second time in the match. Nightwatchman Fidel Edwards hung around for an hour in a partnership of 45 with Lara, and Lara added a further 137, but three wickets fell in the eleven overs before tea on day four, starting with Lara going lbw to part-timer Mohammad Hafeez, who bowled four overs in the game. Shivnarine Chanderpaul was caught off Shahid Nazir with the new ball, and West Indies made 291 after Mohammed's 15; Pakistan chased 13, though they did lose one wicket, opener Hafeez lbw to Corey Collymore for the latter's only wicket in the game."

        "text": "Major League Baseball (MLB) annually honors its best relief pitchers in the American League (AL) and National League (NL) with the Mariano Rivera AL Reliever of the Year Award and Trevor Hoffman NL Reliever of the Year Award, respectively. The awards are named after former relievers Mariano Rivera and Trevor Hoffman, who played their entire careers in the respective leagues. First issued in 2014, the awards replaced the Delivery Man of the Year Award, which had been presented since 2005.\nThe Reliever of the Year Awards are based on the votes of a panel of retired relievers. Each voter selects three pitchers for each league based solely on their performance in the regular season; a 5-3-1 weighted point system is used to determine the winner. At its inception in 2014, the panel consisted of the top five relievers in career saves at the time—Rivera, Hoffman, Lee Smith, John Franco, and Billy Wagner—and the four living relief pitchers who were in the Hall of Fame: Dennis Eckersley, Rollie Fingers, Goose Gossage, and Bruce Sutter.\nThe Reliever of the Year Award winners had all been closers until 2018 when Josh Hader of the Milwaukee Brewers won as a setup man; he later won the NL title in 2019 and 2021 as a closer. In 2019, both winners of the awards were also named in the inaugural All-MLB teams. In 2020, the Brewers' Devin Williams became the first rookie, and the first reliever with no saves, to win the award in either league.\nSince 2017, MLB has also issued a Reliever of the Month Award."

        "title": "Rover (ice hockey)",
        "text": "A rover was a position in ice hockey used in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. At the time ice hockey consisted of seven positions: the rover, along with the goaltender, two defencemen, and three forwards; the other positions still remain. Unlike the others, the rover did not have a set position, and roamed the ice at will, going where needed, much as a midfielder in association football might.\nAs the skill level of players increased, the need to have a rover decreased. Shortly after it was formed in 1910, the National Hockey Association decided to exclude the rover. The league's successor, the NHL, did the same in 1917. However, the Pacific Coast Hockey Association, formed in 1911, kept the rover. The Western Canada Hockey League also used a rover when it was founded in 1921.\nAs the NHA and later NHL did not have a rover, but the PCHA did, a compromise was made during Stanley Cup matches, which, at the time, was a challenge cup. Games would alternate between the NHA/NHL rules and PCHA versions, allowing each team an advantage and disadvantage during games.\nThe first Olympic ice hockey tournament in 1920 used a rover, but this position was eliminated for subsequent games.\nIn 1923, both the PCHA and the WCHL decided to drop the rover position, as it was seen to be crowding the ice and therefore reducing the speed of play. Moreover, with both leagues in financial competition with the NHL, the added expense of a seventh starter was burdensome. With the decision to remove the rover, it disappeared from professional hockey forever.\nContemporary usage.\nThe term is sometimes used to informally describe fast, rushing offensive defencemen, such as former NHL star Scott Niedermayer, as they often roam the ice creating offensive pressure instead of being simply \"blueliners\". Other players who have been described as modern \"rovers\" include Tyson Barrie, Brent Burns, Dustin Byfuglien, Erik Karlsson, Paul Coffey, Cale Makar and Roman Josi, due to their ability to either play forward and defense, or because of their strong puck handling skills. The term is also used to describe the extra attacker, who roams the ice instead of assuming one of the usual positions."

        "title": "1773 English cricket season",
        "text": "In the 1773 English cricket season, there was a downturn in the fortunes of the Hambledon Club as their Hampshire team lost every match they are known to have played, and some of their defeats were heavy. Their poor results owed much to star bowler Thomas Brett having been injured. Three other county teams were active: Kent, Middlesex and Surrey. Teams called England took part in five matches, all against Hampshire, and won all five.\nWilliam Yalden was one of the season's leading wicket-keepers and he also equalled Richard Newland's record for the highest individual innings in a senior match when he scored 88 for Surrey against Hampshire in September. Based on surviving scorecard data, the highest runscorers of the whole season were Thomas White (Surrey), Joseph Miller (Kent) and Will Palmer (Surrey). Lumpy Stevens of Surrey was the leading bowler with 18 wickets.\nSingle wicket.\nThe earliest significant event of the season was a single wicket match played on 2 June at the Artillery Ground between Five of England and Five of Hampshire for a stake of £1,000. It was billed as \"the first great match this season\". The Hampshire team was John Small, Tom Sueter, Richard Nyren, George Leer and Thomas Brett. England's five were Lumpy Stevens, John Minshull, Joseph Miller, Dick May and Will Palmer. England scored 31 &amp; 27/4 against Hampshire's 24 &amp; 33 to win by 1 wicket. Miller was 11 not out at the end and so scored the winning run(s). Leer with scores of 16 and 13 made the most runs.\nEleven-a-side.\nThe Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians (the ACS) listed twelve senior eleven-a-side matches in the 1773 English cricket season. A thirteenth match, which they had overlooked, was played on 9–10 July. The combined Hampshire and Sussex team underwritten by the Hambledon Club took part in eight matches – five against England and three against Surrey – and lost all of them. Surrey played in all the other five matches, four against Kent and one against Middlesex. Surrey defeated Kent three times and lost to them once; they also lost the Middlesex match.\nHampshire v England.\nThe first match between Hampshire and England took place at Sevenoaks Vine on 28–29 June. The England team was a strong Kent and Surrey combination. The surviving scorecard is the first since 1744 to include some bowling and fielding details, though no credit was given to the bowler when a batsman was out other than by being clean bowled, a constraint in scoring that was not rectified until well into the 19th century. In this match, Lumpy Stevens may have been the best bowler as he took five wickets bowled and possibly had more from catches. Hampshire batted first and were all out for 77. England totalled 177 in reply to establish a first innings lead of 100; Joseph Miller scored 73. In their second innings, Hampshire were dismissed for only 49 and so England won by an innings &amp; 51 runs. The scorecard includes the first known instance of hit wicket as a means of dismissal, but it is not mentioned again until 1786. The batsman in this case was John Minshull and it was another \"first\" for him as he scored cricket's earliest recorded century in 1769.\nThere was a return match at the Artillery Ground on 2–3 July. John Small scored 58 in Hampshire's first innings total of 132. England replied with 187 to take a first innings lead of 55. Hampshire then scored 154 and England made 100/4 to win by 6 wickets. Coulsdon batsman Will Palmer, who had an outstanding season in 1773, scored 52* and 30* in the two England innings.\nThe two teams met at the Artillery Ground again a week later, on 9–10 July. This match is not included in the ACS list but Martin Wilson in his \"Index to Waghorn\" explains the situation, based on H. T. Waghorn's source, that it is an extra match which had previously been overlooked. Waghorn's source reported that England won by 2 wickets but Hampshire were handicapped because Thomas Brett was injured.\nTwo days later, England and Hampshire played again, this time at Laleham Burway in Chertsey, and England won by the convincing margin of 114 runs. No scorecard has been found but there was a report in the \"Morning Post\" on 16 July which said: \"Hampshire being beat again last Tuesday on Laleham Burway they must now resign the Cricket laurel, though much against their will\". The report went on to say how the Hampshire fielders had crowded the Duke of Dorset, who was scoring well with shots to the off-side, thereby preventing him from making a full play at the ball. This practice actually contravened the 1744 \"Laws of Cricket\" which stated that \"in the case of hindrance (the umpires) may order a notch (run) to be scored\". Although Dorset could presumably have appealed to the umpires, he dealt with the matter as a batsman. He asked the fielders to stand back and they refused, so he played his shot fully and \"in so doing brought one of the gentlemen to the ground\".\nThe last match between the two was played at Broadhalfpenny Down on 4–5 August and England won by 9 wickets. Hampshire were all out for 89 and 140 with Stevens bowling seven and Dorset bowling six. In England's first innings, Thomas White scored 69 and Palmer 68 in a total of 202. England scored 28/1 in their second innings to complete their fifth win of the season over Hampshire.\nHampshire v Surrey.\nThe Hampshire v Surrey matches were played towards the end of the season, the first on 26 August at Broadhalfpenny Down. Hampshire scored 103 and 51; Surrey replied with 131 and 24/4 to win by 6 wickets. The top score in the match was 35 by Richard Francis of Surrey in the first innings. No bowling or fielding details were recorded.\nIn \"Scores &amp; Biographies\" (\"S&amp;B\"), Arthur Haygarth states that the details were obtained from the \"Hampshire Chronicle\" as the match was not included in the \"old printed book of Hambledon scores from 1772 to 1784\". \"S&amp;B\" goes on to regret the absences of John Small and Thomas Brett, the best batsman and best bowler respectively of Hampshire. He says Hampshire fielded almost a \"scratch side\" as there were four debutants Cotton, Horne, Lawrence and M. Lewis who do not appear again in recorded scores. Some or all of them may have been active before 1772. Strictly speaking, the Hampshire team in this game was Hambledon Parish. Some regular players who lived elsewhere in the county, including Small and Brett, did not play.\nThe second match was played 16–18 September at Laleham Burway and Surrey won by 8 wickets. Hampshire were dismissed for only 38 in their first innings.\n The third match was at Broadhalfpenny Down on 27–28 September and Surrey won convincingly by an innings and 60 runs. Hampshire were dismissed for 83 and 82. Both their totals were beaten by William Yalden on his own as he scored 88 in Surrey's innings of 225. Yalden's score was the highest in 1773 and it equalled the known record for the highest individual innings in a senior match; Richard Newland scored 88 playing for England against Kent in 1745.\nKent v Surrey.\nKent and Surrey played each other four times – twice at Laleham Burway, once at Bourne Paddock and once at Sevenoaks Vine. Surrey won the first three matches and Kent won at Sevenoaks. The first match was at Laleham Burway on 21–22 June and Surrey won by 35 runs after scoring 175 and 70 while dismissing Kent for 133 and 77. Thomas White made scores of 44 and 23 for Surrey. No bowling or fielding details were recorded.\nThe second match at Bishopsbourne on 19–21 July is the first in which close of play scores are included in the scorecard. The match was interrupted by rain. On the first day, a Monday, Surrey were all out for 77 and Kent were 55/5 at the close. On Tuesday, Kent added only eight more runs and were dismissed for 63. Surrey started their second innings but, with rain intervening, had made only 65/2 by the close. The match was completed on the Wednesday with Thomas White going on from 2* overnight to 60. Surrey's total was 217. Bowlers John Wood and Lumpy Stevens dismissed Kent for 78 to ensure a Surrey victory by 153 runs.\nNo scorecard has been found for the third match at Laleham Burway on 9–10 August. A report says the stakes were 500 guineas per side and Surrey won by 8 wickets. The fourth match was played 16–18 August on Sevenoaks Vine and Kent won by 6 wickets. Thomas White made another good score with 59 but was on the losing team this time.\nSurrey v Middlesex.\nSurrey met Middlesex at Kennington Common on 13 July. No scorecard has been found. The stakes were 100 guineas a side and Middlesex won by 6 runs having a match total of 179 to Surrey's 173.\nOther events.\nOn 30 July, there was a match at Bourne Paddock between the Bourne and Chatham clubs for which a grandstand was erected. It was rained off not long after it began; Bourne had scored 56/8 in their first innings. The Bourne team included Joseph Miller, Will Palmer, James Fuggles, Richard Simmons and one of the Mays, as well as the team's patron Sir Horatio Mann himself. The Chatham team included Robert Clifford and George Louch. In the report of an earlier Chatham match, Louch was \"admired for his activity in the field\". He had a reputation as one of the best fielders in England.\nAlso on 30 July, there was a match at Broadhalfpenny Down between Hambledon Town and Hampshire, which was played for 20 guineas a side. It is included in the ACS list but perhaps for historical interest only.\nOn 5 August, there was a London v England match on White Conduit Fields. The \"Middlesex Journal\" reported in its edition of Saturday, 7 August that London won \"with great ease\". It may well have been a \"gentlemen only\" game as, according to the ACS guide, the England team was \"an inferior eleven\".\nOn 16–18 August, there was a match at Tothill Fields between the Westminster and London clubs. Shock White of Brentford played for Westminster as a given man. There has been some confusion in sources between this player and Thomas White of Reigate but Shock's appearance at Tothill Fields coincides with Thomas playing for Surrey against Kent in Sevenoaks on the same dates (see above), thus confirming that they were two different people.\nThere was a return match between Chatham and Bourne on 30 August on the Chatham Lines. It ended in a draw. They played again at Bourne Paddock in September and Bourne won by 3 wickets.\nA match was scheduled at Andover on 24–25 September between Sussex and Hampshire. Sussex were due to have Lumpy Stevens and Thomas White of Surrey as given men; and also John Bayton, the noted Hambledon batsman of the 1760s, though he may have been a native of Sussex. The match was cancelled because only seven of the Sussex team turned up. Apart from the afore-mentioned three players, the Sussex team was by no means top-class. Hampshire, on the other hand, had selected Davis, Aylward, Small, Sueter, Leer, Nyren, Stewart, Brett, Purchase, Barber and Hogsflesh.\nFirst mentions.\nThe following people are mentioned in sources for the first time in the 1773 season:\nPlayers.\nBased on data in the surviving match scorecards, the highest run-scorers in 1773 were Thomas White (328), Joseph Miller (316) and Will Palmer (305). Bowlers were only credited with the wickets of those batsmen they bowled out; if the batsman was caught, only the fielder received credit. Also, the runs conceded by each bowler were not recorded. The highest wicket-takers were Lumpy Stevens (18), John Wood of Surrey (16) and the Duke of Dorset (15). The most catches, six apiece, were taken by William Yalden, Richard Simmons and John Minshull. Yalden and Simmons were wicket-keepers; Minshull was a fielder."

The revision of the Laws introduced leg before wicket as a means of dismissal and formalised the standard width of a cricket bat.\nLaws revision.\nThe Laws of Cricket were revised during a meeting held at the Star and Garter on Pall Mall, London during February. This was attended by a range of influential cricket figures who produced \"New Articles of the Game of Cricket\", essentially a revised version of the 1744 Laws.\nThe revision of the Laws formalised the standard width of a cricket bat at , a measure that had been introduced by the Hambledon Club following the Monster Bat Incident of 1771. The weight of a cricket ball was narrowed to between and , having previously been limited to between and , and the toss of a coin was removed from the game, with the visiting team instead having the choice of whether to bat or bowl first.\nThe revision introduced Leg Before Wicket (LBW) as a means of dismissal, stating that \"the striker is out if he puts his leg before the wicket with a design to stop the ball and actually prevent the ball from hitting it\". The introduction of LBW stemmed from batsmen deliberately blocking the ball using their legs rather than attempting to play it with their bat, most notably a player named Ring. While the Law was revised nine times between its introduction and 1831, it was not until 1839 that the Law was amended to state that the ball had to pitch in line with the stumps in order for the batsman to be out.\nMatches.\nFive first-class match scorecards survive from 1774.\nIn the match between Hampshire and England on 7–8 July, bowler William Bullen took the first known five wicket haul in first-class matches: note that bowlers in this era were only credited with a wicket when they bowled the batsman.\nSix other matches are known to have been played during the season, including matches between county teams.

        "title": "1787 English cricket season",
        "text": "The 1787 cricket season in England is noteworthy for the foundation of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) after the opening of Thomas Lord's first ground in the parish of Marylebone, north of London. MCC soon became the sport's governing body with the new ground as its feature venue. The first match known to have been played at Lord's was on Monday, 21 May, between the White Conduit Club and a Middlesex county team. The first match known to involve a team representing MCC was against White Conduit on Monday, 30 July. Including these two, reports and/or match scorecards have survived of numerous eleven-a-side matches played in 1787. Eleven are retrospectively, but unofficially, recognised as first-class.\nThere was one top-class six-a-side single wicket match, played at Lord's, between Kent and Hambledon. Among the season's leading players were batsmen James Aylward and John Small; fast bowler David Harris; and the all-rounders Billy Beldham, Thomas Taylor, Tom Walker and John Wells. The follow-on is first mentioned in sources, having been applied in a match at Hinckley between teams from Leicester and Coventry.\nLord's and MCC.\nOpening of the first Lord's ground.\nCricket in 1787 was mostly financed by the aristocratic members of the long-standing and multi-functional Noblemen's and Gentlemen's Club which was based at the \"Star and Garter\" on Pall Mall in London. The club's members had been largely involved with the hitherto influential Hambledon Club but, as they wanted a venue closer to London than rural Hampshire, they had recently opened the White Conduit Club on White Conduit Fields in Islington. The members soon became dissatisfied with conditions there as White Conduit Fields was common land they could not enclose. Two of White Conduit's leading lights were George Finch, 9th Earl of Winchilsea, then the president of the Hambledon Club, and Colonel Charles Lennox, the future Duke of Richmond. They were aware that Thomas Lord, one of the club's professional bowlers, was reputed to have business acumen and so they commissioned him to find and open a private venue, guaranteeing him against any expenses or losses he might incur. Lord negotiated a lease of land belonging to the Portman Estate in Marylebone. Now known as Lord's Old Ground, it was a seven-acre field which his workers levelled and enclosed with a high fence. It was situated where Dorset Square and Marylebone Station now stand.\nOn Wednesday, 25 April, the following notice appeared in the \"Morning Herald\", a London newspaper:\nThe agenda of that meeting is unknown but, less than four weeks later on Monday, 21 May, Lord's new ground staged its earliest known match when White Conduit played against a Middlesex county team. No details are known other than a pre-announcement in the \"Morning Herald\" on Saturday, 19 May:\nFoundation of the MCC.\nSometime after moving from Islington to Marylebone, the gentlemen's club reconstituted itself as the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). The exact date is unknown but a notice in \"The World\" on Friday, 27 July announced:\nThe notice is the earliest known mention of a Marylebone Club. Details of the match are unknown and no scorecard has been found. It is not actually certain that MCC was founded in 1787 because, as John Major asserts in \"More Than A Game\", there is \"no irrefutable evidence\" to support the claim. In due course, MCC took responsibility for the organisation, administration and development of the sport, including ownership of the \"Laws of Cricket\". In his history, H. S. Altham says that White Conduit became MCC in 1788, revising and reissuing the Laws in the same year. On the other hand, the pre-announcement of the match on 30 July 1787 explicitly states that the Marylebone Club would meet the Islington Club. MCC has always regarded 1787 as its foundation year and, in 1837, staged a golden jubilee match to commemorate its 50th anniversary.\nMatches played at Lord's.\nLord's is known to have hosted eight matches in 1787. One was a top-class single wicket match and seven were eleven-a-side matches, including four which are retrospectively, though unofficially, recognised as first-class. No information has been found about the matches on 21 May and 30 July so they cannot be classified and are listed as \"other matches\". Another unclassified match was played on 5–6 June, when White Conduit again played Middlesex and won by 10 wickets. No scorecard has survived, although the team totals and the players' names are known from newspaper reports.\nThe second match was on Thursday, 31 May, when Middlesex played Essex. The scorecard has survived and is the earliest of a match played at Lord's. Despite a first innings deficit of 72 runs, Middlesex won the match by 93 runs. They batted first and were all out for 58. Essex scored 130 (Richard Newman 51). Middlesex made 203 in their second innings. Essex needed 132 to win but they were all out for just 38. Butcher, whose first name is unknown, was a Surrey bowler playing for Essex in this match as a given man. He took ten wickets, all bowled, five in each innings. The scorecard details include \"P O Clark\" for the dismissals of Middlesex batsmen Z. Boult and William Bedster. This is believed to mean \"put out\", a term for stumped by the wicket-keeper, who was Thomas Clark. Given the quality of the teams, the match is retrospectively recognised as the inaugural first-class match played at Lord's. Of the 22 players, nine are listed as first-class debutants and Thomas Lord himself made his first recorded appearance, playing as a bowler for Middlesex. In \"Scores and Biographies\", Arthur Haygarth remarks: \"This is the first recorded match played on the original Lord's Ground, which was on the site of Dorset Square\". Haygarth did not know of the match on 21 May, the pre-announcement of which was found by G. B. Buckley in the 1930s.\nThere was a third White Conduit v Middlesex match on 14–15 June. The scorecard has survived and it is rated first-class. White Conduit batted first and were all out for 80, of which Butcher scored 30. Middlesex scored 126 to take a first innings lead of 46. Play ended early due to poor light after White Conduit had reached 21 for 3. Next morning, they were all out for 88 (Richard Wyatt 26) and Middlesex scored 45 for 2 (George Louch 16 not out) to win by 8 wickets. John Boorman was credited with six wickets in the match (bowled dismissals only) and the newspaper report says that his bowling \"won the game\". The same report says White Conduit missed their best bowler, Charles Cumberland, who was sidelined with an ankle injury.\nOn 20–22 June, White Conduit met an England XI in a first-class match. England scored 247 (James Aylward 93) and 197 (Billy Beldham 63); White Conduit scored 112 and 67 to be convincingly beaten by 239 runs. Aylward was run out for 93, which was the season's highest individual score. Beldham and John Wells are listed as first-class debutants.\nOn 2–4 August, Lord's hosted a top-class single wicket match between six-a-side teams representing Kent and the Hambledon Club. Batting first, Kent scored 53 all out (Joey Ring 24). Hambledon replied with 27 and then bowled Kent out for just 13. Needing 40 to win, Hambledon in turn were dismissed for 16 and so Kent won by 23 runs. David Harris took eleven of the twelve Kent wickets.\nTowards the end of the season, on 10–12 September, there was a first-class match between teams selected by the Earl of Winchilsea and Sir Horatio Mann. Mann's XI opened with 116 (Harry Walker 44) and then dismissed Winchilsea's XI for 84 (Thomas Taylor 23 not out; Lumpy Stevens 3w). In their second innings, Mann's XI scored 123 (Tom Walker 40; David Harris 3w). Winchilsea's XI needed 156 to win but were all out for 61 (Francis Booker 22; Lumpy Stevens 3w) and so Mann's XI won by 94 runs.\nFirst-class matches.\nOf the many eleven-a-side matches known to have been played in 1787, eleven are retrospectively, though unofficially, recognised as first-class. Four, described above, were played at Lord's and the other seven at venues across the south of England.\nHampshire played Kent three times in inter-county matches at Coxheath on 7–10 August, Bourne Paddock on 14–16 August, and Windmill Down on 3–5 September. In all three, the away team won. Hampshire won by 2 wickets at Coxheath and by 266 runs at Bishopsbourne. At Windmill Down, however, Kent won by 65 runs. Haygarth says the Hampshire team at Coxheath is called England in another account but the players were all members of the Hambledon Club and so it was in reality a Hampshire XI. In the match at Windmill Down, there were seven run outs of Hampshire batsmen.\nIn two matches, the Hornchurch club played against a combined team representing White Conduit and Moulsey Hurst. The first, on 15–16 May, was probably played at Langton Park, Hornchurch, but that is not certain. Of the 22 players, twelve are listed as first-class debutants. The combined team won by 6 wickets. The return match was played at Moulsey Hurst on 3–4 July and ended in another victory for the combined team, this time by 131 runs.\nIn addition to the match at Lord's in September, the Earl of Winchilsea's XI took part in two other matches. The first was against Assheton Smith's XI at Perriam Down, near Ludgershall, Wiltshire, on 16 July; the second was against Sir Horatio Mann's XI at Bishopsbourne on 28–31 August (the Lord's match was the return to this). Winchilsea's XI won by 79 runs against Assheton Smith's XI. They won by 29 runs against Mann's XI. All-rounder William Fennex, playing for Mann's XI at Bishopsbourne, dismissed ten batsmen in the match by means of six catches and four bowled; he took five catches in the second innings alone.\nOther matches.\nReports have survived of several other matches which, largely due to lack of information, are not recognised as first-class. They include White Conduit v Middlesex (21 May); White Conduit v Middlesex (5–6 June); and MCC v White Conduit (30 July) – these were all played at Lord's and are described above.\nEssex (called Hornchurch in some sources) played Middlesex at Langton Park on 5 July. The team totals are known but none of the players. Essex scored 65 and 108; Middlesex replied with 124 and 50–1 to win by 9 wickets. On the same day, a West Sussex team met one from East Sussex at Amberley Hill, near Amberley, West Sussex. West Sussex won by 101 runs. The match, of a minor standard, was restricted to amateur players resident in the county with the west–east divide centred on Arundel.\nIn Hampshire, the Alresford and Odiham clubs played each other home and away, both matches being won by Alresford. There was a match at Swanscombe, near Dartford, on 16 July between teams called Kent and Essex, but all that is known is the result – Essex won by innings and 44 runs. Another match involving an Essex team was played at Langton Park on 2–3 August against White Conduit who won by \"over 100 runs\".\nFurther north, a team from Leicester played two matches. The first, against a Coventry team was on 6–7 August at a venue in Hinckley. Leicester won by 45 runs and the match was the subject of an extensive report in a local newspaper. In September, Leicester were away to a Melton Mowbray team and were defeated by an innings and 16 runs.\nPlayers.\nMovement of the sport's centre of activity from the rural counties to north London led to an unusually high number of players being listed as first-class debutants in 1787, though many could have been playing earlier without being recorded. For example, the two matches in May included a total of 21 players who are listed as debutants, among them Billy Beldham, Thomas Lord and John Wells.\n18th century scorecards generally lack details and so it is difficult to complete analysis of playing performances. While several scorecards from 1787 have survived, the data they provide is by no means a complete record. One of the difficulties is that a bowler was only credited with a wicket if he bowled the batsman out; he was not credited with the wickets of batsmen who were caught out. The most runs recorded over the season were by James Aylward (296), John Small (295), Billy Beldham (286), Tom Walker (270) and John Wells (179). Aylward made the highest known score in a single innings with 93.\nThe leading bowlers by wickets credited were David Harris (29), Butcher of Surrey (24), John Boorman (22), Lumpy Stevens (22) and Thomas Taylor (17). Harry Walker and Thomas Taylor took the most known catches with 11 each.\nThe follow-on.\nThe first mention of the follow-on occurs in 1787.\nIn the Leicester v Coventry match at Hinckley in August, Coventry batted first and were all out for 23. Leicester were all out for 13 in reply, and were obliged to bat again next. In their second innings, Leicester made 132; Coventry, needing 123 to win, were all out for 77, meaning Leicester won by 45 runs after having to follow-on.\nAccording to Rowland Bowen, it was the unofficial custom in some parts of the country for the team behind on first innings to bat next, regardless of the size of the deficit."

Dorset was reportedly planning a goodwill visit to France by an England team, but the crisis forced him to return home and the venture was cancelled before the team could leave England.\nMatches.\nA total of 14 first-class matches were played during the season and involved teams from each of Essex, Hampshire, Kent, Middlesex and Surrey.

There were two matches between teams from West Kent and East Kent and a team from Hornchurch Cricket Club hosted MCC in August. A match between teams named A to M and N to Z was played at Lord's Old Ground.\nProposed visit to Paris by an England team.\nThe British ambassador to France, the Duke of Dorset, a leading patron of cricket, planned the formation of an England team to visit Paris on a goodwill tour and play matches there in August. The team, captained by William Yalden, reportedly assembled in London and travelled to Dover on 10 August where, unexpectedly, they met the Duke himself coming the other way. He was returning to England following the escalation of the French Revolution and the venture was cancelled. According to John Major in \"More Than A Game\", \"the whole story is nonsense\". On 16 July, two days after the Storming of the Bastille, Dorset had written to Foreign Secretary Francis Osborne, 5th Duke of Leeds, about the crisis and had warned other British residents to leave Paris so, Major contends, he would hardly have invited a cricket team to come to France at such a time.\nDorset is known to have left Paris on 8 August. He did not return and was temporarily replaced by his Embassy Secretary, Lord Robert Stephen FitzGerald, as Minister Plenipotentiary. New credentials were delivered by his official successor, Earl Gower, on 20 June 1790. Dorset's credentials were terminated on 29 June 1790. If the venture had gone ahead, it would have been the first-ever international cricket tour but, instead, it became the first to be cancelled for political reasons."

        "title": "Andrew Sullivan (basketball)",
        "text": "Andrew Derek \"Drew\" Sullivan (born 12 February 1980) is a British retired basketball player. In his career, he played for several clubs in Europe and was the captain of the Great Britain national team. He was a two-time MVP of the British Basketball League.\nHigh school career.\nThe only child of Eunice Sullivan, Andrew moved from his London home to the United States in 1996 where he attended St. Augustine Preparatory School, in Richland, New Jersey. In his prep career, he scored 1,368 points, averaging 19.8 PPG as a senior. Coached by Paul Rodio his team had a 24–6 record and he was named in the first team all-state as well as being voted as South Jersey Player of the Year 1999.\nCollege career.\nIn 1999, Andrew enrolled in the School of Arts &amp; Sciences at Villanova University, home of the Wildcats basketball team, from which he graduated in 2003. The athlete was Villanova's most versatile defender and could guard four positions.\nSullivan took to his first season with the Wildcats in 1999–2000, on his debut playing with three rebounds and tough defense in seven minutes against Lafayette, and later the freshman converted his first career points with a 3-point shot from the top of the key in the first half against Fairleigh Dickinson. He tied a career-high with seven points in 12 minutes in a 67–66 loss to Miami on 17 January 2000 and three days later grabbed five rebounds and scored five points in a 66–57 win at Providence. Overall, it was a successful rookie season for the Englishman, in which another highlight unfolded when he made several plays in an 86–69 win over Notre Dame, ending the night with seven points and five rebounds in 14 minutes of activity. By the end of the season, Sullivan had played 29 games, averaging 2.31 PPG.\nHis second season saw his minutes fluctuate throughout the campaign, playing just 20 games and averaging a mere 1.65 PPG, although he did earn a career-high 26 minutes, playing with energy and strong defense in an 87–75 win over Towson University on 26 November 2000 he contributed four points and five rebounds. Returning from injury, Andrew also scored another four points in 23 minutes of activity in a 74–60 win over Connecticut on 10 February 2001.\nThe following season would prove to be much more successful than the previous when he established himself as Villanova's best perimeter defensive player in 2001–02.He was the only Wildcat to start all 32 contests and connected on .529 of his field goal attempts, chalking up a 5.65 PPG average, or a combined total of 181 points throughout the season.\nSullivan started the season well, when he contributed six points and six rebounds in a 59–57 win over Dayton on 24 November 2001. His key steal on Dayton's last offensive possession gave the Wildcats a chance to win on a final trip down the floor and his 28 minutes established a new career high as did his point total. Three days later Andrew better his minutes record, logging a career-high 39 minutes in a 61–58 overtime loss against La Salle University.\nLater that season Andrew came within a whisker of his first career double-double, with nine points and nine rebounds in a 71–59 loss at University of Pittsburgh on 2 February 2002 and a week later helped hold Jason Kapono to nine points on 3-of-9 shooting in 58–57 Villanova victory over UCLA. Sullivan's season finished in a 72–70 loss to Connecticut in Big East tournament on 7 March 2002 where he produced nine rebounds and four points.\nProfessional career.\nAfter leaving Villanova in 2003, Sullivan travelled to the Netherlands to sign a professional contract with leading Dutch club EiffelTowers from the city of Nijmegen. After just one season in the Netherlands, Andrew returned to his homeland and immediately signed for leading British Basketball League team the Newcastle Eagles in 2004. Despite being pipped to the league title by just two points, \"Sulli's\" season was incredibly successful. Not only did he help his team win the Championship Play-offs in a 78–75 win over the Chester Jets, but he was also the game high scorer with 27 points and was named as the MVP of the Championship.\nFollowing an incredible debut season in England, the future was looking bright for the British talent, and despite receiving several offers to play on the European continent, Andrew opted to stay with the Eagles for another season, resigning for 2005–06, and it paid handsomely.\nThe Newcastle Eagles dominated the regular season, and conquered every tournament they participated in. First claiming the BBL Trophy with a 71–51 win over the Leicester Riders, Sullivan himself contributing with a game high 18 points, as well as 11 rebounds, 4 assists and 3 steals, which earned him the MVP award. The Eagles doubled their success with an 83–69 victory in the final of the BBL Cup against London Towers, with another 18 points, and also 2 blocked shots coming from the power forward.\nAfter capturing the League title, Newcastle then went on to win the Championship Play-offs to complete the \"clean sweep\" of trophies. Sullivan scored 19 points in the final, an 83–68 win against the Scottish Rocks at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena. To complete his victorious season, Andrew was also named as the BBL Player of the Year 2006.\nWith every title won in just two years in England, seemingly Sullivan's work there was done and a fresh challenge was sought after. Europe came calling again and this time, he jumped at the chance of playing with European basketball's elite in the Euroleague. In the summer of 2006, he signed for Spanish ACB club Joventut Badalona, where he joined fellow Brits Robert Archibald and Andy Betts.\nAfter a season struggling with minutes and court time in Spain, and following the departure of his British teammates, Sullivan moved to Belgium to sign for Dexia Mons-Hainaut, who is coached by Great Britain coach Chris Finch.\nIn September 2008 it was announced that Sullivan would once again represent the Newcastle Eagles after signing a two-month contract with the Eagles while waiting for the right offer from a European outfit. He quickly moved on to CSK VVS Samara of the Russian basketball league where he also played in the EuroChallenge.\nIn November 2009 Sullivan played for Pizza Express Primetel Apollon in the first division of Cyprus.\nIn January 2010 Sullivan moved back to the Newcastle Eagles and has helped win the BBL Cup and the League Title. In summer 2010 he signed for Mersey Tigers.\nIn October 2011 Sullivan quit Mersey Tigers following a dispute regarding pay. A week later, he signed with Leicester Riders on a week-to-week contract. and then on 1 December 2011 he signed to the riders for the rest of the season. Sullivan remained at Riders for three successful years and was part of the 2013 treble winning team, claiming the BBL Championship regular season and Play-off crown's as well as winning the BBL Cup.\nIn August 2014, after weeks of speculation, Sullivan was signed by his hometown team London Lions for the 2014–15 season. At the official unveiling, Sullivan claimed it was his intention to see out the remainder of his career at the Lions, although he subsequently returned to the Leicester Riders for the following season.\nInternational career.\nEngland.\nSullivan's successes have not just been restricted to his club teams, but continued with the England national team competing at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne. An 80–58 victory against Nigeria in the third place game, in which Sullivan did not play, awarded England the bronze medal and the team returned home triumphant. In the four games that he did feature, Sullivan averaged 31 minutes-per-game, 5 rebounds-per-game and 18.25 points-per-game, with his tournament high coming against South Africa where he scored 23 points in a 95–53 win.\nGreat Britain.\nMore recently, Andrew has featured in the newly founded Great Britain national team who competed in Eurobasket 2009 and whose aim is to push for a medal at the London 2012 Olympic games. One of only two players, along with Nate Reinking, to remain from the inception of the Great Britain programme in 2006, Andrew has been the GB team's captain in recent years. He starred in GB's successful promotion campaign out of Division B in 2006-7 when he averaged 10.6 ppg. However, he has been a stalwart presence ever since and enters 2012 as the country's second most capped player (behind Reinking)."

Roberts (May 18, 1936 – October 10, 2022) was an American professional basketball player who played three seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and one season in the American Basketball Association (ABA). He played for the Syracuse Nationals and Kentucky Colonels from 1960 to 1968, having earlier played for Ohio State University's 1960 NCAA champions. After retiring from playing, he served as assistant coach of the Golden State Warriors and Los Angeles Clippers.\nEarly life.\nRoberts was born in Columbus, Ohio, on May 18, 1936. He attended East High School in his hometown. He then studied biological studies and physical education at Ohio State University, where he played for the Ohio State Buckeyes from 1957 to 1960. He was a senior co-captain of the 1960 team – which included Jerry Lucas, John Havlicek, Mel Nowell, Bob Knight, and Gary Gearhart – that lost only three games en route to the 1960 NCAA title. Roberts was selected in the third round of the 1960 NBA draft by the Syracuse Nationals.\nPlaying career.\nRoberts made his NBA debut on October 22, 1960, scoring six points to go along with three rebounds against the Philadelphia Warriors. He led the league in games played (80) the following year. He ultimately played three seasons with the Nationals, during which time there was an unspoken rule that restricted teams to three African American players. The franchise qualified for the NBA playoffs in each of those years, but lost to the Boston Celtics, Warriors, and Cincinnati Royals, respectively.\nRoberts returned to his hometown of Columbus, Ohio for the 1966–67 season as the player/manager for the Columbus Comets of the newly formed and short-lived North American Basketball League (NABL). There, he played with former East High and Ohio State teammate Mel Nowell as well as former Ohio State alumni Dick Reasbeck, Gary Bradds, and Jim Doughty. Roberts did return to play for the Kentucky Colonels of the ABA for one season in 1967, the ABA's first year.\nCoaching career.\nAfter his playing career ended, Roberts became an assistant coach for Western Michigan in the Mid-American Conference, then Iowa in the Big Ten, before being an assistant for the NBA's Golden State Warriors and coach Al Attles for five years. The Warriors, led by MVP Rick Barry, won the NBA championship in 1975. Roberts coached the Warriors to their fourth win in the NBA finals against the Washington Bullets after Attles was ejected from the game.\nPersonal life and death.\nRoberts was married to Celia for 65 years until his death. Together, they had three children.\nRoberts died on the morning of October 10, 2022, at his home in Oakland, California. He was 86, and suffered from cancer prior to his death.\nCareer statistics.\nNBA/ABA.\nSource"

        "title": "1994 WDC World Darts Championship",
        "text": "The 1994 Skol World Darts Championship was held following 18 months of controversy within the sport of darts. After the 1993 Embassy World Championships, several players decided it was time to part company with the British Darts Organisation (who had always organised the World Championship) and form their own organisation. The new organisation was known as the World Darts Council (WDC). The WDC would later become the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC).\nThe WDC decided to introduce their own separate World Championship, with the inaugural tournament being staged before the BDO version. The 1994 Championship started on 28 December 1993, and finished on 2 January 1994. This started a tradition for the WDC/PDC World Championship to kick off before the new calendar year begins. The tournament was staged at the Circus Tavern, Purfleet, Essex.\nDennis Priestley became the first WDC World Darts Champion, winning the final 6–1 against Phil Taylor to add to his 6–0 whitewash victory over Eric Bristow in the 1991 World Championship. 1994 was the last time that Phil Taylor would fail to win the World Championship until 2003.\nThe 16 defectors.\nOriginally 16 players \"defected\" from the BDO to form the WDC/PDC – Phil Taylor, Dennis Priestley, Rod Harrington, Alan Warriner, Peter Evison, Richie Gardner, Jocky Wilson, Eric Bristow, Keith Deller, John Lowe, Bob Anderson, Cliff Lazarenko, Kevin Spiolek, Jamie Harvey, Mike Gregory and Chris Johns.\nHowever, Johns and Gregory returned to the BDO without ever competing at the PDC World Championship. They were replaced with Graeme Stoddart and Kevin Burrows and the field was brought up to 24 by adding eight players who are Larry Butler, Sean Downs, Gerald Verrier, Jerry Umberger, Jim Watkins, Dave Kelly and Steve Brown from North America and Tom Kirby of Ireland.\nTournament and format.\nThere were 24 players involved and the tournament featured an unusual round-robin format. The players were put into groups of three where the order of play was thus: \nThis was done so that there would usually always be something to play for in the last group game.\nThe group winner would progress to the quarter-finals (best of seven sets) and the tournament then became a straight knock-out event. The semi-finals were the best of 9 sets and the final was best of 11 sets.\nPrize money.\nThe prize money for the tournament was £64,000 – significantly less than the 1994 BDO World Championship which featured a £136,100 prize fund.\nTournament review.\nGroup stage.\nThe majority of the major players came through the group stage without trouble. Phil Taylor eased past Jamie Harvey 3–1, and Jim Watkins 3–0 to win Group 1, while 1988 World Champion, Bob Anderson, cruised into the quarter-finals for a showdown against Taylor, after a series of 3–0 wins against Americans Gerald Verrier and Dave Kelly. But there was room for an American to upset the odds, as Steve Brown, surprisingly, took Group 3, with wins against 1983 champion Keith Deller and Kevin Spiolek. Alan Warriner would go through to meet him after a couple of 3–1 wins against Richie Gardner and Cliff Lazarenko. Peter Evison showed no signs of discomfort, with consecutive 3–0 wins over Jerry Umberger and Kevin Burrows, and two 90-plus averages to go with it; the second of which, 97.56, would be the highest three-dart average in the tournament. Rod Harrington also went through after winning group 6, though not without difficulty. After a 3–1 win over five time World Champion, Eric Bristow, he narrowly defeated Sean Downs by 3 sets to 2 to go through to the last 8. Group 7 would see three-time champion John Lowe bow out, who narrowed missed out in a tight group, which saw Tom Kirby from Ireland book a quarter-final place, despite suffering defeat in his opening match to Lowe. A 3–1 win over American Larry Butler, and Lowe's 3–2 loss to Butler, ensured the Irishmen's advancement. He would be up against Dennis Priestley, after the Yorkshireman saw off Jocky Wilson 3–2 and Graeme Stoddart 3–0 to book a quarter-final place.\nQuarter-finals.\nIn a battle of two former world champions, Phil Taylor defeated Bob Anderson 4–2. Steve Brown upset the odds again to defeat 1993 runner-up Alan Warriner 4–3 and book a meeting with Taylor in the semi-finals. Peter Evison continued his good form, recording another 90-plus three-dart average while beating Rod Harrington 4–1, while Dennis Priestley ended the run of Tom Kirby with a 4–2 win.\nSemi-finals and third-place play-off.\nBrown's dream run finally ended in the semi-finals, as Taylor beat him 5–0 to reach his third world final. The scoreline seemed harsh on Brown, however, as both players finished with the same three-dart average (91.20). In the other semi-final, Priestley beat Evison 5–3, thus reaching his second world final. Brown capped off his impressive run in fine style, beating Evison 5–1 in the third-place play-off.\nFinal.\nThe final turned out to be a one-sided affair, with Taylor rarely giving Priestley any trouble at all. Priestley raced into a 5–0 lead, and eventually won 6–1 to take his second world title.\nResults.\nGroup stage.\nGroup A.\n26 December\n27 December\n28 December\nGroup B.\n26 December\n27 December\n28 December\nGroup C.\n26 December\n27 December\n28 December\nGroup D.\n26 December\n27 December\n28 December\nGroup E.\n26 December\n27 December\n28 December\nGroup F.\n26 December\n27 December\n28 December\nGroup G.\n26 December\n27 December\n28 December\nGroup H.\n26 December\n27 December\n28 December"

        "title": "Game of the Century (college basketball)",
        "text": "In men's college basketball, the Game of the Century was a historic National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) game between the Houston Cougars and the UCLA Bruins played on January 20, 1968, at the Astrodome in Houston, Texas. It was the first NCAA regular season game broadcast nationwide in prime time. It established college basketball as a sports commodity on television and paved the way for the modern \"March Madness\" television coverage.\nHistory.\nThe UCLA Bruins were the dominant NCAA men's basketball program of the era, having won Division I championships in 1964, 1965, and 1967. Lew Alcindor of UCLA was a talented player who was credited with reviving interest in college basketball, with Bruin games selling out arenas. Houston Cougars coach Guy Lewis wanted to prove his program's worth to his critics, so he decided to schedule UCLA. Houston and UCLA had met in the previous season in the semifinals of the 1967 NCAA Tournament. UCLA had beaten Houston 73–58 and won their 3rd NCAA championship.\nThe game.\nTed Nance, the sports information director for the University of Houston, put the schedule together. UCLA sports information director J. D. Morgan talked Bruin head coach John Wooden into the game by explaining how great it would be for college basketball. Nance put advertisements in the Cougar football programs touting the game as the \"Game of the Century.\"\nThe game was televised nationally via a syndication package through the TVS Television Network, with Dick Enberg announcing and Bob Pettit providing color commentary. Morgan had insisted to TVS owner Eddie Einhorn that TVS use Enberg, the Bruins' play-by-play announcer. Einhorn paid $27,000 for the broadcast rights on TVS. TVS signed up 120 stations, many of which would preempt regularly scheduled network programming. The basketball floor actually came from the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena.\nThe Bruins arrived in Houston with a 47-game, two-and-a-half-season winning streak. The Cougars were also undefeated since the last meeting between the two teams.\nThe first half between the AP Poll's No. 1 UCLA and No. 2 Houston closed with the Cougars up by three points. The second half saw the tension between the squads highlighted within the matchup of Houston's Elvin Hayes and UCLA's Lew Alcindor (now known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar). Hayes, a 6-foot-9 forward, was not directly matched against the 7-foot-2 Alcindor, but he did block three of Alcindor's shots, and the crowd roared his nickname, \"Big E.\"\nWith two minutes remaining in the game, the score was tied at 69 after the Bruins' Lucius Allen made a pair of free throws. Hayes took a shot and was fouled by Bruins reserve Jim Nielsen. Hayes, playing with four fouls in the second half, scored two free throws. The Bruins still had time to score, but an attempted basket by Allen would not drop. On the last possession, UCLA's All-American guard Mike Warren committed a rare mental error deflecting out of bounds a pass meant for UCLA's star shooter Lynn Shackelford, who was unguarded in the corner.\nIn the end, the Cougars pulled the upset, 71–69, ending the Bruins' 47-game winning streak.\nAftermath.\nUp to that point, only NCAA post-season games had been broadcast nationally, so there was much skepticism regarding where the broadcast would take the non-profit organization's policy. The broadcast drew a vast television audience in addition to the 52,693 fans who had filled the Astrodome for its first basketball game. Each school received $125,000 for the game, four times the 1968 NCAA tournament payout of $31,781.\nThe January 1968 cover of \"Sports Illustrated\" depicted the game, with Hayes shooting over Alcindor. Alcindor—who had sustained an eye injury at a game against Cal a week earlier—had the worst performance of his college career. It was one of only two times in his UCLA career that he shot less than 50% from the field.\nThree days after the game, UCLA starting forward Edgar Lacy quit the team. Wooden had benched him after 11 minutes, and he never re-entered the game. Upset with Wooden's public comments implying that he did not want back into the game, Lacy quit the team. \"I've never enjoyed playing for that man,\" Lacy said of Wooden after quitting. In 2008, Wooden stated, \"I'm sorry I said that. It hurt him, and that's why he quit. I was very disappointed. Edgar was a fine boy.\"\nNeither Houston nor UCLA lost another game for the remainder of the regular season. The teams met again in the 1968 NCAA Tournament semifinals, with the then-No. 2 ranked Bruins winning 101–69 against the No. 1 Cougars. Assistant coach Jerry Norman was credited by Wooden for devising the diamond-and-one defense that the Bruins used to contain Hayes, who was averaging 37.7 points per game but was held to only 10. UCLA advanced and defeated the North Carolina Tar Heels 78–55 for the 1968 title. Houston also lost the consolation game to Ohio State. Those games were at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, on the same floor used in the Astrodome game.\nThe 1971 NCAA Tournament was held at the Astrodome following the success of the game and drew more than 31,000 spectators for both the semifinals and championship. The 1982 tournament was held at the Louisiana Superdome. Eventually, most Final Fours were awarded only to host cities with domed stadiums. Starting with the 1997 tournament, only domed stadiums have hosted the Final Four.\nUCLA and Houston played again in 1969 at Pauley Pavilion for the regular-season rematch. UCLA won 100–64. UCLA won six more national championships under Wooden. Lewis led his Phi Slama Jama teams to three consecutive Final Fours (1982–1984), advancing to the national championship game in 1983 and 1984.\nIn 2006, Hayes, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (Lew Alcindor) and Wooden were inducted into the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame, followed by Lewis in 2007.\nSignificance.\nPreviously, only NCAA post-season games were broadcast on national television. The \"Game of the Century\" proved that a national audience would watch college basketball games during the regular season. Furthermore, it was telecast not by a Big Three Network but rather by the independent TVS Television Network. In 1969, NBC became the first major network to broadcast the championship game, at a cost of more than $500,000. In 2008, the NCAA deal with CBS to televise the entire tournament was worth $545 million."

        "title": "Maurice Lindsay (rugby league)",
        "text": "Maurice Lindsay (8 May 1941 – 17 May 2022) was the chairman of Preston North End F.C. and of Wigan Warriors R.L.F.C. and had two stints at the club after being one of the 'Gang of Four' directors that used to run the club when it dominated the league in the 1980s.\nCareer.\nLindsay was the owner of a contractors plant hire company as well as a bookmaker when he came to Wigan in 1980 to join Jack Robinson, Tom Rathbone &amp; Jack Hilton. This led to an upsurge in the fortunes of the club. Wigan became one of the first teams to turn professional in the league and dominated the scene winning an eight League Championships, between 1987 and 1996, as well as nine Challenge Cup wins including a record eight consecutive wins between 1988 and 1995 as well as five Lancashire County Cups and three World Club Championships.\nLindsay was directly responsible for some of the recruitment in that time frame, bringing players to the club who later went on to become legends such as Dean Bell, Andrew Farrell, Andy Goodway, Andy Platt, Brett Kenny, Denis Betts, Ellery Hanley, Frano Botica, Joe Lydon, Jason Robinson, Martin Offiah and Mick Cassidy.\nDuring his time at the club, Lindsay became team manager of the Great Britain RL team. He was manager when the team toured New Zealand in 1990 and Australia in 1992. He was also elected as President of the Rugby Football League in 1992.\nLindsay left the club for a while and became the Chief Executive of the RFL in 1992, proposing the Super League which eventually replaced the First Division Championship as the sport's elite league competition in the UK from 1996 onwards. In 1996, he also became Chairman of the Rugby League International Board which at the time, was at odds with the Australian Rugby League. Lindsay left the RFL to become the Chief Executive of the newly formed Super League (Europe) Ltd. in February 2008. This followed an acrimonious period and in-fighting within the league divisions including an attempt to unseat the Chairman of the RFL, Sir Rodney Walker. Relations between Lindsay and Sir Rodney had deteriorated but the leading clubs wanted Lindsay to assume control of the newly formed Super League. Lindsay immediately secured a new lucrative TV contract exclusively for Super League. He remained at Super League until he voluntarily retired at the end of 1999.\nLindsay re-joined the club when they moved from Central Park to move to the home of Wigan Athletic, the JJB Stadium, after Dave Whelan saved them from liquidation. The club's dominance had come under threat now that the league had gone fully professional and the introduction of the salary cap and 20/20 ruling (now 20/25) which meant the club at the time had only won two Super League titles since 1996.\nWith the return of Maurice Lindsay the club won one Challenge Cup, under the stewardship of Stuart Raper in 2002, reaching the finals of the Super League in 2000, 2001 and 2003, losing on each occasion.\nThis was seen as unacceptable by the Wigan board, and Lindsay in particular who had in total seven coaches at the club after his return with Andy Goodway, Frank Endacott, Stuart Raper, Denis Betts &amp; Ian Millward all losing their jobs due to poor performances. (Mike Gregory was given leave due to an illness from which he later died).\nThe club had a stark fall in its league position, with 2005 seeing the club fail to reach the top six for the first time in Super League and the 2006 season seeing the club rooted to the bottom of the league for most of the season before the sacking of Ian Millward and the acquisition of Brian Noble from Bradford.\nDue to increasing pressure on Lindsay to step down, he resigned, releasing a statement on 30 July 2007 which cited a disappointment of missing out on reaching the new Wembley for the Challenge Cup and ill health as the reasons for stepping down. It was also said that Dave Whelan, the club's owner persuaded Lindsay to remain until the end of the season but may be looking to sell the club himself.\nDuring the weekend of the 2007 Challenge Cup final, Lindsay was taken to hospital after the club's doctor told him he needed urgent medical attention due to a perforated gall bladder which needed operating on. Lindsay was ordered by his doctor not to attend his final ever match at the JJB Stadium as chairman of Wigan, a match which saw Wigan defeat their closest rivals St. Helens 20-12 in order to grab the last available place in the 2007 engage Super League play-offs. \nNew owner &amp; chairman Ian Lenagan took official control on 1 December 2007.\nWhen Lindsay returned for his second stint at Wigan in 2000, he was subsequently put on to the Wigan Athletic F.C. board by Dave Whelan. This did not sit well with the Wigan Athletic fans who remembered his attitude, and several comments he had made during the 1980s belittling the club. They also saw him as obstructive during a time of financial trouble when he could easily have helped. \nThe Latics fans reasoned his sudden warming to the club was due to the fact they were now an established premier league team. Whelan placed 2 Wigan Athletic directors on the Wigan R.L.F.C. board.\nMaurice remained on the Wigan Athletic board and represented the shareholders committee of the FA Premier League. In 2008 the FA Premier League elected Lindsay onto the FA Council.\nIn February 2009, Lindsay became Chairman of Racecourse Data Technologies Ltd (RDT), where he remained. RDT have contracts to supply and support computerised betting systems to every racecourse in the UK and Ireland. The company holds contracts with Satellite Information Services Ltd (SiS) and Turf TV to supply data. RDT have subsequently secured an important contract with the British Horseracing Authority to act as contractors in support of their race day computer operations.\nIt was announced on 21 June 2010 that Lindsay replaced Derek Shaw as chairman of Preston North End F.C.\nLindsay resigned as Chairman of Preston North End in December 2011 after battling septicaemia following knee surgery.\nHe died on 17 May 2022."

It is governed by the Handball Federation of Russia and takes part in international handball competitions.\nThey are as of October 2021, together with its predecessor the USSR team, the only handball teams on the women's and men's side in the world, to have won the World Championship three consecutive times. Overall, the team won three medals at the Olympics, with a gold on 2016, five medals at the World Championships, with four of them gold, and four medals at the European Championships, with two silvers in 2006 and 2018.\nIn reaction to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the International Handball Federation banned Russian and Belarusian athletes and officials, and the European Handball Federation suspended the national teams of Russia and Belarus, as well as Russian and Belarusian clubs competing in European handball competitions. Referees, officials, and commission members from Russia and Belarus will not be called upon for future activities, and new organisers will be sought for the YAC 16 EHF Beach Handball EURO and the Qualifier Tournaments for the Beach Handball EURO 2023, which were to be held in Moscow.\nHistory.\n1993–1999: Instability.\nThe Russian women's national handball team was formed in 1993, succeeding the Soviet Union women's national handball team, one of the strongest teams in the world. Notwithstanding the third place at the 1992 Summer Olympics as the Unified Team, Russia could not qualify for the Olympic Games in the following eight years.\nIn this period the Russian team saw four changes of coaches, who retired after failing on large events. The only striking performance was at the 1997 World Women's Handball Championship, where Russia under Igor Eskov, coach of the Rostov club Istochnik, became 4th, and two Russian handball players, Natalya Malakhova and Natalya Deryugina, were included into the All-Star team. However, already in the next year at the 1998 European Women's Handball Championship in the Netherlands, Russia became only 9th, and at the 1999 World Women's Handball Championship, under Kuban's Alexander Tarasikov and head coach of the Unified Team at the 1992 Olympics, just 12th.\n1999–2009: Breakthrough.\nIn late 1999, Tarasikov was replaced by Evgeny Trefilov, the club coach of Lada. He introduced younger players to the national team and concentrated more on national club players. At the 2000 European Championship, Russia became bronze medalists.\nAt the 2001 World Championship, Trefilov returned two veterans, Raisa Verakso, which was her sixth participation at Worlds, and the 1990 World champion, goalkeeper Svetlana Bogdanova. Russia won all nine matches, and in the final defeated Norway.\nAgainst the backgrounds of those victories, Team Russia became 4th at the 2002 European Championship in Denmark, and a year later at the World Championship in Croatia they became only 7th, which meant that Trefilov's team could not qualify for the 2004 Olympic Games. Only one point was needed to reach the semi-finals in Croatia, but Russia failed to do that against France in the group stage, losing 19–20; a draw would have been enough to qualify.\nAfter the fourth-best result at the 2004 European Championship in Hungary, Team Russia rose from the ashes at the 2005 World Championship in Saint Petersburg, repeating the 2001 success in Italy.\nRussia lost in the final of the 2006 European Championship to Norway, and so could not directly qualify for the Olympics; however, Russia rematched Norway at the 2007 World Championship in France in the final. A number of top handball players such as Lyudmila Bodnieva, MVP of the previous World championships and member of the All-Star Team at the 2000 and 2006 European championships, Irina Bliznova, who was injured in the group stage, Natalya Shipilova, who could not compete in the semi-finals. Goal keeper Inna Suslina made a great game, saving three out of five penalties. Russia won 29–24.\nNorway returned the favour at the 2008 Olympics in the gold medal game. Already in the early stage leading ten balls, the Vikings hindered the Russians coming back, and so Russia lost 34–27. Russia won silver.\nAfter the Olympic Games, Anna Kareeva, Oksana Romenskaya and Natalya Shipilova decided to retire from handball. Prior to the 2008 European Championship in Macedonia, players such as Polina Vyakhireva, Yana Uskova, Ekaterina Andryushina, Lyudmila Postnova and Irina Bliznova could not compete for Russia due to injuries or disease; they were replaced by nine debutants. Russia again met Norway in the semi-finals, and as previously, the Scandinavians started well, leading 7–1 in the beginning. In the third-place match between Germany, Russia claimed bronze.\nThe Russians defeated the Norwegians in the semi-final of the 2009 World Championship with a score of 28–20. In the final, Russia claimed the gold medal by defeating France, 25–22.\n2009–2013: Decline and Retirement of Trefilov.\nAfter the 2009 World Championships, team Russia saw a number of disappointing results. They became 7th at the 2010 European Championship and 6th at the 2011 World Championship. Russia could not get beyond the quarterfinal of the 2012 Olympics, losing there to South Korea. After the London Olympics, the new head coach became Vitaly Krokhin.\nIn June 2013, Russia fought for the qualification to the World Championship. In the playoff round, Russia won the first leg in Rotterdam, 27–26, but lost the next leg in Rostov-on-Don, 21–33. With that said, Russia for the first time did not qualify for the Worlds.\n2013–19: Trefilov's Return and Olympic Gold.\nOn 16 September 2013, Evgeny Trefilov returned as head coach. He debuted at the 2014 European Championship, but Russia became a dreadful 14th, the worst ever result in the European championships. However, on 7 and 13 June 2015, Russia twice defeated Germany in the playoffs and qualified for the 2015 World Championship. In their first match they defeated the Norwegians, 26–25. However, the Russians only reached the quarterfinals, losing there to Poland. In the playoffs, team Russia was placed 5th.\nRussia qualified to the Olympics for the third time, through the qualification tournament taking place from 18 to 20 March 2016 in Astrakhan. In the group stage of the Olympic tournament, Russia defeated all of its rivals. In the knockout stage, the Russians defeated Angola in the quarterfinal, and in the marathon semi-final match between Norway claimed the deciding point in overtime. In the final, Russia defeated France to claim its first Olympic gold in women's handball.\nAt the 2018 European Championships, the last time under the guidance of Trefilov, Russia broke through the final for the first time since 2006. Russia lost to host France, who took its first championship title.\n2019–20: Ambros Martin as new head coach.\nIn August 2019, national team's head coach Trefliov was replaced by Rostov-Don's Ambros Martin. Trefilov took the post as vice-president of the Handball Federation of Russia. Team Russia entered the 2019 World Championships as the main favourite. The squad, primarily including 20 players, was reduced to 18 players; injured Antonina Skorobogatchenko and alternate Olga Shcherbak were dismissed. The Russian team, after winning eight matches in a row was eventually defeated by the Dutch in the semi-finals by a one-point difference, which happened after a last-minute shot in the second half, leaving a final result of 32–33 for Russia against the Netherlands. Russia went on to win the bronze match against Norway, 33–28; this was the first time since 2009 that the Russians won a medal at the Worlds.\nRussia went to the 2020 Europeans with less optimism; three injured top players – Elena Mikhaylichenko, Anna Sen and Anna Viakhireva – had to skip the championships; reduced team practice sessions of only one week, for the first time taking place in a sports school hall; missing test matches due to the worldwide situation imposed by the COVID-19 outbreak. Russia started well on the Championships, finishing first in its group in the preliminary round. In the main round, the Russians defeated Montenegro, played a draw match against France and lost against Denmark. As a result, they did not qualify for the semifinals. Martin decided to retire from his position as head coach, expressing his will to focus on family life instead.\n2021: Alekseyev replaces Martin.\nAfter Martin retired in December 2020, Lada's Alexey Alekseyev, who previously served as assistant coach for the national team and was the head coach of Luch, replaced the Spaniard. Furthermore, the coaching staff was renewed, now featuring former handball player Olga Akopyan and Rostov-Don's assistant coach Tomáš Hlavatý. Also, Trefilov took the position as consultant. Prior to the Tokyo's 2020 Summer Olympics, which were postponed to July–August 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, team Russia went through the Hungarian leg of the qualification tournament, which took place Győr. Two of four participating teams were granted a ticket to the upcoming Olympics. Russia won all three matches against Serbia, Kazakhstan and Hungary.\nThe squad for the Olympics was announced on 2 June. Prior to the Olympics, on 26 June Russia played a friendly match against the Netherlands in Japan. A week later they played another friendly match, losing a second time to the Dutch team. Goalkeeper Anastasia Lagina and outside left Daria Samokhina were named alternates. The team lost its opening Olympic match to Sweden, then drew Hungary, and after that went on a five-match winning streak all the way to the gold medal game, beating Norway in the semi-finals by one point, just as they did in 2016. And just as in 2016, Russia faced France in the final. This time, the French prevailed, 30–25, but Russia won silver, its third Olympic medal after Soviet collapse.\nOn 23 September 2021, Lyudmila Bodniyeva was announced as the team's new head coach, after Alekseyev's contract ran out.\n2022: Suspension from international competition.\nIn reaction to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the International Handball Federation banned Russian and Belarusian athletes and officials, and the European Handball Federation suspended the national teams of Russia and Belarus as well as Russian and Belarusian clubs competing in European handball competitions. Referees, officials, and commission members from Russia and Belarus will not be called upon for future activities, and new organisers will be sought for the YAC 16 EHF Beach Handball EURO and the Qualifier Tournaments for the Beach Handball EURO 2023, which were to be held in Moscow.\nTeam.\nCurrent squad.\nSquad for the 2021 World Women's Handball Championship.\nHead coach: Lyudmila Bodniyeva\nNotable players.\nSeveral Russian players have seen their individual performance recognized at international tournaments, either as Most Valuable Player, best defense player or as a member of the All-Star Team."

The club was renamed the Edmonton Esquimaux in 1908 and again as the Edmonton Eskimos in 1910. Later it took took the name Edmonton Boosters, then the Edmonton Hi-Grads in 1936, then yet another incarnation of the Eskimos before ceasing operation as the Second World War began. The team is neither affiliated with the current franchise, the Edmonton Elks (also previously named Eskimos), nor forms part of its history.\nFootball had been played in the city and environs for nearly two decades before the Edmonton Rugby Foot-ball Club was founded in 1907. The first game in Alberta was played in Edmonton, with Edmonton and Clover Bar (an outlying community, now a suburb) playing to a scoreless tie in 1890. \"The first record of an organized rugby club in Edmonton appeared in the Edmonton bulletin on September 19, 1891.\" In 1891 Edmonton defeated Calgary 6-5 in the Alberta Total-point Challenge Series. A team from Edmonton (actually the outlying community of Fort Saskatchewan) had a picture taken of themselves after they defeated a Calgary team (in Calgary,) declaring themselves \"Champions of Alberta\"; the picture has two dates on it, being taken in either 1893 or 1895.\n\"The Edmonton Rugby Foot-ball Club was formed on April 10, 1907, and adopted the uniform colors of black with yellow facings. Edmonton played its first game on November 9 and defeated the Calgary City Rugby Foot-ball Club 26-5 at the Edmonton Exhibition Grounds.\" The club was renamed the \"Edmonton Esquimaux\" in 1908 and again as the \"Edmonton Eskimos\" in 1910. They competed in the Alberta Rugby Football League and later Alberta Rugby Football Union (AFRU) when it was created in 1911. In the years before and after the First World War the city was represented by the Edmonton Civics in 1914 and the Edmonton Canucks in 1919.\nThe Edmonton Eskimos were AFRU and WCFRU champions in 1921, earning the right to compete for the Grey Cup in the 9th Grey Cup championship game – the first time for a Western Canadian team – losing 23–0 to the undefeated Toronto Argonauts. The team was renamed the \"Edmonton Elks\" in 1922 and represented the WCFRU in the 10th Grey Cup, losing 13–1 to the Queen's University Golden Gaels.\nThe team changed back to the name \"Eskimos\" for the 1923 season, winning their third consecutive AFRU championship but failing to clinch the WCFRU championship. The Eskimos did not win the 1924 AFRU championship, and folded before the 1925 season.\nThe Eskimos team returned for the 1928 season, winning the ARFU or ARFL championship for the seventh time in 14 seasons of competition. Their last season was 1929, when the team was succeeded by a new club called the Edmonton Boosters. The Boosters folded after 3 season, and were later followed by the Edmonton Hi-Grads in 1936 (a team of high school graduate all-stars) and then yet another incarnation of the Eskimos, a team lasting two seasons (1938 and 1939) before ceasing operation as the Second World War began."

They did not qualify for the 2019 Rugby World Cup\nKorea participated in the 2008 Asian Five Nations, the inaugural Asian Five Nations.\nHistory.\nIt is unknown when rugby was first played in Korea. During the mid-19th century, European sailors are recorded as playing some of the earliest games in north east Asia, in ports such as Shanghai and Yokohama in neighbouring China and Japan, but it is unclear whether this occurred in Korea itself. \nHowever, it seems certain it had some presence by the mid-20th century. Korea was to become occupied by Japan, the main rugby playing nation of Asia, and it could well have been introduced then. In the amateur days, South Korea maintained a fierce rivalry with Japan. \nAfter World War II, and later, during the period of the Korean War, the large influx of troops from Commonwealth countries cemented its presence. One legacy of this is that South Korean rugby has traditionally been strongest in the army.\nHowever, South Korean rugby has a second string to its bow. The massive growth of the economy since the 1960s, meant that a number of Korean corporations were to set up company teams along the lines of those in Japan, and this has broken up the former dominance of the military. \nSouth Korea made a failed attempt to have rugby union at the Olympic Games readmitted, when they hosted the games in Seoul. Roh Tae-woo, who was South Korean president at the time, had been a player.\nSouth Korea have emerged as an important rugby nation in Asia, since they won the Asian Championship in 1990.\nDespite having never qualified for a Rugby World Cup, South Korea were represented in 1995 in South Africa, with Han Moon-soo refereeing the fixture between France and the Ivory Coast.\nExpatriate rugby.\nExpatriate rugby was first played in Korea in 1972. An expat team called the Seoul Wanderers were formed to give opposition to both the local university teams and stationed army teams. This team was made up of players from the UK, New Zealand, and Australia. The team was disbanded in 1976. \nHowever, the void caused by a lack of rugby was soon to be filled. In late 1977 Billy Cornett and Brad Handley got together and decided to form a new expat club - the Seoul Survivors. The club is still around today.\nOther Expatriate clubs include the Busan Bandits Rugby Football Club (based in Busan), the Ulsan Goblins Rugby Club (based in Ulsan) and the Stars &amp; Stripes Korea Rugby Club (based in Pyeongtaek).\nCurrent squad.\nSouth Korea 26-man squad for the 2023 Asian Rugby Championship.

They were drawn in Group A with Japan, Taiwan and Malaysia. After only losing by five points to Malaysia, they would concede 92 more points against the other two teams in the group to finish bottom of the group with no points.\nIn 1997, Sri Lanka participated in the opening round of 1999 Rugby World Cup qualifying. After defeating Thailand and Singapore in the opening round, they next took on Chinese Taipei and Malaysia with the winner going through to the third round. After knocking off Malaysia by 22 points in Kuala Lumpur in their opening match, they would be eliminated after losing to Chinese Taipei 31-27 which gave Chinese Taipei the spot into the third round.\nNew millennium.\nThe furthest they have made was to Round 2 of the Asian qualifying competition for the 2007 Rugby World Cup in France. The Sri Lanka rugby team performed above expectations during the qualifying campaign for the World Cup, and saw their world ranking improve from 68th to 43rd place, and its Asian ranking improve to fifth place.\n2010s.\nAsian Five Nations and World Cup qualifying;\n2008 - 2010\n2008 was the first year of Asian Five Nations, which replaced the ARFU Asian Rugby Championship and the ARFU Asian Rugby Series.

The Chinese team withdrew from the tournament due to lack of visa availability and were relegated to Division Two.\nIn 2009 Sri Lanka again finished third in the Divisional tournament defeating Thailand (51-17) in the 3rd-place final, remaining in Division One.\nSri Lanka won Division One of the 2010 Divisional tournament beating Singapore (23-16) in the final, thereby winning promotion to the 2011 Asian Five Nations for the first time.\nDespite a drawn match with United Arab Emirates (13-13), Sri Lanka lost its remaining three matches in the 2011 Asian Five Nations tournament and finished last, resulting in its demotion out of the Asian Five Nations.\nIn the 2012 Division tournament the team won two matches but were defeated by the Philippines, which meant Sri Lanka missed out on promotion and remained in Division One.\nAt the 2013 Division tournament held in Colombo, Sri Lanka were successful in winning all three of its matches earning a promotion to the Asian Five Nations.\nIn 2014 Sri Lanka lost all four of its matches in the Asian Five Nations and were relegated back to Division One.\nAt the 2015 Division tournament held in the Philippines in May, Sri Lanka beat the Philippines 27-14 to become the champions of the Asian Division 1, resulting in the team qualifying to compete in a challenge match, in June, against the third ranked Asian team and a potential spot in the 2016 Asian Championship.

This was the nation's third time participating in a Winter Olympic Games. The delegation consisted of two alpine skiers, Tahir Bisić and Enis Bećirbegović. Bisić finished in 29th place in the men's slalom, and 44th in the giant slalom. Bećirbegović failed to finish the giant slalom, his only event.\nBackground.\nThe Olympic Committee of Bosnia and Herzegovina was recognized by the International Olympic Committee on 31 December 1992. Despite this, they made their first Olympic appearance at the 1992 Summer Olympics, and their first Winter Olympics performance at the 1994 Winter Olympics. They have participated in every Olympics since then, making Salt Lake City their third time appearing at a Winter Olympics. The Bosnia and Herzegovinan delegation to Salt Lake City consisted of two alpine skiers, Tahir Bisić and Enis Bećirbegović.

        "text": "The McGill University Rowing Club (MURC) is a rowing club that represents McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The club is currently a Level 2 intercollegiate program and thus receives partial funding from the university. As the only Quebec university with a varsity rowing program, the club participates in the Ontario University Athletics (OUA) conference. It is a registered club with Rowing Canada.\nHistory.\nThe club dates back to 1924 when it originally operated out of the Lachine Boat Club. Within two years the club established a rivalry opposite the University of Toronto Rowing Club with the inception of the McGill-Toronto boat race. In the ten-year existence of the annual race McGill would only win the first two meetings. By 1939 both crews would cease activities with the outbreak of World War II.\nRowing returned to McGill following the 1976 Summer Olympics with the revived club taking advantage of the then new Olympic Basin and its facilities. Initially only men crews raced with the first women crew taking to the water four years later in 1980. The following year the first Canadian University Rowing Championships (CURC) was held at the basin with McGill acting as hosts. The national championship returned to the basin in 2004, and again in 2009. In 2004 the men's eight won a silver medal, with current national team member Derek O'Farrell as bow seat. The 2009 event saw the women's lightweight coxed four score the Martlet's first ever medal (bronze), and the Redmen's first ever gold medal in the lightweight men's double won by Renaud Garon Gendron and Jonathan Rinaldi.\nClub colours.\nThe club colours are red and white matching the colours of the university. The blades are coloured red with two white triangles on the edge forming a sideways M. The logo is the McGill shield in front of two crossed McGill oars with the university's motto Grandescunt Aucta Labore (By work, all things increase and grow) on the bottom.\nFacilities.\nThe Olympic Basin on Notre Dame Island acts as the home waterways for the club sharing it and its facilities with the Montreal Rowing Club (MRC). Both clubs are run independently from each other although they do routinely support one another. These facilities include:\nThe club also has an ergometer room at the Currie Gym, part of McGill's athletic complex. Additionally, athletes have access to the varsity weight room as well as other services.\nMcGill-Queen's Boat Race.\nSince 1997 McGill crews have taken on crews from Queen's University in the annual McGill-Queen's Challenge. Considered the Canadian equivalent of the famed Cambridge-Oxford and Harvard-Yale boat races, it takes place in late April alternating between Montreal and Kingston. The 2006 race was hosted by McGill which chose the Lachine Canal as the venue. Reviews were so positive that there has since been talks of making it the permanent home of the race. As of 2018, the race has not been held for a number of years, due to logistical challenges involving exam schedules.\nThe men race for the Challenge Blade, a port side blade painted with Queen's colours on the inside and McGill colours on the outside. The women compete for the Challenge Trophy which is adorned with the wood handle of a sweep oar. The overall winner receives the D. Lorne Gales Challenge Cup named after original McGill rower D. Lorne Gales.\nLorne Gales Challenge Cup Winners.\n2008 - Queen's\n2007 - Queen's\n2006 - Queen's\n2005 - Queen's\n2004 - Queen's\n2003 - McGill\n2002 - McGill\n2001 - Queen's\n2000 - Queen's\n1999 - McGill\n1998 - McGill\n1997 - McGill\nMen's Challenge Blade Winners.\n2008 - Queen's\n2007 - Queen's\n2006 - Queen's\n2005 - Queen's\n2004 - Queen's\n2003 - McGill\n2002 - McGill\n2001 - Queen's\n2000 - McGill\n1999 - McGill\n1998 - McGill\nWomen's Challenge Trophy Winners.\n2008 - McGill\n2007 - Queen's\n2006 - McGill\n2005 - Queen's\n2004 - Queen's\n2003 - Queen's\n2002 - Queen's\n2001 - Queen's\n2000 - Queen's\n1999 - McGill\nMcGill-Toronto Boat Race.\nSince 2020, there has been mutual interest between crews from McGill University and University of Toronto in starting a new annual challenge to take place in early May. The duel would consist of a race between men's and women's eights from the two teams. The Covid-19 Pandemic has postponed efforts to organize the event but both teams remain interested.\nThe first challenge took place on May 6, 2023, consisting of the men's race and inaugural women's and reserve's races. Initially set to take place at the Lachine Rowing Club, the challenge was moved to the Olympic Basin after extreme weather conditions nearly sank one of Toronto's reserve eights. The men's and women's races took place at the basin, along with a redo of the reserve's race. Toronto won all of them."

        "text": "Pro Swing Inc v Elta Golf Inc 2006 SCC 52 is a leading Canadian case decided by the Supreme Court of Canada on conflict of laws. The Court held that foreign non-monetary judgments may be enforced in Canada where they have been rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction, the rendering is final, and the nature of the judgment is such that comity requires it to be enforced.\nBackground.\nPro Swing is an American company that sells golf equipment under the \"trident\" trademark. Elta Golf is an Ontario company that sells golf equipment that includes products with a trade-mark similar to that of the \"trident\".\nPro Swing sued for trade-mark infringement in Ohio. A settlement was reached which ordered Elta Golf to refrain from selling any products with the trident logo.\nIn 2002, Pro Swing filed to an Ohio court for contempt of court for Elta's breach of the settlement. The court granted the order. Pro Swing then filed in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice for enforcement of the order.\nThe motions judge found that the non-monetary order was valid but found certain parts duplicative and had them severed from the order.\nOn appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, the court found the order was unenforceable due to ambiguity in the order regarding its scope of application.\nOpinion of the Court.\nJustice Deschamps wrote the majority opinion. She ordered the appeal dismissed.\nThe old rule for foreign judgments required that they be final, conclusive, and for a monetary amount. Deschamps found this rule to be outdated and stated that a new rule for non-monetary orders based on comity was needed. \nShe proposed that non-monetary judgments should be enforced when\nOn the current facts she found the order unenforceable. The contempt order is quasi-criminal which should never be enforced. This public law element eclipses any other private law element. She further advised in \"obiter\" that courts should ensure there will be no conflict once the order is rendered and should not allow punishments that are not available under the foreign jurisdiction.\nDissent.\nMcLachlin, in dissent, argued that incremental change was a preferable approach. The standard should be based on comity, order, and fairness. \nWhen assessing an application, the court should not look at the judgment's merits. The only restrictions upon enforcement of foreign non-monetary judgments should be:"

        "title": "St. Vincent and the Grenadines Rugby Union",
        "text": "Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Rugby Union is the governing body for rugby union in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. It is considered a Tier 3 rugby nation by World Rugby of which it is a full member. It is also a member of the Rugby Americas North (RAN). Saint Vincent and the Grenadines men's and women's teams compete regionally against other teams in this group.\nHistory.\nThe St. Vincent and the Grenadines Rugby Union (SVGRU) came into existence on Sunday 18 January 1998, when the first game of touch rugby was played at the Sion Hill playing field using four traffic cones as pitch markers.\nIt all came about following a chance conversation. This stimulated an expatriate Englishman, John Townend, to return form his Christmas vacation in 1997 with plenty of enthusiasm and two rugby balls. John Townend contacted two Antipodean expatriates: Kelly Glass, a highly accomplished rugby player from South Island, New Zealand, and Geoff Hyde, an Australian tourism adviser, suggesting a game of touch rugby the following Sunday morning. There were seven players at the first game: Carver Alexander, Ernst De Freitas, Kelly Glass, Kirk Hobson-Garcia, Geoff Hyde, John Townend and Delon Williams, a local Rastafarian who later became known as \"Speedy\".\nAfter playing for two hours, the group retired to Villa Beach with a crate of beer, to re-hydrate (any excuse would do) and to soothe aching muscles in the sea. Rugby had been introduced to St. Vincent.\nFrom the early days there was a strong interest from girls, who took an instant liking to the idea of \"touch\" rugby. The games then continued every Sunday, and it was soon found that between Kirk, Kelly, Andrew, and Scott Hadley that there were already some excellent and accomplished players on the island. In addition, they were able to attract other good players, namely Derek Hadley who was visiting from Australia and Father Pope Faifal from Samoa, working with the Catholic mission. In terms of the girls, Jackie De Freitas soon joined, together with some Canadian volunteers, namely Janice Madill and Lisa Lilajehto. One other girl who was to become a big favourite was Loretta \"Hot Lips\" Skrok. She became notorious for her trick of taking a swig of strong rum and “flame throwing” at parties. Peace Corps Volunteers Becky Buster and Maria Caluag also became great team members. The local ranks were swelled by the contribution of Lorna \"Turbo\" Williams from Overland in the Carib community, Delia King from Calliaqua and Yvonne Bakker from Kingstown.\nIn the early days they were definitely seen as an expatriate group of Americans, Australians, British, Canadians, New Zealanders, Trinidadians, Samoans, and a few Vincentians. Rugby was definitely perceived as a white man's sport and a relatively rough game at that. It was soon expanded to playing on Wednesday afternoons as the numbers rose and transferred Sunday practices to Saturday. Despite the expatriate character it was the Vincentians, notably Andrew Hadley and Jackie De Freitas who took the early lead in developing the club, with help from Geoff Hyde.\nSVG Rugby has a significant history of developing home grown talent. In the amateur era the female structure was highly successful, producing a large number of first team players and internationals. In the transition to the professional era it was recognized that a clear development program was needed to develop \"complete\" players capable of playing professional rugby at the highest level. A key difference between amateur and professional rugby is the physical demands placed on players.\nThey decided to call the team \"Amazona Guildingii\" after the rare and graceful Vincentian parrot, and selected the national colours of green, yellow and blue for their jerseys and shorts. Soon afterwards those that could afford it, purchased their own uniforms. Their motto is to \"Strive to excellence and keep on striving til the end.\"\nWomen's rugby.\nHistory was made on Sunday 6 December 1998 at 4:30 p.m., when at the International Caribbean Rugby Seven a Side Competition in Trinidad, a ladies team from St. Vincent and the Grenadines defeated a ladies team representing the mighty Trinidad and Tobago.\nIt is believed this is the first time in the Caribbean that Ladies have played the full contact game of Rugby Union at International Level. And all of this from humble beginnings in January 1998 when the game of touch rugby was introduced into these islands on Sunday mornings at the Sion Hill Playing Field -all with the blessing of the National Sports Council.\nFrom being 19-0 up at half time, the St. Vincent Ladies team resplendent in the blue, green and yellow colours of their team, the Amazona Guildingii, (named after the St. Vincent Parrot) ran out eventual winners by 29 points to 12. The Trinidadians, with much greater resources, put on a stronger team in the second half, but the Vincy girls soon closed them down and went further ahead.\nOne would not like to single out individuals for praise as the whole team played magnificently on the day, but one person, Lorna \"Turbo\" Williams of Overland was an absolute star at scrum half. She tackled like a tiger, and every time \"Turbo \"got the ball, it was clear a try was in the making. Eventually she ran in two tries, Janice Madill at hooker ran in two, and Becky Buster in the centre burst through for the fifth try for the Amazona Guildingii’s. Becky also converted two tries, with fine drop kicks over the cross bar.\nOthers who deserve praise for ferocious tackling and fine ball handling skills include; Jackie de Freitas (prop), Delhia King (wing) from Biabou (who performed four citizens arrests during the match). Other members of the team who performed well were Maria Caluag (centre), Loretta Skrok (prop) and a couple of \"ringers\" who joined in on the day; Sarah from Sweden and Tracy from New Orleans.\nThe team was captained by Yvonne Bakker (wing) who kept her composure throughout the game, and if it wasn't for the rather short dead ball line, would have also have been credited with a try.\nHowever, since the inception of the founding women's team, there has been a steady decline in interest among women. Unfortunately, the team has ceased to exist.\nRugby League.\nIn the continual effort to increase interest in and awareness of rugby, in addition to maintaining interest in the sport, SVG Rugby have reinstated the Saturday Rugby League. One Saturday a month, the SVG RUwill host seven a-side rugby matches in different communities.\nThe Rugby League serves as a platform for growing the game, by showcasing the sport of rugby in communities throughout Mainland St. Vincent, while allowing newcomers to see and participate in rugby. The Rugby League also provides existing members with regular outlets for healthy competition, garnering continued interest in rugby.\nTo date, league team names are:\nGrassroots Rugby Programme.\nYouth rugby in St. Vincent was once an unstoppable force. SVG Rugby had a very successful U19 team. In recent years, the youth programme has lost momentum. However, with the election of a new Executive Board, the Grassroots Rugby Programme is back.\nExecutive\nThe SVG Rugby Grassroots Rugby Programme aims to promote rugby development, team play, and sportsmanship for school age and out-of-school age youth and has established teams in various schools and communities throughout St. Vincent.\nThe Grassroots Rugby Programme focuses on Rookie Rugby, or tag rugby. Tag rugby is a fun, easy to play, non-contact rugby game that is designed as an introduction to teach the basic skills and techniques needed to play competitive rugby in the future.\nSVG Rugby worked with World Rugby to implement the Get Into Rugby youth initiative.\nMatches and results.\nThe first game ever played was against the British Royal Navy destroyer , on 8 February 1998. The game was won by the home side.\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines attempted to qualify for the 2007 Rugby World Cup in France, playing the first match of the Americas qualifying tournament. They played a preliminary qualifier against Saint Lucia in May 2005. The winner would progress to the South Pool of Round 1a, however, Saint Lucia won the match 36-25.\nOn 29 March 2008, Saint Vincent was defeated by Mexico 47-7 in a pre-qualifier for the right to enter the NAWIRA region qualifying process for Rugby World Cup 2011."

They have played over 100 internationals.\nThe national side is ranked 80th in the world, as of 16 January 2023.\nHistory.\nThe first known rugby players from Serbia were Serbian students in George Heriot's School in Edinburgh, Scotland during The First World War. On March, 9th 1918 they played their first unofficial international game, in front of 10,000 spectators, against a British Dominions VII and won by eight points to three. Notable players from this period included Toma Tomić from Leskovac, Dimitrije Dulkanović from Ćuprija and Danilo Pavlović from Prokuplje. \nSerbian students also played rugby at the High School of Dundee and Hillhead High School in Glasgow. The best Serbian player in Scotland was Slavoljub DJordjevic from Čajetina. He played more than 100 games for Hillhead HS, Glasgow University RFC and Hillhead RFC in Scotland rugby top competitions.\nSerbia played as a part of Yugoslavia since 1919 until 1992, then as FR Yugoslavia until 2003, and, finally, as Serbia and Montenegro from 2003 to 2006. Yugoslavia made their official international debut in 1968 against a Romanian XV, losing 3 points to 11. They made their full test debut the following month, losing 6 points to 29 against Bulgaria. They won their first official international match in 1969, defeating Bulgaria 22 points to six.\nDuring the 60s, 70s and 80s, Serbian players played for the Yugoslavia national rugby union team alongside players from the rest of Yugoslavia. After the wars and breakup of Yugoslavia, the Yugoslavia team consisted of players from Serbia only, and they played their first full international against at Vršac in 1996.\nAfter 1996, playing as FR Yugoslavia and Serbia and Montenegro until 2006, they have played regularly in FIRA-AER and IRB competitions.\nCurrent squad.\nStarting line-up for the 2023-24 Rugby Europe Conference match against Moldova.\nOverall.\nBelow is table of the representative rugby matches played by the Serbia national XV at test level up until 20 April 2024:"

        "title": "College ice hockey",
        "text": "College ice hockey is played principally in the United States and Canada, though leagues exist outside North America.\nIn the United States, competitive \"college hockey\" refers to ice hockey played between colleges and universities within the governance structure established by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).\nIn Canada, the term \"college hockey\" refers to community college and small college ice hockey that currently consists of a varsity conference – the Alberta Colleges Athletics Conference (ACAC) – and a club league – the British Columbia Intercollegiate Hockey League (BCIHL). \"University hockey\" is the term used for hockey primarily played at four-year institutions; that level of the sport is governed by U Sports.\nHistory.\nIn fall of 1892, Malcolm Greene Chace, then a freshman at Brown University, and Robert Wrenn, of Harvard University, were participating in a tennis tournament in Niagara Falls, Ontario. They both had dabbled a bit in a sport called ice polo; in Ontario, they met members of the Victoria Hockey Club, who introduced them to their similar game of ice hockey, and invited the two to visit Montreal to learn about their version of the game.\nThe next winter, during Christmas break 1894-1895, Chace (who had by then transferred to Yale University) and Wrenn returned to Canada with a group of college students from several universities. The cadre was one of the first American ice hockey teams and, after a 10-game tour of Canada, the students returned to their respective schools with the intent of founding collegiate ice hockey clubs.\nYale, where Chace served as team captain and player-coach, was the first of the group to organize its team and in February 1896 the Bulldogs played the first two intercollegiate ice hockey games against Johns Hopkins University. While Johns Hopkins' program would cease for 90 years after 1898, Yale has served as a bedrock of college hockey ever since, playing continually including through the Great Depression and two world wars. Yale's 125-year continuous streak was broken for the 2020-21 season, when all Ivy League winter sports were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAnother game often cited as the \"first game of intercollegiate ice hockey played in the United States\" is a well-documented contest on January 19, 1898 at Franklin Park, Boston. Students from Brown took the train to Boston, where they commandeered a patch of a frozen pond in Franklin Park, asked pleasure skaters to give them room, and played students from Harvard. The details and outcome of the game were recorded in the following day's Boston Herald: Brown 6, Harvard 0.\nWithin ten years all eight schools that would eventually comprise the Ivy League had played their first game as well as several other nearby teams. A lack of available ice was the primary concern for most schools as to whether they should start a program or continue supporting an existing team but that did not detract from the enthusiasm of the students.\nEarly style of play.\nFor at least the first 25 years of intercollegiate play the teams used a 7-on-7 format, a typical setup for turn of the century ice hockey. On a faceoff players were typically arranged as either four forwards, two point men and one goaltender or three forwards, one rover two point men and one goaltender.\nIn the four forward setup the players were arranged from a faceoff as a left and right wing (or end) on the outside and a left and right center on the inside. The two point men and goaltender were typically arrayed in a line from center ice to the goal as cover point, point and goaltender. If viewed from above the players would form a ' T '.\nIf a rover was used instead there would only be one center. The rover would line up either in a defensive or offensive position depending on the need. The remaining five positions would be unchanged. By the 1921–22 season college hockey adopted the increasingly more common 6–aside format with the abandonment of the second center/rover position and the two point men being renamed as 'defensemen'. The change from point men to defensemen comes as a result of an alignment change where instead of lining up one in front of the other, the two defensive players would play beside one another.\nThe ice surfaces that the players played on were not of a uniform size. Rinks like the St. Nicholas Rink or Duquesne Gardens were few and far between and quite often teams would only be able to play on frozen ponds. Slightly more consistent were the length of games, however, there was no set game time. Most were played as two 20-minute halves but some games had 15- or 25-minute halves and others were one 40-minute period. Occasionally games were not able to be played entirely at one time so the teams would arrange to meet at a later date to finish the match. Overtime after a tie did not always occur, as ice times at public skating rinks were constrained, but even when teams were able to play extra frames the rules were somewhat flexible; because there were no lights illuminating the ponds, games could only be played while the sun was shining and in the winter months dusk came quickly. The teams would attempt to finish the game with a winner decided but even after multiple overtimes ties did result.\nStabilizing the game.\nFrom the start college hockey teams were rarely in a place of surety. In the 10 years since Johns Hopkins University's exit in 1898 at least a dozen teams were forced to cancel seasons or suspend their program entirely, including some of the more financially sound institutions like Cornell University and Brown University. The two main factors in this were interest from the student body and the lack of available or good ice. While the interest conundrum required a more nuanced solution, the ice troubles had a more tangible answer. Teams near to public skating rinks would be able to hold their games at venues where ice conditions could be ensured but at the start, with so few available, some programs came up with novel solutions. One such idea came from Harvard University who, after completing construction of their football stadium in 1904, decided to erect two open-air rinks on the field for the team to use.\nAs rinks continued to be built in areas near to the colleges, specifically the Boston Arena, New Haven Arena and Philadelphia Ice Palace, college teams had more and more ice rinks available to them and with most using artificial ice the teams were no longer dependent on weather conditions. Owing to the popularity of the game the first on-campus, purpose-built arena was constructed by Princeton University in 1923. Most schools were content with buying ice time from local rink operators while others simply didn't want to fund the building of their own version of the Hobey Baker Memorial Rink. As the weather warmed in the 1930s and 40s many of these teams would be forced to decide whether they were willing to financially support their ice hockey programs or not. Army, for instance, had Smith Rink built in 1930 while Cornell struggled with the ice on Beebe Lake until after World War II.\nWorld War I aftermath.\nThe vast majority of teams ceased operating in 1917 after the United States entered World War I. This made sense as many of the students who would otherwise have been playing had instead joined the military. Because the war ended in November 1918 many of the teams returned to the ice for the 1918–19 season and, while the game continued to grow around New England, an interesting development happened shortly after the armistice was signed.\nColleges in the midwest began their own ice hockey programs. At the beginning these were typically restricted to upper-echelon universities like the University of Minnesota or the University of Michigan but some of the smaller schools got into the game as well. From the MIAC's foundation in 1920, member schools have played ice hockey and were able to establish the first consistent lower-tier competition in college hockey.\nGreat Depression.\nWhile college ice hockey flourished in the 1920s the Great Depression did have an impact on the game in the '30s. Most schools that had established programs made the effort to keep their teams going but some less-acclaimed teams like Pennsylvania or Columbia decided that ice hockey wasn't worth the cost. Some of the smaller schools like Rensselaer had no choice but to suspend their programs as they did not have the resources that a Harvard or Yale did. After the first half of the 1930s, however, the depression lessened and schools were able to found or restart their programs. The game continued to expand west with the addition of Gonzaga, USC, UCLA and others, however, none of the Pacific-coast teams would make it to the 1950s.\nWorld War II hiatus.\nAs was the case during World War I, the majority of universities suspended their ice hockey teams during World War II. Most of teams that were active just prior to the U.S.' entry played during the 1942–43 season but were mothballed afterwards. There were notable exceptions such as Yale and Dartmouth, who continued to play through the duration of the war, but many teams returned to the ice for an abbreviated 1945–46 season. One benefit to college hockey that resulted from the war was the G.I. Bill which helped returning servicemen pay for a college education. With a much larger student body and a resulting influx in cash, colleges were more able to afford to support an ice hockey team.\nNCAA tournament.\nBy 1947, college ice hockey was still a regional sport, being localized in the northeast and northern Midwest (with a few exceptions) but despite the low number of teams playing, the NCAA finally instituted a national tournament. At the start the tournament invited two participants from the two regions: east and west. The east region was loosely defined as any college east of the Pennsylvania-Ohio border with all other teams being lumped into the west region. The tournament was held at the Broadmoor World Arena for the first ten years. Partially due to a lack of competition, Michigan was invited to participate in each of the first ten tournaments and won six National Championships in that time.\nNCAA.\nThe National Collegiate Athletic Association has conducted national championships for men's ice hockey since 1948, and women's ice hockey since 2001.\nU.S. college hockey players must be deemed eligible for NCAA competition by the NCAA Eligibility Center, a process that examines a student-athlete's academic qualifications and amateur status. Players who have participated in the Canadian Hockey League or any professional hockey league are considered ineligible.\nMen's U.S. college hockey is a feeder system to the National Hockey League. As of the 2010–11 season, 30 percent of NHL players (a total of 294) had U.S. college hockey experience prior to turning professional, an increase of 35 percent from the previous 10 years. That percentage has been maintained the past three seasons, with a record 301 NHL players coming from college hockey in 2011–12.\nMen.\nOne hundred thirty-eight colleges and universities sponsor men's ice hockey in the NCAA's three divisions.\nDivision I.\nNCAA Division I will have 64 ice hockey teams in the 2023–24 season, two more than in 2022–23. Of these schools, 20 are Division II or III athletic programs that \"play up\" to Division I in hockey, and 16 of the full Division I members are in the Football Bowl Subdivision. Seven of the FBS schools compete in the Big Ten Conference; six are full conference members and the seventh is a single-sport member.\nThe NCAA Division I Championship is a 16-team, single-elimination tournament, divided into four, 4-team regional tournaments. The winner of each regional advances to the Frozen Four to compete for the national championship. For many years, 5 teams earned automatic bids through winning conference tournament championships, while 11 earned at-large berths through a selection committee. With the addition of the Big Ten hockey conference for the 2013–14 season, the tournament now features 6 automatic qualifiers, and 10 at-large bids. The ranking system that is used to determine the at-large teams is known as the Pairwise Rankings, which uses a number of ranking factors to create a scoring system for all NCAA Division I teams.\nIn 2023–24, one school will play its first season of Division I hockey, while another will resume D-I play after a two-season hiatus. Augustana University, a Division II school in South Dakota (and not to be confused with Augustana College, a Division III school in Illinois), is launching a new varsity program as the newest member of the Central Collegiate Hockey Association. Robert Morris, which had suspended its men's and women's hockey programs after the 2020–21 season due to COVID-19 impacts, reinstated both teams for 2023–24, with the men returning to their previous home of Atlantic Hockey.\nAs of the upcoming 2023–24 season, the conferences are:\nThe CCHA, the revival of a league that had operated from 1971 to 2013 before folding in the aftermath of major conference realignment, initially consisted of seven schools that had previously competed in the Western Collegiate Hockey Association. These schools had announced in late 2019 that they would leave the WCHA after the 2020–21 season, and subsequently announced that they would operate as a new CCHA. In July 2020, the new CCHA added an eighth member in St. Thomas, a Twin Cities institution that made an unprecedented move from NCAA Division III directly to Division I. Augustana became the ninth member in 2023.\nAs for the WCHA, it folded its men's division. Not only did the aforementioned group of seven schools leave to form the revived CCHA, but an eighth men's member, Alaska Anchorage, had announced it would drop hockey (plus two other sports) after the 2020–21 school year. Still another men's member, Alabama–Huntsville (UAH), had also filed papers to leave after the 2020–21 season, then dropped the sport entirely due to fallout from COVID-19, but soon reinstated the sport following a successful fundraising drive led by UAH hockey alumni. This reprieve proved temporary, as the school and its hockey supporters agreed that the continuation of the sport beyond 2020–21 would be contingent on finding a new conference home; when no conference move materialized, the hockey program was dropped again (although UAH officially called the move a \"suspension\"). The other remaining WCHA men's member was Alaska, representing the Fairbanks campus of the University of Alaska; it chose to continue play as a D-I independent.\nThe Ivy League recognizes ice hockey champions for both sexes, but it does not sponsor the sport; it instead uses the results of regular-season ECAC Hockey matches involving two Ivy League schools to extrapolate an Ivy champion (all six Ivy League schools that sponsor varsity hockey do so for both men and women, and compete in the ECAC). The Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference sponsored D-I men's hockey, but dropped the sport in 2003.\nThe most recent additions to D-I men's ice hockey are the aforementioned Augustana and Robert Morris. The 2022–23 season saw Alaska Anchorage resume D-I play after a successful fundraising drive. \nIn May 2021, Tennessee State University announced that it was conducting a feasibility study on the possible addition of varsity men's and women's hockey teams. Should TSU add either team, it would become the first historically black university to field a varsity hockey team. The study was partially backed by the NHL and the Nashville Predators, located in TSU's home city. TSU announced in June 2023 that it would start a men's hockey program at club level in 2024–25, with women's hockey to be added at an indeterminate future time. While hockey will initially play at club level, it will be overseen by the TSU athletic department. TSU plans to eventually upgrade its men's and women's teams to NCAA play.\nThe Hobey Baker Memorial Award honors the top player in men's Division I hockey. The Mike Richter Award honors the top goaltender in Division I.\nDivision II.\nThe NCAA does not currently sponsor a championship in NCAA Division II, as there is only one conference that currently sponsors hockey, the Northeast-10 Conference. The NCAA conducted a Division II national championship from 1978 to 1984 and also from 1993 to 1999.\nDivision III.\nThe 84 programs in Division III hockey are part of nine conferences:\nThe Middle Atlantic Conference officially sponsors men's and women's ice hockey, but does not hold a conference tournament. Instead, in a relationship similar to that between the Ivy League and ECAC Hockey, all MAC hockey schools are members of the UCHC, and the MAC uses regular-season results of games between MAC members to extrapolate a MAC champion. MAC members compete for the UCHC's automatic NCAA tournament berth.\nThe NCAA has conducted a Division III national championship since 1984. The current championship format is a 12-team (formerly 11-team), single-elimination bracket.\nWomen.\nThere are 108 colleges and universities that sponsor women's ice hockey in two divisions: National Collegiate and Division III.\nNational Collegiate.\nAs of the upcoming 2023–24 season, 44 teams compete in the National Collegiate division (commonly referred to as Division I). All of them play in one of five conferences:\nThe WCHA remains in operation as a women's league despite the demise of the conference's men's side.\nThe National Collegiate championship is an 8-team, single-elimination tournament to determine the national champion.\nThe Patty Kazmaier Memorial Award is awarded annually by USA Hockey to the top player in women's Division I hockey.\nThe most recent school to start National Collegiate play is Assumption, which begins varsity play in 2023–24 as the newest member of the NEWHA, having joined for administrative purposes a year earlier. Also, as noted previously, Tennessee State has plans to add women's hockey, although it did not set a timeline.\nRobert Morris resumed National Collegiate play in 2023–24, returning to CHA after having dropped men's and women's hockey following the 2020–21 season.\nThe newest National Collegiate conference is the NEWHA, formed in 2017 as a scheduling alliance between the then-current National Collegiate independents. It formally organized as a conference in 2018 and received NCAA recognition in 2019.\nDivision III.\nThere are 67 teams in Division III in eight conferences:\nAs noted previously, the Middle Atlantic Conference sponsors women's ice hockey, but does not hold a conference tournament. All of its hockey members compete for the UCHC's automatic tournament berth, and the MAC champion is extrapolated from regular-season results of games between MAC members.\nThe Division III championship is a 9-team, single-elimination tournament to determine the national champion.\nU Sports.\nUniversity hockey teams in Canada compete in leagues as part of U Sports, the national governing body for Canadian university athletics (in Canadian English, the term \"college\" is reserved for schools that would be called \"junior\", \"community\", or \"technical\" colleges in the U.S.). U Sports sponsors both men's and women's hockey.\nLike in the United States, teams compete in athletic conferences based on geographical locations of the schools. Unlike the NCAA, U Sports does not award players with athletic scholarships, resulting in a lack of divisional separation such as found between NCAA divisions. Individual conferences hold postseason tournaments, followed by the round-robin U Sports championship tournament in late March.\nNAIA.\nIn 2015, a group of member schools in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) began working to add the sport to the organization. The NAIA originally sponsored a men's ice hockey championship from 1968 to 1984 when it was discontinued due to many of the schools with teams leaving the NAIA for the NCAA. A few NAIA schools continued to sponsor the sport as varsity-club teams in the ACHA. A growing number of schools have added ice hockey as members of the ACHA over the past 5–10 years. In 2016, several NAIA institutions that sponsor men's ice hockey teams announced the formation of a coaches association and a new division for NAIA ice hockey program to begin play during the 2017–18 season. In 2017, The Wolverine-Hoosier Athletic Conference (WHAC) became the first current conference in the NAIA to offer the sport and host a conference championship.\nACHA.\nThe American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA) is the sanctioning body for non-NCAA or \"club\" ice hockey in the United States. The organization provides structure, regulations and promotes the quality of collegiate ice hockey.\nTeams separated into three men's and two women's divisions with over 300 teams from across the United States. The recruiting process, rules and regulations, and player eligibility standards parallel that of NCAA Division III. Sometimes, ACHA and NCAA will play games against each other to complete each of their season schedules.\nLongest-running annual international rivalry.\nA rivalry between the United States Military Academy (Army) Black Knights and the Royal Military College of Canada (RMC) Paladins resulted in an annual West Point Weekend hockey game. The series was first played in 1923, and was claimed to be the longest-running annual international sporting event in the world. Army and RMC played continuously from 1949 until 2007, when scheduling conflicts forced the academies to abandon the scheduled game. The game was not played from 2007-2010, nor in 2012, but has been held annually since. The most recent edition in 2020 saw RMC defeat West Point 3-2 in overtime, RMC's first win in the series since 2002.\nEuropean collegiate league.\nIn Europe, the first college hockey league called EUHL was founded in 2013.\nIn the United Kingdom, college hockey league is operated by BUIHA (British Universities Ice Hockey Association). It was founded in 2003 and currently includes 23 clubs across the UK.\nProfessional hockey.\nFor much of its history, college teams produced very few, if any, athletes that would play professionally. While there were several reasons for this, two primary causes established that trend. College teams were made up mostly by American player and professional teams preferred to use Canadians. Additionally, and because of that reason, the level of competition for college hockey was not viewed favorably. The perception of college hockey was so bad at one point that Red Berenson was told:\n“If you go to an American college, you’ll never become a pro.” \nWhile Berenson managed to defy those predictions, most players of his era did not. It wasn't until the NHL began expanding in 1967 that many alumni would even be looked at as potential professionals.\nOver time, as many college players demonstrated that they could compete on the same level as their contemporaries from the Canadian junior leagues, The number of players able to continue their careers after graduating increased. Throughout the 80's and 90's colleges became a more acceptable pathway for potential NHLers and the effects having high-caliber talents on college rosters caused a change in the style of play. By the 21st Century, was mirroring the NHL in its defensive schemes and had become one of the producers of professional players."

        "text": "The Singapore national rugby union team has yet to make its debut at the Rugby World Cup, though since the 1995 Rugby World Cup, Singapore have been participating in qualification competitions.\nHistory.\nThe Singapore Cricket Club is said to have been one of the first rugby clubs in Singapore when employees from the British East India Company brought the game to Singapore. For many years in the 1800s and early 1900s the Singapore team that played against other Malayan states was made up of expatriates who were working in Singapore and army servicemen based in Singapore at the time. With such a large core of servicemen making the \"national team\" of the time, a Singapore \"Civilians XV\" also played many games representing the island state.\nUp to the 1960s, this representation of Singapore Civilians made up the national team that competed in the annual Malaya Cup that hosted states from around Malaya (now Malaysia). This was the forerunner to the modern day Agong Cup that is currently organised by the Malaysian Rugby Union. This side was made up predominantly of expatriates from the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand.\n1971 saw the birth of the Under-23 national team when it played against Malaysia in the Anchor Cup curtain raiser match to the England game. The Under-23 team was made up of all national local boys from the Armed forces, Police force, local clubs and schools. In 1972 the SRU under the presidency of ASP Niaz Mohd Shah from the Police Force decided to brave the challenge and form the new all citizens local national rugby team. The Singapore national team participated in the 3rd ARFUT (Asian Rugby Football Union Tournament) in Hong Kong and emerged a credible 4th position. Leow Kim Liat was the captain for the 1972 team, and became the first Asian to ever captain a Singapore representative side, and the first National Captain.\nIn 1975, Singapore participated in SEAP (South East Asian Peninsular Games) held in Bangkok. However, Singapore lost to both Thailand and Malaysia and emerged 3rd with a bronze medal. In 1977 Singapore took part in the SEA Games held in Malaysia. Singapore bettered their 1975 performance by winning the silver medal after beating hosts Malaysia, but losing to Thailand in a rain sodden finals match.\nIn 1978, Singapore Rugby achieved its best ever performance in history under coach Natahar Bava. The team won its first Malaysian Rugby Union (MRU) Cup after 44 years of participation. The Singapore team beat the RNZIR (Royal New Zealand Infantry Battalion) in the semi-finals. They beat the RMAF Blackhawks in the final. Later that same year Singapore took part in the 6th Asian Rugby tournament held in Kuala Lumpur. They emerged with their best ever result to this day with a third-place finishing behind Japan and South Korea when they beat Thailand in a 16-15 third placing game.\nFor their efforts and achievements, Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC) awarded Singapore Rugby with the Sportsman of the Year 1978 award to Song Koon Poh, Coach of the year to Natahar Bava and the entire 1978 national team as Singapore's Sports Team of the year. The Singapore team went on to repeat another MRU Cup win under coach Natahar Bava in 1982, beating the Singapore-based Kiwis RNZIR Battalion in the finals.\nSingapore also excelled in rugby sevens game during this period. The team under Natahar Bava achieved their best ever 7s game results during 1978, 1979 and 1980 in the HK 7s tournament. Singapore's best ever rugby 7s results were in the 1978 Plate Finals where they lost to Bahrain 0-10 and in 1979 when they qualified for the top 8 teams Cup quarter finals losing out eventually to Western Samoa 4-16. In 1980 again Singapore lost in the Plate Finals to Japan by 0-40 in a flooded rain sodden game.\nRugby World Cup Qualifiers.\nSingapore first tried to qualify for a World Cup for the 1995 tournament in South Africa, taking part in the Asia qualifiers. Singapore played out of Group B in Round 1, though they lost their three fixtures and did not advance to Round 2. Singapore attempted to qualify for the 1999 Rugby World Cup in Wales also; playing in Round 1 of Asia, but losing both of their fixtures against Sri Lanka and Thailand.\nSingapore finished second in the final standings of Pool A of Round 1 in attempting to qualify for the 2003 Rugby World Cup in Australia, and did not advance to Round 2. They finished second in their group in qualification for the 2007 Rugby World Cup in France as well, losing one match and winning one.\nMakeup of the National Team.\nThe current makeup of the National Team sees a mix of local born and bred Singaporean players and expatriates who fulfil World Rugby eligibility rules. The entirety of the team is based in Singapore, and are selected from all the Premiership clubs that play in the top division of the local league organised by the Singapore Rugby Union. While there has been past selection debates on an over reliance of expatriate players, the local development programme (National Rugby Academy) has seen success only at age group levels and hence see more local players through the ranks. Regrettably whilst development of the game has been successful at the schools level &amp; in organizing international games &amp; tournaments events here in Singapore in conjunction with the Tourism Board, we do not see the local rugby lads progressing strongly as an all citizens national rugby team as once evident back in the 1980s.\nAsian 5 Nations Competition.\nSingapore have been competitors in the Asian 5 Nations competition since the inaugural 2008 tournament. In 2009 they competed in the premier division of the series. They kept the tournament winners Japan to a 30-point deficit, the smallest of any of Japan's games."

        "title": "Beach handball",
        "text": "Beach handball is a team sport where two teams pass and bounce or roll a ball, trying to throw it in the goal of the opposing team. The game is similar to standard handball, but it is played on sand instead of on a solid floor. Because the ball loses most of its bounce on sand, there is little to no dribbling, and players instead perform more passing as the rules of travelling still apply.\nDescription.\nMatches are played as two 10 minute sets, with a half-time of 5 minutes. If teams are tied at the end of a regular set then the teams play for a golden goal. If the teams are tied at the end of 2 sets then the teams will participate in a tie breaker. The tie break involves a goalie throwing the ball to their own player while that player attempts to score one-on-one with the opposing goalie. During regular play, if the goalkeeper scores a goal this counts as two points, compared to a normal goal scored by an outfield player which counts as 1 point. Creative or spectacular goals, such as 360 degree jumps and alley-oops, are awarded with two points, as well as in-flights and 6 meter throws.\nThe first European Championships was played in the year 2000.\n, Brazil is ranked the number 1 country in the world, and is the winner of the world championship in both men's and women's divisions at the 2014 Beach Handball World Championships.\nAttire.\nIn 2021, the Norwegian women's team were fined €1500 for being improperly dressed after the women wore bike-shorts instead of bikini bottoms at a European championship match in Bulgaria. Critics derided the fine and the underlying rule. Although the Norwegian Handball Federation announced they would pay the fines, pop singer Pink offered to pay for them. In November 2021, the International Handball Federation changed their dress rules to closely match the shorts that the Norwegian team were fined for wearing."

        "text": "David Jonathan Booth (born November 24, 1984) is an American professional ice hockey forward.\nFollowing his second year with the Michigan State Spartans, he was selected 53rd overall by the Florida Panthers in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft. He spent four years playing college hockey before turning professional with the Panthers organization in 2006–07. After recording career-highs in goals, assists and points, as well as being voted the Panthers' most valuable player by the team's fans in 2008–09, he suffered two concussions the following season. Midway through his sixth year in the league, Booth was traded to the Vancouver Canucks in a four-player deal.\nKnown as an offensive forward and a fast skater, Booth has reached the 30-goal plateau once in his NHL career. Representing the United States in international competition, he has won gold medals at the 2002 IIHF World U18 and 2004 IIHF World U20 Championships. He has also competed in the 2008 IIHF World Championship.\nPlaying career.\nAmateur career.\nAfter playing minor hockey with the Fraser Falcons, then the Detroit Honeybaked of the Midwest Elite Hockey League, Booth moved on to the Junior A level with the Detroit Compuware Ambassadors of the North American Hockey League (NAHL). He recorded 30 points (17 goals and 13 assists) over 42 games in 2000–01, earning him NAHL All-Rookie Team and Rookie of the Year honors. The following season, he joined the United States National Team Development Program and competed for their junior and under-18 teams in the United States Hockey League (USHL) and NAHL, respectively.\nDuring his time with the Development Program, he committed to an athletic scholarship with the Michigan State Spartans of the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA). Joining the Spartans in 2002–03, he recorded 36 points (17 goals and 19 assists) over 39 games, ranking fourth in team scoring and 13th in the CCHA overall. His freshman year included two CCHA Rookie of the Week distinctions and a hat-trick, recorded on January 10, 2003, in a 5–2 win against the Alaska Nanooks. His efforts as a freshman earned him Spartans Rookie of the Year and CCHA All-Rookie Team honors. Although Booth was eligible for the 2003 NHL Entry Draft, National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) rules stipulated that players under the age of 19 could not opt into the draft without foregoing their college eligibility.\nEarly the following season, Booth sustained a knee injury that forced him out of the lineup for several games. He finished his sophomore year with 18 points (eight goals and ten assists) over 30 contests. Despite his decreased offensive production, he remained highly ranked by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau (CSB) at the end of the season for the upcoming 2004 NHL Entry Draft. He was listed at 27th among skaters playing in North America by the CSB, while \"The Hockey News\" ranked him 33rd overall. During the draft, Booth was selected in the second round, 53rd overall, by the Florida Panthers. He was scouted as a player with size and toughness, while a \"USA Today\" article declared that he \"would have gone much higher if he opted into the draft [the previous] season.\"\nFollowing his draft, Booth returned to Michigan State to complete his four-year tenure with the school. During his junior year, he and teammate Bryan Lerg set a Spartans record for the fastest two goals scored in a game (five seconds apart). Their goals came in a 6–5 overtime loss to the Alaska Nanooks in February 2005 and surpassed the previous record by one second. Later that month, Booth sustained a cracked rib and was sidelined for several games. He finished the 2004–05 season with 16 points (seven goals and nine assists) over 29 contests.\nIn the first month of his senior year, Booth played in his 100th career college game in a contest against the North Dakota Fighting Sioux on October 16, 2005. He recorded a short handed goal in a 3–0 win. Booth later missed some playing time due to injury before returning to the lineup in late-November 2005. After struggling to score in the first half of the 2005–06 season (he recorded nine points in the first three months), Booth finished with 35 points (13 goals and 22 assists) over 37 games. His strong offensive production in the second half included an 11-game point-scoring streak that was broken on the last regular season game against the Miami RedHawks. In the 2006 CCHA playoffs, Booth helped the Spartans to a Mason Cup as league champions. Facing the Miami RedHawks in the final, Booth scored the game-winning goal six minutes in the second period, securing a 2–1 win for Michigan State. Moving on to the 2006 NCAA Tournament, they were eliminated in the regional final by the Maine Black Bears 5–4. Booth scored a goal and an assist in the losing effort. Over four years with the Spartans, Booth finished his college career with 105 points in 134 games.\nFlorida Panthers (2006–2011).\nOn July 20, 2006, Booth signed with the Panthers. Joining the organization, he was assigned to the Panthers' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Rochester Americans, to start the 2006–07 season. Within two months, he was called up to the Panthers on November 20. Making his NHL debut that night against the Boston Bruins, he registered 11-and-a-half minutes of ice time in a 3–2 win. After being returned to the AHL six days later, he received another call-up the following month. During his second stint with the team, he recorded his first NHL point on December 12 against the Anaheim Ducks. Booth drew the first assist on the game's first goal by Drew Larman; the Panthers went on to lose 5–4. Sent back down to Rochester and recalled one more time in December, he remained with the team for the remainder of the campaign. Booth later scored his first NHL goal on January 4, 2007, against Jamie McLennan in a 5–4 overtime loss to the Calgary Flames. In the final month of the season, he registered his first game-winning goal in the NHL on April 6 in a 7–2 win against the Tampa Bay Lightning. Booth completed his rookie season with 10 points (3 goals and 7 assists) over 48 NHL games, while also recording 14 points (seven goals and seven assists) over 25 AHL games. As the Panthers failed to qualify for the 2007 playoffs, ranking 12th in the Eastern Conference, Booth was returned to the AHL for the Americans' post-season. He recorded two assists over six playoff games as Rochester was eliminated in the first round by the Hamilton Bulldogs.\nEarly in the 2007–08 season, Booth was injured after receiving a check from behind during a game against the Ottawa Senators on October 20, 2007. While playing the puck, he collided with Senators defenceman Anton Volchenkov, causing his head to hit the boards. Volchenkov received a five-minute major penalty and a game misconduct on the play, while Booth was taken off the ice in a stretcher. He was brought to an Ottawa hospital for precautionary measures and returned home the same night with a sore neck. While a suspension for Volchenkov was suggested in the media following the game, the league chose not to hold a hearing regarding the incident. Senators head coach John Paddock was quick to dismiss the notion of a suspension, asserting that Booth turned into Volchenkov, as opposed to the Senators defenceman forcefully initiating contact. Booth missed one game due to the injury. Later in the campaign, he missed eight games with a knee injury. Missing nine games total, he recorded 40 points (22 goals and 18 assists) over 73 contests, ranking fourth in team scoring. Becoming an integral part of the Panthers' lineup, he also led the team with six game-winning goals. As a team, the Panthers remained out of the playoffs in 2008, finishing 11th in the East.\nThe following season, Booth recorded his first career NHL natural hat trick against the Anaheim Ducks on November 9, 2008. He scored all the Panthers goals against Jean-Sébastien Giguère in a 3–1 win over the Anaheim Ducks. The following month, he sustained a left shoulder injury that sidelined him for eight games. After returning, he began an eight-game point-scoring streak that lasted from December 27, 2008, to January 10, 2009. Later in the season, he recorded another hat trick in a contest against the St. Louis Blues on March 7, 2009. Scoring all three goals against Chris Mason, Booth helped the Panthers to a 5–3 win. His efforts made him the fourth player in team history to register two hat-tricks in one season, after Pavel Bure, Ray Sheppard and Olli Jokinen. He also added an assist for a four-point game. Booth bettered that single-game total during the last contest of the regular season, scoring two goals and three assists for a personal best five-point effort in a 7–4 win against the Washington Capitals on April 11, 2009. Booth finished the season with career-highs of 31 goals, 29 assists and 60 points over 72 games. While leading the Panthers in goals, powerplay goals (11), game-winning goals (5); tied with Nathan Horton, and shots (246), he finished one point behind team-leader Stephen Weiss (who played six more games than Booth). Booth's efforts helped the Panthers compete for a playoff spot late in the season for the first time in his tenure with the club. They finished the season tied for the eighth and final playoff spot in the East with the Montreal Canadiens at 41 wins and 93 points each. The Canadiens earned the spot over the Panthers by virtue of having won the season series between the two teams.\nDuring his breakout season, Booth became a favorite among team followers; home fans at BankAtlantic Center were known to cheer \"Booooth\" when he touched the puck during games. At the end of the campaign, he was chosen by the fans as the team's most valuable player in an official online vote. Set to become a restricted free agent in the off-season, Booth was tendered a qualifying offer by the Panthers on June 29, 2009. Two days later, he signed a six-year, US$25.5 million contract. Upon announcing the contract, Panthers General Manager Randy Sexton heralded Booth as \"undoubtedly an important part of [the] club's future...[and] a role model for other players,\" while embodying \"every attribute of what a true Panthers player stands for.\"\nDuring the first month of the 2009–10 season, Booth sustained a concussion after being hit by Philadelphia Flyers forward Mike Richards during a game on October 24, 2009. Skating up to the Flyers' blueline, Booth had shot the puck into the offensive zone when Richards hit him in the head with his shoulder. Rendered unconscious, Booth was taken off the ice on a stretcher and brought to a Philadelphia hospital. In addition to his concussion, he sustained a cut above one eye that required stitches; he was released from hospital the next day. While Richards received a five-minute major penalty for interference and a game misconduct for intent to injure, he was not suspended for the play. The decision not to further penalize Richards proved to be a highly contentious issue. Panthers General Manager Randy Sexton and defenceman Keith Ballard voiced their opinion that Richards' hit was directed at the head while knowing Booth was in a vulnerable position, warranting a suspension. The Flyers captain expressed concern for Booth's health both in the media and to Panthers Head Coach Peter DeBoer personally, but asserted that he was not intending to hurt him. Another concern was the timing of Richards' hit, as Booth had already released the puck. In response, NHL Vice President Bill Daly explained that the hit was not late enough to justify a suspension.\nBooth was not cleared for full-contact practice with the team until January 25, 2010. Six days later, he returned to the lineup for a game against the New York Islanders after being sidelined for 45 contests. During his absence, the Panthers and Flyers played each other on December 21, 2009, for the first time since Richards' hit. The game included four fights, including one between Panthers defenceman and captain Bryan McCabe and Richards. The teams met again with Booth in the lineup on March 3, 2010. After fighting Richards in the first period (one of four fights in the game and Booth's first in the NHL), Booth scored a goal and three assists (completing a Gordie Howe hat trick) to help the Panthers to a 7–4 win.\nAlthough the NHL had not suspended Richards for his actions against Booth, the incident was instrumental in the League's newfound efforts to eliminate hits to the head, particularly against players who cannot see the oncoming checker approaching (as was the case with Booth). Several months after Booth's October 2009 concussion, Boston Bruins forward Marc Savard was hit by Matt Cooke in a similar fashion on March 7. Later that month, on March 25, the NHL Board of Governors and NHL Players' Association's executive board voted in favour of a rule penalizing \"blindside hits\" (bodychecking a player after having skated laterally towards him undetected, an idea similar to one's \"blind spot\" while driving). That same night, Booth suffered his second concussion in five months during a game against the Montreal Canadiens. While reaching back to retrieve a loose puck, Booth was hit in the head by opposing defenceman Jaroslav Špaček's shoulder. No penalty was called on the play, while Booth was helped off the ice and taken to hospital. The hit did not receive suspension and did not spark controversy as Booth's previous concussion had. Following the game, Panthers forward Nathan Horton asserted that \"It wasn't a dirty hit\"; Špaček expressed concern for Booth, but explained that \"when he turned I was standing right there and basically he just ran at me.\" Sidelined for the remaining nine games of the season, Booth finished the campaign with 16 points (eight goals and eight assists) over 28 games. After pushing for a playoff spot the previous season, the Panthers ranked second-worst in the East with 32 wins and 77 points.\nWhile Booth's hockey-playing future was initially in doubt following his second concussion, he returned for the 2010–11 season and played all 82 games. Averaging 19 minutes of ice time per game (second among forward behind Weiss), he led the Panthers with 23 goals while ranking third with 40 points (behind Weiss and Mike Santorelli). With 280 shots, including a 14-shot effort against the Bruins on November 18, 2010, he led all Panthers' players and ranked 12th in the NHL overall. As a team, the Panthers continued to struggle and General Manager Dale Tallon began trading away many of their veteran players towards the end of the season; they finished with the worst record in the East.\nVancouver Canucks (2011–2014).\nLess than a month into the 2011–12 season, Booth was traded to the Vancouver Canucks on October 22, 2011. The Panthers sent him, along with forward Steven Reinprecht and a third-round pick in the 2013 draft, to Vancouver in exchange for forwards Mikael Samuelsson and Marco Sturm. Tallon described the deal as a performance-based trade; Booth had registered one assist over the first six games of the season and had a team-worst –6 plus-minus rating while being demoted to the third line. Booth was saddened and admittedly surprised at the trade. Booth had also been reportedly sought after by Vancouver for six months prior; the team conferred with alternate captain Ryan Kesler regarding Booth's character on and off the ice (the two grew up playing minor and junior hockey together). Joining Vancouver, he switched his jersey number from 10 to 7, in honor of his younger sister, Rachael, who also wears the number as a hockey player.\nPlaying on the second line with countrymen Ryan Kesler and Chris Higgins, Booth formed a component of a scoring unit was nicknamed the \"American Express\" line. The unit had been occasionally shuffled, however, with Cody Hodgson replacing Higgins in some instances. Booth scored his first goal as a Canuck 15 days after the trade, opening the scoring in a 6–2 win against the Chicago Blackhawks. The following month, Booth suffered a right medial collateral ligament (MCL) injury after a knee-on-knee hit from Colorado Avalanche forward Kevin Porter during a game on December 6, 2011. Porter received a five-minute major and game misconduct for the play, while a subsequent hearing with NHL disciplinarian Brendan Shanahan resulted in a four-game suspension. Booth was sidelined for 18 games over six weeks with the injury, returning in mid-January 2012.\nBooth finished the regular season with 16 goals, 14 goals and 30 points in 62 games to help the Canucks win a second consecutive Presidents' Trophy awarded to the best regular season team. Having never qualified for the playoffs with the Panthers previously in his career, Booth made his post-season debut inin the first game of the first round of the 2012 playoffs on April 11, 2012 against the Los Angeles Kings. He recorded one assist over five games as the first-seeded and back-to-back Presidents' Trophy-winning Canucks were eliminated in the first round by the eighth seeded and eventual Stanley Cup champion Kings. Booth told reporters prior to the playoffs that he was struggling with his diminished role with the Canucks, in comparison to his time with the Panthers, alluding to his ice time. The previous year while still with the Panthers, he was averaging nearly 19 minutes per game, which dropped to 15 minutes as a Canuck.\nIn subsequent seasons with the Canucks, Booth continued to struggle. His production dropped steeply, and he suffered several injuries during the lockout-shortened 2012–13 season, scoring a total of three points. Scoring a total of nine goals and 19 points in the following season, he had gone 32 games without a goal, but managed to score three in the final ten games of the season.\nOn June 17, 2014, the Canucks placed Booth on unconditional waivers, and the following day after he cleared waivers the Canucks used their final compliance buyout on him and Booth became an unrestricted free agent.\nLater NHL years and KHL.\nOn July 22, 2014, the Toronto Maple Leafs signed Booth to a one-year contract worth $1.1 million. He scored the only shootout goal in the first preseason game on September 22, 2014, which led the Toronto Maple Leafs to victory. Booth would break his foot shortly afterwards and miss the opening few months of the season.\nOn November 21, 2014, Booth was sent down to the Toronto Marlies of the AHL for a conditioning stint. He would finish with one goal in his two-game tour with the Marlies. On November 29, Booth played his first game as a Maple Leaf in a 6–2 win over the Washington Capitals. Booth recorded no points but enjoyed his first game in Toronto. However, Booth would record his first point as a Leaf three games later, an assist on a goal scored by line-mate Richard Pánik in a 5–2 victory over his former team, the Canucks. His first goal as a Maple Leaf would come on December 16, where he scored the game winner in a 6–2 victory over the Anaheim Ducks. Booth would finish the season with 13 points (7 goals, 6 assists) in 59 games.\nAs a free agent over the following summer, Booth agreed to a return to the Florida Panthers in accepting an invitation to training camp on a professional try-out contract on September 9, 2015. At the conclusion of camp and approaching pre-season, Booth was released by the Panthers. On November 26, 2015, Booth belatedly signed his first contract abroad, agreeing to a one-year deal with Russian club, Admiral Vladivostok of the Kontinental Hockey League for the remainder of the 2015–16 season. In 23 games with Admiral, Booth contributed with 6 goals and 16 points.\nBooth returned home during the off-season and signed a professional try-out contract to attend the training camp of the Anaheim Ducks on September 20, 2016. After his release from the Ducks pre-season roster, Booth later opted to return to the KHL, continuing with Avangard Omsk on November 17, 2016.\nAfter two years in the KHL, Booth signed a PTO with the Detroit Red Wings on August 30, 2017, marking his third attempt to return to the NHL. On October 2, 2017, Booth made the team and signed a one-year, two way contract with the Red Wings. Booth played sparingly with the Red Wings, recording four goals and one assist while playing in just 28 games.\nAfter his short tenure with the Red Wings, Booth indirectly announced his retirement from hockey, stating that he was \"done with hockey\" via his Twitter account. As a free agent at the mid-point of the 2018–19 season, Booth returned to continue his professional career abroad, agreeing to a contract for the remainder of the year with Belarusian outfit, HC Dinamo Minsk of the KHL, on December 5, 2018.\nInternational play.\nDuring his tenure with the United States National Team Development Program, Booth competed at the 2002 IIHF World U18 Championship, held in Trnava and Piešťany, Slovakia. Playing Russia in the last game of the final round, Booth scored the United States' first two goals of the game. A win against Russia placed the United States in a tie for the gold medal with four wins and one tie each. In order to beat Russia on the goal-differential tiebreaker, they needed to win the contest by two goals. Leading 2–1 with a minute remaining, the United States pulled their goalie and Zach Parise scored with 30 seconds left to capture the gold medal. Booth was named MVP of the gold medal game. Booth finished the tournament with two goals and two assists over eight games.\nTwo years later (now a member of the Michigan State Spartans), Booth moved on to the under-20 level, competing at the 2004 IIHF World Junior Championships, held in Helsinki and Hämeenlinna, Finland. He recorded his lone assist of the tournament on Dan Fritsche's game-winning goal in the semifinal against Finland. Booth and the United States went on to win the gold medal with a 4–3 win over Canada in the final. With a goal and an assist over six games, Booth tied for 12th in team point-scoring. In a 2011 interview for Canucks.com, Booth recalled his IIHF U18 and U20 gold medals as his first- and second-best hockey memories, respectively.\nFollowing Booth's second season in the NHL with the Florida Panthers, he was named to his first United States men's team for the 2008 IIHF World Championships, held in Halifax and Quebec City, Canada. He scored his lone goal of the tournament (also his first international goal and point at the men's level) in a 5–1 preliminary round win against Slovakia. In the quarterfinals, the United States lost 3–2 to Finland and finished the tournament in sixth place.\nThe following year, he was invited to the national team's summer orientation camp in anticipation of the 2010 Winter Olympics. Booth later recalled that making the Olympic team was his goal at the start of the 2009–10 season. During the first month of NHL play, however, Booth suffered a concussion and was sidelined long-term. When the final Olympic roster was announced on January 1, 2010, Booth was still recovering from the injury and he was not selected.\nPlaying style.\nAt 6 feet (1.83 metres) and 212 pounds (96 kilograms), Booth's size enables him to play in the style of a power forward. Along with his physical stature, he is a fast skater, both of which allow him to retain the puck and contribute to his offensive skills.\nPersonal life.\nBooth was born in Detroit, Michigan, and grew up in nearby Washington Township in Macomb County. His father's name is Mike. Booth has two brothers and one sister, Rachael. During Booth's career with the Panthers, he lived with his younger brother in Florida. Raised in a Christian household, Booth has publicly professed his faith during his professional career. Growing up, he was a fan of the Detroit Red Wings and attended home games as his family owned season tickets. He has listed favorite players as a child as Red Wings forwards Steve Yzerman and Brendan Shanahan, as well as Keith Tkachuk, who played for the Winnipeg Jets/Phoenix Coyotes franchise, St. Louis Blues and Atlanta Thrashers.\nDuring Booth's minor hockey career, he was linemates with fellow Michigan native Ryan Kesler for two years, beginning at age 12. They played together in the 1998 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with the Detroit Honeybaked minor ice hockey team. The two went on to become teammates with the US National Team Development Program, the U.S. national junior team and the Vancouver Canucks. In addition to hockey, he also played baseball and golf growing up.\nBooth earned his secondary education at Lutheran High School North in Macomb and Huron High School in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He moved to and graduated from the latter to facilitate his participation with the US National Team Development Program, which was based out of Ann Arbor. During his tenure with the Development Program, he made the choice to play NCAA hockey, opting against the major junior Ontario Hockey League (OHL) in order to attend college. The decision was encouraged by his father, who valued Booth's education. Enrolled at Michigan State University while playing for the school's hockey team, he studied dentistry before switching to general management.\nBooth married model and former beauty queen from Tennessee, Ashley Durham, in June 2014. Their relationship was featured on the second season of the Canadian reality series \"Hockey Wives\".\nControversy.\nAn avid hunter, Booth posted a YouTube video in May 2012 of him baiting and killing an American black bear. Though the practice is legal in Alberta, it is banned in 18 American states, as well as British Columbia, the Vancouver Canucks' province. Booth's actions were widely criticized among the public, causing him to remove the video within days."

It was scheduled to be played for the first time on October 22–28, 2007, which would have made it the first PGA Tour event staged in central California since 1964.\nThe tournament was to be staged at Running Horse Golf &amp; Country Club, a residential golf development in Fresno, California with a course co-designed by Jack Nicklaus and his son Jack Nicklaus II, which was under construction when the tournament was announced. However, in November 2006 it was reported that foreclosure proceedings on Running Horse had begun. The City of Fresno hoped that a buyer could be found and the tournament would go ahead. The PGA Tour also remained optimistic, and the tournament director stated that the tournament could be played at Running Horse if the course was seeded by March 2007. However a move to a new venue, which would entail a change of name, had not been ruled out.\nBy early June 2007 there was no real doubt that the tournament would not take place at Running Horse in 2007, and on June 14 the PGA Tour announced it had been removed from the schedule. PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem stated, \"Our intention... is for Fresno to be a part of the schedule again in 2008 and beyond.\" \nA new tournament called the Ginn sur Mer Classic at Tesoro took the Running Horse slot in 2007 and 2008, after which it was also cancelled.\nIndictment.\nIn August 2010, a former Carmel real estate broker, Thomas O'Meara, was arrested by the FBI and arraigned in federal court.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1972 to 1980, and won three World Series championships as a member of the Oakland Athletics.\nOakland A's.\nHamilton was drafted out of Edmonds High School in Edmonds, Washington by the Kansas City Athletics in the fifth round of the 1966 Major League Baseball draft. He spent six seasons in their farm system before receiving a call up to the Oakland Athletics in May of . He won his major league debut on May 29, starting the second game of a doubleheader with the Texas Rangers.\nHe ended the season at 6–6 with a 2.93 earned run average as the A's headed to the 1972 American League Championship Series against the Detroit Tigers. Hamilton made only one appearance in the ALCS, blowing a save opportunity in game four. He appeared twice in the World Series against the Cincinnati Reds. He faced just one batter, Joe Morgan in game five, and got a double play on a fly ball to Matty Alou in right field in which Pete Rose tried to score from third. In game six, the \"Big Red Machine\" tagged Hamilton for four runs in just two-thirds of an inning.\nThe A's returned to the World Series again in and , but Hamilton never made a post-season appearance either year. He was traded along with Chet Lemon from the Athletics to the Chicago White Sox for Stan Bahnsen and Skip Pitlock at the non-waiver trade deadline on June 15, .\nChicago White Sox.\nThough Hamilton had been used as both a starter and reliever in Oakland, he was used strictly out of the bullpen by White Sox manager, Chuck Tanner. He earned his first major league save on June 25, and went on to earn 25 in three seasons with the club. On November 28, , he and Silvio Martinez were sent to the St. Louis Cardinals to complete an August 31 deal in which the Chisox sent two players to be named later to the Cards for Clay Carroll.\nSt. Louis Cardinals.\nHamilton got off to a poor start with the Cardinals, and soon found himself doing mop-up duty for manager Vern Rapp. When Ken Boyer replaced Rapp at the helm, Hamilton was given the opportunity to redeem himself, but after blowing a save against the San Diego Padres on back-to-back home runs by Gene Tenace and Rick Sweet, found himself again in the mop-up role. He appeared in thirteen games for the Cardinals, all of which were losses, and was 0–0 with a 6.43 ERA when his contract was sold to the Pittsburgh Pirates.\nPittsburgh Pirates.\nAfter losing his first game as a Pirate, Hamilton earned his first save of the season against the New York Mets shortly afterwards. He began seeing more time in pressure situations, but after failing to perform, found himself again in the now familiar mop-up role. Following the season, he returned to Oakland as a free agent.\nReturn to Oakland.\nHamilton went 3–4 with five saves and a 3.70 ERA for Oakland in 1979. He split between Oakland and the Ogden A's, going 0–3 with an 11.40 ERA at the major league level. After four games with the Pacific Coast League's Tacoma Tigers in , he retired.\nCareer stats.\nHamilton was 4-for-26 in 1972 with five walks and two runs scored. In seven more at-bats (in 1978), he never reached base again.\nPersonal life.\nHe currently lives in California with his wife, Lynn, and has three grown children Jonathan, Brian and Christy as well as his grandchildren, Austin, Matthew, Briley, Cole, Joshua, Ellie, and Jake. He began coaching baseball for California High School in San Ramon in . He is also a project manager for a roofing contractor."

Barry also played for the Boston Olympics of the Eastern Hockey League and the Boston Bruins, and later became the coach at Boston State College. He was inducted into the Northeastern University athletics Hall of Fame in 1976, and the University of Massachusetts Boston Hall of Fame in 2003.\nPlaying career.\nBorn in 1919, Barry learned to play hockey in his hometown of Wellesley, Massachusetts. He played briefly for Northeastern University in Boston, but left school during his freshman year in the winter of 1940 to skate for the Boston Olympics of the Eastern Hockey League from 1941 to 1943, captaining the team in 1941 and 1942.\nFollowing a brief tour of duty in the Coast Guard during World War II era, when he played for the United States Coast Guard Cutters, Barry returned to play for the Boston Bruins for 19 games during the 1946–47 season, making him the first American to play for the Bruins since the 1920s. He rejoined the Olympics for four more seasons before becoming head coach in 1950. During his two seasons as coach, Barry went 63-51-7. Barry was the head coach at Boston State College (now part of UMass Boston) from 1962 to 1982 and guided them to two ECAC Division II Tournaments and two NAIA tournaments. In 1965, BSC went 20–0. He was also a referee for several national collegiate championship games.\nAs a golfer, Barry won 12 club championships at the Charles River Country Club, Newton, the New England Amateur championship, and New England and Massachusetts Senior Amateur titles. He is honored by a bronze plaque in front of the clubhouse. After leaving the Bruins, Barry went into the insurance business and became a partner at Barry and Farrell Insurance Agency in Needham, Massachusetts, where his son and grandchildren now work.

        "text": "The Sussex Senior Cup is an annual association football knockout cup competition for men's football clubs in the English county of Sussex; the winning team is presented with the Sussex Senior Challenge Cup, the county senior cup of the Sussex FA. For sponsorship purposes the trophy is also known as the Sussex Transport Senior Challenge Cup, after a new sponsorship deal was agreed in 2023.\nFirst played for in the 1882–83 season, shortly after the founding of the Sussex County Football Association in September 1882, the first club to hold the cup was Brighton Rangers. Other winning teams in the cup's early history were Burgess Hill, Lancing College and Eastbourne.\nThe team with most title wins in the competition's history is Worthing, but Sussex's sole Premier League team, Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, has been the most successful in recent years. Bognor Regis Town won the competition a record five times in succession between 1980 and 1984.\nThe winning club also qualifies to play in the Sussex FA Community Shield match, traditionally the opening match each season in Sussex football. Worthing is the current holder of the Sussex Senior Challenge Cup, having beaten Bognor 8–7 on penalties in the 2023 final.\nHistory.\nShortly after the Sussex County Football Association was founded in 1882 the inaugural competition of the Sussex Senior Club took place for the 1882–83 season. Brighton Rangers won the final of the first competition 3–0. Founder members of Sussex County FA include the public schools of Lancing College, Brighton College and Ardingly College and their old-boy teams dominated the cup early on, along with clubs such as Burgess Hill and Eastbourne, whose teams were made up of upper and middle class players.\nThe cup was initially contested only by amateur clubs. At the time Sussex's only professional club, Brighton &amp; Hove Albion tried to enter the competition in 1905 but had to withdraw because of clashing dates. Albion won the Sussex Wartime Cup in 1943 but only entered the normal competition in 1946. Albion entered the competition again in 1975-76 following the abolition of the distinction between amateur and professional clubs in the English game.\nFollowing the 1913–14 competition, the cup was suspended due to the First World War, and resumed in 1919–20. During the Second World War the winners of the Sussex Wartime Cup were awarded the Sussex Senior Cup. The Sussex Wartime Cup took place on a league basis and a competition was held in every year during the Second World War except for 1940-41 when no competition for the Sussex Senior Cup was held.\nUnder Jack Pearce, Bognor Regis Town dominated the Sussex Senior Cup in the 1980s, winning the cup six times, including a record five times in succession, and finishing runners-up once.\nFrom 1950 to 1951 the cup final took place at the Goldstone Ground every year until 1995 when Brighton sold their ground to developers. A crowd of over 7,000, the cup's highest attendance in recent years, saw the 2010–11 season final take place at Brighton's new Falmer Stadium on 16 July 2011. It was the first competitive match to be played there. Brighton won the game 2–0 with Gary Hart scoring the first ever goal at the new ground. The cup final has taken place there every year since 2011.\nEligibility.\nThe Sussex Senior Cup is open to all men's senior clubs in the historic county of Sussex that are affiliated to the Sussex County Football Association. In 2016–17 this was 50 clubs that play in the top ten tiers of the English football league system (Premier League, English Football League, National League, National League South, Isthmian League, Southern Combination Football League Premier Division, Southern Combination Football League Division One and Southern Counties East Premier Division).\nCompetition format.\nOverview.\nBeginning in September, the competition proceeds as a knockout tournament throughout its duration, consisting of three rounds, then quarter-finals, semi-finals and final, usually in May. A system of byes ensures that the highest placed 14 clubs in Sussex enter the competition in the second round. For reasons of fairness to other clubs, the Brighton &amp; Hove Albion's and Crawley Town's under-21 teams compete in the Sussex Senior Cup since, as full time professional squads, their first teams play many levels of the football league pyramid ahead of other teams.\nDistribution.\nThe tournament is organised so that 32 clubs remain by the second round. 31 clubs in the Southern Combination League Premier Division and Division One (tiers 9 and 10 of the English football league system) and one club from the Wessex Premier Division (tier 9) enter in the first round. \nIn the first round, Bognor Regis Town, Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, Burgess Hill Town, Chichester City, Crawley Town, East Grinstead Town, Eastbourne Borough, Hastings United, Haywards Heath Town, Horsham, Lancing, Lewes, Littlehampton Town, Three Bridges, Whitehawk and Worthing, all receive a bye to the second round.\nQualification for subsequent competitions.\nSussex Community Shield.\nThe winners of the Sussex Senior Cup traditionally play the winners of the Sussex County Football League (since 2015-2016 the Southern Combination Football League) for the Sussex Community Shield (also known as the Sussex County FA Community Shield. The 2019 competition saw Chichester City, the winners of the 2018−19 SCFL play Bognor Regis Town, the winners of the 2018−19 Sussex Senior Cup. Bognor won the 2019 Sussex Community Shield 1−0 with a goal from Dan Smith.\nVenues.\nFor rounds before the semi-final stage, the venue of each match is determined when the fixtures are drawn; the first club drawn in a fixture is usually the home team and matches are played at the club's home ground. The semi-finals are played at a neutral venue, usually at the Sussex FA at Culver Road in Lancing.\nThe final of the Sussex Senior Cup was held at Preston Park in Brighton for the first four competitions, from 1883 to 1886. It was then held at the County Cricket Ground in Hove for 18 editions of the cup, with the exception of the 1891 season, which was held on a league basis. In 1906 the first cup final took place to have been played at the Goldstone Ground in Hove. At the time the Goldstone Ground was the home stadium of Brighton and Hove Albion, which for some time was Sussex's only professional football club. The Goldstone Ground was known to have hosted the final of the Sussex Senior Cup a record 55 times between 1906 and 1995. Other stadiums to have hosted the Sussex Senior Cup include The Dripping Pan in Lewes (held 14 times between 1920 and 1947), The Trafalgar Ground in Newhaven (held twice in 1931 and 1932), Woodside Road in Worthing (held 7 times between 1934 and 1997), The Saffrons in Eastbourne (held once in 1936), Queen Street in Horsham (held once in 1949), Broadfield Stadium in Crawley (held twice in 1998 and 1999) and Priory Lane in Eastbourne (held 11 times between 2000 and 2010). Since 2011 the final of the Sussex Senior Cup has been played at the Falmer Stadium in Brighton.\nStatistics.\nTotal cups won by town or city.\n34 different clubs have won the cup, and the majority of cups have been won by clubs from Brighton and Hove, Eastbourne and Worthing."

The club have played both List A cricket and Twenty20 cricket since their introductions into the English game in 1963 and 2003 respectively.\nThe county were captained for their first 29 years of first-class cricket by W. G. Grace, whose family had helped form the club. The 359 first-class matches which he captained are the most by any player, eclipsing the combined 327 matches of Mark Alleyne, who led the county in all three formats of the game. Alleyne captained the county during its most prosperous spell, during which time they won eight one-day trophies. Gloucestershire have never won the official County Championship, but have runners-up on a number of occasions. They achieved this twice under the captaincy of Bev Lyon, whose captaincy was the primary factor in him being named as one of the \"Wisden\" Cricketers of the Year in 1931. \"Wisden\" noted that he was \"a possible England captain,\" though he never went on to appear for England.\nThe majority of Gloucestershire's captains have been English, only Mike Procter and Courtney Walsh have played international cricket for a different nation. Walter Troup, Cyril Sewell and George Emmett were all born outside of the United Kingdom, but within the British Empire. Three members of the Graveney family captained the county: Tom Graveney from 1959 to 1960, his brother Ken Graveney from 1963 to 1964, and the latter's son David Graveney between 1982 and 1988."

Through coordination of the efforts of Hong Kong's many cyclists and cycling groups, it campaigns to educate decision-makers about cycling as active transportation, and to encourage and enable all types of cycling, including utility/commuting, leisure riding, off-road, racing and touring.\nFounded in 2003, the group focuses on advocacy and engagement with government bodies, transport operators and others to effect changes in laws, regulations, policies and practices that affect the cycling community in Hong Kong, on the roads, on cycle tracks and on public transport. By promoting improved infrastructure and more public education, HKCAll aims to increase the use of bicycles as an efficient, healthy and economical component of Hong Kong's transportation network.\nAs part of its advocacy programme, HKCAll organises and co-organises events supporting an improved cycling environment, including the first major gathering of cycling groups in November 2005, which demanded government support for cycling, following the road death of a local racing cyclist. Since 2006, the group has coordinated the annual Ride of Silence in memory of cyclists killed and injured on the roads.\nIn 2003, members of HKCAll were instrumental in negotiations between the Hong Kong Star Ferry Company and the Transport Department leading to the introduction of free carriage of bicycles on the Wanchai-Tsim Sha Tsui Star Ferry route though there is now a small charge of around HK$11. In 2011, after much lobbying, the MTR metro system agreed to allow carriage of bicycles on all its lines.\nA popular current campaign calls for the inclusion of a Harbourfront Cycleway along the Hong Kong island shore of Victoria Harbour. The Cycleway runs from Kennedy Town to Heng Fa Chuen, following the harbourfront and new reclamation areas. Regular rallies to cycle the proposed route, as closely as possible, attract over a thousand supporters. In September 2011, HKCAll presented the proposal to the Hong Kong Harbourfront Commission."

The first new union to be formed was that of the UAE, which became a full IRB member in November 2012.\nThe team's final tournament before the breakup was the 2010 Asian Five Nations, which doubled as the final stage of Asian qualification for the 2011 Rugby World Cup.

Smith started with the original Ottawa Senators, and won a Stanley Cup with them in 1927, but by that time the club was in financial trouble and began selling off their stars. Smith was sold to the Maroons, where he was put on a line with Stewart and Siebert. Sportswriters immediately dubbed them the \"Three S Line\".\nA line feared by all.\nFrom their first season together, the trio was an offensive force feared by opposing netminders and players alike. They were not only the top three scorers on the Maroons that season (Stewart with 34 points, Smith 19, and Siebert 17), but Siebert and Stewart also led the team in penalty minutes, with 119 and 106, respectively, and ranked 4th and 5th in the entire NHL.\nOver the next three seasons, the S line was easily the Maroons' most productive in terms of points, and the three players combined for over 200 penalty minutes every year.\nStewart once stated that Siebert and Smith \"did most of the digging [for the puck] work. They knew I was out there waiting, and if they freed the puck, I'd do the rest.\"\nEnd of the line.\nBy the 1931–32 NHL season, the Maroons were struggling financially amid the Great Depression. It was also the first season of Stewart's career in which he did not lead his team in scoring; that statistic went to Dave Trottier. The team finished the year 19-22-7 with 45 points, 6th-best of the 8 teams in the NHL at that point. At the end of the season, Stewart and Siebert were both sold to other teams for cash, and the S Line was no more. Smith stayed with the Maroons and was their captain when the team won its final Stanley Cup in 1935.\nAll three players were posthumously inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame."

        "title": "Charles White (American football)",
        "text": "Charles Raymond White (January 22, 1958 – January 11, 2023) was an American football running back who played in the National Football League (NFL) for nine seasons from 1980 to 1988. He played college football for the USC Trojans, where he was a twice unanimous All-American and the winner of the Heisman Trophy. He was selected by the Cleveland Browns in the first round (27th overall) of the 1980 NFL Draft. He also played for the Los Angeles Rams.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Los Angeles, California, White graduated from San Fernando High School in San Fernando, where as a track and field athlete he won the low hurdles at the CIF California State Meet over future Olympic Gold medalist Andre Phillips. He was also a standout high school football player.\nCollege career.\nWhite attended the University of Southern California, where he played for the USC Trojans football team. In 1978, White won the W.J. Voit Memorial Trophy as the outstanding college football player on the Pacific Coast. In 1979, he received the Heisman Trophy, Maxwell Award, Walter Camp Award, and was named UPI Player of the Year. He is the second player in Rose Bowl history (of four, total) to have been honored as Player of the Game twice (1979 and 1980).\nProfessional career.\nWhite was the 27th overall pick in the 1980 NFL Draft, selected in the first round by the Cleveland Browns. After four disappointing seasons in Cleveland, where he rushed for a total of 942 yards and had a 3.4 yards per carry average, White was released before the start of the 1985 season. White later acknowledged that he struggled with cocaine addiction during this period.\nAfter his release from the Browns in 1985, he reunited with his college coach, John Robinson, who was then coaching the Los Angeles Rams. White played for the Rams for four seasons, 1985 to 1988. In 1987, he rushed for a league-leading 1,387 yards and 11 touchdowns, which earned him a Pro Bowl selection and the NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award.\nWhite finished his NFL career with 3,075 rushing yards, and 23 rushing touchdowns, along with 114 receptions, 860 yards, and one receiving touchdown.\nPost-playing career.\nIn 1993, White joined USC as running backs coach; he later worked as a computer consultant.\nIn its third and fourth seasons, \"American Gladiators\" held special \"Pro Football Challenge of Champions\" shows. White participated in and won both, each time coming from behind in the \"Eliminator\" thanks to slip-ups by his opponents. He also competed in sixth season's USC vs. Notre Dame alumni special where he also won, giving him a 3-0 record on the show.\nPersonal life and drug use.\nDuring his years at USC, White struggled with cocaine and marijuana use. In a 1987 Sports Illustrated article, he admitted to smoking marijuana daily at USC and snorted his first line of cocaine a few weeks before the 1977 Rose Bowl. He met fellow USC student Judi McGovern and the two dated throughout their time at USC, eventually marrying and having a daughter. However, White continued his cocaine use through college and on into his early NFL career with the Browns. White checked into drug rehab in 1982 and was clean for three years. Even so, the Browns cut him in 1985 and he was picked up on waivers by the Los Angeles Rams, where he was reunited with John Robinson, his former college coach at USC.\nWhite soon had a short relapse into cocaine, but got clean again until one night in August 1987, where he and a friend did lines until White was arrested. However, Robinson bailed him out of jail and agreed to keep him on the team if he stayed clean. White responded with the best season of his career in the strike-affected 1987 season, running for 339 yards in the three \"scab games\" after the Rams traded Eric Dickerson —- and then running for 100 yards in five straight games afterwards.\nWhite and McGovern eventually divorced. White sold his 1979 Heisman Trophy in 2000 to settle tax debts. White had five children, three daughters and two sons.\nA Los Angeles Times article on July 17, 2022, by Bill Plaschke describes White's struggles with dementia and how he was living in an Orange County, California assisted living facility as of 2022. White could still recall his football days, but had issues with day-to-day functioning; the signs were that his dementia was caused by his career playing football.\nWhite died of liver cancer on January 11, 2023, at the age of 64. He is one of at least 345 NFL players to be diagnosed after death with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which is caused by repeated hits to the head."

        "title": "Hawkstone Park Motocross Circuit",
        "text": "Hawkstone Park Motocross Circuit, typically referred to as Hawkstone Park or Hawkstone, is a motocross circuit situated near Market Drayton, north Shropshire, England. The circuit is arguably one of the world's most famous motocross circuits, having staged many grand prix and international events from the 1950s, right through until the present day.\nThe Circuit.\nThe Hawkstone circuit is approximately long (although the layout can be shortened for youth or clubman events if required).\nIt is famous for the track surface, which consists of deep, loamy sand. During the course of a race meeting, the circuit becomes very rough and bumpy, testing the skill of riders. \nThe centrepiece of the circuit is the famous 'Hawkstone Hill', a steep hill that eventually rises to a 1-in-3 ascent at the top of the hill. The crest of the hill can be seen from the A53 road (Shrewsbury to Market Drayton) several miles away.\nAt the top of the hill, riders have to contend with a hard sandstone surface, before dropping back down the hill in a fearsome descent, beginning in an almost vertical drop, followed by a bumpy descent that tests riders' skill and bike control.\nOther famous obstacles include the 'whoop' section, a series of large man-made bumps that require a great deal of skill and courage from riders in order to tackle them at speed. A fall in this section is usually heavy and spectacular. (3 times World Motocross Champion David Thorpe crashed spectacularly here in front of TV cameras at the 1986 500cc British Motocross Grand Prix).\nThere is also a Race control area including a commentary tower, offices, scrutineering area and press room, a first aid building, toilets and shower area for riders, and a large paddock and car park area.\nEarly history.\nThe site used for motocross events first held a motorsport event in 1938, a hill climb event, staged by the 'Crewe and Nantwich Light Car Club'. The event used the Hawkstone Hill, the winner being the driver who was able to get the furthest up the hill. These quaint beginnings were soon halted by the advent of World War II, but soon after the end of the war, motocross (or scrambling as was known) made its debut at Hawkstone Park. The event was held by the Salop Motor Club, who still organise events at Hawkstone Park, and manage the motocross circuit to this day. Qualification for the motocross races was determined in a similar fashion to the hill climb events, the riders who made it the furthest up the hill qualified for the race.\n1950s &amp; 1960s.\nFrom there, the circuit moved onto greater heights, in 1951 the first national level meeting was held and in 1954, the circuit staged a round of the FIM European Motocross Championship. 33,000 spectators witnessed British rider Phil Nex take the victory.\n1960 saw one of the largest crowds in Hawkstone Park's history, for the Brian Stonebridge Memorial Trophy (in memory of 1950s rider Brian Stonebridge who died in a motoring accident). 54,000 spectators attended the event, with buses being laid on from nearby towns such as Shrewsbury for spectators.\nGrand Prix events continued at the circuit until 1965, by which time, the dusty conditions had deemed the circuit too dangerous for top level motocross competition. British rider Jeff Smith won the final 500cc Grand Prix of the decade in 1965, aboard his BSA.\nThe 1950s and 1960s were arguably the hey-day for Hawkstone Park. Thanks to coverage from the BBC \"Grandstand\" programme (which incidentally included Murray Walker as commentator), \"Scrambling\" was quite popular with the general public, and major events at Hawkstone regularly saw five-figure crowds in attendance.\n1970s &amp; 1980s.\nGrand Prix Motocross returned to Hawkstone for 1975, where Suzuki rider Gerrit Wolsink took victory. However, riders in the 500cc voiced their disapproval with the dusty conditions, and so in 1976, a Grand Prix was staged for 125cc machines, in the inaugural FIM 125cc Motocross World Championship, Belgian Gaston Rahier taking victory.\nThe circuit then hosted a series of successful 250cc Grand Prix events in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and the Salop Motor Club also introduced the popular \"New Year's Day\" event during this period. The New Year's Day event was staged on January 1, each year until 1999, and saw British Motocross Championship riders, along clubmen and youth riders tackle a shortened version of the Hawkstone circuit.\nIn 1984, 500cc Grand Prix events once again returned to Hawkstone Park, where Belgian Georges Jobé famously jumped over rival André Malherbe during the second Grand Prix race. Overall winner was British rider David Thorpe, who finished highly in the 1986 Grand Prix despite a heavy fall, before taking another popular victory in the 1988 Grand Prix.\nIn 1989, a whole new generation of riders competed at Hawkstone, as the circuit staged its final 125cc Grand Prix. Overall winner was American Trampas Parker, whilst hidden away with the back-markers was Belgian newcomer Stefan Everts, who later went on to dominate Grand Prix motocross.\n1990s.\nHawkstone Park had alternated as the venue for the 500cc British Grand Prix with Farleigh Castle circuit in Wiltshire during the 1980s, but from 1990, the circuit was used on a permanent basis. Unfortunately this coincided with a major decline in popularity for 500cc events, as the major motorcycle manufacturers switched their attention to the 250cc series. Whilst the circuit was still used for national events, it was in the 1990s that Grand Prix racing was to leave Hawkstone Park. The circuit staged 500cc Grand Prix events until 1994, holding another event in 1997 and then held its final Grand Prix event of the decade in 1999, Sweden's Peter Johansson taking the overall victory on a gloriously sunny July day.\nPresent day.\nHawkstone Park was to have a new lease of life however, as it staged its first pre-season International event in 1999. Held every March, the International event sees some of the world's top riders competing at the circuit, gaining race speed prior to the full Grand Prix season. The event is seen as the \"curtain-opener\" to the British Motocross season, with crowds of over 10,000 regularly attending the International events.\nHawkstone Park also stages several amateur and historic race meetings every season along with a round of the ACU British Motocross Championship. The venue has also staged the British Trials Grand Prix, utilising the steep, rocky woodland surrounding the circuit as opposed to the motocross track itself.\nIn the past, the circuit has also been used for enduro events, utilising the motocross circuit and the woodland surrounding much of the circuit to create an extended lap of several miles.\nThe circuit is seen as one of the toughest motocross circuits in the UK, with many fans calling for it to return to the MX1 Motocross Grand Prix schedule. However, this is unlikely to happen, due to the high costs in staging a Grand Prix event, along with the relatively remote location and infrastructure in the local area. Despite this, Grand Prix motocross returned to the circuit in 2009, with the circuit hosting the opening round of the MX3 Motocross Grand Prix series. The Grand Prix event also featured the opening round of the European MX2 championship. Victory in the MX3 class went to Frenchman Julien Vanni, with fellow French rider Christophe Charlier winning the MX2 event. Despite the racing being described as some of the most exciting to take place at Hawkstone Park for some years, disappointing crowds meant the event made a financial loss, and is unclear whether the Grand Prix will be staged at the circuit in 2010.\nOther information.\nPopular singer Roy Orbison visited Hawkstone Park as a spectator at the 1965 500cc British Grand Prix. An avid motorcycle fan, he was offered the chance to try a lap of the circuit. Unfortunately he crashed, broke an ankle and appeared live on \"Saturday Night at the London Palladium\" that evening with his foot in a plaster cast.\nThe circuit has only suffered one fatality in its 60-year history as a motocross circuit, when 21-year-old Richard Fitch was killed whilst competing in a national championship in June 2005. Following fundraising efforts, a memorial bench in Fitch's memory was erected opposite the circuit's race control, shortly after the finishing line.\nThe circuit is not to be confused with the Hawkstone Park follies situated nearby. As race meetings are only staged occasionally during the year, the motocross circuit is signposted using temporary billboards and signs, however a common mistake for first time visitors is to follow the permanent road signs and end up at the historic Hawkstone Park follies!\nRiding at the circuit.\nThe circuit is classed as private property and is not open for general practice. The circuit only stages a handful of race meetings per year, usually run by Salop Motor Club, or with assistance from the Salop Motor Club. Most events are open for amateur racers registered with either the AMCA or ACU governing bodies, although some of the higher profile events are limited to National championship riders or professional international riders.\nGenerally the circuit is seen as one of the toughest in the UK, and is not recommended for a novice, especially in its Grand Prix format. The deep sand and bumpy surface sap the energy of even the best riders and to ride at speed around the circuit takes a lot of hard work and concentration.\nHowever the circuit is picturesque, and provides a rare opportunity for amateur riders to ride on an International standard circuit."

        "text": "The 1994 Stanley Cup Final was the championship series of the National Hockey League's (NHL) 1993–94 season, and the culmination of the 1994 Stanley Cup playoffs. It was contested between the Eastern Conference champion New York Rangers and Western Conference champion Vancouver Canucks. The Canucks were making the club's second Finals appearance, their first coming during their Cinderella run of , and the Rangers were making their tenth appearance, their first since . The Rangers ended their then record 54-year championship drought with a victory in game seven to claim the long-awaited Stanley Cup. It was the fourth championship in franchise history. The CBC broadcast of the deciding game seven attracted an average Canadian audience of 4.957 million viewers, making it the most watched CBC Sports program in history to that time. This was the last Stanley Cup Final with games played in Canada until , and the last to go the full seven games until .\nPaths to the Finals.\nThe Canucks entered the playoffs seeded seventh in the Western Conference, and overcame a three-games-to-one deficit against the Calgary Flames, winning the final three games in overtime with game seven ending in double overtime as Pavel Bure scored the winning goal on a breakaway to upset the Flames. They then upset the fourth-seeded Dallas Stars and the third-seeded Toronto Maple Leafs in five games each to capture the Western Conference title.\nThe Rangers entered the playoffs with the league's best record, then swept their New York-area rival New York Islanders and then beat the Washington Capitals in five games, before falling behind three games to two in the Eastern Conference Finals against their Hudson River rivals, New Jersey Devils. They then won game six by a 4–2 score after team captain Mark Messier publicly guaranteed a victory and then scored a third-period hat trick. The Rangers then won game seven 2–1 on Stéphane Matteau's goal in double overtime, prompting the call of \"Matteau, Matteau, Matteau!\" by Rangers radio announcer Howie Rose. It was Matteau's second double overtime goal of the series.\nGame summaries.\nThis series brought together two assistant coaches who were teammates on the other Canucks team to reach the Finals: Rangers assistant coach Colin Campbell and Canucks assistant coach Stan Smyl, who served as team captain then, as Kevin McCarthy was injured.\nIt was the second straight Finals that featured a former Edmonton Oilers captain trying to become the first person to win a Stanley Cup as captain on two different teams. The previous year, Wayne Gretzky, who captained the Oilers to the first four of their five Stanley Cups in the 1980s, captained the Los Angeles Kings to the finals, which they lost to the Montreal Canadiens. Here, it was Mark Messier of the Rangers, who captained the Oilers to the last of their five, in .\nThe Rangers players had a decided edge in Finals experience, with seven players from the 1990 Oilers, including Messier, Glenn Anderson, Jeff Beukeboom, Adam Graves, Kevin Lowe, Craig MacTavish, and Esa Tikkanen. One 1990 Oiler, Martin Gelinas, was playing for the Canucks. Overall, the Rangers had eleven players with previous Finals appearances, compared to the Canucks' five. In addition, three of the Rangers (Messier, Anderson, and Lowe) were each making their seventh appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals (each having made their first six with Edmonton).\nWith the Rangers having 112 points in the regular-season standing and the Canucks 85, the 27-point difference was the largest point differential between two teams in the Stanley Cup Finals since 1982, when there was a 41-point difference between the New York Islanders (118) and the Canucks (77).\nGame one.\nThe Rangers scored early and led 2–1 late in the third period before Martin Gélinas tied the game with 1:00 to play in regulation time. It was the third time in eight games that the Rangers had surrendered a last-minute tying goal. The Rangers were all over the Canucks in overtime, but goaltender Kirk McLean made 52 saves on the night. In the last minute of the first overtime, Brian Leetch hit the crossbar at one end, and the Canucks went down to score the winner at the other on an odd-man rush by Greg Adams, as the Rangers, once again, lost a series opener at home in overtime.\nGame two.\nThe Rangers evened the series with a 3–1 victory before the series shifted west.\nGame three.\nThe Canucks came storming out in front of their home fans and Pavel Bure scored on his first shift to give them the early lead. But late in the period, with the score tied 1–1, Bure hit Jay Wells in the face with his stick and cut him, leading to a major penalty and Bure's expulsion from the game. Alexei Kovalev scored a breakaway shorthanded goal, which was featured on the cover of \"NHL 95\". Glenn Anderson scored on the ensuing power-play and the Rangers then cruised to a 5–1 victory.\nGame four.\nIn the fourth game, the Canucks again jumped out to an early lead, this time 2–0, before Mike Richter and Brian Leetch took over the game. Richter made some key saves to keep the game within reach, including one on a penalty shot against Pavel Bure, and Leetch picked up a goal and three assists as the Rangers won 4–2 to take a commanding 3–1 series lead.\nGame five.\nMost who entered Madison Square Garden for the fifth game thought they were going to see the Rangers win the Cup that night. New York had already set the date for a victory parade. However, the celebration plans got ahead of the work at hand. The Canucks were leading 3–0 by the third minute of the third period. Even though the Rangers scrambled to pull even by the midway point, Vancouver took the lead 29 seconds later on a goal by Dave Babych and cruised to a 6–3 win.\nGame six.\nThe Canucks fired 14 shots at Mike Richter in the first period and led 1–0 on a Jeff Brown bullet from the point. The score was 2–1 after two periods before another Brown goal gave the Canucks a 3–1 third-period lead. Late in the third, Geoff Courtnall appeared to score for the Canucks, but the play continued and the Rangers scored to temporarily make the score 3–2. But, in the ensuing video review, it was confirmed that Courtnall had indeed scored his second goal of the game to clinch the game for the Canucks and force a seventh game, the first in the finals since 1987.\nGame seven.\nFor the second time since and the tenth time overall, the Finals went to seven games. Rangers coach Mike Keenan became the first person to be a head coach in game sevens of the Stanley Cup Finals for two different teams. Keenan had coached the Philadelphia Flyers in when they lost to the Edmonton Oilers. Mike Babcock would join him in this feat in while with the Detroit Red Wings, having been with the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim when they lost to the New Jersey Devils in (the home team won all seven games of the series).\nThe game at Madison Square Garden was an \"electric affair\" with the Rangers jumping to an early 2–0 lead at the 15-minute mark after scoring twice within four minutes on goals by Brian Leetch and Adam Graves. However, Canucks captain Trevor Linden silenced the home crowd with a short-handed goal early in the second period to make it 2-1. Mark Messier restored order for the home crowd with a power play goal, only to have Linden make it close again. After that, it was \"hectic, jittery hockey,\" Nathan LaFayette \"frightened all Manhattan wobbling a loose puck\" off the post behind Mike Richter with five minutes left. There were three face-offs in the Rangers' zone in the final 37 seconds, the last coming with 1.6 seconds on the clock.\nMark Messier provided two of the most memorable images of that Stanley Cup Finals that would become iconic images to the Rangers and their fans: first, jumping up and down excitedly as ticker tape fell, then, showing incredible emotion as he accepted the Stanley Cup from NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman, as he became the first (and , the only) player to captain two different teams to the Stanley Cup. At the time Messier was credited for the game-winning goal earning him the tongue-in-cheek nickname of \"Mr. June\", however, Messier admitted in 2017 that the game-winning goal was likely scored by Brian Noonan.\nTelevision.\nIn Canada, the series was televised in English on the CBC and in French on SRC. In the United States, the series was broadcast on ESPN outside of the New York City market. The local rightsholder, MSG Network broadcast games one, two, three, six, and seven on its main channel, and games four and five on its secondary MSG 2 channel, due to conflicts with the Yankees schedule.\nThis was the last Cup Finals in which the regional rights holders of the participating U.S. teams produced local telecasts of their respective games. This was also the last Cup Finals to air exclusively on a cable network until , when TNT aired the Finals for the first time ever. Under the American TV contracts that would take effect beginning next season, there would be exclusive national coverage of the Cup Finals, split between Fox Sports and ESPN.\nESPN also sent its broadcasts to a record 120 countries, for a potential audience of 285 million. MSG Network broadcaster Al Trautwig said that the Rangers themselves contributed to those numbers in putting the first Russian names on the Stanley Cup: Alexander Karpovtsev, Alexei Kovalev, Sergei Nemchinov, and Sergei Zubov, giving a huge European audience, including those watching on the brand-new television screens across the former Soviet Union, a Stanley Cup story to remember.\nRatings.\nIn the United States, game seven was the highest-rated hockey game on cable. ESPN's broadcast drew a 5.2 rating. However, in New York, the ESPN blackout meant MSG Network's broadcast drew 16.2 rating, a record for the network. The two networks combined yielded a 6.9 rating.\nWith an average Canadian audience of 4.957 million viewers, game seven was the most watched CBC Sports program until the 10.6 million viewers for the men's ice hockey gold medal game between Canada and the United States at the 2002 Winter Olympics, when Canada won its first Olympic ice hockey gold medal since the 1952 Winter Olympics. Bob Cole, who called both games, said that game seven was one of his most memorable TV games.\nTeam rosters.\nBolded years under Finals appearance indicates a year the player won the Stanley Cup.\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe 1994 Stanley Cup was presented to Rangers captain Mark Messier by NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman following the Rangers 3–2 win over the Canucks in game seven\nThe following Rangers players and staff had their names engraved on the Stanley Cup\n1993–94 New York Rangers"

        "text": "Vernon \"Catfish\" Smith (January 14, 1908 – September 29, 1988) was an American football, basketball, and baseball player, coach, and military officer. A three-sport athlete at the University of Georgia, Smith was named to the 1931 College Football All-America Team as an end. After his playing days, he served as the co-head basketball coach at his alma mater during the 1937–38 season. Smith was also the head baseball coach at Georgia from 1934 to 1937 and at the University of South Carolina from 1938 to 1939 and again from 1946 to 1947. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1979.\nEarly life and playing career.\nSmith was born Macon, Georgia. His nickname of \"Catfish\" is attributed to a story in which he bit the head off of one as a 25-cent bet while a student at Lanier High School in Macon. He and a friend were fishing in Walnut Creek.\nSmith played football at the University of Georgia from 1929 to 1931 and was named an All-American in 1931. In 1929, he scored all 15 points for Georgia in an upset of Yale—scoring one touchdown by falling on a blocked punt in the end zone and another by receiving a pass, kicking an extra point and tackling a Yale player for a safety. The game was the first-ever played at Sanford Stadium. Smith wore number 9, and stood 6'2\" and 190 pounds. He made an all-time Georgia Bulldogs football team picked in 1935. He was nominated though not selected for an \"Associated Press\" All-Time Southeast 1920-1969 era team. Smith was a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity.\nCoaching and military career.\nAfter completing his Georgia career as a football player in 1931 (he graduated with a B.S. in 1933), Catfish Smith went into coaching from 1932 to 1941 and coached football at Georgia, the University of South Carolina and the University of Mississippi. He was also the head baseball coach at the University of Georgia and the University of South Carolina. He then joined the United States Army Air Forces, retiring in 1963 with the rank of colonel.\nHonors.\nSmith's sports honors include induction into the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame in 1966 and in the College Football Hall of Fame in 1979.\nHis military honors included the Legion of Merit, Air Force Commendation Medal, World War II Victory Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Air Force Reserve Medal and Air Force Longevity Medal."

        "title": "Underarm bowling incident of 1981",
        "text": "The underarm bowling incident of 1981 is a sporting controversy that took place on 1 February 1981, when Australia played New Zealand in a One Day International cricket match, the third in the best-of-five final of the 1980–81 World Series Cup, at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. \nWith one ball of the final over remaining in the match, New Zealand required a six to tie the match. To ensure that New Zealand were unable to achieve this, the Australian captain Greg Chappell instructed his bowler (and younger brother) Trevor Chappell to deliver the last ball to batsman Brian McKechnie underarm along the ground. Trevor did so, forcing McKechnie to play the ball defensively, meaning Australia won. This action, although legal at the time, was nevertheless widely perceived as being wholly against the traditional spirit of cricketing fair play. \nThe outrage caused by the incident eventually led to an official amendment to the international laws of cricket to prevent it from occurring again.\nEvents leading up to the delivery.\nThe series was tied 1–1, New Zealand having won the first match and Australia the second. The two umpires for this match were Donald Weser and Peter Cronin, both Australian.\nThe third match had already seen another moment of controversy: with Australia batting, New Zealand's Martin Snedden claimed a low outfield catch off a hit by Greg Chappell when Chappell was on 58. In his live television commentary on Australia's Channel Nine, former Australian cricket captain Richie Benaud exclaimed, \"That is one of the best catches I have ever seen in my life\". However, Snedden's catch was ruled not out by the umpires. This was some years before TV replays could be used in umpiring decisions; the Channel Nine broadcast did show viewers slow-motion replays of Snedden's catch from various camera angles, including a close-up of Snedden diving to fairly claim the catch. After reviewing several TV replays, Benaud re-affirmed what he had initially seen live, saying, \"There is no question in my mind that that was a great catch – clearly caught above the ground, a superb catch.\"\nSome commentators believed that Chappell should have taken Snedden's word that the catch was good, as had been a time-honoured tradition. Chappell maintained he was not sure about the catch and was within his rights to wait for the umpires to rule. Chappell went on to score 90 before he was caught by Bruce Edgar in a similar fashion. This time, Chappell walked after he clearly saw the fielder had cupped his hands under the ball.\nLillee had bowled the penultimate over to reach his allocated 10 overs with his final involvement being the dismissal of John Parker, caught inside the circle by Trevor. Commentator Richie Benaud's post-game commentary accused Greg Chappell of having \"got his sums wrong\" by not having Lillee, his best bowler, take the final over. Graeme Beard was the other bowler involved in the mix-up, closing out his allocated 10 in the 43rd and 45th overs after a players meeting involve Greg Chappell, Lillee, Kim Hughes and Rod Marsh were unable to count the overs out correctly using hand calculations.\nTrevor then bowled the final over (his 10th of the innings) with New Zealand requiring 15 to win. \nBruce Edgar who was on 102 not out was stuck at the non-striker's end the entire over. His innings has been called \"the most overlooked century of all time\".\nThe first five balls of the over produced a 4, the dismissal of Hadlee via a plumb LBW, 2, 2 and Ian Smith dismissed bowled trying to heave the ball to cow corner. This left New Zealand requiring 7 to win, or 6 to tie off the final ball. In the event of a tie, under rules at the time of the game, the match would have been replayed; incidentally, this later occurred in the finals of the 1983–84 Australian Tri-Series.\nThe delivery.\nNew Zealand needed 6 runs to tie the match from the final ball, with eight wickets down. Greg Chappell, the Australian captain, instructed the bowler (his younger brother Trevor) to bowl underarm in a bid to prevent the Number 10 New Zealand batsman (Brian McKechnie) from getting under the delivery with sufficient power and elevation to hit a six. Bowling underarm was within the laws of cricket at the time (although specifically against the rules in certain one-day competitions around the world, such as the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup tournament in England), but was universally considered as archaic, uncompetitive, and not a bowling style that would ever be used seriously at even junior levels of the sport.\nIn accordance with cricket protocol, the umpires and batsmen were informed that the bowler was changing his delivery style and that the final ball would be delivered underarm. Trevor Chappell then rolled the ball along the pitch, in the style of bowls. \nMcKechnie blocked the ball defensively, then threw his bat away in a show of angry frustration. Australia had achieved victory by 6 runs. The New Zealand batsmen walked off the field in disgust. The New Zealand captain, Geoff Howarth, ran onto the field to plead with the umpires. Howarth believed underarm bowling to be illegal in the competition, as per the rules in the English one-day tournaments with which he was very familiar.\nIn the confusion before the final ball was bowled, one of the Australian fielders, Dennis Lillee, did not walk into place, meaning that technically the ball should have been a no-ball on the grounds that Australia had one too many fielders outside the field restriction line. Had the umpires noticed this, New Zealand would have been awarded one run for the no-ball, and the final ball would have needed to be re-bowled.\nReactions.\nAs the ball was being bowled, Ian Chappell (elder brother of Greg and Trevor, and a former Australian captain), who was commentating on the match, was heard to call out \"No, Greg, no, you can't do that\" in an instinctive reaction to the incident, and he remained critical in a later newspaper article on the incident.\nCommentating for Channel 9 at the time, former Australian captain Richie Benaud described the act as \"disgraceful\" and said it was \"one of the worst things I have ever seen done on a cricket field\". \nNew Zealand team member Warren Lees recounted the underarm incident on New Zealand's \"20/20\" current affairs show in February 2005. He said that immediately after the match there had been a long silence in the New Zealand dressing room, which was broken suddenly and unexpectedly by fellow player Mark Burgess throwing and smashing a tea cup against a wall. \"That summed up how we all were feeling, too angry for words. We felt we'd been cheated. We were livid\", Lees stated.\nAfter the incident, the then Prime Minister of New Zealand, Robert Muldoon, described it as \"the most disgusting incident I can recall in the history of cricket\", going on to say that \"it was an act of true cowardice and I consider it appropriate that the Australian team were wearing yellow\". The Prime Minister of Australia, Malcolm Fraser, called the act \"contrary to all the traditions of the game\".\nGreg Chappell's explanation.\nIn later years, Greg Chappell claimed that he had been exhausted and stressed after a demanding season of cricket and that, in hindsight, he was not mentally fit to be captain at the time. He had also been on the field through the majority of the match that had been played in stifling hot conditions. At the 40-over mark of the New Zealand innings, Chappell (who had scored 90 in the Australian innings and then bowled 10 overs to the New Zealanders) told wicketkeeper Rod Marsh that he wanted to leave the field. Marsh, who described Chappell as being physically spent and exhausted, said that was not possible, and that Chappell had no choice but to see out the match. Despite being captain and arranging bowling changes and field placings, Chappell spent several overs fielding on the boundary because he felt overwhelmed by the conditions and the pressure of the situation.\nLegacy.\nAs a direct result of the incident, underarm bowling was banned by the International Cricket Council as \"not within the spirit of the game\".\nThe following year, the Australians went on tour to New Zealand. There was a boisterous crowd of 43,000 at Eden Park, Auckland, for the first One Day International of the tour. As Greg Chappell came out to bat, a crown green bowls wood was rolled from the crowd on to the outfield, mimicking what had happened at the MCG the previous year. That day, he scored a century in a losing cause.\nAlthough both Chappell brothers have publicly stated their embarrassment, McKechnie bears no ill-will over the incident. Greg Chappell says \"All my frustrations boiled over on that day\", while Trevor Chappell is reluctant to talk about it. Trevor Chappell remains best remembered for the \"Underarm '81\" incident.\nThe incident was later used to inspire an instant kiwi lottery ad that humorously depicts a rematch in which exactly the same conditions had arisen and Australia were again bowling the underarm. However, Brian McKechnie instead places his box in the way and subsequently hits a six as the ball deflects off it, resulting in embarrassment for the Australian players.\nIn 1993, Sir Richard Hadlee bowled the ball underarm during the Allan Border tribute match in Brisbane, causing much laughter from the crowd.\nOn 17 February 2005, over 24 years after the original underarm delivery, Australian fast bowler Glenn McGrath light-heartedly revisited the incident in the first ever Twenty20 international, played between Australia and New Zealand. In the last over of the match, a grinning McGrath mimed an underarm delivery to Kyle Mills, which prompted New Zealand umpire Billy Bowden to produce a mock red card. As New Zealand needed more than 44 runs to win off the last delivery the outcome of the game was never in doubt, so it was positively received in the spirit it was intended by the crowd.\nIn the 2013 Australian movie \"Backyard Ashes\", Spock rolls a can of beer along the ground to Shep before a backyard cricket match."

        "text": "Len Smith (1918–2000) was an Australian representative rugby union and rugby league footballer who played in the 1930s and 1940s. He captained the Kangaroos in two Tests in 1948 and was controversially omitted from the 1948-49 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain.\nRugby union career.\nSmith played with the Eastern Suburbs RUFC in the 1930s and after making state representative appearance for New South Wales against Queensland, Victoria and the All Blacks he was selected as a Wallaby for the ill-fated 1939 tour of Great Britain. Docking at Southampton the day before World War II was declared, the side left England without playing a game.\nWartime.\nSmith enlisted in the AIF during World War II and served in Palestine, Egypt and Syria before returning home in 1942. Playing rugby league in the army Smith realised that many union players in Sydney had converted and on his return he switched codes to be able to compete against the best players. He remained in the Army whilst playing for Newtown. For the 1944 semi-final against the St George Smith had to travel 25 hours by train from an army camp in Melbourne.Smith saw further active service and a command from 1944 to 1945 in New Guinea. At discharge in October 1945 he was a Captain in the 2/2 Australian Ordnance Stores Company.\nRugby league career.\nClub career.\nSmith joined the Newtown Bluebags in 1942 and played with the club until 1948, aside from the 1945 season when he was on active service. He scored 45 tries for Newtown during his five-year career at the club. During the final years of the Second World War, when players and coaches became scarce, Len Smith co-coached the Newtown first grade team with Frank Farrell.\nRepresentative career.\nHe was selected in Sydney Firsts in 1946. In 1947 at age 28 he was selected as captain of Sydney and NSW and won the NSW Player of the Year award.\nHe debuted for the Kangaroos in 1948 being named as captain-coach for a two Test series against New Zealand. The Australians were beaten in a shock upset 21–19 in the 1st Test in Sydney but regrouped to win the 2nd test in Brisbane 13–4. Smith's tactics of running himself like a forward at the Kiwi centres was critical to the victory.\nHe is listed on the Australian Players Register as Kangaroo No. 247. In 1948 he was also named New South Wales player of the year.\n1948 selection controversy.\nHaving just played a key role in the Kangaroos' 3-1 series victory over New Zealand it seemed a mere formality that Smith would be chosen to lead the team of young inexperienced Kangaroos on the end of year 1948 Tour of England. However on the night the side was announced Smith was left out of the party.\nIt was unfathomable that the current Australian captain/coach having would not be good enough to be selected in the touring squad of 28. There was press uproar at the time and lobbying for a change by Newtown. Some of those involved at the time when interviewed many years later by sporting journalists still spoke bitterly of the episode. \nAccolades.\nIn 2008, the centenary year of rugby league in Australia, Smith was named in the Newtown Jets 18-man team of the century.\nDual-code international status.\nRegarding the 1939 Wallaby squad, the Whiticker reference records that \"the squad played at exhibition match in Bombay on the journey home so that the players could be afforded international status\" and consequently refers to Smith as a dual-code international. However, the Pollard reference records that the Wallabies played against a \"Gymkhana XV made up of military men and others\".\nLater life.\nAfter football Smith became a respected sportswriter establishing \"Sporting Life \"magazine. He was a senior administrator in the harness racing industry and worked for the New South Wales Trotting Authority. He was involved in the 1967 establishment of the \"Miracle Mile\" event.\nSmith died on 25 April 2000 in St George Hospital following bowel cancer surgery."

        "text": "David Charles Harris (born January 21, 1984) is a former American football linebacker of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the University of Michigan. Harris was drafted by the New York Jets in the second round of the 2007 NFL draft.\nHigh school career.\nHarris attended Ottawa Hills High School in Grand Rapids, Michigan where he played high school football. At linebacker, he set a school record with 158 tackles as a junior, and earned all-state honors from the \"Detroit Free Press\" as a senior, and he also contributed as a fullback.\nHarris also participated in track and field, and this combination of size and speed led him to become one of the state's top prospects.\nCollege career.\nHarris received an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Michigan, where he played for the Michigan Wolverines football team. However, he was forced to redshirt as a freshman due to a knee injury which nearly derailed his career. It took nearly two years for Harris to fully recover, and he only played sparingly as a redshirt freshman and sophomore.\nNot until his junior year did Harris become a full-time starter. He began to show signs of a future in the NFL when he led the Wolverines in 2005 with 88 tackles, and 103 tackles as a senior.

Harris also won AFC Defensive Player of the Week for his play. In week three, as his team was only up seven points, he intercepted a Kerry Collins pass, and then followed that drive by sacking him on first down during the Tennessee Titans next series. Harris himself had 12 tackles, (ten solo). During the Jets' week six game against the Buffalo Bills, Harris recorded 17 tackles. In week 11 against division rivals, Harris recorded 13 tackles (ten solo) as he earned defensive play caller for the Jets that week.\nHarris finished his season as the leading tackler on football's number one defense with 127 tackles.

        "title": "Tommy Lasorda Baseball",
        "text": "Tommy Lasorda Baseball is a 1989 baseball video game developed and published by Sega as one of the six launch titles for the Sega Genesis in the North America and for the Sega Mega-Tech arcade system. It is a follow-up to the arcade game \"Super League\" (1987). It prominently features former MLB player Tommy Lasorda, who was manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers at the time. In the game, players compete with either AI-controlled opponents or against other players across single exhibitions, open matches or a 30-game season.\n\"Tommy Lasorda Baseball\" formed part of a marketing campaign to build a library of titles using recognizable names and likenesses of celebrities and athletes to emphasize the more arcade-like experience available on Sega Genesis. The game garnered mixed to positive reception from critics since its release on the Genesis; praise was given to the addition of season play, use of multiple perspectives, sound, two-player component and gameplay but criticism was geared towards this aspect being luck-based and difficult AI, while others felt mixed in regards to the graphical quality and recommended similar titles instead.\nGameplay.\n\"Tommy Lasorda Baseball\" is a baseball game where players compete in matches against AI-controlled opponents or other players in single exhibitions, open matches or a 30-game season. A password system enables players to take their team through a season in the World Series and keeps tracks of other teams in the league. The 26 teams featured in the game uses all their real-life city names but statistics and player names are fictional.\nAlthough it follows the same gameplay as with other baseball titles at the time and most of the rules are present as well, the game opts for a more arcade-styled approach of the sport instead of being full simulation. During gameplay, players must hit a pitch, reach any base safely, pitch a strike, getting an AI player out or retiring the AI's side to end an inning. The game ends when a team has scored more runs than the other at any time.\nOutside of gameplay, players must manage the abilities of batters and pitchers; Batters are rated based on batting average, home runs, running speed, fielding and throwing. Pitchers are rated based on earned run average (ERA), curve-throwing ability, stamina, top throwing speed, and the distance a hit pitch will travel. A pre-game difficulty setting makes the game biased either towards the pitcher, batter, or an equal game of skill between pitcher and batter. Players can also decide if there will be fielding errors or how environmental hazards such as wind will affect the ball.\nRelease.\n\"Tommy Lasorda Baseball\" was first published in Japan by Sega on April 22, 1989, for the Mega Drive under the title \"Super League\" and later that year in North America on August 14 as one of the six launch titles for the Genesis. It was also released in Europe under its original title. Sega signed former MLB player Tommy Lasorda, who was manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers at the time, to endorse the game as part of a marketing campaign to build a library of titles using recognizable names and likenesses of celebrities and athletes emphasizing the more arcade-like experience available on the Genesis. An arcade version using the Sega Mega-Tech system was also released in April 1989. The original Japanese release features teams that bear resemblance to the 1989 NPB roster. The Genesis version was later re-released as a budget title in 1992 as part of the \"Sega Classic\" line.\nReception.\n\"Tommy Lasorda Baseball\" garnered mixed to positive reception from critics since its release but was tied with \"World Class Baseball\" and \"Baseball Simulator 1.000\" for \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\"s \"Best Sports-Themed Video Game\" award in 1989. However, public response in Japan was mixed; while readers of \"Mega Drive Fan\" voted to give the game a 22.0 out of 30 score in a poll, readers of the Japanese \"Sega Saturn Magazine\" voted to give the title a 6.1858 out of 10 score in another poll, ranking at the number 4 and 380 spots respectively, indicating a popular but middling following.\n\"Electronic Gaming Monthly\"s reviewers praised the realistic-looking graphics, sound, gameplay and addition of season play and password but others found \"Tommy Lasorda Baseball\" to be a standard baseball game similar to others on the market. \"Aktueller Software Markt\"s Torsten Blum gave the game a mixed outlook, noting the difficult AI and stating that both visual design and sprite animations ranged from mediocre to good but commended its realism and sound. \"Joystick\"s Jean-Marc Demoly gave positive remarks to the title's graphics, animations, sound and realism. \"Tilt\"s Alain Huyghues-Lacour noted that the game may turn off novice players due to its difficulty but commented that the graphical quality is stimulating. \"Sega Power\"s Andy Smith and Steve Jarratt regarded it as a decent rendition of the sport, commending the use of multiple perspectives, music, number of leagues, two-player mode and smooth gameplay but criticized said gameplay for being luck-based, as well as the lack of visual variety and crowd noise, recommending \"HardBall!\" instead. Likewise, \"Computer and Video Games\" Julian Rignall and Robert Swan noted that the AI was tough but felt that the game had a more arcade-style approach of baseball.\n\"Raze\"s Les Ellis praised the character animations, detailed graphics, music, voice samples and addictive two-player mode. \"Sega Pro\" regarded it as one of the best baseball games on the Mega Drive, commending features such as full control of both batters and pitchers. \"Play Time\"s Oliver Menne felt that the title's visuals left little to be desired and criticized the character animations but was fascinated by the clear voice samples and commended its gameplay, recommending it to baseball fans and people interested in the sport. \"Mega Drive Advanced Gaming\" stated that \"Super League\" was an adequate and reasonable baseball simulator but not as good as \"R.B.I. Baseball 4\". Jiří Frkal of Czech magazine \"Score\" gave positive remarks to the graphics and smooth character animations, while commenting that both music and sound complemented its atmosphere."

        "text": "The Great Britain men's national basketball team (also known as GB Basketball or GB) represents Great Britain in international basketball competitions. The national team is administered by British Basketball.\nThe current governing body for the Great Britain team was formed by the national federations of England (Basketball England), Scotland (Basketballscotland), and Wales (Basketball Wales) on 1 December 2006. Prior to the merger, England, Scotland, and Wales competed independently during international play except for Olympic events.\nGreat Britain have qualified for the top European tournament, EuroBasket, five times (2009, 2011, 2013, 2017, 2022). Although before or since the alliance, no British team in history has ever qualified for the FIBA World Cup. However, Great Britain has competed at the Olympic Games twice (1948, 2012), in which they hosted.\nHistory.\n1948 London Olympics.\nThe Great Britain national team debuted as the host for the 1948 London Olympics. The team was placed into Group A to begin the tournament. Although with the advantage of being at home on their side, the team did not capitalize. Great Britain were thoroughly outplayed in their first fixture against Uruguay, and eventually finished last in group play at (0–5). The outcome relegated the national team to the classification round. There they recorded their first tournament victory against Ireland, but fell in their next two matches, to wrap up the event at (1–7) overall.\n1960-1992 Olympic Qualifying.\nAfter hosting the 1948 Olympic Games, Great Britain were not represented at the Olympic tournament in 1952 or 1956 due to FIBA and the IOC not yet holding a qualifying event. Although spanning from 1960 to 1992, Great Britain failed to qualify for the competition.\nBritish Basketball formed 2006.\nAfter London won the right to host the 2012 Summer Olympics, the organisers wanted competitive teams in every sport, including basketball. A Great Britain side was formed for the first time since 1992 on 1 December 2006. The new team secured the help of the NBA's Chicago Bulls' star Luol Deng, as he led the national team to promotion from EuroBasket Division B to Division A. FIBA stated that Great Britain had to improve their competitiveness prior to being granted the spot in the Olympic tournament that would normally be reserved for the host nation.\nEuroBasket 2009.\nIn Great Britain's first cycle at the Division A level in 2008, they went through qualification for the EuroBasket 2009. The team would eventually finish on top of Group D, which also included Bosnia and Herzegovina, Czech Republic and Israel to qualify for the finals.\nAt the first Euro finals for Great Britain after the formation of British Basketball, the national team were drawn into a tough Group C, which featured European heavyweights Spain, and Serbia along with a feisty Slovenia squad. However, the team was overmatched by the international experience those national sides possessed, and ultimately finished at the bottom of the group at (0–3) to be eliminated.\nEuroBasket 2011.\nDuring August 2010, Great Britain began their qualification campaign for EuroBasket 2011. The team was drawn into Group B, containing Bosnia and Herzegovina, Hungary, Macedonia, and Ukraine. Great Britain went on to finish at the top of the group, and qualified for their second appearance at the finals overall. Heading into their second Euro finals appearance, the British were determined to display a better performance than in 2009. Being drawn into the tournament's Group A, the mindset was different this time around. Many of the players from the previous finals appearance had more experience, which the team used as optimism entering 2011. In the opening match for Great Britain, they were pitted against the host Lithuania. However, Luol Deng, and his game high 25 points for the British was not enough to pull the upset as the team fell to (0–1).\nFollowing Great Britain's tough opening match loss to the Lithuanians, the British were handed two heavy defeats in their next two fixtures against Turkey, and Spain.\nHowever, heading into their fourth match of group play Team GB would earn their first ever victory at the Euro finals, as they defeated Portugal 85–73. 24 hours after their first win, the team turned around and were victorious again; this time over Poland 88–81. Unfortunately, at a record of (2–3) in group play it would not be enough for Great Britain to advance.\n2012 London Olympics.\nOn 13 March 2011, FIBA voted 17–3 in favour of Great Britain receiving their host nation spot at the 2012 London Olympics with one condition, they had until 30 June 2012 to decide on whether to merge the three nations that make up the team or disband after the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.\nOn 21 June 2012, Basketball Wales confirmed their intent to reject the proposed merger on the grounds that the arrangement was always intended to be temporary in the build-up to the London Olympics, and that it would not be in the best interests for the sport in Wales for the country to forfeit its national team, when the GB team contained no Welsh players.\nFor the 2012 Olympic Games, Great Britain was awarded automatic qualification. Entering the group stage, Great Britain struggled in their first two matches against Russia and Brazil, which resulted in loses. In Great Britain's third match of the tournament, they were up against a strong Spain side. However, after a monumental effort from the British, which nearly saw the team pull off a historic upset; they would ultimately succumb to the eventual tournament runners-up 79–78. After the draining loss, Great Britain were completely overwhelmed in their fourth fixture of the tournament; in a disastrous defeat to Australia 75–106. In their final group play game, Great Britain faced China, with both teams already unable to progress to the knockout stage. Team GB would win the game 90–58, making it only the second Olympic victory all-time for Great Britain. Throughout the tournament British star Luol Deng played 173 minutes, more than any other player and also came in the top ten for points and assists.\nEuroBasket 2013.\nIn June 2013, Brooklyn Nets assistant coach Joe Prunty was announced as the new head coach of the national team, following the resignation of Chris Finch.\nHaving participated in the previous Olympic tournament, Great Britain qualified automatically for EuroBasket 2013 in Slovenia. They went into the finals short-handed: Luol Deng was recovering from illness, Pops Mensah-Bonsu did not participate due to an injury and Joel Freeland was also absent, citing commitments with his club. Despite this, Great Britain won their first match against Israel in overtime, but subsequently lost to France and Belgium. Winning their fourth group game against favoured Germany put them on the verge of advancing to the second round of the tournament for the first time in their history. The team went into their final group game against Ukraine needing to win, but Ukraine had been performing better than expected and dispatched Britain 87–68. The team finished equaling their record from the previous tournament, with Daniel Clark leading Great Britain in scoring and defence.\nFollowing their tournament exit it was announced that the governing body for British sports, UK Sport, were to cut the funding for the team after failing to reach the agreed-upon minimum final placing in the tournament. Funding from UK Sport would have been used to aid the team's efforts to qualify for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.\nEuroBasket 2015 qualification.\nFor qualification to the 2015 Euro finals, a defeat to Iceland on 20 August meant that the team had failed to qualify for the tournament. This outcome was largely attributed to British Basketball no longer receiving funding from UK Sport; efficiencies had to be made, including cancelling training camps. Further, the team was unable to secure the participation of players such as Luol Deng due to insurance costs, which in turn affected performance, and put the future of the Great Britain team in doubt. Forward Kieron Achara spoke out about how the financial struggles had affected the team.\nEuroBasket 2017.\nAfter missing the Euro finals in 2015, Great Britain were eager to qualify for EuroBasket 2017. During the qualifiers, the team was placed into Group G, where they needed to finish in the top two in their group to reach qualification. The team eventually succeeded in the process, only finishing behind Hungary, to reach the tournament for the fourth time.\nAt the finals, Great Britain were drawn in the \"group of death\" with Belgium, Latvia, Russia, Serbia, and one of the tournament hosts, Turkey. Despite some close performances, GB lost all five of their matches to finish at the bottom of Group D.\nAfter the tournament Tony Garbelotto took over as head coach of the national team from Joe Prunty.\n2019 FIBA World Cup qualification.\nFor the process to reach the 2019 FIBA World Cup, Great Britain was placed into Group H during the first round of World Cup qualifiers. However, in their first match at home against Greece, the team would fall in a crushing hard fought affair in overtime 92–95. In their next qualifying fixture, the team would drop another one, on the road this time at Estonia. After the loss, Tony Garbelotto resigned as head coach of Great Britain, and was replaced by Alberto Lorenzo, prior to their next match which they lost at Israel; during the February qualifying window. With an (0–3) record, the team prepared for Greece once again, this time on the road. Although the outcome was similar, another loss for Great Britain, and putting the team in serious danger of being eliminated.\nHeading into the final window of the first round of qualifiers, the team notched their first victory during World Cup qualifying at home against Estonia. With a little momentum on their side, all the team needed to do was defeat Israel in the final match of group play. Ultimately, the team would come up short, losing in a close match at home 59–67, erasing any chance for Great Britain to advance.\n2020s–present.\nAfter Great Britain successfully made it through pre-qualifying for the EuroBasket 2022, at an overall record of (7–1), the team advanced to the final round of qualifiers. Following a defeat in their opening fixture away to Montenegro 81–74, Great Britain earned a tough victory at home against Germany 81–73. The team went on to win three of their next four matches during the qualifying period, including a second win over Germany, which came at the buzzer to clinch a place into the finals. Drawn into Group C at the tournament, however, Great Britain would go winless for the second consecutive EuroBasket to finish in last place.\nTeam.\nCurrent roster.\nRoster for the EuroBasket 2025 Qualifiers matches on 23 and 26 February 2024 against Netherlands and Czech Republic.\nPast rosters.\n1948 Olympic Games: finished 20th among 23 teams\n3 Lionel Price, 4 Robert Norris, 5 Stanley Weston, 6 Trevor Davies, 7 Malcolm Finlay (C), 8 Colin Hunt, 9 Frank Cole, 10 Douglas Legg,&lt;br&gt;11 Ronald Legg, 12 Harry Weston, 13 Alex Eke, 14 Stanley McMeekan, 15 Sydney McMeekan (Coach: Malcolm Finlay)\n2009 EuroBasket: finished 13th among 16 teams\n4 Jarrett Hart, 5 Kieron Achara, 6 Mike Lenzly, 7 Pops Mensah-Bonsu, 8 Andrew Sullivan (C), 9 Nick George, 10 Robert Archibald,&lt;br&gt;11 Joel Freeland, 12 Nate Reinking, 13 Daniel Clark, 14 Flinder Boyd, 15 Andrew Betts (Coach: Chris Finch)\n2011 EuroBasket: finished 13th among 24 teams\n4 Ogo Adegboye, 5 Andrew Lawrence, 6 Mike Lenzly, 7 Devon van Oostrum, 8 Andrew Sullivan (C), 9 Luol Deng, 10 Robert Archibald,&lt;br&gt;11 Joel Freeland, 12 Nate Reinking, 13 Daniel Clark, 14 Eric Boateng, 15 Kyle Johnson (Coach: Chris Finch)\n2012 Olympic Games: finished 9th among 12 teams\n4 Kieron Achara, 5 Andrew Lawrence, 6 Mike Lenzly, 7 Pops Mensah-Bonsu, 8 Andrew Sullivan (C), 9 Luol Deng (C),&lt;br&gt;10 Robert Archibald, 11 Joel Freeland, 12 Nate Reinking, 13 Daniel Clark, 14 Kyle Johnson, 15 Eric Boateng (Coach: Chris Finch)\n2013 EuroBasket: finished 13th among 24 teams\n4 Kieron Achara, 5 Andrew Lawrence, 6 Justin Robinson, 7 Devon van Oostrum, 8 Andrew Sullivan (C), 9 Gareth Murray,&lt;br&gt;10 Myles Hesson, 11 Alasdair Fraser, 12 Daniel Clark, 13 Ogo Adegboye, 14 Eric Boateng, 15 Kyle Johnson (Coach: Joe Prunty)\n2017 EuroBasket: finished 22nd among 24 teams\n0 Jules Dang-Akodo, 1 Kyle Johnson, 3 Ben Mockford, 4 Andrew Lawrence, 5 Teddy Okereafor, 10 Daniel Clark, 11 Gareth Murray,&lt;br&gt;13 Eric Boateng, 19 Luke Nelson, 20 Kieron Achara (C), 26 Gabriel Olaseni, 44 Kofi Josephs (Coach: Joe Prunty)\n2022 EuroBasket: finished 24th among 24 teams\n00 Ovie Soko, 0 Gabriel Olaseni, 3 Ben Mockford, 6 Luke Nelson, 10 Daniel Clark (C), 13 Kavell Bigby-Williams, 22 Myles Hesson,&lt;br&gt;23 Dwayne Lautier-Ogunleye, 24 Carl Wheatle, 32 Patrick Whelan, 33 Jamell Anderson, 77 Devon van Oostrum (Coach: Nate Reinking)"

Quite suitable, I thought\".\nAfter the end of the Second World War he joined the family business and combined his career with playing rugby for Harlequins who he joined in 1945, emerging in the post-war years alongside the likes of Alan Grimsdell, Hugh Forbes and Roger ‘Chalky’ Whyte who were said to have \"added to the strength and flair of the side\". From 1952 to 1954 'Brooky' captained Harlequins, whilst further honours were gained as he played for Surrey (captain 1950–52) and London Counties. A back-row player, in his 16 years with Harlequins he made 161 appearances for the 1XV scoring a total of 43 points including 13 tries.\nDuring his playing career Brooks combined his playing exploits with work as the press officer for Harlequins (and Surrey RFU), and he went on to manage Quins on their 1956 tour of Romania which \"would establish “Brooky’s” reputation as a tour manager who could get out of seemingly hopeless situations with the appropriate diplomatic touch\". A further Quins tour, this one to South Africa, followed in 1966 with Brooks as manager which proved to be a dress-rehearsal for what was to follow two years later.\n\"Wrecker\", as he came to be known and who was described by Roger Young as \" rugby's answer to Oliver Reed...who like nothing better than a party each night...\" was to manage the Lions on their 1968 tour to South Africa where they began with 6 opening provincial wins including a 32–6 victory over Rhodesia a fixture which he was instrumental in arranging as he refused to take delivery of telegram stating the team was not to go. This promising start to the tour was not to last though as the Springboks were ready for them in Pretoria and got the better of the Lions to record a 25–20 victory in the first Test. The team went on to win 15 of their 16 provincial games but the Springboks prevailed in the four match Test series 3–0 with 1 match drawn.\nLater in life David would go on to be President of Surrey (1971–73) and in time became President of the RFU from 1981 to 1982 during which time he advocated the introduction of a club championship and the using sponsorship in the 'right way' for the good of the game. He never forgot that sport was something to be enjoyed maintaining that \"rugby...is a leisure pursuit, not a business\".\nHe became a Life President of Harlequins in 1990.\nAway from rugby having made his living in the family fruit business he went on to become managing director of banana importer Geest Industries before, in 1976, setting up his own fruit import business; he retired in 1990. In 1950 he married Anne Jefferson (d.1996) with who he had two sons and two daughters. David's youngest grandson Mark Tampin has played professional rugby for Rotherham Titans, Jersey Reds, Ealing Trailfinders and currently represents Newcastle Falcons."

He represented the Wallabies in three Tests in 1904 and the Kangaroos in three Tests on the first tour of Great Britain in 1908–09.\nRugby union career.\nIn Australia.\nBorn in 1879 at Cook's Hill, Newcastle, New South Wales he played rugby for the Norwood and Carlton clubs usually as a backrower and at times at fly-half.\nIn 1899 Walsh represented Northern District (Newcastle &amp; Hunter) against the first touring British team in a match at Newcastle. In 1903 he represented Combined Country against Metropolis (Sydney City) and Combined Country against New Zealand. He also represented New South Wales against Queensland that year.\nIn 1904 he again represented Northern District against the touring British team and also represented New South Wales. He scored NSW's first try against Queensland and NSW's first try against the visiting British side in Sydney. That year he made his Wallaby début as a number 8, playing in all three Tests against the touring British. In 1905 he represented NSW against Queensland. The rugby public were surprised when he missed selection for the national side to New Zealand. \"Walsh's exclusion is simply a Chinese Puzzle\".\nAustralian rules spell.\nDisappointed he left Australia, first going to Johannesburg, South Africa where he was Vice Captain of the Commonwealth football team, premiers in the 1905 Australian Football League Competition. That trophy is currently held at the Australian Gallery of Sport and Olympic Museum at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. In 1905 Australian Rules football was played in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.\nRugby union in New Zealand.\nIn 1906 he moved to Auckland, New Zealand to play rugby for Parnell in the Auckland competition which featured many 1905 All Blacks who had toured Great Britain sweeping all before them aside from a sole loss to Wales.\nIn 1907 Walsh was chosen in the Auckland representative team to tour Southland New Zealand. In 1908 he Played for Auckland's City club, gaining an impressive reputation. \"On Saturday's play Walsh stood out as being the best player in the Senior Grade Competition. He secured three tries\"; \"Walsh was the star of the forward division, not even being overshadowed by H.Hayward\"; \"...the outstanding men in the front division being Walsh (the best forward on the ground) Seeling, Herring and J.Magee.\". He looked set for All Black selection.\nA cablegram from J.J.Giltinan offering the prospects of a Tour to Great Britain as a member of the pioneer Kangaroo rugby league side lured him back to Australia.\nRugby league career.\nOn return to Australia after spending the last three years in New Zealand Walsh played his first rugby league match for Queensland against New South Wales. He played for the Newcastle club in the 1908 New South Wales Rugby Football League season. He gained National selection for the inaugural 1908–09 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain.\nHe travelled to England in a second ship (the Salamis) and was reported to have brought the live kangaroo mascot with him. He played in all three Tests of the tour as a Front Rower. His rugby league international début in the 1st Test of 1908 in London along with Alex Burdon saw them collectively become Australia's eighth and ninth dual code rugby internationals. Pat Walsh played twenty-nine matches on the tour scoring nine tries.\nAfter the tour he remained in England accepting an offer from the Huddersfield Club where he played from 1909 to 1911 and built a reputation as one of the finest forwards in England.

Colombia was placed in Group A with Romania, USA, and Switzerland. Before the World Cup began however the Colombians found themselves in a problematic situation. Colombia's preparations were conducted against a backdrop of rumors that betting syndicates and drug cartels were exercising their influence over the squad. Coach Francisco Maturana was reported to have received death threats over matters of team selection. Gabriel Jaime Gomez Jaramillo (known as \"Barabas\") was dropped from the squad presumably because of threats, with Hernán Gaviria taking his place.\nWhatever the truth, Colombia's players were affected. They looked edgy and unfocused as they suffered a shock 3–1 loss in their opening game against Romania.\nColombia: 1-3 :Romania.\nThe match between Colombia and Romania was the first game for either side in the group phase. Colombia began the match well and were allowed a great deal of possession by the Romanians who seemed content to defend in depth. Some of the Colombians football was breathtaking, demonstrating their superior ball play. However, against the run of play, Romania took the lead in the 16th minute with their first attack of the match when Florin Raducioiu took on three defenders before firing home a low shot past goalkeeper Oscar Cordoba. The Colombians kept on showing off their dazzling skills and were constantly threatening the equaliser, however on the half-hour mark, Gheorghe Hagi made it 2-0 when he noticed Cordoba out of position and dipped a cross over his head into the net. The Colombians had excellent opportunities however the Romanian keeper, Stelea kept the Romanian lead intact with a string of brilliant saves until Valencia pulled a goal back for the Colombians in the 43rd minute when he headed in a corner from Perez. In the second half, The Colombians put the Romanians under a great deal of pressure with Stelea called upon to prevent goal-bound attempts from Asprilla and Alvarez before Florin Raducioiu put the result beyond doubt with his second goal in the final few minutes. Romania won this encounter 3–1, and the Colombians knew victory against USA in their following match would be vital if they were to progress any further.\nUnited States: 2-1 :Colombia.\nNonetheless, the most crucial game in Group A for Colombia. The USA knew they weren't favorites but played with passion and determination while Colombia was focused on attacking their opponents in order to get an early goal. As the game started off, the Americans put up fierce resistance as Colombia launched several attacks. The Americans survived an early scare when Marcelo Balboa had to clear the ball out of the goal's mouth after goalkeeper Tony Meola had failed to save the shot from Anthony de Avila. Balboa and Alexi Lalas held the creative Colombians at bay in the center of the defense while Earnie Stewart and John Harkes led several counterattacks against Colombia. In the 35th minute, John Harkes crossed the ball towards Earnie Stewart, and it was deflected by Colombian defender Andres Escobar into the net to give the U.S. a shocking 1–0 lead. Andres Escobar was stretching out to cut the cross and clear the ball out of the penalty area. Celebrations went wild as the USA took the lead. Colombia continued its attacks while Andres Escobar was determined to repair his error. In the 56th minute, Tab Ramos fired a shot through Colombia's defense, and Earnie Stewart was there to tap it in past Oscar Cordoba for the 2–0 lead. Even though Adolfo Valencia scored a late goal for Colombia, the U.S. claimed their victory.\nSwitzerland: 0-2 :Colombia.\nWith two defeats in their opening matches, Colombia's only hope to reach the 2nd Round was to defeat Switzerland and hope Romania would lose against the US in order to end in third place due to goal differences. Due to the format of the 1994 World Cup, the four best third-place finishers would advance. A header by Gavaria and a shot by Lozano gave Colombia a 2–0 victory over Switzerland. However, news that Romania had won against the US meant Colombia was out and going home. Even if the US had beaten Romania, the two goal margin over Switzerland would have been insufficient for Colombia to advance as they would have finished fifth among third place teams behind Russia, who finished with a better goal difference.\nSix days later, on July 2, Escobar was shot to death outside a bar in a Medellín suburb. According to Escobar's girlfriend, the killer shouted \"¡Gooooooooooooool!\" (mimicking South American sporting commentators for their calls after a goal is scored) for each of the 12 bullets fired. The murder was widely believed to be retribution for the own goal scored in the game against the United States.\nThat goal specifically is what had caused Andres Escobar to bring humiliation to the entire nation, mainly to Colombia. This was also what had let him to his tragic death because it had cost many cartel (his killer) to lose money from betting on him and created a commotion to the country of Colombia. Whether it was intentional or not Andres Escobars story was a true tragic one. He's murder was a reminder to those in Colombia that who exactly were the real ones in power (the cartels).\n1994 FIFA World Cup - Group A [Final Standings].\nGroup A - Final Standings"

The club has two eighteen-hole courses appropriately called the \"Old Course\" and the \"New Course\". The club has played host to many championships, both amateur and professional. The old and new courses were designed by Old Tom Morris and Henry Cotton respectively.\nClub history.\nThe first attempt to set up a golf club in Lossiemouth was in 1875, when a seven-hole course was established in the Stotfield area. This club failed after a few years, and it wasn't until 30 March 1889 that the present club was officially opened. At that time, the club had 82 members who were mostly from Elgin, the county capital, some 6 miles to the south. Captain James Brander of Pitgaveny, also a founding member, leased the land to the club and Old Tom Morris the St Andrews professional designed the layout. Initially, there were only 16 holes but within a year the course was extended to 18 by leasing land from Sir William Gordon Cumming. By 1897, the membership had grown to around 320, 85 of which were ladies. The membership stood at 635 in 1904, 135 being ladies. In 1905 the ladies got their own 9-hole Ladies Relief course. The new 18-hole course, designed by Sir Henry Cotton, opened in 1979 and incorporated the 9-hole course. Membership has now grown to more than 1700.\nThe club found itself in a political dispute during the First World War over the membership of Ramsay MacDonald, who was from Lossiemouth and then an outspoken anti-war Labour MP. MacDonald was a keen golfer and his sons also played at the club, but in August 1915 a group of members submitted a motion to remove his name from the roll of members on the grounds that the club's character was damaged. The council of the club refused to take any action, with MacDonald himself objecting that they were not elected to take political judgments. However, a year later, a new motion was submitted by some 30 members who had not signed the previous motion; they asserted that the failure to take action had caused other members to resign. A special meeting was held in the Burgh court house in Elgin on 1 September 1916 at which a London barrister moved that MacDonald had forfeited his right to membership; the motion was carried by 73 to 24. MacDonald regretted that their actions had held the club up to ridicule and contempt and never played there again. An attempt to rescind the motion in July 1924 (when MacDonald was Prime Minister) failed to secure the necessary two-thirds majority. A further attempt in July 1929 was successful but Macdonald, having felt the initial expulsion deeply, refused this offer."

        "text": "Patrick Edward \"Bunny\" Larkin (March 17, 1882 – August 18, 1948) was an American physician, college football coach, and baseball manager. He served as a co-head coach alongside William Lang for the Maryland Agricultural College (now the University of Maryland) in 1909. Larkin was also an assistant football coach at Cornell University, the Carlisle Indian Industrial School, and Georgetown University. He worked for many years as a team physician for the Washington Senators baseball team.\nEarly life.\nLarkin was born on March 17, 1882, in Ithaca, New York, where he received his early education. He played as a quarterback for Ithaca High School. Larkin played baseball as a catcher for the Haverling team. He enrolled at Cornell University for his undergraduate education in 1902, and played on the football team. The \"Elmira Morning Telegram\" wrote, \"He was a fast, tricky end, who knew all of the possibilities of the position.\"\nLarkin attended the Georgetown University School of Medicine, from which he graduated in 1908. He earned a varsity letter on the Georgetown football team in 1904. After college, Larkin held an internship with the Providence Hospital in Washington, D.C.\nCoaching career.\nUpon the expiration of his college athletic eligibility, Larkin coached football as an assistant at Cornell. In 1907, he served as an assistant at the Carlisle Indian Industrial School under head coach Glenn \"Pop\" Warner, and helped coach the line and played on the practice team at Georgetown. Bill Stern later described Larkin's coaching as \"a gem of brevity and logic\". One season at Carlisle, Larkin explained to his players the game: \"Boys, football is like this: When white man has ball, knock down white man. When Indian has ball, knock down white man.\" At Carlisle, he \"drilled Warner's Indians to look after Chicago's forward passes and fake plays\".\nHe turned down the opportunity to coach at Georgetown for the 1908 season despite strong support from the school's alumni and students. He instead coached the ends at Cornell as the \"head field coach\". In October, he spent a week confined with blood poisoning before returning to the sidelines. In 1906 and 1907, Larkin also managed the DuBois, Pennsylvania based DuBois Miners baseball club of the Interstate League, having played baseball in the minor leagues beginning in 1904.\nLarkin worked for many years as the club physician for the Washington Senators baseball team. He was also the team physician for the Georgetown football program. In 1909, while also working for the Senators, Larkin assisted Bill Lang as co-head coach at the Maryland Agricultural College (now the University of Maryland). The team finished the season with a 2–5 record.\nIn 1911, Larkin coached the ends at Carlisle, and then assisted Ray Van Orman in coaching the ends at Cornell. During the 1913 season, Warner, a long-time friend, lent his assistant and former Carlisle star Albert Exendine to coach the Georgetown football team in its final games as a favor to Larkin. Exendine served as head coach at Georgetown for nine more seasons. Larkin suffered a brief illness and died on August 18, 1948."

Cox played four more seasons for the Washington Redskins. Cox was one of the last straight-ahead style placekickers in the National Football League. \nCox transferred to the University of Arkansas from Tulsa University following the 1977 season. After sitting out 1978 due to NCAA transfer rules, Cox added the punting job to his kicking duties. Steve was named All-Southwest Conference in 1979 and 1980, and was also named an All-American in 1980 by the UPI, the Sporting News, College &amp; Pro Football Newsweekly, and Football News after leading the nation in punting by averaging 46.5 yards per punt. \nCox was inducted into the Arkansas Sports Hall of Fame in 2004. \nThough primarily a punter and kickoff specialist, Cox was also used for long field goal attempts. On October 21, 1984, Cox kicked a 60-yard field goal in a game against Cincinnati. The kick was the second-longest field goal at the time (behind Tom Dempsey's record kick), but has since been matched by Morten Andersen, Rob Bironas, and Dan Carpenter and surpassed by Justin Tucker, Jason Elam, Matt Bryant, David Akers and twice by Sebastian Janikowski. Cox's kick remains one of only 26 field goals of 60 yards or more in NFL history and one of only two which was done with the straight-ahead style (the other being Tom Dempsey).\nCox earned a Super Bowl ring with the Washington Redskins in Super Bowl XXII. Cox punted four times and kicked off seven times for the Redskins."

He served as the head football coach at Slippery Rock University of Pennsylvania (1981), Rice University (1989–1993), Duke University (1994–1998), and Lenoir–Rhyne University (2007–2010), compiling a career record of 59–104–1.\nCoaching career.\nGoldsmith is perhaps best known for his head coaching stints at two NCAA Division I football programs: Rice and Duke. He was recognized as the 1992 Sports Illustrated National NCAA Football Coach of the Year for leading Rice to within one win of a bowl game. The Owls finished 6-5 and tied for second in the Southwest Conference, their best showing in conference play in 28 years. However, a 61-32 rout at the hands of intercity rival Houston left them out of a bowl.\nPrimarily on the strength of turning the Rice program around, he was hired at Duke in 1994, where he won the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award in his first season after leading the Blue Devils to their first winning season in six years, and only their eighth winning season in 30 years. However, this momentum did not last, and within two years the Blue Devils had crumbled to the second winless season in school history. Goldsmith was fired by Duke athletics director Joe Alleva just a year into Alleva's tenure after recording only nine wins during his last four seasons, including only three in Atlantic Coast Conference play.\nIn addition, under Goldsmith's tenure, Duke's football program was ordered to pay walk-on kicker, Heather Sue Mercer, $2,000,001 in nominal and punitive damages for its discriminatory treatment of her during her time on the team. A federal jury found that Mercer was afforded less of an opportunity to practice and compete than other 'similarly situated' players (other walk-on kickers). Her allegations also included sexist statements made to her by Goldsmith. (See \"Mercer v. Duke University\", 190 F.3d 643 (4th Cir. 1999).\nGoldsmith's final coaching job was as the 18th head football coach for Lenoir–Rhyne University, an NCAA Division II school in Hickory, North Carolina. Hired on November 28, 2006, Goldsmith arrived at Lenoir-Rhyne fresh off a successful four-year run at Franklin High School in Franklin, North Carolina, where he compiled an overall win–loss record of 47–15. Goldsmith retired on May 3, 2011."

        "text": "The CCHA Tournament is the conference tournament for the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA), an NCAA Division I men's ice hockey conference that originally operated from 1971 to 2013 and has been revived effective in 2021. The winner of the tournament receives an automatic berth into the NCAA Tournament. The winner of the tournament also receives the Mason Cup, which was first presented in 2001. In other years, the trophy was known as the CCHA Tournament Championship Trophy.\nThe tournament was first held in 1972, the first year of conference play. It was held at The Arena in St. Louis, Missouri from 1972 to 1977. From 1978 to 1981, the CCHA Tournament was held at the rink of the higher seed. Starting in 1982, the CCHA Tournament first round was held at the rink of the higher seed with Joe Louis Arena in Detroit, Michigan hosting the CCHA Tournament semifinals and finals. From 1993 to 1994 and 2002–05, the CCHA championship format had six teams competing at Joe Louis Arena with the bottom four teams competing for the third and fourth spots in the semifinals.\nIn February 2020, seven schools that had announced several months earlier that they would leave the Western Collegiate Hockey Association after the 2020–21 season announced that they would form a new CCHA, with the 2021–22 season as the first for the revived league. The tournament resumed in 2022 with the Mason Cup once again being awarded to the tournament champion.\nCCHA Men's Ice Hockey Tournament champions.\nFormats.\nThe CCHA Tournament format begins as a single-game elimination two-round format.\nA round-robin championship format was adopted. Although not a member of the CCHA's Division I, Western Michigan is invited as the fourth team in the CCHA Tournament.\nThe single-game elimination format returns. Western Michigan is invited for a second year as the fourth team in the CCHA Tournament.\nChampionship game is changed to a two-game, total-goals series.\nAll tournament rounds are changed to a two-game, total-goals series.\nFirst round series remain a two-game, total-goals series. Semifinals and finals are changed to single-game elimination format. The CCHA Tournament is expanded from four teams to eight teams in a three-round format.\nFirst round series changed to a best two-of-three format. Semifinals and finals remain single-game elimination.\nWith the addition of Kent State and Notre Dame to the league and Alaska as an affiliate member, the tournament expanded to 12 teams. A quarterfinal at Joe Louis Arena narrows the field from six to four. Alaska is placed in the tournament by team choice. In order, the top six teams select their opponent for the first round among the bottom five teams and Alaska. The CCHA eliminates the consolation game.\nThe tournament retracts to 10 teams. A highest seed-hosts, midweek play-in game narrows the field from five to four.\nTournament format returns to eight teams.\nThe tournament field expands back to 10 along with the midweek play-in game.\nAll 12 teams qualify for the tournament with a quarterfinal at Joe Louis Arena narrowing the field from six to four. The consolation game returns to boost records and rankings for NCAA Tournament selection.\nAll 11 league members qualified for the tournament. A four-round format was introduced beginning in 2006 with the top five seeds receiving byes and the remaining six teams playing in an on-campus best two-of-three first round series. After the first round, the field was reseeded for the quarterfinal round for an on-campus best two-of-three series. The remaining four teams were reseeded for the CCHA Championship at Joe Louis Arena in Detroit.\nThe revived CCHA tournament involves all eight members, seeded according to regular-season conference records. The top four teams host best-of-three series in the opening round, matched in the standard format of 1–8, 2–7, 3–6, and 4–5. The semifinals consist of single games hosted by the top two surviving seeds. The final is also a single game, hosted by the top remaining seed.\n\"Modern Era\".\nIn 1981–82, four teams from the WCHA (Michigan, Michigan State, Michigan Tech and Notre Dame) defected to the CCHA. The four teams brought their long, storied history with 12 combined NCAA National Championships giving the young, up-start league instant credibility. The tournament championship was moved from small on-campus rinks to Joe Louis Arena, home of the NHL's Detroit Red Wings. These events give the league a distinct turning point at which the \"Modern Era\" of the CCHA Tournament begins.\n\"Road to the Joe\".\nCommissioner Bill Beagan coined the phrase \"Road to the Joe\" in describing the CCHA Tournament in 1985–86. The phrase is commonly used in reference to the CCHA Tournament.\n\"Super Six\".\nWith the tournament expanding to 12 teams in 2001–02, the CCHA adopted the name \"Super Six\" in reference to the six teams who advance past the first round to the CCHA championships at Joe Louis Arena. The name was dropped following the 2005 season when the CCHA championships were reduced back to four teams."

        "text": "The individual show jumping was an equestrian event held as part of the Equestrian at the 1964 Summer Olympics programme. The event was held on 24 October. There were 46 competitors from 17 nations. Each nation could have up to three riders. The event was won by Pierre Jonquères d'Oriola of France, the first rider to win two gold medals in individual jumping; he did so 12 years apart, with his first in 1952. It was France's third gold medal in the event overall, moving out of a tie with Italy at two for most all-time (counting Germany and the United Team of Germany separately). Hermann Schridde, representing the United Team of Germany, took silver. Great Britain earned its second consecutive bronze in the event, this time with Peter Robeson taking the honors.\nBackground.\nThis was the 12th appearance of the event, which had first been held at the 1900 Summer Olympics and has been held at every Summer Olympics at which equestrian sports have been featured (that is, excluding 1896, 1904, and 1908). It is the oldest event on the current programme, the only one that was held in 1900. After the team and individual results were separated in 1960 for the first time since 1920, the 1964 competition returned to using the same results for both events.\nFour of the top 10 riders from the 1960 competition returned: gold medalist (and 1956 silver medalist) Raimondo D'Inzeo of Italy, silver medalist (and 1956 bronze medalist) Piero D'Inzeo of Italy, bronze medalist David Broome of Great Britain, and fifth-place finisher (and 1956 gold medalist) Hans Günter Winkler of the United Team of Germany. The D'Inzeo brothers were competing in their fifth Games; they would be the first people to compete in eight. Also returning was 1952 gold medalist Pierre Jonquéres d'Oriola of France, in his fourth Games. The five men who had won, or would win, the first seven World Championships were present: Paco Goyoaga of Spain (1953), Winkler (1954 and 1955), Raimondo D'Inzeo (1956 and 1960), Jonquéres d'Oriola (1966), and Broome (1970). \nFor the first time, no nations made their debut in the event. France competed for the 11th time, most of any nation, having missed the individual jumping only in 1932.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition used the two-round format introduced in 1952. The scores from the two rounds were summed to give a final total. The team and individual jumping competitions used the same results. \nThe course was 780 metres long with 14 obstacles, including a double jump and a triple jump for 17 total jumps. The last two obstacles were a 5 metre wide water jump and a large oxer. Penalty points were received for obstacle faults (3, 4, 6, or 8 points based on severity) or exceeding the time limit (0.25 points per second or fraction thereof over the limit). A third refusal or jumping an obstacle out of order resulted in elimination.\nResults.\nThe tie for third place was broken by a jump-off. Robeson scored a 0.00 penalty in that jump-off to take 3rd, while Fahey's 8.00 penalty put him in 4th. Other ties were not broken."

Final standings were based on the sum of all four runs for each team. On the 19th, in runs 1 and 2, they posted a time of 55.57 seconds and 55.25 seconds, respectively. At the end of the first day, they were ranked 42nd out of 43 sleds. On the second day, they posted run times of 55.06 and 55.16 seconds.

This put him in 71st place out of 72 competitors who finished the race. Frank-Peter Roetsch of East Germany won the gold medal in a time of 25 minutes and 8.1 seconds; the silver and bronze medals were both won by biathletes from the Soviet Union, Valeriy Medvedtsev and Sergei Tchepikov respectively."

The Swazi delegation consisted of a single competitor, the alpine skier Keith Fraser, who competed in the slalom, where he failed to finish the first run; in the giant slalom, where he came 63rd; and in the super-G, finishing 79th.\nBackground.\nThe Swaziland Olympic and Commonwealth Games Association was recognized by the International Olympic Committee on 1 January 1972. Swaziland first sent a delegation to the Summer Olympic Games at the 1972 Summer Olympics, and these Albertville Games were their first, and of 2018, only appearance at a Winter Olympic Games. The 1992 Winter Olympics were held from 8–23 February 1992, a total of 1,801 athletes representing 64 National Olympic Committees took part. The only competitor sent to Albertville by Swaziland was alpine skier Keith Fraser. He was chosen as the flag-bearer for the opening ceremony.\nCompetitors.\nThe following is the list of number of competitors in the Games.\nAlpine skiing.\nKeith Fraser was 24 years old at the time of the Albertville Olympics. Making his only Olympic appearance, he was entered into three events. On 16 February he took part in the Super-G, finishing the single-run race in 1 minute and 29.39 seconds, which put him in 79th place out of 93 classified finishers. The gold medal was won by Kjetil André Aamodt of Norway in a time of 1 minute and 13.04 seconds, the silver medal by Marc Girardelli of Luxembourg, and the bronze by Jan Einar Thorsen, also of Norway.\nThe giant slalom was held on 18 February and was held over two legs, with the total of both runs determining each competitor's final time. Fraser finished the first leg in 1 minute and 21.93 seconds, which put him in 78th place, out of 112 competitors who finished the first run. He finished the second run in a faster time of 1 minute and 19.83 seconds, which was 63rd position for that run. His total time for the event was therefore 2 minutes and 41.76 seconds, which put Fraser in 63rd place out of 91 competitors who finished both legs. The gold medal was won by Italian Alberto Tomba in a time of 2 minutes and 6.98 seconds. The silver medal was won by Girardelli of Luxembourg, and the bronze by the Norwegian Aamodt.\nThe slalom race was held on 22 February, and Fraser failed to finish the first leg of the two-leg race.

        "text": "The 2001 PDC World Darts Championship (officially the 2001 Skol World Darts Championship) was a professional darts tournament held from 28 December 2000 and 3 January 2001 at the Circus Tavern in Purfleet, Essex, England. It was the eighth staging of the competition since the 1994 competition. The competition was the first of 34 Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) tournaments in the 2001 season. The tournament was broadcast on Sky Sports and was sponsored by Skol.\nPhil Taylor, the tournament's defending champion, whitewashed the competition's first non-British finalist John Part 7–0 in the final. It was Taylor's seventh consecutive championship and his ninth overall since his first success in the 1990 BDO world championship. He defeated Nigel Justice, Les Fitton, Keith Deller and Dave Askew en route to the final. Taylor achieved the competition's highest checkout of 167 in the third set of the final against Part.\nTournament summary.\nBackground.\nThe Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) was established under the World Darts Council name by the managers John Markovic, Tommy Cox and Dick Allix and the world's top 16 players in January 1992 as a separate body from the British Darts Organisation (BDO). The first edition of the PDC World Darts Championship was the 1994 competition; it is one of two world championships in the game of darts: the other being the BDO World Darts Championship. The 2001 tournament was held between 28 December 2000 and 3 January 2001 in Purfleet, Essex, England, and was the first of 34 PDC-sanctioned events that year. It was the eighth edition of the tournament and featured a 32-player main draw that was played at the Circus Tavern.\n32 players automatically qualified for the main draw with eight of them seeded. Peter Manley was seeded first and Alan Warriner was the second seed. Seven players debuted at the world championship; three were required by a tomlin order not to enter any PDC-sanctioned darts competitions for one year. They were Richie Burnett, Roland Scholten and Denis Ovens. Dave Askew, Les Fitton and Gary Spedding were the other three men to qualify for the event. Richie Burnett was the first ever Welsh player to compete in the PDC World Championship. The tournament featured the first woman, Gayl King, to play in a PDC world championship after the organisation invited her to take part. The maximum number of sets contested in a match increased from five in the first and second rounds to seven in the quarter-finals and eleven in the semi-finals, leading up to the final which was played as best-of-thirteen sets. Sponsored by Skol, it had a total prize fund of £125,000, and the host broadcaster was Sky Sports.\nBookmakers and the press considered the tournament's defending champion Phil Taylor the favourite to retain his title for the seventh successive year. The second favourite to claim the world championship was Shayne Burgess after he was the runner-up in the World Grand Prix two months prior. Taylor expressed confidence he could compile a nine-dart finish after having done so in an exhibition match against Warriner.\nRound 1.\nThe draw for the first round of the championship was made on Sky Sports' website by Tommy Cox, Alex Roy and Sid Waddell on the afternoon of 7 December 2000. The first round of the competition, in which 32 players participated, took place from 28 and 29 December 2000. In this round, eighth seed Askew defeated Mick Manning 3–2. Askew had attempted a nine-dart finish before he missed the triple 19 ring in the third leg of the opening set. Ahead 2–0, Askew lost his advantage when Manning won two sets in a row. The match ended with a sudden death leg in the fifth set that Askew took with a finish of thirteen darts to requite his loss from the World Grand Prix. Askew was the first player to enter the second round.\nRoy beat Steve Raw 3–2; the match saw Roy claim two successive sets until Raw won the next two to require a deciding fifth set that Roy took after five legs. The 1995 BDO world champion Burnett had a 103.4 average en route to whitewashing Steve Brown 3–0. Fitton took a 3–1 victory against Ovens. Manley, the world number one, was the highest ranked player to lose in the round when he lost 2–3 to world number 21 Jamie Harvey. His opponent won five legs for the first two sets before Manley took two sets 3–1. Harvey took the concluding set 3–1 to win. After the match Manley attributed his loss to Harvey's slow play and accuracy on hitting the double rings.\nJohn Lowe, a former world champion, defeated Spedding 3–1 after his opponent failed to win the third and fourth sets. Fifth seed Dennis Priestley lost 3–2 against Keith Deller. The first two sets were won by Deller. Priestley won the next two to force a final set decider that Deller won 6–4 on the bullseye ring. Taylor had an average of 94.08 over Nigel Justice and had a 151 checkout in a 3–0 whitewash. Paul Lim averaged 89.49 and made checkouts of 110 and 128 to defeat Dan Lauby 3–1. World number 32 Graeme Stoddart won 3–1 over King after the latter came from two legs down to claim the first set. Stoddart complimented King on her play and the latter said she enjoyed the atmosphere. Warriner and Cliff Lazarenko whitewashed Reg Harding and Scott Cummings respectively 3–0.\nSeventh seed John Part whitewashed Colin Lloyd 3–0. The 2000 tournament semi-finalist and world number eleven Dennis Smith won the first set 3–2 over the pre-match favourite Peter Evison. He took the next two sets unchallenged to win 3–0. Bob Anderson, the 1988 BDO world champion, lost 1–3 to the sixth seed and two time World Matchplay champion Rod Harrington. Anderson went two sets behind Harrington after the first seven legs. He scored highly in the third set to go 2–1 behind before Harrington compiled a 119 checkout with a finish on the double 16 ring to win 3–1. In the final first round match, Roland Scholten whitewashed Burgess 3–0 and reached the second round of a PDC tournament for the first time in two prior attempts.\nRound 2.\nThe second round was held on 30 December 2000. Askew took a 3–2 victory over Roy, a match that saw both players compile thirteen maximum scores between them. He converted a 2–1 deficit to win the match after he took the final two sets. Askew said afterwards: \"I was really pleased to battle back. Alex is a great player but I'm just pleased that I've won.\" Warriner defeated Lim 3–2 in a game where both players had sub-par performances; Warriner secured the opening two sets before Lim took the third and fourth sets to require the match to conclude with a fifth set due to the scores being tied at 2–2. Lim missed two opportunities to win the match and Warriner took the final set 5–3. In the match between Smith and Part, both players shared the first four sets to force a game-ending fifth set. Smith took the first leg before Part won three successive legs to win 3–2. Scholten whitewashed Lazarenko 3–0 from set victories of 3–2, 3–2 and 3–0.\nHarvey averaged a 60 per cent finishing record to whitewash Lowe 3–0 and compiled a series of maximums; Lowe was unable to convert multiple opportunities provided to him and prolong the game. Deller continued his run in the competition as he edged out Burnett 3–2. Both players tied at 2–2 to force a final set decider that Deller won with a 144 checkout. Taylor lost the first set of his match against world number 26 Fitton 3–2 before he secured three consecutive sets and a 3–1 victory with an average of 32.32 points per dart. Taylor said afterwards he was concerned about being eliminated from the tournament. The final match of the second round saw Harrington whitewash Stoddart 3–0 and earn the final berth in the quarter-finals. Harrington did not lose a leg to Stoddart as he won set one. He clinched the second after a final leg decider and then completed the match in set three 3–1.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe four quarter-finals were played to the best-of-seven sets on 1 January 2001. Askew produced a three-dart average finish close to 100 and achieved three maximums to win the first set from Harvey. He then compiled a 161 checkout and three maximums as he took the next three sets to whitewash Harvey 4–0 and was the first player to reach the semi-finals. Askew said him not partaking in celebrations for the start of 2001 allowed for his victory: \"Jamie could have pushed me a lot harder. He didn't play as well as he could.\" The second quarter-final saw Harrington beat Scholten 4–2. Harrington took the first set without losing a leg and had a 116 checkout. Scholten took the lead with victories in the following two sets. Harrington made three maximums to level the match after Scholten's dart did not land in the double 16 ring. Harrington then made a 12-dart finish in set five and won the match in the following set. He commented on his victory: \"I really worked hard there. That was a good win and I'm feeling good. I could have gone in the ring with Mike Tyson and I think I would have given a good account of myself because that's how I felt. I was really pumped up.\"\nIn the third quarter-final, Part defeated Warriner 4–1. The match was tied after two sets before Part took a 2–1 advantage. In the second leg of the fifth set, Part could not complete a nine-dart finish. He then compiled a 69 checkout in thirteen dart throws. Part claimed set five 3–0 and became the third player to progress to the semi-finals. The last quarter-final saw Deller whitewashed 4–0 by Taylor and the latter increased his unbeaten televised game streak to 21. He attained a three-dart finishing average of 103.19 and took the opening leg 3–0. He missed hitting the doubles and caused the second set to conclude after five legs. Taylor achieved a 120 checkout in the third set and a finish of ten darts in the fourth set to win the match. Taylor said his performance had improved and that Deller did not play to the best of his ability: \"He's a professional darts player so you've got to knock his confidence down a bit because otherwise he can get in front and his confidence goes up.\"\nSemi-finals.\nBoth of the semi-finals were played to the best-of-eleven sets on 2 January 2001. Taylor whitewashed Askew 6–0 with a three-dart finish average of almost 103 and compiled 14 maximums. Taylor won the first four sets and Askew commenced the fifth with a 126 checkout. Taylor then claimed six consecutive legs including an 11-dart finish to win. After the match, Taylor said he felt he could improve his throw because it was out of trajectory and that he had put pressure onto Askew from the beginning of the game. He was considered the favourite to win the title the following day and commented that wanted to claim his ninth world championship, \"I want to be ten times world champion. This is the biggest chance I've got to make it nine and I can't see anybody beating me. Certainly not tomorrow.\"\nThe other semi-final was contested between Harrington and Part. Both players shared the first two sets before Part extended his lead to 3–1 after he won the fourth set. A finish of eleven darts and misses from Part allowed Harrington to take set five before Part won the following two sets. Harrington then took three more sets to require the match to conclude in a final-set decider. The first leg saw Part win with a 122 checkout before he missed the double 16 ring in the third leg. Harrington tied the set at 2–2 on the double 20 ring. This required a player to win the match in a tiebreak. Part achieved checkouts of 161 and 86 to claim a 6–5 win. This made Part the first non-British player to reach the final of the PDC world championship. Part said post-match that he \"was almost crying, I really was. I knew Rod was the quality player he is and that I couldn't let him back the way I did. I think I'm really fortunate that I got out of that.\"\nFinal.\nThe final between Part and Taylor on 3 January 2001 was held to the best-of-thirteen sets. To reach the 2001 final, Taylor had defeated Nigel Justice, Les Fitton, Keith Deller and Dave Askew, while Part had beaten Colin Lloyd, Dennis Smith, Alan Warriner and Rod Harrington. This was Taylor's tenth world championship final and his eighth consecutive in the PDC. He had previously won the world championship eight times in 1990, 1992, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000. Part had been the BDO world champion in 1994 and appeared in his second career world final. It was the first time Taylor and Part had played each other in professional competition.\nThe game was attended by 1,000 people. Taylor won the first two legs and Part threw 12 darts to win the third with a 127 checkout. Taylor won the first set 3–1 with a 14-dart finish, then took the second set with a 121 checkout and stopped Part from getting a chance to hit a double ring. In set three, Taylor compiled the tournament's highest checkout, a 167, in its second leg and won the set after Part missed the bullseye ring in the first leg. He then won six successive legs to go 5–0 ahead with a finish of ten dart throws and an 82 checkout. Part took the first leg of the sixth set with a 120 checkout to stop a loss of 14 legs in a row before Taylor complied three consecutive 13-dart finishes to claim the set 3–1. The seventh set began with Part claiming one leg until Taylor completed a 7–0 whitewash by winning the set 3–1 and the tournament. It was Taylor's ninth world darts championship and his seventh in succession. He had a 72.4 per cent checkout and a three-dart average of 107.46.\nTaylor earned £33,000 for winning the tournament and £1,000 for compiling the highest checkout. He commented on his win: \"I must admit that I did think John would have given me more of a push but I didn't give him a chance to be fair. My finishing was superb tonight. But you can't give him a chance because otherwise you'll be runner-up.\" Taylor also stated his belief the result was similar to his defeat of Dennis Priestley at the 1998 tournament. Part said Taylor had defeated him meticulously. \"Playing Phil is completely oppressive, take Tiger Woods and double it, He really killed me with his outshots, his doubles percentage must have been around 80 per cent, which is ridiculous. It takes away your hope when a guy never misses a double. It was a special performance, unreal, and I just couldn't measure up.\", stated Part.\nPrize fund.\nThe breakdown of prize money for 2001 is shown below.\nDraw.\nNumbers given to the left of players' names show the seedings for the top eight participants in the tournament.

        "text": "The Philippines national baseball team represents the Philippines in international matches and tournaments. It is organized by the Philippine Amateur Baseball Association.\nThey were the inaugural champions of the Asian Baseball Championships in 1954 but finished fourth in seven of the next eight editions of the biennial events.\nThey have recently participated in the 2006 Intercontinental Cup, and the 2006 Asian Games. They won the gold medal at the 2005 Southeast Asian Games when they hosted the biennial meet.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nBaseball had a long history in the Philippines with the sport's introduction in the islands dating back in 1898. At the inaugural Asian Baseball Championship in 1954, the Philippines managed to finish first.\nFrom the 1960s until the 1970s, baseball was a national pastime in the country. From 1955 until 1971, in all but one of the eight editions of that period, the Philippines finished either third or fourth at the Asian Baseball Championship which was dominated by Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan (later competes as Chinese Taipei). The Philippines last podium finish was in 1971, where it finished third.\n2000s.\nThe Philippines participated at the 2003 Asian Baseball Championship which also served as an Olympic qualifier. However it finished fifth. The national team achieved better results at the 2005 Southeast Asian Games, winning the gold medal for the baseball event beating Thailand 11-1 in the final.\nIn November 2006, the Philippines participated at the Intercontinental Cup were they didn't manage to win a match in 9 games with their best stint being the 5–1 defeat against South Korea in the seventh place game. At the 2006 Asian Games the Philippines did not performed significantly better than at the Intercontinental Cup in terms of standings, finishing last in a competition of six teams. The results of the national team were closer scoring nine runs in five contests.\nAt the 2007 Asian Baseball Championships preliminary round, the Philippines did not lose a single match winning 2–0 against Pakistan and 4–1 against Hong Kong before drawing with Thailand. Before resuming play at the final round of the Asian Baseball Championship, the Philippines went on to defend their title at the 2007 Southeast Asian Games but suffered a close 5-4 defeat to Thailand who emerged as champions. At the Asian Baseball Championship finals the Philippines did not win a game against the \"Big Three\" which composes of Japan, South Korea and Chinese Taipei.\nDue to the performance of the national team at the 2007 edition of the Asian Baseball Championship, they automatically qualified for the \"A\" round of the tournament facing Japan, Thailand and Indonesia in their group with the Philippines winning over the latter two teams.\n2010s.\nThe national team was inactive in 2010. The national sport association for baseball, PABA has experienced difficulties such as mismanagement, insufficient resources and a national squad had not been assembled. There was a dispute between then PABA President Hector Navasero and other personalities with the national sport association. Marty Eizmendi was asked by Philippine Olympic Committee president Peping Cojuangco to settle the issues faced by PABA. The POC urged for a national baseball team to participate at the 2011 Southeast Asian Games due to baseball being a potential source of a gold medal for the Philippines based on past track records. The POC and PABA later agreed to cooperate and decided organize the very first try-outs in decades. The Philippine national team that participated at the Southeast Asian Games won the gold medal beating host Indonesia by 3-1 in the finals.\nIn 2012, they later attempted to qualify for the 2013 World Baseball Classic but failed. In late 2013, Navasero died and his son who was also the secretary general called for an election where Eizmendi was appointed as President. Tom Navasero resigned from his post. Eizmendi inherited the management and resource issues affecting the national sports association which affected the national team's stints.\nThe Philippines defeated Indonesia again at the 2015 East Asia Cup championship in Jakarta by 10-0 qualifying for the 2015 Asian Baseball Championship but withdrew from the continental tournament citing financial issues with the East Asia Cup runners-up participating instead.\nAt the 2017 World Baseball Classic qualifiers in February 2016, the Philippines was managed by American Tim Hulett. At the 2017 Asian Baseball Championship, the national team, consisting of homegrown players who play in the UAAP, will be led by Egay delos Reyes.\nTheir last competition in the decade was the 2019 Southeast Asian Games.\n2020s.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Philippine national team would not compete in international tournaments. The team would return to action in May 2023 when they clinched the East Asia Baseball Cup title.\nInternational tournament results.\nAsian Championships.\n Champions   Runners up   Third place   Fourth place\nAsian Games.\n Champions   Runners up   Third place   Fourth place\nSouth East Asian Games.\n Champions   Runners up   Third place   Fourth place\nFar Eastern Games.\n Champions   Runners up   Third place   Fourth place"

        "text": "This is an article that describes the history of Australian cricket from its known beginnings until the eve of the first-ever Test matches between Australia and England, which took place in the 1876–77 season.\nOrigins.\nCricket was already established in England at the time Australia was first settled by Europeans in the late 18th century. Cricket soon arrived in Australia and the first definite Australian references to the sport are found in 1804, when the January edition of \"The Sydney Gazette\" recorded that recent weather had been favourable to cricketers.\nCricket soon became a very popular sport in Australia, especially in the south-eastern colonies. In Sydney, the Military Cricket Club played games in the 1830s against the Australian Cricket Club, including one at Hyde Park in 1833 and the Racecourse in 1834, as well as against an Australian civilian XI in 1834. In rural New South Wales, the Queanbeyan District Cricket Club was officially formed in 1863 having played games against teams from local towns through the 1850s. first-class status was achieved as early as the 1850s.\nCommencement of first-class cricket.\nIn March 1850, the Melbourne Cricket Club issued a challenge to the Launceston Cricket Club for a match that was eventually played in the 1850–51 season. On 11 &amp; 12 February 1851, Tasmania v Victoria at Launceston Racecourse was the inaugural first-class match played in Australia. Tasmania won by 3 wickets.\nDevelopment of inter-colonial cricket.\nTasmania and Victoria played each other three times up to 1855 and then the New South Wales team made its debut in 1855–56 when it defeated Victoria by 3 wickets in the inaugural first-class match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.\nThe 1857–58 season was a milestone as it featured three first-class matches involving all of New South Wales, Tasmania and Victoria. Victoria played in all three matches and won them. They defeated New South Wales by 171 runs at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and then defeated Tasmania twice: at Launceston by an innings and 20 runs; and at Hobart by 69 runs.\nAlthough it was impossible due to travel constraints to arrange first-class matches between the colonies in every season, there was a steady rate of growth, especially at club level. The sport received a considerable boost when English teams began arriving in the colonies in 1861–62 and especially when the legendary WG Grace himself toured Australia in 1873–74. By 1876, standards in Australia had become very high indeed especially with the emergence of a world-class bowler like Fred Spofforth. Australia was then ready to oppose England on level terms.\n\"For detailed information about early domestic cricket in Australia, see\" : Intercolonial cricket in Australia \"and\" List of Australian intercolonial cricket matches\nInternational tours.\n1861–62.\nThe inaugural English tour of Australia was organised by Messrs Spiers &amp; Pond. Led by HH Stephenson, the English team was a great success that inspired later tours.\n1863–64.\nThe Melbourne Cricket Club organised a tour by an English team under the captaincy of George Parr, which also visited New Zealand. No first-class matches were played. The English team was unbeaten and its overall record was 16 played, 10 wins and six draws.\n1873–74.\nThe Melbourne Cricket Club organised a tour by an English team under the captaincy of WG Grace, which played 15 matches in all but none were first-class."

        "text": "Nepal sent a delegation to compete at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, United States from 8–24 February 2002. This was Nepal's first time participating in a Winter Olympic Games. The delegation consisted of a single cross-country skier, Jay Khadka. In the men's sprint he finished in 70th place, and in the men's 2 × 10 kilometre pursuit he finished in 79th place, and did not advance to the finals of either event.\nBackground.\nThe Nepal Olympic Committee was recognized by the International Olympic Committee on 31 December 1962. Nepal first participated in Olympic competition at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. The nation did not take part in the next Summer Olympics, but have participated in every Summer Olympic Games since the 1972 edition. Despite this, these Salt Lake City Games were their first appearance in the Winter Olympic Games, and they have never won an Olympic medal as of 2018. The 2002 Winter Olympics were held from 8–24 February 2002; a total of 2,399 athletes took part representing 77 National Olympic Committees. The only athlete sent by Nepal to the Salt Lake Olympics was Jay Khadka, competing in cross-country skiing. He was selected as the flag bearer for the opening ceremony.\nCross-country skiing.\nJay Khadka was 29 years old at the time of the Salt Lake City Olympics. The Nepalese native was adopted into a British family as a young man. On 14 February, he participated in the men's 2 × 10 kilometre pursuit, which consisted of 10 kilometres of classical style racing, followed by a separate 10 kilometres of freestyle pursuit. Khadka finished the classical portion in 44 minutes and 20.3 seconds, putting him in 79th place out of 80 finishers, in a race where only the top 60 qualified to advance, and he was eliminated; the slowest qualifying time was 29 minutes and 4.6 seconds. The gold medal was shared by Frode Estil and Thomas Alsgaard of Norway, while bronze was won by Per Elofsson of Sweden. Five days later, in the men's sprint, Khadka finished the qualification round in 4 minutes and 48.42 seconds, which put him in 70th and last place, but only the top 16 were allowed to advance. The slowest qualifying time was 2 minutes and 53.87 seconds. The gold medal was won by Tor Arne Hetland of Norway, the silver was taken by Peter Schlickenrieder of Germany, and the bronze was won by Cristian Zorzi of Italy.\nSprint\nPursuit"

        "title": "John Farrell (baseball manager)",
        "text": "John Edward Farrell (born August 4, 1962) is an American former baseball pitcher, coach, and manager in Major League Baseball (MLB). During his eight-season playing career, Farrell was a member of the Cleveland Indians, California Angels, and Detroit Tigers. He was the pitching coach for the Boston Red Sox from 2007 to 2010, before serving as manager of the Toronto Blue Jays from 2011 to 2012. He returned to the Red Sox as their manager in 2013, winning the World Series with them in his first year, and led the team until 2017. Since 2018, he has held a scouting position with the Cincinnati Reds.\nPlaying career.\nAmateur.\nFarrell grew up in Monmouth Beach, New Jersey, and was a star pitcher for Shore Regional High School. Upon graduating from high school in 1980, Farrell was drafted by the Oakland Athletics, but he did not sign. He played college baseball for Oklahoma State, where he had a 20–6 record for his four-year career. In 1982, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Hyannis Mets of the Cape Cod Baseball League. After graduating from Oklahoma State, he was drafted by the Cleveland Indians in the second round of the 1984 Draft.\nProfessional.\nFarrell made his major league debut with the Indians on August 18, 1987, playing for them until the 1990 season. He enjoyed success as part of the Cleveland starting rotation, but injuries to his right elbow caused him to miss the entire 1991 and 1992 seasons. He returned to action with the California Angels (1993–94), again with Cleveland (1995), and finished his career with the Detroit Tigers (1996).\nPost-playing career.\nIn 1997, Farrell joined his alma mater, Oklahoma State University, as assistant coach and pitching and recruiting coordinator. He remained with the college through 2001.\nFrom November 2001 through the end of the 2006 season, Farrell served as the director of player development for the Cleveland Indians. In 2003 and 2004, the Indians were named MLB Organization of the Year by \"USA Today\"s \"Sports Weekly\". In 2003, they were also named as having the top farm system in professional baseball by \"Baseball America\".\nFollowing the 2006 season, the Boston Red Sox hired Farrell as its new pitching coach, replacing Dave Wallace. Farrell rejoined Red Sox manager Terry Francona, as they had been teammates together on the Indians.\nToronto Blue Jays.\nDuring the 2010 off-season, Farrell was rumored to be one of four finalists for the job of manager of Toronto Blue Jays, along with Brian Butterfield, DeMarlo Hale, and Sandy Alomar Jr. The Blue Jays held a press conference on October 25, 2010, formally introducing Farrell as the team's manager for the 2011 season.\nFarrell suffered a dislocated jaw while attempting to restrain pitcher Jon Rauch from going after umpire Alfonso Marquez, during a game on July 2, 2011. Both Rauch and Farrell were ejected from the game.\nOn August 25, 2011, during a home game against the Kansas City Royals, Farrell was forced to leave the dugout in the ninth inning due to a then unknown illness. He was later diagnosed with pneumonia at Mount Sinai Hospital, and was released from the hospital on August 26.\nHe finished his stint as Toronto Blue Jays manager with a record of 154 wins and 170 losses.\nBoston Red Sox.\nOn October 20, 2012, it was reported that Farrell had asked to be allowed to interview for the manager position with the Boston Red Sox. The next day the Blue Jays officially confirmed Farrell had accepted the manager position with Boston. In the same transaction, Toronto sent pitcher David Carpenter to Boston in exchange for infielder Mike Avilés. On October 22, 2013, Farrell was named Sporting News' 2013 AL Manager of the Year. In 2013, Farrell became the fifth first-year Red Sox manager to win the American League pennant. The Red Sox subsequently went on to win the 2013 World Series, going from worst to first under Farrell in just a year's time. It was also the first time in 95 years that the Red Sox won the Series at home, the last time being the 1918 World Series. However, the team struggled during Farrell's second year as manager and subsequently finished last in their division. Farrell accepted responsibility for their poor performance and also attributed their problems to inconsistencies in their offense.\nFarrell's 2015 season was cut short in August when he was diagnosed with lymphoma and forced to seek treatment. By the time of his departure, the Red Sox's struggles were continuing and they again found themselves in last place in their division, where they ultimately finished for the second year in a row. Nevertheless, it was announced that Farrell would return as the Red Sox's manager in 2016.\nThe 2016 season was an improvement for Farrell and the Red Sox, who finished at the top of their division and returned to the playoffs. However, the team would be swept in the American League Division Series against the Cleveland Indians, led by their former manager Terry Francona, under whom Farrell had previously served.\nThe Red Sox again finished at the top of their division under Farrell in the 2017 season, but were also eliminated in the divisional round for a second consecutive year, this time against the Houston Astros. On October 11, 2017, the Red Sox announced Farrell's termination after serving five years as manager.\nCincinnati Reds.\nIn March 2018, the Reds announced that Farrell had joined their organization as a scout, his role to be \"evaluating the club's system and also serving on special assignments\".\nBroadcasting.\nIn March 2018, it was announced that Farrell would join ESPN's \"Baseball Tonight\" as an analyst, in time for the start of the regular season. He has also appeared as an analyst on \"Fox Major League Baseball\" during the 2019 season.\nPersonal life.\nFarrell's father, Tom, pitched in the Cleveland Indians farm system in the 1950s until an injury ended his baseball career.\nAs of the 2019 baseball season, Farrell spends 10 days a month working as a minor league pitching scout for the Cincinnati Reds, and at other times works lobster fishing near Ipswich, Massachusetts, on his boat \"Seaweed\".\nFarrell has three sons, all of whom were selected in the MLB Draft. Jeremy, an infielder, played college baseball at Virginia, then was in the Pittsburgh Pirates minor league system from 2008 through 2012, and in the Chicago White Sox system from 2013 through 2015. Shane, a right-handed pitcher out of Marshall, was taken in the 46th round by the Toronto Blue Jays in 2011, and then worked for the Chicago Cubs in their baseball operations department. His youngest, Luke, a Northwestern right-hander, was selected by the Kansas City Royals in the sixth round of the 2013 draft and has pitched in MLB for the Royals, Reds, Cubs and Twins. In 2018, two of Farrell's sons worked in the Cubs organization: Shane as an area scout, Jeremy as the Assistant Director of Baseball Development. Shane was named Amateur Scouting Director for the Blue Jays before the 2020 season.\nExternal links.\n, or Retrosheet"

        "title": "Bruce Allen (American football)",
        "text": "Bruce Allen (born October 26, 1956) is a former American football executive. He served as general manager for two teams in the National Football League (NFL): the Tampa Bay Buccaneers from 2004 to 2008 and the Washington Redskins from 2009 to 2019. He got his start in the NFL as a senior executive with the Oakland Raiders in 1995.\nAllen played college football at the University of Richmond and was selected by the Baltimore Colts in the 1978 NFL Draft, but never played in the NFL. He spent 1979 as the head football coach at Occidental College in Los Angeles. Allen is the son of Pro Football Hall of Fame coach George Allen and brother of former Virginia governor and U.S. Senator George Allen.\nPlaying and coaching career.\nAllen is the son of Pro Football Hall of Fame coach George Allen and brother of former Virginia governor and Senator George Allen. Allen attended high school at Langley High School in McLean, Virginia in the early 1970s, and attended the University of Richmond, where he played college football for the Spiders from 1974 to 1977. In his junior season, he ranked 16th nationally and broke the school record for punting, averaging 42.9 yards a kick; those numbers resulted in him being named to that year's All-ECAC and All-South Independent teams. He was drafted by the Baltimore Colts in the 12th round of the 1978 NFL Draft, but did not play for the team.\nAllen began his coaching career in 1978 when was hired as a graduate assistant at Arizona State University to serve on the football coaching staff under head coach Frank Kush. In 1979, Allen was the head football coach at Occidental College, a small NCAA Division III school in Los Angeles, where he led them to a 2–6–1 record before resigning after the season to coach the Los Angeles Thunderbolts of the California Football League in 1980.\nExecutive career.\nUSFL.\nAllen was the general manager of the Chicago Blitz in 1983 and Arizona Wranglers in 1984.\nOakland Raiders.\nAllen founded GBA Sportsworld in 1985, an athlete representation and marketing company. He joined the Oakland Raiders organization as a senior executive in 1995, specializing in salary cap management and free agency negotiations. He won the George Young Executive of the Year award with the club during their AFC Championship year in 2002.\nTampa Bay Buccaneers.\nFollowing the 2003 season, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers gave general manager Rich McKay permission to leave the team as his relationship with Super Bowl XXXVII-winning coach Jon Gruden had deteriorated. The Glazer family, which owned and oversaw the Buccaneers, hired Allen to replace McKay, as Allen had previously worked with Gruden in Oakland. Allen immediately began looking for a more youthful team. This included releasing long-time Buccaneer John Lynch and allowing Warren Sapp to leave for free agency, along with drafting Auburn running back Cadillac Williams in the 2005 NFL Draft.\nThe Buccaneers performance during Allen's tenure was mixed. His first year there, the team went 5–11. The next year however, they were 11–5 and won the NFC South division in 2005, but went 4–12 in 2006. The team rebounded to a 9–7 record and another NFC South title in 2007, after which Allen had his contract extended to 2011. Following a second 9–7 record in 2008 and missing the playoffs after four consecutive losses in December, however, both Allen and Gruden were fired.\nWashington Redskins.\nOn December 17, 2009, the Washington Redskins announced that they had hired Allen as their general manager shortly after executive vice president of football operations Vinny Cerrato resigned. Allen's father coached the Redskins to its first Super Bowl appearance in 1972. Shortly after Allen joined the Redskins, Jim Zorn and his staff were fired, allowing Mike Shanahan to be hired as head coach and executive vice president of football operations. While Shanahan had the final say in football decisions, he and Allen split the duties of general manager, working in an arrangement similar to how Bill Belichick and Scott Pioli operated with the New England Patriots at the time. For the uncapped season in 2010, the League had advised all teams to not explicitly use it as a method to create cap room in the future when the salary cap would return. Allen and the team failed to heed the warnings of the league and did so anyway. As a result, Washington suffered a 36 million salary cap penalty split between the 2012 and 2013 seasons. \nAfter Shanahan was fired following the 2013 season, Allen took over his role and had final say on football operations, choosing Cincinnati Bengals offensive coordinator Jay Gruden to replace Shanahan as head coach. While general manager, Allen attempted to bridge the connection between the modern Redskins and the glory years of past, include hosting golf tournaments with former players and coaches, to bringing back the gold pants that his father's team had used in the 1970s. \nIn 2014, Allen was officially given the co-title of president. Allen abdicated his title of general manager after the Redskins hired Scot McCloughan to be their new one on January 7, 2015, later becoming the de facto general manager again upon the firing of McCloughan after the 2016 season. Allen's tenure with the team was met with heavy criticism and disapproval, with a popular \"FireBruceAllen\" hashtag campaign being used on social media throughout the latter half of the 2010s, before he was fired following a 3–13 season in 2019. The team had only made two postseason appearances under Allen, winning neither of them.\nIn October 2021, emails between Allen and football coach and commentator Jon Gruden were leaked to \"The New York Times\". According to the emails, Gruden sent several sexist, racist, and homophobic remarks to Allen throughout the 2010s. The two also exchanged topless photos of Washington cheerleaders. Gruden resigned as head coach of the Las Vegas Raiders following the report."

        "text": "The Race of the Century was the name given to a 1986 W. S. Cox Plate, a thoroughbred horse race in held in Melbourne, Australia, between two New Zealand racehorses of the 1980s.\nThe W. S. Cox Plate, held annually at Melbourne's Moonee Valley Racecourse, is one of the most significant races on the Australian calendar. It considered to be the weight-for-age championship of Australia and New Zealand. The race had been won by some of the great thoroughbreds of Australasian turf since its inception in 1922, including Phar Lap, Tulloch and Kingston Town.\nThe race centred on the encounter between Our Waverley Star and Bonecrusher.\nBonecrusher was a New Zealand champion, having won most of the three-year-old classics, including the New Zealand Derby. His form continued in Australia, where he won the Tancred Stakes, the AJC Derby, the Underwood Stakes and the Caulfield Stakes.\nIn turn, Our Waverley Star had been winning almost all his races in New Zealand in the lead-up to the Cox Plate. He had won their previous encounter on 23 August at Ellerslie in the 1200m Admiralty Handicap when Bonecrusher was third.\nThe race was run at a good pace, in good weather and track conditions, neither favouring or disadvantaging either horse. Our Waverley Star settled wide, in mid-field, while Bonecrusher - as usual - was towards the back of the field. At the 800 metres mark, Bonecrusher (ridden by Gary Stewart) moved around the field to be immediately shadowed by Our Waverley Star (ridden by Lance O'Sullivan). Quickly, the two horses cleared out from the rest of the field. Race caller Bill Collins questioned whether the horses had gone too early: \"Here come the New Zealanders . . . have they gone too early...?\".\nOur Waverley Star built up a length lead, which was countered by Bonecrusher. As they entered wide into the short home straight at the Moonee Valley Racecourse, Bonecrusher had a slender lead. Quickly, Our Waverley Star gathered in Bonecrusher and it seemed he would pull away, but Bonecrusher fought back down the straight to win by a neck at the post...to which race caller Bill Collins added, \"... and Bonecrusher races into equine immortality ...\"\nThe 1986 W. S. Cox Plate is one of the most replayed versions of the race and one of the most remembered horse races in Australia and New Zealand. \"This was one of those races where the hype in the lead-up was matched, surpassed even, by the race\"\nOf note, the 3rd place-getter was The Filbert, another well-performed New Zealand horse. This gave New Zealand the trifecta in the race."

He was an assistant coach with the Montreal Canadiens from 1997 to 1999 and then became the first coach of the expansion Columbus Blue Jackets ahead of their inaugural 2000–01 season. He was fired by the Blue Jackets on January 7, 2003, in the middle of the 2002–03 season, his and the team's third season. In 2009, the Phoenix Coyotes hired King as an assistant coach. At the end of the 2010–11 season, King became a development coach with the Coyotes.\nOutside of the NHL, King coached European teams for several seasons after his time in Columbus, including the Hamburg Freezers and Adler Mannheim of the German Deutsche Eishockey Liga and the Malmö Redhawks of the Swedish Elite League. He also became the first North American to coach in Russia. He first coached Metallurg Magnitogorsk of the Russian Super League from 2005 to 2006, a team which included top NHL prospect Evgeni Malkin. King co-authored a 2007 book with sports journalist Eric Duhatschek entitled \"King of Russia\" about his first stint in the country. In early 2014, he returned to Russia to take over Lokomotiv Yaroslavl of the Kontinental Hockey League, a team that less than three years earlier had been devastated by a fatal plane crash. King joined the team with just four games remaining in the 2013–14 season. Lokomotiv secured a playoff spot by winning those four games, and then upset the heavily favoured Dynamo Moscow in the first round of the playoffs and SKA Saint Petersburg in the second round, before losing to Lev Praha in the third round. King returned to coach the team in the 2014–15 season.\nInternational coaching.\nKing was the head coach of Canada's national junior team, and helped guide the team to a gold medal at the 1982 World Junior Championships and a bronze medal at the 1983 World Juniors. King was head coach of the Canadian national team at the 1984, 1988, and 1992 Winter Olympics, finishing fourth in 1984 and 1988, and winning a silver medal in 1992. He also coached the Canadian national team at five IIHF World Championships. In 1987 he coached Canada to victory at the Izvestia Cup tournament in Moscow, becoming the first Canadian team to defeat the Soviet national team in the USSR since the 1972 Summit Series.\nKing served as head coach for Team Canada during the 2016 Deutschland Cup. He was an as associate coach at the 2016 and 2017 Spengler Cup tournaments, helping Canada win the tournament both times. In 2017, King was named an assistant coach of Canada's men's team for the 2018 Winter Olympics, the first to not feature NHL players since 1994; Canada went on to win the bronze medal.\nKing spoke at the Open Ice Summit in 1999, and advocated for more time to practice skills compared to playing time. He compared the Canadian system, which prioritized physical size and introduced body contact at a young age, to the European system, which prioritized skill, practiced three times as much as the Canadian model, and did not have body contact in youth hockey.\nHonours.\nKing was made a Member of the Order of Canada (CM) in 1992. He was inducted into the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame in 1997, and the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2001. In recognition of his contributions to the game with the national teams, Hockey Canada named him to the Order of Hockey in Canada as part of its 2013 class.\nIn 2018, King was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Saskatchewan."

        "text": " Paul Stephen Wallace (born 30 December 1971) is a former Irish rugby union player who played tight head prop for Ireland and the British &amp; Irish Lions. Wallace was once regarded as the world's best tight-head prop, and was known as a very effective scrummager, and a player with good ball skills.\nWallace currently works for Sky Sports as a rugby pundit and is also a contributor to the \"Daily Mail\" and \"Rugby World\" magazine as well as Today FM's \"The Last Word\".\nRugby career.\nDuring his rugby playing career Wallace played with UCC, Munster, Blackrock College RFC, Leinster before moving to professional club, Saracens whom he played with from 1996 to 2001 before returning to Leinster in 2001. He played at international level with Ireland and the British Lions, representing Ireland at junior levels before making his full international debut against Japan in the 1995 Rugby World Cup in Bloemfontein to play alongside his brother Richard. He went on to win 46 caps for Ireland between 1995 and 2002. His final match for Ireland was against Georgia in a world cup qualifier at Lansdowne Road in September 2002.\nWallace was selected to tour South Africa with the 1997 British Lions. He became one of only five members of the tour who played the full duration of all three tests. He was a very influential player in the winning of the series, facing Os du Randt in the scrum and was subsequently described by captain, Martin Johnson, as his \"player of the series\", with tour manager Fran Cotton regarding him as the cornerstone of the Lions scrum.\nRetirement from rugby.\nIn January 2001 he suffered a seriously broken ankle playing for Saracens against Ulster, which he recovered from. But further complications saw him retire in December 2003 after winning the Celtic League with Leinster.\nPost rugby career.\nWallace is currently a pundit for Sky Sports, giving expert opinion and analysis during their rugby union broadcasts. He also writes a Saturday column for the Irish Daily Mail and is a rugby panellist for the Last Word show on Today FM. Wallace is a judging panel member for the International Rugby Board Player of the Year Award.\nAs well his media work, Paul is also a director of Bircroft Property Finance (Ireland), an international debt structuring firm for commercial property. He previously worked for International property company, Jones Lang La Salle, dealing in international commercial property sales and acquisitions.\nFamily.\nWallace's younger brother David, previously played for Munster, won 72 caps playing for Ireland and toured on the 2009 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to South Africa but retired in 2012 due to a recurring knee injury. His older brother Richard played wing for Ireland, and retired from international rugby in 1999 after earning 29 caps for Ireland and touring New Zealand with the 1993 Lions. All three Wallace brothers have made the Guinness Book of Records as the only three members of one family to play for the Lions.\nWallace is married to Barbara Loftus. Loftus is senior producer to Matt Cooper on Today FM's drivetime programme, \"The Last Word\"."

        "title": "Wimbledon Effect",
        "text": "The Wimbledon Effect (Japanese: ウィンブルドン現象, rōmaji: \"Uinburudon Genshō\", literally \"Wimbledon Phenomenon\") is a chiefly British and Japanese analogy, which possibly originated in Japan, that compares the tennis fame of the Wimbledon Championships with the economic success of the United Kingdom's financial services industries – especially those clustered in the City of London.\nThe point of the analogy is that a national and international institution (the annual tennis tournament at Wimbledon) can be highly successful despite the lack of strong native competition, as in modern tennis Britain has produced very few Wimbledon singles champions, with only Anne Jones, Virginia Wade and Andy Murray winning the tournament in the Open Era.\nFinancial context.\nLondon's financial industry has boomed since the deregulation of British financial markets (the \"Big Bang\") in the 1980s under the Thatcher government – but has also become dominated by foreign companies, especially American investment banks, rather than British firms (a result opposite to the original intention of the reforms).\nThe analogy is typically used to mark a debate over whether it matters if an industry is primarily domestically owned if easing of foreign ownership restrictions allows the economy to benefit from foreign investment and increased global competition. The phrase can be used positively to assert the economic success of liberal attitudes towards foreign ownership (and sometimes to emphasize that such attitudes promote a level playing field for domestic and foreign interests alike); or it can be used negatively to emphasize how these policies have eroded a nation's ability to produce globally leading domestic companies. This opposing perspective is represented by economic patriotism and \"national champion\" policies.\nThe analogy has also been used in policy discourses outside Britain – most notably in the business discourse of Japan, whose financial markets and other parts of the economy (as of 2006) have not yet been substantially opened up to foreign competition compared with its international peers. It has also, for instance, been used in banking reform debates in South Korea, as well as in discussing business process outsourcing in India.\nSports in Japan.\nThe term has also frequently been appearing in sports in Japan since late 20th century, including sumo where there has been only one Japanese-born yokozuna since 1998 as most of the top players have been from Mongolia or Polynesia. Similarly in combat sports (\"kakutougi\"), K-1 was the biggest kickboxing promotion of the world, whereas Pride Fighting Championships was the biggest mixed martial arts promotion of the world. Nevertheless, both K-1 and Pride had few Japanese-born popular players or champions. The vast majority of prominent competitors in K-1 came from the Netherlands or Thailand, while Pride's biggest names were from Brazil, United States, and Russia."

The team was formed in June 1918 and played three matches against an England XI that summer, two at Lord's and one at Kennington Oval but these were not first-class. The team was revived in May 1943 and played six matches between then and August 1945. The team's sole first-class match was against England at Lord's in late August 1945. This was the seventh match of first-class status to be played in England since 1939.\nRepresentative Match.\nAll but two of the England team either already had, or would later gain, Test caps, and the other two (Eddie Phillipson and Jack Davies) would play over 150 first-class matches each, but the Dominions side was far more uneven in this regard. Cricketers including Learie Constantine (captaining the team in his final first-class match) and Keith Miller played with Hartley Craig for whom this was his \"only\" first-class game.\nThe Dominions won the toss and batted, and Donnelly's 133 helped them to 307 all out; Wright took 5–90. England's reply started badly as they fell to 96/6, but a stand of 177 between captain Hammond (121) and Edrich (78) saw them to 287. In their second innings, the Dominions' total of 336 was massively helped by Miller's 185; Wright claimed 5–105. Chasing 357 to win, 102 from Hammond and 56 from Davies were not enough and they were dismissed for 311; the Dominions thus won by 45 runs."

In order to be eligible for government funding through the Sports Council, cricket needed an independent governing body and the representatives from the TCCB, together with representatives from MCC and the National Cricket Association (NCA), formed a new Cricket Council, initially known as the MCC Council. The TCCB assumed responsibility for all county cricket and the England team at home and abroad, although England touring teams continued under the name MCC until the 1976–77 season.\nIn 1992 Scotland severed their ties with the TCCB and England.

        "text": "The men's individual road race was a road bicycle racing event held as part of the Cycling at the 1964 Summer Olympics programme. It was held on 22 October 1964. The course, just short of 25 kilometres, was covered 8 times for a total distance of 194.832 kilometres. 132 cyclists from 35 nations competed. The maximum number of cyclists per nation was four. The event was won by Mario Zanin of Italy, the nation's second victory in the men's individual road race and third consecutive Games in the top two. Kjell Rodian earned Denmark's first medal in the event with his silver. Walter Godefroot's bronze was Belgium's fifth medal in five Games (with 2 in 1952 making up for missing the podium in 1956).\nBackground.\nThis was the seventh appearance of the event, previously held in 1896 and then at every Summer Olympics since 1936. It replaced the individual time trial event that had been held from 1912 to 1932 (and which would be reintroduced alongside the road race in 1996). Eddy Merckx of Belgium was the reigning world champion and the only one of the last four world champions to compete (the other three had all turned professional).\nThe Republic of China, Hong Kong, Iran, Malaysia, Mongolia, the Philippines, and Thailand each made their debut in the men's individual road race. Great Britain made its seventh appearance in the event, the only nation to have competed in each appearance to date.\nCompetition format and course.\nThe mass-start race was on a course that covered eight laps of a 24.354 kilometres circuit starting at the Takao train station, for a total of 194.832 kilometres. It was a \"relatively easy course\" that \"featured a fairly steep, but short, climb of 65 metres at the 11th km., followed by a short descent, and then a mild climb over the next few kilometres.\" The course ran into Hachioji, across the Asakawa Bridge, to Sanyu Corner, then northwest to Tobuki Cross with a detour to Takatsuki Terminal, then back south to Takao station again. It was a shorter version of the team time trial course, which went out to the Hino Bridge before looping back to Sanyu Corner.\nResults.\nNobody was able to make a successful breakaway, with 99 riders closely bunched throughout the race. The best attempts all fell short with no effective tries in the last 15 kilometres. Merckx had a late effort with 1.5 kilometres left but never got more than 20 metres clear of the pack. Zanin and Rodian reached the front in the final sprint, though all 99 cyclists in the pack finished within two tenths of a second of Zanin. Precise order within the pack, particularly after 35th place, is disputed."

        "title": "LSU Tigers men's basketball",
        "text": "The LSU Tigers men's basketball team (aka. The Louisiana State University Tigers team) represents Louisiana State University in NCAA Division I men's college basketball. The Tigers are currently coached by Matt McMahon, after previous coach Will Wade was dismissed on March 12, 2022. They play their home games in the Pete Maravich Assembly Center located on the LSU campus in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The team participates in the Southeastern Conference.\nHistory.\nEarly history (1909–1957).\nThe first season of LSU men's basketball was the 1908–09 basketball season. The first game in program history was a 35–20 away game victory versus Dixon Academy. The first home game in program history was an 18–12 victory over Mississippi State.\nThe 1934–1935 Tigers – coached by Harry Rabenhorst, and keyed by the play of first LSU All-American Sparky Wade – finished the season at 14–1, defeating a Pittsburgh Panthers team that shared the Eastern Intercollegiate Conference championship and finished with an 18–6 overall record in the American Legion Bowl by a score of 41–37 in their final game of the season. LSU's lone defeat came to the Southwest Conference co-champion Rice Owls by a score of 56–47 in Houston in one of LSU's three road games. LSU has claimed a national championship for the 1935 season (pre-NCAA tournament), but not on the basis of any determination by an external selector. (LSU is the only school that officially claims a national championship on the basis of a win in the American Legion Bowl, an event that made no claim to determine a national champion. The Helms Athletic Foundation retroactively named the 19–1 NYU Violets its national champion for the 1934–35 season. The retroactive Premo-Porretta Power Poll also ranked the Violets as its 1935 national champion. The Premo-Porretta poll ranked LSU fifth, behind second-ranked Richmond (20–0), third-ranked Duquesne (18–1), and fourth-ranked Kentucky (19–2); the poll ranked Pittsburgh—LSU's final opponent–16th nationally.)\nRabenhorst also led the Tigers to the 1953 Final Four with a team that finished 22–3 overall and 13–0 in conference play, and which included future NBA Hall of Famer Bob Pettit. Rabenhorst's 1953–54 Tigers repeated as SEC champions—again finishing undefeated in conference play at 14–0, and at 20–5 overall—and played in the Sweet Sixteen game of the 1954 NCAA tournament, falling 78–70 to eventual national third-place Penn State.\nTough times (1957–1966).\nFrom 1957 to 1966, LSU was coached by Jay McCreary (1957–1965) and Frank Truitt (1965–66 season). They combined for a record of 88–135. Significant players included George Nattin, Jr.\nMaravich era (1966–1972).\nPress Maravich was head basketball coach from 1966 to 1972. He had an overall record of 76–86 at LSU. He led the team to three winning seasons, but did not win an SEC championship or make an NCAA tournament appearance. His 1969–70 team advanced to the NIT Final Four. This era is best known for the exploits of Press Maravich's son, \"Pistol\" Pete Maravich whom he coached from 1967 to 1970. Pete dominated at the collegiate level averaging 44.2 points per game and was named National Player of the Year in 1970.\nCollis Temple Jr. of Kentwood became LSU's first African-American varsity athlete during Press' final season of 1971–1972. The 1971–1972 season was also the Tigers' first playing in the LSU Assembly Center.\nDale Brown era (1972–1997).\nDale Brown was head LSU basketball coach for 25 years from 1972 to 1997. During his time at LSU, he led the basketball team to two Final Fours, four Elite Eights, five Sweet Sixteens, and thirteen NCAA Tournament appearances. He also led the Tigers to four regular season SEC championships and one SEC Tournament championship.\nIn 1996–97, Dale Brown signed Baton Rouge high school phenom Lester Earl, who led Glen Oaks High School to three consecutive Louisiana High School Athletic Association state championships (two in Class 4A, one in Class 5A, the highest classification), with all championship games played at the Pete Maravich Assembly Center. Earl played just 11 games at LSU before he was suspended and transferred to the University of Kansas soon afterward (ironically, Earl played for LSU in an 82-53 loss to Kansas in that season's Maui Invitational). While at Kansas, Earl said that an LSU assistant coach gave him money when he was at LSU. The NCAA quickly began an investigation. It found no evidence that Brown or his assistants paid Earl. However, it did find that a former booster paid Earl about $5,000 while he was attending LSU. The basketball team was placed on probation in 1998.\nIn September 2007, Lester Earl issued an apology to Brown, then-assistant head coach Johnny Jones, and LSU in general for his role in the NCAA investigation. Earl now has altered his original claims that the NCAA pressured him into making false claims against Dale Brown or else he would lose years of NCAA eligibility. Earl said, \"I was pressured into telling them SOMETHING. I was 19 years old at that time. The NCAA intimidated me, manipulated me into making up things, and basically encouraged me to lie, in order to be able to finish my playing career at Kansas. They told me if we don't find any dirt on Coach Brown you won't be allowed to play but one more year at Kansas. I caused great harm, heartache and difficulties for so many people. I feel sorriest for hurting Coach Brown. Coach Brown, I apologize to you for tarnishing your magnificent career at LSU.\"\nThe NCAA has declined any new comments on the situation. However, Brown says that he has forgiven Earl. \"The most interesting journey that a person can make is discovering himself. I believe Lester has done that, and I forgive him.\"\nJohn Brady era (1997–2008).\nIn 1997, John Brady replaced the legendary Dale Brown as head coach at LSU. When Brady arrived, the program was under probation and stinging from a recruiting scandal. Brady's first two years were rough.\nIn 2000, the Tigers broke through, posting a 28–6 record and an NCAA Tournament Sweet 16 appearance. However, due to the loss of Stromile Swift and Jabari Smith to the 2000 NBA draft, the Tigers could not carry their momentum to the next year, going 13–16 in 2001.\nBrady's team entered the 2005–06 season unranked, but were coming off a solid season in which they went 20–10 and made the NCAA tournament. Led by Glen \"Big Baby\" Davis and Tyrus Thomas, the Tigers won their first outright SEC regular season championship since 1985, and earned a #4 seed in the NCAA tournament. After wins over Iona and Texas A&amp;M, LSU defeated the #1 seed Duke and #2 seed Texas to make it to their first Final Four since 1986. Set at the RCA Dome in Indianapolis, Indiana, the 2006 Final Four was the first since 1980 to feature no #1 seeds (LSU, #2 UCLA, #3 Florida and #11 George Mason). Facing the #2 seed Bruins in the national semifinals, the Tigers were unable to solve UCLA's defense, losing 59–45, dropping LSU to 0–6 all-time in the men's Final Four (and 0–11 in all Final Four games, including an 0–5 mark in the women's Final Four). Despite the loss, the 2005–06 season will be remembered as one of the most successful in LSU men's basketball history.\nJohn Brady was fired in the middle of his 11th season as LSU's head basketball coach and just two seasons after the Tigers' latest Final Four appearance.\nOn February 8, 2008, Brady was fired from LSU. Earlier news reports stated that he would coach the Tennessee game on February 9, but LSU officials stated that his termination is immediate. Brady's assistant coach, Butch Pierre, took over as the interim head coach.\nIn ten and a half seasons at LSU, Brady compiled a 192–139 record, including two SEC titles and four NCAA tournament appearances. He currently serves as the color analyst on LSU men's basketball radio broadcasts.\nTrent Johnson years (2009–2012).\nOn April 10, 2008, Trent Johnson was officially named the 20th head coach of the LSU Tigers men's basketball team. With the hiring, Johnson became the first African-American head coach of a men's sports team at LSU. In his first season at LSU, Johnson led the Tigers to 27 wins, tied for the third most wins in a season in LSU history. The Tigers won the SEC regular season championship with a record of 13–3. LSU returned to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2006. In the opening round, LSU defeated nationally ranked Butler one year prior to the Bulldogs starting their run of two straight trips to the NCAA Championship game. They advanced to the second round before falling, 84–70, to North Carolina. LSU had a second-half lead on the Tar Heels and the game was still in the balance entering the final eight minutes. The Tar Heels went on to capture the national championship, their second under Roy Williams and fifth overall.\nJohnson was named the 2009 consensus SEC Coach of the Year and was a finalist for four national coach of the year honors as he became the first LSU men's basketball coach to win the league title and take the team to post-season play in his first year at the school. The next two seasons were not nearly as successful, as the Tigers won a combined 5 conference games and went 11–20 in consecutive years.\nLSU improved to 18–15 in 2011–12 and earned a berth to the NIT, losing 96–76 in the first round at Oregon. Johnson resigned as LSU coach on April 8, 2012, in expectation of taking the same position at TCU.\nJohnny Jones era (2012–2017).\nOn April 13, 2012, Johnny Jones was officially named the 21st head coach of the LSU Tigers men's basketball team. He had an overall record of 90–72 in five seasons at LSU. In the 2014–15 season, Jones led LSU to its first appearance in the NCAA tournament since the 2008–09 season, where the Tigers fell to North Carolina State in their opening game, 66–65. In the 2015–16 season, Jones led the Tigers to a disappointing 19–14 overall record, including 11–7 in conference play. LSU was ranked 21st in the AP and 19th in the \"USA Today\" Coaches poll to start the season. Much of the hype was centered around a top 10 recruiting class which included the No. 1 overall recruit, Ben Simmons. LSU failed to earn a bid to the NCAA tournament, and declined to participate in any postseason play. Following the season, Simmons announced he would leave for the NBA draft.\nThe Tigers started the 2016–17 season 8–2, but finished the season with a 1–17 slide, ending 2–16 in SEC play and 10–21 overall. Jones was fired at the end of the season.\nWill Wade era (2017–2022).\nOn March 20, 2017, Will Wade was officially named the 22nd head coach of the LSU Tigers men's basketball team. During his second season, Wade coached the 2018–19 team to an outright Southeastern Conference regular season championship, LSU's 11th on record. However, the LSU Athletic Department suspended Wade before the conference tournament, after he refused to meet with university officials to discuss his role in conversations he is alleged to have had with a federally convicted college hoops middleman. LSU named Tony Benford interim head coach during Wade's suspension, and he coached the Tigers to the Sweet Sixteen of the 2019 NCAA basketball tournament. Wade was reinstated after the season, having met with university officials, answered their questions, and denied wrongdoing.\nDuring the 2021–22 season, the NCAA gave LSU a notice of allegations with regard to those recruiting violations, following a multi-year investigation.

The arena opened in 1972 and is home of the LSU Tigers basketball team. It was originally known as the LSU Assembly Center, but was renamed in honor of Pete Maravich, a Tiger basketball legend, shortly after his death in 1988. The Maravich Center is known to locals as \"The PMAC\" or \"The Palace that Pete Built\", or by its more nationally known nickname, \"The Deaf Dome\", coined by Dick Vitale.\nThe slightly oval building is located directly to the north of Tiger Stadium, and its bright-white roof can be seen in many telecasts of that stadium. The arena concourse is divided into four quadrants: Pete Maravich Pass, The Walk of Champions, Heroes Hall and Midway of Memories. The quadrants highlight former LSU Tiger athletes, individual and team awards and memorabilia pertaining to the history of LSU Tigers and LSU Lady Tigers basketball teams.\nJohn M. Parker Agricultural Coliseum.\nThe John M. Parker Agricultural Coliseum or John M. Parker Agricultural Center opened in 1937 and was home of the LSU Tigers Basketball team from its opening until 1971. The arena sat 12,000 people for basketball. The Coliseum was host to the Pete Maravich-led teams of the late 1960s, and it was his prominence that led to the construction of the LSU Assembly Center which now bears his name.\nLSU Gym/Armory.\nThe LSU Gym/Armory was completed in 1930 and was the home gymnasium of the LSU basketball team until 1937 when the John M Parker Agricultural Coliseum was completed, though for several years both the Gym/Armory and the coliseum were used for LSU's basketball games. The main floor was the gymnasium and the lower floor was the armory. Both floors were located on ground level. The gymnasium had a stage at one end and could be converted into an auditorium. When not set up as an auditorium, it provided an open space for basketball games and other events. The second floor provided space for locker rooms and a trophy room.\nState Field.\nState Field was the home court for the LSU basketball team from 1908 to 1924. The court was located outside on a grass surface built on the old downtown campus of LSU. It was located south of the Pentagon Barracks and slightly southwest of the site of the current Louisiana State Capitol Building adjacent to the Hill Memorial Library and George Peabody Hall. The field was later moved to a site with bleachers that was north of the campuses experimental garden, and next to the old armory building. The field was known on the campus simply as the \"athletic field\" and was also used for LSU's baseball and football teams.\nPractice and Training facilities.\nLSU Basketball Practice Facility.\nThe LSU Basketball Practice Facility is the practice facility for the LSU Tigers basketball and LSU Lady Tigers basketball teams. The facility is connected to the Pete Maravich Assembly Center through the Northwest portal. The facility features separate, full-size duplicate gyms for the women's and men's basketball teams. They include a regulation NCAA court in length with two regulation high school courts in the opposition direction. The courts are exact replicas of the Maravich Center game court and have two portable goals and four retractable goals. The gymnasiums are equipped with a scoreboard, video filming balcony and scorer's table with video and data connection. The facility also houses team locker rooms, a team lounge, training rooms, a coach's locker room and coach's offices.\nThe building also includes a two-story lobby and staircase that ascends to the second level where a club room is used for pre-game and post-game events and is connected to the Pete Maravich Assembly Center concourse. The lobby includes team displays and graphics, trophy cases and memorabilia of LSU basketball. A 900-pound bronze statue of LSU legend Shaquille O'Neal is located in front of the facility.\nLSU Strength and Conditioning facility.\nThe LSU Tigers basketball strength training and conditioning facility is located in the LSU Strength and Conditioning facility. Built in 1997, it is located adjacent to Tiger Stadium. Measuring 10,000-square feet with a flat surface, it has 28 multi-purpose power stations, 36 assorted selectorized machines and 10 dumbbell stations along with a plyometric specific area, medicine balls, hurdles, plyometric boxes and assorted speed and agility equipment.

Featuring seven teams—one from every state, plus the Australian Capital Territory—each season's winner is awarded the Ruth Preddy Cup. New South Wales have historically dominated the competition, appearing in the first 24 title deciders and winning 20 championships. The streak of final appearances was broken in the 2020–21 season when they finished in fourth place. Tasmania are the current champions, having won back-to-back titles across the 2021–22 and 2022–23 seasons.\nBeginning in 1996–97, the WNCL replaced the Australian Women's Cricket Championships which had taken place in a two-week tournament format since 1930–31. In conjunction with its Twenty20 counterparts—the more recently established Australian Women's Twenty20 Cup and its high-profile successor, the Women's Big Bash League (WBBL)—the league is cited as a bedrock foundation for developing the standard of women's cricket in the country, helping to produce world-class talent as well as attracting top international players. In particular, it is considered a crucial platform for Australia's finest young cricketers to further develop their skills and strive for national team selection.\nThe WNCL has experienced a rising level of professionalism since its inception, though the most notable breakthrough occurred in 2017 when the Australian Cricketers' Association negotiated a watershed deal with Cricket Australia to expand the total female payment pool from $7.5 million to $55.2 million.\nTeams.\nThe tournament features seven teams, with matches played across Australia at a combination of bigger venues including the WACA Ground in Perth and Blundstone Arena in Hobart, as well as smaller grounds including CitiPower Centre in Melbourne and Karen Rolton Oval in Adelaide.\nOriginally a five-team competition, the league was expanded to include the Australian Capital Territory in 2009–10 and Tasmania in 2010–11.

There had been two \"champion versus champion\" matches held (in 1999 and 2004), and many players on both sides of the divide played on TV tournaments on the other side from 1997–2001, but the 2005 Masters of Darts was the first televised tournament to be co-sanctioned by both organizations.\nThe 2005 Masters of Darts took place between February 7 and February 13, 2005 at the ExpoCenter in Hengelo, The Netherlands. The best four players from both federations were invited, with a BDO vs. PDC format in the round robin. The tournament was arranged by PenH Events, who managed to secure a three-year contract with Raymond van Barneveld, a BDO player at the time, taking part in the tournament. The host broadcaster was RTL5 in the Netherlands, who had also secured a three-year deal to broadcast the event. The tournament was not held in 2006 and by the time it was revived for 2007, SBS6 took over as Dutch broadcasters for the event.\nAt the time the 2007 tournament details were announced there were four BDO players, five PDC players and an unnamed wildcard scheduled to appear. In the weeks leading up to the event all four BDO players switched to the PDC making the tournament effectively a PDC tournament. The 2007 Masters of Darts instead had an England vs. Netherlands format in the round robin.\nFinal results.\n2005 event.\nPhil Taylor marched through the competition, winning all four group games against BDO players and dropped only two sets on the way.

        "title": "Jeff Jones (basketball)",
        "text": "Jeffrey Allen Jones (born June 29, 1960) is a former American college basketball player and coach. He was a four-year starter for the Virginia Cavaliers, helping his team to win an NIT title and reach the NCAA Final Four. He became an assistant coach and eventually the head coach at his \"alma mater\", with a tenure of eight years; he then coached the American Eagles for thirteen years; and the Old Dominion Monarchs for eleven years. In total, Jones was a head coach for thirty-two years, amassing a overall record and a winning record with each of his three programs, reaching the NCAA Tournament at each stop—including an Elite Eight run with Virginia in 1995.\nPlaying career.\nHigh school.\nJones graduated from Apollo High School in Owensboro, Kentucky. He was inducted into the Apollo High School Hall of Fame. His father, Bob, is a former coach of Kentucky Wesleyan, which he led to the 1973 NCAA College Division title.\nCollege.\nHe played point guard at the University of Virginia from 1978 to 1982. As a four-year starter at Virginia, Jones was known as a leader and prolific passer. During his playing career, the Cavaliers compiled an overall record of 102–28 (), while he helped lead the Cavaliers to two NCAA tournaments and two NITs during his career. Virginia captured the 1980 NIT title, and advanced to the NCAA Final Four in 1981.\nJones finished his career as Virginia's all-time assists leader (598), and his 200 assists during the 1979–80 season was UVa's single-season record until both marks were later broken by John Crotty. Jones served as the team captain as a senior during the 1981–82 season and played in 129 games during his career. For his career, he averaged 6.6 points and 4.6 assists per game, while shooting 52.2 percent from the field and 74.3% from the free-throw line.\nDespite being drafted by the NBA's Indiana Pacers in 1982, Jones never played as a professional. He graduated from Virginia in the same year with a Bachelor of Science degree in psychology.\nCoaching career.\nUniversity of Virginia.\nAfter graduation, he spent eight seasons as an assistant coach under Terry Holland at Virginia until being tabbed the 8th head coach in Virginia Cavaliers history in 1990. He would go on to lead that program for eight seasons. He led Virginia to six postseason appearances (five NCAA, one NIT), a share of the 1995 ACC regular-season title and four 20-win campaigns. He beat Roy Williams and #1 seeded Kansas in Kansas City to reach the Elite 8 in 1995.\nJones' tenure in Charlottesville crested at that point; he only had one winning season in his final three years. He resigned at the end of the 1997–98 season, having spent the first 20 years of his adult life at UVa as either a player, assistant coach, or head coach.\nAmerican University.\nFollowing a brief stint as associate head coach at Rhode Island, Jones was hired as the head coach at American University in 2000. After the school moved from the Colonial Athletic Association, he guided American to the 2002, 2004, 2008 and 2009 Patriot League regular season championships, and in 2002 he was honored as the Basketball America Patriot League Coach of the Year. However, the team fell in the conference tournament title game each year from 2002 to 2004, failing to garner an NCAA tournament bid.\nOn December 22, 2007, Jones led AU to its first victory over the University of Maryland in the last 80 years. Jones previously coached AU to victory over Florida State University, making him the only Patriot League coach to beat an ACC team.\nOn March 14, 2008, Jones led AU to its first NCAA tournament, as the Eagles beat Colgate 52–46. On March 22, 2008, Jones and the American University faced the Tennessee Volunteers at BJCC Arena in Birmingham, AL. Despite leading early on, American lost to Tennessee 72–57, ending American's NCAA trip.\nThe next year, Jones led the Eagles into the 2009 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament on March 19, 2009. After holding a 14-point lead over Villanova early in the second half, the 14th-seeded Eagles let the game slip away at the end, falling to Villanova at the Wachovia Center.\nDespite being a #2 seed in the 2011 Patriot League tournament, American was upset in the semifinal round, getting knocked off by Lafayette College in double overtime, 73–71.\nOld Dominion University.\nOn April 3, 2013, Jones was hired as the new head coach at Old Dominion University. As of the 2022–23 season, he had a 200–125 season record at ODU and had taken them to one NCAA tournament.\nOn December 20, 2023, Jones suffered a heart attack prior to coaching the Monarchs in the 2023 Diamond Head Classic. Despite making a full recovery, Jones resigned for the remainder of the season while special assistant coach Kieran Donohue fulfilled his role as the interim head coach. On February 26, 2024, he announced his retirement from coaching."

        "text": "Jason White (born June 19, 1980) is an American former college football quarterback who played for the Oklahoma Sooners. He was named a unanimous All-American and won the Heisman Trophy in 2003.\nEarly life.\nWhite was raised in Tuttle, Oklahoma. He attended Tuttle High School and played for the Tuttle Tigers high school football team. His parents owned a cement plant in east Tuttle.\nCollege career.\nWhite attended the University of Oklahoma, where he played for coach Bob Stoops's Oklahoma Sooners football team from 1999 to 2004. White played in a reserve role his true freshman season, behind Josh Heupel, the Sooners' starting quarterback. He redshirted his sophomore season in 2000; the Sooners went on to win the 2001 Orange Bowl and the BCS National Championship.\nNate Hybl beat out White for the starting quarterback job in 2001. Hybl hurt his right side in the first quarter of the Sooners' 14–3 win over #5 Texas and did not return. White replaced him and was 16-of-23 for 108 yards and ran 12 times for a team-high 38 yards. He started the next week against Kansas, throwing four touchdown passes to tight end Trent Smith. White continued to start the following games for the Sooners including a showdown with Nebraska, featuring the top two teams in the BCS for the second consecutive year. During the second quarter, White injured his ACL while completing a long pass to running back Quentin Griffin, ending his season.\nThe 2002 season started out with a preseason battle for the starting quarterback position between White and Hybl. White eventually won a close battle and was named the starter for the first game against Tulsa. After a slow start, the offense finally got rolling and they easily cruised to a shutout win. In the second game, the Alabama Crimson Tide came to Norman. White again went down with a knee injury, this time tearing the ACL in the opposite knee. Hybl came in as a backup and led the team to a hard-fought come-from-behind win, but the offense experienced some struggles in the second half. White would again be out for the season and Hybl led the team to a Big 12 championship and a victory over Washington State in the 2003 Rose Bowl game, being named MVP.\nAfter suffering from consecutive anterior cruciate ligament tears, White had reconstructive knee surgeries on both knees during the 2001 and 2002 seasons. Despite the fact that White could not scramble and the Sooners had to run every offensive play out of a shotgun formation, White won the Heisman Trophy in 2003 after throwing 40 touchdown passes and 8 interceptions. White was also the recipient of the Associated Press Player of the Year, unanimous All-American, consensus Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year, the Davey O'Brien Award, and the Jim Thorpe Courage Award in his 2003 season. He was also the 2003 NCAA QB of the Year as awarded by the Touchdown Club of Columbus. He was awarded a medical hardship by the NCAA and allowed to play a second senior year in 2004. He led the Sooners to the Big 12 championship game in 2003, which they lost to Kansas State.\nWhite was granted a medical hardship for the 2004 season. He was again a finalist for the Heisman Trophy in 2004, trying to become just the second player after Archie Griffin to win the honor twice, but instead finished third behind his Sooner backfield mate, runner-up Adrian Peterson, and winner Matt Leinart. White did win the Davey O'Brien Award for the second straight year, becoming the third quarterback ever to win the prestigious award two years in a row. White and Peterson led the Sooners to another national championship game, the Orange Bowl, in 2004, but lost 55–19 to Leinart's USC Trojans. White finished his collegiate career as the University of Oklahoma's all-time leader in career passing yards (8,012) and touchdown passes (81).\nWhite's on-the-field accomplishments have been further honored in Tuttle with the painting of a local water tower to read \"Home of Jason White 2003 Heisman Trophy Winner\". This tower is readily seen from the center of town, just west of State Highways 4 and 37. Additionally, a section of Cimarron Road in the city was renamed \"Jason White Boulevard\".\nProfessional career.\nDespite his strong college career, White was not selected in the 2005 NFL Draft. Reportedly, a number of teams were reluctant to select him due to his history of knee injuries. He did not receive a tryout from any NFL team in the first several weeks of post-draft free agency. White became the only Heisman Trophy winner to be unsuccessful in an attempt to play professional football and just the third Heisman Trophy winner not to be drafted in the NFL after Pete Dawkins instead chose a military career and Charlie Ward chose a career in the NBA. \nHe did eventually receive a tryout from the Kansas City Chiefs, who opted not to sign him. Eventually, the Tennessee Titans signed him as an undrafted free agent in 2005 for two years, but White decided not to attempt to play, citing weak knees from previous injuries. White has expressed an interest in coaching.\nLife after football.\nToday, White owns and operates the Jason White Companies, which owns A Store Divided, an OU/OSU memorabilia store, and a The Athlete's Foot shoe store. He also worked with insurance agent Steve Owens, another former Sooner Heisman Trophy winner and former athletic director at the University of Oklahoma. Prior to that, White worked briefly for a securities firm in downtown Oklahoma City. He is a co-founder and board member of St. Anthony Hospital's YourCARE Clinic community health centers.\nIn 2007, a bronze statue of White was dedicated on the University of Oklahoma campus in Heisman Park, commemorating his 2003 award.\nIn 2011, White co-owned the Bricktown Brawlers of the Indoor Football League.\nIn 2017, White was inducted into the Oklahoma Sports Hall of Fame.

        "text": "The United States men's national field hockey team represents the United States in the international field hockey competitions. The governing body is the United States Field Hockey Association (USFHA), which is a US Olympic Committee organization.\nThe team won bronze at the 1932 Summer Olympics, and has had success in the Pan American Games and Pan American Cup.\nField hockey is not a major sport at college level in the United States, so the men's team does not have as much experience as most other international teams that have professional players. The sport is largely thought of as a women's game in the United States; field hockey has historically been used as a \"Title IX\" sport to offset the numerous men who play college football, and as such, colleges have typically only sponsored women's field hockey teams. The players on the national team play overseas in European and Australian pro leagues. Despite this, the American team managed to achieve some limited success.\nTournament history.\nSummer Olympics.\nThe United States hosted the Olympic field hockey tournaments three times. In their first Olympics in 1932, Team USA hosted India and Japan. With only three teams in the tournament, the U.S. lost both their games and finished third for the bronze medal. The US was the host nation for the Los Angeles 1984 Olympic Games. During group stages, Team USA lost to Australia 2–1. In the 9th-12th place playoff, the US lost to Kenya in sudden death penalty strokes 6-5 after a 1-1 regulation and then lost 11th/12th place game to Malaysia 9–8 in sudden death penalty strokes after 3–3 tie in regulation. The team finished last in tournament play. At the Atlanta 1996 Olympic Games, the squad finished last again.\nFIH Hockey World Cup.\nThe US team has never qualified for an outdoor World Cup. However, the team has competed twice for the indoor World Cup, most recently in 2011.\nPan American Games.\nFinishing 5th at the 2015 Pan American Games, the USMNT missed out on qualifying for the Rio 2016 Olympic Games.\nPan American Cup.\nThe U.S. missed out on the final of the 2009 Men's Pan American Cup from a missed penalty stroke in normal time. Had the penalty been converted the team would have won the final vs Canada for direct qualification to the World Cup. As it was, they lost in overtime on a golden goal and Canada went to the 2010 World Cup in India.\nHockey World League.\nIn 2016, the USMNT competed in FIH Hockey World League Round 1 in Salamanca, Mexico. The U.S. Men's National Team put in a dominant performance to finish undefeated and as FIH Hockey World League Round 1 champions to secure a spot at FIH Hockey World League Round 2 in March 2017. The 6–1 win over Barbados added to USA's 33 goals while only allowing 2 over the 4 match tournament. Going into the final, the USMNT was familiar with their opponent as they had played Barbados in the first game and came out on top with a 3–1 victory. With the roster that was representing the US, the squad kept developing their play throughout the week culminating in a dominant performance in the final. Team USA finished third in Round 2 and didn't make it to the Semifinal Round of the 2016–17 Men's FIH Hockey World League.\nPlayers.\nCurrent squad.\nThe following 16 players were named on 9 July 2019 for the 2019 Pan American Games in Lima, Peru.\nHead coach: Rutger Wiese\n\"Caps updated as of 10 August 2019, after the match against Chile.\""

The Golf Club is situated in Heretaunga, Upper Hutt, just north of Wellington and alongside the Hutt River between Silverstream and Trentham.\nHistory.\nThe club was first established in 1895 at Miramar, until it experienced difficulties in renewing its lease in 1904. The Barton family of Trentham and Wairarapa owned extensive land in the Heretaunga area in the Upper Hutt Valley and offered to sell club 48.5 hectares of their estate. This offer was accepted in a Club meeting on 20 November 1906 and subsequently much of the land was cleared and marshes drained to construct the rudimentary course. Some club members donated trees and shrubs in these early years.\nBy 1908 the club had completed its move to Heretaunga and an 18-hole course had been completed along with a tennis court, croquet and putting green. Its historic and elegant clubhouse was designed by architects Crichton and MacKay. The club was opened in a ceremony on 25 April 1908, by Joseph Ward, Prime Minister and president of the club.\nCourse.\nThe course was expanded from 18 to 27 holes in 1972–73. The present championship course was redesigned by Greg Turner and Scott Macpherson and opened in 2013. There is also a nine-hole Terrace course, which takes in some of the most scenic parts of the club's property. Royal Wellington Golf Course is the host venue for the 2017 Asia-Pacific Amateur Championship.\nChampionships.\nSeven New Zealand Opens have been held at Heretaunga, the first in 1912, followed by 1932, 1954, 1976, 1981, 1987 and most recently in 1995, when Australian Lucas Parsons was the winner of the sixth and last open held at the club."

It represented the adjacent small towns of New Alresford and Old Alresford in Hampshire. According to John Arlott, between about 1770 and 1795 Alresford \"stood higher in cricket than any town its size has done in the history of the game\".\nDuring this period there were four grounds in Alresford. The main one was Itchin Stoke Down, which as of 1978 was part of Itchen Down Farm. Tichborne Down was also used for important games. Matches were also played on The Nythe and on Fob Down. Old Alresford and New Alresford often played each other, the latter usually winning, but for some fixtures they put out a joint team.\nConnections with Hambledon.\nIts period of greatness roughly coincided with that of the even more eminent Hambledon, not too far distant. Many Alresford players also appeared for Hambledon, including Tom Taylor, Richard Aubrey Veck and the Freemantle brothers, Andrew and John. Some of Hambledon's matches, even including some fixtures with All-England, were played at Alresford.\nIn 1778 Hambledon announced home and away fixtures with Alresford for fifty guineas a match, with no \"given\" men. At this period it was common for the weaker team to bring in players from outside, or from their opponents, to even things up. That this was not thought necessary in this case indicates Alresford's perceived strength."

It organizes the Bosnian basketball championship, the Bosnia and Herzegovina national basketball team, for men and women, senior and youth categories.\nHistory.\nBasketball came to Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1929. The Basketball Federation was founded on April 3, 1950 as a part of the Yugoslav Federation. As a part of former Yugoslavia, many Bosnian players and coaches were part of medal winning teams in the FIBA World Championship, Eurobasket and Olympic Basketball Tournament. KK Bosna won Yugoslav championship titles in men's, and ŽKK Željezničar Sarajevo and KK Jedinstvo Tuzla in women's categories. Bosna and Jedinstvo Tuzla also won a European Champions' Cup (now known as Euroleague) in 1979 and 1989, respectively.\nIndependent Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nSince Bosnia and Herzegovina gained independence, the Basketball Federation has transformed into the sport's national governing body. It was accepted by FIBA on September 15, 1992. There are close to 150 basketball clubs in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with more than 5,000 registered players.\nThe Basketball Federation is the organizer of the national championship and cup competitions. As a result of war, three separated championships and cups were played until the late 1990s. They were organized according to ethnic divisions. In 1998. joint playoffs were first organized, and today one league is being played in the country. "

        "text": "A climbing lane, crawler lane (UK), or truck lane, is an additional roadway lane that allows heavy or underpowered vehicles to ascend a steep grade without slowing other traffic. They are typically used by large trucks or semi-trailer trucks, which go uphill more slowly than they travel on level ground. They are often used on major routes such as motorways and interstate highways.\nA more modern variation is to keep an existing lane for slow traffic and make the additional lane a passing lane. This keeps slow traffic in the slowest lane even if drivers neglect to change lanes, while allowing drivers who wish to pass the choice of changing lanes to do so.\nDownhill lanes.\nSome climbing lanes extend slightly over the crest of the hill, to allow slow vehicles to regain speed.\nAs trucks and recreational vehicles must use low gear to descend slowly, an additional lane may also be built on the downhill side. This prevents the vehicles from overusing their brakes, which may overheat and cause a runaway vehicle.\nSome downhill truck lanes may also have a nearby runaway truck ramp, which can help catch and slow down runaway trucks that have brake failures to prevent a serious collision.

        "title": "Ma Lin (table tennis)",
        "text": "Ma Lin (; born February 19, 1980) is a retired Chinese table tennis player and the current Chinese Women's Team Head Coach. \nHe learned to play table tennis at the age of five and became a member of the provincial team in 1990. In 1994, he joined the Chinese national team. Ma Lin is the only male player ever to win Olympic gold in Singles, Doubles and Team. Additionally, he previously held a professional era record of 5 major titles (4 World Cups and 1 Olympic Gold), having won more World Cups than any other male table tennis player in history.\nHe has since been surpassed by Ma Long who has won 7 major titles.\nHe has won a total of 18 world championships in his life.\nSince retiring in December 2013, Ma Lin has been serving as the head coach of the Guangdong provincial table tennis team. Ma Lin has been appointed as the head coach of the China National Women's Team from December 2022.\nStyle and equipment.\nMa Lin uses the penhold grip. An aggressive player, he is known for his converse unpredictable serves, heavy short push receives, fast footwork, and powerful third ball attacks. In addition to possessing a solid backhand block, Ma Lin also uses the reverse penhold backhand (RPB), an innovative stroke utilizing the underside of the blade which allows a penholder to produce topspin from both wings. The most dangerous weapon Ma Lin has in his arsenal, however, is his consistent forehand loop, which he often uses to end a point decisively. He is also considered a master at serving and his serve is considered one of the best in the world, earning the nickname \"Ghost Service\". It involves the ball bouncing back to the net instead of going straight off the table.\nBecause of this, Ma Lin has claimed the titles \"Maestro Ma Lin,\" \"Defense Killer,\" and \"Table Tennis Olympic Champion.\"\nMa Lin is currently using a Yasaka Ma Lin Extra Offensive Penhold as his blade. He uses DHS NEO Skyline 2 TG2 for his forehand and Butterfly Bryce Speed FX for his backhand.\nCareer.\nIn the China Table Tennis Super League, Ma Lin played for Bayi Gongshang, Shandong Luneng, Guangdong Gotone, Shaanxi Yinhe and Ningbo Haitan. His transfer to Shaanxi Yinhe for over 5 million Chinese yuan was a league record. His next transfer was to Ningbo Haitan for just 1.3 million yuan (US$168,000), including 1 million yuan in salary.\nMa Lin’s training attitude was very serious, especially during the preparation for the Guangdong Ninth National Games. The training volume is large and the training time is long.\nMa Lin not only practiced hard to serve but also practiced multiple balls back and forth, which requires a wide range of running. He practiced so hard that broke a pair of sneakers every week. He has won four World Cup trophies (2000, 2003, 2004, 2006), more than any other player in history, but has lost three times in the World Championship finals (1999, 2005, 2007). Three times he reached the final, but three times he returned with hatred. The 1st time, in the 1999 World Table Tennis Championships in Eindhoven, Ma Lin played a heroic role, defeated Samsonov and Waldner, and reached the final. In the final, Ma Lin faced Liu Guoliang.The two fought to a 2-2 draw, and Liu Guoliang led 23-22 in the final game. Ma Lin blocked and Liu Guoliang won 24-22.The 2nd time, in the 2005 Shanghai World Table Tennis Championships, in the men’s singles final, Ma Lin trailed Wang Liqin 2-3 and 7-10 in the 6th game. Finally, Ma Lin lost the match 7-11.The 3rd time, at the World Table Tennis Championships in Zagreb in 2007, Ma Lin met Wang Liqin again in the final. Ma Lin made full preparations, leading 3-1 and 7-1 in the fifth game. However, Wang Liqin staged a shocking reversal and once again defeated Ma Lin.\n2004 Olympics: Coaches Cai Zhenhua said that Ma Lin was the best of the three Chinese players. Surprisingly in the following round Ma Lin lost to Waldner. Ma Lin was shocked, and the coaches suddenly had a big problem: there was no one protecting the bottom half of the draw. They were also worried about men’s doubles, because one of their two pairs had been eliminated in the first round. If Ma Lin could not adjust in time, with Chen Qi’s inexperience, the last pair might be out of the event before long. Ma Lin and Chen Qi were able to withstand the pressure, won the next three rounds, and the important gold for China. Ma Lin / Chen Qi played against Denmark’s Maze / Tugwell who just eliminated Waldner / Persson in the semifinals. Ma Lin / Chen Qi won the first game. In the second, they were ahead 10-6 and were caught up by the Danes, losing that game 11-13. After the score was tied at 2-2 in games, Ma Lin / Chen Qi fell behind 6-9 in game 5, but came back to win it 13-11.Ma Lin / Chen Qi played against the Hong Kong pair Ko Lai Chak / Li Ching in the finals. Although there were some problems, and they lost the third and fifth games, they had the better spirits in that match.\nIn the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Ma Lin won the teams competition with his compatriots Wang Liqin and Wang Hao. In the men's singles, Ma Lin defeated Korean player Oh Sang Eun in the quarterfinals (4-0), his rival Wang Liqin in the semifinals (4-2). Ma Lin defeated his compatriot Wang Hao (4-1) in the finals. Ma took the game 11-9, 11-9, 6-11, 11-7, 11-9. Ma Lin is now 15-10 head-to-head against Wang Hao. \nMa Lin is considered to be the true Olympiad of table tennis, because he has grabbed all possible titles in the Olympics (Athens 2004 - Doubles Champion with Chen Qi, Beijing 2008 - Singles Champion, Team Events Champion). Furthermore, Ma Lin was inducted into the ITTF Hall of Fame in 2010.\nCoaching career.\nAfter retirement, Ma Lin has been a coach for the Chinese national team. Since 2013, he has coached the Guangdong provincial team. Ma Lin was appointed as the head coach of the China National Women's Team from December 2022. \nPersonal life.\nMa Lin's alleged girlfriend, Bai Yang, was dropped from Women's National Team in 2004. It is against the rules to date in the Chinese National Team for athletes under twenty years old. Ma Lin went on to secretly marry actress Zhang Yi in late 2004. They divorced in 2009. On this Ma Lin stated, \"Table tennis would be my wife forever. This will never change.\" Ma Lin married Zhang Yaqing in December 2013. On April 19, 2016, they had a son.\nAnecdotes.\nIn April 2024, a LeetCode profile became famous as it bore Ma Lin's photo and description and was in the top 0.01% of LeetCode users.\nChinese journalists investigated this and discovered it has nothing to do with the famous tennis table athlete.\nAchievements.\nOlympic Games:\nWorld Championships:\nWorld Cup: \nPro Tour Grand Finals: \nPro Tour Singles Winner (×20)\nPro Tour Doubles Winner (×37)\nAsian Games:\nAsian Championships:\nAsian Cup:\nNational games:\n1997 National Games, Shanghai : Champion (Team), Runner-up (Singles) \n2001 National Games, Guangzhou : Champion (Singles), Champion (Doubles, with Liu Guozheng)\n2005 National Games, Nanjing: Runner-up (Doubles, with Zhangchao) \n2009 National Games, Shandong : Runner-up (Team)\n1998 National Championships : Champion (Team), Champion (Mixed Doubles, with Sun Jin), Runner-up (Doubles, with Qin Zhijian), Third (Singles)\n1999 National Championships: Champion (Singles), Champion (Doubles, with Qin Zhijian),Third (Mixed Doubles, with Zhang Yingying)\n2003 National Championships: Champion (Team), Champion (Mixed Doubles, with Wang Nan), Third (Doubles, with Chen Qi)\n2006 National Championships: Champion (Singles), Champion (Doubles, with Chen Qi), Champion (Mixed Doubles, with Wang Nan)\n2007 National Championships: Champion (Doubles, with Wang Liqin)\n2010 National Championships: Champion (Team), Third (Doubles, with Zhang Jike)\n2011 National Championships: Champion (Doubles, with Wang Hao), Runner-up (Singles), Third (Team)\n2012 National Championships: Third (Doubles, with Zhangchao)"

        "title": "Grimsby Tennis Centre",
        "text": "Grimsby Tennis Centre is a tennis club in Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England. It was founded by members of the Welholme Methodist Church on grass courts in Welholme Road, Grimsby. In order to protect the membership from personal liability the club was formed into a Limited Company (Company number 00179077) on 16 January 1922. The land in Weelsby Avenue was purchased in April 1922 and so the tennis facility on this site predates the surrounding houses that were built in about 1930. Although the Tennis Centre is a Limited Company, its constitution requires that any profits are used to improve the facility. Elected Directors serve for a period as defined in the Memorandum and Articles of Association.\nEarly development of the site.\nThe former pavilion was of timber; electricity was only installed in 1960 to replace gas lighting. The former bar, towards the right-hand side of the photograph, was erected and opened in 1959 as an addition to the pavilion and it was enlarged a mere 4 years later. Some land at the rear of the former pavilion was purchased in 1961 and land adjacent to the drive was bought as a turf nursery in 1955.\nA tennis practice wall was built in 1972 and the squash court was built in 1973. It was the second Squash (sport) court in the town and was erected to meet the rising need. Now the boom in squash has subsided the court is used for mini tennis and racquetball.\nTwo hard courts were built in 1984 after the former red shale courts had given good service. In fact they had given more than good service. Each time they were used they had to be dragged and sifting out the large pieces of 'clinker' became a regular occupation. After all of this work it was inevitable that you would travel home with red socks and red legs caused by the fine dust.\nChange from grass.\nMajor development involving erection of a new clubhouse, floodlights, construction of the car park and replacing the grass courts with Tennisweave synthetic grass carpet took place in 1989 after months of careful planning. This high specification artificial grass surface, unlike many synthetic carpet courts, uses very little sand, which therefore provides a good foothold. To finance the £100,000 project, two grass courts nearest to Weelsby Avenue were sold for housing.\nLeading to success.\nThe success of the development produced results on the court and in 1991/92 the Men's teams were particularly successful. The First Team won the Lincolnshire Men's First Division for the first time in the Club's history and the Men's Third Team were promoted to the Third Division. Players in the squad were: Trevor Kelly, Tim Smith, Andrew Lashbrook, Allan Thompson, Jamie Thompson (15), Duncan Proctor.\nFurther progress and development at the site was made in 1993 with the successful application for a Sports Aid Grant which allowed the laying of two all-weather synthetic grass courts to replace the worn out hard courts. The new synthetic grass is different from that already laid with more sand providing a higher bounce during wet weather in particular.\nIn 1994/5, for the first time in its history, the North Kelsey League allowed a Grimsby team to enter the League and Welholme had the honour.\n1996/7 saw a Men's veterans team successfully enter a new Lincolnshire Veterans' League, coming second by the width of a sideline at the first attempt.\nThe Peaks Parkway was completed and opened to traffic in October, 1998 and the eastern boundary of the Club was made more secure.\nMarch 1999 saw the Men's Veteran's Team finally achieve their reward for some difficult matches and long journeys by winning the Lincolnshire Veterans' League.\nLottery funding.\nDirectors of the Club embraced the Lawn Tennis Association's Club Vision programme and began work on development of the Club. There are practically no tennis facilities for the disabled and part of the development of the club would address this issue in North Lincolnshire. Detailed and lengthy submissions were made to the Sports Aid Foundation, the National Lottery, the Football Trust and Foundation for Sports and the Arts. Support for the bid was forthcoming from the LTA and a huge redevelopment of the Club started in August 2003. The development, costing £250,000 saw the whole site under construction work. All of the courts were replaced; four synthetic grass courts so enjoyed by players of all abilities, two floodlit acrylic courts as used in the US Open, which are especially good for wheelchair tennis, and a state of the art Club House with ample luxurious accommodation.\nProject leader.\nThe project was led from start to finish by Andrew Lashbrook, who was subsequently offered position by the charities funding the work. The grand opening was on 12 April 2003.\nChange of name.\nIn recognition of the scale of the development and the place of the facility as the leading tennis and squash venue in Grimsby, Cleethorpes and the area of North Lincolnshire, the Club changed the name to Grimsby Tennis Centre.\nThe name derived from Grimsby Tennis Club which used to be the premier location for the sport in North Lincolnshire and which hosted many Lincolnshire Closed Tournaments at their grounds in College Street, Grimsby before the memberships dwindled and the land was eventually sold for housing development. Many notable players started their tennis careers at the College Street courts; Shirley Bloomer, Eric King and several local players of high repute in Lincolnshire and beyond:- Bernard Finneran, Matt Sheader, Bill and Connie Moran. Peter Brown and many more. The traditions of the old Club are maintained in the new facilities at Grimsby Tennis Centre."

        "text": "Benjamin William Smith (born 16 October 1984) is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer who played as a and for the Parramatta Eels in the NRL.\nEarly life.\nSmith was born in Quirindi, New South Wales, playing for his junior club, the Werris Creek Magpies.\nRugby league career.\nSmith made his first grade debut in round 20 of the 2004 NRL season for Parramatta against Melbourne Storm in a 22–16 loss at Olympic Park in Melbourne.\nHe established himself in the NRL in 2005, when he had a boom rookie season alongside club namesake, Tim Smith. The monster centre of 102 kg, easily big enough to play in the forwards, damaged opposition teams out wide with his size and strength, he played 18 games and scored 14 tries in an outstanding rookie year. Smith was a part of the 2005 Minor Premiership winning side which made it to the preliminary final before suffering a shock loss going down to North Queensland 29–0.\nThe 2006 NRL season loomed as a learning curve season for Smith as after initially showing all the promise he had from the previous season, he sustained a serious leg injury against the North Queensland Cowboys in round 4, and was sidelined for half the NRL season. He only managed 14 games for three tries, however, it provided the platform for him to return to his best in 2007.\nPlagued by injuries, Smith's young career has been shortened by extended periods when he was not fit to play. Throughout the 2007 and 2008 seasons, he was in and out of the Parramatta backline. In the 2009 NRL season, Smith began playing in the forward pack. The decision by Eels coach Daniel Anderson was not surprising, given Smith's 16 stone physique. Smith played for Parramatta in the 2009 NRL Grand Final 23–16 defeat against Melbourne. Melbourne were later stripped of the premiership for major and deliberate breaches of the salary cap.\nIn the 2010 NRL season, Smith played 19 games as Parramatta failed to build upon their grand final appearance in 2009, missing the finals series by finishing 12th. The following year in 2011, Smith played nearly every game for the club as they narrowly avoided the wooden spoon. Parramatta defeated the Gold Coast in the final game of the year to avoid finishing last.\nOn 13 May 2012, Smith re-signed with the Eels until the end of the 2014 NRL season. Parramatta would finish last on the table in 2012 for the first time since 1972. In June 2013, Smith was one of 12 Parramatta players that were told that their futures at the club were uncertain by coach, Ricky Stuart. Parramatta would finish the 2013 NRL season with the Wooden Spoon for a second consecutive year.\nSmith retired at the end of the 2014 NRL season, finishing his career a one club player with 152 games for the Parramatta Eels."

        "title": "Addington Cricket Club",
        "text": "Addington Cricket Club fielded one of the strongest cricket teams in England from about the 1743 season to the 1752 season although the village of Addington is a very small place in Surrey about three miles south-east of Croydon. The team was of county strength and featured the noted players Tom Faulkner, Joe Harris, John Harris, George Jackson and Durling. The team immediately accepted the Slindon Challenge, in 1744, to \"play against any parish in England\". The only other club to accept was Robert Colchin's Bromley.\nMatches.\nIt is not known when the Addington club was founded and the team played its earliest known game, in London, in 1743. At the Artillery Ground on 25 July, Addington defeated the foremost London Cricket Club by an innings &amp; 4 runs. London scored 32 &amp; 74; Addington 110. Kent players Robert Colchin, \"aka\" \"Long Robin\", and Tom Peake played for Addington as given men while Surrey's William Sawyer was given to London.\nIt was after Slindon defeated London in September 1744 that it issued its challenge to the rest of England. Addington and Slindon met at the Artillery Ground on 12 and 13 September but the occasion was ruined by bad weather and the match could not be concluded.\nAddington and London won a home game each against each other in 1745. The best Addington players were frequently involved in single wicket contests, which were hugely popular throughout the 1740s. They also played often in representative teams. Tom Faulkner in particular was one of the most influential figures in the sport. In 1746, Addington beat Bromley \"with great difficulty\" on Bromley Common but a return match at the Artillery Ground was inconclusive. In 1747, Addington joined forces with nearby Croydon to play three matches against London: they won one, lost one and one had an unknown result. In 1748, the \"best five\" Addington players took part in a big single wicket contest against \"The Rest of England\". One of the Addington five was described as \"the shoemaker that lately came out of Kent\". It is possible that this shoemaker was Durling, who first made his presence felt that season. Durling's origins are otherwise unknown.\nSigns of Addington's decline can be seen at the end of the 1740s. On 10 July 1749, \"Five of All-England\" defeated \"Five of Addington\" at the Artillery Ground. The match was played for fifty guineas a side and was the result of a challenge by the Addington players to meet any other five in England. Betting was 8–1 in favour of Addington but the team of Faulkner, Joe Harris, John Harris, George Jackson and Durling was beaten by Colchin, John Bryant, Robert Eures, John Bell and Thomas Waymark. On 17 July, in a return match, the same Addington five beat the same All-England five for fifty guineas. But on 26 July in a deciding match, All-England won by 2 runs, scoring 11 and 12; Addington replied with 16 and 5. The prize this time was 100 guineas. All-England made two changes to its team with James Bryant and Val Romney replacing Bell and Waymark. Addington's five were unchanged.\nOn 17 July 1750, Addington lost a sensational match to the re-emerging Dartford by 6 runs on Dartford Brent. Dartford scored 46 and 34; Addington replied with 39 and 35. William Hodsoll and the two Bryants all played for Dartford as given men. According to the \"London Evening Post\" on Thursday 19 July, Dartford lost its last five second innings wickets in five successive deliveries by a mixture of caught and bowled, but still won.\nThere are more Addington games in the records until the end of the 1752 season but then there is nothing more, apart from occasional mentions of Faulkner and Durling who played into the 1760s. The Addington cricket ground still exists, is still in use for local games and is held to be one of the oldest in England."

        "text": "Bromley Cricket Club was one of the strongest English cricket clubs in the mid-18th century when its team was led by Robert Colchin a.k.a. \"Long Robin\".\nEarliest mentions.\nCricket almost certainly originated in Kent and Sussex so it must have been played in and around Bromley since time immemorial. The first definite mention of the area in a cricket connection is a 1735 match on Bromley Common between a Kent side and London Cricket Club. The report of this match states that \"a large crowd attended and a great deal of mischief was done. It seems that horses panicked and riders were thrown while some members of the crowd were ridden over. One man was carried off for dead as HRH passed by at the entrance to the Common\". \"HRH\" was Frederick, Prince of Wales.\n1740s.\nApart from Colchin, Bromley also produced noted players like John Bowra, his son William Bowra and the brothers James and John Bryant.\nA match took place in June 1742 between London and Bromley at the Artillery Ground which is the second known instance of a match finishing as a tie.\nThe club probably reached its peak in September 1744, a time when Colchin was also at the pinnacle of his career. Following the victory over London by Richard Newland's Slindon at the Artillery Ground, the \"Slindon Challenge\" was issued to \"play any parish in England\". They received immediate acceptances from Addington Cricket Club and from Bromley who were due to play Slindon in the same month.\nBromley was a top-class team through the 1740s until its final important match in 1752, two years after Colchin's death."

        "title": "Weybridge Rowing Club",
        "text": "Weybridge Rowing Club, founded in 1881, is a rowing club by the Thames in England, on the Surrey bank. \nThe club organises head races, notably the Weybridge Silver Sculls which has had Olympian winners and co-organises a May/June regatta. It consists of a wide range of members: juniors, novices, seniors, masters (veterans) – these include many past and present champions.\nIt fronts the minor, upper weir stream associated with Shepperton Lock on a long, thin island separated by footbridge and narrow canal from the rest of Whittet's Ait, Weybridge. The local stretch of Thames – to Sunbury Lock – is roughly 5 km from topmost weir to bottommost weir and is shared with seven other well-established watersports clubs: the rowing clubs of Walton, Saint George's College, Weyfarers, Weybridge Ladies, Thames Valley Skiff Club, Elmbridge Canoe Club and Desborough Sailing Club.\nHistory.\nIn 1881 Weybridge Rowing Club started life as the local \"tradesmen's\" rowing club, as opposed to clubs for gentlemen or as latterly called \"certified amateur's\" such as Walton's begun in 1927.\nIn 1919 the club joined National Amateur Rowing Association (NARA) which was set up as a rival to the ARA. The ARA for several decades forbade manual workers to compete in its regattas. \nAfter the 1914–18 war, women enjoyed greater freedom and were made more welcome in many sports, the club included a women's event in their \"Peace\" regatta and formed a women's section, captained by Amy Gentry.\nIn 1924 a coxed four from the club represented Great Britain in the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris – V.J. Boveington (stroke), E.W. Hann, J.H. Townend, B.C. Croucher and cox H.L. Barnsley. They narrowly missed bronze and won many regattas at home. \nIn 1926 Amy Gentry founds Weybridge Ladies Amateur Rowing Club, the then women's section of the club, which moves a few hundred metres downriver to its base.\nIn 1920 Weybridge Regatta (continued as Walton &amp; Weybridge Regatta) is founded, as today held on the Walton Mile. The regatta was known as NARA's \"Henley\" and attracted large crowds for the rowing and following fireworks. Weybridge was one of the few clubs on the Thames to remain open during the Second World War when the regatta was suspended.\nIn 1956 the Weybridge Silver Sculls, the oldest sculling head on the non-tidal Thames began – held in October each year. It soon regularly attracted over 500 entries and attracts many hundreds today. The famous trophy was made by the event's founder, \"Dickie\" Bird.\nSuccessful juniors of the 1960s to 1980s included J Crozier, C Roberts, C Fuller, Peter Levy, Mike Webb, Ian Shore, Jeff Hunt, Paul Wensley, Duncan Nicholl and Jonathan Hulls, for Great Britain in international competitions. Today about one third of the active members are juniors — more if local school groups in Wey to Row and other events are counted. \nRe-emergence of women at the club began when Carol Adamson became its first female captain in 1990. Their leading eight came 8th in the Women's Head of the River in 1993 in a field open category of about 150 and reached the finals of Club Eights at Women's Henley in 1992 and 1993. Across all boat types (singles to eights) the women in each subsequent decade have won a larger haul of outright wins than the club's men, bucking the trend of previous decades. Across various age categories they won ten events in 2018 across the British Masters Championships and European Masters Regatta. This places the multi-generational women's age-28-plus cohort on an alike footing to Molesey, Thames and London.\nIn 1991 Weybridge Veterans Head was founded, held each March. It hosts eights and fours, and has now expanded to juniors.\nSister club.\nIn 2000 a still well-linked sister club, Weyfarers, took on its own outings, racks and hut. It is a community of rowers who want to row for enjoyment and to keep fit, with no or little interest in racing. In 2003 Weyfarers hosted the FISA Recreational Rowing Tour on the Thames of 95 participants from 15 countries rowing from Oxford to Putney, London in 18 boats. This raised the profile of touring rowing in the UK.\nAccreditation.\nWeybridge Rowing Club was awarded \"Clubmark\" status, Sport England's quality certification which confirms the club's excellent standard of care and coaching for juniors.\nCourses.\nIn 2007 Weybridge Rowing Club Junior Squad launched its annual 'WEY To Row' Junior Courses in the Summer Holidays, led by the main coaches and ex-Weybridge juniors, Chris Jones and Jack Percival.\nMembership.\nWeybridge is a well established club and has experienced coaches and a community atmosphere. Currently there are a variety of different ages and abilities of rowers from twelve upwards. They regularly race and train together as well as organising training outings and social events. Seniors (nationally defined as 18 plus with no upper limit) and Masters (aged 28 plus, at minimum) are the heart of the club, racing through all seasons of the year.\nSince 2006 the club has had its Weybridge Rowing Club Junior Squad (WRCjnr) Team led by trained, accredited coaches and volunteers. Proficiency and coaching from a young age are taught which assists with beginner courses regularly. The club has good to excellent boats, competes on membership price accordingly, generous family discount, and has a capital fundraising prize draw/quarterly social subscription club, volunteer coaches, donations and equipment/facilities/events sponsors."

        "text": "William Michael Joyce (September 22, 1867 – May 8, 1941) was an American professional baseball player and manager. He was a third baseman over parts of eight seasons with the Brooklyn Ward's Wonders (of the Players' League), Boston Reds (of the American Association), Brooklyn Grooms, Washington Senators, and New York Giants. He also served as manager during his tenure with the Giants.\nJoyce was born on September 22, 1867, to Irish immigrants in St. Louis, Missouri. He worked in a rolling mill before beginning his minor league career in the Texas League in 1887. He continued in the Texas League in 1888 and 1889.\nJoyce impressed St. Louis Browns player-manager Charlie Comiskey at a December 1889 exhibition game, leading Comiskey to recommend that Players' League founder John Montgomery Ward hire Joyce for his Brooklyn Ward's Wonders club. In the Players' League's lone season, Joyce led the league in walks, with 123 in 133 games. In 1891, he reached base in 64 consecutive games, a major league record not bettered until 1941. After the Players' League folded, Joyce signed with the Boston Reds of the American Association for that league's final year, 1891. He then joined Monte Ward's Brooklyn Grooms for the 1892 season. After an offseason trade, he held out against the Washington Senators for the entire 1893 season. He returned in 1894 and was named team captain.\nJoyce became a leading slugger for the next several seasons; between 1894 and 1898, he led the majors in home runs (60), was fifth in slugging percentage (.497), and seventh in on-base percentage (.444). He tied for the National League lead in home runs in 1896 (with Ed Delahanty) while playing for Washington and New York, and finished second three other times. He holds the record with four triples in one game, which he accomplished in 1897 (tying George Strief's 1885 record). Joyce served as player-manager with New York.\nDespite generally being popular with other players, Joyce gradually lost favor with Giants owner Andrew Freedman and was not brought back after the 1898 season. Joyce also developed a reputation as a frequent and vociferous critic of umpire calls, earning numerous fines for arguing. Pioneering baseball writer Henry Chadwick criticized his \"pernicious habit of stupid kicking.\"\nIn 906 games over eight seasons, Joyce posted a .293 batting average (971-for-3,310) with 822 runs, 153 doubles, 106 triples, 70 home runs, 609 RBI, 266 stolen bases, 721 bases on balls, .435 on-base percentage and .467 slugging percentage. His walk rate of 17.3% was the second-highest in major league history between 1871 and 1920, the advent of the live-ball era.\nAfter retiring in December 1899, Joyce held many jobs, including saloonkeeper, minor league owner and manager, professional baseball scout, security guard, and municipal smoke inspector. He married in 1908.\nJoyce died on May 8, 1941, in St. Louis, at the age of 73. He is buried at Bellefontaine Cemetery.\nExternal links.\n, or Retrosheet"

        "title": "Pinch hitter (cricket)",
        "text": "In cricket, pinch hitter or slogger is a term for a batter who is promoted up the batting order in order to score quick runs. \nEtymology.\nThe term \"pinch hitter\" comes from baseball as the batter is expected to score some quick runs and relieve the pressure without having much concern of losing the wicket.\nRole.\nThe term is used to denote a batter who is promoted up the batting order. It is often done in limited overs cricket to increase the rate of scoring and relieve the pressure while chasing a big target. Often pinch hitters aren't expected to stay for too long and hence, are usually lower order batters or all rounders whom the batting side can afford to lose in the effort to score quick runs. They might come in instead of the regular designated batter typically at a critical points in a match.\nHistory.\nThe term was introduced to cricket during the 1992 World Cup when New Zealand employed the tactic to good effect with Mark Greatbatch and England promoted Ian Botham to a similar role. It was later employed by opening batsmen to target bowlers with hits over the infield when the fielding restrictions are in place during the initial overs in ODI cricket and popularized further by Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana of Sri Lanka during the 1996 World Cup. Krishnamachari Srikkanth of India is considered one of the pioneers of pinch hitting when he played similar form of cricket more than ten years before Greatbatch when the term was not coined. After the success of Sri Lanka in the 1996 World cup, more players like Shahid Afridi of Pakistan, Herschelle Gibbs of South Africa and Adam Gilchrist of Australia started adapting the same. Sachin Tendulkar and Mark Waugh adapted a different way of playing the role by scoring rapidly by using classical styles to find the gaps in the field rather than go over the top. Later players like Virender Sehwag and Chris Gayle took to aggressive batting and the introduction of Twenty20 cricket saw such hitting becoming a regularity with more batters oriented towards it."

His natural position was shortstop, but he had the misfortune to be with the White Sox while Chico Carrasquel played the position, followed by all-time great Luis Aparicio.\nA native of Alquízar, Cuba, Rodríguez played in the Negro leagues with the New York Cubans, 1939 and 1944, and in the Mexican League, 1945–46 (Riley, 676) prior to the integration of organized baseball,\nBefore the 1951 season, Rodríguez was acquired by the Brooklyn Dodgers from the Tuneros de San Luis Potosí of the Mexican League. He was assigned to Brooklyn's farm club, the Montreal Royals, where he batted .302. On December 6 of that same year he was traded by the Dodgers to the Chicago White Sox for first baseman Rocky Nelson.\nRodríguez was Chicago's regular third baseman during the 1952 season. He appeared in 124 games for the 81–73 White Sox and hit .265 with 1 home run and 40 runs batted in. He drew 47 walks and was hit by pitches 3 times, raising his on-base percentage to .346.

Rodríguez went back to the minor leagues in 1953, and on October 8 of that year was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League for pitcher Don Johnson.\nWhile Rodríguez never again made it back to the big league level, he had an outstanding career with the Toronto Maple Leafs when they were the top-drawing team in the International League during the 1950s. He teamed with second baseman Mike Goliat to turn spectacular double plays. Rodríguez was so good at the position, the White Sox sent a film crew to Toronto to record his skill at turning double plays to be used in training their minor league shortstops. He was renowned for his underhand flip throws from deep in the hole between shortstop and third base, a throw not seen in Toronto until Tony Fernandez played shortstop for the American League Toronto Blue Jays in the 1990s.\nRodríguez died at the age of 83 in Cancún, Quintana Roo, Mexico.\nExternal links.\n and Seamheads"

        "title": "Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball",
        "text": "The Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball team is the intercollegiate men's basketball program representing the University of Virginia. The school competes in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Virginia has won the , two National Invitation Tournaments, and three ACC tournament titles. The team is coached by Tony Bennett and plays home games at the on-campus John Paul Jones Arena (14,623) which opened in 2006. They have been called the \"Cavaliers\" since 1923, predating the Cleveland Cavaliers of the NBA by half a century.\nVirginia won its first NCAA Championship in 2019, and won the last third-place game ever played at the Final Four in 1981. The Cavaliers have been ranked in the Top 5 of the AP Poll more than 100 times since 1980, and have received seven No. 1 seeds in the NCAA tournament.\nVirginia was a top program in the early years of college basketball under the tutelage of Pop Lannigan from 1905 to 1929 and a consistent winner under multi-sport coach Gus Tebell from 1930 to 1951, but the Cavaliers struggled through the 1950s and 1960s before Terry Holland arrived in 1974 to win their first ACC Championship and earn their first NCAA tournament appearance in just his second year. The program has since won 11 ACC season titles, third-most in conference history. In the recent 18-game ACC era (2012–2019), Virginia had four out of the five ACC teams that finished 16–2 or better in conference play. As of 2024, Virginia has had 13 consecutive winning ACC seasons, the longest active streak among ACC programs.\nHistory.\nThe \"Wahoos\", as they are unofficially known, began their history under the tutelage of a Welshman and American immigrant known best as \"Pop\", Henry Lannigan. Lannigan began the program in 1905 after training Olympic Games hopefuls in track and field and quickly brought the basketball program into near-dominant form. He led the Cavaliers to a perfect record of 17–0 in 1914-15 and a Southern Conference title in its inaugural season of 1921–22. After reaching prominence the team was invited to help the nationally known Kentucky Wildcats showcase their new Alumni Gymnasium. Virginia dominated Kentucky, 29–16. Inviting Kentucky back to Memorial Gymnasium in 1928, Virginia again won, 31–28. Lannigan held the Virginia record for best career winning percentage by a head coach (254–95 (.728)) until he was surpassed by Tony Bennett, who was hired 104 years after the start of the program.\nAfter Lannigan's sudden death in 1930 and with limited administration interest at the onset of the Great Depression, Virginia basketball did not maintain its momentum into the next several decades. Buzzy Wilkinson scored 32.1 points per game in 1954–55 and is still the all-time ACC leader in scoring per game for both the single-season and career (28.1) categories. He was selected by the Boston Celtics in the 1955 NBA draft. Unfortunately, Virginia teams of the era were not as great at defense and high scoring did not lead to many wins. Likewise, Barry Parkhill was named ACC Men's Basketball Player of the Year in 1971–72 and was drafted in the first round by the Portland Trail Blazers but the program had not regained its early standing.\nTerry Holland was hired from Davidson in 1975, and with star Wally Walker surprised the ACC in just his second year as head coach when his sixth-seeded Virginia defeated AP No. 17 NC State, No. 9 Maryland and No. 4 North Carolina en route to winning the school's first ACC Championship. Played in Landover, Maryland, it was also and fittingly the first ACC Tournament held outside of North Carolina. Athletic, quick, and seven-foot-four, Ralph Sampson was perhaps the most desired high school recruit in college basketball history when he chose to play with Jeff Lamp at Virginia over Kentucky in 1979. He lived up to that hype would become one of the most dominant college players the game has ever known, winning three consecutive Naismith College Player of the Year awards to tie him with Bill Walton as the most awarded individual player in NCAA history. Virginia would attain its first AP Top 5 rankings and go to in Sampson's era, but would be stonewalled by Dean Smith and North Carolina both in that Final Four and in ACC tournaments. Carolina notoriously held the ball in a four corners offense for most of the last seven minutes of the game, despite having UNC's most celebrated NBA superstars Michael Jordan and James Worthy on the floor, to defeat Virginia in the 1982 ACC tournament 47–45. Both the shot clock and three-point line were implemented into college basketball during the same decade in part to combat such shenanigans. In 1984, after Sampson was drafted first in the 1983 NBA draft, Virginia made a Cinderella run back to the Final Four. There they lost 49–47, in overtime, to a Houston team led by the first pick of the 1984 NBA draft, Hakeem Olajuwon, who then joined Sampson to form of the NBA on the Houston Rockets.\nJohn Crotty and Bryant Stith took the darkhorse 1988–89 team to the Elite Eight after defeating AP No. 2 (and No. 1 seed) Oklahoma which returned most of its lineup (including Stacey King and Mookie Blaylock) from the team that reached the 1988 NCAA Tournament Championship Game. After Holland retired the next year, the Cavaliers were coached by Jeff Jones for eight years, Pete Gillen for seven, and Dave Leitao for four. Highlights of those teams include a Jones team headlined by Cory Alexander and Junior Burrough that also reached the Elite Eight after a first-place finish in the ACC standings of 1995. There were no championship teams under Gillen, but his recruits Sean Singletary and J. R. Reynolds led the 2007 team to Virginia's next conference-topping finish in Leitao's second season. While there were flashes of brilliance under each of the three coaches, the program regained and expanded its national prominence under the coach who followed them.\nTony Bennett arrived in March 2009 and got to work in building \"a program that lasts.\" His 2013–14 team led by Joe Harris and Malcolm Brogdon brought Virginia its first ACC Tournament Championship in 38 years and its first Sweet Sixteen appearance in 19 years. The 2014–15 squad, led by Justin Anderson and Brogdon, started 19–0 and was even more dominant throughout the season as this team more than doubled up the scores of Georgia Tech and Wake Forest, only the second and third times in history that one ACC team scored twice as many points as another ACC team in official competition. However, Anderson broke his finger against Louisville and did not return until the NCAA Tournament where he was much diminished and the team bowed out to Michigan State in the second round. Brogdon led the 2015–16 team to the Elite Eight, but they fell just short of the elusive Final Four after a late rally by Syracuse. Shocking the basketball world twice in two years, Virginia lost to 16-seed UMBC in the first round of the 2018 NCAA Tournament only to come back and win the 2019 NCAA tournament championship the very next year. ESPN called Virginia's 2018–19 campaign \"the most redemptive season in the history of college basketball.\" \"CBS This Morning\" called it \"basketball's ultimate redemption story\" the morning after the national championship match.\nAs of 2023, Bennett has led Virginia to the program's first NCAA Tournament Championship, third Final Four, second and third ACC Tournament Championships, and six of eleven seasons Virginia has finished first in the ACC season standings. He holds the single-season wins record with 35 from the 2018–19 season, breaking his own previous record of 31.\nNCAA Final Four teams.\nVirginia is 3–2 at Final Four events and won the 2019 NCAA tournament championship.\n1981: Sampson and Goliath.\nLed by Coach Terry Holland, National Player of the Year Ralph Sampson and his first team All-ACC teammate Jeff Lamp, the Cavaliers rolled to their best season in school history. After beginning the season with a 23–0 record, the Cavaliers would claim the ACC Regular Season title before falling in the ACC Tournament Semifinals. Despite the loss, UVA still entered the NCAA tournament as the 1 seed in the East Regional of the 1981 NCAA tournament.\nUVA received a first-round bye and squeaked by Villanova 54–50 in the 2nd round. They then handled both Tennessee and Brigham Young by 14 points each in the Sweet 16 and Elite 8 respectively to clinch a berth in the program's first ever Final Four in Philadelphia. Although UVA swept North Carolina in the ACC regular season, the Tar Heels defeated the Cavaliers when it mattered most, in the national semifinals. Virginia closed the season on a high note, however, defeating Louisiana State in the national third-place game to cap the program's most successful season to that point.\n1984: Virginia plays Cinderella.\nFollowing the loss of their vaunted All-American in Sampson, the Virginia basketball team took a step back in 1983–84, at least in the regular season. The Cavaliers limped into the ACC tournament with a 17–10 (6–8) record, promptly falling to Wake Forest in the first round. Their record was good enough to ensure them an NCAA tournament invite and they were awarded the 7-seed in the East Regional.\nAfter escaping 10th-seeded Iona 58–57 in the first round, Virginia drew Southwest Conference champion and 2nd-seeded Arkansas in the 2nd round. The Cavaliers dispatched the Razorbacks 53–51 in an overtime affair before cruising past 3rd-seeded Syracuse 63–55 in the Sweet Sixteen. In a low-scoring, defensive affair, the Cavaliers defeated Bobby Knight's 4th-seeded Indiana Hoosiers 50–48 in the Elite Eight to clinch the school's second Final Four appearance in 4 seasons.\nIn the National Semifinals, Virginia drew the Hakeem Olajuwon-led Houston Cougars at the Kingdome in Seattle. The Cavaliers gave the vaunted Phi Slama Jama lineup all they could handle, but eventually fell 49–47 in overtime, ending a surprisingly-successful postseason run.\n2019: Redemption National Championship.\nComing off a loss to 16-seed UMBC a year prior, the Virginia team returned with a vaunted Bennett defense along with the three-pronged offensive attack of De'Andre Hunter, Kyle Guy, and Ty Jerome. The Cavaliers began and ended the season ranked in the AP Top 5, with a 28–2 regular season record and both losses to Zion Williamson's AP No. 1 ranked Duke squad under Coach Krzyzewski. Those two Virginia–Duke matchups during the ACC regular season were the most watched college basketball games of the regular season with 3.8 million and 3.3 million viewers for their games in Durham and Charlottesville respectively. In the ACC Tournament, Virginia defeated bubble team NC State 76–56 before being defeated by Florida State, 69–59. Entering the NCAA Tournament, Virginia was a No. 1 seed in the South region, Duke was the No. 1 overall seed and placed in the East region, while North Carolina also received a No. 1 seed but in the Midwest region. The only No. 1 seed from another conference was Gonzaga in the West, later to be defeated by Texas Tech in the Elite Eight.\nVirginia was the sole No. 1 seed of the tournament to advance to the Final Four after defeating Purdue. After first defeating Gardner-Webb, Oklahoma, and Oregon, they met the Boilermakers in the Elite Eight. Purdue's Carsen Edwards scored 42 points against Virginia, setting an individual scoring record against a Bennett-coached team. With Virginia down by three points with 5.9 seconds to play, Ty Jerome stepped to the line for two free throws, converting the first but missing the second. Mamadi Diakite back tapped the ball into the backcourt where Kihei Clark recovered it and passed back to Diakite with one second remaining in the game. Diakite immediately scored, and the game went into overtime. Virginia then outscored Purdue 10–5 in the extra period to advance. Jerome, Diakite, and Kyle Guy each made the South Regional All-Tournament team.\nIn the Final Four, Virginia met the Auburn Tigers who had already dispatched Kansas, North Carolina, and Kentucky to get there. This game was a back-and-forth battle as Virginia trailed the Tigers at halftime, 31–28. Virginia led by as many as 10 points in the second half before Auburn retook the lead late in the game. Down 61–57 with 7.7 seconds remaining, Guy scored a three-point shot from the right corner. Harper then converted one of two free throws to lead 62–60. Two controversial non-calls (one against Auburn, one against Virginia) by officials preceded Auburn being called for a foul with 1.5 seconds remaining. On the in-bounds play Jerome found Guy, again for the corner three, but Guy missed as an Auburn player fouled him by undercutting his lower body. Guy converted all three free throws to put Virginia into the 2019 NCAA Tournament Championship Game.\nThe National Championship match was headlined by two of the top defenses in college basketball, Virginia and the Texas Tech Red Raiders. Texas Tech did not score a field goal for the first 7 minutes and 11 seconds of the game, but eventually tied the game at 19 with 7 minutes and 33 seconds remaining in the first half. The teams traded leads until halftime, with Virginia holding a 32–29 advantage at intermission. Eventual top-10 picks in the subsequent NBA draft De'Andre Hunter and Jarrett Culver shot 1-for-8 and 0-for-6 from the field respectively in the first half, but Hunter shot 7-for-8 in the second half to end with a career-high 27 points while the NABC Defensive Player of the Year sophomore limited Culver to 5-for-22 shooting and a 15-point total. Texas Tech rallied from a deficit to take a late lead before Virginia scored in the closing seconds to take the game into overtime. Virginia outscored Texas Tech 17–9 in overtime to win their first national title 85–77.\nVirginia ended the season with a 35–3 record, breaking the school record for wins in a single-season. The team was 29–0 after leading at halftime. The Cavaliers were the first first-time champions of the NCAA Tournament since the University of Florida thirteen years earlier. In light of the previous year's loss to UMBC, ESPN called Virginia's championship run \"the most redemptive season in the history of college basketball,\" and NBC Sports described it as \"the greatest redemption story in the history of sports.\"\nACC Tournament championship teams.\nVirginia has won the ACC tournament three times, defeating Duke or North Carolina in each title game.\n1976: Miracle in Landover.\nThe 1975–76 Cavalier season was largely disappointing as they finished 13–11 overall (4–8, ACC) and limped into the ACC tournament as the 6th seed. Played at the Capital Centre in Landover, Maryland, the tournament was the first in ACC history to be played outside the state of North Carolina.\nDespite falling to NC State twice during the regular season, the Cavaliers upset the 3rd-seeded Wolfpack 75–63. The Cavaliers then drew 2-seed Maryland, longtime border rivals that had just defeated UVA five days earlier at Cole Fieldhouse. Virginia defeated the AP No. 9 Terrapins, before dispatching top-seeded and AP No. 4 North Carolina 67–62 in the championship game. It marked the first conference tournament title and NCAA appearance for Virginia, as well as only the 3rd time a non-North Carolina-based team won the conference title (following Maryland in 1958 and South Carolina in 1971). Wally Walker scored 21 points and grabbed 7 rebounds in the title game, being named tournament MVP in the process.\nVirginia was awarded the East Region's 7 seed in the NCAA tournament, where they fell to 2nd-seeded DePaul in the first round.\n2014: Bennett Ball arrives.\nAfter a few years of steady improvement, Tony Bennett finally had a team he had fully recruited and coached. The Cavaliers got off to a forgettable 9–4 start, punctuated by a 35-point road loss at Tennessee. Following a pivotal conversation between star G/F Joe Harris and Bennett, UVA got on track and rolled through the ACC. On March 1, the 12th ranked Cavaliers would defeat #4 Syracuse at John Paul Jones Arena to clinch the ACC regular season title outright for the first time since 1981, allowing them to enter the 2014 ACC men's basketball tournament as the 1-seed.\nAfter cruising against 8th seeded Florida State, Virginia held off 4th-seeded Pittsburgh in the final seconds of the semifinal, setting up a championship game against 3rd seeded Duke at Greensboro Coliseum. The Cavaliers would exact revenge for a regular season loss to the Blue Devils, defeating them 72–63 and claiming their first ACC tournament title in 38 years. Joe Harris was named tournament MVP while Malcolm Brogdon joined him as a 1st team selection. In the process, UVA defeated every ACC opponent at least once in a season for the first time since 1982.\n2018: Calm before the storm.\nAfter losing all-conference point guard London Perrantes to graduation and the Cleveland Cavaliers, many expected 2017–18 to be a rebuilding year for Virginia basketball. The team would start the season unranked before getting off to an 11–1 non-conference start and climbing up to No. 13 in the country at the start of conference play. Virginia would then become the first team to go 17–1 in conference play, notably snapping a long losing streak at Cameron Indoor Stadium against Duke, scoring 5 points in 0.9 seconds to stun Louisville at the KFC Yum! Center, and only losing one conference game by a single point in overtime.\nThey would open the ACC tournament by routing 9th-seeded Louisville 75–58 in the quarterfinals before dispatching 4th-seeded Clemson 64–58 in the semis. They would then rematch with a North Carolina team they had defeated earlier in Charlottesville and claim the ACC championship with a 71–63 win. Kyle Guy was named tournament MVP and was joined on the First team by Devon Hall as the Cavaliers gave Tony Bennett his second ACC tournament title in 5 seasons.\nSeasons.\nResults by season (1980–present).\n \n \nPostseasons.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Cavaliers have appeared in the NCAA tournament 26 times. Their combined record is 35–25. They were national champions in 2019.\nNCAA Tournament seeding history.\nVirginia is one of five NCAA programs to earn a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament seven or more times.\nThe NCAA began seeding the NCAA Tournament with the 1979 edition. The 64-team field started in 1985, which guaranteed that a championship team had to win six games.\nNIT results.\nThe Cavaliers have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) 14 times. Their combined record is 19–12. They were NIT champions in 1980 and 1992.\nCBI results.\nThe Cavaliers appeared in the inaugural College Basketball Invitational (CBI), in 2008. Their record is 2–1.\nRivalries.\nAnnual Home-and-Away Series.\nLouisville Cardinals.\nFollowing conference realignment, the Cardinals moved from the Big East to the ACC and were designated UVA's home-and-away rivals. The two teams had previously met for four straight years outside of their conferences in the 1980s during an era both programs were highly ranked. The Cavaliers won each of those games in 1982, 1983, 1984, and 1985. In the ACC, the two teams have acted as spoilers to the other with a Cardinal win in 2015 and a 2017 Cavalier win delaying or preventing an ACC regular season title, while an injury to star player Justin Anderson during the 2015 matchup derailed UVA's national championship aspirations. The March 2018 matchup between the two teams ended with Virginia scoring five points in the final 0.9 seconds and dealing what proved to be a mortal blow to Louisville's NCAA tournament hopes. Both teams won recent NCAA Championships — Louisville in 2013 and Virginia in 2019. UVA leads the all-time series 16–5.\nVirginia Tech Hokies.\nAs the two Power Conference teams in the Commonwealth, the Cavaliers and Hokies have a long-standing rivalry. While the intensity has picked up since Virginia Tech joined the ACC in 2004, the all-time series record is well in favor of UVA, with the Cavaliers leading the series 95–56.\nOther rivalries.\nNorth Carolina Tar Heels.\nAs the two oldest universities of the ACC, the UVA–UNC rivalry spans many sports and has persisted to varying degrees since the late 1800s. The early 1980s were a particular highlight for the basketball series as all-time greats Ralph Sampson and Michael Jordan led two Top 5 programs of the era. The Tar Heels have dominated much of the all-time series and lead 131–60, but Virginia is 11–4 against the Heels since the Cavaliers began their rise back to national prominence under Tony Bennett in the 2012–13 season. The two teams defeated each other for ACC Tournament Championships in 2016 and 2018, and the winner of those conference title matches went on to win NCAA Championships the following year (UNC in 2017 and UVA in 2019).\nMaryland Terrapins.\nThanks to the proximity of these two long-time ACC members, and their status as Tobacco Road outsiders, Maryland and Virginia have a long-standing rivalry that spans many decades. Traditionally, these two schools would meet in the last game of the season, and acted as spoilers to each other as they sought ACC season championships and NCAA Tournament appearances. This rivalry has been diminished in recent years, thanks to Maryland's move to the Big Ten Conference. They did match up in the 2014 and 2018 ACC-Big Ten Challenges, ending in 76–65 and 76–71 victories both won by Virginia on the road in College Park.\nCoaches.\nVirginia has had 11 head coaches lead the Cavaliers. The longest tenure was Pop Lannigan, who coached the team for 24 years starting in 1905.\nIndividual honors.\nRetired numbers.\nThe Cavaliers have retired eight numbers to date:\nRetired jerseys.\nThe University of Virginia's athletic department has issued the following statement distinguishing \"retired jerseys\" from \"retired numbers\": \"Jersey retirement honors Virginia players who have significantly impacted the program. Individuals recognized in this way will have their jerseys retired, but their number will remain active.\""

        "text": "World Tour Golf is a 1986 video game by Evan and Nicky Robinson, Paul Reiche III and published by Electronic Arts for Commodore 64, Amiga, Apple IIGS, and DOS.\nDevelopment.\nAfter completing \"Mail Order Monsters\" in 1985, developers and producers at EA were playing \"Nintendo Golf\", and the Robinsons decided to create a golf game for DOS including a golf course editor.\nEvan Robinson worked on the game and graphics code (which was adapted from code written by Dan Silva for an internal EA editor named Prism, which eventually became Deluxe Paint) for \"World Tour Golf\", while Nicky Robinson created the editor and Paul Reiche acted as game designer and artist. In 1986 it was unusual for a game to have more than one programmer, and this gave them an easy way to neatly subdivide the work. It also allowed \"World Tour Golf\" to be a significantly larger game in scope than many contemporary titles. The editor supported the accurate (for its day) re-creation of real golf courses, as well as comical courses that were made up of a series of islands, 270-degree doglegs, etc. This followed in the spirit of \"Racing Destruction Set\", which had been developed at EA the year before.\nReception.\n\"COMPUTE!\" called \"World Tour Golf\" \"a great game for the novice and the expert\". The game was reviewed in 1988 in \"Dragon\" #132 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \"The Role of Computers\" column. The reviewers gave the game 4½ out of 5 stars.\nDavid M. Wilson and Johnny L. Wilson reviewed the game for \"Computer Gaming World\", and stated that \"IBM owners with CGA used to have to play with magenta trees and blue fairways, but a revision has corrected that aesthetic problem and supports EGA, as well. The EGA version still offers only the four best colors, however.\""

        "text": "The Papua New Guinea National Rugby League Competition (or the PNGNRL for short, for sponsorship reasons the PNGNRL Digicel-ExxonMobil Cup) is a semi-professional rugby league competition held annually in Papua New Guinea. Changes in sponsorship have meant it was Formerly known as the SP Inter-City Cup or SP Cup (1990–2008) and later the Bemobile Cup (2009–2010). The current competition is sponsored by pacific telecommunications giant Digicel and new co-naming rights sponsor ExxonMobil (one of the world's largest publicly traded oil and gas companies) which joined in 2023 and so it is currently called the Digicel-ExxonMobil Cup.\nHistory.\nPrevious to 2005 the PNG NRL was called the SP Inter-City Cup. The national competition was known as the SP Cup, and has been held since 1990. No competition was held in 2004 due to financial problems and province violence in certain provinces. But the competition returned for 2005 season as the new-look PNGNRL. Much like the new PNGNRL format the old SP Inter-City Cup had teams competing in a format much like the Australian National Rugby League format, with the top four clubs at the end of the rounds entering play-offs, culminating in a Grand Final held in the capital city Port Moresby.\nThe 2005 season had eight teams in total from all around Papua New Guinea. In 2006 one team got relegated (Monier Broncos) to make way for two new teams, Central Raiders and Pagini Warriors. The inaugural winner of the competition was the Agmark Gurias who beat the Brian Bell Bulldogs in Port Moresby. In the short history of the tournament the competition has shown high levels of rugby league play in Papua New Guinea.\nIn 2009 local mobile telecommunication Company, Bemobile, took over from SP Brewery as the competitions major sponsor. Currently 9 teams compete in the competition.\nOn February 9, 2011, telecommucations company Digicel who has taken over the industry in PNG since its operation started in 2007, announced that it will be sponsoring PNG's premier sporting event for the next five years."

        "text": "In ice hockey, a pest is a player who attempts to antagonize opponents either by physical play or verbal incitement. Pests employ legal, illegal, or borderline tactics to accomplish their goals. Some common tactics include chirping or slashing and hooking while referees are not looking. They may employ the tactic of goading opponents into a fight but then backing off in order to draw a penalty against them. Some pests may not only use these tactics against opposing skaters, but opposing goaltenders as well. Pest and agitator are sometimes used synonymously, as both are usually characterized by short bursts of intensity and speed with the intention of creating havoc. \nThe term has been used derogatorily to refer to a player who incites anger in the opposition but is unwilling to directly suffer the consequences of their actions by engaging in fighting, as would an enforcer. George McPhee, former general manager of the Washington Capitals and president of the Vegas Golden Knights, said, \"Pests are really the guys who have no courage. They start stuff and don't back it up.\"\nExamples of pests in NHL.\nIn February 2001, \"Hockey Digest\" published a list of the NHL's best pests. They were: Bob Kelly, Matt Cooke, Esa Tikkanen, Tomas Holmstrom, Darius Kasparaitis, Ian Laperriere, Tyson Nash, Todd Harvey, Matthew Barnaby, Kris Draper, Bill Lindsay, Jamal Mayers and Steve Staios.\nIn 2009, \"Sports Illustrated\" also compiled their own list of \"Notable Pests of the NHL\". Their list included: Claude Lemieux, Steve Ott, Jordin Tootoo, Jarkko Ruutu, Matt Cooke, Alexandre Burrows, Chris Neil, Ian Laperriere, Darcy Tucker, Chris Simon, Matthew Barnaby, Theo Fleury, Pat Verbeek, Esa Tikkanen, Ken Linseman and Tiger Williams."

        "title": "Basketball Löwen Braunschweig",
        "text": "Basketball Löwen Braunschweig () is a basketball club based in Braunschweig, Germany. The club currently plays in the Basketball Bundesliga, the top tier of German basketball. The club's home arena is Volkswagen Halle. Founded in 2001 as Metabox Braunschweig, the club was established as the separated professional team of SG Braunschweig.\nHistory.\nThe team was formed as a new company in 2000, taking over the Bundesliga license of SG Braunschweig. The newly formed team was named Metabox Braunschweig.\nThe new name sponsor (Metabox) had to abandon the project after only a couple of months, due to insufficient financial means. The club was saved by the communal sports association and from 2001 up to the end of the 2001–2002 season, it had a new name: StadtSport Braunschweig. In the season 2002–2003, the team played under the new name TXU Energie Braunschweig. In the 2003–2004, the club again was renamed BS Energy Braunschweig. At the end of the 2005 – 2006 season Braunschweig finished the season at the bottom of the table, which usually leads to a team being relegated to the second highest German Basketball League, ProA. The Basketball Bundesliga (Germany's top basketball league) had just committed to expanding the number of teams, so there were two extra wild card slots that could be purchased for an amount of 100.000 Euro. The club's financial resources, however, were rather scarce, due to the lack of success in the previous seasons. Therefore, team was only able to afford the license, because of the help of three sponsors (BS Energy, Öffentliche Braunschweig, Volkswagen Sport Förderung). BS Energy relinquished the right to name the club, but did not reduce the financial support, neither did the other two sponsors.\nIn the 2006–2007 season, NewYorker, a clothing company from Braunschweig, acquired the naming rights. They narrowed their ideas for a new name down to three options and let the fans vote for a new name for the club. 78% of the fans voted for the name NewYorker Phantoms Braunschweig, a potentially confusing name for the brand that could be mistaken for a team from New York.\nIn the 2009–2010 season, the team reached the 8th seed and the playoffs for the first time in 7 years. After beating the No.1 seed in the quarter finals 3:1, they were swept 3:0 by the Brose Baskets, who went on to win both, the championship and the midseason tournament, the German Cup.\nIn the Season 2010–2011 the team reached the final-four tournament of the \"BBL-Pokal\" , after beating the league rival EWE Baskets Oldenburg 88:76 in the previous round. \nIn the 2011– 2012 season, the Phantoms were able to reach the semi-finals of the league cup (BBL-Pokal) again, but lost to Telekom Baskets Bonn. They finished the regular season as a 7th seed, but were swept by ratiopharm Ulm in the first round of the Playoffs. During the season, the then coach Sebastian Machowski had already announced his resignation for the end of the season. He joined EWE Baskets Oldenburg and was replaced by the Greek coach Kostas Flevarakis.\nIn the 2011–2012 season, the team was not able to match the performance of the previous seasons. They found themselves at the bottom of the table for the entire season, but were able to escape relegation on the penultimate match day of the season, when they were able to beat the Walter Tigers Tübingen on the road. The biggest positive of that season was the emergence of Dennis Schröder in Braunschweig. His individual performances lead to him being named not only the \"best German youth player 2013\", but also the \"most improved player 2013”. However, head coach Flevarakis was let go after the season. \nIn the 2013–14 season, Raoul Korner became the new Phantoms coach. He had previously been coaching the Dutch team Eiffel Towers Den Bosch. The phantoms finished that season as an 8th seed.\nBefore the beginning of the 2014–2015 season, the name sponsor New Yorker announced that they were not going to extend their commitment with Braunschweig's basketball team. After that, the team was renamed Basketball Löwen Braunschweig., the new team colors being blue and yellow (previously white/red). \nAfter the end of the 2015–2016 season, head coach Raoul Korner left the Basketball Löwen and joined Medi Bayreuth, a German rival. Frank Menz, became his successor. \nAssembling a roster for the 2016–2017 was rather problematic, due to the lack of funds. So the team went into the season with low expectations that were proven adequate, after they finished the season with merely six wins, which should have led to them being relegated to the second highest German basketball league, ProA. But, since the league rival Phoenix Hagen had to file for bankruptcy, an additional spot in Germany's first league became available for the Basketball Löwen. \nIn February 2018, the then established NBA player Dennis Schröder, who was born and raised in Braunschweig, indicated interest to become a shareholder of the team and vowed to lead them into the top five of Germany. In March of the same year, it was officially announced that Schröder would become a shareholder/partner of the operating company that ran the team. Since the season 2018–19, Dennis Schröder has been the majority shareholder of the Basketball Löwen Braunschweig. In that season the team was able to reach the playoffs as the 8th seed but were swept 0:3 by Bayern Munich.\nDespite the first playoff berth since the 2011–2012 season, the head coach Frank Menz left the Basketball Löwen after three seasons. The Austrian-American Coach Peter Strobl was then hired to coach the team in the 2019–2020 season.\nOn 1 July 2020, Schröder became the sole owner of Braunschweig after purchasing the remaining 30% of shares. On 24 August 2020, the club revealed its new logo and club colours black and gold.\nSponsorship names.\nPartly due to sponsorship reasons, the club has been known under several names:\nClub identity.\nThe logo of the club features a lion.\nArena.\nThe Löwen's home games take place at the 3,603 seat Volkswagen Halle, which opened in 2000. The team's predecessor SG Braunschweig had previously hosted its games at the 1,500 seat \"Sporthalle Alte Waage\".\nFarm team.\nFrom 2000 to 2015, SG Braunschweig, playing in the 2. Basketball Bundesliga respectively ProB, served as the club's farm team. In 2015, SG Braunschweig entered into a cooperation with MTV Herzöge Wolfenbüttel. Starting with the 2015–16 ProB season, both clubs will field a joint team which will play in Wolfenbüttel and serve as a farm team for the Basketball Löwen Braunschweig.\nSeason by season.\n Braunschweig was spared relegation due to the expansion of the Basketball Bundesliga from 16 to 18 teams for the 2006–07 season."

They play at the Recreation Ground on the Oxford Road and are members of the Home Counties Premier Cricket League. The club also has three other men's teams which play in the Cherwell League and one which plays friendly matches on Sundays, and has a large youth section with U17, U15, U13 and U11 teams and achieved Clubmark accreditation in 2008.\nHistory.\nCricket has been played in Horspath for more than a century. It is thought that the Cricket Club was founded in the mid 1890s possibly 1894 - two years after the formation of the Parish Council - when a game was played against Garsington.\nThe cricket pitch was originally located in a field to the northwest of the Current pitch. Pads were unknown and players sported the same hobnailed boots and leather leggings they wore at work on the farm.\nThe pitch was a field which had been ploughed for centuries in a \"ridge and furrow\" pattern around the contour of the hill. This prevented water running off and created a series of ridges and valleys in the land, making fielding interesting to say the least. Matches were limited to neighbouring villages because of transport limitations.\nThe present pitch was created in 1924 when the Parish Council acquired the land.\nIn 1926, the Parish Council acquired a First World War army hut from Wendover. It was brought to Horspath on a horse and cart and placed in the corner of the current car park. This was to become the village hall and cricket pavilion.\nThe outfield was only levelled in the 1960s - a decade which also saw the introduction of Sunday Cricket. It hadn't been allowed before as it was considered to be disrespectful to the Church.\nThe current village hall was opened in 1965 and recent times have seen improvements to the clubroom, changing rooms and the installation of two all weather outdoor nets.\nIn 2001 the club merged with another local cricket club in the area. However this move was unsuccessful and Horspath reformed in the winter of 2003-4.\nHorspath CC 2004-.\nSince the reforming of the club in the 2004 season, the club has enjoyed its most successful run: Adrian Manger has led the 1st XI to four consecutive promotions from Division 5 in 2004 to Division 2 for the 2007 season. While Gordon Hamilton (and in 2006 Alex Eason) have mirrored this in the 2nd XI by gaining three consecutive promotions leaving the 2nd XI in Division 6 for the 2007 season having been in Division 9 in 2004. In the 2006 season the club introduced a 3rd XI, who went on to win Division 9b. To cap off a remarkable 2006 season the club reached the final of the Oxfordshire leg of the Village Cup.\n2007 proved to be another highly successful year for the club with Adrian Manger leading the 1st XI to the Division 2 title (4 years of consecutive promotion), while Nick Birks led the 3rd XI to the Division 8 title. The 1st XI once again reached the final of the Oxfordshire leg of the Village Cup, only to lose by bowl-out.\nThe 2008 season will see the 1st XI playing the highest standard of cricket in the club's history in the Oxford Times Cherwell League's Division 1."
