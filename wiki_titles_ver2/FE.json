        "text": "The 44th FIE Fencing World Cup began in October 2014 and concluded in July 2015 at the 2015 World Fencing Championships held in Moscow.\nSeason overview.\nThis edition was the first to feature the new Grand Prix format, consisting in nine events, three in each weapon, men and women fencing together. World Cup and Grand Prix competitions were spread over ten months instead of six. The calendar overhaul was designed to allow more time for the athletes to train and rest as well as to increase media visibility.\nThe season saw the opening of the qualifying path for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. The first competition counting for Olympic qualification was held on the 2 and 3 May for all three weapons, an event dubbed as the \"super weekend\" in Italy. The season was also marked by the FIE's cancellation of the men's sabre Dakar World Cup, due to take place on the 1 and 2 November 2014, as a preventive measure because of the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa. In February 2015, the French delegation withdrew at the last minute from the women's foil World Cup in Algiers because of protests over the depiction of Muhammad after the Charlie Hebdo shooting.\nIn men's épée, France's Gauthier Grumier won his third World Cup series with a lead of 59 points over Switzerland's Max Heinzer. After a disappointing season, Italy's Rossella Fiamingo earned a European silver medal, then a consecutive second world title. She became the first Italian female epeeist to finish world no.1 since Elisa Uga in 1990, with a 2-point-lead over China's Xu Anqi and a 4-point-lead over Hungary's Emese Szász. France led the rankings in men's team épée with two gold medals and a continental title, followed by South Korea. In the women's, China finished no.1 thanks to two gold medals and a world title, ahead of Romania with four podium placings and a continental gold medal.\nIn women's foil, Elisa Di Francisca interrupted fellow Italian Arianna Errigo's streak of three series victories by finishing world no.1 for the second time in her career, with three gold medals in a row in Havana, Tauberbischofsheim and Shanghai, and a second consecutive European title in Montreux. She was closely followed by Errigo, who led the rankings for most of the season with three gold medals too, and by Russia's Inna Deriglazova, who claimed five medals and the World title. American Lee Kiefer was the only non-European to win a World Cup event and finished no.4. In men's foil, Race Imboden became the first American male fencer to win the overall World Cup. As in the previous season, three Americans featured in the Top 10. In women's team foil, Italy lost their crown to Russia, who won four gold medals out of five World Cup events. In the men's, Russia also finished first in the rankings, ahead of Italy, with five podiums (including) two gold medals in five competitions.\nIn men's sabre, Gu Bon-gil won the World Cup series for the second time in a row, followed by fellow South Korean Kim Jung-hwan and Hungary's Áron Szilágyi. In the women's, Russia's Sofiya Velikaya claimed her first end-of-the-season no.1 ranking after winning four World Cup gold medals and the European and World titles. Previous incumbent, Ukraine's Olha Kharlan, took gold medals in all three Grand Prix of the season and finished no.2 with a substantial lead over no.3 Mariel Zagunis of the United States. In men's team sabre, Italy placed first with three podiums, a continental medal and a world title. Russia and Germany finished respectively no.2 and no.3, separated by 2 points from each other. In the women's, Russia took the lead with three podiums and the continental and world titles, ahead of the United States and of Ukraine."

        "text": "The Armida Rowing Club (ARC) is one of the first Italian rowing clubs, founded in Turin in 1869.\nHistory.\nIn the late 19th century several sports clubs were established by the generic name of 'Canottieri' (Rowers) in the Valentino Park in Turin. In 1869 the Canottieri Armida was founded. The original members were a group of young people only inspired by the desire to have fun paddling on the river. This group of young people joined a company called Flik and Flok in 1863. Originally called Mek-Mek, the Canottieri Armida was formed through its merger with Flik and Flok in 1869.\nThe sports club took the name Armida on 25 February 1874 and a few months later - on 17 May 1874 - its first real social statute was approved. As a result of the strict rules imposed by it such as the prohibition of intemperance, the obligation of proper behaviour and correct ways of speaking, the duty of good conduct, the ban of gambling in addition to the self-discipline required for rowing and swimming competitively, the Armida Rowing Club was able to reach the top of the Italian rowing throughout its history. \nIn 1888 the Armida Rowing Club contributed with other rowing clubs to the establishment of the Italian Rowing Club, nowadays known as the Italian Rowing Federation.\nIn 1967 the Armida Rowing Club was awarded with the Golden Star for sporting merits by the Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI).\nThe Armida Rowing Club debuted in an official match in 1877. The achieved results were so disappointing that it was only in 1881 that the club returned to the competitions. The first major victory occurred in the fall of 1884: Gillardi won the first prize in the men's single scull race, Nicola in turn dominated the skiff race.\nIn 1889 the Armida Rowing Club introduced one of the best rowing boats designed for four persons at the time, the Savoia. Its crew consisted of the stroke Alessandro Rigat, Vittorio Nicola, Edoardo Bosio, Giuseppe Capellaro and the cox Andrea Marchisio. The Savoia's crew became the Italian champion on several occasions and also won the Queen's Cup for two consecutive years.\nIn 2006 the Armida Rowing Club resumed the ancient tradition of Venetian rowing, organizing courses and events in order to promote it.\nThe Armida Rowing Club hosts the well renowned regatta event Trofeo sull'Acqua, which takes place in the fishpond of the Palace of Venaria.\nThe venue.\nThe complex of social facilities of the Armida Rowing Club was always located in the Valentino Park. The venue offers a meeting place from which it is possible to enjoy peacefully one of the most suggestive sceneries of Turin since 140 years.\nThe main building, which was once the home of the \"Pavilion of French Colonies\" during the World Exhibition of 1911, is today supervised by the government department responsible for the environment and historical buildings."

        "title": "2015 Novak Djokovic tennis season",
        "text": "The 2015 Novak Djokovic tennis season is considered one of the greatest seasons of all time by an individual tennis player. Selected achievements/records from this season are: winning 3 Major titles, becoming only the third man to reach all four major finals in an Open Era season (after Rod Laver and Roger Federer), reigning as world number 1 for all 52 weeks of the year, winning a record 6 Masters 1000 tournaments, claiming the ATP World Tour Finals, reaching the final of 8 Masters 1000 tournaments, reaching a record 15 consecutive finals, a record 31 victories against players ranked in the top 10 at the time of the match and earning a record breaking amount of prize money. Djokovic had an impressive 15-4 record against the other 3 members of men's tennis's Big Four, including a 4-0 record versus Rafael Nadal, 5-3 against Roger Federer and 6-1 record against Andy Murray. Beyond that, he also finished the season with a 16-4 record against Top-5 players.\nAnalysis.\nIt is considered by many to be the greatest season in tennis history, as he was dominant at all Big Title events and statistically the season was unprecedented. It is often compared to Federer's 2006 season. It is considered one of Djokovic's two absolute best seasons, alongside his 2011 season.\nYear summary.\nGrand Slams.\nDjokovic reached the final of the 2015 Australian Open after beating Milos Raonic in the quarterfinals and defending champion Stan Wawrinka in the semifinals. He then defeated Andy Murray in the final, earning him a fifth Australian Open title, an Open Era record.\nAt the French Open, Djokovic reached the final by defeating arch-rival Rafael Nadal in the quarterfinals (becoming only the second man to beat Nadal at Roland Garros) and Andy Murray in the semifinals, but was defeated in the final by Stan Wawrinka to end a 28-match win streak and prevent Djokovic from completing the career Grand Slam.\nAt the 2015 Wimbledon Championships, he started his title defense by beating Philipp Kohlschreiber, Jarkko Nieminen, and Bernard Tomic in the first three rounds. In the fourth round, Djokovic dropped the first two sets before coming back to beat Kevin Anderson in five. He then went on to beat Marin Čilić and Richard Gasquet in straight sets to meet Roger Federer in the final, a repeat of last year's final. Djokovic would again prevail in 4 sets, giving him his 9th major and second major of the year, the first time he won multiple majors in a calendar year since 2011.\nAt the US Open, Djokovic reached the final by beating Feliciano López in the quarterfinals and soundly beating Marin Čilić in the semifinals, losing only three games in the entire match. In the final he trumped Roger Federer in a four setter to win the title. Djokovic knocked out the defending champion of every major other than Wimbledon, where he was reigning champion and knocked out 2014's runner up.\n2015 was the first time in Djokovic's career that he reached the final of all four grand slams and winning 3 out of 4, with the only loss coming at the French Open to Stan Wawrinka. He repeated the feat in 2021 and in 2023, reaching all 4 finals and winning 3, the only loss was at the US Open to Daniil Medvedev in 2021, and Wimbledon where he was beaten by Carlos Alcaraz in 2023.\nOther tournaments.\nDjokovic began the year with a warm-up tournament at the World Tennis Championship, but later withdrew from his final against Andy Murray. He then began his season in Doha, Qatar. Djokovic's next tournament was the 2015 Dubai Tennis Championships in late February where he reached the semifinals in 2014 losing to Roger Federer. Djokovic however lost to Federer 3–6, 5–7. He met Federer again in the final of the 2015 BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells and won in three sets. Djokovic then competed in the 2015 Miami Open and won the tournament for the fifth time after defeating Andy Murray in the final in three sets.\nIn the clay season, Djokovic competed in the 2015 Monte-Carlo Rolex Masters and won the tournament for the second time after defeating Marin Čilić in the quarterfinals, Rafael Nadal in the semi-finals, and Tomáš Berdych in the final, thus extending his winning streak to 17 matches. He also won his 23rd Masters title, tying Roger Federer. Djokovic withdrew from the Madrid Open to rest for the Italian Open and the French Open. After withdrawing from Madrid, Djokovic won his fourth Rome title at the 2015 Internazionali BNL d'Italia by defeating Roger Federer in the final in straight sets, thus extending his winning streak to 22 matches.\nIn the summer hard court season, Djokovic competed in both the 2015 Rogers Cup and the 2015 Western &amp; Southern Open where he reached the final in both tournaments. In the former, Djokovic lost to Andy Murray in three sets, ending his 8 match winning streak against Murray, while in the latter, Djokovic lost to Roger Federer in two sets, ending his 3 match winning streak against Federer, as well as ending his quest for a complete set of Masters 1000 titles. After the US Open, during the fall Asian swing, Djokovic won his sixth China Open title and his third Shanghai Masters title, winning all his matches in straight sets. After winning in Shanghai, Djokovic won his sixth masters title of the year at the 2015 BNP Paribas Masters defeating Andy Murray in the final for his sixth win of the season against Murray.\nDjokovic became the only player to beat each player from the top 10 in the 2015 tennis season.\nAll matches.\nThis table lists all the matches of Djokovic this year, including walkovers W/O (they are marked ND for non-decision)\nYearly records.\nHead-to-head matchups.\nNovak Djokovic has a record against the top 10, against the top 11–50, against other players; against right-handed players and against left-handed players.\n\"Ordered by number of wins\" ."

        "text": "David Simmons (born April 13, 1963) is an American former professional basketball player who played 13 seasons in the Australian National Basketball League (NBL). He was named an NBL All-Star and won an NBL championship with the Melbourne Tigers, who retired his No. 25. He also had a two-year coaching stint with the Hunter Pirates. Simmons is the father of National Basketball Association (NBA) player Ben Simmons.\nHigh school and college.\nA New York City native, Simmons attended South Bronx High School in The Bronx before playing college basketball in the state of Oklahoma. He first joined Oklahoma Baptist in 1981, but left after one season after struggling academically. He resurfaced at El Reno Junior College (now called Redlands) the next season and averaged 20 points a game, before returning to Oklahoma Baptist for the 1984–85 season.\nSimmons transferred to Oklahoma City in 1985 and sat out the season. He went on to average 12 points per game during the 1986–87 season.\nProfessional career.\nAfter graduating from Oklahoma City and moving around Central and South America for a short while, Simmons signed with the Melbourne Tigers of the Australian National Basketball League in 1989. He and fellow American Dave Colbert were fan favorites in Melbourne as they brought immediate success to a booming franchise. In his first NBL game, Simmons scored 28 points against the Hobart Devils. He backed this up with a 25-point, 15-rebound effort against the Eastside Melbourne Spectres the next night. He went on to score 30 or more points seven times in his debut season, including a 40-point performance against the Brisbane Bullets on August 20. To conclude a successful season, Simmons, Colbert and Australian basketball legend Andrew Gaze helped the Tigers reach the NBL post-season for the first time in club history. Simmons continued to play with the Tigers through the early 1990s, earning All-Star honors in his second season and helped the Tigers win the NBL championship in 1993.\nIn the spring of 1994, Simmons joined the Westchester Stallions of the United States Basketball League before returning to the Melbourne Tigers for the 1994 NBL season. Simmons was considered the ultimate team man as he adjusted his play to suit his role every season. However, following the conclusion of the 1996 season, the Tigers parted ways with Simmons as they wanted change with an import who could provide more offence than what they felt Simmons could give the team. Simmons subsequently joined the Newcastle Falcons in 1997 but managed just one season with the club. He joined the Sydney Kings a month into the 1998 season, but his stint did not last long, as he left the club after appearing in just six games.\nIn December 1998, Simmons returned to the Newcastle Falcons, signing with the club for the rest of the 1998–99 NBL season as a replacement for sacked import Todd Mundt. Following the conclusion of the NBL season, he joined the Rockhampton Rockets for the 1999 QBL season.\nIn September 1999, Simmons signed with the Canberra Cannons as a naturalized Australian to replace injured import Clayton Ritter. He played two seasons for the Cannons but finished his career on a sour note when he was released by the club with six games to go in the 2000–01 season due to off court issues that were not disclosed to the public.\nCoaching career.\nIn 2003, Simmons was hired by the Hunter Pirates as an assistant coach for the 2003–04 NBL season. However, in December 2003, he took over the head coaching job on an interim basis after the club controversially sacked Bruce Palmer just months into the Pirates' debut season. He returned to an assistant coaching role for the 2004–05 season after the club hired legendary Australian coach Dr. Adrian Hurley.\nPersonal life.\nSimmons is an African American who became a naturalized Australian citizen. He and his wife Julie, a white Australian, have two children: daughter Olivia and son Ben. He also has four step-children: Melissa, Emily, Liam and Sean; Emily is the wife of NFL player Michael Bush. His long-time friend, David Patrick, is the godfather of his son Ben. Patrick was an assistant coach at Louisiana State University (LSU) during Ben's lone season there. Ben Simmons was selected by the Philadelphia 76ers with the first overall pick in the 2016 NBA draft."

The runner-up in the 2013 and 2015 Tours, Quintana, had won three stage races in the lead up to the Tour, the Volta a Catalunya, the Tour de Romandie, and the Route du Sud. Contador, winner of the 2007 and 2009 Tours, found success in stage races during the season, winning the Tour of the Basque Country and placing second at Paris–Nice and the Volta a Catalunya.\nThe sprinters considered favourites for the points classification and wins on the flat or hilly bunch sprint finishes were Peter Sagan (), Marcel Kittel (), André Greipel (), Mark Cavendish (), Alexander Kristoff (), John Degenkolb () and Michael Matthews (). Sagan, the world road race champion and winner of the points classification in the four previous Tours, had won the one-day classics, Gent–Wevelgem and the Tour of Flanders, and two stages of the Tour of California during the season before the Tour. Kittel's 2016 season had been successful up to the Tour as he had amassed a total of nine wins from sprints, most notably, two stages of the Giro and the Scheldeprijs one-day race. He also won both the general and points classifications of the Dubai Tour. Greipel's season total of wins so far was eight, with three Giro stages. Cavendish's form was not clear as his season was mostly spent training for the omnium track event at the Olympic Games the month following the Tour. Although Kristoff's total of wins in the season was eight, they were not in major races. Degenkolb had spent the majority of his season recovering from an injury and it was thought he could pose a threat. Matthews only had two wins so far in the season, both at Paris–Nice, including the race's points classification.\nRoute and stages.\nOn 24 November 2014, ASO announced that for time the first time in Tour history the department of Manche would host the 2016 edition's opening stages (known as the \"Grand Départ\"), before further details of the first three stages held in Manche were released on 9 December 2014. On 15 January 2015, the organisers confirmed that the race would visit Andorra, for the fifth time in history; after the 1964, 1993, 1997 and 2009 editions. The principality hosted the finish of the ninth stage, the first rest day and start of stage ten. The entire route was unveiled by race director Christian Prudhomme on 20 October 2015 at the Palais des Congrès in Paris. The defending champion Chris Froome said after the route was announced that he expected the course to suit him better than the previous year's course. \"I think it's going to take a complete cyclist – but the stage that certainly stands out for me is Mont Ventoux\", he added.\nThe first stage started at the Mont Saint-Michel island monastery and finished north on at Utah Beach. The second stage was held between Saint-Lô and Cherbourg-en-Cotentin. The third stage left Manche in Granville and headed south to the finish in Angers. Stage four took the race further south, between Saumur and Limoges, with the fifth stage crossing the elevated region of Massif Central to the finish at the Le Lioran mountain resort. Stage six headed to Montauban before the entrance to the Pyrenees in stage seven. This mountain range also hosted two further stages: a roller-coaster stage eight and the finish in Andorra in stage nine. The following three stages, 10 to 12, crossed the south of the country eastwards to Mont Ventoux. After an individual time trial, stage 14 took the race northwards through the Rhône Valley, which was followed by a stage that took the race into the Jura Mountains. Stage 16 ended with a finish in Bern, Switzerland. The next four stages took place in and around the Alps, before a long transfer took the Tour to the finish with the Champs-Élysées stage in Paris.\nThere were 21 stages in the race, covering a total distance of , longer than the 2015 Tour. The longest mass-start was the fourth at , and stage 21 was the shortest at . The race featured a total of in individual time trials and four summit finishes: stage 9, to Andorra-Arcalis (Andorra); stage 12, to Chalet Reynard (Mont Ventoux); stage 17, to Finhaut–Émosson (Switzerland); and stage 19, to Saint Gervais-les-Bains. The highest point of elevation in the race was the -high Port d'Envalira mountain pass on stage ten. There were seven \"hors catégorie\" (English: beyond category) rated climbs in the race. There were sixteen new stage start or finish locations. The second rest day took place in Bern after stage 15.\nRace overview.\n\"Grand Départ\" and journey south.\nThe first stage's bunch sprint finish was won by Mark Cavendish, who gained the race leader's yellow jersey; he also claimed the green jersey as the leader of the points classification, with Paul Voss () taking the polka dot jersey as the leader of the mountains classification. Alberto Contador crashed and lost 55 seconds. Peter Sagan took victory in stage two with an uphill sprint in Cherbourg, putting him in the yellow and green jerseys. Jasper Stuyven of led the mountains classification. General classification rivals Contador and Richie Porte both lost time. The bunch sprint in Angers was won by Cavendish in a photo finish with André Greipel. Cavendish's win was his 28th in the Tour and drew him level with Bernard Hinault at second on the all-time list; Cavendish also took the green jersey. Another photo finish followed in the next stage with Marcel Kittel beating 's Bryan Coquard. Sagan claimed back the green and Thomas De Gendt () the polka dot. Greg Van Avermaet of won the fifth stage after he was the only rider to survive from an early breakaway. He took the lead of the general classification by over five minutes. Stage six was won by Cavendish, who beat Kittel and claimed the green jersey.\nPyrenees and transition.\nIn stage seven, the first in the Pyrenees, Steve Cummings () soloed over the final climb, the Col d'Aspin, and descended into the finish at Lac de Payolle where he took victory. Van Avermaet came fifth and extended his lead. 's Adam Yates attacked the chasing group and as he passed underneath the one kilometre to go arch it collapsed on top of, and injured, him. In the following stage Chris Froome attacked the front of the race of overall favourites as they passed the summit of the Col de Peyresourde, descending to the finish in Bagnères-de-Luchon to take a solo victory by thirteen seconds. This put him in the yellow jersey, sixteen seconds ahead of Yates in second, with Rafał Majka () taking the polka dot. In the Tour's queen stage, the ninth, Tom Dumoulin of broke clear of the large breakaway to claim the win at the Andorra-Arcalis. Thibaut Pinot took the lead of the mountains classification. Contador abandoned the race, citing a fever which had developed overnight. The next day was the first rest day of the Tour. Another breakaway succeeded in stage ten, with using their advantage of having three riders in the small group to give Michael Matthews the win. Sagan, who came second, took the lead in the points classification.\nOn stage eleven, Sagan forced a move in the final with his teammate Maciej Bodnar, who were followed by Froome and his teammate Geraint Thomas. They opened up a lead of over twenty seconds and held it to six seconds at the finish, where Sagan beat Froome in a sprint. A successful breakaway saw De Gendt win stage twelve at the finish at Chalet Reynard, which was changed from the intended summit finish at Mont Ventoux, later, due to dangerous winds. In the chasing group of overall favourites, a leading group of Porte, Froome and Bauke Mollema () crashed into the back of a camera motorbike that was stopped by the encroaching spectators. Froome's bike was unrideable and he was forced to run until he was given a bike from a neutral service car; although it did not fit him he managed to ride until he received his team bike. The race jury gave Froome and Porte the same time as Mollema, who later criticised the jury's decision, suggesting that they would have acted differently if he was the one to go down. De Gendt took the lead of the mountains classification. Stage thirteen's individual time trial was won by Dumoulin, 1:03 ahead of Froome, who extended his lead over his nearest rival (Mollema) to one minute and forty-seven seconds. Cavendish won his fourth stage the next day with a bunch sprint at the Parc des Oiseaux.\nAlps and finale.\n rider Jarlinson Pantano won stage fifteen after a sprint with fellow surviving breakaway rider Majka. In next stage, Sagan won his third stage from a select group of sprinters that had traversed a cobbled climb from the finish in Bern. The next day was the second rest day. In stage seventeen, as the race entered the Alps, 's Ilnur Zakarin attacked a breakaway and held off a chasing Pantano to take the win at the summit finish by the Émosson Dam. In the following stage's mountain time trial Froome beat second-placed Dumoulin by 21 seconds and extended his lead to three minutes and 52 seconds overall, with Mollema keeping second. In stage nineteen, the general classification leaders descended the wet roads of the unclassified penultimate climb at the head of the race, with only Costa surviving from the breakaway. Romain Bardet attacked after a series of crashes that included Froome and Mollema. Froome took Thomas's bike and got back to the group, but Mollema was left isolated and finished over four minutes behind the stage winner Bardet, who had passed Costa in the final and soloed to the finish at the Le Bettex ski station. Froome's lead was increased to 4' 11\", with Bardet moving up from fifth to second. In stage twenty Jon Izaguirre () took the win in Morzine, attacking on the wet descent from a three rider group that led over the final climb of Col de Joux Plane.\nThe final stage in Paris was won by Greipel, his second consecutive Champs-Élysées stage win. Froome finished the race to claim his third Tour de France, becoming the first man since Miguel Induráin in 1995 Tour to officially defend his title. He beat second-placed Bardet by four minutes and five seconds, with Nairo Quintana third, a further sixteen seconds down. Sagan won the points classification with a total of 470, 242 ahead of Greipel in second. Majka won the mountains classification with De Gendt and Pantano second and third respectively. The best young rider was Yates, two minutes and sixteen seconds ahead of second-placed Louis Meintjes (). finished as the winners of the team classification, over eight minutes ahead of second-placed . Of the 198 starters, 174 reached the finish of the last stage in Paris, beating the previous record high of 170 set in the 2010 Tour.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThere were four main individual classifications contested in the 2016 Tour de France, as well as a team competition. The most important was the general classification, which was calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage. Time bonuses (time subtracted) were awarded at the end of every stage apart from the two individual time trials. The first three riders got 10, 6 and 4 seconds, respectively. If a crash had happened within the final of a stage, not including time trials and summit finishes, the riders involved would have received the same time as the group they were in when the crash occurred. The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered the overall winner of the Tour. The rider leading the classification wore a yellow jersey.\nThe second classification was the points classification. Riders received points for finishing among the highest placed in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints during the stage. The points available for each stage finish were determined by the stage's type. The leader was identified by a green jersey.\nThe third classification was the mountains classification. Points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit of the most difficult climbs first. The climbs were categorised as fourth-, third-, second- or first-category and \"hors catégorie\", with the more difficult climbs rated lower. Double points were awarded on the summit finishes on stages 9, 12, 17 and 19. The leader wore a white jersey with red polka dots.\nThe final individual classification was the young rider classification. This was calculated the same way as the general classification, but the classification was restricted to riders who were born on or after 1 January 1991. The leader wore a white jersey.\nThe final classification was a team classification. This was calculated using the finishing times of the best three riders per team on each stage; the leading team was the team with the lowest cumulative time. The number of stage victories and placings per team determined the outcome of a tie. The riders in the team that lead this classification were identified with yellow number bibs on the back of their jerseys and yellow helmets.\nIn addition, there was a combativity award given after each stage to the rider considered, by a jury, to have \"made the greatest effort and who demonstrated the best qualities of sportsmanship\". No combativity awards were given for the time trials and the final stage. The winner wore a red number bib the following stage. At the conclusion of the Tour, Peter Sagan won the overall super-combativity award, again, decided by a jury.\nA total of €2,295,850 was awarded in cash prizes in the race. The overall winner of the general classification received €500,000, with the second and third placed riders getting €200,000 and €100,000 respectively. All finishers of the race were awarded with money. The holders of the classifications benefited on each stage they led; the final winners of the points and mountains were given €25,000, while the best young rider and most combative rider got €20,000. The team classification winners were given €50,000. €11,000 was given to the winners of each stage of the race, with smaller amounts given to places 2–20. There were also three special awards each with a prize of €5000. The Souvenir Jacques Goddet, given to the first rider to pass Goddet's memorial at the summit of the Col du Tourmalet on stage eight, the Souvenir Henri Desgrange, given to first rider to pass the summit of the highest climb in the Tour, the Port d'Envalira on stage ten, and the Prix Bernard Hinault, given to the rider with fastest ascent of the Côte de Domancy on stage eighteen. Thibaut Pinot won the Jacques Goddet, Rui Costa won the Henri Desgrange and Richie Porte won the Bernard Hinault.\nUCI rankings.\nRiders from the WorldTeams competing individually, as well as for their teams and nations, for points that contributed towards the World Tour rankings. Riders from both the WorldTeams and Professional Continental teams also competed individually and for their nations for points that contributed towards the new UCI World Ranking, which included all UCI road races. Points were awarded to the top twenty (World Tour) and sixty finishers (World Ranking) in the general classification and to the top five finishers in each stage. The points accrued by Chris Froome moved him up to third in the World Tour and second in the World Ranking. Peter Sagan held the lead of both rankings. 's strong showing put them in the lead of the World Tour team ranking, replacing . Spain and France remained the leaders of the WorldTour and World Ranking nation rankings, respectively."

        "text": "The 2014 International Premier Tennis League season (2014 IPTL season, officially the 2014 Coca-Cola International Premier Tennis League Presented by Qatar Airways season pursuant to sponsorship agreements with The Coca-Cola Company and Qatar Airways) is the inaugural season of the professional team tennis league contested by four teams in Asia.\nCompetition format.\nFour teams will compete for the IPTL Challenge Trophy and a US$1 million grand prize by earning the most points in the team standings. A team that wins a match tie is awarded four points. A team that loses a match tie but wins at least 20 games in the match earns two points. A team that loses a match tie but wins at least 10 games earns one point. Each team will play 12 matches: three at home, three on the road and six at neutral sites. Each match comprises five sets each of a different category as follows:\nThe order of play is decided by the coach of the home team. If two teams are playing at a neutral site, then a coin toss determines which coach chooses the order of play. The first serve in the first set is determined by a coin toss. The team that served last in the last game or tiebreaker of the previous set will receive during the next set.\nEach team can call a power point once in each set when receiving serve, and the next point played will count double. Effectively, a player trailing 15–0 can directly get to 15–30 by winning the power point.\nGames are played to four points using no-ad scoring. Each game won by a player or doubles team adds one point to the team's score in the match. The team with the most points at the end of the five sets wins the match. Each set is won when a team is the first to reach six games won. If the score is five-games-all, a timed five-minute shoot-out will be played. The player or doubles team leading at the end of five minutes wins the set.\nIf the team that wins the fifth set is leading the match, the match is over. If the score is tied after one team has won the fifth set, a timed seven-minute men's singles super shoot-out is played. The result counts as a game point won. If the team that wins the fifth set is trailing in the match, the match will go to sudden-death overtime effectively extending the fifth set. If the leading team wins one game in overtime, it wins the match tie. If the trailing team wins enough games in overtime to tie the score without losing a game, a timed seven-minute men's singles super shoot-out is played to decide the winner of the match tie. A coin toss decides who serves first in the super shoot-out.\nIn the event that two or more teams share the highest points on the final tally, the criteria to decide the champion are \nFounding of the league and charter franchises.\nMahesh Bhupathi announced the founding of the International Premier Tennis League on 25 May 2013, in Paris. The initial plan was to start the league with six charter franchises in Asia with the inaugural season commencing in November 2014.\nOn 21 January 2014, IPTL announced the locations of the six charter franchises for the league's inaugural season. Five franchises would play their home matches in Bangkok, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, Mumbai and Singapore. A sixth franchise would play its home matches in an undisclosed city in the Middle East. There was confusion surrounding the announcement. Some media outlets reported that there would be five franchises, not six as had been previously announced, and did not include the Hong Kong franchise among the five. Later news reports in February 2014, indicated that there would be five franchises including one based in Hong Kong but not one in the Middle East.\nIPTL conducted its inaugural player draft on 2 March. Right up until the day before the draft, the media remained under the impression that the Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur franchises would participate in the league and that the Middle East franchise was doubtful. However, only four teams participated in the draft: Bangkok, Mumbai, Singapore and Middle East now referred to as the Dubai franchise. No mention was made by IPTL of the Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur franchises which had abruptly disappeared.\nBy May, the Dubai franchise was being referred to as the UAE Falcons, the Mumbai franchise had been named the Indian Aces, and the Singapore franchise was being referred to as the Singapore Lions.\nOn 10 May, IPTL announced that the Bangkok franchise would be moved to Manila, Philippines due to political unrest in Thailand.\nOn 19 June, an IPTL press release revealed the owners of the four franchises to the general public. The owner of the Indian franchise, Micromax Informatics Ltd. proved to be the reason the team was no longer called the Mumbai franchise, because it preferred to have the team play its home matches in New Delhi. A group called PVP Ventures led by entrepreneur Prasad V Potluri () and cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar had been the original franchise owners with a plan to play home matches in Mumbai. While league managing director Bhupathi said PVP Ventures had been replaced by Micromax, because PVP missed a payment deadline, PVP said it had withdrawn from the league due to lack of clarity over how IPTL's business model was progressing and disagreements over player contracts. PVP did not want the team to be solely responsible for payment of player salaries and favored the league being obligated as well.\nBy June, the Manila franchise had been named the Manila Mavericks, the Falcons had become the UAE Royals and the Lions had become the Singapore Slammers.\nInaugural draft.\nFor the inaugural draft, each team was subject to a salary cap of US$10 million. Players who had expressed a willingness to participate were selected by the league and placed into categories. Teams could bid on these players with the player signing with the highest bidder in an auction-style format. Bids would be taken on 28 players in which the teams expressed interest in signing including players not categorized by IPTL. Each team participating in the draft was required to sign at least six players and could not sign more than ten.\nPlayers by category.\nPlayers were placed into the following categories:\nDraft results.\nFour charter franchises (Bangkok, Dubai, Indian Aces and Singapore) participated in the draft held in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, on 2 March 2014.\nResults table.\n\"References:\"\nStandings.\nStandings are determined by points with four points awarded for each match won, two points awarded for each match lost in which te team won 20 or more games and one point awarded for each match lost in which the team won between 10 and 19 games. In case of a tie in point, teams are placed by games won percentage.\nPosition summary.\nThe following table shows the day-by-day position of each team in the league standings.\nTelevision coverage.\nOn 22 August 2014, IPTL announced it had reached an agreement for the Middle East and North Africa television broadcasting rights with Abu Dhabi Media. On 16 October 2014, IPTL announced that STAR Sports would broadcast the league's matches live in both standard definition and high definition in India during its inaugural 2014 season. The league's matches will also be available live on STAR Sports's website. On 4 November 2014, Integrated Sports Media announced it had reached a deal with IPTL to televise every league match of the 2014 season on a pay-per-view basis in the United States. On 7 November 2014, IPTL announced it had reached agreements on television broadcast contracts with ABS-CBN in the Philippines and SingTel in Singapore. ABS-CBN will telecast the matches in the Philippines on the ABS-CBN Sports+Action and Balls channels.\nThe league also said there would be television coverage of its matches in the United Kingdom, France, the Czech Republic, Serbia, Southeast Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa and Brazil. In total, television coverage of IPTL matches will be available in more than 125 countries worldwide and reach over 300 million households.\nSponsorship.\nOn 3 November 2014, IPTL announced that The Coca-Cola Company had become the league's title sponsor.\nOn 26 November 2014, IPTL announced that Qatar Airways had become the league's presenting sponsor.\nResult.\nThe 1st season of IPTL was won by the Micromax Indian Aces with the runners-up being the Musafir.com UAE Royals."

        "text": "Alex Collins (August 26, 1994 – August 13, 2023) was an American professional football player who was a running back in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Arkansas Razorbacks and was selected by the Seattle Seahawks in the fifth round of the 2016 NFL Draft with the 171st overall pick. He spent two seasons with the Baltimore Ravens in 2017 and 2018 before re-signing by Seattle in 2020. He played one season with the Memphis Showboats of the United States Football League (USFL).\nEarly years.\nAlex Collins was born on August 26, 1994, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. He attended South Plantation High School in Fort Lauderdale where he was a letterman in football, basketball, lacrosse, and track. He was coached by Doug Gatewood. He was named Broward County Player of the Year as a junior after rushing for 1,786 yards and 28 touchdowns as the Paladins earned seven victories and qualified for the state playoffs. As a senior, he rushed for 1,400 yards and 14 touchdowns despite missing three games due to injury, helping South Plantation to nine wins, the district title and a berth in the 8A state playoffs. Following his senior season, he was selected to play in the Semper Fidelis All-American Bowl, where he was teammates with fellow Arkansas signee Austin Allen.\nAlso a talented sprinter, Collins ran the third leg on South Plantation's state-champion 4 × 100 m relay (41.98 s), leading to him being named the 2013 Broward County Male Athlete of the Year.\nCollins was ranked as a four-star recruit by Rivals.com and the 13th best running back in his class. Collins committed to play college football at the University of Arkansas in February 2013.\nOn signing day, Collins's mother provided some momentary drama, when she refused to sign the National Letter of Intent (LOI) for him to attend school at Arkansas, and then ran away with the LOI. She wanted Collins to stay close to home and attend the University of Miami. The drama ended the next day when Arkansas head coach Bret Bielema faxed another LOI to Collins, which was signed by his father.\nCollege career.\nCollins played for the University of Arkansas from 2013 to 2015. He started his career as the first true freshman in Southeastern Conference (SEC) history to rush for 300 yards in his first three games. Splitting time with Jonathan Williams, he finished the year with 1,026 rushing yards on 190 carries with four touchdowns. For his play he was named the 2013 SEC Freshman of the Year.\nIn his sophomore season in 2014, Collins ran for 1,100 yards and 12 touchdowns on 204 carries, while still splitting time with Williams. He also helped lead Arkansas to a Texas Bowl victory over the Texas Longhorns.\nWilliams went down with an injury before the 2015 season, so Collins became the featured back in Bret Bielema's offense. He started every game his junior year, and on November 7, 2015, with 108 yards against Ole Miss, Collins became only the third player in SEC history to rush for 1,000 plus yards in three seasons, joining Herschel Walker and Darren McFadden. Collins finished his junior season with a career-high 1,577 yards, and a school-record 20 rushing touchdowns. He was named second-team all-SEC, mostly because Alabama's Derrick Henry and LSU's Leonard Fournette outrushed him and were All-Americans. Collins led Arkansas to a Liberty Bowl victory over Kansas State on January 2, 2016. He finished the 45–23 victory with 185 yards and three rushing touchdowns, earning MVP honors.\nCollins is second on the Razorback career rushing yards list (3,703), behind only Darren McFadden (4,590).\nProfessional career.\nPre-draft.\nOn January 10, 2016, Collins penned an open letter to Arkansas fans announcing his intention to forgo his senior season and enter the 2016 NFL Draft. He was projected to be third round pick and was ranked the third best running back by CBSSports.com prior to the combine. He attended the NFL Combine and completed nearly all of the required drills, but chose to not perform the short shuttle or three-cone drill due to a headache. His combine performance was described as underwhelming and mediocre. On March 16, 2016, Collins opted to participate at Arkansas' pro day along with teammates Hunter Henry, Brandon Allen, Jonathan Williams, Denver Kirkland, Mitchell Loewen, Sebastian Tretola, and five others. He performed positional drills and added four inches to his vertical, finishing with a 32½. On April 12, 2016, it was reported that Collins had a pre-draft visit with representatives from the Miami Dolphins. At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, Collins was projected to be a third or fourth round pick by the majority of NFL draft experts and analysts. He was ranked the fifth best running back in the draft by \"Sports Illustrated\" and Pro Football Focus. Collins was also ranked the tenth best running back by NFLDraftScout.com.\nSeattle Seahawks (first stint).\n2016.\nThe Seattle Seahawks selected Collins in the fifth round (171st overall) of the 2016 NFL Draft. He was the 13th running back selected in the 2016 NFL Draft and one of three running backs the Seahawks drafted in 2016, along with C. J. Prosise (third round, 90th overall) and Zac Brooks (seventh round, 247th overall). His former teammate and backup at Arkansas, Jonathan Williams, was selected before him by the Buffalo Bills in the fifth round (156th overall). On May 6, 2016, Collins signed a four-year deal worth $2.2 million overall with a $184,000 bonus.\nUpon arriving at the Seahawks' training camp, Collins began competing with Thomas Rawls, Christine Michael, Prosise, Brooks, and Troymaine Pope for the role as the starting running back after it was left vacant by the retirement of Marshawn Lynch. Collins had an impressive training camp was given a chance to showcase his abilities after Rawls missed the starts of training camp while still recovering from injury and Prosise missed a stretch of camp with a hamstring injury. After a mediocre preseason, head coach Pete Carroll named Collins the fourth running back on the Seahawks' depth chart behind Michael, Rawls, and Prosise.\nHe made his professional regular season debut in the Seahawks' Week 2 matchup against the Los Angeles Rams, but had no gain on two carries in their 9–3 loss. The next week, Collins had 12 rushing yards on four carries and made the first two receptions of his career for 19 receiving yards in a 37–18 victory over the San Francisco 49ers. He caught his first career pass from Russell Wilson and gained nine-yards in the first quarter. On October 16, 2016, Collins had a nine-yard reception and one carry for a two-yard gain and the first touchdown of his career during Seattle's 26–24 defeat over the Atlanta Falcons. Collins finished his rookie season with 31 carries for 125 rushing yards and one rushing touchdown, in 11 games. He also caught 11 passes for 84 receiving yards. Collins also had eight carries for rushing 27 yards and three receptions for 28 receiving yards in two playoff games.\nAfter a 10–5–1 season, the Seahawks finished atop the NFC West and received a playoff berth. On January 7, 2017, Collins had six carries for 13 rushing yards and one 11-yard reception in the Seahawks' 26–6 victory over the Detroit Lions in the . They lost the following game to the Falcons by a score of 36–20 in the .\n2017.\nCollins competed with Rawls, Eddie Lacy, Chris Carson, Mike Davis, Prosise, and J. D.

He scored a touchdown against the Rams. Against the 49ers, he ran the ball for 29 yards on five carries, including a game-sealing eight-yard touchdown run with less than two minutes left. He was elevated again for the team's Wild Card Round game against the Rams, and reverted to the practice squad again following the game. His practice squad contract with the team expired after the season on January 18, 2021. \nCollins re-signed with the team on February 24, 2021.

        "text": "Chris Doyle (born June 30, 1968) is an American football coach and former player. He was the head strength and conditioning coach at the University of Iowa from 1999 until 2020. Doyle was hired by the Jacksonville Jaguars, but resigned a day later following public backlash about his controversial past at Iowa. Doyle played college football on the offensive line at Boston University from 1986 to 1988.\nBackground.\nRaised in Quincy, Massachusetts, Doyle attended Boston College High School, where he played football. Doyle attended college at Boston University, earning an Bachelor of Science in human movement and a Masters of Education.\nCoaching career.\nIowa Hawkeyes.\nDoyle served as strength and conditioning coach for Iowa Hawkeyes football from 1999 to 2020. He trained 180 student-athletes who have joined professional sports teams, as well as 19 former assistants who have become head strength and conditioning coaches.\nOn June 15, 2020, Iowa announced a separation agreement between the school and Doyle. Before the separation Doyle was the highest paid strength and conditioning coach in college football making $800,000. Under the agreement Doyle was paid 15 months salary which was over $1.1 million.\nDoyle was the Iowa football strength coach in 2011 when 13 players developed rhabdomyolysis following gruelling offseason workouts.\nJacksonville Jaguars.\nDoyle was hired to be the director of sport performance for the Jacksonville Jaguars on February 11, 2021. Due to backlash over his Iowa tenure, Doyle resigned his position from the Jaguars the following day.\nControversy.\nAccusations of racism and bullying.\nMultiple former Iowa players spoke out about racial disparities in the Iowa program and incidents where Doyle allegedly made racist comments and belittled players. He was subsequently placed on administrative leave.\nDuring the 2020 racial unrest in the United States after the murder of George Floyd by police, Black former Iowa football players called for changes within the program. Former Iowa offensive lineman James Daniels tweeted \"If the team collectively decides to kneel, this will bring about a cultural change for both Iowa football and the state of Iowa which I believe is long overdue!!!\" Two days later, Daniels followed up with a second tweet asserting “there are too many racial disparities in the Iowa football program. Black players have been treated unfairly for far too long.” Several other Iowa players added to Daniels' claims, citing Doyle and offensive coordinator Brian Ferentz as two of the leading causes of racial disparities in Iowa football. Former Iowa defensive lineman Jaleel Johnson wrote on Twitter \"Coach Doyle is the problem in that building. And so is Brian Ferentz... things won't progress until those two fix themselves. They know they're a problem.\""

        "text": "The 2017 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament involved 68 teams playing in a single-elimination tournament to determine the men's National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I college basketball national champion for the 2016–17 season. The 79th edition of the tournament began on March 14, 2017, and concluded with the championship game on April 3 at University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. The championship game was the first to be contested in the Western United States since the 1995 tournament when Seattle was the host of the Final Four.\nIn the Final Four, North Carolina beat Oregon (making their first Final Four appearance since the inaugural tournament in 1939) while Gonzaga defeated South Carolina (both making their first ever Final Four appearance). This was the first NCAA tournament since 1979 to see two first-time Final Four participants. North Carolina then defeated Gonzaga 71–65 to win their 6th national championship, and 3rd under Roy Williams.\nAfter being the only longstanding Power Five team to never made the tournament, Northwestern from the Big Ten finally made the tournament for the first time in program history. North Dakota (Big Sky), UC Davis (Big West), Northern Kentucky (Horizon League), and Jacksonville State (Ohio Valley) also all made their tournament debuts. \nTournament procedures.\nA total of 68 teams entered the 2017 tournament, with all 32 conference tournament winners receiving an automatic bid. The Ivy League, which previously granted its automatic tournament bid to its regular season champion, hosted a postseason tournament to determine a conference champion for the first time. In previous years, had the Ivy League had two schools tied for first in the standings, a one-game playoff (or series as was the case in the 2002 season) determined the automatic bid. On March 10, 2016, the Ivy League's council of presidents approved a four-team tournament where the top four teams in the regular season would play on March 11 and 12 at Philadelphia's Palestra.\nThe remaining 36 teams received \"at-large\" bids which are extended by the NCAA Selection Committee. On January 24, 2016, the NCAA announced that the Selection Committee would, for the first time, unveil in-season rankings of the top four teams in each division on February 11, 2017.\nEight teams—the four lowest-seeded automatic qualifiers and the four lowest-seeded at-large teams—played in the First Four (the successor to what had been known as \"play-in games\" through the 2010 tournament). The winners of these games advanced to the main draw of the tournament.\nThe Selection Committee also seeded the entire field from 1 to 68.\nThe committee's selections resulted in two historic milestones. The Northwestern Wildcats of the Big Ten Conference made their first-ever NCAA Tournament in school history, officially becoming the last \"power conference\" school to make the tournament. (This fact is ironic considering that Northwestern hosted the first-ever NCAA Tournament in 1939). The Wildcats' First round opponent, the Vanderbilt Commodores of the Southeastern Conference, also made history: with a record of 19–15, they set the mark for the most ever losses for an at-large team in tournament history.\nFour conference champions also made their first NCAA appearances: North Dakota (Big Sky Conference), UC Davis (Big West Conference), Jacksonville State (Ohio Valley Conference), and first-year Division I school Northern Kentucky (Horizon League).\nSchedule and venues.\nThe following sites were selected to host each round of the 2017 tournament\nFirst Four\nFirst and Second Rounds\nRegional semifinals and Finals (Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight)\nNational semifinals and championship (Final Four and championship)\nQualification and selection.\nEight teams, out of 351 in Division I, were ineligible to participate in the 2017 tournament due to failing to meet APR requirements, self-imposed postseason bans, or reclassification from a lower division. Hawaii had previously been banned from entering the tournament as a penalty for infractions, but the NCAA later reversed its ban.\nAutomatic qualifiers.\nThe following 32 teams were automatic qualifiers for the 2017 NCAA field by virtue of winning their conference's automatic bid.\nBracket.\nAll times are listed as Eastern Daylight Time ()\nFirst Four – Dayton, Ohio.\nThe First Four games involved eight teams: the four overall lowest-ranked teams, and the four lowest-ranked at-large teams.\nFinal Four.\nDuring the Final Four round, regardless of the seeds of the participating teams, the champion of the top overall top seed's region (Villanova's East Region) plays against the champion of the fourth-ranked top seed's region (Gonzaga's West Region), and the champion of the second overall top seed's region (Kansas's Midwest Region) plays against the champion of the third-ranked top seed's region (North Carolina's South Region).\nGame summaries and tournament notes.\nUpsets.\nPer the NCAA, \"Upsets are defined as when the winner of the game was seeded five or more places lower than the team it defeated.\" The 2017 tournament saw a total of 9 upsets; 4 of them were in the first round, 4 of them were in the second round, and one of them in the Sweet Sixteen.\nMedia coverage.\nTelevision.\nCBS Sports and Turner Sports held joint U.S. television broadcast rights to the Tournament under the \"NCAA March Madness\" brand. As part of a cycle beginning in 2016, CBS held rights to the Final Four and championship game. As CBS did not want its audience to be diffused across multiple outlets, there were no localized \"Team Stream\" telecasts of the Final Four or championship games on Turner channels as in previous years.\nFollowing criticism of the two-hour format of the 2016 edition, the Selection Sunday broadcast was shortened to 90 minutes. CBS Sports executive Harold Bryant promised that the unveiling of the bracket would be conducted in an \"efficient\" manner, and leave more time to discuss and preview the tournament.\nRadio.\nWestwood One had exclusive radio rights to the entire tournament. For the first time in the history of the tournament, broadcasts of the Final Four and championship game were available in Spanish.\nInternet.\nVideo.\nLive video of games was available for streaming through the following means:\nAudio.\nLive audio of games was available for streaming through the following means:"

The game was introduced in Dhaka around 1905 under the patronage of Nawab Sir Khwaja Salimullah (1866–1915). But the game remained confined to the Nawabs’ family circle. At that time, football was more popular among the masses of this region. Despite this, the game made great progress due to untiring efforts of some sports patrons and organizers. During the World War II, a team of the hockey wizard Dhyan Chand, a member of the Gurkha Regiment, played an exhibition match at Armanitola in Dhaka.\nWith the Partition of Bengal in 1947, the growth of hockey was impeded. Many of the people, who played and loved hockey, migrated to India. As a result, hockey turned into a seasonal game. Hockey was played only for two or three months in the year also due to the inadequacy of playgrounds and unfavorable weather conditions in other months of the year.\nDuring the Pakistan period, the East Pakistan hockey team took part in a number of tournaments including All Pakistan National Hockey Championship. In 1969, Dhaka successfully hosted the final round of the Pakistan National Hockey Championship.\n20th century.\nThe 'Bangladesh Hockey Federation (BHF)' was founded in 1972. The federation acquired full membership of the International Hockey Federation and of the Asian Hockey Federation in 1975. In 1987, a hockey stadium was built in Dhaka, which is now known as the Maulana Bhasani Hockey Stadium. Since then it has been the home of hockey and the office of BHF in Bangladesh where all levels of hockey are being played and controlled. The Federation regularly arranges hockey leagues, tournaments, and the National Youth and Senior Championships. At the home level, hockey matches including Premier Division Hockey League, First Division Hockey League, Second Division Hockey League, National Hockey League, National Youth Hockey League, Independence Day Hockey Tournament, National Hockey Championship, National Youth Hockey Championship, Victory Day Hockey Tournament, School Tournaments and hosted various international tournaments with distinction.\nBangladesh started taking part in international hockey tournaments by participating in the 1st Junior World Cup for Asia/Oceania zone qualifying round in Kuala Lumpur in 1977.

The archer scoring highest total from her 144 arrows received the number one seed, the archer with the second highest total receiving second seed, and so on. In the event of a tie between two or more archers, the number of arrows shot in the central 10-ring of the target was taken into account, with the number of arrows shot within the inner-10 (or X) ring used as a second tiebreaker if necessary .A maximum of two archers from each nation were allowed progress to the elimination rounds.\nThe format of the elimination and medal-deciding rounds followed the Archery Olympic Round set system used in international competitions since 2010. Each match consisted of a maximum of five sets, with archers each shooting three arrows per set at the same 122-cm wide targets from a fixed distance of 70 metres. The archer with the greater score from their three arrows won the set, earning two set points. The archer with the lower score in each set received zero points. If the score was tied, each archer received one point. The first archer to reach six set points was declared the winner. If the match was tied at five set points each after the maximum five sets were played, a single tie-breaker arrow was used with the closest to centre of the target winning.\nAfter securing every gold medal available in the archery competition at the 2006 and 2010 Asian Games, the Korean national team aimed to defend each of their five recurve titles for the second time in succession. Chang Hye-jin, Jung Dasomi, Joo Hyun-jung, and Lee Tuk-young were chosen to compete in the women's events after finishing in the top four positions in the Korean national team selection held earlier in 2014, beating both the reigning Olympic champion Ki Bo-bae and the defending Asian Games champion Yun Ok-hee to represent their nation.\nThe semi-finals commenced on the afternoon of 28 September following the conclusion of the team recurve events, in which Chang, Jung, and Lee emerged victorious over the Chinese trio of Cheng, Xu, and Zhu to take the gold medal.\nThe medal matches took place after the semi-finals. As the two losing archers from the semi-finals, Xu faced Hayakawa in the bronze medal match. Xu emerged the winner, posting three successive set victories to come from two set points down to defeat the Japanese archer. The all-Korean gold medal match followed afterwards and saw Jung comprehensively defeat Chang with a consistency that Chang struggled to match. Although Chang was able to tie the second set, Jung missed the central 10 ring just twice in her twelve shots, earning a standing ovation from the home crowd with a perfect score of 30 in the fourth and final set to claim her second Asian Games gold medal of the day."

        "text": "The 2016 World Cup of Hockey (abbreviated WCH2016) was an international ice hockey tournament. It was the third installment of the National Hockey League (NHL)-sanctioned competition, 12 years after the second World Cup of Hockey in 2004. It was held from September 17 to September 29 at Air Canada Centre in Toronto, Ontario. Canada won the championship, defeating Team Europe in the best-of-three final.\nTeams.\nThe teams were officially announced on September 10, 2015, by the International Ice Hockey Federation. The teams were:\nNational anthems.\nThe national anthem for each team playing was played before the start of each game. However, there were two exceptions: no anthem was played for Team Europe because of the team's multiple national representatives, while both \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" and \"O Canada\" were played before games Team North America played. Team Europe players wore badges with their respective nations' flags on their jerseys.\nRosters.\nEach team's roster was limited to twenty skaters (forwards and defencemen) and three goaltenders. All eight participating teams submitted their initial roster of sixteen players on March 2, 2016.\nJerseys.\nEach one of the national teams' players wore a customized jersey manufactured by Adidas.\nVenue.\nIn contrast to previous World Cups, all contests in the 2016 World Cup were held at the same site.\nPre-tournament venues.\nThe following venues were used across North America and Europe in the pre-tournament schedule\nPre-tournament games.\nAll games are Eastern Daylight Time ().\nStart date: September 8, 2016.\nSource: National Hockey League\nGroup stage.\nAll games are Eastern Daylight Time ().\nKnockout stage.\nAll times are local, Eastern Daylight Time ().\nFinal.\nThe final was played in a best-of-three format.\nRanking and statistics.\nScoring leaders.\nList depicts skaters sorted by points, then goals.\nLeading goaltenders.\nOnly goaltenders who played greater than or equal to one-third of the team's minutes are included.\nBroadcasting.\nIn Canada, Rogers Communications held broadcast rights to the tournament; the tournament was aired by Sportsnet in English and TVA Sports in French. Similarly to its sub-licensing agreement for \"Hockey Night in Canada\", the semi-finals and finals were simulcast by CBC Television. Although it was initially reported that Rogers was allowed to match competing bids for the rights (such as by Bell Media and ESPN's TSN) per its holding of exclusive national media rights to the NHL in Canada, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman denied that there was such a rule, and that the bidding process was \"competitive\".\nIn the United States, the tournament was broadcast by ESPN and ESPN Deportes in English and Spanish, respectively; NBC Sports, the national rightsholder of the NHL in the United States, passed on the tournament due to scheduling conflicts with various events being broadcast by its networks in that period of time.\nESPN also broadcast the tournament for the Spanish-speaking Latin American countries, the Commonwealth Caribbean, the Pacific Rim and Brazil. In Russia, the tournament was broadcast by Channel One and Match TV. In Finland, the tournament was broadcast by Viasat Sport and Nelonen. In Sweden, Denmark and Norway, the tournament was broadcast by Viasat Sport. In the Czech Republic, the tournament and exhibition games were broadcast by public channel ČT Sport and in Slovakia by Markíza. In Germany, the tournament was broadcast by Sport 1. In Poland, the tournament was broadcast by public channel TVP Sport.\nThe broadcasts incorporated the use of technology by British firm Supponor to allow for the digital replacement of advertising on the rink boards on selected camera shots. These allowed a single advertiser at a time to brand the entire board, localization of advertising in different media markets, and other customized graphics to be substituted onto the boards. Advertisements are replaced when cameras shots are switched to minimize distractions.\nOfficials.\nThe NHL selected seven of their referees and seven linesmen to officiate the tournament."

It was the second time that the two teams faced each other in the competition's decisive match, having previously met in the 1998 final. Real Madrid, the defending champions, beat Juventus 4–1 to win a record-extending 12th title. With this victory, Real Madrid became the first team to successfully defend their title in the Champions League era, and the first to successfully defend a European Cup since Milan in 1990.\nAs winners, Real Madrid qualified as the UEFA representative for the 2017 FIFA Club World Cup in the United Arab Emirates, and also earned the right to play against the winners of the 2016–17 UEFA Europa League, Manchester United, in the 2017 UEFA Super Cup, ultimately triumphing in both competitions.\nAssociation team allocation.\nA total of 78 teams from 53 of the 55 UEFA member associations were expected to participate in the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League (the exceptions being Liechtenstein, which did not organise a domestic league, and Kosovo, whose participation was not accepted in their first attempt as UEFA members).

        "title": "List of Negro league baseball champions",
        "text": "This List of Negro league baseball champions includes champions of black baseball prior to the organization of any traditional Negro league and goes through to the collapse of segregated baseball after Jackie Robinson broke the baseball color line in 1946. Champions include self-declared, regional and (later) league champions, but is limited to top-tier teams and major Negro leagues. The champions listed after 1948 through the 1950s are listed for posterity, but the quality of play had deteriorated so far as to only incidentally be covered by contemporary media or historians.\n1867–1891: Era of amateur and semi-pro teams.\nDuring the formative years of black baseball, most Negro teams toured the US playing white or mixed-race teams of an amateur or semi-pro standing. There was little to no collaboration between black teams, and few if any scheduled meetings. Therefore, during this era, it was usually up to an individual team (or newspaper writer) to declare themselves the black champion and see if anyone challenged them.\n1892–1894: First crisis for organized black teams.\nThere were no championships claimed during this period.\nBeginning around 1890, political and economic turmoil—eventually leading to the Panic of 1893—took a toll on the bottom line of each Negro team. Every significant Negro team, except for two, ceased operations entirely. Only one team, the Chicago Unions, managed to survive the crisis intact; while the Cuban Giants suspended play at the end of 1891 but reformed for the 1893 season.\n1895–1919: Era of independent barnstorming teams.\nSegregated baseball leagues, both black and white, started to appear around this time. Starting in 1887, the International League began prohibiting the signing of black players. By 1890, the last of the \"white\" leagues (the American Association and the National League) had unofficially banned blacks, and the color line was drawn. Early on, due to social and lingering fiscal reasons, there was minimal interest and press coverage regarding black teams, so champions were not easily determined. After the economic crisis had subsided around 1897, black teams began actively competing against other black teams for local or regional championships.\nThe championships during this period were informal as the post-season challenges were issued by the individual teams.\na,b — The X-Giants initially played the Unions for the championship; during the series, Columbia stepped up and issued challenges to the Unions for the Western championship and the X-Giants for the Colored championship.\n1920–1931: First endeavor of organized league play.\nWith the emergence of the hard-fisted leadership of former pitcher Rube Foster, playing a formal scheduled season between other black teams became reality. Foster, known for his business acumen, recognized that attendance was just high enough so that a reasonable profit can be derived from gate receipts to sustain the travel and commitment required to maintain a league schedule. This led to the formation of a handful of official Negro leagues, and later to a planned end-of-season World Series.\nBeginning in 1924, the championships during this period were formal, pre-arranged post-season challenges agreed to by the respective leagues. The 1922 championship was an informal post-season challenge issued by the individual teams.\n1932–1935: Second crisis and rebuilding.\nSeveral factors led to the collapse of league play beginning with the 1928 break up of Eastern Colored League and then the 1929 folding of the American Negro League. These leagues were constantly warring with the Negro National League regarding player raiding and contract disputes; this led to an instability that was incompatible with the weakening economy. That October saw the 1929 stock market crash, known as Black Tuesday, which was a sign of things to come. In 1930, the NNL collapsed (largely due to the death of Rube Foster) but the individual teams continued to play. The NNL regrouped for 1931, but again collapsed—this time for good and the teams were on their own. By 1932, the Great Depression had taken a severe toll on the entire country. Only a few organized Negro leagues survived and all of those were either a minor or semi-pro league. The Negro Southern League was considered the highest quality surviving league and many players (and two teams) migrated to it; it therefore became the \"de facto\" major league for the 1932 season.\nAfter the worst of the depression had passed, teams were again able to profit from playing a league schedule. At first, only a few team owners were able to put together enough investors to join a league; therefore, for the first time in black baseball, one league spanned both the eastern and western regions of the US. A new Negro National League was formed with both east and west teams.\n1936–1948: Negro league glory years.\nNegro league baseball hit its stride after the country had recovered from the devastation of the Great Depression. The second incarnation of the Negro National League became the \"eastern\" league and a year later the new Negro American League assumed the role of the \"western\" league. Both leagues generally respected the players' contracts and a relative peace existed between the leagues. An agreed upon championship series was held at the end of the season between each league's pennant winner. Only integration could challenge their success, and it came in 1946. By 1949, the NNL broke up and the NAL was the only league in operation.\nPost-1948: Integration and inevitable extinction.\nBy 1949, enough black talent had integrated into the white leagues (both major and minor) that the Negro leagues themselves had become a minor league circuit. With the demise of the NNL, only the NAL remained as a top-tier league for black players. If the purpose of the Negro leagues was to end segregation, then in 1947 (with Jackie Robinson's MLB debut) they became a success and their mission was complete. With an infrastructure still in place and a viable audience for a short period of time, there was still money to be made for a few more years before total demise. Therefore, the following teams are listed for posterity; the real black championship contest was now considered to be the annual East–West Game.\nRegional and league championships by club.\nBelow are the regional and league championships by club. During the formative years until about 1891, it was usually up to an individual team (or newspaper writer) to declare themselves the black champion and see if anyone challenged them; these are listed in the chart as \"Declared\" champions. Later, up until the end of the Great Depression, there were periods when press coverage and fan interest waned to the point that some seasons a champion was not determined; in these years a champion was retroactively determined by historical research as to which team probably had the most successful season and these are listed in the chart as \"Unofficial\" champions. Where a champion was determined via a traditional play-off, it is listed in the chart as an \"Earned\" champion. Only the seasons prior to integration are considered for this table; teams who continued after 1948 are represented by a \"+\".\nEast–West All-Star game.\nMajor League Baseball began the tradition of an \"All-Star\" exhibition game between the stars of the American League and National League in 1933. Encouraged by the success of the white game, Gus Greenlee organized a black All-Star game at the end of the 1933 season. This game was to feature the top talent from the western region against the top eastern region talent, hence the name \"East–West Game\". In the years a World Series was not held, the East–West Game was a surrogate championship game – replete with the media hype and sold-out attendance."

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball single-game hits leaders",
        "text": "In baseball, a hit is credited to a batter when he reaches first base – or any subsequent base – safely after hitting a fair ball, without the benefit of an error or a fielder's choice. One hundred eighteen different players have recorded at least six hits in a single nine-inning Major League Baseball game, the most recent being Luis García of the Washington Nationals on May 26, 2023. Five players have accomplished the feat more than once in their career; no player has ever recorded more than seven hits in a nine-inning game. Davy Force was the first player to collect six hits in a single game, doing so for the Philadelphia Athletics against the Chicago White Stockings on June 27, 1876.\nThese games have resulted in other single-game MLB records being set in connection with the prodigious offensive performance. Shawn Green, for example, established a new major league record with 19 total bases and finished with a total of five extra-base hits, tying a National League record that was also achieved by Larry Twitchell during the latter's six-hit game. Four of Green's six hits were home runs, equaling the record for most home runs in one game. Jim Bottomley, Walker Cooper, Anthony Rendon, and Wilbert Robinson hit 10 or more runs batted in (RBI) to complement their six hits. Robinson proceeded to collect a seventh hit and an eleventh RBI to set single-game records in both categories. Although his record of 11 RBIs has since been broken, Robinson's seven hits in a nine-inning game has been matched only by Rennie Stennett.\nGuy Hecker, the only pitcher to have accomplished the feat, also broke the single-game major league record for runs scored with seven. Cal McVey is the sole player to collect six hits in each of two consecutive games. Seven players hit for the cycle during their six-hit game. Zaza Harvey has the fewest career hits among players who have six hits in one game with 86, while Ty Cobb – with 4,189 – had more hits than any other player in this group and amassed the second most in major league history. Cobb, Cal Ripken Jr., and Paul Waner are also members of the 3,000 hit club.\nOf the 75 players eligible for the Baseball Hall of Fame who have recorded six hits in a nine-inning game, eighteen have been elected, three on the first ballot. Players are eligible for the Hall of Fame if they have played in at least 10 MLB seasons, and have either been retired for five seasons or deceased for at least six months. These requirements leave six players ineligible who are active, six players ineligible who are living and have played in the past five seasons, and twenty-six players ineligible who did not play in 10 seasons.\nPlayers.\nSix hits in extra-inning games.\n, 47 different players have recorded at least six hits in an extra-inning Major League Baseball (MLB) game. Only Jimmie Foxx has accomplished the feat more than once in his career and no player has ever amassed more than nine hits in a game, with Johnny Burnett holding that distinction. Kirby Puckett is the only player to collect six hits in both a nine-inning and an extra-inning game.\nThe following list is kept separate from the above list of players who have six or more hits in a nine-inning game. This is due to the differing number of innings played during an extra-inning game, the lack of a definitive endpoint to the game that would otherwise allow for a fair comparison to be made, and the advantage of having more opportunities at bat during an extra-inning game as opposed to one lasting nine innings.\nReferences.\nGeneral\nSpecific"

        "title": "Scottish Rugby Academy",
        "text": "The Scottish Rugby Academy, for sponsorship reasons the Fosroc Scottish Rugby Academy, is a national academy structure designed to give Scotland's young rugby stars a pathway into the professional game.\nThe academy structure is based on 4 regional academies geographically based on the traditional districts of Glasgow District. Edinburgh District, North and Midlands and South.\nBackground.\nThe regional academies were launched at the University of Aberdeen’s Hillhead campus on 1 October 2014 at the flagship academy in Caledonia, which is a combination of North and Midlands regions.\nThe Academies are open to the best talent, male and female, from the age of 14 onwards. The initial focus will be on players within the 16, 18 and 20-year-old age-groups and the top tier of the academy, stage three, will replace the current Elite Development Player strand within the pro-clubs.\nThey will also seek to develop the next tranche of coaches and seek to better bridge the gap between the club and professional game.\nAcademy Development Stages.\nSupported stages.\nStage 1 and 2 are known as the supported stages. They are often combined in the listing of annual intakes.\nStage 1 - Early Talent Identification.\nRegionally selected and regionally supported players\nUnder 14 and Under 15 players invited to attend regional skills camps and local pathway sessions/matches as an initial Academy selection process.\nStage 2 - Player Membership Terms.\nNationally selected and regionally supported players\nSelected as having the potential to play professional rugby or influence the future success of Scotland Women's rugby. Players will be managed by Scottish Rugby through the Academy Membership Terms and supported regionally within the academy structure.\nContracted stage.\nThese players are given a professional contract by the Scottish Rugby Academy. Although given placements at professional clubs, they are not contracted by Glasgow Warriors or Edinburgh etc. Players graduate from the academy when a professional club contract is offered.\nStage 3 - Player Contract.\nNationally selected and regionally supported players\nPlayers selected by Scottish Rugby and supported through the academy based on Academy Membership Terms but who are also separately contracted by the Scottish Rugby Union and aligned to a professional club and supported regionally within the academy structure.\nRegional Academies.\nCaledonia.\nThe Caledonia Academy was the first of the four academies built in Scotland, a year before the others arrived in 2015. Originally Bruce Frame was announced as manager of the Caledonia Academy. He has since been joined with other coaches. Both Aberdeen University and the Aberdeen Sports Village offer their facilities to the rugby union students.\nEdinburgh.\nFormer Scotland international scrum-half Graeme Beveridge was announced as manager of the Edinburgh Academy.\nThe facilities include a number of exercise physiology labs, one featuring an environment chamber that simulates altitude, humidity, and hot and cold conditions.\nAn extension will be built to the university's current performance gym, which will include a 20-metre running track and physio area, as well as free weights and cardio machines.\nGlasgow and the West.\nAlong with the announcement of Bruce Frame, Jamie Dempsey was initially appointed Manager of the Glasgow and West Academy. After leaving the Scotland women's national rugby union team on 2019, Shade Munro is now the Lead Coach of the Glasgow Academy.\nWork went underway to create a new purpose-built facility, on-site at Broadwood Stadium, Cumbernauld, with fitness and medical equipment, all part of Scottish Rugby's major policy initiative to develop a regional Academy system.\nThe Glasgow and West Academy has relocated to the Ravenscraig Regional Sports Facility in Motherwell for season 2019–20.\nBorders and East Lothian.\nThe Borders and East Lothian Academy will operate from the Netherdale Campus, in Galashiels.\nThis is the fourth and final facility to be announced and has been made possible through a partnership with Heriot-Watt University, Borders College, Gala Junior Rugby Council and the Borders Sport and Leisure Trust.\nChris Dewsnap, the Borders and East Lothian Academy Manager, and his staff will have access to gym facilities at TriFitness and the 3G pitch at Fairydean, while Heriot-Watt will provide office, rehab and medical space, with Hayward Pavilion hosting changing and on-field medical facilities. Borders College will provide access to the gym and will offer additional office space.\nCompetition.\nThe academy teams compete in the U-20 Championship, U-18 Championship and U-16 Championship.\nSponsorship.\nOriginally sponsored as the BT Scottish Rugby Academy for the first three seasons, the academy was sponsored by Fosroc in season 2018–19."

        "text": "Teddy Thomas (born 18 September 1993) is a French international rugby union player who plays on the wing for La Rochelle in the Top 14.\nEarly life.\nThomas was raised by his French mother. His father was from Mali, played professional football in France, but disappeared before Thomas' birth. Thomas chose to use his middle name as his surname. Thomas was encouraged to play rugby by his grandfather and uncle.\nCareer.\nClub.\nThomas began his professional rugby career in 2012 playing for Biarritz Olympique during the 2012–13 Top 14 season. He made his French Top 14 debut against Toulon on 9 March 2013, coming off the bench during the final 10 minutes of the 50–15 thrashing. He went on to play a further four matches that season, earning his first start against Grenoble on 29 March 2013. He scored four tries in his debut professional season, picking up a double against Perpignan and Stade Français, while also making a break in the dying minutes of the Stade Français, to set up a try for Takudzwa Ngwenya. During that season, he also made his European debut in the 2012–13 Heineken Cup - though he made his debut against Gloucester in the 2012–13 European Challenge Cup after Biarritz dropped down from the leading tier. He scored two tries on his European debut, causing all sorts of problems for his opposite defender Charlie Sharples. In his second year with Biarritz, he appeared 20 times, only acting as a substitute just once that season. His team failed to impress on the European stage, finishing second in its pool in the 2013–14 European Challenge Cup, while in the French League, finishing last in the table with just five wins. By virtue of finishing last, Biarritz were relegated and Thomas was released from his contract. On 6 June 2014, Racing Métro announced the signing of the promising winger for the 2014–15 Top 14 season. He made his debut in Round 2 of the season, starting in the 30–21 loss to Bordeaux Bègles, and scoring a try on his Racing Métro debut.\nNational team.\nThomas has played for France through age grade level and senior level. He was part of the France U18s side that participated in the 2011 European Under-18 Rugby Union Championship in France, finishing fourth behind Ireland, England and Wales. He also played for the France U20s team during the 2013 Six Nations Under 20s Championship - finishing fifth with two wins, and played in the 2013 IRB Junior World Championship in France. Though at home, the French U20s team finished third in their pool, and set up a quarter-final against Ireland U20s, winning 9–8. They challenged Argentina U20s in the 5th place game, in which Thomas scored two tries to help France secure a 37–34 win and an overall 5th place.\nHis form and try scoring ability earned him a call-up to the France national team by Philippe Saint-André for their 2014 November test series against Fiji, Australia and Argentina. He made his debut against Fiji, starting on the left wing, and scoring within the first minute of the match. He then went on to score a further two tries, which came just 2 minutes apart from each other. Although injured in the first game of the 2015 Six Nations he did receive a KS winners medal."

        "title": "2014 Hiram vs. Mount St. Joseph women's basketball game",
        "text": "The 2014 Hiram vs. Mount St. Joseph women's basketball game, billed as Play for 22, was the first game of the 2014–15 NCAA basketball regular season. The Division III game between Hiram College and Mount St. Joseph University (MSJ) was originally intended to be played at the Hiram campus in Hiram, Ohio, on November 15, 2014. However, the game was moved to November 2 to accommodate Lauren Hill, a Mount St. Joseph freshman who had been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and wished to play in one college game before her death. The game was also moved to Cincinnati, initially to the MSJ campus in nearby Delhi Township and ultimately to Cintas Center on the campus of Xavier University.\nBackground.\nLauren Hill.\nLauren Hill (October 1, 1995April 10, 2015) had been a star basketball player at Lawrenceburg High School in Lawrenceburg, Indiana, located about west of Cincinnati. On her 18th birthday in 2013, she committed to play at Mount St. Joseph. However, as she was preparing for her senior season at Lawrenceburg High, she was noticing problems with her game. As she would tell a reporter from WKRC-TV in Cincinnati in late 2014, \"I wasn't keeping up with the other girls. My ball handling was sloppy so I just figured I was out of shape.\" After further problems in the following weeks, she thought that she had suffered a concussion, and her family took her to Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. On November 20, 2013, less than two months after committing to MSJ, she was diagnosed with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), a rare type of brain cancer that normally affects children age 5 to 7. The cancer, which grows from the brain stem, is inoperable and is not considered survivable.\nInitially, Hill was given a best-case prognosis of two years to live. Her father recalled that immediately after the diagnosis, \"I got weak, [Lauren's mother] Lisa got sick, and typical Lauren she wanted to know if she could still play basketball.\" She indeed continued to play in her senior season at Lawrenceburg High despite undergoing regular chemotherapy and radiation treatments, and as scheduled came to MSJ for the 2014–15 season. In September 2014, she had an MRI that revealed that the tumor had grown; at that time, doctors told her and her family that she would probably die before the end of the year. Shortly after this diagnosis, she told new MSJ head coach Dan Benjamin, \"One game. I want to play one college game.\" She also chose to spend her last months as an advocate for DIPG research, which had made little progress at the time.\nOn April 10, 2015, Hill died at the age of 19.\nBuildup.\nAfter this news, the MSJ athletic department approached its counterpart at Hiram. The two teams had initially planned to open their respective seasons on November 15 at Hiram's Price Gymnsaium, but Hiram agreed to move the game to November 1 at MSJ if the NCAA would give permission. This was needed because under NCAA rules, Division III schools cannot play regular-season games before November 15. The NCAA ultimately granted the schools a waiver to play on November 2.\nThe game was then scheduled to be held at the Mount St. Joseph campus. The school's arena, Harrington Center, has a capacity of 2,000, and the typical attendance for a women's basketball game is about 100. However, as news spread of Hill's story, the demand for tickets and media credentials was too great for MSJ to accommodate. At that time, Xavier University stepped in, offering MSJ free use of its arena, Cintas Center, with arena employees volunteering their time for the game. Even with the move to the 10,250-seat venue, the game sold out in 30 minutes. The interest in the game also led Fox Sports Ohio to televise it live.\nThe game would soon be billed as \"Play for 22\", after Hill's jersey number. The schools decided to turn the game into a charity fundraiser; Hill and her family chose The Cure Starts Now Foundation (TCSN), a charity devoted to DIPG research, as the beneficiary. The foundation would provide the funds from the event to Cincinnati Children's, where Hill had been undergoing treatment, which at the time was working on an international DIPG registry. The fundraising efforts went beyond game proceeds; MSJ invited NCAA member schools to donate a #22 jersey. Hill signed the donated jerseys, which would be auctioned off during the game and in the following days.\nHill and Benjamin also created a charity challenge, modeled after the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, known as \"Layup4Lauren\". Because her cancer caused dizziness and weakened her normally dominant right hand, she was forced to shoot primarily with her left hand. The challenge involves spinning in a complete circle three times, and then making a layup with one's non-dominant hand.\nThe game.\nThe game itself followed the theme of brain cancer awareness. MSJ had special gray uniforms made for the game, but Benjamin did not tell Hill until the team was in the locker room. Gray is recognized as a color for brain cancer awareness (similar to pink and breast cancer), signifying gray matter. During pregame warmups, Hiram wore \"Play for 22\" T-shirts with \"MSJ\" on the front. Many local celebrities were in attendance, as were several national sports luminaries—among them Tennessee women's coach Pat Summitt, Buffalo Bills running back Fred Jackson, and WNBA stars Tamika Catchings, Elena Delle Donne, and Skylar Diggins.\nHill started the game, and after MSJ won the opening tip, they ran a play designed to get Hill a layup for the opening points of the game. The play had been practiced regularly, and the night before the game, MSJ's coaching staff had a dinner with their counterparts from Hiram at which both staffs discussed the play. Hill made the left-handed layup, and the game was immediately stopped. Both teams gave Hill a standing ovation, she was presented with the game ball, and was then helped to the bench by her father. Due to nausea caused by the medication she was taking to control some of the symptoms of her cancer, she spent most of the game on the bench.\nDuring halftime, Hill was presented with the Pat Summitt Most Courageous Award, given by the United States Basketball Writers Association, by Summitt herself. The award was first presented in 1978, with separate men's and women's versions since 2010; the women's award has borne Summitt's name since 2012. The women's version is normally presented during the Women's Final Four, but the USBWA decided to hand out the award at the game, presumably so that Hill could receive it in person. Also during halftime, the NBA and WNBA teams that play in Hill's home state of Indiana, respectively the Indiana Pacers and Indiana Fever, jointly gave a $5,000 check to TCSN.\nThe game was closely fought until MSJ pulled away in the closing minutes. With the Lions having the ball with 30 seconds to play and a safe 9-point lead, Benjamin called a timeout and sent Hill back into the game. They ran another play for Hill, this time for a right-handed layup, but she missed. One of her teammates rebounded the ball and passed it back to her for a second right-handed layup, which she made to close out the scoring in the Lions' 66–55 win. After the game, MSJ announced that $40,000 had been raised for TCSN.\nThe attendance of 10,250 made the game the most-attended NCAA women's game in history that did not involve a Division I team. It more than doubled the previous Division III record of 4,395, set on January 7, 2009, by Calvin when it hosted Trine, and also exceeded the Division II record of 7,543 set by North Dakota State when it hosted North Dakota on February 23, 1996.\nReactions.\nHill's story resonated on social media, with basketball stars such as LeBron James and Candace Parker expressing their admiration for Hill's courage. Delle Donne said, \"When I read Lauren's story and heard about the game, nothing could keep me away. It's incredible what she's doing and how many people she's reached. To be her age and have the kind of perspective to think beyond herself, she's amazing.\"\nESPN writer Alyssa Roenigk summed up the event:If thoughts and emotions produce energy and that energy can alter an atmosphere, if the power of smiles and hugs and \"good afternoons\" and \"be wells\" can build and build until all that positivity overflows to change the molecules of air within a basketball arena, then that is what happened inside the Cintas Center on Sunday. The building overflowed with positive vibes, and that emotion was infectious. This day was not about basketball. It was not about a game. This was a celebration of life and a community coming together to support one girl and two teams as they banded together to beat up on cancer.\nLater developments and legacy.\nThe initially announced fundraising total of $40,000 proved inaccurate. At a ceremony on November 19 at MSJ, Hill presented a check to TCSN for nearly $59,000, representing only proceeds from the \"Play for 22\" game. By that time, funds raised from the game and other initiatives involving Hill, such as the Layup4Lauren challenge and the jersey auction, totaled over $324,000. Her ultimate goal was to raise at least $1 million.\nHill remained in good enough health to travel with the team to its next two games on November 21 and 22 in a tournament hosted by Baldwin Wallace University, located near Cleveland. She played briefly in MSJ's tournament opener, a 69–64 loss to Bethany, scoring two points on a right-handed layup. Hill did not play in MSJ's second tournament game, a 77–68 win over Buffalo State. After her return from the tournament, she went to a Lawrenceburg High game on November 24 under the impression that she would only be supporting her alma mater. Instead, during a halftime ceremony, the school retired her #22, and the city's mayor announced a Lauren Hill Week.\nOn December 3, Hill's family announced in a Facebook post that they had signed her up for in-home hospice care. A recent cutback in her steroids dosage, combined with further growth of her tumor, led to more severe symptoms. Three days later, the V Foundation for Cancer Research, founded by late college coach and broadcaster Jim Valvano in 1993 during his own losing fight with cancer, donated $100,000 to TCSN during halftime of the Jimmy V Women's Classic game between Connecticut and Notre Dame. A statement from Hill, taped at her home, was shown during the presentation. Despite her advancing cancer, she was able to leave hospice care to play in a third game on December 13, the Lions' first game of the season at the Harrington Center against Franklin College. Hill started the game and scored the first two points before being substituted. Hill again started and scored the first basket in the Lions' next game on December 16 against Wooster; the following day, her family announced on Facebook that she had played her last game. At that time, Benjamin sent an email to multiple media outlets stating that Hill would remain on MSJ's bench as an honorary coach as long as her health permitted. On December 30, Hill's goal of raising $1 million for TCSN had been surpassed.\nFox Sports named Hill's first game as the top U.S. sports story of November 2014 in its end-of-year timeline, and the game was named \"Best Moment\" at the 2015 ESPY Awards.\nHill died on April 10, 2015, at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. A public visitation and memorial service was held on April 13, 2015, at the Cintas Center with a private funeral and burial following April 15, 2015.\nOn October 13, 2015, MSJ and Xavier announced the creation of the Lauren Hill Tipoff Classic, intended to be an annual season-opening basketball event. The inaugural event, held November 14, was preceded by the \"2.2M for 22 in 22\" telethon, which aired on three major Cincinnati TV stations for 22 hours. Before her death, Hill increased her fundraising goal to $2.2 million (matching her number), and the telethon was intended to complete this goal. Immediately after the end of the telethon, a women's basketball doubleheader followed at Cintas Center. The opener saw Xavier defeat Evansville 65–57, followed by Hiram defeating MSJ 70–63. All paid spectators at the doubleheader received a bobblehead of Hill scoring her first layup; a total of 5,000 were intended to be given away, but attendance was only 3,122.\nHill's legacy was again remembered at the ceremony for the 2018 Summitt Award. Avery Marz, who had planned to start play at Saint Joseph's in 2014, suffered a stroke while moving into her dormitory room that August. One doctor who treated her told her she would never play again. After one of her rehab sessions, Marz returned home to watch coverage of the Hiram–MSJ game, including the Summitt Award ceremony. She eventually returned to the court for Saint Joseph's in 2017–18, and received the award in March 2018 with Hill's parents and Summitt's son Tyler in attendance. While accepting her award, Marz remarked, \"I had time on my side, and she knew she did not. I knew if I was able to find just half the courage Lauren had, I'd be able to get back on the court.\" Hill's mother likened Marz to her daughter, telling the Associated Press, \"I see of lot of her there. The tenacity and the drive to keep moving forward, to get herself back on the court -- that's exactly what Lauren did.\""

The Boilermakers compete in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Big Ten Conference. They are currently led by head coach Rob Bradley. The Purdue Boilermakers men's golf program has won 12 Big Ten Conference championships and one NCAA national team championship in 1961. The first year of golf at Purdue was in 1921.\nFacilities.\nThe Purdue men's golf team practices and plays at the Birck Boilermaker Golf Complex located on Cherry Lane. The golf complex consists of two, 18-hole Pete Dye golf courses, the Tom Spurgeon Training Center, a range, two putting greens, and two chipping greens. \nAckerman-Allen Golf Course.\nAckerman-Allen was originally called the \"Purdue South Course\" due to its location just south of Cherry Lane. The course was built in 1934 by Indiana Golf Hall of Famer Bill Diddle. Purdue South Course was modified in 1968 by Larry Packard and again in 1996 with the opening of the Birck Boilermaker Golf Complex. The name of the course was changed to Ackerman Hills Golf Course after receiving donations by the Ackerman Family. Ackerman Hills underwent extreme renovations in 2014 by golf course architect Pete Dye with goals of creating a championship-caliber golf course while maintaining its parkland style. The renovations not only expanded the course to nearly 7600 yards from the championship tees, but also incorporated improvements in drainage, irrigation, and pace of play. Modifications to the old, severe-sloping greens were made to accommodate for the faster green speeds demanded nowadays. Tee boxes and tree placement and replacement were also parts of the renovations. These renovations were finished in 2016 and were made possible due to donations by the Ackerman family as well as Samuel R Allen. After renovations, the name was changed to the Ackerman-Allen Golf Course. The finalized, par-72 course features rolling hills, white sand bunkers, and tree lined fairways. The course uses bent grass for its fairways, tees, and greens and offers five tee sets.\nKampen Course.\nKampen Course, originally called the \"Purdue North Course,\" was renovated by Pete Dye in 1996. Dye collaborated with Purdue students in the departments of forestry, entomology, water quality testing, agronomy as well as the superintendent to create a challenging championship course. The renovations included a water reclamation process which allows for the water used on the course to be recycled. The course was renamed to honor Emerson Kampen for his support of Purdue athletics. The Kampen Course is a links-style course featuring vast sand bunkers, native grasslands, ponds and a natural celery bog. The par-72 course has four tee sets and measures over 7400 yards from the championship tees. It uses bent grass for its fairways, tees, and greens. Kampen has been rated one of the top collegiate courses in the nation and was awarded 4.5 stars on Golf Digest's \"Places to Play.\" Kampen has also been rated as one of the hardest golf courses in Indiana. Each year, Purdue holds the Boilermaker Invitational at the Kampen course.\nDue to its notoriety, Kampen has hosted these golf tournaments:\nTom Spurgeon Training Center.\nThis 11,400 square foot training center features heated hitting bays where players can hit balls off artificial turf out onto the range from inside. The hitting bays are equipped with down-the-line and face-on cameras for the Purdue golf team to take videos on and analyze their swings. The training center also has a large, indoor, turf putting room to practice putting during the winter. Also included in the training center are locker rooms for the men's and women's golf team, a lounge area with a TV, and a club repair room.\nIndividual honors.\nAll-Americans.\n\"Note: 1st = first team, 2nd = second team, 3rd = third team, HM = honorable mention\""

In 1983, at the behest of the USFL Gunslingers Head Coach, Gil Steinke, Austin conducted his first pro tryout for \"street\" free agents at Gallaudet University in Washington, DC. After the USFL folded in 1984, Austin began representing several notable NFL players including Tampa Bay Buccaneers Pro Bowler, Wayne Haddix, and NY Jets punter Joe Prokop. During this time Austin began evaluating his own clients in order to more accurately gauge their NFL potential. Other agents became aware of Austin's workout sessions and began sending their clients for evaluation.\nELITE Pro Football Combines.\nIn 1989, Austin founded the ELITE Pro Football Combines, originally called Scout Camp. Its first combine was held at Mt. San Antonio College in Pomona, CA. ELITE was officially endorsed by the Canadian Football League, Arena Football League, XFL, NFL Europe, and the American Football Coaches Association.\nELITE was the first combine to offer players and pro teams streaming internet video in 1996, followed by a multi-criteria searchable player database. ELITE discovered notable NFL players such as Wayne Chrebet and Super Bowl champions Mike Flynn, Nick Harper, and Adam Vinatieri.\nNational Athletic Testing System.\nIn 2000, Austin created the National Athletic Testing System (NATS). NATS was a series of football evaluation camps for high school football players hoping to play college football. NATS camps were conducted by state high school football and athletic associations. The camps also included clinics to help participating players prepare for the Scholastic Aptitude Test. In 2005, NATS received a 1.4 million dollar grant from the National Football League Youth Football Fund and the NFL Players Association. As an additional NATS service, Austin created the Core Course Calculator (CCC) which was the first such web-based software design to help student athletes keep track of their NCAA core course requirements. Austin served as NATS President from 2000 to 2008 and, alongside former Notre Dame University head football coach Tyrone Willingham, vice-chairman from 2005 to 2008.\nNational Football League.\nIn 2010, Austin sold ELITE Pro Football Combines to the National Football League.

Between 1989 and 2014, Austin's Scout Camp, Elite and NFL Regional Combines have conducted over 300 pro football combines - the most in pro football history.\nEntertainment career.\nFrom 2004 to 2006, Austin worked as a paid consultant to King World Productions where he assisted Vice President of Program Development, Mike Stornello, in the development of sports related broadcast content.\nCurrently, Austin is co-creator, producer and lead talent (season one) on the NFL Network hit show “UnDrafted,”. UnDrafted was nominated for an Emmy in its first season (2014) and its third season (2016). UnDrafted is the highest rated show in NFL Network history (excluding game broadcasts).\nAustin is also creator of the show, \"UnStoppable\", which follows the lives of several young high school football players from struggling families who have been overlooked by the Division 1 football programs and have one last chance to earn an athletic scholarship and be the first in their family to attend college. UnStoppable is an Austin Media Group production now in development with Blue Pacific Studios. His show, \"Champs\", also an Austin Media Group production, is in development with Indigenous Films. \nAustin Media Group, LLC.\nAustin founded Austin Media Group (AMG) in 2016.

        "title": "Mitch Harris (baseball)",
        "text": "Mitchell Andrew Harris (born November 7, 1985) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the St. Louis Cardinals in 2015. A native of Florida who grew up in North Carolina, Harris attended the United States Naval Academy. After serving as a Lieutenant in the Navy, Harris became the first Naval Academy graduate to appear in the major leagues since 1921, and just the second ever to do so.\nEarly life.\nMitch Harris was born in Ocala, Florida, the son of Cy and Cindy Harris, and grew up in Mount Holly, North Carolina. He attended South Point High School in Belmont, North Carolina, where he played trombone and lettered in baseball and was all-conference and all-state in 2003 and 2004.\nAt first, very few scouts watched Harris pitch in high school. Having weighed at one point, he was much less imposing than his weight of on his Major League Baseball (MLB) debut. However, the more he pitched, the more he drew notice. After attracting more scouts over time, they eventually rated him as one of the top collegiate pitching prospects.\nCollege baseball career (2005–08).\nHarris attended college at the United States Naval Academy, majoring in general engineering, and playing college baseball as a pitcher and infielder for the Midshipmen. Having ended up at the Academy by chance, a Navy football recruiter named Buddy Green watched him pitch a bullpen session in high school. Green found out that Harris was not interested in football, but was open to attending the Naval Academy, so he made phone calls on his behalf. In spite of the path that led to his entrance into Navy, Harris spent his freshman year as a corner infielder and utility player.\nHowever, when incoming coach Paul Kostacopoulos watched Harris throw during a practice session after his freshman season, he asked him to pitch in the bullpen, where he reached . Impressed with the tryout, Kostacopoulos expanded Harris' role to pitching. As a sophomore, he claimed the Patriot League pitching triple crown with a 10–3 record, 1.74 earned run average (ERA) and 113 strikeouts (SO) in 13 games started. He also hit one home run with 27 runs batted in (RBI) and a .333 batting average.\nThe next season, as a junior, Harris went 8–5 with a 2.14 ERA and a Patriot League-record 119 strikeouts. He also emerged as a force on offense, with a league-leading eight home runs, 47 RBI and a .293 average. He also led Navy in runs batted in, doubles (10), triples (four) and slugging percentage (.534). \"Baseball America\" named Harris a third-team All-American. One of his teammates at Navy, Oliver Drake, also a pitcher, was a selection in the same amateur draft, and made his major league debut for the Baltimore Orioles the month following Harris. Harris' college pitching career totals included a record of 20–13 with a 2.51 ERA and 291 strikeouts over innings. At the plate, he batted .295 with 105 runs scored, 16 home runs and 112 RBI.\nIn 2007, he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League for the Bourne Braves. When he graduated, he was one of the highest-rated pitching prospects for the amateur draft, with a fastball that could reach and a cutter with the ability to break bats.\nU.S. Naval service (2008–13).\nFollowing graduation in 2008 from the Naval Academy, Harris served in the United States Navy for four years, eight months and eight days, attaining the rank of Lieutenant (LT). He was based in Norfolk, Virginia, and deployed a total of three times. One was to the Persian Gulf on the USS \"Ponce\", a amphibious transport dock, where he served as a weapons officer. LT Harris then contributed to a diplomatic mission to Russia on the USS \"Carr\", an Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigate, and to South America for anti-drug operations. He also went to the Baltic states and served as a combat information officer and a training officer. In his time in the military, he visited more than 30 countries. In 2007, he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League for the Bourne Braves.\nWhile aboard ship, Harris played catch whenever he could to keep his pitching skills as well-tuned as possible. He always took his glove, and his father sent bags of balls to him, as they often skipped overboard. His throwing partner was a cook from the Dominican Republic.\nBoth of Harris' grandfathers served in the United States military during World War II. Also a member of the Navy, Louin Harris fought in the Battle of Midway. Serving in the Army, James Chamberlain fought in the Battle of the Bulge.\nProfessional baseball career (2013–2017).\nThe Atlanta Braves selected Harris in the 24th round of the 2007 Major League Baseball Draft, but he did not sign. He was then drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals in the 13th round of the 2008 MLB Draft. He signed with the Cardinals but was unable to play until 2013 due to his commitment to the Navy. He twice petitioned for early release from active duty Navy to the reserves to commence his professional baseball career, in the manner of NBA legend David Robinson. However, the Navy denied Harris' request both times, citing the contemporaneous war in Afghanistan as the reason. John Abbamondi, a former Naval flight officer and the Cardinals' assistant general manager while Harris was in the Navy, wrote letters on his behalf for the early release.\nFirst professional season: State College (2013).\nAfter his five years in service ended in 2013, Harris started his professional baseball career in the Cardinals' minor league system, making his debut with the State College Spikes of the New York–Penn League. After his absence from competition, Harris' fastball velocity had dipped to the low 80s miles per hour. However, the velocity eventually returned to the level of his college playing time. He played for State College exclusively in 2013, appearing in 20 games and going 4–1 with a 0.81 ERA and 29 SO in IP.\nPalm Beach, Springfield and Memphis (2014).\nHarris started 2014 with the Palm Beach Cardinals of the High-A Florida State League. After eight games, St. Louis promoted him to the Double-A Springfield Cardinals. Harris made his final regular season appearance with the Triple-A Memphis Redbirds. Overall, he had a 3.92 ERA in innings. After the season, he competed with Peoria Javelinas in the Arizona Fall League, an off-season showcase of major league prospects, where he was the oldest player by three years.\nSt. Louis Cardinals (2015–2017).\nReassigned to Memphis to start the 2015 season, the Cardinals called Harris up on April 21. He became the first Naval Academy alumnus in Major League Baseball since Nemo Gaines in 1921, and just the second ever. Harris made his big-league pitching debut at Miller Park in Milwaukee against the Brewers on Saturday, April 25, in relief of starter Adam Wainwright, who had injured himself as he ran to first base on a pop out while batting. Harris entered the game in the bottom of the fifth inning, and struck out the first batter he faced, Adam Lind. Harris pitched innings, allowing no runs in the Cardinals' 5–3 win.\nOn May 5, Harris recorded his first MLB win after pitching a scoreless sixth inning in the Cardinals' 7–4 victory over the Chicago Cubs. Through his first seven appearances and innings pitched, he did not allow a run, until May 10 against the Pittsburgh Pirates. On June 19, after appearing in 16 games with a 1–1 record and a 3.63 ERA, the Cardinals optioned him back to Memphis. Harris appeared in five more games and IP at Memphis, allowing three runs on seven hits, before a July 4 recall to the major league club. One week later, the Cardinals placed him on the 15-day DL with a groin strain. He appeared in 26 games, all in relief, finished with a 2–1 record, 3.67 ERA and 13 walks while striking out 15 in 27 innings. After the season, he received the Tony Conigliaro Award, accorded to a player who \"has overcome adversity through the attributes of spirit, determination and courage that were trademarks of Tony C.,\" per former Boston Red Sox historian Dick Bresciani.\nAn arm soreness delaying Harris' spring training preparation, the Cardinals placed him on the disabled list prior to the start of the 2016 season due to nerve compression syndrome. He underwent surgery in June and missed the remainder of the season.\nHarris sought second and third opinions and instead of the expected \"Tommy John surgery\", he had “primary repair,” or “UCL repair with internal brace construction,” which may have a shorter recovery time and hoped to pitch in 2017. He was released on May 9, 2017.\nSee also.\nSt. Louis Cardinals all-time roster"

The boundaries of the swimming pool wash away into the endless horizon, which is at once loaded and ; the scarcity of dialogue or spoken communication simultaneously suggests scar, respite, and threat."

The postseason tournament concluded with the New England Patriots defeating the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XLIX, 28–24, on February 1, at University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.\nTelevision coverage.\nUnder the new U.S. television broadcast contracts that took effect starting this season, television network coverage was slightly altered. ESPN was given the rights to air one Wild Card game per postseason, marking the first time an NFL playoff game exclusively aired on a cable channel. This cable-only experiment lasted only this postseason, as ESPN was later given the right in subsequent years to simulcast its playoff games on sister broadcast network ABC. NBC's rights were also changed so that it would air one Wild Card game and one Divisional playoff game per postseason. CBS and Fox continued to air the rest of the AFC and NFC playoff games, respectively. NBC exclusively televised Super Bowl XLIX. All games were broadcast on Westwood One radio.\nWild Card Playoffs.\nSaturday, January 3, 2015.\nNFC: Carolina Panthers 27, Arizona Cardinals 16.\nCarolina's defense forced three turnovers and held Arizona to an NFL playoff record low of 78 total yards as they advanced to their first postseason win since the 2005 season.\nShort punts by Drew Butler on Arizona's first two drives gave the Panthers excellent field position from the Cardinals' 48-yard line and their own 43-yard line on their first two possessions, which they converted into ten points: A 48-yard Graham Gano field goal and a 13-yard touchdown run by Jonathan Stewart. The Cardinals had to punt again on their next drive, but Panthers receiver Brenton Bersin muffed the kick and Justin Bethel recovered the ball for Arizona on the Carolina 30-yard line. A 15-yard roughing the passer penalty on defensive end Charles Johnson and a 14-yard reception by Larry Fitzgerald moved the ball to the 1-yard line, where Ryan Lindley finished the drive with a touchdown pass to tight end Darren Fells on the first play of the second quarter, cutting the score to 10–7.\nCarolina responded by moving the ball to the Cardinals' 25-yard line, but came up empty when Gano missed a 43-yard field goal attempt. Later in the quarter, Antonio Cromartie intercepted a pass from Cam Newton and returned it 50 yards to the Panthers' 17-yard line. Three plays later, the Cardinals took their first lead of the game, 14–10, on a 1-yard touchdown run by rookie running back Marion Grice. Grice lost the ball as he went into the end zone, and the play was initially ruled a fumble recovered by the Panthers. But after a replay review, the call was reversed on grounds that Grice crossed the goal line before the ball came out of his hands. The Panthers struck back with a 59-yard drive, including Newton's 23-yard completion to receiver Corey Brown, to score on Gano's 39-yard field goal, making the score 14–13 at the end of the half.\nIn the second half, the Panthers completely took over the game, holding Arizona to just 12 yards from scrimmage. Early in the third quarter, Butler's 31-yard punt gave Carolina the ball on the Cardinals' 39-yard line. On the next play, running back Fozzy Whittaker caught a screen pass from Newton and raced all the way to end zone to retake the lead for his team at 20–14. Then Melvin White forced a fumble from Cardinals kick returner Ted Ginn Jr., which Kevin Reddick recovered for Carolina on the Arizona 3-yard line. Two plays later, Newton's 1-yard touchdown pass to fullback Mike Tolbert increased their lead to 27–14.\nAt this point, 4:04 remained in the third quarter, but the Panthers defense would shut out Arizona's offense for the rest of the game. In the fourth quarter, the Cardinals had a chance to get back in the game when linebacker Sam Acho forced a fumble while sacking Newton, which safety Rashad Johnson picked up and returned 30 yards to the Panthers' 8-yard line. But on the next play, Lindley was intercepted by linebacker Luke Kuechly. Later on, they got another scoring chance when Panthers punter Brad Nortman fumbled a snap and was forced out of bounds at the Panthers' 47-yard line. But once again the Cardinals lost a turnover, this time an interception by safety Tre Boston. Arizona would not score again until Nortman deliberately downed the ball in the end zone for a safety with three seconds left on the clock, making the final score 27–16.\nLindley, filling in for injured starter Carson Palmer and injured backup Drew Stanton, completed 16 out of 28 passes, but for just 82 yards and two interceptions. Newton threw for 198 yards with two touchdowns and an interception, while also rushing for 35 yards. Stewart was the top rusher for the game with 123 yards and a touchdown, and Charles Johnson had 2½ sacks. This was the second time in NFL history that a team made the playoffs with a losing record and still won their first game.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Cardinals and Panthers. Arizona won the prior meeting 33–13 in the 2008 NFC Divisional playoffs.\nAFC: Baltimore Ravens 30, Pittsburgh Steelers 17.\nBaltimore forced three turnovers and scored on 6-of-9 possessions to defeat Pittsburgh on the road for the first time in franchise playoff history.\nThe Steelers scored first with a 43-yard drive, including a 22-yard completion from Ben Roethlisberger to Martavis Bryant, that ended on a 45-yard Shaun Suisham field goal. Baltimore responded with a 9-play, 80-yard drive that gave them a 7–3 lead on Bernard Pierce's 5-yard touchdown run with 12:28 left in the second quarter. Roethlisberger struck back with an 18-yard completion to Antonio Brown and a 30-yarder to tight end Heath Miller that set up Suisham's 22-yard field goal. Baltimore quarterback Joe Flacco countered with a 23-yard pass to Steve Smith Sr. and a 19-yard completion to Owen Daniels on the way to a 28-yard field goal by Justin Tucker, making the score 10–6. With 42 seconds left in the half, Suisham kicked a 47-yard field goal that cut the score to 10–9 going into halftime.\nOn the Ravens' opening drive of the second half, Flacco completed a 17-yard pass to Torrey Smith on third and 12, allowing the team to hang onto the ball and drive to a 45-yard field goal by Tucker. Then after a Steelers punt, Flacco hooked up with Smith Sr. for a 40-yard completion before throwing an 11-yard touchdown pass to Smith, increasing the team's lead to 20–9.\nEarly in the fourth quarter, Pittsburgh defensive end Stephon Tuitt recovered a fumble from running back Justin Forsett on the Ravens' 45-yard line. Roethlisberger completed a 44-yard pass to Brown on the next play, and eventually got the ball into the end zone with a 6-yard toss to Bryant. Their two-point conversion attempt failed, but the Steelers had cut their deficit to one score at 20–15. However, they would get no closer. Baltimore responded with a 23-yard reception by Daniels that set up Tucker's 52-yard field goal. Then linebacker Terrell Suggs intercepted a pass from Roethlisberger, and Flacco increased the Ravens' lead to 30–15 with a 21-yard touchdown pass to tight end Crockett Gillmore on the next play. The Steelers responded with a drive to the Baltimore 14-yard line, but came up empty when safety Darian Stewart picked off a pass from Roethlisberger in the end zone. Pittsburgh did manage two more points when Shamarko Thomas blocked Sam Koch's punt, knocking the ball through the end zone for a safety. But after the free kick, Stewart put the game away by recovering a fumble from Miller.\nRoethlisbeger finished the day 31-for-44 for 334 yards and a touchdown, with two interceptions. His top target was Brown, who caught nine passes for 117 yards. Flacco was 18-for-29 for 255 yards and two touchdowns, while Smith Sr. was the Ravens top receiver with five receptions for 101 yards.\nThe win gave the Ravens their first postseason victory over the Steelers in four tries, having previously lost to them in 2001, 2008, and 2010, all at Heinz Field. It is the Steelers' first loss in the playoffs against a division opponent since losing to the Philadelphia Eagles in the 1947 NFL Eastern Division playoff, and first-ever postseason loss to an AFC Central/AFC North rival since the 1970 merger. For the first time in eight tries, a Baltimore-based major professional sports team defeated its Pittsburgh counterpart in that sport's postseason tournament.\nThis was the fourth postseason meeting between the Ravens and Steelers. Pittsburgh won all three prior meetings at home, including 31–24 in the 2010 AFC Divisional playoffs.\nSunday, January 4, 2015.\nAFC: Indianapolis Colts 26, Cincinnati Bengals 10.\nThe Colts scored on their opening drive, advancing the ball 71 yards in nine plays, including a 27-yard burst by Dan Herron, on the way to Herron's 2-yard touchdown run. After an exchange of punts, an 18-yard run by Bengals running back Jeremy Hill and Andy Dalton's 26-yard completion to Rex Burkhead sparked a 74-yard, 9-play drive that tied the game with Hill's 1-yard score.\nIn the second quarter, Colts quarterback Andrew Luck completed a 30-yard pass to T. Y. Hilton that set up Adam Vinatieri's 38-yard field goal, putting the team back in front at 10–7. Then after a punt, Luck completed a 45-yard pass to Hakeem Nicks, leading to another Vinatieri field goal that made the score 13–7. The Bengals were subsequently forced to punt again, but with just under two minutes left in the half, cornerback Darqueze Dennard forced a fumble from Herron that safety Reggie Nelson recovered and returned six yards to the Cincinnati 41-yard line. Dalton then led the team to the Colts' 39-yard line, where Mike Nugent made a 57-yard field goal, the second longest kick in NFL playoff history, cutting the score to 13–10 going into halftime.\nThe Colts' defense dominated the Bengals in the second half, forcing them to a three-and-out on their first four drives. On the opposing side, Luck threw a 36-yard touchdown to rookie receiver Donte Moncrief with 7:48 left in the third quarter. Then after a punt, the Colts drove 57 yards and scored on Vinatieri's 22-yard field goal, bringing the score to 23–10. On their next possession, Vinatieri made his fourth field goal of the day, a franchise playoff record 53-yard kick, giving the Colts a 26–10 lead. Meanwhile, the Bengals' following three possessions would result in another punt, a lost fumble by Dalton, and time expiring in the game.\nDalton finished the game 18-for-35 for 155 yards, along with 34 yards on the ground. Luck completed 31 of 44 passes for 376 yards and a touchdown, while also rushing for 18 yards. Hilton was his top target, with six catches for 103 yards. Herron had 56 rushing yards and ten receptions for 85 yards.\nThe game marked another round of dismal postseason milestones for the Bengals, who have not won a playoff game since the 1990 season, the longest active streak in the NFL. They became the first team in NFL history to lose in the opening round of the playoffs for four consecutive seasons, while coach Marvin Lewis tied Jim E. Mora for the worst coaching record in playoff history (0–6). The Bengals have now lost seven consecutive playoff games, the second highest total ever behind the Detroit Lions and Kansas City Chiefs' record of eight.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Bengals and Colts. The then-Baltimore Colts won the prior meeting 17–0 in the 1970 AFC Divisional playoffs.\nNFC: Dallas Cowboys 24, Detroit Lions 20.\nDallas faced an early 14-point deficit and trailed for most of the time in regulation, but after a controversial non-call on an apparent pass interference against their defense in the fourth quarter, quarterback Tony Romo led the team 59 yards for the game winning score.\nDetroit forced a three-and-out on Dallas' opening possession and then scored on their own with Matthew Stafford's 51-yard touchdown pass to receiver Golden Tate. Later on, Dallas punter Chris Jones pinned the Lions back at their own 1-yard line with a 51-yard kick. The Lions were forced to punt from the 6-yard line, but Cowboys linebacker Dekoda Watson was penalized for running into the punter on the play, giving Detroit a first down. Taking full advantage of their second chance, Detroit ended up driving 99 yards in 14 plays to score on an 18-yard burst by Reggie Bush, giving them a 14–0 lead with less than two minutes left in the first quarter.\nThere would be no more scoring until 1:50 remained in the second quarter, when Dallas had the ball on their own 24-yard line. Romo fired a pass to receiver Terrance Williams, who caught the ball in stride on a 10-yard slant and took off past the defense for a 76-yard touchdown completion, cutting the score to 14–7. Stafford responded by completing 6-of-8 passes for 59 yards, including a 19-yard completion to Calvin Johnson, on a 59-yard drive that ended with Matt Prater's 39-yard field goal, putting the team up 17–7 going into halftime.\nDallas had a great opportunity to score when linebacker Kyle Wilber intercepted a pass from Stafford and returned it five yards to the Lions' 19-yard line on the first play of the second half. However, after picking up nine yards with their first two plays, Romo was sacked for a 13-yard loss by Ezekiel Ansah on third and 1, and then Dan Bailey missed a 43-yard field goal. Stafford then hooked up with Johnson for a 28-yard completion that led to Prater's 37-yard field goal, increasing Detroit's lead to 20–7. However, Dallas responded with an 80-yard scoring drive, featuring a 43-yard reception by receiver Dez Bryant, that ended with a 1-yard touchdown run by DeMarco Murray on fourth and goal, trimming their deficit to one possession, 20–14.\nOn the second to last play of the third quarter, Romo threw a 19-yard completion to Cole Beasley. Then on the first play of the fourth quarter, an unnecessary roughness penalty on linebacker Tahir Whitehead turned Beasley's 12-yard reception into a 27-yard gain. The Cowboys were pushed back to the Detroit 33-yard line after Romo was sacked on consecutive plays by Ndamukong Suh, but Bailey made a 51-yard field goal, cutting the score to 20–17. On the Lions' ensuing possession, the most controversial play of the game occurred. Stafford threw a pass intended for tight end Brandon Pettigrew who was being covered by Cowboys rookie linebacker Anthony Hitchens. Hitchens held Pettigrew's jersey before knocking him down as the pass fell incomplete. Back judge Lee Dyer threw a flag for defensive pass interference. After referee Pete Morelli announced the penalty, head linesman Jerry Bergman determined that Hitchens' actions did not warrant a penalty. Morelli then announced there was no foul on the play and the flag was picked up.\nThe decision to change the initial call received significant media attention after the game and was widely decried as incorrect. NFL Vice President of Officiating Dean Blandino stated that the no-call on pass interference was debatable, but holding definitely should have been called on the play.\nThe reversed call turned out to be crucial. Detroit tried to force the Cowboys to go offside on fourth and 1, but failed to do so and were penalized five yards for delay of game. Now faced with fourth and 6, Detroit decided to punt, and Sam Martin, who had averaged 48 yards on his last three kicks, shanked the ball, sending it out of bounds after netting just 10 yards to the Cowboys' 41-yard line. Romo then led the Cowboys 59 yards in 14 plays for the game-winning score, converting a fourth down and two third downs along the way. Faced with fourth and 6 from the Detroit 42-yard line, Romo completed a 21-yard pass to tight end Jason Witten. The NFL later admitted that Suh was held on the play despite the game officials' no-call. Later on, Romo threw an incomplete pass on third and 7, but a defensive holding call on DeAndre Levy gave Dallas a first down on the Lions' 7-yard line. Two plays later, on third and 8, Romo finished the drive with a touchdown pass to Williams, giving the Cowboys their first lead of the game at 24–20 with 2:32 left in regulation. A few plays into Detroit's ensuing drive, Stafford lost a fumble that was recovered by Dallas rookie defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence. Instead of falling on the ball, he returned it and ended up fumbling it back to Detroit. The Lions got the ball back and drove into Cowboys territory, but on fourth and 3 on the Cowboys' 42-yard line, Lawrence redeemed himself and forced and recovered a fumble from Stafford, enabling the Cowboys to run out the rest of the clock.\nStafford completed 28 of 42 passes for 323 yards and a touchdown, with an interception. Tate caught eight passes for 89 yards and a touchdown, while Johnson had five catches for 85 yards. Romo finished 19-for-31 for 293 yards and two touchdowns. Williams caught three passes for 93 yards and two scores. Murray rushed for 75 yards and a touchdown, while also catching three passes for 22 yards.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Lions and Cowboys. Both teams split the prior two meetings. The last meeting was won by Detroit in the 1991 NFC Divisional playoffs which was their only playoff win in the Super Bowl era until 2023.\nDivisional Playoffs.\nSaturday, January 10, 2015.\nAFC: New England Patriots 35, Baltimore Ravens 31.\nWith only 13 rushing attempts for 14 total yards, New England put the game almost entirely in the hands of quarterback Tom Brady, who proved up to the task, completing 33 of 50 passes for 367 yards and three touchdowns while also rushing for a score as he led the team back from two 14-point deficits to earn their fourth consecutive AFC Championship Game and their ninth in his 14 years as the team's starter.\nBaltimore stormed to an early lead on their first drive, as Joe Flacco connected with Steve Smith Sr. for 19 yards and Torrey Smith for 22 before getting the ball into the end zone with a 19-yard completion to Kamar Aiken. Following a New England punt, Ravens running back Justin Forsett rushed four times for 32 yards, while Flacco completed five of six passes for 40 yards, the last one a 9-yard touchdown pass to Smith Sr. to give Baltimore a 14–0 lead with 4:44 left in the first quarter.\nHowever, this time New England managed to respond. Faced with third and 8 from his own 24-yard line, Brady completed a 16-yard pass to tight end Rob Gronkowski. On the next play, he completed a 46-yard pass to Gronkowski on the Ravens' 14-yard line, and eventually he finished the 8-play, 78-yard drive with a 4-yard touchdown run. After the next three drives ended in punts, New England drove 67 yards, including a 23-yard reception by Gronkowski on third and 8, to tie the score at 14–14 with Brady's 15-yard touchdown pass to Danny Amendola with 3:37 left in the second quarter. But just before halftime, Ravens linebacker Daryl Smith intercepted a pass from Brady at the Baltimore 43-yard line. Aided by a 20-yard pass interference penalty, the Ravens drove 57 yards in six plays and took a 21–14 lead on Flacco's 11-yard touchdown pass to tight end Owen Daniels in the back of the end zone with 10 seconds left in the half.\nBaltimore retook their 14-point lead with the first drive of the second half, after Flacco's 35-yard completion to Smith on the Patriots' 1-yard line. A taunting penalty against Smith moved the ball back to the 16-yard line, but the Ravens still scored on the next play with Flacco's 16-yard completion to Forsett to make the score 28–14. New England responded by making some key adjustments to their formation for their ensuing drive. Having already lost starting center Bryan Stork for the game with an injury, the Patriots went with four linemen, while playing tight end Michael Hoomanawanui and running back Shane Vereen on the line next to them. This confused the Baltimore defense as to which players were eligible receivers — though they did announce it to officials as required — aiding the Patriots on a 9-play, 80-yard touchdown drive in which the team never faced a third down. This infuriated Ravens coach John Harbaugh enough that he stormed onto the field to argue with officials, earning his team a penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct. Shortly after, Brady threw a 5-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski, cutting the score to 28–21. After a Baltimore punt, Brady tossed a lateral pass across the field to receiver Julian Edelman, who promptly threw a 51-yard touchdown pass to a wide-open Amendola, tying the game at 28 with under four minutes left in the third quarter. Then Patriots safety Devin McCourty gave his team a great chance to take the lead by intercepting a pass from Flacco on the Ravens' 37-yard line. It was Flacco's first postseason interception in his last 197 postseason pass attempts ending the second longest streak of passes without an interception by a quarterback in postseason history. However New England was unable to move the ball and punted rather than try a long field goal attempt.\nEarly in the fourth quarter, Ravens kicker Justin Tucker finished a 16-play, 73-yard drive, which included Flacco's 11-yard completion to fullback Kyle Juszczyk on fourth and 1 from the Patriots' 36-yard line, with a 25-yard field goal, giving his team the lead at 31–28. Taking the ball back at their own 26-yard line, New England drove 74 yards in 10 plays for what turned out to be the game winning score. On the third play of the drive, Baltimore recovered a fumble from Vereen, only to see it overturned by replay review. Later, Brady converted the only third down on the drive, hitting Amendola with a 6-yard pass on third and 6. Finally with 5:13 left on the clock, he threw a 23-yard touchdown pass to receiver Brandon LaFell, giving New England their first and only lead of the game, 35–31. Baltimore responded with a drive to the New England 36-yard line, but with 1:37 left in the game, safety Duron Harmon intercepted Flacco's pass in the end zone. After the Ravens managed to force a punt with a few seconds left on the clock, Flacco threw a final Hail Mary pass to the end zone that was knocked down for an incompletion.\nAfter the game, Harbaugh complained about New England's unusual formation use on their third quarter touchdown drive. \"It's not something that anybody has ever done before,\" Harbaugh said. \"They're an illegal type of a thing and I'm sure that [the league will] make some adjustments and things like that. We wanted an opportunity to be able to identify who the eligible players were, because what they were doing was they would announce the eligible player and Tom would take it to the line right away and snap the ball before [we] even figured out who was lined up where. And that was the deception part of it. It was clearly deception.\" \"Maybe those guys gotta study the rule book and figure it out,\" Brady countered in response. \"We obviously knew what we were doing and we made some pretty important plays. It was a real good weapon for us. Maybe we'll have something in store next week.\" The NFL sided with New England, finding that their methods were legal. In the ensuing offseason, in response to these tactics taken by the Patriots, the league passed a new rule requiring all ineligible receivers, including any offensive player with an eligible number that declares himself ineligible, to line up inside the tackle box prior to the snap.\nFlacco finished the game 28-for-45 for 292 yards and a postseason career high four touchdowns, with two interceptions – his first multi interception postseason game in his last nine postseason games. Flacco's postseason record also fell to 1–5 when he throws at least one interception while it remained a perfect 9–0 when he does not throw an interception. Forsett rushed for 129 yards, while also catching two passes for 17 yards and a score. Gronkowski was the top receiver of the game with seven receptions for 108 yards and a touchdown.\nBrady and Patriots coach Bill Belichick set numerous NFL and franchise playoff records in the game. Brady became the NFL's career postseason leader in passing yards and touchdown passes (46), surpassing Joe Montana on his final touchdown pass of the game. He set a franchise record for completions in a postseason game (33), while also tying a franchise playoff record for career rushing touchdowns (5). This was Belichick's 20th postseason win, tying the all-time record held by Tom Landry. This was also the first time in playoff history that a team had come back from two 14-point deficits to win a game.\nThis was the fourth postseason meeting between the Ravens and Patriots. Baltimore won two of the three prior meetings that all took place at Gillette Stadium, including winning the last meeting 28–13 in the 2012 AFC Championship Game.\nNFC: Seattle Seahawks 31, Carolina Panthers 17.\nRussell Wilson threw three touchdowns and the Seahawks strong safety Kam Chancellor had a career game as Seattle defeated Carolina 31–17 to advance to their second consecutive NFC Championship Game.\nAfter both teams opened with punts on their first two possessions, Seattle forced the first turnover of the game when Richard Sherman intercepted Cam Newton at the Seahawks' 38-yard line. Following another Seahawks punt, Carolina again turned the ball over when Newton fumbled the handoff on an option play and it was recovered by Seattle's Tony McDaniel at Carolina's 28-yard line. On the ensuing possession Seattle opened the scoring when Wilson connected with Doug Baldwin on a 16-yard touchdown pass. Carolina responded with a 14-play, 79-yard drive which consumed over eight minutes and ended with Newton's 7-yard touchdown pass to Kelvin Benjamin to tie the game at 7. Seattle then retook the lead when, on a third and 7 play, Wilson passed to Jermaine Kearse who made a one-handed catch and ran 63 yards for a touchdown, the longest touchdown reception in Seahawks playoff history. Carolina then mounted a 13-play drive into Seattle territory to close out the half. After driving to the Seattle 24-yard line, Earl Thomas appeared to intercept Newton at the 2-yard line, but the interception was overturned after a review. While attempting a 40-yard field goal, Graham Gano missed wide left but Kam Chancellor was called for running into the kicker. Gano then converted a 35-yard field goal as time expired with Seattle leading 14–10 at halftime.\nOn the first drive of the second half, Seattle got into Carolina territory before Wilson was sacked on third down by Mario Addison to force a punt. After a Carolina punt, Seattle mounted a 12-play, 69-yard drive which included a 25-yard Marshawn Lynch run and reached the Carolina 7-yard line but settled for a 37-yard Steven Hauschka field goal when Wilson was sacked by Thomas Davis. Seattle forced another Carolina punt, and on their next drive Wilson found Luke Willson for a 29-yard pass to the Carolina 25-yard line and then connected with Willson again for a 25-yard touchdown to take a 24–10 lead. Facing a third and 13 from their own 17-yard line, on Carolina's next drive, Newton converted with a 19-yard pass to Ed Dickson, then connected with Greg Olsen on a 31-yard pass to the Seattle 19-yard line. Newton, however, was then intercepted for a second time by Chancellor, who returned it 90 yards for a touchdown. Down by 21 points, Newton threw a 15-yard touchdown to Benjamin with 2:34 remaining to make the score 31–17, but Carolina was unable to recover the onside kick and Seattle ran out the clock for the victory.\nWilson finished as the leading passer, going 15-for-22 for 268 yards and three touchdowns. Kearse recorded 129 yards and a touchdown on three receptions. Benjamin led Carolina with seven receptions for 75 yards and two touchdowns. The win was Seattle's eighth consecutive home playoff win. Seattle also became the first defending Super Bowl champion to win a playoff game since the 2005 season.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Panthers and Seahawks. Seattle won the prior meeting 34–14 in the 2005 NFC Championship Game.\nSunday, January 11, 2015.\nNFC: Green Bay Packers 26, Dallas Cowboys 21.\nIn the first playoff game between these teams in Green Bay since the 1967 NFL Championship Game, Aaron Rodgers threw two second half touchdowns as the Packers overcame an 8-point deficit to defeat the Cowboys 26–21.\nAfter a Dallas punt on their opening possession, Green Bay mounted a 10-play drive which featured 45 rushing yards from Eddie Lacy and ended when Rodgers threw a 4-yard touchdown pass to Andrew Quarless. Dallas responded with their own 12-play drive which was prolonged with a Brad Jones holding penalty on third down. After a Tramon Williams pass interference call put the ball on the Green Bay 1-yard line, Tony Romo connected with Tyler Clutts for a touchdown. On their next drive Green Bay drove to the Dallas 27-yard line before Rodgers was strip-sacked by Jeremy Mincey, who recovered the fumble for Dallas. Five plays later Romo threw a 38-yard touchdown pass to Terrance Williams to give Dallas a 14–7 lead. After forcing a Green Bay punt – Green Bay's first punt at home in the first half in five games – Dallas drove to the Green Bay 33-yard line before Romo connected with Jason Witten on second and 7 for what appeared to be a first down. Upon review, however, the ball was spotted one-yard short and Dallas failed to convert the third down to force a field goal. Dan Bailey's 50-yard attempt, however, was blocked by Datone Jones and missed wide right. On a second and 20 on their next drive Rodgers converted with a 31-yard pass to Randall Cobb, and Mason Crosby hit a 40-yard field goal as time expired to cut Green Bay's deficit to 14–10 at halftime.\nGreen Bay was forced to punt on the opening drive of the second half, but on Dallas' ensuing possession Julius Peppers forced a fumble by DeMarco Murray which was recovered by Jones at the Dallas 44-yard line. Lacy then ran for 29 yards to the 16-yard line before Rodgers hit Davante Adams to get inside the 10-yard line. T. J. Lang, however, was called for unnecessary roughness and Green Bay was unable to convert a third and 16 and settled for a Crosby 30-yard field goal. Romo then threw a 20-yard pass to Dez Bryant and a 15-yard pass to Witten before Murray rushed for 26 yards to the Green Bay 1-yard line and scored a touchdown on the next play to make the score 21–13. On Green Bay's ensuing drive Rodgers converted a third down with a 16-yard pass to Adams, hit Cobb for a 26-yard gain, then on third and 15 connected with Adams for a 46-yard touchdown to get within one entering the fourth quarter. After a Dallas punt, Rodgers completed seven consecutive passes including a 13-yard touchdown to Richard Rodgers II. The two-point conversion attempt, however, was unsuccessful, and Green Bay led 26–21 with 9:10 remaining. Driving into Green Bay territory, Romo completed a 9-yard pass to Cole Beasley to set up a fourth and 2 from Green Bay's 32-yard line. The Cowboys attempted a pass play on fourth and 2 to Bryant, which was initially ruled a completion. However, Packers coach Mike McCarthy challenged the ruling on the field, initiating an instant replay review of the call by referee Gene Steratore and other officials. After the play was reviewed, the ruling was changed to an incomplete pass because Bryant did not maintain control of the ball after it hit the ground. This was a very controversial call. In March 2018, the NFL created a new rule under which this would have been a catch. Three years later the NFL announced that in fact Bryant completed the catch. \"According to New York Giants owner and NFL competition committee member, John Mara, the league reached a unanimous agreement that it should be ruled a completion in the future. They've also acknowledged that it's time to create a clear definition of what a catch is to prevent further confusion.\"\nRodgers finished 24-for-35 for 316 yards and three touchdowns with no interceptions, ensuring that he would end the season without throwing an interception at home and that he would be 9–0 at home during the season. He finished the game going 9-for-9 in the fourth quarter, the most attempts without an incompletion in the fourth quarter of a playoff game in 25 years. Murray was the leading rusher with 123 yards and a touchdown on 25 carries, while Lacy had 101 yards on 19 attempts. Adams and Cobb both had over 100 yards receiving for Green Bay, with Adams catching seven passes for 117 yards and a touchdown and Cobb having eight receptions for 116 yards.\nThis was the sixth postseason meeting between the Cowboys and Packers. Dallas previously won four of the prior six matchups, which includes victories in three consecutive postseasons capped off by winning 38–27 in the 1995 NFC Championship Game.\nAFC: Indianapolis Colts 24, Denver Broncos 13.\nThe Colts held the Broncos, who finished the season with the NFL's second-highest scoring offense, to 288 total yards and just two field goals in the final 55 minutes and prevailed 24–13 to advance to their first AFC Championship Game since the 2009 season. During the regular season, Denver averaged 35 points per game at home, and had finished 8–0.\nAfter forcing an Indianapolis three-and-out on the opening possession, Denver advanced into Colts territory after an Arthur Jones roughing the passer penalty before Peyton Manning hit Julius Thomas for a 32-yard pass to the 1-yard line and then Demaryius Thomas for a 1-yard touchdown. Both teams then punted on their next possessions before Indianapolis drove to the Denver 6-yard line including 20- and 23-yard passes to T. Y. Hilton. The Colts capped off the drive with a Dan Herron 6-yard touchdown run at the beginning of the second quarter to tie the game. On Denver's next possession Manning was strip-sacked by Jonathan Newsome and the fumble was recovered by the Colts' Jerrell Freeman at the Denver 41-yard line. Indianapolis drove inside the 10-yard line after an Andrew Luck 22-yard pass to Donte Moncrief before Luck hit Dwayne Allen for a 3-yard touchdown to give the Colts a 14–7 advantage. After forcing a Denver punt, Indianapolis got inside Broncos territory again but came up empty when Adam Vinatieri missed a 44-yard field goal. On Indianapolis' next possession Luck was intercepted by Bradley Roby at the Denver 47-yard line. Manning then converted a third down with a 17-yard pass to Emmanuel Sanders before Connor Barth kicked a 45-yard field goal with two seconds left in the half to make the score 14–10 at halftime.\nDenver opened the second half with a three-and-out before Indianapolis mounted an 11-play drive which included a 32-yard pass from Luck to Coby Fleener on third and 16. Luck then connected with Hakeem Nicks for a 15-yard touchdown to give Indianapolis a 21–10 lead. When Denver punted again on their next possession, Josh Cribbs was tackled by Omar Bolden and the fumble was recovered by Denver's Andre Caldwell. After review, however, Cribbs was ruled down by contact and Indianapolis retained possession. Luck threw his second interception to Rahim Moore, and Denver responded with a 14-play drive during which Manning went 7-for-9 for 38 yards and C. J. Anderson converted on fourth down with a 7-yard run but had to settle for a 41-yard Barth field goal to cut the deficit to eight points. Both teams then punted on their next possessions before Indianapolis went on a 13-play drive which consumed more than eight minutes and ended with a Vinatieri 30-yard field goal. Now down by 11 points with 4:06 remaining, Manning hit Wes Welker for a 20-yard completion but a fourth and 8 pass to Anderson came up one yard short of a first down. Denver was able to force an Indianapolis punt and take possession with 1:52 remaining, but got no further than the Colts' 23-yard line before time expired.\nLuck went 27-for-43 for 265 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions. He finished with 1,703 career postseason passing yards, the most by a quarterback in their first five postseason games. Manning finished 26-for-46 for 211 yards and a touchdown; he went just 7-for-18 (38.9%) in the first half, his lowest completion percentage in a first half of any game since 2007. Anderson was the leading rusher with 80 yards on 18 carries, while Hilton led all receivers with 72 yards on four receptions. The loss was Manning's ninth in his team's first playoff game, with no other quarterback having more than four such losses.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Colts and Broncos. Both prior meetings were won by the Peyton Manning-led Colts in consecutive postseasons, the more recent by a score of 49–24 in the 2004 AFC Wild Card playoffs.\nAs of 2024 this was the last playoff loss for the Broncos.\nConference Championships.\nSunday, January 18, 2015.\nNFC: Seattle Seahawks 28, Green Bay Packers 22 (OT).\nTrailing 16–0 at halftime and 19–7 with under three minutes left in the game, Russell Wilson, despite throwing four interceptions, rallied his team to a tremendous comeback and won the game on a 35-yard touchdown pass to Jermaine Kearse in overtime, making the Seahawks the first team to get to consecutive Super Bowls since the 2004 New England Patriots, and the first NFC team to make consecutive Super Bowl appearances since the 1997 Green Bay Packers. Their sixteen-point halftime comeback was the largest ever in a conference championship game, besting the fifteen point halftime deficit by the Indianapolis Colts against the New England Patriots in 2006 (in which they had trailed 21–3).\nGreen Bay took the opening kickoff and drove to the Seattle 29-yard line, only to lose the ball when cornerback Richard Sherman made a leaping interception of an Aaron Rodgers pass in the end zone. However, Seattle fared no better, as Wilson was intercepted a few plays later by safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix, who returned the ball 26 yards to the Seahawks' 4-yard line before a penalty pushed the team back to the 19-yard line. Green Bay managed to reach the Seattle 1-yard line, but they failed to break the goal line with consecutive running plays, forcing them to settle for Mason Crosby's 19-yard field goal. Then Packers linebacker Brad Jones forced a fumble from kick returner Doug Baldwin, which safety Morgan Burnett recovered on the Seahawks' 23-yard line. The Packers again drove to the 1-yard line, but had to settle for another Crosby field goal to go up 6–0. Following a Seahawks punt, Green Bay increased their lead to 13–0 with a 7-play, 56-yard drive that ended on Rodgers' 13-yard touchdown pass to Randall Cobb on the last play of the first quarter.\nEarly in the second quarter, Micah Hyde returned a punt 29 yards to the Seattle 33-yard line, setting up Crosby's third field goal that increased Green Bay's lead to 16–0, the only score of the quarter. On the first play after the ensuing kickoff, Clinton-Dix intercepted another pass from Wilson, giving Green Bay a first down on their 44-yard line. But a few plays later, Rodgers returned the favor by throwing a pass that was intercepted by Byron Maxwell. Seattle then drove to the Packers' 18-yard line, only to have Wilson throw an interception to Sam Shields in the end zone.\nAfter an exchange of punts started the second half, Seattle finally got on the board with an 11-play, 78-yard drive, featuring a 29-yard completion from Wilson to Baldwin. Faced with fourth and 10 on the Packers' 19-yard line, the Seahawks made one of the most critical plays of the game. Coach Pete Carroll sent the field goal unit onto the field, but ran a fake field goal play with punter Jon Ryan, previously utilized as the holder, taking the snap and running to the left. As he headed for the line of scrimmage, he managed to pull the entire Green Bay defense toward him, leaving rookie offensive tackle Garry Gilliam, who had checked in as an eligible receiver, wide open down the field. Ryan threw a pass just before reaching the line, which Gilliam hauled in for a touchdown, cutting the Seahawks' deficit to 16–7. Gilliam had played tight end for two years in college before converting to the tackle position, but in that time had never caught a touchdown pass, making this one his first.\nEarly in the fourth quarter, a 32-yard burst by Packers running back James Starks sparked a 57-yard drive that ended with Crosby's 48-yard field goal, putting Green Bay up 19–7. Green Bay seemed in control of the game now, especially when Wilson threw a pass that bounced out the hands of Kearse and was intercepted by Burnett, who, following the hand signals of teammate Julius Peppers motioning for him to go down, quickly slid to the turf after the interception giving Green Bay a first down at their own 43-yard line with just over 5 minutes left in the game. There appeared to be an open field for Burnett to make a substantial return, which would become a point of controversy post-game due to the contest's ensuing change of fates. Seattle made a crucial defensive stand after the turnover as the Packers attempted to run down the clock; three carries by Eddie Lacy resulted in a tackle by Kevin Williams for a 4-yard loss, a tackle by Michael Bennett for a 2-yard loss, and a 2-yard gain. Green Bay had forced Seattle to use two timeouts, but they punted the ball back after running just 1:12 off the clock. Taking the ball back on their 31-yard line with 3:52 left, Seattle running back Marshawn Lynch started the drive with a 14-yard run. Then Wilson hooked up with Baldwin for a 20-yard completion, and later connected with Lynch for a 26-yard gain. Two plays later, Wilson scored on a 1-yard touchdown run, trimming Green Bay's lead to 19–14.\nWith 2:09 and one timeout remaining, Seattle decided to attempt an onside kick. With a pending recovery by the Packers seemingly punching their ticket to the championship game, Steven Hauschka's kick went up in the air and straight to Packers tight end Brandon Bostick. Bostick, the Packers' third-string tight end, misplayed the Seahawk's attempt, stepping in front of all-pro receiver Jordy Nelson who was waiting for the ball, and ignoring his own blocking assignment in the process. The ball subsequently bounced into the air off of Bostick's helmet and facemask after going through his hands, and was recovered by Seahawks wide receiver Chris Matthews. From there it took Seattle just four plays to score on Lynch's 24-yard touchdown run with 1:25 remaining on the clock. On the subsequent 2-point conversion play, Wilson was flushed out of the pocket, forced to run backwards and to the right sideline. Just before being hit, he launched a high floating pass from the 17-yard line to the opposite side of the field. Tight end Luke Willson, who had not been assigned to do anything except block on the play, caught Wilson's pass at the 1-yard line and took the ball into the end zone to give the Seahawks a 22–19 lead. After the kickoff, Rodgers completed a pair of 15-yard passes to Cobb and Jordy Nelson. Then he scrambled 12 yards to the Seahawks' 36-yard line. Following two incompletions and a 6-yard toss to Nelson, Crosby kicked his fifth field goal of the day, tying the score at 22–22 with 14 seconds left on the clock and sending the game into overtime.\nSeattle won the coin toss and started overtime backed up on their own 13-yard line. After driving to the 30-yard line, they found themselves facing third and 6. Wilson took the snap and fired a pass to Baldwin, who broke ahead of Casey Hayward on a streak pattern down the right sideline and hauled in the catch for a 35-yard gain to the Packers' 35-yard line. On the next play, Wilson launched a nearly identical pass to Jermaine Kearse, who was running straight down the middle of the field. Kearse was tightly covered by Tramon Williams, but managed to pull ahead of him just enough to make the catch for a 35-yard touchdown reception, sending Seattle to their third Super Bowl in franchise history. This was Kearse's only catch of the game. Prior to this, he had been targeted five times by Wilson, four of those five attempts had been intercepted.\nWilson finished the game 14-for-29 for 209 yards and a touchdown, with four interceptions, while also rushing for 25 yards and a touchdown. Baldwin was the top receiver of the game with six receptions for 106 yards, while also returning three kickoffs for 58 yards. Lynch had 25 carries for 157 yards and a touchdown, while also catching a 26-yard pass. Rodgers was 19-for-34 for 178 yards and a touchdown, with two interceptions. Lacy was the team's top rusher with 73 yards, while Nelson was their top receiver with five receptions for 71 yards. Burnett had 10 tackles – eight of which were solo tackles – two sacks, an interception, and a fumble recovery.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Packers and Seahawks. Green Bay won both prior meetings, the most recent by a score of 42–20 in the 2007 NFC Divisional playoffs.\nAs it stands, this remains the last NFC Championship appearance for the Seahawks.\nAFC: New England Patriots 45, Indianapolis Colts 7.\nNew England blew out the Colts, massively outgaining them in total yards (397 to 209), first downs (28 to 17), and time of possession (37:49 to 22:11), while also forcing three turnovers and scoring touchdowns on their first four drives of the second half. This was the most lopsided AFC Championship Game victory since the Buffalo Bills defeated the Los Angeles Raiders 51–3 in the 1990 season.\nBoth teams had to punt on their first drive, but Colts returner Josh Cribbs muffed the kick and Patriots linebacker Darius Fleming recovered the ball on the Indianapolis 26-yard line. Five plays later, LeGarrette Blount scored on a 1-yard touchdown run to put the Patriots up 7–0. The Colts responded with a drive to the New England 33-yard line, but the drive stalled there and Adam Vinatieri missed a 51-yard field goal attempt. New England took over on their 41-yard line, and mounted an 8-play, 59-yard drive, including Tom Brady's 30-yard completion to running back Shane Vereen, to score on Brady's 1-yard pass to fullback James Develin.\nIn the second quarter, New England threatened to score again with a drive to the Colts' 26-yard line, but this time they came up empty when Brady threw a pass that was intercepted by linebacker D'Qwell Jackson. Andrew Luck then led the Colts 93 yards in 10 plays, featuring a 36-yard completion to T. Y. Hilton on the right sideline, on a drive that ended with a 1-yard touchdown run by Zurlon Tipton, cutting their deficit to 14–7. New England responded with a 15-play drive to score on Stephen Gostkowski's 21-yard field goal, putting them up 17–7 with nine seconds left in the half.\nIn the second half, New England completely dominated the game. On their opening drive, Brady completed a 23-yard pass to receiver Julian Edelman and Blount ripped off a 22-yard run as the team drove 87 yards to score on Brady's 16-yard touchdown pass to tackle Nate Solder, who had checked in as an eligible receiver for a third and 1 situation. After forcing the Colts to punt, Brady completed a 22-yard pass to Edelman, and eventually finished the drive with a 5-yard touchdown toss to tight end Rob Gronkowski. On the Colts' next drive, Luck was intercepted by cornerback Darrelle Revis, who returned the ball 30 yards to the Colts' 13-yard line, and Blount ran the ball into the end zone on the next play. Indianapolis had to punt on their next possession, and Edelman returned the ball 45 yards to the Colts' 45-yard line, setting up Blount's 2-yard touchdown run with 10:05 left in the game. The Colts' final three drives after this would result in an interception by Patriots linebacker Jamie Collins, a punt, and time expiring in the game.\nBrady threw for 226 yards and three touchdowns, with an interception, while Blount rushed for 148 yards and three touchdowns. Edelman was the top receiver of the game with nine receptions for 98 yards, a 12-yard carry, and returned three punts for 71 yards. Luck finished the game 12-for-33 for 126 yards.\nThis game marked another round of milestones for several members of the Patriots. Brady surpassed John Elway for the most Super Bowl appearances ever by a quarterback (6), and tied Mike Lodish for the most by any player. New England coach Bill Belichick tied Don Shula for the most Super Bowls ever reached (6) and set a new record for most postseason wins (21). Blount set new franchise playoff records for carries in a game (30) and career rushing touchdowns (7). For the Colts, Vinatieri set a new NFL record for most postseason games played (30), surpassing the old record of 29 set by Jerry Rice.\nAfter the game, claims emerged that the Patriots had used under-inflated footballs. The results of the NFL's investigation, and possible sanctions against the Patriots, concluded with Brady's four-game suspension and the Patriots forfeiting their first and fourth round draft picks in the 2016 and 2017 NFL Drafts, respectively.\nThis was the fifth postseason meeting between the Colts and Patriots, and meeting for the second consecutive year. The home had won the previous four meetings, of which New England has won three of the prior four, including 43–22 in the 2013 AFC Divisional playoffs.\nSuper Bowl XLIX: New England Patriots 28, Seattle Seahawks 24.\nThis was the first Super Bowl meeting between the Patriots and Seahawks."

        "text": "The Australian middleweight boxing championship is a title administrated by the Australian National Boxing Federation. The current Australian middleweight champion is Issac Hardman.\nRecognition.\nIn 1886 a boxing match between Jack Donohue and Alf Pickering at Foley's Gymnasium in Sydney was promoted as being for the middleweight champion of Australia, however the winner was not referred to as the middleweight champion after the fight and neither boxer was ever promoted as defending the title. Billy McCarthy was being referred to as middleweight champion of Australia as of 1886 however his matches were not promoted as though it was an official title which was on the line.\nIn January 1889 a bout between Bob Fitzsimmons and Jim Hall at Foley's Gymnasium in Sydney was promoted as being for the middleweight championship, however again no champion was announced after the fight which was won by Fitzsimmons. In October 1889 another match involving Jim Hall, this time against Jim Fogarty, was promoted as a match for the middleweight championship again, and it was also referred to as a championship match after the result, although because it was a draw there was still no champion named.\nDespite not winning a 'championship match' Jim Hall had adopted the title of champion middleweight of New South Wales as of 1890 due to a string of strong performances and contenders declining to fight him. In January 1890 Peter Boland, who claimed to be champion middleweight of Victoria, challenged him to a fight and they fought that month with Hall winning, which resulted in him being acknowledged as middleweight champion of Australia by the press. Hall's next match was also referred to as a match for the middleweight championship of Australia, and promotion described Jim Hall as the countries best middleweight, reflecting that it was a title defence. Promotion for a boxing match between Dan Creedon and Mick Dunn in 1892 described it as being for the middle-weight championship for Australia, due to Creedon being the best middle-weight in Victoria and Dunn being the best middle-weight in New South Wales, and argued that the title had never been clearly defined prior.\nIn 1924 the company Stadiums Limited attempted to assume responsibility for the title, organizing a match for the championship after Alf Stewart refused to box for six months, however the decision was not universally acknowledged and the media still regarded Stewart as reigning champion when he returned to the ring.\nRecognition of the champion became contentious in the early 1940s when champion Hockey Bennell lost a welterweight championship fight to Vic Patrick. Leichhardt Stadium management argued that the title reverted to previous title-holder Tommy Colteaux, and he was generally accepted as champion in Sydney, however Stadiums Limited grew frustrated with Colteaux refusing to accept matches and decided to reject his claim and hold a tournament to determine their own champion putting forward Alan Westbury in January, 1945. By February Westbury was generally regarded as the legitimate champion by fans, and when Hockey Bennell beat the Leichhardt 'champion' in March 1945 he was aiming to earn a fight against Westbury to become the middleweight champion, reflecting that Stadiums Limited had assumed responsibility for the title.\nThe title has been formally administered by the Australian National Boxing Federation (previously the Australian Boxing Federation) since 1965.\nList.\nr – Champion relinquished title.\ns – Champion stripped of title.\n\"Italics date\" – Reign disputed.\nExternal links.\n "

He played a little football at the South African College in 1899. He was an amateur boxer, having won the heavyweight championship of the Western Province.\nCareer.\nHe did not start playing the game again till 1903. He was badly wounded during the Boer war, and, on returning to Cape Town to convalesce, his recreations were walking, mountain climbing and shooting. These exercises gave him stamina and strength for Rugby football.\nIn 1903 he started in the second string of the Gardens, but joined the first later that season. In 1904-6 he steadily improved, till in the last season he was recognised as one of the best forwards in the Western Province. He was selected for the Western Province in the Currie Cup Tournament at Johannesburg. His omission from the original list of those selected caused some surprise, but Bertie Mosenthal's inability to make the trip gave him a place as first reserve."

        "text": "The Skeleton Crew: How Amateur Sleuths Are Solving America's Coldest Cases is a 2014 non-fiction work that was written by Deborah Halber. It was first published on 1 July 2014 by Simon &amp; Schuster and details the phenomenon of citizens creating and using Internet resources to identify unidentified human remains.\nIn the book, Halber gives firsthand accounts of her interactions with amateur web sleuths, the background of websites such as the Doe Network and an exploration of the issue of the unidentified in the American medicolegal system. She discusses the history of the science of identification and the use of the Internet for forensic crowdsourcing.\nSynopsis.\nThe book covers the following topics:\nInspiration.\nIn an interview on NPR's \"On the Media\", Halber told the host Brooke Gladstone that her interest in the subject was sparked suddenly. Halber said, \"I came across a photo in the Boston Globe — I think it was 2010 — and this woman was just really stunning — sort of auburn hair and these really beautiful eyes and this kind of Mona Lisa smile — and then I realized this wasn't a photograph. It was a reconstruction of a woman who had been brutally murdered in Provincetown, Massachusetts in 1974. And they still didn't know who she was. I ran to my computer and started Googling, and I realized that hers was far from an isolated case. That there were, by one estimate, 40,000 sets of human remains scattered around the country, literally stowed in the back rooms of morgues, bones in cardboard boxes, people who had been buried in potters fields. And this struck me as an enormous case of national neglect.\"\nReception.\nCritical reception for \"The Skeleton Crew\" has been positive, and \"Discover\" listed it as one of the \"best reads for July and August\" in 2014. The \"Wall Street Journal\" and \"Boston Globe\" both praised the work, and the \"Wall Street Journal\" remarked that Halber \"superbly reports\" on the new subculture of \"armchair detectives\". \"Maclean's\" noted that Halber covered the early days of amateur web sleuthing and that \"her bang-on descriptions and recondite details are riveting\"."

He made his major league debut on September 29, 2015. In 2016, López began the season with the Colorado Springs Sky Sox of the Triple–A Pacific Coast League, but struggled, pitching to a 6.81 ERA in 17 games started. He was demoted to Biloxi.

In the ninth inning, López surrendered a leadoff walk to Max Kepler and a hit to Robbie Grossman before walking off the mound at Target Field to a standing ovation. He became the first pitcher in Royals history to bring a perfect game into the ninth inning, besting Bret Saberhagen's seven-inning attempt vs. the Seattle Mariners. He was designated for assignment on August 7, 2020.\nBaltimore Orioles.\nOn August 9, 2020, the Baltimore Orioles claimed López off of waivers. López ended the 2020 season with a 6.69 ERA and 28 strikeouts to partner with a 2–2 record over 10 appearances.

        "text": "The National Basketball Development League (NBDL) was a professional basketball league based in Japan. It was a second-tier league below the National Basketball League and was formed in 2013 as the successor of JBL2, the second division of the former Japan Basketball League. After three seasons the league merged with the National Basketball League and its rival the bj-league to form the B.League.\nHistory.\nIn 2012 the Japan Basketball Association announced that it was rebranding the Japan Basketball League to the National Basketball League, to commence in the 2013-14 season. At the same time, it was announced that the second division of the JBL would be called the National Basketball Development League. The league commenced in October 2013 with eight of the twelve teams that competed in JBL2 the previous season and Tokyo Excellence, a newly formed team. The other four teams that made up the 12-team JBL2 league did not join the NBDL, with Daytrick Tsukuba and the Hyogo Storks earning promotion to the NBL while the joined a Kanto corporate league. The sought entry into the NBDL but were denied due to not satisfying the league's capital requirements; the club subsequently announced it would fold at the close of the final JBL2 season. Three of the NBDL's teams, the Excellence, Toyota Tsusho Fighting Eagles and Renova Kagoshima received associate membership to the NBL, which granted them the possibility of future promotion to the top league. The Fighting Eagles (30-2) finished on top of the standings in the first season of the league, but were defeated by second-placed Tokyo Excellence (29-3) in the championship match. \nA team from Miyazaki Prefecture was to join the NBDL for the 2014-15 season to provide an even number of teams in the league, but withdrew in November 2013. TGI D-Rise, the development club of the NBL's Link Tochigi Brex, relocated to Yamagata Prefecture before the start of the season and was renamed as the Passlab Yamagata Wyverns. The Tokyo-based withdrew to compete in the Kanto corporate league and transferred their NBDL membership to the newly-formed Earth Friends Tokyo Z. The result of the changes was that the second season of the league was again contested by nine teams. The Fighting Eagles again finished the regular season in first place with a 30-2 win–loss record, but fell to the Aisin AW Areions in the semi-final. Second-placed Excellence defeated the Areions in the final to claim their second consecutive championship.\nDuring the 2015 off-season the merger of the three professional leagues and formation of the B.League was announced, with the NBDL teams placed in the second and third divisions of the new competition. The final season of the NBDL saw the Tokyo Hachioji Trains join as an expansion club, taking the league to ten teams. The Fighting Eagles finished on top of the regular season standings for a third consecutive year with a 32-4 record. However, the third-placed Excellence again prevailed in the playoffs, defeating the second-placed Otsuka Alphas in the semi-final before overcoming the Fighting Eagles 89-70 in the final.\nFormat.\nThe teams competing in the NBDL were grouped in a single standings table. In the first season, teams played four matches against each other team in the league for a 32-game season, with the four highest-placed teams advancing to the semi-finals. With the addition of a tenth team in 2015, the season increased to 36 games."

It took place from March 3 through March 8, 2015 on campus sites with the higher-seeded school hosting each game throughout the championship. The North Florida Ospreys won their first Atlantic Sun Tournament championship, earning an automatic bid to the 2015 NCAA tournament.\nFormat.\nThe A-Sun Championship was a six-day single-elimination tournament. Eight teams competed in the championship. On July 22, 2014, the A-Sun announced Northern Kentucky will be eligible for all conference postseason championships for which their teams qualify starting with the upcoming 2014-15 academic year, as part of their transition to Division I from Division II. The Norse must still complete the four-year reclassification period before becoming eligible for NCAA Championships. The change in A-Sun policy arose after NCAA clarification that a conference may set specific criteria allowing its highest ranked finisher to be the AQ recipient if a non-eligible team were to participate and win the conference postseason tournament. Prior policy had determined that the conference would lose its AQ if an ineligible team won the tournament. However, that potential scenario did not happen, as the Norse lost their first-round game to Lipscomb by a score of 76-73. This proved to be Northern Kentucky's only A-Sun tournament game ever, as the school would move to the Horizon League effective with the 2015–16 school year.\nEast Tennessee State, along with defending champion Mercer, did not participate in the tournament after moving to the Southern Conference.\nWith ETSU and Mercer no longer in the A-Sun and FGCU eliminated in the semifinals, the tournament winner of the championship game between USC Upstate and North Florida was assured of making their first appearance in the NCAA Tournament. North Florida would represent the A-Sun with a 63–57 win."

        "text": "The 2014 Breeders' Cup World Championships was the 31st edition of the premier event of the North American thoroughbred horse racing year. It took place on October 31 and November 1 at Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, California. The Breeders' Cup is generally regarded as the end of the North American racing season, although a few Grade I events take place in later November and December. The 2014 Breeders' Cup results were highly influential in the Eclipse Award divisional championship voting.\nBreeders' Cup Challenge series.\nThe Breeders' Cup Challenge is a series of races that provide the winners of designated races with automatic \"Win and You're In\" berths in a specified division of the Breeders' Cup. For qualifying horses, the Breeders' Cup organization covers the entry fee and provides a travel allowance of up to $40,000 for the connections of horses from overseas. In 2014, thirty-seven horses entered in the Breeders' Cup races qualified via the challenge series, including four of the winners. These were:\nThe 2014 Breeders' Cup races were missing several prominent horses due to injury or illness. Most notably, American Pharoah, favored in the Juvenile after winning the FrontRunner Stakes, missed the race due to a bruise to the left front hoof. Similarly, Wise Dan, two-time winner of the Mile, qualified for the third time by winning the Shadwell Turf Mile but suffered a non-displaced fracture in his right foreleg. Beholder qualified in the Zenyatta but came down with an illness and missed the chance to defend her Distaff title.\nResults.\nThe two-day attendance for the 2014 Breeders' Cup was 98,319, up 4% over the 2013 attendance and the highest total for the renewals held at Santa Anita since the event expanded to two days. A total of $159.1 million was bet over the two days, the fourth highest in Breeders' Cup history and up 1.1% from 2013. 159 horses started in the 13 races, including 26 from overseas.\nThe Breeders' Cup Classic became the subject of great controversy when the eventual winner, Bayern, broke rapidly from the gate and \"took a hard left turn\" toward the rail, bumping the favorite Shared Belief in the process. Knocked off stride, Shared Belief in turn stumbled into Moreno, who had been expected to challenge Bayern for the early lead: Moreno lost his footing and never challenged. Bayern got an uncontested lead and was able to relax while setting a reasonable pace. For most of the race, he was followed by Toast of New York, who had also bumped into both Shared Belief and Moreno while moving into position. California Chrome was not involved in the contact, racing on the outside behind the early leaders. He started to close as they entered the stretch but could not get by: Bayern won by a nose over Toast of New York with California Chrome a neck back. Shared Belief closed ground late to finish fourth. After a 10-minute inquiry, the stewards decided to let the results stand, explaining later that the rules in California made the decision subjective, requiring them to determine if the foul affected the result of the race. \"We all agreed there was interference, no question, Bayern broke in. Three or four horses suffered interference,\" said steward Scott Chaney. \"Did it change the outcome? Any interference could. At the start of a mile-and-a-quarter race we're really loathe to make a change. You really don't want us handicapping the race.\" Many still disagreed with the decision. Shared Belief's part-owner, Jim Rome said, \"The message is pretty much that you can commit a foul at the beginning of a race. But that can be extremely dangerous to horse and jockey.\" The controversy overshadowed the performances of the top finishers, who ran the -mile race in 1:59.88.\nThe other races provided several other highlights. Main Sequence remained undefeated since moving from Europe to North America by winning the Turf, his fourth straight Grade I win. Karakontie became the first Japanese-bred horse to win at the Breeders' Cup when he won the Mile by a length over Anodin, a full brother to three-time Mile winner Goldikova. In the Juvenile Turf, Bobby's Kitten was in last place with 200 yards remaining but closed rapidly to win in a photo finish. After Untapable won the Distaff, jockey Rosie Napravnik announced that she (Napravnik) was expecting a baby and would retire from racing after completing the Saturday card. And in the Juvenile Fillies, Take Charge Brandi provided the biggest upset of the weekend when she won at odds of 61-1.\nIn the 2014 Eclipse Award voting, seven of the eleven flat racing categories were awarded to horses who won at the Breeders' Cup: Take Charge Brandi (Champion Two-Year-Old Filly), Untapable (Champion Three-Year-Old Filly), Main Sequence (Champion Older Male and Champion Male Turf Horse), Work All Week (Champion Male Sprinter), Judy the Beauty (Champion Female Sprinter and Dayatthespa (Champion Female Turf Horse).\nFriday, October 31.\nThe winners for the Friday races were as follows:\nSaturday, November 1.\nThe winners for the Saturday races were as follows:"

        "title": "Peter Johnson (rugby union)",
        "text": "Peter George Johnson (13 September 1936 – 12 July 2016) was an Australian international rugby union player. He enjoyed a long state and international career throughout the 1960s and made 92 national appearances for his country. He captained the Australian side in five Test matches.\nEarly rugby.\nSchooled at Waverley Public in Sydney's east, Johnson gained entry to Sydney Boys High School and learnt his rugby from the former rugby league international Frank O'Rourke. He was selected in the GPS 2nd XV in his last year of high school. He started his senior rugby at the Eastern Suburbs club, then moved to Randwick and then played at Sydney Uni for a spell. Back at Randwick he deputised at hooker behind the first-grade rake Jim Brown who was also the Wallaby incumbent. Johnson was selected out of second-grade to trial for the 1957–58 Australia rugby union tour of Britain, Ireland and France but did not make the squad.\nRepresentative career.\nJohnson started featuring in representative sides from 1958 playing for South Harbour and for the Australian Barbarians against the visiting New Zealand Maori. That year he was selected in the squad for the 1958 Australia rugby union tour of New Zealand, he played in five matches but no Tests. Howell asserts that Johnson made an affable tourist, was witty and humorous and was welcomed in the rugby tour environment.\nIn 1959 Johnson appeared for New South Wales and then for Australia in two Test matches against the visiting British &amp; Irish Lions. In 1960 the All Blacks visited and he played against them for his state. The following year he met France in a Test match, then Fiji for three Tests and to follow he was selected on the Wallabies 1961 Australia rugby union tour of South Africa where he played in both Tests and two other tour matches.\nIn 1962 Johnson played in a New South Wales team which beat the visiting All Blacks and then in the first Test against those same visitors Johnson was honoured with selection as Australian captain when the New South Wales captain Jim Lenehan withdrew due to injury. On Lenehan's return for the 2nd Test he took the captaincy. Johnson played in that game, his tenth Test appearance for the Wallabies. Later that year the Wallabies undertook the 1962 Australia rugby union tour of New Zealand with John Thornett as squad captain. Johnson played in eight of the thirteen games including all three Test matches.\nJohnson was in a victorious Wallaby side in 1963 who beat England before he then was selected for the 1963 Australia rugby union tour of South Africa. He played in sixteen matches and in all four Tests was the dominant Australian forward and matched it with the Springboks' best. Howell quotes the rugby writer Phil Tressider: \"Peter Johnson showed once again that he is the outstanding hooker in international Union today...his all round forward play was so sound that he could have held down a test position simply as prop forward\". The following year he made his third tour to New Zealand on the 1964 Australia rugby union tour of New Zealand where he played in six of eight total matches including the three Tests, the 3rd an Australian victory.\nJohnson was capped in further Test appearances in 1965 against South Africa and the British &amp; Irish Lions who both visited and then in 1966 he was picked for the 1966–67 Australia rugby union tour of Britain, Ireland and France on which he played in all five Tests and sixteen other matches. He appeared in a domestic Test against Ireland in 1967 and then made his fourth visit to New Zealand for the 1967 75th anniversary Test match.\nJohnson returned to the national captaincy in 1968 being honoured with the leadership of the Wallabies in the 2nd Bledisloe Cup Test against the All Blacks in the June, in a victorious Test when the French visited in August and then in two Test matches on the 1968 Australia rugby union tour of British Isles. He made five further Test appearances (none as captain), one in 1970 when Scotland toured, two against the Springboks in 1970 and two Tests on the 1971 Australia rugby union tour of France. He played in six of the ten matches of that tour and was replaced in the 2nd Test against France which, at 34 years of age, marked the end of a remarkable representative career.\nRecords and accolades.\nAll told Johnson played 92 matches for his country between 1958 and 1971, with 42 of those being Test matches. It was a record number of appearances at the time. Johnson made eight Wallaby tours and played 215 first grade games for his Randwick club and 24 lower grade games. When the Randwick team of the century was chosen Johnson was selected as a hooker. He died of a heart attack on 12 July 2016. Later that year he was inducted into the Australian Rugby Hall of Fame."

Montenegro are currently in Conference 2 in Europe for rugby 7s having made their debut in 2014.\nHistory.\nPrior to 2003, Montenegro had been represented in international rugby matches as FR Yugoslavia, and as Serbia and Montenegro from 2003 until Montenegro's independence in 2006. Rugby began to develop in Montenegro from 2011. Participation numbers grew and the players progressed to rugby sevens. By 2013 there were four rugby clubs in Montenegro. A regional league began in 2014 and fixtures were also arranged with other teams around the former Yugoslavian countries, and by 2014 there were seven clubs.\nRugby has competition from other popular sports such as water-polo, soccer, handball and mixed martial arts in Montenegro. Due to the small population of the country, rugby 7s is popular due to the game requiring fewer players. An official international 7s squad was named and sent to Greece for the ENC Division B competition in 2014. This is the start of Montenegro rugby on the international stage.\nResults.\nThe national sevens team made its international debut in Greece in 2014. The first international was played against the favorites Switzerland with the game ending final score 15–36 to Switzerland. The team progressed to the Bowl play-offs and defeated San Marino by 45–7 and Liechtenstein by 38–5 in the final to win the 2014 ENC Division B Bowl. After the reformatting of the sevens system by rugby Europe the national team place in a new conference system (conference 2) in a group with favourites Malta, Estonia and Belarus. The national team made good progress and finished in the final (a first final for sevens rugby) of that tournament losing out to Malta in the final but securing promotion to conference 1 The team competing in the 2017 tournament in bulgaria had a poor set of results and just lost the few important matches in their battle to stay up in the conference.\nCurrent squad.\nNote: Flags indicate national union as has been defined under World Rugby eligibility rules. Players may hold more than one nationality. Rugby clubs are in brackets.\nCoach: Miodrag \"Bato\" Jović\nTeam manager: Zorica Kostić"

All three races paid half points to all classified finishers.\nAt Monza, the second race was red-flagged on Lap 14 of 19, with 2:20 remaining in the 35-minute race, as the Safety Car would have resulted in the race ending under caution because of multiple Safety Car periods caused by incidents. The excessive number of incidents during the race resulted in a warning by officials during the drivers' meeting of proper driver conduct before the start of the third race. A start crash involving Ryan Tveter and Fabian Schiller resulted in officials imposing an ultimatum that drivers be on their best behaviour or the race would be abandoned. On lap six Lance Stroll and Mikkel Jensen collided causing the race to be red-flagged three laps later. As a result, series organisers awarded half points to each of the classified finishers eligible to score points. Rosenqvist won all three of the Monza races, but expressed frustration with the driving standards on display.\nAt Spielberg, the third race ended due to early torrential rain.\n† — Drivers did not finish the race, but were classified as they completed over 90% of the race distance.\nTeams' championship.\nPrior to each round of the championship, two drivers from each team – if applicable – were nominated to score teams' championship points."

        "title": "1961 Major League Baseball expansion",
        "text": "The 1961 Major League Baseball expansion resulted in the formation of two new Major League Baseball (MLB) franchises in the American League (AL). A new club was started in Washington, D.C., and took the existing name of the Senators, as the previous team of the same name moved to Minnesota for the start of the 1961 season and became the Twins. The second new franchise was granted to an ownership group led by Gene Autry for a team in Los Angeles who named themselves the Angels. The two new teams each paid a fee of $2.1 million and became the 17th and 18th franchises in MLB.\nThe expansion was part of an initiative in response to the perceived threat of a proposed third major league, the Continental League. In 1962, the National League (NL) also added two new teams, the Houston Colt .45s (later renamed the Astros) and the New York Mets.\nBackground.\nFor a 50-year period from 1903 to 1952, MLB's 16-team structure remained intact. No franchises were relocated during this period, although five markets—Boston, Chicago, New York City, Philadelphia, and St. Louis—had two or more teams. According to authors Andy McCue and Eric Thompson, \"By 1953, ... Population had moved from the northeast quadrant to the vibrant cities of the West and South. The less financially successful clubs in two-team cities were finding it increasingly difficult to compete.\"\nThe situation changed as the Boston Braves moved to Milwaukee in 1953, the St. Louis Browns relocated to Baltimore one year later, and the Philadelphia Athletics went to Kansas City in 1955. Then, before the 1958 season, the two New York City teams in the NL moved to the West Coast—the Dodgers to Los Angeles, and the Giants to San Francisco. New York City sought a replacement NL franchise, and by December 1958 MLB had created an Expansion Committee. Despite the formation of the group, MLB displayed little intention of adding a New York team.\nThe relocation of the Dodgers and Giants led to a proposal for a third major league: the Continental League, which would have started by 1961 with franchises in markets MLB had previously ignored. In addition, MLB was facing pressure from the U.S. Congress, which indicated that efforts to prevent future expansion would arouse interest in weakening the sport's exemption from antitrust laws. Congress voted on a bill aimed at repealing the exemption, but it failed to pass. However, MLB moved to expand after a rival league became a possibility. The potential threat posed by the Continental League ended in August 1960, when the NL proposed expanding to include four of the new organization's clubs. The AL then became interested in the idea of expansion. Expansion Committee chairman Del Webb initially backed the addition of a Houston-based franchise, but the NL spoiled the idea when it announced the addition of teams in that city and New York for 1962.\nMarkets.\nFor many years, Los Angeles had been rumored to be a potential site for an AL franchise. At the time of the expansion, the Los Angeles area was the second-most populated in the U.S., and several sports teams had already moved into the city, including the NL's Dodgers. Actor Gene Autry led a group that paid $2.1 million for the right to place an MLB team in Los Angeles. Autry, who owned radio stations, had been seeking to acquire a contract to broadcast baseball games when he traveled to MLB's Winter Meetings. After the Meetings, on December 6, 1960, his group received franchise rights. The Los Angeles team was initially scheduled to begin play in 1962, but a relocation plan elsewhere in the AL resulted in the start date being moved up to 1961. The club was nicknamed the Angels, after a Pacific Coast League team that had previously played in the city. To secure the name rights, Autry paid a $350,000 fee to Dodgers owner Walter O'Malley, who had purchased the minor league Angels before relocating the Dodgers to Los Angeles.\nInitially, leading figures in Minneapolis–St. Paul, Minnesota, had sought an expansion franchise. However, Senators owner Calvin Griffith believed his team could not prosper in the capital city of Washington, D.C., and sought to relocate to Minnesota. The Senators had played in Washington, D.C., starting in 1901, and had won the 1924 World Series. Starting in the 1940s, however, the club had slipped towards the bottom of the AL standings for most seasons. In October 1960, the AL permitted the Senators to move in time for next year's season, and gave Washington, D.C., an expansion team. The former Senators changed their name to the Minnesota Twins, and the new expansion team took the Senators name. The decision was partially in response to pressure from Congress, which had wanted a replacement for the former Senators. As with the Angels' ownership group, the new Senators' owners paid a $2.1 million fee for the right to an MLB franchise. The two new teams became the 17th and 18th clubs in MLB. Furthermore, the American League season itself was expanded from 154 games per team to 162.\nExpansion draft.\nA draft was held on December 14, 1960, to stock the new teams with players from the existing AL clubs. All teams were required to make seven players draftable from their regular rosters, along with eight more from their expanded rosters of 40 players, with the number of players that could be selected from one franchise capped at seven. The Angels and Senators were limited to 28 picks each, and were forced to pay $75,000 per pick. There were also requirements to choose certain numbers of players for each position.\nThe Angels won the first overall pick in the expansion draft via coin toss and used it to select New York Yankees pitcher Eli Grba. The Senators followed by taking another Yankees pitcher, Bobby Shantz, with their first choice. Later in the draft, both teams violated the rules prohibiting existing clubs from losing more than seven players from their normal rosters; by the 43rd pick, the Cleveland Indians and Detroit Tigers had each seen eight of their players chosen, and another rule mandating that the Angels and Senators not take more than four players from any one team was also ignored. Angels manager Bill Rigney later said that the teams had not been notified about the rules by the AL.\nDespite an effort by AL president Joe Cronin that required both teams to relinquish earlier selections and choose different players, imbalances still existed in player selections; seven of the eight AL teams had had five or more players drafted by the Angels or Senators. In response, player trades between the expansion teams were mandated by Cronin. In the last of these trades, future Cy Young Award-winning pitcher Dean Chance was sent to the Angels by Washington.\nPerformance of expansion teams.\nIn 1961, Wrigley Field (not to be confused with the Chicago stadium of the same name), a former minor league stadium, served as the home of the Angels; for the next four seasons, they shared Dodger Stadium with the Dodgers. Los Angeles won 70 games in its first season, exceeding expectations. The following season, they held first place in the AL as late as July 4, ending the year with 86 victories. However, the team's performance declined in future years, as its strategy of acquiring \"recognizable names\" led to aging talent whose output fell before the Angels' minor league system could replace them.\nThe Senators experienced a lack of strong fan interest in their inaugural season, drawing under 600,000 fans for the year. The team annually posted about 90 defeats in most future years, and did not win more games than it lost until 1969, when Washington ended the season with an 86–76 win–loss record. The original owner of the club left early in the Senators' existence, and a second shift occurred shortly after stockbrokers James Johnson and James Lemon purchased the team from Elwood Quesada. In September 1971, then-owner Bob Short announced that the Senators would move to the Dallas area after the season; the team's last game in Washington was forfeited due to \"unruly behavior\" by Senators fans.\nAftermath.\nThe 1961 expansion was the first in a series of moves that resulted in MLB nearly doubling in size to 30 franchises. As part of MLB's effort to prevent the formation of the Continental League, the NL added the New York Mets and Houston Colt .45s (who later changed their nickname to the Astros) for the 1962 season. Another expansion draft was made to stock the new teams for the 1962 season. Four new clubs joined the AL and NL in 1969, in San Diego, Kansas City, Montreal, and Seattle (although the team moved to Milwaukee the following year). Further two-team expansions took place in 1977, 1993, and 1998. The expansions had the effect of placing MLB teams across the continent; before 1961, only four teams (the Dodgers, Giants, Kansas City Athletics, and St. Louis Cardinals) were based west of the Mississippi."

        "text": "The Iowa Hawkeyes field hockey team is the intercollegiate field hockey program representing the University of Iowa. The school competes in the Big Ten Conference in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The Iowa field hockey team plays its home games at Dr. Christine H.B. Grant Field on the university campus in Iowa City, Iowa. The Hawkeyes have won 16 conference championships (13 in the Big Ten), six Big Ten tournament titles, and the 1986 NCAA Championship, making it the first Midwestern university to win a national title. As of 2014, the team is coached by Lisa Cellucci.\nHistory.\nField hockey has been a varsity sport at the University of Iowa since 1973, before that field hockey was a club sport. Iowa was a leader in early implementation of the Title IX legislation, which was passed in 1972. Christine Grant, PhD, was coach in 1973 and 1974 before she retired from coaching to become Iowa women's athletics director and a national voice for women in sport. She was also president of the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) - which was the governing organization for women's intercollegiate athletics before the NCAA took over. From 1981 to 1989 and again since 1992, the Hawkeyes have been members of the Big Ten Conference, while they participated in the Midwestern Collegiate Field Hockey Conference (MCFHC) during the 1990 and 1991 seasons. Iowa is one of the most accomplished field hockey programs in the Big Ten, with 16 claimed conference championships (13 in the Big Ten), six conference tournament titles, and 11 NCAA Final Four appearances to its credit. In 1986, the Hawkeyes became the first field hockey team from the Midwest to win the national championship, when they beat New Hampshire 2–1 in double overtime in the NCAA title game. Additionally, Iowa has cumulatively amassed a total of 85 national All-Americans, 152 regional All-Americans, and 162 All-Conference selections. In program history, the Hawkeyes have had a total of only five head coaches: Margie Greenberg (1977), Judith Davidson (1978–87), Beth Beglin (1988–99), Tracey Griesbaum (2000–13), and Lisa Cellucci (2014–present). In addition to Cellucci, who is herself a former Iowa player, Hawkeye alumni have attained the position of head coach at numerous other NCAA programs, including Ball State (Annette Payne), Dartmouth (Amy Fowler), Indiana (Amy Robertson), Kent State (Kerry [Horgan] Devries), Michigan (Marcia Pankratz), Princeton (Kristen Holmes-Winn), Rutgers (Liz Tchou), Stanford (Lesley Irvine), and Virginia (Michele Madison and Missi Sanders).\nSeason-by-season results.\nIn 1973, five Hawkeyes were selected to play on the all-Iowa college team: Sue Lewis, Caroline Emrich, Sue Bouch, Liz Ullman, and Robyn Linn. The 1974 season, coached by Christine Grant, had a 1–6–4 record. Two Hawkeyes were selected to play on the State Field Hockey team: Liz Ullman and Sue Bouck. The 1975 team, coached by Margie Greenberg, had a 3–6–2 record. The 1976 team's record was 9–5–2. Three Hawkeyes advanced to the State Team that year: Carla Seltzer, Barb Resnick and Karen Zamora. Karen Zamora was then selected as a qualifier for the National Field Hockey Tournament.\n\"Season-by-season results through the end of the 2014 season\"\nAwards and accolades.\nNational championships.\nIowa has been well represented at the NCAA Championships, appearing 22 times with 11 Final Four appearances. In 1986, the Hawkeyes beat conference rivals Northwestern en route to the Final Four. There, they shut out Penn State 2–0 and topped New Hampshire 2–1 for their first national championship, becoming the first women's team at the university to win an NCAA Championship.\nConference championships.\nIowa has won 16 conference titles, 13 in the Big Ten Conference and three in the Midwest Collegiate Field Hockey Conference (MCFHC).\nOlympians.\n\"Awards and accolades through the end of the 2014 season\"\nStadium.\nIowa has played its home games at Dr. Christine H.B. Grant Field since its construction in 1989. Originally named Hawkeye Field Hockey Field, in 1991 the stadium was renamed in honor of Christine Grant, the founder of the Iowa field hockey program and former Women's Athletics director of the university. Grant Field was rededicated in 2006 after the completion of significant renovations that included a new playing surface, a permanent grandstand, new concession facilities, restrooms, and a press box. Described by former Michigan field hockey player and current Big Ten Network analyst Kara Lentz as \"the best facility in the Big Ten\", Grant Field has witnessed a 40-game Iowa home winning streak in addition to undefeated Hawkeyes home campaigns on six separate occasions. The stadium's official capacity is 1,000, while its all-time single-game attendance record stands at 1,339, which was set during a game against Penn State on October 24, 1993.\nTitle IX Activism.\nIn the wake of the firing of former University of Iowa Field Hockey Coach Tracey Griesbaum on August 4, 2014, current players Chandler Ackers and Natalie Cafone joined former players Jessy Silfer and Dani Hemeon in filing a Title IX complaint with the U.S. Department of Education. Coach Griesbaum was terminated after former players levied a series of allegations against her coaching methods and the culture within the field hockey program. Despite an internal investigation by the university determining that she had not violated any university policy, Griesbaum was fired just days before the start of the 2014 season.\nAt the heart of the complaint filed with the Office of Civil Rights (OCR), the agency responsible for overseeing Title IX compliance within the Department of Education, are allegations that the University of Iowa's Athletic Department engages in discriminatory practices and decision-making, often resulting in the removal of highly qualified female coaches from female programs. The student-athletes further allege that the removal of top female coaches deny to female athletes educational benefits protected under Title IX.\nAs provided by Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, \"[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, \"be denied the benefits of\", or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\" As a state institution of higher education, the University of Iowa is subject to the provisions of Title IX.\nWhile Title IX compliance issues are commonplace in collegiate athletics, and generally center on such things as equal opportunity to participate, and access to equal facilities, the complaint submitted by the University of Iowa Field Hockey players is unique in its interpretation of gender discrimination. The players contend that Coach Griesbaum was terminated for engaging in the same coaching methods and practices utilized by male coaches. The student-athletes go on to claim that by holding female coaches and student-athletes to different standards than their male counterparts – standards largely shaped by sex stereotypes – the school undermines the success of women's programs, and denies female student-athletes the opportunity to learn from top coaches, and compete at the highest level.\nMany of the practices and standards challenged in the complaint are rooted in a paternalistic view of women's athletics. The Title IX complaint cites numerous examples of double standards that exist within the University of Iowa's Athletic Department. For instance, the student-athletes note that the university places a higher level of expectation on female coaches of women's programs to manage players' minor injuries and emotional sensitivities. The complaint alleges a pattern of negative consequences for women coaches for failure to adequately respond to complaints from parents and players.\nConversely, the university is more likely to give male coaches the benefit of the doubt when faced with accusations of wrongdoing. For example, thirteen football players were hospitalized with rhabodomyolysis, a stress-induced degenerative muscle syndrome, after an arduous off-season workout in 2011. Despite the very serious physical injuries facing these football players, the University of Iowa stood by the coach involved in the incident, and he was later named \"Assistant Coach of the Year.\"\nSome feminist commentators suggest that the current model of sport is designed for men's interests, and that women's athletic pursuits are less competitive, and more recreational. Advocates of this position would acknowledge real differences between men and women, and construct an athletic system that creates substantive equality between the sexes. Under this view of gender equity, one might be able to argue that different coaching methods are necessary to provide both male and female athletes with similarly positive collegiate athletic experiences.\nHowever, this Title IX complaint filed with the OCR is based on a formal equality approach to gender equity. The University of Iowa Field Hockey student-athletes' allegations are remarkable because it challenges assumptions that would hold female and male student-athletes and coaches to varying levels of competitiveness and standards of behavior. As Ackers and Cafone have made clear, one major draw for many athletes to the University of Iowa Field Hockey program was the opportunity to play under Coach Griesbaum, and be pushed every day to reach their personal and athletic potential. The student-athletes agree, \"we want to be made better every single day\" and \"we don't want to be coddled like little girls.\" The complaint's premise confronts stereotypes that greatly shape expectations for male and female student-athletes and coaches in college sports.\nFor their efforts on behalf of gender equality, Ackers, Cafone, Silfer, and Hemeon received the Jean Y. Jew Women's Rights Award. The complaint has sparked a national conversation on double standards that exist for female coaches and student-athletes in collegiate athletics. Although not directly tied to the complaint filed by Ackers, Cafone, Silfer, and Hemeon, the OCR began an audit of the University of Iowa Athletic Department in response allegations of unfair treatment of female student-athletes on April 11, 2016."

Before the Nittany Lions field hockey team moved to the complex in 2005, it had previously played at four other venues: Pollock Field (1964–75), Lady Lion Field (1976–88), Holuba Hall (1989–95), and Bigler Field (1996–2004)."

        "text": "The Rutgers Scarlet Knights field hockey team is the intercollegiate field hockey program representing Rutgers University – New Brunswick, the main campus of Rutgers University. The school competes in the Big Ten Conference in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), although it was previously a member of the Atlantic 10 Conference (A-10), the original Big East Conference, and the new Big East Conference. The Rutgers field hockey team plays its home games at the Bauer Track and Field/Field Hockey Complex on the university's Livingston Campus in Piscataway, New Jersey. Since the field hockey program was established in 1974, the Scarlet Knights have appeared in the NCAA tournament twice, placed runner-up in regular-season conference play three times, and finished second in a conference tournament twice. The team is currently coached by Meredith Civico.\nHistory.\nField hockey has been a varsity sport at Rutgers University since 1974. Between 1988 and 1994, the Scarlet Knights competed in the Atlantic 10 Conference (A-10), while from 1995 to 2012 they were a member of the original Big East Conference, and in 2013 they played field hockey as an associate member of the new Big East Conference. Beginning with the 2014 season, Rutgers (along with Maryland) has joined the Big Ten Conference, expanding it to nine field hockey members. The team has twice appeared in the NCAA tournament, in 1984 and 1986, playing a total of four games. In 1984, Rutgers defeated Penn State in the first round before losing to Temple in the quarterfinals, while in 1986 it beat Pennsylvania in the first round before being eliminated by North Carolina in the quarterfinals. The Scarlet Knights' best regular-season conference performance has been second place, which it has accomplished three times, in 1993 as a member of the A-10, and in 1995 and 2000 as a member of the Big East. Rutgers has also made two appearances in conference tournament championship games, in the 1993 A-10 tournament and in the 1995 Big East tournament. In 1993, the Scarlet Knights lost the title game to Massachusetts, while in 1995 they were defeated by Syracuse.\nSeason-by-season results.\n\"Season-by-season results through the end of the 2014 season\"\nAwards and accolades.\nAll-Americans.\n\"Individual honors through the end of the 2014 season\"\nStadium.\nRutgers has played its home games at the Bauer Track and Field/Field Hockey Complex since 2009. Dedicated in April 1996, the Bauer Track and Field complex was originally designed specifically for track and field. The complex is located on the university's Livingston Campus adjacent to the Louis Brown Athletic Center (formerly the Rutgers Athletic Center), which is the home of the Rutgers men's and women's basketball teams. The Bauer Track and Field complex has also played host to the Big East Conference Outdoor Track and Field Championships in 2004 and 2005. In 2009, the inner oval of the complex was adapted for field hockey play in preparation for use by the Scarlet Knights field hockey team. Among the adaptations to the complex was the installation of an AstroTurf 12 playing surface, which was chosen by Rutgers due to its playability, durability, and low maintenance costs."

A second five-eighth and wing, Taylor represented Bay of Plenty and Hawke's Bay at a provincial level, and was a member of the New Zealand national side, the All Blacks, between 1976 and 1982. His career in New Zealand was relatively short, playing 72 first-class domestic matches and 27 matches for New Zealand, including nine internationals.\nTaylor also played in England for Wasps in the late 1970s and early 1980s, captaining the club in the 1980–81, 1981-82 and 1982–83 seasons, although he was ruled out of the final season by injury. In his first season as captain the Rothmans Rugby Yearbook stated that his \"outspoken captaincy paid dividends for Wasps, who had their best season for twenty years\". Taylor also played for the Middlesex county team and helped them reach the semi-final of the 1981-82 County Championship."

        "text": "In cricket, a five-wicket haul (also known as a \"five–for\" or \"fifer\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement, and as of August 2014 only 23 bowlers have taken at least 20 five-wicket hauls at international level in their cricketing careers.\nClarence Victor \"Clarrie\" Grimmett (25 December 1891 – 2 May 1980), a leg spinner and right-hand batsman, was born in New Zealand though he played the bulk of his cricket in Australia. He is thought by many to be one of the finest early spin bowlers, and is usually credited as the developer of the flipper. Grimmett made his first-class debut for Wellington at the age of 17. At that time, New Zealand was not a Test cricketing nation, and in 1914 he moved to neighbouring Australia to further his career.\nGrimmett played 37 Tests between 1924 and 1936, taking 216 wickets at an average of just 24.21 runs apiece. He took a five-wicket haul on debut against England in Sydney in 1925. He became the first bowler to reach the milestone of taking 200 Test wickets, and is one of only four Test bowlers that played in their first Test after the age of thirty to take more than 100 wickets, the other three beings Dilip Doshi, Saeed Ajmal and Ryan Harris. He took an average of six wickets per match. Many wickets in the last four years of his Test career were taken bowling in tandem with fellow leg-spinner Bill O'Reilly. Grimmett remains the only bowler with career figures of over 200 wickets in fewer than 40 Tests. He took a five-wicket 'bag' on 21 occasions, seven times finishing with ten wickets or more in a match.\nGrimmett was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1931, the same year as Donald Bradman. He died in Adelaide in 1980, and was posthumously inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 1996 as one of the ten inaugural members.\nOn 30 September 2009, Clarrie Grimmett was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.\nTest ten-wicket hauls.\nClarrie Grimmett took ten wickets in a Test Match on seven occasions, and sits equal fifth on the all-time Test bowling table for \"Most ten-wickets-in-a-match\". Among Australian bowlers he sits equal second (with Dennis Lillee) behind Shane Warne who took ten wickets in a Test in ten matches."

After a stint in the Army, he went to work for the Ford Motor Corporation. Upon being laid off, he returned to college, attending Moberly Area Community College on a basketball scholarship. During the 1954–55 season, Murrell was a second-team NJCAA All-American and led Moberly to the NJCAA national title and was named to the all-tournament team.\nFollowing his season at Moberly, Murrell transferred to Drake. In his three varsity seasons, Murrell scored 1,657 points for his career (22.7 points per game), leaving as the school's all-time leading scorer – a record that stood until 2010. He was drafted by the Cincinnati Royals after his junior season, but opted to return to Drake for the 1957–58 season. That year Murrell set another school scoring mark, averaging 26.7 points per game, fifth in the nation. He was named an honorable mention All-American by the Associated Press and was a first-team All-Missouri Valley Conference choice.

Governments grants provided some financial assistance to return the course to full playing capability. In the later part of 2014 the Queensland Government provided a grant to restore a section of Enoggera Creek that flows through the course. This work was completed in October 2014.\nThe course.\nThe layout is challenging for both members and professionals. The club has hosted events on the Sunshine Tour and the trainee program."

That one dollar note is now displayed in the foyer of the clubhouse.

        "text": "Kevan Alan Smith (born June 28, 1988) is an American former professional baseball catcher. He has previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Chicago White Sox, Los Angeles Angels, Tampa Bay Rays, and Atlanta Braves. Prior to playing professionally, Smith attended the University of Pittsburgh, where he played for the Pittsburgh Panthers baseball and football teams. The White Sox selected Smith in the seventh round of the 2011 Major League Baseball draft. He made his MLB debut in 2016.\nAmateur career.\nSmith attended Seneca Valley High School in Harmony, Pennsylvania, graduating in 2006. During his high school career, he played for the school's American football team as a quarterback, but was limited to only 12 games.\nSmith enrolled at the University of Pittsburgh and played for the Pittsburgh Panthers football team. He redshirted during his first year at Pittsburgh, in 2006, and became the Panthers' starting quarterback in 2007 following an injury to Bill Stull. He lost his starting role to Pat Bostick, a freshman, after struggling in a 2007 game against the Michigan State Spartans. He appeared in five games during the 2007 season, and one game during the 2008 season.\nAfter the 2008 season, coach Dave Wannstedt and offensive coordinator Matt Cavanaugh approached Smith about changing positions. As Smith had increased his weight training, they considered moving him to outside linebacker or tight end. He instead opted to quit football so that he could play for the Pittsburgh Panthers baseball team. For the baseball team, Smith had a .375 batting average, 19 home runs and 123 runs batted in (RBIs) in his three seasons. He was twice named an All-Big East Conference selection and twice named to the All-Tournament Team in the Big East Conference baseball tournament.\nProfessional career.\nChicago White Sox.\nThe Chicago White Sox selected Smith in the seventh round of the 2011 Major League Baseball draft. He began his career with the Bristol White Sox of the Rookie-level Appalachian League. He was promoted mid season to the Great Falls Voyagers of the Rookie-level Pioneer League. He began the 2012 season with the Kannapolis Intimidators of the Class A South Atlantic League. Towards the end of the season, Smith was promoted to the Winston Salem Dash of the Class A-Advanced Carolina League. In 2013, Smith played the whole season for Winston-Salem.\nIn 2014, Smith played for the Birmingham Barons of the Class AA Southern League. He hit .290 with 10 home runs and 48 RBIs in 106 games for Birmingham, and threw out 33 percent of baserunners attempting stolen bases. After the 2014 season, the White Sox assigned Smith to the Glendale Desert Dogs of the Arizona Fall League. On November 20, 2014, the White Sox added Smith to their 40-man roster. Smith spent the 2015 season with the Charlotte Knights of the Class AAA International League, and began 2016 in Charlotte.\nWith Alex Avila going on the disabled list, the White Sox promoted Smith to the major leagues on April 24, 2016. Smith was scratched from the lineup on April 25 with back spasms, and the White Sox put Smith on the disabled list due to sacroiliac joint dysfunction the next day. On May 22, 2016, he was activated from the 15-day disabled list and returned to Charlotte. One game after his activation with the Knights, he went back on the disabled list. The White Sox promoted Smith to the major leagues on September 1, and he made his major league debut that day. He recorded his first two major league hits on September 17. On February 10, 2017, Smith cleared waivers and was outrighted to Charlotte.\nSmith began the 2017 season with Charlotte, and was promoted to the major leagues on April 13. In 2017 with the White Sox he batted .283/.309/.388 with 4 home runs and 30 RBIs in 273 at bats.\nIn 2018 with the White Sox he batted .292/.348/.380 with 3 home runs and 21 RBIs in 171 at bats.\nLos Angeles Angels.\nOn October 26, 2018, Smith was claimed off waivers by the Los Angeles Angels. Smith played in 67 games for the Angels in 2019, batting .251/.318/.393 with 5 home runs and 20 RBI. On December 2, 2019, Smith was non-tendered by the Angels and became a free agent.\nTampa Bay Rays.\nOn January 11, 2020, Smith signed a minor league deal with the Tampa Bay Rays. Smith was promoted to the Rays' major league roster on July 21, 2020, after Colin Poche was placed on the injured list following a torn UCL. He was designated for assignment on August 9, and was outrighted by the Rays on August 12. On August 29, 2020, Smith was selected back to the active roster. On October 30, 2020, Smith was outrighted off of the 40-man roster and elected free agency. \nOn December 29, 2020, Smith re-signed with the Rays on a minor league contract. On May 7, 2021, Smith was selected to the active roster. Smith notched 1 hit in 5 plate appearances before being designated for assignment by the Rays on May 16.\nAtlanta Braves.\nOn May 19, 2021, Smith was traded to the Atlanta Braves in exchange for cash considerations. On August 11, the Braves designated Smith for assignment to make room for Travis d'Arnaud. Smith elected free agency on August 13."

In 1922 the club affiliated to Uruguayan Golf Association. The Golf Club also entrusted the association its courses to be built in Punta Carretas with the purpose of encouraging tourism at the region.\nThe golf course is located on the Rambla of Montevideo that runs alongside the Río de la Plata. It was designed by Alister MacKenzie and has 18 holes and 6,635 yards. It is officially known as the Parque de las Instrucciones del Año XIII, and is open to public on Sunday afternoons, except in winter and during international tournaments. In 1975 it was declared an historical national monument.\nThe course was inaugurated on May 25, 1934 before starting the 2nd edition of Torneo Abierto de Montevideo. It held the Copa Los Andes, among other South American championship. In 2013 and 2014, the Roberto De Vicenzo Invitational Copa NEC, a professional tournament on PGA Tour Latinoamérica, was played at Club de Golf. The club also has an own publication, \"Golf Magazine\" that covers all the social and sports activities and corporate events organized by Club de Golf.\nThe rugby union team of the club, nicknamed \"\"Los Cuervos\" (The Crows)\" due to its black uniform, was formed in 1959 and currently competes in Campeonato Uruguayo, the first division of Uruguayan rugby system.\nIn 2018, a field hockey section (also with black kit and nicknamed \"Cuervos\" like the rugby team) was added to the club."

O'Brien is mostly known as an enforcer.\nPlaying career.\nO'Brien was drafted in the first round, 10th overall, by the Rimouski Oceanic in the 2010 Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) Draft. He scored his first QMJHL goal in his second game, against the Lewiston Maineiacs. He played for the Oceanic until 2011, when he was traded to the Rouyn-Noranda Huskies for draft picks.\nPassed over in the NHL Entry Draft, O'Brien received a training camp invite from the Washington Capitals in 2014, and made the team, signing a three-year entry level contract on October 6, 2014. He made his NHL debut on October 9, 2014 in a game against the Montreal Canadiens, in which he registered his first NHL fight against the Canadiens' Brandon Prust.\nOn June 10, 2019, O'Brien agreed to return for his sixth season within the Capitals organization, agreeing to a one-year, two-way contract extension. O'Brien was waived by the Washington Capitals on September 30, 2019 and loaned to the Hershey Bears the following day.\nOn the completion of his sixth year with the Bears, O'Brien left the Capitals organization as a free agent. With the COVID-19 pandemic delaying the following North American season, O'Brien was belatedly signed to an American Hockey League (AHL) contract with the Colorado Eagles, primary affiliate to the Colorado Avalanche, on November 27, 2020.

        "title": "Richmond Cricket Club (18th century)",
        "text": "Richmond Cricket Club was based in Richmond (historically part of Surrey and now in London) and was a leading club during the 18th century. Its home venue was at Richmond Green. It ceased to exist sometime after 1805. The current Richmond club, which plays in the Middlesex County Cricket League, was founded in 1862.\nRichmond is first recorded as a team in July 1720. In June 1736, two of its players challenged a London duo in a single wicket contest. The two Richmond players were unnamed in the newspaper report but were nevertheless \"esteemed the best two in England\".\nIn 1740, a combined Richmond and Moulsey team played two matches against London. The first was incomplete due to rain and the second was won by London. In 1742, Richmond played London at the Artillery Ground in Finsbury \"for a considerable sum\" but the result is unknown.\nThe poet James Love, well known in cricket circles for his \"Cricket: An Heroic Poem\" (1744), was a playing member of the Richmond club but probably the greatest ever Richmond player was his teammate, the innkeeper William Sawyer. He had by this time established himself as \"one of the best six players in England\" and was a regular choice for big single wicket contests such as the one in 1743 between Three of Kent and Three of All-England. In the same year, there were two more single wicket contests between Five of Richmond and Five of London, one game on Richmond Green and the return at the Artillery Ground. In July 1743, Richmond twice played London and were beaten each time.\nRichmond played London on Kennington Common in July 1744 but the result is unknown. Richmond declined in the latter half of the 1740s as there are no further references to the club apart from one match in 1749 when a Richmond &amp; Ripley XI played London at the Artillery Ground, but again the result is unknown.\nThe club continued to play inter-parish matches until the end of the 18th century and saw something of a revival between 1799 and 1805 when it had a team of near important standard that played matches against clubs like Montpelier Cricket Club and Homerton Cricket Club.\nThe original Richmond club went out of existence sometime in the 19th century, possibly during the Napoleonic Wars as there is no record of it after 1805."

        "text": "Carl Davis (born March 2, 1992) is an American football nose tackle for the Dallas Cowboys of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Iowa.\nEarly years.\nDavis attended Adlai Stevenson High School, where he played high school football. He was named first-team All-state by the \"Detroit Free Press\", \"The Detroit News\" and \"The Macomb Daily\". He was a first-team All-conference as a senior after earning second-team honors as a junior. As a junior, he collected 47 tackles, with eight tackles for loss, 15 quarterback hurries and three quarterback sacks, helping his prep team post a 10–2 mark. He recorded 58 tackles as a senior, including six sacks while leading his team to a 13–1 record and advancing to the state championship game at Ford Field. Also blocked two field goals, had one interception and scored one touchdown. Davis also lettered in basketball and track and field.\nCollege career.\nDavis was redshirted as a true freshman at the University of Iowa in 2010. As a redshirt freshman in 2011, Davis played in six games and had two tackles. As a sophomore in 2012, he played in 11 games making eight tackles. Davis became a first year starter as a junior in 2013, starting all 13 games. He finished the season with 42 tackles and 1.5 sacks. Davis entered his senior season in 2014 as a starter for the second consecutive year.\nProfessional career.\nPre-draft.\nOn November 10, 2014, it was reported that Davis had accepted an invitation to play in the 2015 Senior Bowl as a part of the North team under Tennessee Titans head coach Ken Whisenhunt. Davis improved his draft stock with top performances during practice throughout the week and met with coaches from the Baltimore Ravens. He was dominant and showed his strength while beating Pitt's offensive tackle T. J. Clemmings. For his efforts, Davis was voted by a panel of NFL scouts as the Reese's Senior Bowl Practice Player of the Week. On January 24, 2015, Davis assisted on a tackle for a loss and sacked Colorado State's Garrett Grayson, as he helped the North defeat the South 34-13. He attended the NFL combine as a top defensive end prospect and completed nearly all of the required combine drills, but opted to skip the bench press. Davis had pre-draft visits and private workouts with six teams, including the Dallas Cowboys, San Francisco 49ers, Buffalo Bills, Miami Dolphins, Detroit Lions, and Chicago Bears. On March 23, 2015, Davis participated at Iowa's pro day, along with Brandon Scherff, Andrew Donnal, Louis Trinca-Pasat, John Lowdermilk, Damond Powell, Mark Weisman, and six others. At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, Davis was projected to be a second round pick by NFL draft experts and scouts. He was ranked the fifth best defensive tackle prospect by \"Sports Illustrated\", the sixth best defensive tackle by NFLDraftScout.com and NFL analyst Mike Mayock, and was ranked the eighth best defensive tackle by NFL analyst Charles Davis.\nBaltimore Ravens.\n2015.\nThe Baltimore Ravens selected Davis in the third round (90th overall) of the 2015 NFL Draft, after unexpectedly falling in the draft. He was the fifth defensive tackle selected, behind Danny Shelton (No. 12, Cleveland Browns), Malcom Brown (No. 32, New England Patriots), Eddie Goldman (No. 39, Bears), and Jordan Phillips (No. 52, Dolphins). The Baltimore Ravens were originally targeting Florida State's P. J. Williams (No. 78, Saints), Virginia's Eli Harold (No. 79, 49ers), and UNI's David Johnson (No. 86, Cardinals) with their third round selection, but chose Davis as he was the best talent available. Although the Baltimore Ravens did not have a pre-draft visit or private workout with Davis, they did meet with him during the Senior Bowl and NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis. On May 8, 2015, the Baltimore Ravens signed Davis to a four-year, $2.95 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $625,084.\nHe competed with Brandon Williams and Christo Bilukidi throughout training camp for the vacant starting nose tackle position left by the departure of Haloti Ngata to the Lions during free agency. Head coach John Harbaugh named Davis the backup starting nose tackle to Williams to begin the regular season.\nHe made his professional regular season debut in the Ravens' season-opener against the Denver Broncos and recorded three combined tackles and a pass deflection in their 19–13 loss. On September 27, 2015, Davis earned his first career start at defensive tackle and defended a pass during their 28–24 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals. He started the next two games at defensive tackle, in place of Timmy Jernigan who had an injured knee. Davis was a healthy scratch for Weeks 12–14 despite having a strong start to his rookie season and being the first member of the Ravens' 2015 draft class to start.\nIn 13 games of his rookie season, Davis produced 11 tackles and 2 passes defended.\n2016.\nDavis competed with Williams, Willie Henry, Michael Pierce, and Trevon Coley throughout training camp for the starting nose tackle position. On September 1, 2016, Davis sustained an ankle injury and left during the Ravens' 23–14 victory over the New Orleans Saints in their pre-season finale. On September 5, 2016, Davis was placed on injured reserve and missed the entire season with an ankle injury.\n2017.\nDavis returned to training camp in and competed with Brent Urban, Williams, and Bronson Kaufusi for the starting defensive end position. He was named the backup defensive end, behind Urban and Williams to start the regular season.\nOn October 1, 2017, David earned his first start of the season after Urban was placed on injured reserve. He recorded three solo tackles in the Ravens' 26–9 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers. The next game, he suffered a hamstring injury during the first half of a 30–17 victory over the Oakland Raiders. He missed the following game and played sparingly in the next 7 weeks due to the injury.\n2018.\nOn September 1, 2018, Davis was waived by the Ravens.\nCleveland Browns.\nOn September 2, 2018, Davis was claimed off waivers by the Cleveland Browns. He played minimally for the Browns, registering just one assisted tackle for 2018.\nThe Browns re-signed Davis on a one year $2 million contract on March 12, 2019. The Browns released Davis on August 31, 2019.\nIndianapolis Colts.\nOn October 14, 2019, Davis was signed by the Indianapolis Colts. He was released on November 4.\nJacksonville Jaguars.\nOn November 25, 2019, Davis was signed by the Jacksonville Jaguars.\nOn February 4, 2020, Davis was suspended the first four games of the 2020 season for violating the league’s performance-enhancing substance policy.

He was reinstated from suspension on October 5, 2020, and the team was given a roster exemption for him. He was released on October 12 and signed to the team's practice squad the next day.\nNew England Patriots.\nOn October 14, 2020, Davis was signed by the New England Patriots off the Jaguars practice squad.

They went to Somerset High in Kentucky, where they met up with Red Roberts and were recruited by boosters to Centre. The 1917 team ostensibly did so well that Myers felt his players were better than his coaching abilities, and hired Charley Moran. James was thrice an All-Southern tackle and end.

        "text": "In baseball, a rain check is a ticket issued to spectators which admits them to the ballpark at a later date at no additional cost to the ticket holder. It is issued if a game is cancelled due to rain or other inclement weather, or if a game has been started but suspended due to inclement weather prior to the point of becoming an official game (five innings in regular season Major League Baseball games or at any time during the postseason). Depending on the home team/league policy and the rescheduling of the game, the rain check may admit the ticket holder to watch the rained out game or the continuation of a suspended game only on the rescheduled date, or it may allow the ticket holder to exchange the tickets for tickets of equal value to another game within a specified time frame.\nRain checks were originally separate tickets issued by the home team to spectators as they left the ballpark following a rainout. In modern times, the ticket to the rained out game serves as the rain check. The practice has been recorded since the 1870s – though it did not become generally established until the 20th century – and today the term \"rain check\" is used idiomatically to refer to any deferred promise.\nHistory.\nThe institution of issuing tickets for games canceled due to rain dates at least to 1870, while the term \"rain check\" dates to at least 1877; in the National League it was pioneered by the :\nOriginally a rain check for a canceled game was simply a ticket valid for a future game – in lieu of a refund – not specifically for a makeup game. Further, at the time clubs would sell reusable hard cardboard tickets, which were turned in at the admissions gate, then resold at the box office at the conclusion of the game. Originally rain checks were issued to spectators as they exited, but this resulted in severe losses to clubs, due to free-riders and fence-climbers also getting tickets. This was solved by Abner Powell circa 1889 by using a stub on the original ticket as rain check. Powell is thus often incorrectly credited with inventing rain checks, while in fact he instead refined an existing practice."

        "text": "Gregory Victor Davis (1939 - 1979) was a New Zealand born, national representative rugby union player for Australia. He played at flanker and made seven international tours with Wallaby squads. He was the Australian national captain in 47 matches from 1969 to 1972 and led the Wallaby side on three overseas tours.\nPlaying career.\nBorn in New Zealand, Greg Davis played for Katikati in the Thames Valley, for Otahuhu in Auckland and for Tauranga in the Bay of Plenty. He trialled for the All Blacks in 1961 and moved to Australia in 1963 and there joined the Drummoyne Rugby Club\nDavis was immediately selected for both New South Wales and Australia in his first year in Sydney. He debuted in a Sydney Test match against England in June 1963 and the following month was selected in the squad for the 1963 Australia rugby union tour of South Africa. He played in all four Test matches of the tied series and in ten other tour matches. The next year he made the 1964 Australia rugby union tour of New Zealand playing in seven of the eight matches including all three Tests.\nHe represented in Sydney in 1965 in a Test against the Springboks and in 1966 in two Tests British &amp; Irish Lions. The next year he made the 1966–67 Australia rugby union tour of Britain, Ireland and France and played in twenty of the thirty-six matches including all five Tests. In 1967 he was in the Wallaby side that travelled to New Zealand for the 75th Jubilee Test and in 1968 he made the short tour of Ireland and Scotland.\nDavis was first honoured with the Australian captaincy in a home match against Wales in 1969 and a few weeks later he led the Wallabies on the 1969 Australia rugby union tour of South Africa where he played in four Tests and a further seventeen tour matches. The squad was selected with an eye to youth and some experienced campaigners were left at home – all four Test matches were lost. Davis continued as national captain for the next three years in Tests at home against Scotland, South Africa and France and also led the Wallabies on the 1971 Australia rugby union tour of France and the 1972 Australia rugby union tour of New Zealand and Fiji. He played in eleven of thirteen matches in this, his final rugby tour, and at its end, he retired from rugby. Howell writes that for Davis, at 33 years and the end of a magnificent career, the seven loss and five win result of the tour was \"a disaster and occasioned Davis' retirement\". An injury picked up in New Zealand prevented Davis from leading the side in the Test match in Fiji on the way home. Peter Sullivan led the Wallabies to a 21–19 victory against Fiji. He had already captained Australia in two mide-week games during the New Zealand leg. The third Test in New Zealand, a 38–3 romp by the All Blacks was Greg Davis' final match.\nAll told he made 102 match appearances for Australia; 39 were Test matches. He captained his country in 16 Tests and in 31 other matches.\nCaptaincy and style.\nHowell describes Davis as a \"lead from the front\" captain who \"offered a 'never give up' approach that rallied the troops\". His position as loose flanker required him to break quickly from the scrum and his speed and \"devastating tackling proved a scourge to fly-halves\". Howell regarded Davis as \"a leader of men who believed a leader should lead...a single minded flanker who gave no quarter and asked for none\".\nLater life.\nAfter retiring from rugby in 1972 Davis moved back to New Zealand the following year to further his business career and intending to work in real estate. In 1979 he died of a brain tumour days short of his 40th birthday. He left a wife, two sons and a daughter. Benefit matches were played in Sydney and elsewhere and funds were raised to provide ongoing support to his family. In October 2014 Davis was inducted into Australia Rugby's Hall of Fame."

        "text": "The 2014–15 Rugby-Bundesliga was the 44th edition of this competition and the 95th edition of the German rugby union championship. In the Rugby-Bundesliga, twenty-one teams played in, initially, four regional divisions, the first stage of the competition, followed by a championship round of sixteen clubs and, finally, the play-offs consisting of twelve teams. The season started on 30 August 2014 and finished with the championship final on 16 May 2015 in Heidelberg, interrupted by a winter break from December to late February. Nominally the league should consist of twenty-four teams however only twenty-one fulfilled the licensing requirements for 2014–15.\nThe defending champions were Heidelberger RK who defeated TV Pforzheim in the 2014 final to take out its tenth championship and fifth in a row. Heidelberger RK remained unbeaten throughout the 2013–14 regular season, as it had been all throughout the 2012–13 Rugby-Bundesliga season, having last lost in the Bundesliga on 1 November 2011, when \"HRK\" was beaten 26–24 by TV Pforzheim. Heidelberg took out its sixth consecutive title and twelfth overall when it defeated Pforzheim 53–27 in the final once more, capping another season without defeat. The club thereby also equaled a championship record, becoming the second club after Victoria Linden to win six consecutive titles.\nIt was to be the last edition with twenty four clubs as the annual general meeting of the \"DRV\" in July 2015 decided to reduce the league to sixteen clubs from the 2015–16 season onwards.\nOverview.\nThe league saw only minor changes compare to the previous season, having played at full strength of 24 clubs in 2013–14 instead of only 21 in 2014–15. The 08 Ricklingen/Wunstorf withdrew from the league during the 2013–14 season, while TuS 95 Düsseldorf, RC Mainz, Veltener RC and USV Potsdam Rugby were relegated from the competition. New in the league were RU Hohen Neuendorf and SG Siemensstadt/Grizzlies.\nThe first stage of the competition, the \"Vorrunde\", nominally saw four six-team groupes in which each team played the other five just once, however the western group played with only four temas and the northern group with only five. This stage finished in late September after which the second stage started, the \"Qualifikationsphase\", in which the top teams each from the southern and the western group play each other in one group while the top teams from the north and east play each other in another. The fourth placed team from each division would play the fifth placed in the opposite group to determine the last two places in the second round. The five teams not qualified for the \"Qualifikationsphase\" entered the \"DRV-Pokal\", the German rugby union cup, together with the top eight teams of the 2. Bundesliga. The 2. Bundesliga teams not qualified for the \"DRV-Pokal\" in turn played for the \"Liga Pokal\".\nIn the second stage the teams within a group would play each other in a home-and-away format, with the teams that already played each other in the first stage carrying over those results. Of the sixteen clubs the best six in each group now qualified for the knock-out stage. The knock-out stage was played in a single-game format with the higher seeded team enjoying home advantage and the winner advancing to the next round.\nBundesliga tables &amp; results.\nFirst stage.\nIn the first stage twenty-one clubs played in four groups. Within each group each team played the other just once. The best three teams advanced directly to the second stage while the teams placed fourth and fifth had to play a qualifying decider.\nNorth.\nThe division table: \nEast.\nThe division table:\nWest.\nThe division table:\nSouth.\nThe division table:\nQualifying matches.\nThree qualifying matches were held to determine the last three clubs to enter the second stage. Nominally the fourth placed club in the southern division played the fifth placed team in the western division and the fourth placed western club the fifth placed southern team. However, as the western division had only four clubs the fourth placed team in the south received a bye and direct entry into the championship round. The same system applied to the northern and eastern division where the league strength required both games to take place. The winners of the three games advanced to the second stage while the losers had to enter the \"DRV-Pokal\".\nSecond stage.\nIn the second stage sixteen clubs played in two groups of eight clubs each. Within each group each team played the others home and away except for the match-ups that already had been played in the first round. The results of those were carried over. The best six teams in each group qualified for the play-offs and were seeded according to the final standings. The second round concluded on 18 April 2015 and was followed by the play-offs.\nNorth-East.\nThe division table:\nSouth-West.\nThe division table:\nPlay-off stage.\nIn the play-offs the twelve qualified teams played four rounds. The best two clubs in each division received a bye for the first round and entered in the quarter-finals stage. The first round was played on 25 April, the quarter-finals were held on 2 May and the semi-finals on 9 May. The final of the German championship was held on 16 May:\n\"DRV-Pokal\" tables &amp; results.\nThe five worst clubs in the first stage of the Bundesliga entered the \"DRV-Pokal\" for 2014–15, together with the eight best clubs from the 2nd Rugby-Bundesliga. The \"DRV-Pokal\" ranks as a second tier to the German championship but also functioned as a qualifying competition for the 2015–16 Rugby-Bundesliga. The modus for the \"DRV-Pokal\" was the same as for the German championship, with a second stage with two divisions of, nominally, eight teams, followed by the play-offs made up of the best twelve teams, with the top two in each division receiving a bye for the first round.\nGroup stage.\nNorth-East.\nThe division table:\nSouth-West.\nThe division table:\nPlay-off stage.\nThe 2014–15 final was played on 23 May 2014 in Heidelberg.

        "text": "The 2015 FIA World Endurance Championship season was the fourth season of the FIA World Endurance Championship auto racing series, co-organized by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) and the Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO). The series was open to Le Mans Prototypes and grand tourer-style racing cars meeting four ACO categories. World championship titles were awarded for Le Mans Prototypes drivers and for manufacturers in the LMP1 category, and several World Endurance Cups and Endurance Trophies were also awarded in all four categories. The season began at the Silverstone Circuit in April and ended at the Bahrain International Circuit in November after eight rounds, and included the 83rd running of the 24 Hours of Le Mans.\nPorsche secured the World Manufacturers' Championship at the 6 Hours of Shanghai, beating Audi by eighty points. Porsche's Timo Bernhard, Mark Webber, and Brendon Hartley won the World Drivers' Championship in the final round of the season, ahead of Audi's André Lotterer, Benoît Tréluyer, and Marcel Fässler. Porsche teammates Marc Lieb, Romain Dumas, and Neel Jani were third in the championship standings. Bernhard, Webber, and Hartley won four consecutive races over the course of the season. Porsche also won the World Endurance Cup for GT Manufacturers in the final event, overcoming the lead held by Ferrari earlier in the season. Richard Lietz of Porsche won the World Endurance Cup for GT Drivers over three-time defending Cup winner Gianmaria Bruni and his teammate Toni Vilander.\nRebellion Racing and their drivers Mathias Beche and Nicolas Prost won the trophies for LMP1 class private entries despite not participating in the first two rounds of the championship. The championships were Rebellion's fourth and Beche and Prost's second consecutive trophy titles respectively. Roman Rusinov, Julien Canal, and Sam Bird of G-Drive Racing secured the LMP2 class trophies over the KCMG team. Porsche Team Manthey won the LMGTE Professional category trophy for teams over Ferrari representative AF Corse. The LMGTE Amateur category trophies were won by SMP Racing and their drivers Viktor Shaitar, Aleksey Basov, and Andrea Bertolini, ahead of AF Corse's LMGTE Am entry.\nSchedule.\nA provisional calendar was announced by the ACO at the 2014 6 Hours of Fuji and confirmed at the FIA World Motor Sport Council meeting in Doha shortly after. The schedule remains much the same as 2014, with the notable exception of the 6 Hours of São Paulo being replaced by the 6 Hours of Nürburgring. The planned construction of a new pit complex at the Autódromo José Carlos Pace precluded the event from returning in 2015. The Nürburgring round will be the series' first visit to Germany and will take place between the 24 Hours of Le Mans and 6 Hours of Circuit of the Americas, shortening the over three-month gap that was part of the 2014 schedule by three weeks.\nEntries.\nThe FIA unveiled an entry of 35 cars for the 2015 season on 5 February, divided into four categories: Le Mans Prototype 1 (LMP1) and 2 (LMP2), and Le Mans Grand Touring Endurance Professional (LMGTE Pro) and Amateur (LMGTE Am). The entry is the largest in the history of the FIA WEC, and seven more cars than the entry in 2014.\nLMP1.\nThe LMP1-H and LMP1-L categories introduced in 2014 are merged once more into a single LMP1 category, allowing the privateer teams to again face the manufacturer teams. Nissan joins the LMP1 category as a manufacturer after supplying engines in LMP2 since the series' inception in 2012. The Nissan GT-R LM Nismo utilizes a unique layout amongst the LMP1 field, with a front-engine design and a front-wheel drive powertrain. Nissan's drivers include FIA GT1 World Champion Michael Krumm, European Le Mans Series LMP2 champion Olivier Pla who moves from G-Drive Racing, and former Formula One driver Max Chilton. LMP2 veterans Harry Tincknell, Jann Mardenborough, and Alex Buncombe complete the team's full season line-up, while Lucas Ordóñez, Mark Shulzhitskiy, and defending Super GT champion Tsugio Matsuda will drive the team's third entry for Le Mans.\nDebutants in 2014, Porsche retain their line-up but add a third 919 Hybrid for Le Mans: current Force India Formula One driver Nico Hülkenberg joined Nick Tandy and Earl Bamber who were promoted from Porsche's LMGTE program.\nWith the retirement of 2013 World Endurance Drivers' champion Tom Kristensen, Audi have promoted Oliver Jarvis to partner with Lucas di Grassi and Loïc Duval in an R18 e-tron quattro. The second Audi retains the same line-up which won the 2012 World Endurance Drivers' championship: Marcel Fässler, Benoît Tréluyer, and André Lotterer. René Rast moves from Audi's GT program to take Jarvis' vacated seat in the third Audi for Le Mans.\nDefending World Endurance Drivers' champions Anthony Davidson and Sébastien Buemi gain a new co-driver at Toyota for 2015, as Kazuki Nakajima switches from the sister car to replace the departed Nicolas Lapierre. Nakajima's spot in the second TS040 Hybrid is filled by Mike Conway, promoted from reserve duty in 2014, to partner Stéphane Sarrazin and Alexander Wurz.\nThe two LMP1-L entries from 2014 remain into the new season but with alterations to their campaigns. Kodewa, previously entered under sponsorship with Lotus Cars, is renamed Team ByKolles for 2015. ByKolles retains the CLM P1/01 with AER power that they campaigned in the second half of 2014. Pierre Kaffer is retained alongside Simon Trummer who appeared with Kodewa for one race in 2014. Vitantonio Liuzzi returns to the team after having previously campaigned the Lotus in LMP2 in 2013. Rebellion Racing come into 2015 as the defending LMP1 Private Teams champions, but have chosen to forgo the Toyota engines for the same AER powerplant used by Team ByKolles. This decision forced Rebellion to withdraw from the first races of the season in order to adapt their R-Ones for the new motors. The No. 12 Rebellion's drivers remain unchanged, while the No. 13 adds series rookie Daniel Abt and former KCMG LMP2 driver Alexandre Imperatori alongside team veteran Dominik Kraihamer.\nLMP2.\nAfter the LMP2 field in 2014 was the smallest in the history of the WEC, with only four cars competing for the full season despite an initial seven entries in the category, the class has regained popularity with ten entries for 2015. Even with an increase in cars, defending LMP2 champions SMP Racing and driver Sergey Zlobin have opted not to return, instead focusing on the European Le Mans Series to develop their new BR01 chassis. 2013 LMP2 champions OAK Racing return to the series under their own banner for team owner and driver Jacques Nicolet, while their G-Drive Racing operation which won four races in 2014 expands to a two-car operation in 2015. Sam Bird replaces Olivier Pla in the first G-Drive entry alongside Roman Rusinov and Julien Canal, while Gustavo Yacamán, Ricardo González, and Pipo Derani share the second car. All three entries will use the Ligier JS P2-Nissan combination. KCMG also remain in the series for 2015, replacing their Oreca 03 with the newer 05 chassis. Porsche driver Nick Tandy will join KCMG for part of the season when not driving the third Porsche LMP1, while Richard Bradley and Matthew Howson remain with the squad. Former Toyota LMP1 driver Nicolas Lapierre will serve as Tandy's replacement when he is unavailable. Strakka Racing, who had filed a full-season entry in 2014 but failed to participate after development delays with their Strakka-Dome S103 chassis, return for 2015 with an unchanged program. Strakka were the only team campaigning Michelin tyres in LMP2 before switching to the Dunlops used by the rest of the category.\nDefending European Le Mans Series champions Signatech, retaining drivers' champions Nelson Panciatici and Paul-Loup Chatin and adding Vincent Capillaire to the team. The team, which previously participated in 2012, will have backing from Alpine with their Oreca-based A450 chassis with Nissan power. Morand Racing also shifts from the European Le Mans Series, partnering with the Japanese firm SARD in a joint effort. The team initially entered two improved versions of the Morgan LMP2 with Judd engines, but funding issues forced the team to downsize to a single entry. Former European Le Mans Series drivers' champion Oliver Webb jumps from Signatech to SARD Morand with Pierre Ragues and rookie Zoël Amberg. Extreme Speed Motorsports is the only North American-representative in the series, shifting from the United SportsCar Championship to the WEC with their HPD-Hondas. In last year's season, as not full-season entrants eligible for points, the team entered with a single car at the 2014 6 Hours of Circuit of the Americas, and then entered two cars in the 6 Hours of Shanghai, where those two events were served as preparation for a full season entry in 2015. Team owner Scott Sharp joins Ryan Dalziel, who secured an LMP2 championship for Starworks Motorsport in the 2012 WEC, and David Heinemeier Hansson, who won the LMGTE Am Drivers' championship in 2014. The second HPD-Honda will be crewed by Johannes van Overbeek, Ed Brown, and former Rolex Sports Car Series champion Jon Fogarty.\nLMGTE Pro.\nThe LMGTE Pro category remains largely unchanged from 2014 as Porsche, Ferrari, and Aston Martin remain the sole manufacturers involved. Three-time LMGTE champions AF Corse's Ferraris will have a near identical line-up as Gianmaria Bruni and Toni Vilander defend their titles in the lead car, while James Calado and Davide Rigon remain in the second Ferrari. Porsche Team Manthey also keeps the drivers for its two cars largely unchanged. Frédéric Makowiecki, Patrick Pilet, and Wolf Henzler share the No. 92, while Jörg Bergmeister and Richard Lietz remain in the No. 91. Michael Christensen is the newcomer to the No. 91, replacing the promoted Nick Tandy. Aston Martin Racing expands their effort to three cars for 2015 after partner Young Driver's entry, which won the LMGTE Am category in 2014, moves to the Pro class. The all-Danish line-up of Nicki Thiim and Christoffer Nygaard are joined by newcomer Marco Sørensen. Robert Bell takes over Bruno Senna's seat alongside Stefan Mücke and Darren Turner, while Alex MacDowall and Fernando Rees are joined by Richie Stanaway, promoted from Aston Martin's LMGTE Am line-up the previous season.\nLMGTE Am.\nThe field in LMGTE Am features teams which have experience in the WEC. Aston Martin Racing retains their two-car entry, with Paul Dalla Lana and Pedro Lamy's car joined by newcomer Mathias Lauda, and Roald Goethe and Stuart Hall returning to the series for the first time since 2013, adding former FIA GT3 European Champion Francesco Castellacci. AF Corse also remains in the category, downgrading from a two-car entry to a single car for 2015. François Perrodo and Emmanuel Collard move from the departed Prospeed Competition Porsche team to campaign AF Corse's Ferrari alongside Rui Águas. Proton Racing keeps their entry with Christian Ried, Klaus Bachler, and Khaled Al Qubaisi, while a second Porsche is added to the squad for actor Patrick Dempsey alongside Porsche factory driver Patrick Long and Marco Seefried. SMP Racing remains in the championship despite not defending their LMP2 championship titles. Viktor Shaytar moves from the LMP2 program to the team's Ferrari while being joined by newcomer to the series Aleksey Basov and Ferrari factory driver Andrea Bertolini. 2012 LMGTE Am Teams' champions Larbre Compétition return to the series for the first time since 2013, campaigning the first customer Chevrolet Corvette C7.R. Gianluca Roda and Paolo Ruberti join the team after 8 Star Motorsports did not return to the series along with 2014 LMGTE Am Drivers' champion Kristian Poulsen.\nRegulation changes.\nThe FIA's World Motor Sport Council (WMSC) approved a series of regulation changes for the World Endurance Championship during December 2014. Tyres are limited at each race weekend, bar Le Mans, for the LMP1 and LMGTE categories: each car is allowed four sets of tyres in practice and six during the race. The LMP2 category retains their limit of three sets in practice and four during the race. Tyre manufacturers are also no longer allowed to refuse a supply program with a team. The qualifying format is also altered for the fourth season in a row. Teams will still be required to run two drivers during the qualifying session, but only their best lap is used in determining the qualifying average; previously each driver's best two laps were averaged. LMP2 and LMGTE Am teams are also required to run at least one amateur driver during the qualifying session. A final regulation change is the elimination of the two LMP1 classes introduced in 2014. Regulations will exist for hybrid and non-hybrid LMP1 cars, but all cars are classified under a single LMP1 category. The LMP1 Private Teams trophies are open to non-hybrid LMP1 cars only.\nA second meeting of the WMSC in March 2015 approved further regulation changes. The LMP1 category has limits introduced to control the costs for manufacturers including a restriction on the number of personnel involved in operations, the homologation of only a single hybrid drivetrain design, and a maximum of five engines each car can use over the season, with the exception of new manufacturers allowed seven engines in their debut season. Limits are also placed on the number of days teams in all categories can conduct tests outside of races. An additional ballast weight can be added to cars whose drivers average less than . Further regulation changes proposed are an alteration to the minimum and maximum drive time allowances in the LMP1 and LMGTE Pro categories and a reduction in the duration of the qualifying session from 25 minutes to 20 due to each team only requiring a minimum of two laps instead of four.\nResults and standings.\nRace results.\nThe highest finishing competitor entered in the World Endurance Championship is listed below. Invitational entries may have finished ahead of WEC competitors in individual races.\nEntries were required to complete the timed race as well as to complete 70% of the overall winning car's race distance in order to earn championship points. A single bonus point was awarded to the team and all drivers of the pole position car for each category in qualifying. For the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the race result points allocation was doubled. Furthermore, a race must complete three laps under green flag conditions in order for championship points to be awarded.\nDrivers' Championships.\nFive titles are offered to drivers in the 2015 season. The World Championship is reserved for LMP1 and LMP2 drivers while the World Cup for GT Drivers is available for drivers in the LMGTE categories. Further, three FIA Endurance Trophies were also awarded to drivers in the LMP2 and LMGTE Am categories as well as privateers in the LMP1 category.\nManufacturers' Championships.\nTwo manufacturers' titles were contested in the 2015 FIA WEC, one for LMPs and one for LMGTEs. The World Endurance Championship for Manufacturers was only open to manufacturer entries in the LMP1 category, while the World Endurance Cup for GT Manufacturers allowed all entries from registered manufacturers in LMGTE Pro and LMGTE Am to participate. The two top finishing cars from each manufacturer earned points toward their total.\nTeams' Championships.\nAll categories award a team trophy for each individual entry, although LMP1 is limited to entries not from a manufacturer."

        "title": "2015 Giro d'Italia",
        "text": "The 2015 Giro d'Italia () was a three-week Grand Tour cycling stage race that took place in May 2015. It was the 98th running of the Giro d'Italia and took place principally in Italy, although some stages visited France and Switzerland. The race included 21 stages, beginning in San Lorenzo al Mare on 9 May and concluding in Milan on 31 May. It was the fifteenth race of the 2015 UCI World Tour. The Giro was won by Alberto Contador (), with Fabio Aru () second and Aru's teammate Mikel Landa third.\nContador first took the lead after stage 5, the race's first uphill finish. His defence of the pink jersey (given to the leader in the General classification in the Giro d'Italia) was put in doubt when he injured his left shoulder in a crash in the sixth stage. He held his lead through several stages stage but was caught up in another crash in stage 13, which caused him to lose the lead. He took the lead back the following day in the Individual time trial, where he gained a lead of several minutes over all his rivals. Despite aggressive riding from Aru and Landa in the final week, Contador was able to defend his lead to the finish of the race. This was his third Giro d'Italia title, after the 2008 race.\nAs well as finishing second overall, Aru won the white jersey as the best young rider in the week. Giacomo Nizzolo () won the points competition and Giovanni Visconti (Movistar) won the mountains classification. Astana finished first in both the team ranking by time and the team ranking by points. Contador, Visconti and Nizzolo all won their classifications without winning any stage victories.\nTeams.\nAs the Giro d'Italia was a UCI World Tour event, all seventeen UCI WorldTeams were automatically invited and obliged to send a squad. Five UCI Professional Continental teams were given wildcard places in the race by RCS Sport, the race organisers. Four of these were Italian-based teams: , , and . Southeast's entry in the race was earned by their victory in the 2014 Coppa Italia, when they competed as ; they were invited despite three recent doping cases in the team. The final wildcard place was awarded to , a Polish-based team. CCC-Sprandi-Polkowice's invitation immediately received attention because the team's roster included two prominent riders who has previously served bans for doping: Stefan Schumacher and Davide Rebellin. The day after the announcement, \"Cycling Weekly\" reported that the team might omit the riders from its squad for the race.\nSeveral prominent teams applied for wildcard places but were unsuccessful. These were , , and .\nThe team presentation took place in San Remo on the evening before the first stage. As each team sent nine riders to the race, the startlist contained 198 riders. George Bennett () was withdrawn from the startlist on the night before the race, however, as a blood test had revealed low cortisol levels. As his team was part of the Movement for Credible Cycling (MPCC), he was not allowed to start the Giro. therefore began the race with eight riders and there were 197 riders in the peloton at the beginning of the race. This included riders from 36 different countries, with the largest numbers coming from Italy (59), France (15), Belgium (12) and the Netherlands (12). The average age of riders in the Giro was 28.95; they ranged from the 21-year-old Rick Zabel () to the 41-year-old Alessandro Petacchi (Southeast).\nPre-race favourites.\nThe winner of the 2014 Giro d'Italia, Nairo Quintana (), chose not to defend his title in order to focus on the Tour de France. The principal favourite for the race was Alberto Contador (), especially as Chris Froome () and Vincenzo Nibali (), two of the most successful active Grand Tour riders, also chose to focus on the Tour and to skip the Giro. Contador, who had won the 2014 Vuelta a España, was attempting to win both the Giro and the Tour in the same season. No rider had achieved this double since Marco Pantani in 1998; Contador described his ambition to do \"something that people will remember forever\". Contador's last attempt to win both the Giro and the Tour – in the 2011 season – ended in failure. Although he finished first in the Giro, he only managed fifth place in the Tour; both results were subsequently removed because of a ban due to a doping case from 2010.\nThe rider considered most likely to challenge Contador for the general classification was Richie Porte (Sky). Porte had already achieved nine race victories in 2015, including the overall victories in Paris–Nice, the Volta a Catalunya and the Giro del Trentino. Porte was expected to be particularly strong in the individual time trial, as well as in the mountains. Porte had not shown consistent form in a Grand Tour in recent years, however, and there were doubts about his ability to maintain his form over a three-week race.\nRigoberto Urán () – who had finished second in 2013 and 2014 – was also among the favourites, with the long individual time trial expected to suit him. Fabio Aru (Astana) – who had finished third in 2014 – was also expected to perform well; \"VeloNews\" described him as \"perhaps the best pure climber in the race\". Other riders expected to challenge for the higher places included Ilnur Zakarin (), who had just won the Tour de Romandie, Domenico Pozzovivo (), Jurgen Van den Broeck (), Damiano Caruso (BMC) and Ryder Hesjedal (), the winner of the 2012 Giro d'Italia. Four former winners of the Giro started the 2015 edition: Contador, Hesjedal, Ivan Basso (Tinkoff–Saxo) and Damiano Cunego ().\nOther prominent riders to start the race included a large number of prominent sprinters, including André Greipel (Lotto–Soudal) and Michael Matthews (). Greipel was expected to perform well in the few flat stages. Matthews had the ability to win hillier stages; his team's strength in the team time trial was expected to put him into the pink jersey as leader of the general classification during the first week; he had also worn the jersey in the first week of the 2014 Giro. Tom Boonen (), a former world champion, participated in the Giro for the first time in his career.\nRoute and stages.\nThe first announcement of the route for the 2015 Giro came in July 2014, when RCS Sport announced that it would begin with a team time trial from San Lorenzo al Mare along the coast to San Remo. The route would use the cycle path and would start at the foot of the Cipressa climb made famous by its inclusion in the Milan–San Remo classic. The route used neither the climb of the Cipressa nor that of the Poggio di San Remo; it kept to the coastline and was entirely flat. The stage would end on the Lungomare Italo Calvino in San Remo. The following two stages were announced at the same time. The second stage – the first mass-start stage of the race – would suit the sprinters, while the third stage would take the riders to La Spezia, where the small climb of the Biassa would come towards the end of the stage. A further route announcement was made in mid-September. Mauro Vegni, the race director, announced that the Giro would return to the climb of the Madonna di Campiglio for the first time since 1999. In the 1999 Giro, Marco Pantani won the stage that finished on the climb and was in the race lead; he failed a test for EPO use, however, and was expelled from the race. The full route announcement was made in Milan on 6 October at an event attended by many riders expected to participate in the Giro.\nAn additional stage in Liguria was included in the route. This was the new third stage, with the stage to La Spezia now stage 4. The additional stage was hilly but had a long flat section towards the finish. The first summit finish of the race came on the second-category climb of the Abetone at the end of stage 5. There was then one flat stage, which was followed by the hilly stage 7, which was the longest stage in any Giro d'Italia since 2000 at . These took the riders south along the Tyrrhenian coast and into Campania and then inland towards the southern Apennines. The race then entered the mountains for stages 8 and 9. Stage 8 had a summit finish on the Campitello Matese; stage 9 included mountains and hills throughout. This was followed by the race's first rest day.\nThe rest day included a transfer to Civitanova Marche on the Adriatic coast. The subsequent stages took the riders along the coast and then into the Dolomites. Immediately after the rest day, there were four relatively flat stages, although two of them included hills towards the end. These were followed by the race's only individual time trial. This was in length and was one of the longest time trials in the Giro in recent years. It began with of flat roads, which were followed by rolling roads towards the finish line in Valdobbiadene. After the time trial came the stage to Madonna di Campiglio, which included several other difficult climbs. This was followed by the second rest day.\nThe final week of the race began with a stage that crossed the very difficult Passo di Mortirolo on the way to a finish on a third-category climb in Aprica. \"Cycling Weekly\" described this as \"this year's blockbuster stage\". This was followed by one of the flattest stages of the race, which took the Giro out of Italy for the first time in 2015 as it crossed into Switzerland for a finish in Lugano. There were then three consecutive days with high mountains. The eighteenth stage of the race started in Melide, Switzerland in Switzerland and took the riders across the difficult Monte Ologno before a difficult descent to the finish. There were then two consecutive summit finishes on the Cervinia and on Sestriere. The final stage was a largely ceremonial flat stage towards a finish in Milan.\nThe highest climb of the 2015 Giro – known as the \"Cima Coppi\" – was the Colle delle Finestre on the penultimate stage. This was above sea level. In general, the climbs were lower than in previous years, following controversy in the 2014 Giro over the crossing of the Stelvio Pass. The race organisers also tried to make the transfers between stages shorter.\nRace overview.\nStage 1, the team time trial, was won by . Simon Gerrans was the first rider to cross the line, so he became the first leader of the race. Tinkoff–Saxo were second, seven seconds slower, which made Contador the best-placed rider among the general classification favourites. He gained six seconds on Aru and twenty seconds on Porte. Elia Viviani won the sprint on stage 2; he therefore took the lead in the points classification. Michael Matthews finished seventh on the stage and moved into the pink jersey. Matthews extended his lead by winning stage 3 in a sprint from a reduced group. There was particular concern during the stage after Domenico Pozzovivo () crashed on a descent; he abandoned the race and was taken to hospital. The fourth stage was won by Davide Formolo () from an early breakaway. Astana raced aggressively in the second part of the stage and put significant pressure on the other general classification riders; Rigoberto Urán lost more than 40 seconds, while Tinkoff–Saxo appeared weak in support of Contador. Matthews lost around 20 minutes; Simon Clarke took over the lead of the race. Clarke was the third Australian rider for the team to lead the 2015 Giro.\nStage 5, with its summit finish at Abetone, was also won by a rider from a breakaway, this time Jan Polanc (), who attacked on the final climb and won by more than a minute. The general classification favourites attacked on the final climb; Contador was the first to attack and was followed by Aru and Porte. They were then joined by Mikel Landa, Aru's teammate, and gained time over all the other riders. Clarke lost over two minutes to Contador, Aru and Porte; he therefore lost the lead in the general classification and Contador became the new leader of the race, two seconds ahead of Aru and twenty ahead of Porte. Contador's lead came under threat the following day. The stage was won by Greipel in a sprint finish, but there was a large crash in the final metres. This was caused by a spectator who was leaning over the crash barriers with a camera; Daniele Colli () collided with him and caused a large number of riders to crash behind him. Contador was among the riders to crash; although he finished the stage on the same time as Greipel, he was treated for a shoulder injury by his team doctor and was unable to put on the leader's jersey on the podium. Despite suffering from the injury, Contador started and finished the following day's stage. This was won in a sprint finish by Diego Ulissi (Lampre–Mérida), while Contador retained the race lead.\nContador continued to be troubled by his injury during stage 8, which finished on the climb of the Campitello Matese. The stage was won by Beñat Intxausti (Movistar), who was in the day's early breakaway and attacked on the final climb. Astana again rode hard to put pressure on the other riders; eventually a group formed of Contador, Aru, Porte and Landa. Landa then attacked and finished second on the stage, 15 seconds ahead of the other three riders. He therefore moved up into fifth place overall, while Contador increased his lead over Aru by winning bonus seconds at an intermediate sprint. Stage 9 was also won by a rider from a breakaway: Paolo Tiralongo (Astana) took a solo victory. Aru, Contador, Porte and Landa were again alone in a group towards the end of the stage; although they came to the finish together, Aru took a second out of the others in the sprint. This moved him to three seconds behind Contador. The following day was the first rest day of the race.\nAfter the rest day, stage 10 was once again won by a rider from a breakaway: Nicola Boem () sprinted to the victory from a small group. A large group – including Contador, Aru and Landa – finished together. Porte, however, suffered a mechanical problem in the final and he was unable to regain contact with the main group, despite assistance from his teammates and from Michael Matthews, Porte's fellow Australian. Porte lost over 40 seconds to the other general classification favourites. After the stage, it was revealed that Porte had been given assistance by another Australian rider, Simon Clarke. Clarke had seen Porte waiting for assistance and had given him one of his own wheels. This was illegal under UCI rules that prohibit \"non-regulation assistance to a rider from another team\"; Porte was therefore given a two-minute time penalty and dropped to twelfth place, over three minutes behind Contador, with Landa moving up to third place.\nStage 11 was won by Ilnur Zakarin, who attacked from an all-day breakaway from the finish line and rode solo to the finish. The general classification favourites all finished together. Stage 12 finished with a short, steep climb. It was won by Philippe Gilbert (BMC). Contador finished second to win six bonus seconds; his lead was further extended as Aru and Landa both lost several seconds on the climb. Contador lost the lead the following day, however. The stage was won in a bunch sprint by Sacha Modolo (); just over before the finish line, however, there was a large crash that delayed a large number of riders. Contador was one of the riders delayed in the crash; he lost 36 seconds to Aru, who therefore took over the race lead. Porte was also caught up in the crash and lost another two minutes.\nStage 14 was the individual time trial, which was won by Vasil Kiryienka (Sky). Contador finished third on the stage, nearly three minutes ahead of Aru. Contador therefore moved back into the race lead. Contador passed Landa on the road, despite starting three minutes after him; Landa lost over four minutes and fell to seventh place overall. Movistar's Andrey Amador moved up into third. Stage 15 was the final stage of the second week and was the climb to Madonna di Campiglio. Landa won the stage after Astana rode hard on the final climb; he finished five seconds ahead of Contador and moved back up to fourth place. Contador finished a second ahead of Aru and extended his lead further due to bonus seconds for his third-place finish. Porte, who had lost over 30 minutes during the weekend following the crash in stage 13, withdrew from the race after the stage.\nAfter the rest day, Landa won a second consecutive stage. Contador had suffered a puncture at the foot of the penultimate climb – the Mortirolo – and at one point was nearly a minute behind Landa and Aru. Contador caught Landa and Aru, however, then attacked them. Although Landa was able to follow Contador's attack, Aru was not. On the final climb to Aprica, Landa attacked and won the stage, 38 seconds ahead of Contador. Aru, meanwhile, lost nearly three minutes to Landa. Landa moved up into second place, although he was still over four minutes behind Contador, with Aru now third. Sacha Modolo won his second stage the following day, in a sprint finish, with Giacomo Nizzolo () moving into the lead of the points classification. Philippe Gilbert also won a second stage of the 2015 Giro on stage 18, escaping in a breakaway early in the day and attacking from the finish to take a solo victory. Contador again increased his lead, however: after Aru and Landa were caught behind a crash, Contador ordered his team to attack. \"Cyclingnews.com\" suggested this was revenge for Astana's attack on stage 16. Contador then attacked alone and, after cooperation with Ryder Hesjedal, gained more than a minute on his rivals. Landa was second, over five minutes behind, with Aru a further 50 seconds back.\nStage 19 was the first of two consecutive summit finishes. The stage was won by Aru, who attacked early in the final climb. Contador was content to let the other riders dictate the pace in the chasing group, which finished over a minute behind Aru. Landa finished in the same group; Aru therefore moved back ahead of him into second place overall. Aru won again on stage 20, the final difficult stage of the Giro. Contador was isolated from his teammates early in the first of the day's two climbs. The roads towards the top of the climb – the – were gravel. Landa attacked around this point and Contador was unable to follow. With Contador struggling, the other riders in the group attacked. Contador was a minute behind them at the summit, with Landa further ahead. At the foot of the final climb, Landa was ordered by his team to wait for Aru with the hope that, by working together, the two riders could put enough time into Contador to win the Giro. Aru attacked in the final kilometres of the final climb to Sestriere and won the stage. Landa was 24 seconds behind. Despite losing over two minutes, Contador retained his race lead.\nThe final stage of the Giro was a flat stage ending with several laps of a circuit in Milan. It was not expected to affect the general classification, with a bunch sprint the likely conclusion. There was an attack on the finishing circuit, however, by Iljo Keisse () and Luke Durbridge (). Although they never had more than a minute's lead, they were able to stay away from the peloton to the finish. Keisse won the sprint between the pair for the stage victory. Contador finished in the leading group to secure the overall victory, just under two minutes ahead of Aru. Contador thus won the overall 2015 Giro d'Italia without winning any stage victories.\nClassification leadership.\nIn the 2015 Giro d'Italia, four different jerseys were awarded. The first and most important is the general classification, calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage. Riders received time bonuses for finishing in the first three places on each stage (excluding the team time trial and individual time trial). The rider with the lowest cumulative time was awarded the pink jersey (the \"maglia rosa\") and was considered the winner of the Giro d'Italia.\nAdditionally, there was a points classification. Riders won points for finishing in the top 15 on each stage. Flat stages award more points that mountainous stages, meaning that this classification tends to favour sprinters. In addition, points can be won in intermediate sprints. The winner of the points classification won the red jersey.\nThere was also a mountains classification. Points were awarded for reaching the top of a climb towards the front of the race. Each climb will be categorized as either first, second, third, or fourth-category, with more points available for the higher-categorized climbs. The \"Cima Coppi\", the race's highest point of elevation, awards more points than the other first-category climbs. At , the \"Cima Coppi\" for the 2015 Giro d'Italia was the unpaved Colle delle Finestre.\nThe fourth jersey represented the young rider classification. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders born after 1 January 1990 were eligible. The winner of the classification was awarded a white jersey.\nThere were also two classifications for teams. In the Trofeo Fast Team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added up; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time. The Trofeo Super Team was a team points classification, with the top 20 placed riders on each stage earning points (20 for first place, 19 for second place and so on, down to a single point for 20th) for their team.\nFinal standings.\nMinor classifications.\nSeveral other minor classifications were awarded. The first of these was the intermediate sprint classification (). Each road stage had two sprints during the stage. The first five riders across the intermediate sprint line were awarded points; the rider with the most points at the end of the race won the classification. This classification was won by Marco Bandiera (). A similar classification, the \"\" prize, was decided by points awarded to the top three riders on each stage. It was similar to the points classification, but with fewer riders awarded points. The classification was won by Mikel Landa. Another classification – the combativity prize () – involved points awarded to the first riders at the stage finishes, at intermediate sprints and at the summits of categorised climbs. It was won by Philippe Gilbert.\nThere was also a breakaway award (). For this, points were awarded to each rider in any breakaway smaller than 10 riders that escaped for at least . Each rider was awarded a point for each kilometre that he was away from the peloton. The rider with the most points at the end of the Giro won the award. The classification was also won by Bandiera. The final individual classification was the \"energy classification\" (). In each stage, the fastest three riders in the final of the stage were awarded points. The rider with the most points at the end of the Giro won the classification. The award was won by Fabio Aru.\nThe final classification was a \"fair play\" ranking for each team. Teams were given penalty points for infringing various rules. These ranged from a half-point penalty for offences that merited a warning from the race officials to a 2000-point penalty for a positive doping test. The team that had the lowest points total at the end of the Giro won the classification. It was won by , who did not receive any penalty points during the Giro."

        "title": "Super Bowl XLIX halftime show",
        "text": "The Super Bowl XLIX halftime show took place on February 1, 2015, at the University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, as part of Super Bowl XLIX. It featured American singer Katy Perry, with singer Lenny Kravitz and rapper Missy Elliott as special guests. The halftime show was critically acclaimed, and its broadcast on NBC attracted over 118 million viewers according to Nielsen. \nThe show won two Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lighting Design/Lighting Direction for a Variety Special and Outstanding Costumes for a Variety Program or Special. The halftime show was also nominated for Outstanding Short-Format Live-Action Entertainment Program.\nBackground.\nIn August 2014, it was reported that the NFL had a shortlist of three potential acts for the Super Bowl XLIX halftime show, which were Coldplay, Katy Perry, and Rihanna. However, \"The Wall Street Journal\" also reported that league representatives asked representatives of potential acts if they would be willing to provide financial compensation to the NFL in exchange for their appearance, in the form of either an up-front fee, or a cut of revenue from concert performances made following the Super Bowl. While these reports were denied by an NFL spokeswoman, the request had, according to the \"Journal\", received a \"chilly\" response from those involved.\nFans of \"Weird Al\" Yankovic launched an unsuccessful campaign to have Yankovic perform the halftime show to promote his album \"Mandatory Fun\". On October 9, 2014, \"Billboard\" announced that Katy Perry would perform at halftime, and the NFL confirmed the announcement on November 23, 2014.\nDevelopment.\nOn January 10, 2015, Perry announced that Lenny Kravitz would also appear at the halftime show. On January 30, 2015, it was revealed that Missy Elliott, who previously worked with Perry on a remix of \"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\", would be an additional performer. Previously, when teasing her female guest performer, Perry revealed: \"I wanted to bring someone back, a throwback of sorts\", which would create a \"female fun night, a bit of old-school\". In preparation for her performance, she watched videos of previous halftime show performances by Diana Ross, Beyoncé, Madonna, and Michael Jackson. Having spent months working on the show, Perry wanted it to be \"a whole different show\" from her Prismatic World Tour, which she was still embarking on. She also met with previous halftime performer Bruno Mars to seek advice on how to prepare for the performance.\nThe halftime show used high quality video projection and lighting design. GlowMotion Technologies created 616 light globes, which appeared at the beginning of the performance, that were controlled by wireless means. Images were projected over 18,000 square feet on the field.\nWorking with designer Jeremy Scott, Perry created four separate costumes for her performance. The first was The Flame Dress, which was \"inspired by a pair of Adidas shoes with leather flames coming out of them\" according to Scott, who said that \"We had to think about these looks like Russian Nesting Dolls. Four looks on one performer is really pushing it.\" The next costume was a California Girls Bikini look. The third look was a sweatshirt dress, which Scott described as being \"cute\" and \"like pajamas\". Her final costume was a Moschino Star Gown which he stated was a \"full-on red carpet Barbie extravaganza\". Perry partook in fashion rehearsals aside from choreography and music rehearsals, as she had to manage wardrobe changes in ten seconds. In October 2014, filming began for a documentary titled \"Katy Perry: Making of the Pepsi Super Bowl Halftime Show\" following Perry's preparation for her performance. It was directed by John Hirsch and released on September 12, 2015.\nSynopsis.\nAt the start of the halftime show, on-field participants held up light globes which created a bird's-eye view of Pepsi's logo. Perry entered the stadium riding atop a large, golden mechanical lion, opening her set with a performance of \"Roar\". She then proceeded to sing \"Dark Horse\", with 3D rendering on the field creating a chessboard visual where the turf constantly turned into \"different shapes and sizes\", as acrobats surrounded the singer. Following this, Perry joined Lenny Kravitz for a duet version of \"I Kissed a Girl\", which included her \"rubbing up against\" Kravitz and flames exploding behind them. During these three songs, Perry was clothed in a \"flame-adorned\" dress, with her black hair in a ponytail. The costume has been described as the \"clothing equivalent of a flame\", and \"dress of fire\".\nThe stage and field rendering transitioned into a \"breezy\" beach setting, with dancers dressed as sharks, palm trees and smiling beach balls dancing around Perry. She underwent a wardrobe change, and progressed into a \"campy\" medley of \"Teenage Dream\" and \"California Gurls\". Rapper Missy Elliott subsequently appeared, performing her songs \"Get Ur Freak On\" and \"Work It\", while Perry played \"hype-woman\" beside her, having now changed once again into a custom Super Bowl 49 jersey. After Perry briefly disappeared, Elliott performed \"Lose Control\". Perry returned, now sporting a \"star-encrusted gown\" for her closing song, \"Firework\". She rose out of midfield on a narrow platform that was attached to a shooting star prop, and flew above the crowds. During this performance, fireworks exploded around Perry and the stadium. The star that Perry was attached to as she flew around the stadium was said to resemble \"The More You Know\"s public service announcements logo.\nCritical reception.\nPerry's performance was critically acclaimed. James Montgomery of \"Rolling Stone\" called the show \"bright [and] booming\". He also stated that Perry showcased \"triumphant\" vocals and stated that Perry \"left it all on the field\" after taking a \"well deserved victory lap\" during the performance of \"Firework\". He also complimented Missy Elliott's appearance, calling it \"thrill[ing]\". Jason Lipshutz of \"Billboard\" stated that the \"fiery\" performance \"did not disappoint\" and was a \"career highlight\" for Perry. Chris Chase of \"USA Today\" stated that the performance \"felt more like an Olympic Opening Ceremony\", which he called a \"major achievement\". Chase stated that Perry's performance \"is what a Super Bowl halftime show should be\", while noting that Perry appeared to be singing live and stating that most Twitter users were impressed with the performance. However, Chase felt that Elliott's appearance was \"deflated\" and \"instantly forgettable,\" while Kravitz's appearance was unnecessary, stating that similar to Prince, Bruce Springsteen, and Michael Jackson, Perry was a \"real star\" who did not need a special guest.\nAlex Needham of \"The Guardian\" gave the \"high-octane\" performance 4 out of 5 stars, complimenting Elliott's appearance, which he stated almost \"[stole] the slot\" from Perry until she topped Elliott's appearance with her performance of \"Firework.\" Needham stated that although the performance \"didn't know the meaning of 'too much'\" at times, Perry never appeared to be overwhelmed. Josh Duboff of \"Vanity Fair\" stated that Perry \"killed it\" and \"more than made up for\" what she lacked in \"dance moves or vocal precision\" in \"enthusiasm and ingenuity\". Daniel D'Addario of \"Time\" stated that Perry had \"justified the NFL's trust in her with a dynamic, wild show\" and stated that she did not \"miss a step or a note\". D'Addario stated that the only part of the performance that \"fell flat\" was the inclusion of \"I Kissed a Girl\" on the setlist, saying that Perry \"shouldn't be relying on the cheap titillation of her first single\" to get people's attention \"this deep into her career\". He reacted positively to Elliott's appearance, stating that both Perry and Elliott \"deserved 110 million pairs of eyes on them\". Amanda Michelle Steiner of \"People\" wrote: \"Katy Perry fan or not, even the most cynical hater would have to admit that her Super Bowl performance on Sunday was a pop culture masterpiece.\" Jon Caramanica of \"The New York Times\" felt that Perry \"benefited far more\" from Elliott's appearance than Kravitz, adding that Elliott's songs \"easily doubled the energy onstage\".\nAt the 67th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards on September 12, 2015, the halftime show won the awards for Outstanding Lighting Design/Lighting Direction for a Variety Special and Outstanding Costumes for a Variety Program or Special. The halftime show was also nominated for Outstanding Short-Format Live-Action Entertainment Program.\nCommercial impact.\nAccording to Nielsen ratings, the halftime show was seen by 118.5 million viewers, an increase of three million over Bruno Mars' Super Bowl XLVIII performance. In comparison, the Super Bowl telecast as a whole had an average viewership of 114.4 million (credited as the second-most watched program in American television history), and peaked at 120.8 million during the fourth quarter.\nFollowing the halftime show, all three of the songs performed by Missy Elliott entered the top twenty singles list on iTunes, and later reached the top ten. \"Billboard\" reported that industry sources expected Perry's songs to collectively sell around 100,000 downloads as a result of the performance, while Elliott's songs were predicted to sell up to 70,000 downloads, which would be an increase of more than 1,000% from the previous week (where Elliott sold 6,000 song downloads). For the week ending February 1, 2015, Perry's discography registered a 92% sales gain in the United States, selling 121,000 albums and song downloads in total. Meanwhile, Elliot's albums and song downloads sold 73,000, up 996% from the previous week.\nLeft Shark.\n During Perry's performance of \"Teenage Dream\" and \"California Gurls\", she was accompanied by several dancers in various beach-themed costumes, including two dressed as sharks. Left Shark, on house left, to Perry's right (stage right), received significant fan and media attention during and after the halftime performance because of its distinct dance moves, which were both offbeat and out of sync with the \"Right Shark\". Left Shark quickly became an Internet sensation, appearing on social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter and also became an internet meme. The identities of both sharks were later revealed to be Perry's longtime background dancers Scott Myrick (Right Shark) and Bryan Gaw (Left Shark).\nVarious other elements of Perry's performance, such as her entrance on a mechanical lion, her costumes, and her exit on a flying star (which itself was compared to the former logo of NBC's PSA segments \"The More You Know\"), were all incorporated into humorous images on social media.\nOrganizing choreographer RJ Durell stated that the dancers, both long-time stage performers from Perry's past concerts, were not given rigorous choreography but instead told to mimic Perry's moves. In an interview with \"The Hollywood Reporter\", Durell said that the Left Shark's performance was intentional, stating their objectives were to \"perform Katy's trademark moves to the 'Teenage Dream' chorus, which they both did perfectly\" and \"have loads of fun, and bring to life these characters in a cartoon manner, giving them a Tweedledee/Tweedledum-type persona\".\nSuper Bowl halftime show director Hamish Hamilton later said that the Left Shark performance was inspired by a Scissor Sisters performance in the 2005 Brit Awards, where the group played \"Take Your Mama\" in front of a surreal farmyard with massive bird-like puppets. Hamilton stated that, \"We were trying to work out how we could bring a beach scene to life and so one of the references that we looked at was that Scissor Sisters performance. The genesis of the Left Shark was actually a singing melon.\"\nAfter the Super Bowl, lawyers for Perry began trying to obtain a copyright for Left Shark and also sought trademark protection. Specifically, they tried to register Left Shark as a trademark with the USPTO. Perry's team also sought to register \"Right Shark\", \"Drunk Shark\", and \"Basking Shark\". The U.S. Trademark Office rejected her initial attempt to register \"Left Shark\". Her team initiated litigation against an Orlando, Florida, artist named Fernando Sosa, who had been making 3-D figurines of Left Shark.\nSet list.\nSet list adapted from \"Billboard\"."

Despite what many believed was a better performance by Sarita Devi, all three ringside judges ruled in favor of her opponent, leading to a 0–3 decision. The decision, which drew huge criticism, left Sarita Devi in a state of shock and she was seen weeping inconsolably. Sarita Devi stunned officials and spectators by refusing to accept the bronze medal during the medal ceremony. Devi initially took her bronze medal and placed it around Park Jin-a's neck. After reluctantly receiving her medal back from Park Jin-a, Devi left the medal on the podium after the conclusion of the ceremony."

Archer was a three-year starter for the Big Red football team at Cornell University, serving as team captain during his senior season, before graduating with a degree in economics in 2005.\nCoaching career.\nIn 2006, while teaching fourth and eighth grades in Newark, New Jersey as part of Teach For America, Archer was an assistant coach at Fairleigh Dickinson–Florham, before returning to Cornell as an assistant.\nIn January 2013, Archer was appointed as Cornell's head coach. At just 30 years old, Archer was the youngest head college football coach in NCAA Division I at the time of his appointment. Archer took over a team that had not managed a winning season since 2005.\nThe Big Red managed just five wins in Archer's first three seasons. Results started to improve in 2016, highlighted by Cornell's first away win against a ranked opponent since 1950 when the team overcame a 23-point deficit to defeat No. 25 Colgate. However, the Big Red could not get over the hump, managing just one .500 season in Archer's ten seasons in charge and never managing more than three Ivy League wins in a season.\nFollowing the 2023 season, Cornell athletics director Nicki Moore announced that Archer would not return to the head coaching role for the 2024 season. Archer was the longest-tenured head coach at Cornell since George K. James (1947–60)."

The event was won by Daniel Morelon of France, successfully defending his 1968 title and becoming the first man to win three medals in the event (with his 1964 bronze). It was France's seventh gold medal in the event, most in the world. Silver went to John Nicholson of Australia, taking the nation's first medal in the men's sprint since 1956. Omar Pkhakadze, who had finished fourth in 1968, won the bronze this time for the Soviet Union's first medal in the event. Italy's six-Games medal streak was broken.\nBackground.\nThis was the 15th appearance of the event, which has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1904 and 1912. Two quarterfinalists from 1968 returned: gold medalist (and 1964 bronze medalist) Daniel Morelon of France and fourth-place finisher Omar Pkhakadze of the Soviet Union. Morelon was heavily favored to repeat, with three world championships and two Grand Prix de Paris wins since his 1968 gold medal.\nThe Bahamas and Malaysia each made their debut in the men's sprint; East Germany competed separately for the first time. France made its 15th appearance, the only nation to have competed at every appearance of the event.\nCompetition format.\nThis sprint competition involved a series of head-to-head matches. The 1972 competition involved ten rounds: six main rounds (first round, second round, 1/8 finals, quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals) as well as three repechages after the first three main rounds; the third repechage was a two-round repechage.\nRecords.\nThe records for the sprint are 200 metre flying time trial records, kept for the qualifying round in later Games as well as for the finish of races.\nNo new world or Olympic records were set during the competition."

Argentina also participated as a touring side, along with Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Romania, Samoa, South Africa and the USA.\nFrance and New Zealand contested the Dave Gallaher Trophy for the first time, in a two-match series. New Zealand took a 1–0 series lead in the first match at the Stade de France in Paris, with France levelling the series after a 42–33 win in Marseille – the first ever test match in the Stade Vélodrome. New Zealand won the trophy on account of their higher aggregate score over the two matches.\nThe match between England and Australia saw the Six Nations champions play the Tri-Nations champions. England won thanks to an injury-time try by Dan Luger, and claimed the Cook Cup for the first time. It was England's first victory over Australia in the professional era.\nDays later, England's players went on strike over a dispute with the Rugby Football Union over pay. This nearly led to coach Clive Woodward selecting a second-choice squad for the following weekend's match against Argentina, but the disagreement was ultimately resolved and the strike ended in time for the affected players to be selected."

        "title": "Concerns and controversies at the 2014 Asian Games",
        "text": "A number of concerns and controversies surfaced before, during and after the 2014 Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea.\nPrior to the Games.\nSponsorship and organization.\nThe Games were hit by lack of sponsorship and a lack of interest from the public with only 18% of the tickets for the opening ceremony sold a week before the Games. Sales of tickets for rhythmic gymnast Son Yeon-jae and badminton star Lee Yong-dae's events were fast, while sales for the football competition were just seven percent and athletics eight percent. Organizers were able to generate more interest but there were a few hundred empty seats in the 61,000-capacity stadium at the start of the opening ceremony. There was a shortage of free shuttles provided for journalists and athletes in the days leading up to the Games. Organizers supplied more shuttle buses for the late-night shifts at the request of various international media organizations.\nWhen the identity of the final torch bearer was revealed to be the actress Lee Young-ae, there were mixed reactions in the local press as she had no direct ties to sports. However, she ultimately passed the torch to a pair of young South Korean athletes and the three lighted the cauldron in unison.\nNationality issues.\nIn basketball, Olympic Council of Asia's eligibility rule on naturalized players, which contradicted the eligibility rule set by FIBA, became controversial as such rule disqualified Quincy Davis, a US-born player playing for the Chinese Taipei team, and Andray Blatche, a naturalized player of the Philippines, from participating in the tournament. In accordance with the rule, OCA also refused South Korea's request to include Aaron Haynes in the squad, an American veteran player in Korea's basketball league who was in the process of naturalization. Both OCA officials and IAGOC claimed that the OCA's eligibility rule requires a naturalized player to live minimum of three years in the country of his naturalization before becoming eligible to play for that country. Nevertheless, Chinese Taipei Basketball Association stated that it received the positive confirmation from OCA regarding the participation of Quincy Davis, which was suddenly overturned due to the fact that Davis was two months short from residing three full years in Chinese Taipei. Many basketball fans argued that the host nation South Korea brought up the regulation rule at the last minute in order to not allow enough time for its major opponents to reconstruct their squads. Meanwhile, South Korea claimed it was just enforcing the OCA's regulation and the South Korean team themselves were also negatively affected by the rule. Despite the request of FIBA to reconsider the enforcement of the eligibility rule, both OCA and the organizing committee upheld their decision.\nFemale participants and FIBA ban on hijab.\nSaudi Arabia was the only participating NOC to not send female athletes to the Games despite international pressure from organizations including the Human Rights Watch. The country was accused of taking a step backwards from the 2012 Summer Olympics, the first time in Olympics history that Saudi Arabia lifted its ban on female participation. Mohammed al-Mishal, the secretary-general of Saudi Arabia's Olympic Committee, stated that women weren't included because none have reached the level for international competition. A member of the Saudi Olympic committee later stated that the country plans to send women to compete at the 2016 Summer Olympics.\nQatar women's basketball team was hit by FIBA ban on Muslim headscarf, known as hijab. They were scheduled to play Mongolia but were disallowed. The team eventually withdrew from the tournament, refusing to remove the hijab. FIBA claimed the ban was made due to safety concerns. Qatar officials said the decision was insulting, disrespectful of the religion, and nonsensical as combat sports allow the hijab. One player stated that they had been assured well before the Games that they would be able to wear hijab.\nCycling venue.\nIn cycling, Hong Kong cyclists had raised concerns after they found the competition venue would be an outdoor velodrome of 333 metres in length, instead of a 250 metres indoor velodrome, which is commonly in use during the Olympic Games and the World Cup. Hong Kong Cycling Association claimed that outdoor velodromes are rare in modern cycling and they have to travel far to practice in a similar environment. The organising committee denied any advantage to the host nation. They also claimed that the track was re-coated and received approval from Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI).\nOpening ceremony programme.\nThe 2014 Asian Games opening ceremony was criticised by local media for featuring more celebrities and K-pop stars than sports figures, failing to display the legacy of the event or Incheon city's culture and abasing the sports stars' presence at the event. Despite executive director Jang Jin's promise that the main characters ― Jang Dong-gun and Kim Soo-hyun would have the roles of storytellers, their presence was overshadowed by the performances of boy band JYJ and singer Psy.\nCompetition issues.\nWomen's 10 meter air-rifle.\nThe Chinese team was initially disqualified after shooter Zhang Binbin was found to have violated regulations concerning maximum weight limits of her rifle. The disqualification was eventually reversed after a strong appeal by Chinese officials arguing that Zhang \"didn't intend to break the rule\". This allowed China to retain their team gold and a new world record. This led to a series of allegations that members of jury favoured Zhang.\nBadminton.\nIn badminton, Chinese coach Li Yongbo accused the hosts of manipulating the wind in the stadium, after China was defeated by South Korea in the final of the men's team event. Yongbo said, \"We did not lose because of technique or tactics, but due to some man-made reasons. The South Koreans deliberately controlled the wind blow in the stadium and took advantage of it.\" Japanese coach Keita Masuda also alleged a similar case saying, \"The wind in this stadium is very strange, always supporting the hosts. Every time we change sides, the wind seems to change sides as well.\" Thailand's Ratchanok Intanon, a former world champion, also went on to blame the \"strangely strong winds\" for her defeat in the quarterfinals of the women's singles event against a South Korean opponent.\nBoxing officiating.\nIndian lightweight boxer Laishram Sarita Devi lost a highly controversial 60 kg semi-final bout against eventual silver medalist Park Jina of South Korea. Despite what many believed was a better performance by Sarita Devi, all three ringside judges ruled in favor of her opponent, leading to a 0–3 decision. The ringside judges were Braham Mohamad of Tunisia, Albino Foti of Italy, and Mariusz Josef Gorny of Poland. The decision, which drew huge criticism, left Sarita Devi in a state of shock and she was seen weeping inconsolably. Indian Olympic Association (IOA) office-bearers chose not to involve themselves with the situation, leaving Sarita Devi and her husband Thoiba Singh to lodge the protests by themselves. They were unable to pay the USD$500 fee to lodge an official protest against AIBA until Sarita's coach Lenin Meitei and an Indian journalist paid the amount on their behalf. Sarita Devi stunned officials and spectators by refusing to accept the bronze medal during the medal ceremony. Devi initially took her bronze medal and placed it around Park Jina's neck. After reluctantly receiving her medal back from Park Jina, Devi left the medal on the podium after the conclusion of the ceremony. In interviews following the incident, Sarita Devi stated, \"It was a protest for all the sportsmen and women of the world against injustice in sport\". She also criticized Indian officials by stating, \"It has been 24 hours and not one official has come to speak with me and ask me if I am fine. They just come here to take photos with medalists and nothing else.\" AIBA opened disciplinary proceedings against Sarita for returning her medal and Adille Sumariwalla, the head of the Indian Mission, criticized Sarita Devi for her behavior. The following day, Sarita Devi offered an unconditional apology to AIBA for her emotional outbreak during the medal ceremony. She also expressed regret for her actions at the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) hearing and the governing body reinstated Sarita Devi's bronze medal.\nShortly after Sarita Devi's controversial loss, Mongolian boxer Nyambayaryn Tögstsogt lost a controversial bout against South Korean Ham Sang-myeong in the 56 kg category. Nyambayar stayed in the ring for 5 minutes, protesting the results. The referees were booed by the crowd, and several Mongolian coaches arranged for a protest to be held.\nIn women's 57 kg, Thai boxer Sopida Satumrum lost a highly contentious decision to China's Si Haijuan. Two of the three judges scored a 38–38 draw while the third judge ruled 39–37 in favor of the Thai. Under AIBA guidelines, the bout was declared a draw and the decision was deferred to a panel of five judges, which requires a majority decision. The five judges declared Si the winner of the bout. Satumrum burst into tears after the result was announced and stated, \"this is very cruel to me because I did much better than my opponent. I am 100% sure that I won.\" Thai officials filed an official protest but organizers dismissed it saying the decision is beyond contention.\nMen's football.\nWorawi Makudi, the president of Football Association of Thailand, criticized the referees for making mistakes during the semi-final match between South Korea and Thailand. Coach Kiatisuk Senamuang voiced displeasure about the penalty kick awarded to South Korea following a foul outside the penalty area, which directly led to its second goal at the 45+1' minute mark. Controversy continued as a South Korean defender used his arm to block the movement of the ball twice inside South Korea's penalty area. No call was not made on the handballs. South Korea won the match 2–0. Makudi stated that he would take the matter to the Asian Football Confederation but no official protest was lodged as of 4 October, the conclusion of the Games.\nMen's 71 kg Greco-Roman wrestling.\nIranian wrestler Saeid Abdevali had defeated South Korean wrestler Jung Ji-hyun in the semifinal of men's 71 kg Greco-Roman event. The winner was declared to be Abdevali, but the Korean officials protested the result following which Jung Ji-hyun was declared the winner. Jung Ji-hyun went on to win the gold medal, while Abdevali was forced to settle for bronze.\nAlleged misbehaviour of athletes.\nThe organiser claimed that the misbehaviour of some of the athletes such as smoking and causing damage to property during the competition resulted in the Malaysian delegation being fined RM143,000 (US$40,000). Sepak takraw, along with bowling, sailing and rugby sevens were among the sports in which athletes incurred fines. However, this was denied by the Malaysian Tenpin Bowling Congress (MTBC), saying that the damage was not caused by their athletes because they were not staying in the damaged room reported by the organiser.\nDoping.\nOver 1,920 samples from 1,600 athletes were tested during the Games. Six athletes tested positive for banned substances and were sent home from the Games.\nOn 14 September, five days before the opening ceremony, Tajikistan footballer Khurshed Beknazarov tested positive for methylhexanamine. He was subsequently suspended from all football activity for 30 days. On 25 September, Cambodian soft tennis player Yi Sophany was found positive for sibutramine. Sophany suspected that Sting, her favorite energy drink may have been the cause of her positive doping test results. The doping committee informed her that sibutramine can be found on energy drinks. On 30 September, Malaysian wushu gold medalist Tai Cheau Xuen also tested positive for sibutramine. She was stripped of her gold medal. Malaysian officials appealed against the disqualification but the appeal was dismissed by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The same day, Iraqi weightlifter Mohammed al Aifuri tested for positive for etiocholanolone and androsterone. It was his second failed drug test in six years. He faces a ban by the International Weightlifting Federation (IWF), which had banned him once before in 2008 for taking metandienone. On 1 October, Syrian karate fighter Nour-Aldin al-Kurdi tested positive for clenbuterol. On 3 October, Chinese hammer thrower Zhang Wenxiu became the second gold medalist to be stripped of their gold medal after testing positive for zeranol.\nHowever, on 6 May 2015, Zhang's gold medal was returned after further testing performed by independent specialists that the presence zeranol was the consequence of the consumption of contaminated food."

        "text": "Motocross Madness is a motocross racing video game that was developed by Austrian studio Bongfish and published by Microsoft Studios. It was released on April 10, 2013 on Xbox Live Arcade. It is a sequel to two Microsoft Windows games, 1998's \"Motocross Madness\" and 2000's \"Motocross Madness 2\", which were developed by Rainbow Studios, who have since moved on to making the \"MX vs. ATV\" series.\nThe game received \"mixed or average\" reviews according to review aggregator Metacritic, and holds a score of 73 out of 100. It was delisted from Xbox Live in August 2016. Reviewers found the gameplay engaging, but reception to the inclusion of Xbox 360 avatars was mixed. Critics were mostly unified in saying that the game was a good value for its 800 Microsoft Point cost.\nGameplay.\n\"Motocross Madness\" is a motocross racing video game. It features three open worlds, which are fictional representations of Egypt, Australia and Iceland. Each location can be freely ridden, or players can complete races on circuits within each environment. Each motorcycle is equipped with a boost system which recharges over time. Multiplayer is available locally for two players via split-screen, or can be played online. Also featured is a rivals mode, where players can compete for best race times against other players. The game makes use of the Xbox 360 avatars as the player characters.\nPlayers can use button combinations to perform tricks while in the air. Xbox 360 avatar rewards can be earned through gameplay, and via the Avatar Famestars program, which awards players Famestar Points for completing in-game tasks across various titles, including \"Motocross Madness\". Motorcycles can be upgraded with various parts via the in-game shop. Coins for upgrades can be earned in races or by finding them while exploring the open worlds. Six motorcycles are available for purchase and upgrades.\nDevelopment and release.\nThe game was first teased in May 2012 via Microsoft's PlayXBLA blog. Two screenshots were shown which featured the environment and Xbox 360 avatars on motorcycles. In June 2012 at the Electronics Entertainment Expo (E3), Microsoft announced that a new \"Motocross Madness\" game entitled \"Avatar Motocross Madness\" would be released for Xbox Live Arcade in the future. The title was changed to just \"Motocross Madness\" in 2013, to be released on April 10. It was published by Microsoft Game Studios and developed by Austrian studio Bongfish who also developed another avatar-based game for the Xbox 360, \"Red Bull Crashed Ice Kinect\".\n\"Motocross Madness\" was available free of charge for Xbox Live Gold members as part of the Games with Gold program between August 1 through 15, 2014. In December 2015, the game was made backwards compatible with Xbox One. It was delisted from Xbox Live in August 2016 for undisclosed reasons.\nReception.\n\"Motocross Madness\" received \"mixed or average\" reviews according to review aggregator Metacritic, and holds a score of 73 out of 100. Scores ranged from a 50% approval from \"D+Pad Magazine\" to a 90% approval from Console Monster. Based on Xbox Live Arcade leaderboards, the game had moved 21,848 units during the month of its release.\nCritics gave generally positive commentary on \"Motocross Madness\"s gameplay. Leif Johnson of GameSpot enjoyed the game's trick system, and that it would build up a boost meter, which he also found fun to use. Andy Mahood felt that the controls were \"loose and easy, and the open-sandbox format, with its multiple paths and shortcuts, delivers a unique experience every time out.\" Eurogamer Italia's Recensione di Francesco Serino felt that the gameplay was fast and agile. Serino did not like the music selections. \"Official Xbox Magazine\"s Cameron Lewis said players will \"ace every event in a handful of hours without much difficulty.\"\nReception on the use of Xbox 360 avatars was generally mixed. Alice Bell of \"Official Xbox Magazine UK\" felt that the presence of \"credible\" motorcycle models and avatars was \"jarring\". GameSpot's Leif Johnson agreed. He called the combination an \"awkward juggle of realism and cartoony aesthetics.\" In contrast Andy Mahood of IGN felt that his avatar was \"it was a pleasant surprise to see\" in the game. Recensione di Francesco Serino from Eurogamer Italia also appreciated seeing his own avatar in the game, and noted that players could choose to be dressed as \"Halo\" protagonist Master Chief if they chose to.\nMost reviewers felt that the game was a good value for its price of 800 Microsoft Points. Recensione di Francesco Serino from Eurogamer Italia stated that the game would be a good value to many, if not all players. IGN's Andy Mahood describes its price-to-value as a \"cheap and engaging two-wheeled experience.\" Alice Bell agreed, and noted that the game was full of content for its price. She said \"So much content has been wrung out of this game that there's even a reward for the number of miles you bail out of jumps.\" Official Xbox Magazine's Cameron Lewis felt that the price \"buys at least a few afternoons of enjoyable airborne antics.\""

        "text": "George Alfred Tyler (10 February 187915 April 1942) was a New Zealand rugby union player who represented New Zealandthe \"All Blacks\"between 1903 and 1906. He played in New Zealand's first seven Test matches, including all five Tests on the pioneering Original All Blacks 1905–06 tour of the British Isles and France. He played club rugby for City in Auckland, and was selected for his province between 1899 and 1911. His brother Bill Tyler also played rugby for City and Auckland before switching codes and representing New Zealand at rugby league.\nBiography.\nPlaying at hooker, Tyler played for the City club in Auckland, and with them won seven senior Auckland championships between 1900 and 1911. From there he was selected for Auckland starting in 1899, and continued to represent his province until 1911. Tyler was first selected for New Zealand for their 1903 tour of Australia. Tyler played in all eleven of the sides matches, including the game against Wellington immediately before their departure. The team won all ten of their Australian matches, including winning their first ever Test matchagainst Australia in Sydney. Tyler was one of only four players, and only two forwards, that played all ten matches.\nThe following year Tyler played for Auckland in the first ever Ranfurly Shield matchwhich Auckland lost to Wellington. He then played for New Zealand in their first ever home Test matchagainst the British Isles. The British side were touring New Zealand and Australia, and had gone through their Australian-leg unbeaten before facing New Zealand in Wellington. The New Zealanders won 9–3 to inflict the first defeat on the British. A week later Tyler was in the Auckland team that faced the tourists. The result was an even more comprehensive victory, with Tyler and the other forwards dominating their opponents.\nHe was selected for the historic tour to the British Isles and France in 1905. The side played five Testsagainst Scotland, Ireland, England, the famous \"Match of the Century\" against Wales and Francewith Tyler appearing in all of them. The only loss of the 35 match tour matches was the Welsh Test match, a narrow and controversial 3–0 loss. Tyler appeared in 23 of the tour matches, but is most notably remembered for shaking the hands with King Edward VII. Eight of the All Blacks met King Edward VII while visiting a cattle show in Islington, with the monarch shaking Tyler's hand and congratulating him on the team's success. He was selected for the All Blacks again in 1907, but declined to play because of work commitments. He continued to play rugby for Auckland until 1911, and was also involved in swimming, rowing and yachting.\nTyler died at his home in Auckland on 15 April 1942, and was buried at Waikaraka Cemetery."

        "text": "The 2015 IPC Athletics World Championships were a Paralympic track and field meet organized by the World Para Athletics subcommittee of the International Paralympic Committee. The event was the 7th edition of what is now known as the World Para Athletics Championships, held from 21 to 31 October 2015 at the Suheim Bin Hamad Stadium in Doha, Qatar. It featured 119 men's events and 91 women's events. The Marathon events which are traditionally part of the world championships were separated from the competition and instead held on 26 April as part of the London Marathon.\nVenues.\nIn January 2013 the IPC announced that Doha would hold the 2015 athletics world championships. In March 2014 the Suhaim Bin Hamad Stadium, a 15,000-seat venue with an eight-lane track, was confirmed as the host of the event which would take place between 19 and 28 November. However the championships were moved forward by a month to 22 October to avoid construction work around the city. In October 2014 it was decided that the Marathon events would be held separately. The marathon was staged on 26 April at the 2015 London Marathon.\nCoverage.\nThe International Paralympic Committee provided live video coverage of over 70 hours of events on its website, as well as live coverage, videos of events and interviews on its ParalympicSportTV channel on YouTube.\nIn the United Kingdom, Channel 4's sister channel More4 aired live coverage daily throughout the Championship.\nCoverage in Germany was streamed live on www.deutsche-paralympische-mannschaft.de with further availability on the German Olympic Sports Confederation (DOSB) sports channel.\nFormat.\nThe qualification period for the championships lasted from 1 January 2014 to 31 August 2015 with a maximum of three athletes from each nation qualifying for each individual event. Each athlete was required to meet at least the B qualification standards in one IPC approved event. Athletes were required to enter at least one individual event to be able to participate in relays. However, in events where classes are combined each nation may send a maximum of five qualifying athletes.\nThe marathon events were held separately, taking place on 26 April, the reason given was that the London Marathon would give a better schedule for the athletes. The qualifying period for the marathon events were run between 1 January 2014 to 9 February 2015. All athletes were required to meet the minimum qualifying time to be able to participate having achieved the time at an IPC approved event. Up to six athletes from one country were allowed to compete in each class for the marathon. A maximum of two guide runners per an athlete were allowed for the T11 and 12 classes.\nSchedule.\nThe marathon events for both women and men took part outside the main championship in Doha and were contested as part of the 2015 London Marathon. Unlike the previous Championship in Lyon, no events were contested across disability classifications, whereby results would be giving a points weighting to determine a winning athlete. Many events are open to athletes with lower classification numbers, who are deemed to have a greater impairment, such as the men's discus F56, which can also be contested by F54 and F55 classification athletes.\nMedal table.\nThe medal table at the end of the competition saw China at its head in both total medal count and gold medals won. The host nation Qatar failed to achieve a medal.\nParticipating nations.\nBelow is the list of countries who agreed to participate in the Championships and the requested number of athlete places for each."

It was home to resident Hounslow Heath Golf Club.\nLocation.\nThe course was situated on the western side of the heath bordered to the west by \"Donkey Wood\" and the River Crane. Part of the course adjacent to the river is liable to flooding. Access is from the A315 Staines Road.\nHistory.\nAfter World War II gravel was extracted from the site and subsequently used for landfill until the late 1960s. The golf course was established in 1977. The course was designed by Fraser Middleton and opened in 1979. Operation of the course was leased to \"Parpost Ltd\" in 2005 and \"John Laing Integrated Services\" prior to that. Usage declined from 25,000 rounds of golf played in 2004 to below 10,000 in 2012, leading to a decision to sell. The golf course went on the market in April 2014 with planning permission to extend the clubhouse, develop a driving bay and potential to expand use of the site to include other leisure activities.\nClosure.\nThe course was closed by Hounslow Borough Council on 30 September 2016. The number of rounds played had been declining for some time (see above), and the council was incurring high costs in subsidising the continued presence of golf at the site .\nCurrent plans anticipate re-development of the site to provide \"a re-modelled 9 hole academy style golf course with new clubhouse, 30 bay driving range, an 18 hole adventure golf course, a unique children’s adventure park\", the latter called Hobbbler's Heath .\nCourse.\nThe course comprised eighteen holes in two loops of nine with four par 3, thirteen par 4 and one par 5. Holes 10–13 were located to the north of the A315 accessed via an underpass. \nThe course and adjacent heath are designated Metropolitan Green Belt and a Local Nature Reserve and form part of the \"Hounslow Gravels Natural Landscape Area\".\nOther facilities.\nThe facilities included a Café, retail area, greenkeepers’ office and large car park. A small practice ground and a practice putting green were situated near to the clubhouse and first tee."

No champion for college baseball was determined until 1893, and it would not be until 1947 that the College World Series began.\nPrograms.\nWhile many institutions had baseball teams, only three colleges fielded intercollegiate teams in 1860, with one game involving a preparatory school. The collegiate teams were:\nFirst game.\nThe first game between teams composed completely of players enrolled at separate colleges was held on July 1, 1859, between and in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. The game was held using Massachusetts rules, and Amherst won 73–32. The game was loosely similar to modern baseball, with no foul territory, no called strikes, and only one out per inning. Despite the score, the game took just three and a half hours to play.\nSecond game.\nThe first game to be held using Knickerbocker Rules, largely used today, was held on November 3, 1859, between the Fordham Rose Hill Baseball Club (known today as Fordham University) and St. Francis Xavier.

        "text": "The Australian cricket team toured India from February to April 1998 for a three Test series and an ODI tri-series featuring Australia, India and Zimbabwe.\nBackground.\nEntering the 1997-98 tour of India, Australia had not won a series in that country since Bill Lawry's team recorded a 3–1 series win in 1969-70.\nWhen the Australian squad was announced only 8 of the touring party of 15 had played a Test match in India previously including only two of the bowlers, Paul Reiffel and Shane Warne. Missing from the previous series against South Africa were Matthew Elliott, Andy Bichel, Michael Bevan, (all dropped) and Glenn McGrath (injured).\nShane Warne caused something of a stir before the series began by stating that he was \"not a fan of exotic cuisine\", which prompted Qantas, the Australian national airline, to fly in 1,900 tins of baked beans and spaghetti for the team.\nTest series.\nFirst Test.\nThe Indian openers started the first innings at a steady pace and put on a hundred run opening stand before Mongia was caught at the wicket on 58 in the 43rd over when the score had reached 122. A mini-collapse followed with Sidhu, run out for 62 and Tendulkar falling quickly with India then finding themselves at 130/3. Dravid was resolute with a patient 52 from 169 balls, but of the rest of the batsmen only Azharuddin with 26 and Kumble with 30 reached double figures. The last five wickets fell for the addition of only 10 runs. Shane Warne and Gavin Robertson shared the bowling honours for the visitors with 4 wickets each.\nAustralia began its run-chase slowly and lost a steady stream of wickets with only Mark Waugh of the top-order batsmen making more than 50. When Warne fell in the 80th over Australia were 201/8, and it appeared that the first innings scores would be close. However, Healy's 90 and Robertson's 57 on debut pushed the score to a total of 328, from 130.3 overs, a lead of 71 on the first innings. Kumble was the pick of the bowlers with 4/103.\nIndia erased Australia's lead for the loss of only Mongia. When Sidhu departed with India effectively 2-44 Australia had a hope of dismissing India for a low score and pushing for a win. But Dravid was joined by Tendulkar and the pair added 113 for the 3rd wicket. This was followed by 127 for the 4th wicket partnership between Tendulkar and Azharuddin, and then another 63 for the 5th between Tendulkar and Ganguly. Azharuddin declared the innings closed at 418/4 with 15 overs left to be played on the 4th day.\nAustralia was set a target of 348 to win in the fourth innings of the match from approximately 107 overs. This was the same target required by India in the Tied Test at the same ground in 1986.\nAustralia started badly and lost Slater, Blewett and Taylor cheaply to end day 4 at 31/3, still needing 317 runs to win with 7 wickets in hand. On the 5th day Australia, offered little resistance and only Steve Waugh, Healey and Warne passed 20. Australia were eventually dismissed for 168, giving India a win in the first Test by 179 runs. Kumble again took 4 wickets in the innings to be by far the best bowler in the match.\nSecond Test.\nAustralia were in trouble from the start of their innings with Srinath taking two wickets in the opening over of the Test, only the second such instance (prev. SJ Snooke, South Africa v England at Cape Town, 1909–10). With the dismissal of Mark Taylor in the 10th over Australia found themselves at 29/4. Steve Waugh with 80, and Ricky Ponting with 60 helped restore some respectability to the score although Australia were dismissed just before stumps on the first day for 233.\nIndia then proceeded to dominate the Australian attack for 159 overs, scoring at close to 4 runs per over. All top six batsmen scored more than sixty although Mohammad Azharuddin was the only one to pass a hundred; he remained 163 not out when he declared India's innings closed at 633/5, their highest ever score against Australia.\nIn reply Australia's batsmen struggled against Anil Kumble and with only five of them reaching double figures Australia was dismissed for 181 runs in 88.4 overs. Kumble finished the innings with five wickets, taking his series total to 16 in the two matches played. India's win, by an innings and 219 runs, remains its best win ever against Australia and ranks 4th all-time in losses (by an innings) suffered by Australia.\nThird Test.\nAustralia went into the Third test of the series with a number of injury concerns: Steve Waugh had not recovered from an injury sustained during the Second test and was replaced by Darren Lehmann in his first Test; Paul Reiffel and Paul Wilson had returned home so Adam Dale came into the attack. India's Javagal Srinath had a side strain and was unable to take his place. In addition, Rajesh Chauhan was omitted to be replaced by the 17-year-old Harbhajan Singh.\nOn a slow pitch India started steadily reaching 290/4 at the close of the first day's play, Sachin Tendulkar on 117 not out, his second century of the series. Shane Warne bowled better than he had all series and with his second wicket, bowling Rahul Dravid, his became the most successful Test spin bowler at that time, surpassing Lance Gibbs's record of 309 wickets. Tendulkar scored 177 for the hosts, and Dale and Warne each took 3 wickets as India finished at 424 from 123.2 overs.\nAustralia's innings was similar to India's, in that the progress was brisk (3.58 runs per over) and one player, Mark Waugh, stood out from the rest with 153 not out when the innings closed at 400 exactly. Michael Slater was out for 91, one of nine occasions in which he was dismissed in the \"nervous nineties\" in Test cricket.\nAt 92/2 in their second innings India appeared to be in relative control. However, they then proceeded to lose their last 8 wickets for only 77 runs, setting Australia a target of 194 runs for a consolation victory. Australia reached the required figure in 58 overs for the loss of only Slater and Greg Blewett. Mark Taylor timed his innings to perfection, reaching 102 not out at the end of the match."

        "title": "Aluminum fencing",
        "text": "An aluminum fence is a fence constructed primarily out of the element aluminium. Due to the metal’s low density and ability to resist corrosion, it has become a popular choice as lightweight, durable fence and railing structure.\nAluminum fencing is used for both commercial and residential use. Aluminum fence is generally available preformed, in a wide variety of styles. It tends to be easy to clean, resists weathering and has low maintenance requirements. It can also be more cost-efficient than comparable materials, such as wrought iron and steel.\nMany aluminum fences have rackable fence panels. Depending on the brand of fence, panels are designed to rack anywhere from 4 inches to 24 inches over 6 feet. The amount a fence panel can rack is determined by the size of hole punched on the horizontal rails to accommodate pickets. The fence can then adjust to the slope of your land, meaning there will be no gaps at the bottom of the fence on uneven or sloping ground. This will accommodate all but the steepest grades.\nAluminum fences are made in a wide range of sizes and shapes. They come in many different colors, which are applied using a powder coating. The coating is applied through an electrostatic process and cured under heat to form a strong smooth surface. The powder coating adheres to aluminum better than paint or other coatings. It has the ability to withstand harsh conditions including extreme heat and cold. Its weather resistant quality leads many manufacturers to offer very long warranties, from decades up to \"lifetime\" for some brands.\nAluminum fence materials are often in the form of rigid rails or posts, but flexible forms are also used. Aluminum fences are made in multiple grades ranging from light weight residential to heavy weight industrial. \nAluminum fencing didn’t become popular in the residential world until 10–15 years ago as it was more expensive and the benefits were lesser known. Over the past 5 years, many residential neighborhood Home Owners Associations began requiring aluminum fencing due to its uniform look from home to home. As it requires little to no maintenance and does not rust, the fences remain “new” in appearance for many years.\nAluminum fences can be used for Privacy fencing, to provide privacy and security; Pool fencing; Decorative or ornamental fencing, to enhance the appearance of a property; Boundary fencing, to demarcate a piece of real property (link), or Perimeter fencing, to prevent children and/or pets from wandering away"

        "text": "In cricket, a five-wicket haul (also known as a \"five–for\" or \"fifer\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a significant achievement, and there have been only 10 instances of a bowler taking a fifer in ICC Champions Trophy tournaments. The ICC Champions Trophy is a One Day International (ODI) tournament organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC), and is considered the second most significant after the World Cup. Originally inaugurated as the \"ICC Knock Out Trophy\" in 1998, the tournament has been organised every two or three years since.\n, 11 players from 7 different nations have taken fifers. South Africa's Jacques Kallis was the first to take a five-wicket haul in the tournament, while playing against West Indies in the final of the inaugural edition. His bowling figures of 5 wickets for 30 runs in the final helped South Africa win the tournament. The figures also secured a place in the \"Top 100 bowling performances of all-time\", a list released by the \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" in 2002. As of 2013, the South Africans have taken the most fifers with three followed by the Australians and the New Zealanders with two. India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka each have one, while Bangladesh, England and Zimbabwe are yet to see a player take a fifer in the tournament. Sri Lanka's Farveez Maharoof holds the record for the best bowling figures: 6 wickets for 14 runs – also his career best figures – against West Indies in the 2006 tournament. Australia's Josh Hazlewood is the most recent player to take a fifer. His figures of 6 wickets for 52 runs came against New Zealand in 2017."

Ken was a product of the Marrickville De La Salle College and the Addison Royals (Marrickville) junior rugby league club.\nWilson only gradually established in first grade – in a famous match he was the point-scorer with a field goal for the only 1–0 scoreline (against St. George in 1973) – thirteen seconds after coming onto the field. In 1976 Wilson moved to the Penrith Panthers for three seasons. He returned to Newtown in 1979 and stayed with them until the club folded at the end of 1983, being their captain during the final two seasons. Wilson played in Newtown's final ever game in the top grade which was against the Canberra Raiders which Newtown won 9–6 at Campbelltown Stadium. Wilson missed three kicks at goal during the game but kicked a field goal.\nWilson set many point scoring records with both Newtown and Penrith. He ranks first among Newtown's all-time point scorers, with 1001 points. \nWilson came on as a replacement in the 1981 Grand Final, and later coached reserve grade at Canterbury-Bankstown and the Ryde-Eastwood club.\nWith 150 appearances, he is ranked fifth on Newtown's list of most appearances behind Frank Farrell (204), Brian Moore (173), Bobby Whitton (171), and Bobby Keyes (163)."

        "text": "The 2015 Daytona 500, the 57th running of the event, was a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series race which was held on February 22, 2015 at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida. Contested over 203 laps – extended from 200 laps due to a green–white–checker finish – on the asphalt superspeedway, it was the first race of the 2015 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series season. Joey Logano won the race, recording the second Daytona 500 win for Team Penske, and his ninth career Sprint Cup victory. Kevin Harvick finished second while Dale Earnhardt Jr., Denny Hamlin and Jimmie Johnson rounded out the top–five.\nJeff Gordon won the pole for his 23rd and final career start in the Daytona 500. Hendrick Motorsports swept the Budweiser Duel races with Earnhardt Jr. winning the first Duel race and fourth career qualifying race and Johnson winning the second Duel race and second career qualifying race. Gordon led a race-high 87 laps and ran up front for most of the race. He was caught up in the backstretch multi-car wreck on the final lap of the race and finished 33rd. Logano took the lead with 10 laps to go in the scheduled 200 lap distance and was ahead of Kevin Harvick before the last caution flag ended the race in his favor. The race had 27 lead changes among 12 different drivers, as well as 7 caution flag periods for 26 laps. There was also a single red flag period that lasted for 6 minutes and 42 seconds.\nLogano left Daytona with a five-point lead over Harvick in the points standings, while Ford left Daytona with a five-point lead over Chevrolet in the manufacturer standings.\nThe 57th Daytona 500 was carried by Fox Sports on the broadcast Fox network for the American television audience. The radio broadcast for the race was carried by the Motor Racing Network and Sirius XM NASCAR Radio.\nBrothers Kurt Busch and Kyle Busch, mainstays in the Cup Series for over a decade, both missed the race for different reasons, making this event the first race without one of the two since the 2001 NAPA 500. Kurt missed the race after being suspended during a trial for domestic violence, while Kyle suffered a broken right leg and a fractured left foot in a violent crash in the Alert Today Florida 300 the day prior.\nThis marks the final Daytona 500 starts for Sam Hornish Jr., Tony Stewart, Justin Allgaier, and Johnny Sauter.\nReport.\nBackground.\nDaytona International Speedway is a race track in Daytona Beach, Florida, United States. Since opening in 1959, it has been the home of the Daytona 500, the most prestigious race in NASCAR. In addition to NASCAR, the track also hosts races of ARCA, AMA Superbike, USCC, SCCA, and Motocross. The track features multiple layouts including the primary high speed tri-oval, a sports car course, a motorcycle course, and a karting and motorcycle flat-track. The track's infield includes the Lake Lloyd, which has hosted powerboat racing. The speedway is owned and operated by International Speedway Corporation.\nThe track was built to host racing that was being held by NASCAR founder Bill France, Sr. at the former Daytona Beach and Road Course and opened with the first Daytona 500 in 1959. The speedway has been renovated three times, with the infield renovated in 2004, and the track repaved in 1978 and 2010.\nNew rules.\nNASCAR implemented a new camera system to officiate pit road. Forty-five cameras monitor pit road and reduce the number of necessary officials on pit road from 24 to 10. The system was beta tested during the 10 race Chase for the Sprint Cup last season and \"allegedly\" detected a high number of infractions such as driving through more than three stalls to get into or exit one's pit stall. Eight officials monitor the system from a truck outside the track and have the final say on imposing a penalty. With only 10 officials monitoring pit road now, NASCAR no longer penalizes teams for missing or loose lug nuts. The responsibility for having those lug nuts on the car falls on the teams.\nEntry list.\nThe entry list for the 57th running of the Daytona 500 was released on Thursday, February 12, 2015 at 9:22 a.m. Eastern time. Fifty drivers were entered for the race. Joe Nemechek and his No. 87 team later withdrew before qualifying after the team had problems preparing the car. With the Daytona 500 being the first race of the 2015 season, 13 drivers were entered for the race driving for a different team than they had raced for in the 2014 season. Trevor Bayne made his debut with Roush Fenway Racing after spending the last five seasons driving part-time for Wood Brothers Racing. Alex Bowman, who drove for BK Racing in his 2014 rookie campaign, moved to Tommy Baldwin Racing to drive the No. 7 Chevrolet. Sam Hornish Jr. returned to full time in the Sprint Cup Series – his first since 2010 – to drive in the No. 9 Richard Petty Motorsports Ford. He replaced Marcos Ambrose who returned to his native Australia to race in the V8 Supercar Series. Carl Edwards, who drove the last 11 seasons for Roush Fenway Racing, moved to Joe Gibbs Racing to drive the No. 19 Toyota. Ryan Blaney replaced Trevor Bayne in the No. 21 Wood Brothers Racing Ford on a part-time basis. J. J. Yeley moved to the No. 23 BK Racing Toyota that had been driven by Alex Bowman the previous season. Jeb Burton moved up from the Camping World Truck Series to drive the No. 26 BK Racing Toyota. Justin Marks was entered to make his first Sprint Cup Series start in the No. 29 RAB Racing Toyota. Former Camping World Truck Series champion Ron Hornaday Jr. moved up to attempt to run his first full season in the Sprint Cup Series since 2001 in the No. 30 Chevrolet for The Motorsports Group. The 2000 series champion Bobby Labonte took over the seat of the No. 32 Go FAS Racing Ford for the four restrictor plate races. This was a role previously done by his brother Terry Labonte who made his final career start in October 2014 at Talladega. Cole Whitt, who drove the No. 26 BK Racing Toyota in his 2014 rookie campaign, moved to the No. 35 Front Row Motorsports Ford. Reed Sorenson drove the No. 44 Team XTREME Racing Chevrolet. Michael Annett left Tommy Baldwin Racing after his 2014 rookie campaign and moved to HScott Motorsports to drive the No. 46 Chevrolet. Brian Scott was entered in a one race deal to drive the No. 62 Premium Motorsports Chevrolet.\nPractice.\nFirst practice (February 14).\nRicky Stenhouse Jr. was the fastest in the first practice session with a time of 44.413 and a speed of .\nSecond practice (February 14).\nMichael McDowell was the fastest in the second practice session with a time of 45.153 and a speed of . Ryan Newman was forced to change engines after blowing one half an hour into the session. He had to start from the rear in one of the Duel races. Martin Truex Jr. also dealt with engine gremlins due to a crack in his car's oil pan, but did not change engines.\nQualifying.\nThe pole qualifying took place at 1:35 p.m. Eastern time on Sunday, February 15, a week prior to the Daytona 500 race itself. After the 2014 Daytona 500, NASCAR eliminated the traditional single car qualifying format for the pole qualifying and introduced a knockout qualifying format commonly used in many series at Phoenix the following week. The restrictor plate track rules, first implemented at the fall Talladega race, were used.\nThe top two times in the final qualifying session were locked in the front row of the Daytona 500 starting grid, while the other 41 starting spots were determined by the two Budweiser Duel races the following Thursday. If a driver failed to make the Top 15 in the Duels, the time that was used to calculate the four drivers that would qualify based on time – and to grid the seven drivers that took provisional starting positions was based solely on the fastest time they set – regardless of qualifying session.\nIn what would be his final Daytona 500 start, Jeff Gordon won the pole with a time of 44.711 and a speed of . Gordon felt that in the new qualifying format, \"the driver finally gets to play a role\". He also stated that he had \"a fast race car\" and that the pole position was \"one of the most gratifying poles I've had, not just because it's my final Daytona\". His teammate Jimmie Johnson started right alongside in second. In the first round of qualifying, Clint Bowyer tried to go under Reed Sorenson when he got hit in the rear by Jeb Burton and turned right into Sorenson. Both cars hit the wall and collected Bobby Labonte and J. J. Yeley. Denny Hamlin also took some damage. The session was red flagged with a minute and 22 seconds left. After the red flag was lifted, no one was able to make it back to the line before time expired. Upon exiting his car, Bowyer vented his frustrations at the Daytona qualifying procedure. Other drivers like Ryan Newman and Kurt Busch also expressed their dislike of the qualifying procedure.\nThe cars of Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Denny Hamlin failed post-qualifying inspection and started from the rear of the field in their respective Duel races. Earnhardt's car was found to be too low on the left front – a rule implemented only for restrictor plate tracks – while the panhard rod on Hamlin's car was found to be beyond the maximum allowed. Both drivers expressed thoughts on Twitter post-penalties, with both looking forward to moving up the order in the Duels. Both drivers had no time listed, meaning if either driver did not make the top 15 in the Duels, they would have to start 42nd or 43rd as they would be forced take a provisional and be placed behind all drivers with a legal time.\nPractice (post-qualifying).\nThird practice (February 18).\nKyle Busch was the fastest in the third practice session with a time of 44.826 and a speed of . During this session, there was a four car wreck on the backstretch that involved Michael Annett, Jeb Burton, Denny Hamlin and Danica Patrick. It started when Hamlin pulled out of line and Patrick tried to follow him, but made contact with the right-front corner of Hamlin's car when she over-corrected and hit the wall. Michael Annett tried to go high around Patrick on the outside when he got turned by Jeb Burton. Patrick, Annett and Burton all switched to backup cars. After the incident, Patrick stated that her car \"sort of just started turning toward the right, the back end was coming around and it swapped ends\" and that Hamlin was trying to \"make a third lane in the middle and it felt like it must have caught my bumper\". Hamlin felt that Patrick had intended to block his path, stating that a driver has \"to give a little bit of extra room in practice\" and that if he \"had to guess, she probably saw in her mirror that I was going down there and tried to stay in front of me\".\nFourth practice (February 18).\nAlex Bowman was the fastest in the fourth practice session with a time of 44.889 and a speed of .\nFifth practice (February 19).\nKyle Larson was the fastest in the fifth practice session with a time of 46.705 and a speed of . This session had only five drivers take part in it doing single car runs.\nBudweiser Duel.\nThe Budweiser Duels were held on Thursday, February 19. They consisted of two races, in length, which served as the qualifying races for the Daytona 500. The first race involved the drivers that qualified in the odd numbered positions in pole qualifying. The second race involved the drivers that qualified in the even numbered positions and the five drivers that failed to make the race. The results of the two Budweiser Duels determined the starting lineup, behind the front row pre-determined by pole qualifying, for the weekend's Daytona 500 race.\nRace one.\nFirst half.\nStart.\nThe first race started at 7:19 p.m. Eastern time when Jeff Gordon led the field to the green. Matt Kenseth took the lead with the bottom lane to lead the first lap. The first caution of the race flew on lap 17 after Casey Mears blew an engine in turn 1. Kenseth and Gordon swapped the lead on pit road, and Gordon exited as the leader for the restart on lap 24. Michael Annett was forced to restart the race from the tail-end of the longest line, as his pit crew went over the wall too soon.\nTrouble in the tri-oval.\nKenseth used the bottom line and jumped in front of Gordon to take back the lead on lap 26, just ahead of the race's second caution when Johnny Sauter crashed in the tri-oval, following contact with A. J. Allmendinger, while Aric Almirola also picked up some damage to his car.\nSauter stated that he was \"just riding along\" and that he was \"trying to mind my business\" before the contact with Allmendinger, with the point of impact being \"in the left rear quarter panel\". He also stated that it was \"a bummer deal\" for himself and his BK Racing team. Sauter did, however, make the starting lineup for the race, on his qualifying speeds, while Allmendinger took a provisional. Allmendinger apologised for the contact with Sauter, while stating that his JTG Daugherty Racing car was fast, while also criticizing the racing that was occurring, stating that he \"was trying to stay out of trouble and got put in the middle and I was trying to bail out of the middle\". Michael McDowell dropped to the end of the longest line, for the restart on lap 33, after his crew was over the wall too soon.\nSecond half.\nDale Earnhardt Jr. used a slight push from the bottom line to take the lead on lap 35. Kenseth drove past Earnhardt on the bottom to take back the lead on lap 39. On lap 43, Earnhardt used a slingshot move to overtake Kenseth for good. The third caution of the race flew on lap 51 when Trevor Bayne got loose, came down on Kyle Larson and hit the wall in turn 1. During this period, Ty Dillon broke his gear shifter. The race restarted with five laps to go and Earnhardt. held off Jeff Gordon to win race one.\nPost-race.\nEarnhardt praised the work of his spotter T. J. Majors in victory lane, stating that he \"gave me the information I needed to make the moves I needed\" and that he was \"looking forward to getting to Sunday and trying to get another Daytona 500 win\". Dillon, finished 16th after the gearshift issues, and was able to make the field. He described the result as \"hard to explain\" and that he had \"been coming here since I was a kid watching my grandfather's cars race\". Ron Hornaday Jr. and Justin Marks failed to make the race.\nRace two.\nFirst half.\nStart.\nBefore the start, Josh Wise stalled at the entrance of pit road and took his car to the garage. This ultimately eliminated him from racing in the Daytona 500. The second race started 18 minutes late at 9:19 p.m. with Jimmie Johnson leading the field to the green flag. Kyle Busch took the lead on the first lap. The first caution of the race flew on lap 19 for a spin by David Ragan, exiting turn 4. Ragan had cut across the nose of Justin Allgaier and got turned down onto the apron, making contact with the inside wall. Kyle Busch was first off pit road, but he was caught speeding on pit road and was forced to drop to the end of the line, allowing Johnson to retake the lead for the restart, on lap 25. Allgaier was also sent to the rear, as his pit crew came across the wall too soon.\nSecond half.\nThe second caution of the race flew on lap 37 for a multi-car wreck in the tri-oval. It started exiting turn 4 when Jeb Burton turned down into Sam Hornish Jr. who turned into Alex Bowman. Austin Dillon destroyed his splitter driving through the grass trying to avoid the wreck, which caused the race to be red flagged for five minutes. The race restarted with 20 laps to go. With 14 laps to go, Kurt Busch was given a drive-through penalty for passing below the double yellow line. The third caution of the race flew with three laps to go for a four car wreck in turn 3. Denny Hamlin gave Danica Patrick a push which turned her around and collected Brian Scott and Bobby Labonte.\nIn a green–white–checker finish, Johnson held off a last lap charge by Kyle Busch and Carl Edwards to win the race. Johnson defined the Speedweeks at Daytona as \"awesome\" for his Hendrick Motorsports team, sweeping the Duels and the front row for the Daytona 500. Johnson also called his car as \"mad fast\".\nPost-race.\nPatrick confronted Hamlin on pit road after the race. After the confrontation, Patrick told reporters that she had \"no explanation for that\", while also stating Hamlin was in the wrong by believing \"that he's taking the air and getting it off the spoiler, and he's not squared up either\". Michael Annett, Ryan Blaney, Landon Cassill, Ty Dillon, Michael McDowell, Reed Sorenson, Mike Wallace, Cole Whitt and J. J. Yeley raced their way into the Daytona 500. Bobby Labonte also made the race, via the provisional for past series champions. Alex Bowman, Burton, Ron Hornaday Jr., Justin Marks, Scott and Wise all failed to make the race.\nSuspension of Kurt Busch.\nKurt Busch was suspended by NASCAR on February 20, 2015 due to his then ongoing legal battle with possible domestic violence charges. NASCAR released an official statement, which was later confirmed at a press briefing with executive vice president Steve O'Donnell. Regan Smith replaced Busch for the Daytona 500 and, per NASCAR's rules regarding post-qualifying driver changes, was required to start at the rear of the field.\nOn Saturday, the day after the suspension was announced, Kurt Busch appealed the suspension to the National Motorsports Appeals Panel. The panelists selected were IndyCar driver Lyn St. James, Kevin Whitaker, and Paul Brooks. The panel denied Busch's appeal after a 3-hour hearing. So did National Motorsports Final Appeals Officer, Bryan Moss.\nPractice (post-Duels).\nSixth practice (February 20).\nJeff Gordon was the fastest in the sixth practice session with a time of 46.613 and a speed of .\nSeventh practice (February 20).\nDale Earnhardt Jr. was the fastest in the seventh practice session with a time of 46.295 and a speed of .\nFinal practice (February 21).\nDenny Hamlin was the fastest in the final practice session with a time of 44.531 and a speed of .\nPrior to the race.\nWith nine laps to go in the Alert Today Florida 300 Xfinity Series race on the day before the Daytona 500, Kyle Busch crashed into the inside retaining wall between the tri-oval and turn 1. He was taken to the nearby Halifax Health Medical Center after sustaining a compound fracture to his right leg, ruling him out of the Daytona 500. The wall he hit lacked a SAFER barrier, drawing much criticism from different drivers. Ty Dillon, who finished third, was unaware of Busch's injury at the end of the race, while also adding that it was coming \"to the point now in NASCAR we should have SAFER barriers at a place like this\". Runner-up Chris Buescher echoed Dillon's comments, stating that the sport \"needs to be as safe as possible\" and that if \"it means lining the inside walls as well, it's probably a good idea\".\nWith the sidelining of Kyle Busch, the Daytona 500 was the first race since the 2001 NAPA 500 at Atlanta – where Kurt Busch failed to qualify – not to feature a Busch brother in the starting lineup. Matt Crafton replaced Kyle Busch for the Daytona 500, while David Ragan and Erik Jones replaced him thereafter.\nRace.\nPre-race festivities.\nRonnie Barton of the First Baptist Church of South Daytona began the pre-race festivities with the invocation. Singer/songwriter Phillip Phillips performed the United States National Anthem. The flyover was performed by the United States Air Force Thunderbirds. Vince Vaughn gave the command for the drivers to start their engines, while Paralympics bronze medalist Amy Purdy was the honorary pace car driver for the pre-race pace laps.\nFirst half.\nStart.\nWith members of the United States women's national soccer team waving the green flag, pole sitter Jeff Gordon led the field to the start of the 2015 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series season under clear skies at 1:31 p.m. Eastern time. He led the first lap in his final Daytona 500, but was quickly passed by his teammate Jimmie Johnson on the second lap. Johnson then maintained control of the lead until lap 14 when he was shuffled up to the outside lane and Gordon took back the lead. The first caution flag of the race flew on lap 19 when Landon Cassill blew an engine exiting turn 2. Michael Annett, J. J. Yeley and Casey Mears all stayed out to lead a lap when Gordon and the others pitted. Cole Whitt was forced to restart the race from the rear of the field, as he was serviced by too many members at his pit stop.\nThe race restarted on lap 25 with Gordon in the lead. The second caution of the race flew on lap 41 when Tony Stewart and Matt Kenseth got into the wall exiting turn 4; Stewart's car was loose exiting the turn and got turned by Ryan Blaney into the wall. Kenseth, braking to avoid contact with Blaney, got turned into the wall by Michael Waltrip. Kenseth pitted and lost two laps, while Stewart was forced to go to the garage. Stewart took responsibility for the incident, stating that \"when it got three-wide that particular lap, it got away from me\", and that when he had decelerated, he \"couldn't even get the front end caught up\".\nSecond quarter.\nThe race restarted on lap 46 and Joey Logano used the high line to overtake Gordon for the lead on lap 47 with Johnson and Earnhardt Jr. close behind. On lap 53, Gordon took back the lead from Logano. Gordon, Earnhardt., Martin Truex Jr. and Kasey Kahne broke away from the pack single file, remaining that way for the next 15 laps. Thereafter, the field became largely a single-file train running up next to the wall. Nearing the end of the fuel run, the field began to bunch up and two lines of cars formed up behind Gordon. Earnhardt Jr., Kahne and Truex. moved side-by-side behind Gordon, allowing the pack to catch up to the leaders again. Gordon continued to maintain the lead until the next green flag pit-stop sequence that began on lap 85; he surrendered the lead on lap 87 to make his stop and Carl Edwards assumed the lead. Denny Hamlin took the lead after driving past teammate Edwards on pit road the next lap. Johnson was forced to serve a drive-through penalty for his crew being over the wall too soon. Edwards, Bobby Labonte, Kyle Larson, Truex. and Mike Wallace all served drive-through penalties for speeding. After stops were complete, Gordon reassumed the lead on lap 90.\nSecond half.\nHalfway.\nDebris in the tri-oval brought out the third caution of the race on lap 105, as a hose-piece was seen near the start-finish line. After pit stops, Gordon continued to lead over Hamlin, Casey Mears and Kahne. A. J. Allmendinger stayed out to lead a lap before pitting. Justin Allgaier dropped to the rear for an uncontrolled tire and Aric Almirola dropped to the rear for too many men over the wall.\nThe race restarted with 90 laps to go with Gordon leading. Hamlin took the lead from Gordon with 88 laps to go, but he was passed one lap later by Logano who drove under him on the inside line. Three laps later, Dale Earnhardt Jr. took the lead and remained at the head of the train until Logano drove under him for the lead with 55 laps to go. Green flag stops began with 49 laps to go, and Logano surrendered the lead to pit with 47 laps to go and Greg Biffle assumed the lead. Larson locked up his brakes entering pit road and plowed some of the infield grass getting down to pit road speed. After the pit stop sequence, Logano reassumed the lead, as Yeley was caught speeding on pit road and was forced to serve a drive-through penalty.\nFourth quarter.\nJimmie Johnson took back the lead with 42 laps to go. Brad Keselowski's engine expired with 40 laps to go, causing Jamie McMurray and Ryan Newman to collide, and this brought out the fourth caution of the race. Keselowski told reporters that the blown engine was caused by \"something in the oil pan, broke something important\", while stating that he was \"starting to get position,\" ahead of the final 100 miles of the race. Roughly half of the field pitted for fuel under the caution, with the other half staying out for track position, but without assurance that they had enough fuel to make it to the end of the race. Reed Sorenson was caught speeding on pit road and was forced to restart the race from the rear of the field.\nThe race restarted with 35 laps to go. Johnson had the lead, but was quickly passed by Edwards. Two laps later, Johnson retook the lead from Edwards on the outside. With 32 laps to go, the field was racing three-wide multiple rows back. The fifth caution of the race flew with 25 laps to go when Blaney's car blew an engine on the back straight. A number of the drivers who did not pit under the previous caution pitted under this caution.\nRestart and red flag.\nThe race restarted with 19 laps to go. Two laps later, the field was racing three-wide multiple rows from the lead to the tail. Denny Hamlin drove underneath Jimmie Johnson for the lead, but was immediately passed by Truex. Hamlin took the lead with 11 laps to go, using the middle lane. Logano took the lead on the following lap, leading the next seven laps until Allgaier and Ty Dillon wrecked in the tri-oval, which brought out the sixth caution and forced a green–white–checker finish. The red flag was displayed for 6 minutes and 42 seconds, as Allgaier's car had spilled a large amount of oil on the race track.\nFinish.\nThe race restarted with two laps to go with Logano leading. On the final lap, a huge pileup occurred on the back straight involving Jeff Gordon, Kyle Larson, Ricky Stenhouse Jr., A. J. Allmendinger, Trevor Bayne and Reed Sorenson. As the leaders entered turn 3, the caution was displayed. Logano coasted across the finish line to score his first Daytona 500 victory and the second for car owner Roger Penske. At the age of 24, Logano was the second youngest winner of the Daytona 500, with only Bayne – aged 20, in the 2011 race – winning at a younger age.\nMedia.\nTelevision.\nSince 2001 – with the exception of 2002, 2004 and 2006 – the Daytona 500 has been carried by Fox in the United States. The booth crew of longtime NASCAR lap-by-lap announcer Mike Joy, two-time Daytona 500 winning crew chief Larry McReynolds and 1989 race winner Darrell Waltrip has remained the same since the 2001 race. Pit road was manned by Jamie Little, Chris Neville, Vince Welch and Matt Yocum.\nRadio.\nThe race was broadcast on radio by the Motor Racing Network and simulcasted on Sirius XM NASCAR Radio. MRN Radio has covered the Daytona 500 since 1970. Joe Moore, Jeff Striegle and Rusty Wallace covered the race from the booth. Longtime turn announcer – and prodigy of MRN co-founder Ken Squier – Dave Moody was the lead turn announcer. He called the Daytona 500 from atop the Sunoco tower outside the exit of turn 2 when the field was racing through turns 1 and 2. Mike Bagley worked the backstretch for the Daytona 500 from a spotter's stand on the inside of the track. Kyle Rickey called the Daytona 500 when the field was racing through turns 3 and 4 from the Sunoco tower outside the exit of turn 4. On pit road, MRN was manned by lead pit reporter and NASCAR Hall of Fame executive director Winston Kelley. He was joined on pit road by Steve Post and Alex Hayden."

Among the professionals, the sprint final between Belgian Jef Scherens and Arie van Vliet of the Netherlands could not take place and was cancelled. In addition, the individual pursuit, which was to be held officially for the first time (the previous year it had been a demonstration sport), also had to be cancelled.\nThe race for the bronze medal in the professional category was won by Germany's Albert Richter. About three months later, he was arrested by the Gestapo and killed in Lörrach.

With pressure on the land for development, the club moved to its present ground in the north-eastern corner of Sefton Park shortly after the park's opening in 1876. Sefton became Sefton Park Cricket Club in 1998 and in 2003 the club's second ground with its own pavilion was opened adjacent to the main ground by the city's Lord Mayor.\nThe club is a founder member of the Liverpool and District Cricket Competition, which became an ECB Premier League in 2000, and currently plays in the Competition's First Division. Since league fixtures were standardised in 1949, Sefton have been L&amp;DCC champions in 1967 and 1972 and have since won the First Division (2000) and Second Division (2013) titles as well as winning the Liverpool Echo Knockout in 1978 and reaching the Lancashire Knockout final in 1999.

        "text": "Cycling for transport and leisure enjoys popularity in Greater Manchester and the city also plays a major role in British cycle racing. The Bee Network was launched in 2018. The University of Manchester is home to the Manchester Cycling Lab.\nSince 2014, Manchester has been upgrading many key thoroughfares into the city centre to include dedicated cycle lanes which are segregated from buses including Oxford Road, Chorlton Cycleway, the reconfiguration of other major junctions and creation of low traffic neighbourhoods.\nUtility cycling.\nCycling is a significant mode of transport for people commuting to work in Manchester. Current figures suggest that around 2% of all trips in Manchester are made by bike (2023).\nTransport for Greater Manchester aspire to \"achieve at least a 300% increase in the levels of cycling across the city region by 2025\" and have produced a corresponding cycling strategy.\nGreater Manchester Cycling Campaign is a volunteer-run group. Another pressure group for Greater Manchester is Walk Ride GM, which advocates for better environments and facilities for pedestrians as well as cyclists.\nThe Manchester Cycle Forum enables people with an interest in cycling to meet councillors and council staff from Manchester City Council, Transport for Greater Manchester staff, and representatives from various cycling and transport organisations to discuss cycling-related issues in the city. Meetings take place quarterly.\nManchester Friends of the Earth coordinate the 'Love Your Bike' campaign, which promotes cycling as an environmentally friendly mode of transport. One of its activities is the 'Bike Friday' scheme, monthly rides from outer districts into the city centre. These are aimed at encouraging commuters to cycle in to work, benefiting from the added safety and sociability of riding in a group.\nIn 2015, Manchester was described as a \"terrible cycling city\" by Helen Pidd, the North of England editor of the Guardian newspaper.\nChris Boardman was appointed Cycling and Walking Commissioner for Greater Manchester in 2017 by mayor Andy Burnham. His remit includes overseeing projects to enhance the region's cycling network and increase the number of people who travel by bike.\nHe was replaced by Dame Sarah Storey in 2022 \nBicycle hire.\nIn June 2017 Mobike started a bicycle-sharing scheme across the city allowing users to hire bikes via its app. Riders paid a deposit and were then charged 50p per 30 minutes. The scheme was suspended in September 2018 due to the high level of vandalism caused to many of the bicycles.\nA 2013 study by TfGM into the possibility of a bike hire scheme had suggested that an initial scheme should focus on a concentrated portion at the centre of the conurbation, including Manchester city centre, Salford Quays, Oxford Road and Hulme.\nThe new bike hire scheme known as Beryl, started in November 2021 as a public trial with 250 cycles on Oxford Road. By the summer of 2022 they plan to have 1,500 bikes across Manchester, Trafford &amp; Salford. The scheme will have 200 stations with around 198,000 residents with in a 5-minute walk, with stations roughly 300–500 meters apart. The stations contain stands to place the bikes on but are not secure docking stations. It works on a PAYR (Pay as you ride) basis and the back wheel is locked when stationary. When it launches me Mechanical hire cycles will cost 50p to unlock and 5p per minute, The E-bike will cost £1 to unlock and 10p per minute to ride.\nThe Beryl bike hire scheme was hit by a wave of vandalism during 2023 with damage taking 564 of the 943 bikes off the roads leaving only 379 bikes in Manchester, Salford and Trafford\nThe city was the first to get a \"Brompton Bike Hire\" facility, at Piccadilly station.\nThe Bee Network.\nThe Bee Network is a project launched by TfGM with the aim to connect up every area and community in Greater Manchester, making it easy, safe and attractive for people to travel on foot or by bike for everyday trips. A large focus is being put on to cycling in this project, therefore TfGM are investing money in many things that encourage cycling in combination with Local Authorities such as cycling infrastructure, Cycle hire scheme, Cycle hubs and many courses to help people learn to ride a bike.\nCycle routes and cycling infrastructure.\nMajor dedicated cycle routes in Greater Manchester or passing through areas of the city include:\nRegional Cycle Route 85 deviates from National Cycle Route 6 at Whalley Range to link the city centre with Wythenshawe and Manchester Airport. Other numbered regional routes include the 82 (better known as Bridgewater Way) and the 86 (which follows the River Medlock).\nFuture cycling infrastructure proposals.\nSchool Streets.\nA pair of digital bicycle counters installed on either side of the road near Whitworth Park in September 2016 had reached a combined total of 1,000,000 bike journeys by late 2017.\nIn 2019, TfGM began developing a \"Bee Network\" of cycle routes across Greater Manchester.\nThe 1st part of the Chorlton Cycleway has been delivered with Dutch style junctions known as cyclops junctions, a first in the UK.\nAs part of the segregated Chorlton Cycleway, the UK's first 'Cyclops\" junction was completed in July 2020 in Hulme.\nLow Traffic Neighbourhoods.\nModal filters across Greater Manchester have been in place for over 40 years.\nThe Levenshulme and Burnage Active Neighbourhood was completed in 2023 with a series of filters throughout the neighbourhood to help encourage active travel trips.\nRegular events.\nThe Manchester Sky Ride, a mass participation bike ride, was held in August every year, and became the HSBC UK City Ride from July 2017. The Great Manchester Cycle is a similar large-scale event held during the summer in recent years.\nA Critical Mass event takes place on the last Friday of every month, starting by Manchester Central Library. A naked bike ride is held annually early in the summer, along with a non-corporate DIY cycling festival, North West Velofest.\nThere are over 200 cycle clubs in Greater Manchester, catering to many styles of cycling, with Manchester Wheelers' Club being one of the most well-known.\nWell known sportives include the \"Manchester 100\", a choice of 100 mile or 100 km rides to the south of the city, and the \"Tour de Manc\", a 100-mile ride through all the ten boroughs.\nHistory.\nA combined velodrome and athletics stadium, Fallowfield Stadium opened in 1892. The cycling track was 509 yards in circumference and was used for the 1934 British Empire Games. It was demolished in 1994."

        "text": "Robert Edwin Blake (January 31, 1885 – May 8, 1962) was an American football, basketball, and baseball player for the Vanderbilt Commodores of Vanderbilt University. Every football season in which he played, Blake was a member of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA) championship team and unanimously selected All-Southern. He was a lawyer and Rhodes Scholar.\nHis three brothers, Dan, Vaughn, and Frank, also played on those winning teams. Dan, Bob, and Vaughn were captains of the 1906, 1907, and 1908 Vanderbilt football teams respectively. He thus signed letters \"Bob Blake, \"pater familias\".\"\nBlake was later general counsel for the International Shoe Company, and married Dorothy Gaynor. Blake was also president of the Missouri Constitutional Convention in 1944.\nEarly years.\nBlake was born on January 31, 1885, in Cuero, Texas, to Daniel Bigelow Blake, Sr. and Mary Clara Weldon. Dan, Sr. was a physician and once president of the Nashville Academy of Medicine. Bob Blake prepped at Bowen School.\nVanderbilt University.\nBlake was Vanderbilt University’s first athlete to earn 16 letters, participating in football, basketball, baseball, and track. He stood 6 feet and weighed 170 pounds. While a senior, Blake was honored as Bachelor of Ugliness.\nFootball.\nBlake was a prominent end for Dan McGugin's Vanderbilt Commodores football teams in 1903 and from 1905 to 1907. He was also a punter and drop kicker. As a punter, one writer claimed others considered him \"the best in the country.\" He was selected All-Southern unanimously each and every year he played, and Vanderbilt won the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA) championship in all of his years. In 1915, John Heisman called Blake one of the greatest players in Vanderbilt history, along with Ray Morrison and Owsley Manier. Grantland Rice once said about Bob Blake, “he was the only halfback who never lost a yard around right end.”\nA fellow student at Vanderbilt once said of Blake \"He is an athlete and this has been one great factor in making him popular, but Bob Blake would have been a popular man if he had not been an athlete. In the third place he is interested in and takes an active part in every phase of college life. In the fourth place he has maintained himself well in scholarship, while not a brilliant student, he has, in my opinion, made a record above that of the average student.\" In the opinion of fellow Vanderbilt player Honus Craig, Blake was the South's greatest player. Blake was chosen for an all-time Vandy team in 1912, and for an \"Associated Press\" Southeast Area All-Time football team 1869–1919 era. \n1903.\nBoth Blake and teammate John J. Tigert were Rhodes Scholars. Blake broke his wrist in the Sewanee–Vanderbilt game.\n1904 and 1905.\nBob Blake did not play in Dan McGugin's first year of 1904, but resumed play on the 1905 team.\n1906.\nVanderbilt won a major intersectional contest in 1906 when it defeated Carlisle 4–0 via a single, 17-yard Blake drop kick, \"the crowning feat of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association season.\" The score was 4 to 0, as field goals then counted for 4 points. College Football Hall of Fame inductee Albert Exendine was playing for Carlisle. Frank Mount Pleasant missed four field goals.\n1907.\nHe made Walter Camp's All-America Honorable Mention in 1907, as well as the first team All-American selection of Michigan coach Fielding Yost. Blake threw the pass to Stein Stone on a trick double-pass play which set up the score to beat Sewanee in 1907 for the SIAA championship, which was cited by Grantland Rice as the greatest thrill he ever witnessed in his years of watching sports. Blake missed two kicks on a slippery field in the 8–0 loss to Michigan.\nCoaching.\nGordon Institute.\nHe assisted his brother Frank Blake in coaching at Gordon Institute in 1907.\nReturn to Vanderbilt.\nIn 1910, Blake was awarded a law degree and returned to Vanderbilt for one season as an assistant football coach for Dan McGugin. The 1910 team shocked defending national champion Yale with a scoreless tie.\nMontgomery Bell.\nHe coached at Montgomery Bell Academy in 1912.\nMissouri.\nInternational shoe company.\nAfter practicing law in Nashville from 1911 to 1919, he engaged in business in Saint Louis, Missouri. He was elected to the board of directors of the International Shoe company in 1921, and directed the company since 1929.\nMissouri Constitutional Convention.\nBlake was president of the Missouri Constitutional Convention and awarded the \"Man of the Year\" award for Saint Louis in 1944.\nDeath.\nBlake died in St. Louis in 1962."

He played college football for the UCLA Bruins, receiving All-American honors as a junior in 1994. He played professionally for the Arizona Cardinals and was a member of the Cincinnati Bengals. After trying out with the Denver Broncos, he became a chaplain for UCLA sports teams as well as the NFL's Pittsburgh Steelers.\nEarly life.\nJordan attended high school at High Point High in Beltsville, Maryland. He was a tight end on a team that ran the winged-T and did not pass the ball much. He was more notable as an All-American defensive back, recording 16 interceptions as a senior. He decided to attend the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he joined his brother, Al.\nCollege career.\nJordan missed a season after suffering an injury in a high school all-star game, and sat out another as a redshirt. Having not played on a passing team at High Point, he needed to adjust to the more complicated schemes at UCLA. Jordan began his Bruins career with 18 receptions for 150 yards as a freshman. He followed with a solid performance of 45 catches for 612 yards in 1993, but he was overshadowed that season by teammate J. J. Stokes, who set UCLA records with 82 catches for 1,181 yards and 17 touchdowns.\nIn the season opener of 1994, Jordan stepped up for an injured Stokes with six receptions for 152 yards and a touchdown in a 25–23 win over Tennessee. He earned first-team All-American honors from \"Football News\" and third-team from Associated Press that season after recording 73 catches and breaking Stokes' single-season school record with 1,228 yards. He finished fourth in the nation in receiving yards per game (111.6) and sixth in receptions per game (6.6). However, Jordan injured his right knee in the final game when he was hit by two USC defenders after catch, and he had surgery to repair a partially torn ligament in February 1995. Impacted by the injury, his production dropped in 1995. Still, he finished at UCLA as the school's career leader in catches (179) and receiving yards (2,548).\nNFL career.\nJordan was not selected in the 1996 NFL draft, but signed as a free agent with the Arizona Cardinals. He played one game for Arizona in 1996 and was active but did not see action in two games; he was on the inactive list on four others. Arizona waived him midseason in October, and he was claimed by the Cincinnati Bengals, who released him the following month. During the 1997 offseason, he married Jenny Johnson, who was a volleyball player at UCLA when they met in 1992. Jordan tried out with the Denver Broncos in 1998, but he struggled with injuries and was cut.\nLater years.\nAfter his playing career ended, Jordan became a missionary with Athletes in Action, a college religious organization, and also became a chaplain for the UCLA football team. Jordan and his wife relocated from Los Angeles after he accepted an offer to be the chaplain for the Pittsburgh Steelers under Coach Mike Tomlin, who later credited Jordan with establishing unity on their Super Bowl-winning team of 2009.\nAfter four years in Pittsburgh and a second trip to the Super Bowl, Jordan and his wife returned to Los Angeles and started 4TheJourney ministry and served as chaplains for the UCLA women's basketball team."

In 1974 the Bahrain team participated in two championships, namely, the 7th Asian Games Championship in Tehran, and the first and second Arab Championships in Baghdad and Kuwait (1976), respectively, followed by a string of participation events.\nIn September 2016 Shaikh Isa bin Ali bin Khalifa Al Khalifa was elected President of BBA, following a unanimous vote. He took the administrative and technical work of the BBA to a qualitative stage, using a new vision focusing on the single objective of developing and enhancing the game.\nOn 11 October 2019, Shaikh Khalid bin Hamad Al Khalifa ordered a temporarily reformation of BBA after the resignation of 5 board members out of 9 including the president. The new board included Mr. Talal Kanoo as president, along with Naser Al Qaseer, Ali Al Khaja, Osama Al Kooheji, Mohamed Al Nemr, and Abduljalil Khudair."

        "text": "Supreme Snowboarding (known as Boarder Zone in the United States) is a snowboarding video game created by Housemarque for Microsoft Windows with a Game Boy Color version by Software Creations in 1999. It was one of the first snowboarding games for Windows to take full advantage of 3D graphics cards that were becoming the norm in the late 1990s. Over 1.5 million units were sold worldwide, allowing \"Supreme Snowboarding\" to become the first hit title in Finnish game development. The game received positive critical reception, as well as acclaim for having one of the best visuals of its time, though its lack of content and replay value was sometimes criticized.\nGameplay.\nThe game's core is built around three major game modes:\nThe controls of the game received praise, with players only using three other keys for jumps, tricks and carving snow, along with the directional keys. Players hit the jump key to initiate a trick, the trick key is used to perform such tricks, and the third button allows characters to turn faster by carving into the snow.\nThere are nine slalom and six trick courses, as well as six characters, each with their unique pros and cons. Each course features four types of weather and is divided into three types: Alpine, Village or Forest. There are also four snowboards, each designed to accommodate a different type of snowboarding. No internet multiplayer is offered though players can play with up to eight people over a LAN.\nRelease.\n\"Supreme Snowboarding\" was often bundled with other products; for example, players obtained a copy of the game with their Kellogg's cereal. A cut version of the game, titled \"Flo-Boarding\", was packaged into every N-Gage device in 2003, becoming the first game to be bundled together with the phone.\nThere were initial efforts by Sega of America to port \"high-profile titles\" including \"Supreme Snowboarding\" to the Dreamcast console, though, like many others, such efforts eventually failed due to the platform's uncertain profile with the impending arrival of the PlayStation 2.\nReception.\nThe PC version initially received critical acclaim upon release in Finland, with its graphics, speed and responsive controls being lauded. Reviewers praised the game for its realistic snowy environments and special effects, such as shadowing and weather. It was also commended as being easy to control and enjoyable to play, though criticism was leveled at the limited number of tracks and lack of content.\nJuho Kuorikoski, in his book \"Finnish Video Games: A History and Catalog\", noted in a more contemporary review how despite \"\"Supreme Snowboarding\" [not being] the young buck it used to be, it still has that addictive element to it. While less impressive on the outside, its inner beauty has remained intact.\"\nIn the United States, the PC version received favourable reviews, while the Game Boy Color version received mixed reviews, according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. Tal Blevis of \"IGN\" praised the graphics, value for money and \"simple fun\" of the PC version, but fault was found with the game's relative lack of content. This sentiment was echoed by Ryan J. Fong of \"GameSpot\", who praised the graphics and gameplay of the same PC version, but also complained about the lack of content and replay value. \"GameFan\" gave the same PC version a favourable review, almost a month before its U.S. release date. Doug Trueman of \"NextGen\" called the same PC version \"A strong title, but not what it could have been.\"\nAs a technologically advanced game, \"Supreme Snowboarding\" was adopted by hardware manufacturers to showcase the potential of PC processors and graphics cards in 1998 and 1999 at industry events.\n\"Supreme Snowboarding\" was the first Finnish game to be truly successful, and the first to sell over one million units. \nSequel.\nA sequel titled \"Transworld Snowboarding\" was released for the Xbox console in 2002, noted for being the first Finnish-developed console game. It was renamed from \"Supreme Snowboarding 2\" following a licensing shift as the publisher was moved from France to the United States and eventually became a moderate hit."

The finals was held on 6 August 1992.\nTwo gold medals were awarded in solo synchronized swimming after a judge inadvertently entered the score of \"8.7\" instead of the intended \"9.7\" in the computerized scoring system for one of Sylvie Fréchette's figures. This error ultimately placed Fréchette second, leaving Kristen Babb-Sprague for the gold medal. Following an appeal FINA awarded Fréchette a gold medal, replacing her silver medal and leaving the two swimmers both with gold.\nThis event was discontinued after these Olympics in favor of a team event."

        "title": "Colonialism and the Olympic Games",
        "text": "The Olympic Games have been criticized as upholding (and in some cases increasing) the colonial policies and practices of some host nations and cities either in the name of the Olympics by associated parties or directly by official Olympic bodies, such as the International Olympic Committee, host organizing committees and official sponsors.\nThe founder of the modern Olympic Games, French educator Charles Pierre de Frédy, Baron de Coubertin wrote that sport and colonialism were \"natural companions\", terming sport \"a vigorous instrument of the disciplining\" of colonized people, and viewed it as a calming force in the French colonial empire.\nCritics have claimed that the Olympics have engaged in or caused: erroneous anthropological and colonial knowledge production; erasure; commodification and appropriation of indigenous ceremonies and symbolism; theft and inappropriate display of indigenous objects; further encroachment on and support of the theft of indigenous lands; and neglect or intensification of poor social conditions for indigenous peoples.\nOlympic Games as a colonial force and recommendations.\nThe founder of the modern Olympic Games, French educator Pierre de Coubertin wrote that sport and colonialism were \"natural companions\". He called sports \"a vigorous instrument of the disciplining\" of colonized people, and viewed it as a calming force in the French colonial empire. O'Bonsawin writes that Olympism, as a \"philosophy\", speaks \"in truisms of equity, anti-discrimination, mutual recognition and respect, tolerance and solidarity\". But she and other critics argue that in reality Olympism serves as an \"apologetic\" for a movement that is actually \"deeply politicized and xenophobic\". O'Bonsawin also argues that in encouraging Olympic participants to \"cast aside everyday lived experiences ... shaped by such factors as race, gender, sexuality, religion, culture, ideology, and class\" Olympism itself erases the realities of marginalized peoples.\nTo address this erasure and the disparity between Olympism ideals and Games practice, O'Bonsawin recommends that the IOC restructure their bid evaluation process so that they can determine whether bidding countries respect the human rights and needs of marginalized peoples. Instrumental to this restructuring would be the inclusion of external consultation and evaluation.\nAnthropology at the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri.\nThe 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri, were held in conjunction with the Louisiana Purchase Exposition (also known as the St. Louis World's Fair), and were the first modern Olympic Games to be held in North America. Since the 1889 Paris Exposition, human zoos, as a key feature of world's fairs, functioned as demonstrations of anthropological notions of race, progress, and civilization. These goals were followed also at the 1904 World's Fair. Fourteen hundred indigenous people from Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, East Asia, Africa, the Middle East, South America and North America were displayed in anthropological exhibits that showed them in their natural habitats. Another 1,600 indigenous people displayed their culture in other areas of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition (LPE), including on the fairgrounds and at the Model School, where American Indian boarding schools students demonstrated their successful assimilation.\nAccording to theorist Susan Brownell, since the 1889 Paris Exposition, world's fairs – with their inclusion of human zoos – and the Olympics were a logical fit at this time, as they \"were both linked to an underlying cultural logic that gave them a natural affinity\". Taking this natural fit to the next level, two key figures at the 1904 World's Fair – William John McGee and James Edward Sullivan – devised an event that would bring anthropology and sport together: Anthropology Days.\nW. J. McGee was the head of the Department of Anthropology at the LPE and the founding president of the new American Anthropological Association.\nWhile Anthropology Days were not officially part of the Olympics program, they were closely associated with each other at the time, and in history—Brownell notes that even today historians still debate as to which of the LPE events were the \"real\" Olympic Games. Additionally, almost all of the 400 athletic events were referred to as \"Olympian,\" and the opening ceremony was held in May with dignitaries in attendance, though the official Olympic program did not begin until July 1. Also, as previously noted, one of the original intentions of Anthropology Days was to create publicity for the official Olympic events.\nAnthropology Days took place on August 11 and 12, 1904, with about 100 paid indigenous men (no women participated in Anthropology Days, though some, notably the Fort Shaw Indian School girls basketball team, did compete in other athletic events at the LPE). Contests included \"baseball throwing, shot put, running, broad jumping, weight lifting, pole climbing, and tugs-of-war before a crowd of approximately ten thousand\".\nSpectacle and appropriation at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec.\nThe 1976 Summer Olympics have been criticized for a lack of consultation and the spectacular display of indigenous people in the closing ceremony. Sport scholar Christine O'Bonsawin explains how \"Montreal organizers strategically included indigenous people and imagery in the closing ceremony at a time when Canadian indigenous and government relations were operating under heightened tensions\". She is referring to then Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's 1969 Statement of the Government of Canada on Indian Policy (also called the White Paper), which was perceived by some Canadian indigenous people as a further attempt at assimilation.\nO'Bonsawin describes how amid these tensions the Montreal Olympic Games' closing ceremony employed indigenous symbolism without consultation with local First Nations. Hundreds of performers were enlisted to perform a \"tribal\" dance that was choreographed by a non-indigenous choreographer, to a musical score (\"La Danse Sauvage\") created by a non-indigenous composer. Only 200 of the 450 performers were indigenous, with the other 250 being non-indigenous people costumed and painted in \"redface\"—it was these non-indigenous performers who led the indigenous people into the stadium. O'Bonsawin notes that particularly problematic about this approach to including indigenous \"participation\" is that it became a model for future Canadian Olympic Games.\nClaims of cultural theft and erasure at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta.\nThe 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta reflected some lessons learned from criticism of the 1976 games, but according to critics, they still perpetuated legacies of erasure, cultural and land theft, and appropriation committed by past Games and Canadian governmental bodies.\nO'Bonsawin writes that there was significant protest from indigenous people against the use and appropriation of indigenous imagery in the 1988 Winter Games. This imagery included \"indigenous sounds, sights, and images [and] a massive teepee\" in the opening ceremony, and medals depicting \"winter sporting equipment protruding from a ceremonial headdress\".\nThe 1988 Winter Games were also the subject of an international boycott called by the Lubicon Lake Indian Nation, a small community in northern Alberta. Their reasons centered around what they considered the illegal sale of their unceded lands to oil companies—unceded because they had been left out of the 1899 and 1900 treaties and the federal government was still not willing to negotiate a treaty. While corporations extracted resources from their lands, the Lubicon Cree were experiencing \"a 93% decline in their annual trapping income, high rates of alcoholism, a tuberculosis crisis, and malnourishment in the community\".\nThe Lubicon Cree focused their boycott on a specific Olympic event: \"The Spirit Sings\" exhibit at the Glenbow Museum, part of the official cultural programming of the Games. They protested this exhibit on several grounds, including that almost half of its funding came from Shell Oil Canada—the very company drilling for oil on their unceded land. The exhibit consisted of indigenous Canadian artifacts, art and objects gathered from collections around the world. Of this, Lubicon Chief Bernard Ominayak said: \"[The] irony of using a display of North American Indian artifacts to attract people to the Winter Olympics being organized by interests who are still actively seeking to destroy Indian people seems painfully obvious.\"\nThe Lubicon Cree claimed that the 665 artifacts in the exhibit had originally been stolen—expatriated from indigenous communities and displayed in Europe for public consumption and curiosity. Additionally \"many of the objects were sacred and not intended for public display\", including a Mohawk False Face mask. O'Bonsawin discusses how the Glenbow Museum committed a \"second and more disgraceful wave of thievery\" by returning the artifacts to the collections and museums who had loaned them, and refusing to assist indigenous groups in getting these items repatriated back to their communities. The discourse generated by the Lubicon boycott of \"The Spirit Sings\" resulted in the formation of a task force that eventually released a ground-breaking report that continues to influence how museum professionals approach working with indigenous communities.\nIn addition to the boycott of \"The Spirit Sings\", the torch relay run was targeted by protesters for its sponsorship by Petro-Canada, which was \"invading indigenous territories (including Lubicon lands) across Canada\". Indigenous objection was not confined to the Lubicon Cree since \"protestors were present along the relay route in every province except Prince Edward Island\". Of these protests, former Olympiques Calgary Olympics (OCO) chairperson later wrote: \"There was no room for defiance or confrontation ...\"\nTibetan unrest at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China.\nSome pro-Tibetan independence groups, such as Students for a Free Tibet, initiated a campaign against the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics to protest for Tibetan independence, It also objected to the use of the Tibetan antelope (chiru) as the Fuwa Yingying. The Tibetan People's Movement has also demanded representation of Tibet with its own national flag. American film actor Richard Gere, chairman of the International Campaign for Tibet called for a boycott to put pressure on China to make Tibet independent. There were also plans by Tibetans in exile to hold their own version of the Olympics in May, at the headquarters of the exiled government.\nThe international journalist group Reporters Without Borders (RSF) advocated boycott to express concerns over violations of free speech and human rights in China. It hoped that international pressure could effect the release of prisoners of conscience and the upholding of promises made to the IOC regarding improvements in human rights.\nIn March 2008, Taiwan's president-elect Ma Ying-jeou threatened a Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee boycott \"if the situation in Tibet continues to worsen\". Masahisa Tsujitani, a Japanese craftsman who makes shots used by many Olympic athletes, announced 14 April he refuses to allow his wares to be used at the games to protest China's treatment of protesters in Tibet.\nDuring the Olympic torch lighting ceremony in Greece on 24 March 2008, three Reporters Without Borders journalists breached a cordon of 1,000 police at the ancient Olympia stadium and interrupted the speech of Liu Qi, head of the Beijing Games committee. One protester tried to snatch the microphone as another unrolled a black flag showing the Olympic rings as handcuffs.\nNearly 50 Tibetan exiles in India began a global torch relay 25 March 2008 with a symbolic \"Olympic\" flame that ended in Tibet on 8 August 2008, the day of the Summer Games' opening ceremonies in Beijing. Although the torch was heavily guarded by local police and Chinese security agents wearing blue track suits, protesters attempting to stop the relay or take the torch were a significant problem along the route.\nDisruption of the torch relay and foreign condemnation of China resulted in a backlash of nationalism and anti-foreigner sentiment in China. French goods and businesses were threatened with a reprisals for the assault on torch-bearers through Paris, France. French retailer Carrefour was boycotted, and there were flag burning protests outside some stores. Foreign media, particularly CNN, was criticised by state media outlet \"China Daily\" for its reporting of the Tibetan riots. The media reported that the attitudes of Han Chinese citizens towards non-Chinese and Chinese minorities in China noticeably worsened. In late April, Chinese Internet censors, who had previously permitted posts critical of non-Chinese, began blocking words such as \"Carrefour\", in what was seen as an attempt to calm tensions before the games.\nThreat against Uyghurs at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China.\nIn 2008, the Chinese government announced that several terrorist plots by Uyghur separatists to disrupt the 2008 Olympic Games involving kidnapping athletes, journalists and tourists were foiled. The security ministry said 35 arrests were made in recent weeks and explosives had been seized in Xinjiang province. It said 10 others were held when police smashed another plot based in Xinjiang back in January to disrupt the Games. However, Uyghur activists accused the Chinese of fabricating terror plots to crack down on the people of the region and prevent them airing legitimate grievances.\nSome foreign observers were also skeptical, questioning if China was inflating a terror threat to justify a clampdown on dissidents before the Olympics.\nIn the run-up to the Summer Olympics in Beijing, during which world attention was drawn by pro-Tibet protests along the Olympic torch relay, Uyghur separatist groups staged protests in several countries. According to the Chinese government, a suicide bombing attempt on a China Southern Airlines flight in Xinjiang was thwarted in March 2008.\nFour days before the Beijing Olympics, 16 Chinese police officers were killed and 16 injured in an attack in Kashgar by local merchants.\nChinese police injured and damaged the equipment of two Japanese journalists sent to cover the story. Four days later a bombing in Kuqa killed at least two people.\nLand disputes, poverty and cultural appropriation at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia.\nAgain building on lessons learned from previous Olympic Games held in Canada, the 2010 Winter Games saw an unprecedented level of involvement by and collaboration with indigenous people, namely in the form of the Four Host First Nations (FHFN). Composed of representatives from the Lil'wat, Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh First Nations from the Vancouver and Whistler areas, the FHFN was created to ensure that \"their cultures and traditions are respected and showcased throughout the planning, staging, and hosting of the 2010 Winter Games\". But former Neskonlith chief Arthur Manuel has argued that the FHFN was created to \"divide and rule over indigenous peoples in Canada\" and that \"Canada is deliberately trying to buy its way around its terrible human rights record by creating a media spin behind the Four Host First Nations\". Calling the FHFN a \"cheap and shallow scheme\", he points out that in 2007 Canada was one of only four countries to vote against the adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.\nThe 2010 Winter Games were met with massive protest locally and internationally. In October 2007, 1500 indigenous delegates at the Intercontinental Indigenous Gathering in Sonora, Mexico passed a resolution stating: \"We reject the 2010 Winter Olympics on sacred and stolen territory of Turtle Island – Vancouver, Canada.\" This launched a global boycott of the 2010 Games with indigenous protests of the 2010 Winter Games rallying under the slogan, \"No Olympics on stolen Native land.\" In an interview with \"Democracy Now!\", commentator and artist Gord Hill explains how the slogan refers to the lack of treaties in British Columbia: \"It's illegal, and it's actually immoral, because they were bound by their own laws to make treaties before they settled on any land or any business took place on sovereign indigenous land.\" The business referred to includes massive real estate developments as explained in a \"Dominion\" article:\nVast areas of unceded land that Indigenous communities depend on for hunting, fishing and general survival are at risk. Rivers, mountains and old-growth forests are being replaced by tourist resorts and highway expansions spurred by the 2010 games. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent to build new resorts and expand existing ones in order to attract and accommodate tourists, Olympic athletes and trainers.\nOne such development was the Sea-to-Sky highway expansion for which the Eagle Ridge Bluffs in North Vancouver (on Squamish territory) were to be destroyed. Harriet Nahanee, a 71-year-old Pacheedaht elder who had married into the Squamish First Nation, participated in a blockade to prevent this destruction. She was arrested along with 23 other protesters and imprisoned. Nahanee's already fragile health deteriorated while in prison and she died shortly after her release on February 24, 2007.\nThe 2010 Winter Games have also been criticized for being held in a city, province and country where so many indigenous people are living in desperate social conditions, particularly in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside (DTES), which, at the time of the Vancouver Games bid, was home to the largest off-reserve Aboriginal population in Vancouver. According to the International Indigenous Youth Network in 2007, pre-Olympic real estate development was causing increased homelessness in the DTES: \"512 low-income housing units were lost between June 2003 and June 2005 and almost 300 low-income housing units have been lost to rent increases in the same time period.\" Kat Norris of the Indigenous Action Group further explains why this is of particular concern to First Nations people, who, as of 2007, constituted 30% of homeless people in the DTES: \"The brutal history of residential schools coupled with present day racism and discrimination has meant that 'a high percentage of our people rely on services in the downtown eastside of Vancouver ... Many of these services are facing funding cuts. Those funding cuts were occurring while the province was expected to spend $1.5 billion on the Games, and the federal government, $2.5 billion.\nThe high incidence of violence against indigenous women is telling of Canada's treatment of indigenous peoples: 500 First Nations women are missing from across Canada, and 76 of them are from British Columbia, where the Games were being hosted. It has been estimated that of the 69 women on the official list of those missing from the DTES in Vancouver, at least a third of them are of indigenous ancestry, compared to 1.9% representation of indigenous women in the general population of Vancouver.\nIndigenous people have also raised concerns about the marketing and branding of the 2010 Winter Games, starting with the selection of the official Games logo, which was based on the Inuit symbol of the inuksuk, and given the name \"Ilanaaq\", which translates to \"friend\". Several indigenous leaders criticized the Vancouver Olympic Organizing Committee (VANOC) for not consulting with indigenous groups on the selection of the emblem, and for choosing one that did not reflect the local First Nations of the host city. President of the Union of BC Indian Chiefs Chief Stewart Phillip said: \"The First Nations community at large is disappointed with the selection ... The decision-makers have decided not to reflect the First Nations and the Pacific region in the design of the logo ... I can't help but notice the remarkable resemblance it has to Pac-Man.\" Former Nunavut Commissioner Peter Irniq also criticized the design: \"Inuit never build inuksuit with head, legs and arms\"; and the process: \"[Irniq] says every inukshuk has a meaning and a reason why it was built in a certain location. He says building the structures should not be taken lightly.\" Criticism was also directed at the fact that the logo designers were not Inuit or even First Nations. Some Inuit, in criticizing the adoption of \"Ilanaaq\", explicitly made the connection between cultural appropriation and commodificaton, \"arguing that it dishonoured the traditional functions of inuksuk and risked turning them into commodities that could be sold for tourist consumption\".\nThough the 2010 Winter Olympic Games did consult with indigenous people more than in past Canadian Olympic Games, that collaboration does not seem to have extended to resolving outstanding land treaties nor addressing the marginalization of indigenous people in Canada.\nIrish Republican protest during the torch relay at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, England.\nDuring the 2012 Summer Olympic torch relay in Northern Ireland, Irish republican supporters had disputed the event in Northern Ireland to protest against the British intervention in Northern Ireland. During the events of the relay, the police and the military had arrested several suspected IRA members.\nArgentine ad about the Falkland Islands before the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, England.\nOn 2 May 2012, on the 30th anniversary of the sinking of the Argentine cruiser ARA \"General Belgrano\", an advertising film depicting the captain of Argentina's hockey team, Fernando Zylberberg, training in Stanley, Falkland Islands, was broadcast in Argentina under the slogan \"To compete on British soil, we train on Argentine soil.\" While it was claimed by several major Argentine newspapers that the film had not been commissioned by the Argentine government, with it being produced by the local office of the Young &amp; Rubicam advertising agency, the rights to it were purchased by the Office of the President for national broadcast. An IOC statement said \"the games should not be part of a political platform\", while Argentine Olympic Committee President Gerardo Werthein stated that \"the Olympic Games cannot be used to make political gestures\". Zylberberg stated that he had been unaware that the film would be used as a political advert. He subsequently was not selected for the Argentine hockey squad.\nAnniversary of the Circassian genocide at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Krasnodar Krai.\nCircassian organisations have also spoken out against the 2014 Olympics, arguing that the Games will take place on land that had been inhabited by them since the beginning of recorded history by their ancestors until 1864, when the resolution of the Russian–Circassian War was stated to have caused the disappearance (variously by death or deportation) of 1.5 million Circassians, or 90–94% of the Circassian nation. They demanded the Sochi 2014 Olympics be cancelled or moved unless Russia would apologize for what the Circassians regarded to be a genocide. Some Circassian groups have not expressed outright opposition to the Olympics but argue that symbols of Circassian history and culture should be included in the format, as Australia, the United States, and Canada did with their indigenous populations in 2000, 2002, and 2010 respectively.\nThe games are viewed to be particularly offensive because they include the date of the 150th anniversary of what they consider a genocide. It has thus been a rallying cry for Circassian nationalists.\nIn particular, there is much ire over the use of a hill called \"Red Hill\". In 1864, a group of Circassians apparently tried to return home but were attacked and a battle ensued, ending in their massacre, and attaining the name \"Red Hill\" (for the blood spilled). There were skiing and snowboarding events planned to be held on this hill.\nNBC analyst comment at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, Gangwon Province.\nDuring the opening ceremony, NBC analyst Joshua Cooper Ramo noted that Japan occupied Korea from 1910 to 1945, and then added, \"But every Korean will tell you that Japan is a cultural and technological and economic example that has been so important to their own transformation.\" In \"The Korea Times\", Jung Min-ho called the comment \"incorrect and insensitive,\" writing that \"Tens of thousands of Koreans and non-Koreans alike have criticized Ramo and NBC Sports on their social media, urging them to correct this misinformation and apologize.\" Koreans still feel the pain of all those years under the Japanese occupation. In response to this backlash, NBC issued an on-air apology and Ramo was fired from his job at NBC the next day.\nAcknowledgement of the Liancourt Islands and the Kuril Islands at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan.\nRussian and South Korean officials took issue with a map of the torch relay on the Games' official website, which depicted the disputed Liancourt Rocks (territory claimed by Japan but governed by South Korea) and Kuril Islands (territory claimed by Japan and Russia) as part of Japan. Maria Zakharova, spokeswoman of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, described the inclusion as \"illegal\", and accused the Tokyo Organising Committee of \"politicising\" the Games.\nUsage of the Rising Sun Flag at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan.\nThe Japanese government's refusal to ban the controversial Rising Sun Flag in the Olympic sites has been criticized as going against the Olympic spirit, as the flag is offensive to East and Southeast Asian peoples due to its historical usage by the Imperial Japanese military during World War II, as well as its current usage by racist hate groups in Japan, such as Zaitokukai. The flag, often compared to Nazi swastika, is associated with war crimes and atrocities committed under the Japanese Empire, as well as contemporary Japan's far-right nationalist attempts to revise, deny, and romanticise its imperialistic past.\nThe controversial flag is currently banned by FIFA, and Japan was sanctioned by Asian Football Confederation after Japanese football fans flew it at an AFC Champions League in 2017.\nIn September 2019, the South Korean parliamentary committee for sports asked the organizers of 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo to ban the Rising Sun Flag, and the Chinese Civil Association for Claiming Compensation from Japan sent a letter to the International Olympic Committee in order to ban the flag.\nThe Tibet, Xinjiang and Hong Kong controversy at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, China.\nDuring the bidding process of the Olympics, many Tibetan protesters had criticized the IOC for allowing China to host the 2022 Olympics due to policies against Tibetans. In the aftermath of the 2019 leak of the Xinjiang papers and the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests, calls were made for a boycott of the 2022 games."

Originally the club occupied land on Drayton Road in Harristown, then on a block of land in the area now best known as St Vincent's Hospital, then relocated to the now Toowoomba Turf Club land and after much negotiation found a more permanent home in Willowburn where Bailey Henderson Hospital is located. In approximately 1924 it was decided that the club needed more permanency and therefore members negotiated both the purchase and acceptance of gifted land from Marmaduke Manley who had suggested the move, that the club has now owned and occupied since 1925.\nThe official opening of the club took place on 4 December 1926, when Queensland Premier William McCormack hit a long drive to officially open the course for play. However, the links had been open for play unofficially for some time beforehand.\nAt the 115th annual general meeting on 30 May 2011, the members of the Toowoomba Golf Club – Middle Ridge, elected Nancy Young as inaugural female club president. Toowoomba Golf Club joined a select few golf clubs throughout Australia who had elected a lady to the office of Club President.\nAt the 2012 Queensland Golf Industry Awards the club won the Regional Tournament of the Year award for their hosting of the BMW and Westpac Pro Am Classic in September 2011.\nThe women's course record was set in June 2014 when 14-year-old Darcy Habgood scored a one-under round of 72."

        "title": "Laidley Golf Club",
        "text": "Laidley Golf Club is a picturesque twelve hole golf course situated adjacent to Lake Dyer located on Gatton-Laidley Road, Laidley Heights, Shire of Laidley, Queensland, Australia. Officially opened in 1951 as a nine-hole course, it was extended to twelve holes during 2005. The golf course is 6074 metres in length.\nHistory.\nAt a meeting held on 3 December 1928, it was decided to form a golf club to be known as the Laidley Golf Club. The Club held its Opening Day on Sunday 9 December 1928 on fourteen holes prepared at the Show Grounds. The best round of the day being 94. In April 1930 they had enough money to purchase sand and Dr Sweeney, the President, used reaping hook and lawn mower on the course and R E Allen &amp; R A Ditton levelled the greens and spread sand. At the Annual Meeting held in March 1931, Mr. Watkins was congratulated on being the Club's first Club Champion and the holder of the course record of 72 for eighteen holes. The 1931 season was played on much improved links, but it was becoming increasingly evident that this ground was not suited for a golf course because of its limited area – about nine acres. In November 1931 it was decided to abandon the showgrounds and establish new links on the Recreation Reserve which was about forty acres in area, not more than 200 yards from the business area of the main street. The work of laying out the new links proceeded and full use was made of a gully which ran right through the reserve, providing a natural hazard for six holes. As the ground was perfectly level, the new links were a great improvement. Opening Day for these new links was held on Saturday 16 April 1932. In 1934 the first Associates Championship was won by Mrs. M.G. Watkin. In August 1935, R A Ditton, of Laidley, scooped the pool of golf events at Royal Queensland, winning the Country championship with a total of 168, the Royal Queensland Cup with an aggregate of 142, and tying in a Country Week handicap. He won by four shots over D. Von Nida. In 1938 it was decided to hold the Club's first Open Day on 23 October- this Open Day was to become an Annual Event.\nFrom 1941 to 1946 the club was suspended, due to World War II. In March 1946 the club was reformed, but was short-lived. At a meeting in September 1948, it was decided to revive the game on new links at a new site, the old course now being no longer suitable. On 9 November 1948 the first step towards providing a golf course between Laidley and Forest Hill was taken, by putting down a deposit of £5 on land owned by Mr. Maurice Dayman, one mile from Laidley (now in the suburb of Laidley Heights). The sale of the land was finalised on 28 March 1949, and the site of the proposed new golf club at Laidley was stated to be the best seen for some time, by the golf architect (Mr. T. Southcombe) and the chairman of the Queensland Golf Council (Mr. D. Duncan). Both men were enthusiastic about the site's undulating terrain, soil, elevation and the scenic aspect of Dyer's Lake from the clubhouse. On Sunday 15 April 1951 the new course (and current site) was officially opened by the president of the Queensland Golf Council, Mr. W.G. Duncan, as he drove a ball down the first fairway of Laidley's new nine-hole golf course."

        "text": "The Midwest Professional Basketball Association (MPBA) was a professional men's basketball league that began play in January 2015. The six charter members were: Bloomington Flex, Champaign Swarm, Chicago Force, Gateway Steam, St. Louis RiverSharks and Windy City Groove.\nOf the six inaugural season teams, only the Bloomington Flex have previously competed. The Flex were 2012 and 2013 champions of the Premier Basketball League (PBL). After a perfect 18-0 record in 2014, the team was suspended and then dismissed from the PBL by league officials after a scheduling conflict in the 2014 PBL playoffs.\nMPBA is organized by Ed Schumer, Commissioner and CEO, Steven A. \"Buzz\" Zeller, Chief Operating Officer, Craig Fata, Associate Commissioner and Chief Communications Officer, and A.J. Guyton, Associate Commissioner and Director of Basketball Personnel.\nThe league appears to have ceased operations in 2017.\nHistory.\nThe league tipped off its inaugural season on January 2, 2015, as the St. Louis RiverSharks and Gateway Steam played at Family Arena in St. Charles, Missouri. St. Louis defeated Gateway 108-96. Two more games took place at Family Arena on January 4, as the RiverSharks hosted the Bloomington Flex and the Gateway Steam hosted the Chicago Force. The RiverSharks upset the Flex 113-109, ending Bloomington's 24-game win streak, which had dated back to May 2013. The Steam defeated the Force 115-103.\nThe first time all six teams were in action at the same time was January 15, when the Flex hosted the RiverSharks in Bloomington, the Champaign Swarm hosted the Steam, and the Force hosted the Windy City Groove. All three games were broadcast in high definition via multi-camera productions on the league's website.\nThe 2015 regular season ended on April 7. The playoffs began two nights later in Bloomington in a Final Four-style format. The St. Louis RiverSharks secured the top seed with a 16-4 record by virtue of a 3-1 season series win over the Bloomington Flex, who also finished 16-4. The Champaign Swarm entered as the #3 seed with a 15-5 record, and the Gateway Steam were fourth at 5-15.\nThe first game of the semifinals saw the RiverSharks beat the Steam 153-129. In the second game, the Swarm handed the Flex their first-ever playoff loss, 111-100, to advance to the championship game.\nThe championship game, held April 10 at U.S. Cellular Coliseum was won by the Swarm 115-106, after trailing by as many as 17 points in the first half and by as many as 13 in the fourth quarter. Champaign's Avery Smith was named Playoff Most Valuable Player after averaging 32 points and seven rebounds per game in the postseason.\nOn September 9, 2015, the Lima Express, which had played their first two seasons in the Premier Basketball League, were announced as the first-ever expansion team in the MPBA. Following the Lima announcement, on September 21, the league announced the Pontiac 66ers as the league's second expansion team for the 2016 season.\nThen, on October 30, 2015, the MPBA announced the Bloomington Flex, which were a founding member of the league, would not be playing in the MPBA in the upcoming season, because the team was \"unable to submit, per league rules, a venue agreement or playing dates for the upcoming season.\" The same day, the Flex announced they would not be playing in any league in 2016. The Flex's departure leaves the league with seven teams for the 2016 season.\nThe league announced on November 5, 2015, that it had assumed control of the Chicago Force and Windy City Groove franchises, citing \"league rules regarding ownership and team operation guidelines.\" Coaches Rick Pryor and Handy Johnson, who had coached the respective teams in 2015, would be retained, the league said. General Manager Don Starks would be replaced with Jay Carter as GM and Kelly Norris-Jones as Assistant GM.\nOn November 13, 2015, the league announced that the Chicago Force would be changing their name to the Chicago Blues, citing the existence of a women's tackle football team of the same name in the same city, which had been in operation for thirteen years. On the same date a trademark application was filed by Chicago Basketball League Corporation for the name and logo of the Windy City Groove, despite the fact the name and logo were created by Joyce Thomas of Joyce Thomas Designs in October 2015. \nOn December 14 the former front office of the Groove announced they would be joining the American Basketball Association with their season set to begin December 20, and continuing to use the Groove name and logo. A December 17, 2015 email from ABA CEO Joe Newman to MPBA officials stated the name and logo in question were not to be used in the ABA until the matter was resolved. Windy City defeated Chicago Fury 109-106 on Dec. 20, and continued to use the name and logo in the ABA, despite a cease and desist letter issued by MPBA attorneys on January 7, 2016.\nOn July 20, 2016, the league announced the Jacksonville (Illinois) Generals would be joining the MPBA for the 2017 season. The team will play its games at MacMurray College.\nOn August 9, 2016, the league announced the Eureka (Illinois) Blaze would be joining the MPBA for the 2017 season. The team will play its games at Eureka High School.\nOn August 21, 2016, the league announced that the Lima Express will be moving to Bloomington, Illinois for the 2017 season. The team will play its games at U.S. Cellular Coliseum. They will also be the hosts of the 2017 postseason tournament.\nOn August 31, 2016, the league observed the milestone of advancing its 50th player to a higher domestic or foreign league since beginning play in January 2015, when 2016 Most Valuable Player Alfonzo Houston of the Pontiac 66ers signed with Nuova Polisportiva Stabia in Italy. To date, the MPBA has sent two players to the National Basketball Development League (NBA D-League), 47 players to overseas teams, and one to training camp with the NBA's Chicago Bulls.\n2015 Awards.\nMost Valuable Player: Justin Bocot, Bloomington Flex\nCoach of the Year: Al Grushkin, St. Louis RiverSharts\nDefensive Player of the Year: Darius Smith, Chicago Force\nSixth Man of the Year: Aaron Weaver, Champaign Swarm\nPlayoff MVP: Avery Smith, Champaign Swarm\nAll-MPBA First Team: Justin Bocot (unanimous selection); Jerrold Brooks, St. Louis RiverSharks; Anthony Slack, Bloomington Flex (unanimous selection); Keith DeWitt, St. Louis RiverSharks; Marcus Goode, St. Louis RiverSharks.\nAll-MPBA Second Team: Nate Fuqua, Windy City Groove; Tarvin Gaines, Gateway Steam; Aaron Weaver, Champaign Swarm; Matt Salley, Bloomington Flex; Derrick McDonald, Chicago Force; Lavante Douglas, Windy City Groove.\nAll-Defensive Team: Darius Smith (unanimous selection); Nate Fuqua, Terry Evans, St. Louis RiverSharks; Keith DeWitt, Anthony Slack; Marcus Goode.\n2016 Awards.\nMost Valuable Player: Alfonzo Houston, Pontiac 66ers\nCoach of the Year: Durrell Robinson, Pontiac 66ers\nDefensive Player of the Year: Connell Crossland, Gateway Steam\nSixth Man of the Year: C.J.

        "title": "History of rugby union matches between Leinster and Munster",
        "text": "Leinster versus Munster is, according to some Irish commentators, one of the biggest provincial rivalries in world rugby, which dates back to 1879, the year of founding of the provincial sides. Games between the two have occurred on an annual basis since the inception of the Irish inter-provincial championship in 1946. Since the beginning of the inter-provincials in 1946, Leinster hold a 62–45 advantage in overall wins, with five draws. Additionally, since the inception of the Celtic League in the 2001–02 season, Leinster hold a 35–18 advantage in overall wins, with one draw in that time.\nThe fierce rivalry has grown since the turn of professionalism as both teams battled for domestic and European dominance, and has sometimes become a heated and bitter affair, on and off the pitch. The rivalry is heightened by the fact that Leinster and Munster have been among the stronger provinces in Irish rugby, and among the strongest teams in European competition.\nThe birth of the modern era rivalry could be attributed to the Heineken Cup semi-final in 2006, when Munster defeated Leinster 30–6 in Lansdowne Road en route to winning their first European Championship. Munster then went on to enjoy a period of success by again winning the European trophy in 2008. A shift in fortunes occurred in 2009 however, when Leinster defeated Munster 25–6 at the same stage of the competition in front of 82,208 spectators at Croke Park, which was a world record attendance for a club game; Leinster went on in 2009 to claim the first of four European titles to Munster's two. The matches between the two teams regularly sells out their stadiums.\nIn addition to European competition, the two sides regularly face each other in the United Rugby Championship. Leinster and Munster have consistently been among the strongest teams in that tournament, with Leinster reaching twelve finals winning seven, and Munster reaching seven finals winning three. They have finished top two in the Pro14 championship three times — with Leinster defeating Munster 24–20 in 2002, Munster winning 19–9 in the 2011 final and Leinster defeating Munster 16–6 in the 2021 final.\nStatistics.\nBiggest win\nLeinster: 32–0 (1958–59)\nMunster: 30–6 (2005–06)\nHighest scoring match\nLeinster 40–45 Munster (85 points, 1996–97)\nLowest scoring match\nMunster 0–0 Leinster (0 points, 1953–54)\nMost consecutive wins\nLeinster: 6 (2018–19 – 2020–21)\nMunster: 3 (1989–90 – 1991–92, 1996–97 – 1998–99, 2004–05 – 2005–06)\nHighest attendance\n82,208 (Heineken Cup semi-final, Croke Park, May 2009)"

The following year Dimbula A&amp;CC, captained by Lyn Simpson, became the first club from Up-Country to win the league by defeating the previous years title holders, Ceylonese R&amp;FC, 6-0.\nThe Kandy Sporting Club made their first appearance in a Clifford Cup final in 1954, where they lost 21-5 against Ceylonese R&amp;FC. Ceylonese R&amp;FC went on to win the title in the next two successive years (1955–56) The title was shared for the first time in 1959 when Dimbula and Ceylonese R &amp; FC competed in an 11-all draw. In 1957 the Colombo H&amp;FC, led by St. John Davies, won the league for the first time against a combined Dimbula/Dickoya team, skippered by Malcolm Wright.

The format of the competition was also changed, whereby all 13 clubs had to play each other once on a home and away basis in alternate years and at the end of the league season the best eight teams competed in a knock-out tournament for the Clifford Cup.\nIn 1971, led by captain and coach Y. C. Chang, Colombo H&amp;FC secured the league title. The 1972 final was played between Police SC, captained by Anton Benedict, and Colombo H&amp;FC, led by Y. C.

The SRFU decided to award the Clifford Cup to the winners of a separate knock-out tournament, conducted amongst the 'A' Division Clubs, held at the end of the regular season. The inaugural winner of the John Player Rugby Championship was Police SC captained by Sunil Sahabandu, who also clinched the rugby triple by also winning the Rugby Sevens title and the Clifford Cup. Police SC subsequently retained the John Player League title for the following four years, under the leadership of Sunil Sahabandu (1985), H. Premasiri (1986), Muruga Jayaratne (1987), Ajantha Samarakoon (1988) and M. H.

The inaugural Caltex Rugby League champions were Colombo H&amp;FC, captained by Nazim Mohammed, winning 12 out of 14 matches, including a 33-11 victory over the previous league champions Kandy SC, only losing one game and drawing one. This was the last time Colombo H&amp;FC were successful in winning the premiership. The runners-up that year were Ceylonese R&amp;FC.\nIn 2001 Old Zahirians SC were promoted to the Caltex League, after finishing third in the 'B' division in 2000, the same year as the club won the Lahore International Ten-A-side Rugby Tournament.

The Caltex league competition in 2006 was subsequently expanded to a twelve team competition with the introduction of Dimbula/Dickoya from the Central Province, Jawatte Lions from the Western Province and the Galle RFC from the Southern Province. The tournament was split into two grades, with six teams, Kandy SC, Havelock SC, Army SC, CH &amp; FC, CR &amp; FC battling out at the top with the remaining six other teams, Old Zahirians, Police, Air Force in the next tier.\nIn 2007 a further three teams were added to the Caltex 'A' Division League Rugby Championship: Peterson SC, Kandy Youth, Kurunegala and Combined Universities increasing the number of sides from 12 teams to 16.

The first-round in 2007 was played from 18 May to 1 July and the second-round from 6 July to 5 August. The top six teams in the A1 first-round competed in the second-round for the Cup, while the last two sides in A1 competed in the Plate with the top six of A2. The remaining four teams in A2 played for the Bowl and were joined by two sides from the 'B' Division (Rudra Rajasingham Memorial Trophy). The Plate final was contested between Air Force SC and Old Zahirians, with Air Force being successful.\nIn 2008 the competition was scaled back to eight teams, being Kandy SC, Havelocks SC, CH &amp; FC, CR &amp; FC, Police SC, Army SC, Air Force and Old Zahirians. The league champions once again were Kandy SC, with Air Force SC securing the Plate. \nNavy SC rejoined the competition in 2009 with the tournament committee deciding to have an eighth place play-off between the Navy SC and the bottom-seeded Old Zahirians SC. The Old Zahirians Sporting Club refused to participate in the play-off game on 7 May and were forced to leave the competition. The Plate champions for 2009 were Police SC.\nKandy Sports Club were successful in 2010, clinching the rugby double, by winning both the Caltex League championship and the Clifford Cup, with Ceylonese R&amp;FC coming second and Police SC securing the Plate championship over Havelock SC.\nIn 2011 the Caltex League commenced in the 1st week of June, a week after Sri Lanka's Asian Five Nation's match against Japan, with the season ending before September, in order for the national sevens team to compete in the Shanghai Sevens on 4–7 September. During the season the previously undefeated Kandy SC were beaten 29-25 by Navy SC and the title ended up coming down to the last game of the season, where Kandy SC defeated Havelock SC and relegated Navy SC to second place. The 2011 'Plate' champion was Air Force SC.\nDialog League: 2012 to 2021.\nIn 2012 the competition was renamed the Dialog League after Dialog Axiata, a national telecommunications company, entered into a five-year sponsorship deal with the SLRFU. In the same year the competition was expanded to nine teams with the inclusion of a team from Nawalapitiya, the Up Country Lions. The competition began in June and at the end of the first round, the top four teams were Havelock SC, Navy SC, Kandy SC and newcomers Up-Country Lions SC, who then competed for the league title. The rest of the teams competed in the plate tournament. Havelock Sports Club were the eventual 2012 champions, breaking Kandy's dominance of the league, by defeating them 50–9. It was Havelocks' first league title in thirty-one years. Army SC were successful in the Plate final defeating Police SC 21–19.\nThe following year a team from Hambantota, the Hambantota Sharks, was added to form a ten team competition. The timing of the season was amended with it now running from November 2013 and concluding in January 2014, as such there was no winner for 2013. The winner of the 2013/14 Dialog rugby league was Navy SC, who defeated Havelock SC in the final game of the season, 20–13, capping off an undefeated season. It was the first time in the club's history that they have won the league trophy. The winner of the Plate for the 2013/14 season was Police SC.\nIn 2014/15 the Up Country Lions withdrew from the league after only competing for two years, with the majority of their players signing with Ceylonese R&amp;FC. The 2014/15 season's format was also changed, previously in the second round the top six played in the cup category and bottom four teams played in the plate. Instead for the 2014/15 season all the nine teams played both home and away matches in round one and two with the top points scoring team clinching the league title. In January 2015 both the Hambantota Sharks and the Colombo H&amp;FC withdrew from the league competition before the second round commenced, although Colombo H&amp;FC subsequently rejoined, resulting in the second round being contested between the eight remaining teams. The 2014/15 champion was Kandy SC, who despite losing their last match against second placed Navy SC, 12–11, and ending with equal points on the league ladder, scored an overall 73 tries to Navy's 62. Political influence was affecting the game around at this time where former president Mahinda Rajapaksa's sons were putting their political power to turn the game in to their hands.\nIn 2015/16 the league commenced in November 2015 and was contested by eight teams. At the end of the season, in February 2016, Kandy SC were undefeated and clear winners by two games from second placed Havelock SC, securing the league title for the 17th time.\n2016/17 league commenced with 8 teams, with Kandy SC taking the title again, winning 12 games out of 14 in the season.\nNippon Paint League: 2022 - present.\nFollowing a dispute with Sri Lanka Rugby, Dialog Axiata pulled its sponsorship of the Club Rugby League Championship a few days before the start of the 2022 season. With no club rugby having been played since March 2020, the Inter-Club Rugby League was relaunched without a sponsor in January 2022. A new sponsorship deal with Nippon Paint Lanka was announced six weeks into the season. Kandy SC were declared the champions for 2022, although the competition was halted due to the 2022 Sri Lankan political crisis with two matches remaining in the season. In 2024 Ceylonese R&amp;FC secured the championship title for the first time in 26 years, by defeating the defending champions, Kandy SC, in the last match of the season.\nTotal wins.\nUpdated to the 2021/2022 season:"

        "text": "Cycling in Boston has been a popular activity since the late 19th century for both recreation and commuting, and it has grown in popularity in recent years, aided by improving cycling infrastructure. It is especially prevalent around the campuses of the numerous universities in the city.\nDifferent areas in Boston have varying degrees of bike friendliness.\nHistory.\nAt the end of the 19th century, cycling was especially popular in Boston, and \"Outing Magazine\" at the time described Boston as \"the bicycling paradise of America\". The city's cyclists were pivotal in the formation of the national organization League of American Wheelmen, and Massachusetts had the largest per capita membership in the league in the 1890s and the largest percentage of women members.\nBike sharing.\nBluebikes, the city's bicycle sharing system was launched on July 28, 2011, originally named Hubway, with 610 bicycles and 60 stations in the City of Boston. Later, the system was expended to Brookline, Cambridge, and Somerville. As of September 2016, the system has deployed 158 stations with a fleet of over 1,461 bikes. PBSC Urban Solutions, a company based in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, supplies bikes and docking stations.\nThe system is operated by Motivate. As of October 2014, it had more than 12,500 annual members, and an over 2.5 million trips have been taken by Hubway riders since 2011 launch. \nFrom May 9, 2018, the system was rebranded Bluebikes following a marketing deal with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts.\nBike sharing companies Lime and Spin won a contract from the Metropolitan Area Planning Council to introduce dockless rentals to certain suburbs in summer 2018. Lime was already operating in Malden, and the MAPC system expands dockless rentals to Arlington, Bedford, Belmont, Chelsea, Everett, Malden, Medford, Melrose, Milton, Needham, Newton, Revere, Waltham, Watertown, and Winthrop. Dockless bikes are excluded from the Hubway operating area because that system has an exclusive contract with Boston, Brookline, Cambridge, and Somerville."

        "text": "Montevideo Rowing Club is an Uruguayan sports club located in the city of Montevideo. Originally established as a rowing club, the institution also hosts the practise of basketball, futsal, gymnastics, handball, judo, karate, tennis and olympic weightlifting.\nMontevideo Rowing, founded in 1874, is one of the oldest sports clubs in Uruguay after Montevideo Cricket (MVCC) (founded in 1861 and also considered the oldest in Latin America). The club is also notable because three rowers from the institution won Olympic medals.\nHistory.\nThe club was founded on May 8, 1874 in the Hotel Central, being José Ellauri its first president. Montevideo R.C. was established with the purpose of spreading the practise of sports in Uruguay, mainly rowing. The club is considered a pioneer in football, along with Albion F.C. and the C.U.R.C.C. (both founded in 1891). In fact, the first inter-clubs football match was played between Montevideo Rowing and Montevideo Cricket in 1881. The Montevideo R.C. football team was also part of the first international club match, when on August 15, 1889, the club joined forces with Montevideo Cricket Club (under the name \"Montevideo Team\") to play a Buenos Aires combined on August 15, 1889.\nThe first boats acquired were second-hand goods and stored at the Barraca Elliott, club's first headquarters opened in 1874. One of the first rowers was Mr. Fraser, who competed side by side with some Argentine rowers. Arthur Boutell was the first captain for the club and winner in 1875 along with his brother Frank. Montevideo Rowing and Buenos Aires Rowing Club were the only two rowing clubs in the Río de la Plata area by then.\nOther international achievements by the Boutell Brothers were in 1875, 1876 and 1877. Carlos Sturzenegger was other notable athlete from the club, winning the Tigre Boat Club trophy competing against the best Argentine rowers in single scull.\nWhen the port of Montevideo was built in 1908 the club had to set a new location near that place, where it remained until September 9, 1928, when the institution inaugurated its new headquarters on the Río Branco street with a building designed by Arq. Mauricio Cravotto.\nDuring the 1930s, a rower from the club, Guillermo Douglas, gained notoriety for being South American champion and winning the Bronze medal at the 1932 Summer Olympics. Other achievements by the club include the Copa América (then \"Copa Challenger\"), winning the trophy 8 times in 10 years. The next years saw the raise of Eduardo Risso, another extraordinary athlete that won the local and South American championships apart from being the second athlete of the club to win an Olympic medal, a silver one in the 1948 Summer Olympics.\nThe third (and last to date) rower from the club to win an Olympic medal was Miguel Seijas in 1952. Other successful rowers during those time were Paulo Carvalho and Mariano Caulín (runners-up in the 1959 Pan American Games held in Chicago). Martín Caulín and Gustavo Pérez would win the next edition of the games in 1963. Mariano Caulín is also considered one of the best athletes from the club, having won more than 50 regattas during his career, a record that still remains.\nHonours.\nSome championships won by the club include:\nOlympic games.\nThree rowers from the club won medals for Uruguay at three different Olympic Games:"

        "text": "In the 1982–83 cricket season, the Sri Lankan national cricket team toured to India to play the Indian national cricket team. The tour included one Test match. That match was drawn. Three players scored centuries; Duleep Mendis scored 105 in both Sri Lankan innings, and Sunil Gavaskar and Sandeep Patil scored 155 and 144 respectively, both in India's first innings. Three players took a five-wicket haul in the game; Dilip Doshi took five wickets for 85 runs in Sri Lanka's first innings, Kapil Dev took five wickets for 110 runs and Ashantha de Mel took five wickets for 68 runs.\nThe series also included a three-match One Day International (ODI) series. The first ODI, at Gandhi Sports Complex Ground, Amritsar, was won by India by a margin of 78 runs. The man of the match was Dilip Doshi, who four wickets for 44 runs of ten overs. The second ODI was at Feroz Shah Kotla, Delhi. The match was won by India by six wickets, with the Indian player Kris Srikkanth winning the man of the match award after scoring 95 runs. The third and final ODI, held at the Karnataka State Cricket Association Stadium, Bangalore was won by India by a margin of six wickets. Srikkanth scored 92, therefore he received his second man of the match award for the series in a match that completed a series white wash by India. The top scorer in the series was Sri Lankan Roy Dias, who scored two centuries in a series his country didn't win a match in. The top wicket-taker was Dilip Doshi, who took six wickets. The top four highest wicket takers were all Indians, with Doshi taking six; Kapil Dev and Madan Lal taking five; and Roger Binny taking four. Three Sri Lankans took three wickets; Bandula Warnapura, Ajit de Silva and Ashantha de Mel.\nBackground.\nBefore the tour, only one ODI match had been played between the countries and no test matches had been played. That one ODI was in the 1979 Cricket World Cup, held in England, so the 1982–83 tour was the first series between the two countries. The 1979 match was a 60 over match that was held over three days; the first day was one innings, the second day was a rest day and the third day was the second team's inning. The match was won by Sri Lanka with a winning margin of 47 runs. Both teams didn't progress out of group B to the semi-finals.\nIn the two years before the Sri Lankan cricket team's tour to India in 1982–83, India played 15 test matches and 17 ODIs. Of the 15 test matches, India won two matches, drew ten matches and lost three matches. The team won 5 of their ODIs in the period and lost the other 12. Comparably, in the same time period, Sri Lanka played four tests, of which they lost three and drew one. Sri Lanka also played five ODIs, of which, they won two and lost three.\nSquads.\nThe following players represented India in at least one Test or One-day International during the 1982–83 tour:\nThe following players represented Sri Lanka on the 1982–83 tour of India:\nTest series.\nOnly Test.\nThe first and only test in the series started when the Sri Lankan captain, Bandula Warnapura, won the toss and elected to bat on 17 September 1982. The match, played at MA Chidambaram Stadium, started badly for Sri Lanka when they lost their first two wickets for only 11 runs with Warnapura scoring four and, fellow opener, Mahes Goonatilleke making seven. For the third-wicket partnership, Duleep Mendis and Roy Dias put on 153 runs before Dias was dismissed leg before wicket (LBW) for 60. The next batsman who lost their wicket was Dias, who scored 105 off 123 balls. By that time Sri Lanka was on 204 runs. Arjuna Ranatunga and Anura Ranasinghe were both dismissed when Sri Lanka was on 205. Ranatunga made 25 and Ranasinghe made 0 (also known as a duck). The Sri Lankan number six and eight batsmen both made scores in the forties. Ranjan Madugalle and Somachandra de Silva put on a seventh-wicket partnership of 77 runs before Madugalle was dismissed for 46. De Silva was out for 49 when Sri Lanka had a score of eight wickets for 304 runs. Sri Lankas innings ended 44 runs later when Ajit de Silva was dismissed for a duck. Ashantha de Mel was left not out as Sri Lanka was bowled out for 346 runs of 92.5 overs. Of the five Indians to bowl in the innings, three of them took wickets. Dilip Doshi took five wickets for 85 runs, Kapil Dev took three wickets for 97 runs and Madan Lal took two wickets for 72 runs.\nIn reply to Sri Lanka's 346, India made a good start when their two openers made a first-wicket partnership of 156. The partnership ended when Arun Lal was dismissed for 63 runs. The second-wicket partnership between Sunil Gavaskar and Dilip Vengsarkar was even bigger than the first-wicket one. Their stand of 173 ended when number three Vengsarkar, was run out for 90. By the stage of the fourth batsmen's dismissal India was three wickets for 347 runs, already one run ahead of Sri Lanka. The fourth batsmen to fall was Gavaskar who scored 155 off 293 balls. The next partnership was an even 50 between Sandeep Patil and Yashpal Sharma. India was on 403 when Sharma was dismissed for 17. Kapil Dev was India's seventh batsmen and he made an 85 run stand with Patil before Dev was dismissed for 31. Madan Lal and Patil batted until India was six wickets for 556 runs. At that point Indian captain Gavaskar declared. Patil made 114 not out and Lal made 37 not out. Sri Lankan captain Warnapura tried seven bowlers, of which, only three took wickets. Those wicket-takers were Ashantha de Mel, Somachandra de Silva and Ravi Ratnayeke. De Mel took two wickets for 133, de Silva took two wickets for 162 runs and Ratnayeke took one wicket for 75 runs.\nSri Lanka's second inning started in the same ways their first one did. That is, Bandula Warnapura was out for six. Roy Dias and Ravi Ratnayeke made a second-wicket partnership of 41 before Ratnayeke, who had been promoted up the batting order from ninth to opener, was caught for six. Dias and Duleep Mendis again made a century partnership, this time they made 110 together before Dias was dismissed for 97, his second half century for the match. By the time Sri Lanka reached five wickets for 202 runs, Arjuna Ranatunga and Ranjan Madugalle had both been dismissed, Ranatunga for 15 and Madugalle for four. Mendis and Ranasinghe put on a spirited fightback for the sixth-wicket partnership. They had scored 89 runs together when Mendis was dismissed for 105. The seventh-wicket partnership between Ranasinghe and Somachandra de Silva was worth 49 runs. Ranasinghe was dismissed for 70 which was a polar opposite to his duck in the first innings. At the time of Ranasinghe's dismissal Sri Lanka were seven wickets for 340 runs. The last four batsmen batted around de Silva, who made 46 not out, and got Sri Lanka to 394 of 96.3 overs. Only four Indian's bowled in the innings. They were Kapil Dev, Madan Lal, Dilip Doshi and Rakesh Shukla. Dev took five wickets for 110 runs, Doshi took three wickets for 147 runs, Shukla took two wickets for 82 runs and Lal took no wickets for 43 runs.\nTo win the test match, India required 175 runs. Arun Lal was out for one run and Dilip Vengsarkar was out for five runs. At this stage India was two wickets for 16 runs. Sandeep Patil and Kapil Dev put on 62 runs in 52 balls for the third-wicket. While attempting to take two runs to long off, Patil and Kapil Dev ended up on the same end, and Patil was run out for 46 in 33 balls. Kapil edged de Mel to the wicket keeper for 30 in 37 balls. At that stage, India were four wickets for 90 runs, still trailing Sri Lanka by 85 runs. Gundappa Viswanath was next out when he was dismissed for two runs. Yashpal Sharma and Madan Lal put on 31 runs before Lal was dismissed for nine runs. Five runs later, Syed Kirmani was dismissed five and India was seven wickets for 130 runs. Sunil Gavasker and Sharma had scored five runs together when the ninetieth and final over of the fifth and final day was bowled. India finished seven wickets for 135 runs. India fell 40 runs short of winning and Sri Lanka still needed to take three wickets to win and, therefore, the match was drawn. The bowler that caused the most match in India's second inning was Ashantha de Mel who took five wickets for 68 runs. The two other bowlers who bowled in the inning were Ravi Ratnayeke (no wickets for 36 runs) and Somachandra de Silva (one wicket for 29 runs).\nODI series.\nFirst ODI.\nThe first ODI of the three game ODI series was held on 12 September. Sri Lanka won the loss and elected to field. India's openers, Kris Srikkanth and Roger Binny, made a first-wicket stand of 62 runs before Binny was dismissed for 16. Srikkanth and Dilip Vengsarkar took India to one wicket for 95 runs before Vengsarkar was caught out for 23. Srikkanth was dismissed 34 runs later for 57. Sandeep Patil and Ashok Malhotra made 33 runs together until Patil was dismissed LBW for 15. Malhotra was out 11 runs later for 40. At that stage India were five wickets for 173 runs. Kapil Dev and Yashpal Sharma came together and made 68 runs. Dev was dismissed for 49 and then Mohinder Amarnath for 13. Armarnath's dismissal brought the end of the match as rain had meant that four overs were not played for each team. Sharma made 37 runs not out as India finished seven wickets for 269 runs. Five Sri Lanka's took wickets in the innings. Bandula Warnapura took two wickets for 41 runs, Somachandra de Silva took two wickets for 49 runs, Anura Ranasinghe took one wicket for 21 runs, Vinothen John took one wicket for 44 runs and Ashantha de Mel made one wicket for 58 runs.\nRequiring 269 runs off 46 overs to win, Sri Lanka made a bad start to their innings when Bandula Warnapura was bowled for a duck when Sri Lanka was only on eight runs. For the third-wicket, Sidath Wettimuny and Roy Dias made 59 runs. Dias was dismissed for 39. Wettimuny and Duleep Mendis put on 28 runs together before Wettimuny was dismissed for 43. Three runs later Ranjan Madugalle was caught out for one. Mendis was joined by Anura Ranasinghe and the pair put on 57 together before Ranasinghe was dismissed for 35. Ashantha de Mel was demised three runs later and, at that stage, Sri Lanka were 6 wickets for 158 runs. Mendis and Somachandra de Silva made seventh-wicket partnership of eight. Mendis was out for 33 and his dismissal brought Sri Lanka seven wickets for 166 runs, still trailing India by 103 runs. De Silva fell when Sri Lanka was on 175 runs. Mahes Goonatilleke and Ravi Ratnayeke batted out the innings together. At the end of 46 overs, Sri Lanka was 78 runs behind India's score and therefore lost the match. Dilip Doshi took the most wickets, taking four wickets for 44 runs. Three other bowlers took a wicket. They were Mohinder Amarnath (two wickets for 50 runs), Kapil Dev (no wicket for nine runs) and Madan Lal (one wicket for 24 runs).\nSecond ODI.\nDespite losing the first ODI, Sri Lanka, once again, chose to bat after winning the toss. The second ODI started badly when Bandula Warnapura was out for four runs. This was the Sri Lankan captain Warnapura's fourth score under ten on the tour in as many matches. Sidath Wettimuny and Roy Dias made 170 runs for the second wicket, taking Sri Lanka to two wickets for 180 runs, before Wettimuny was caught for 74. Duleep Mendis was out for ten shortly after. The next batsmen to fall was Dias who made 102 off 144 balls. Eleven runs after Dias was dismissed, Ravi Ratnayeke was out for two and then, without Sri Lanka scoring another run, Anura Ranasinghe was bowled for 20. Ranjan Madugalle and Ashantha de Mel put on 11 runs for the seventh wicket before Madugalle was out for seven. When de Mel fell for 28, Sri Lanka were eight wickets for 269 runs. Ajit de Silva and Mahes Goonatilleke batted out the innings. Sri Lanka made 277 runs for eight wickets off 50 overs. Vinothen John did not bat. The leading Indian wicket taker was Roger Binny, who took three wickets for 39 runs."

In 2018, the EWGA was acquired by the LPGA and rebranded as LPGA Women Who Play, and later rebranded as LPGA Amateur Golf Association.\nOrganizational structure and location.\nThe organization was an international membership association and was volunteer-run, from its national board to its local chapters. the EWGA had 120 chapters; 114 throughout the United States, and 1 chapter each in Canada, Bermuda, South Africa, Ireland and Italy. The national board of directors, composed of chapter leaders and representatives from the LPGA, United States Golf Association, PGA of America, and industry-specific specialists, governed the Association. The EWGA headquarters was in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, and was a Florida not-for-profit 501(c)(6) organization. Each EWGA chapter was an incorporated business entity affiliated with the Association.\nChapter activities.\nTypically chapters hosted two to three major tournaments per year, sponsor weekly \"after work\" 9-hole league play, business networking and social functions, weekend golf outings, golf rules and etiquette seminars, education programs, and charity fundraising events. Each chapter hosted a chapter championship which acted as a qualifying event in the EWGA Championship. Winners of the chapter championships proceeded to the regional golf tournament and winners from regionals went on to compete in the National Championship.\nNational championship.\nThe EGWA has held 19 national tournaments annually since 1995. The format is stroke play. EWGA Championship Finals consist of five individual flights, or divisions of golfers: Championship Flight, First Flight, Second Flight, Third Flight and Fourth Flight. Awards are given to winners for both gross score and net score.\nThe 2014 EWGA Championship finals were at Tennessee's Hermitage Golf Course where, on October 10–11, 222 women representing 80 chapters, 35 states and 2 Canadian chapters competed in two rounds of stroke play. In addition to individual play, there were also scramble teams including the Team Detroit Divot Divas.\nAnother event, the EWGA Cup Match Series, has been played since 2012. Members competed as teams in match play at the regional level and winning teams advanced to the national tournament. The Cup Match consists of two days of competition with a different format of match play each day. The two formats are: fourball match play and singles match play. The 2014 series was hosted at Troon North Golf Club."

Europe entered the competition as the cup holders, having won in 2014 in Scotland for their third consecutive win.\nThe United States won for the first time since 2008 at Valhalla, and featured the most lopsided American victory since a 9-point win in 1981 at Walton Heath. As in 2008, the U.S. never trailed during the tournament. Ryan Moore defeated Lee Westwood by 1 hole to reclaim the Cup with three matches still in progress. Captain Davis Love III dedicated the win to Arnold Palmer, who had died five days before the competition at the age of 87 while awaiting heart surgery. A bag from Palmer's captaincy in 1975 at Laurel Valley was placed on the first tee during Friday's opening foursomes to honor \"The King\", and Team USA also swept the opening foursomes on Friday morning for the first time since 1975. Two days after the matches, the majority of Team USA attended Palmer's public memorial at Saint Vincent College in his hometown of Latrobe, Pennsylvania, and brought the trophy at the request of Palmer's daughter Amy. Palmer had also had a video tribute at the opening ceremony and tributes in remarks from both captains (Love and Darren Clarke) and both honorary captains (Jack Nicklaus and Tony Jacklin).\nFormat.\nThe Ryder Cup is a match play event, with each match worth one point. The competition format is as follows:\nOn the first two days there are 4 foursome matches and 4 fourball matches with the home captain choosing which are played in the morning and which in the afternoon.\nWith a total of 28 points available, 14 points are required to win the Cup, and 14 points are required for the defending champion, Europe, to retain the Cup. All matches are played to a maximum of 18 holes according to the current format.\nCourse.\nThe announcement that the PGA of America had selected Hazeltine as the venue for the 2016 Ryder Cup was made on April 22, 2002.\nThe order of holes is different from that normally used for the course. The front nine are current holes 1–4 and 14–18 while the back nine\nare current holes 10–13 and 5–9.\nTelevision.\nThe 2016 Ryder Cup was televised in the United States by Golf Channel and NBC, which planned to provide 170 hours of coverage. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the event was broadcast by Sky Sports; the broadcaster re-branded its Sky Sports 4 channel as Sky Sports Ryder Cup for the week of the event, and planned to broadcast 240 hours of coverage.\nTask Force.\nFollowing the European victory in the 2014 Ryder Cup, the PGA of America created a \"Ryder Cup Task Force\". The Task Force consisted of three PGA officials and eight players with Ryder Cup experience. There were three previous Ryder Cup captains: Raymond Floyd, Tom Lehman and Davis Love III together with Rickie Fowler, Jim Furyk, Phil Mickelson, Steve Stricker and Tiger Woods. The Task Force considered a number of issues including the selection of the Ryder Cup captain and vice-captains and the team selection process.\nThe conclusions of the Task Force were announced on February 24, 2015, with the announcement of a number of changes for the 2016 contest. Davis Love III was selected as the captain, while new criteria were specified for the selection of vice-captains. In addition a number of changes were made to the team selection process for 2016. The 11-man Task Force was disbanded after the announcement and replaced with a smaller 6-man \"Ryder Cup Committee\" which included Love, Mickelson and Woods.\nTeam qualification and selection.\nUnited States.\nThe United States qualification rules were announced by the Task Force on February 24, 2015. The majority of the team was selected from the Ryder Cup points list which was based on prize money won in important tournaments. Generally one point was awarded for every $1,000 earned. The team consisted of:\nThere were a number of changes from 2014. The number of captain's picks was increased from three to four with the selections being made later than previously, especially moving the fourth and last pick to less than a week before the Ryder Cup, right after the completion of the Tour Championship. The qualifying events included both the 2015 World Golf Championships events and The Players Championship, on top of the four 2015 major championships as in previous years, but only included 2016 PGA Tour events actually played in 2016, thus excluded any other event played in 2015. The qualifying period was also extended because the Olympic Games had moved the timeslot for the 2016 PGA Championship which took place already at the end of July.\nThe leading 15 players (and including the last captain's pick who was in 20th place) in the final points list were:\nPlayers in qualifying places are shown in green. Captain's picks are shown in yellow.\nEurope.\nThe European team qualification rules were announced on May 26, 2015. The basic qualification rules were unchanged from those for the 2014 event. The team consisted of:\nOnly European members of the European Tour were eligible for the team and players could only earn points in the above two lists while they were a member of the European Tour. Paul Casey was not a member of the European Tour and was ineligible to earn points or be selected to the team. Russell Knox was not yet a member of the European Tour when he won the 2015 WGC-HSBC Champions. Two weeks after that win, he took up membership in order to try to qualify for the Ryder Cup, but the money and the approximately 90 OWGR points he had earned since the start of the qualification period did not count toward his Ryder Cup point totals. If these OWGR points had counted, he would have qualified easily by finishing fourth on the world ranking list; instead, he finished in tenth place, 12.36 OWGR points from automatic qualification, and was not selected as a captain's pick.\nThe leading players in the European Ryder Cup points lists were:\nSergio García and Justin Rose, who qualified through the World points list, finished in 17th and 26th place respectively on the European points list.\nTeams.\nCaptains.\nDarren Clarke was named as the European captain on February 18, 2015. He was selected by a five-man selection panel consisting of the last three Ryder Cup captains: Paul McGinley, José María Olazábal, Colin Montgomerie, another ex-Ryder Cup player David Howell and the European Tour chief executive George O'Grady.\nDavis Love III was named the United States captain on February 24, 2015. He had previously captained the 2012 team.\nVice-captains.\nEach captain selects a number of vice-captains to assist him during the tournament.\nClarke selected Thomas Bjørn, Pádraig Harrington, and Paul Lawrie as European team vice-captains in May 2016. He added Ian Poulter in June and Sam Torrance in July.\nTom Lehman was named as a United States vice-captain at the same press conference that Love was named as captain. In November 2015 three more vice-captains were named: Jim Furyk, Steve Stricker and Tiger Woods. All three had been members of the American Task Force. On September 27, 2016, Love selected Bubba Watson as the fifth vice-captain.\nPlayers.\nCaptain's picks are shown in yellow. Davis Love III announced three captain's picks at 11:00 EDT on September 12. Ryan Moore was announced as the final captain's pick during halftime of the Sunday night NFL game on September 25.

        "text": "Rugby league is played in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which now has over 1000 registered players nationwide, many of which are juniors. These numbers are rapidly increasing each year.\nHistory.\nIn 2012, following the formation of the first club in Republika Srpska, one of the two entities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a second club was formed in the city of Novi Grad, named New Thunder RLFC. Three coaches from the area took part in the Serbian Rugby League Federation Level 1 course in the middle of August, with them then overseeing the first ever domestic rugby league game in the Republic of Srpska and Bosnia and Herzegovina at Novi Grad Mlakve stadium, home of FC Sloboda Novi Grad. Dimitris Dajc refereed the game watched by around 300 curious locals, between New Thunder and the splendidly named White Rabbits, with the home team winning 28-20 in a very competitive game despite the visitors greater experience. Jovan Vujosevic, RLEF Central and East Europe director, shared his delight with the progress that was being made. \"This is huge step for rugby league in Europe\", he said. \"We put a new country on the European rugby league map. The next objective is the formation of a third club in Bosnia and Herzegovina and a Rugby League Federation of the Republic of Srpska, followed by the formation of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Rugby League Federation as a final step.\"Serbia will help a lot in the development of the game in this area and we also hope that after Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Greece, other Balkan countries will follow suit.\"\nIn 2013, Bosnia held its first ever domestic competition with three clubs from Bosnia playing in a 6-round competition. In the first game, RLC Bjeli Zecevi beat Stanari’s RLC Rudar 36-4 at the City Stadium in Doboj. New Thunder RLFC finished third in the inaugural competition.\nIn October 2014, Bosnia and Herzegovina's rugby league status was more recognised after hosting an Under-16s International 9s tournament. Jovan Vujosevic said: “This was a huge step for rugby league in Bosnia Herzegovina...It was really well organized and all the teams were very happy. Club Vitez president Zeljko Ljubanic did a fantastic job.”\nMain clubs are: Vitez Rugby League Club from Vitez, and \"Warriors\" Rugby League Club from Banja Luka.\nIn July 2015 a Great Britain Pioneers side came to tour Bosnia for 10 days. They would take on a Bosnia RL XIII team twice and would also take part in a 9s tournament. Jovan Vujosevic commented “This is a big step in the development of the game in Bosnia and Herzegovina, not least because the tour can open doors for recognition of the sport. This will be the first-ever British tour to Bosnia in either code of rugby and we are very proud of that.\" He also believed this tour could help develop other Balkan nations like Croatia, Montenegro, Macedonia, Albania and Bulgaria to join Serbia, Greece and Bosnia and Herzegovina in rugby league football.\nOn RLEF Congress on 11.08.2018. in Belgrade, Bosnia and Herzegovina is awarded right to host 2019 Balkans Cup in Vitez.\nThe National Team.\nThe National Team's first ever match came against Greece in an inaugural tournament known as the Balkans Cup held by fellow former Yugoslav neighbours Serbia. They played a total of two matches, but their matches weren't rated as official international matches as the national association were yet to apply for RLEF membership."

India won the series 5–0 their fourth 5-0 whitewash in ODI history. It is also Sri Lanka's first 0-5 whitewash loss.\nIn the fourth ODI match, Indian batsman Rohit Sharma scored 264, setting a new record for the highest score in an ODI. He hit 33 fours in this inning which is also a world record.\nODI series.\n1st ODI.\nThe 1st ODI proved to be a rather one-sided affair. After a sedate start Indian openers opened up after the end of the 1st powerplay and after taking an early 2nd powerplay India scored 105 runs between overs 21–30. Both the openers got here 50's and 100's in the same overs and building on this foundations and a quickfire 50 by Raina India set a daunting target on 364 for Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka's openers also started cautiously but unlike Indian openers they couldn't build on and with loss of wickets at constant intervals India won by 169 runs. Ishant Sharma recorded his best ODI bowling performance. Varun Aaron had to leave the field during his fourth over due to muscle injury.\n2nd ODI.\nThe 2nd ODI was another one-sided affair. Sri Lanka lost Kusal Perera in the 1st over and despite some aggressive batting from Dilshan and Sangakkara India were still able to keep the innings under control. However, some late order hitting from Thisara Perera and an unbeaten 92 from captain Angelo Mathews took Sri Lanka to 274, which was the same score they scored in the 2011 Cricket World Cup Final. India lost Ajinkya Rahane early but two 100+ partnerships for the 2nd and 3rd wickets took India to victory. Ambati Rayudu scored his maiden international century.\n3rd ODI.\nSri Lanka started the innings poorly, losing Kusal Perera to Umesh Yadav again in the 1st over. A 105 run partnership between Mahela Jayawardene and Tillakaratne Dilshan revived Sri Lanka's innings. however, three-wickets in three overs by Axar Patel during the powerplay resulted in Sri Lanka losing all the momentum. Banking on a superb century from Jayawardene and a 50 from Dilshan Sri Lanka scored 242. India started positively in their reply and a fighting 79-ball 91 from Shikhar Dhawan laid the foundation for India's victory.

This effectively ended his career in football. He then underwent multiple surgeries that were unsuccessful in curing the tumor, ultimately undergoing an 11 1/2 hour surgery in 1979 at Memorial Sloan Kettering to remove his left arm, shoulder, and five ribs. Recovery from surgery as an amputee was difficult and Reilly suffered significant depression but was able to overcome it at least in part due to the support of another NFL player who overcame similar physical trauma from injury in the Vietnam War, Rocky Bleier.\nPost cancer life.\nAfter surgery, Reilly worked hard at rehabilitation to overcome the limitations the experts said he would have. He learned to tie a necktie with one hand, to play golf with one hand, and ran five half marathons and in the Marine Corps Marathon.\nHe went on to a 30-year career with Xerox and, having retired from corporate America, is a sports radio broadcaster, appearing on Eagles' pregame and postgame shows. He is also a motivational speaker, sharing his story with corporate audiences, business leaders, cancer patients, recuperating soldiers, and special needs students. Reilly also counseled victims of the Boston Marathon Bombings.\nIn 1985, he was inducted into the Delaware Sports Hall of Fame.\nIn 2015, Reilly was announced as the color analyst for the Villanova Wildcats football radio team on WTEL (AM).\nIn 2018, Kevin Reilly, along with John Riley, wrote the book \"Tackling Life: How Faith, Family and Fortitude Kept an NFL Linebacker in the Game\"."
