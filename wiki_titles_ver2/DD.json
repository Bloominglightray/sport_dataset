        "title": "List of boxing sextuple champions",
        "text": "A sextuple champion in boxing refers to a boxer who has won world titles in six different weight classes.\nRecognition.\nMajor sanctioning bodies.\nThere is some dispute on which sanctioning body is considered \"major\" enough to award championships. The \"Big 4\" sanctioning bodies are always included. They are arranged in order of foundation:\n\"The Ring\".\nThe Ring, boxing's most respected magazine, has awarded world championships in professional boxing within each weight class from its foundation in 1922 until the 1990s, and again since 2001. \"The Ring\" champions were at one point held the linear reign to the throne, the man who beat the man. The lineal champion is also known as the true champion of the division. \"The Ring\" stopped giving belts to world champions in the 1990s but began again in 2002. \nIn 2002, \"The Ring\" attempted to clear up the confusion regarding world champions by creating a championship policy. It echoed many critics' arguments that the sanctioning bodies in charge of boxing championships had undermined the sport by pitting undeserving contenders against undeserving \"champions\", and forcing the boxing public to see mismatches for so-called \"world championships\". \"The Ring\" attempted to clear up the confusion regarding world champions by creating a championship policy that is \"intended to reward fighters who, by satisfying rigid criteria, can justify a claim as the true and only world champion in a given weight class.\" \"The Ring\" claims to be more authoritative and open than the sanctioning bodies' rankings, with a page devoted to full explanations for ranking changes. A fighter pays no sanctioning fees to defend or fight for the title at stake, contrary to practices of the sanctioning bodies. Furthermore, a fighter cannot be stripped of the title unless he loses, decides to move to a different weight division, or retires.\nThere are currently only two ways that a boxer can win \"The Ring\"'s title: defeat the reigning champion; or win a box-off between the magazine's number-one and number-two rated contenders (or, sometimes, number-one and number-three rated). A vacant \"Ring\" championship is filled when the number-one contender in a weight-division battles the number-two contender or the number-three contender (in cases where \"The Ring\" determines that the number-two and number-three contenders are close in abilities and records).\nIn May 2012, citing the number of vacancies in various weight classes as primary motivation, \"The Ring\" unveiled a new championship policy. Under the new policy, \"The Ring\" title can be awarded when the No. 1 and No. 2 fighters face one another or when the Nos. 1 and 2 contenders choose not to fight one another and either of them fights No. 3, No. 4 or No. 5, the winner may be awarded \"The Ring\" belt. In addition, there are now six ways for a fighter to lose his title: lose a fight in his championship weight class; move to another weight class; not schedule a fight in any weight class for 18 months; not schedule a fight in his championship weight class for 18 months, even if fighting at another weight class; not scheduling a fight with a top 5 contender in any weight class for two years; or retiring.\nMany media outlets and members are extremely critical of the new championship policy and state that if this new policy is followed \"The Ring\" title will lose the credibility it once held.\nLineal.\nThe Transnational Boxing Rankings Board (TBRB) hands out the official version of the lineal championship. TBRB awards vacant championships when the two top-ranked fighters in any division meet and currently recognizes legitimate world champions or \"true champions\" each weight classes. The Board was formed to continue where \"The Ring\" \"left off\" in the aftermath of its purchase by Golden Boy Promotions in 2007 and the following dismissal of Nigel Collins. After the new editors announced a controversial new championship policy in May 2012, three prominent members of the Ring Advisory Panel resigned. This three members (Springs Toledo, Cliff Rold and Tim Starks) became the founding members of the \"Transnational Boxing Rankings Board\", which was formed over the summer of 2012 with the assistance of Stewart Howe of England.\nSince 2012, lineal champions are predetermined by the \"Transnational Boxing Rankings Board\", which promotes the concept of a singular world champion per weight class. Lineal champions are listed on \"Cyber Boxing Zone\" website which list lineal champions of the \"Queensberry Era\" to date.\nList of men's of sextuple champions.\nThe following are the lists of boxers who have won six different titles in six unprecedentedly different categories of weight. In boxing, sextuple champions are just few boxers who has won world titles or belts in the incredible record of six different weight classes or divisions.\nList of women's sextuple champion.\nThe following is a list of women’s sextuple champions who have held titles from one or more of the \"Big Four\" organizations (WBA, WBC, IBF, WBO) and The Ring.\nSextuple champions that won titles in other multiple divisions.\nSome fighters of this group or club were not satisfied to win just the incredible milestone of championships in six different weight divisions but to reach immortality in seven other different divisions or categories.

There were a total number of 44 participating athletes, with six qualifying heats and the final held on Sunday 1983-08-14.\nOut of the blocks, world record holder Marita Koch in lane 6 slowly made up the stagger on Merlene Ottey in lane 7. By the time they hit the straightaway, Koch had two metres on Ottey who was about even with Florence Griffith in lane 1. Down the straightaway, Ottey steadily ate into Koch's lead while the long striding Kathy Cook came from behind to cruise past Griffith. Sensing the challenge from Ottey, Koch started to lean and struggle the last few steps, but realizing she had won she threw her arms up in victory.\nTwo years later, Koch would set the world record in the 400 metres to go along with her 200 world record. She would retire in 1987 with both records; the 400 record has never been beaten. Five years later, Griffith as Florence Griffith-Joyner would slice more than a second off her time to set the world record that lasts today. 6th place Grace Jackson would slice .9 off her time to finish second to Griffith-Joyner as the #9 performer of all time with Ottey a distant fourth in that race, still .2 faster than this race. Ottey became the (at the time) #2 performer of all time in 1990.

        "text": "The 2008 FIRA Women's European Championship was the 11th rugby union women's European championship organised by FIRA - AER.\nIt took place in the Netherlands from 17 to 24 May 2008; for the first time since 2004 both the A and B championships were held simultaneously in the same host country.\nEight national teams took part to the Pool A: the four Home Nations plus France, Spain and the Netherlands; as for Italy they withdrew and were replaced by Sweden. Amongst the contestants in the Pool B were also the \"France Défense XV\", the French Army women's rugby union squad.\nResults.\nEngland won the Pool A title against Wales in the final. There were no tries in the match, which effectively amounted to a kicking duel, with each team dominating one half. Non Evans scored two penalties for the Welsh in the first half and Katy McLean scored four for England in the second half. The English took the title with a final score of 12 to 6. Both teams produced good play during the tournament; however, in this particular match the defence stole the lead over the attack and the precision and discipline of the English won the day. The new Champions of Europe succeeded France, who only managed to attain fourth place - despite the final score, 22-22, in the play-off against Ireland the last place on the podium went to their opponents as they scored more tries. A surprise placing for the Scottish who came in fifth, winning 27 -25 against Spain in an incredible match (8 tries), probably one of the best of the Championship with Spain just losing out in injury time. In the match for seventh place, the Netherlands beat Sweden 7 to 6.\nIt was an easy win for Russia in the Group B final against the French Military team. Faster and more organized, the Russian players took control of the match very early on when their full-back and team captain, Anastasiya Mukharyamova launched a counterattack from the 22 metre line and a few passes later, Anna Gottseva finished between the posts. Throughout the tournament Russia produced some splendid clean, creative and collective play. The speed and agility of their backs meant that they emerged as the team with the best attacking play. Their players took major risks and didn't hesitate in launching counterattacks from anywhere on the pitch. It was no surprise when they won this afternoon in Amsterdam. Congratulations also to the Russian full-back Natalia Selyvtina, a very impressive “sidestepper”, who succeeded in scoring eleven tries during her team's five games. An incredible turnabout took place in the match for third place. Ten minutes from the end of the match, the Belgians were leading 15 to 7 and were expecting victory. However, they hadn't counted on the courage of the Germans who scored two late tries, taking the lead in the last minute and eventually winning the match 19 to 15. In the match for fifth place, Romanian won 12 – 5 against Finland.\nFIRA-AER officials also selected the best players of the Championship. The jury, made up of Technical Directors and Match Commissioners selected:\nThe Fair-play prize was awarded to Russia"

        "text": "The Portuguese national ice hockey team () is the national men's ice hockey team of Portugal. The team was previously controlled by the Federation of Portuguese Ice Sports (FPDG.) In September 2017, control was given to the Federação de Desportos de Inverno de Portugal, which also retains the associate membership within the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF), which had been acquired by the FPDG on May 13, 1999. Portugal is currently not ranked in the IIHF World Rankings and is still not actively competing in any World Championship events.\nHistory.\n2000.\nIce hockey was played in Portugal from 1996 until 2006 in the \"Palácio do Gelo\" shopping center, in Viseu. Since 2010, ice hockey practices and friendly games have been played in Elvas, Portugal.\nIn 2000, the national team of Portugal played three games, the only games they ever played. The team they compiled to play was made up of former Portuguese immigrants who played ice hockey in the United States and Canada, as well as former players from traditional roller hockey. The event consisted of three games between the newly created national team of Portugal and the First Portuguese Canadian Cultural Center (FPCCC) from Toronto, Ontario, representing Canada. The games were held from June 21 to June 23, 2000, at the Palácio do Gelo in Viseu.\nThe tournament was a game venture by the Federação Portuguesa de Desportos No Gelo and the Embassy of Canada, namely the Ambassador of Canada, Robert Vanderloo. The event was also sponsored by Banco Comercial Português and Nortel.\nThe FPCCC won the first game 18–6 and the second 21–5. Pedro Regado was the first ever player to score for Portugal when he scored on 8:04 mark of the first period. The third and final game was played with the decision to mix-up the teams, placing Portuguese descendants of the FPCCC on the Portuguese team. At the end of the third match, the score was a close 15–11 for FPCCC. Portugal has not played an organized match until 2015.\n2015 onwards.\nIn January 2015, Portugal returned to play two international exhibition games, against the Čeští lvi in Elvas, Portugal. Portugal won their first game ever with a 6–4 win and a 6–2 win on the day after. This exhibition games were sponsored by the Czech Republic embassy in Portugal, namely by the strong support of Czech ambassador Stanislav Kázecký.\nOn January 14, 2016. Portugal played two exhibition games in Prague, Czech Republic. Portugal lost 0–2 against the Čeští Lvi and 0–3 against the Sklepovští Sršáni. Two days afterwards Portugal won their first ever away game with a 4–3 victory against the Čeští Lvi.\nOn 14 and 15 January 2017, Portugal hosted a quadrangular tournament in Elvas, Portugal. This was the largest ice hockey competition ever held in the country. Other than team Portugal, there were invited two teams from Czech Republic, the Čeští Lvi, the Sklepovští Sršáni and the second division French team Evry-Viry Jets. Even if Portugal was not able to conquer the tournament, this event was another step forward for the Portuguese ice hockey community and showed their capacity of organizing an international event.\nPortugal played on 22 and 23 April 2017 at an international tournament with teams from Norway, Finland and Spain at Granada, Spain. The national team now led by their Canadian Coach Jim Aldred was able to retain a 6–0 victory against the Granada Eagles. It was the first away tournament played by Portugal and it showed a clear improvement in their level of play.\nHistory was made once again on September 29, 2017, when Portugal won their first official game against another ice hockey national team. In Canillo, Andorra, Portugal won, 2–3 in a shootout, against the hosting state. After this historical moment, Portugal also played Ireland and Morocco, recording losses, nevertheless, in the silver medal game, Portugal won again against Andorra, by the score of 5–3. At this date, the Portuguese national team clearly showed that they would be able to compete against other national teams and also deliver a consistent game.\nOn March 17 and 18, 2018, Portugal played at the Gladiators international tournament were they won a silver medal, with a 4 win and 3 draw record. The team performed with 27 goals for and only 7 against. This tournament brought also several new Portuguese players playing in France, Switzerland and Canada, which assisted the team to greatly perform against other competitive teams.\nOn April 28 and 29, 2018, Portugal played returned to Granada to play the Mr. Taxi Cup. The team performed, once again, at a very competitive level, with very close scores with more experience teams.\nPortugal then participated in the IIHF 2018 Development Cup, which was held in Füssen, Germany, along with Andorra, Ireland] and Macedonia.

        "title": "Oklahoma State Cowboys basketball",
        "text": "The Oklahoma State Cowboys basketball team represents Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, Oklahoma, United States in NCAA Division I men's basketball competition. All women's teams at the school are known as Cowgirls. The Cowboys currently compete in the Big 12 Conference. In 2020, CBS Sports ranked Oklahoma State the 25th best college basketball program of all-time, ahead of such programs as Oklahoma and Texas. Oklahoma State men’s basketball has a very rich history of success, having won more national titles and advanced to the NCAA Championship, Final Four, Elite Eight and Sweet Sixteen more times than any Big 12 program other than Kansas. Oklahoma State has won a combined 23 regular season conference titles and conference tournament titles, which is the most of any program in the state of Oklahoma.\nSince 1938, the team has played its home games in Gallagher-Iba Arena. Prior to 1957, the school was known as Oklahoma A&amp;M College, and the teams were nicknamed the Aggies.\nOn March 21, 2016, Brad Underwood was hired as head coach at Oklahoma State, replacing the fired Travis Ford. Just short of one year, on March 18, 2017, Underwood left the program for Illinois. Assistant Mike Boynton was promoted to head coach on March 24. Steve Lutz was hired as the head coach April 1, 2024.\nHistory.\nOklahoma State University (then Oklahoma A&amp;M College) began varsity intercollegiate competition in men's basketball in 1908. The Cowboys (including the predecessor Aggies teams) rank 35th in total victories among all NCAA Division I college basketball programs, with an all-time win–loss record of 1517–1053 (.590) at the end of 2010–11 season.\nThe Cowboys (including the predecessor Aggies teams) have made 28 total appearances in the NCAA tournament (37–21 overall record), reaching the NCAA Final Four six times (1945, 1946, 1949, 1951, 1995, 2004) and the NCAA regional finals (Elite Eight) eleven times. Oklahoma State (then Oklahoma A&amp;M College) won the NCAA Championship in 1945 and 1946. The Cowboys rank tenth (tied with three other programs) in all-time Final Four appearances and seventh (tied with seven others) in total NCAA Championships.\nThe early years (1907–34).\nUnder nine head coaches in this period Oklahoma A&amp;M found very little success, with only six winning seasons. Very little success was found early on and after a six-win 15-loss season under first-year coach John Maulbetsch things were not looking well. However, in the next three seasons Maulbetsch turned around the program, leading the Aggies to a 41–20 record culminating with a first-place finish in their last season in the Southwest Conference. The move to the Missouri Valley Conference in 1925 would halt the progress under this budding coach. After Maulbetsch resigned from the positions of football, baseball and basketball coach the Aggies would not have another winning season until Henry Iba took the reins in 1934. However, despite an overall record of 7–9, the Aggies did win the Missouri Valley Conference Co-Championship in 1930-31 under Coach George E. Rody with a conference record of 5–3.\nThis period in Oklahoma State basketball history was marked with mainly football coaches heading the football, baseball and basketball teams.\nHenry Iba era (1934–70).\nHenry Iba came to Oklahoma A&amp;M College in 1934 and remained for 36 years. He retired after the 1969–70 season. For most of his tenure at A&amp;M/OSU, he doubled as athletic director.\nIba's teams were methodical, ball-controlling units that featured weaving patterns and low scoring games. Iba's \"swinging gate\" defense (a man-to-man with team flow) was applauded by many, and is still effective in today's game. He was known as \"the Iron Duke of Defense\".\nIba's Aggies became the first to win consecutive NCAA titles (1945 and 1946). His 1945–46 NCAA champions were led by Bob Kurland, the game's first seven-foot player. They beat NYU in the 1945 finals and North Carolina in the 1946 finals. He was voted coach of the year in both seasons. His 1945 champions also defeated National Invitation Tournament champion, DePaul, and 6' 9\" center George Mikan in a classic Red Cross Benefit game. Iba's 1949 and 1951 teams also reached the Final Four of the NCAA Tournament.\nOklahoma A&amp;M/Oklahoma State teams won 655 games, 14 Missouri Valley Championships, and one Big Eight Championship, in 36 seasons with Iba as head men's basketball coach.\n\"Mr. Iba,\" as he is still popularly known at OSU, remained a fixture on campus until his death in 1993, often giving advice to players during practice. One seat in the southeast concourse level of Gallagher-Iba Arena (which was renamed in his honor in 1987) remains unused in his honor.\n1970–90.\nThe mostly subpar results of Iba's final decade in Stillwater largely remained the status quo for Oklahoma State during the two decades following his retirement. From the 1970–71 to 1989–90 seasons, the Cowboys finished with winning records only six times, finished in the top half of the Big Eight Conference standings only three times, and earned a berth in the NCAA tournament only once.\nEddie Sutton era (1990–2006).\nAfter being an assistant for the Cowboys in 1958–59, Eddie Sutton returned to Oklahoma State in 1990 to coach. In the years leading up to his hiring, the team had made postseason play only three times since joining the Big Eight Conference in 1957.\nThe Pokes began to turn around almost immediately with Sutton's presence, and in 1991, Oklahoma State returned to the NCAA Tournament, winning their first NCAA Tournament game since making the Elite Eight in 1965. Sutton’s Cowboys advanced all the way to the Sweet Sixteen during his first two seasons. In 1995, the Pokes, under the leadership of Bryant \"Big Country\" Reeves and Randy Rutherford, captured the Big Eight Conference Tournament and won a bid to the 1995 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. They advanced to the Final Four in Seattle, Washington, where they lost to eventual champion UCLA. It was the Cowboys' deepest advance in the tournament since 1951.\nLed by John Lucas III, Joey Graham, and 2004 Big 12 Player of the Year Tony Allen, Sutton's 2003–04 team finished with a school-record 31 wins (31–4), won both the Big 12 regular season and tournament championships, and advanced to the Final Four as a No. 2 seed in the 2004 NCAA tournament. The Cowboys finished the season ranked No. 4 in the final AP poll and Coaches' Poll.\nIn his 16 seasons in Stillwater, the Cowboys reached the postseason 15 times (having declined an NIT bid in Sutton's sixth season as head coach), including 13 NCAA Tournament bids and two Final Four appearances. They also captured three regular-season conference titles and three conference tournament championships. Sutton finished his career at OSU as the second-winningest coach in school history, behind only his mentor, Iba.\n2001 plane crash.\nOn January 27, 2001, one of three planes carrying Oklahoma State staff and players crashed in a snow storm near Byers, Colorado, killing all 10 on board. The plane was on its way back from a loss against the University of Colorado. Those killed included Nate Fleming, a redshirt freshman guard; Dan Lawson, a junior guard; Bill Teegins, radio sportscaster of OSU basketball and sports anchor on CBS affiliate KWTV-9 in Oklahoma City; Kendall Durfey, television and radio engineer; Will Hancock, media relations coordinator; Pat Noyes, director of basketball operations; Brian Luinstra, athletic trainer; Jared Weiberg, student assistant; Denver Mills, pilot; and Bjorn Falistrom, co-pilot.\nSince 2007, Oklahoma State has honored these ten during an annual 5k and 10K race called the Remember the Ten Run.\nSean Sutton era (2006–08).\nEddie Sutton's son, Sean Sutton, also a former Cowboy player, took over head coaching duties in 2006. Following a record of 39–29 during his first two seasons, Sutton resigned under pressure after a March 31, 2008, meeting with Athletic Director Mike Holder.\nTravis Ford era (2008–16).\nOn April 16, 2008, Travis Ford was hired as the 18th men's basketball head coach at Oklahoma State. He resigned from the same position with the UMass Minutemen to take the position. At the time of his hiring, he had a Division I coaching record of 123–115. Ford also coached at Eastern Kentucky and Campbellsville University (NAIA). As a player, he was coached by Norm Stewart at the University of Missouri as a freshman. He transferred after his freshman season and played for three years (1992–94) at the University of Kentucky under Rick Pitino.\nFord was fired on March 18, 2016 after a season in which the Cowboys went 3–15 in Big 12 play and 12–20 overall. Although he led the Cowboys to five NCAA tournaments in his eight seasons in charge, he never finished higher than third in conference play, and finished sixth or worse in the Big 12 seven times.\nBrad Underwood era (2016–2017).\nThree days after Ford's firing, Oklahoma State hired Brad Underwood from Stephen F. Austin State University (SFA). He began his coaching career at Kansas State, first serving as director of basketball operations for a season and then serving as an assistant for five more. Underwood then went to South Carolina as an assistant for a season before being hired to his first head coaching post at SFA. During his three seasons in charge, the Lumberjacks went 89–14 overall and 53–1 in Southland Conference regular-season play, making the NCAA tournament all three seasons and advancing to the second round twice. Underwood's 89 wins tie him with Brad Stevens for the most wins by a men's basketball head coach in his first three seasons at an NCAA school. He is also the first coach to be named Southland Conference Coach of the Year three consecutive times. On March 18, 2017 Brad Underwood was hired at Illinois. During the 2016-17 season, Associate head coach Lamont Evans was engaged in bribery scheme that came to light in 2017. Evans was sentenced to three months in prison in June 2019 for his participation in the scheme, which he also conducted at the University of South Carolina. In June 2020 press release, the NCAA announced a postseason ban for 2020–21.\nMike Boynton era (2017–2024).\nThe school promoted assistant coach Mike Boynton Jr. to head coach on March 24, 2017. He was fired on March 14, 2024, after a 13th place conference finish and first round exit from the Big 12 Tournament. Boynton finished with a 119-109 (.522) record, including 51-75 (.405) in conference play.\nSteve Lutz era (2024 - present).\nSteve Lutz was announced as the head coach on April 1, 2024.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Cowboys have appeared in the NCAA tournament 29 times. Their combined record is 39–28. They won the tournament in 1945 and 1946.\nNIT results.\nThe Cowboys have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) 13 times. Their combined record is 11–14.\nFacilities.\nGallagher-Iba Arena.\nGallagher-Iba Arena, once dubbed “Madison Square Garden of the Plains”, is the basketball and wrestling venue at Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, Oklahoma. Originally completed in 1938 and named the 4-H Club and Student Activities Building, it was soon renamed Gallagher Hall to honor wrestling coach, Ed Gallagher. After renovations in 1987, the name became Gallagher-Iba Arena, as a tribute to longtime basketball coach and innovator, Henry Iba. Gallagher-Iba Arena was named the best college gymnasium by CBS SportsLine.com in August 2001.\nThe first basketball game was played on December 9, 1938, when Iba's Oklahoma A&amp;M Aggies beat Phog Allen’s Kansas Jayhawks, 21–15, in a battle between two of the nation's early basketball powers. In its original configuration, seating was limited to 6,381. Though small by today's standards, it was the largest collegiate facility in the country when completed. The original maple floor, still in use today, was the most expensive of its kind in America when it was installed in 1938.\nOklahoma State completed a $55 million expansion of Gallagher-Iba Arena prior to the 1999–2000 Cowboy basketball season. Rather than build a new, off-campus arena to accommodate the need for additional seating, the decision was made to expand Gallagher-Iba Arena itself to more than double its original capacity (from its 6,381-seat capacity to its current 13,611 seats). The old sightlines and the original white maple floor were kept (it remains the oldest original basketball court floor still in use).\nOn January 15, 2005, the court was officially named after Eddie Sutton as Eddie Sutton Court.\nNotable players.\nCowboys in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\nFive members of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame have been associated with the Oklahoma State's men's basketball team. Some former players have been enshrined as players, while some former players have been enshrined as coaches.\nCowboys in the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame.\nFour former Oklahoma State players/coaches that have been enshrined in the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame."

The Orangemen, led by Brad Kotz and Tim Nelson, scored eight straight goals in less than nine minutes in the second half to clinch the title after Hopkins had gone up 12–5 midway through the third quarter.\nSyracuse was seeded second and hosted the first round and semifinal games. The Orangemen beat Penn, the seventh-seed, 11–8 at Syracuse's J.S. Coyne Stadium. In the semifinals in the Carrier Dome, the Orangemen beat Maryland 12–5 behind Randy Lundblad’s one goal and four assists and Travis Solomon’s 22 saves.\nIn the finals, the Blue Jays had a 12–5 lead with less than seven minutes to play in the third period when the Orangemen rallied. Syracuse outscored the Blue Jays 4–1 to close out the third period and then added six straight goals in the fourth to go up 15–13. Hopkins tied the score at 15, but goals by Brad Kotz and Lundblad gave the Orangemen a two-goal cushion with Del Dressell scoring the final Hopkins goal. Tim Nelson had two goals and six assists in the finals, to finish as the tournament’s leading scorer with 15 points. Kotz scored five goals, all in the second half and was named Most Outstanding Player. Travis Solomon made 18 saves for the Orange.\nLate in the third quarter, team captain and defenseman Darren Lawlor scored a key goal left-handed which provided a spark for the Orangemen. Overcoming a seven goal deficit against a Hopkins team participating in its seventh straight title game, Lawlor and the other Orangemen seniors provided the spark. But the offensive punch came primarily from sophomores, including midfielder Brad Kotz of West Genesee and Tim Nelson, the transfer from North Carolina State. Nelson's pass to Randy Lundblad for an open-net goal with 1:09 left locked up the title for the Orangemen.\nFor Hopkins, Dressel was outstanding exhibiting one on one skills on par with the Orangemen's most athletic players, finishing with three goals and one assist in the finals.\nSyracuse and Johns Hopkins would go on to meet in the NCAA finals five more times, the last time in 2008. This was Hopkins' seventh straight NCAA final."

        "title": "Horse racing in Scotland",
        "text": "Horseracing in Scotland is a popular spectator sport, with a history dating back over 900 years. There are currently five operating racecourses in Scotland - one exclusively for flat racing, two exclusively for jump racing and two mixed. Between them they held one hundred and three race meetings in 2014. The main National Hunt meeting held is the Scottish Grand National meeting at Ayr each April, and the main Flat meeting is the Ayr Gold Cup Festival (historically known as the Western Meeting), at the same course each September.\nHorseracing first flourished in the country during the reign of King James VI and I when members of the Royal Court developed a passion for the sport, before they began to establish a centre for horse racing in Newmarket. From that time onwards, in contrast to England, wealthy owners have been rare in Scotland, and the main development of the sport took place south of the border. The contributions of Scots owners such as the fourth Duke of Queensberry were made in England.\nIn the modern era, horse racing in Scotland comes under a British, as opposed to a specifically Scottish aegis. Scottish race meetings tend to have a strong local feeling, local runners and local patronage.\nHistory.\nRacing horses for sport in Scotland dates back at least 900 years. The Lanark Silver Bell, reputedly first contested in the reign of William the Lion of Scotland in the 12th or early 13th century is among the first horse races recorded anywhere. In fact, until 1977, when Lanark Racecourse closed, it was the oldest continually run horse racing event in the world. After a break of 30 years it was revived at Hamilton in 2008.\nAmong other early records of racing are those in the Lord Treasurer's Accounts, the records of King James IV's personal expenditure. There are only four references to horse racing, all in 1503-4, including a payment made in 1504 to a jockey, ‘the boy that ran the King’s horse’ at Leith. Relative to James' other sporting interests such as falconry and golf this is very few.\nA well-known annual race, with a bell for a prize, was instituted at Haddington in 1552, but reference to this in royal records is restricted to a single entry. It is not until the reign of James VI that racing truly emerges. Races were held at Peebles and Dumfries (from 1575) but it was not until he saw the possibilities of racing on Newmarket Heath in 1605 he became an enthusiast for horse racing. Although the sport went into abeyance during the Civil War and the Interregnum, the sport bounced back after the Restoration. From then on, racing took place all over Scotland, more intensively in the Lowlands than in the Highlands and has continued down to the present day.\nIn 1800, annual race meetings were held at five places in Scotland, and by 1816, the year the main races in Edinburgh moved from Leith to Musselburgh, nine places. In 1839, there were still nine.\nRacecourses.\nThe five racecourses in Scotland are:\nIn living memory, there were also Lanark Racecourse (closed 1977; flat only) and Bogside Racecourse (closed 1965; mixed, and the traditional home of the Scottish Grand National)."

The remainder of the skull is the neurocranium.\nIn human anatomy and development, the facial skeleton is sometimes called the \"membranous viscerocranium\", which comprises the mandible and dermatocranial elements that are not part of the braincase.\nStructure.\nIn the human skull, the facial skeleton consists of fourteen bones in the face:\nVariations.\nElements of the \"cartilaginous viscerocranium\" (i.e., splanchnocranial elements), such as the hyoid bone, are sometimes considered part of the facial skeleton. The ethmoid bone (or a part of it) and also the sphenoid bone are sometimes included, but otherwise considered part of the neurocranium. Because the maxillary bones are fused, they are often collectively listed as only one bone. The mandible is generally considered separately from the cranium.\nDevelopment.\nThe facial skeleton is composed of dermal bone and derived from the neural crest cells (also responsible for the development of the neurocranium, teeth and adrenal medulla) or from the sclerotome, which derives from the somite block of the mesoderm. As with the neurocranium, in Chondricthyes and other cartilaginous vertebrates, they are not replaced via endochondral ossification.\nVariation in craniofacial form between humans is largely due to differing patterns of biological inheritance. Cross-analysis of osteological variables and genome-wide SNPs has identified specific genes that control this craniofacial development. Of these genes, DCHS2, RUNX2, GLI3, PAX1 and PAX3 were found to determine nasal morphology, whereas EDAR impacts chin protrusion."

He was selected in the first round of the 1993 NFL draft by the San Francisco 49ers. He also played for the Cincinnati Bengals and the Atlanta Falcons. He played college football at the University of Tennessee, where he was a captain of the 1992 team, and received All-SEC and All-American AP honors.\nHigh school career.\nKelly attended Bethel High School in Hampton, Virginia, where he played football and baseball, and ran track. He played defensive end and tight end for the football team, registering six sacks and five interceptions on defense, and catching 18 passes and scoring five touchdowns on offense during his senior year to win All-State honors. He was timed at 4.5 seconds in the 40-yard dash, which was unusually fast for a defensive lineman.\nAs a member of the track team, Kelly won the state's high hurdles title as a sophomore, with a best of 14.1 seconds. He received All-State honors in baseball, and was drafted by the Detroit Tigers in the 1989 June Amateur Draft.\nCollege career.\nKelly initially committed to South Carolina in 1989, but switched his commitment to Tennessee following the death of South Carolina coach Joe Morrison. Due to a lack of depth on the defensive line, he played in eight games during his freshman year as a backup to veteran Marion Hobby, picking up 6 tackles and a sack. While working with defensive coaches Larry Lacewell and Rex Norris, Kelly remained on the second unit during the 1990 season, picking up 21 tackles (14 solo) and a team-leading 5 sacks. He had two sacks in Tennessee's 45–3 win over Florida, and forced a fumble that led to a score in the Vols' 26–26 tie against Auburn.\nDuring his junior year in 1991, Kelly registered 23 tackles (14 solo) and 5.5 sacks (3rd-highest on the team), playing mostly as a backup to senior Chuck Smith. He had three tackles and a sack in the Vols' 30–21 win over Auburn, and registered four tackles and a sack in the team's loss to Florida. He had a sack and forced a fumble in Tennessee's 25–24 loss to Alabama. He tallied four tackles and a sack in Tennessee's loss to Penn State in the 1992 Fiesta Bowl.\nKelly's first career start came in Tennessee's 1992 season-opening win over Southwest Louisiana, in which he registered three tackles and a sack. He registered 2.5 sacks in Tennessee's 34–31 win over Georgia, and led a rushing defense that held Florida to just 68 yards on the ground in the Vols' 31–14 win over the Gators. He recovered a fumble in the fourth quarter of Tennessee's 17–10 loss to Alabama, and registered a sack in Tennessee's 38–23 win over Boston College in the 1993 Hall of Fame Bowl. He finished the season with 38 tackles (28 solo), a team-leading 11 sacks, and a team-leading 10 tackles-for-loss. He was named All-SEC and first-team All-American at the end of the season.\nDuring his four years at Tennessee, Kelly registered 88 tackles (58 solo), 22.5 sacks, 14 tackles-for-loss, and two forced fumbles. He is fifth on the school's career sacks list, trailing only Derek Barnett (33), Reggie White (32), Leonard Little (28) and Jonathan Brown (25). His 11 sacks in 1992 is tied with Little's 1995 tally for the school's fourth-highest single-season total (only White, Brown, and John Henderson have had more sacks in a season). In October 2014, Kelly was named Tennessee's selection for that year's SEC Football Legends Class.\nProfessional career.\nKelly was selected by the San Francisco 49ers in the first round (27th pick overall) of the 1993 NFL draft. During his rookie year, he played in 14 games and started in five, registering one sack. During the 1994 season, Kelly played in 11 games, and registered 9 tackles and 3.5 sacks. He appeared with the 49ers in the team's 49–26 victory over San Diego in Super Bowl XXIX.\nKelly was cut by the 49ers prior to the 1995 season. He was claimed on waivers a few days later by the Cincinnati Bengals. He appeared in all 16 games for the Bengals in 1995, playing primarily as a speed rusher on passing downs. He was cut by the Bengals prior to the 1996 season, but was re-signed for two games in October. He finished the season with the Atlanta Falcons.\nDuring his four seasons in the NFL, Kelly registered 27 tackles, 5.5 sacks, two forced fumbles, a fumble recovery, and a pass break up.\nPersonal life and post-playing career.\nKelly returned to Knoxville, Tennessee, with his family, following his NFL career. He works as a Commercial Excellence Executive for Boston Scientific (Peripheral Intervention), and served as a youth football coach from 2003 to 2009.\nKelly met his wife, Renee, a former Vol Hostess, at Tennessee in 1989. Their son, Todd Kelly, Jr., was a consensus four-star defensive back at the Webb School of Knoxville, and played for Tennessee from 2014 to 2018 and graduated.

Since its official establishment in Virginia Beach in 1963, the ECSC has grown to be the now-longest running surfing contest in the world with the 58th annual surf competition held August 23–30, 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic with safety guidelines in place.\nThe ECSC is a place not only for professional surfers, but for amateur surfers as well, to ride and contend for cash prizes totaling close to $40,000 and championship titles. Men's and women's surfing events are held throughout the week, plus other beach sporting events such as volleyball, skateboarding, skimboarding, a 5k Oceanfront run, and a swimsuit competition. A new event called the Beach Bum Classic was introduced in 2007. The Beach Bum Classic, organized and sponsored by \nWareing's Gym in Virginia Beach, is a triathlon-type event including a one-mile sand run, a three-mile bike race on beach cruisers, and a half-mile surfboard paddling race.\nA reported spectator count of over 100,000 people show up to watch the events during the day, and at night, the Virginia Beach boardwalk fills with people for free concerts on the beach. Bands and musicians include national, regional, and local talents. This year will feature a special event featuring Matthew Higgins, Long Island Surf Pro Champion who is known for his Surf Board maneuvering prowess.\nThe ECSC is planned, organized, and employed by the Virginia Beach Jaycees, a chapter of a nationwide volunteer organization, the United States Jaycees. Media press and coverage includes ESPN, \"The Washington Post\", and \"USA Today\"."

        "text": "The 2008 SEC men's basketball tournament took place on March 13–16, 2008 in Atlanta, Georgia. The University of Georgia, the improbable winner of the tournament, earned the Southeastern Conference's automatic bid to the 2008 NCAA tournament.\nSynopsis.\nThe tournament was originally scheduled to be played at the Georgia Dome, but a tornado struck downtown Atlanta on the night of March 14, while the third of four quarterfinal games was in overtime. While that game was completed, SEC officials decided not to risk playing the fourth game, between the University of Kentucky and University of Georgia. That quarterfinal was subsequently postponed until Saturday morning. That game and all subsequent games were played at Alexander Memorial Coliseum on the campus of Georgia Tech, a school in the Atlantic Coast Conference (and coincidentally a former SEC member). Due to the smaller capacity, only the players' families, credentialed media, school officials and 400 fans from each school were allowed to attend the rest of the tournament.\nGeorgia, which had a sub-.500 record (13–16, 4–12 in the SEC) going into the tournament and had to win the title to secure an NCAA Tournament bid, was forced to play and win three games in the space of 30 hours, including two games on Saturday — the original quarterfinal game against Kentucky that was postponed by the tornado and venue change, and the subsequent semifinal game. Coincidentally, Georgia won the SEC tournament championship on the home court of its bitter rival, Georgia Tech. This was Georgia's first SEC men's basketball tournament championship since 1983.\nTelevision coverage.\nThe first, quarterfinal, and semifinal rounds were televised by Raycom Sports, the successor to Lincoln Financial Sports (formerly Jefferson Pilot Sports), which folded into Raycom at the beginning of the year. The regular season preceding the tournament marks the 22nd season of the regionally syndicated package. \nThe SEC Championship Game was produced by CBS, but it was televised by ESPN2.\nBracket.\n† Game originally scheduled for 9:45 p.m. the day before. Postponed due to tornado.\n‡ - Game was originally to have been telecast on CBS.\nAll-Tournament Team.\nSundiata Gaines, Georgia (Most Valuable Player)\nTerrance Woodbury, Georgia\nCharles Thomas, Arkansas\nDarian Townes, Arkansas\nMykal Riley, Alabama\nGame delays and relocation.\nDuring overtime of the Friday night quarterfinal between Mississippi State and Alabama, a tornado hit the Georgia Dome at 9:40 p.m. The National Weather Service had issued a tornado warning at 9:26 p.m., because radar indicated a thunderstorm capable of producing a tornado. The storm tore open a panel on the north side of the dome; sheared bolts and insulation fell into the arena. After the storm passed, the teams returned to the court at 10:30 and completed the game.\nThe Kentucky–Georgia basketball game, originally scheduled for Friday night, was postponed. It was rescheduled for Saturday at noon. Due to the severe damage suffered at the Georgia Dome, the remainder of the tournament was moved to Georgia Tech's Alexander Memorial Coliseum. The semifinals began at 6:00pm Saturday in Alexander Memorial Coliseum. Because the games were moved to a significantly smaller arena, only players' families &amp; friends, bands, cheerleaders, and persons with working credentials were admitted. The SEC looked at several possible scenarios; one specifically mentioned by media involved playing only the Kentucky-Georgia game on Saturday, playing both semifinals on Sunday, and declaring the semifinal winners co-champions. However, tournament officials were told by the NCAA tournament selection committee (which included SEC commissioner Michael Slive) that it had to finish the tournament in order to preserve the league's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament.\nThe championship game was originally slated to be televised by CBS but was bumped to ESPN2 after the SEC opted to move the tip time to 3:30 p.m. (EDT). The move to ESPN2 was because CBS televised the Big Ten tournament final at 3:30 p.m. However, CBS still produced the game, with announcers Verne Lundquist and Bill Raftery calling the game. All CBS affiliates in the finalists' home markets also carried the game."

The actual draw was apparently conducted one day before the format was announced by CAF. The pairings were:\nSão Tomé and Príncipe and the Central African Republic both withdrew in early September. As a result, Swaziland and Seychelles (the highest ranked of the ten nations) were no longer required to play in this round, and the teams they were originally matched against, Somalia and Djibouti, were redrawn to play each other instead. The tie between Djibouti and Somalia was played as a one leg tie in Djibouti, as Somalia was not deemed suitable for FIFA matches; the other two ties were played as two leg ties.\nThe winners advanced to the second round.\nMatches.\nMadagascar won 10 – 2 on aggregate and advanced to the second round.\nDjibouti advanced to the second round.

O'Connell played quarterback for the San Diego State Aztecs, and was selected by the New England Patriots in the third round of the 2008 NFL draft. O'Connell also played for the Detroit Lions, Miami Dolphins, New York Jets, and San Diego Chargers before retiring in 2012. O'Connell's NFL coaching career began in 2015; he held various assistant coaching roles on the Cleveland Browns, San Francisco 49ers, Washington Redskins, and Los Angeles Rams (where he won Super Bowl LVI, as offensive coordinator, in the 2021–2022 season).\nEarly years.\nO'Connell is the son of a former FBI agent. He spent his childhood in Carlsbad, California, where he attended La Costa Canyon High School. At La Costa Canyon, O'Connell lettered in both football and basketball.

As a senior, he was named his team's Most Valuable Player, and selected to All-League, All-North County, and All-San Diego teams. In basketball, he was a two-year letterman, and a teammate of Arizona standout Chase Budinger. O'Connell graduated from La Costa Canyon in 2003.\nPlaying career.\nCollege.\nO'Connell graduated from San Diego State University in December 2007 with a degree in political science. At SDSU, where he was a four-year team captain, he started 21 games, the sixth-most among SDSU quarterbacks, and ranked first in school history in career rushing yards and second in career rushing touchdowns among quarterbacks; in 2007 he led the team in rushing yards. Passing, he ranked tenth in yardage, eighth in attempts, and seventh in completions.\nO'Connell played in both the 2008 Hula Bowl and the 2008 East-West Shrine Game. He was the Kai team quarterback in the 2008 Hula Bowl, where he led the offense and was one of the Kai team's only bright spots. He was 11-of-21 for 147 yards, and completed the pass which resulted in the Kai's only score of the game.\nAt the 2008 NFL Combine, O'Connell ran the 40-yard dash in 4.61 seconds; only University of San Diego quarterback Josh Johnson had a faster time among quarterbacks. \nNew England Patriots.\nThe New England Patriots selected O'Connell with their fourth pick (94th overall) in the third round of the 2008 NFL draft. O'Connell rushed for a touchdown in the 2008 preseason against the New York Giants in the fourth quarter, in a game the Patriots eventually lost 19–14. He made his NFL debut on September 21, 2008, in the fourth quarter against the Miami Dolphins, throwing his first four career passes and completing three.\nO'Connell was waived by the Patriots on August 30, 2009, two days after a preseason game in which starting quarterback Tom Brady was injured, and, in the second half, O'Connell threw two interceptions and only threw 3 completions on 10 attempts. The Patriots gave no explanation for releasing O'Connell, who was in competition with veteran quarterback Andrew Walter, signed after his release from the Oakland Raiders, and undrafted free agent rookie Brian Hoyer of Michigan State.\nDetroit Lions.\nO'Connell was claimed off waivers by the Detroit Lions on September 1, 2009.\nNew York Jets.\nThe Lions traded O'Connell to the New York Jets, for a 7th round 2011 draft pick, on September 6, 2009.\nHe was named a team captain for the September 20 game against the New England Patriots.\nOn August 31, 2010, New York released O'Connell. Following his departure, O'Connell found that he had a torn labrum in his throwing arm, an injury he sustained during the preseason. The injury required surgery.\nFollowing his release, the New York Jets re-signed O'Connell to a two-year deal. He had been placed on the injured reserve list. He was later released again on July 29, 2011.\nMiami Dolphins.\nOn August 5, 2011, O'Connell signed with the Miami Dolphins, but was waived on September 3.\nSecond stint with the Jets.\nO'Connell was claimed off waivers by the Jets on September 4, 2011.\nSan Diego Chargers.\nO'Connell was signed by the San Diego Chargers on July 29, 2012, to serve as an emergency back-up in the Chargers' practices with Charlie Whitehurst suffering an injury and Kyle Boller announcing his retirement from the league. He was released on August 12, 2012.\nCoaching career.\nCleveland Browns.\nOn February 17, 2015, it was announced that O'Connell was named to the position of quarterbacks coach of the Cleveland Browns for the 2015 NFL season.\nSan Francisco 49ers.\nO'Connell was hired to the offensive staff of the San Francisco 49ers on February 26, 2016.\nWashington Redskins.\nOn January 20, 2017, O'Connell was hired as the Washington Redskins' quarterbacks coach, working under head coach Jay Gruden. In 2019, under interim head coach Bill Callahan, O'Connell was promoted to offensive coordinator. After the 2019–20 regular season, O'Connell was not retained by the incoming new head coach, Ron Rivera.\nLos Angeles Rams.\nOn January 16, 2020, O'Connell was hired by the Los Angeles Rams as offensive coordinator. In O'Connell's second season with the Rams, their offense ranked 2nd best in receiving touchdowns (41), 5th highest in total yards (4,893), 8th best in total touchdowns (63), and the team won Super Bowl LVI (defeating the Cincinnati Bengals, 23–20).\nMinnesota Vikings.\nOn February 16, 2022, just three days after his Super Bowl LVI victory, O'Connell was hired by the Minnesota Vikings as the 10th head coach in their franchise history. O'Connell's Vikings hiring reunited him with quarterback Kirk Cousins, whom O'Connell had coached in 2017 (Cousins' final year with the Washington Redskins). O'Connell won his first game as head coach against the Green Bay Packers in Week 1 of the 2022 season by a score of 23–7. \nO'Connell led the Vikings to a 13–4 record on the season, tying Matt LaFleur and Jim Harbaugh for the second-most wins for a rookie head coach in NFL history. The Vikings won the NFC North for the first time since 2017, which was good enough for the NFC's third seed, but were defeated by the New York Giants in the Wild Card round by a final score of 31–24."

He served as head football coach at Gardner–Webb University in 1983, The Citadel from 2001 to 2003, and the University of Southern Mississippi in 2012.\nAssistant coaching career.\nJohnson began his coaching career following his graduation from The Citadel in 1975, as the defensive ends coach at his alma mater under Bobby Ross in 1975. In 1976, Johnson accepted an assistant coaching position at Gaffney High School. He served as an assistant at Gaffney through the 1978 season before taking the defensive coordinator position at Spartanburg High School in 1979. After one season as defensive coordinator at Spartanburg, Johnson was promoted to head coach in 1980 and held the position through the 1981 season. As head coach he led the Vikings to a pair of playoff appearances and an overall record of 16 wins and eight losses (16–8). Johnson resigned his position to take the linebackers coach position at The Citadel.\nAfter his one season at Gardner–Webb, Johnson served as an assistant at Appalachian State, East Carolina and Southern Miss before being hired at Alabama by Gene Stallings for the 1990 season. At Alabama, Johnson served as linebackers coach and was on the staff that won the 1992 national championship. He resigned from Alabama after the 1993 season to become the defensive coordinator at Clemson. After three years at Clemson, Johnson returned to Alabama in January 1997 to serve as defensive coordinator for head coach Mike DuBose. He served at Alabama through the 2000 season when he was hired as head coach at The Citadel.\nAfter his three-year tenure with The Citadel, Johnson served as defensive coordinator at both Mississippi State (2004–2007) and South Carolina (2008–2011). \nWhile serving at South Carolina the Gamecocks won the SEC East Division championship for the first time in school history in 2010, clinching the title with a convincing 36–14 victory over the Florida Gators. It was a season of firsts for South Carolina, including their first win at Florida, first win over a No. 1 ranked team (Alabama), and first time sweeping the November \"Orange Crush\" portion of their schedule with wins over Tennessee, Florida and Clemson. Following a 9–3 regular season and an appearance in the SEC championship game. The Gamecocks had another strong season in 2011, beating every opponent in the division. With a 34–13 rout of Clemson, the Gamecocks won 10 games for only the second time in their 119-year football history.\nDuring his stint at South Carolina he signed Jadeveon Clowney; not only a five-star recruit, but also the No. 1 overall prospect of the 2011 class, throughout his senior year. In a live broadcast on ESPN on his eighteenth birthday—February 14, 2011—Clowney announced his commitment to South Carolina, selecting the Gamecocks over Clemson, Alabama, Louisiana State, and Florida State. He was the third-straight South Carolina \"Mr. Football\" to sign with the Gamecocks, following in the footsteps of his South Pointe teammate Gilmore, also recruited by Johnson.\nHe has coached in two national championship games, five SEC Championship games, has been part of one national title, three SEC Championships and has placed numerous players on NFL rosters.\nWhile defensive coordinator at South Carolina, Johnson also served as linebackers coach. In his final season with the Gamecocks, his defense ranked third nationally, allowing just 268 yards per game. Under Johnson, South Carolina finished in the Top 15 nationally in total defense three times.\nIn December 2011, Johnson took the head coaching position at Southern Miss. After one season, Johnson was fired from that position. After his dismissal from Southern Miss, on December 5, 2012, Johnson was hired as the defensive coordinator at Auburn. \nIron Bowl 2013. Johnson is credited for calling one of the most memorable plays in college football history. The Kick Six: Auburn's defensive coordinator, Ellis Johnson, doubted Alabama would make the long kick and suggested that defensive back Ryan Smith stand in the end zone with the potential to return a missed field goal. Just before the kick, Malzahn called a timeout to \"ice the kicker.\" During the timeout, Malzahn agreed with Johnson's idea to attempt a return of any missed field goal. However, he suggested Auburn's speedy punt returner, senior Chris Davis Jr., stand under the goalpost rather than Smith.With one second remaining in regulation, Alabama freshman Adam Griffith's 57-yard field goal attempt fell short. Auburn's Chris Davis was positioned at the back of the end zone and caught the errant kick, returning it 109 yards (100 yards under NCAA scoring rules) to the opposite end zone and giving Auburn the upset victory.\nIn late November 2014, reports began to surface on the internet claiming that Johnson's employment with Auburn University had been terminated. Johnson's firing was made official later in the day.\nJohnson returned to South Carolina in 2016, hired by head coach Will Muschamp to serve as an analyst until leaving that position in 2018.\nHead coaching career.\nGardner–Webb.\nAfter serving one season at The Citadel, on January 6, 1983, Johnson was named head coach at Gardner–Webb University. During his only season at Gardner–Webb in 1983, he led the Runnin' Bulldogs squad to a five wins and six losses (5–6). He resigned his position on January 10, 1984, to become the defensive coordinator for Mack Brown at Appalachian State.\nThe Citadel.\nAfter serving three seasons as defensive coordinator at Alabama, on December 21, 2000, Johnson was named head coach at The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina. During his three seasons at The Citadel from 2001 to 2003, he led the Bulldogs to 12 wins and 22 losses (12–22). He resigned his position on December 15, 2003, to become the defensive coordinator for Sylvester Croom at Mississippi State.\nSouthern Miss.\nJohnson was hired on December 20, 2011, as the Golden Eagles head coach. At his introductory news conference he noted USM's 18 straight winning seasons and said: \"I am convinced you can always be successful.\" He signed a four-year contract on August 20, 2012 (twelve days before the start of the 2012 season) that paid him a minimum of $740,000 annually, and was to run through December 23, 2015. In the event that Southern Miss decided to terminate the contract, Johnson would be paid $700,000 for each year left on his contract.\nPrior to Johnson's tenure, the Southern Miss football team had recorded eighteen straight winning seasons and been to ten consecutive postseason bowl appearances. In 2011, under Coach Larry Fedora, the Golden Eagles won a school record 12 games and finished in the Top 20 of both major polls after a victory in the 2011 Hawaii Bowl. Fedora departed for North Carolina after the 2011 season, yet the Golden Eagles were expected to experience continued success due to the fact that they would return 13 starters from the previous season. But the 2012 season quickly unraveled and ended with an 0–12 record. As a result, Johnson found himself dealing with an increasingly angry Golden Eagle fan base.\nPersonal life.\nJohnson has two sons, Eli and Charlie, and a daughter, Sandra Elliott."

        "text": "The Spiral is a bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton track located in Iizuna village, located north of Nagano, Japan. Used for the bobsleigh and luge competitions for the 1998 Winter Olympics, it is the first permanent bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton track in Asia and the first of its type in the world with two or more uphill sections. It is officially referred to as the Nagano Bobsleigh-Luge Park in Japan.\nHistory and current status.\nThe track was among part of the venues used for the 1998 Winter Olympics that was started in 1990. Construction on the track started in November 1993 and was completed in March 1996 with homologation from the International Bobsleigh and Tobogganing Federation (FIBT) on 28 March 1996 and from the International Luge Federation on 24 June 1997. This track was referred to as the \"Spiral\" because of the winding track and dynamic movement of the sleds. \nThe track has not been in active use for training or competitions since February 2018 when ice creation ceased. The reason for this was due to lack of operating revenue. Twenty years since the Nagano Olympics was hosted, various equipment like the electronic display board, refrigeration and lighting systems are needing to be replaced due to obsolescence and wear. While the track was in active use, the annual operational and repair budget was 220 million yen. However, after the track operations were suspended, the operational budget shrunk to only 20 million yen.\nThere were plans to use the Spiral once again as an Olympic sliding venue if Sapporo was successful in its bid to host the 2030 Winter Olympics. But, even if the Spiral was used for the 2030 Olympics, there were obvious fears that the track would once again cease to be commercially viable after the Olympics were held. However, Sapporo dropped its bid for 2030.\nAs of February 2022, 24 years after the Nagano Olympics was held, with the track no longer in active use nor properly cleaned and maintained, the track has degenerated into a dilapidated state.\nTrack technical details.\nOverall track construction cost ¥ 10.1 billion. The course was constructed in conformance of the natural topography of Mt. Iizuna. Three indirect ammonia refrigeration systems are located along the track, limiting the amount of ammonia to be under . During construction, rocks and trees that were dug up were used as materials to build settling ponds and a retaining wall to prevent landslides. Topsoil that had been removed during construction was returned to the site once groundwork was completed. About 40,000 saplings, mainly beech and oak, were planted two per square meter, as part of the environmental stewardship committed during the Winter Games.\nTo help with ice making techniques, Nagano Organizing Committee officials recruited Ralf Mende, who works for the bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton track in Altenberg, Germany to train staff to make proper ice. Mende and his crew worked 18 hours a day during the 1998 Games to ensure track thickness was of ice. Sun shades are used in an effort to maintain the operating temperatures of . Track competitions were also moved to the afternoon during the games to avoid the sunniest hours. There are a total of 56 sensors located throughout the track to maintain constant ice temperature and thickness.\nStatistics.\nThere are no listed turn names for the track. The track's two uphill sections are right after turn 8 with an average uphill inclination close to 4% and between turns 10 and 11 with an average uphill inclination of nearly 10%."

        "text": "This is a list of nations, as represented by National Olympic Committees (NOCs), that have participated in the Summer Olympic Games between 1896 and 2020 (held in 2021). As of the 2020 Games, all of the current 206 NOCs have participated in at least two editions of the Olympic Games. Athletes from Australia, France, Great Britain, Greece, Italy and Switzerland have competed in all twenty-nine Summer Olympic Games.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nEarly Games were not clearly documented with respect to participating nations. Competitors from 11 to 16 nations participated in the inaugural 1896 Games, in Athens. Eleven nations (Australia, Austria, Denmark, Great Britain, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States) are mentioned in the official report for the Games, and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) states that 14 nations were represented.\nThe NOCs for Bulgaria and Chile each claim that they were represented by a single athlete in Athens. Other sources also list Egypt, Italy, and the Turkish Empire.\nWhile official report was actually the summary of the sporting events held at the 1900 Exposition Universelle and so can not be considered as reliable source, the IOC states that 24 nations participated in the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, but additional sources list up to 28 nations, with Haiti, Iran, Luxembourg, and Peru being the additions.\nThe 1904 Games, held in St. Louis were the first Olympics outside of Europe, with very few top-class athletes from outside the North America taking part, and saw the participation of 12 to 15 nations, including a not yet existing Union of South Africa represented by a Boer team of extras from the Louisiana Purchase Exposition.\nAlthough the Intercalated Games of 1906 are no longer considered official \"Games of the Olympiad\" by the IOC, they helped restore the Olympic movement. Participation at subsequent Games grew steadily, with 22 nations in London for 1908 and 28 nations in Stockholm for the 1912 Games.\nAt these two Games (only), one of the delegations was actually a combined team of athletes from Australia and New Zealand, designated \"Australasia\".\nThe Games of 1916, planned for Berlin, were cancelled due to World War I.\nInter-war years.\nAfter the First World War, the Olympic Games resumed in 1920, in Antwerp. Twenty-nine nations participated, but not Austria, Bulgaria, Germany, Hungary, or Turkey, none of which were invited because of their roles in the war. Several newly created European states, such as Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, made their Olympic debut.\nThe Games grew rapidly for the 1924 Summer Olympics, in Paris, with 44 nations present,\neven though Germany was still not invited back to the Games. This situation would change for the 1928 Games where Germany returned to join a total of 46 participating nations.\nCompetitors from 37 nations travelled to Los Angeles for the 1932 Summer Olympics.\nThe 1936 Summer Olympics, in Berlin, were attended by 49 nations (a new high) but were highly politicized.\nThe scheduled Games of 1940 in Tokyo or Helsinki and 1944 in London were each cancelled due to the outbreak of World War II in 1939.\nPost-war years and Cold War era.\nTwelve years after the previous Games, the 1948 Summer Olympics, in London, attracted competitors from 59 nations, including 14 that made their Olympic debut; once again, Germany was not invited to take part, and neither was Japan. The 1952 Games, in Helsinki, again set a new high, with 69 nations participating, including the first appearance by the Soviet Union and People's Republic of China and the return of Germany and Japan. The 1956 Summer Olympics, attended by 67 nations in Melbourne, were the first to be marred by a boycott. Egypt, Iraq, and Lebanon withdrew in response to the Suez Crisis, and the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland withdrew in response to the Soviet invasion of Hungary. Because of Australian quarantine restrictions, the equestrian events were held five months earlier in Stockholm, with a total of 29 participating nations, including five nations that did not compete in Melbourne.\nParticipation by African and Latin American nations increased significantly during the 1960s. A total of 84 nations were represented at the 1960 Summer Olympics, in Rome, 94 nations at the 1964 Games, in Tokyo, and 112 nations at the 1968 Summer Olympics, in Mexico City.\nThe 1968 Games also marked the first time that West Germany and East Germany competed as independent teams. For the previous three Olympiads (1956–1964), the two NOCs were jointly represented by a united German team. The 1972 Summer Olympics, in Munich, featured 121 nations, the highest total yet.\nThe next three Games were each marred by significant boycotts. At the 1976 Summer Olympics, in Montreal, only 92 nations were represented.\nTwenty-nine African nations (Ivory Coast and Senegal being the only two exceptions) boycotted the Games because of New Zealand's participation, as New Zealand maintained other sporting relations with apartheid South Africa. The largest Olympic boycott took place at the 1980 Games, in Moscow, when only 80 nations participated. The United States led the boycott in protest of the December 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and were joined by more than 60 other nations. In response, the 1984 Summer Olympics, in Los Angeles, were boycotted by the Soviet Union and their allies, yet a total of 140 nations did participate.\nThe 1988 Games, in Seoul, marked a new high, with 160 participating nations.\nRecent Games.\nSeveral events in the 1990s led to a large increase in participating nations at the Olympic Games. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Baltic states competed as independent nations for the first time since 1936 at the 1992 Games, in Barcelona.\nThe remaining twelve ex-republics of the Soviet Union competed together as the Unified Team for these Games. A single German team competed for the first time since 1964, after the German reunification in 1990, while the breakup of Yugoslavia resulted in the Olympic debut of new nations.\nThe Centennial Olympics, in Atlanta, were attended by athletes from 197 nations, including 24 nations making their Summer Games debut. Czechoslovakia had split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia, and all ex-Soviet republics competed as independent nations. The Games continued to grow, with 199 nations represented in Sydney, for the 2000 Summer Games, and 201 nations in Athens, for the 2004 Summer Olympics.\nA record number of nations (204) were represented at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, with Marshall Islands and Tuvalu making their Olympic debut. After competing together as Serbia and Montenegro in 2004, Serbia and Montenegro sent independent teams to Beijing. Only Brunei failed to participate in the Games, after failing to register any athletes for competition.\nThe 2012 Games in London increased this record to 206 nations, even though only 204 NOCs were represented. Brunei returned to the Games, but athletes from the former Netherlands Antilles competed as Independent Olympic Athletes, after the Netherlands Antilles Olympic Committee's membership in the IOC was withdrawn in 2011 as a consequence of the dissolution of the Caribbean country. One athlete from South Sudan also competed as an independent athlete, since the nation had not yet formed a National Olympic Committee after its independence in 2011.\nA further increase occurred in the 2016 Summer Olympics, with 206 nations represented: South Sudanese athletes were able to compete under their nation's flag and Kosovo made their debut as an independent team. There was also a team made up of refugees, made up of athletes from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, South Sudan and Syria who had fled their home countries and could not compete under their home NOC.\nDespite the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, the 2020 Summer Olympics in 2021 also had 206 teams represented, with only North Korea boycotting. However, the Russian Olympic Committee was banned, and Russian athletes competed as independent athletes with no national flag and anthem, due to doping sanctions.\nList of nations.\nDescription.\nThis list includes all 206 current NOCs, 21 obsolete NOCs and 3 other entries, arranged alphabetically. The three-letter country code is also listed for each NOC. Since the 1960s, these codes have been frequently used by the IOC and each Games organizing committee to identify NOCs, such as within the official report of each Games. However, in this section, several countries uses long-form names designated by the United Nations uses short form common names such as for example: Laos (Lao People's Democratic Republic), North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), and Moldova (Republic of Moldova).\nSeveral nations have changed during their Olympic history. Name changes due to geographical renaming are explained by footnotes after the nation's name, and other notes are explained by footnotes linked within the table itself.\nObsolete nations.\nObsolete nations are included in the table to more clearly illustrate past Olympic appearances for their successor nations."

        "title": "Albany Great Danes men's lacrosse",
        "text": "The Albany Great Danes men's lacrosse team represents the University at Albany in NCAA Division I men's college lacrosse. Albany currently competes in the America East Conference and plays its home games on Bob Ford Field at Tom &amp; Mary Casey Stadium. The team has reached the NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship tournament ten times. The Great Danes are currently coached by Scott Marr.\nHistory.\nThe program began in 1970 with a 3–7 record competing in Division III. In 1975, the program would reach the ECAC Division III Tournament under coach Dave Armstrong. From 1975 to 1997, the Great Danes would reach two more ECAC Division III Tournaments. In 1997 the Great Danes would reach the finals of the ECAC Division II Tournament.\n2000–2006.\nIn 2000, the Great Danes began play in the America East at the Division I level. In 2001, Scott Marr was given the reins of the program. Even though the Great Danes finished with a 3–8 record in 2001, they compiled an 8–6 regular season to take the regular season conference championship in the America East in 2002. They would reach the championship game but lose to the Stony Brook Seawolves 8–6.\nLed by a new crop of recruits, some of the first lacrosse players in school history to be on scholarship, such as Kevin Rae and Luke Daquino, the Great Danes would start making a mark on college lacrosse in 2003. The Great Danes would go 8–6 and seek revenge against Stony Brook in the America East semi-finals 11–5 to move on to face the University of Hartford for the America East Championship. On May 3, 2003, Albany would defeat Hartford 7–5 to win their first ever America East Championship. They would go on to face and lose to Princeton University in the first round on the NCAA Tournament.\nThe success for the Great Danes would not stop after 2003. With incoming recruits and a strong core of returning players, the Great Danes would continue their championship ways. In 2004, including an upset against the University of Massachusetts Amherst, the Great Danes would go on to win another America East Championship. They would play Syracuse University in the first round and lose 21–13.\nThe surge would continue into 2005 as the Great Danes defeated Stony Brook 16–7 to win their third straight America East Championship. However, the first round NCAA Tournament jinx would continue as the Great Danes were demolished by the University of Virginia 23–9.\n2006 would be an off year for the Great Danes. With all-time career points leader at the time Luke Daquino and career saves leader Kevin Rae graduated, the team was young and over matched. The Great Danes would sneak into the America East Tournament, but lose 19–10 to UMBC. However, it would be soon that the Great Danes would go back to their winning ways.\nDespite a season of struggles in 2006, the program took one major stride during the season. In the fall of 2005, John Fallon Field was completed and became the new home of the Great Danes. An all-weather facility, Albany finally had a place to call home. In previous seasons the team would play home games at University Field. However, due to harsh winters and wet springs, the field was usually not in playing condition come lacrosse season. This forced many home games to be played at local high schools and community colleges. With John Fallon Field, Albany now had one of the premier outdoor lacrosse fields in the Northeast.\n2007 season.\nIn the 2007 season, the lacrosse team would be ranked in the top-25 in both USILA and Nike/Inside Lacrosse polls and reached a high of #2 in the USILA poll. Notable wins were against #1 ranked Johns Hopkins Blue Jays and #10 Delaware. On May 13, 2007, the men's lacrosse team became the first team at the Division I level to advance/win a match in the NCAA Tournament, defeating Loyola College in Maryland 19–10 in front of nearly 3,000 people at John Fallon Field. One week later, the Great Danes were defeated by undefeated Cornell University 12–11 in the NCAA Quarterfinals at Princeton University.\nThe team finished ranked #4 in the Nike/Inside Lacrosse poll, the highest ranking for any team in school history. Head Coach Scott Marr was awarded the USILA Division I National Lacrosse Coach of the Year to cap the amazing season.\nOne of the big stars for the lacrosse team in 2007 was senior attackman Frank Resetarits. He would become the first Great Dane in school history to earn first-team All-American honors as he was selected to the 2007 USILA All-America Team. Resetarits was also named a finalist for the Tewaaraton Trophy. Resetarits would also become the first lacrosse player in school history to be drafted into the Major League Lacrosse, selected by the Washington Bayhawks, but being traded and making his debut with the Long Island Lizards. Resetarits would also join the National Lacrosse League, drafted #5 overall by the San Jose Stealth in 2007 NLL Draft.\nResetarits was joined in the pros by UAlbany elite goal scorer Merrick Thomson. Thomson would sign a free agent contract with the New Jersey Pride on the MLL, and then drafted #2 overall by the Philadelphia Wings in the 2007 NLL Draft. Thomson and Restarts were respectively ranked one and two in career points at Albany following the season. Defender Liam Gleason was also signed by the New Jersey Pride shortly after the 2007 Major League Lacrosse draft.\nTwo other pieces of the championship team were drafted in the 2008 Major League Lacrosse draft. Midfielder Jordan Levine was selected 10th Overall by the New Jersey Pride, reuniting him with Thomson and Gleason. Star goaltender Brett Queener was selected 48th Overall by the Rochester Rattlers making him the 5th UAlbany graduate to play professionally in Major League Lacrosse.\n2013 season.\nThe 2013 season opened with high expectations. Many in the media felt the team had the ability to go far in the NCAA Tournament. Those predictions grew further in the season opener at Syracuse. The Great Danes had never beaten The Orange, who were ranked #13 in the nation. However, UAlbany would knock them in double-overtime 16–15. It would be the first season opening loss for Syracuse since 1996. Anthony \"Antdog\" Ostrander played a key role in the win, shutting down JoJo Marasco, arguably Syracuse's best player, in double overtime to solidify the victory.\nAfter going 5–3 in their next eight games, the Great Danes would travel to Johns Hopkins. With the games being shown on national television (ESPNU), the Great Danes once again pulled off an upset. UAlbany, ranked #20 at the time, would defeat the #10 ranked Blue Jays 10–9. Freshman goalie Blaze Riorden had his best game of his short career, recording 20 saves.\nThe Great Danes would finish 4–1 to finish the season, 11–4 overall. UAlbany would go 5–0 in regular season America East play for the second time in program history. Amazingly, the Great Danes would go 9–2 on the road while only 3–2 at home. On May 4, after a five years without a title, the Great Danes would defeat UMBC 19–10 to win the America East Championship. However, the Great Danes would fall to Denver in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. Head Coach Scott Marr would record his 100th career win at UAlbany during the season.\nThompson Trio.\nMuch of the Great Danes success in 2013 was centered around one family. Miles Thompson, Ty Thompson and Lyle Thompson (also known as the Thompson Trio), were a vital part of the Great Danes offense. Miles and Lyle are brothers, while Ty is their cousin (another brother, Jeremy Thompson played for Syracuse until 2011). All three were star recruits coming to UAlbany. The three were born in the Onondaga Nation, a nine-square-mile independent political entity recognized by the United States. Each of the Thompsons wore a traditional native hair style, with long braids that became their trademark on the field. The three also became known for their skills on the field, which involved trick passes and stick handling, behind the back shots, one handed shots and their quick agility.\nIn 2013, Ty Thompson would score 51 goals, Miles would score 42 and Lyle 46 goals going into the NCAA Tournament. The fourth leading scorers for the Great Danes, Will Fuller and John Maloney, had only 18 goals. Lyle Thompson would be the key factor for the Great Danes. The sophomore was vital in leading the No. 1 offense in the nation with 108 points through 17 games. Lyle became the eighth men's lacrosse player in NCAA history to record 100 points in a season. He finished seven points behind all-time NCAA record holder Steve Marahol's (UMBC) 114 points (37g, 77a) set in 1992. He would win the America East Player of the Year Award and became the second Great Dane to be named a Tewaaraton Award finalist, and the first Native American to be named a Tewaaraton Award finalist.\nIn 2014, the Thompsons would continue their unbelievable play. Despite a shaky 9–5 regular season, the Great Danes would be the #1 overall seed in the America East Tournament. Lyle would become only the third player in conference history to win back-to-back Player of the Year Awards. Earning at least four points in all 14 games played, the junior attack has earned a Division I-best 61 assists and 37 goals in the regular season. In the American East Tournament, Lyle became the first Division I player ever to earn two 100-point seasons. On May 3, 2014, the Great Danes would win their second straight America East Championship, defeating UMBC 20–11.\nOn May 10, 2014, the Great Danes would take on Loyola in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. Loyola was the number one ranked team in the nation going into the game. The Great Danes, with strong defensive play, defeated the Greyhounds 13–6 for the second NCAA Tournament victory in school history. In the game Lyle would become the DI single season record holder in points, beating out Marahol's record he just missed in the previous season. In the game Miles would also pass Marahol's numbers to become second on that list after scoring five goals and two assists. The Great Danes would end up losing 14–13 in overtime to Notre Dame in the Quarterfinals the following week.\nAs a junior Lyle would compile the top single season point total in DI history, earning 128 points as well as tying the DI single season assists record with 77, adding 51 goals. He became the first player in DI history to have a pair of 100+ point seasons after finishing with 113 last year. In UAlbany's 18 games in 2014 he scored at least four points, including 11 seven+ point contests. He was named Division I Outstanding Player of the Year and the DI Outstanding Attackman by the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA) in 2014.\nOn May 29, 2014, both Miles and Lyle Thompson were named the co-winners of the 2014 Tewaaraton Trophy. It was the first time ever that two players shared, and a Native American was awarded, the trophy. Two days later, Miles and Ty were officially put on the active roster of the MLL Rochester Rattlers. It was also announced that Miles would return to the program in 2015 as a Graduate Assistant.\nThe success of the Thompson Trio on the field led to a national press following in late 2014. CNN, CBS and ABC all did nightly news pieces on the three. The NY Times also did a story on them, which was posted on the front page of the newspaper. In all the pieces the three talked about their heritage, the acceptance of their heritage at UAlbany, supporting the Onondaga Nation and promoting the game of lacrosse.\nOne of the Greats.\nIn 2015, Lyle Thompson cemented himself as one of the greatest collegiate lacrosse players in NCAA history. He was named the recipient of the 2015 Tewaaraton Trophy for the top player in men's lacrosse and was the first ever male lacrosse player to earn the award in two consecutive seasons. In 2015, Thompson led the NCAA in points per game for the third-straight year with 6.37 a contest and assists per game at 3.63 a contest. He finished with an NCAA Division I best 121 points, the second-highest single season tally in DI history, and 69 assists, adding 52 goals. He would lead UAlbany to a third-consecutive America East regular season and tournament title. The Great Danes would take on Cornell in the first round of the NCAA Tournament, winning 19–10. In a rematch of the 2014 quarterfinals, UAlbany would fall to Notre Dame 14–10. Thompson finished his career as the all-time Division I points and assists leader, concluding with 400 points off 175 goals and 225 assists from 2012 to 2015 with UAlbany. In his career he played in 70 games, scoring in 68 of them and earned multiple points in each of his last 44 games, including all contests in 2014 and 2015.\n#1 Ranking and the Final Four.\n2018 started with much anticipated hype, as the Great Danes looked like they would have one of the best offenses in the nation, led by Senior Connor Fields and incoming freshman Tehoka Nanticoke, one of the most highly ranked high school players in the nation. The Great Danes would open up the season ranked #3 in the nation. UAlbany did not disappoint, crushing Syracuse 15–3 in their first game. One week later, after an 18–5 win over the Drexel, the Great Danes would be ranked as the #1 team in the nation by the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA) coaches poll and the Inside Lacrosse Maverik media poll. It would be the first time that any UAlbany Division I team, and any DI program affiliated with the State of New York (SUNY) system, had been ranked #1 in its history. The Great Danes would win eight consecutive games as the #1 ranked team in the nation, including an amazing 4th quarter comeback against #2 ranked Maryland 11–10 on March 10 of 2018. The streak and #1 ranking would last until April 6, when UAlbany was upset by UMBC 11–7.\nMost of the mid-season success for UAlbany came without their key weapons on the field. Connor Fields suffered a knee injury in a March 24 victory over UMAss-Lowell. He would re-injure the knee in the second to last game of the season in a 14–6 loss to Yale. However, new stars would rise to lead the Great Danes to success. Sophomore Faceoff Specialist TD Ierlan became a star, becoming one of the elite face-off men in the country. Sophomore Jakob Patterson and Senior Kyle McClancy stepped up on offense, while goalie JD Colarusso was a force in net.\nThe Great Danes would run through the America East Tournament as the #1 seed and host to take home the title on May 5 in a 14–4 win over Vermont. UAlbany would be given the #2 overall seed in the 2018 NCAA Lacrosse Tournament and would host the Southern Conference champion Richmond Spiders in the 1st Round of the tournament. Despite a close game early on, UAlbany would win 18–9 to advance to the NCAA Quarterfinals to face the Denver Pioneers at Hofstra.\nThe May 19th match-up put two elite programs head to head. However, much hype was focused on the battle of the top two faceoff-men in the country, UAlbany's TD Ierlan and Denver's Trevor Baptiste. In this game, each player would go 15-of-30. Ierlan had the final faceoff victory and ground ball with 38 seconds left as UAlbany ran out the clock for the win. During the game Ierlan would win his 341st faceoff of the season, setting a new NCAA single season record. The former record holder was Brendan Fowler, who had 339 faceoff wins for Duke in 2013. The game was tight to the end, with the Great Danes holding a four-goal lead with under five minutes to play. Despite a furious comeback, UAlbany held on 15–13 to advance to the Final Four for the first time in school history after going 0–4 in their previous trips to the Quarterfinals. It would be the first time a SUNY school earned a trip to a Men's Division I Final Four. UAlbany also matched its single season wins record with its 16th victory today. UAlbany was 16–3 in 2015. Also, UAlbany's senior class earned its 59th victory, becoming the winningest class in program history. The class was 59–11 overall in its four years.\nSeason results.\nThe following is a list of Albany's season results since the institution of NCAA Division I in 1971 (Albany competed as a Division III program from 1970 to 1995 and as a Division II program from 1996 to 1999):\n† NCAA canceled 2020 collegiate activities due to the COVID-19 virus\nAlumni in the PLL.\nThis is a list of Albany alumni currently playing in the Premier Lacrosse League:\nDivision I Award winners.\nSource:\nDivision I First Team All-Americans.\nSource:\nNational team players.\nSource:\nThis is a list of Albany alumni who have played in either a World Lacrosse Championship or World Lacrosse Box Championships:"

Rugby union requires only one nation to recognise a match as a test in order for it to be included in test statistics for that nation. The British and Irish Lions and Pacific Islanders do not represent a single country, but they are selected by a group of national unions and are recognised as test teams. Some national teams have sometimes granted test caps for matches against teams such as the invitational Barbarians side; these are included only if the union granted test caps for a particular match."

        "text": "James William Hayter (born 14 August 1978) is an English former rugby union player who played as a hooker. Born in Plymouth, he attended the University of Liverpool, during which time he played for Orrell. After graduating in 1999, he signed for Coventry, where he attracted the attention of several Premiership clubs, including Harlequins. He signed for Harlequins in 2001, but was out of the game with a foot injury for the first 19 months of his time there. He remained at Harlequins for a total of six years before joining the Llanelli Scarlets on a short-term contract in 2007. At the end of the 2007–08 season, he was allowed to leave the Welsh region and was quickly signed up by Esher. However, shortly after joining Esher, he left the club to pursue a career outside rugby in the United States.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Plymouth, Devon, Hayter attended the University of Liverpool, where he achieved a BA degree in Economic and Social History, graduating in 1999.\nCareer.\nWhile attending the University of Liverpool, Hayter began his professional rugby career with nearby Orrell, where he spent three seasons. After graduation, Hayter had the option of moving to Cambridge University or signing for professional rugby clubs Coventry and Saracens; he preferred the option of going professional, but because of the number of hookers already on Saracens' books, he opted to play full-time with Coventry, where he would be coached by his England Under-21s coach, Keith Richardson. Saracens' manager at the time, Mark Evans, became chief executive at Harlequins in 2000, and made an approach to sign Hayter in April 2001. However, soon after signing, Hayter suffered a foot injury that ruled him out for the entirety of the 2001–02 season.\nAfter 19 months out of the game, Hayter made his debut for Harlequins on 10 May 2003, playing in a 25–21 away win over London Wasps in the Zurich Premiership. Hayter played for Harlequins for another four years, and in 2007 he was selected to play for the Barbarians invitational team against the national teams of Tunisia and Spain. However, that summer he was released from his contract with Harlequins and was picked up by the Llanelli Scarlets in July 2007. Hayter was signed by the Scarlets as cover for first-choice hooker Matthew Rees, who was on international duty with Wales at the 2007 Rugby World Cup, but in injury to back-up hooker Ken Owens meant that Hayter was kept on longer than intended and given the opportunity to make the number 2 jersey at the Scarlets his own.\nHowever, after the arrival of Mahonri Schwalger at the West Wales region, Hayter was deemed surplus to requirements and was one of four players released by the Scarlets at the end of the 2007–08 season. He was subsequently signed by Esher of National Division One. However, his stay with Esher was short-lived as he took up a business position outside of rugby in the United States shortly after the start of the 2008–09 season."

        "title": "Lacrosse helmet",
        "text": "A lacrosse helmet is a helmet worn primarily in men's lacrosse, but also worn optionally by women's lacrosse players in Australia. Modern helmets consist of a hard plastic, non-adjustable shell with thick padding on the inside, a face mask made of metal bars, and a chinstrap used to secure the helmet to the head. Some players also attach a sun visor shielding the eyes, though these visors are not legal in most leagues (unless they are clear).\nHelmets are required at all levels of organized men's lacrosse, but only required for goalies in women's lacrosse.\nThe main difference between helmets is weight, field of vision, and fit. It is important that the lacrosse helmet fit snug to your head to limit injury. Most helmets in the game today offer unique ways of adjusting the helmet size so you can customize it to fit your head. Lacrosse helmets are riddled with air vents to increase air flow and decrease its weight. All helmets come with an adjustable chin strap for added protection.\nHistory.\nEarly lacrosse players did not wear helmets. When lacrosse was played at the 1908 Summer Olympics, neither of the competing teams wore helmets. At the 1928, 1932 and 1948 Olympics where lacrosse was a demonstration sport, only the United States wore helmets while the opposing teams did not. The 1928 Olympics was the first documented use of lacrosse helmets.\nManufacturers.\nThe most common manufacturers in men's lacrosse are Cascade, Warrior, Brine, and STX.\nHelmet use in women's lacrosse.\nFollowing a number of head injuries to female players in the 1980s in South Australia, players and coaches moved to adopt the optional use of protective headgear in the women's game. As the movement — led by Australian 1986 World Champions players Wendy Piltz and Jenny Williams and South Australia coach Peter Koshnitsky — grew, players were given authorization on a trial basis to wear close-fitting, full-face helmets, first by South Australia and then by the governing body, the Australian Women's Lacrosse Council (AWLC). Further efforts were made to have the optional helmet rule adopted at the international level of play but were unsuccessful.\nIn the United States, the governing body, US Lacrosse requires the use of protective goggles and mouth guards but has not endorsed helmet use with the exception of goal keepers (goalies).\nIn the United States, the Florida High School Athletics Association (FHSAA), the governing body of high school athletics in the State of Florida, made helmets mandatory equipment for girls lacrosse at the Varsity and sub-Varsity levels beginning with the 2018 season. As of 2019, Florida is the only state to mandate the use of helmets in girls lacrosse. Helmets are not required in girls travel or recreation-level lacrosse."

The tournament was hosted by Saskatoon and Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada, from December 26, 2009, to January 5, 2010. Saskatoon had hosted the tournament once before, in 1991. The medal round, as well as all Canada's preliminary round games, took place in Saskatoon at the Credit Union Centre. The arena underwent renovations and upgrades before the 2010 tournament, including an increase in capacity. Other games were played at the Brandt Centre in Regina, which also received upgrades. In addition, pre-tournament exhibition games were held in other towns and cities throughout the province as well as Calgary, Alberta. In the gold medal match, the United States defeated the pre-tournament favourites and host country Canada 6–5 in overtime on a goal by John Carlson to win their second gold medal and first since 2004, ending Canada's bid for a record-breaking sixth consecutive gold medal.\nOther host candidates.\nInitially, Switzerland was chosen to host the tournament, but later withdrew.\nThree bid groups submitted letters of intent to host the 2010 tournament prior to the February 1, 2008, deadline:\nAll three bid groups formally placed their bids before the April 1, 2008, deadline and made their final presentations to the selection committee in Toronto on June 9–10, 2008.\nOn July 7, 2008, Hockey Canada and the Canadian Hockey League (CHL) announced Saskatoon and Regina have been chosen to host the tournament. This was Saskatchewan's first successful bid in five recent attempts, after failing to land the 1999, 2003, 2006 and 2009 tournaments.\nTop division.\nThe lowest-ranked teams in the top division are relegated to Division I for the following year's tournament.\nPreliminary round.\nTen teams were divided into two groups of five, each of which play in a single round-robin format.

        "text": "The 2012 IIHF U20 World Championship (commonly known as the 2012 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships) was the 36th edition of the Ice Hockey World Junior Championship. It was hosted in Calgary and Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. It began on December 26, 2011, and ended with the gold medal game played in Calgary on January 5, 2012. Sweden defeated defending-champion Russia 1–0 in overtime to win their first title in 31 years. Russian forward Evgeny Kuznetsov was named MVP of the tournament. Denmark was relegated to Division I and Germany was promoted to the 2013 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships.\nCanada missed the final for the first time in 11 years when they lost 6–5 against Russia in a semifinal in which Canada were down 6–1 halfway through the third period. However, the Canadians extended their consecutive medal streak at the tournament to 14 (5 gold, 6 silver, 3 bronze) with a 4–0 victory over Finland in the bronze medal game. The fourth-place finish for Finland was their best result in the tournament since 2006. The United States ended up in the relegation round for the first time since 1999.\nHost city selection.\nOn February 1, 2008, Hockey Canada and the Canadian Hockey League announced that six groups had submitted letters of intent to bid to host the 2012 tournament: Calgary/Edmonton; Halifax, Nova Scotia; London/Windsor, Ontario; Saskatoon, Saskatchewan; Toronto; and Winnipeg. The London/Windsor, Halifax and Winnipeg bids withdrew before the application deadline, leaving three groups. Saskatoon was selected to host the 2010 tournament with Regina, Saskatchewan, leaving only the Calgary/Edmonton and Toronto bids for this tournament.\nThe Alberta bid, supported by the National Hockey League's Calgary Flames and Edmonton Oilers as well as the Western Hockey League's Calgary Hitmen and Edmonton Oil Kings, was selected to host the tournament on August 28, 2008. It will be the second time the tournament has been hosted in the province; Red Deer served as the primary host of the 1995 World Junior Championship, while some tournament games were played in both Calgary and Edmonton.\nAttendance.\nAs part of their bid, the two cities projected that they would generate a tournament record attendance in excess of 475,000 fans and provide an economic benefit of $42 million to the province of Alberta. Following a reserved offering of 10- and 21-game ticket packs for Edmonton and Calgary games respectively to season ticket holders of the Oilers, Oil Kings, Flames and Hitmen, the tournament committee held a lottery to award the right to purchase the remaining seats. While the entry deadline was supposed to coincide with the conclusion of the 2011 tournament, organizers were flooded with so many entries that their website servers crashed. Organizers were overwhelmed by the response; over 187,000 entries were received for the draw.\nCalling the demand unprecedented, Hockey Canada announced that the 17,000 ticket packages made available to lottery winners had sold out in a matter of days, a year in advance of the tournament. While organizers were pleased with the result, the way the lottery was handled has angered fans who won the right to purchase tickets but were unable to do so as no tickets were left when their turn to buy arrived.\nUltimately, a new attendance record was set, but not by the margin initially anticipated. The total of 455,342 fans was 2,060 fans more than the previous record of 453,282 from 2009. Though many more tickets were sold as part of tournament packages, the IIHF only counts actual paid spectators in attendance in its figures.\nTop division.\nEach round was a round-robin tournament, where the teams played each other once within their group. The Preliminary Round was divided into two groups: Group A and Group B, which included five teams each. From each group, the top three teams qualified for the playoffs; the 1st-ranked teams earned a direct trip to the Semifinals, while the 2nd and 3rd-ranked teams qualified for the Quarterfinals. The 4th and 5th-ranked teams had to play in the Relegation Round, where the three best teams qualified for the Top Division tournament in 2013, with the last-placed team being relegated to the 2013 Division I tournament. In the Semifinals, the directly-qualified Semifinalists faced the winners from the Quarterfinals.\nPreliminary round.\nGroup A.\nAll round robin games held in Calgary, Alberta, at the Scotiabank Saddledome.\n\"All times are local (Mountain Time Zone – UTC−7).\"\nGroup B.\nAll round robin games held in Edmonton, Alberta, at Rexall Place.\n\"All times are local (Mountain Time Zone – UTC−7).\"\nRelegation round.\nThe results from matches between teams from the same group in the preliminary round were carried forward to this round.\n\"All times are local (Mountain Time Zone – UTC−7).\"\nMedalists.\nSource:\nGold medal celebration.\nSweden's gold medal win was their first since 1981, as well as their second gold medal in total.

        "text": "Portland Rugby Football Club is one of the oldest rugby clubs in the state of Maine, having been founded in 1969 along with the Bowdoin Rugby Football Club. Since its foundation, the team has been playing in a Division II men's league (apart from several stints in Division I), which is attributed to the New England Rugby Football Union.\nHistory.\nOriginally, the club began in Brunswick, Maine, approximately 25 miles north of Portland. Bowdoin College offered both new players as well as facilities. The team had access to athletic facilities, locker rooms, a playing field, and a practice field. The nearby Brunswick Naval Air Station provided players who had rugby backgrounds. In this scenario, the club began to grow, attracting more players. While the club drew interest to surrounding Brunswick residents, players from Portland began joining the team. As more and more Portland players joined the team, it became increasingly difficult for the Portland players, who made the majority of the team, to travel to and from Brunswick nearly four times a week. In 1974, plans were drawn up and the club was moved to Portland, while the Bowdoin Rugby Football Club stayed in Brunswick.\nWhile playing fields were a little bit more difficult to acquire, local restaurants and bars in Portland's Oldport offered exciting postgame festivities, of which both the club and the opposing club were able to enjoy together. With the move, the team accepted even more new members and found many loyal fans. In 1979, the team won its first Division I championship in the New England Rugby Football Union. The club has also gone international, touring Ireland in 1978, 1982, 1989 and 1994, and England and Wales in 1985. In 1996 a former player, founded the Portland Youth Rugby Club, teaching the sport to high school students in the surrounding areas.\nIn 2019, the club celebrated its 50th anniversary by releasing a yearbook and going on an anniversary tour in Ireland, where they played two matches against Sligo RFC and Portadown RFC. The 50th anniversary banquet was subsequently cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A rescheduled 50th Anniversary Banquet is scheduled for September 18, 2021."

Byrne played with Melbourne, Hawthorn and Sydney in the Victorian Football League (VFL) from 1977 to 1989. He also coached his junior side in 1994–95. Currently Byrne is the head coach of Super Rugby Pacific team Fijian Drua.\nFootball career.\nVictorian Football League.\nA 200 cm tall ruckman, Byrne started his career at Melbourne in 1977 and one game into his sixth season with the club decided to cross to Hawthorn. Byrne kicked 8 goals straight in his debut game for the Hawks against Footscray in 1982. He finished the year with 47 goals. In 1983, Byrne finished equal fifth in the Brownlow Medal and was a member of Hawthorn's premiership side, kicking three goals in the Grand Final.\nHe holds the Hawthorn record for the most behinds in a VFL/AFL game without a goal, after kicking 0.8 in a game against Melbourne in 1985. In the history of the league, only Stuart Spencer and Tom Allen are known to have kicked more behinds without a goal (11).\nByrne moved to Sydney in 1987, playing 21 games for the Swans before his retirement at the end of the 1989 VFL season. In all Byrne played 167 league games and kicked 150 goals.\nRugby union coaching.\nFollowing his retirement, Byrne became involved in coaching, with his long kicking ability proving an advantage as he became a skills coach in rugby union. He worked as a coach in England and Scotland in the early 2000s. Byrne was appointed skills coach of the Leinster Rugby Club alongside Australian coach Matt Williams in the 2002–03 season. In 2003, Byrne, as well as Williams, left Leinster for Scotland for the same roles.\nNew Zealand, Australia.\nIn the role from 2003 to 2005, Byrne left Scotland following an appointment by New Zealand as a skills and kicking coach in May 2005, which saw him in the role for over a decade.

        "text": "The Paramonovo bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton track is a bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton located in Paramonovo, Russia, outside of Moscow.\nHistory.\nDuring the 1970s, the Soviet Union found success in luge with Vera Zozula, Dainis Bremse, Algars Kirkis, and Sergey Danilin at the Winter Olympics, FIL World Luge Championships, and FIL European Luge Championships. By 1986, a track at Sigulda in the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic (now Latvia) was completed which allowed bobsledders and lugers to compete. Following the breakup of the Soviet Union in late 1991, which included Latvia's independence a year earlier, the Sigulda track became part of Latvia as a result. This caused Russia's bobsleigh and luge program to suffer throughout most of that decade. In the late 1990s, Russia began to gather success again in bobsleigh, luge, specifically with Alexandre Zoubkov and Albert Demtschenko who won a total of two Winter Olympic medals (both at the 2006 games), four world championship medals (all by Zoubkov), and three European luge championships medals (all by Demtschenko). Russia also won a world championship medal in skeleton in 2003. Because of the success of the Russian sliding teams, it was decided to construct not one, but two new tracks. The first would be near Moscow while the second one would be in Krasnaya Polyana with the latter part of Sochi's bid to earn the 2014 Winter Olympics. The foundation stone was laid down in February 2007. By July 2007, 400 meters of the track had been completed. Track construction was completed in December 2007. Official opening of the track occurred on 10 March 2008. Construction cost for the track was USD45 million. The Russian national championships also took place during that time. The track was partially homologated by the International Luge Federation (FIL) during the weekend of 29 March 2009. Over 100 runs were performed from the three different start houses (Men's singles, Women's singles/ men's doubles, and juniors) without any accidents occurring. Reasons the track was not fully homologated included extending the safety walls and location to store the sleds and equipment at the women's start house. According to Germany's Klaus Bonsack, a member of the FIL Track Construction Commission, brickwork has already been completed for a hotel near the track. The track will debut by hosting the first two Luge Junior World Cups on 7–12 December 2009. Homologation for the track was given for this event on 8 December 2009. The first bobsleigh and skeleton competition took place at the track on 21 March 2010.\nSince winter 2015/2016 track is not frozen, all training and competitions are moved in Sochi\nStatistics.\nPhysical characteristics.\nThe track has 19 curves with an elevation difference of 105 meters. Because of the natural elevation difference of only 78 meters, the first 300 meters of the track are mounted on steel pillars up to 27 meters high. Starting from a tower like that of Sigulda, Latvia, the track has a maximum grade of 15%.\nTrack technical details.\nBecause of Russian environmental regulations prohibiting the outdoor usage of ammonia refrigeration systems, three cooling systems consisting of an ammonia-carbon dioxide cascade system was used."

        "title": "Vancouver Rowing Club",
        "text": "Vancouver Rowing Club (VRC) is a rowing club in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Originally formed in 1886 as the Vancouver Boating Club, the first clubhouse was built a year later. In 1890 one of the city's early athletic rivalries began when the Burrard Inlet Rowing Club built its headquarters just west of the Boating Club. Coal Harbour became the scene of many colourful rowing regattas. On April 1, 1899, the two rival clubs amalgamated to form the Vancouver Rowing Club. The present heritage building in Stanley Park was officially opened September 9, 1911.\nThe Vancouver Rowing Club membership is separated into two categories. Active Members are those who are associated with one of the sporting sections (Rowing, Rugby, Yachting or Field Hockey) of the club. Social Members are not directly associated with any of the sections and are not entitled to vote at club meetings.\nRowing.\nThe club offers rowing to a variety of groups, Juniors, Open, Masters, Adaptive, Novice, Recreational and Corporate. Popular \"Learn to Row\" courses on Coal Harbour play an important role in the development of rowing in Vancouver.\nThe Vancouver Rowing Club currently has a fleet of 4 eights, 10 four-person boats (quads &amp; fours), 11 two-person boats (primarily doubles but also pairs) and 5 singles.\n1954 Commonwealth Games and Frank Read.\nIn the West, the long established Vancouver Rowing Club found itself with the expertise and the facilities but without athletes, while the University of British Columbia was full of prime athletes but had no rowing traditions. When Vancouver was chosen to host the 5th British Empire and 1954 Commonwealth Games, conditions seemed right for the two to join forces. From this joint venture came the UBC/VRC crews and a new and unexpected force in rowing.\nLocal rowing supporters persuaded a hotel owner, Frank Read, to coach the new joint-venture crews. He was a gruff individual, known for refusing to mince his words or guard his comments. But he could coach and bring out the best in his athletes. While some people cringed at his public expressions, his athletes and the rowing community revered him.\nRead started on an arduous training program that covered hundreds of miles over the choppy driftwood-strewn waters of Coal Harbour. His intensive program, often leading as far as the Second Narrows Bridge in all kinds of weather, morning and evening, soon began to produce results.\nThe first to suffer the consequences of Read's training programs were the crews from the universities of Oregon and Washington. To their horror and surprise an unknown force had appeared on the West Coast and soon began to threaten and then demolish what hitherto had been an American preserve. When the crews met, if the UBC/VRC eight did not win, they still managed to give their rivals a painful and exhausting challenge to remember. By the opening of the Commonwealth Games, Vancouver's rowing community was quietly confident that the Canadian eight would surprise the world.\nThe 1954 Commonwealth Games teams arrived in mid-July, but attention was focused on track and field, where, it was rumoured, an Englishman named Roger Bannister was going to try to run the mile in four minutes or less. As far as the Canadian public knew, rowing would not be one of the exciting events for Canada. The \"Miracle Mile\" took place between Roger Bannister and John Landy at Empire Stadium, but the biggest upset of the games occurred when the Canadian eight, generally considered a crew of green kids, finished the 2000-metre course two and a half lengths ahead of Thames Rowing Club, the English crew. As the official history of the Games told it: \"The crowd was literally stunned by the fantastic victory and limp from excitement.\" For the first time ever, Canada had won a gold medal for eight in international competition beyond competition with the Americans.\nAfter the final race, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh met with the chairman of the VRC rowing committee, Nelles Stacey, and asked what the club owed its victory to. The answer came back: \"Frank Read, Frank Read, Frank Read.\" Intrigued, the Duke asked to meet Read and said, \"You must come to Henley.\" Read was not impressed, but the rest of the VRC committee took it as a royal command, and training and preparation followed until the crew left for England and the Grand Challenge Cup.\nThe 1950s had seen the reassurance of rowing in all countries, not the least of which was the then Soviet Union. There, sport had become a political tool in the Cold War, designed to show, through the excellence of its athletes, that the Communist way was superior to the way of the West. Their efforts had included rowing, and in 1954 they had appeared at the Henley Royal and gone home with all the titles. It was, to say the least, embarrassing, and no one seemed able to do anything about it. In 1955 the invasion by these seemingly \"professionals\" state-subsidised oarsmen happened again and left the guardians of amateur sport, the Henley stewards, shaking their heads in dismay. Still, some hope existed; after all, this unknown crew, which had just won the gold medal at the Commonwealth Games, was entered and though the Soviets were heavily favoured, miracles did occasionally happen.\nFor the Canadian rowing club, the experience was not without hazards; their shell was caught in the middle of a British dock strike. Canadian and British officials tried their best, but the unions were unyielding and the boat was not released until the dispute had been settled. Meanwhile, the shell suffered the ravages of weeks of weathering and was no longer rowable. UBC/VRC used a borrowed boat.\nUBC/VRC met Krasnoe Znamia, the Russian club, in the semifinals, where the Soviets quickly jumped into a three-quarter-length lead. At the quarter mile, the Russians dropped their rate to thirty-six, Vancouver to thirty-three. At the half-mile post the Russian lead was cut to six feet, and by the three-quarters mark, the Canadians were leading by six feet. When that position was announced, the vast crowd, expecting an easy Russian win, rose to their feet with a roar. To an ever-increasing win, the Vancouver crew rowed on to win by one and a half lengths. The Russians surrounded the victorious crew and marvelled at the style of \"coming off the feather at the last moment.\" They called it the Read stroke and wondered, as do all losing crews, whether this was the secret of the Canadians' success.\nNelles Stacey later stated that there were three records set that day at Henley: \"Never had there been such wild cheering by a Henley crowd; never had the staid Henley stewards been seen to throw their caps in the air; and never before, during a race, had all the bars been empty.\"\nIn the final the next day against the University of Pennsylvania, the crew lost by a third of a length in what was described as one of the finest races of the day. The loss was greeted as a victory: The House of Commons sent their congratulations, the mayor of Vancouver greeted them on arrival and gave them a motor parade through the city, followed by a formal address on the courthouse steps. Each member of the crew received a gold medal in recognition of their fine showing.\nAfter this, the next challenge was the 1956 Olympic Games in Melbourne, Australia. As a result of the strenuous training program, the crew rowed over 1,250 miles in three months. Neither gave any hint of what was to come. Virtually unnoticed training alongside the eight, and given little chance for success, was a coxless four stroked by Don Arnold, with Walter d'Hondt, Lorne Loomer and Archie MacKinon, coached by assistant coach John Warren. Frank Read remarked, \"They don't look like much, but they sure move the boat.\" Still, they were not remarkable enough to be included in the Canadian Olympic Association's plans for an eleven-man team. Only promising to underwrite the costs of the trip was the Vancouver Rowing Committee able to finally persuade the COA to let the four go.\nIn the first heat on Lake Ballarat, 50 miles north of Melbourne, the four beat Germany by six lengths, with Australia and Denmark behind. In the semifinals, the winning margin was an astounding ten lengths over France, Russia and Poland. The eight, meanwhile, finished second to Australia in the first heat and sent the Americans to the repêchage (a second chance to qualify) in a stunning upset.\nIn the finals, the four went out and beat the United States by five lengths, with Italy and France following. This team, one of several high-ranking crews of coach Frank Read, achieved probably the largest victory of margin of any crew in the modern games. The victory signaled a decisive shift of Canadian rowing excellence from its former traditional base of Toronto, Ontario to the Pacific Coast. It was Canada's first ever Olympic Gold Medal in rowing.\nHow close the eight came to winning another gold medal will always be a matter of speculation. The Americans won by half a length, but three of their oarsmen collapsed and two required medical attention. Truly, it was a performance in the highest traditions of the Olympic spirit. It was also a sweet vindication for the efforts to convince the COA.\nOn their return to a justifiably proud Vancouver, someone in the crowd asked Read, \"When did you think they were going to win?\" Read's reply, \"When they left the boathouse.\"\nRead coached again for the 1960 Olympic games, held in Rome. There, the race in the final for the eight became a battle between Canada and (at that time) West Germany, with a crew from the German rowing academy at Ratzeburg. With 200 metres to go, the Ratzeburg crew put on a magnificent spurt to win by four seconds. Canada's silver medal was the only medal Canada won at the Rome Olympics. It also marked the end of the Frank Read era.\n1964 Olympics.\nExpectations were not high for George Hungerford and Roger Jackson when they competed at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. In August, two months before the Olympics, Hungerford had come down with mononucleosis and was forced to give up his seat in the men's eights. Six weeks before Tokyo, Hungerford recovered enough to train and created a formidable partnership with Jackson. Because of the hasty manner in which the Hungerford/Jackson team had been assembled, they sat at the start line of the final with a borrowed boat. But the dark horses from Canada raced their scull to its second gold medal in eight years.\nNotable results.\n3rd Double Sculls 2x Los Angeles Olympics\nOther sports.\nRugby.\nThe VRC celebrated 100 years of rugby in 2008. In the autumn of 1908, VRC rowers seeking to keep fit during their off-season formed a rugby team, which has come to be known as \"Rowers\".\nInternational players from VRC Rugby have included: Ian Stuart, Richard Bice, Ian Cooper, Chris Mitchaluk, Ian Kennedy, Andy Wilson, Ruth Hellerud-Brown, Heather Wilson, Dawn Keim, Scott Harnden, Dawn Williams, Angie Hay, Mutya Macatumpag, Brad Martin, Rob Houston, Mike Webb and Stirling Richmond.\nThe scarlet and white hoops of Rowers have toured the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Philippines, France, Scotland, England and Wales, and each year Rowers host touring teams from all over the world, many of whom have decades of touring history with the Rowing Club.\nEach year at the club Captain's Dinner, the club honours not only past captains of victorious teams, but also acknowledges all those who have contributed, on the field or off, to the club's successes.\nIce hockey.\nIn the early 1900s, the Vancouver Rowing Club participated in senior men's ice hockey. Their team won the first ever Savage Cup which was awarded at the end of the 1912-13 season.\nField hockey.\nThe field hockey section of the rowing club is VRC Jokers Field Hockey Club, commonly known as just \"The Jokers\".\nThe Jokers were founded in 1964, and have a long history of touring. They currently have a number of men's and women's teams playing in various divisions of the Vancouver Men's Field Hockey League and Vancouver Women's Field Hockey Association. The Jokers are well known across Vancouver and the Lower Mainland for the social aspect of their club, and can be recognized by their distinct orange uniform.\nHistory.\nThe Jokers Field Hockey Club was founded in 1964 by Victor Warren, John Young, DK Fraser and Joost Wolsak.\nDuring the 1963/64 season, a few field hockey players at UBC realized that they wanted to continue to play together after their graduation. They checked out some of the local teams, but none of them really interested these gentlemen, who still wanted to play good, competitive hockey, but with an active social side to it. So, this group of “hockey pioneers” formed their own team. DK Fraser chose the name \"Jokers\" after concluding “Well, we’re a bunch of Jokers.\" John Young was a recently graduated architect, who used his skills to design the now famous Jokers logo. And the distinct orange colour for the uniforms came from Joost Wolsak (who is Dutch). The newly formed Jokers team entered into the British Columbia Lower Mainland Grass Hockey League in Division 1, circumventing the rule that new teams had to start in the second division by attending the league's AGM en masse and passing a motion for the exception (winning by a single vote).\nOver the next four years, Jokers added more teams (named Jokers Too, Jokers Also and Jokers Again).\nIn 1967, following the first mixed hockey tournament in Vancouver, the first women’s team joined the Jokers. The women's team was made up mostly of wives and spectators, was formed by Annemieke de Leeuw and Judy Peat, (née van Dishoek). The first coach of the women's team was Victor Warren.\nIn 1974, Victor Warren and then Jokers president Stuart Wilson worked with the VRC Rugby team to form a field hockey section of the Vancouver Rowing Club."

        "text": "The \"USA Today\" Super Bowl Ad Meter is an annual survey taken of television commercials by \"USA Today\" in a live poll during the telecast in the United States of the Super Bowl, the annual professional American football championship game of the National Football League. The survey, which started in 1989, uses a live response on a zero-to-ten scale (zero being the worst, ten the best) of focus groups based in McLean, Virginia, the newspaper headquarters and one (or more) site(s) around the country.\nBackground.\nThe Super Bowl became the must-see event for advertisers during the third quarter of the telecast of Super Bowl XVIII on CBS, when Apple Computer debuted a one-time-only advertisement for their Macintosh computer titled 1984, directed by Ridley Scott. As the Los Angeles Raiders routed the Washington Redskins, 38–9, the Apple commercial, not the game, was the most-talked about item around water coolers the very next day. Since then, major advertisers have used the game, paying as much as seven figures (averaging over US $5 million for one 30-second slot ), excluding production expenses) to showcase their work and generate buzz that many people tune into television's biggest event of the year just to watch the commercials, not the actual game. For those reasons, USA Today started the Ad Meter, a poll that gives live responses per second of each commercial. According to the newspaper, ads by rule are limited to those shown during the game - from opening kickoff to the end of the game, excluding those shown at halftime or local commercials - are officially qualified for consideration in the Ad Meter survey.\nA new element was added for 2012, as users of Facebook and those logging onto the \"USA Today\" website were involved in a second survey that lasted until February 7 at 6:00 pm US EST. The online element was added to the regular meter for 2013."

In all matches, losers were eliminated and received a final rank determined by their score in that round, with the exception of the semifinals.

He had been inducted into the PDC's Nine-Dart Club, achieving the feat at the German Darts Championship. The next month the Darts Regulation Authority released details of Clark's suspension as well as the suspension of Andy Jenkins. Clark was given a one-year ban with nine months suspended with the DRA reviewing his sentence every three months until January 2009. His ban was backdated to 10 January 2008, meaning that he returned to the circuit in April.\nIn January 2011, Clark declined the offer of a PDC Tour Card due to the fact that his family and business needed to come first and he could not fully commit enough of his time to darts."

In 1988, his family emigrated to Australia.\nPlaying career.\nHenderson began his professional career in England in 2001 with Super League side Salford City Reds. With limited opportunities there, Henderson moved to Northern Ford Premiership club Barrow Raiders for the 2002 and 2003 seasons. He captained the Raiders for the 2003 season. Soon after, Super League side Widnes Vikings snapped up Henderson for a trial period, in which he featured for them in the 2004 Sydney World Sevens tournament, and a friendly match against the Wests Tigers.

He spent only one season with Gateshead as the club were faced with financial problems and a shareholders dispute leading them into administration. This forced him to look elsewhere and he joined Championship winners Barrow Raiders in the 2009 close season on a two-year deal. Henderson left Barrow not long after and joined Sheffield Eagles towards the end of the 2010 season, due to the Barrow club failing to honour his contract.\nHenderson went on to play for just over four seasons with Sheffield, with 2014 being his final year.

In their first season, Henderson's team lost just once all season, winning the Conference League South beating Nottingham Outlaws in the grand final.\nLondon Broncos.\nOn 11 July 2014, London Broncos head coach Joe Grima appointed Henderson as his assistant beginning in November. On 2 March 2015, Joey Grima resigned after ten months in charge and just three games into the Championship season. Henderson took charge of the Championship side on an interim basis. After 2 games in charge with 1 win and 1 loss, he was appointed as the Broncos new permanent head coach.\nIn 2015, Henderson led the Broncos to 3rd place in the Championship Shield, eventually losing the Shield Final to Featherstone Rovers 34–6 at the Select Security Stadium in Widnes. In 2016, he guided the London Broncos to a 2nd-place finish in the Championship taking them into the Super 8's Qualifiers for the chance to gain promotion.

        "text": "The North Otago cricket team represents the North Otago region of New Zealand, with its headquarters in Oamaru. It competes in the Hawke Cup, which it won most recently in early 2021. Its parent body, the North Otago Cricket Association, was founded in 1899.\nHistory.\nIn 1864 the Oamaru Cricket Club was established. The club represented the region in matches against touring teams from Australia and England in the 1870s and 1880s. In 1892 the Waitaki Cricket Association was formed to regulate and manage cricket in the Ashburton, South Canterbury and North Otago areas, but it soon lapsed. North Otago's first match, against South Canterbury in 1896, raised interest in forming another cricket association in the area, and in 1899 the North Otago Cricket Association was formed.\nSince the establishment of the Association, North Otago have played regular matches against other provincial teams and occasional matches against touring teams. In 1927–28 Carl Zimmerman was the only New Zealander to score a century against the touring Australian team, when he scored 117 not out for North Otago. \nNorth Otago began competing in the Hawke Cup in 1958–59. They won it for the first time in March 2010 when they beat Manawatu by 159 runs, with centuries to Duncan Drew and Darren Broom. Their next victory was in February 2016, when they beat Buller by 133 runs, Francois Mostert taking 13 wickets for 53. This match was notable in that Buller and North Otago were the two Hawke Cup teams with the smallest population bases. North Otago's third victory was over Nelson by 250 runs in February 2021.\nNorth Otago players are eligible to represent Otago in the Plunket Shield. Of those who have done so, some have also played for New Zealand, including John Reid and David Sewell.\nSenior teams.\nThe Borton Cup has been awarded since 1920 to the winners of the North Otago senior competition. Seven clubs currently compete:"

        "title": "Lillehammer Olympic Bobsleigh and Luge Track",
        "text": "Lillehammer Olympic Bobsleigh and Luge Track () is a bobsleigh, luge and skeleton track located at Hunderfossen in Lillehammer, Norway, north of the town center of Lillehammer. It was completed in 1992 for the 1994 Winter Olympics, where it hosted the bobsleigh events and luge events. It has since also hosted the FIBT World Championships 1995 in skeleton and the FIL World Luge Championships 1995, and hosted 2016 Winter Youth Olympics.\nOriginal plans called for the track to be located at Fåberg. Later it was proposed moved to Kanthaugen in the town center and then Holmenkollen in Oslo, before Hunderfossen was decided upon. The track is , giving a competition length of for bobsleigh and men's singles luge, and for other luge competitions. The bobsleigh course has a vertical drop of , giving an 8.5 percent average grade. The track has been part of the proposed Oslo 2018 and 2022 Winter Olympics bids.\nHistory.\nPrior to the Lillehammer Olympics, there was no bobsleigh and luge track in Norway. During the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo, Korketrekkeren had been built as a temporary venue, but it was made of snow and was not reused after the Olympics. In its bid for the 1994 Winter Olympics, Lillehammer had proposed placing the bobsleigh and luge track next to Balbergbakken in Fåberg. By May 1989, plans for most of the venues were being reshuffled and the track was then proposed located at Kanthaugen as part of an Olympic Park at Stampesletta. The Kanthaugen proposal was estimated to cost NOK 231 million.\nLillehammer Municipal Council, Oppland County Council and the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage rejected the location because of the environmental impact. These institutions instead proposed that the track be built at Huseskogen at Hunderfossen. The Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee initially disapproved of the location and in 1990 started looking at the possibility of constructing the track at Holmenkollen in Oslo. Two routes were considered, one in the same route as Korketrekkeren and one which would run from Gratishaugen at Holmenkollbakken to Midtstuen. Internationally there was support from the International Bobsleigh &amp; Skeleton Federation and the International Luge Federation to build Norway's track in the capital. Concerns about the environmental impact of a Hunderfossen location were raised, particularly regarding visual pollution. However, Hunderfossen was confirmed along with a grant issued by the Parliament of Norway on 24 August 1990.\nThe designers of the tracks at Altenberg and Oberhof, East Germany, the Olympic tracks in La Plagne, France, and Calgary, Canada, were consulted during planning. Five companies bid for the concrete construction work, which was awarded to a joint venture between Aker Entreprenør and Veidekke for NOK 45 million. Also the construction of the buildings was awarded to the same group. The track was the first of the Olympic venues for the 1994 games for which construction started. After construction started, Minister of Culture Åse Kleveland (Labour Party) suggested in March 1991, in an attempt to reduce costs, that the 1994 Olympic bobsleigh and luge events be held at La Plagne, the site of the events for the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville. The French authorities were positive, given that Norway pay for part of the construction costs, but the idea was rejected by LOOC-president Gerhard Heiberg. Also fellow party members reacted, who emphasized that NOK 30 million had already been used on blasting the track route.\nConstruction was undertaken by spraying of shotcrete intertwined with of reinforcement bars. It is the first track in the world to build the cooling pipes into an underground culvert. It consists of 31 reinforced concrete sections. The concrete work was completed on 31 October 1991. Representatives for the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature stated that they were satisfied with the result. It is the only artificially frozen bobsleigh and luge track in the Nordic Countries. The venue was completed on 1 October 1992 and cost NOK 201 million. After the Olympics, the ownership of the venue was transferred to Lillehammer Olympiapark, owned by Lillehammer Municipality.\nSpecifications.\nThe track is long, including braking distance. The competitive length—excluding braking distance—for bobsleigh, skeleton and luge men's singles it is long and for luge men's doubles and women's singles it is long. The track has 16 turns and contains 24 photocells for timekeeping. The track has a vertical drop of for the entire course, with an average 8 percent and maximum 15 percent grade. The start is located at above mean sea level. It allows for a maximum speed of . The spectator capacity is 10,000.\nThe refrigeration system contains of ammonia circulating in 94 sections with a total length of of pipe. This allows a capacity of 3,100 kilowatts of (10.6 million British thermal units or 880 short tons of refrigeration) cooling, which allows the track to be iced in outdoor temperatures up to . The facility produces 4.5 gigawatt hours per year of district heating, gaining the nickname \"Norway's largest refrigerator\".\nThe venue is operated by Lillehammer Olympiapark, which also operates the four other Olympic venues within Lillehammer, Lysgårdsbakken, Birkebeineren Ski Stadium, Håkons Hall and Kanthaugen Freestyle Arena. The track is staffed with seven employees, in addition to up to 20 more people during large events. The venue both serves local sports clubs and more than 20 nations have sledding sports training in Lillehammer. In addition the track serves up to 10,000 tourists per year; during summer rides are provided on wheeled bobsleighs. The track is operated eleven months per year. As of 2004, the venue received subsidies of between NOK 1.5 to 2.0 million per year.\nThe following table shows the physical statistics for the track for the various sports. It contains the competition length (start to finish, excluding braking length), the number of turns, the vertical drop and the average grade.\nEvents.\nBobsleigh at the 1994 Winter Olympics.\nBoth two-man and four-man were competed during the 1994 Winter Olympics. Both were contested in four heats over two days: two-man took place on 19 and 20 February, while four-man took place on 26 and 27 February.\nLuge at the 1994 Winter Olympics.\nLuge was contested in three events at the 1994 Winter Olympics. Singles was contested over four heats in two days, while doubles was contested in two heats on one day. Men's singles took place on 13 and 14 February, women's singles took place on 15 and 16 February, and men's doubles took place on 18 February.\nFIBT World Championships 1995.\nThe FIBT World Championships 1995 was split between Altenburg and Lillehammer, with bobsleigh taking place in Altenburg and skeleton in Lillehammer. The skeleton events took place on 4 and 5 March.\nFIL World Luge Championships 1995.\nThe FIL World Luge Championships 1995 was competed between 30 nations in four events. It was the second to take place in Norway, after the inaugural 1955 edition in Oslo.\nFuture.\nLillehammer is scheduled to host the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics, which is scheduled to take place between 12 February and 21 February. Lillehammer Olympic Bobsleigh and Luge Track is scheduled to host the bobsleigh, luge and skeleton events.\nThree Norwegian cities, Tromsø, Oslo and Trondheim, announced intentions to bid for the 2018 Winter Olympics. Oslo planned a joint bid with Lillehammer and planned to use the sliding center along with the Alpine skiing hills of Hafjell and Kvitfjell in their bid. Tromsø originally planned to build their own track, but later in the bidding process also Tromsø announced that they intended to bid using the Lillehammer track, despite a distance of between Tromsø and Lillehammer. This was after the International Olympic Committee signaled that they wanted more moderation in venue construction costs and that they would prefer bid which used existing venues, even if it increased distances. This was backed by the International Luge Federation and the International Bobsleigh &amp; Skeleton Federation, who both did not want additional tracks built in the world because of the difficulties funding their operation. The 2018 proposals were shelved, but a renewed Oslo bid process for the 2022 Olympics also calls for the use of Lillehammer.\nTrack records.\nThe following is an incomplete list of track records; while including luge and women's skeleton, it excludes bobsleigh and men's skeleton. The list contains both start times and track times, as well, as the athlete and their nationality, and the date of the record."

        "title": "American Football League (1940)",
        "text": "The American Football League, also known retrospectively as the AFL III to distinguish it from earlier organizations of that name, was a professional American football league that operated from 1940 to 1941. It was created when three teams, the original Cincinnati Bengals, the Columbus Bullies, and the Milwaukee Chiefs, were lured away from the minor-league American Professional Football Association and joined three new franchises in Boston, Buffalo, and New York City in a new league. It competed against the National Football League (NFL), the oldest existing professional football league, which had been established in 1920 and reorganized in 1922.\nThe organization was the third major league to bear the name American Football League. Its establishment resulted in the dissolution of the American Professional Football Association, which had just announced its intentions to compete with the NFL as a major league organization. In 1941, the American Football League became the first football league to play a double round robin schedule (five home games and five away games). However, it folded after the end of the 1941 season.\nOrigin.\nAlthough the third American Football League was not directly connected to any previous American football leagues of the same name, its formation was at the cost of an already-existing minor football league of the same name.\nIn the spring of 1940, the former American Professional Football Association announced intentions of turning itself into a major league with the addition of a Milwaukee team for the upcoming season, over the protests of the Green Bay Packers. \nAs the teams prepared for the upcoming season, the announcement of a rival major league resulted in the collapse of this edition of the American Football League. On July 14, 1940, a press conference introduced a new American Football League - not a continuation of the former minor league, but a new one with franchises in New York, Boston, and Buffalo. Bill Edwards, the president of the first AFL of 1926, was slated to be both the president of the new league and co-owner of the New York Yankees franchise, while Joseph Carr Jr., the son of recently deceased NFL president and Columbus Panhandles founder Joe Carr, was touted as a potential backer of the Columbus franchise.\nThe group of businessmen based on the American East Coast behind the formation of the new league had resorted to a trick done by the first two AFLs: they raided the established minor league by enticing APFA members Cincinnati, Columbus, and the new Milwaukee team to jump to their circuit. \nThe move fractured the APFA as two of its members decided not to field teams for 1940, while one the Los Angeles Bulldogs had already resigned from the league, and there were only three teams left with only two months to go before the start of the new season. After the Kenosha Cardinals and St. Louis Gunners applied to join the new league (and were subsequently rejected), the APFA went out of business.\nAfter a 30-hour-long meeting of the owners (and other representatives) of the six invited teams in Buffalo's Hotel Lafayette, the bylaws and officials of the new league were determined. Each team was scheduled to play a double round robin schedule (five home games, five away games), with games on either Sunday or Wednesday to reduce the likelihood of conflicts with baseball teams sharing the stadium in five of the six AFL cities (all except Buffalo). The agreement was signed by the team owners on October 5, 1940.\nWhile Bill Edwards did not take over the league as previously announced (that job eventually went to former Ohio State University publicity director William D. Griffith), the 1940 season began with six teams owned by people who were, for the most part, in better financial standing than their NFL counterparts. In the NFL, many of the owners had their franchise as their primary investment and source of income, while the AFL of 1940 had most of the owners with money invested in many other fields, such as local newspapers.\nTeams.\nBoston Bears. Disbanded in 1941, before the beginning of the second AFL season.\nBuffalo Indians. Became the Buffalo Tigers for the 1941 season after a change in ownership.\nCincinnati Bengals. Previously a member of the second AFL, and the American Professional Football Association, the \"original Bengals\" joined the third AFL with traditional rival Columbus Bullies.\nColumbus Bullies. Former APFA member which won the AFL championship both years the league was in existence. Quarterback Jay Arnold, formerly of the Philadelphia Eagles, led the team in 1940; when Arnold returned to the Eagles in 1941, John LeBay took over the signal calling role.\nMilwaukee Chiefs. Former APFA member joined the AFL without being in an official APFA contest.\nNew York Yankees. The third major league professional football team with the name, it became the New York Americans in 1941 after a change of ownership.\nLeague standings and All-League teams.\nFinal 1940 standings.\n1940 All-League Team.\nSherman Barnes, Milwaukee (end)&lt;br&gt;\nEd Karp, Buffalo (tackle)&lt;br&gt;\nJim Karcher, Columbus (guard)&lt;br&gt;\nJoe Alexus, Columbus (center)&lt;br&gt;\nAlex Drobnitch, Buffalo (guard)&lt;br&gt;\nBob Eckl, Milwaukee (tackle)&lt;br&gt;\nHarlan Gustafson, New York (end)&lt;br&gt;\nAndy Karpuls, Boston (quarterback)&lt;br&gt;\nBill Hutchinson, New York (halfback)&lt;br&gt;\nNelson Peterson, Columbus (halfback)&lt;br&gt;\nAl Novakofski, Milwaukee (fullback)\nFinal 1941 standings.\nEncouraged by the success of the New York and Columbus franchises, Detroit, Baltimore, and Philadelphia applied to join the league for the 1941 season. While the Detroit application was accepted for play in 1942, the latter two were turned down by a league that was not interested in further expansion.\nPromoter Douglas Grant Hertz purchased the New York Yankees, changed their name to the New York Americans, and then announced (in August) the team's withdrawal from the league. The league refused to acknowledge the \"withdrawal.\" Boston folded before the start of the 1941 season. Buffalo changed the team name upon new ownership assuming control of the team. New York Americans president William B. Cox became the new AFL league president in 1941.\n1941 All-League Team.\nEarl Ohlgren, Milwaukee (end)&lt;br&gt;\nAlec Shellogg, Buffalo (tackle)&lt;br&gt;\nTed Livinston, Columbus (guard)&lt;br&gt;\nPaul Humphrey, Milwaukee (center)&lt;br&gt;\nTex Akin, Milwaukee (guard)&lt;br&gt;\nBob Eckl, Milwaukee (tackle)&lt;br&gt;\nJoe Kruse, Cincinnati (end)&lt;br&gt;\nBob Davis, Columbus (quarterback)&lt;br&gt;\nCharlie Armstrong, New York (halfback)&lt;br&gt;\nBill McGannon, Cincinnati (halfback)&lt;br&gt;\nJohn Kimbrough, New York (fullback)\nColumbus was league champion again in 1941, with a final record of 5-1-2.\nDemise of the third major league AFL.\nAlthough the AFL lost the Boston Bears franchise prior to the beginning of the 1941 season, its owners were optimistic about the league's long-term future. Although the league's average attendance was less than that of the more-established NFL, the AFL seemed to be on as firm a financial footing as the older league. By the end of the 1941 season, a new franchise was awarded to Detroit for the 1942 season. The league was the first major football league to complete a double round robin schedule, in which each team played each other twice.\nAll the plans for 1942 came to a sudden stop upon the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the start of World War II on December 7, 1941. During the winter of 1941–42, numerous players from both leagues were drafted into the U.S. military. So many players went overseas that several AFL and NFL teams were left with barely enough players to field viable teams. It soon became apparent to the AFL owners that the success of the league was very much in question.\nOn September 2, 1942, AFL president William D. Cox announced the league would suspend operations for the war's duration.\nThe league did not return. The NFL was without a competitor until the formation of the All-America Football Conference in 1946, one year after the end of World War II."

        "title": "American Football League (1936)",
        "text": "The American Football League (AFL) was a professional American football league that operated in 1936 and 1937. The AFL operated in direct competition with the more established National Football League (NFL) throughout its existence. While the American media generally ignored its operation (often relegating game coverage to \"page filler\" status), this second AFL was the first \"home\" of the Cleveland Rams, which joined the National Football League after one year in the AFL.\nIn 1937, the Los Angeles Bulldogs, the first professional football team to play its home games on the West Coast, also became the first professional football team to win a league championship with a perfect record (no losses, no ties) – 11 years before the Cleveland Browns (AAFC) and 35 years before the Miami Dolphins (NFL) accomplished the same feat.\nOrigin.\nThe brainchild of former New York Giants personnel director Harry March, plans for the formation of the second American Football League were announced on November 12, 1935. Fifteen cities bid for charter franchises for the new league, and on April 11, 1936, eight (Boston, Cleveland, Jersey City, New York, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Providence, and Syracuse) were awarded.\nWithin a few months, Jersey City, Providence, and Philadelphia pulled out and Rochester was granted a franchise. Two weeks later, the newest franchise was transferred to Brooklyn even though there was no stadium available at the time.\nThe league was envisioned to be a \"players league\", with veteran players involved in the management of the participating teams. March served as the AFL's president until his resignation in October. He was succeeded by James Bush, president of the New York Yankees AFL franchise.\nMost of the new AFL franchises were built on the raiding of nearby NFL franchises in the league's first season. While first-season AFL champion Boston did not plunder the roster of the struggling Redskins team, the New York Yankees and Pittsburgh Americans had no such qualms with their crosstown rivals, the Giants and the Pirates. Similarly the Cleveland Rams signed their head coach, Damon Wetzel, from the backfield of the Chicago Bears.\nTeams.\nBoston Shamrocks. The offensive powerhouse of the AFL in the 1936 season, the George Kenneally-led Shamrocks were in a three-way battle with Cleveland and New York for the league championship when Boston beat the other two on consecutive weeks at the end of the season. The following year, the Shamrocks were beset with player defections and struggled to a 2–7 record. Playing its home games at Fenway Park and Braves Field, the team folded along with the league at the end of the 1937 season.\nBrooklyn Tigers. Awarded a franchise in 1936 although no home field was available in Brooklyn, the Tigers had a short, troubled existence. In mid-November, the team moved to Rochester (changing its name to the Rochester Tigers) and played in Red Wing Stadium despite the failure of another AFL team based in that city mere weeks before. The team limped to the end of the 1937 season before fading into oblivion. The Tigers were coached by Mike Palm, who owned the team along with Harry Newman.\nCleveland Rams. Owned by Homer Marshman and playing its home games in Cleveland Municipal Stadium, the Rams competed in the AFL for only one season (finishing second with a 5–2–2 record) with the league's stingiest defense and one of the league's two most potent offenses (along with Boston). When the NFL announced that it was willing to expand, Marshman applied for a franchise in the more-established league (along with representatives from Houston and Los Angeles). As a result, the Rams left the AFL for 1937 season, to be replaced by the people from Los Angeles whose NFL application was turned down. The 1936 Rams had Sid Gillman as a rookie end in his only season as an active professional player.\nNew York Yankees. The second New York Yankees football team for an American Football League was coached by Jack McBride and featured the talents of star back Ken Strong. Team president James Bush doubled as league president in the latter half of the 1936 season. Like the defending league champion Boston Shamrocks, the 1937 Yankees team was plagued by player defections to the NFL. Unlike the other New York Yankees football teams, the Yankees of AFL II had \"two\" home stadia: Yankee Stadium and Triborough Stadium on Randall's Island.\nPittsburgh Americans. While the Americans were holding their own on the football field in 1936, they lagged the rest of the league in attendance (2500 average attendance for home games in Forbes Field); although the Americans survived the first season as a middle-of-the-pack AFL team, the team was folded after the third game in 1937. The Americans were not without stars: they signed former Pirates Ben Smith and Loran Ribble.\nSyracuse Braves. The existence of the Braves was doomed from lack of fan support while losing every game at Municipal Stadium (Don Irwin and end Red Badgro were the head coaches). The team moved to Rochester at midseason and called itself the Rochester Braves for a few weeks before calling it quits. At the lone home game in Red Wing Stadium (November 1, 1936) the second half was delayed 40 minutes by Braves players demanding back pay. The game was finished; the franchise folded immediately afterward. Soon afterwards, another AFL team (Brooklyn) followed the Braves to Rochester in an effort to survive the 1936 season.\nCincinnati Bengals. Not related to the current NFL franchise, the Bengals joined the AFL for the 1937 season. Playing at Crosley Field, the team was a steady draw despite the team having a losing record. When the league folded at the end of the year, the Bengals continued as an independent team for 1938, joined the short-lived minor American Professional Football Association for 1939, and became a charter member of the third AFL in 1940. Hal Pennington was the team's originator; he was also the first head coach and general manager of the Bengals.\nLos Angeles Bulldogs. While an independent team, the Bulldogs defeated the Philadelphia Eagles in 1936. After being turned down for the NFL for the 1937 season, the Bulldogs joined the AFL and became the first professional football team to play its home games on the West Coast. Averaging 14,000 in attendance for its home games in Gilmore Stadium, the Bulldogs were drawing twice as many fans per game as the rest of the league. Los Angeles did not lose or tie a game in its one season with the AFL, the first professional football team to win its league title with a perfect record. When the league folded at the end of the season, the Gus Henderson-led Bulldogs continued on as an independent team before joining the minor league American Professional Football Association in 1939 and becoming a charter member of the Pacific Coast Professional Football League the following year.\nAll-League selections.\nThere was no All-League team named for the 1936 season.\n1937.\nBill Moore, Los Angeles (end) &lt;br&gt;\nBill Steinkemper, Cincinnati (tackle) &lt;br&gt;\nPete Mehringer, Los Angeles (guard) &lt;br&gt;\nLee Mulleneaux, Cincinnati (center) &lt;br&gt;\nAlex Drobnitch, New York (guard) &lt;br&gt;\nHarry Field, Los Angeles (tackle) &lt;br&gt;\nRed Fleming, Boston (end)&lt;br&gt;\nHarry Newman, Los Angeles (quarterback)&lt;br&gt;\nDon Geyer, Cincinnati (halfback)&lt;br&gt;\nAl Nichelini, Los Angeles (halfback)&lt;br&gt;\nGordon Gore, Los Angeles (fullback)\nDemise of the second AFL.\nWhile league champion contenders Boston, Cleveland, and the Yankees were consistent draws in 1936 (Boston nearly outdrawing the NFL rival Redskins, which moved to Washington the following year), the other four franchises presented problems for the AFL. Pittsburgh drew only 2500 customers per home game, Syracuse drew less than 5000 before moving to Rochester (and folding after one game), and Brooklyn didn't have a home until the team followed the Braves to Rochester. With the departure of two franchises (the Braves and the Rams), it was clear that change was in order for the AFL.\nIn the beginning of 1937, the league inaugurated its third president in less than 14 months, J. J. Schafer, added Jack Dempsey and Bing Crosby to its board, and proceeded to restock its franchise line-up with a franchise in a city in which an NFL franchise failed a mere three years earlier (Cincinnati) and a touring team based in Los Angeles whose application to join the more established league was turned down in favor of the Rams.\nUnlike the NFL, AFL teams tended to have local interest only. Out-of-town newspapers rarely covered the league's activities, and when they did, the coverage was usually a bare-bones mention of the scores inserted as page filler.\nThree weeks into the 1937 season, the poorly-drawing Pittsburgh Americans gave up the ghost while the other eastern teams were suffering the results of player raids by NFL teams (defending champion Boston was virtually gutted, leaving it in no shape to repeat its success).\nThe entry of the Los Angeles Bulldogs into the league also helped lead to the league's demise. The new team simply overwhelmed the rest of the AFL as the only team with a winning record. The Bulldogs played all of its away games in the first half of the season and then finished the demolition as they stayed home for the second half. While the Bulldogs had attendance figures comparable to that of the 1936 Shamrocks and Yankees (about 14,000 per home game), the former eastern powers lost their draw. Shamrocks owner Bill Scully noted that the team lost $37,000 in 1937; the rest of the league (excluding Los Angeles) fared worse.\nWith the optimism that began the 1937 season gone, the second American Football League closed up shop at the end of the season.\nAfter the second AFL.\nWhile the existence of the second American Football League was relatively brief, its influence in American sports was actually more than realized at that time. It introduced major league football to the West Coast, which had a team based in Los Angeles and played its games there (whereas the Los Angeles Buccaneers, a prior NFL team, was a traveling team based in Chicago). \nThe success of the Boston Shamrocks, particularly at the gate, was also a factor in George Preston Marshall moving his Boston Redskins to Washington. The AFL was also the first \"home league\" of the Cleveland Rams, which exist today as the Los Angeles Rams. \nThe Los Angeles Bulldogs returned to the independent circuit in 1938, as did the Cincinnati Bengals, which joined the fledgling minor league, the American Professional Football Association, in 1939 and became a charter member of the third AFL in 1940. The Bulldogs also joined the APFA for 1939 before becoming a charter member of the Pacific Coast Professional Football League in 1940. \nIn 1968, 27 years after the collapse of the third AFL, the Bengals name would be revived by Paul Brown for his Cincinnati expansion franchise in the fourth AFL, a team that continues to play in the NFL."

        "text": "Austin Jarriel Jackson (born February 1, 1987) is an American former professional baseball center fielder. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Detroit Tigers, Seattle Mariners, Chicago Cubs, Chicago White Sox, Cleveland Indians, San Francisco Giants and New York Mets. Prior to playing professionally, he attended Billy Ryan High School.\nThe New York Yankees selected Jackson in the 2005 MLB draft and traded him to the Tigers at the end of the 2009 season, where he made his MLB debut in 2010. The next two seasons, he made the postseason on both occasions with the Tigers. During those seasons, he led the American League in hitting triples, and won the Fielding Bible Award for center field in 2011.\nEarly years.\nIn 1999, \"Baseball America\" named Jackson the best 12-year-old baseball player in the nation, and the best 15-year-old baseball player three years later.\nJackson attended Billy Ryan High School in Denton, Texas.\nIn basketball, he was listed as the #10-ranked high school point guard in the country by Athlon Sports after he averaged 22.5 points, five rebounds and three assists per game his junior year in high school. In baseball, he hit .423 with five homers and 34 RBI for his class AAAA Texas State runner-up baseball team and was rated the No. 14 draft prospect among high school players in the nation by \"Baseball America\".\nProfessional career.\nNew York Yankees.\nThough Jackson committed to play both baseball and basketball for Georgia Tech, the New York Yankees drafted him in the eighth round (259th overall) in the 2005 Major League Baseball draft. To convince him to sign instead of attending Georgia Tech, the Yankees offered Jackson $800,000, a record signing bonus for an eighth round pick.\nFrom 2005 to 2009 Jackson rose up the Yankees organization and after a slow start, he became a top prospect for the Yankees. For the 2009 season he was the Yankees top prospect according to \"Baseball America\".\nAfter the 2009 season, Jackson was added to the 40-man roster to protect him from the Rule 5 draft.\nDetroit Tigers.\nOn December 9, 2009, Jackson was traded to the Detroit Tigers as part of a three-team trade that brought Curtis Granderson to the Yankees. Jackson entered the 2010 season as the Tigers third-best prospect, according to \"Baseball America\".\nJackson made his major league debut on April 5, 2010, against the Kansas City Royals, going one for five. He hit his first major league home run on April 25, 2010, off of Colby Lewis of the Texas Rangers. Through the first month of the season Jackson led the majors in hits with 36, and was named the AL Rookie of the Month. On June 2, 2010, against the Cleveland Indians, Jackson made a difficult over-the-shoulder running catch in the ninth inning of Armando Galarraga's near-perfect game. The perfect game eventually ended with two outs in the ninth after an incorrect call by umpire Jim Joyce. He was named an outfielder on \"Baseball America\"'s 2010 All-Rookie Team. He was also named an outfielder on the 2010 Topps Major League Rookie All-Star Team.\nOn November 15, 2010, Jackson came in second in the 2010 American League Rookie of the Year voting, behind Rangers closer Neftalí Feliz. Jackson finished his rookie season by playing 151 games with a .293 batting average, 10 triples, 4 home runs, 41 RBI, and an AL-leading 170 strikeouts.\nJackson was named the American League Player of the Week for the week of August 29–September 4, 2011. In receiving the award for the first time, Jackson had a .529 batting average (18 for 34) during the week with three doubles, three triples, two home runs, five runs batted in, and 13 runs scored. The Tigers went 5–2 that week to increase their lead in the American League Central Division. He won a Fielding Bible Award in 2011 as the best fielding center fielder in MLB. Jackson played 153 games in 2011 batting .249 with 10 home runs, 45 RBI, an AL-leading 11 triples, and 181 strikeouts. In Game 6 of the 2011 ALCS, Jackson hit his first career postseason home run. The Tigers would however lose the game and the series to the Texas Rangers.\nOn April 5, 2012, Jackson was the leadoff hitter and played center field on Opening Day for the Tigers, where he went 3–5 with an RBI and a run. Jackson hit a walk-off, bases-loaded single down the third base line to give the Tigers the win over the Red Sox, 3–2. Jackson played 137 games in 2012, batting .300 with 16 home runs, 66 RBI, and an AL-leading 10 triples. Jackson went to the postseason with the Tigers for a second straight season, and he hit a home run in the series-clinching Game 4 against the New York Yankees in the ALCS. But the Tigers eventually got swept in 4 games by the San Francisco Giants in the World Series.\nInjuries limited Jackson to 129 games in 2013. Serving as the Tigers leadoff hitter again, he batted .272 with 12 home runs, 49 RBIs, and a career-low 8 stolen bases. On January 17, 2014, Jackson and the Tigers avoided arbitration by agreeing to a one-year deal for the 2014 season worth $6 million.\nSeattle Mariners.\nOn July 31, 2014, the Tigers traded Jackson to the Seattle Mariners in a three-team deal that sent Drew Smyly, Nick Franklin and Willy Adames to the Tampa Bay Rays, and David Price to the Detroit Tigers.\nOn May 3, 2015, Jackson sprained his ankle in a game against the Houston Astros, and was placed on the 15-day disabled list the following day.\nChicago Cubs.\nOn August 31, 2015, the Mariners traded Jackson to the Chicago Cubs for a player to be named later and an international signing bonus slot.\nJackson ended the 2015 season having played 136 games, stealing 17 bases with a .696 OPS.\nChicago White Sox.\nOn March 6, 2016, Jackson signed a one-year, $5 million deal with the Chicago White Sox. On August 25, White Sox GM Rick Hahn told the media that Jackson would miss the rest of the season after he had been out since June 10. He had surgery to repair a medial meniscus tear in his left knee. Over 54 games, he tallied a .254 batting average, 18 RBI, 12 doubles, and 24 runs scored.\nCleveland Indians.\nJackson signed a minor league contract with the Cleveland Indians on January 25, 2017. The Indians purchased Jackson's contract on March 27, 2017. On August 1, 2017, Jackson robbed Hanley Ramirez of a home run by making a spectacular catch over the right center field wall. He traveled approximately 97 feet and flipped over the wall into the Red Sox bullpen. This was declared by broadcasters and MLB as the \"play of the year\" for 2017.\nSan Francisco Giants.\nOn January 22, 2018, Jackson signed a two-year deal with the San Francisco Giants worth $6 million over two years.\nTexas Rangers.\nOn July 8, 2018, Jackson was traded to the Texas Rangers along with pitcher Cory Gearrin and minor league pitcher Jason Bahr, in exchange for a player to be named later or cash considerations. Three days later, he was designated for assignment by the Rangers. The Rangers released Jackson on July 14.\nNew York Mets.\nOn July 27, Jackson signed with the New York Mets, as depth in center field, with Juan Lagares sidelined for the remainder of the season due to a toe injury and Yoenis Cespedes out for the remainder of the season to undergo multiple surgeries to eliminate calcification and bone spurs in both heels. He hit a walk-off on David Wright's final career game. He elected free agency on October 29, 2018.\nPost-Career.\nIn April 2020, Jackson expressed interest in an MLB return. As of September 2021, he had not signed with an MLB team.\nStarting on July 7, 2021, Jackson announced the three-game series between the Detroit Tigers and Texas Rangers game alongside Dan Dickerson on the Detroit Tigers Radio Network."

        "title": "Trobriand cricket",
        "text": "Trobriand cricket refers to a unique version of the bat-and-ball sport cricket played by the Trobriand Islanders. They were first exposed to the game by Christian missionaries, who thought the game would discourage war among the natives. However, the game was quickly adapted to Trobriand culture by expanding the number of players, adding dances and chanting, and modifying the bats and balls. Since war between groups on the island was banned, cricket began to incorporate many of the traditional practices associated with war for the Trobriand people. The game also reflects the objects of powers introduced to the islands by its British colonizers and American troops during World War II.\nHistorical background.\nCricket was introduced to the Trobriand Islands in 1903 by the British Methodist missionary William Gillmore, who hoped to reduce tribal rivalry and fighting. The modern-day version is very different from the game introduced by Gillmore, as new rules and traditions have been integrated.\nAnthropological analysis.\nIn the Trobriand Islands, \"kayasa\" is a form of obligatory, competitive activity done traditionally in the form of ritual warfare. Warfare with spears was replaced by cricket, as a peaceful way of continuing \"kayasa\".\nTrobriand cricket has been altered such that the home team is always the winner. There are no restrictions on the number of players on a team; thus, a team can have as many as 40 or 50 players.\nBefore the match, the ball and bats are given to a local spiritual leader who blesses the equipment for good luck. Also, this leader works on ensuring good weather. Before the match, each team practices chants and dances to be performed at various times throughout the game. Each out is followed by a celebratory dance, choreographed by the opposing team. These dances often have special meaning, commenting on the prowess of the team, their superior skills, or mocking the other team. These dances may also have sexual innuendos and erotic themes.\nBowling is done underarm (as in softball), rather than overarm as in international cricket. This change came about because underhanded-bowled balls are less painful if they contact with a player.\nThere are ritual entrance and exit dances. One team had a mascot dressed as a tourist (dressed in bright colors, stopping in front of the performances to get a “close-up” view with his pretend binoculars). At the end of the match, there is an exchange of food, with the home team putting on the feast.\nOther Trobriand changes to cricket include the following:\nToday, cricket holds special meaning for the local population of the Trobriands. It has evolved to take on warlike aspects. For example, players’ bodies are decorated in bright colors and designs, similar to those displayed by warriors. The field entry and exit dances take on a warlike formation.\nTrobriand cricket is an example of syncretism. Usually, syncretic cultures or traditions take elements from both the existing, “traditional” culture and elements from “outsiders” such as colonists, occupiers, or missionaries.\nIn popular culture.\nTrobriand cricket was featured in an episode of the 2007 BBC series \"Last Man Standing\".\nIn the song \"Steak n' Sabre\", written by Frank Black and recorded by Frank Black and the Catholics, and which Black has stated is about alternate realities, he references \"Trobriander\" cricket: \"Like Trobrianders / Don't you understand that's a different kind of world.\""

Listed at 5' 8\", 155 lb., Morgan batted and threw right-handed. He was born in Baltimore, Maryland.\nDuring the dead-ball era, second baseman Ray Morgan was part of a stellar double play combo along with shortstop George McBride for the Washington Senators in a span of eight years.\nBasically a slap-hitter, Morgan compiled a .254 batting average and a .348 on-base percentage in 741 career games. His most productive season came in 1913, when he posted career-highs in average (.272), hits (131), runs (58), RBI (57) and walks (68), while turning 61 double plays in 134 games.\nFrom 1913 to 1914 Morgan ranked fourth in the American League for the most assists by a second baseman, while collecting a .398 OBP in 1916, good for a fourth place behind Tris Speaker (.470), Ty Cobb (.452) and Eddie Collins (.405).\nFollowing his major league stint Morgan finished his career with the Baltimore Orioles of the International League. He hit a .293 average in 168 Minor league games in parts of three seasons (1910-'11, 1920).\nMorgan died in Baltimore, Maryland at the age of 50, after complications related to pneumonia and heart failure.\nBatting statistics \nErnie Shore's former perfect game.\nMorgan is forever linked with Babe Ruth. During the 1917 season, Ruth started the first game of a doubleheader on June 23 for the Boston Red Sox against the Senators at Fenway Park. Morgan, leading off for the Senators, was awarded a walk after home plate umpire Brick Owens called the first four pitches all balls. After an altercation with Owens, Ruth was ejected and Ernie Shore came into the game to relieve him. Then Morgan tried stealing second base on the first pitch by Shore, but Boston catcher Sam Agnew quickly threw the ball to the second baseman to tag out Morgan. After that, Shore retired the next 26 Senators."

        "title": "Chris Wallace (basketball)",
        "text": "Chris Wallace is an American professional basketball executive and scout who is the director of scouting for the Houston Rockets of the National Basketball Association (NBA).\nWallace began working in the NBA in 1986, and was the general manager of the Boston Celtics for ten seasons. Unlike many of his general manager peers, he has never been a player or coach in the NBA. In 2007, he joined the Memphis Grizzlies as their general manager and vice president of basketball operations.\nEarly years.\nWallace graduated from Buckhannon-Upshur High School in 1976. In 1981, while a student at the University of Kansas, Wallace founded Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook, an in-depth preseason guide, which he edited and published until 1996. His work on the publication helped him build a reputation as an expert in the field.\nProfessional career.\nJon Spoelstra gave Wallace his first NBA job with the Portland Trail Blazers. Wallace was Director of Player Personnel for the Miami Heat before coming to Boston. The Heat won a franchise-record 61 games in 1996–97, and Wallace was credited with discovering many of the Heat's players. His responsibilities included college and international scouting and searching for potential talent in the Continental Basketball Association as well as the NBA. Wallace was promoted to that position after four years as a scout for the Heat.\nBefore joining the Heat, Wallace worked in various scouting capacities for the Trail Blazers, Denver Nuggets, Los Angeles Clippers, and New York Knicks. He also worked as a draft consultant for the United States Basketball League.\nBoston Celtics.\nWallace was hired by the Boston Celtics in 1997, with Miami receiving a second-round draft pick to end his contract and allow him to take the new job, and became general manager for the 2000–01 season. The next season, Wallace made a trade-deadline trade with the Phoenix Suns of top-10 draft pick Joe Johnson for Tony Delk and Rodney Rogers (among others), which would help get the Celtics to their first Eastern Conference finals in over a decade, but the trade became problematic over the long term when Johnson became a major star with Phoenix and Atlanta, while Rogers left the Celtics after Wallace failed to sign him to a contract extension. Wallace drafted Paul Pierce, who fell to the Celtics with the No. 10 pick in the 1998 NBA draft. He also traded for Vin Baker, who had been signed to a large contract and tied up Boston's salary cap for three years while battling alcoholism. He has been criticized for his draft history and his free-agent signings while the Celtics' GM.\nMemphis Grizzlies.\nChris Wallace was hired to replace outgoing president Jerry West for the 2007–08 season. Wallace stated in an initial press conference that his goal was to one day win a championship with the team and head coach Marc Iavaroni.\nHe was brought to work in Memphis just days before the 2007 draft, where the Grizzlies chose point guard Mike Conley Jr. with the fourth pick. Iavaroni lasted for just over a year as coach before being fired.\nWallace was heavily criticized in NBA circles for trading away the Grizzlies' 27-year-old franchise player, Pau Gasol, to the Los Angeles Lakers on February 1, 2008. In exchange, the Grizzlies received Kwame Brown, Javaris Critterton, a rookie second-round pick who had not yet played in the NBA (Marc Gasol) and a pair of very low future first-round picks (Lakers' 2008 and 2010). Many fans and sports commentators believed that the Grizzlies did not receive enough talent in return for Gasol and that the deal was a salary dump. The move also puzzled some rivals. San Antonio Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich was quoted by \"Sports Illustrated\" as saying \"What they did in Memphis is beyond comprehension. There should be a trade committee that can scratch all trades that make no sense. I just wish I had been on a trade committee that oversees NBA trades. I would have voted no to the LA trade.\" \nDespite the initial negative consensus regarding the Gasol trade, Wallace eventually won praise for his work rebuilding the Grizzlies' roster and making the Grizzlies contenders in the West. In 2013, Marc Gasol was named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year.\nWallace's role with Memphis diminished after team ownership transferred from Michael Heisley to Robert Pera. In 2012, John Hollinger became Memphis' vice president of basketball operations, with Wallace remaining as general manager. During his final season as GM he made his last move by trading Marc Gasol to the Toronto Raptors in exchange for Jonas Valanciunas, Delon Wright, C.J Miles and a 2024 second round pick - which resulted in Gasol winning his first NBA championship while Memphis missed the playoffs. On April 11, 2019, Wallace was demoted from his position as general manager to scout in the Grizzlies' restructuring due to poor results during the 2018–19 season, with assistant general manager Zach Kleiman being his replacement.\nPersonal life.\nA native of Buckhannon, West Virginia, Wallace and his wife Debby have one son named Truman."

France lost both its games to Spain and South Africa. \nIn September 2013, France named former MLB pitcher Éric Gagné new head coach. The team played a series of trial games in Florida in October 2013 and in Phoenix, Arizona, in March 2014 in preparation for the 2014 European Championships. In early September 2014, France hosted the inaugural France International Baseball Tournament. France won the first exhibition game 8–7 vs. Japan before claiming game 1 6–3 over Belgium and game 2 10–5, again over Japan. \"Les Bleus\" claimed their first-ever victory over the Netherlands with a 12–8 win on 8 September 2014, before falling 3–2 against the Dutch in the championship game the following night.\nEvery two years, France participates in the European Baseball Championship. France's best result came in 1999 when the team finished third. The French National team finished 6th in the 2014 European Championships, going 4–1 in Regensburg, GER before falling to Czech Republic, Holland and Spain in the Brno, CZ.\nIn March 2015 French pitcher Owen Ozanich was France's lone representative on Team Europe, which split two contests at the Tokyo Dome against Samurai Japan.\nIn July 2015 France sent many of its national team players to participate in the 2015 World University Summer Games in South Korea. Rouen manager Keino Perez was the manager for this competition. France finished in 8th place. Once back in Europe, the national team played a series of games in Antwerp, Belgium, 23–24 July against Sweden and the host country, Belgium. With a 2–0 record, France won the Flanders invitational tournament with Belgium coming in second and Sweden third.\nIn November and December 2015 Ozanich along with Leonel Cespedes represented France on Team Europe during the Asian Winter League held in Taichung, Taiwan. Cespedes had a 4.50 ERA out of the bullpen. Ozanich led the team in innings pitched, strikeouts, and ERA.\nThe French National Team competed in the 2016 World Baseball Classic Qualifiers held in March 2016 in Panama. In game one, Panama beat France behind long-time MLB catcher Carlos Ruiz's two home runs in front of a crowd of over 11,000. In game two, Cespedes pitched France to a victory over European rival Spain at Rod Carew Stadium. The 5–3 victory marked the first win in four tries at the WBC Qualifiers for the French. In the semi-final game, France, led by offensively by first baseman Rene Leveret's home run in the fifth inning, found themselves tied with Panama in the fifth inning, but were not able to close out the game, falling 7–4, ending their hopes of qualifying for the 2017 WBC.\nIn April 2016 Kieran Mattison replaced Eric Gagne as French National Team Manager. On 16 July 2016 the FFBS hosted its first-ever All-Star Game in La Rochelle, won by the French League Foreign All-Stars by a score of 12–7 over the French National Team. Prior to the game, French national team shortstop Felix Brown won the first annual home run derby.\nIn September 2016, the French Federation hosted the second edition of the France International Baseball Tournament (also known as the Yoshida Challenge), featuring France, Germany, Netherlands, and International Stars. France finished in third place behind Germany and the Netherlands. France finished in 7th place in the 2016 European Championships which were held in Hoofddorp, NL.

Third baseman Maxime Lefevre hit .500 for the tournament while P/OF Leonel Cespedes posted a 2–0 record with a 0.64 ERA.\nFrench pitchers Owen Ozanich and Marc-Andre Habeck represented France at the 2016 Asian Winter League with Team Europe.\nIn July 2017 French/Cuban 1B/OF Ernesto Martinez Jr. signed with the Milwaukee Brewers for $880,000, the largest-ever bonus for a French player. The big lefty served as France's designated hitter at just 16 years old in the 2016 WBC Qualifier where he played alongside his father, Ernesto Martinez Sr. a longtime star in the French D1 for Senart. Through the 2023 MiLB season, Martinez, now 24, has hit .255/.362/.420 with 37 HR, 161 RBI and 65 SB.\nIn July 2017 the French national team again participated in the annual All-Star Game, again held in La Rochelle, falling 5–1 to the All-Star Team made up of the best foreign players.\nIn August 2017, the French University team participated in the Summer Universiades in Taipei, Taiwan. The team had a surprise win over the highly favored Chinese Taipei, before falling to Korea and Czech Republic. Overall the team, again coached by Keino Perez finished 7th out of 8.\nIn November 2018 les bleus, managed by Kieran Mattison, headed to South Africa for a 7-game series against the South African National Team where they went 2–5 in the seven contests held in Johannesburg, Durban, and Cape Town. Minor league pitcher Yoan Antonac (Phillies) made his national team debut for France. Jose Paula was named to the all series team where he took home best defensive player for the week, Maxime Lefevre led all players in stolen bases.\nThe 2019 French season featured a 12-team Division 1, the league previously had 8 teams in the top division prior to this expansion. In late February, the national team held spring training in Tenerife, Spain. Five national team members played in Italy in 2019: Owen Ozanich and Marc-Andre Habeck with Parma (Serie A), Andy Paz with Bologna (Serie A) Leonel Cespedes with Redipuglia (Serie A), and Franklin de la Rosa with Grosseto (Serie B).\nIn September 2019 the French National Team competed in the 2019 European Championships. Maxime Lefevre led the team with a .435 average, followed by Bastien Dagneau (.429), Andy Paz (.400) and Fred Hanvi (.350). France finished in 7th place, beating Austria, Belgium and Croatia, while falling to Italy, Spain, Israel and Germany. On the mound, Marc-Andre Habeck led France in innings pitched (11.0), Leonel Cespedes logged 7.2, and Owen Ozanich 6.0. Habeck also led the staff in strikeouts (12), ahead of Ozanich (5), Yoann Vaugelade (4) and Franklin de la Rosa (4). Daniel Camou and Lilian Amoros each logged three scoreless innings to lead the staff in ERA.\nThe FFBS shocked the European baseball community when they announced Bruce Bochy would take over as manager of the national team. The announcement came in late 2019, and confirmed rumors that the future Hall of Fame skipper would lead the team in the 2020 World Baseball Classic Qualifier. Due to the world wide Coronavirus outbreak in March 2020, the WBC qualifiers were postponed to September 2022.\nThe 2020 French Division 1 season was cancelled on 6 May 2020. French minor leaguers Yoan Antonac and Ernesto Martinez Jr. also had their minor league seasons cancelled due to covid-19. Ariel Soriano (Nettuno) and Owen Ozanich (Parma) played 2020 in Italy. Norbert Jongerius and Robyn Clara played in the Netherlands.\nThe 2021 French Division 1 season began in June 2021. In early September 2021, the Montpellier Barracudas took home the Challenge de France. In October, the French Series saw Perez's Rouen Huskies beat Senart in five games to win their 16th French Title. Outfielder Martin Vissac took home MVP honors. \nThe French national team finished a disappointing 15th (out of 16) in the 2021 European Championships held in Turin, Italy. France lost to Great Britain, Israel, Germany, and Greece. They beat Russia and Slovakia. The team struggled under newly appointed interim manager Keino Perez, who took over for Bochy, who cancelled his trip to Europe over covid concerns. Offensively, only Andy Paz (.364) hit over .300 for a team that hit a collective .167 over 6 games. On the mound, the French did slightly better, with the then 32 year-old Ozanich leading the team in innings (10.0) and strikeouts (13) while 17 year-old Mathis Nayral allowed just 1 run over 7.1 IP (1.23 ERA) while punching out 7 batters. Outfielder Jose Paula also contributed on the mound, giving up 2 ER in 5.0 IP, striking out 9.\nIn July 2022, the French national team headed to Bulgaria for the 'B' pool qualifier. France, which needed to win the qualifier in order to again participate in the 2023 European Championships, did just that, sweeping through the competition. Les bleus won the final against host Bulgaria, in what was former ace pitcher Owen Ozanich's final start with the national team. In a passing of the torch moment, Ozanich was relieved by French flamethrower Mathias LaCombe, who took home the tournament best pitcher award. \nThe Rouen Huskies, under first year manager Boris Marche, won the 2022 French Series three games to one against the Savigny Lions. With this victory, Rouen clinched a spot in the 2023 European Champions Cup. \nIn the fall of 2022, Future Hall of Frame manager Bruce Bochy finally debuted in an official competition at the helm of Les Bleus. The World Baseball Classic qualifier, held in Regensburg, Germany saw France lose in the opening round to Great Britain and Czech Republic, both of whom advanced to the 2023 World Baseball Classic. Ivan Acuna was France's top hitter, going 3-for-5 with a home run and 3 RBI in the two games. On the mound, Esteban Prioul and Jose Paula had scoreless outings, while Yoimer Camacho struck out five batters.\nThe 2023 regular season saw the Montpellier Barracudas dominate from start to finish. The club, under first year player/coach Owen Ozanich and Giovanni Luciani, posted the best regular season record (19-5) before beating Toulouse in the semi-finals and Montigny in the 2023 French Series. Savigny catcher Ivan Acuna had a memorable season, taking home the FFBS award for best hitter. The Venezuelan slugger won the triple crown (hghest average, most home runs and RBI). \nFollowing the Barracudas first title since 1995, the French national team, managed by Keino Perez, headed to Spain for a series of exhibition games prior to the 2023 European Championships. The 2023 Euros, held in several cities in the Czech Republic, saw France finish 3-3, good for 7th place overall. France could have made a run at a medal if not for a late inning comeback by Germany in the quarterfinals against the French bullpen. Milwaukee Brewers top prospect Ernesto Martinez participated in his first European Championships with France, batting .286 with a homer and 3 RBI.

He threw and batted left-handed, stood tall and weighed .\nLee attended East Los Angeles College and signed with the San Francisco Giants in 1959. After winning only seven of 26 decisions for Class B Fresno (with 160 strikeouts and 202 bases on balls in only 162 innings pitched), he was selected by Cleveland in the December 1959 first-year player draft. He then spent 1960 with the MLB Indians. Working in seven games, all in relief, he allowed only six hits and two earned runs in nine full innings pitched, with six strikeouts. However, he issued 11 bases on balls. In 1961, he began the year with the Indians' Class A Reading affiliate, but was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals' organization in June.\nAfter only a year with Cardinal farm teams, however, Lee was released by the Redbirds in June 1963. He then signed with the Angels, returning him to his native Southern California. He was recalled from the minor leagues in August 1963 and made six appearances as an Angel, four as a starting pitcher. He earned his two MLB decisions in his first two outings as an Angel starter. On August 17, at Dodger Stadium, facing the Detroit Tigers (and their starter, eventual Baseball Hall of Famer Jim Bunning), he allowed only one run in his first three full innings, but faltered in the fourth, giving up a home run to Don Wert; he was charged with four runs allowed in 4 innings pitched and took the 6–1 loss. Thirteen days later, he went the mound against the Kansas City Athletics at Municipal Stadium. This time, he permitted only two runs and six hits in six full innings and departed for a pinch hitter with the Angels holding a 3–2 lead. The Angels went on to win, 6–2, giving Lee what would be his lone MLB victory. In his final big-league appearance on September 22, 1963, he started against his original team, the Indians, at Cleveland Stadium and registered his most effective start, working six innings and allowing only one run on six hits. He left the game for a pinch hitter with the game tied, 1–1; the Indians went on to win in extra innings.\nLee returned to the minor leagues in 1964 and was released by the Angels in June 1965, ending his professional career. In his 13 MLB games, he worked in 35 innings, allowing 36 hits and 25 bases on balls; he was credited with 35 strikeouts. He posted a 1–1 won–lost mark and a 3.34 career earned run average."

        "text": "Carlos Antonio Morales López (born September 27, 1948) is a retired professional baseball player. Nicknamed \"Chaflán\" in his native Mexico, López spent seven seasons in professional baseball, including three seasons in Major League Baseball with the California Angels (1976), Seattle Mariners (1977), and the Baltimore Orioles (1978). Over his major league career, López batted .260 with 61 runs, 130 hits, 24 doubles, one triples, 12 home runs, 54 runs batted in (RBIs), and 23 stolen bases in 237 games played. On the defensive side, López has played 181 games in right field and 49 games in center field.\nLópez began his professional career in 1969 with the minor league Class-A Aguascalientes Tigres of the Mexican Center League. Later that season, he played for the Triple-A Mexico City Tigres of the Mexican League. López was purchased from the Tigers by the California Angels from the Tigres in 1973. He then played for the Double-A El Paso Diablos (1974–1975) Triple-A Salt Lake City Gulls (1975–1976) in the California organization; and the Triple-A Rochester Red Wings (1979) in the Baltimore Orioles organization. Over his minor league career in the United States, López batted .316 with 511 hits, 72 doubles, 31 triples, and 39 home runs. In all but one game where he played first base, López played in the outfield.\nProfessional career.\nEarly career.\nIn 1969, López began his professional career in the Mexican Center League. With the non-affiliated Class-A Aguascalientes Tigres, a team based in Aguascalientes, Mexico, he played 116 games. López also played with the non-affiliated Triple-A Mexico City Tigres in the Mexican League. He played six games with Mexico City that season. Until 1973, López played with Mexico City, although statistics were not kept.\nCalifornia Angels.\nThe California Angels purchased López from the Mexico City club from the Mexican League on December 3, 1973. He started his career in the United States with the Double-A El Paso Diablos of the Texas League in 1974. With the Diablos, López batted .295 with 136 hits, 21 doubles, seven triples, and 14 home runs in 128 games. In 1975, López split the season with the Double-A El Paso Diablos and the Triple-A Salt Lake City Gulls. With the Diablos, he batted .327 with 77 runs, 140 hits, 22 doubles, 10 triples, nine home runs, 78 runs batted in (RBIs), and 11 stolen bases in 112 games. López was first in the Texas League in triples, and fifth in the league in hits. That season, he also played 15 games with the Triple-A Gulls and batted .250 with three runs, 12 hits, two doubles, one home run, five RBIs, and two stolen bases. López spent the 1976 season with the Triple-A Salt Lake City Gulls, and later made the California Angels' roster as a September call-up. With the Gulls, he batted .350 with 95 runs, 157 hits, 19 doubles, 12 triples, nine home runs, 88 RBIs, and 30 stolen bases in 123 games. López was tied for second in the Pacific Coast League in triples, and was third in batting average. López made his major league debut that season against the Minnesota Twins on September 17. In that games, López walked in his one plate appearance. On the season, López went hitless with one run and two stolen bases in nine games in the majors.\nSeattle Mariners.\nLópez was selected by the Seattle Mariners in the 1976 Major League Baseball expansion draft. At the age of 26, it was noted by The Associated Press that López and teammate Dick Pole were \"the old men\" on the Mariners' roster. The Associated Press also noted that fellow players and managers \"rave\" about López's speed, but also asserted that he had a throwing arm that was as good. He got his first major league hit against the California Angels on April 10. López hit his first major league home run against the Boston Red Sox on May 3. On May 30, López hit two home runs in the same game against the Texas Rangers. On the season, López batted .283 with 39 runs, 84 hits, 18 doubles, one triple, eight home runs, 34 RBIs, and 16 stolen bases in 99 games.\nBaltimore Orioles.\nLópez was traded along with Tommy Moore from the Mariners to the Baltimore Orioles for Mike Parrott at the Winter Meetings on December 7, 1977. In 1978, López spent the entire season with the Orioles. He batted .238 with 21 runs, 46 hits, six doubles, four home runs, 20 RBIs, five stolen bases, and seven caught stealing in 129 games. López was demoted to the Triple-A Rochester Red Wings in 1979, his final professional season. With the Red Wings, he batted .282 with 38 runs, 66 hits, 10 doubles, two triples, six home runs, 30 RBIs, and 24 stolen bases in 62 games. López led the International League in stolen bases and caught stealing (7)."

It marked the first relocation of an MLB franchise in fifty years, as the Boston Braves moved their NL franchise to Milwaukee, where they would play their home games at the new County Stadium. This was also the first regular season of the televised \"Major League Baseball Game of the Week\", originally broadcast on ABC.\nThe New York Yankees won their fifth consecutive World Series championship, an MLB record.\nPostseason.\nBracket.\n&lt;section begin=Bracket/&gt;\n&lt;section end=Bracket/&gt;\nTelevision coverage.\nABC executive Edgar J. Scherick approached MLB with a Saturday \"Game of the Week\". With fewer outlets than CBS or NBC, ABC needed paid programming (or \"anything for bills\" as Scherick put it). At first, ABC hesitated at the idea of a nationally televised regular season baseball program, but gave Scherick the green light to sign up teams. Prior to the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961, antitrust laws only allowed the networks to make deals with individual teams instead of pooling rights directly from a central league authority. Unfortunately, only three (the Philadelphia Athletics, Cleveland Indians, and Chicago White Sox were interested. To make matters worse, Major League Baseball barred the \"Game of the Week\" from airing within fifty miles of any big-league city.\nThe All-Star Game and World Series aired exclusively on NBC."

        "title": "History of fencing",
        "text": "The oldest surviving manual on western swordsmanship dates back to the 14th century, although historical references date fencing schools back to the 12th century.\nModern fencing originated in the 18th century influenced by the Italian school of fencing of the Renaissance, and improved by the French school.\nTerminology.\nThe English term \"fencing\", in the sense of \"the action or art of using the sword scientifically\" (OED), dates to the late 16th century, when it denoted systems designed for the Renaissance rapier. It is derived from the latinate \"defence\" (while conversely, the Romance term for fencing, \"scherma, escrima\" are derived from the Germanic (Old Frankish) \"*skrim\" \"to shield, cover, defend\").\nThe verb \"to fence\" derived from the noun \"fence\", originally meaning \"the act of defending\", etymologically derived from Old French \"defens\" \"defence\", ultimately from the Latin. The first attestation of Middle English \"fens\" \"defence\" dates to the 14th century; the derived meaning \"to surround with a fence\" dates to c. 1500.\nThe first known English use of \"fence\" in reference to Renaissance swordsmanship is in William Shakespeare's \"Merry Wives of Windsor\", (act i, scene 1), \"with playing at sword and dagger with a master of fence,\" , and later, (act 2, scene 3) \"Alas sir, I cannot fence\" the term \"fencer\" is used in Much Ado About Nothing, \"blunt as the fencer's foils, which hit, but hurt not.\" This specialized usage replaced the generic \"fight\" (Old English \"feohtan\", cognate with the German \"fechten\", which remains the standard term for \"fencing\" in Modern German).\nAntiquity.\nThe origins of armed combat are prehistoric, beginning with club, spear, axe, and knife. Fighting with shield and sword developed in the Bronze Age; bladed weapons such as the khopesh appeared in the Middle Bronze Age and the proper sword in the Late Bronze Age.\nThe first historical evidence from archaeology of a fencing contest was found on the wall of a temple within Egypt built at a time dated to approximately 1190 B.C.\nHomer's \"Iliad\" includes some of the earliest descriptions of combat with shield, sword and spear, usually between two heroes who pick one another for a duel. Roman gladiators engaged in dual combat in a sport-like setting, evolving out of Etruscan ritual. Tomb frescoes from Paestum (4th century BC) show paired fighters with helmets, spears and shields, in a propitiatory funeral blood rite that anticipates gladiator games.\nRomans who frequented the gymnasia and baths often fenced with a stick whose point was covered with a ball. Vegetius, the Late Roman military writer, described practicing against a post and fencing with other soldiers. Vegetius describes how the Romans preferred the thrust over the cut, because puncture wounds enter the vital organs directly whereas cuts are often stopped by armour and bone. Raising the arm to deliver a cut exposes the side to a thrust. This doctrine was exploited by Italian fencing masters in the 16th Century and became the primary rationale behind both the Italian and French schools of fencing.\nMiddle Ages and Renaissance.\nSword fighting schools can be found in European historical records dating back to the 12th century. In later times sword fighting teachers were paid by rich patrons to produce books about their fighting systems, called treatises. Sword fighting schools were forbidden in some European cities (particularly in England and France) during the medieval period, though court records show that such schools operated illegally.\nThe earliest surviving treatise on sword fighting, stored at the Royal Armouries Museum in Leeds, England, dates from around 1300 AD and is from Germany. It is known as I.33 and written in medieval Latin and Middle High German and deals with an advanced system of using the sword and buckler (smallest shield) together.\nFrom 1400 onward, an increasing number of sword fighting treatises survived from across Europe, with the majority from the 15th century coming from Germany and Italy. In this period these arts were largely reserved for the knighthood and the nobility – hence most treatises deal with knightly weapons such as the rondel dagger, longsword, spear, pollaxe and armoured fighting mounted and on foot. Some treatises cover weapons available to the common classes, such as großes Messer and sword and buckler. Wrestling, both with and without weapons, armoured and unarmoured, was also featured heavily in the early sword fighting treatises.\nThe very first manual of fencing was published during 1471, by Diego de Valera.(in spite of the title, the book of Diego de Valera was mainly focused on heraldry). Fencing practice went through a revival, with the \"Marxbruder\" group, sometime about 1487 A.D. the group having formed some form of Fencing Guild.\nFrancisco Román published in 1532 the Tratado de la esgrima con figuras. It meant a change in the approach to fencing, with a more mathematical approach, and started a new tradition in Spanish fencing.\nThe Spanish rapier was apparently introduced to England during a time circa to 1540 (according to listings of the armoury of Henry the VIIIth). During 1587 a certain Rowland Yorke (of otherwise ill-repute) might have introduced a particular technique with the rapier-sword to somewhere in England.\nIn 1582 was finally published Jerónimo Carranza's seminal treatise De la Filosofía de las Armas y de su Destreza y la Aggression y Defensa Cristiana, one of the main works of the Spanish tradition on Verdadera Destreza. Its precepts are based on reason, geometry, and tied to intellectual, philosophical, and moral ideals, incorporating various aspects of a well-rounded Renaissance humanist education, with a special focus on the writings of classical authors such as Aristotle, Euclid or Plato. Its represents a break from an older tradition of fencing in Spain, the so-called esgrima vulgar or esgrima común ('vulgar or common fencing'). That older tradition, with roots in medieval times, was represented by the works of authors such as Jaime Pons [es; ca] (1474), Pedro de la Torre (1474) and Francisco Román (1532). Writers on destreza took great care to distinguish their \"true art\" from the \"vulgar\" or \"common\" fencing. The older school continued to exist alongside la verdadera destreza, with Spanish soldiers working as fencing masters across Europe, but was increasingly influenced by the new destreza forms and concepts.\nDuring the 16th century the Italian masters Agrippa, Capo ferro, di Grassi, Fabris, Giganti, Marozzo, and Viggiani wrote treatises which established Italy as the originator of modern fencing.\nBy the 16th century, with the widespread adoption of the printing press, the increase in the urban population and other social changes, the number of treatises increased dramatically. After around 1500 carrying swords became more acceptable in most parts of Europe. The growing middle classes meant that more men could afford to carry swords, learn fighting and be seen as gentlemen. By the middle of the 16th century many European cities contained great numbers of swordsmanship schools and fencing was invented with the invention of the rapier. Often schools clustered together, such as in London at \"Hanging Sword Lane\". Italian fencing masters were particularly popular and set up schools in many foreign cities. The Italians brought concepts of science to the art, appealing to the Renaissance mindset.\nIn 16th-century Germany compendia of older \"Fechtbücher\" techniques were produced, some of them printed; notably by Paulus Hector Mair (in the 1540s) and by Joachim Meyer (in the 1570s) and based on 14th-century teachings of the Liechtenauer tradition. In this period German fencing developed sportive tendencies.\nThe rapier's popularity peaked in the 16th and 17th centuries. The Dardi school of the 1530s, as exemplified by Achille Marozzo, still taught the two-handed spadone, but preferred the single–handed sword. The success of Italian masters such as Marozzo and Fabris outside of Italy shaped a new European mainstream of fencing. One master, Girolamo Cavalcabo of Bologna, was employed by the French Court to tutor the future Louis XIII in fencing, and his influence may be seen in later French treatises, such as that by François Dancie in 1623.\nThe \"Ecole Française d'Escrime\" founded in 1567 under Charles IX produced masters such as Henry de Sainct-Didier who introduced the French fencing terminology that remains in use today.\nRapier gave rise to the first recognisable ancestor of modern foil: a training weapon with a narrow triangular blade and a flat \"nail head\" point. Such a weapon (with a swept hilt and a rapier length blade) is on display at the Royal Armouries Museum. However, the first known version of foil rules only came to be written down towards the end of the 17th century (also in France).\nEarly modern period.\nFencing was a popular form of staged entertainment in 16th- and 17th-century England. It was also a fashionable (although somewhat controversial) martial art. In 1540 Henry VIII granted a monopoly on the running of fencing schools in London to The Company of Masters. Fencers were specifically included in the 1597 Vagabonds Act (\"all fencers, bearwards, common players of interludes, and minstrels\"). A number of notable fencing masters from the late 16th century (Vincentio Saviolo, Rocco Bonetti, and William Joyner) ran schools in and around Blackfriars (then the main theatre district of London).\nAround the same time, a number of significant fencing manuals were written in or translated into English. Prizefights were bloody but rarely lethal. Samuel Pepys describes visiting at least two prizefights held in London's Beargarden in 1667 – the contestants were tradesmen rather than fencing masters; both fights ended after one of the contestants was unable to continue because of wrist injuries. On the whole, the English public opinion of fencing during this period was rather low; it was viewed in much the same light as cage fighting today.\nAn almost exclusively thrusting style first became popular in France during the 17th century. The French were enthusiastic adopters of the smallsword, which was light and short, and, therefore, well suited to fast, intricate handwork. Light, smaller training weapons were developed on the basis of an existing template: narrow rectangular blade with a \"nail head\" at the end. The first documented competition with rules resembling contemporary foil took place in Toulouse in the late 17th century.\nAcademic and classical fencing.\nBrawling and fighting were regular occupations of students in the German-speaking areas during the early modern period. In line with developments in the aristocracy and the military, regulated duels were introduced to the academic environment, as well. Students wore special clothes, developed special kinds of festivities, sang student songs, and fought duels.\nThe foil was invented in France as a training weapon in the middle of the 18th century to practice fast and elegant thrust fencing. Fencers blunted the point by wrapping a foil around the blade or fastening a knob on the point (\"blossom\", French \"fleuret\"). In addition to practising, some fencers took away the protection and used the sharp foil for duels. German students took up that practice and developed the \"Pariser\" (\"Parisian\") thrusting small sword for the \"Stoßmensur\" (\"thrusting mensur\"). After the dress sword was abolished, the \"Pariser\" became the only weapon for academic thrust fencing in Germany.\nSince fencing on thrust with a sharp point is quite dangerous, many students died from their lungs being pierced (\"Lungenfuchser\"), which made breathing difficult or impossible. However, the counter movement had already started in Göttingen in the 1760s. Here the \"Göttinger Hieber\" was invented, the predecessor of the modern \"Korbschläger\", a new weapon for cut fencing. In the following years, the \"Glockenschläger\" was invented in east German universities for cut fencing as well.\nThrust fencing (using \"Pariser\") and cut fencing (using \"Korbschläger\" or \"Glockenschläger\") existed in parallel in Germany during the first decades of the 19th century—with local preferences. So thrust fencing was especially popular in Jena, Erlangen, Würzburg and Ingolstadt/Landshut, two towns where the predecessors of Munich University were located. The last thrust \"Mensur\" is recorded to have taken place in Würzburg in 1860.\nUntil the first half of the 19th century all types of academic fencing can be seen as duels, since fencing with sharp weapons was about honour. No combat with sharp blades took place without a formal insult. For duels involving non-students, e.g. military officers, the \"academic sabre\" became usual, apparently derived from the military sabre. It was then a heavy weapon with a curved blade and a hilt similar to the \"Korbschläger\".\nClassical fencing derives most directly from the 19th- and early 20th-century national fencing schools, especially in Italy and France, although other pre–World War II styles such as Russian and Hungarian are also considered classical. Masters and legendary fencing figures such as Giuseppe Radaelli, Louis Rondelle, Masaniello Parise, the Greco brothers, Aldo Nadi and his rival Lucien Gaudin were typical practitioners of this period.\nDueling went into sharp decline after World War I. Training for duels, once fashionable for males of aristocratic backgrounds (although fencing masters such as Hope suggest that many people considered themselves trained from taking only one or two lessons), all but disappeared, along with the classes themselves. Fencing continued as a sport, with tournaments and championships. However, the need to actually prepare for a duel with \"sharps\" vanished, changing both training and technique.\nDevelopment into a sport.\nThe need to train swordsmen for combat in a nonlethal manner led fencing and swordsmanship to include a sport aspect from its beginnings, from before the medieval tournament right up to the modern age.\nThe shift towards fencing as a sport rather than as military training happened from the mid-18th century, and was led by Domenico Angelo, who established a fencing academy, Angelo's School of Arms, in Carlisle House, Soho, London in 1763. There, he taught the aristocracy the fashionable art of swordsmanship which they had previously had to go the continent to learn, and also set up a riding school in the former rear garden of the house. He was fencing instructor to the Royal Family. With the help of artist Gwyn Delin, he had an instruction book published in England in 1763 which had 25 engraved plates demonstrating classic positions from the old schools of fencing. His school was run by three generations of his family and dominated the art of European fencing for almost a century.\nHe established the essential rules of posture and footwork that still govern modern sport fencing, although his attacking and parrying methods were still much different from current practice. Although he intended to prepare his students for real combat, he was the first fencing master yet to emphasize the health and sporting benefits of fencing more than its use as a killing art, particularly in his influential book \"L’École des armes\" (\"The School of Fencing\"), published in 1763. According to the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\", \"Angelo was the first to emphasize fencing as a means of developing health, poise, and grace. As a result of his insight and influence, fencing changed from an art of war to a sport.\"\nAs fencing progressed, the combat aspect slowly faded until only the rules of the sport remained. While the fencing taught in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was intended to serve both for competition and the duel (while understanding the differences between the two situations), the type of fencing taught in a modern sport fencing salle is intended only to train the student to compete in the most effective manner within the rules of the sport.\nThe first regularized fencing competition was held at the inaugural Grand Military Tournament and Assault at Arms in 1880, held at the Royal Agricultural Hall, in Islington in June. The Tournament featured a series of competitions between army officers and soldiers. Each bout was fought for five hits and the foils were pointed with black to aid the judges. In the United States, the Amateur Fencers League of America drew up a rulebook for fencing in 1891,; in Britain the Amateur Gymnastic &amp; Fencing Association drew up an official set of fencing regulations in 1896.\nOlympic event.\nOnly Foil and Sabre events were part of the first Olympic Games in the summer of 1896. Épée was introduced in 1900 (Paris). Foil was omitted from the 1908 (London) Olympics, but since 1912, fencing events for every weapon—Foil, Épée and Sabre—have been held at every Summer Olympics.\nWomen's foil was first competed at the Olympics in 1924 in Paris. \nThe (so called) 'advanced weapons', Épée and Sabre deemed unsuitable or inappropriate for women, were not included in the Olympic program until late in the 20th century. Women's Épée events were first introduced in 1996 (Atlanta) Olympics and Women's Sabre events in 2000 (Sydney).\nIn the early years of competition fencing, four judges determined whether a touch had been made. Two side judges stood behind and beside each fencer, watching for hits made by that fencer. A director observed from several metres away. At the end of each action, the director called \"Halt,\" described the action, and then polled the judges. If the judges differed, or abstained, the director could overrule. The Director (also referred to head referee) always has the final say. What he says goes. The only way for a call to be changed is for one of the competitors to ask for a review (protest). If the Director acknowledged his own error, he may change the call.\nThough it was universally used, this method had serious limitations. This is described by the London newspaper, the \"Daily Telegraph &amp; Courier\", on June 25, 1896: \nOn Tuesday night, a 10 Warwick Street, Regent Street, the Salle d’Armes of the veteran fencing-master M. Bertrand, an exhibition was given of an exceedingly clever invention. Every one who has watched a bout with the foils knows that the task of judging the hits is with a pair of amateurs difficult enough, and with a well-matched pair of maîtres d’escrime well-nigh impossible... The invention is the work of Mr. Little, the well-known amateur swordsman, and is designed to do away with this uncertainty and useless expenditure of energy. It is hardly necessary to say that the inventor has called electricity to his aid. Briefly, the invention consists of an automatic electric recorder. The instrument is fastened to the wall and connected with the collar of the combatant, from whence the current is conveyed down the sleeve into the handle of the foil. The blade of the foil pressing into the handle completes the connection; the current is conveyed to a bell in the instrument, and thus each hit is recorded. At the exhibition the invention proved an unalloyed success, and ought to be a boon both to competitors and judges—to the former on account of its certainty, and to the latter because it not only lightens their labours, but also frees them from any suspicion of partiality.\"\nThere also were problems with bias: well–known fencers were often given the benefit of mistakes (so–called \"reputation touches\"), and in some cases there was outright cheating. Aldo Nadi complained about this in his autobiography \"The Living Sword\" in regard to his famous match with Lucien Gaudin. The \"Daily Courier\" article described a new invention, the electrical scoring machine, that would revolutionize fencing.\nStarting with épée in 1933, side judges were replaced by the Laurent-Pagan electrical scoring apparatus, with an audible tone and a red or green light indicating when a touch landed. Foil was automated in 1956, sabre in 1988. The scoring box reduced the bias in judging, and permitted more accurate scoring of faster actions, lighter touches, and more touches to the back and flank than before.\nHistorical Schools-\"Historical Schools\".\nThe Venetian school of fencing is a style of fencing that occurred in Venice in the early 12th century, and prevailed until the beginning of the 19th century.\nThe basics of the Venetian fencing are expounded in the following five treatises:\nThe Venetians were masters of the art, and shared with their colleagues of Bologna the sound principles of fencing known as Bolognese or Venetian. \nFor the first time Venetian fencing was detailed in some directions, it was described the properties of different parts of the blade, which were used in defense and offense. With this approach, the swordsman had an idea of one thing, what now we calling like \"center of percussion\". It was suggested some divisions of a sword. The blade was divided into four parts, the first two parts from Ephesus should be used for protection; the third one near the center of the blow was used for striking; and the fourth part at the tip was used for pricking.\nGerman school of fencing.\nThe German school of fencing is a historical combat system, a style of fencing that was widespread in the Holy Roman Empire and existed in the late Middle Ages, Renaissance and early Modern times (from the end of XIV to XVII century).\nThe first document of the German heritage, which describes the methods of fencing, is considered to be the Manuscript I.33 which was written around 1300.\nNeapolitan fencing school.\nNeapolitan fencing is a style of fencing that originated in the city of Naples at the beginning of the 15th century. Neapolitan Fencing School is considered to be one of the most powerful fencing schools in Italy.\nMensur.\nFencing has a long history with universities and schools for at least 500 years. At least one style of fencing, Mensur in Germany, is practiced only within academic fraternities.\nMounted Service School.\nPrior to advances in modern weaponry post World War I, the United States Cavalry taught swordsmanship (mounted and dismounted) in Fort Riley, Kansas at its Mounted Service School. George S. Patton Jr., while still a young lieutenant, was named \"Master of the Sword,\" an honor reserved for the top instructor. He invented what came to be known as the \"Patton Saber,\" in 1913, based on his studies with M. Clery L'Adjutant, reputed to be the finest Fencing Master in Europe at the time. While teaching at Fort Riley, he wrote two training manuals teaching the art of swordsmanship to Army Cavalry Officers, \"Saber Exercise 1914\" and \"Diary of the Instructor in Swordsmanship.\""

He was a starting pitcher in Major League Baseball who played from 1952 through 1955 for the Philadelphia/Kansas City Athletics. Listed at , , Bishop batted and threw right-handed.\nA hard-throwing fireballer, Bishop never was able to fulfill the potential that he showed in the minors. He initially signed with the St. Louis Cardinals in , and hurled in Class D that season and in before joining the United States Navy for two years of World War II military service. He resumed his baseball career at age 22 in , then threw a no-hitter in the Class B Piedmont League in . He bounced from the Cardinals to the New York Giants organization before the pitching-poor Philadelphia Athletics acquired his contract prior to the season. \nAfter winning a dozen games for the Triple-A Ottawa A's, he was purchased by the MLB Athletics in August, and posted a 2–2 record and a poor earned run average of 6.46 in six appearances, with five starts, over the final weeks of that American League campaign.\nDuring the 1952–53 winter ball season, Bishop tossed a one-hit shutout in the 1953 Caribbean Series, then he blanked the Boston Red Sox in his first start. But he went only 2–14 the rest of the way, working in a total of in 39 games, 20 of them starts, and posting another substandard ERA (5.66). The start of the campaign saw Bishop back in Ottawa, although he returned to Philadelphia in July to make 20 more appearances, with 12 starts. He dropped six of his ten decisions for a last-place team, but lowered his ERA to a career-best 4.41. The once-storied Philadelphia franchise was sold during that offseason and transferred to Kansas City, Missouri. Bishop began with the relocated Athletics and worked in four games out of the bullpen before being sent back to the minors a final time during the May roster cutdown. His professional baseball career ended later that season.\nIn all or parts of four MLB seasons, Bishop posted a 10–22 (5.33) record and 121 strikeouts in 69 pitching appearances (37 starts) in 294 innings of work. He compiled six complete games, one shutout and three saves, yielding 307 hits and 168 bases on balls."

The Wildcats signed two talented PGs in Fred Brown (West Palm Beach, Florida) and Jacob Pullen (Maywood, Illinois) and added SF Andre Gilbert (Brooklyn Park, Minnesota), a JUCO transfer with Division I experience. KSU signed a pair of talented players from the Patterson School in North Carolina in SF Dominique Sutton (Durham, North Carolina) and PF Jamar Samuels (Washington, D.C.). Both will attend prep school for the Fall 2007 semester to improve their grades and will join the team at the start of the Spring 2008 semester.\nThough scheduled to graduate from high school in the Spring of 2007, SF Bill Walker (Huntington, West Virginia) finished high school early and enrolled at KSU for the 2007 Spring Semester and was allowed to join the team immediately in December of the 2006–07 season. However, he was injured in just his sixth game at KSU and opted to redshirt for the remainder of the season. He will resume his freshman season of eligibility in 2007–08. PF Ron Anderson (Upper Marlboro, Maryland), a long time AAU teammate of Beasley's, rounded out the class when he was offered a scholarship after a strong AAU showing in the Summer of 2007.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=9| Exhibition\n!colspan=9| Regular season\n!colspan=9| 2007 Old Spice Classic\n!colspan=9| Big 12/Pac-10 Hardwood Series\n!colspan=9| 13th Annual Jimmy V Classic\n!colspan=9| K-State Holiday Classic presented by Subway\n!colspan=9| Big 12 Regular season\n!colspan=9| Phillips 66 2008 Big 12 Championship tournament\n!colspan=9|2008 NCAA tournament\nPost-season.\nBig 12 tournament.\nThe Wildcats went on to a 10–6 record in conference play, earning a number 3 seed in the 2008 Big 12 men's basketball tournament at the Sprint Center in Kansas City, Missouri.

Eventually the title became \"Surfing Magazine\" and moved to Southern California.\nIn 1980, Australian millionaire Clyde Packer bought the magazine after leaving his native Australia and settling in Laguna Beach and ultimately, Santa Barbara. The magazine moved its offices to San Clemente where it was published for more than 15 years before being purchased by Primedia, Inc., and later purchased again by supermarket magnate Ron Burkle's Source Interlink. Always in competition with nearby \"Surfer Magazine\", ultimately both magazines came under the ownership of Source Interlink.\nIn November 1995, the magazine's Senior Editor Skip Snead worked with Santa Cruz aerial innovator Shawn \"Barney\" Barron to develop the Surfing Magazine \"Airshow\" an aerial surfing competition.\n\"Surfing Magazine\" was the official magazine for Vans Triple Crown of Surfing and the National Scholastic Surfing Association. Many popular features include Annual Green Issue and Annual Swimsuit Issue, Shaper of the Year, and International Surfing Day.\nIn January 2017, the magazine's owners, , announced that \"Surfing Magazine\" would cease its print edition and its digital assets would be folded into fellow TEN title and longtime competitor \"Surfer\".

The Veterans Committee met in closed sessions to consider older major league players as well as managers, umpires, executives, and figures from the Negro leagues. It selected Ray Dandridge from the Negro leagues. A formal induction ceremony was held in Cooperstown, New York, on July 26, 1987, with Commissioner of Baseball Peter Ueberroth in attendance.\nBBWAA election.\nThe BBWAA was authorized to elect players active in 1967 or later, but not after 1981; the ballot included candidates from the 1986 ballot who received at least 5% of the vote but were not elected, along with selected players, chosen by a screening committee, whose last appearance was in 1981. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote.\nVoters were instructed to cast votes for up to 10 candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall. The ballot consisted of 28 players; a total of 413 ballots were cast, with 310 votes required for election. A total of 2,730 individual votes were cast, an average of 6.61 per ballot—a record low up to this point, breaking the record low of 6.81 set in 1962. Those candidates receiving less than 5% of the vote will not appear on future BBWAA ballots, but may eventually be considered by the Veterans Committee.\nCandidates who were eligible for the first time are indicated here with a dagger (†). The two candidates who received at least 75% of the vote and was elected is indicated in bold italics; candidates who have since been elected in subsequent elections are indicated in \"italics\". The 4 candidates who received less than 5% of the vote, thus becoming ineligible for future BBWAA consideration, are indicated with an asterisk (*).\nLew Burdette was on the ballot for the 15th and final time.\nThe newly eligible players included 8 All-Stars, three of whom were not included on the ballot, representing a total of 17 All-Star selections. 4-time All Star Sal Bando had the most selections of any newly eligible candidate. The field included two Cy Young Award winners (Mike Marshall and Steve Stone, who retired one season after winning his award).\nPlayers eligible for the first time who were \"not\" included on the ballot were: Rick Auerbach, Ken Brett, Reggie Cleveland, Dick Drago, Duffy Dyer, John Ellis, Tom Hutton, Pat Kelly, Mike Lum, Billy North, Johnny Oates, Freddie Patek, Dave Roberts, Rennie Stennett, Mike Tyson and John Vukovich.\nJ. G. Taylor Spink Award.\nJack Lang (1921–2007) received the J. G. Taylor Spink Award honoring a baseball writer. The award was voted at the December 1986 meeting of the BBWAA, and included in the summer 1987 ceremonies."

South America's Second Division 2008 South American Rugby (division B) was the next tournament to take place. Brazil won on the final day in Paraguay.\nThe two regional champions advanced to a playoff to decide who would face Uruguay and Chile in Round 3A. Brazil won both legs of the two-match series for the right to participate in the 2009 South American Rugby Championship A Division, which was won by Uruguay. Uruguay then faced the United States to determine the Americas 2 seed.\nOn July 11, 2009, Canada claimed the Americas 1 seed, making them the first team to qualify for the 2011 Rugby World Cup. The USA followed on November 21 to claim the Americas 2 seed, sending Uruguay to the playoffs for the final place.\n18 teams participated in the qualifying process. For 2007 there were 19. Changes in participation levels were due to Argentina earning a spot in the 2011 tournament with their performance in 2007, Saint Lucia not participating, and Mexico making their Rugby World Cup qualifying debut.\nRound 1A (Caribbean Regional Tournament) - April 2008.\nThe Caribbean Regional Championships held in the Cayman Islands was the first Qualifying event for the Rugby World Cup 2011. The Tournament included the nine eligible IRB members from the Caribbean &amp; Central America. Mexico was competing in their first major international competition as one of the IRB's newest members. The Mexicans faced Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in a preliminary qualifying match to determine the final eight. The match was played at the Arnos Vale Ground in Kingstown, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. In addition to determining a champion, the tournament played out each final position. The tournament was won by Trinidad and Tobago who advanced to Round 2 of the qualifying process. The main tournament was hosted by the Cayman Islands, with all matches being played at Truman Bodden Stadium in George Town. Attendance at this tournament varied throughout, but the maximum attendance was calculated at 1,395 during the final.\nTeams\nRound 1B (South American Consur B Championships) - June 2008.\nThis round is also the 2008 South American Rugby Championship B Division, a competition for second tier South American nations.

        "title": "United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association",
        "text": "The United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association is an association of member institutions and organizations with college lacrosse programs at all levels of competition, including the three NCAA divisions and non-NCAA schools, at both the varsity and club levels for men and women. The association traces its history through predecessor organizations back to 1882, although it received its present name and became a governing body with unlimited membership in 1926. The association is based in Louisville, Kentucky.\nHistory.\nThe first intercollegiate game in the United States was played on November 22, 1877 between New York University and Manhattan College. Lacrosse had been introduced in upstate New York in the 1860s. Lacrosse was further introduced to the Baltimore area in the 1890s. An organizing body for the sport, the U. S. National Lacrosse Association, was founded in 1879. The first intercollegiate lacrosse tournament was held in 1881, with Harvard beating Princeton, 3–0, in the championship game. New York University and Columbia University also participated.\nIn 1882 three colleges formed a league called the Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (ILA), which several others also joined. In most years from this point through 1931, collegiate lacrosse associations selected annual champions based on season records. In 1899, the Inter-University Lacrosse League (IULL) began play using slightly different rules. The two leagues merged in December, 1905, to form the 8-team United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse League with Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, Lehigh, Penn, Stevens Tech and Swarthmore. The USILL was a closed-membership league, which excluded several lacrosse powers, such as the U.S. Naval Academy. The national championship was officially bestowed only upon teams that were included in the membership of these organizations.\nIn 1906, the USILL established Northern and Southern Divisions, and its by-laws encouraged the annual division winners to play a post-season championship game. Only two such games were played, in 1912 and 1921. As Navy was not a member of the USILL, its teams were not eligible for the championship, even though Navy had the best collegiate record in many of those years. Navy was undefeated from 1917 through 1923, a stretch of 40 games with one tie.\nThe USILL was replaced by the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association in March, 1926, as an open-membership governing body. In addition to the 12 former USILL teams, Rutgers, Navy, Union College, NYU, Colgate and St. Stephen's (now Bard College) became new USILA members. The USILA bestowed gold medals upon the teams that it selected as national champions through the 1931 season. No official champions were named from 1932 through 1935. In 1936, an award was established in the memory of a Baltimore sportswriter to recognize annually the most outstanding teams. From 1936 through 1972, the USILA executive board awarded the Wingate Memorial Trophy to the national champions.\nFrom 1953–1959, lacrosse divisions were officially named after legendary lacrosse-men. These were the Cy Miller, Laurie D. Cox, and Roy Taylor Divisions. They were more commonly referred to as Division I, or A; Division II, or B; and Division III, or C. All college teams were placed in one of the three divisions, dependent upon their records, schedules, and success for the preceding five years, and a point system was created. Any team of the three divisions was eligible to win the national championship, but this was virtually impossible for non-Division I teams. A Division II team, playing several Division I teams, might have been able to achieve it. A team's record was required to include six games against teams in its own division. Teams were realigned every three years, again reflecting their records. All schools were eligible for the national rankings. The team that achieved the highest point total each year, however, was not guaranteed a solo national championship. The system served as guidance to the USILA executive board, who chose co-champions on frequent occasions. This point system prevailed with modifications until the NCAA in the early 1970s established the playoff system for determining champions. After 1959, Divisions II and III were realigned by geographical region instead of by team records.\nAt its 1969 annual meeting in Baltimore, the USILA voted for its first playoff tournament to determine a national champion. In 1971, the NCAA began sponsoring men's lacrosse and began holding an annual championship tournament for Division I schools. The USILA conducted a small college tournament for non-Division I schools in 1972 and 1973 (won by Hobart and Cortland State). In 1974, the NCAA took over the sponsorship of this tournament through the 1979 season, with separate tournaments being conducted in both 1980 and 1981 for Divisions II and III teams. The Division II tournament then was discontinued until returning in 1993.\nAwards.\nThe USILA has inducted members into the United States Lacrosse Museum and National Hall of Fame annually since 1957. In addition, the USILA presents annually a number of awards to top collegiate athletes in NCAA Division I, Division II, and Division III.\nChampions.\nILA champions 1881–1898.\nU.S. National Lacrosse Association tournament\nIntercollegiate Lacrosse Association\nUSIULL and ILA champions 1899–1905.\nU.S. Inter-University Lacrosse League and Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association\nBold indicates victory or tie in head-to-head game, or that such game was not played.\nUSILL champions 1906–1925.\nThe USILL (United States Inter-Collegiate Lacrosse League, also USICLL) was a closed membership organization. Some strong teams of the era, such as Army and Navy, were never members, so that in some years, the USILL champion was not necessarily the best team in the United States.\nThe members of the USILL in 1906 were Columbia University, Cornell University, Harvard University, Johns Hopkins University, Lehigh University, University of Pennsylvania, Stevens Institute of Technology and Swarthmore College. In 1907, Hobart College became a member, and Penn withdrew. As had been the rule for over two decades, 12 players per side constituted a team, and the USILL was split into Northern and Southern divisions, corresponding to the former IULL and ILA, respectively.\nBold indicates victory or tie in head-to-head game, or that such game was not played. \"Italics\" indicates victory in intra-division head-to-head game (1909, 1923) or tie-breaker (1922).\n♦ In 1917–1919, World War I and the influenza epidemic curtailed lacrosse activity, as many schools eliminated or reduced schedules. Cornell, Harvard and Hobart did not field teams in 1917–1918. Yale and Johns Hopkins sat out 1917 only. Cornell did not return until 1920.\n^ Not a USILL member\nUSILL championship tally.\nIn four of the 20 years of the USILL's existence (1907, 1923, 1924, 1925), it was difficult to determine the national champion because the division winners did not play each other. In 1907 and 1924, both division winners claimed championships. In the other two years, Cornell (1923) and Maryland (1925) did not. In the war years of 1917 and 1918, Stevens Tech fielded the only Northern Division team to be active both years. Only one Northern intra-division game was played during that span, thus no Northern Division champion could be declared. However, by virtue of default and one win, the current Stevens Tech record book lists two championships.\n† Co-champion\n‡ Won a post-season playoff game for the championship\nUSILA champions 1926–1935.\nIn 1926, the USILL disbanded and formed the USILA as an open-membership governing body. In addition to the former league's 12 schools, six others were soon admitted as members. From 1926–1931, the USILA executive board awarded gold medals after each season to the teams it selected as the most outstanding in the nation.\n† The USILA did not name champions for the 1932–1935 seasons. The teams listed claim the national championship based on being the leading team in the nation for these years.\nUSILA champions 1936–1972.\nThe Wingate Memorial Trophy was the award given to the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA) national champion in men's college lacrosse from 1936 to 1970.\nFrom 1953–1959, all college teams were placed in one of three divisions, dependent upon their records, schedules, and success for the preceding five years, and a point system was created. Teams were required to play at least six games against teams in their own divisions. Teams were realigned every three years.\nIntercollegiate championship claims, 1881–1935.\nIn all years it existed (1882–1905), the ILA consisted of 3 to 5 teams, with league championships dominated by a few schools. Likewise, the USIULL had only 3 or 4 teams during 1899–1905, with only Cornell's 1903 league title claimed in the present as a championship. Several schools have claimed their Northern and Southern Division titles won during the USILL years as national championships (based on the results of 3 or 4 intra-division games), while others have not. Still others were acclaimed in their time as unofficial title winners based on being leading teams in the collegiate ranks in particular years. Non-league members were ineligible for official title consideration before 1926. The USILA awarded gold medals to leading teams from 1926–1931, but made no selections from 1932–1935.\n§ The USILA did not name champions for the 1932–1935 seasons. School claims national championship based on being that year's leading team.\n† Won a tournament conducted for the first collegiate national championship by the U.S. National Lacrosse Association.\n‡ Won a post-season championship game between the winners of the USILL Northern and Southern Divisions.\nCollege Lacrosse League active membership by year, 1882–1925.\nThe following table considers as inactive, for a particular year, a school that fielded no team (as in war years), as well as a school that did not have, or withdrew from, membership."

The program is classified in the NCAA Division I, and is a member of the Big 12 Conference. The head coach is Jerome Tang. \nThe program began competition in 1902. The first two major-conference titles won by the school were won by the men's basketball team, in 1917 and 1919 (in the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association). Kansas State has gone on to win 19 regular season conference crowns. Jeff Sagarin listed the program 27th in his all-time rankings in the \"ESPN College Basketball Encyclopedia\". Following the 2022-23 season, the Wildcats have a record of 1,717–1,222.\nHistory.\nKansas State University has appeared in 32 NCAA basketball tournaments, most recently in 2023. The team's all-time record in the NCAA tournament is 39–35 (). Kansas State's best finish at the tournament came in 1951, when it lost to Kentucky in the national championship game. The school has reached the Final Four 4 times, the Elite Eight 14 times, and the Sweet Sixteen 18 times. Included among K-State's tournament wins are some all-time classics, including an 83–80 win over Oscar Robertson's Cincinnati team in 1958, which \"Sports Illustrated\" called \"the most exciting game of the 1958 season,\" and a 50–48 win over second-ranked Oregon State in 1981, which \"USA Today\" listed as one of the greatest games in NCAA tournament history.\nThe team also had some notably successful seasons before the creation of the NIT (1938) and the NCAA tournament (1939), including conference titles in 1917 and 1919 under coach Zora G. Clevenger. The Helms Athletic Foundation named Frank Reynolds the program's first All-American player in 1917, and the Premo-Porretta Power Poll retroactively ranked Kansas State #12 in 1910, #18 in 1916, #8 in 1917 and #7 in 1919.\nThe best season in the school's history may have been 1959, when the team finished the season ranked #1 in the final Associated Press poll and Coaches poll. K-State has finished ranked in the Top 10 of one of the two polls on eleven total occasions (most recently in 2023), and in the final top 25 polls 22 total times. The team has also posted a winning record at home every year since 1946.\nAfter a lengthy period with little success during the 1990s and 2000s, the team returned to prominence under head coach Frank Martin. Following a twelve-year absence, the team returned to the NCAA tournament after the 2007–08 season. Following that season, Kansas State freshman Michael Beasley was named an All-American and Big 12 Conference Player of the Year. In the 2009–10 season, the team spent much of the year ranked in the Top 10 of the AP poll and finished second in the Big 12. The team received a #2 seed in the 2010 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament and advanced to the Elite Eight. Along the way, the Wildcats defeated Xavier in a double-overtime thriller, which CBSSports.com called \"one of the best games in the history of the Sweet 16.\"\nOn March 31, 2012, Bruce Weber was announced as head coach after Frank Martin left for South Carolina. During the 2012–2013 season, Weber's first in Manhattan, Kansas State won its first regular season conference title since 1977 and advanced to the NCAA tournament. Weber's team won the conference title again in the 2018–2019 season. K-State appeared in the NCAA tournament five times in Weber's seven seasons, including advancing to the Elite Eight in 2018.\nAfter three consecutive losing seasons, Weber resigned under pressure in March 2022. He was succeeded by longtime Baylor assistant coach Jerome Tang. In Tang's first season, he guided a KSU team picked to finish last in the Big 12 to a third-place finish and to the NCAA Tournament, the first NCAA appearance since 2019. With wins over Montana State, Kentucky, and Michigan State, Tang brought the Wildcats to its first Elite Eight appearance since 2018 and its fourteenth Elite Eight appearance in program history.\nAchievements.\nKansas State has a total of 36 All-Americans, 19 regular-season conference championships and nine conference tournament championships.\nThe program ranks in the top 25 nationally in the following categories:\nThe program also ranks in the top 50 nationally in the following categories:\nTop 25 rankings.\nKansas State University has finished in the final rankings of the AP poll or Coaches poll on 22 occasions throughout its history, including one season at #1 in the final polls (pre-NCAA Tournament). The AP poll first appeared in 1948, and has been published continuously since 1950–51. The Coaches poll began in the 1950–51 season. Currently, the final AP poll is released before the tournament and the final Coaches poll is released after the tournament.\nRivalries.\nKansas: Sunflower Showdown.\nKansas State's main rivalry is with the Kansas Jayhawks. The rivalry peaked in the 1950s when both teams were annually national title contenders. The 1987–88 season also proved to be momentous in the rivalry. In the first matchup of the season, on January 30, 1988, Mitch Richmond scored 35 points to lead Kansas State to a 72–61 win to halt KU's then-record 55-game home winning streak. On February 18, KU turned the tables, prevailing 64–63 at Ahearn Field House in Manhattan to deny K-State a victory over KU in the old field house's last year. In what was supposed to be the rubber game, in the 1988 Big Eight Conference men's basketball tournament, Kansas State won a decisive victory by a 69–54 score. However, the biggest was yet to come. Both teams qualified for the NCAA tournament, and after three wins each in the tournament they faced each other on March 27 in Pontiac, Michigan, for the right to advance to the Final Four. Led by Danny Manning's 20 points, KU turned a tight game into a runaway and prevailed 71–58. Kansas would go on to win the national championship.\nThe rivalry slipped in significance after the 1988 season, and from 1994 to 2005 KU won 31 straight games against K-State, the longest streak for either school in the series. KU also posted a 24-game win streak against the Wildcats in Manhattan, which ended on January 30, 2008, when #22 Kansas State upset #2 Kansas 84–75.\nJeff Sagarin's rankings of the nation's top programs by decade in the \"ESPN College Basketball Encyclopedia\" nicely track the history of the rivalry. In the 1950s, when the rivalry was at its peak, Kansas State finished the decade ranked as the #3 program in the nation and KU was ranked as #4. In the 1960s KU was ranked #9 for the decade and KSU was ranked #11. In the 1970s, the programs were again nearly even, with Kansas State ranked at #24 and KU at #25. In the 1980s some separation appeared, as KU finished the decade ranked at #19 and Kansas State at #31. The big difference appeared in the 1990s and 2000s when KU was ranked at #4 and #2 for the decades, while Kansas State does not appear anywhere in the top 40.\nThe rivalry has become more relevant again in recent years, with both teams ranked in the AP Top 25 for many of their match-ups.\nMissouri.\nAs of the 2022–23 season, Missouri is Kansas State's second most-played rival, with 237 games dating back to 1907. Kansas State leads the series 121–116. The series was last played regularly in the 2011–12 season, before Missouri moved to the Southeastern Conference. For nearly a century beforehand, the two schools shared conferences, beginning in the 1913–14 season in the Missouri Valley Conference, then in the Big Eight Conference and its predecessors from 1928 to 1996, and finally the Big 12 Conference from 1996 to 2012.\nSince Missouri's move to the SEC, the two teams have matched up twice, meeting on neutral floors in 2015 and 2018, both Kansas State victories.\nWichita State.\nKansas State had an ongoing in-state, out-of-conference rivalry with Wichita State, dating back to 1932 and last played in 2022. Kansas State leads the series 22–11. The series had six games from 1932 to 1964, then six games on a home-and-home rotation from the 1969–70 to 1971–72 seasons, and most recently 19 home-and-home games every season from 1985–86 to 2003–04.\nWhen Wichita State became a Top 25 regular in the early 2010s, there came interest in reviving the series. In February 2013, Kansas state senator Michael O'Donnell introduced a bill requiring Kansas and Kansas State to schedule Wichita State.\nThe series was renewed in 2021, with a four-game series calling for games at Intrust Bank Arena in Wichita that year, at Bramlage Coliseum in 2022, T-Mobile Center in Kansas City in 2023, and finally at Charles Koch Arena in 2024.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Wildcats have appeared in the NCAA tournament 32 times.

He played college football for the SMU Mustangs.\nEarly years.\nBorn and raised in Dallas, Texas, Roach graduated from Highland Park High School in University Park, which had earlier produced hall of famers Bobby Layne and Doak Walker.\nRoach accepted a football scholarship from Southern Methodist University.

The team was 4–1 with Starr sidelined and finished 11–2–1, but the 26–7 loss to the Chicago Bears in mid-November was critical; keeping them a half game back in the Western Conference final standings and denied the Packers a chance to win an unprecedented third consecutive NFL championship game.\nHe announced his retirement on May 20, 1964.

The team participates in the West Division of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). They are currently coached by Mike Bianco and play at Swayze Field. They have competed in the College World Series six times, with their first national championship coming in 2022.\nHistory.\nThe University of Mississippi has games recorded as early as 1893. What is commonly referred to as the \"modern era\" is considered to have started in 1947.\nTwenty different coaches have led Ole Miss baseball, but only six of those have done so during the modern era. Mike Bianco became the latest Ole Miss Rebels baseball head coach in June 2000.\nSince Bianco’s arrival, they have captured four Southeastern Conference Western Division titles, the last in 2018. All-time, the Rebels have won seven Southeastern Conference championships and have made the NCAA tournament 25 times. They have also advanced to the College World Series in Omaha, Nebraska, six times, most recently in 2022.\nEarly years (1893–1946).\nThe first Ole Miss baseball game on record is a 6–3 loss to Mississippi A&amp;M (now known as Mississippi State University) in Starkville, Mississippi, during 1893.\nOn the eve of World War I the Rebel baseball team was helmed by future New York Yankee and Hall of Fame member Casey Stengel. He compiled a record of 13–9 as skipper of the Rebels and earned the nickname \"The Old Perfessor.\"\nSmith-Swayze era (1947–1971).\nDuring the Smith-Swayze era, Ole Miss played in three College World Series. The team also won four SEC championships.\nJake Gibbs era (1972–1990).\nAfter the conclusion of his major league baseball career, Jake Gibbs returned to Oxford to coach the Ole Miss baseball team. His first season demonstrated he was winner as a coach just as he had been as a player. But the 1972 season started slow for Gibbs and the Rebels. Going into the 10th game of the season the team was just 4-5. Ole Miss began a run once conference play began and compiled a 15–3 mark against the other teams in the SEC, including a sweep of rival Mississippi State University. This mark was good enough to secure the SEC title. In the 1972 NCAA University Division baseball tournament the team defeated Jacksonville State but suffered a loss at the hands of ACC Champion Virginia. A subsequent win over Florida State placed them in a rematch with Virginia, a game they won convincingly 9-0. The tournament ended with 2 games against South Alabama, a team that had swept Ole Miss at the beginning of the season. Once again, Ole Miss proved they were the better team when it mattered, winning both and advancing to the College World Series.\nThe 1977 baseball season saw the Southeastern Conference adopt a conference tournament for the first time. The winner of the conference tournament was extended an automatic invitation to the NCAA tournament. This privilege has continued unbroken to the present. The 1977 Rebel squad, coached by Jake Gibbs, captured the regular season SEC title with a 15–9 record. This gave the Rebels hosting duties for the first conference tournament. Ole Miss turned their home field advantage and #1 seed into a title, winning the inaugural tournament with a record of 4-1.\nDon Kessinger era (1991–1996).\nBy the middle of the 1990s the Rebel baseball team was consistently winning 30 games each season but had been absent from the post season since 1977. The commitment to baseball remained strong, however. Jake Gibbs retired in 1990 and another former Rebel All-American and Major League star Don Kessinger took over the reins. His 1995 squad won 40 games and ended the team's postseason drought. Led by All-Americans David Delucci and Jamey Price, the Rebels advanced to the championship game of the 1995 NCAA Division I baseball tournament regional but were eliminated by host Florida State.\nPat Harrison era (1997–2000).\nIn 1999 the NCAA adopted the current 64-team Regional and Super Regional format for playoffs. Ole Miss, a storied program that had long been slumbering, made an appearance in this inaugural tournament, just their second trip to the postseason in 22 years. They won their first regional game under the new format, a 12–3 drubbing of Monmouth before they were eliminated by host Texas A&amp;M.\nMike Bianco era (2001–present).\nThe hiring of Mike Bianco, from McNeese State began a long period of awakening the sleeping giant of Ole Miss baseball. At the helm of the Cowboys program for 3 seasons Bianco won 100 games and appeared in the 2000 post season. He had no trouble finding immediate success in Oxford as he guided the Rebels to the 2001 post season and won the second regional game in school history.\nThe 2005 Ole Miss Rebels team ascended to heights unseen in Oxford for many years. The team won 48 games that season, won their first SEC Western Division crown, and earned the first national seed in school history. The Rebels went 4–0 in the Regional and Super Regional tournaments defeating Maine, Oklahoma (x2) and Texas before losing 2 straight to Texas by no more than 2 runs. The Longhorns would then continue to Omaha and win the National Title. Their loss to Ole Miss was just one of their two losses the entire post season.\nThe 2006 campaign was not one of rebuilding but of reloading. The Rebels won 44 games and sprinted through the postseason. During the SEC Conference Tournament in Hoover, Alabama Ole Miss went 4–0 and won their first tournament title since 1977. The next two weekends they won 4 more straight games in Regional and Super Regional competition with wins over Bethune-Cookman, South Alabama, Tulane, and Miami. As with the prior season Ole Miss ended the season in Super Regionals with 2 straight losses after gaining an initial 1–0 lead in the series. Miami would go to deal eventual National Champion Oregon State one of their two losses in Omaha.\nThe 2007 season cemented Mike Bianco's Rebels as a dominant force in college baseball. The team topped 40 wins for the third consecutive season as well as reached the Super Regional portion of the NCAA tournament for the third consecutive time. Their season ended at the hands of #5 National Seed Arizona State in Tempe.\nFor the first time since 1977, the Rebels won a share of the Southeastern Conference regular season title in 2009. The team won 20 conference games and 48 total on the season. The Rebels were selected to host a regional in Oxford where they defeated Missouri and Western Kentucky. The regional championship came courtesy of a brilliant pitching performance by Drew Pomeranz in a Monday elimination game. Pomeranz pitched a complete game and struck out 16 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers in the 4–1 win. In super regional play against Virginia, Ole Miss won the first game but were unable to complete the series and fell 1–2 to the Cavaliers.\nThe Rebels surprised critics in 2014 by capturing the SEC West title (their 3rd under Mike Bianco) and topping 40 wins for the 5th time. Nine players from the 2014 roster were drafted by Major League teams, the most of any team in the nation. Ole Miss went 3–0 in regional play with a win over Jacksonville St. and two over Washington (including an extra-inning second win) to advance to their 5th Super Regional.\nThe team traveled to Lafayette, Louisiana to face the #1 ranked Ragin' Cajuns in Super Regional action. Despite losing the first game, the Rebels rallied to win games 2 and 3 and advance to the College World Series.\nAfter opening the CWS with a loss to the Virginia Cavaliers, the Rebels reeled off 2 straight wins against Texas Tech and TCU in the losers bracket, advancing to the Semi-Finals and a re-match with the Cavaliers which they lost.\nMike Bianco and his Ole Miss Rebel squad topped 40 wins for the 7th time, won the SEC Western Division title, and also captured the SEC Conference Tournament title played annually in Hoover, Alabama. The tournament proved dramatic as the #2 seeded Rebels lost their first game to Auburn and then faced elimination against Georgia in their second. The match against Georgia went to extra innings prompting a comeback in the 10th inning with Georgia leading 4-3. The team collected the necessary 2-runs in the bottom of the 10th for a walk-off win. This win vaulted the team to three consecutive wins (Auburn, Texas A&amp;M, LSU) and the title as their pitching staff gave up just 2 runs in the remaining 27 innings of play. In the final game of the tournament the Rebels defeated long-time rival LSU by a margin of 9–1 in a rematch of the 2008 final.\nThe 2018 NCAA Division I baseball tournament opened in Oxford a day late after flooding left Swayze Field underwater. The Rebels fell down early 2–0 to the St. Louis University Billikens and their ace pitcher, Miller Hogan. A 6-run 2nd inning followed by 2 more runs in the 3rd chased Hogan from the game as the Rebels went on to a 9–2 win. However, Ole Miss was subsequently eliminated from the post-season after losing two straight to Tennessee Tech, winner of the Oxford Regional.\nIn 2019, the decade ended with Ole Miss winning yet another 40 games in a season. They fell one run short of winning the SEC tournament title for the second year in a row against #1 Vanderbilt. The Arkansas Razorbacks proved a key figure in the Ole Miss 2019 run as the Rebels bested the Razorbacks in Fayetteville during the regular season. During the SEC tournament the Razorbacks once again raised their Hog Call as the Rebels met them twice, losing the first match but winning the second. The remarkable SEC tournament run played Ole Miss into a regional host position and a #12 national seed.\nThe 2019 NCAA Division I baseball tournament saw Illinois, Clemson, and Jacksonville State visiting Oxford for regional play. Ole Miss wasted no time racking up wins and scoring runs. They defeated Clemson between two Jacksonville State wins to take the regional 3–0 with a 41–7 run margin. The next weekend saw the Rebels travel to a well-known destination, Fayetteville, to meet the Arkansas Razorbacks once again. The Super Regional saw Ole Miss and Arkansas play their sixth, seventh, and eighth contests of the season against one another.\nOle Miss began the 2022 NCAA Division I baseball tournament as the No. 3 seed in the Coral Gables Regional. They defeated Arizona, #6 Miami and Arizona to advance to the Hattiesburg Super Regional against in-state competitor Southern Miss. There, the Rebels shut out the No. 11 Eagles (10-0, 5-0) to reach the College World Series for the second time under Bianco and sixth in program history. Ole Miss opened the 2022 College World Series with a 5–1 victory over #14 Auburn before defeating Arkansas 13–5 to leave them one game from the finals. Arkansas would rebound for a 3–2 win in game 2 before the Rebels advanced to the CWS finals for the first time with a 2–0 win in game 3. Matched up against Oklahoma, Ole Miss swept the Sooners with a 10–3 victory in game 1 and a 4–2 victory in game 2 to win the program's first national championship.\nStadiums.\nOxford-University Stadium/ Swayze Field.\nOle Miss baseball plays their home games at Oxford-University Stadium/ Swayze Field, a $3.75 million facility that was completed in October, 1988. The first game held there was against Cumberland University on February 19, 1989 in which the Rebels took a doubleheader sweep.\nAttendance milestones.\nOle Miss commonly draws more than 10,000 fans to a single game. The first crowd in excess of 10,000 (10,323) occurred on June 6, 2009 against Virginia in Super Regional play. The first crowd in excess of 11,000 (11,729) occurred during a regular season game against Alabama on April 13, 2013. The first crowd to top 12,000 (12,117) packed Swayze for an opening day game against East Carolina on February 17, 2017. The current record is 12,151 set against LSU on April 28, 2018.\nStadium attendance.\nNCAA Baseball Attendance"

The regular season ended on October 3, with the Brooklyn Robins and Cleveland Indians as the regular season champions of the National League and American League, respectively. The postseason began with Game 1 of the 17th World Series on October 5 and ended with Game 7 on October 12. The Indians defeated the Robins, five games to two.\nThis was the final season to be presided over by the three-person National Baseball Commission, which ran the major and minor leagues—composed of the American League President, National League President, and one team owner as president. In the wake of the Black Sox scandal, the credibility of baseball had been tarnished with the public and fans and the owners of the teams clamored for credibility to be restored. The owners felt that creating one position with near-unlimited authority was the answer. After the season, the commission was replaced with the newly created office of Commissioner of Baseball.\nCreation of the office of the Commissioner of Baseball.\nPersisting rumors of the Chicago White Sox throwing the previous year's World Series to the Cincinnati Reds and another game during the 1920 season led to the game's brass looking for ways of dealing with the problems of gambling within the sport. At the time, MLB was governed by a three-man National Baseball Commission composed of American League President Ban Johnson, National League President John Heydler and Cincinnati Reds owner Garry Herrmann. At the request of the other owners, Herrmann left the office reducing the commission to be deadlocked by two. With the owners disliking one or both presidents, calls began for stronger leadership, although they opined they could support the continuation of the leagues' presidencies with a well-qualified Commissioner.\nA plan that began to circulate and gain support was dubbed the \"Lasker Plan\", after Albert Lasker, a shareholder of the Chicago Cubs, called for a three-man commission with no financial interest in baseball. With the Black Sox scandal exposed on September 30, 1920, Heydler began calling for the Lasker Plan. All eight NL teams supported the plan, along with three AL teams. The three AL teams were the White Sox, the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox. The teams in support of the Lasker Plan wanted federal judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis to take the office of Baseball Commissioner. Johnson, who opposed the plan and thus, the appointment of Landis, had allies in the other five AL clubs, and attempted to get Minor League Baseball to side with him. However, the minor leagues would not, and when the AL teams learned their position, they relented and instead went along with the Lasker Plan. The owners agreed that they needed a person with near-unlimited authority and a powerful person to fill the position of commissioner.\nThe owners approached Landis, who eventually accepted the position as the first Commissioner of Baseball. He drafted the agreement which gave him almost unlimited authority throughout the major and minor leagues – every owner on down to the batboys was accountable to the Commissioner – including barring owners from dismissing him, speaking critically of him in public or challenging him in court. Landis also kept his job as a federal judge.\nWhile Landis' record as Commissioner would eventually attract considerable controversy, especially with respect to his role in maintaining the color line, at the time a near autocratic leader was widely believed to be needed for baseball since the Black Sox scandal had placed the public's trust in baseball on shaky ground. As a result, the owners accepted the terms of the agreement with a scant trace of opposition, if any.\nSchedule.\nThe 1920 schedule consisted of 154 games for all teams in the American League and National League, each of which had eight teams. Each team was scheduled to play 22 games against the other seven teams of their respective league. The 154-game format had previously been used since , except for , and would be used until in the American League and in the National League.\nOpening Day took place on April 14 with all but the Washington Senators and Boston Red Sox playing. The final day of the regular season was on October 3. The World Series took place between October 5 and October 12.\nTripleheader.\nThe 1920 season would feature the extremely rare tripleheader, the only one of its kind in MLB history (3rd in National League history, previously occurring in and ), when the Pittsburgh Pirates hosted the Cincinnati Reds on October 2 for three games, the day before the final day of the regular season. The Reds would win the first two games, while the Pirates would win a 6-inning long 3rd game, called early on account of darkness.\nRule changes.\nThe 1920 season saw the following rule changes:\nEffect of the Black Sox scandal on the AL pennant race.\nAfter an August 31 game between the Philadelphia Phillies and Chicago Cubs, allegations began to arise that the game was fixed. The state court in Chicago opened a grand jury to investigate gambling within baseball. Gambler Billy Maharg came forward with information that he worked with New York gambler Arnold Rothstein and former boxer Abe Attell to get the White Sox to throw the 1919 World Series. The White Sox again were contending for the American League title and were in a near-dead heat with the Cleveland Indians and New York Yankees. However, on September 28, eight White Sox players were indicted and suspended by owner Charlie Comiskey. The Indians pulled ahead and won the pennant by two games over the White Sox.\nPostseason.\nBracket.\n&lt;section begin=Bracket/&gt;\n&lt;section end=Bracket/&gt;\nLeague leaders.\nNational League.\n1 National League Triple Crown pitching winner"

Without a team since 1917, Dunn and his siblings Charles and Katherine had formed the \"Springfield Baseball Club Inc.\" to secure a franchise as the Central League was reforming. The three siblings sold some shared of the franchise stock to Frank Navin, who was the owner of the Detroit Tigers. They received $5,000 from Navin for the stock. In return, Navin secured a percentage of the ballpark concessions and held first-refusal rights on any players that Springfield signed. The Springfield team was then established.\nThe Springfield Dunnmen were named for their manager in 1929, one season before Dunn led Springfield to the Central League championship.\nOn Sunday, March 19, 1944, residing in Springfield, Dunn became ill during a church service and was taken to the nearby Bancroft Hotel, where died in the lobby of a heart attack. He is buried in Calvary Cemetery in Springfield. Kitty Dunn, his wife, lived in the family home until her death in 1968."

        "title": "Rugby union in China",
        "text": "Rugby union in China is a growing sport; however, it is still not overly popular. China became affiliated to the International Rugby Board in 1997 and as of 1 July 2019, its women's XV side was ranked 24th and its men's XV side 80th in the world. Neither the women's team nor the men's team has yet qualified for a Women's Rugby World Cup or a men's Rugby World Cup. However, China has hopes of one day hosting the men's event, and World Rugby has indicated it supports taking the event there.\nHistory.\nEarly rugby union in China was often played by expatriates of various rugby playing nations, and colonials. For example, there was a rugby club in Shanghai, where many of these could be found, and there was also a significant presence in Hong Kong, due to the strong connections with the British Commonwealth. The Shanghai club folded in 1952, and the surplus funds were presented to the English RFU for a \"Royal Retiring Room\", at Twickenham near London.\nIn the 1930s and 1940s, rugby is said to have been adopted by Chinese military commanders to instil aggression into troops during the war with Japan.\nLater, for a period under Communism, rugby was banned in China, with the national Sports Council stating that \"the \"meeting of sullied bodies in physical contact\" cannot be approved.\"\nIn post-Cultural Revolution days, the relative strength of rugby in Hong Kong has helped reintroduce the sport into the PRC, and the head of the HKRFU George Simkin introduced a development programme there.\nChinese delegates were amongst those who went to the centenary congress of the International Rugby Football Board in 1986.\nRugby re-emerged in the PRC in 1990, with a club forming at the Beijing Agricultural University (now merged into China Agricultural University) at Beijing. A professor there, Chao Xihuang was introduced to the sport by a Japanese businessman, and set up a couple of sides. Professor Zheng Hongjun is also credited with the early development of rugby in the 1990s.\nThe growth of the sport has been massive. For example, in 1991, there were a mere 30 registered players in China. By 1996, there were over a thousand \"instructors\" alone.\nToday, one segment of Chinese society where rugby is particularly popular is the military. Rugby is an official sport of the People's Liberation Army, with the PLA Sports Institute participating in the highly competitive Hong Kong leagues.\nNotable Chinese rugby players include Zhang Zhiqiang (\"Johnny Zhang\"), who had a stint with the famous Leicester Tigers club in England, and promising young speedster Li Yang, who boasts a time of 10.6 seconds in the 100-metre sprint.\nIn June 2006, a delegation from Leicester rugby club led by Martin Johnson went on a week-long visit to China to promote the game.\nSince the beginning of 2000s, China has concerned more of the rugby sevens instead of the 15-men rugby, due to the Olympic strategy.\nPopularity.\nBy participation.\nIn January 2017, it was reported that China had 76,000 registered rugby players, up 40% on 2014.\nBy interest.\nAccording to World Rugby, in 2018 China and the US are tied for the countries with the most people either \"interested\" or \"very interested\" in rugby union, with 30 million fans in each. This compares to 25 million in India and 15 million in Japan.\nThis interest has been particularly piqued by rugby sevens. For example, it has been reported that 44 million people in China watched sevens at the Rio Olympics — double the number in the UK and second only to the United States worldwide.\nThis contrasts with 2015, when Repucom released survey figures suggesting that only 1% of Chinese people were looking forward to the 2015 Rugby World Cup, down from 4% ahead of the 2011 Rugby World Cup.\nRugby Sevens.\nWithin China.\nAnnual.\nBeginning in 2010, two national championships - two-day sevens' tournaments held in different locations - were held every year. However, in 2015, to help the game gain consistent exposure, the China Rugby Football Association divided the annual Sevens National Championships into four legs held in different cities. As a result, according to Cui Weihong, secretary-general of the China Rugby Football Association, \"[t]he sevens' action will keep going from April to November with a series of scheduled events. We hope this intensive exposure will attract interest from sponsors and sports marketing agencies to help establish a professional league in the near future.\"\nSince 2013, the National University Rugby Sevens Championship has been organized annually, with 2015's event attracting 12 male and eight female university teams from across the country.\nQuadrennial.\nIn a big boost for the sport, Rugby Sevens debuted in the National Games of China in 2013, at the 12th edition of the event, held in 2013 in Liaoning. The coach of the Chinese women's national team, Ben Gollings, said in 2016 that \"[t]he biggest [rugby sevens] competition [in China] is the China Games which is played by all the provinces. This has helped start the development of rugby but when it gets into schools we will see the biggest growth.\"\nDuring the Liaoning tournament, the women's final between Shandong and Beijing proved controversial when, at the insistence of their coach, Beijing players refused to continue playing, after a try was awarded to Shandong by the Spanish referee. The Beijing team was subsequently fined and later issued an apology.\nThe most recent National Games of China was held in Tianjin in 2017.\nChina at international level.\nWomen's Sevens.\nFrom 2019 to 2020, the coach of the Chinese Women's Sevens team was New Zealander Sean Horan, who previously coached the New Zealand Women's Sevens team at the 2016 Rio Olympics. Since late 2020, it has been Scotsman Euan Mackintosh.\nOlympics.\nRio 2016 DNQ.\nIn November 2015, China qualified for the Final 2016 Women's Olympic Qualification Tournament, an event which would determine the 12th and last team to play at Rio 2016. The tournament took place on 25–26 June 2016 in Ireland. China finished second in its pool, but then lost to Spain in the first play-off match, ending its chance of winning the tournament. It nevertheless went on to beat Samoa and Argentina, to clinch the Plate Final. A video report on the team's preparations for the tournament is available at http://www.worldrugby.org/video/171952\nTokyo 2020.\nChina beat Hong Kong 33–0 in the final of the 2019 Asia Rugby Women's Sevens Olympic Qualifying Tournament to qualify for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. At Tokyo, they made the quarterfinals and eventually finished seventh out of 12 teams.\nWorld Cup.\nUAE 2009.\nIn October 2008, China finished third (behind Japan and Thailand) in the Asian qualification tournament to book a place in the 2009 Rugby World Cup Sevens. At the UAE tournament in March 2009, China won the Bowl final, beating the Netherlands, Japan, Italy and Brazil.\nMoscow 2013.\nIn October 2012, China finished second (behind Fiji) in the Asian qualification tournament to book a place in the 2013 Rugby World Cup Sevens. At the Moscow tournament in June 2013, China lost all its pool games but beat Brazil in the Bowl play-offs before losing in the Bowl semi-finals to the Netherlands.\nSan Francisco 2018.\nIn October 2017, China finished second (behind Japan) in the Asian qualification tournament to book a place in the 2018 Rugby World Cup Sevens. At the tournament in July 2018, China finished 12th of 16 teams.\nCape Town 2022.\nIn November 2021, China finished second (behind Japan) in the Asian qualification tournament to book a place in the 2022 Rugby World Cup Sevens.\nHSBC World Rugby Women's Sevens Series.\nAfter winning the qualifying tournament in Hong Kong in September 2014, China became one of the core teams in the 2014–2015 season. However, it won no pool matches in any of the five events, and finished 11th out of 13 teams, failing to secure automatic core team status for the following season.\nIn the qualifying tournament in Dublin in August 2015, China lost 27–5 to Ireland in the quarterfinals, so did not gain a place in the main Sevens Series. In the qualifying tournament in Dublin in June 2016, which doubled as the Final 2016 Women's Olympic Qualification Tournament, China lost to Spain (the eventual winner) in the quarterfinal, so did not gain a place in the main Sevens Series. In the qualifying tournament in Hong Kong in April 2017, China lost 28–14 to Japan (the eventual winner) in the quarterfinal, so did not gain a place in the main Sevens Series.\nAfter winning the qualifying tournament in Hong Kong in April 2018, China became one of the core teams again in the 2018–19 World Rugby Women's Sevens Series. However, after finishing last, they were relegated for the 2019–20 World Rugby Women's Sevens Series (in which they nevertheless featured occasionally as an invitational team).\nAsia Rugby Women's Sevens Series.\nChina participates in the Asian Women's Sevens Championship. It has won the Series five times, most recently in 2014. In September 2017, it lost the final to Japan 19–14.\nAsian Games.\nRugby Sevens has been contested by women at the Asian Games since 2010. China finished runners-up (to Kazakhstan) in 2010, winners (over Japan) in 2014, and runners-up (to Japan) in 2018.\nEast Asian Games.\nRugby Sevens was included in the East Asian Games in 2009 in Hong Kong, and China won the tournament. However, the sport was not retained for the Games in 2013 in Tianjin, reportedly due to budgetary issues, and, in any event, the East Asian Games has now been replaced by an under-18s event.\nMen's Sevens.\nSilicon Valley Sevens Tournament.\nThe Silicon Valley Sevens was a one-off tournament held a month before the World Rugby Sevens Series season began in December 2017 in Dubai. It was held on 4–5 November 2017 in San Jose, California, USA. China was one of the featured teams, alongside a number of heavyweights like Fiji, New Zealand, Australia, and England. China finished 11 out of 12 teams, beating Tonga 34–10 in the play-off for last place.\nShanghai Champions Tournament.\nA Champion of Champions tournament was at one stage planned by Alisports, in conjunction with World Rugby and the Chinese Rugby Football Association.\nThe first edition was to be played in Shanghai's Yangpu District in late October 2017 with the top eight teams from World Rugby Sevens Series invited to compete, alongside the national team of , for the highest ever prize money seen in rugby sevens. However, the first edition was then pushed back to 2018, and delays in the roll-out of the Alisports rugby funding suggest the tournament has been abandoned.\nOlympics.\nRio 2016 DNQ.\nIn November 2015, China attempted to qualify Rio 2016, at the 2015 ARFU Men's Sevens Championships held in Hong Kong. However, it finished fifth, behind Japan (which qualified directly for Rio), and Hong Kong, South Korea and Sri Lanka (which went through to the Final 2016 Men's Olympic Qualification Tournament, which would determine the 12th and last team to play at Rio 2016).\nTokyo 2020 DNQ.\nThe 2019 Asia Men's Sevens Championship doubled as the Olympic qualifying tournament. China was eliminated after losing (after extra time) in the semi-final against eventual winners South Korea. However, because it finished in the top 4 it qualified for the 2020 Men's Rugby Sevens Final Olympic Qualification Tournament, held in Monaco in June 2021 (postponed from June 2020 due to COVID), from which it could have qualified for Tokyo 2020. Unfortunately, China had to withdraw from the tournament (which was won by Ireland) due to constraints caused by the pandemic.\nParis 2024.\nThe CRFU has as an official objective for the men's sevens team to qualify for the 2024 Olympics.\nWorld Cup.\nCape Town 2022.\nChina attempted to qualify for the 2022 Rugby World Cup Sevens through the qualifying tournament in Dubai on 19–20 November 2021. However, they finished 4th, behind Hong Kong, South Korea and Japan, with only the top two teams progressing.\nHSBC World Rugby Sevens Series.\nChina has not yet qualified for the HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series.\nAsian Sevens Series.\nChina has competed in the Asian Sevens Series since it began in 2009. A video of a 2015 match against Thailand is available online. China finished 4th in 2016, 5th in 2017, and 5th in 2018. In some years, the tournaments in the Series include a China Sevens event. China made the final of the 2019 China event, having beaten favourites Japan in the semi-finals, but lost out to Hong Kong by 7-14.\nAsian Games.\nRugby Sevens has been contested by men at the Asian Games since 1998. China's best placing was third in 2006. In the 2018 edition, China finished 6th out of 12 teams.\nRugby XVs.\nWithin China.\nWomen's and Men's XVs.\nRugby XVs does not attract the same level of support as rugby sevens. For example, while the provinces that compete in the National Games of China all have sevens teams, there are no regional XVs sides and no national rugby XV competition. According to the UK newspaper the Daily Telegraph, the decision by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 2009 to introduce rugby sevens to the Olympic Games “has effectively halted the development of 15-a-side rugby in China. Beijing reacted by immediately gearing its national rugby system towards sevens, instructing the universities to focus on the format.” Zhang Zhiqiang, the former China national side captain, added in 2015 that “[o]ur national system is geared towards an Olympic strategy, and sevens, as one of the Olympic events, gets more attention.” \nYouth XVs.\nIn June 2016, the inaugural National Youth 15's tournament was held in Qingdao in association with the Qingdao Sharks Rugby Club, one of the first non-university, non-expat rugby clubs formed in China (in 1998). The event was won by Jinan. The president of the China Rugby Football Union stated that the tournament \"bodes well for the development of the 15’s game in China as the event has created a lot of interest in other Provinces to host future 15’s tournaments\".\nClubs.\nThere is currently no professional XV rugby competition within the Chinese mainland. However, it has been reported that a number of east coast clubs are likely to be part of a proposed league run by the Chinese Rugby Football Association beginning in 2018.\nThere are a number of amateur clubs which compete domestically for the annual All China Rugby Cup. Teams compete in one of four divisions, based on their location (e.g. the North China division or the South China division). At the end of the season, the top finisher in every division qualifies for the All China Rugby Cup. Meanwhile, the second-place team from each division lands in the four-team China Plate Final.\nThe 2017 All China Rugby Cup was won by the Shanghai Silver Dragons (of the Shanghai Rugby Football Club) against the Guangzhou Rams, 46–16.\nThe social clubs are dominated by expatriates, including the Shanghai Rugby Football Club, the Beijing Devils, and the Hangzhou Harlequins. The Shanghai and Beijing teams play domestically but also in the Yellow Sea Cup against a team from Seoul, South Korea.\nSome clubs have a native-Chinese base (such as Nongda aka the China Agricultural University and the Beijing Flying Horses Rugby Club) or have made significant efforts to reach out to native Chinese (such as the Qingdao Sharks Rugby Club).\nMore than 10 universities in China, including the China Agricultural University, Beijing Normal University and South China Agriculture University, have introduced majors in athletic training with rugby as a specialty.\nChina at international level.\nWomen's XVs.\nThe China women's national rugby union team first played in 2006 and continued regularly until 2012. They began playing again in 2019, when they won the Asia Rugby Women’s Division 1 title with victory over both Singapore and the Philippines. However they later (just) lost a two-match playoff against Kazakhstan, so did not gain a spot in the 2021 Asian Women's Rugby Championship (which they won in 2006 and 2011), which would have given them a chance to qualify for the 2021 Women's World Cup.\nAs of 22 November 2021, China's women's XV side was ranked 23rd in the world.\nMen's XVs.\nRanking.\nThe China national rugby union team first played in 1997. As of 28 May 2018, China's men's XV side was ranked 87th in the world, down from 68th on 14 November 2016. Its highest ranking was 37th, which was achieved in the early 2000s. Under the points system used by World Rugby to rank rugby nations, China regularly scored between 46 and 49 points in the period 2003–2009. Since 2010, it has typically scored between 39 and 41 points.\nBecause they play so seldom, and with little media coverage, it is difficult to judge the standard of the men's XV team. In 2018, an opponent with experience in club rugby in Dunedin, New Zealand, compared the standard to \"Dunedin premier two grade\" and stated: \"The Chinese side was huge but they were pretty robotic. They just did a lot of pods and it was all pretty slow. Not very expansive.\" A pod is a group of players who attack the same space together. When it is used correctly, defenders don't know which attacker will get the ball.\nAsian Rugby Championship.\nChina has been as high as Division 1 of the Asia Rugby Championship, most recently in 2008 when it was grouped with Singapore, Chinese Taipei and Sri Lanka. However, between 2015 and 2019, the team was in Division 3 East of the Asian Rugby Championship, alongside countries like Guam, Brunei and Laos.\nIn the 2019 Asia Rugby Championship division tournaments, China went unbeaten against India and Indonesia, with 137 points for and only 27 against, gaining promotion to Division 2 in the process. Participation in Division 2 will enable the team to attempt qualification for the 2023 Rugby World Cup.\nBilateral Matches.\nChina plays in what was intended to be an annual Kublai Khan Cup against Mongolia. In the inaugural match in May 2015, China won 46–19. No further contests for the Cup have been recorded.\nWorld Cup.\nIn its attempt to qualify for the 2015 Rugby World Cup, China participated in the 2015 Rugby World Cup – Asia qualification, as part of the 2012 Asian Five Nations Division 2. It lost its first match to Malaysia 89–0, and so was eliminated from the qualification process.\nChina was not eligible to attempt to qualify for the 2019 Rugby World Cup, because only teams in the Top Three (generally Japan, Hong Kong and South Korea), Division 1, and Division 2 of the Asian Rugby Championship can participate in the qualification process.\nMilitary.\nThe People’s Liberation Army XV team represents China in the International Defence Rugby Competition, which is held alongside the Rugby World Cup. It participated in the inaugural 2011 edition, held in New Zealand and Australia. Results included a 59–12 loss to the Tongan Defence Services. However, it did not appear in the 2015 edition held in England or in the 2019 edition held in Japan. According to Simon Chadwick, professor of sports enterprise at the University of Salford, \"[t]he Chinese armed forces have been playing rugby [XVs] for a number of years. They have believed that rugby is one of the best ways to develop the skills of their personnel, involving as it does strength, teamwork and decision-making.”\nThe People’s Liberation Army XV team, which is stationed at the army’s sports institute in Guangzhou, also competes in an annual match against the Hong Kong Disciplined Services team in the TK Lai Cup, named after Hong Kong's Secretary for Security. The match has traditionally been played in December but in 2016 was played during Taipan Day in April, with the PLA replaced by a new Hong Kong team, the Tin Shui Wai Pandas.\nThe team has also been a part of the second-tier rugby competition in Hong Kong.\nYouth XVs.\nChina did not participate in the Asian Under-19 Rugby Championship held in Malaysia in December 2016 nor in the Asian Under-19 Rugby Championship held in Hong Kong and Sri Lanka in December 2017.\nChina's national youth team toured New Zealand between 18 and 26 June 2017 to play against Hamilton Boys' High School in Hamilton and to visit the Rotorua Boys' High School Academy and the Bay of Plenty Steamers in Tauranga.\nEfforts to develop rugby.\nPositive developments.\nTeam China Initiative.\nIn October 2016, World Rugby announced its Team China initiative, signed in partnership with company Alisports and China's rugby football association. Alisports committed to invest $100m over the 2016-2026 period, in an effort to further popularise both formats of the game.\nAccording to World Rugby, the project was to initially focus on four main goals: \n(i) Establishment of first-ever professional men's and women's 15s leagues and national sevens programmes\n(ii) World Rugby's Get Into Rugby mass participation programme (see below) to be run in 10,000 universities and schools in 20 provinces with the target of attracting and retaining one million new players over the next five years\n(iii) Development programmes to achieve the recruitment and training of 30,000 coaches and 15,000 match officials by 2020\n(iv) A major rugby marketing and promotion initiative that would see Alisports invest in nationwide marketing and promotional programmes while carrying rugby content on its TV and digital platforms and Alibaba, the world's biggest e-commerce platform\nProgress with the Team China Initiative was slow, however, notably due to \"governance changes\" within Chinese rugby. World Rugby CEO Breet Gosper stated in April 2018: \"I’d have to say it's been slow progress, the partnership. It's slower than we would have liked. Things aren’t [as] easy and rapid in China as we would have liked in the areas we are dealing with. It's been slowed down recently by a change in the government's administrative approach in China and what we have done is put [this programme] on hold for a month or two until we get clarity on who is leading rugby in China.\" Alisports CEO and founder Zhang Dazhong stated in September 2018: \"First we want to cultivate the popularity of rugby in China so we will start with that first, and then once we've started then we will think about the goals, like this $100m promise. We will start with campus rugby first... We will not be involved with any club, federations or national level regarding the sport.\"\nIn April 2019, World Rugby announced that the Team China Initiative had finally been abandoned.\nGet Into Rugby (GIR) Programme.\nIn 2017, 140,986 Chinese boys and girls took the GIR programme, learning basic rugby skills. This was the fourth highest GIR figure in the world, behind Colombia (216,341), South Africa (170,919), and India (160,378).\nIMPACT Beyond RWC 2019.\nIMPACT Beyond is a World Rugby initiative which has been in place since 2013, and has previously included IMPACT Beyond RWC 2015 and IMPACT Beyond Rio 2016. In May 2017, the IMPACT Beyond RWC 2019 project was launched. It is a partnership between World Rugby, Asia Rugby and the Japan Rugby Football Union and is the official 'legacy' programme for Rugby World Cup 2019. One of its four 'pillars' is 'growing the game across Asia', and as such it appears to have subsumed Asia Rugby's Asia Rugby One Million Project, which uses Get Into Rugby programmes and aims to achieve 1 million new players across Asia (making a total of 2 million) by the start of the 2019 Rugby World Cup (in China, this is being run in 4 locations: Beijing, Shanghai, Liaoning &amp; Shandong).\nBilateral Agreements.\nIn October 2017, the Chinese rugby football association signed a memorandum of understanding with the Fijian rugby football union, under which Fiji will supply coaches to help develop Chinese sevens and fifteens rugby.\nIn December 2017, the Chinese rugby football association signed a memorandum of understanding with the Samoa Rugby Union, under which the Samoa Rugby Union will \"promote the sport in China and also provide an environment for C.F.R.A. teams to visit and learn from local teams and competitions on [the] island\". In this regard, China will take part in Samoa's Marist International Sevens tournament in February 2018.\nSearch for China-eligible players.\nIn late 2017, it was reported that advertisements had appeared on social media targeting people of Chinese descent living abroad who may wish to represent China in rugby. Already the search has been successful, as \"Peter Wong will become the first Fijian to represent China in rugby sevens\".\nRapid Rugby Championship.\nAustralian billionaire Andrew Forrest is launching the Rapid Rugby Championship in 2019, featuring women's and men's 7s and XVs teams from Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Fiji, Samoa and Japan, who will play in a round-robin format from February–June. According to Business Insider Australia, \"Forrest is hoping to expand the competition further in the next two years with teams from China, India, the UAE, Sri Lanka and Korea\".\nNew CRFA Leadership.\nIn April 2019, Chen Yingbiao was elected as the new president of the Chinese Rugby Football Association (CRFA) and — unlike many of his predecessors — he actually has a rugby background through his athletic association with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). Chen’s is ambitious: In his opening statement he said he would resign if the Chinese women’s sevens team did not qualify for the Tokyo Olympics.\nChallenges.\nIn 2012, ARFU secretary-general Ross Mitchell was reported as saying that China's rugby administration \"find it difficult to field their best team in international sevens competitions because their PLA players are not allowed permission to go overseas\".\nIn 2016, Jin Mengwei, wife of Johnny Zhang and director of a youth rugby camp based at CAU which offers students from nearby primary schools training in sevens rugby, stated that \"[t]he biggest challenge is the strong perception among parents and school principals generally that rugby is a dangerous game, even at the junior level, which features the safer touch version and uses protective gear.\"\nIn 2016, Xu Fangjie, coach of the Liaoning provincial men's team, said that \"[t]he biggest problem is that we don't have enough games to play. If people can't see us play on a regular basis throughout the year, how can we promote the sport?\"\nAlso in 2016, women's sevens coach Ben Gollings referred to \"red tape\" and also noted, non-judgmentally, that many of the players representing the country grew up playing other sports, and therefore do not necessarily have a personal passion for playing rugby. Similarly, the club captain of the expatriate side Beijing Devils, Steven Lynch, said in 2015 that “[t]here really needs to be deeper roots of rugby at grass roots level for it to succeed in China.” \nIn 2017, World Rugby decided that, from 2020, the residency requirement to qualify for a national team would be extended from three to five years. One commentator has questioned whether this might make it more difficult for developing nations like China to compete internationally.\nIn 2018, an ex-pat player at the Wuhan Baiji team in China, Martin Sullivan, was quoted as saying: \"The main thing which is actually holding back Chinese rugby is the lack of facilities, lack of grass pitches, lack of trained coaches and lack of understanding of rugby.\"\nIn 2019, a Shanghai-based lawyer who played for the PLA team in the early 2000s, Liu Kai, was quoted in the online news magazine Sixth Tone as saying that poor decision-making by China’s sports authorities was to blame, in particular the decision to focus on just one version of the sport (rugby sevens). The magazine noted that, in 2002, \"the Olympic Council of Asia decided that only the seven-a-side version of rugby, rugby sevens, rather than the traditional 15-a-side game, rugby union, would be played at future editions of the Asian Games — a decision that convinced the Chinese authorities to halt support for rugby union [XVs], according to Liu. 'This caused most of China’s 15s teams to fade away,' says Liu ... 'The CRFA should be promoting the sport, but they’re not,' says Liu. 'So, us diehard rugby fans are left to do it ourselves' ... China’s sports organizations, meanwhile, should be run by people with real experience and knowledge of the games they are promoting, rather than by bureaucrats, according to Liu.\"\nRelated regions.\nHong Kong and Macau.\nRugby union has an uninterrupted history in Hong Kong, where arguably the most successful sevens tournament is held. The national team of Hong Kong also participates in the Asian Five Nations. However, Rugby union has a much smaller presence in Macau.\nTaiwan.\nRugby union has an unbroken history in Taiwan, but the Chinese Civil War and souring of relations with the mainland has meant that it was effectively cut off.\nNonetheless, Taiwan, playing as Chinese Taipei, has a very successful rugby sevens side, and it is ranked in fourth position in East Asia, after Japan, Hong Kong and South Korea."

The only threat to Battaglin's lead was Pedro Muñoz.\nThe entire Teka team withdrew from the race withdrawing potential favourites Marino Lejarreta and Alberto Fernández. Battaglin and his Inoxpran team withstood the challenge from the Spanish and brought Battaglin to his first grand tour victory. Three days later after Battaglin's triumph in Spain, he began the 1981 Giro d'Italia which he would win becoming the second rider after Eddy Merckx to win the Vuelta-Giro double."

        "title": "Canada Olympic Park bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton track",
        "text": "The Canada Olympic Park bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton track is a bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton track located in Calgary, Alberta. Part of Canada Olympic Park, it hosted the bobsleigh and luge competitions at the 1988 Winter Olympics. This track is one of only two of its type in the world to be featured in a non-documentary film when it was part of the 1993 American film \"Cool Runnings\" which loosely followed the Jamaican Bobsled Team during their competition in bobsleigh at the 1988 Games (The other was the 1981 British film \"For Your Eyes Only\" which included scenes from the bobsleigh track in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy.).\nHistory.\nIn 1981, Calgary was awarded the 1988 Winter Olympics over Falun, Sweden and Cortina d'Ampezzo. The track was constructed on a fast-track program running from fall 1984 to spring 1986. This was done with the help of East German technology and a consulting firm from Canada. It was the first combined track in North America and only the second of its type on the continent (Lake Placid, New York in the United States bobsleigh and luge tracks were separate when Calgary's construction was completed in spring 1986 though the Lake Placid track would be rebuilt as a combination track in January 2000.). During the 1988 Winter Olympics, the bobsleigh team from Jamaica debuted at these games, but crashed out during the third run of the four-man event. The story of the team would later be part of the 1993 film \"Cool Runnings\" with scenes done at the track. Skeleton was introduced to the track in the late 1980s with the track hosting the FIBT World Championships for skeleton in 1992. An indoor iced push facility near the track opened up in 2001. When competition does not occur on the track, it offers programs for bobsleigh and luge open to the public.\nOn 5 February 2019, WinSport (the operator of the track) announced that due to an $8 million CAD funding shortfall, the track would cease operations after the completion of the IBSF World Cup that year. On 3 March 2019, the track closed indefinitely, pending the funding of a $25 million CAD renovation. While the sliding facilities have closed for winter operations (due to the refrigeration system needing total replacement), the track would still be available for summer training and tourism, and the Ice House would remain open.\nTrack technical details.\nCosting C$ 27 million to complete, the track consisted of 48 reinforced concrete sections with five separate starting points. The facility is designed of that like a tuning fork with separate bobsleigh and luge start houses, selected to lessen construction and maintenance costs. The two portions of the track merge at turn five prior to the Omega combination curve. Lined with of refrigeration coolant, the track can hold ice at air temperatures up to 20 deg C (68 deg F). Sunscreens were installed on curves directly exposed to the sunlight to keep the track smooth and prevent melting. Electronic timing systems include double photo sensors at the start and finish positions of the track and artificial lighting is used to allow for night runs on the track. Lighting was adjusted at the request of the host television broadcaster (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) prior to the games to ensure proper video coverage for the 1988 games.\nRenovation.\nOn 5 April 2017 a $20 million CAD renovation was announced as part of WinSport's ongoing intention to operate the track in addition to Calgary's potential bid for the 2026 Olympic Winter Games. Despite a referendum rejecting Calgary's 2026 bid and subsequent closure of the track, WinSport announced renovations will begin and proceed as funding becomes available. On 9 October 2019 the first phase of the renovation project for the track began with the demolition of the bobsleigh/skeleton start portion of the track (curves 1–5). The bobsleigh/skeleton start is being removed to reduce operating costs and make the track more exciting for those athletes who will now start on the luge portion of the track. Until the renovation of the track is complete—including the replacement of the entire refrigeration system, the track will remain closed. Demolition of the track is scheduled to be completed by December 2021.\nStatistics.\nMen's start at the tower start house (currently demolished) at the top of the track while the women's is at the regular start house at the top of the track.\nThe turn names were initially given during the 1988 Winter Olympic broadcast (ABC in the United States). All curves shown are bobsleigh curves. The luge section joins the bobsleigh and skeleton section at turn five. Turns 1 through 5 do not have turn names.\nIncidents and accidents.\n6 February 2016 - In the early hours of the morning of 6 February, 8 teenagers broke into the Canada Olympic Park's track and, using toboggans, began a slide down from the Bobsleigh start. At turn 5, the teens struck a large track switching element that had been used to configure the track for Luge. The impact with the track switch and the chains holding it in place resulted in death for two of the teens, and serious injuries to the other 6. In November, 2018 a provincial court judge who had been leading an investigation into the incident ruled it to be an accident. The judge also recommended a slew of security enhancements (including: motion-triggered alarms and lights, better signage and barriers, and more effective training of staff) to help prevent another incident of this nature—several of which WinSport had already adopted prior to the ruling."

The Sports Club Program at UB is under the management of the Student Association. The club participates in the sport of rugby union.\nUB Rugby has competed in the East conference of Division 1-A rugby since the fall of 2014. \nUB Rugby joined the East Conference because they wanted to improve and play the highest competition possible. The East Conference includes some of the best college rugby teams in the country, such as Army, Penn State, and Kutztown. UB is led by Head Coach Owen Lawther.\nThe University at Buffalo Rugby Football Club competes in Division 1 of the New York State Rugby Conference. In the fall of 2007 the UBRFC started a Division 3 team playing in the Excelsior West Division of the\nNew York State Rugby Conference. UB rugby won four championships of the NYSRC Upstate Division 1 Tournament.\nHistory.\nThe UBRFC was founded in 1966. It was originally called the Queens Rugby Football Club. In 1971 the club gave up its ties to the university and became the Buffalo Old Boys men's club. In 1976, a university team was again organized as the \"Mad Turtles\" playing within the New York Upstate Rugby Union (URU). Team jersey colors were sky blue with a band of red-white-navy-white-red. The team negotiated a sponsorship in 1980 with Koch's Brewery of Dunkirk, N.Y. and changed their team name to the \"UB Black Horses\", named after Koch's Black Horse Ale. The uniforms changed at this time to solid black with an embroidered Black Horse Ale patch on the left chest, In 1984 the sponsorship ended when the UB Student Association funded the team and they again became the \"Mad Turtles\", switching colors to crimson jerseys with crimson and gold hooped sleeves. At this time they were also an official member of the New York State Rugby Conference (NYSRC). In the 1984 season the team claimed a victory in the NYSRC Collegiate Championship, qualifying for USA Rugby's Collegiate National Championship for the first time.\nIn 2010, the team was ranked No. 1 in the nation by American Rugby News capturing the NYSRC title. UB Rugby had another successful season in 2011, reaching the playoffs, and defeating Southern Connecticut to reach the quarterfinals. In the 2012–13 season, UB Rugby had three players make the All-Empire Conference Team.\nIn 2014, UB Rugby has a successful beginning to its participation in the D1-A East Conference, notching up a win against Notre Dame College.\nLocation.\nThe UBRFC Bulls play all of their home games at the \"Rugby Pitch\" located at the Ellicott Complex on the UB's North Campus."

        "text": "The 2008 Buffalo Funds - NAIA Division I men's basketball tournament was held from March 19 to 25 at Municipal Auditorium in Kansas City, Missouri. The 71st annual NAIA basketball tournament features 32 teams playing in a single-elimination format.\nThe official announcement of the 32-team field for the 71st Annual Buffalo Funds-NAIA Division I National Championship occurred late on Tuesday, March 11, with the announcement of the official bracket on Wednesday, March 12 at 5 p.m. CST. Early opening round action between No. 5 Mountain State and Olivet Nazarene went into two long overtimes. This caused a backup in game schedules. The late game featuring Southern Nazarene University and Point Loma Nazarene University was moved back from 10:30pm CST to 11:30pm CST. The late start caused many of the 3,000 fans to leave after halftime. Near the end of the game SNU rallied to tie the SeaLions 67–67 with 14 secs left sending the game into overtime. The game finally ended around 1:30am CST with Point Loma pulling off the upset over SNU. It was the latest finishing NAIA tournament game. Games for the next day started in about 6 hours.\nThe championship game featured defending champions 7 seed Oklahoma City University and 5 seed Mountain State. Oklahoma City won the game, giving them back to back National Championships in win over Mountain State (75-72). Oklahoma City is the first team since Life University (Ga.) won the '99-'00 titles.

        "title": "1961 Rose Bowl",
        "text": "The 1961 Rose Bowl was the 47th Rose Bowl game, played on January 2, 1961, in Pasadena, California. The #6 Washington Huskies defeated the top-ranked Minnesota Golden Gophers, 17–7. Washington quarterback Bob Schloredt returned from a mid-season injury was named the Player Of The Game for the second straight year. As New Year's Day fell on a Sunday, the major bowl games were played on Monday.\nThis was the first season of the new agreement with the Athletic Association of Western Universities (AAWU) to send their champion. Its predecessor, the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC), had dissolved after the 1958 season. The Big Ten was no longer in a formal agreement with the Rose Bowl following the demise of the PCC: Big Ten champion Minnesota received and accepted an \"at-large\" invitation.\nThe Great Rose Bowl Hoax occurred during halftime. As seen by an estimated 30 million television viewers, students from nearby Caltech altered the plans for the Washington card stunts, which spelled \"CALTECH\" instead of \"HUSKIES\" and showed the Caltech Beaver mascot instead of the Washington Husky.\nTeams.\nThe Pacific Coast Conference (PCC), from which the \"West\" representative was historically selected, dissolved in early 1959 following a pay-for-play scandal. A new conference, the AAWU, commonly referred to as the \"Big Five\", formed in 1959 with the four California schools (Cal, Stanford, USC, and UCLA) and Washington. For scheduling, former PCC members Oregon, Oregon State, and Washington State dropped UCLA and USC, with the exception of Oregon State at USC. Idaho, who was not part of the scandal but had become uncompetitive, was dropped from the schedules of all the AAWU members. The PCC agreement with the Rose bowl was dissolved for the 1959 season, but former member Washington was invited to the game and demolished Wisconsin.\nFor the 1960 season, the AAWU contracted a new agreement which went into effect with this game. The Big Ten agreement also was dissolved, but the Big Ten had authorized its members to accept Rose Bowl invitations at their discretion. A new agreement with the Big Ten would not be reached until 1962, which became effective with the 1963 Rose Bowl.\n1960 Washington Huskies.\nThe 1960 Huskies defeated the College of the Pacific and former PCC member Idaho 23–0 to open the season. Washington lost to Navy at Husky Stadium, ending a seven-game winning streak. The Midshipmen finished the regular season at but lost to Missouri in the Orange Bowl. The Huskies won at Stanford and beat UCLA The Huskies continued on with a full PCC schedule, playing Oregon State in Portland and hosting Oregon in Seattle, winning both non-league games by a single point.\nThe November 5 game against USC at the L.A. Coliseum was the deciding factor in the Rose Bowl race, with the Huskies blanking the Trojans The Huskies beat the Cal Bears at home to win the AAWU (or \"Big Five\") championship outright, undefeated in conference play. The final game of the regular season was the Apple Cup (not yet named), where the Huskies narrowly escaped with an win in Spokane over cross-state (and non-conference) rival Washington State to finish the regular season at Ranked sixth by the AP writers poll, the defending Rose Bowl champions were fifth in the UPI coaches poll. The final polls were released in late November, at the end of the regular season.\n1960 Minnesota Golden Gophers.\nThe 1960 Gophers came to the Rose Bowl as the #1 team in the nation, and were favored by a touchdown over Washington. The Gophers were led by Sandy Stephens, the first African-American All-American starting quarterback at the school (but not in the history of the Rose Bowl, which would have been the 1922 Rose Bowl). The Gophers had an early 26–14 non-conference win at #12 Nebraska. They shut out both Indiana and Northwestern, then also blanked Michigan 10–0 at Michigan Stadium to win the Little Brown Jug. A win over non-conference Kansas State put Minnesota at #3. The next game at #1 Iowa was one of the most notable games in the Floyd of Rosedale rivalry. Minnesota won 27–10 (and the pig) and were top-ranked, but then lost to Purdue the next week. A 26–14 win over Wisconsin on NCAA television put them back at #1 to finish the season. The Gophers were tied with Iowa in the Big Ten standings, each with a loss. The final AP poll of November 29 was one of the closest ever: Minnesota with 17½ first-place votes, Mississippi 16, and Iowa 12½.\nGame summary.\nThe weather in Pasadena on January 2 was clear and sunny. Washington wore their dark home jerseys (actually deep blue), gold pants, and gold helmets. Minnesota wore white away jerseys with maroon with gold shoulder stripes, gold pants, and white helmets. The ceremonial pregame coin toss to determine first possession employed a souvenir gold dollar minted for Alaska's statehood in 1959.\nThe Huskies dominated the first half, scoring all 17 points. Minnesota led in all the final statistics, but the most telling one was its passing game: Gopher quarterback Sandy Stephens completed only two of ten passes for 21 yards and was intercepted three times. MVP Bob Schloredt completed only two of four passes for 16 yards (no interceptions), but was the game's leading rusher with 68 yards on five carries. The most enduring story of the game was the Caltech card stunt at halftime.\nHalftime.\nThe Minnesota marching band performed first, followed by UW band, when the card stunts began. The Washington card section was on the east side of the Rose Bowl stadium, facing the press box and television cameras. The NBC national television broadcast was trained on the band and card stunts. The 14th card stunt design displayed \"CALTECH\" instead of \"HUSKIES\" in big block letters on a white background. The announcers and the stadium fell silent for several moments before breaking into laughter.\nAftermath.\nWashington quarterback Bob Schloredt was named Player of the Game for a second consecutive year, the first to repeat; he was the a co-Player of the Game the previous year. Three other players have subsequently repeated as Rose Bowl Players of the Game: Charles White (USC), Ron Dayne (Wisconsin), and Vince Young (Texas).\nMinnesota was still the AP and UPI national champion, as those final polls were released in late November and did not consider the bowl results.\nIowa, Missouri, Ole Miss, and Washington have all been recognized as national champions for the 1960 season by various organizations.\nFinal polls in January (after the bowls) did not occur until much later. The AP had a January poll after the 1965 season, but not the next two; it went permanently post-bowl for the 1968 season. The final UPI coaches poll did not move until the 1974 season (January 1975), following the bowl defeats of UPI champions Texas (1970) and Alabama (1973). In five of the next six seasons the top-ranked team in the UPI poll at the end of the regular season lost its bowl game; the exception was Pittsburgh (1976)."

During the next season, he shined in ULEB's Eurocup, averaging 18.5 points per game, but also showing great versatility and leading the competition in steals with 2.9 per game. Roma reached the quarter-final and Hawkins showed he was ready for Europe's highest stage, the Euroleague.\nSpending two more seasons in Roma, Hawkins helped the team regain something of its past glory by qualifying twice to the Euroleague's Top 16. During those two Euroleague seasons, he averaged 13.6 and 10.9 points per game. Nevertheless, at the end of the 2007–08 season, team manager Dejan Bodiroga decided not to renew his contract.\nArmani Jeans Milano.\nAfter that, Hawkins signed with another Italian Euroleague team, Armani Jeans Milano, leading it up to the finals, lost against Montepaschi Siena. On February 15, 2009 he scored a career-high 35 points against Montegranaro, also adding 10 rebounds.\nMontepaschi Siena.\nIn 2009, he moved to Montepaschi Siena where he played with former Atlantic 10 rival Romain Sato.

However, Hawkins failed a doping test after the Gaziantep Büyükşehir Belediyespor game in December 2012 and was banned from professional basketball for four years by the Turkish Basketball Federation. The substance detected in his blood was Methylecgonine, a common metabolite of cocaine. After the decision, Hawkins’ contract with Galatasaray was cancelled.\nThe Basketball Tournament (TBT).\nIn the summer of 2015, Hawkins competed in The Basketball Tournament for the City of Gods. Alongside former NBA players James Gist, Dermarr Johnson, Pops Mensah-Bonsu and Michael Sweetney, Hawkins helped guide the City of Gods to the 2015 TBT Championship Game where they lost 84–71 to Overseas Elite.

Lima withdrew as organizer and the tournament was delayed until a new host could be found. With Japan chosen as host (the first time the World Championships were played in Asia), the tournament went ahead in January 1967. Due to international political tensions caused by the Cold War, hosts Japan warned it would not display the flags nor have the national anthems of North Korea and East Germany played. Both teams together with the Eastern Bloc countries (Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Soviet Union) and China forfeited the tournament, leaving only four teams as participants.\nSquads.\nSource:\nVenue.\nSource:\nFormat.\nThe tournament was played in a single round-robin format, all four participant teams in a single pool and played each other once."

        "title": "Thomas Williams (American football)",
        "text": "Thomas Ray Williams (born December 25, 1984) is a former American football linebacker. He was drafted by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the fifth round of the 2008 NFL Draft. He played college football at Southern California. Williams has been a member of the Seattle Seahawks, New England Patriots, Buffalo Bills, and Carolina Panthers. In 2011, he suffered a neck injury that ended his season. The next year, the same injury forced him to retire from his football career.\nWilliams is now a motivational speaker. He has traveled worldwide speaking to different corporations, athletes and students on how to \"fully maximize their potential.\" In 2014 Thomas R. Williams became a published author after writing his autobiography, \"Permission to DREAM.\" Williams is also a collegiate guest lecturer.\nThomas works close with the Wounded Warrior Project. He focuses on helping soldiers transitioning back from combat.\nEarly years.\nWilliams played high school football at Vacaville High School. When it came to deciding where to attend college, his final choices were University of Notre Dame and the University of Southern California. Finding them equals in many areas; Williams decided on USC due in part to the diversity of the Los Angeles area as well as the career networking, as he was uncertain he would be able to eventually move on to the NFL.\nCollege career.\nThomas R. Williams entered USC in the 2003 recruiting class that included Reggie Bush and LenDale White. Williams started 14 games at 3 different positions (including fullback) while playing college football at USC. He was all-Pac-10 honorable mention in 2007 and was invited to the East West Shrine Game and the Hula Bowl. Williams career stats include, 74 tackles, 1 sack, 3 fumbles forced, 5 passes defensed, 5 tackles for loss, 3 interceptions, and 37 interception return yards. In 2007 Williams had 56 tackles. He had 6 tackles in the 2008 Rose Bowl.\nDuring his time with the Trojans, Williams received guidance and feedback from veteran linebackers such as Lofa Tatupu, Matt Grootegoed, Dallas Sartz, Collin Ashton, and Oscar Lua. In order to see more playing time against the more experienced linebackers ahead of him, Williams focused and excelled at special teams play, particularly kickoff coverage. During his redshirt freshman year he was an active member of the 2004 National Championship team, where he played behind Sartz at the strong-side spot. Early in the 2004 season, Williams was nicknamed \"The Hitman\" by coach Pete Carroll for his performance on special teams; the name stuck with him for his career at USC.\nDuring the 2005 season, Williams again backed up Sartz, but moved into the starting lineup for six games after Sartz suffered a shoulder injury; he also started twice in the middle and learned the weak-side responsibilities as well. During the 2006 season, when the Trojans fullbacks were decimated by injury, members of the offense such as Ryan Kalil, Sam Baker, and John David Booty, asked him to switch positions to fullback, a position he had played in high school. Thus Williams started twice at fullback and played several games that season on both offense and defense. Over the years, Williams played all three linebacker positions. Williams teammates voted him the team's most inspirational player in the 2007 season; he finished the regular season as the third-leading tackler among linebackers with 3½ tackles for losses, an interception and two forced fumbles on a defense that ranked second nationally.\nThomas R. Williams graduated from USC in May 2008 with a degree in sociology.\nProfessional career.\nPre-draft.\nWilliams was invited to the NFL Combine.\nJacksonville Jaguars.\nWilliams was selected 155th overall by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the 2008 NFL draft; he was the first person from his high school to be drafted in the NFL since Vince Newsome was drafted 97th overall in the 1983. Williams signed a four-year contract with the Jaguars. He played in six games for the Jaguars in 2008, recording one tackle. He was waived on September 5, 2009.\nSeattle Seahawks.\nWilliams was signed to the Seattle Seahawks practice squad on September 8, 2009. He was released on September 30.\nNew England Patriots.\nWilliams was signed to the New England Patriots practice squad on November 10, 2009. He was promoted to the Patriots' active roster on January 6, 2010, in advance of their playoff game against the Baltimore Ravens, for which he was inactive. He was waived during final cuts on September 4, 2010.\nBuffalo Bills.\nWilliams was signed to the Buffalo Bills practice squad on October 12, 2010 and later added to the active roster. He played in two games for the Bills before being waived on December 11, 2010.\nCarolina Panthers.\nWilliams was signed to the Carolina Panthers practice squad on December 15, 2010, and was released on March 13, 2012.\nTampa Bay Buccaneers.\nOn July 26, 2012, Williams was signed to a 2-year deal by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers."

        "text": "John \"Snooks\" Kelley (July 11, 1907 – April 10, 1986) was an American ice hockey coach. Kelley was coach of the Boston College Eagles ice hockey team for 36 years. Kelley won the 1949 NCAA ice hockey title and was the first coach to win 500 games in the NCAA. He was inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame in 1974\nCareer.\nKelley arrived at Boston College in 1925 after attending Boston College High School. He was a two sport athlete for the Eagles, playing both baseball and ice hockey. Kelley finished his collegiate playing career following his graduation in 1930. Kelley's graduation came just after hockey was removed from as a varsity sport due to the Great Depression.\nOn January 8, 1933, Kelley agreed to coach a group of BC students while he was completing his teaching at Cambridge Latin. The position offered no pay, and forced him to give up playing with the Boston Hockey Club, but it was the beginning of a career that would last until 1972. Kelley's coaching career was put on hold with the outbreak of World War II. In 1942 Kelley joined the United States Navy and remained enlisted until 1946, before returning to coaching.\nJust three years after serving with the Navy Kelley lead his Boston College team over Dartmouth and win the NCAA national championship. It would be the first championship won by an Eastern school. The 1949 National Championship was the only one of his career, however he would lead the Eagles back to the title game in 1965. Boston College lost the championship game to Michigan Tech 8–2.\nOn December 26, 1952 Boston’s famous Beanpot Tournament was established. Kelley enjoyed great success in the tournament winning 5 of the first 10. Some have pointed to his success in the Beanpot leading to Kelley gaining his stature as the face of BC hockey. Kelley coached BC to eight Beanpot titles in thirteen years, including three in a row from 1963-65.\nIn addition to the National Championship and his Beanpot wins Kelley also racked up an impressive amount of accolades including: eight New England Championships, nine appearances in the ECAC Division I playoffs, one ECAC playoff title and nine NCAA Tournament appearances. Kelley won the Spencer Penrose Award as College Hockey's Coach of the Year in 1959 and 1972. His success at BC earned him the nickname \"Dean of American College Hockey Coaches\".\nIn a February 23, 1972 game against rival Boston University Kelley earned his 500th win making him the first NCAA Division-I men's hockey coach to reach that mark. For his career Kelley posted a record of 501-243-15 in his 36-year career. His 501 wins would remain a school record until current coach Jerry York, who played for Kelley from 1963 to 1967, passed him in 2014. Kelley had spent most 41 of the first 47 years of his adult life on the Heights as either a player or coach.\nIn 1970 Kelley was inducted into the Boston College Varsity Club Athletic Hall of Fame. Two years later, in 1972, Kelley received the Lester Patrick Trophy for his contribution to hockey in the United States, not only for his accomplishments on the ice but also because he steadfastly refused to recruit players from Canada. Kelley felt recruiting Canadians would deprive Americans of a chance to develop their hockey potential. In 1974 Kelley be inducted in the United States Hockey Hall of Fame.\nOn April 10, 1986, following a long bout with an illness, John \"Snooks\" Kelley died. He was 78 years old.\nHead coaching record.\nSource:"

Currently, the track manager is Dainis Dukurs, former bobsleigh brakeman and the father of skeleton racers Martins and Tomass Dukurs.\nHistory.\nSledding took place in Sigulda as early as 1887. Several alpine skiing venues were held near the track following World War II. By the late 1960s, the city government of Sigulda approved the construction of a new track, designed by the Leipzig Sports Facilities Scientific and Technical Centre in East Germany. Construction began in 1984 with the participation of the Yugoslav company Graming d.o.o. and local builders, and the track was finally completed in 1986. It was built primarily for the needs of Soviet bobsledders and lugers, but after the restoration of the independence of Latvia in 1990, the track became the training center for Latvian wintersport athletes.\nAlthough skeleton wasn't initially in the building plan, Sigulda has hosted World Cup races in skeleton since the 2000s. Also, luge competitions are hosted in Sigulda each year, however, the track can't host four-man bobsleigh races, therefore there haven't been any World Championship races hosted in Sigulda, although in the 2018/2019 season a Bobsleigh World Cup stage will take place in Sigulda. Zintis Ekmanis and the original track designers has designed a new layout which would change two curves and make four-man bobsleigh races possible, though some lugers are not happy with this idea, because this may render the track unusable for women's singles and men's doubles lugers. Also, Dainis Dukurs has said in an interview for Sporta Avīze that there was an experiment involving Juris Šics, Andris Šics, Tomass Dukurs and Martins Dukurs, in which the quartet drove with a four-man bobsleigh without crashing. Dukurs stated that this proves that the track is, in fact, suitable for four-man teams, but to make it perfect for bobsleigh, most of the track should be rebuilt. The track will undergo major renovation after 2014 season. Also, an artificial ice start estacade was built in summer of 2008. It would have been used for bobsled, skeleton, and luge events for the 2026 Winter Olympics had the bid of Stockholm–Åre won.\nStatistics.\nNo vertical drop, percent grading, or turn names were mentioned."

        "text": "Christopher King (born 30 April 1981) is a New Zealand rugby union player who currently plays for the Panasonic Wild Knights in Japan. His position is tighthead prop. Three years ago he returned from France with his daughters Chloe and Alexis.\nEarly life.\nKing was born in Ashburton. He attended St Andrew's College from 1995 to 1999 during which time he played for the First XV for three years. King captained the team in his final year.\nCareer.\nProvincial rugby.\nKing started his career in 2002 for Canterbury and was a regular in the squad throughout 2003 and 2004. After the 2004 NPC he was loaned to the Highlanders and Otago. After the 2005 Super 12, King transferred permanently to Otago.\nWith the departure of Clarke Dermody prior to the 2008 Air New Zealand Cup, King was approached by Southland and chose to transfer further south to Invercargill. He along with Mackintosh and Jason Rutledge made up a formidable front row and the team reaching their first ever semi-final of the Air New Zealand Cup. He continued his strong play for Southland in the 2009 Air New Zealand Cup as the squad reached their 2nd consecutive semi-final, and proved a monumental figure in their week 14 Ranfurly Shield win against his former Canterbury team.\nIn the 2010 ITM Cup, King joined the rest of his teammates in producing a string of stellar performances during the Stags' extended defence of the Ranfurly Shield.\nSuper Rugby.\nKing's good form for Canterbury resulted in selection for the Crusaders, appearing in three games during the 2003 Super 12 season as the Crusaders were beaten in the final by the Blues. The following year he played in all 13 matches, mainly off the bench, serving as backup to the All Blacks props Greg Somerville and Dave Hewitt who were the regular starters for the club.\nKing was loaned to the Highlanders for the 2005 Super 12, but only appeared in 1 match for just 3 minutes. He then transferred permanently to Otago and the Highlanders. He made more of an impression as the Highlanders moved into the Super 14 era in 2006 as he became a regular reserve prop, once again behind two All Blacks in Carl Hayman and Clarke Dermody. In 2007 Super 14, injuries and the fitness programme in the run-up to the 2007 Rugby World Cup (which rested top All Blacks for the first half of the season) saw King receive 7 starts for the Highlanders, his highest total in Super Rugby. After the season both Hayman and Dermody left to play in the United Kingdom leaving Jamie Mackintosh and King as probable starters.\nKing started the 2008 Super 14 season as the Highlanders' regular tighthead prop, but the emergence of Hawke's Bay giant Clint Newland pushed King once again to the bench as the season went along. The 2009 Super 14 season saw more of the same, although injuries to Mackintosh and Newland saw King receive another 6 starts.\nKing again started the 2010 Super 14 season as the 3rd choice at prop for the Highlanders behind Mackintosh and Newland, but injury to Mackintosh saw him start the last 6 games of the season, his longest stretch of continuous starts in Super Rugby. During the season, he also joined the select group of players who have made 50 appearances for the franchise.\nIn the 2011 Super Rugby season, King had the finest year of his career, starting 13 matches for the Highlanders as the first-choice tighthead prop. As of the conclusion of that season, he sits 3rd all-time in appearances at prop for the franchise, behind only Carl Hayman and Carl Hoeft.\nTop 14.\nIn 2014, Chris King signed a deal to join French Top 14 side Montpellier.\nIn May 2015 French Top 14 side Pau, announced the signing of King for the 2015–2016 season."

        "text": "Paul Williams (born 22 April 1983) is a New Zealand-born Samoan international rugby union player who plays for Stade Français in the French Top 14. His regular playing positions are Centre, Wing and fullback. He is a son of former All Black Bryan Williams and the brother of Gavin Williams, who plays internationally for Samoa and for French club Clermont.\nPlaying career.\nNew Zealand.\nWilliams was born 22 April 1983 in Auckland, New Zealand.\nAs one of the most promising young players in New Zealand rugby, Williams was signed by the Highlanders for the 2003 season, aged only 19 and having never played NPC rugby. He quickly showed his ability, earning the starting job at fullback and scoring his first Super Rugby try before suffering a broken leg in his 6th appearance for the side. Williams' broken leg would turn into a nightmare, as it failed to heal properly and required multiple operations, including a re-breaking of the bone in 2004. He was provisionally named in the Highlanders squad for the 2004 season and again for the 2006 season, but dropped out before each season when it became obvious he wasn't fully recovered.\nFinally healthy in 2006, Williams signed for Canterbury and made 4 appearances in the 2006 Air New Zealand Cup, which were his first competitive games in over three years. Despite the limited game action, he was signed by the Crusaders for the 2007 season, although he didn't see any game action. Back with Canterbury for the 2007 Air New Zealand Cup, Williams appeared in every match – mainly on the wing – and impressed with his solid performances. This saw him re-signed by the Highlanders for the 2008 season, where he started all 13 matches and earned All Black consideration for his strong play at fullback. He played for Canterbury in the 2008 Air New Zealand Cup, where his excellent form continued as he scored 6 tries in helping his side to the title.\nIn 2009 Williams returned to his hometown of Auckland. He spent the 2009 season and 2010 season with the Auckland Blues, where he was a consistent player. However, he played off the bench as often as he started. He also played for Auckland in the 2009 Air New Zealand Cup, and he was named Auckland player of the year in 2009.\nEurope.\nAfter declaring for Samoa internationally in 2010, Williams signed with the Sale Sharks of the Aviva Premiership for the 2010–11 season. Williams was a regular starter for the Sharks at fullback, scoring 2 tries in 20 appearances. However, he chose to leave Sale after only one season to sign in France with Stade Français for the 2010–11 season.\nInternational career.\nIn May 2008 Williams gained selection for a New Zealand training squad for the 2008 international season, however he never played for the All Blacks.\nWilliams was eligible to play for Samoa internationally as he spent much of his childhood in the country while his father was coaching the Samoan national team. Unlikely to make the All Blacks squad for the 2011 Rugby World Cup, he declared his intention to play for Samoa in 2010 and made his debut against Tonga in the 2010 IRB Pacific Nations Cup on 12 June."

He was drawn against Northern Ireland's Daryl Gurney in the first round but lost 3-1.\nIn 2009, Thompson reached the quarter-final stage in the German Open, IDPA Lakeside Classic and the Denmark Open but his defense of the Scottish Open ended in the early stages of the competition.\n2010 saw Garry reach the quarter-finals of the World Championship.

It was released on April 14, 2008.\nGameplay.\nThe game extensively utilizes the Nintendo DS touchscreen, which controls the power and technique of bat swings and the speed and accuracy of pitches. Fielding, baserunning and other controls will also utilize the DS touch screen, by dragging and tracing lines to execute those baseball actions.\nThe game also features the ability to obtain special \"power-ups\", which can increase batting, pitching and fielding skill, as well a \"chicken ball\" that causes the opponents to chase a decoy ball, and a \"crazy ball\" that causes a batted ball to take a knuckleball-like flight. Power up pitches include a \"super splitter\" (that splits the ball into two pieces) and a literal \"fireball\". Fielding power ups include a \"brick wall\" that instantly stops a ball and a \"super jump\" to catch high line drives or rob home runs.\nFeatures.\nOther features include: \nMultiplayer.\n\"MLB 2K8 Fantasy All-Stars\" supports two-player DS Wireless Play\nCover athlete.\nAs with \"MLB 2K8\", José Reyes is the cover athlete, in cartoon form.\nReception.\nThe game received \"mixed\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic."

        "text": "Elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame for 1985 followed the system in place since 1978. \nThe Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) voted by mail to select from recent major league players and \nelected two, Lou Brock and Hoyt Wilhelm. The Veterans Committee met in closed sessions to consider older major league players as well as managers, umpires, executives, and figures from the Negro leagues. It also selected two players, Enos Slaughter and Arky Vaughan. A formal induction ceremony was held in Cooperstown, New York, on July 28, 1985, with broadcaster Brent Musburger handling introductions and Commissioner of Baseball Peter Ueberroth in attendance.\nBBWAA election.\nThe BBWAA was authorized to elect players active in 1965 or later, but not after 1979; the ballot included candidates from the 1984 ballot who received at least 5% of the vote but were not elected, along with selected players, chosen by a screening committee, whose last appearance was in 1979. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote.\nEleven players, who had previously been dropped from the ballot, were re-listed, following review and approval from a committee of six writers. Added were: Richie Allen, Ken Boyer, Clay Carroll, Ron Fairly, Curt Flood, Harvey Haddix, Denny McLain, Dave McNally, Vada Pinson, Ron Santo, and Wilbur Wood. Ultimately, none of the 11 were elected by the BBWAA, with only Santo gaining entry to the Hall, via selection by the Golden Era Committee in 2012 balloting.\nVoters were instructed to cast votes for up to 10 candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall. The ballot consisted of 41 players; a total of 395 ballots were cast, with 297 votes required for election. A total of 2,918 individual votes were cast, an average of 7.39 per ballot. Those candidates receiving less than 5% of the vote will not appear on future BBWAA ballots, but may eventually be considered by the Veterans Committee.\nCandidates who were eligible for the first time are indicated here with a dagger (†). The two candidates who received at least 75% of the vote and were elected are indicated in bold italics; candidates who have since been elected in subsequent elections are indicated in \"italics\". The 18 candidates who received less than 5% of the vote, thus becoming ineligible for future BBWAA consideration, are indicated with an asterisk (*).\nNellie Fox was on the ballot for the 15th and final time.\nThurman Munson, who died in a plane crash in 1979, would have been eligible for the first time, but the five-year waiting period was waived.\nThe newly eligible players included 16 All-Stars, two of whom were not included on the ballot, representing a total of 44 All-Star selections. Among the new candidates were 8-time All-Star Catfish Hunter.and 6-time All-Stars Lou Brock and Don Kessinger. The field included two Cy Young Award-winners (Catfish Hunter and Jim Lonborg), as well as George Scott, whose eight Gold Gloves at first base were a record at the time.\nPlayers eligible for the first time who were \"not\" on the ballot were: Darrel Chaney, Gene Clines, Joe Coleman, Willie Davis, Frank Duffy, Ray Fosse, Ellie Hendricks, Steve Mingori, Bob Montgomery, Tom Murphy, Bob Robertson, Wayne Twitchell, and Bobby Valentine.\nJ. G. Taylor Spink Award.\nJoe McGuff (1926–2006) received the J. G. Taylor Spink Award honoring a baseball writer. The award was voted at the December 1984 meeting of the BBWAA, and included in the summer 1985 ceremonies."

While Tate is noted for never having achieved a Major League hit despite having 41 at bats, he is best known for nearly pitching a no-hitter on August 4, 1975 at Shea Stadium against the Montreal Expos. Despite not allowing a hit through seven and one third innings, Tate ended up losing the game—which seems to have been the final straw for Mets management regarding the tenure of manager Yogi Berra, who was fired the next day.\nAfter spending the entire 1975 season in the Mets starting pitching rotation, Tate was sent to the Mets' class AAA minor league affiliate at Tidewater for the 1976 season. He pitched poorly and never made another major league appearance. After 1976, Tate was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates and pitched for their Triple A affiliate. He tore his rotator cuff and was forced out of the league.\nDeath.\nTate died from complications of COVID-19 in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, on March 25, 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Alabama. He was 68."

It is operated under the jurisdiction of the Turkish Ice Hockey Federation, a member of the International Ice Hockey Federation. Unlike the National Hockey League, the Super League is not divided into conferences; teams compete in a single division. The league currently consists of six teams, from two cities.\nThe champion of the league qualifies for the first round of the IIHF Continental Cup.\nHistory.\nThe Bel-Pa Ice Rink hosted the first match ever played in compliance with the IIHF rules and regulations, at the end of 1989 between Ankara Tarım Kredi Spor and Istanbul Paten Kulübü teams.\nAs of January 1990, ice hockey in Turkey was operated under the jurisdiction of the Turkish Ski Federation, and the first official championship ever was organized among two teams from Ankara and two from Istanbul. Ankara Büyükşehir Belediyesi, Istanbul Paten Kulübü, Ankara Atatürk Buz Hokeyi Takımı and İstanbul Boğaziçi Patinaj Klübü has participated to the championship and B.B. Ankara SK became the champion.\nThe rising interest in ice hockey effected the increasing number of players and then the teams. The Turkish Ice Hockey Federation was founded in 1991. Rino Ouellette, a Canadian diplomat in Ankara, who coached two teams consecutively, contributed much to the development of ice hockey sport in Turkey.

        "title": "High school ice hockey in Missouri",
        "text": "High school hockey in Missouri consists of two leagues centered around the two largest cities in the state, St. Louis and Kansas City, Missouri. The majority of the schools are located in the St. Louis metro area, which teams are members of the Mid-States Club Hockey Association (MSCHA), the larger of the two leagues in Missouri. Schools in the northwest, southwest, central, and western portions of Missouri are members of the Mid America High School Hockey League (MAHSHL). High school ice hockey in Missouri is not sanctioned by the Missouri State High School Activities Association (MSHSAA) but instead by USA Hockey.\nLeagues.\nMid-States Club Hockey Association (MSCHA).\nThe Mid-States Club Hockey Association (MSCHA) is the main high school hockey league in Missouri (and is often referred to as Mid-States). The league is made up of teams in the St. Louis metro area, currently all of which are located in Missouri. The MSCHA is a non-profit organization dedicated to the development of high school hockey.\nHistory.\nOriginally known as the Area High School Club Hockey League, the MSCHA was founded in 1971 with significant seed money and sponsorship from Union Electric, as well as support from the St. Louis Blues, including the donation of the Challenge Cup for the league's winner, and free usage of The Arena for the final. At the time, organized youth hockey was experiencing a boom in the St. Louis area, mostly caused by the Blues' arrival and subsequent appearance in three Stanley Cup finals. Eight teams contested that first season, with DeSmet winning the first championship. Of the eight teams that played that first year, only three can claim to have been in every Mid-States season: SLUH, CBC, and DeSmet. The league grew quickly, achieving a high of over 50 teams in its second year (when it also changed its name to the current MSCHA), but it also experienced a high rate of attrition, as clubs were disbanded due to loss of players or the removal of school support. Nevertheless, throughout the 1970s the league enjoyed great success. Plans were tabled for expansion to Kansas City and Columbia, but they were dropped following a dispute over travel costs and the loss of Columbia's ice rinks.\nDuring the 1980s, the league went through several periods of change; a JV league was established for younger players, schools from new population centers such as West St. Louis County and St. Charles County joined. The playoff format was also changed after the 1984 season into the current system.\nThe 1990s saw a shift in the balance of power from North County teams such as the Hazelwood schools to newer West County sides, as well as those in St. Charles. In addition to new schools quickly forming teams (resulting in a brief experiment in tiered competition), several former clubs rejoined, including charter member Whitfield. Police presence at games was increased, alcohol was barred from the bleachers, and the league began to cooperate further with schools and encourage faculty/administrative presence at games to curb problems in student sections.\nThe new millennium presented MSCHA with a large set of opportunities: the St. Louis hockey scene was booming, with players such as the Stastny brothers Paul and Yan and goaltender Ben Bishop honing their NHL-bound skills on high school teams. The league had signed a television contract with local cable provider Charter Communications (via its CCIN channel), allowing both league and playoff games, including finals, to be seen in homes around the area. However, a series of ugly incidents cast a shadow on this success, including a Priory skater being concussed from a late hit against Affton, further brawls among fans (most notably at Clayton–Ladue games, where the riot police has been called in several times), and a game where a Zumwalt South player physically assaulted a referee, only to be hit back by the official. Two new post-season competitions were introduced, the Doug Wickenheiser Memorial Cup and Founders Cup, each for teams that finished lower on the league ladder.\nLeague Champions.\nAt the conclusion of the regular season, the teams ranked in the top 12 play a round-robin format playoff leading up to the Challenge Cup championship game. The next 16 ranked teams play a similar round-robin format playoff for the Wickenheiser Memorial Cup. The remaining teams play in a traditional playoff style format for the Founders Cup.\nMid America High School Hockey League (MAHSHL).\nThe league is made up of teams from Arkansas; Oklahoma; northern, western and central Missouri; and teams from eastern and southern Kansas. Established for the 2009–2010 season, the MAHSHL replaces the Kansas City Metro Area High School Hockey League (KCMAHSHL) which ceased operations for 2008–09. The MAHSHL differs from the Mid-States Club Hockey Association, in that only one team is affiliated with a specific high school. The remaining teams are aligned with a group of school districts. A student athlete must play for the team aligned with their attending school district.\nThe league carries two divisions, a Varsity Division and a Junior Varsity Division.\nFormer teams.\nThe closure of numerous teams in the Kansas City area over a short period of time was primarily driven by the loss of all sheets of ice in the southern portion of the metropolitan area. The King Louie West Ice Chateau on Metcalf Ave in Overland Park, Kansas closed in 2007. In January 2011, Pepsi Ice Midwest on 135th Street in Overland Park, also closed resulting in the loss of the remaining three sheets of ice in the southern Kansas City area. With the loss of King Louie and Pepsi Ice Midwest, there were no longer conveniently located rinks for many of the high school teams that were once part of the Kansas City Metro Area High School Hockey League.\nAll Conference Selections.\nDuring the 2020-21 season, the MAHSHL Board of Directors convened to hold their inaugural MAHSHL All-Conference selections. At the Varsity level, each coach nominated players from their representative teams in each position (center, left and right wings, defensemen, and goaltenders) and the other coaches voted on those nominations to fill the 20 selections. No coach was allowed to vote for their own nominations.\nPlayer selections by year:"

He played at Sacramento State in 1988 as a wide receiver. Hence, Weaver had already used up his NCAA eligibility by 1989. After graduation, Weaver failed tryouts with the British Columbia Lions of the Canadian Football League and with the Houston Oilers since he was deemed to be neither fast enough (he ran only 4.6 in the 40-yard dash) nor strong enough (he could only bench press 250 pounds) to be viable in the pros.\nWeaver was able to pull off his scam by enrolling at Los Angeles Pierce College under an assumed name and a different date of birth, using the name and Social Security number of a friend who had never played sports. Changing positions to cornerback, he played two seasons at Pierce before transferring to Texas, where he was recruited by the defensive backs coach and claimed his age was 23 instead of 30. Weaver also joined the team after photos had already been taken for the team media guide. He eventually received a full scholarship.\nReportedly, Weaver was not caught until he told a reporter that he planned to write a book about his scheme. He was not exposed until the day before the December 1995 Sugar Bowl, when \"The Salinas Californian\", acting on an anonymous tip, revealed his real name and age. A promise to produce a birth certificate came to nothing, and he disappeared shortly before the game. The Longhorns lost to Virginia Tech; several players later said they were badly shaken by the discovery that one of their teammates was an imposter.\nCoach John Mackovic and other officials claimed to know nothing of Weaver's fraud until he was caught. Despite some initial concerns, there was no danger of Texas having to forfeit any games in which he played, as he had no impact on their outcome. Ultimately, the NCAA cleared Texas of wrongdoing, accepting school officials' contention that they did not know and could not have known of Weaver's fraud. , this is the last known case of someone fraudulently playing NCAA Division I football.\nAfter the story broke, Weaver's sister, Bonita Money, a television and film producer, said she was flooded with offers for her brother to sell the rights to his story. Bonita entered into a film deal with Addis-Wexler, Leonardo DiCaprio's management team a month after the scandal broke. Weaver and his sister had to cancel the deal once the Feds threatened to indict them for conspiracy if they completed a book or movie deal.\nWeaver ultimately pleaded guilty in a California federal court to misusing a Social Security number; he did not serve any jail time.\nWeaver's sister, Bonita Money, later became known as a minor actress who got into a 1992 fight with Shannen Doherty and was girlfriend to boxing legend and world champion Hector Camacho."

        "text": "The New England Group 19 Rugby League competition is a Rugby league competition which is run under the auspices of the NSWRL, which absorbed the NSWCRL in 2019. It is based in the New England region. It was originally called the Group 5 Rugby League Premiership but that competition merged with another local competition to form New England Group 19. The competition is generally played on Sundays throughout the winter months, with strong local rivalries as well as inter – town rivalries.\nHistory.\nGroup 5 Rugby League.\nHistorically, rugby league in the Northern Tablelands and North West was administered under the Group 5 Rugby League banner.\nGroup 19 emerged from Group 5 in the early 1980s, and initially featured roughly half of all the clubs from the Northern Tablelands and North West NSW. Group 5 eventually merged into the Group 19 competition after the 1981 season and the league has been known as New England Group 19 ever since.\nGroup 19 Rugby League.\nIn the 1980s, Noel Cleal and his brother Les emerged from Warialda to rise to prominence in the NSWRL Premiership.\nThe early 1990s were dominated by the two Moree sides, the Boomerangs and Boars, before the Inverell, Warialda and Armidale Rams sides rose to the top of the league in the late 1990s. Guyra, known as the Super Spuds, won a hat trick of Premierships from 2002-2004.\nGlen Innes, Tingha and Inverell dominated the late 2000s and early 2010s with the Moree Boomerangs emerging as the dominant side with back-to-back titles in 2013 and 2014.\nIn just their second season in Group 19 the MacIntyre Warriors claimed the A Grade honours, winning a tight contest over the returning Narwan Eels in 2017. The Eels returned to the competition after several years hiatus due to unruly supporters and unsportsmanlike behaviour.\nUnfortunately the MacIntyre Warriors folded in 2018, as a result of many players rejoining the nearby Goondiwindi league side. Their absence paved the way for a return to the premiers circuit for the highly rated Moree Boomerangs, a team that wear their indigenous flag themed jerseys with much pride.\nGuyra and Ashford folded after the COVID-19 plagued 2021 season, and Moree Boars left the year prior to join Group 4. Warialda, Tingha and a Uralla-Walcha joint venture rejoined the 2022 A Grade competition bringing the total to seven teams as Glen Innes entered a year's hiatus.\nThe 2023 Under 18's competition was won by the Glen Innes Magpies against Narwan Eels.\nClubs.\nCurrent clubs in Group 19.\nThe Tooheys New England Group 19 Premiership currently contains eleven clubs, two of which are in Armidale (the Armidale Rams and Narwan Eels), and nine from the surrounding area. \nChampions.\nGroup 19 Rugby League Champions\nGroup 5 Rugby League.\nThe competition in the area was previously known as Group 5. Once the Group 19 name became available after the demise of the previous competitions of that name, a breakaway competition \nfrom Group 5 became known as New England Group 19. Group 5 merged into this league two years later. The 'Moree' listed is the predecessor of the Moree Boars.\nGroup 5 Rugby League Champions\nReferences.\nwww.whereistheleague.com.au"

        "title": "Golden age of cricket",
        "text": "The \"Golden Age\" of cricket is a nostalgic term that has often been applied in cricket literature to the period in English cricket from 1890, the opening season of the official County Championship, to the outbreak of World War I which occurred just before the scheduled end of the 1914 season. The term has also gained currency in Australian cricket of the same period and in America in reference to the Philadelphian cricket team.\nNostalgia.\nThe period became infused with a nostalgic yearning, ostensibly because the teams played cricket according to \"the spirit of the game\". More poignantly, the nostalgia was due to the loss of life in the Great War and a hankering for those happier times before the war's outbreak. A number of first-class cricketers were killed or wounded during the war, the deaths including eight Test players: Colin Blythe, Major Booth and Kenneth Hutchings of England; Tibby Cotter of Australia; Reginald Hands, Bill Lundie, Reggie Schwarz and Gordon White of South Africa. The war years also saw the deaths of W. G. Grace and Victor Trumper, who both succumbed to illness in 1915.\nCricket of the period did feature numerous great names such as Grace, Trumper, Blythe, Wilfred Rhodes, Jack Hobbs, C. B. Fry, Ranjitsinhji and Frank Woolley, but that in itself is not unique as any period in cricket history can boast its great players. As David Frith pointed out, the nostalgia \"needed someone to put a perspective on it\". In his 1939 autobiography, Fry wrote: \"I have a notion that the cricket of the nineties and early nineteen hundreds was more amusing to watch, but I am not at all sure that the game of today is not more difficult to play\".\nIn Australia.\nIn Australian cricket, the period is also considered a golden age. Cricket writer Jack Pollard wrote: \"The golden age of cricket has always been regarded as the period between 1890 and 1914. For in all those years all the skills of the game flowered and an unprecedented array of great batsman and bowlers delighted informed and appreciative galleries. More importantly the players of that time set standards for sportsmanship that lifted cricket above other games and established it as a character-builder and an integral part of the social scene\".\nWriter Gideon Haigh said of Australian batsman Victor Trumper: \"If it is possible for a cricketer to be their period, rather than merely part of it, then Trumper \"is\" the \"Golden Age\" of cricket. In the gaiety and gallantry of his strokeplay, the charm of his personality, even in his frailty, transience and suddenness of death, Trumper personifies what we understand as the values and nature of his time\".\nTest cricket.\nTest cricket between England and Australia was well established by the time the Australians visited England in the 1890 season. The two countries played 15 series between 1890 and 1914 including the 1912 Triangular Tournament, in which South Africa took part. It was during the \"Golden Age\" that Test cricket first achieved its hegemony over other forms of first-class cricket.\nEngland's captains against Australia were W. G. Grace, Andrew Stoddart, Archie MacLaren, Plum Warner, Stanley Jackson, A. O. Jones, Frederick Fane, Johnny Douglas, and C. B. Fry. Australia's captains against England were Billy Murdoch, Jack Blackham, George Giffen, Harry Trott, Joe Darling, Hugh Trumble, Monty Noble, Clem Hill and Syd Gregory.\nSouth Africa had played their first Test in 1888–89, but initially they were very weak; up to 1898–99 they had played eight Tests against England and lost them all. They played Australia for the first time in 1902–03 and had the limited satisfaction of avoiding defeat in one of the three matches. However, in 1905–06, they won a series against England by four matches to one, thanks partly to the emergence of four googly bowlers: Reggie Schwarz, Bert Vogler, Aubrey Faulkner, and Gordon White. Schwarz had learnt how to bowl the googly from its originator, Bernard Bosanquet, while in England and had passed on the secret to the others. On South Africa's next tour of England, in 1907, they narrowly lost the Test series one-nil with two matches drawn, but in 1909-10 won by three matches to two. After that, however, their results declined, although the 1910–11 series in Australia was competitive.\nPhiladelphian cricket.\nThe period also saw the brief flowering of Philadelphian cricket. Three tours were undertaken to England during which the side played on level terms with the leading counties. The Philadelphians played ten first-class games on their final tour in 1908, winning four and losing six. This tour was notable for the outstanding bowling of Bart King, who took 87 wickets and topped the England bowling averages with 11.01 runs per wicket. This was not bettered until 1958 when Les Jackson of Derbyshire posted an average of 10.99."

        "text": "G.S. Iraklis Thessaloniki (, ) is a Greek professional basketball team that is located in Thessaloniki. It serves as the senior men's basketball section of the multi-sport club of G.S. Iraklis. Iraklis currently plays in the second-tier level Greek A2 Basket League.\nThe team's colors are blue and white. Iraklis won the Greek National Championship in 1928 and 1935, and has also reached the Greek Cup final three times. Some of the greatest players in Greek, European and worldwide basketball have played for Iraklis over the years including: Lefteris Kakiousis, Jure Zdovc, James Donaldson, Walter Berry, Xavier McDaniel, Roy Tarpley, Nikos Chatzivrettas, Vasily Karasev, Lazaros Papadopoulos, Dimitris Diamantidis and Sofoklis Schortsanitis.\nHistory.\nThe Iraklis parent athletic club was founded in 1908, and initially featured football. The club was named after Heracles (or Hercules), the mythical Greek demigod. The basketball team of Iraklis was established in 1921.\nIraklis won the inaugural Greek League championship in 1928. To win the championship, Iraklis had to eliminate AEK Athens and Near East, before beating VAO in the championship game. The team won its second Greek championship in 1935. Also in the team's history, three times Iraklis finished in second place in the Greek Championship (1936, 1962, and 1964), three times Iraklis has been a Greek Cup Finalist (1981, 1994, and 1996), and two times Iraklis made it to the semifinals of the European 2nd-tier level league Cup Winners' Cup.\nIraklis reached the semifinals of the 1994–95 FIBA European Cup, where they competed against Taugrés. Iraklis won the first game 79–78, but lost the next two games, to be eliminated 2–1 in a best of three series. In 1996, an Iraklis team led by former NBA players Xavier McDaniel and Roy Tarpley, reached the Greek Cup Final Four. By beating Apollon Patras in the semifinal, Iraklis reached the final, where it then lost 85–74 to Panathinaikos. Iraklis has also twice competed in the top European continental competitions. The club played in the European top-tier level European Champions' Cup in the 1995–96 season, and also competed in the FIBA SuproLeague during the 2000–01 season.\nRecent history (2005-present).\nIn 2006, Iraklis was relegated to the Greek A2 Basket League, after finishing 13th in the first-tier Greek League. In 2010, after four seasons in the second-tier level Greek League, the team was promoted back up to the top-tier Greek Basket League. After one season in the Greek top-tier level, Iraklis was again relegated down to the A2, with two matches left in the season. At the end of the season, Iraklis chose to play in the third-tier level of Greek basketball, the Greek B Basket League, in order to clear its debts. The club was promoted to the Greek A2 Basket League in 2013, after finishing 2nd in its group, and after Peristeri failed to receive financial clearance to participate in the league.\nIn the 2018–19 season, Iraklis won the promotion playoffs of the Greek A2 League, and was promoted up to the top level Greek Basket League, for the first time in 8 years. During the 2019–20 season, Iraklis is taking part in the Greek Basket League organized by the Hellenic Basketball Federation. The season started in October 2019 and was scheduled to end in June 2020. However, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the championship was terminated earlier. Iraklis took the 7th place with 29 points, having 9 wins and 11 losses in a total of 20 games. In the 2020–21 season, Iraklis returned to European competitions, taking part in the qualifying round of the Basketball Champions League and later on in the 2020–21 FIBA Europe Cup where the club reached the Top16 round having 3 wins and 1 loss. In the 2020–21 season Iraklis took the 10th place with 29 points, having 7 wins and 15 losses in a total of 22 games.\nHome arena.\nIn earlier times, Iraklis played its home games at the Thessaloniki Forum. Iraklis currently plays its home games in the Ivanofeio Sports Arena, an arena with a seating capacity of 2,500. The arena opened in 1987, and it was expanded to its current capacity in 1991. Ivanofeio is situated in the Thessaloniki city center, and it is owned by the GS Iraklis multi-sport club.\nSupporters.\nThe most prominent supporters' club of the team is \"Aftonomi Thira 10\" (meaning Autonomous Gate 10), a fan club with a total of 15 branches in Northern Greece. The fan club is known for holding an antiracist stance, as it participates in the \"Ultras Antiracist Festival\". Other activities of the fan club include the publication of a magazine, and the conducting of an annual festival. Other minor supporters' clubs are \"SFISE\", \"Blue Boys\", \"A.P.A.T.S.I.\", and \"Iraklis Fan Club of Athens\". In a 2013 opinion poll, Iraklis was ranked as the 6th most popular basketball club in Greece, gathering 2.8% of the participating supporters' votes."

        "text": "West London Eagles Handball Club is a team handball club based in Gunnersbury Park, West London. The club has men's and women's teams in the EHA national Premier Handball League (former men's Super 8 and women's Super 7 league) and development teams in the South East regional divisions. They also have junior boys' and girls' teams competing in the U14, U16, U19 and U21 competitions.\nClub history.\nWest London Eagles Handball Club was founded in 1972 by Bill Holderness, a GB goalkeeper and were originally based in the old South Ruislip Leisure centre. Originally the teams were largely made up of British players but gradually more overseas players joined the club.\nThe club had a successful spell through the 1980s playing in the national leagues, when many of their players were picked for the regional and national teams whilst the women won the national league and cup on several occasions alongside fierce rivals Wakefield.\nIn 1982 the women became the first British team to win a match in a European Cup, beating the Belgian champions over two legs.\nThe club have previously been known as Graphite Eagles, when sponsored by Graphite Equipment Ltd, and Robert Jenkins following their purchase of the company.\nUp until October 2016 the club were known as Ruislip Eagles but removed the Ruislip name in order to build a greater identity within West London. Alongside this name change the club also announced Mizuno as their official kit provider.\nIn 2021 Eagles moved to the Gunnersbury Park Sports Centre, which serves as a home court for club's league games where most training sessions are held.\nPast performance.\nMen's team.\nIn 2010 West London Eagles won the EHA Cup after a 26-25 victory over Manchester.\nThe following season the team qualified to the EHF Challenge Cup for the first time in its history after a second place in the English League 1 and finishing as runner-up in the EHA Cup.\nThey beat Dublin International Handball Club and the Maltese hosts Aloysians ProMinent but did not qualify for the second round after a defeat against local rivals London GD. That same year the team finished as the runner-up of the National League 1 and therefore qualified for the EHF Challenge Cup again.\nIn 2012/13 they were again knocked out in the second round of the EHF Challenge Cup after three defeats against the Lithuanian side Dragūnas Klaipėda, SPE Strovolos from Cyprus and the Moldavian host team HC Olimpus-85-USEFS. However, they were guaranteed a place in the EHF Challenge Cup 2013/14 with a 4th-place finish in the newly revamped Super 8 league. The team also finished runner-up in the EHA Cup, losing to Salford H.C in the final.\nThe team started the 2013/14 season with a defeat in EHF Challenge Cup against the Bulgarian side Spartak Varna with the second leg being broadcast on Bulgarian National TV 1. In domestic competition they reached the semi-finals of the EHA Cup and secured 3rd position in the league.\nIn the 2014/15 season the team participated again in the EHF Challenge Cup losing in the opening round to Belgian side HC Visé but matched their league position of the previous year securing a European place for the 5th year in a row.\nIn 2015/16 they lost to eventual champions ABC/UMinho in the opening round but ended the season with a 5th-place finish in the Super 8 league and therefore missed out on an EHF Challenge Cup place for the 2016/17 season.\nWomen's team.\nHistorically the women's team have dominated the English game, at one point winning the cup and league for 16 consecutive years, a reign that was ended in 2006/07 by local rivals London GD.\nIn 2012/13 they finished 4th in the South League 1 and 3rd in the EHA Cup, and accepted an invitation to take up a place in the newly formed Women's Super 8 League for the 2013/14 season.\nSince the formation of the Super 8 the women's team has not replicated the success seen throughout the 1990s and 2000s finishing 6th in 2015/16.\nIn 2019 the women's team won the EHA Cup after the 42:40 double extra time victory in the final against NEM Hawks.\nIn 2022, after finishing 3rd in the regular season and qualifying for English championship play-offs, women's team went on to finish as runners-up. This meant a spot in the British Super Cup, where Eagles won in the semifinal against Scottish champions Edinburgh HC and lost against NEM Hawks the next day in the final."

The 64 NCAA Division I college baseball teams were selected out of an eligible 286 teams on May 26, 2008. Thirty teams were awarded an automatic bid as champions of their conference, and 34 teams were selected at-large by the NCAA Division I Baseball Committee. Thirty-eight of the 64 selected teams participated in the 2007 tournament.\nThe 2008 tournament culminated with 8 teams advancing to the College World Series at historic Rosenblatt Stadium in Omaha, Nebraska, on June 14.\nThe Fresno State Bulldogs beat the Georgia Bulldogs in the best-of-three championship series to win the NCAA Men's Division I Baseball Championship. Fresno State became the lowest seeded team (4th in the Regionals) to win the National Championship in NCAA history, and the fifth consecutive baseball team to win the title that was not one of the eight national seeds. They were considered a \"Cinderella\" team throughout the tournament. This was only the third national championship of any kind in school history, following the 1968 NCAA Men's Tennis Tournament and the 1998 NCAA Division I softball national champions.\nFresno State sophomore third baseman Tommy Mendonca won the Most Outstanding Player Award. Tommy hit four home runs and had 11 RBIs and also made a number of spectacular plays in the field.\nThe first day of the 2008 CWS was moved to Saturday (June 14) from the traditional Friday. Also, if all games were needed in the first double-elimination round, it would take eight days to complete rather than seven. The NCAA cited the need to be more flexible in the super-regional round in case of inclement weather. It also allowed for greater potential ticket revenue, in part because the extra \"if-necessary\" day would now be ticketed separately if both games are played.\nBids.\nAutomatic bids.\nConference champions from 30 Division I conferences earned automatic bids to regionals.

        "title": "Noel Kelly (rugby league)",
        "text": "Noel Raymond Kelly (22 January 193614 June 2020) was an Australian professional rugby league footballer and coach, who played at club, state and national levels. He was named among the country's finest footballers of the 20th century. Kelly played as a , prop forward or for much of his top-grade career with the Western Suburbs Magpies, whom he played for in three consecutive NSWRFL grand finals from 1961 to 1963. Kelly was named at of the Western Suburbs Magpies, Queensland and Australian teams of the 20th century.\nEarly life.\nKelly was born at Ipswich Hospital and brought up in Goodna. He attended primary school at St Mary's in Goodna, and the Christian Brothers high school, St Edmund's College, Ipswich, where he said he was \"frequently belted or bashed or caned\" by the Brothers. At age 12, his mother allowed him to enrol in the local state school, where he studied onuntil he was 14. Goodna's first team played in the local district reserve grade competition, and Kelly played for the club from his junior league until he was in the first team as a young man, mostly playing as a lock or second rower.\nPlaying career.\n1950s.\nIn 1956, Kelly began playing in the Ipswich Rugby League competition, first with Railways, and then, two years later, with Brothers. At Railways he played on the same side as Gary Parcell and Dud Beattie. At Brothers he was coached by Dan Dempsey, who had played on two Kangaroo tours.\nThe Bulimba Cup was a tri-series played between sides representing Ipswich, Brisbane and Toowoomba. Playing at hooker, Kelly played in the Ipswich side which defeated the Toowoomba Downsmen 15–10 in the 1958 final, in front of a crowd of 7,242. Kelly said the repeated success in 1959 was his \"spring board to state and international level\".\nKelly was chosen to play for Queensland in 1959 under captain-coach Clive Churchill. In an era when success in scrums was crucial, Kelly won the count in his debut 20–9 against the New South Wales hooker. He missed the second game of the series, but returned to see Queensland win the series 2–1.\nIn 1959, Kelly played in the Queensland victory over New South Wales that attracted 35,261 spectators, smashing Brisbane's previous record for an interstate match of 22,817.\nKelly was picked as hooker for his first test match against New Zealand. Later that year he embarked on his first Kangaroo Tour, but pre-existing injuries to his knees hampered his performances on the tour and he played in only 14 of a possible 37 games, allowing St George player Ian Walsh to cement the spot as starting hooker.\n1960–1965.\nShort of money, Kelly signed an £800 contract to captain-coach with Ayr for the 1960 season. Upon his arrival, he discovered the five local clubs had pooled their resources to afford the signing, and he was expected to rotate through all five clubs. He would captain-coach a club for a week, and then move on to the next.\nChosen for the 1960 World Cup, Kelly scored his first international try in Australia's opening game against France. Playing at hooker, it was said that he, \"was bruised and scratched from his ankles to his hips from kicks which everyone besides the referee could see going in.\"\nKelly had established himself as a Kangaroo representative before he moved to Sydney in 1961. Initially linked to Souths, he eventually chose Western Suburbs because they offered better accommodation, and, \"two big prop forwards\", which he insisted was \"something I must have\". The club initially delayed paying the transfer fee to North Queensland side, Ayr, while Kelly spent eight weeks recovering from a cartilage operation. With Ian Walsh the chosen test hooker, Kelly played in no internationals in 1961 or 1962. Before the start of the 1963 season, he asked the Magpies for a trial at prop, as it was thought he, \"wrecked his chances in representative sides with the large number of penalties he incurred as hooker\". In June, he returned to the Australian team, taking the place of captain Billy Wilson, who had been dropped for the third match of the series against New Zealand. Making his international debut at prop, he scored a try. He played prop in the first game of the two match series against South Africa, but returned to hooker in the second, replacing Walsh who was sidelined with a broken nose.\nKelly was a stalwart of the Magpies sides of the 1960s and played in all of the club's consecutive Grand Final losses to St. George in 1961, 1962 and 1963. Kelly has said that he believes referee Darcy Lawler had accepted money to help St George win the 1963 Grand Final.\nNot a large player by the standards of the time, Kelly had the reputation as an aggressive forward. He was sent off eleven times while playing for Wests, though some send-offs were for scrum breaches rather than foul play. On at least one occasion it appeared he was the wrong person sent off.\nIn August 1963, Kelly announced he was unable to undertake the Kangaroo tour due to take place due to financial commitments. He said, \"It's a bitter disappointment, and if there was any way I could make the tour, I certainly would.\" He also withdrew from the interstate match that was due to take place the next day. Three days later, Kelly signed a new contract with the Magpies and revised his position. Kelly made his second Kangaroo Tour, playing at prop forward as captain Ian Walsh was again chosen as . In his third Kangaroo Tour he was back at hooker.\n1966–1969.\nMissing the first game of the 1966 interstate season after suffering a broken thumb and serving a suspension, Kelly had not taken the field for over a month when he was named captain-coach of NSW for the second game. When told of his selection, a \"dumbfounded\" Kelly said, \"You must be kidding. I have been training. I am fit. I just can't believe it.\" Kelly was captain-coach of the Magpies from 1966, a position he held for 4 years.\nKelly injured himself in the first game of the 1967 season with Wests, and a 10 May news report said he was still suffering from blurred vision and no chance of playing in 10 June test match against New Zealand. Weeks later, having played just one game after returning from injury, Kelly was a \"shock choice\" for the match. The oldest player in the team, his inclusion was, \"a compliment to his great experience and his durability.\" In the second match, Kelly was sent off after less than two minutes into the game. After his five-eighth John Gleeson was felled, Kelly retaliated by punching culprit Robert Orchard in the head.\nKelly was the first hooker/prop to be selected for three Kangaroo tours: 1959–60, 1963–64 and 1967–68. In the first tour match in 67, against Warrington, he had his nose broken in the first scrum of the match. For the first test, it was said, \"Kelly, the most important player in Australia's test line up, is agony today with his injured back\", but still played in the match. After losing the first test, Australia won the second. The decider was won 11–3 by Australia, with, \"the one sour note\" of the match being \"the dismissal of veteran hooker Noel Kelly only three minutes from the end\" after a stiff arm tackle on opposition half Tommy Bishop. Facing suspension for the tackle, Kelly was allowed to play in the test against France a week later, while waiting for official notification from the English Rugby League to arrive in the mail. The third in the series was Kelly's 28th and last test.\nKelly's last game was at the end of the 1969 season, with his team winning their fifth game straight, in a \"mire\" at Penrith. After leaving Wests, he received a number of inquiries, including one from Canterbury. \"One minute I am happily retired, the next I have more offers than ever in my career,\" a \"perplexed\" Kelly said. He eventually signed a two-year, $5000 per season contract to join Wollongong from 1970 but only remained for one season, a period he later said he regretted.\nPost-playing.\nKelly returned to Sydney to coach the North Sydney Bears from 1973 to 1976, never making the semi-finals. At the end of 1976, having retired from coaching with Norths, he was named to coach a Sydney team in a tour of New Zealand.\nHe became a board member and an ambassador for the Men of League Foundation.\nIn September 2004 Kelly was named as captain and hooker of the Western Suburbs Magpies team of the century. In February 2008, he was named in the list of Australia's \"100 Greatest Players\" (1908–2007) which was commissioned by the Australian Rugby League and the National Rugby League to celebrate the code's centenary year in Australia. Kelly went on to be named as hooker in Australian rugby league's \"Team of the Century\". Announced on 17 April 2008, the team is the panel's majority choice for each of the thirteen starting positions and four interchange players. In June 2008, he was chosen in the Queensland Rugby League's Team of the Century at hooker.\nThe yearly award for the best forward at the Wests Tigers club is named the Noel Kelly Medal in his honour.\nIn the 2018 Queen's Birthday Honours, Kelly was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) for services to rugby league.\nKelly died on 14 June 2020 in Sydney. He was 84, and had suffered a heart attack–induced stroke on 16 May, one month before his death."

He played at club level for Keighley, Bradford Northern, York and Hunslet, as a , and coached at club level for Keighley (three spells), Halifax, Barrow (two spells), Swinton (two spells), Featherstone Rovers and Wakefield Trinity.\nEarly life.\nAt an early age, Roe played football and was given a trial at Manchester United. Roe had also received interest from Sheffield United, but he suffered a back injury in an accident which prevented him from playing sport for 12 months. Once Roe had recovered, he had turned his attention to playing rugby league instead.\nPlaying career.\nKeighley.\nRoe started his professional career at Keighley and was promoted to the first team in 1974. Whilst at Keighley he represented Yorkshire at the age of 18. \nBradford Northern.\nIn December 1975, Roe was transferred to Bradford Northern for a fee of £7,500. He played 99 games under Roy Francis and Peter Fox, who coached the team to back-to-back championships. His playing position was at . Roe was selected to play for Great Britain in France but had to pull out due to a serious knee injury and subsequently had to retire prematurely from the game when Bradford Northern cashed in their insurance policy (£30,000) on Roe in 1981. Roe proved the medical people wrong and fought his way back to fitness but was not allowed to play again for Bradford Northern due to the legalities of the payout. He finished his playing career with York and Hunslet.\nCoaching career.\nHe began his coaching career at Keighley, taking over from the late Geoff Peggs who 'died in office' in 1985. He left the following year.\nPeter Roe was appointed as head coach at Halifax for season 1990-91 when they achieved promotion along with Salford who were their opponents in the Divisional Final at Old Trafford. Roe was removed from office 24-hours later when he refused to re-apply for his own job. The Halifax board stated that he did not have the required experience for a club in the top division. He returned to Keighley in September 1991 and coached the club to the division three title in 1992-93 and stayed at his home town club until 1994.\nHe was coach of Barrow for a 15-month period, ending in January 1996.\nPeter Roe led Swinton to promotion from Division Two in 1996.\nPeter Roe was in charge of Featherstone Rovers from 1999 to October 2001 on a part-time contract, before leaving to take charge of Wakefield Trinity. He was replaced at Featherstone Rovers by his assistant Ian Fairhurst.\nIn October 2001, Roe left his part-time role as Featherstone Rovers coach and his job as a benefit fraud investigator to take up a full-time head coach post with Wakefield Trinity. He was sacked in July 2002 and was replaced by his assistant Shane McNally.\nPeter Roe quit as coach of Swinton in September 2003, after less than a year in charge.\nIn Peter Roe's second spell with Barrow, they were National League Two champions in 2004, their first trophy for 20 years with 14 wins from their 18 games. Roe won Coach of the Year in the process. They were promoted to National League One but were relegated back to National League Two at the end of the 2005 season after winning just one of their 18 matches. The financial situation at the club forced a review of the coaching structure and the position of head coach was made part-time and the club parted company with Peter Roe.\nPeter Roe returned for his second spell in charge of Keighley at the end of 2005, succeeding Gary Moorby and starting the rebuilding process of a club still ravaged by relegation from National League One. The majority of players had left and money was in short supply. player-coach Barry Eaton was the only major signing and promising youngsters were blooded; the side struggled to compete and they finished joint-bottom. Roe gave Eaton full control as player-coach in 2007."

        "text": "Joe Grimaldi (born August 23, 1986) is an American former professional ice hockey defenseman. \nEarly life.\nUndrafted in the NHL, drafted in seventh round by the Windsor Spitfires in the Ontario Hockey League. He was soon asked to play for Team USA at age 16. Grimaldi was a part of the United States National Team Development Program from 2002–04. He won one gold medal at the four nations cup and an International Ice Hockey Federation silver medal in Minsk at the world championships in 2004. Grimaldi chose to enroll at the University of Nebraska Omaha of the CCHA. \nIn the 2004–05 season, Grimaldi scored 21 points and was named to the CCHA All-Rookie Team. The University of Nebraska Omaha named him most consistent player with +24 plus/minus leading all of college hockey in the 2004–2005 season.\nCareer.\nIn his second year with the Mavericks, he left for major junior hockey in the Ontario Hockey League with the Ottawa 67's. Brian Kilrea helmed the bench as head coach. While he was with the 67's he signed with the New York Islanders. He played exhibition games with the Islanders before getting sent back to Ottawa for future development. In the 2007–08 season, Grimaldi turned pro officially and signed with the Rochester Americans, an affiliate of the Buffalo Sabres, and was later sent down to the Elmira Jackals (Ottawa Senators) of the ECHL. Grimaldi played in 36 games recording 15 points as a rookie with the Jackals and made his AHL debut with the Rochester Americans and Albany River Rats, an affiliate of the Carolina Hurricanes. On January 15, 2008, Grimaldi was traded to fellow ECHL team the Fresno Falcons, affiliate to the San Jose Sharks. He was later flipped to the Gwinnett Gladiators on February 19. He then played for his sixth team in the year when he was called up to the Peoria Rivermen affiliate for the St. Louis Blues. During his four-game stint, he recorded one assist in the season's last four games.\nGrimaldi started the 2008–09 season with the Cincinnati Cyclones of the ECHL before returning to the Jackals placing third on the team with 101 penalty minutes. He attended Elmira's training camp before the 2009–10 but because of his previous ankle injury from the year before, he was not cleared to play yet. He later signed a contract midway through the season on December 12, 2009. However, after playing in 33 games with Elmira before departing the team on March 17, 2010.\nGrimaldi had retired after the 2010 season due to numerous injuries, but the following year signed in the Atlantic Hockey League with the Colorado Eagles, an affiliate of the Colorado Avalanche. Grimaldi later signed in the GET Ligaen in Norway.\nIn 2013 Grimaldi played his first overseas season in Norway for Rosenberg in the GET Ligaen. Grimaldi was hit from behind early in the season and suffered a C2 fracture. Grimaldi rehabbed in Norway for 3 months before returning to play. Following that year, Grimaldi joined the Nottingham Panthers of the Elite Ice Hockey League (EIHL) for the 2013–2014 season. He played seven games before feuding with Coach Corey Neilson which led to his release, tallying 8 points (2 goals, 6 assists). During his brief stint, Grimaldi racked up 110 penalty minutes.\nThe Edinburgh Capitals of the same EIHL league chose to bring him back for the 2014–15 season. Grimaldi played until his release on January 4, 2015, stemming from an incident the previous evening. On January 3, 2015, playing against his former team the Nottingham Panthers, Grimaldi made an open-ice hit to the head of Evan Mosey which led to being challenged to fight by Max Parent. Grimaldi was seen to spear Parent intentionally with his stick. Grimaldi then proceeded to throw his helmet at Parent, striking his face, followed immediately with a sucker punch. Parent reportedly still won the brawl. Thrown out of the game, picking up 67 minutes' worth of penalties, Grimaldi was released the following day amidst the impending ban confirmed days later by the DOPS (Department of Player Safety) of 18 games. Grimaldi decided to retire shortly after returning stateside."

        "title": "1987 America's Cup",
        "text": "The 1987 America's Cup was the twenty-sixth challenge for the America's Cup.\nThe American challenger \"Stars &amp; Stripes 87\", sailed by Dennis Conner, beat the Australian defender \"Kookaburra III\", sailed by Iain Murray, in a four-race sweep in the best of seven series. Conner thus became the first person both to lose the America's Cup and then to win it back.\nThe series was held in Gage Roads off Fremantle, Western Australia during the Australian summer months between October 1986 and February 1987. The Royal Perth Yacht Club was the defending club and the organiser of the defence series. Yacht Club Costa Smeralda of Porto Cervo, Sardinia was appointed the challenger of record and hence the organiser of the challenger series.\nThis was the last time that 12-metre class yachts were used in the America's Cup and the first time for 132 years that it had not been defended by the New York Yacht Club.\nBackground.\nThe 1983 America's Cup off Newport, Rhode Island was the most significant America's Cup regatta since the first event off the Isle of Wight. Alan Bond's \"Australia II\" pulled off a major upset by winning the series from Conner's \"Liberty\" to become the first success in twenty-five challenges for the Cup. The New York Yacht Club had previously built the longest winning streak in international sporting history, having successfully defended the trophy over 132 years.\nMost previous challenges had been from the United Kingdom – notably by Scotsman Sir Thomas Lipton who had challenged five times between 1899 and 1930 in his \"Shamrock\" sloops. Australia mounted its first challenge in 1962 with 12-metre class yachts when Sir Frank Packer and his \"Gretel\" were beaten 4–1. Packer made more challenges, with \"Dame Pattie\" and \"Gretel II\". Alan Bond mounted his first challenge in 1974 with \"Southern Cross\", followed by \"Australia\" in 1977 and 1980 and ultimately had success with \"Australia II\" in 1983.\nIt was in this context that the 1987 America's Cup was seen as the best opportunity yet for a successful challenge, as the event was now outside the control of the NYYC and held in a location with strong but variable breezes, unlike the predictable and placid winds off Rhode Island. The regatta therefore attracted enormous additional interest over previous series.\nThe venue.\nSelection.\nFollowing the 1983 win, there was speculation over the likely location of the defence, with three main candidates potentially under consideration. In the late 1970s, Alan Bond had developed a marina and a large associated housing development north of Yanchep called \"Yanchep Sun City\" (now known as Two Rocks), about one hour's drive north of Perth. The marina was built with an expectation of success from earlier America's Cup challenges. The second candidate was the town of Mandurah, a coastal township a similar distance south of Perth. The last, and ultimately successful location considered was Fremantle as the required infrastructure at the other two locations were considered inadequate by the Royal Perth Yacht Club as defender. Also, the proximity to the major population centre of Perth and its international airport were seen as an important factor.\nDevelopment.\nFor most of its life until 1985, Fremantle had been a port city with a population of less than 24,000. Private investment and public infrastructure redevelopment commenced on a massive scale in anticipation of a large influx of visitors arriving to watch the event. This expectation proved over-ambitious, but 13 challenging syndicates from six countries and four defence syndicates arrived with a fleet of 29 12-metre yachts.\nIn 1985, an \"Office of America's Cup Defence\" was set up to coordinate the state government's involvement in the staging of the event. The government embarked on a number of projects such as Hillarys Boat Harbour and extensions to the Perth to Fremantle railway line. A new marina, Challenger Harbour was built alongside the existing Fishing Boat Harbour, and the state government received funding from each defence syndicate, a total of $2.3 million, to offset costs associated with the harbour works of $8 million., Vehicle registration plate slogans in Western Australia changed from \"The Wildflower State\" and \"the State of Excitement\" to \"W.A. Home of the America's Cup\" In 1985 and 1986 changes in liquor laws and trading hours regulations were made to expand services for visitors.The Executive Director of the Royal Perth Yacht Club's America's Cup Defence Committee was Noel Robins, a skipper and crew member in previous America's Cups, and later a Paralympic gold medallist.\nA Festival of Sport was conducted in late 1986 and early 1987 which included a cricket Test and One Day International tournament, athletics, hockey, basketball, squash, golf, racing, trotting, cycling, football, baseball, fishing (MAAC Blue Water Fishing Classic), lawn bowls, karate and kick-boxing competitions. A heavy-weight boxing title fight and a World Sprint Car Championship were held in early January.\nThe cruise ship \"Achille Lauro\" was chartered by a private group for the duration of the series, to act as a viewing platform and accommodation for 1,400 visitors. It also housed the international jury which oversaw the races. Other cruise ships which visited the port for the races included \"\" and several Royal Viking vessels.\n12-metre 'world championship' races.\nIn January and February 1986, a series styled as the '12-metre world championship' was staged off Fremantle as a precursor to the America's Cup event scheduled for January 1987. A dozen syndicates competed, mainly as a shakedown series to determine their relative competitiveness and to train crews for the anticipated heavy conditions. Strong winds throughout most of the regatta resulted in four masts, a dozen booms and numerous sails being destroyed. Five crewmen were washed overboard during the races. Gary Jobson, of the 'Heart of America' syndicate declared that the Fremantle waters were \"unsuitable for racing.\"\n\"Australia III\", the heavy-weather Ben Lexcen designed successor to \"Australia II\" won the series comfortably. The New Zealand challenge boat \"KZ 5\", a fibreglass-hull Bruce Farr design, came in second, with the New York Yacht Club entrant \"America II\" third.\nCourse.\nThe Fremantle Fairway Buoy was renamed the \"America's Cup Buoy\" for the duration of the event and marked one end of the start and finish lines for each America's Cup race. The buoy is a permanent navigation marker used for shipping in and out of Fremantle harbour and is located west-north-west of the harbour, in Gage Roads or due west of City Beach. Races in the challenge and defence elimination trials used other markers in the general vicinity.\nThe orientation of the course was set such that the starting line was square to the prevailing wind 20 minutes before each race start. Races were long, consisting of beats into the wind in legs 1, 3, 6 and 8; downwind runs on legs 2 and 7; and reaches on legs 4 and 5.\nContestants.\nChallengers.\nThirteen syndicates from six countries (Canada, France, Italy, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States) competed, bringing 25 boats for the right to challenge. \"Stars &amp; Stripes 87\" was the winner of the 1987 Louis Vuitton Cup and earned the right to sail for the America's Cup.\nDefenders.\nFour syndicates competed for the right to represent the Royal Perth Yacht Club as the defender of the America's Cup. After a series of round robin races, a Defender Finals contest was sailed between Alan Bond's \"Australia IV\" and \"Kookaburra III\" of Kevin Parry's Taskforce 87 syndicate, with \"Kookaburra III\" sweeping the finals five races to nil to win the Defender selection process. In doing so she placed Alan Bond's syndicate on the outside of an America's Cup regatta for the first time in thirteen years.\nRaces for the Cup.\nThe best-of-seven final series were scheduled to be held between 31 January and 15 February 1987. There being a four-race sweep result, the final race was held on 4 February."

The Veterans Committee met in closed sessions to consider older major league players as well as managers, umpires, executives, and figures from the Negro leagues. It selected two players, Bobby Doerr and Ernie Lombardi. A formal induction ceremony was held in Cooperstown, New York, on August 3, 1986, with Commissioner of Baseball Peter Ueberroth, and former Commissioners Bowie Kuhn and Happy Chandler, in attendance.\nBBWAA election.\nThe BBWAA was authorized to elect players active in 1966 or later, but not after 1980; the ballot included candidates from the 1985 ballot who received at least 5% of the vote but were not elected, along with selected players, chosen by a screening committee, whose last appearance was in 1980. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote.\nVoters were instructed to cast votes for up to 10 candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall. Results of the 1986 election by the BBWAA were announced on January 8. The ballot consisted of 41 players; a total of 425 ballots were cast, with 319 votes required for election. A total of 2,992 individual votes were cast, an average of 7.04 per ballot. (This would prove to be the last election to average 7 or more votes per ballot until 2014.) Those candidates receiving less than 5% of the vote will not appear on future BBWAA ballots, but may eventually be considered by the Veterans Committee.\nCandidates who were eligible for the first time are indicated here with a dagger (†). The one candidate who received at least 75% of the vote and was elected is indicated in bold italics; candidates who have since been elected in subsequent elections are indicated in \"italics\". The 17 candidates who received less than 5% of the vote, thus becoming ineligible for future BBWAA consideration, are indicated with an asterisk (*).\nThe newly eligible players included 15 All-Stars, two of whom were not included on the ballot, representing a total of 36 All-Star selections. Among the new candidates were 7-time All-Star Minnie Miñoso, who was re-eligible due to two at-bats in 1980, and 6-time All Star Willie McCovey. The field included one MVP (McCovey), and two Rookies of the Year (McCovey and Ted Sizemore).\nPlayers eligible for the first time who were \"not\" included on the ballot were: Bill Bonham, Pedro Borbón, Bernie Carbo, Ralph Garr, Ken Henderson, Von Joshua, Fred Kendall, Lerrin LaGrow, Skip Lockwood, Elliott Maddox, Roger Metzger, Fred Norman, Marty Pattin, Dave Rader, Merv Rettenmund, Jim Rooker, Ted Sizemore and Bob Stinson.\nJ. G. Taylor Spink Award.\nEarl Lawson (1923–2003) received the J. G. Taylor Spink Award honoring a baseball writer. The award was voted at the December 1985 meeting of the BBWAA, and included in the summer 1986 ceremonies."

After a disappointing 1903 season, the Board of Control of Athletics was looking to hire a coach that could offer \"systematic training\" of the team to hopefully lead to a more successful season. In the spring, the Board hired Smith who was doing some coaching at West Point in 1903. Before the season, the team elected C. M. Morphy as captain and the team's manager, J. Blickensderfer, had scheduled games versus Ohio State, Wittenberg, Franklin, Earlham College, the Indianapolis Medics, and DePauw. The manager also had scheduled a game with Central University in Danville, Kentucky, but that game was canceled due to financial dispute from the baseball game from the spring. Smith's Miami team was out scored for the season by a combined score 283 to 12. All of the losses were shutouts including and 80–loss to Ohio State and a 68–0 loss to Wittenberg. The only game in which Miami scored was a 12–6 victory over the Hamilton Athletic Club in the second game of the season."

In football, he was a four-year letterman and a three-year starter.\nProfessional career.\nWatson was drafted 67th overall in the third round by the Denver Broncos of the 1999 NFL Draft, then the highest an Eastern Illinois player had ever been drafted. Head coach and fellow alumnus Mike Shanahan was so impressed by Watson's performance in the pre-season, he released both veteran return specialists and made Watson the starter. In his rookie season, Watson returned 48 kickoffs, and 44 punts including an 81-yard touchdown against Seattle in Week 15 (then the 5th longest in franchise history), but also fumbled 5 times and was traded to Buffalo. He was the Bills' primary return specialist in 2000, but he disappointed greatly in that role to the point where Bills head coach Wade Phillips dismissively called Watson \"more of a punt catcher\" at one point in the 2000 season. Phillips's successor Gregg Williams used Watson almost exclusively as cornerback in 2001 and 2002. He was traded to the Lions before the 2003 season, but never appeared in a game.\n's NFL off-season, Watson shared the Broncos franchise record for kick returns in a season (48) with Chris Cole."

The organization has consolidated junior intake from the Santa María School, Valencia, the base which maintains all its inferior squads, from Under 6 to Under 18's. Combined with this, in the months leading up to the start of each school year, its instructors begin the recruiting process conducting rugby workshops and training initiation days in many city schools.\nThis junior process ends when the first children grow old enough to graduate from the Under 18's and are promoted to the Senior team, no longer kicking a ball around as they warm up, rather warming up shoulder to shoulder with the seniors, all like one big family.\nThe time that is spent training young players comes to fruition with the many call-ups of San Roque players to the junior representative teams of the Valencian Rugby Federation and in the Spain national rugby union team, playing international tournaments."

Although locally known as HSV Hamburg, the club is not part of the Hamburger Sportverein and has the right to use their logo and abbreviation for promotional purposes. The club notably won a EHF Champions League in 2013 and a Handball-Bundesliga in 2011. On 20 January 2016, their license was revoked due to irregularities and, as a result, Handball Hamburg was not authorized to participate in either the first or second handball Bundesliga in the 2016/17 season. As a result, the club was relaunched with a new coat of arms, colors and a new image, from HSV Hamburg to Handball Sport Verein Hamburg; although the official name remained unchanged.

However, this kind of clash was much more pronounced in the past, as the class differences between the fanbases have faded out and the social gap that once separated the two sides has closed over the years. Nowadays, both clubs boast fanbases that represent all the social classes.\nBasketball rivalry.\nPanathinaikos and Olympiacos are the two most successful basketball teams in Greece.

        "text": "UTour Golf was an online golf game developed by British studio Gusto Games and published by Groove Media Inc. The game was released through SkillGround: an online, skill-gaming platform owned by Groove but closed its doors in 2009 and the domains are now dormant.\nPlayers could compete in single and multiplayer games for free, or challenge others to cash games where the winner collected a cash prize. This was not considered gambling, as the outcome was based on skill. Despite this fact, the service was still restricted within 13 states of the United States.\nFree play was supported by advertising, displayed both before the game starts, and during play on billboards presented within the game. Cash play had no advertisements outside of game play, and was supported by a rake placed on wagers.\nGame Play.\nGame play was based on a three click system. The user had to click at certain times as a progress bar sweeps from left to right, then back from right to left.\nThe first sweep controlled the power; the closer to the right end of the shot bar, the more power the shot had. The second sweep controlled the accuracy; the closer to a center line near the left end, the more accurate the shot was.\nGame play was also affected by such issues as wind, weather, club type, pin and tee locations, and grass roughness. These affected accuracy, how far the ball would fly, and how far the ball would roll.\nPlayers were also matched on the site by a ranking system. This system provided a numerical estimate of a player's skill level. By viewing the skill level of an opponent, a player decided to accept or refuse challenges. A handicap system was also available where strokes may have been forfeited to an opponent to allow players of different skill levels to compete on a more even playing field.\nThe game also provided detailed statistics, though these were only available to the player, and were not publicly shared.\nRules.\nUTour offered different game modes based on traditional golf rules. Players could compete under the Stroke Play, Match Play, or Stableford Plus rule sets.\nMini-games based on driving ranges and putting challenges were also available.\nContests.\nUTour offered a number of partner sponsored tournaments with prizes generally consisting of golf-related trips or golf equipment.\nThese included:\nUTour also held contests geared towards cash rewards for Players' Club members, an example of which was the 2008 Cup Classic\nHistory.\n\"UTour Golf\" was released both through UTourGolf.com and SkillGround.com in August 2007. SkillGround had been previously released in December 2006.\nIt was initially launched in a beta format, and was subsequently upgraded. In November 2007, the following features were added:"

        "text": "In cricket, the flight of the ball is its trajectory through the air between being released by the bowler and bouncing on the pitch. The flight of a delivery may be varied by changing the pace of the ball or through use of the Magnus force.\nFlight is a key weapon of spin bowlers. A common objective of spin bowling is to beat the batsman \"in the flight\". This implies that the bowler has deliberately varied the trajectory of the ball in order to deceive the batsman as to the exact location it will land. This may result in the batsman missing or mis-hitting the ball and thus being dismissed.\nIf the bowler bowls the ball slightly slower or with topspin, then the ball will land further away from the batsman that he would otherwise anticipate, whereas if the bowler bowls the ball slightly quicker or with backspin, then the ball will land closer to the batsman. Applying a lateral Magnus force will make the ball move sideways in the air, this is known as drift.\nThe term \"flighted delivery\" or \"flighting\" is often used to describe a delivery that is bowled slightly slower with a higher trajectory. This is seen as an aggressive tactic for spin bowlers.\nA quicker delivery with a lower trajectory is sometimes described as \"flat\" or \"flatter\". In one-day cricket, spinners will often \"push through\" flatter deliveries, as they are perceived as more difficult to strike for boundaries by aggressive batsmen."

        "title": "1925 Rose Bowl",
        "text": "The 1925 Rose Bowl was a college football bowl game. It was the 11th Rose Bowl Game. The Notre Dame Fighting Irish defeated Stanford University, 27–10. The game featured two legendary coaches, Knute Rockne of Notre Dame, and Pop Warner in his first year at Stanford. The game also featured the Four Horsemen of Notre Dame. Elmer Layden of Notre Dame and Ernie Nevers of Stanford were named the Rose Bowl Players Of The Game when the award was created in 1953 and selections were made retroactively.\nThis was the first appearance for Notre Dame in any post season bowl game. It was the second appearance for Stanford in a bowl game, since their appearance in the First Tournament East West football game, later known as the 1902 Rose Bowl. This was the first appearance of the Notre Dame football team on the West Coast, and eventually led to the founding of the Notre Dame – USC rivalry. This game marked the first time a wirephoto, known at the time as a \"telepix\", was transmitted of a bowl game.\nTeams.\nStanford University.\nAt the time, the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC) teams played a very limited conference schedule. Teams played from three to five conference opponents in an eight-game schedule. Stanford defeated Occidental and had a narrow 7–0 win against Olympic Club. They defeated Oregon, 28–13, in their opening PCC conference game. A 3–0 victory over Idaho in Portland, Oregon was their last close game. Then they beat Montana, 41–3, to run their PCC record to 3–0. Stanford and California met in one of the biggest of the Big Games in 1924. Both teams were undefeated with the PCC championship on the line. Stanford was 3–0, and Cal was 2–0–1. Thousands packed Tightwad Hill above a sold out California Memorial Stadium. Cal needed a win, but the game ended in a 20–20 tie, giving Stanford the sole possession of first place in the PCC.\nNotre Dame Fighting Irish.\nNotre Dame garnered interest from the Rose Bowl committee to play a PCC opponent for the 1925 football season. Rockne and the Notre Dame administration realized how lucrative an annual trip to Los Angeles would be for the football program. Notre Dame's west coast alumni began lobbying Rockne to bring the team to the Rose Bowl as a season finale on a yearly basis. The Rose Bowl committee favored this arrangement; at the time there was no tie in with the Big Ten Conference. However, the PCC had reservations. Specifically, two members schools, Stanford University and the University of California refused to play Notre Dame \"on account of Notre Dame's low scholastic standards. Since Notre Dame was a Catholic school, its academics were considered inferior at the time. USC's coach, Gus Henderson reached out to Rockne through correspondence stating that \"USC would welcome the chance to play Notre Dame New Year's Day in Pasadena. While Rockne favored playing USC, Stanford, which won the PCC title, had first choice and eventually realized that playing Notre Dame would be lucrative, and the two played in the 1925 Rose Bowl.\nQuarterback Harry Stuhldreher, left halfback Jim Crowley, right halfback Don Miller and fullback Elmer Layden had run rampant through Irish opponents' defenses since coach Knute Rockne devised the lineup in 1922 during their sophomore season. A legendary quote from Grantland Rice, a sportswriter for the former \"New York Herald Tribune\", gave them football immortality. After Notre Dame's 13–7 upset victory over a strong Army team, on October 18, 1924, Rice penned a famous passage of sports journalism:\nOutlined against a blue-gray October sky, the Four Horsemen rode again. In dramatic lore they are known as famine, pestilence, destruction and death. These are only aliases. Their real names are: Stuhldreher, Miller, Crowley and Layden. They formed the crest of the South Bend cyclone before which another fighting Army team was swept over the\nprecipice at the Polo Grounds this afternoon as 55,000 spectators peered down upon the bewildering panorama spread out upon the green plain below.\nNotre Dame would later notch its 200th victory in a 34–3 win over Georgia Tech in the homecoming game on November 1. Their only other close game would come against Northwestern at Soldier Field on November 22, where the Irish won 13–6.\nGame summary.\nThree Irish touchdowns were scored on Stanford turnovers. Stanford had eight, which proved to be the difference, as they otherwise dominated the Fighting Irish. Elmer Layden scored three touchdowns for Notre Dame, one on a three-yard run in the second quarter to give Notre Dame a 6–3 lead and two more on interception returns. Ernie Nevers, an All-American two-way star for Stanford, played all 60 minutes in the game. He rushed for 114 yards, more yardage than all the Four Horsemen combined.\nAftermath.\nThe next year, the USC invited Notre Dame to a home-and-home series, which was the beginning of the Notre Dame–USC football rivalry. Previously, the furthest west the Irish ever had traveled was to play at Nebraska and Kansas. Dillon Hall, a dormitory at the University of Notre Dame, was built with the proceeds, $52,000, from the 1925 Rose Bowl.\nElmer Layden of Notre Dame and Ernie Nevers of Stanford were named the Rose Bowl Players of the Game when the award was created in 1953 and selections were made retroactively.\nThis was Notre Dame's last Rose Bowl appearance for almost 100 years, and the team did not appear in any bowl game until the 1970 Cotton Bowl Classic. In 2007, the UCLA Bruins hosted the Notre Dame Fighting Irish in the Rose Bowl stadium where the Irish won, 20–6. With the Rose Bowl Game joining the Bowl Championship Series, the possibility has existed that Notre Dame could again play in the Rose Bowl game. In 2020, Notre Dame qualified for the College Football Playoff and lost to Alabama in the 2021 Rose Bowl, which was moved from Pasadena to Arlington, Texas due to the COVID-19 pandemic, by a score of 14-31.\nRockne died in a plane crash in 1931. Don Miller, who died in 1979 as the last of the living Four Horsemen, said that the 1925 Rose Bowl champion team was Rockne's favorite team.\nThe Notre Dame–Stanford football rivalry game is now one of the many Notre Dame Fighting Irish football rivalries. The teams next played each other in 1942 and again in 1963 and 1964. The modern series began in 1988 has been played annually except in 1995 and 1996. As of 2021, Notre Dame leads the series, 21-13. When the game is played at Stanford Stadium, it is usually the last game on Stanford's schedule (as has been the case since 1999), one week after the Cardinal plays archrival California in the Big Game."

        "text": "Ralph Hawkins (May 4, 1935 – September 9, 2004) was an American football coach. He worked 35 years in the National Football League (NFL) for nine teams. In addition to a long career as a college coach, Hawkins coached some of the top defensive units in the NFL.\nEarly years.\nHawkins played at St. John's High School in Washington, D.C., winning Catholic league championships in baseball, basketball and football. During the '52-'53 school year, Hawkins was 1st team POST All Met in both Football and Basketball. After high school Hawkins attended the University of Maryland on a football scholarship, where he played quarterback, running back and defensive back. Hawkins played in the 1955 Orange Bowl, and later graduated with a degree in physical education.\nCollege coaching.\nHawkins had a brief playing stint with the New York Titans before becoming head coach of football and an assistant basketball coach at Bishop Denis J. O'Connell High School in Arlington, Virginia in 1958. In June, 1959, he was replaced as head football coach by his St John's and Maryland teammate Bob Rusevlyan to return to the University of Maryland to complete his studies and help coach the Freshman football team. Hawkins served as graduate assistant at the University of Maryland, and went on to coach at several colleges: Southern Methodist University, U.S. Military Academy at West Point, the University of Kentucky and the University of Cincinnati.\nNFL years.\nHawkins began his NFL coaching career with the Buffalo Bills from 1969 to 1971. He then served the Washington Redskins as a defensive assistant under George Allen from 1972 to 1977. In his first year on the staff, the Redskins advanced to Super Bowl VII, where they lost to the undefeated Miami Dolphins. During Hawkins' time in Washington, the Redskins posted a record of 58–26, making the playoffs four times. The defense ranked in the top five of the league three times.\nAfter spending one year with the Baltimore Colts, Hawkins moved on to the New York Giants, where he was linebackers coach and defensive coordinator from 1979 to 1980, before being fired on January 6, 1981.\nFrom the Giants, Hawkins went to coach for the Buffalo Bills under head coach Chuck Knox and followed him to the Seattle Seahawks. Hawkins coached the secondary from 1983 to 88, during which time his unit was one of the best in the league. In 1983, the Seahawks entered the playoffs as a wildcard team and advanced to the conference championship game, losing to the eventual Super Bowl champion Los Angeles Raiders. The 1984 team finished with a 12–4 record, losing in the divisional playoffs to the Miami Dolphins. The 1984 Seahawks' secondary led the league with 38 interceptions The Seahawks intercepted 149 passes during Hawkins' six years in Seattle, second only to the San Francisco 49ers. Hawkins contributed to Seahawk teams that had a combined record of 57–38 from 1983 to 1988, including four playoff appearances and an AFC West Division title in 1988.\nHawkins coached one season as defensive coordinator for the New York Jets in 1989, then spent the remainder of his career as a scout. He scouted for the Arizona Cardinals (1991–93), the Carolina Panthers (1994–97), the Indianapolis Colts (1998–99) and the Houston Texans (2000–02).\nDeath.\nA resident of Fenwick Island, Delaware, Hawkins died September 9, 2004, in Berlin, Maryland.

        "text": "The 1983 Daytona 500, the 25th running of the event, was held February 20 at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida as the first race of the 1983 NASCAR Winston Cup season.\nSummary.\nCale Yarborough was the first driver to run a qualifying lap of more than at Daytona in his #28 Chevrolet Monte Carlo. However, on his second of two qualifying laps, Yarborough crashed and flipped his car in turn four. The car was destroyed in the crash, and Ranier-Lundy did not have a back up car for Yarborough to race. Thus, the team had to scramble to find a replacement and eventually found a Hardee’s restaurant displaying a Pontiac LeMans painted like the #28 and used for promotional purposes; that car was brought to Daytona and restored to racing condition, with Yarborough starting it from the eighth position. \nRicky Rudd wound up with the pole, driving Richard Childress' Chevrolet in what would become a breakthrough season for the longtime independent driver Childress. The early laps were a battle between Geoff Bodine, Richard Petty, Dale Earnhardt, Kyle Petty, and a resurgent Dick Brooks. Richard broke away from the field before his engine failed after 47 laps and the race became a showdown between Bodine, Yarborough, Joe Ruttman, Brooks, Neil Bonnett, Buddy Baker, and Bill Elliott, while former Talladega 500 winner Ron Bouchard was also in contention.\nOn Lap 63, the engine on the Bud Moore Engineering Ford driven by Earnhardt failed. As the race went on the lead bounced back and forth, and Bobby Allison, who'd lost a lap, crowded the leaders most of the day. Past halfway Kyle Petty blew his engine and a tire issue dropped Bonnett off the lead lap; when Mark Martin hit the wall Ruttman swerved to stop Bonnett from getting his lap back as they raced through a group of lapped cars. Bonnett got his lap back later but blew his engine in the final twenty laps while Brooks cut a tire and lost a lap.\nOn the final lap, Baker led Yarborough, Ruttman, and Elliott. Cale stormed past Baker on the backstretch and Ruttman drafted into second; Baker dove under Ruttman and Elliott snookered them both on the high side in a three-abreast photo finish for second. The win was Cale's third in the 500 and was also the first time that an in-car camera of a car went into victory lane before a national CBS Sports audience.\nWaltrip-Brooks incident.\nWith Brooks as the leader, the field slowed down coming back to the yellow. Two cars, though, tried to get their lap back by beating the leader back to the finish line, a practice banned subsequently in 2003 - Lake Speed passed Brooks in Turn Four and then moved into his path; Brooks braked and Darrell Waltrip spun to avoid hitting Brooks; Waltrip's Chevrolet struck the inside guardrail and flew backward back onto the racetrack, nearly collecting Yarborough, Bodine, and Ruttman.\nWaltrip suffered a concussion, resulting in an overnight hospitalization. He returned the next week at Richmond, which would be prohibited under a 2014 rule change. Waltrip admitted in his biography \"DW: A Lifetime Going Round in Circles\" (published in 2002) that it was a life-changing crash: when he heard drivers and fans joking that the crash would \"knock him conscious\" or \"finally shut him up\", he realized for the first time how unpopular he was and resolved to clean up his image. Waltrip often referenced the crash when asked to be a keynote speaker at national events.\nThe practice of allowing lapped cars to attempt passing the leader at the finish line when taking the caution was prohibited after the 2003 Sylvania 300 at Loudon, NH when after Dale Jarrett crashed and numerous cars nearly struck Jarrett's disabled car on the race to gain a lap back, leading to the development of the current beneficiary rule. The concussion protocol was adopted in 2014 after Dale Earnhardt Jr. took himself out of two races in the 2012 season after two concussions—one in August (Kansas tire test) and in October (Talladega race crash).\nDid not qualify.\nDrivers who failed to qualify for this event include Blackie Wangerin, Joe Millikan, Connie Saylor, Morgan Shepherd, Rusty Wallace and David Simko.\n• This would be the only time Rusty Wallace ever failed to qualify for a race in his 25-year career."

After a mediocre run in the Busch Clash, Elliott nearly lapped the field in his 125-mile qualifying race, then thoroughly dominated the Daytona 500, leading 136 of the 200 laps in his #9 Coors/Melling Ford Thunderbird. The race restarted on the last lap after a Neil Bonnett spin out with less than four laps to go; Bonnett got out of his car and was credited for a 10th-place finish. The race saw a number of engine problems, which knocked many of the contenders, including former Daytona 500 winners David Pearson, A. J.

As a result, the 1974 Daytona 500, won by Richard Petty (his second straight, making him the first driver ever to do it), was shortened to 180 laps (450 miles), as symbolically, the race \"started\" on Lap 21 and the race is often known as the Daytona 450. The Twin 125 qualifying races (won by Bobby Isaac in a Banjo Matthews Chevrolet and Cale Yarborough in the Richard Howard Chevy prepared by Junior Johnson) were also shortened to 45 laps (112.5 miles).\nSummary.\nFirst Daytona 500 starts for Bob Burcham, Richie Panch, George Follmer, Lennie Pond, Jackie Rogers, Joe Mihalic, and Richard Childress. Only Daytona 500 starts for Jimmy Crawford, L. D. Ottinger, Dick Simon, Tony Bettenhausen Jr., and Dan Daughtry. Last Daytona 500 starts for Bobby Isaac and Gary Bettenhausen.\nCoo Coo Marlin would get his only ever lead lap finish at this race.\nABC Sports announced a week before the race that the event's second half would be televised live, opening with a recap of the event's opening laps. Keith Jackson handled play-by-play commentary with Jackie Stewart providing color commentary. Chris Economaki reported from pit road.\nThe race was the most competitive in Daytona history with 59 official lead changes (a record that stood until the 2011 Daytona 500, which saw 74 lead changes) among 15 leaders (this record was tied in 1989, then broken in 2006 at 18 and 2010 at 21, and 2011 with 22). The number of leaders was nearly 16; on Lap 51 Cale Yarborough passed Johnny Rutherford and George Follmer passed Yarborough in Turn Three; Yarborough repassed Follmer before the start-finish line thus officially leading the lap. \nRichard Petty and Donnie Allison combined to lead 29 times for 120 laps while other strong cars included Yarborough, Bobby Allison, A. J. Foyt (who started 35th), Coo Coo Marlin (started 31st), and pole-sitter David Pearson.\nThe race saw two dramatic changes in outcome in the final twenty laps. Richard Petty cut a tire and had to pit under green with 19 laps to go, putting Donnie Allison into the lead. But with 11 laps to go, Bob Burcham blew an engine in the trioval just in front of Donnie Allison. It caused Allison's Chevy to blow out a tire and spin out near turn one while leading. Allison then lost a lap limping back to pit road to get fresh tires. Petty re-took the lead and won by a margin of 47 seconds. Yarborough was second, followed by Ramo Stott, Marlin, Foyt, and Donnie Allison. Marlin might have finished second, but mistook the white flag for the checkered, since both were being displayed when they crossed the line to get the white flag, as Petty was right behind them. Marlin let off on the back straightaway, and lost second to Yarborough, while Stott, known at the time mostly for his USAC stock car prowess, followed to take third, while Marlin had to settle for fourth."

There was a major speed discrepancy between cars in their qualification runs. Top teams were qualifying in the to range and a few teams qualified in the range. Two of the teams who qualified in the range were disqualified after NASCAR inspectors found suspicious extra fuel lines. Some teams attributed these lines to performance-enhancing nitrous oxide. One driver later admitted that he deliberately qualified slower to let the time from \"offending\" teams stick out.\nIn the 125-mile qualifying races, Dave Marcis won race 1, while Darrell Waltrip claimed race 2.\nRace.\nThe opening laps were a battle for the lead between Buddy Baker, Waltrip, and David Pearson.

        "text": "The 1978 Daytona 500, the 20th running of the event, was the second race of the 1978 NASCAR Winston Cup season. It was held on February 19 at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida. Defending winner Cale Yarborough won the pole and Bobby Allison won the race.\nRace report.\nThe race began with Richard Petty, who brought a brand new Dodge Magnum to the race, leading early. Starting in sixth place, Petty quickly went out in front and led 32 out of the first 60 laps, all under green. The first 60 laps were run at an average speed of nearly 180 mph. But on the lap 61, Petty cut a left rear tire and spun out, collecting long-time rival David Pearson and Darrell Waltrip.\nTrack conditions were very \"green\" that day, due to heavy rains during the week. Just after the restart on lap 70, Parsons blew a left rear tire and spun out. Behind him, 1972 race winner A. J. Foyt was caught up and flipped several times in the turn 1 infield. That left the race to three drivers, 1977 race winner and polesitter Cale Yarborough,\nBuddy Baker and Bobby Allison, who entered the race with a 67-race winless streak. Yarborough dropped out with engine problems. With 11 laps remaining, Baker, dueling with Allison, suffered an engine failure. Allison drove his Bud Moore Ford Thunderbird around Baker to take the lead and capture his first Daytona 500 win.\nIt was the lowest starting position (33rd) that a driver had won the event, until 2007 when Kevin Harvick started one spot further back than Allison. 1978 would be final year for the AMC Matador with Jocko Maggiacomo's entry. First Daytona 500 starts for Bill Elliott, Blackie Wangerin, Morgan Shepherd, and Harry Gant. Only Daytona 500 starts for Roger Hamby, Roland Wlodyka, Jerry Jolly, Claude Ballot-Léna, and Al Holbert. Last Daytona 500 starts for Ron Hutcherson, Ferrel Harris, Skip Manning, Dick May, Jimmy Lee Capps, and Joe Mihalic.\nDenver racer Jerry Jolly made his NASCAR Winston Cup debut and finished 20th, his best in the series. This would be the only one of his five Winston Cup starts where he was running at the finish. This was done in spite of a cut tire on the 92nd lap that started a four-car incident that also involved the cars of Cecil Gordon, Jimmy Lee Capps, and Tighe Scott. All four were running at the finish of a race that had a remarkably low amount of attrition for a race of that era. Only 14 of the 41 cars that started failed to make it to the finish, with a high percentage of those who failed to make it to the finish being some of the sport's top drivers.\nLast Daytona 500 until the 2019 Daytona 500 without an Earnhardt in the field.\nNotable crew chiefs who participated in this race included Darrell Bryant, Junie Donlavey, Jake Elder, Joey Arrington, Herb Nab, Dale Inman, Bud Moore and Harry Hyde."

        "text": "The 1975 Daytona 500, the 17th running of the event on February 16, 1975, was a race in the NASCAR Winston Cup Series.\nRace report.\nFrom the start, it appeared that David Pearson was on his way to his first Daytona 500 victory as he built a sizable lead on second place Benny Parsons late in the race. However, Richard Petty, eight laps behind the leaders due to a leaking radiator which needed frequent pit stops to replenish, and Parsons hooked up in a draft and began reeling in Pearson who was slowed by lapped traffic. The key moment of the race occurred two laps from the end when contact with Cale Yarborough in traffic sent Pearson spinning on the backstretch. Parsons avoided the accident and went on to take the win.\nOne of the things that set up the late incident that cost David Pearson the race was that Cale Yarborough was running on 7 cylinders. On the final restart, Cale was placed in front of the leaders, on the end of the lead lap, but the power deficit he was at resulted in the leaders lapping him in less than 25 laps. When Pearson caught up to Yarborough and Richie Panch, Yarborough was trying to slip in behind Pearson and simply misjudged it. Of course, another was the role Richard Petty played. Even in a two-car draft with Ramo Stott (who barely missed the massive lap 4 crash), Parsons was losing ground to Pearson, who was content to draft A.J. Foyt, but Foyt dropped out with nine laps left while running third, not long after Petty got back onto the track after his final pit stop, and where he came out was a stroke of luck for Parsons and Stott, because he came out exactly where they were running.\nAs per the list below, 26 of the 40 drivers failed to finish the race for various reasons, including a huge crash on the fourth lap, which took out nine cars, nearly one-quarter of the field.\nWest Coast ace Hershel McGriff's third and final Daytona 500 ends with a blown motor on lap 13. Bruce Jacobi would debut in this race, finishing in 12th place after qualifying in 39th place.\nAmong those involved were famous country music singer Marty Robbins, who also crashed out of the 1973 Daytona 500.\nAt the time, it was the biggest crash in terms of the number of cars involved in race history. Donnie Allison started on the pole, but only led the first lap and was sidelined by mechanical problems, as was DiGard Racing teammate Johnny Rutherford, the reigning Indianapolis 500 champion. Another that failed to finish was Buddy Baker, who led 46 laps. As a result, a record-low 14 cars, including that of Pearson, were classified as running at the finish.\nNone of the 40 cars in this year's Daytona 500 had a single-digit car number.\nFinishing order.\n\"Note: * denotes that the driver failed to finish the race.\""

It was held on Sunday, February 15, 1981.\nRace report.\nContested over 200 laps and over the course of 2 hours and 56 minutes, the race was won by Richard Petty for his record seventh at the Daytona 500, beating Bobby Allison to the line by 3.5 seconds and bringing about Buick's first win in NASCAR since 1956. Ricky Rudd, Buddy Baker, and Dale Earnhardt rounded out the Top 5. A new generation of smaller cars, with a wheelbase of , down from the previously used , made their debut in this race.\nDavid Pearson had the only Chevrolet in the field. He started 9th in his new Monte Carlo after finishing 5th in the Twin 125 before retiring with engine failure. Steve Moore attempted to qualify in a Chevrolet Malibu but his #73 didn't make the race. \nBobby Allison dominated Speedweeks from the beginning, winning the pole position, his 125-mile qualifying race, and was considered the prohibitive favorite for the 500. He was driving a 1981 Pontiac Le Mans, which was the only car in the race with a \"fastback\" sloped rear window, greatly improving aerodynamics and downforce on the rear spoiler over the \"notchback\" profiles of the Buick Regals, Pontiac Grand Prixs, Oldsmobile Cutlasses, and Ford Thunderbirds. The Le Mans was on the NASCAR approved-model list, but no other team thought to build one.\nAllison led the most laps and was the car to beat. But Allison lost considerable time when he ran out of fuel and had to coast through most of a lap to make his final pit stop. Meanwhile, on Richard Petty's final planned pit stop, Petty's crew chief Dale Inman, who was working his final race with the team before leaving to become Dale Earnhardt's crew chief, opted not to change tires and only took on fuel. Petty then re-entered the track with a considerable lead that Allison rapidly closed, but could not overcome before the finish.\nThe race was contested in front of 130,000 spectators and featured 49 lead changes. 18 laps were run under the caution flag. It was one of the few Daytona 500s where the final caution flag occurred before the halfway point of the race.\nPetty earned $90,575 ($ when adjusted for inflation) for winning, the largest purse of his entire career. Blackie Wangerin finished last after an accident on lap 17.\nFirst Daytona 500 starts for Ronnie Sanders, Tim Richmond, Kyle Petty, and Billie Harvey. Only Daytona 500 starts for Glenn Jarrett and Don Sprouse. Last Daytona 500 starts for Johnny Rutherford, Bill Elswick, Don Whittington, James Hylton, Cecil Gordon, Bruce Hill, and Blackie Wangerin.\nDickie Boswell would make his only Cup Series attempt at this race.

The fast pace of the race contributed to many engine failures. Earnhardt started his 20 years of Daytona 500 misfortune when, while running a close 2nd behind Baker, his team left one lugnut off a wheel on the final pit stop which forced Earnhardt to pit again, dropping a lap off the pace.\nDave Marcis drove this race with a broken rib after a crash at the end of the Sportsman 300 the day before this race; ultimately finishing in 22nd place."

Cale Yarborough, who won the pole, completed a lap of , officially breaking the barrier at Daytona. He won the race for the second year in a row, and the fourth time in his career, with an identical last-lap pass as the previous year, this time passing Darrell Waltrip who would later go on to win the same race in 1989.\nThis race would be the first Daytona 500 starts for Ken Ragan, Greg Sacks, Mike Alexander, Connie Saylor, Doug Heveron, Bobby Hillin, Jr., Hendrick Motorsports And Trevor Boys. It was the only Daytona 500 start for Dean Combs. This race would be the final Daytona 500 starts for Dean Roper, Ronnie Thomas, and Tommy Gale.\nSpeedweeks.\nCale Yarborough and his crew chief Waddell Wilson were ready to repeat as Daytona 500 champion as Speedweeks got underway. Yarborough won the pole with a new track record. In the first Twin 125, 1980 Daytona 500 champ Buddy Baker was leading with 8 laps to go but did not want to be passed on the last lap. Baker slowed and forced Yarborough to pass. Yarborough took off and Baker could not catch him, winning by 1.8 seconds. In the second race, 1982 Daytona 500 champ Bobby Allison held off Harry Gant. A total of 72 cars participated in the Twin 125 mile qualifiers, with 36 in each race.\nCalamity Corner.\nIn 1984 Daytona's 4th turn was dubbed \"Calamity Corner\" after three violent accidents. Ricky Rudd was battered and bruised in a wild, tumbling, sidewinding crash in the Busch Clash, but he won two weeks later in Richmond (despite a concussion suffered in the Clash; NASCAR did not implement a concussion rule until 2014 after Dale Earnhardt, Jr. admitted to racing with an untreated concussion during the 2012 season). In the second Twin 125, Randy LaJoie spun off turn four. His car began flying and went underside-first into the inside wall (which Rudd had luckily just missed) before flipping end over end to a hard stop. LaJoie suffered back injuries. The next day, in a consolation race for cars that failed to qualify for the big race, Natz Peters's car ricocheted off the inside wall into the path of another car, driven by Jim Hurlbert. Both cars exploded in flames. Neither driver was seriously injured.\nAlong with Waltrip's vicious crash at Daytona the previous year, by the time the Series returned to Daytona for the Firecracker 400 in July, the entire Turn 4 apron was paved over, the beginning of tracks paving aprons for cars to scrub off speed on asphalt aprons instead of grass, which did little to slow spinning cars. The backstretch apron was paved in 1995, and following a serious incident at the 2015 Saturday support race for the Daytona 500 that injured Kyle Busch, the section of track past the tri-oval to Turn 1 was paved over and barriers realigned to temporarily seal off the road course during oval races. In 2020, the Turn 4 apron became part of the track after a chicane was built in the area near the finish line was implemented to slow entrance speeds into Turn 1 of the road course. During the 2021 Busch Clash, Chase Elliott and Ryan Blaney collided in that chicane on the run to the finish, leading to Kyle Busch winning.\nFailed to qualify.\n' = Daytona 500 rookie&lt;br&gt;' = Former Daytona 500 winner\nRace Summary.\nPresident Ronald Reagan gave the command \"Gentlemen, start your engines!\" by phone from the White House. Yarborough, Allison, Dale Earnhardt and Richard Petty took turns leading the early laps of the race, but Petty and Allison fell out early with mechanical problems. Yarborough clearly had the strongest car, leading 51 of the first 100 laps. Yarborough's car was so fast, he twice passed leading cars on the outside of the third turn.\nYarborough led most of the second half of the race, but Earnhardt and Terry Labonte were also strong, as well as Bill Elliott and Darrell Waltrip, who lead for the first time on lap 142. Waltrip took the lead again on lap 162 during green flag pit stops. The race's final caution came at lap 177, but four leaders, Waltrip, Yarborough, Labonte and Earnhardt-decided to remain on the track and hold their positions.\nAfter the race resumed on lap 183, six cars pulled away from the field. And as the final lap started, it was Waltrip, Yarborough, Earnhardt, Neil Bonnett, Harry Gant, and Bill Elliott. For 38 laps, Waltrip hung onto the lead. But he knew how fast Yarborough was. Yarborough made his move on the backstretch-the same move that had failed spectacularly in 1979 against Donnie Allison but worked perfectly in 1983 against Baker. Waltrip moved to the middle of the track but did not aggressively block. Yarborough made the pass without drafting help and immediately extended his lead to about 6 car-lengths.\nDale Earnhardt also moved on Waltrip but didn't begin his pass until turn four. He barely nipped Waltrip at the line, while Bonnett held off Elliott for fourth. Yarborough won by eight car lengths. And for the first time since Fireball Roberts in 1962, a single driver had led the most laps, won the pole, his qualifying race, and the 500. This made Yarborough become the only driver to win the Daytona 500 from the pole more than once until Elliott joined him after winning the following year and in 1987.\nRace Results.\nBox Score.\n(5) Indicates 5 bonus points added to normal race points scored for leading 1 lap&lt;br&gt;(10) Indicates 10 bonus points added to normal race points scored for leading 1 lap &amp; leading the most laps \nCautions.\n7 for 39 laps\nLap leader breakdown.\n' = Daytona 500 rookie&lt;br&gt;' = Former Daytona 500 winner"

The two main issues were the IBF's acceptance of Taiwan (ROC) as a national organization, and its refusal to dismiss the South African association due to the apartheid policies of the then South African government.\nConferences called by the Asian Badminton Confederation (now known as the Badminton Asia Confederation) were held in September and November 1977 which resulted in the withdrawal of the African Badminton Union (now Badminton Confederation of Africa) from the IBF. The founding of the World Badminton Federation was officially proclaimed at a third conference held in Hong Kong in February 1978. Twenty-two nations and regions, nearly all from Asia or Africa joined the federation: Bangladesh, Brunei, China, Ghana, Guyana, Hong Kong, India, Iran, Kenya, Malaysia, Mauritius, Nepal, Nigeria, North Korea, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Thailand and Zambia. Austria, France, Mexico (on behalf of the Pan American Badminton Confederation), Sweden, West Germany and Yugoslavia sent non-voting observers to attend the conference.\nDuring its establishment, the World Badminton Federation organized two editions of its own World Championship, one held in Bangkok in 1978, the other in Hangzhou in 1979.\nUnion.\nThe union with the International Badminton Federation was brought into being following the decision of Taiwan to change the name of its organization to the Chinese Taipei Badminton Association and a promise from South African Badminton Union not to participate in the Thomas and Uber Cups or IBF World Championships. Relatively minor changes in voting rules were also approved.\nIn March 1981, a special conference was held with the voting result of 57 to 4 in support of unification. On May 26, 1981, the World Badminton Federation officially united with International Badminton Federation."

        "title": "Rugby league in Victoria",
        "text": "Rugby league football has been played and watched by people in the Australian state of Victoria since the early 20th century. While for most of its history there the game's popularity has been marginal due to the dominance of Australian rules football in Victoria, rugby league's popularity has rapidly increased in recent years in the state's capital of Melbourne, due mainly to the introduction of a professional Melbourne-based team in the national competition.\nProfessional teams visited Melbourne as early as 1914 and occasional exhibition matches were held by clubs from New South Wales, however it was not until 1998 that the first professional club formed in Victoria, the Melbourne Storm, an expansion club to join the National Rugby League premiership.\nThe Australian Rugby League reports that over $23 million has been invested by the Melbourne Storm and its partners in promoting and developing rugby league in Victoria since 2005 and the club has visited more than 550 schools across the state. Participation has grown significantly since 2006, with 13 amateur clubs playing in the state in 2008, according to the Victorian Rugby League before further expansion prior to the 2009 season saw the competition expand into a divisional league during the 2010s.\nHistory.\nThe modern code of rugby league.\nIn 1895, rugby football underwent a schism in England over the issues of expenses and payment to injured players. This led it to split into rugby union and rugby league. Luring professional sportsmen, the new code of rugby league arrived in Australia in 1907 and came to dominate the sporting scene in Queensland and New South Wales. However, it was not immediately introduced into Victoria, where Australian rules football's VFL, which paid players, was already increasingly popular. Rugby union, however, continued to be played in Victoria by a small number of amateurs.\nThe 1914 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand included a match in Melbourne, the first rugby league game to be played in the state. The match between England and New South Wales drew 13,000 spectators.\nThe Victorian Rugby League was running a rugby league premiership by the 1920s, and also selected a representative Victorian XIII to tour domestically.\nThe first interstate match held in Victoria was between Western Australia and Victoria at Yarra Park in 1952.\nThe occasional New South Wales Rugby League Premiership match was taken to Melbourne over the following decades - the most notorious being in 1978 when Manly and Western Suburbs initiated their 'Fibros v Silvertails' battles. \nIn 1991 the St Kilda Football Club unsuccessfully sought to have NSWRL games played at Moorabbin Oval. but the NSWRL had let Melbourne host a number of premiership games during the early 1990s; with a 1993 Western Suburbs Magpies home game against the St George. Dragons played at Olympic Park. The next season, the Sydney Tigers played two home games at Princes Park.\nBut attendances for the State of Origin games in the state during the 1990s had been strong. The 1990 State of Origin played at Olympic Park, attracted a capacity crowd of 25,800, and three more were held in 1994, 1995 and 1997 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Over those 3 years, 160,000 people attended; including a then Australian rugby league record crowd of 87,161 in 1994.\nIn 1991 the first match of the Test series between New Zealand and Australia was played at Olympic Park in front of a crowd of 26,900, the first time a rugby league test match played in Australia was held outside of New South Wales and Queensland. The next year, the second Test between Great Britain and Australia was played at Princes Park in front of a crowd of 33,005. \nThe first professional team emerges.\nIn August 1991 the NSWRL began to express interest for its 1993 competition, and made a request to the Victorian Rugby League to put forward a proposal. The local league showed significant hesitation, indicating that the game had little support to build upon.\nHowever, during 1993 ARL Chairman Ken Arthurson made it clear that he remained positive about Melbourne and thought it had much to offer. Former Melbourne CEO Chris Johns said; \"John and I had been with the Broncos from day one and we had learnt first-hand how the club had progressed in 10 years to become a 'super club'. Melbourne had three times the population of Brisbane and the people down there just love their sport\".\nPlans to enter Melbourne gained momentum in November 1994 when both the ARL and the organisers of the (then called) News Limited rebel competition both began initiatives to fast track their own teams in the Victorian capital.\nIn 1996, the Australian Rugby League (ARL) decided to establish a Melbourne-based team due to the high attendances at recent State of Origin matches. But in May 1997, Super League boss John Ribot pushed for a Melbourne-based club in the Super League competition, which was the rival against the ARL competition. Former Brisbane Broncos centre Chris Johns became the CEO of the club and Ribot stepped down from head of the Super League to set up the club. The club would be fully owned by News Limited who had a position of influence through their ownership in the Herald Sun, with part of its strategy to use Melbourne's most popular newspaper to provide contra media exposure for the new club. In September 1997, Melbourne announced that Chris Anderson would be their foundation coach, and then the Super League announced that their new team would be named the Melbourne Storm and it would be based at Olympic Park Stadium.\nThe new millennium.\nThe 2003 NRL grand final attracted a bigger audience in Melbourne than the 2003 AFL Grand Final did in Sydney. In 2006 the deciding game of the State of Origin drew 54,833 spectators at Telstra Dome. Also that season, Melbourne's television audience for the Storm's NRL grand final appearance was higher than Sydney's was for the Swans' second successive AFL grand final appearance. This would occur again in 2016.\nThe 2007 preliminary final between Parramatta and Melbourne Storm saw the largest ever crowd drawn by the Storm in Melbourne, 33,472. It was a larger than Manly's preliminary final crowd of 32,611.\nIn 2007 the Victorian Government confirmed that it would be building a new 31,500 rectangular stadium at Olympic Park, for rugby league, union and soccer.\nThe opening round of the 2008 season saw 20,084 spectators watch the Storm defeat New Zealand Warriors in their first game at Telstra Dome. Melbourne finished the 2008 season with a home average attendance of 12,474, considerably larger than their 2007 average of 11,711. They recorded their largest crowd average ever in the 2010 season at 14,670. For the 2008 Rugby League World Cup, the only game in Melbourne against England drew a crowd of 36,297 at the Telstra Dome. This was the second highest attended game in the competition, surpassed only by the final, played in Brisbane that drew 50,559.\n2015 saw new records set for rugby league in Victoria with 91,513 spectators attending the second Origin match at the MCG, won by NSW.\nThe Storm who have won four premierships to date: (1999, 2012, 2017, 2020); as of 2022 regularly attract over 16,000 people to matches, and set a new club membership record of over 40,000.\nIn a boost for the code in Victoria, Victoria's Rugby League Centre of Excellence was constructed at Seabrook Reserve in Broadmeadows, with the $16.9 million facility opening in 2023. The facility serves as the home ground for Northern Thunder as well as the administration base for NRL Victoria and Touch Football Victoria. It additionally serves as a hub for rugby league programs, and a venue for training, camps and state and national level tournaments, and is also set to serve as the home ground of any future Melbourne Storm NRLW team. Features of the facility include a show pitch, three community access competition pitches, a female-friendly pavilion including high-performance training and recovery facilities, and car parking.\nParticipation.\nPlayers such as Jeremy Smith, born in New Zealand, and Gareth Widdop, born in England, have come through the junior ranks in Melbourne.\nIn round 23 2012, Mahe Fonua became the first Victorian-born and bred player to play in the NRL when he made his debut for Melbourne Storm. He played his junior career for South East Titans (formerly Berwick Bulldogs) in the Victorian Rugby League.\nAlthough born in Samoa, Young Tonumaipea and Richard Kennar both emigrated to Melbourne at young ages and played their junior football with local side Northern Thunder before making their senior NRL debuts for Melbourne Storm.\nThe junior team (which is largely made up of Victorian locals) were runners up to the Bulldogs in the S.

He uses the nickname \"Superman\" for his matches.\nDarting history.\nMatt Clark first started playing darts at the age of 19 at his local village pub, and after a few years was playing for the Kent county team. At the age of 24 he began moving towards pro darts attending the Dutch Open where he made the quarter finals of the pairs and singles competitions. Clark appeared in the BDO World Darts Championship eight successive years, reaching the quarter-finals in 1996.\nHe switched to the PDC in 2004 and quickly reached the top 32 in the world rankings. He made his PDC World Darts Championship debut in 2006 and reached the second round, losing to eventual champion Phil Taylor. He entered the 2007 tournament as the number 31 seed, but lost in the first round to Mick McGowan. In 2008, Clark lost in the first round to Roland Scholten. Despite losing, Clark won more legs than Scholten, Clark winning 12 to Scholten's 10. However, he gained revenge on Scholten having qualified for the 2008 World Matchplay through the Players Championship Order of Merit and defeating him 10–4 in the first round. He continued to defeat veteran Peter Manley 13–6 in an upset and reached the quarter-finals, his best performance in the competition, before being defeated by defending champion James Wade, despite checking out at 161 which was the highest checkout of that year's tournament. Prior to the Matchplay Event Matt lost 3 stone in weight which forced him to change his throwing stance.\nClark suffered a first round exit in the 2009 PDC World Darts Championship, losing to Kevin Painter in a sudden leg death which Clark missed one dart at double 12 to win.\nAfter losing his PDC Tour Card at the end of 2017, Clark decided to play some of the BDO Tour and the PDC Challenge Tour. A final in the Luxembourg Open and a quarter-final in the Belfry Open were followed by an agonising loss in the BDO World Championship qualifiers when he was one win from qualifying. Clark also made a quarter-final on the Challenge Tour in 2018 before re-entering PDC UK Q-School in January 2019. A last 16 exit on day two put him in a good position to win back his Tour Card, and he did it by right on the third day, beating Gavin Carlin 5–2 in the final to seal a two-year PDC Tour Card. Matt Clark also took part in the PDC Home Tour, on Saturday 25 April 2020, missing out on winning his group by one leg. The other three players in his group consisted of Harry Ward, Martijn Kleermaker and Michael Smith.\nCareer statistics.\n(W) Won; (F) finalist; (SF) semifinalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (Prel.)

        "text": "Michael A. Smith (born 1945 in Potsdam, New York) is an American former college hockey player, professional coach and front office executive who has worked with the original Winnipeg Jets, Chicago Blackhawks and Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League (NHL). Since 2003, Smith has worked as a scout and with two companies specializing in hockey analytics.\nBeginnings in hockey.\nSmith was born and raised in Potsdam and attended Potsdam Central High School where he was on the hockey team. Smith earned a Bachelor of Science degree in social sciences at Clarkson University, where he also played hockey. He then transferred to Syracuse University where he earned a doctorate in sociology. While in graduate school at Syracuse, he was the head coach for two seasons at Christian Brothers Academy.\nNHL years.\nIn 1979, Smith had his first job with the Winnipeg Jets, when he was hired as coach of the Tulsa farm team. He spent fourteen years in the Jets organization, where he became best known as a pioneer in bringing Russian players into the league. He became director of scouting, then assistant general manager after Michael Doran, the then assistant general manager, was injured in an automobile accident in November 1984. In September 1988, the Jets fired John Ferguson, giving the GM job to Smith on an interim basis before making him the permanent General Manager in December. Smith was manager of the Jets from 1988 to 1994.\nSmith worked as a scout for the Chicago Blackhawks and assisted the USA Hockey program until August 1997, when Smith was appointed the associate General Manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs. Anders Hedberg was also made Personnel Director. A couple of Smith's noteworthy non-player moves during his time with the Leafs were the hiring of Pat Quinn as head coach and managing assistant Mike Kitchen. Despite the 28 point turnaround and franchise record in wins, Smith's contract wasn't renewed.\nIn December 1999, the Chicago Blackhawks named Smith Manager of Hockey Operations. Nine months later he became the club's seventh GM. Smith had an immediate impact, as the Blackhawks made the playoffs for the first time in five years during the 2001–02 season. He would be the Blackhawks' GM for three years. He was fired by the Hawks in October 2003.\nOther hockey activities.\nIn 1999, Smith was inducted into the New York High School Hockey Hall of Fame. In 2006, Smith joined Coleman Analytics to help that company develop and market an analytics package for NHL teams. In 2015, Smith was hired by Bench Metrics to develop a product to help teams apply analytics for teams to use in the NHL Entry Draft.\nAchievements.\nDuring his tenure with the Winnipeg Jets, Smith acquired Randy Cunneyworth, Rick Tabaracci and Dave McLlwain from the Pittsburgh Penguins for Randy Gilhen, Andrew McBain and Jim Kyte at the 1989 NHL Entry Draft. The move helped the Jets rebound to a respectable 37-32-11, a 21-point improvement over the previous season. Smith would also trade Ed Olczyk to the New York Rangers for fan favorites Tie Domi and Kris King on December 28, 1992. The move brought a physical presence, that the Jets desperately needed.\nIn his first year presiding over the Toronto Maple Leafs, Smith established a franchise record for wins at 45. Many site the omnibus FA signings he made after he was hired during the summer of 1998 which included Steve Thomas, Curtis Joseph, Sylvain Cote, and checking forwards Derek King and Kris King who played an integral support role for the team.\nSmith was named Executive of the Year by The Sporting News after the 2001–02 season, while with the Blackhawks. Mike Smith drafted several future NHL stars, such as Brent Seabrook, Duncan Keith, Dustin Byfuglien, Alexei Zhamnov, Nikolai Khabibulin, Keith Tkachuk, Kris Draper, Corey Crawford, James Wisniewski, and Stu Barnes.\nCriticisms.\nWhen it comes to the NHL entry draft, Smith has been perceived as favoring Russian players over the physical style types often seen in the North American junior systems. Smith made some very questionable draft choices during his final three years as Winnipeg Jets GM, drafting Aaron Ward in 1991, ahead of future stars Peter Forsberg, Brian Rolston, and Alexei Kovalev. In 1992, he drafted 25-year-old Sergei Bautin, who had an unremarkable NHL career. In 1993, Smith drafted Mats Lindgren, who also made little impact in the NHL.\nSmith was largely responsible for forcing Dale Hawerchuk, the Jets franchise player, out of Winnipeg. Years later, Hawerchuk would state \"In my era there were two Winnipegs. There was the John Ferguson era, which was positive, upbeat, a really community-driven team. And then the Mike Smith era, which was negative and pessimistic. That ran through the media. I thought I'd be a Winnipeg Jet forever, but at the end Mike pretty much made it impossible for me to really push forward with my career there.\"\nSmith made some questionable trades that would come back to haunt the Jets. During the Summer of 1993, Smith would send future Olympian, and Frank J. Selke Trophy winner Kris Draper to the Detroit Red Wings for $1.00. Smith would also trade NHL All-Star Phil Housley to the St. Louis Blues for Nelson Emerson and Stephane Quintal. On November 25, 1993, Smith would trade star forward Stu Barnes along with a sixth round selection (previously acquired from the St. Louis Blues; Chris Kibermanis) in 1994 to the Florida Panthers for Randy Gilhen.\nMike Smith was mainly responsible for dismantling a young, and promising Winnipeg Jets team. By the time Smith was relieved of his Managing duties in January 1994, the Jets were last in the Western Conference.\nWork with Team USA.\nSmith has been heavily involved with USA Hockey, having served as the coach and general manager for the team's 1981, 1994 and 1995 appearances at the IIHF World Hockey Championship. In addition, he serves on the advisory board to USA Hockey.\nPersonal life.\nSmith is widowed after his wife Judith succumbed to cancer in the fall of 2000. The couple had one son, Jason. Smith has authored ten books related to coaching in hockey at the grassroots level and is an avid collector of Native American artwork."

        "title": "Horse racing in Japan",
        "text": " is a popular equestrian sport, with more than 21,000 horse races held each year. There are three types of racing that take place in Japan - flat racing, jump racing, and Ban'ei Racing (also called Draft Racing).\nIn Japan, horse racing is organized by the Japan Racing Association (JRA) and the National Association of Racing (NAR). The JRA is responsible for horseracing events at ten major racecourses in metropolitan areas, while the NAR is responsible for various local horseracing events throughout Japan. This system of administration of horse racing is unique to Japan.\nJapan's top stakes races are run in the spring, autumn, and winter; the top race is the Japan Cup.\nHistory.\nThe history of equestrian sports and horse racing in Japan goes back many centuries, but it was not until the Spring of 1862 that the first horse race in a recognizably European format was organized by a group of British residents on an area of drained marshland just outside the recently opened treaty port of Yokohama.\nAfter a series of informal races were held on the location often referred to as the Swamp Ground, in 1866 the Negishi Racecourse was constructed to provide a more permanent site adjacent to the expanding Yamate residential district. Initially intended as an entertainment venue for the foreign community, the racecourse rapidly became popular with Japanese society; the Emperor Meiji himself visiting on 14 separate occasions. The popularity of horse racing spread rapidly in the vicinity of other treaty ports; the Kobe Jockey Club following the Yokohama precedent, was established in 1870.\nEarly in the development of the sport Japan adopted an integrated approach to both thoroughbred breeding and racing. The close financially supportive relationship between these two industries enabled both to grow significantly during the post Second World War economic boom. The Japan Racing Association was formally established in 1954.\nThe Japan Cup, one of the richest horse races in the world, was inaugurated in 1981. Run at Tokyo's Fuchu Racecourse on the last Sunday in November, it continues to attract thoroughbreds from all over the world.\nJapan Racing Association.\nThe JRA manages the ten main tracks in Japan. Races at these tracks are called \"Chuo Keiba\" (meaning \"central horse racing\"). It provides some of the richest racing in the world. , a typical JRA maiden race for three-year-olds carried a purse of ¥9.55 million (about US$112,000), with ¥5 million (about US$59,000) paid to the winner. Purses for graded stakes races begin at ¥74.6 million (about US$882,000).\nThe country's most prominent race is the Grade 1 Japan Cup, a invitational turf race run every November at Tokyo Racecourse for a purse of ¥476 million (about US$5.6 million), which used to be the richest turf race in the world. Other noted stakes races include the February Stakes, Takamatsunomiya Kinen, Yasuda Kinen, Takarazuka Kinen, Arima Kinen, and the Tenno Sho races run in the spring and autumn. The Satsuki Sho, Tokyo Yushun, and Kikuka Sho comprise the Japanese Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing.\nNational Association of Racing.\nThe NAR control what is called \"Chihou Keiba\" (meaning \"local horse racing\"). The fifteen Chihou Keiba tracks are operated by municipal racing authorities and run under the affiliation of the National Association of Racing (NAR). These races are smaller than JRA races, with the exception of Minami-kanto Keiba (a group of four tracks - Oi, Urawa, Funabashi and Kawasaki). All tracks of Minami-kanto Keiba are located in the Kanto region, including many large cities.\nUnlike the JRA, the NAR mainly organize dirt graded events (except for Morioka Racecourse which has turf), of which the JRA has few, including the international Grade 1 race, Tokyo Daishōten, and a number of domestic Grade 1 events like Teio sho, Kashiwa Kinen and the Japan Breeders' Cup series.\nThe global financial crisis has caused serious problems for Chihou Keiba. Local government finances have suffered from growing cumulative deficits, leading some local governments to discuss whether to keep or close their horseracing facilities. In 2011, Arao City in Kumamoto prefecture decided to close its track, which was the oldest one in the NAR. Fukuyama City's racetrack was closed 2013.\nRestrictions.\nHorses belonging to the JRA cannot participate in NAR events unless they are designated \"exchange races\" or \"Dirt-Graded races\". The reverse applies to NAR horses, although they can participate in JRA Grade 1 turf events by either getting qualified in respective step races or winning a dirt/international Grade 1 event. Horse transfer between the JRA and the NAR is possible. Oguri Cap, the JRA Hall of Fame horse and Inari One, winner of Arima Kinen in 1989, both debuted in NAR before transfer to JRA.\nAlthough JRA racing is considered to be more popular and more competitive, sometimes NAR horses have represented Japan in races outside Japan instead of JRA horses. For example, Cosmo Bulk (from Hokkaido Keiba) won the Singapore Airlines International Cup in 2006 as a NAR horse.\nAs protection for the Japanese breeding industry, horses which were not bred in Japan (or in a few cases, not having a Japanese sire) were, in the past, usually barred from many important races, including the Triple Crown. The trend began to change in the early 90s, when progeny of imported stallions, particularly Tony Bin (Italy), Brian's Time and Sunday Silence(both US), had remarkable success in both racing and breeding. This was particularly the case with Sunday Silence, who was the leading sire for 10 years (his progeny would succeed him for another 3 years). Sunday Silence sired winners in Grade 1 races outside Japan (one each in the Hong Kong Vase, Hong Kong Mile and Dubai Sheema Classic) and a number of graded races all over the world. Since the mid-2000s, most of the horses in Japan, including many overseas group race winner, had sires bred in Japan. Some of them also have a successful breeding record outside Japan - the daughter of Deep Impact, Beauty Parlour won the French classic race, the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches in 2012. The son of Hat Trick, Dabirsim was honored with Cartier Two-Year-Old Colt Award winner in 2011. Since the early 2000s, most of the bars on non-Japanese bred horses and sires have been lifted, although Japanese-bred horses are still considered to be more successful than imported horse in Japanese racing nowadays.\nJumps racing.\nJapan's top jump race is the Nakayama Grand Jump, run every April at Nakayama Racecourse. Instead of running over a large course as is the case in other countries, the course for the Nakayama Grand Jump follows a twisted path on the inside portion of Nakayama's racing ovals. The race carries a purse of ¥142.5 million (about US$1.68 million). In Japan, jump racing is generally less popular than flat racing. Racecourses do not hold more than two jump races in a single day.\nEvery Japanese jump horse has experience of running on the flat. Usually, all of them aim for success on the flat. They are only trained for jumping after they have retired from the flat. In Japan, unlike Europe, very few horses are bred specifically for jumping.\nFamous jockeys.\nThe top jockey in Japan is Yutaka Take, who is a multiple champion in his homeland and regularly rides Japanese horses in stakes races around the world. Yutaka Take was the regular jockey for Deep Impact, the 2005 Japan Triple Crown winner and JRA's two time \"Horse of the Year\" (2005–06), as well as Kitasan Black, another horse who was awarded the \"Horse of the Year\" two years in a row (2016-17). \nFrom 1994, the JRA gives short-term riding licenses (allowing maximum of 3 months in a year) to foreign jockeys. Many world-class jockeys take an active part in Japanese horse racing using these short-term licenses, including Olivier Peslier, Christophe Soumillon, Mirco Demuro (elder brother of Cristian Demuro, who has also participated in JRA races), Christophe Lemaire, Craig Williams, Ryan Moore, Joao Moreira, Oisin Murphy, and Damian Lane.\nAnd from 2014, the JRA allows full-year licenses to foreign jockeys, with Demuro and Lemaire taking these licenses in 2015. Lemaire went on to become the leading jockey in four years straight, from 2017 to 2021.\nVictoire Pisa won the richest race, Dubai World Cup in 2011, under Demuro.\nOther notable jockeys:\nMajor horse races.\nJapan Road to the Kentucky Derby.\nThe following races are designated as preliminaries for the Kentucky Derby."

        "text": "Tommy Banks (born c. 1979) is a former American football fullback.\nBorn in West Monroe, Louisiana, he starred at West Monroe High School under legendary coach Don Shows before earning a scholarship to Louisiana State University, where he played from 1997 to 2000. Banks cemented his place in LSU lore by scoring a touchdown in an upset win over the top ranked and defending national champion Florida Gators in 1997. On the play, he dove into the end zone with a defender draped on him, for a 7-yard touchdown that put LSU up 14-0. The dive was immortalized in the October 20, 1997 issue of \"Sports Illustrated\", which contained an article recapping the game. Banks ended his LSU career with a record tying two touchdown performance in LSU's 28-14 victory over Georgia Tech in the 2000 Peach Bowl."

        "text": "The 1972 Major League Baseball season was the first to have games cancelled by a player strike. It was also the last season in which American League pitchers would hit for themselves on a regular basis; the designated hitter rule would go into effect the following season.\nLabor strike and more moving.\n1972 was affected by a players' strike over pension and salary arbitration. The strike erased the first week and a half of the season, cancelling 86 games, and the leagues decided to just excise the lost portion of the season with no makeups. As a result, an uneven number of games were lost by each team; some as few as six, some as many as nine. The lack of makeups, even when they affected the playoffs, led to the Boston Red Sox losing the American League East by half a game to the Detroit Tigers, who played one more game (156 to 155).\n1972 marked the first year for the Texas Rangers, who had moved to Arlington from Washington, D.C. (where they played as the Washington Senators) after the 1971 season. The team was one of the worst ever fielded by the franchise, losing 100 games for the first time since 1964. Manager Ted Williams hated it in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, and resigned at the end of the season.\nTo make room for the Rangers in the American League West Division, one of the teams already in that division would have to switch to the East Division. Technically, both the Chicago White Sox and the Milwaukee Brewers were the easternmost teams in the West Division, but only one of them could move, although the Minnesota Twins lobbied to keep the Rangers in the East because it wanted both the Brewers and White Sox as division rivals. It was decided that Milwaukee, as the newer franchise, would make the move, even though the White Sox wanted to go to the East since five of the league's original franchises were in that division, and that the Cubs were in the National League East. The Brewers would become division rivals of the Twins and White Sox in 1994 with the formation of the American League Central, but this would last only through 1997, when Milwaukee transferred to the National League and became a division rival of the Cubs (the Brewers and Twins continue to face each other every year through interleague play).\n1972 would mark the Kansas City Royals' final year at Kansas City Municipal Stadium, as the next year they would move to Royals Stadium at the Truman Sports Complex in eastern Kansas City. The Royals had hoped to move out of Municipal after the 1971 season, but a series of labor strikes forced the team to spend one more year at the old facility, which hosted the Athletics from 1955-67 (and the National Football League's Chiefs from 1963–71).\nMost teams (16 of 24) switched from wool flannel uniforms to double knit uniforms made of nylon and rayon at the outset of 1972. The Pirates were first to adopt double knits when they moved from Forbes Field to Three Rivers Stadium in July 1970. The Cardinals switched at the start of the 1971 season, and the Orioles gradually phased out their flannels throughout 1971, becoming all-double knit in time for the postseason.\nThe Giants wore flannels until midseason, going to double knits at home only; the flannels would not be phased out for the road uniforms until 1973. The Red Sox switched to double knits midway through 1972. Only the Royals, Expos and Yankees wore flannels full-time during the 1972 season, and all three converted to double knits for 1973 (the Royals waited to switch uniforms until their new stadium opened).\nThe World Series was won by the Oakland Athletics, the first of three straight behind the bats of Reggie Jackson and Bert Campaneris, and the pitching cadre of Catfish Hunter, Rollie Fingers, and Vida Blue. Jackie Robinson, the first black player in modern MLB history, threw out the first pitch prior to Game 2 in what would be his last public appearance. He died two days after the series ended at age 53 due to complications from diabetes and heart failure.\nThe year ended on a sad note when Roberto Clemente died in an airplane crash off the coast of San Juan, Puerto Rico, on New Year's Eve, while participating in aid efforts after the 1972 Nicaragua earthquake.\nStatistical leaders.\n1 National League Triple Crown Pitching Winner\nTelevision coverage.\nNBC was the exclusive national TV broadcaster of MLB. While the network had occasionally aired a limited number of Monday night games in past seasons, 1972 was the first year that NBC signed a contract for a regular slate of \"Monday Night Baseball\". The network continued to air the weekend \"Game of the Week\", the All-Star Game, both League Championship Series, and the World Series."
