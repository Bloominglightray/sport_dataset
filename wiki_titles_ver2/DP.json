        "title": "Seminole Golf Club",
        "text": "Seminole Golf Club is a private golf club in the southeastern United States, located in Juno Beach, Florida. Designed by Donald Ross in 1929, it is consistently ranked as one of the top 100 courses in the nation.\nHistory.\nInvestment banker Edward Francis Hutton began development of the private, Seminole Golf Club in 1929 on land previously owned by Harry Kelsey. The site chosen for the course featured a number of sand dune ridges that were carefully brought into play with some fairways directed towards elevated green sites while others drop down from sandy peaks to flatter terrain. Both nines set out from the clubhouse on level ground before veering into the dune ridge that runs alongside the western edge of the property.\nThe greens at Seminole are the main line of defense for the course and many of them are cleverly angled, narrowing towards the back which makes rear pin positions extremely tough. Fairway bunkers are generally shallow but sand traps adjacent to the putting surfaces are often deep and troublesome. The course is most noted for its clever routing on a fairly rectangular site, which results in a new wind direction on each hole.\nThe layout occupies a flat-bottomed bowl set between a high ridge of dunes to the west and the dunes along the Atlantic Ocean to the east. In the middle lie the necessary ponds to handle the drainage. Ross' layout managed to have 14 of the 18 holes touch these two lines of dunes (the 1st, 8th, 9th and 10th holes do not). To reflect and complement the sweep of the sandy property, Ross also used bunkering that was not typical of his other work. Instead of the more standard low-profile bunkering, Ross used flashed-face sand traps that are reminiscent of a George Thomas course rather than a Donald Ross work.\nThroughout its history, the club has long been known as a golf club for the corporate elite. In 1947, the club's members included Joseph P. Kennedy, Henry Ford II, Jack Chrysler, Paul Mellon, Phillip Armour, John Pillsbury and Robert Vanderbilt. The club has also hosted kings and presidents: President Dwight D. Eisenhower was an honorary member, Presidents Gerald Ford and John F. Kennedy played it often; and the Duke of Windsor was a member. Henry Picard, winner of the 1938 Masters Tournament, was the professional at Seminole for 26 years and Ben Hogan spent a significant amount of time here playing and practicing. More recently, several media outlets reported in April 2020 that NFL great Tom Brady had joined the club, shortly after he moved from his longtime team of the New England Patriots to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Gerry McIlroy, father of golf professional Rory McIlroy is a member at Seminole.\nFollowing a period of relative neglect during and after World War II, Dick Wilson was commissioned to restore the course to its former glory. The original Ross greens were re-grassed and new bunkers were installed, which were intended to mimic the crests of waves on the adjacent Atlantic. In 2016, Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw were tasked to carry out a three-year renovation of the course, which focused on the rebuilding of over 100 bunkers and exposed sandy expanses in the rough. The extent of the renovations over the years has remained relatively minor, and Seminole Golf Club, along with Pinehurst #2, are both considered by many to be Donald Ross' two masterpieces.\nIn May 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, the club hosted a charity skins game organized by Golf Channel, \"TaylorMade Driving Relief\", between Rory McIlroy, Dustin Johnson, Rickie Fowler and Matthew Wolff, with proceeds supporting responses to the pandemic by the American Nurses Foundation and CDC Foundation. It marked the first televised golf event in the United States since the aborted 2020 Players Championship, and the first televised event at the private club in its history.\nThe club hosted the Walker Cup in May 2021, a 14–12 victory for the United States."

The team plays in the Big 12 Conference at the United Spirit Arena in Lubbock, Texas. The season marked Pat Knight's first full season as head coach.\nPreseason.\nPersonnel changes.\nPat Knight took over the head coaching duties late in the 2007–08 season after Bob Knight resigned on February 4, 2008. This was Pat's first full season as head coach of the Red Raiders. Pat hired Bubba Jennings as an assistant coach in addition to Chris Beard and Stew Robinson.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=8| Big 12 tournament\nSource for regular season\nSource for Big 12 Tournament\nNotable games and events.\nEast Central.\nIn the third game of the season, Texas Tech defeated Division II opponent East Central 167–115, setting a new school record for most points scored in a game. The previous record of 128 was set in the double overtime victory over Texas on February 20, 1994. The combined total of 282 points also became a new record.\nWichita State.\nTexas Tech led the Wichita State Shockers 43–26 going into halftime. The lead quickly deteriorated as Wichita State went on a 12–3 run to open the second half. The Shockers eventually tied the game with about 41 seconds remaining. Mike Singletary then hit a 3-pointer with 4.1 seconds left to give the Red Raiders the win, 72–69.\nNebraska.\nIn a 69–82 loss to Nebraska, Knight ran onto the court to argue with officials after Texas Tech player Alan Voskuil was called for a foul. After receiving two technical fouls, Knight was ejected from the game. Once in the tunnel, Knight ran back onto the court to continue arguing. Knight was not suspended, rather receiving a public reprimand from the Big 12 Conference.\nTexas.\nThe Red Raiders were without head coach Pat Knight against Texas after he was suspended for criticizing the officials in a game four days earlier against Texas A&amp;M.\nKansas.\nTexas Tech upset #9 Kansas 84–65 at home on senior night. Senior Alan Voskuil had a career high 35 points, going 9–14 from 3-point range and 10–17 overall. It was Kansas' worst defeat of the season and marked their third straight loss at the United Spirit Arena.\nBig 12 Tournament.\nThe only chance the Red Raiders had at making the postseason was to win the Big 12 tournament where the winner receives an automatic bid in the NCAA tournament. Texas Tech went into the tournament as the #11 seed after losing to Iowa State 76–78 in the last game of the regular season, thus giving Iowa State the #10 seed.\nTexas A&amp;M.\nTexas A&amp;M took a 29–48 lead into halftime and built it up to 21 early in the second half. In the second half, sophomore Mike Singletary scored 29 points in a row to help Texas Tech take a 79–78 lead with 39.4 seconds left in the game and eventually win 88–83. Singletary finished the game with 43 points, a career high and Big 12 tournament record for most points in a single game. Mike Singletary's 29 consecutive points is the second longest streak in NCAA history and Texas Tech's comeback from 21 points down is a Big 12 Tournament record.\nMissouri.\nTexas Tech was able to manage a 31–31 halftime tie against #3 seed Missouri. In the second half, however, Missouri's full-court press defense allowed the Tigers to go on a 13 point run early in the second half. Mike Singletary led Texas Tech with 17 points and Missouri's DeMarre Carroll had 19 to help Missouri win 81–60."

Originally opened as a nine-hole course, it was extended to the full 18 holes by 1893 and is now a 6,005-yard course.\nBushey Hall history.\nThe first captain of Bushey Hall Golf Club was A. J. Balfour who accepted presidency at the first official meeting on 24 March 1890.\nThroughout Bushey's history the club was run by a series of different proprietors, who through various measures ensured the club thrived. The fairways received an enviable reputation and the clubhouse was extended to cover two storeys with an open veranda overlooking the 18th hole for £1,100.\nFirst and Second World Wars.\nDuring both the world wars the club was requisitioned by the government, during the first used as a training depot for the Brigade of Guards and during the second as a base for American forces. Unlike the First World War, during the Second World War play was allowed at the course, although access to the clubhouse was restricted. The club was a part of the Coats Mission, a plan to evacuate the Royal Family in the case of a German invasion.\nRecent history.\nIn 1986, the freehold of the course and club was sold to London-based hotel group Veladail Leisure, who now own and operate the club. Over half a million pounds has recently been spent on new tees, irrigation systems, golf buggies, equipment for maintaining the course and refurbishing the club house.\nIn October 2019 the course closed. The reason for this was due to the clubhouse being demolished, to be replaced with 32 new flats. A new clubhouse is due to be built on the site and the clube re-opened in 2021.\nRumours linking course to Watford F.C..\nEarly 2020 rumours of Watford F.C. purchasing the site and building a new stadium have started to circulate around social media platforms, with plans and artistic impressions being shared."

        "title": "List of baseball parks in San Francisco",
        "text": "Early history of baseball in San Francisco, California.\nPortsmouth Square.\nIt has been speculated that the game of baseball was played in California by men during the Gold Rush of 1849 when Alexander Cartwright, who is sometimes referred to as \"the father of baseball\", came to San Francisco and is reported to have brought his baseball to the city in 1849. The Daily Alta California newspaper reports a game of base ball being played upon the Plaza (Portsmouth Square) \"by a number of the sporting gentlemen about town\", on February 3, 1851. Mention of the play of a game of Townball at Portmouth Square is recorded in The Daily Alta California newspaper on January 14, 1852. An early town leader serving on the city council as \"second alcalde\", or assistant mayor, of San Francisco during the years 1849-1854 was Frank Turk a New York Knickerbocker. According to historian Frank Joel, baseball was formally introduced into California, at San Francisco in 1859.\nThe beginning years, 1860s.\nIn the 1860s baseball grew in prominence in San Francisco, with the first game reported to be between the Eagles and the Red Rovers on February 22, 1860. The San Francisco Directory in 1860 identifies three base ball clubs, the Eagle, Em Quad, and Excelsior Clubs. In 1867 it was reported that \"baseball clubs are now the rage\" and the game of baseball drew plaudits from influential quarters. That year marked the establishment of the first baseball league in San Francisco known as the Pacific Coast Base Ball Convention with play 14 clubs from San Francisco, Oakland and Santa Clara county. The San Francisco clubs were named the Eagles, Pacifics, Lafayettes, Knickerbockers, Atlantics, Bay City, Empires, Brodericks and the Cosmopolitans. The 1867 championship game, between the Atlantic and Cosmopolitan clubs, was won by the Cosmopolitans by a score 50 to 45 on April 27, 1867. In the 1870s additional teams were named the Libertys, Wide Awakes (Oakland), Alhambra, Americans, Excelciors and the San Franciscos.\nFirst baseball park, Recreation Grounds.\nCalifornia's and San Francisco's first enclosed professional baseball park, located in the heavily Irish workingman Mission District, was named simply 'The Recreation Grounds' and opened November 26, 1868 and operated until November 23, 1884. Built on the site of the Pioneer Race Course, a horse race track owned by George Treat, the facility was used for multiple purposes including base ball games and cricket matches as early as October 1860. The grandstand accommodated initially a capacity of 12,000 fans and was later expanded to hold 17,000. Home of the Pacific Baseball League beginning in 1878, the ballpark was owned and operated by the politically active Captain Al Fritz of the influential Workingman's Party of California in partnership with Samuel Shear on land leased from San Francisco Mayor Andrew J. Bryant. In later years, after the death of Fritz, the Recreation Grounds was leased by Waller Walace and Andy Pierce for organized ball play with the preeminent team of that era being the Haverlys. In 1879 league play included a new Military League, organized by newspaper reporter Joseph H. McCloskey, drawn from teams of local militias which were generally aligned along ethnic lines. The period of 1881 to 1886 saw league play from the California League which failed to achieve much organizational competence; during the year 1883, for instance, there were only 36 games among four teams.\nThe ballpark was bounded by Harrison, Twenty-Fifth, Folsom and Twenty-Sixth Streets, including present day Garfield Square. Photo. Other teams playing in Recreation Grounds included the Eagles, Wide Awakes, Niantics, Woonsockets and Reddingtons.\nAmateur and practice fields.\n19th Century amateur and practice fields. During the 1870s and 1880s baseball was a very popular recreation in San Francisco with amateur games and practices held prior to professional games at the professional parks, and at fields located at 15th and Folsom, 25th and Howard in the Mission District, at 8th and Harrison South of Market and at Filmore and Geary in the Richmond. A sand lot baseball field was located at Pierce and Haight Streets, 1886 photo.\nUnion Grounds.\nOpened in October 1879. Used for baseball and for other sports. First reference in city directories is 1880, last is 1882. Location: Brannan Street (northwest); 6th Street (northeast); Townsend Street (southeast); 7th Street (southwest).\nCentral Park.\n1884–1898 In the South of Market district, known under the name 'Central Park' at the southeast corner (per 1887 and 1900 city directories) of 8th and Market Streets, or 1185 Market Street (per 1905 city directory); a stadium with seating for 15,000, Daniel R. McNeil opened a professional baseball stadium on Thanksgiving Day 1884 (November 27), and was used for play of the Pacific Coast Baseball League from 1886 until June 1887. \nThis ball park on April 28, 1888 became the home of the newly formed California State League. By 1899, the park's days as a baseball venue were over, as it had been converted into a steeple chase rollercoaster and a building housing the \"Battle of Manilla\" panorama. An indoor roller skating rink was built on part of the site. It opened to the public for the first time on April 11, 1906.[San Francisco \"Examiner\", April 11, 1906, p. 11] One week later, the buildings on the property succumbed to the earthquake. \nHaight Street Grounds.\nHaight-Street Recreation Grounds. Following a league dispute at the Central Park grounds, James Fair established a new ball park in 1886 known as the Alameda Grounds on the island of Alameda (adjacent to Oakland) for play of the California League, which was moved the following year for play at a new baseball park in the Haight District. With grandstands seating 14,000 and located at the terminus of a railcar line. 1887 to March 1895. The borders of this ball park were Stanyan Street (west, first base); Waller Street (north, third base); Shrader Street (listed as \"Rader\" Street in the 1889 Sanborn map) (east, left field); and Frederic Street (to the south, beyond right field) Photo. It was built across Stanyan from the future site of the Kezar Stadium complex.\nTeams playing in this park included\nRecreation Park (III).\nMission District Recreation Park April 6, 1907 through October 19, 1930 (except for 1914). - 1930s \nSan Francisco – California State League (1915 only) – appears to have been a road-only team. The league began the season with the intention of playing only Sunday games, figuring to maximize their revenue. Heavy rains in May washed out most of those games, and the league folded at the end of the month.\nEwing Field.\nEwing Field, 1914 to 1938 (located in the Richmond District, on Masonic between Geary and Turk; the Seals played at Ewing Field for one year in 1914, but returned to the Valencia Street Recreation Park the next year following many criticisms of the cold, windy, foggy weather at Ewing Field) The ballpark continued to be used for local non-professional games. During a game on June 5, 1926, the stadium caught fire from a cigarette, and soon burned down. In the process, embers started fires across the streets and destroyed several homes. With the ballpark fire raging, the firemen concentrated their efforts on protecting the rest of the neighborhood, including the Presentation Convent behind the left field corner of the ballpark. From 1926 until 1938 the field remained unoccupied. In late October 1938, developers announced plans for constructing a new housing development to be named Ewing Terrace. "

He was known as Esmailyn Gonzalez until February 2009, when \"Sports Illustrated\" published an investigation that proved he had used fraudulent documents to convince the Nationals that he was several years younger than his true age.\nSigning.\nOn July 2, 2006, the Nationals signed 20-year-old Alvarez, then known as 16-year-old Esmailyn Gonzalez, as an international free agent. He was given a million (equivalent to $million in ) signing bonus. The Nationals were given information that Alvarez was born on September 21, 1989, a date which the MLB office confirmed for at least three interested teams, including Washington. He made his debut for the Gulf Coast League Nationals, playing in a summer rookie league (lower than the Class A minor leagues) in 2007.\nName/birth date controversy.\nSoon after the player was signed by the Nationals, team officials asked MLB to do some further checking in response to concerns about irregularities in his signing. MLB initially determined there was nothing out of the ordinary. \nHowever, on February 17, 2009, \"Sports Illustrated\" uncovered evidence that Gonzalez's real name was Carlos Alvarez Lugo, and he was born in 1985 rather than 1989. Even before then, a number of baseball insiders suspected that Gonzalez/Lugo was significantly less than advertised. One of them told \"SI\" that despite the Nationals billing him as a five-tool player, \"he doesn't run all that well, and has an average arm.\"\nIn a press conference later that day, Nationals president Stan Kasten confirmed that Gonzalez's real name was indeed Carlos Alvarez Lugo. A visibly angry Kasten said the Nationals had been victimized by \"a deliberate, premeditated fraud\" involving several people and a raft of falsified records. He added that he'd asked for a further inquiry in response to revelations that Chicago White Sox officials were skimming off the signing bonuses of Latino prospects. He vowed the Nationals would seek legal and financial recourse.\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation soon began investigating Nationals general manager Jim Bowden, suspecting that he has skimmed bonus money from international signees since 1994, when he was with the Cincinnati Reds. Bowden was subsequently forced to resign as a result of the affair, though nothing ever came of that investigation.\nWith the news of Lugo's real name and age, and his on field performance, he was far less valuable as a potential MLB player. Although he won the Gulf Coast League batting title in 2008 and compiled fairly good numbers in runs, RBIs and hits, one scout said that these numbers were to be expected considering that he was somewhat older than the other players in that summer rookie league (lower than the Class A minor leagues).\nDespite the fraud, Lugo continued to play in the Nationals minor league system through 2013. However, he never rose higher than Class A. He played for Tigres del Licey in the Dominican Professional Baseball League in 2014–15, and has not returned to baseball at any level since then."

        "text": "Roger Bowling (born May 8, 1982) is an American professional mixed martial artist currently competing in the Welterweight division. A professional competitor since 2007, Bowling competed for the UFC and Strikeforce.\nBackground.\nBowling was born and raised in the small village of Neville, Ohio, and is the oldest of three siblings. Bowling's early life was difficult as his father was a drug addict who was often in and out of jail while Bowling's mother had to work two jobs, which including driving a school bus, to support the family. Bowling was athletic playing sports such as football and baseball, but his athletic activities were limited by a lack of transportation. He attended Felicity Franklin Highschool. He was frequently suspended or expelled from highschool for picking fights and had been looking forward to leave the town. When he was 18 years old he went to live with his girlfriend and go to Grant vocational school to learn welding. Bowling has a background in amateur boxing with an undefeated 9-0 record, having competed and dominated his opponents in Toughman-like competitions. Bowling later joined a gym where he was introduced him to mixed martial arts.\nMixed martial arts career.\nEarly career.\nAfter joining the MMA gym, Bowling had his first fight against an opponent who, at 6'6”, towered over the 5'8” Bowling. Despite the huge size disadvantage, Bowling won the bout and broke his opponent's nose. Bowling competed as a Middleweight for all of his amateur fights, and held an amateur record of 3-1.\nFrom 2007 to 2009, Bowling built his career fighting for the MMA Big Show, a regional promotion known for pitting up and comers against UFC veterans to springboard talent. He earned the Welterweight Championship and carried the belt until MMA Big Show promoter and manager Jason Appleton signed Bowling to a three-year deal with Strikeforce.\nOn June 20, 2009 Bowling was set to fight the controversial former UFC Welterweight War Machine, formerly known as Jon Koppenhaver. However Bowling broke his hand a couple of weeks before the event and was not cleared to fight. The two agreed to fight later in the year. Before the rescheduled match up, Roger defeated Devon Plaisance via TKO in July 2009. Bowling was again set to fight War Machine in the main event of XFC 9 in Tampa, Florida on September 5, however, Bowling was again forced to withdraw due to injury.\nStrikeforce.\nIn October 2009, Bowling signed with Strikeforce. He was set to make his debut in November 2009, but was forced to withdraw because of an injury.\nBowling subsequently made his debut in May 2010 on the Strikeforce Challengers: Lindland vs. Casey card against Bobby Voelker. Bowling dominated the first two rounds, but was unable to stop Voelker. The fight ended controversially as it was stopped in the third round due to an unintentional eye injury. Per the rules, the fight went to the judges' scorecards and Bowling was awarded a unanimous decision win.\nBowling and Voelker had a rematch in the main event of the Strikeforce Challengers: Bowling vs. Voelker card on October 22, 2010. After controlling the action in the first round, demonstrating his speed and striking advantage, Bowling lost the fight in the second round via TKO (strikes), after being hurt by Voelker's ground and pound technique, and was given his first professional loss. Bowling and Voelker fought for a third time at Strikeforce Challengers: Voelker vs. Bowling III to create Strikeforce's first trilogy. Once again, Voelker won the fight via TKO in the second round.\nBowling next faced Jerron Peoples at on December 17, 2011. Despite Peoples weighing in nearly 10 pounds heavy, Bowling won the fight via knockout at just under a minute in the first round.\nOn March 3, 2012, Bowling faced Brandon Saling at in Columbus, Ohio and won via TKO in the second round.\nUltimate Fighting Championship.\nIn January 2013, the Strikeforce organization was closed by its parent company Zuffa. A list of fighters scheduled to be brought over to the Ultimate Fighting Championship was released in mid-January and Bowling was one of the fighters listed.\nBowling made his UFC and Lightweight debut against Anthony Njokuani on April 20, 2013 at UFC on Fox 7. He lost via second-round knockout.\nBowling faced Abel Trujillo on August 28, 2013 at UFC Fight Night 27. The fight ended in controversial fashion as Trujillo landed what appeared to be an illegal knee to the face of Bowling at the end of round two. With Bowling unable to continue, the referee deemed the bout a no contest. In a post-fight interview with Ariel Helwani, Bowling was upset as he felt he had been winning the fight until the illegal knee, and wanted a rematch with Trujillo.\nA rematch with Trujillo took place on December 14, 2013 at UFC on Fox 9. Bowling lost via TKO in the second round, and was released from the promotion shortly after the fight.\nPersonal life.\nBowling is married and has a daughter. Aside from professional fighting, he works for an engineering company that builds custom machinery."

        "title": "Baseball Think Factory",
        "text": "Baseball Think Factory, abbreviated as BTF or BBTF, was a sabermetrically-oriented baseball web site which featured daily news stories in baseball, with original content contributed by SABR members such as Dan Szymborski. The site was previously branded as \"Baseball Primer\", and was created in 2001 by the founders of Baseball-Reference. Contributors who have gone on to work for Major League Baseball front offices include Voros McCracken, Carlos Gomez, and Tom Tango. Bill James' \"Baseball Abstract\" books published in the 1980s are widely considered to be the modern predecessor to websites using sabermetrics such as \"baseballthinkfactory\" and baseballprospectus.\nBaseball Think Factory shut down on December 15, 2023. A site for “refugees” of BBTF was established at https://hallofmerit.boards.net/\nHistory.\nThe site was founded in 2001 by Jim Furtado and Sean Forman of Baseball-Reference under the name \"Baseball Primer,\" with a matching URL of (http://www.baseballprimer.com/). It lasted until Furtado shut it down December 15, 2023.\nThe site's emphasis on sabermetric baseball analysis attracted members of the rec.sport.baseball Usenet groups, and later drew readers of Rob Neyer's ESPN columns. The early site cultivated spirited discussions as a result of the Usenet veterans' familiarity with each other and the fact that registration was not required to post comments. The site also featured a number of original research articles.\nIn 2004, the site was re-branded as \"Baseball Think Factory\" and was re-built on a different software platform in order to support the growing user population and accommodate user registration and content management features.\nBTF mainly hosted baseball discussions. \"Sports Illustrated\" magazine listed the site as an \"essential baseball destination,\" characterizing it as offering \"links to significant baseball articles, accompanied by freewheeling, usually informed discussion threads.\" Michael Lewis also mentioned the site (as \"baseballprimer\") in his book Moneyball.\nSite sections.\nThe site featured a number of sections with content for different audiences. These include:\nOriginal research.\nBTF has featured numerous original research articles, primarily under the aforementioned sub-sites \"Transaction Oracle,\" \"Dialed In,\" and \"Primate Studies.\" Several analysts such as Mitchel Lichtman and Tom Tango regularly posted original research articles and participated on discussion and criticism of the work at BTF before going on to establish their own sites and to publish results in book form.\nGiven that statistics characterizing major league offense (batting) are fairly well established, much of the research posted on BTF spotlight defense (fielding) in the form of statistics more accurate than traditional fielding statistics. Examples include:\nMitchel Litchman's articles on ultimate zone rating.\nLitchman created fielding metrics that use play-by-play records that record the location of individual batted balls. Litchman combines this play-by-play data with his linear-weights system that assigns run values to the various baseball plays and their context within the game (inning, runners on base, score, etc.) Some of his initial articles on the system were posted on BTF.\nLichtman's Ultimate zone ratings (UZR) statistics can now be found on the baseball website Fangraphs.\nZiPS.\nSzymborski posts updates from his forecasting system known as \"ZiPS\" under his sub-site \"Transaction Oracle\". ZiPS results are also used in his articles evaluating Major League Baseball transactions. These projections can also be found on Fangraphs, updated for in-season projections.\nChris Dial's \"Dialed In\" columns.\nDial is a SABR member who contributes articles to BTF, many focusing on statistics measuring defense. Dial has studied STATS, Inc.'s \"zone rating\" for years and posts updated statistics based on this data and on Retrosheet data. Some of Dial's more notable articles include:\nCarlos Gomez's \"Bullpen Mechanics\".\nGomez is a former college and professional pitcher who contributed articles featuring detailed, frame-by-frame analyses of pitcher mechanics. Prior to their publication, the average fan had little access to detailed evaluations of pitchers' mechanics and had to rely on short descriptions gleaned by beat reporters from scouting reports. The Arizona Diamondbacks organization offered him a position as a scout in 2007."

The East German team declined to participate. West Germany participated instead after beating Poland in two qualifying games arranged in November 1970 for the vacant slot. West Germany had placed second in last year's Pool B, while Poland had finished 6th in last year's Pool A.\n – 6:3 (2:0, 3:2, 1:1)\n8 November 1970 – Munich\n – 4:4 (2:0, 2:0, 0:4)\n12 November 1970 – Łódź\nWorld Championship Group A (Switzerland).\nFor the ninth straight year, the Soviet Union won the world championship, although Czechoslovakia won the 49th European championship as the Czech opening loss against the Americans did not count in the European standings. Team USA was demoted to the 1972 Pool B tournament. The Americans came into their final game needing to win by five goals, and led five to zero in the third period, but the Germans scored the only goal of the frame claiming the advantage in the tie-breaker for 5th place.\n – 1:5 (1:3, 0:1, 0:1)\n19 March 1971 – Bern\nGoalscorers: Nedomanský – Riutta 2, Konik, Patrick, Boucha.\nReferees: Dahlberg (SWE), Ehrensperger (SUI)\n – 11:2 (2:2, 3:0, 6:0)\n19 March 1971 – Bern\nGoalscorers: Mišakov 3, Petrov 2, Vikulov 2, Firsov, Malcev, Zimin, Martiňuk – Alois Schloder, Philipp.\n – 2:4 (1:1, 1:1, 0:2)\n20 March 1971 – Bern\nGoalscorers: Boucha, Falkman – Wickberg 2, Sterner, Lindberg\n – 3:4 (1:2, 1:1, 1:1)\n20 March 1971 – Bern\nGoalscorers: Hanig, Kuhn, Philipp – Oksanen 2, Ketola, Isaksson.\n – 5:6 (1:2, 2:0, 2:4)\n21 March 1971 – Bern\nGoalscorers: Hlinka 3, Nedomanský, Panchártek – Lundström 2, Hammarström, Nilsson, Norlander, Sterner.\nReferees: Bader (GER), Ehrensperger (SUI)\n – 1:8 (1:1, 0:2, 0:5)\n21 March 1971 – Bern\nGoalscorers: Koskela – Malcev 2, Petrov 2, Davydov, Vikulov, Firsov, Michajlov.\n – 9:1 (1:0, 3:1, 5:0)\n22 March 1971 – Bern\nGoalscorers: B.

        "title": "1970 Ice Hockey World Championships",
        "text": "The 1970 Ice Hockey World Championships was the 37th edition of the Ice Hockey World Championships. 21 nations participated in three different divisions or pools:\nFor the eighth straight year, the Soviet Union won the world championship. Originally the tournament was scheduled to be held in Montreal and Winnipeg in Canada. However, after a dispute over allowing professional players in international tournaments, the IIHF awarded the championships to other cities. The Canadian team withdrew from competing in international hockey. They would not return to international play until 1977. This tournament was also the first one to make helmets mandatory for all skaters.\nCanadian departure from international hockey.\nCanada was scheduled to be the original host nation of Group A for the 1970 Ice Hockey World Championships, and the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) had granted use of up to nine former professional players for national teams at the event. The Canada men's national ice hockey team had not won the Ice Hockey World Championships since 1961 and had never hosted the event. Hockey Canada and the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) saw the use of professionals as the best chance to return Canada to hockey supremacy, and were committed to event including professionals. Canadian officials were frustrated that their best players, competing in the National Hockey League (NHL), were prevented from playing while Soviet players, who were \"employees\" of the industrial or military organizations that fielded \"amateur\" teams, were allowed to compete.\nInternational Olympic Committee president Avery Brundage objected to the use of professionals at the World Championships and stated that any national team which played against professionals would be ineligible for ice hockey at the 1972 Winter Olympics. The IIHF called an emergency meeting for January 1970 to discuss the situation. CAHA president Earl Dawson argued that national teams participating in Izvestia Trophy tournaments had played against professionals, but were still eligible for the Olympics and the same should apply to the World Championships. He also made the suggestion to consider the 1970 event an invitational tournament instead of a World Championships to avoid the wrath of the IOC, but the IIHF declined the notion. A vote was taken and five of the eight nations in the top division of the World Championships voted against the use of any professionals.\nCanada perceived the situation to be a double standard in international hockey since players on European national teams were believed to be state-sponsored professionals labeled as amateurs. Dawson and the CAHA took stand against what they perceived as hypocrisy by European members of the IIHF. Dawson withdrew the Canadian national team from international competitions against European hockey teams until Canada was allowed to use its best players. Hosting of the 1970 World Championships was given to Sweden. Dawson felt that Sweden and the Soviet Union combined to sabotage the Canadian attempt to host the 1970 World Championships, because Sweden wanted to host the event and the Soviets did not want to lose the gold medal.\nInstead of competing internationally at the Olympics, Canadian officials helped organize a series of games against the Soviet Union in September 1972 known as the Summit Series. These games featured a Canadian team made up exclusively of NHL professionals.\nWorld Championship Group A (Sweden).\n – 6:3 (2:1, 3:1, 1:1)\n14.

Relegation was decided based on rankings from the 2008 Olympics. Australian coach Frank Murray strongly criticised the rule, calling it \"a ridiculous qualification process\", upon discovering prior to the final that Australia would have to win the tournament to avoid relegation. He stated that the tournament's lowest-placed team bar the next hosts should instead be relegated, and noted that the rule incentivised Australia to deliberately lose to England, to help England to finish higher than sixth.\nTeams.\nThe International Hockey Federation announced the qualified teams for this event:\nUmpires.\nBelow are the 8 umpires appointed by the International Hockey Federation:\nResults.\n\"All times are Eastern Standard Time ()\""

        "title": "Wing Park Golf Course",
        "text": "Wing Park Golf Course in Elgin, Illinois, is the \"oldest and best preserved nine-hole municipal golf course in Illinois.\" The course was constructed during a golf course boom in the Chicago area during first few years of the 1900s. The course was named after William H. Wing, who donated the land for a park in 1902. When the Elgin and Belvidere Electric Company was built only a few blocks away, Elgin developed the southern portion of the property to a golf course. The course was developed by Tom Bendelow, a prolific designer who laid out over six hundred golf courses. Wing Park Golf Course opened on September 5, 1908, and has been in continuous operation since. The Wing Park Golf Club was organized in 1912 to help manage the property. The course was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009.\nHistory.\nGolf is a sport that was brought to America by Scottish immigrants in the 1890s. It was immediately recognized as a sport of the wealthy, and moguls such as William Kissam Vanderbilt built their own courses. Charles B. Macdonald was a stockbroker who learned the sport while he attended school at the University of St Andrews in Scotland. Macdonald built the first golf course, the Onwentsia Club, in the Chicago area in Lake Forest in 1892. A year later, he built the Chicago Golf Club, the nation's first 18-hole golf course. The Chicago Golf Club was a great success, and prompted the construction of several new courses; by 1900, Chicago and its suburbs boasted twenty-six courses. Golf became a sport not only for the wealthy, but also for the public. In 1895, New York City opened a course at Van Cortlandt Park, the nation's first municipal course. Chicago followed suit in 1899, opening Jackson Park Golf Club to the public.\nElgin was founded in 1830s and became an important manufacturing town after the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad reached it in 1850. The Elgin National Watch Company and Gail Borden Condensed Milk factories dramatically increased the local population by providing jobs. Decreasing work hours at the turn of the century resulted in more recreational time for employees. The first golf course in Elgin was the nine-hole Elgin Country Club in 1901, a private course designed by Tom Bendelow west of the city. Bendelow designed over 600 golf courses in his career. He was a strong advocate for public golf courses, and taught course design at the college level.\nWing Park was named for William H. Wing, a descendent of the Wing family who moved to Elgin in 1846. Wing was a successful attorney and donated of this estate to Elgin for use as a public park in 1902. The park officially opened to the public on August 2, 1903, and was split between land that had been used for farming and land that was covered in native woods. The park remained relatively undeveloped until 1907, when the Elgin and Belvidere Electric Company extended to State Street, four blocks east of the park. Among this plan was the construction of the Wing Park Golf Course. Elgin hired Bendelow, who staked the Wing Park course in only one day, and the course was built in two months at a cost of $1,250. The course was simple, but was primarily intended to be playable to beginning golfers. The course featured parallel fairways, small greens, and incorporated the natural terrain into the course design. When Wing Park Golf Course opened on September 5, 1908, Elgin became the smallest city in the country with a public golf course.\nThe Wing Park Golf Club was established on September 14, 1912, with 88 charter members. They purchased the property across from the course entrance and built a club house the next year. The club house was an American Craftsman bungalow with a veranda facing the course. The club sold an additional 200 memberships for $25 each. By 1921, Wing Park was so successful that Elgin had to ban non-residents from playing the course on weekends. Non-residents still flocked to the field, prompting Elgin in the mid-1920s to impose a fifty cent fee to residents and a dollar fee for non-residents to further increase availability to residents. In 1926, plans were made to buy and adjacent property and convert Wing Park to an 18-hole course, but these were halted by the Great Depression. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 18, 2009. The property was the Highlighted Property of the Week when the National Park Service released its weekly list of February 27, 2009. Today, it is the second-oldest extant golf course in Illinois (next to Jackson Park), and the oldest to retain its original conformation.\nAll holes were named in the early days of the golf course."

        "text": "The overall quota for the figure skating competition is 148 total skaters, consisting of 74 men and 74 ladies. There will be 30 skaters in each of the single skating disciplines (men's and ladies'), 20 pair skating teams, and 24 ice dance teams. The maximum number of entries that can be qualified by a National Olympic Committee is 3 per event, making 18 (9 men, 9 ladies) the maximum number of entries that a country can qualify.\nQualification system.\nSkater eligibility.\nSkaters must be older than fifteen as of July 1, 2009 and must be a citizen of the country they represent to be eligible for the Olympic Games. Unlike qualification rules for International Skating Union events, in the case of a pair or ice dance team, both skaters must be citizens of the country they represent in competition. In addition, International Olympic Committee rules require that at least three years have passed since the competitor last represented another country in competition.\nSkater qualification.\nThere is no individual athlete qualification to the Olympics; the choice of which athlete(s) to send to the Games is at the discretion of each country's National Olympic Committee.\nCountry qualification.\nThe number of entries for the figure skating events at the Olympic Games is limited by a quota set by the International Olympic Committee. There will be 30 skaters in the disciplines of men's and ladies' singles, 20 pair skating teams, and 24 ice dance teams.\nCountries may qualify entries to the 2010 Winter Olympics in two ways. The host country was entitled to one entry per discipline if it failed to qualify.\nThe majority of the country qualification occurred at the 2009 World Figure Skating Championships. At the World Championships, countries qualified up to three entries in each discipline. The number of multiple entries is the same as usual for the World Championships and countries who earn multiple spots to the Olympics also earned multiple spots to the 2010 World Figure Skating Championships.\nEvery discipline qualifies separately.\nThe multiple spots qualification to the Olympics from the World Championships is as follows:\nThe results of the 2009 World Championships determined 83 total spots: 24 entries in each singles discipline, 16 in pairs, and 19 in ice dance. The available spots were awarded going down the results list, with the multiple spots being awarded first.\nThe remainder of the spots were filled at the 2009 Nebelhorn Trophy, held between September 23 and September 26, 2009. Countries which had already earned an entry to the Olympics were not allowed to qualify more entries at this final qualifying competition. Unlike at the World Championships, where countries could qualify more than one spot depending on the placement of the skater, at the Nebelhorn Trophy, countries who qualified were allotted only one spot to the Olympics, regardless of placement.\nIf a country declined to use one or more of its qualified spots, the vacated spot was awarded using the results of the Nebelhorn Trophy in descending order of placement."

The game was played at the Cardiff Arms Park, and the travelling Irish team turned up for the match two players short, with accounts at the time crediting Wales players Purdon and Jordan being drafted in to complete the team. Under the captaincy of Joe Simpson, Wales won the game by a dropped goal and two tries to nil.

        "title": "Florida Gators men's golf",
        "text": "The Florida Gators men's golf team represents the University of Florida in the sport of golf. The Gators compete in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Southeastern Conference (SEC). They play their home matches on the Mark Bostick Golf Course on the university's Gainesville, Florida campus, and are currently led by head coach J. C. Deacon. In the eighty-nine-year history of the Gators' men's golf program, they have won fifteen SEC championships and five NCAA national tournament championships. They are the current defending national champions.\nHistory.\nThe Gators men's golf program was the fifth intercollegiate sports team established by the University of Florida, having begun competition in 1925. The Gators won their first two Southeastern Conference team championships twenty years later under coach Andrew Bracken in 1955 and coach Conrad Rehling in 1956. Those two SEC championship teams produced future PGA Tour members Doug Sanders, Tommy Aaron and Dave Ragan. Rehling's Gators also produced three back-to-back individual SEC titles: Ragan (1956) and Aaron (1957, 1958).\nBishop era: 1964–78.\nPhysical education professor and former high school football coach Buster Bishop became the new head coach of the Gators golf team in 1964. Improvement came quickly for Bishop's Gators, and they finished as the SEC runners-up in 1965. Gator Bob Murphy won the individual NCAA national title in 1966. And in 1967, the team finished second in the conference behind the LSU Tigers, and second in the nation behind the Houston Cougars at the NCAA championship tournament.\nThe 1968 Gators made history; they not only won the program's third SEC team championship, they won the NCAA championship tournament by edging the defending national champion Houston Cougars by two shots. The Gators' 1968 NCAA men's golf championship, won by John Darr, Steve Melnyk, John Sale, Richard Spears, Robert Baggs and Wendell Coffee, was the first national team championship in any sport ever won by a team from the University of Florida.\nBishop's Gators won another NCAA national team championship 1973, with an all-star team of four future PGA Tour members: Gary Koch, Andy Bean, Ben Duncan, Woody Blackburn and Phil Hancock. The 1973 Gators outpaced the second-place Oklahoma State Cowboys by ten strokes in the NCAA championship tournament. The following year, the Gators finished second by two strokes behind the Wake Forest Demon Deacons at the 1974 NCAA championship tournament.\nBishop's teams also won three back-to-back SEC team championships in 1973, 1974 and 1975. Only once in fifteen seasons did his Gators finish worse than third in the ten-team SEC. Bishop retired from coaching after the 1978 season.\nDarr and Blevins: 1979–87.\nJohn Darr, a junior letterman from the Gators' 1968 national championship team, followed Bishop as the team's coach in 1979 and 1980. In his two seasons, Darr's Gators finished second and third in the SEC, and fifteenth and tenth nationally at the NCAA championship tournament. Gator golfer Rick Pearson won the individual SEC title in 1980. Lynn Blevins served as the Gators' coach from 1981 to 1987; his teams won an SEC team championship in 1985, and were the SEC runners-up in 1986. Blevins' Gators finished third in the nation at the 1985 NCAA championship tournament, which they hosted on their home course.\nAlexander era: 1988–2014.\nBuddy Alexander was hired for the 1988 season. Alexander's 1993 team of Guy Hill, Chris Couch, Brian Gay, Bread Lehman and John Pettit won another national championship, besting second-place Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets by a single shot at the NCAA championship tournament. His 2001 team won the program's fourth NCAA national championship, with Gators Nick Gilliam, Camilo Benedetti, Bubba Dickerson, Camilo Villegas and Ben Banks dominating the runner-up Clemson Tigers by eighteen strokes. Team captain Gilliam also won the second individual NCAA men's golf championship in Gators history in 2001, and teammate Benedetti finished second in the NCAA championship tournament, three strokes behind Gilliam.\nAlexander's Gators won eight SEC team championships (1989, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1999, 2003, 2011), and finished second in the conference seven times. Nationally, his teams won two NCAA national championships (1993, 2001), and finished second twice (1990, 2006). The Gators failed to qualify for the NCAA championship tournament only twice in his twenty-six seasons.\nIndividual honors.\nIn the past fifty-eight years, fifteen Gators golfers have won twenty-one SEC individual titles. Thirty-nine Gators golfers have earned sixty-seven first-team All-SEC honors. Forty-nine Gators have received ninety-three All-American honors. Three Gators have won the individual NCAA national title: Bob Murphy (1966), Nick Gilliam (2001), and Fred Biondi (2023).\nFour Gators have won U.S. Amateur Championship: Bob Murphy (1965), Steve Melnyk (1969), Fred Ridley (1975), and Bubba Dickerson (2001). The Gators' former head coach, Buddy Alexander, won the U.S. Amateur in 1986.

        "text": "The 1969 Ice Hockey World Championships was the 36th edition of the Ice Hockey World Championships, which also doubled as the 47th European ice hockey championships. For the first time the Pool A, B and C tournaments were hosted by different nations:\nA total of 20 nations participated in the tournament. The Pool A team featured only the top six nations, now playing a double round-robin tournament for the amateur world championship. Teams #7-#14 contested the Pool B championship with the winner qualifying for the 1970 Pool A championship, while the bottom six participated in the Pool C tournament. Pool B and C began exchanging two teams this year (through promotion and relegation), a practice that lasted until 1987.\nWorld Championship Group A (Sweden).\nFor the seventh straight year, the Soviet Union won the Pool A tournament. Originally the tournament was scheduled to be held in Czechoslovakia, but due to the Soviet invasion of the country, they declined to host. In the two games the Czechoslovak and Soviet teams played against each other, the Czechoslovak team won both times, becoming the first team to beat the Soviet Union twice in the same international tournament. For the first time in international ice hockey, body-checking was allowed in all three zones of the ice. Team USA was demoted to Pool-B after losing all ten games.\n – 6:1 (1:0, 2:1, 3:0)\n15.

        "text": "The 1967 Ice Hockey World Championships was the 34th edition of the Ice Hockey World Championships. The tournament was held in Vienna, Austria from March 18 to March 29, 1967. The Soviet Union won the tournament for the fifth straight year, Sweden won the silver medal, and Canada claimed the bronze medal.\nHost selection.\nBids to host the event were received from the Austrian Ice Hockey Association and the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) in March 1965. The International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) voted to host the event in Austria. Canada had bid hoping to combine the event with the Canadian Centennial. CAHA second vice-president Lloyd Pollock reacted by saying, \"possibly we should consider now whether or not its worth\" going to future championships, in a comment that foreshadowed Canada's eventual withdrawal from the world championships in 1970.\nSummary.\nFor the fifth straight year, the Soviet Union won the tournament. They won all their games claiming their seventh World championship, and eleventh European. The competition for the other medals was very close, with Sweden, Canada, and Czechoslovakia all being in contention until the end. Sweden defeated Canada on the final day to clinch a medal and claimed Silver when the Czechs lost to the Soviets in the final game. Canada claimed Bronze, losing out to Sweden on the head-to-head tie-breaker. The East Germans handily defeated the West this year, which was believed to have settled who would be relegated. However, starting in 1969, the top tier shrank to only six nations meaning that both German entries ended up being relegated. The tournament also featured an historic first, when Finland defeated Czechoslovakia.\nIn Group 'B' the championship was settled on the final day. With one game to play, both Romania and Poland had ten points, both had a goal differential of +14, and they had tied each other, so whoever won their final game by a wider margin would claim tournament victory. The Romanians defeated Yugoslavia five to three, and then had to watch as the Poles defeated Austria seven to two. The Polish team were quite fortunate that Romania had blown a lead on the second last day against Austria, but were very unfortunate that the change in the top tier format allowed for no promotion from Group 'B' Oddly, the leading scorer (Zoltán Horváth) came from the last placed team, Hungary. Japan won all four of their games by wide margins to claim Group 'C' but had to wait (like Poland) until 1969 for another chance to move up.\nWorld Championship Group A (Austria).\nFinal Round.\n\"Both East and West Germany were relegated as the top tier shrank to six nations for 1969.\"\nWorld Championship Group B (Austria).\nFinal Round.\n\"Both Switzerland and Hungary were relegated to the 'C' pool for 1969, additionally they missed qualifying for the 1968 Olympics. No one was promoted.\"\nWorld Championship Group C (Austria).\nFinal Round.\n\"With the top level shrinking, no one was promoted but Japan earned a trip to the Grenoble Olympics. Belgium, Great Britain, and North Korea were expected to play in this tournament, but did not participate.\"\nRanking and statistics.\nFinal standings.\nThe final standings of the tournament according to IIHF:\nEuropean championships final standings.\nThe final standings of the European championships according to IIHF:"

The tournament was held in Hala Tivoli, Ljubljana, SR Slovenia, SFR Yugoslavia from 3 to 14 March 1966. For the fourth straight year, the Soviet Union won the tournament. For the Soviets, it was their sixth World and tenth European title. Czechoslovakia beat both Canada and Sweden two to one, to take the Silver, while the Swedes' historic loss to East Germany helped put them fourth behind Canada for the Bronze.\nThe lower two tiers (Groups B and C) were formalized, so there would be no more qualifying tournaments with promotion and relegation taking places between these two tournaments as well. West Germany won all their games to return to the top level of competition while Great Britain went winless and was replaced by Group C winner Italy.\nQualifying round Group B/C (Bucharest Romania).\nRomania qualified in Group B\nItaly and France qualified in Group C\nWorld Championship Group A (Ljubljana).\nThe Canadian national team players wanted to withdraw from the World Championships in protest of the officiating in a loss to the Czechoslovakian national team in which Canada was the more-penalized team and had two goals disallowed. The team's manager Father David Bauer stayed up all night with the team and talked them into continuing to avoid a national embarrassment and sanctions against the team.\nFinal round.\n\"Poland was relegated to Group B for 1967.\"\nWorld Championship Group B (Zagreb).\nFinal round.\n\"West Germany was promoted to the top level while Great Britain was relegated to Group C for 1967 (but did not participate again until 1971).\"\nWorld Championship Group C (Jesenice).\nA Yugoslav 'B' team participated unofficially in the tournament, playing games against each of the three other participating nations.

        "text": "The 1963 Ice Hockey World Championships was the 30th edition of the Ice Hockey World Championships. The tournament was held in Stockholm, Sweden from March 7 to March 17, 1963. The Soviet Union won the tournament for the third time, starting their roll of nine straight championships. For the Soviets it was also their seventh European title. \nA new tie-breaking method was introduced and was effective for this World Championship only: Any tie on points for a medal place would be decided according to goal differential involving only the top five placed nations. If a tie for a medal place continued among only two teams, the second step was to award the superior medal to the winner of the game played between the two. The purpose of the change was to lessen the incentive for top teams to run up the score on weaker teams. This formula was immediately called upon to decide the medals and greatly magnified the drama on the final day, as the Soviets won the gold by a one-goal margin (+8 to +7), rather than a seven-goal margin (+41 to +34) under the previous system. \nHeading into the last day, the Swedes were two points ahead of the Soviets, having defeated them 2-1; Sweden was +8 on the first tiebreaker while the Soviets were +6. The first game of the day was East Germany vs U.S.A., seemingly a game of small significance—but an American win would propel them into fifth place, displacing Finland, and would give Sweden +19 on the first tiebreaker (due to Sweden's 17-2 win over the Americans) while the Soviets would have +10. An American shot hit the East German crossbar with three seconds left in the game, and it ended 3-3. The four-way tie for fifth place was resolved according to goal difference among all teams in the group. Sweden's edge on the first tiebreaker remained +8 to +6. \nNext up was Sweden vs. Czechoslovakia. The Swedes needed a single point to clinch the gold, but Czechoslovakia won 3-2 to clinch the bronze. The last game of the tournament between the Soviet Union and Canada would then decide gold and silver, with the loser of the game placing fourth. Sweden's tiebreaker edge over the Soviets was now +7 to +6. The Soviets needed to win by more than one goal to take the gold. A one-goal margin would clinch the gold for Sweden, winners of the head-to-head game. Canada needed a win to take the silver. In the end, everything went the Soviets' way on the final day, as they prevailed 4-2 on Sweden's home ice.\nA record twenty-one nations participated, at three levels, with most nations returning to the group where they played in 1961. This meant that the unfortunate Norwegians, despite defeating and placing higher than West Germany in 1962, returned to the 'B' pool. Even in the neutral site of Sweden, there was still a political incident. Unlike in 1961, the two German nations ended up playing their game against each other, with the West winning. Following the game when the winners flag was raised, the East Germans refused to acknowledge it, and were suspended for three months following their final game.\nThe North American entries were historically poor. The Trail Smoke Eaters, representing Canada, finished out of the medals for the first time. It would be the last time that an Allan Cup champion would be selected to represent Canada. The Americans lost to everyone except the two German teams, finishing last.\nRanking and statistics.\nFinal standings.\nThe final standings of the tournament according to IIHF:\nEuropean championships final standings.\nThe final standings of the European championships according to IIHF:"

The tournament was held in Colorado Springs and Denver, United States from March 8 to March 18, 1962. This was the first World Championship hosted in North America that was not part of ice hockey at the Olympic Games. It also remains the only IIHF World Championship (not also part of the Olympics) ever held in the United States.\nThe World Championships were in jeopardy of being cancelled to the political situation in Europe and the Berlin Wall. Sweden won their third World, and their ninth European title. Canada, represented by the Galt Terriers, lost only to the Swedes finishing second, followed by the host Americans. In the 'B' pool the Australian team defeated Denmark for their first victory ever.\nPolitical issues.\nThe World Championships were scheduled to be hosted in Colorado Springs, Colorado, but the event was placed in jeopardy due to the political situation in Europe. When the Berlin Wall was constructed in 1961 by East Germany to prevent its citizens from fleeing to the West, NATO responded with travel restrictions which prevented the East Germany national ice hockey team from attending the World Championships. Canadian Amateur Hockey Association president Jack Roxburgh felt that politics should not affect sports, and the decision went against the goodwill and relations established by teams traveling behind the Iron Curtain. He called for the International Ice Hockey Federation to unite in opposition to the NATO decision.

Keflavík and Njarðvík were neighbouring towns but were merged in 1994 and formed Reykjanesbær. Their arenas are within one kilometre of each other. In the 2008–09 season the rivalry was intensified as the men's teams were coached by brothers, Sigurður Ingimundarson with Keflavík and Valur Ingimundarson with Njarðvík. At the end of that season Sigurður left his post as the team's coach and moved to a club in Sweden. He was replaced by former player Guðjón Skúlason.

        "title": "Florida Gators women's lacrosse",
        "text": "The Florida Gators women's lacrosse team represents the University of Florida in the sport of college lacrosse. The Gators compete in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) and are single-sport members of the American Athletic Conference (The American), which they joined in 2018 after four seasons in the Big East Conference. After the 2024 season, the Gators will leave The American to join the new women's lacrosse league of the Big 12 Conference. Before joining Big East women's lacrosse, the Gators were members of the American Lacrosse Conference (ALC), which folded after the 2014 season due to aftereffects of conference realignment. They play their home games in Donald R. Dizney Stadium on the university's Gainesville, Florida campus, and are currently led by head coach Amanda O'Leary. The Gators have won regular-season conference titles in 11 of the 13 completed seasons of the women's lacrosse program's existence, with four each in the ALC and Big East plus three in The American. Additionally, they have won 10 conference tournament titles (two ALC, four Big East, four American) and advanced to the quarterfinals of the NCAA tournament six times (2011–2014, 2018, and 2021), with their best NCAA finish being a semifinal berth in 2012.\nBackground and overview.\nThe University Athletic Association (UAA) quickly proceeded from new idea to reality in the creation of its newest sports program—it decided to create a women's lacrosse program in 2005, publicly announced the new program in 2006, hired a head coach and joined a conference in 2007, and announced its first recruiting class and began construction of a dedicated lacrosse stadium in 2008. UAA officials selected women's lacrosse for its newest expansion sport because of the booming popularity of lacrosse at the high school level and the rapidly increasing competition available among Division I athletic programs.\nAlthough the University of Florida is a long-time member of the Southeastern Conference (SEC) for the other 20 NCAA sports in which it fields varsity teams, the Florida Gators women's lacrosse team competed in the American Lacrosse Conference from 2011 through 2014. Among the other 13 SEC member schools, only Vanderbilt University currently sponsors a varsity women's lacrosse team. Following the dissolution of the ALC after the 2014 season, Florida and Vanderbilt joined the Big East Conference, as associate members in women's lacrosse only, starting with the 2015 season. In October 2017, The American announced that it would start a women's lacrosse league in the 2019 season, with Florida and Vanderbilt joining four full conference members.\nThe first Gators recruiting class of 24 players included seven US Lacrosse first-team high school All-Americans—Caroline Chesterman, Katie Ciaci, Brittany Dashiell, Samantha Farrell, Janine Hiller, Jamie Reeg and Julie Schindel, and US Lacrosse named another five as All-American Honorable Mentions—Ashley Bruns, Lelan Bailey, Jenna Hildebrand, Hayley Katzenberger and Mikey Meagher. Dashiell, Bruns and Farrell, plus Kitty Cullen, Colby Rhea and Haydon Judge, were also named Under Armour All-Americans. Amanda Wedekind was previously named an Under Armour All-American as a rising sophomore in 2006. The Gators' 2009–2010 recruiting class was rated best in the nation.\nTeam history.\nThe inaugural Florida Gators team played teams from fellow ALC member schools Johns Hopkins, Ohio State, Penn State, Vanderbilt and defending NCAA champion Northwestern, as well as non-conference opponents Cornell, Georgetown, Navy and New Hampshire during the spring 2010 semester. The Gators played their first regular season game on February 20, 2010, posting a 16–6 victory over the Jacksonville Dolphins. The young Gators finished their inaugural season 10–8, including ALC wins over Penn State and Johns Hopkins, and were ranked eighteenth in the country in LaxPower's final power ratings.\nIn only their second season of NCAA competition, the sixth-ranked Gators clinched their first ALC regular season championship by defeating the defending conference champion and second-ranked Northwestern Wildcats 13–11 on April 14, 2011. The Gators completed a perfect 5–0 ALC season three days later when they defeated the seventeenth-ranked Vanderbilt Commodores 8–7. The Northwestern Wildcats edged the Gators 10–9 in the ALC Tournament final, after the Gators defeated the Ohio State Buckeyes 16–13 in the semifinal round. The Gators received their first NCAA Tournament bid, seeded fourth in the sixteen-team field on May 9, 2011, and defeated the Stanford Cardinal women's team 13–11 in the first round of the NCAA tournament five days later. The young Gators eventually fell to the veteran Duke Blue Devils 13–9 in the quarterfinals (\"Elite Eight\") of the 2011 NCAA Tournament, finishing their second season with an overall win–loss record of 16–4.\nIn advance of the spring 2012 season, \"Lacrosse Magazine\" ranked the Gators as the preseason No. 2 team in the nation. After defeating the No. 1 ranked Northwestern Wildcats, the No. 5 Gators finished the 2012 regular season with a 15–2 overall win–loss record and a perfect 5–0 in the ALC, winning their second regular season conference championship in only their third year of play. The No. 3 Gators made it a clean sweep by trouncing the No. 1 Wildcats 14–7 in the final of the ALC Tournament, and winning their first-ever conference tournament title. Afterward, the Gators were selected as the No. 1 seed in the 2012 NCAA Division I women's lacrosse tournament. The Gators defeated the Albany Great Danes 6–4 in the opening round of the tournament, and overwhelmed the Penn State Nittany Lions 15–2 in the quarterfinals. After leading 12–5 in the tournament semifinal, the team's season ended with a 14–13 sudden-death loss to the Syracuse Orange in double-overtime.\nCoaching staff.\nFlorida named Amanda O'Leary as its inaugural head coach on June 22, 2007. Before she became Florida's first head coach, O'Leary served as the head coach at Yale University for fourteen seasons, and was previously an assistant coach at the University of Maryland and the University of Delaware. As a collegiate player, O'Leary was honored as a two-time All-American midfielder at Temple University, where she led her Temple Owls team to an NCAA Championship in 1988.\nAssistant coach Erica LaGrow is a fourth-year Gators assistant. She was a first-team All-Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) midfielder for the North Carolina Tar Heels, and graduated from the University of North Carolina in 2008. LaGrow currently plays for the U.S. Women's Elite Lacrosse team, and was a key player on the U.S. national team that defeated Australia in the gold medal game of the 2009 Federation of International Lacrosse (FIL) Women's World Cup.\nAssistant coach Caitlyn McFadden is a second-year Gators assistant. She played for the Maryland Terrapins, and graduated from the University of Maryland in 2010 after leading the Terps to the 2010 NCAA Championship. McFadden was an IWLCA first-team All-American midfielder in her junior and senior seasons. As a senior, she was the recipient of the Tewaarton Award and Honda Sports Award, and was named the ACC Player of the Year, the NCAA Tournament Most Valuable Player, and the IWLCA National Midfielder of the Year. The Maryland Terrapins sports program honored her with its Suzanne Tyler Award, given to the University of Maryland female athlete of the year.\nDonald R. Dizney Stadium.\nCompleted during the summer of 2009, Donald R. Dizney Stadium hosts the Gators women's lacrosse team. The facility includes a 1,500-seat stadium that runs the length of the game field. The $15 million construction cost was funded entirely by private donors. The facility also includes a second practice field, concessions stands, locker rooms, a training room, and other amenities. At the Gators' first home game, an overflow crowd of 2,214 was present in Dizney Stadium for the Gators' 16–6 win over the Jacksonville Dolphins."

This is because of the short individual time trial and three perfectly flat stages in the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium (along with another in Spain in the race's first week), and eight of the final fourteen stages being mountain stages, with four mountaintop finishes.\nThe race was won by Spain's Alejandro Valverde who claimed his first grand tour victory.\nTeams.\n29 teams sought places in the race, of which 21 were initially invited to compete. , one of two UCI ProTour teams omitted from the list of invited teams, appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport and were subsequently granted the right to enter. are thus the only ProTour team absent from the race.\nStages.\n\"For details see 2009 Vuelta a España, Stage 1 to Stage 11 and 2009 Vuelta a España, Stage 12 to Stage 21.\"\nClassification leadership.\nIn the 2009 Vuelta a España, four different jerseys are awarded. For the general classification, calculated by adding the finishing times of the stages per cyclist after deduction of time bonuses for high placings in stage finishes and at intermediate sprints, the leader receives a golden jersey. This classification is considered the most important of the Vuelta a España, and the winner of the general classification is considered the winner of the Vuelta.\nAdditionally, there is also a points classification, which awards a green jersey. In the points classification, cyclists receive points for finishing in the top 15 in a stage. The winner gets 25 points, second place 20, third 16, fourth 14, fifth 12, sixth 10, and one point per place less down the line, to a single point for fifteenth. In addition, some points can be won in intermediate sprints.\nThere is also a mountains classification, which awards a red jersey. In the mountains classifications, points were won by reaching the top of a mountain before other cyclists. Each climb is categorized, with most of the climbs being either first, second, third, or fourth category. There are also three \"special category\" climbs (equivalent to hors catégorie in the Tour de France); these are the stage finishes on the Alto de Aitana, the Alto de Sierra Nevada, and the Sierra de La Pandera. These climbs award even more points than a first-category climb.\nFinally, there is the combination classification. This is calculated by adding the rankings in the general, points and mountains classifications; the cyclist with the lowest combined ranking is the leader in the combination classification, and receives a white jersey.\nThere is also a classification for teams. In this classification, the times of the best three cyclists per stage are added, and the team with the lowest time is the leader.\nIf a cyclist leads two or more competitions at the end of a stage, he receives all those jerseys. In the next stage, he can only wear one jersey, and he wears the jersey representing leadership in the most important competition (golden first, then green, then granate, then white). The other jerseys that the cyclists owns are worn in the next stage by the second-place (or, if needed, third or fourth-place) rider in that classification.\nFinal standings.\nAfter stage 21\nWorld Rankings points.\nThe Vuelta was the penultimate event in the 2009 UCI World Ranking. The rankings leader, Alberto Contador, did not compete in the event, but five of the top ten did, including the race winner, Valverde, who earned enough points to ensure that the title was not yet decided. Valverde, however, remained banned from riding in Italy, and so did not take part in the final ranking event, the 2009 Giro di Lombardia."

        "text": "The 1931 World Snooker Championship was a snooker tournament held at the Lounge Hall in Nottingham, England from 27 April to 1 May 1931. Despite increasing interest in the game of snooker, only two players entered the competition for the title: defending champion Joe Davis and three-times runner-up Tom Dennis. It was the fifth time that the World Snooker Championship had been contested since its inception in 1927. Davis won his fifth World title by defeating Dennis 25–21. Dennis led 19–16 at one stage but Davis won 9 of the next 11 to take the title. The highest of the match was 72, compiled by Davis in the 41st frame.\nBackground.\nThe World Snooker Championship is a professional tournament and the official world championship of the game of snooker. The sport was developed in the late 19th century by British Army soldiers stationed in India. Professional English billiards player and billiard hall manager Joe Davis noticed the increasing popularity of snooker compared to billiards in the 1920s, and with Birmingham-based billiards equipment manager Bill Camkin, persuaded the Billiards Association and Control Council to recognise an official professional snooker championship in the 1926–27 season. In 1927, the final of the first snooker world championship was held at Camkin's Hall; Davis won the tournament by beating Tom Dennis in the final. Davis also won the title in 1928, 1929, and 1930, with Dennis runner-up in three of the first four years of the championship, the exception being 1928, when Fred Lawrence lost to Davis in the final.\nChampionship details.\nThe closing date for entries for the championship was 28 February 1931. Only two players entered, Joe Davis and Tom Dennis and so only one match was necessary, with the players left to decide the date and venue for a contest over 49 . The match was played from 27 April to 1 May. There were ten frames played each day with five frames in the afternoon and five in the evening (four on the final day). The match was held at The Lounge Billiard Hall, Shakespeare Street, Nottingham, which was owned by Dennis.\nDennis led 3–2 after the first afternoon session and increased his lead to 6–4 at the end of the first day. On the second day, Davis won each of the afternoon and evening sessions 3–2 to level the match at 10–10. Dennis won the third afternoon session 4–1. In frame 24, Davis made a of 41, the first break over 40 of the match, but lost the frame 57–49. At one stage in the frame Dennis was behind the \"but jumped the cue ball clean over that obstacle\" to make his escape, according to a report in the \"Nottingham Evening Post\". In the 25th frame Davis made a 56 break before a when preparing to pot the , missing his chance of beating his Championship record break of 79. Davis then won the evening session 4–1 to level the match again at 15–15.\nOn the fourth day Dennis again won the afternoon session 4–1 but Davis won all five frames in the evening to take a 21–19 lead. On the final day Davis won the first frame which included a 48 break and then the second frame with a 72 break, the highest of the match, missing an attempted into the middle . The afternoon session ended with Davis leading 24–21, needing just one more frame for victory. Davis took the first frame of the evening by a score 75–43, including a 58 break, to win the Championship 25–21. Davis was awarded with the \"Championship Cup\" by Tinsley Lindley, who also presented Dennis with the runner-up medal. Davis and Dennis played a further four frames for the benefit of the spectators.\nOf the finals that Davis and Dennis contested, this was the closest match. Snooker historian Clive Everton has considered whether Davis may have allowed Dennis to win some frames in order to prolong the match and therefore increase the gate receipts, and concluded that it seems more likely that Dennis was playing better than Davis had expected. Everton wrote that when Davis was 16–19 behind, \"it was entirely credible, though, that Joe should react to danger by raising his game and imposing his more positive personality when he needed to.\" Davis's brother Fred Davis, was a spectator at the match. Discussing his brother's early years of domination of the World Snooker Championship, Fred Davis wrote that \"it was in nobody's financial interest for the match to be decided early\" and that this is probably why there were few one-sided matches. Fred Davis also opined that as Joe Davis's ability was so far ahead of other players, \"as soon as [Joe] started to apply himself fully, there could be only one winner.\""

        "text": "The junior varsity basketball team at the University of North Carolina is a two-year program that gives non-scholarship students the opportunity to continue their basketball careers at the collegiate level. Tryouts for the J.V. team occur every year prior to the beginning of basketball season in October. Players are only allowed to play on the J.V. team for two years and then they are given a chance to try out for the varsity team as a walk-on. With a valid physical examination, any student that attends the university can try out for the J.V. team. The J.V. team is coached by assistant varsity coaches, who are given the opportunity to gain head coaching experience while fulfilling their assistant duties at the varsity level. Hubert Davis, prior to his promotion to head coach for the varsity team, was the head coach of the J.V. team. Since the COVID-19 pandemic shut down sports in spring 2020, the J.V. team has not competed, putting a pause on one of the most cherished traditions in Chapel Hill. The team did not return for the 2021–22 season, and instead tryouts were held to add walk-ons to the varsity team, due to the continued need for COVID-19 safety protocols.\nHistory of the program.\nThe J.V. team originated as a freshman team when scholarship freshmen were not allowed to play their first year as a student per NCAA rules. Following the 1972 NCAA rule change that made freshmen eligible for varsity action, the University of North Carolina kept its junior varsity team in place while most other schools across the nation disbanded their freshman teams.\nCompetition.\nThe J.V. team plays all of its games in the Dean Smith Center three hours before the varsity games take place. The schedule consists of between 14 and 18 regular season games. The J.V. team plays against area Division II and Division III teams as well as junior colleges, prep schools, and community colleges. No other men's basketball programs in the Atlantic Coast Conference field a J.V. team. The biggest rivals for the J.V. team are Hargrave Military Academy and Milligan College. The game is played per NCAA rules, but there is no NCAA Tournament or National Invitational Tournament for the J.V. team.\nNotable coaches and alumni.\nRoy Williams, the former head coach of the men's varsity basketball team at the University of North Carolina, coached the J.V. team for eight years while serving as an assistant for Dean Smith. Jerod Haase, the current head coach for the Stanford Cardinal men's basketball team, coached the J.V. team for three years while serving as an assistant to Williams. Current Tar Heel varsity head coach Hubert Davis also had a stint as head coach of the J.V. team while an assistant on Williams' bench. Phil Ford, the second-leading scorer in North Carolina history, also served as a coach for the J.V. team. The former head coach of the North Carolina Tar Heels baseball team, Mike Fox, played for the J.V. team in 1975 and 1976. Former Tar Heel assistant Doug Wojcik also served a stint as the J.V. coach. Three of the walk-ons for the 2008–09 national championship team, J. B. Tanner, Jack Wooten, and Patrick Moody (younger brother of Christian Moody), were graduates of the J.V. program."

Europe has 5.5 qualifying berths (including the hosts), Asia 3 berths, North and Central America 2.5 berths, Africa 2 berths, South America 2 berths and Oceania 1 berth. The 16th spot was determined through a play-off match between the third-placed team in North/Central America and the winner of repechage play-offs in Europe.\nAfrica.\n\"(24 teams competing for 2 berths)\"\nAs in the previous World Cup cycle the African Women's Championship will serve as the qualification tournament for the Women's World Cup. The tournament was scheduled to be held from 31 October to 14 November 2010 in South Africa. The two finalists will advance to the Women's World Cup finals in Germany.\nEight teams will compete in the continental finals in South Africa, with qualification consisting of two rounds of knock-out home and away ties. The preliminary round was held in March 2010, with winners advancing to the first round of qualification, which was held in May and June 2010.\nThe seven winners from this round, along with hosts South Africa, advanced to the continental finals. These finals will consist of two round-robin groups of four teams. The top two finishers in each group will advance to the two semi-finals, with each semi-final winner qualifying for the World Cup finals.\nFinal tournament.\nKnockout stage\nAsia.\n\"(17 teams competing for 3 berths)\"\nAs in the previous World Cup cycle, the 2010 AFC Women's Asian Cup served as a qualifying tournament.\nThe five leading AFC nations, North Korea (the defending AFC women's champions), South Korea, Japan, China and Australia were automatic qualifiers for the finals (held from 19–30 May 2010). They were joined by the winners of each of three qualification groups held in July 2009. A preliminary round of qualification held in April and May 2009 began the qualifiers for the 2011 finals.\nThe final tournament was held in Chengdu, China. The two finalists – Australia and North Korea – and the winner of the third place play-off – Japan – qualified for the Women's World Cup finals.

        "title": "2010 Daytona 500",
        "text": "The 2010 Daytona 500 was the first stock car race of the 2010 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. The 52nd Daytona 500, it was held on February 14, 2010, in Daytona Beach, Florida, at Daytona International Speedway, before a crowd of about 175,000 attendees. Earnhardt Ganassi Racing's Jamie McMurray won the 208-lap race from 13th place. Dale Earnhardt Jr. of Hendrick Motorsports finished in second, and Roush Fenway Racing's Greg Biffle was third.\nMark Martin, the event's oldest pole position winner at 51 years and 27 days, led the first four laps before Kasey Kahne passed him on lap five. Martin reclaimed the lead two laps later. The lead changed 52 times between a then-record-breaking 21 different drivers during the race, with Kevin Harvick leading the most laps (41). It was twice stopped because a large pothole developed between turns one and two, due to moisture, cold weather, and heavy cars scraping the tarmac surface as they ran low to the ground for better aerodynamic efficiency. Harvick led on the 206th lap, until McMurray passed him for his first Daytona 500 victory, and the fourth of his career.\nBecause this was the first race of the season, McMurray led the Drivers' Championship with 195 points, followed by Earnhardt in second place who had 175 points and Biffle in third with 170 points. Clint Bowyer and Harvick were fourth and fifth with 165 and 155 points, respectively. In the Manufacturers' Championship, Chevrolet led with nine points, ahead of Ford with six points. Toyota with four points, and Dodge with three points with thirty-five races left in the season.\nBackground.\nThe 2010 Daytona 500 was the 1st of the 36 stock car races in the 2010 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, and the 52nd edition of the event. It was held on February 14, 2010, in Daytona Beach, Florida, at Daytona International Speedway, The layout used for the Daytona 500 is a four-turn, superspeedway. Daytona's turns are banked at 31 degrees, and the front stretch—the location of the finish line—is banked at 18 degrees. A total of 54 cars from 30 different teams were entered for the race.\nNASCAR founder Bill France Sr. conceived the Daytona 500, which was first held in 1959; it is the successor to shorter races held on beaches in Daytona Beach. The race has been the opening round of the NASCAR season since 1982, and from 1988, it is one of four events that require cars to run restrictor plates. The Daytona 500 offers the most prize money of any American auto race. Winning the race is considered equal to winning either the World Series, the Super Bowl or The Masters.\nFor the 2010 race, NASCAR announced that it would stop policing bump drafting after responding to a growing resentment from its fan-base and drivers about the lack of on-track aggression and emotion. It came as the organization gradually controlled, and ultimately outright prohibited, bump drafting at the 2009 AMP Energy 500. Furthermore, NASCAR kept the yellow-marked out-of-bounds line at the bottom of race circuits because drivers opposed its removal. Furthermore, the four restrictor plate opening were expanded to their greatest size since the 1989 Daytona 500 of 63/64-inches for greater horsepower. NASCAR's vice-president of competition Robin Pemberton said that the changes would give control back to the drivers, \"'Boys, have at it' and have a good time.\" NASCAR later changed the green–white–checker finish rule to allow for a maximum of three (not one) attempts to end the race if it would otherwise conclude under caution.\nFollowing an investigation of the circuit's safety barriers and a collision that sent Roush Fenway Racing's Carl Edwards into the catchfence at the 2009 Aaron's 499, track workers raised the height of the Daytona International Speedway catchfences from to . The cost was not stated, and the work was completed in mid-January 2010. An spokesperson for the track's owner and operator International Speedway Corporation said, \"Whenever we have an incident that impacts any of our systems, we take that opportunity to more closely scrutinize it and look at it across the company. Whatever we learn in these analyses, we’ll look and see where it can be applied to other tracks. The challenge is each track is different in terms of banking and speed, so our primary focus right now was on Talladega and Daytona.\"\nPractice and qualifier.\nSix practice sessions were scheduled before the race on February 14. The first two, on February 5, were scheduled to run 80 and 90 minutes, respectively. The next two, on February 10, lasted 90 and 50 minutes, respectively. A steady day-long rain shower cancelled the February 12 60-minute session. The final session on February 13 lasted 85 minutes. Dale Earnhardt Jr. led the first practice session on Friday, February 5, which was truncated to an hour due to a thunderstorm from Central Florida, with a lap of 47.770 seconds, followed by Hendrick Motorsports teammates Mark Martin and Jeff Gordon in second and third. Bill Elliott, Robby Gordon, Ryan Newman, Kurt Busch, David Reutimann, Kyle Busch, and Clint Bowyer made up positions four through ten. NASCAR moved the second practice session to Saturday to provide eight drivers who did not set a lap time with some on-track running. David Gilliland led the session with a 48.072-second lap, ahead of Jeff Fuller, Terry Cook, and Derrike Cope.\nOn February 6, 54 vehicles competed in the qualifier for one of the 43 starting spots in the Daytona 500. Each driver ran two laps, and unlike most races during the season, the qualifying session determined the first two positions. The rest of the field would qualify later, through the 2010 Gatorade Duels. Qualifying was held a day early to avoid clashing with Super Bowl XLIV, which was moved forward one week by the National Football League. Friday's rain-out gave drivers little on-track preparation. Martin took his first Daytona 500 pole position, and the 49th of his career, with a lap of 47.074 seconds. At 51 years and 27 days, he was oldest pole position winner in race history. Martin was joined on the grid's front row by Earnhardt. After qualifying, Martin said it was \"really special\" to begin the year on pole position, and felt Earnhardt would challenge for the win.\nMatt Kenseth led the third practice session on February 10 with a 46.331-second lap, followed by Kyle Busch, Brian Vickers, Jeff Burton, Edwards, Bowyer, Kasey Kahne, Reutimann, Kevin Harvick, and Joey Logano. Bowyer slid sideways into an outside barrier after his right-rear tire blew leaving turn two. Reutimann was close by, and hit the rear of Bowyer's car. Reutimann's rear, in turn, was struck by Cope's slowing car. Marcos Ambrose led the fourth practice session later that day with a 46.535-second lap, with Kyle Busch, Reed Sorenson, Logano, Kahne, Kenseth, Paul Menard, Greg Biffle, Elliott Sadler, and Edwards following in the top ten. Early in the session, Hamlin bumped Earnhardt at , who controlled his car through a slide and continued. One of Vickers' tires failed exiting turn two three minutes later, and he spun through grass on the backstretch with minimal structural damage. Just after green flag running resumed, Mike Bliss oversteered on the left exiting the fourth turn, and rammed into Logano. As the rest of the field steered away, Johnson hit the back of Hamlin's car. Johnson stopped on pit road with an orange traffic cone lodged underneath his splitter. Michael Waltrip was hit by another car and went through grass. Due to the various crashes, Bowyer, Reutimann, Cope, Bliss, Johnson, and Logano would switch into their back-up cars for the Gatorade Duels.\nJohnson and Kahne won the Gatorade Duels on February 11. The starting grid was finalized with Johnson, Kahne, Harvick, Tony Stewart, Kyle Busch, Juan Pablo Montoya, Bowyer, and Kurt Busch completing the top ten. The 11 drivers that failed to qualify were Casey Mears, Todd Bodine, Gilliland, Cook, Cope, Aric Almirola, Dave Blaney, Sorenson, Mike Wallace, Norm Benning, and Fuller. Jeff Gordon switched to a back-up car for the race after being involved in a three-car accident. In the final practice session, held in cold and cloudy weather on February 13, Burton led with a 46.108-second lap, ahead of Harvick, Ambrose, Reutimann, and Kenseth, Kyle Busch, Sam Hornish Jr., Regan Smith, Montoya, and Hamlin. 15 minutes in, Bobby Labonte was hit by Scott Speed and sent towards a left-hand wall at , but narrowly avoided hitting it. Smoke billowed from A. J. Allmendinger's engine compartment, and his team changed engines after the session.\nRace.\nLive television coverage of the race began in the United States at midday Eastern Standard Time (EST) () on Fox. Commentary was provided by lap-by-lap analyst Mike Joy, with analysis from three-time Cup Series champion Darrell Waltrip, and former crew chief Larry McReynolds. Around the start of the race, the weather was clear with the air temperature ; conditions were expected to remain consistent. David Uth, senior pastor of First Baptist Church of Orlando, began pre-race ceremonies with an inovcation. Singer and Grammy Award winner Harry Connick Jr. performed the national anthem, and Junior Johnson, former Daytona 500 champion and NASCAR Hall of Fame inductee, commanded the drivers to start their engines. During the pace laps, Gordon, Burton, and Waltrip moved to the rear of the field because they switched into a back-up car, and Allmendinger, and Edwards did the same for changing their engines.\nThe race began at 1:20 p.m. EST and was scheduled to last 200 laps. Johnson pushed Martin into turn one to keep his teammate ahead. Harvick moved to third place because the inside line was faster early on. The first 21 cars were two abreast by the third lap, with a second distinct pack of vehicles in a single line. On lap four, Kahne and those behind him caught Martin but were unable to pass the latter, who maintained the lead at the start-finish line. Stewart assisted Kahne in passing Martin for the lead on the next lap. On lap six, Martin retook the lead on the outside line and turned left to keep it. The first caution was given for a multi-car accident on lap seven; Brad Keselowski's right-rear tire failed, and he struck the turn-two wall, collecting Smith, Hornish, Bliss, Max Papis, and Boris Said, and littering debris on the track. Smith retired while Keselowski and Hornish entered their garages for repairs. Most drivers made pit stops for tire and chassis adjustments. Martin took the lead on the lap-12 restart, followed by Earnhardt and Montoya. On the next lap, Harvick pushed Montoya past Martin on the outside for the lead. Montoya led just one lap, however, as Earnhardt passed him on lap 14. Earnhardt then weaved to block drivers from overtaking him.\nOn lap 17, Harvick failed to pass Earnhardt for the lead into turn three. On the following lap, Harvick took the lead on the inside; Kahne and Sadler pushed him to hold the lead until they passed him for first and second on lap 22. On the next lap, Harvick returned to the lead as Kahne lost the draft and fell back. By lap 26, Kurt Busch had moved to second. Harvick, Kurt Busch, and Sadler held a 1.4-second lead by the 30th lap. Kurt Busch turned left but did not pass Harvick for the lead. Sadler overtook Kurt Busch for second on lap 34. Kurt Busch took the lead from Sadler and Harvick two laps later. Allmendinger advanced to second place on the 38th lap after starting at the back of the grid. Green flag pit stops commenced on the next lap. Kurt Busch lost the lead to Allmendinger on the backstretch on lap 45, but reclaimed it three laps later on the inside. Allmendinger entered pit road on lap 50, handing the lead to Logano, who held it until his own stop on the next lap. Robby Gordon led the 51st lap.\nAfter the pit stops, Kurt Busch returned to first with Allmendinger second and Johnson third. They pulled away from the rest of the field. On the 58th lap, Kyle Busch overtook Kahne for fifth place. Harvick was stranded on the inside lane, and fell to sixth after Kyle Busch and Kahne passed him on the backstretch on lap 59. On lap 65 Joe Nemechek spun into the turn-four wall; Hornish avoided hitting him, but the second caution was called. The leaders made pit stops for tires and car adjustments. Kenseth stayed on the track to lead one lap until his own pit stop. Kurt Busch led at the lap-70 restart. On the next lap, Harvick helped Allmendinger retake the lead from Kurt Busch. On lap 72, Allmendinger went left, and Harvick passed him to retake the lead. Allemdinger reclaimed the lead on lap 73, when cars on the left outpaced those on the right. Bliss spun on the backstretch four circuits later, damaging his car's rear left and bringing out the third caution.\nThe leaders stopped for fuel, tires, and car adjustments during the caution. When a crew member dropped a lug nut, Allmendinger lost the lead. Because Hamlin staggered his pit stop, he was able to lead one lap. Kurt Busch reclaimed the lead on lap 81, followed by Biffle and Kyle Busch. On lap 82, Biffle used Kyle Busch's help to pass Kurt Busch for first to the inside. Kurt Busch unsuccessfully challenged Biffle between laps 83 and 84. Gordon advanced to third place by the 86th lap after starting near the back of the grid. Kyle Busch took the lead from Greg Biffle on the outside on lap 95. Gordon soon passed Biffle for second place. At the end of lap 98, Gordon used the outside line to pass Kyle Busch. Two laps later, Bowyer passed Gordon on the outside for the lead on the backstretch. Kyle Busch attempted but failed to pass Bowyer in turn two on lap 102. Gordon did the same thing four laps later, but this time he was unable to take the lead and fell back.\nOn the 107th lap, Biffle passed Bowyer to take the lead, but Bowyer reclaimed it on the next lap. Biffle retook the lead from Bowyer on lap 110 after a fast run on the inside. He retained it for one lap before Bowyer passed him to lead the 111th lap. David Ragan passed Bowyer at the end of lap 113 after finding a draft on the outside. Ragan lost the lead to Bowyer two laps later. John Andretti's tire cut, and he crashed into the turn-two wall on the 117th lap to bring out the fourth caution. The majority of the leaders stopped for fuel, tires, and car changes. Travis Kvapil and Said each staggered their pit stops on laps 119 and 120, leading one lap each, before Bowyer reclaimed first place on the 121st lap.\nA long, wide, and deep pothole appeared on the seam near the yellow line between turns one and two on lap 122, causing the race to be stopped for an hour, 40 minutes, and 45 seconds. All vehicles were directed to park on pit road so that track engineers could inspect the damage. They fixed the pothole with two compounds that did not hold owing to moisture and cold weather; a third attempt permitted the race to continue. Drivers were summoned to their cars at 4:52 EST, and engines were restarted eight minutes later. Racing resumed under caution, and the pit road was reopened to drivers. Bowyer led Ragan and Kahne on the inside lane at the lap-125 restart. Sadler pushed Kahne past Bowyer (who went right) for the lead two laps later. On lap 129, Kahne repelled Bowyer by turning right, allowing Sadler to pull alongside him. Bowyer took the lead on the next lap, but Sadler passed him before the finish line. Sadler lost the lead to Bowyer on lap 131, but reclaimed it on the following lap.\nDuring the 136th lap, Harvick made it three abreast on the backstretch, putting Sadler in the middle of the track, and Bowyer reclaimed the lead. Two laps later, Harvick overtook teammate Bowyer just before the start-finish line. On lap 141, Gordon attempted to pass Bowyer for third, but Kahne helped Bowyer block Gordon. On lap 142, Allmendinger, fifth, spun into the backstretch after losing control of his car in turn four. He avoided a collision with a wall and became stranded in the grass, where his car caught fire, causing the sixth caution. During the caution, most drivers made pit stops for tires and adjustments. Sadler led the 146 restart with two new tires, followed by Martin Truex Jr. and Harvick. Truex passed Sadler two laps later with help from Harvick to take the lead. Sadler went to the outside on lap 150 and dropped to tenth place after a failed challenge for first. Harvick reclaimed the lead by overtaking Truex on the inside on the next lap. Montoya gained the lead for the second time on the 154th lap, but Harvick passed him to recover the lead.\nA competition caution was issued for teams on lap 161 to inspect their vehicles because the pothole between turns one and two had resurfaced, larger than before. The race was halted for the second time on lap 161, and cars were obliged to park on pit road for 44 minutes and 35 seconds. Workers collected polyester resin products from other teams and blended them with a hardener. They then heated the compound with blow torches and jet dryers to make the track driveable. Drivers reentered their cars at 6:22 p.m. EST, and restarted their engines eight minutes later. The race resumed under caution as the leaders stopped for tire and car adjustments. Speed took the lead for the lap 168 restart. On the following lap, Biffle used drafting from teammates Ragan and Edwards on the outside lane to pass Speed for first. On the 176th lap, Speed retook the lead from Biffle on the inside lane. He battled Biffle for the following seven laps until Biffle moved away on lap 184. Kurt Busch overtook Edwards for third on lap 188. The seventh caution came six laps later, when Sadler lost control of his car on the backstretch and struck the barrier, collecting Kvapil and Newman. Bowyer led Biffle and Truex at the lap 198 restart.\nBiffle passed Bowyer for first on the backstretch before an eighth caution was waved for an accident on lap 199: Elliott and Logano collided in the third turn, collecting Said. On lap 202, Biffle led at the first green–white–checker finish, prolonging the race by two laps. On the next lap, just as Harvick took the lead from Biffle in turn two, the ninth caution was issued when Gordon hit Kahne on the backstretch and Kahne slid up the track, collecting Robert Richardson Jr. and Labonte. A second green–white–checker finish restarted the race on lap 206 (bringing it to 208 laps), with Harvick leading Jamie McMurray. Edwards delayed Harvick, allowing McMurray to take the lead with help from Biffle on the outside at turn three on lap 207. Earnhardt moved from tenth to second within 1½ laps, but could not challenge McMurray, who took his first Daytona 500 win, and the fourth of his career. Earnhardt, Biffle, Bowyer, Reutimann, Truex, Harvick, Kenseth, Edwards and Montoya completed the top ten. There were 52 lead changes among a then-record 21 drivers during the race. Harvick led the most laps of any driver, with 41. McMurray led once for two laps.\nPost-race comments.\nMcMurray appeared in Victory Lane after celebrating in the infield to commemorate his fourth career win in front of an estimated crowd of 175,000 people; the win earned him $1,508,449. He was emotional about his victory, saying, \"I can’t really put it into words the way it feels. I’m trying to be genuine and as sincere as I can and not sound cliché: as a kid growing up, this is what you dream of, of being able to win the Daytona 500.\" Earnhardt said finishing second validated the changes his team made, and was confident about his prospects over the coming races. He commented on the on-track action, \"I went wherever they weren’t, I don’t enjoy being that aggressive. If there was room for the radiator, you hold the gas down and go. They did a lot to put the racing back in the driver’s hands. There was a ton of bumping out there and I never felt like anyone was looking over my shoulder.\" Third-placed Biffle said he felt he made his move too soon on the first green–white–checker finish, \"The restarts, I couldn’t get anybody to push me, I kept getting a run. I wish I waited until the backstretch to make my big run. I did it on the frontstretch. I gave Junior and all the guys too much of an opportunity to catch us.”\nThe race was the first since the 2004 Advance Auto Parts 500 at Martinsville Speedway to be affected by a deteriorating track. The pothole's reemergence was attributed to the cars' weight uprooting the surface patch, and enlarging it to twice its original size. Daytona International Speedway President Robin Braig took responsibility and apologized for the track surface. He stated that no issues were discovered during a pre-race inspection, and believed cars running too low to the ground for better aerodynamic efficiency had caused the pothole. A week of heavy rain that flooded the track in May 2009, the pre-race downpour, below-average ground temperatures, and cars bottoming out and scraping the tarmac surface all contributed to the pothole forming. Between February 18 and 20, engineers and asphalt specialists repaired the damage with a wide and section of concrete. The track was later repaved from July 5 to December 10, its first repaving since 1978.\nEarnhardt said he was unsatisfied with the reviewed green-white-checker finish rules because he was uncertain about drivers' actions, but he did not believe it was overdone, \"I feel like the fans deserve probably more of a show, so that's what they got. The green-white-checkered was put into play to give us an opportunity to finish the race under green. Finishing under yellow is quite a melodramatic moment.\" Gordon reiterated an earlier view of his that only one attempt should be made, \"I believe in doing things for the fans but I also think they have their limits. It wasn't going to give us a winning day by not having multiple green-white-checkers but it would have saved us a race car.\" Pemberton stated that the rule change validated NASCAR increasing the on-track action and emphasized that three efforts were made to finish the race, \"I've seen great [Daytona 500s] that were a half-dozen cars duking it out, And this race right here, with the potential of the top 15 or 20 guys up there, in the last 25 miles, was incredible. A great race in my opinion though I've only watched 33 of 'em.\"\nBecause this was the season's first race, McMurray led the Drivers' Championship with 195 points, followed by Earnhardt with 15 points less in second, and Biffle third. Bowyer, Harvick, Reutimann, Truex, Kenseth, Montoya, Edwards, Martin, and Burton rounded out the top twelve drivers. Chevrolet led the Manufacturers' Championship with nine points, three ahead of Ford, five ahead of Toyota, and six ahead of Dodge. The race attracted 13.294 million television viewers; excluding the two stoppages, it took three hours, 47 minutes and 16 seconds to complete, and the margin of victory was 0.119 seconds."

        "title": "List of FIS Alpine Ski World Cup men's race winners",
        "text": "This is a list of all male winners in FIS Alpine Ski World Cup from 1967 to present. \nThe list includes all downhill, super-G, giant slalom, slalom, combined, parallel slalom and parallel giant slalom, but does not show team events.\nHistory.\nIn 57 World Cup seasons 1927 races (532 downhills, 245 super-G's, 457 giant slaloms, 538 slaloms, 134 combined, 2 parallel slaloms, 10 city events, 8 parallel giant slaloms and 1 K.O. slalom) for men were held. These events saw 1939 winners, because twelve races (five downhills, four super-G's, one giant slalom, and two slaloms) ended with a tie.\nA total of 307 male alpine skiers from 20 nations have won at least one individual race. The first winner in 1967 was the Austrian Heinrich Messner who won the slalom in Berchtesgaden. The newest member in this list is Swiss Stefan Rogentin who won the super-G in Saalbach, Austria on 23 March 2024. Alpine skiers from twenty nations from three continents have won races; Yugoslavia and Slovenia are listed separately, but counted as one nation; also Germany and West Germany are shown but counted together. The first winner for his country is highlighted in plum.\nJean-Claude Killy was the first skier to win races in two seasons (1967 and 1967/1968), while Ingemar Stenmark won races in 13 seasons and set a record for the greatest absolute number of races won in a single season winning 13 races (out of 33 total) in the 1978–79 season. He won races between 1974/1975 and 1988/1989, only failing to win in the seasons 1984/1985 and 1987/1988. Marc Girardelli, Benjamin Raich, and Aksel Lund Svindal all won races in twelve seasons. Stenmark was also able to win races in ten consecutive seasons (1974/1975 to 1983/1984). Alberto Tomba bettered this mark, when he won races in eleven consecutive seasons (1987/1988 to 1997/1998), and he is still the only skier to do so. Marcel Hirscher (2009/2010 to 2018/2019), Alexis Pinturault (2011/2012 to 2020/2021), Dominik Paris (2012/2013 to 2021/2022), and Henrik Kristoffersen (2013/2014 to 2022/2023) won races in ten consecutive seasons. Pirmin Zurbriggen (1981/1982 to 1989/1990), Michael Walchhofer (2002/2003 to 2010/2011), Aksel Lund Svindal (2005/2006 to 2013/2014), and Ted Ligety (2007/2008 to 2015/2016) all won races in nine consecutive seasons.\nPatrick Russel was the first to win races in three and four seasons, Henri Duvillard was the first to win races in five seasons. Gustav Thöni was the first to win races in six, seven, and eight seasons. Ingemar Stenmark was the first to win races in nine, ten, eleven, and twelve seasons and he is the only skier to win races in 13 seasons.\nJean-Claude Killy won all his 18 races in only two seasons, achieving the unmatched feat of winning 12/17, or ~71% of races in a single season (1967), while Günther Mader won his 14 races in nine seasons. Paul Accola was only able to win races in one season (1991/1992), but won seven events in four disciplines. Rok Petrovič also won races only in one season (1985/1986) when he won five slaloms. Michael von Grünigen is the highest placed racer to win in only one discipline – 23 giant slaloms.\n103 racers have won only one race. The downhill races saw 121 different winners (the 100th different winner was Canada's Manuel Osborne-Paradis in 2009), the super-G races saw 85 different winners, the giant slaloms 103 different (the 100th different winner was Norway's Lucas Braathen in 2020), the slaloms 118 different (the 100th different winner was Italy's Cristian Deville in 2012), combined events 40 different winners, parallel slalom events saw ten different winners and parallel giant slalom events saw seven different winners.\nThe youngest male winner is Piero Gros (born 30 October 1954) who won the giant slalom in Val-d'Isère on 8 December 1972 at the age of 18 years and 39 days. The oldest winner is Didier Cuche (born 16 August 1974) who was aged 37 years and 192 days when he won the super-G in Crans-Montana on 24 February 2012. The oldest skier to win his first race was Dave Ryding (born 5 December 1986) when he won the slalom in Kitzbühel on 22 January 2022, he was aged 35 years and 48 days.\nThe highest bib number with 66 to win a race was worn by Markus Foser in the downhill of Val Gardena on 17 December 1993. Only five days later the highest bib number to win a super-G was 51 used by Hannes Trinkl in Lech am Arlberg on 22 December 1993. In giant slalom the highest bib number 45 to win belonged to the youngest winner ever Piero Gros on 8 December 1972 in Val-d'Isère. The record holder for the highest bib number in slalom is Ivica Kostelić, who won in Aspen, Colorado with 64. Niels Hintermann won the Alpine combined in Wengen on 17 January 2017 with bib number 51. The third highest bib number overall to win a race was 61 worn by Josef Strobl on 16 December 1994 in the downhill in Val-d'Isère.\nDisciplines were introduced in World Cup: downhill, giant slalom and slalom in 1967; Combined and parallel slalom in 1975; super-G in 1982, super-combined in 2006 and renamed to alpine combined in 2015. \nFive skiers have won races in all five main disciplines: Marc Girardelli, Pirmin Zurbriggen, Bode Miller, Kjetil André Aamodt and Günther Mader. An additional two skiers, Frenchmen Jean-Claude Killy and Henri Duvillard, have won races in all three disciplines contested during their careers (super-G was first introduced as a part of the giant slalom discipline in 1983 and was only established as a separate discipline in 1986, well after the 1968 and 1973 retirements of Killy and Duvillard, respectively)."

        "title": "Harry Bowen (rugby union)",
        "text": "David Henry \"Harry\" Bowen (4 May 1864 – 17 August 1913) was a Welsh international rugby union player who played club rugby for Llanelli and international rugby for Wales. After his retirement from playing he became a rugby administrator and referee. He is best remembered as a popular Llanelli captain, who scored the winning dropped goal against the 1888 touring New Zealand Māori.\nPlaying career.\nBowen joined Llanelli at the age of 15 and quickly became a club favourite. He was first selected to represent Wales as part of the 1883 Home Nations Championship against England in the inaugural game of the new competition. Under the captaincy of Charles Lewis, Bowen was one of three Llanelli players chosen for the game, and along with teammates Alfred Cattell and Thomas Judson became the first player to represent Llanelli at international level. The game was a one sided affair, with England victorious, though the Welsh play was of a higher standard than the first encounter between the teams. The next game of the tournament was an away match to Scotland, and Wales experimented with one full-back player for the first time. Bowen was one of the full-backs, paired for the England game with captain Lewis, the selectors favoured Lewis, and Bowen was dropped.\nIn 1884 Bowen was part of the Llanelli squad which reached the final of the 1884 South Wales Challenge Cup, facing Newport. Played at Neath, Llanelli beat Newport by one try to nil. In 1886 the same two teams met each other again in the final of the same competition, this time Bowen was captain of Llanelli, having been given the position on the retirement mid-season of Frederick Margrave. When Llanelli were again victorious, their return to the town was celebrated by the locals who greeted them with thousands of rockets and coloured lights. 'Touchstone', the \"Western Mail's\" sporting correspondent suggested that Bowen should be \"memorialized in a tinplate statue\".\n1884 also saw Bowen move North for a short period, when he signed for Dewsbury; but after playing \"only a handful of games\", he returned to play in Wales.\nIn 1886 Bowen found himself back in the Welsh squad after Newport's Arthur 'Monkey' Gould, who had taken Charles Lewis' position, switched from full-back into the three-quarters. This gave Bowen three more caps, both games in the 1886 Championship and the opener in 1887. After losing to England in the first game of the 1886 tournament, Wales and Cardiff captain Frank Hancock famously decided to trial the four three-quarter system. Although Wales were strong in their fast moving back-play, the power of the Scottish pack, now with a man advantage, began to dominate the forward play. The Welsh forwards appeared loath to give the backs the ball, so during the game the four three-quarter tactic was abandoned and it was decided that Bowen would move into the pack to provide reinforcement, while Gould dropped to full-back. This was seen by some supporters as a 'political' move by the Cardiff captain, sacrificing a Llanelli player to allow Gould the full-back position. The Guardian wrote, \"to please Cardiff, four three-quarters were played with disastrous results. When room had to be made for a Cardiff man, a Llanellyite, of course, had to make way for him.\" Bowen would play one more game for Wales, a nil-nil draw with England at Stradey Park in 1887, and was replaced by Hugh Hughes in the next game of the tournament; but Wales had difficulty finding a long-term full-back until the appearance of Billy Bancroft during the 1889/90 season.\nIn 1888, with his international rugby career behind him, Bowen played in his most notable game when he was part of the Llanelli team that face the touring New Zealand Natives. Bowen not only scored a spectacular dropped goal from near the halfway line, which brought Llanelli the victory; but also charged down an on target kick at goal form the Māori that would have levelled the game. Although Bowen played a vital role in the game, he was not chosen for the Welsh team that faced the Māori three days later at Swansea.\nIn January 1889, Bowen left Llanelli to take up a teaching post in Bangor, North Wales, though he kept a close connection with the club. He was remembered as a diligent captain who \"kept his eyes all over the field\" and held the ability to secure obedience from his fellow players.\nInternational matches played.\nWales (rugby union)\nAs an administrator.\nAfter retiring from playing rugby, Bowen retained his links with rugby union. On returning to West Wales in 1891 he became an administrator for Llanelli RFC, taking on the role of club secretary. The next year he extended his duties by becoming the club's treasurer, holding both positions until 1897 when the duties were passed to Rhys Harry. Bowen remained on the Llanelli board, and in 1897 he was elected as club chairman, a role he held until 1902. His duties to rugby extended beyond club level as he later became a Welsh selector and a rugby referee. He refereed just one international, the 1905 Home Nations Championship encounter between England and Scotland."

        "text": "The 1949 British Grand Prix was a Grand Prix motor race which was held at Silverstone on 14 May 1949. The race was won by Emmanuel de Graffenried driving a Maserati 4CLT.\nBackground.\nThe 1949 Grand Prix was held just seven months after the 1948 event on a substantially modified layout. For 1949 the layout used perimeter roads only, no longer running down the runways. The layout was much the same as that used until 1973 with the exception of a tight chicane at what became Club corner in order to ensure cars were tested at both high and low speeds.\nAlso new for 1949 was the RAC being granted \"Grande Epreuve\" status for their race, officially adopting the title of British Grand Prix.\nEntries.\nAlthough a large entry was attracted, in spite of the increased importance placed on the event the entry did not include any true factory entries.\nPractice and qualifying.\nPractice began on the Thursday before the race, although not all competitors arrived, some having travelled from the 1949 Roussillon Grand Prix in Perignan. Peter Walker set the fastest time on Thursday in 2 minutes 13.2. Luigi Villoresi was still tired, having arrived directly from Perignon, but was able to set second fastest time in 2 minutes 14.4, followed by Tony Rolt (2 minutes 15.8) and Cuth Harrison (2 minutes 16.4).\nTimes improved the following day as more of the international drivers had arrived. Villoresi would improve on his Thursday time to be fastest of all in 2 minutes 9.8, followed by Bira, who had also arrived from Perignan, in 2 minutes 10.2. The next fastest times set on Friday were by Emmanuel de Graffenried (2 minutes 13.6) and Bob Gerard (2 minutes 14.4).\nThe starting grid was arranged in rows of five, then four, then five, and so on.\nRace.\nBira made the best start in his Maserati, leading Villoresi's similar car by a clear two lengths at the first corner, followed closely by two more Maseratis, driven by de Graffenried, and by Reg Parnell taking advantage of starting directly behind the fastest drivers. Fifth was the ERA of Gerard. Villoresi overtook Bira for the lead on the third lap, as the pair pulled away from the rest of the field.\nOn lap 24, Bira regained the lead, and Villoresi began slowing, stopping for fuel at the end of lap 27 and dropping to fourth place behind Parnell moving into second place just slightly ahead of de Graffenried. Behind Villoresi was the Alta of George Abecassis in fifth and another Maserati, that of Fred Ashmore, in sixth. After thirty laps Bira had lapped every car outside of the top four. Not long after this Abecassis lost most of his exhaust pipe but continued on unfazed, while at the same time Villoresi stopped again, this time retiring with a loss of oil pressure.\nBira began suffering from brake fade, allowing Parnell to slowly close the gap but after 40 laps they were still around 40 seconds apart, with de Graffenried now around 20 seconds behind Parnell, followed now by Gerard and the Talbot-Lago of Philippe Étancelin. On his 48th lap Bira was unable to slow for the Club chicane, colliding with the straw bales and a barrel, damaging his suspension too much to continue, giving the lead to Parnell. At the halfway point (50 laps), Parnell lead de Graffenried by 23.6 seconds, followed by Gerard in third from Billy Cotton (who had taken over David Hampshire's ERA), and the Talbot-Lagos of Louis Rosier and Étancelin.\nParnell did not lead for long, however, as his axle oil plug popped out, losing him the lead. He would stop three more times over the next few laps and eventually retired after 69 laps due to a broken rear axle. So then after 60 laps the order was de Graffenried over three minutes ahead of Gerard, the soon to retire Parnell, Cotton, the two Talbot-Lagos, Ashmore and the Alta of Abecassis back up to seventh after losing a significant amount of time with carburettor trouble. Soon after Rosier took his Talbot-Lago into fourth place ahead of Cotton.\nFor the final 30 laps Gerard began to catch de Graffenried but was still some way back. His progress was helped by de Graffenried making a second stop for fuel on lap 85, but only managed to come within a minute of leading. So then de Graffenried won the race in a time of nearly four hours, 65 seconds ahead of Gerard who was himself a lap clear of third placed Rosier, the only driver to complete the race without stopping for fuel."

Haerle observed that the U.S. Baseball League \"stressed the inherent 'good' of baseball for all individuals and communities, and indicated that it wished to conduct its business in the accepted capitalist style–free competition in the marketplace\". Despite these lofty ambitions, the league quickly incurred the scorn and hostility of the baseball establishment. Additionally burdened with weak leadership, limited financing, poor attendance, and a lack of skillful players, the U.S. Baseball League \"folded after about one month of action\".\nLegacy.\nMany sports historians view the U.S. Baseball League as \"a major precursor to the Federal League of 1914–1915\". The Federal League, which was the last independent major league, was financed by magnates including oil \"baron\" Harry F. Sinclair.\nStandings.\nThe league's regular season began May 1, 1912 and ended June 5. The \"Richmond Times Dispatch\" released the intended 126-game USL schedule, to have run from April 8 through September 22."

        "text": "Jay Steven Smith (born June 21, 1961) is an American college basketball coach. He currently serves in an administrative role for the men's basketball team at the University of Michigan. He was a former head coach at Grand Valley State University (1996–97) and Central Michigan University (1997–2006). He has also been an assistant coach at the University of Michigan and the University of Detroit.\nPlaying career.\n, Smith still reigns as the all-time scorer in Michigan High School Athletic Association (MHSAA) basketball history, after a head-spinning 2,841-point career at Mio-Au Sable High School in Mio, Michigan. Of note, this was before the three-point shot. There is a road named after him in Mio, \"Jay Smith Drive\". In April 2019, Smith was named Michigan's \"Retro Mr. Basketball 1979\" by the Basketball Coaches Association of Michigan (BCAM). Michigan's Mr. Basketball was not formally given out until 1981, so the BCAM went back and named a \"Retro Mr. Basketball\" for every year from 1920 through 1980. Smith set the Michigan single-season scoring record with 952 points in the 1978–79 season. His record was surpassed in the 1984–1985 season by Mark Brown of Hastings High School, who scored 969 points. (Brown's 2,789 points are second all-time in state history to Smith) Smith's 952 points are still the third most all-time in a single-season in state history. Smith played one year of college basketball at Bowling Green State University, before transferring and playing the final three years of his career at Saginaw Valley State University.\nCoaching career.\nSmith began his coaching career at Kent State University in 1984, earning a master's degree in Sport's Administration in 1986. In 1989, Smith left for the University of Michigan, the reigning Division 1 National champions, to join Steve Fisher's staff in Fisher's first full-season as head coach at Michigan. He returned to Ann Arbor in July 2019, accepting a role as director of player personnel and development, joining first-year head coach Juwan Howard's staff. Smith helped recruit Howard and the rest of the Fab Five, a group of five freshmen that led Michigan to appearances in the 1992 and 1993 NCAA Championship games.\nSmith returned to the assistant coaching ranks in 2008, joining Ray McCallum's staff at the University of Detroit Mercy, where he spent eight seasons.\nHead Coaching Career.\nGrand Valley State University.\nSmith's took his first head coaching job in 1996, leading Grand Valley State University to 23–6 record, winning the Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference regular season and tournament championships and a berth into the NCAA Men's Division II basketball tournament. Smith left GVSU after one season, becoming the head coach at Central Michigan University.\nCentral Michigan University.\nSmith took over a CMU team that had not had a winning record since 1988 and had not made the NCAA Tournament since 1987. By his fourth season in Mount Pleasant, Smith led the Chippewas to the Mid-American Conference Western Division title, their first since 1987 and Smith won MAC coach of the year honors. In March 2003, the Chippewas would win their first MAC Tournament Championship since 1987, defeating Kent State 77–67. The win gave the Chippewas an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament, their first since 1987. The Chippewas defeated sixth-seeded Creighton in the first round, 79–73, earning their first NCAA Tournament win since 1975. Center Chris Kaman was awarded conference player of the year as well as defensive player of the year for his efforts. Kaman was selected with the 6th overall pick in the 2003 NBA draft by the Los Angeles Clippers.\nFollowing the 2003 season, Smith was never able to find success again at CMU, compiling 20–66 record over the next three seasons. Smith shocked the CMU community in May 2006, when he abruptly resigned as head coach, citing a desire to spend more time with his family.\nKalamazoo College.\nIn June 2016, Smith returned to the head coaching ranks, taking over the program at Kalamazoo College.\nPersonal life.\nSmith is married with two children. His son, Cooper, played for him at Kalamazoo College during the 2018–19 season. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer in June 2018 and underwent successful surgery in September 2018 and managed to coach the full season."

        "title": "2009 Giro d'Italia, Stage 1 to Stage 11",
        "text": "The 2009 Giro d'Italia began on 9 May, with Stage 11 occurring on 20 May. The first stage, like it had been since 2007, was a team time trial, a stage where each member of the team raced together against the clock. Like most cycling Grand Tours do, the beginning of the 2009 Giro included a string of flat stages that were contested by sprinters. These stages were contested by Alessandro Petacchi and Mark Cavendish, among others, with Petacchi in victory becoming one of the only riders to defeat Cavendish in a sprint in the 2009 season.\nAt the end of the race's first week and beginning of its second were three hilly medium-mountain stages. These stages took the Giro through Austria and Switzerland before returning to Italy. Each of these stages took more than five hours to complete, and the rain that fell each day combined with the difficulties presented by the numerous ascents and descents made the courses potentially unsafe in the riders' opinion. This opinion was perhaps validated by the life-threatening injuries sustained by Pedro Horrillo in the eighth stage after he crashed while descending a mountain. While the ninth stage was meant to be a showy criterium in celebration of this being the 100th anniversary of the Giro d'Italia, the riders collectively protested the safety conditions of that stage and the ones before it. This meant it would be neutralized, with every rider receiving the same finishing time as the stage winner regardless of when they finished.\nThe tenth stage was the longest of this year's Giro, and one of its most mountainous. It, along with a stage later in the race, were both called the race's queen stage, its most difficult stage. Danilo Di Luca won this stage to pad his overall lead going into the second half of the Giro.\nStage 1.\n9 May 2009 — Lido (Venice), (team time trial)\nThe 2009 Giro began, as it had since 2007, with a team time trial (TTT). The ride over a perfectly flat course in Venice decided who would wear the first pink jersey.\n was the first team to ride the course, and wound up being the stage winners. They all finished together, which is relatively uncommon (especially for a winning team: only , which took the course nearly a minute slower, managed to also have all nine riders cross the finish line together). , who had said previously it was their goal to replicate their TTT victory from the 2008 Giro d'Italia, finished officially 6 seconds back of , but they had only the minimum of 5 riders finishing together (the team's time is taken for the fifth rider to cross the line). As the first rider to cross the line, Mark Cavendish was awarded the first pink jersey as general classification (GC) leader; he was also awarded the white jersey as youth classification leader.\nStage 2.\n10 May 2009 — Jesolo to Trieste, \nThis stage was very flat. It had only one categorized climb, at low elevation, near the end. This climb award the first points in the mountains classification and thus, the first green jersey awarded to its leader. The riders took three laps of an finishing circuit in Trieste, with the points for the climb taken on their second time over the hill at Montebello.\nLeonardo Scarselli was free of the main field for most of the stage after escaping early in the morning. The bunch caught him with to race, though. David García won the climb in Trieste to become the first wearer of the green jersey, and Alessandro Petacchi won the group sprint to the line, narrowly edging out race leader Mark Cavendish.\nA crash on the third pass over the Montebello hill meant the field was broken, with only 51 riders together for the sprint finish. The rest of the peloton finished 13 seconds back, and since this crash occurred outside from the finish line, all time lost stood as lost. Notables among those who lost 13 seconds were Levi Leipheimer and Ivan Basso.\nStage 3.\n11 May 2009 — Grado to Valdobbiadene, \nThis stage was also flat, and ended in a mass sprint.\nA five rider breakaway, which had a maximum advantage of seven minutes, took the points at the one intermediate sprint and the one categorised climb of the day, but were caught with some remaining. A number of crashes occurred starting at the remaining mark, and a series of attempted breaks meant that the peloton was fragmented, and Alessandro Petacchi took a second successive stage from a depleted group sprint.\nThe biggest victim of the repeated crashes was leader Christian Vande Velde, who had to retire from the Giro with a broken rib and a hairline fracture of his pelvis. The crashes also made it so Mark Cavendish was not with the main peloton as it approached the finish line; he came to within 15 seconds of the group before abandoning the attempt to reach them, and essentially conceding the pink jersey. Petacchi's second straight stage win gave him the race leadership.\nStage 4.\n12 May 2009 — Padova to San Martino di Castrozza, \nThis was the first mountain stage of the Giro, with a high climb coming at and a mountain finish at San Martino di Castrozza.\nA group of 6 riders escaped after just . This group comprised Serafín Martínez, Francesco Bellotti, Davide Viganò, Ian Stannard, Francesco De Bonis, and Jens Voigt. They attained a maximum advantage of six and a half minutes, and with a healthy pace of through the stage's first three hours, it appeared possible that one of them would be the stage winner. The pace caught up with the group as they reached the foot of the day's final climb, and only Voigt and Bellotti remained together as the climb began. Two kilometers into the climb, Voigt attacked again and tried to solo to victory over the last .\nThe top GC men in the peloton and the specialist climbers formed a chase group that overhauled Voigt in the final . The attacks of Colombian climber Mauricio Soler had been responsible for driving this group to catch the remnants of the breakaway, and he attacked again in the final , quickly getting a gap over the competition and appearing poised for the stage win. As Soler had been the one who caused the crash that kept Mark Cavendish from potentially defending the pink jersey the day before, his combativeness on this stage was described as his \"redemption\". 2007 Giro d'Italia winner Danilo Di Luca timed his sprint to the line just right and overtook Soler for the victory. Sixteen riders finished with the same time as Di Luca, ten more were six seconds back, and a further 26 were inside a minute of his winning time. Thomas Lövkvist, who finished in the same group as Di Luca, took a narrow lead in the overall classification after the stage. However, Di Luca later tested positive for EPO and was stripped of his victory. The stage win was subsequently awarded to Stefano Garzelli, the runner-up.\nStage 5.\n13 May 2009 — San Martino di Castrozza to Alpe di Siusi, \nThis was one of the shortest road race stages in the 2009 Giro, but its profile was quite unusual. It saw the riders start where they ended the previous day, on the mountaintop at San Martino di Castrozza, climb some for a categorized climb at Passo Rolle, and then descend over before climbing most of that distance right back for another mountaintop finish at Alpe di Siusi.\nA seven-man breakaway was clear over the Passo Rolle climb and took a maximum lead of four and a half minutes in the valley between peaks. Giovanni Visconti was briefly race leader on the road, as he began the stage just under three minutes behind pink jersey wearer Thomas Lövkvist in the General Classification. The peloton, paced by Liquigas, caught them without about left to race, leading the way for Sylwester Szmyd and then Ivan Basso to try to fracture the field before the finish. Six riders were able to keep his pace to the finish, with Denis Menchov the first to Alpe di Suisi for the stage win. The other six in the leading group kept close to the stage winner, with only Carlos Sastre losing more than ten seconds. Danilo Di Luca became the new race leader after his second place on the stage.\nDamiano Cunego, Lance Armstrong and Stefano Garzelli, all of whom had been considered as possible favorites for overall victory in the Giro, all lost more than two minutes on this stage, being unable to take Liquigas' pace on the way up to Alpe di Suisi. As they, along with Michael Rogers, had shown weakness on the climb, one report named as the only remaining possibilities for Giro champion Menchov, Di Luca, Lövkvist, Basso, Levi Leipheimer, and Sastre. The victory gave Menchov stage wins in all three Grand Tours for his career, and his team its first ever Giro d'Italia stage win.\nStage 6.\n14 May 2009 — Brixen to Mayrhofen (Austria), \nThis stage was one of the longest in the 2009 Giro. The first half of the stage was undulating, without a categorized climb. The second half featured two short climbs with a flat valley in between them. The descent from the second climb, Gerlospass, left a flat to race before the finish in Austria.\nThe day's breakaway comprised five riders, and it formed after in the saddle. Their maximum advantage was just under eight minutes. Michele Scarponi and Vasil Kiryienka shed their mates on the second climb of the day, about from the finish. Scarponi dropped Kiryienka later and went it alone for the stage win. The pink jersey group absorbed all the other members of the morning breakaway and finished half a minute behind Scarponi, with six from that group gaining four seconds on race leader Danilo Di Luca at the finish. Lance Armstrong lost even more time, finishing 43 seconds behind second place man Edvald Boasson Hagen.\nStage 7.\n15 May 2009 — Innsbruck (Austria) to Chiavenna, \nThe race returned to Italy, after also passing through Switzerland, in another long stage. The one climb of the day occurred a little over into the stage, the Passo Maloja. The entire stage to that point was on a slight increase in elevation, while the finish was on a long and drastic descent into Chiavenna. Its profile made it seem an inviting stage for breakaway attempts.\nThis stage saw numerous breakaways get away and stay away for a time. The first of them comprised four riders, coming clear after . This group attained a maximum advantage of over nine minutes, but the peloton was able to catch them before the Passo Maloja. Right at the summit, Alessandro Bertolini attacked and came free for a time. He was able to lengthen his escape somewhat by descending the Passo Maloja in an extremely aerodynamic position, out of the saddle with all his weight over the handlebars. A crucial four-man break took place from the finish line, with Bertolini able to stay with them as they caught him, making it a five-man leading group. Andriy Hryvko tried to make his way up to them after they were well away, but could not make it. Despite the presence of more experienced riders and riders noted as sprinters in the break, it was young Norwegian Edvald Boasson Hagen who made it to the line first.\nControversy had arisen before the Giro when it was revealed that many of 's sponsors in Kazakhstan had not paid their full obligations to the team, and that the riders had therefore not been paid their full salaries to that point in the season. In protest, the team wore new jerseys beginning with this stage, that had the names of those underpaying sponsors faded out to the point of being unreadable.\nStage 8.\n16 May 2009 — Morbegno to Bergamo, \nThere were two categorized climbs on this course, including a fairly tall and steep one at Culmine di San Pietro after . However, the amount of flat racing after the descent suggested that the type of finish this stage would see was far from certain.\nBetween the and marks in this stage, a ten-man breakaway slowly formed. Their maximum advantage was just over four minutes as they neared the day's second climb, the Colle del Gallo. A group of GC favorites and domestiques from their teams were first over this climb, with race leader Danilo Di Luca not among them at first, almost a minute back. As the leading group seemed unwilling to work together, Di Luca was able to bridge the gap and make it to them. Kanstantsin Sivtsov made the decisive attack of the day, coming clear some from the line, and though he never held even half a minute's advantage, he managed to stay away for the stage win.\nThis stage also saw a dramatic and life-threatening crash from Pedro Horrillo, on the Culmine di San Pietro. His bike skidded on wet leaves during the descent, causing him to lose control of his machine, slide into a guardrail, and tumble head over heels down the mountainside. Horrillo fell and sustained fractures to his thighbones, kneecaps, and T12 and C3 vertebrae, as well as a punctured lung and internal bleeding. He was airlifted off the mountain and was then taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital. Horrillo woke up in the ambulance, but was put in a chemically induced coma to aid his treatment. He was taken out of the coma the next day, with scans revealing no brain damage. The peloton's protest of Stage 9 the next day was largely in reaction to Horrillo's serious injury.\nAfter spending some five weeks in hospitals both in Italy and his native Spain, Horrillo eventually recovered.\nStage 9.\n17 May 2009 — Milan, (Milano Show 100)\nThis stage was a circuit race. The field took 10 laps of a course in Milan (there was a run-in before the circuits began). The course was flat, and the stage figured to be a major sprinters' battle.\nThe character of this stage changed drastically after the dramatic injury sustained by Pedro Horrillo the day before brought attention to safety conditions on this and other courses in the Giro. With the course passing over numerous different surfaces, including tram tracks and cobblestones, the peloton collectively protested racing this course, and as such it was neutralized, with everyone receiving the same time as the stage winner and no points were awarded for the points classification as had been planned. There were also parked cars at the side of the road in many places, forcing the riders into narrow tunnels to get through them.\nOriginally, the result of the riders' protest was only that the stage times would not count. The peloton rode the first four laps very slowly, about slower than previous stages, and at the end of the fourth lap, the race stopped altogether as race leader Danilo Di Luca took a microphone to address the crowd and explain why they were riding so slowly. Lance Armstrong, who along with Di Luca had been considered the voice of the peloton in the protest, apologized to the fans for the effect it had on what was supposed to be a grand spectacle, but also contended that it was the correct decision for the peloton to make.\nThe pace did eventually pick up, on the last lap, and the finish was contested in a bunched sprint, won by Mark Cavendish.\nStage 10.\n19 May 2009 — Cuneo to Pinerolo, \nAfter the rest day, the riders were faced with the Giro's longest stage, with numerous high mountain climbs along the course and the distinction of being the race's queen stage. It was originally scheduled to include the Col d'Izoard, which has been featured numerous times in the Tour de France as an hors catégorie climb. Race officials later decided to alter the course, staying on the Italian side of the Alps, believing the stretches that were to take place in France were too remote and that radio communication in the area could not be assured. The course as it originally was designed mimicked exactly a course used in the 1949 Giro d'Italia.\nThe resulting alterations caused the course to be even longer than first planned, rather than , with a small categorized climb just under from the finish. This came after a long descent from what became the course's principal climb, Sestrière. The race's overall contenders were expected to distinguish themselves on this stage.\nA surprisingly fast beginning to the stage, with a first hour that covered over , managed to keep any breakaways from going clear for over two hours. Twelve eventually came ahead of the peloton, with seven in the lead and five chasing between the leaders and the peloton. The third group on the road eventually dwindled to a select contingent of overall favorites, which included race leader Danilo Di Luca. Former Giro champion Stefano Garzelli attacked from this group on the day's first climb and got to the leading group of five before the summit, claiming maximum points on it and on Sestrière to gain leadership of the mountains classification at the end of the day. Garzelli's maximum advantage, at the summit of Sestrière, was just over six minutes.\nA group of most of the top riders in the GC, paced by the race leader himself, caught every one of the twelve initial leaders, and subsequently Garzelli just before the day's last climb, Prà Martino. Di Luca's aggressive descent of Prà Martino gave him a gap over the elite group of riders who had been able to hold his wheel to that point, and the stage win. The day saw a big winner in time gains and a big loser: Lance Armstrong finished 29 seconds behind Di Luca in the same group as the man finishing sixth on the stage, gaining seven places in the GC, while Thomas Lövkvist lost over a minute and fell from second to eighth in the GC.\nStage 11.\n20 May 2009 — Turin to Arenzano, \nThe Passo del Turchino, famous for its use every year in the classic one-day race Milan–San Remo, was visited from the end of this stage. The climb is not difficult enough to be at all selective, so pre-stage analysis led to expectations that either a mass sprint would occur or a breakaway of riders deep down in the GC would finish first on this stage.\nAstana rider Chris Horner did not start the stage due to a leg injury sustained in a fall in Stage 10, leaving Levi Leipheimer and Lance Armstrong without their usual support rider. At the mark, Caisse d'Epargne rider Joaquim Rodríguez dropped out after a 9th-place finish in the previous stage.\nA break formed after , including Gustavo César, Cameron Meyer, Dmytro Grabovskyy and Alessandro Donati. Soon after, Levi Leipheimer crashed, but was unhurt. The break was caught, and a solo break was formed by Vladimir Isaichev. Astana drove the peloton up the Turchino, the day's lone climb, with Armstrong leading the descent and race leader Danilo Di Luca somewhat surprisingly coming forward to hold Armstrong's wheel. Some riders tried to escape for victory on the way into Arenzano, but the sprinters' teams worked to keep the field together, and Mark Cavendish took another bunched sprint win over Tyler Farrar and Alessandro Petacchi.\nIt was after this stage, on the eve of the Cinque Terre time trial, that Danilo Di Luca gave his first of two positive tests for continuous erythropoiesis receptor activator (CERA), the results of which became public after the Giro was over."

        "text": "Stage 12 of the 2009 Giro d'Italia took place on 21 May; the race concluded with Stage 21 on 31 May. The second half of the Giro began with a long and challenging individual time trial in Cinque Terre. It was in this time trial that Denis Menchov took the overall lead in the race. This was followed by a flat stage, after which most of the sprinters in the Giro withdrew from the race, as they did not figure to be in contention in the hilly and mountainous stages to follow.\nThe sixteenth stage was considered to be one of two queen stages, most difficult stages, of this Giro, as it contained many high mountain climbs and the Giro's most difficult summit stage finish. After the second rest day came an unusual stage, one that was very short in terms of sheer distance but on par with previous mountain stages in terms of difficulty. These stages were won by Carlos Sastre and Franco Pellizotti, respectively, who fought for the third step on the Giro's podium behind Menchov and previous race leader Danilo Di Luca. Though Sastre went on to win another stage, to Mount Vesuvius, it was Pellizotti who finished the Giro third overall.\nThe Giro concluded, as it had in 2008, with another individual time trial, this time in the city of Rome. Despite a dramatic and much-replayed crash in the stage's final kilometer, Menchov preserved his overall lead through this stage and thus, the conclusion of the Giro, winning his third career Grand Tour.\nStage 12.\n21 May 2009 — Sestri Levante to Riomaggiore, (individual time trial)\nThe first individual time trial (ITT) of the 2009 Giro was a difficult one, long with quite a lot of climbing. There were two categorized climbs on the course, a quick, intense descent between them and no flat stretches at all. Lance Armstrong, who rode the Giro for the first time in 2009, described the ITT as \"wicked hard\". Reigning Olympic time trial champion Fabian Cancellara called it \"crazy\" and laughed when asked if he would be a contender for victory. Cancellara was in fact the only rider who was still in the race to this point who did not attempt the time trial, instead abandoning the Giro.\nMany riders used normal road race bikes for this stage, as the course is highly atypical for a time trial, with roads that were not flat and straight. Most of those riders altered their road race bikes with the aerodynamic handlebars of a time trial bike, but some, including race leader Danilo Di Luca, did not. The climbs in the stage increased the overall chances for strong climbers who are relatively weak time trialists, such as Damiano Cunego and Gilberto Simoni.\nAcqua &amp; Sapone rider Dario Andriotto set the early time to beat. After a while, Yuriy Krivtsov bested his time. Several different riders in succession then posted successively (but, in the first few cases, marginally) better times than the best time that had come before them. Alessandro Bertolini, David Millar, Marco Pinotti, Giovanni Visconti, Bradley Wiggins, and Stefano Garzelli were all briefly the stage leader after they crossed the finish line. Bertolini in particular was stage leader for about three minutes, as Millar started just behind him and barely beat his time.\nThe fourth- and second-to-last riders to leave the starthouse, Levi Leipheimer and Denis Menchov, put up the best rides of the day, with Menchov between 30 seconds and a minute better than Leipheimer at the three intermediate time checks, and 20 seconds better at the line for the stage win. Menchov's ride propelled him into the pink jersey, while Leipheimer narrowly missed taking enough time out of Di Luca to move past him in the general classification. Di Luca finished sixth on the stage.\nA surprising rider to lose considerable time was three-time former world time trial champion Michael Rogers, who was almost three minutes off Menchov's winning time and slipped from third to sixth in the general classification. Reigning Tour de France champion Carlos Sastre was also unimpressive, 2'18\" behind Menchov, but took advantage of Rogers' bigger misstep to move up to fifth overall.\nStage 13.\n22 May 2009 — Lido di Camaiore to Florence, \nThe riders got some respite in this short, flat stage. There were a few short hills in the first of the stage and one small categorized climb, but after the 60 kilometer mark the course did not so much as undulate, and a sprint finish was the result.\nThree riders broke free of the peloton after — Mikhail Ignatiev, Leonardo Scarselli, and Björn Schröder. Their maximum advantage was 5'20\", but the peloton had no trouble catching them. Ignatiev and Scarselli were absorbed with left to race, while Schröder fought on alone, being caught at around to go. Despite being seven riders deep in the bunch with under to go, Mark Cavendish was able to get a successful leadout from Edvald Boasson Hagen and Mark Renshaw to pick up his third stage win of the Giro. The leadout was so fast that only 21 riders had the same time as the stage winner — another 89, including each of the top ten in the General classification (GC), were eight seconds back. Cavendish actually missed the start of the stage, after becoming stuck in the race village due to his habit of lining up on the start of the race at the last minute to avoid press. He was picked up by a Rabobank team car, which was also running late, and brought back to the field by them. He went on to win the stage.\nStage 14.\n23 May 2009 — Campi Bisenzio to Bologna, \nThis was a hilly stage, with four categorized climbs on the course and a finish on a short (but categorized) climb as well. Pre-race analysis of the stage expected relentless attacks beginning from the first climb of the day, after .\nFourteen riders representing twelve teams broke away after . They stayed clear as a group through the four climbs on course before they started to splinter. Danilo Di Luca's LPR team drove the peloton most of the day, because the finish figured to favor Di Luca more than race leader Denis Menchov or the man in third, Levi Leipheimer. However, one team pulling at the front of the peloton proved to be no match for a 14-man breakaway working cohesively, and by the time the peloton reached the descent of the fourth climb, the last before the summit finish, it was clear the breakaway would not be caught. The breakaway was still twelve strong as it began the last climb of the day. Andriy Hryvko was the first to attack for the stage win, but he was caught well before the summit, and wound up finishing in the pink jersey group a minute behind the stage winner. The decisive attack came from Simon Gerrans, who no one could match, giving the Cervélo rider the stage win. Leipheimer and Ivan Basso were both dropped from the pink jersey group just before the summit of the climb and the end of the stage, losing three potentially valuable seconds to the other highly placed riders in the GC. Michael Rogers was a further three seconds back of Leipheimer and Basso, causing him to drop from sixth to seventh in the GC.\nStage 15.\n24 May 2009 — Forlì to Faenza, \nThe peloton faced four categorized climbs in this stage, though none were considered difficult enough to be truly selective. Also on the profile were three uncategorized hills that simply were not as steep. With a flat section at the end of the stage, a breakaway finish was likely.\nThe day began with 16 riders from 14 teams breaking away, after about . They attained a maximum advantage of about six minutes, and race leader Denis Menchov's Rabobank team seemed content to let them go, since no real GC threat was posed: José Serpa was the best placed man in the break, ten minutes back of Menchov. For a while, it seemed that the stage would progress this way to its conclusion, with the breakaway up ahead and the peloton not really chasing very hard.\nThings changed when Ivan Basso's team came forward on the third climb of the day to set a much faster pace in the peloton, and Basso himself attacked and came free, with only Stefano Garzelli holding his wheel. They caught some members of the morning breakaway, as that group also splintered, but were eventually themselves caught. Danilo Di Luca launched an attack on the fourth climb of the day, and for a time he and Menchov were clear of the other GC contenders, but they were also caught — the top seven in the GC were unchanged after this stage.\nAfter the 16-man leading group began splintering, only two were left out front — Leonardo Bertagnolli and Serge Pauwels. For unclear reasons, Pauwels sat up (abandoned the breakaway attempt) in the final kilometers of the stage and left Bertagnolli to take the stage win uncontested. Pauwels joined two behind him who were chasing, as several riders who had been in the pink jersey group but were not overall threats had been allowed to attack on the way into the finish. The pink jersey group finished 1'56\" behind the stage winner, with another 13 riders about 7 minutes back, and the majority of the field between 18 and 26 minutes back, after the peloton had been one cohesive group for close to two-thirds of the stage.\nStage 16.\n25 May 2009 — Pergola to Monte Petrano, \nThis stage was extremely climbing-intensive, with three categorized high mountains, including a mountaintop finish with a very difficult gradient at Monte Petrano, and a smaller climb about a third of the way into the stage. It also had five short uncategorized hills. Following the alterations to Stage 10, this was also called the queen stage of the Giro.\nA large early breakaway began the stage, for the third day in a row. This breakaway numbered 20, which after the first category one climb was whittled down to three, as some riders dropped because of the pace and others, from the teams of race leader Denis Menchov and other contenders, were called back by their sporting directors to stay with their team leaders. The three left out front were Yaroslav Popovych, Damiano Cunego, and Gabriele Bosisio. Eventually, Popovych shed his last remaining breakaway mates and for a time appeared poised for the stage win. The pink jersey group absorbed every member of the morning's breakaway except Popovych and Cunego by the time they began the Monte Petrano climb. Levi Leipheimer, who had previously stated that this was the day he might attack to move up the general classification, was dropped on Monte Petrano and despite the efforts of Lance Armstrong and Janez Brajkovič to pace him back into the pink jersey group, Leipheimer wound up finishing nearly three minutes behind the stage winner, falling from third to sixth in the general classification and effectively eliminating any designs he may have had on the pink jersey. Armstrong had been near the leaders on the climb, but dropped back to help Leipheimer, who would later say that Armstrong saved him \"minutes and minutes\" by shepherding him to the finish.\nDanilo Di Luca tried to attack from the pink jersey group a few times at the foot of the climb, but Menchov answered each time. When Ivan Basso and Carlos Sastre attacked, Menchov and Di Luca let them go, seeming fixed solely on one another. Sastre's attack proved to be the crucial one, as he seemed quite fresh for having been climbing for over seven hours, staying clear of the pink jersey and blowing past Popovych to claim the stage win. With the time gained on the road as well as bonus seconds at the line, Sastre moved up to third in the overall classification. Menchov outsprinted Di Luca to the finish line, gaining one second on the road and four bonus seconds to slightly pad his lead over Di Luca. Thomas Lövkvist, who had been in the white jersey as best young rider, was dropped very early on in this stage and finished 24 minutes behind the stage winner. He wound up dropping all the way to fifth in the youth classification, with Quick Step rider Kevin Seeldraeyers, 15th overall, assuming the white jersey.\nThe weather was also a major factor on the day, with the temperature topping out at over . It caused riders all throughout the race to lose contact with various groups.\nStage 17.\n27 May 2009 — Chieti to Blockhaus, \nAfter the second rest day, the peloton faced the Giro's shortest stage. It was originally scheduled to include the highest point in the 2009 Giro, but the route was changed from the published maps due to the amount of snow at the top of the Blockhaus mountain pass, with of climbing replaced by an equivalent addition to the flat section at the beginning of the stage. The first of this course were almost perfectly flat, followed by a slight increase in gradient for the next , followed by an exceptionally steep final .\nThomas Voeckler started the day's breakaway after about . Nine riders followed him, and their maximum advantage was just under three minutes, with the chase beginning in earnest very early on this stage due to its short length. Many of the riders in the break were unable to maintain the pace set by Voeckler at the foot of the Blockhaus for very long, as only Voeckler, Félix Cárdenas, and Giuseppe Palumbo were left out front as the climb began. The subsequent attacks from the pink jersey group absorbed the three of them. When Sylwester Szmyd attacked from the pink jersey group as the climb began, Franco Pellizotti followed him and was able to get clear, as Szmyd paced him to sizable gap over the pink jersey group before hitting the wall. Lance Armstrong tried to follow, but could not reach Pellizotti, as Pellizotti decided not to wait for Armstrong and chose to race the climb like a time trial. His strong, steady climb was good for the stage win. Armstrong finished the stage in the third group on the road, along with Levi Leipheimer and Carlos Sastre.\nSastre's team had been the one setting the pace in the peloton just before the climb, but fell off when Philip Deignan spun out and tumbled off the road into a ditch. Deignan's bike was damaged and he sustained numerous visible scrapes and bruises, but he managed to continue and finish the stage with the last gruppetto. Sastre himself seemed to be off the form he had had before the rest day, and by virtue of Pellizotti's stage win and two-minute gap over the reigning Tour de France champion, he fell from third to fifth in the overall classification with Pellizotti moving up to third.\nA quartet of riders made the climb in second position on the road behind Pellizotti: race leader Denis Menchov, Danilo Di Luca, Ivan Basso, and Stefano Garzelli. Di Luca rode with a very high cadence in an attempt to separate himself from Menchov, but was unable to until the sprint for the finish line. By virtue of the time bonuses gained for third place as well as the gap on the road, Di Luca closed his deficit to Menchov to under 30 seconds.\nStage 18.\n28 May 2009 — Sulmona to Benevento, \nThe field faced a climb after just in this stage, but following a long and technical descent, the course was gently undulating without any other categorized climbs. Due to the absence of climbs, the stage was expected to favor the Giro's remaining sprinters, but it wound up being contested by a breakaway.\nThe stage began with the largest successful breakaway of the Giro, 25 riders representing 18 teams. The only teams that missed the break were Milram, Ag2r, , and the team of the race leader, Rabobank. They worked together as a cohesive unit for much of the stage, gaining a maximum six-minute advantage over the peloton. Seven of the 25 broke free with left to race, and they contested a final sprint for the stage win. The first rider to try to take the win was Dries Devenyns, but he was quickly overtaken by Félix Cárdenas, who was in turn passed by Danny Pate. Pate, however, had the breakaway's most experienced rider, Michele Scarponi, in his slipstream, and it was Scarponi who timed his sprint just right to take the stage win. The high-placed riders in the general classification all finished with the peloton, 3' 57\" behind the stage winner, so there was no change to the top ten overall.\nIt was after this stage, on the eve of the Mount Vesuvius stage, that Danilo Di Luca gave his second positive test for continuous erythropoiesis receptor activator (CERA).\nStage 19.\n29 May 2009 - Avellino to Mount Vesuvius, \nThe first of this stage saw rough undulation, with many uncategorized hills, including one at almost in elevation. The final saw a steep climb up to the famous Mount Vesuvius at .\nThe breakaway on this stage comprised only two riders, both representing ProTour teams that were without a stage victory in this year's Giro — Mauro Facci of Quick Step and Yuriy Krivtsov of . Their maximum advantage over the peloton was just over seven minutes, but the pink jersey group of overall contenders and their teammates had no trouble catching them, as they did in the little town just before the Mount Vesuvius climb.\nLiquigas tried the same tactic they had employed on the Blockhaus, when Franco Pellizotti took the stage win, as Valerio Agnoli was the first to attack and get clear of the pink jersey group. He was joined soon after not by one of his team leaders, Pellizotti or Ivan Basso, but by rider Paolo Tiralongo, as the overall contenders did not respond. These two wound up being absorbed by the subsequent attack from Carlos José Ochoa, who drew Basso and Stefano Garzelli with him, as they took an appreciable lead on the pink jersey group. Carlos Sastre attacked solo from the pink jersey group next and quickly passed all other riders on the road, and stayed out front to claim his second stage win of this Giro.\nMuch as they had in previous stages, race leader Denis Menchov and the man in second place Danilo Di Luca stayed right with one another all through the climb, as Di Luca tried repeatedly to shed Menchov with attacks, but was unable to. Pellizotti, who had also been holding their wheels, took the opportunity with the two of them taking energy out of each other, to come clear and move into third position on the road. Basso, who was up the road, dutifully sat up and waited for his better-placed teammate and paced him to a small gap over Menchov and Di Luca before cracking. It was enough to ensure Pellizotti second on the stage, to keep him third in the overall classification. Di Luca managed to outsprint Menchov to the line and claim 8 bonus seconds to narrow his deficit to 18 seconds, but with only a flat stage and an individual time trial remaining the superior time trialist Menchov had the advantage.\nStage 20.\n30 May 2009 — Naples to Anagni, \nThis stage was flat, with only a climb to short elevation near the end. A preview predicted a sprint finish, but a late attack decided the stage.\nDanilo Di Luca made it clear that he was aiming for the time bonuses available in this stage, both at the finish line and the intermediate sprint. As such, his team worked to bring the morning's breakaway back well before the end of the stage. Just as he had in the mountains, race leader Denis Menchov stayed right with Di Luca, and the two of them contested the intermediate sprint, with Di Luca's team trying to give him a successful leadout. They mistimed it, however, and Menchov was able to come around Di Luca and beat him to the line (Di Luca's teammate and accomplished sprinter Alessandro Petacchi managed to beat Menchov in the sprint to limit Di Luca's losses). Both Menchov and Di Luca got time bonuses, but Menchov got 4 for second in the sprint and Di Luca 2 for third, padding Menchov's lead in the overall classification.\nThe pace in the peloton was more lax after the intermediate sprint, and two riders came clear to form another breakaway. They were caught just before the first lap of the finishing circuit in Anagni. Another four riders tried to break away for the stage win, but they were caught during the second and final lap. With just over to go, rider Philippe Gilbert attacked and got a gap, staying away for the stage win. Thomas Voeckler tried to follow, but could not reach Gilbert's slipstream, finishing 2 seconds behind him. The peloton finished 7 seconds back.\nStage 21.\n31 May 2009 — Rome, (individual time trial)\nThe 2009 Giro ended, as it had the previous year, with an individual time trial. The course was flat, though the road did twist in several places.\nThe winning time was set early on in the stage, by Cervélo TestTeam rider and reigning Lithuanian national time trial champion Ignatas Konovalovas. Konovalovas, the 79th man to leave the starthouse, was one of the last riders to take the course before it started to rain. Garmin's Bradley Wiggins started his ride not long after, and though he had the best time at the second and third intermediate time checks, he was slowed by the rain he encountered on the last part of the course as well as a stopped Bbox Bouygues Telecom team car attending to Matthieu Sprick, who had crashed.\nThe rainfall lightened almost as soon as it began, but the top riders in the general classification still faced a course made more difficult by the rain. Most of them rode conservatively, to keep their positions intact rather than aim for the stage win, but Danilo Di Luca did not. Di Luca attacked the course, riding with a high cadence from the outset. He had the best time at the first intermediate time check, but he lost energy and faded away as the course went on, finishing 45 seconds slower than the stage winner.\nGiro champion Denis Menchov was the last man to take the course. The rain started again as he and Di Luca were the last ones on course. He was on pace to win the stage, but he dramatically crashed in the final kilometer, with his bike skidding well out in front of him on the wet cobbles. Support staff from his team car gave him a very quick bike change and he was back up in moments, finishing 24 seconds back on the stage to preserve his overall victory in the Giro."

The game was played on January 11, 1959, at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles, California in front of 72,250 fans. The East scored 12 unanswered points in the fourth period to pull out a 28-21 victory.\nThe West team was led by the Baltimore Colts' Weeb Ewbank while Jim Lee Howell of the New York Giants coached the East squad.\nThe pregame build-up centered around West quarterback Bill Wade and East counterpart Norm Van Brocklin, who had spent four seasons as Los Angeles Rams teammates. After the 1957 season, with the less accomplished but younger Wade in the wings, Rams management decided not to extend Van Brocklin's contract. That prompted the 31-year-old veteran to retire briefly before he was dealt to the Philadelphia Eagles, one of the most significant developments of the off-season. The Pro Bowl marked a triumphant return to Los Angeles for the quarterback, who hooked up with Eagles end Pete Retzlaff on a 15-yard touchdown pass that gave the East a 26-21 lead with less than three minutes left in the fourth period. \nNew York Giants halfback Frank Gifford was selected as the outstanding back of the game and Chicago Bears defensive end Doug Atkins was named the outstanding lineman."

Although the honorees generally do not compete together as a unit, the term is used in U.S. team sports to refer to players who are selected by members of the national media. Walter Camp selected the first All-America team in the early days of American football in 1889. The 2009 NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans are honorary lists that includes All-American selections from the Associated Press (AP), the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA), the \"Sporting News\" (TSN), and the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) drawn from the 2008–09 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. All selectors choose at least a first and second 5-man team. The NABC, AP and TSN choose third teams, while AP also lists honorable mention selections.\nThe Consensus 2009 College Basketball All-American team is determined by aggregating the results of the four major All-American teams as determined by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Since United Press International was replaced by TSN in 1997, the four major selectors have been the aforementioned ones. AP has been a selector since 1948, NABC since 1957 and USBWA since 1960. To earn \"consensus\" status, a player must win honors based on a point system computed from the four different all-America teams. The point system consists of three points for first team, two points for second team and one point for third team. No honorable mention or fourth team or lower are used in the computation. The top five totals plus ties are first team and the next five plus ties are second team. According to this system, DeJuan Blair, Stephen Curry, Blake Griffin, Tyler Hansbrough and James Harden were first team selections and Sherron Collins, Luke Harangody, Ty Lawson, Jodie Meeks, Jeff Teague and Hasheem Thabeet were second team selections.\nAlthough the aforementioned lists are used to determine consensus honors, there are numerous other All-American lists. The ten finalists for the John Wooden Award are described as Wooden All-Americans. The ten finalists for the Lowe's Senior CLASS Award are described as Senior All-Americans. Other All-American lists include those determined by Fox Sports, and Yahoo! Sports.

        "text": "Varsity Cup is the collective name for four South African rugby union competitions involving the top rugby playing universities in the country. It was launched in 2008, with eight teams participating in the Varsity Cup competition and each university's internal champions competing in the Koshuis Rugby Championships (now known as Res Rugby). In 2011, a second tier competition called the Varsity Shield was added, increasing the number of participating universities to thirteen. A Young Guns tournament for the Under-20 side of the Varsity Cup teams was launched in 2012. A further expansion for the 2017 season saw three additional universities added to the Varsity Shield, totaling sixteen teams.\nThe Varsity Cup was dominated by during the competition's formative years, with the team winning the first three tournaments in a row. Four other sides – (NWU Pukke), , and – have also won the tournament subsequently. Those five sides, along with , participated in the Varsity Cup in each season since its conception, while , , , and participated in the Varsity Cup on occasion, but also played in the second-tier Varsity Shield competition in certain seasons. , , , and have never been able to win promotion to the Varsity Cup, spending all their time in the Varsity Shield tournament.\nCurrently the only team to have won the Varsity Cup and have been demoted to the Varsity Shield are UP Tuks, following a winless 2023 Varsity Cup campaign.\nHistory.\nThe Varsity Cup tournament was founded in 2008, with former Springbok World Cup winning captain, Francois Piennaar playing a key role in the establishment. It featured the rugby teams of eight universities, with , , , , , , and being the founding members of the competition. At the same time, the Koshuis Rugby Championships (now known as Res Rugby) was also launched; this competition featured the university residence (koshuis) teams that won the internal league for each of the Varsity Cup universities.\nIn 2011, a second tier was added below the Varsity Cup tournament, called the Varsity Shield, which featured the rugby teams of a further five universities. , , , and were the expansion teams that were added to the Varsity Shield for its first season.\nIn 2012, an Under-20 competition was also added, called the Young Guns. Each season, the same eight teams that took part in the Varsity Cup could enter their youth teams in this Young Guns competition. The name \"Varsity Rugby\" was also coined in 2012 to describe the four competitions collectively.\nFrom the inception of the tournament in 2008 until 2017, the title sponsors of the tournaments were First National Bank and Steinhoff International. For this reason, the competitions were officially known as the \"FNB Varsity Cup presented by Steinhoff International\", \"FNB Varsity Shield presented by Steinhoff International\", \"FNB Young Guns presented by Steinhoff International\" and the \"Steinhoff Koshuis Rugby Championships\". In 2018, Steinhoff withdrew as a sponsor, with FNB retaining the sponsorship rights.\nPlayer eligibility.\nThe Varsity Rugby competitions implemented rules to help ensure that the majority of the players are bona fide students of the relevant universities. In the 2012 season, Varsity Cup and Varsity Shield sides were required to have 16 full-time students in their 23-man squads. The Young Guns and Res Rugby competitions were restricted to full-time students only. In the 2013 season, Varsity Cup teams were required to have 18 full-time students in their 23-man squads. In addition, students needed to have passed at least 30% of their previous year's courses, and all players, even non-students, must have finished high school. From the 2014 season, Varsity Cup teams were required to have 20 full-time students in their 23-man squads and an entire squad consisting of full-time students were to be fielded from 2015 onwards.\nA quota system was also introduced to aid transformation in rugby. Each team had to include a certain number of players of colour in both their matchday squads and starting line-ups (for 2018, eight players of colour had to be included in the matchday squad, with five of those in the starting line-up).\nCompetition rules.\nThroughout its history, Varsity Rugby adopted experimental rules during the competitions. Since 2012, a points scoring system was adopted whereby conversions would count three points instead of the traditional two, while penalties and drop goals would count two points instead of the usual three. In 2016, a bonus points system was introduced whereby teams could get two of four bonus points for tries, based on where the try-scoring move originated on the field of play. 2017 saw this rule simplified: if a try is originated from the scoring team's own half, it receives two extra points.\nThe competition was one of the first to adopt 23-man squads to include two props, which reduced the number of uncontested scrums in matches. They also experimented with having two referees officiating in matches and a white card review system, whereby team captains can refer certain incidents to the television match official.\nIn addition, each school nominates a \"Player That Rocks\" each week, who wears pink shorts in his next game. Proceeds from the \"Player That Rocks\" initiative, along with other fund-raisers, go to a charity nominated by each university that fights domestic violence in their local area.\nTeams.\nThe following sides have participated in Varsity Rugby since the competition's inception in 2008:\nVarsity Cup.\nThe Varsity Cup is the premier Varsity Rugby competition and is contested on an annual basis between the nine foremost university rugby union teams in South Africa.

Teams are awarded four points for a win and two points for a draw. Teams may also be awarded bonus points for either scoring four tries in a game, or for losing a match by a margin of seven points or less.\nDepending on where the move starts, a team can be awarded nine points for scoring a try. If the move starts within the side's half, that leads to a try being scored without loosing possession along the way, an additional two bonus points are awarded, earning them seven points for scoring the try. If the conversion is successful, the try will be worth nine points.\nAt the end of the round robin stage, the top four teams progress to the semi-finals of the play-off stage. In the semi-finals, the team that finishes first has home advantage against the team that finishes fourth, while the team that finishes second has home advantage against the team that finishes third. The semi-final winners progress to the final, played at the venue of the higher-placed team.\nSince the introduction of the Varsity Shield tournament in 2011, a promotion/relegation system between the Varsity Cup and Varsity Shield competitions was also introduced. In 2011, the bottom Varsity Cup side played in a play-off match against the Varsity Shield champions. In 2012, promotion/relegation was changed to a bi-annual process occurring in even-numbered years. The bottom team is automatically relegated to the Varsity Shield and replaced by the champions of the Varsity Shield. In addition, the seventh-placed team will take part in a promotion/relegation play-off against the Varsity Shield runner-up.

The song was considered the 30th greatest guitar solo ever by readers of \"Guitar World\" magazine, and is one of Satriani's most prominent shred-style tracks. It is included as in the \"Guitar Virtuoso Track Pack\" for the 2007 music video game, \"\", and a downloadable single for the \"Rock Band\" game series.\nSatriani made the melody one morning he went to record. He plugged a wah-wah pedal and a Tubedriver into his 100-watt Marshall and he decided to use an Eventide 949s. Then they recorded the song and the solo in about half hour. But the Eventide broke down and they couldn't recreate the original effect. They decided to leave the original version and make another one."

Williams was capped for Wales five times over a period of four years.\nRugby career.\nWilliams was educated at St John's School, Leatherhead. He first came to prominence as a rugby player while representing Cardiff, a team he captained after Charlie Arthur. Williams was first selected for the Welsh national rugby team in a game against Scotland as part of the 1887 Home Nations Championship. Williams was one of three new Welsh caps chosen for the match, along with half-back George Bowen and full-back Hugh Hughes. The game was a one-sided affair with Scotland scoring 12 tries without reply. Despite the crushing defeat the selectors kept faith with the squad, making few changes. Williams was reselected for the next game of the Championship, played at Birkenhead, which Wales won, mainly thanks to a drop goal from Arthur 'Monkey' Gould.\nWilliams didn't play during the 1888 Championship, but played one game during the 1889 tournament. Under the captaincy of Frank Hill, Williams found himself part of another away loss to Scotland, but this time was not in the squad that faced Ireland in the last game of the Championship. Williams played two more games for the Wales team, both in the 1890 Home Nations Championship. The opening game of the tournament saw Wales lose to Scotland, but Williams' last international match was a historic first win for the Welsh team over England. Williams may well have played in more international games, but while playing for Cardiff in an encounter against Newport in November 1890, Williams sustained a serious injury which ending his rugby career. Williams had only just be given the captaincy of Cardiff, and his vice-captain, D.W. Evans was promoted to captain after Williams' retirement.\nInternational games played.\nWales"

It is now in the Prado.\nVelázquez was commissioned to paint a series of equestrian portraits for the Hall of Realms, originally a wing of the Buen Retiro Palace in Madrid. This work was meant to fill the gap between two larger equestrian portraits of the prince's parents, Philip IV and Elisabeth of France.\nArt historian Andrew Graham Dixon describes the subject as a \"little boy on this plump horse, underneath a lowering sky full of dark clouds. The child looks lost.\" According to Simona Di Nepi, the young prince's calm demeanor while seated on a rearing horse has a political significance, representing him as a confident horseman and a strong leader. His authority is symbolized by the baton he holds, the sword he wears, and the military sash on his chest.\nThe peculiar thickness of the horse's abdomen may have been calculated by Velázquez to appear normal when the portrait was viewed from below, according to E. Lafuente Ferrari.\nThe Wallace Collection also has an equestrian portrait of the prince. This is attributed to the studio of Velázquez."

        "title": "1961–62 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 1961–62 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team was Dean Smith's first as the head coach at North Carolina. The 1961–62 team finished with an 8–9 overall record, despite a young and inexperienced roster. They tied for fourth in the Atlantic Coast Conference with a 7–7 record. Their season ended with a first round loss in the ACC Tournament to South Carolina. This was Dean Smith's only losing season as a head coach at North Carolina.\nPre Season.\nAt the conclusion of the 1960–61 season, North Carolina, hired Dean Smith to replace Frank McGuire as head coach. McGuire was North Carolina Men's basketball Head Coach from 1953 to 1961, but was forced to resign by Chancellor William Aycock due to the program's placement on NCAA probation in 1960. Aycock, however, hired Smith, one of McGuire's assistants and who had been at North Carolina for two seasons already. Smith, who was only 30 at the time, was instructed by Aycock to run a clean program and represent the University well. Wins and losses were an afterthought to the Chancellor. However, in Smith's first season he was faced with a number of challenges, including a limited game schedule and the loss of two key players.\nPrior to the start of the 1961 season, the ACC experienced a point shaving scandal. Four N.C. State players were accused of altering the score of several games and one UNC player was found to be involved with a gambler. As a result of this, the Dixie Classic was abolished and William Friday, the President of the University of North Carolina system, also de-emphasized basketball by allowing only sixteen regular season games. Therefore, Smith was limited to only two games against out of conference opponents. Smith kept the two most challenging opponents on the schedule, Notre Dame and Indiana, both games which would be played in North Carolina, one in Greensboro and the other in Charlotte, respectively.\nThe 1961–62 squad should have included Ken McComb and Yogi Poteet, both projected starters, but they were ruled academically ineligible before the season started. This was a big blow for the Tar Heels since they also had to withstand the loss of two All-Americans, Doug Moe and York Larese, to graduation. As a result, Smith's first team was young and inexperienced.\nSeason summary.\nDean Smith's illustrious career started on December 2, 1961, with a victory against Virginia in Chapel Hill. The Heels and Smith rolled to their first victory, defeating the Cavaliers 80–46. UNC won their next game at Clemson by a narrow margin, 54–52. They split their next two games against out-of-conference opponents, Indiana and Notre Dame. Despite the betting odds in Notre Dame's favor, the Heels dominated the Fighting Irish, 99–80. Through January, the Heels had an accumulated a 6–2 record, but the rest of the season was not as successful. In February, they lost four straight games, all to Tobacco Road opponents (Duke, Wake Forest, and North Carolina State), before rebounding to win two of their last four games, with victories against Clemson and Maryland. Their season ended with a two-point loss to South Carolina in the ACC Tournament, which placed the Heels in a tie for fourth place with South Carolina in the final ACC standings.\nJunior guard Larry Brown and senior center Jim Hudock led the Heels to an 8–9 overall record and a 7–7 ACC record. Brown averaged 16.5 points per game, eighth in the league, and shot 79.5% from the foul line, third in the league. Hudock averaged a double double over the season, with 14.9 points per game and 10.3 rebounds per game, fourth in the league. Both were named to the All-ACC Second team. Donnie Walsh led the ACC in field-goal percentage for the season, shooting 55.9% from the field.\nDespite the challenges faced by Smith's first squad, he credits them as being one of the most hard-working teams in his 36 seasons at North Carolina. They also set North Carolina single-season record for highest field-goal percentage. However, they were the least successful, setting a record for most regular-season conference losses in a single-season (7) and their record against Tobacco Road opponents was only (1–5).\nPost Season.\nJim Hudock was drafted in the sixth round of the NBA by the Philadelphia Warriors, which ironically was coached by former North Carolina head coach, Frank McGuire. Donnie Walsh and former Tar Heel, Ken McComb were also drafted by the Warriors in the 11th and 10th round respectively. These former Tar Heels went on to enjoy limited success as players in the NBA. However, Donnie Walsh went on to enjoy various coaching stints in the NCAA and the NBA, before becoming the general manager of the Indiana Pacers for over two decades. After a brief stint as President of the New York Knicks, Walsh returned to Indiana and now serves as a consultant for the team.\nAfter Smith's first season, Adolph Rupp, Kentucky's head coach, called him requesting to set up a ten-year home-and-home series with UNC. Rupp demanded that North Carolina would play at Kentucky six times and home only four times. Despite North Carolina's disadvantage, the Heels won seven of those ten games."

        "text": "The European Table Tennis Union (ETTU) is the governing body of the sport of table tennis in Europe, and is the only authority recognised for this purpose by the International Table Tennis Federation. The ETTU deals with all matters relating to table tennis at a European level, including the development and promotion of the sport in the territories controlled by its 58 member associations, and the organisation of continental table tennis competitions, including the European Championships.\nHistory.\nFollowing their decision to make the World Table Tennis Championships a biennial event from 1957 onwards, the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) invited the separate European table tennis associations to consider holding a European Championships in the intervening, even-numbered years. At a meeting on 13 March 1957 in Stockholm during that year's World Championships, the European Table Tennis Union (ETTU) was created by the associations of Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Finland, France, Hungary, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, the USSR, Wales, West Germany and Yugoslavia. A board of seven was elected, including Frenchman Jean Belot as the first chairman, and the first European Championships took place in Budapest in 1958.\nAt a meeting in 1960, the ETTU decided to introduce a competition for European club teams, and the first European Club Cup of Champions for men took place in early 1961, with a women's event added three years later. In 1964, the ETTU assumed responsibility for youth competitions in Europe, and in 1970 the main competition for youth players was renamed the European Youth Championships. An experimental classification tournament was held in 1971, featuring the top twelve-ranked European players in a round robin-style competition. This event would go on to be held annually as the Europe Top-12.\nIn 1984, Nancy Evans retired from her role as Honorary General Secretary, having held that role for 27 years since the formation of the ETTU. In recognition of her outstanding service, she was appointed as the ETTU's first Honorary Life Member. \nBetween 1991 and 1995, the number of ETTU member associations increased dramatically from 37 to 52, largely due to applications from table tennis associations of nations that were formerly part of the USSR or Yugoslavia, in addition to the dissolution of Czechoslovakia. In 1998, the European Champions League was created for men's club teams (a women's Champions League followed in 2005), and in 1999, the ETTU entered into their first TV contract with ITTF/TMS, which enabled Champions League matches to be broadcast live on Eurosport.\nIn 2000, a decision was taken to switch the European Championships to odd-numbered years from 2003 onwards. This was in response to the ITTF's decision to start holding World Championships every year, alternating between individual events in odd-numbered years and team events in even-numbered years. From 2007, the European Championships became an annual event, and from 2016, the Championships will feature singles and doubles events in even-numbered years, with team events in odd-numbered years.\nFollowing the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the ETTU Executive Board banned Russian and Belarusian players and officials from ETTU events, in accord with the recommendations of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and in March 2022 its Russian president Igor Levitin self-suspended himself.\nMember Associations.\nThe 58 member associations of the ETTU as of September 2022, include:\nCompetitions.\nThe ETTU authorises the following competitions:\nHall of Fame.\nIn September 2015, the ETTU introduced the European Table Tennis Hall of Fame, with the aim of honouring champions, legendary players and other individuals who have made exceptional contributions to the sport of table tennis in Europe.\nInductees.\nThe following people have been inducted into the Hall of Fame:\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2019"

        "title": "Rugby union in Gibraltar",
        "text": "Rugby union is a popular sport since its introduction by British military personnel in the 19th century.\nGoverning body.\nThe Gibraltar Rugby Football Union (GRFU) has existed since the 1980s when the border with Spain was opened.\nRugby is played in Gibraltar under the auspices of the (GRFU), which exists for the development of the game on the Rock. In 2010 the GRFU appointed a Development Officer to promote the sport in middle schools and comprehensive schools.\nHistory.\nGibraltar is a British Overseas Territory, it has long had a rugby presence, and the game was probably introduced at some point during the 19th century by the military.\nAround World War II, a number of Gibraltarians were evacuated to the United Kingdom, and some learned rugby while at school there or in the British Armed Forces.\nTeams of Gibraltarians have been bolstered by the constant coming and going of the British Armed Forces, who traditionally had strong teams. During the mid-1960s, a mini league was set up - just in time, as the land border with Spain would close in 1968. This league was dominated by Gibraltar RFC.\nEven up to the mid-1980s, rugby on the Rock had a major problem, namely the lack of grass. Games were frequently played on a rocky surface, and visitors had to play tag rugby. Peter Collings, a former St Mary's University, Blackburn and Leek winger, the Headmaster of St George's School, and others like Geoff Dunn of the Bat and Bull pub, kept Rugby alive via the tag game. Peter Collings was a one-man band for some ten years. He played and refereed, organised fixtures, the disciplinary committee and the pitch allocations. Fixtures occurred most weekends at the Devils Tower pitch and at Navy No 1 on Queensway. There were also regular and well attended Rugby Sevens events that took place, with recorded coverage from GBC television on John Shepherd's sports programmes. Tag rugby had its limitations, but with regular trips to play in Tangier against Moroccan and French teams, it allowed Rugby skills to flourish and for the game to stay alive in Gibraltar during the 1970s and 1980s when travel to Spain was impractical.\nWith the opening of the border in the 1980s, the huge demand by military personnel and returning local, university students led to the creation of Gibraltar's first national league. The original teams within this competition were teams from: Navy, Air Force, Army, La Linea and two Gibraltarian teams. This later increased with the introduction of the Spanish settlements of Ceuta and Cadiz to the league. The decline in this league was down to a number of factors, such as the decline in military personnel in Gibraltar as well as the increase in the number of Spanish teams taking part in the Andalucian League (FAR) and the lack of investment in youth development locally. The land border reopened in 1985, and a number of games were played against sides from Seville and Madrid. Gibraltar RFC has now merged with one of the Super4s clubs. A number of Gibraltar-based players play for the Barbarians RFC, an Andalucia Rugby Team that play in the Andalusia Divisions.\nNational team.\nOn 5 November 2011 the Gibraltar Rugby Football Union (GRFU) fielded a national team in its first official Test Match. The fixture was against the Belgium Development Team in Brussels. The final score was Belgium XV 20 Gibraltar XV 8. Test Caps have been awarded to the Gibraltar Team.\nThe GRFU is currently going through the process of FIRA/AER (European Rugby Federation) membership. The GRFU is planning other international fixtures versus international opponents for April 2015.\nThere is also a Gibraltar National sevens team that plays regularly in tournaments, particularly in the Tangier Sevens.\nDomestic structure.\nThe lack of a decent playing pitch was long a problem, however the laying of a 3rd generation (IRB Approved) astroturf pitch has meant that Gibraltarian teams have been allowed to play their first game of XVs on their home field. The new surface was laid in April 2010 and the first game played on the pitch was against a touring side. The historic first encounter between a Spanish and Gibraltarian side (U20s) was held in September 2010, against Marbella RFC\nIn 2011 the GRFU hosted its first, locally based, international Sevens tournament called \"The Rock 7s\".\nThe Gibraltar Rugby Championship.\nGibraltar's National League is played amongst the four local clubs: DHL Europa Stormers, Inline Framing Straits Sharks, Ibex Buccaneers, Rock Scorpions. The aim of the GRC is to give Gibraltar's young, aspiring rugby players a platform from which to continue their rugby development pathway.\nGibraltar Minis.\nGibraltar Minis came into existence in 2011.\nNotable players.\nHarvey Armstrong record points scorer with 36 as of 14/10/16"

Although Guam is often considered part of Oceania, it tends to take part in Asian rugby tournaments.\nThe governing body is the Guam Rugby Football Union.\nHistory.\nRugby came to Guam via three separate streams, firstly, through the visits of British, New Zealand and Australian sailors; secondly, through the American presence, which has been there from the turn of the twentieth century; and thirdly through contact with neighbouring Pacific islands, where the game is popular. Guam has also had a long running, but sometimes tempestuous, relationship with Japan. It is not known if the forces of the Japanese occupation in WWII played the game at all there, but certainly, a large number Japanese retirees have also taken an interest in promoting the game.\nModern rugby in Guam, really dates from the 1970s, however.\nIn 1995, Guam Rugby Club was established, and they undertook tours to Saipan (Marianas), Palau, Pohnpei (Micronesia), and continental Asia.\nGuam rugby received another boost in 1999, when the island was chosen to host the\n1999 South Pacific Games (SPG); rugby sevens had only been approved as an official sport the previous year.\nIn 2003, a full-time development officer was employed, and in 2004, the game was officially introduced into schools.\nThe main rugby ground is the Wettengel Football Field.\nNational team.\nGuam takes part in the Pacific Asia region of the Asian Five Nations."

        "text": "Zoltán Meskó (; ; born 6 March 1986) is a former American football punter. He was drafted by the New England Patriots in the fifth round of the 2010 NFL Draft. He played college football at Michigan. Born in Romania, Meskó emigrated with his family to the United States and eventually settled in Ohio. There he was discovered as a potential kicker for his school's football team, the Twinsburg Tigers, and became one of the best high school football kickers in the nation, excelling as both a punter and placekicker. After earning top honors in his state, Meskó was recruited by several college football teams. He selected Michigan over several schools including Indiana, Ohio State, and USC.\nAt Michigan, Meskó did not win the starting job as a punter right away. He redshirted his freshman year and won a battle for the kicking duties on the field in 2006. Meskó then went on to excel on the field as a three-time Ray Guy Award watchlist candidate and off the field as a four-time Academic All-Conference selection. He was also recognized for his character and community service by numerous organizations. As a redshirt junior in 2008, Meskó endured the dynamics of a coaching change, became Michigan's all-time leader in punts and punting yardage, and was named to 2008 All-Big Ten first-team. As a fifth-year senior in 2009, he made a number of preseason All-American teams and achieved the highest punting average of his college career at 44.5 yards per punt. Meskó concluded his season as a 2009 All-Big Ten first-team selection by both the coaches and the media. He was also selected as a first-team Academic All-American and as a second-team All-American by several publications. He holds the career and single-season records for punts and punting yards at Michigan.\nIn the NFL, Meskó set a rookie record for net punting yard average.\nEarly years.\nMeskó, who comes from the Hungarian minority in Romania, was born in Timișoara, where he lived with his family in 1989 during the revolutions leading to the fall of communism in the former Eastern Bloc and the overthrow of dictator Nicolae Ceauşescu in Romania. The family was so immersed in the middle of the crossfire that they often dodged bullets by getting on the floor in their apartment. Zoltán was just passing through toddlerhood at the time of the revolution so he does not remember much of the details, but the family stuffed windows with pillows during the conflict.\nAs a child, Meskó had a strong interest in soccer. His childhood heroes were Gheorghe Hagi and former NBA star Gheorghe Mureșan. At the age of twelve, he immigrated with his family to Ohio and Meskó was introduced to American football when he was spotted as a potential kicker in eighth grade gym class when he knocked out a light during a kickball game. Meskó is a left-footed kicker. Meskó, who could not distinguish a football from a rugby ball when he first arrived in the states, familiarized himself with the sport of American football via the television.\nIn 2003, Meskó earned Northeast Ohio Inland All-District Division II football team honorable mention recognition from the media while performing as a punter and placekicker for Twinsburg High School. He was also selected as Western Reserve North Division First-team by the coaches as well as the All-Summit County Team kicker. \"The Plain Dealer\" listed him as their first team kicker. During the year, he was 10 for 14 on field goals, while only missing one point after touchdown attempt and averaging 36 yards per punt. He placed 80% of his kickoffs in the end zone and maintained a 4.0 grade point average. During the season, he made a 41-yard field goal and a game-winning 31-yard field goal. By the end of the season, he had started 31 consecutive games. Twinsburg qualified for the state playoffs for the first time in ten years thanks in part to a solid kicking game. During his junior year, he got his first recruiting feeler from Division III Mount Union College.\nAfter his junior season, he compiled tapes of his best punts, field goals, and kickoffs and sent them to 86 schools, hoping for ten responses. As a result of his tapes, he received 14 invitations for campus visits. He attended 16 kicking camps during his junior/senior summer. On 6 June he attended an Indiana University camp and received a full scholarship offer from the Hoosiers. Subsequently, at the University of Michigan camp, he averaged 48.5 yards per punt and a 4.6 second average hang time and was offered a scholarship. During the visit he impressed coaches when he saw fifth-year punter Adam Finley kicking balls on the roof of the Michigan indoor practice facility and joined in by kicking four in a row \"over\" the building. He was also admitted to all of the Ivy League schools.\nMeskó had a successful high school career and was ranked second among kickers in the 2005 recruiting class by Rivals.com and fourth among punters by Scout.com. He committed to Michigan on 28 June 2004, just before his senior year of high school. He committed to Michigan mainly as a punter. After committing to Michigan, he continued to be recruited by the Ohio State Buckeyes, and the USC Trojans. Over the course of his high school career, he evolved from a , freshman into a , senior.\nAs a senior, Meskó once punted a ball 70 yards in the air. As a senior punter and placekicker, Meskó was a part of the focus of opposition game plans. He averaged 44 yards per punt as a senior and dropped 16 inside the 10-yard line according to \"The Plain Dealer\" and 15 inside the 15-yard line according to the \"Ann Arbor News\". He was selected to play on 15 January 2005 U.S. Army All-American Bowl as a punter. During the game, he drew a roughing the kicker penalty and posted seven punts including kicks of 56, 48 and 47 yards and a pooch punt that he placed inside the 15-yard line. He was named an Associated Press Division II All-Ohio first-team punter. He was also selected to numerous local area All-star teams as both a punter and a placekicker. He served as both punter and kicker for the Ohio team during the 2005 Big 33 Football Classic in which he was 4 for 5 on PATs. He was recognized as the 2004 Northeast Inland All-District Division II first team punter by the media. He was selected as the All-\"Akron Beacon Journal\" team placekicker and the all-Summit County punter. The Akron area coaches selected him as both the punter and kicker for the All-Western Reserve Conference, North Division first-team. He was selected to the combined Summit-Medina-Portage Counties All-Area team as the first team punter by \"The Plain Dealer\". He was the first team punter for \"The Plain Dealer\" All-area team. Although Meskó's high school required 40 hours of community service, he performed over 300 hours.\nCollege career.\nLloyd Carr era.\nPrior to the 2005 season, it appeared that the Michigan Wolverines would use three kickers: Garrett Rivas for field goals and extra points, Ross Ryan for kickoffs and Meskó for punting, but redshirt junior Ryan beat out Meskó and junior Mark Spencer for the punting duties. Meskó redshirted as a freshman at Michigan in 2005, while Ryan ranked last in the Big Ten for the 2005 season with a 38.3 yard average.\nEntering the 2006 season for Michigan, head coach Lloyd Carr could not decide between Meskó and Ryan. In the team's opening game against Vanderbilt, Meskó punted three times and Ryan once. The two shared the kicking duties for the first four games with Meskó recording 12 punts and Ryan recording 9. In the fifth game of the season, against the Minnesota Golden Gophers for the Little Brown Jug, Meskó handled all of the punting duties. Ryan punted only five more times the rest of the season. Meskó finished the season fourth in the Big Ten and 38th in the nation in punting average. Meskó earned Academic All-Big Ten Conference recognition for earning a letter while maintaining a 3.0+ average during the fall.\nPrior to the 2007 season, Meskó adjusted his kicking technique to a straight motion instead of a cross-over like National Football League punters. He was a preseason Ray Guy Award watchlist nominee. After Rivas graduated, the 2007 Michigan Wolverines football team had a battle for the placekicking duties for the 2007 season between redshirt freshman Bryan Wright and two walk-ons. When the team had two fourth quarter field goal attempts blocked during their season-opening 34–32 loss to the two-time defending FCS champion Appalachian State Mountaineers, Meskó was an uninvolved third stringer but handled punting duties. Meskó finished the season fifth in the Big Ten in punting average, and was again Academic All-Conference.\nRich Rodriguez era.\nWhen Rich Rodriguez arrived to replace the retired Carr prior to the 2008 season, he announced the Wolverines would be using a new punting formation along with the spread offense. Instead of using two gunners, the team switched to using six, and Meskó switched to rolling out and using directional kicks. The plan called for a mixture of employing traditional pocket punts and roll out for rugby style ones. Meskó said the changes to the team were so drastic under Rodriguez that he felt like he had transferred. On all seven of his punts in the opening game against Utah, Meskó rolled out to his left before punting. The new punt scheme was part of the option offense and could have resulted in a fake punt. In Michigan's third game against Notre Dame on 13 September, Meskó executed an option run for 13 yards and a first down. Meskó also executed a seven-yard option run for a first down against Minnesota on 8 November in the Little Brown Jug game. Meskó had a couple of punts blocked during the season, and one was returned for a touchdown during the Michigan – Ohio State game. During the season, Meskó served as K.C. Lopata's holder on placekicks. Meskó repeated a Guy Award watchlist candidate in 2008. After the list was narrowed from fifty to ten, Meskó was a semifinalist for the award. Meskó led the Big Ten in punting average and finished twentieth in the nation. He was named to the Big Ten All Conference First-Team in 2008. He was recognized by Phil Steele as a fourth team All-American for 2008. Meskó was Academic All-Conference for a third time. At the conclusion of the 2008–09 academic year, the inaugural class of Big Ten Distinguished Scholars was recognized for having attained a 3.7 GPA for the academic year while earning varsity letters, and Meskó was among the honorees.\nAs a senior, Meskó entered the 2009 NCAA Division I FBS football season opener with the most career starts (38) on the 2009 Michigan Wolverines football team. He served as the first special teams performer to be captain in the 130-year history of Michigan football. In 2009, Meskó was again a Guy Award watchlist candidate for the Wolverines. He was also a pre-season \"Playboy\" All-American and NationalChamps.net first-team All-American. On 11 October 2009, he was named Big Ten Conference special teams player of the week for averaging 53.8 yards on five punts at Iowa. He was a 2009 Allstate Good Works Team honoree for his outstanding civic contributions to the local community and a 2009 Lowe's Senior Class Award Finalist for classroom, community, character and competition excellence. At the midpoint in the Wolverines' Big Ten schedule, Meskó ranked fifth in the nation and first in the Big Ten in punting average. In November, Meskó was named one of 10 semifinalists for the Ray Guy Award and one of 12 finalists for the Wuerffel Trophy. In eight conference games Meskó averaged 45.2 yards/punt, which was the first time a Michigan punter led the Big Ten in Conference game punting average since Paul Staroba in 1970. Although the team played twelve games, Meskó only accumulated stats in eleven since the team did not punt a single time in its 17 October 63–6 victory against the . He was selected by both the coaches and the media to the first-team All-Big Ten Conference team. Meskó was named one of three finalists for the Ray Guy Award along with Drew Butler and Chaz Henry. Meskó was honored as a fall term of the 2009-10 Academic All-Conference selection. He was also one of fifteen Football Bowl Subdivision athletes and six Big Ten athletes selected as a first-team Academic All-American. He was the second-team All-American punter selection by the Walter Camp Football Foundation, the Associated Press, Scout.com, and Rivals.com. He was an honorable mention All-American by \"Sports Illustrated\", \"Pro Football Weekly\", and \"College Football News\". He finished the season ranked eighth in the nation and first in the Big Ten in punting average. On 31 December 2009, he was one of 22 players recognized as a member of the Allstate AFCA Good Works Team, which rewards public service and volunteer work.\nMeskó is Michigan's career leader in punts and punting yardage and is second only to Monte Robbins in punting average. He is also the Michigan single-season punts (80) and punting yards (3436) record holder. His 44.46 was a school single-season record that lasted three years until Will Hagerup surpassed it. Meskó ranks ninth all-time in career punts and seventh in punting yardage in Big Ten Conference history. At the close of his collegiate career, Meskó was rated the number one punter prospect for the 2010 NFL draft by Scouts.com.\nProfessional career.\nMeskó ranked second among all specialists at the NFL Combine with 16 repetitions on the bench press.\nNew England Patriots.\n2010 to 2012.\nMeskó was drafted by the New England Patriots in the fifth round (150th overall) of the 2010 NFL Draft. He was the first punter or placekicker drafted and the second Wolverine drafted (Brandon Graham was the first) in the 2010 draft. He signed a four-year contract on 16 June 2010.\nIn Week 6 of his rookie season, Meskó set a season-long record with a 65-yard punt in overtime that gave the Baltimore Ravens the ball at their own 19-yard line. The Ravens failed to gain a first down and punted back to the Patriots, who scored to win the game on the ensuing drive.\nThe 2010 Patriots were the seventh-highest scoring team in NFL history; as a result, Meskó punted just 58 times, 26th in the league. Of those punts, 19 were downed inside the 20, while 5 were touchbacks. Meskó finished his rookie season with a gross punting average of 43.2 yards, and net average of 38.4 yards, the highest net average for a rookie in NFL history. During the 2011 NFL lockout, Meskó, a finance and marketing major in college, interned as a private equity analyst with Graham Partners in Philadelphia. Meskó also served as the Patriots' holder.\nAt the end of the 2011 season, Meskó and the Patriots appeared in Super Bowl XLVI. He had three punts for 123 net yards (41.0 average), but the Patriots lost 21–17 to the New York Giants.\n2013 preseason.\nMeskó was fighting for the punter position with undrafted rookie Ryan Allen. Meskó did not survive the final cuts. Bleacher Report stated that the reason for the cut was that if Meskó had stayed for his fourth year, he would have made $1.3 million, while Allen would only cost $405,000.\nPittsburgh Steelers.\nOn 2 September 2013, Meskó was signed to the Pittsburgh Steelers active roster. Meskó had grown up a Steelers fan although he lived in Cleveland and wore a Steelers jacket during his youth. Meskó was released from the Steelers on 29 October 2013. Meskó's punting had been statistically poor and he had some troubles on specific plays that upset Steelers coach Mike Tomlin. Meskó was replaced by Mat McBriar.\nCincinnati Bengals.\nOn 31 December 2013, after a punt by Shawn Powell went only 10 yards, Meskó was signed by the Cincinnati Bengals. His contract was not renewed at the end of the season, becoming a free agent. He had workouts with the New York Jets and Washington Redskins in early 2014, but was not signed.\nPersonal life.\nMeskó is of Hungarian descent. In the mid-1990s, his parents, Mihály and Erzsébet Meskó, were highly educated engineers in Romania. The family supplemented its income selling homemade clothes in the market. His father was also a professional nine-pin bowler. On 8 May 1997, when Zoltán was 11, his family moved from his native Romania after Mihály Meskó won a United States Permanent Resident Card (green card) in the Diversity Immigrant Visa lottery for the single child family to move to the United States. The Meskós now have jobs that pay well. The family spent the first year and half in New York City before moving to Ohio for better jobs. Zoltán speaks Hungarian, Romanian, German and English and is conversant in Spanish. He learned to speak English by watching television. He was schooled at a German school in Timișoara, which was then Romania's second-largest city. His parents taught him Hungarian and he spoke Romanian with his friends.\nMeskó completed a Bachelor of Business Administration in finance and marketing from the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business in 2009. He completed a master's degree in sports management from the University of Michigan School of Kinesiology in April 2010. Meskó is Roman Catholic and wears a medallion of his patron saint, St. Anthony of Padua. In June 2013, he appeared on Barstool Sport's Bro Show, punting to the bloggers.\nMeskó married his wife Haley in 2014.\nAfter retiring from the NFL, Meskó started Exero Labs with business partner Ben Rizzo, a company that aims to create devices attached to football helmets to make the game safer. They were featured on the NFL's technology startup competition \"1st and Future\" the weekend of Super Bowl LII."

        "title": "UCF Knights women's basketball",
        "text": "The UCF Knights women's basketball team represents the University of Central Florida located in Orlando, Florida in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I and the Big 12 Conference. The Knights play their home games at Addition Financial Arena located on the university's main campus. Sytia Messer was named head coach on April 3, 2022.\nThe Knights have participated in the NCAA/AIAW Tournament eight times, five as a Division I team and three times as a Division II program. The Knights reached the Elite Eight in 1982, and won the 1980 AIAW Division-II Florida State Championship, before losing their first game in the national tournament.\nHistory.\nUCF first competed in AIAW during the 1977–78 season as a Division II team. During the 1979–80 season, the Knights had a record of 23–9 and won the AIAW D–II Small College Florida State Championship. Although the college was a member of the Sunshine State Conference, it did not organize a women's basketball team within the conference until 1981. They moved up to AIAW Division I in 1981–82, the last year of AIAW, and advanced to the Division I Tournament quarterfinals.\nThey moved to the NCAA during the 1982–83 season, initially in Division II, along with the rest of the Sunshine State Conference. They were promoted to Division I during 1984–85 season. During the three years the team played in the Sunshine State Conference, the Knights won both the conference regular season title and the tournament title every year. During their first year in NCAA Division I, they had a 20–10 record, but were not given a tournament bid since they were a non-conference team that year.\nThe team would struggle in Division I New South Women's Athletic Conference (NSWAC) until 1990. After playing in the American South Conference in 1990–91 season, which merged into the Sun Belt Conference soon after, the team landed in the Trans-American Athletic Conference (TAAC) during 1992–93 season. In 1995–96 season, the Knights surprised everybody by winning the TAAC Tournament, and making their first appearance in the NCAA women's basketball tournament (though they were eliminated in the first round).\nIn 1996–97 season, UCF hired Lynn Bria as their women's basketball head coach, and the team began to see more success. During the 1998–99 season, the Knights finally won the TAAC regular season title with a 13–3 record and the Conference tournament, allowing the team to enter the NCAA Tournament a second time. After their NCAA Tournament ouster, Bria was replaced as head coach by Gail Striegler.\nAfter two years of struggling, Striegler put together a string of four winning seasons in what had become the Atlantic Sun Conference in the 2001–02 season. The team won the Atlantic Sun regular season title in 2002–03 and 2004–05, but failed to win the Conference tournament, and thus never played in the NCAA Tournament during those years.\nIn 2005–06, the Knights moved to Conference USA, and the women's basketball team struggled mightily, resulting in Striegler being fired and replaced by Joi Williams. The team continued to struggle in 2007–08 with a 10–20 record and a last place showing in the conference. But after a 2–11 start in 2008–09, they surprised C-USA by dominating, tying with four other teams with the second-best in-conference record of 11–5 (falling to the fifth seed due to their out-of-conference woes). In the Conference USA Tournament, they beat Rice (66–64), Houston (79–66) and SMU (62–51) in order to face Southern Miss in the Championship game. After playing to a 52–52 tie in regulation, the Knights dominated the overtime period, 13–2, to win the game, 65–54. It was UCF's first C-USA title, allowing the team to enter the NCAA Tournament a third time. Ranked No. 14 in the 2009 NCAA tournament, they surprised the No. 3 North Carolina Tar Heels, but ultimately lost 85–80.\nAfter floundering during the 2009–10 season (10–15, 7–9), the Knights dominated the conference schedule in 2010–11 (22–10, 12–4), finishing 2nd in the regular season and winning their second C-USA title along with their fourth NCAA tournament appearance. The seasons afterwards, however, would bring struggles for the program, especially with the transition into the American Athletic Conference (The American) in 2013. After a 7–23 2015–16 season, Joi Williams was dismissed.\nUCF would go on to hire Albany head coach Katie Abrahamson-Henderson. In her first year in 2016–17, Coach Abe would instantly improve the team with a 21–12 record as well as the program's first WNIT appearance where they would advance to the second round. In the 2018–19 season, UCF would go 26–7 and finish second place in the conference, only losing to UConn in the Tournament Championship. The Knights would have their first NCAA Tournament bid since 2010–11 that year, and their fifth overall. In 2020–21, UCF would finish second place in the conference, but would fall short to their rivals, USF. That season, UCF would make their sixth NCAA appearance.\nThe 2021–22 season would be record-breaking for UCF, with the Knights going 26–4 and being ranked in both polls for the first time in school history. UCF would also win their first regular season championship since 2004–05. In the AAC Tournament, UCF would beat Tulsa (69–54) and dominate SMU (61–28) before facing their rival, USF, in a championship rematch from the season before. After being down for 3 quarters, UCF would take over in the 4th quarter, at one point going on a 12–1 run, and win their first AAC Tournament title (53–45) as well as their first conference tournament victory since 2010–11, clinching a 7th NCAA Tournament appearance. Furthermore, in the NCAA Tournament, UCF would advance to the second round for the first time in school history with a 69–52 victory over Florida and fell just short to UConn, losing 52–47.\nOn March 26, 2022, Coach Abe left the Knights to take the head coach position at her alma mater, Georgia. She was replaced by Sytia Messer, the associate head coach at LSU and previously a head coach at Tennessee Tech. Messer won the national championship in 2019 as an assistant with Baylor, and made the Final Four as a player with Arkansas in 1998.\nPostseason.\nNCAA Division II tournament results.\nThe Knights, then known as the Golden Knights, made two appearances in the NCAA Division II women's basketball tournament. They had a combined record of 0–2.\nTraditions.\nKnightmare.\nWhen the basketball program moved into the New UCF Arena in the fall of 2007, the facility could hold more students than ever before. To go along with its new facility and its new commitment to basketball, a new student section known as the \"Knightmare\" was formed. The \"Knightmare\" debuted on January 11, 2008 during a men's basketball game. Adorned in their black Knightmare shirts, the students completely filled the bleachered section behind the basket and the overflow section in the upper deck.\nOne of UCF's most unusual basketball traditions is its free throw chant. Started by students in the 1990s, UCF fans started by holding their right arms with clenched fists almost straight up when a UCF player shoots a free throw. When the basketball is made, the fans would stomp their right foot twice, clap their hands twice, make a shooting motion with their right hand while chanting \"woosh.\" In recent years, after the appropriately named Stomp Stomp, Clap Clap, Woosh chant, fans would chant U-C-F afterwards, making a U, a C, and an F over their heads. During the 2010–2011 season, a group of students started a new tradition; if a UCF player makes all of his/her free throws, the chant would be followed by \"ballin\".\nThere is also another tradition where if the opponent goes for a shot and gets an \"air ball,\" students would chant the entire game for that one player. It's been shown as an effective way to get into the player's mind."

Organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC), the 2009 Women's Cricket World Cup, held in Australia, was the ninth edition of the competition. England won the tournament for the second time, defeating New Zealand by four wickets in the final.\nEach team selected a squad of up to 15 players, and any changes to that squad due to illness or injury had to be requested in writing and approved by the ICC's Event Technical Committee. Three such replacements were made to the squads, with South Africa, Sri Lanka and the West Indies making a change. England entered the tournament with the top-ranked players in both the ICC's batting and bowling rankings, Claire Taylor and Isa Guha respectively, but Australia were commonly listed in the press as favourites to win the tournament. Taylor finished the tournament as the leading run-scorer, accumulating 324 runs, and her England teammate Laura Marsh was the most prolific wicket-taker, claiming 16 wickets.\nAt the conclusion of the tournament, an ICC panel selected their team of the tournament. The player of the tournament, England's Claire Taylor, was one of five English players, along with Katherine Brunt, Marsh, Sarah Taylor, and Charlotte Edwards, the last of whom was chosen as the team's captain. Finalists New Zealand had two representatives—Suzie Bates and Kate Pulford, and in addition, Sophie Devine was selected as the twelfth player. Three Indians were included—Mithali Raj, Amita Sharma and Priyanka Roy—as was Shelley Nitschke of Australia."

        "text": "The 1940 World Snooker Championship was a professional snooker tournament held at Thurston's Hall in London, England from 22 February to 20 March 1940. It was the fourteenth edition of the World Snooker Championship. Joe Davis defeated his younger brother Fred Davis by 37 to 36 in the final, to retain the title that he had held since the tournament's inception in 1927. Joe Davis compiled a century break in the penultimate frame to win the match at 37–35 before a was played out. The only other century break of the tournament was 101 by Fred Davis earlier in the final.\nThere were nine participants. Herbert Holt and Conrad Stanbury played a qualifying match, which Holt won to join the other seven players in the competition proper. Holt was eliminated in the first round by Walter Donaldson. This was the last World Championship to be held until the end of World War II, the next edition being held in 1946.\nBackground.\nThe World Snooker Championship is a professional tournament and the official world championship of the game of snooker. The sport was developed in the late 19th century by British Army soldiers stationed in India. Professional English billiards player and billiard hall manager Joe Davis noticed the increasing popularity of snooker compared to billiards in the 1920s, and with Birmingham-based billiards equipment manager Bill Camkin, persuaded the Billiards Association and Control Council (BACC) to recognise an official professional snooker championship in the 1926–27 season. In 1927, the final of the first professional snooker championship was held at Camkin's Hall; Davis won the tournament by beating Tom Dennis in the final. The annual competition was not titled the World Championship until the 1935 tournament, but the 1927 tournament is now referred to as the first World Snooker Championship. Davis also won the title every year from 1928 to 1939.\nThere were nine entries for the championship. There were eight places in the competition proper, with a qualifying match scheduled between Herbert Holt and Conrad Stanbury to determine which of them would join the other seven participants in the main draw.\nSummary.\nFirst round (quarter-finals).\nThe first round was held as the best of 31 . Holt, who joined the main draw by defeating Stanbury in the qualifying round, met Walter Donaldson in the first match of the competition proper from 22 to 24 February. Donaldson claimed the first four and led 6–4 overnight. Donaldson won eight frames on the second day to lead 14–6, two frames from victory, and took the first two frames on the final day to win 16–6. He eventually won 10 of the 11 frames played, for a final score of 24–7. All 11 frames on the final day were completed in 2 hours and 15 minutes. \"The Glasgow Herald\" reported that Donaldson \"created what must be a world record for fast scoring\".\nJoe Davis and Alec Brown played in the second quarter-final from 26 to 28 February. Brown had recently won the Daily Mail Gold Cup beating Davis 39–22 in October 1939. However, in that match he received a start of 25 in each frame. Brown took a 2–1 lead but Davis led 7–3 after the first day. Davis extended his lead to 10–3 but at the end of the second day Brown had reduced Davis's lead to 12–8. By winning the last frame of the final afternoon , Davis achieved a decisive 16–9 lead. The final score was 20–11.\nFrom 29 February to 2 March, Fred Davis faced Sydney Lee in the third quarter-final. On the first day Lee won frame 4 but Davis led 9–1. The players each won five frames on the second day so Davis led 14–6. Davis took the first two frames on the third day to win the match 16–6. The final score was 20–11, with Davis making a of 88 in the evening session.\nThe last quarter-final was between Sidney Smith, a tournament finalist in the two preceding years, and Tom Newman, from 4 to 6 March.

The final score was 22–9.\nSemi-finals.\nBoth Semi-finals were also played as the best of 31 frames, with the first taking place from 7 to 9 March. Joe Davis and Donaldson met in the first semi-final. Davis won the first three frames but Donaldson levelled the match at 5–5 at the end of the first day. Davis won 7 frames on the second day to lead 12–8. On the final day Donaldson won the first frame but Davis won the next four to win the match 16–9. Davis then extended his winning run to 10 frames to leave a final score of 22–9.\nFrom 11 to 13 March, the second semi-final, between Fred Davis and Sidney Smith, was played. Smith established a 7–2 lead, before Davis won the last frame of the day to reduce the gap to four frames. Davis won seven frames on the second day to level the match at 10–10 and then added three of the five frames on the final afternoon to lead 13–12. Winning the first two frames in the concluding evening session gave him a 15–12 lead and, although Smith won the following frame, Davis took the match 16–13. The final score was 17–14.\nFinal.\nBrothers Joe and Fred Davis met in the final from 14 to 20 March (with no play on 17 March, a Sunday). The match was played as the best of 73 frames. Joe took an 8–4 lead on the first day by winning both sessions 4–2. Joe led 14–10 after the second day. Fred won the first 10 frames on the third day and led 21–15 at the end of the day. Including the last frame on the second day, Fred had won 11 frames in succession. Joe won 9 frames on the fourth day to level the match at 24–24. The fifth afternoon session was shared. Fred made a 101 break in frame 50, including 13 , 11 , a and a . It was the first century break of the tournament. Joe won four frames in the evening to lead 31–29. On the final day Joe won the first three frames to lead 34–29 but Fred won the next four frames. When Joe won frame 70, he took a 36–34 lead but Fred won the next. In frame 72 Fred scored the first 12 points but Joe then made a 101 break to take a winning 37–35 lead. Joe got his century by the blue, leaving just the pink and black remaining. The spectators cheered for nearly a minute when Joe made his century. Fred won the last frame, giving a final score of 37–36. Snooker historian Clive Everton noted that this was the closest that Davis had ever come to defeat in the history of the championship. It was the last time that the pair met in the tournament. Joe Davis retired from the competition after winning for the fifteenth time when the tournament was next held, which was in 1946, after a break due to World War II.\nIn his book \"Talking Snooker\", Fred Davis recalled the 1940 final \"The cynics were not slow to suggest that Joe had 'taken it easy' with his younger brother, but those on the inside knew how wrong they were.\" \"The Billiard Player\" magazine's correspondent wrote that there was no incentive for Joe Davis not to try to win every frame, as \"the hall would be packed just the same\" even if he had a commanding lead, and attributed the closeness of the result to the younger brother playing the best snooker of his career whilst the defending champion was not consistently at his best. In Joe Davis's autobiography, he claimed that he had always tried his hardest when playing his brother, and commented that 1940 was the \"toughest\" of all his championship finals.\nMain draw.\nMatch results are shown below. Winning players and scores are denoted in bold text.\nQualifying.\nHerbert Holt and Conrad Stanbury met at Thurston's Hall for their qualifying match, played from 19 to 21 February. Holt led 6–4 after the first day and 13–7 after day two. Although he lost the first frame on the final day, he took the next three to secure a winning 16–8 lead. Stanbury won five of the seven for a final score of 18–13.\nCentury breaks.\nThere were two century breaks during the tournament, both during the final."

        "text": "The 1946 World Snooker Championship was a professional snooker tournament held from 4 February to 18 May 1946. Joe Davis won the title by defeating Horace Lindrum by 78 to 67 in the final, although the winning margin was reached at 73–62. It was Davis's fifteenth championship win, maintaining his unbeaten record in the tournament since its first edition in 1927. The highest of the event was 136, a new championship record, compiled by Davis in the final.\nThe competition was organised by the Billiards Association and Control Council. The final was held at the Royal Horticultural Hall in London, England, from 6 to 18 May. Other matches took place at various venues in the UK. The qualifying competition (known as the \"B Section\") took place from 7 January to 16 February, and the quarter-finals and semi-finals were staged from 4 February to 9 March. Davis retired from the competition following his victory.\nBackground.\nThe World Snooker Championship is a professional tournament and the official world championship of the game of snooker. The sport was developed in the late 19th century by British Army soldiers stationed in India. Professional English billiards player and billiard hall manager Joe Davis noticed the increasing popularity of snooker compared to billiards in the 1920s, and with Birmingham-based billiards equipment manager Bill Camkin, persuaded the Billiards Association and Control Council (BACC) to recognise an official professional snooker championship in the 1926–27 season. In 1927, the final of the first professional snooker championship was held at Camkin's Hall; Davis won the tournament by beating Tom Dennis in the final. The annual competition was not titled the World Championship until the 1935 tournament, but the 1927 tournament is now referred to as the first World Snooker Championship. Davis had also won the title every year from 1928 to 1940, after which the tournament was not held again until 1946 due to World War II.\nThe BACC's official magazine, \"The Billiard Player\", reported in August 1945 that \"It is expected by the beginning of next year that the majority of professional players will be free from their [military] Service duties, and it should therefore be possible to run the official championships about March.\" In the October 1945 issue, it was announced that entries for the competition would close at noon on 31 October, with a stake fee of £20 required. All matches except the final were to be of 31 , played across three days, at venues arranged by the players involved. The final would be played over 73 frames at a location determined by the BACC, expected to last one week, but with the organisers having the option to extend the duration to two weeks.\nSummary.\nThe Championship attracted a total of 14 entries; a total of 13 were originally announced, with Fred Lawrence being added a few days later. Entries were divided into a qualifying group (Section B), the winner joining seven others in the main draw (Section A).\nQuarter-finals.\nJoe Davis and Walter Donaldson met in Wellington, Shropshire from 4 to 6 February 1946. Davis led 6–4 and 12–8 after the first two days. He took a winning lead during the final afternoon at 16–9. The final score was 21–10. Davis made a of 129 in frame 29. From 18 to 20 February, Stanley Newman, the winner of the qualifying competition, faced Sydney Lee at the Clifton Hotel in Blackpool. Newman led 6–4 and 12–8 after the first two days. He won four of the five frames on the final afternoon session to lead 16–9. The final score was 19–12.\nFred Davis played Alec Brown from 7 to 9 March, in the second match to be played at the Clifton Hotel. Davis won the first nine frames and led 9–1 overnight. He built a 15–5 lead after two days, to require only one further frame for victory. Davis won frame 21 to win the match 16–5. The final score was 24–7. Horace Lindrum defeated Herbert Holt 17–14 in the last quarter-final match, played in Streatham, London, from 4 to 6 March. Lindrum was 6–4 in front after the first day, and won four consecutive frames to go from 6–6 to 10–6, finishing the second day at 11–9.\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-finals were held in Oldham. Joe Davis met Newman in the first match, from 4 to 6 March. Davis led 6–4 after the first day, making a break of 106 in the eighth frame. He extended his lead to 13–7 after the second day and won the match 21–10.\nFrom 7 to 9 March, Lindrum and Fred Davis played in the second semi-final. Lindrum took a 7–3 lead on the first day. Davis reduced his deficit to two frames on the next day, leaving Lindrum 11–9 ahead. Davis levelled the match at 11–11 but Lindrum won the next three frames to lead 14–11. In the evening session Lindrum took two of the first three frames to achieve a winning 16–12 lead. The final score was 17–14.\nFinal.\nThe final was played from 6 to 18 May 1946 at the Horticultural Hall, London. There were two sessions, starting at 3:00 pm and 7:30 pm, scheduled each day (except on 12 May when there was no play). The referee was T. Bradlaugh Leng, and Joyce Gardner was the compere. There were 1,250 spectator tickets available for each session, at prices ranging from 5 shillings to 1 guineas. Davis's preparations for the match included physical exercises under the supervision of his wife June Malo, a former army physical training instructor, and he stopped driving as he felt it affected his hands' steadiness. He told the \"Daily Mirror\" that \"All that bending down to the table can play hell with your system if you are not prepared for it.\"\nAfter the first day of the final Joe Davis led Lindrum 7–5. Lindrum, however, claimed the first three frames of the third session to lead 8–7, before Davis responded by winning the last three frames and regaining the lead at 10–8, and finishing the day leading 14–10. Lindrum reduced his deficit to two frames at the end of the third day, and trailed only 17–19. Davis however regained the four frame lead a day later at 26–22, and maintained it at the end of the fifth day by 32–28. Davis than won seven of the next twelve frames to gain a six frame lead at 39–33, and maintained it over the next three days leading 45–39, 51–45 and 57–51, before gaining a 10 frame advantage at 65–55. He maintained this lead at the end of the penultimate day, and at 71–61 only needed two frames to retain the title. Davis then won 78–67, although the winning margin was already reached at 73–62, Davis made an unprecedented six century breaks in the final, including championship records of 133 and 136. He only needed 7 minutes, 15 seconds for the record 133 break, which was also Davis' 200th century break. Davis won one frame 145–0, which at the time was the highest aggregate score ever recorded in one frame. Over the tournament Davis made ten century breaks.\nDavis said after the match that he was relieved that the contest had finished, and that \"It has been a great strain. Over the match I have lost five pounds in weight.\" Lindrum wrote in 1974 that although he had been disappointed to lose the final, \"I still enjoyed it and I had been a part of what I still consider to be the greatest final in the history of the game.\"\nTickets for the final sold well, with full audience attendances at sessions, and gate receipts for the match totalled £, (). Davis and Lindrum received £1,800 and £550 respectively in prize money. Lindrum also received the championship table and all the equipment. Live radio broadcasts were transmitted in the UK and in Australia, with commentary from Gardner and Willie Smith. During one of the Australian programmes, Gardner was the commentator when Davis made the first century break to be broadcast live.\nThis was the 15th and last championship victory for Davis, who having achieved his ambition to hold the title for 20 years and retire undefeated, announced that he would not participate in future world championships.\nMain draw.\nMatch results are shown below. Winning players and scores are denoted in bold text.\nQualifying.\nKingsley Kennerley met Fred Lawrence from 7 to 9 January at the Delicia Stadium, Gosta Green. The opening day's play was littered with shots according to David Williams in the \"Daily Herald\", who wrote that the match was watched by \"a handful of people in a freezing disused cinema\". Kennerley secured a winning margin at 16–6. Stanley Newman and Willie Leigh played at the St John Ambulance Hallin Newquay, Cornwall from 10 to 12 January, with Newman winning in the . Conrad Stanbury played John Barrie from 28 to 30 January in Woolwich, London.\nIn the semi-finals of the qualifying, Tom Reece retired with the score at 2–8 after the first day, 17 January, of his match at Wellington, Shropshire with Kennerley, and Newman defeated Stanbury 17–14 in their match held from 11 to 13 February in Tooting, London. The final between Newman and Kennerley was played from 14 to 16 February in Tooting. Newman won all eleven frames played on the third day, and achieved a winning margin at 16–10 to qualify for the main draw.\nMatch results are shown below.

        "text": "The 1947 World Snooker Championship was a professional snooker tournament that took place from 20 January to 25 October 1947. The final was held at the Leicester Square Hall in London, England, from 13 to 25 October. The semi-finals were completed in March, but the final was delayed due to building works at the venue, which had been bombed in October 1940. Walter Donaldson won the title by defeating Fred Davis by 82 to 63 in the final, although he reached the winning margin earlier, at 73–49. Davis made the highest break of the tournament with a 135 clearance in frame 86 of the final.\nThe 1947 event was the first to be played since the retirement of Joe Davis who had won all 15 of the previous Championships since it was inaugurated in 1927. Davis had announced in October 1946 that he would no longer play in the competition. A qualifying competition for thirteen entrants at Burroughes Hall in London from 2 January to 8 February 1947 was won by Albert Brown, who then joined seven other players in the main competition. The quarter-finals and semi-finals took place from 20 January to 15 March at various venues in England.\nBackground.\nThe World Snooker Championship is a professional tournament and the official world championship of the game of snooker.

Davis had also won the title every year from 1928 to 1940, after which the tournament was not held again until 1946 due to World War II. The World Championship was the first to be played since the retirement from the competition of Joe Davis who had won all 15 of the previous Championships. He had announced in October 1946 that he would no longer play in the World Championship.\nFormat.\nThe closing date for entries for the 1947 championship was 23 November 1946. The entry fee was five guineas per player, with five per cent of gate receipts to be paid to the BACC. This was reduced to two guineas, and the same percentage of gate receipts, after representations to the BACC by the Professional Billiard Players Association. Twenty players entered; thirteen of them were placed in \"Section B\", which was to produce one qualifier to join the other seven players in \"Section A\", the main competition. The \"Section B\" matches were held at Burroughes Hall in London from 2 January to 8 February 1947, all played across 35 frames. The quarter finals and semi finals were played at different venues in England, across 71 frames, except for two of the quarter-finals which were across 73 frames. The final was played over 145 frames from 13 to 25 October 1947 at Leicester Square Hall.\nTournament summary.\nQuarter-finals and semi-finals.\nFred Davis took a 6–0 lead in the first session of his match against Clark McConachy. McConachy only won the 15th frame during the first three sessions, and Davis led 17–1 as they started the fourth session, during which McConachy took the 22nd fame. Davis finished the second day 22–2 ahead. Each player won three frames in the fifth session; McConachy recorded an 85 break, the highest of the match to that point. Davis secured his progress to the next round at 37–7, with two days of the match still remaining. During the , McConachy compiled a break of 132; the final score was 53–20 to Davis. Sidney Smith achieved a 106 break in the fifth session against Alec Brown; by taking five of that sessions six frames, Smith led 23–7, and he increased his advantage to 27–9 during the following session. After reaching a winning margin at 37–22, Smith won 44–29 following dead frames.\nAfter Horace Lindrum built a 5–1 lead in their first session, Albert Brown won four successive frames in the next session and finished the first day at 5–7. Brown took the lead by adding the first three frames of the third session, but was four frames behind at 10–14 by the close of the second day's play. The eventual score was 39–34 to Lindrum. Donaldson practised intensively in preparation for the Championship, using a billiard table in a neighbour's attic. He won both of the first two sessions by a 4–2 margin against Stanley Newman, and despite losing both sessions on the third day, was 21–15 ahead afterwards. From 25–19 ahead, he took the next eight frames, and went on to win 46–25.\nIn the first semi-final, Davis held a 9–3 lead against Smith. During the sixth session, Davis made a century break, which was followed in the next frame by an 83 break from Smith. Davis won 39–32 after securing a win at 36–28. Donaldson whitewashed Lindrum 6–0 in their first session. In the next session, each player won three frames. On day three, Donaldson moved ten frames ahead at 20–10, but Lindrum reduced the margin to six frames, at 20–15, by the end of the day. Going into the last day, Donaldson was 32–28 up; he secured a place in the final at 36–30. With dead frames, the final score was 39–32.\nFinal.\nThe final, at Leicester Square Hall, was postponed for several weeks due to building works. The hall, previously known as Thurston's Hall, had been bombed during The Blitz, in October 1940, and only re-opened on 3 October 1947. Meanwhile, Donaldson continued practising. The match was played over 145 frames. Donaldson led Davis 4–2 and 7–5 after the initial two . Later, from 19–35 behind, Davis won six consecutive frames to reduce his deficit to ten frames at 35–25. Donaldson secured victory at 73–49 and finished the match at 82–63. Donaldson's tactics during the championship involved compiling breaks of around 30 to 50 points, and playing rather than attempting difficult . Davis became frustrated with the lack of scoring chances Donaldson left for him, and missed a number of difficult pot attempts, thus allowing Donaldson opportunities to score and win frames. Donaldson won the title by defeating Davis 82–63, although he already reached the winning margin at 73–49. The championship trophy was presented by John C. Bissett, chairman of the BACC. After the final, Donaldson celebrated at the Albany Club, where he had won the 1946 Albany Club Professional Snooker Tournament the previous year.\nDavis made the highest break of the tournament with a 135 clearance in frame 86 of the final, just one short of the championship record. Donaldson's break of 98 against Newman in the 20th frame of the quarter-final was his highest at the championship. There were three century breaks during the final, all by Davis. Joe Davis commented after the match that, \"Donaldson's long potting at present is the equal of anything seen in snooker history\"; his brother Fred Davis said \"[Donaldson] is playing the best snooker I have ever seen\". In his book \"Talking Snooker\", first published in 1979, Fred Davis reflected that he had probably been \"perhaps overconfident\" and also had not expected Donaldson's standard to have improved so much as a result of his many hours of practice. This was the first of eight consecutive finals, from 1947 to 1954, featuring the two players.\nTwo wins by Joe Davis in challenge matches against Donaldson after the 1947 championship reinforced the public perception that the 15-time champion Davis was still the best player.\nMain draw.\nThe results for the main draw are shown below. Match winners are denoted in bold.\nQualifying.\nHerbert Holt had withdrawn from the qualifying in early December. The first match, between John Pulman and Albert Brown was a repeat of the final of the 1946 English Amateur Championship which Pulman had won. Brown led 14–9 after two days and took a winning 18–9 lead on the final day. Herbert Francis led Willie Leigh 14–10 after two days. Leigh levelled the score at 15–15 after the final afternoon session and eventually won 19–16. Sydney Lee beat Jim Lees 19–16 in the third match. In the last first-round match Kingsley Kennerley won easily against Conrad Stanbury, taking an 18–4 lead on the second evening.\nWillie Leigh won all six frames of the first session, and all but frame nine in the second session, to establish an 11–1 lead against Sydney Lee. On the second day, he confirmed a win by taking the 19th frame with a break of 63, for a winning margin of 17–2. Kennerley reached a decisive margin of victory at 18–10 against Mann. In the semi-finals, Albert Brown secured his place in the last frame of the second day of his match against Barrie, at 18–6, and Kennerley prevailed 18–9 against Leigh. Brown won the contest of the Birmingham-based players at 18–10, which meant he was scheduled to play Lindrum in the quarter-finals of the main competition.\nQualifying results.\nResults of the qualifying competition were as follows:"

On the first day, 19 April, Davis won seven of the 12 frames played. He achieved the same outcome on the second day, to lead 14–10, and on the third day to lead 21–15. At the close of the fourth day's play, Davis had increased his lead to ten frame at 29–19; a day later, he led 37–23.\nTaking eight of the twelve frames on 24 April meant that Davis led 45–27 at the end of the first week. when the match resumed on 26 April, Donaldson reduced his arrears, to 14 frames, at 35–49; remaining 14 behind at conclusion of both of the next two days of play, as each player took six frames each day. Davis won all six frames of the following day's first session, and three of six frames in the later session, leaving him three frames from victory at 70–50. On 30 April, Davis won the second, fourth and fifth frames to give him a decisive lead of 73–52. After dead frames, the score was 86–61. Davis's highest break of the match was 96, whist Donaldson's was 88. According to the reporter for \"The Billiard Player\" magazine, the final \"was a keenly contested struggle, neither player taking any undue risk. This at times made some of the games slow and even tedious to watch\". The correspondent for \"The Times\" wrote that \"it seems highly probable... that F. Davis will prove most difficult to beat for some years to come.\" The championship trophy was presented to Davis by Francis Douglas, 11th Marquess of Queensberry.\nIn his autobiography, Davis described Donaldson's style of play as patient, cautious and risk-averse. Davis felt that in the 1947 final, his own lack of patience, which meant he took chances to pot balls which sometimes failed and presented opportunities for Donaldson, was a factor in his defeat. He decided that in 1948, \"the way to beat him, unfortunately for the spectators, was to play him at his own game.\"\nMain draw.\nThe results for the main competition (Section A) were as follows. Winning players are denoted in bold.\nQualifying.\nAll qualifying matches were held at Burroughes Hall in London. The first-round matches were held from 1 to 13 December 1947.

Leigh won the final frame 83–35 to win the match. The final first-round match, between John Barrie and Herbert Francis was also close. The match was 12–12 after two days.

He had taken a winning lead of 73–58 on the previous day. The match was still in the balance with the score at 63–58 before Davis won 10 frames in a row to secure victory. Donaldson made the highest of the tournament, 115, on the last day of his semi-final match against John Pulman.\nBackground.\nThe World Snooker Championship is a professional tournament and the official world championship of the game of snooker. The sport was developed in the late 19th century by British Army soldiers stationed in India. Professional English billiards player and billiard hall manager Joe Davis noticed the increasing popularity of snooker compared to billiards in the 1920s, and with Birmingham-based billiards equipment manager Bill Camkin, persuaded the Billiards Association and Control Council (BACC) to recognise an official professional snooker championship in the 1926–27 season. In 1927, the final of the first professional snooker championship was held at Camkin's Hall; Davis won the tournament by beating Tom Dennis in the final. The annual competition was not titled the World Championship until the 1935 tournament, but the 1927 tournament is now referred to as the first World Snooker Championship. Davis had also won the title every year from 1928 to 1940, after which the tournament was not held again until 1946 due to World War II.

On the penultimate day, Donaldson took eleven of the twelve frames played, and the final score was 58–13. The reporter for \"The Billiard Player\" magazine wrote that Donaldson played \"brilliant pots and almost audacious shots, some of which might never have been seen even in an exhibition match\".\nHaving taken an early lead, Sidney Smith defeated Alec Brown 41–30, having made the highest break of the match, 98. Fred Davis led Kingsley Kennerley 18–6 and 23–6, and secured a winning margin at 36–13. His 104 break during the afternoon session on 10 March was the highest of the match.

A qualifying competition was held at the Temperance Billiards Hall, known as the \"Guild Hall\", in Battersea, London from 17 October to 12 November 1949. Kingsley Kennerley won the qualifying competition and joined seven other players in the main draw.\nFor the fourth year running the final was contested by Fred Davis and Walter Donaldson. Donaldson defeated Davis 51–46 to win his second and last world title. Donaldson achieved a winning margin at 49–42 with only 6 frames to play. Davis made a break of 101 in frame 46 of his semi-final match against George Chenier.\nBackground.\nThe World Snooker Championship is a professional tournament and the official world championship of the game of snooker. The sport was developed in the late 19th century by British Army soldiers stationed in India. Professional English billiards player and billiard hall manager Joe Davis noticed the increasing popularity of snooker compared to billiards in the 1920s, and with Birmingham-based billiards equipment manager Bill Camkin, persuaded the Billiards Association and Control Council (BACC) to recognise an official professional snooker championship in the 1926–27 season. In 1927, the final of the first professional snooker championship was held at Camkin's Hall; Davis won the tournament by beating Tom Dennis in the final. The annual competition was not titled the World Championship until the 1935 tournament, but the 1927 tournament is now referred to as the first World Snooker Championship. Davis had also won the title every year from 1928 to 1940, after which the tournament was not held again until 1946 due to World War II. Fred Davis was the defending champion, having defeated Walter Donaldson 80–65 in the 1949 final.\nThe closing date for entries for the 1950 edition was originally 1 August 1949. However, about half of the leading players, including Horace Lindrum, refused to enter because of the BACC's stipulation that each player in a match should provide a stake of 20 Guineas, with the stakes awarded to the match winner. It was reported later that month that only four players – defending champion Fred Davis, Donaldson, Jim Lees and Sydney Lee – had entered; on 10 August, the BACC decided to reduce the stake fee to 10 guineas (with an entry fee of 3 Guineas), and extend the closing date for entries to 1 September. BACC member Henry Markland was quoted as saying that the reason for the increase to 20 Guineas had been \"to discourage the entry of low-grade professionals who are, frankly, out of their class in the championship.\" Donaldson's withdrawal from the tournament was reported on 30 August; a BACC meeting on that day decided to remove the stake fee entirely, for the first time since the championship was established in 1927, and further extend the closing date for entries until 7 September. Donaldson said that as the Professional Billiard Players' Association demands had been met, he would now be participating. Lindrum's manager T.B. Leng said that Lindrum would honour alternative bookings made rather than compete in the championship.\nSidney Smith's entry was not accepted by the BACC.\nPrize fund.\nThe Sunday Empire News, which had sponsored a professional tournament in 1948, provided a prize fund:\nSchedule.\nMatches were played over several days, with and afternoon and evening each day, normally of six frames each.\nTournament summary.\nQuarter-finals.\nJohn Pulman led Albert Brown 9–3 after the first day, but saw his lead reduced to two frames, at 13–11, after day two. On the third day, Brown took eight of the 12 frames played, to lead 19–17, and the fourth day saw him dominate play to establish a ten-frame lead. In the next three sessions, Pulman took 14 of 18 frames to level the match at 33–33. After Brown had won the 67th frame, Pulman levelled at 34-all, but Brown took the next two frames for a decisive lead of 36–34, and added the for a final total of 37–34. Brown recorded the highest break of the match, 88.\nCanadian George Chenier and South African Peter Mans refused to play at Scunthorpe unless they received an acceptable financial guarantee; they agreed to the BACC's offer of £150. Chenier built a four frame lead on the first day, and maintained this advantage at the close of day two. By the close of the fourth day, Chenier was 29–19 ahead. Mans closed the gap to eight frames on day five, and followed this by taking all six frames in the afternoon session on the final day, leaving him two frames behind at 32–34. Chenier won the first two frames of the concluding session to confirm his progression the next round at 36–32; the final score after dead frames was 37–34. Chenier's break of 100 on day two was the highest of the match. \nWalter Donaldson's six-frame lead against Kingsley Kennerley following their first day's play was narrowed to four frames, at 14–10, after day two. The pair each won six frames on day three, but Donaldson moved into a twelve-frame lead, 30–18, by the end of day four. Kennerley reduced his deficit to ten frames during the fifth day, but Donaldson won the first frame on the final day to establish a decisive margin at 36–25. After dead frames, the final score was 42–29.

Davis added seven of the ten dead frames on the concluding day to finish 43–28 up. The highest break of the match was 101 by Davis, in frame 46, on the fourth day.\nThe match report in \"The Billiard Player\" magazine described the match between Donaldson and Brown as \"a palpitating struggle [that] included a great deal of dour and tense play\". The players were level at 9–9, 12–12 and 18–18, but Brown led 26–22 after taking fix of the six frames of the second session on the fourth day. Donaldson won the first five frames on day five, and the players were level again at 27–27. Going into the last day, Brown led 31–29.

Donaldson's victory was confirmed on the last day when the score was 49–32, with the match ending at 51–46. One session of the match was watched by almost 3,000 spectators. It was his second and last world championship title.\n\"The Billiard Player\" magazine attributed Donaldson's success to his strong safety play and a below-par performance from Davis. The highest break Donaldson achieved during the match was 80, with Davis's highest break 79. A reporter for the \"Manchester Evening News\" commented about the final that, \"So afraid were Fred Davis and Walter Donaldson... of making any rash move which would cost them a frame that play was painfully slow at times.\"\nMain draw.\nSources:\nQualifying.\nThe qualifying contest was held at the Temperance Billiards Hall, known as the \"Guild Hall\", an 18-table hall in Battersea, London from 17 October to 12 November 1949.

        "text": "The 1952 World Snooker Championship was a snooker tournament held between 25 February and 8 March 1952 at Houldsworth Hall, in Manchester, England. The event featured only two entrants – Australian Horace Lindrum and New Zealander Clark McConachy. Due to a dispute between the Professional Billiards Players' Association (PBPA) and the Billiards Association and Control Council (BACC), most players withdrew from the event. The BACC thought the championship was primarily about honour, and financial consideration should come second, whilst the PBPA disagreed. The PBPA established an alternative 'world championship' called the PBPA Snooker Championship which would later become the official world championship as the World Professional Match-play Championship.\nThe competition was played as one continual match, held over 145 . Lindrum won the match, taking a winning 73–37 lead early on the 10th day and won 94–49. In winning the event, Lindrum became the first player from outside the British Isles to gain victory in the tournament, and the only one of four players to do so, with Cliff Thorburn in 1980, Neil Robertson in 2010, and Luca Brecel in 2023. The status of the event is debated, with some historians only counting Thorburn's, Robertson's &amp; Brecel's wins due to the field of just two players.\nBackground.\nThe World Snooker Championship is an annual cue sport tournament and is the official world championship of the game of snooker. The first world championship in 1927, held in Camkin's Hall, Birmingham, England, was won by Joe Davis. Due to a dispute between the Professional Billiards Players' Association (PBPA) and the organisers for the event, the Billiards Association and Control Council (BACC), most players withdrew. The BACC thought the championship was primarily about honour, and financial consideration should come second, whilst the PBPA disagreed. The PBPA went on to create the World Professional Match-play Championship, where the remaining players would take part, and would be retroactively given status as the world championship for following years.\nWith just two participants remaining – Horace Lindrum and Clark McConachy – the tournament was contested over a single match. The pair met in a best of 145 match, held between 25 February and 8 March 1952 at the Houldsworth Hall in Manchester, England.\nMcConachy had played in the 1951/1952 News of the World Snooker Tournament from September 1951 to January 1952. This was an annual round-robin handicap tournament played by the leading professionals. McConachy was defeated in each of the eight games he played in and winning an average of 11 frames in each 37-frame match. He also lost all three matches he played on level terms, 10–27 to Albert Brown, 8–29 to John Pulman, and 11–26 to Sidney Smith. He lost 11–26 to Joe Davis, despite receiving a 21-point start in each frame.\nOn 19 February, the Tuesday before the final, McConachy had scored one of the early snooker maximum breaks in a practice frame at the Beaufort Club in London. An official of the BACC later examined the table and found it slightly over the standard size and so the break was not accepted as official. At the time, Joe Davis held the record for the highest official break of 146. Lindrum did not play in the News of the World tournament. His last competitive tournament was the 1951 World Snooker Championship, in which he had lost to Walter Donaldson in the semi-final, trailing 25–36 on the final day.\nSummary.\nWith the score tied at 6–6 after the first day, Lindrum won eight of the next twelve frames to lead 14–10 after the second day's play. This lead extended to 22–14 after the third day. All 12 frames were shared on day four, with each player winning six, but Lindrum still led 28–20. The fifth day saw featured Lindrum extend his lead to 38–22 after day five, winning ten of the twelve frames played. Lindrum led 44–28 at the end of the first full week of play.\nLindrum won eight frames on the eighth day of play to lead 52–32, before winning nine frames the following day to leave him 61–35 ahead. With the score required for victory being 73 frames, Lindrum won 10 frames on 5 March to lead 71–37, needing just two of the remaining 37 frames for victory. Lindrum won the first two frames to reach a winning 73–37 position on 6 March. The remaining 35 dead frames were due to be played, although in the end only a total of 143 frames were played, Lindrum winning 94–49. Lindrum became the first player from outside the British Isles to win the World Championship, and would remain the only Australian until compatriot Neil Robertson won the event in 2010.\nMain draw.\nSources:"

        "text": "Gil Reyes (born 1952) is an American fitness trainer who spent seventeen years as the strength and conditioning trainer for retired tennis player Andre Agassi, from 1989 until Agassi's retirement in 2006. He was also considered one of Agassi's closest friends and confidants.\nTrainer and friend.\nGil Reyes was the strength and conditioning coach for the basketball program at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas before meeting Agassi in 1989. Reyes was their strength coach when they won the 1990 NCAA championships.\nAfter Agassi lost in the fourth round of the 1998 US Open, he and Reyes recommitted to the training regimen they had established. Soon after returning to Las Vegas, Reyes asked Agassi for the first time to run up and down a 320-yard hill that Reyes calls \"Magic Mountain\". The story has become an oft-repeated story of Agassi's commitment and Reyes's motivation. This retooled training regime entailed two hours of court practice, followed by two hours of weight training and then to \"Magic Mountain\" for a series of sprints. It is believed that Agassi's late career revival would not have been possible without this training regime. Agassi himself said in 2005, at the age of 35, \"Gil is the reason why I've won more Slams after the age of 29 than I did before. He's the reason why I'm still out there playing this sport at a time in my life when I can really understand and appreciate it.\"\nReyes's approach transformed Agassi into a well-conditioned strong athlete. When they first began working together Agassi could bench press 135 pounds. Fourteen years later in 2003, he was benchpressing 350 lbs. Reyes described his job as being \"to get [Agassi] to be as good to himself as he is to others.\" The relationship between Reyes and Agassi was so close that Reyes was sometimes called \"the core\" of Agassi's team of advisors, friends and family.\nReyes's contributions to Agassi's success were often overlooked in favor of the contributions of coaches like Brad Gilbert.\nIn 2001, Agassi named his child Jaden Gil Agassi after his trainer and friend.\nAfter Agassi.\nGil Reyes currently runs the Gil Reyes Fitness Center in Las Vegas. Gil Reyes and Adidas have a contract under which he helps train young athletes, such as Fernando Verdasco, Sorana Cîrstea, Sania Mirza and Sam Querrey; the program is officially called the Adidas Player Development program. The training employed by Reyes consists of the same combination used for Andre Agassi- a combination of court practice, weight training and runs up \"Magic Mountain\".\nGil Reyes was credited by Fernando Verdasco for his improved fitness and career-best run to the Australian Open semifinals in January 2009. He is currently working with Eugenie Bouchard since October 2019."

        "title": "Holding (American football)",
        "text": "In gridiron football, holding is the illegal use of the hand or arm to restrain another player who is not in possession of the ball. Holding is prohibited in most football leagues because it does not allow fair play of the game and increases the risk for injury. It is one of the most common penalties in American football.\nWhile in the field of play, offensive holding results in a 10-yard penalty, or half the distance to the goal line when there are fewer than 20 yards between the line of scrimmage and the offense's end zone. If the act of holding is committed from within the offense's own end zone, the result is a safety. In the NFL, when holding is committed by the defense, the penalty is 5 yards and an automatic first down.\nIn the 2021 NFL season offensive holding was the most common penalty issued with 649 penalties being issued for 6,297 penalty yards. In addition, Defensive holding was the fourth most common penalty in the 2021 NFL season as well with 163 penalties being issued for a total of 780 penalty yards."

        "title": "Frederick Stokes (rugby union)",
        "text": "Frederick Stokes (12 July 1850 – 7 February 1929) was the first captain of the England national rugby union team, who played for and captained the team in the first three rugby internationals, all between England and Scotland. He was also the youngest president of the Rugby Football Union.\nEarly life.\nFrederick Stokes was born on 12 July 1850 in Greenwich, the son of Henry Graham Stokes, Proctor to the Admiralty and solicitor, and his wife Elizabeth Sewell. He was one of at least nine children (six brothers and three sisters) and attended Rugby School.\nRugby football.\nStokes played for Blackheath F.C. and was for a time captain of that side. His five brothers also played for Blackheath. On 26 January 1871, when Stokes was 20 years old he, along with Benjamin Burns, represented Blackheath at a meeting of twenty-one rugby teams at the Pall Mall Restaurant. The outcome of the meeting was the founding of the Rugby Football Union whose Laws were to be drafted by three Old Rugbeians, Algernon Rutter, E.C.Holmes and L.J. Maton. Less than two months later, Stokes, himself an Old Rugbeian, accepted a challenge from Scotland to raise a 20-man side to take to Edinburgh to play in what was to be the first international. Burns was also in the England side and of the 20 men, 10 were former pupils of Rugby School. Stokes was chosen to captain this side, which played Scotland at Raeburn Place in Edinburgh on 27 March 1871. The laws of rugby were still far from clearly defined at the time and the Scottish and English teams used different interpretations of them, which led to what has been described as \"a sometimes chaotic affair\". Scotland won this first international by one goal and one try to one try.\nStokes was chosen to captain the return match in 1872 when Scotland visited the Kennington Oval on 5 February 1872. England won this match by one goal, one drop goal and two tries, to one drop goal. The teams played for a third time the following year on 3 March 1873 in Glasgow which ended scoreless. Once again, Stokes was the captain and was one of only three England players to have appeared in every match. This was Stokes's last international and he effectively retired from international rugby when he was 22. However, his involvement continued and in 1874 he became the second president of the fledgling RFU and remains the youngest man to have held the position.\nHe was described as a \"brilliant forward, being always on the ball, and often making excellent runs …can also play at capital form at half-back, is a sure tackle and a first-rate drop or place-kick\".\nOther sports.\nA good golfer, he also played first-class cricket for Kent County Cricket Club, as did two of his brothers, Graham and Lennard.\nLife outside of rugby and family.\nFrederick followed his father into the legal profession becoming a solicitor. Frederick married Isabella Penn in 1877, the daughter of the famous marine engineer, John Penn. This was in the same year that his fellow rugby international and Old Rugbeian, Joseph Fletcher Green, married Isabella's sister Ellen. Thus, he and Joseph were brothers-in-law. They had a number of children including: Frederic Frank Stokes (1880), Alick (1882), Ellen Muriel Stokes (1888), Ellen Sybil Stokes (1891), Ellen Zoe Stokes (1898). Frederick Stokes died on 7 February 1929, at Inhurst House, Baughurst, Berkshire aged 78. Notably, all five of Frederick's brothers were keen sportsmen and all played rugby. One of his brothers, Lennard Stokes, also captained the England national rugby union team."

        "title": "1982 Women's Cricket World Cup",
        "text": "The 1982 Women's Cricket World Cup, known as the 1982 Hansells Vita Fresh World Cup for sponsorship purposes, was an international cricket tournament played in New Zealand from 10 January to 7 February 1982. Hosted by New Zealand for the first time, it was the third edition of the Women's Cricket World Cup, coming four years after the previous 1978 World Cup in India.\nThe tournament, which featured a triple round-robin, was at the time the longest World Cup both in duration and the number of matches played. Five teams were originally invited in addition to the hosts, but the Netherlands were unable to attend and the West Indies withdrew in protest at New Zealand hosting the 1981 South Africa rugby union tour during the apartheid-era in South Africa. Those teams were instead replaced by a composite International XI team. Australia did not lose a single match, winning its second consecutive tournament by defeating England in the final at Lancaster Park, Christchurch. Australia's thirteen matches without defeat were part of a greater series of 24 matches without defeat, extending from 1978 to 1985, which was a One Day International (ODI) record before being broken by themselves in 2021 which consists of a streak of 26 matches extending from 2018 to 2021. The World Cup was marked by its low scoring, with only one team recording more than 250 runs in an innings, and was also notable for featuring two matches that were tied – the first between England and New Zealand, and the second between England and Australia. They were the first ties in international women's cricket. England's Jan Brittin led the tournament in runs, while Australian spinner Lyn Fullston led the tournament in wickets.\nBackground.\nJack Hayward and Rachael Heyhoe-Flint organised the 1973 Women's Cricket World Cup, predating the first men's Cricket World Cup by two years. The tournament was played as a league format; the team who topped the points table at the conclusion would be champions. England beat Australia in the last match of the tournament to become the first Women's World Cup winners. The second Women's Cricket World Cup was scheduled to take place in South Africa in 1978, but with that country facing increasing sporting boycotts due to its apartheid policies, and withdrawals for financial reasons by the Netherlands and West Indies, the tournament was in jeopardy. The 1978 Women's Cricket World Cup was belatedly relocated to India, and featured only four teams. The tournament was once again played in a league format, but as in 1973, the final group match acted as a de facto final: Australia beat England to become champions.\nDuring the 1978 World Cup, the International Women's Cricket Council (IWCC) met. The IWCC had not been involved in the running of either of the first two world cups, but felt that there had been a lack of organisation, and announced that they would be more involved with future world cups. Despite the involvement of the IWCC, the organisation of the 1982 event still primarily rested on the New Zealand Women's Cricket Council; which itself was mostly formed of the players themselves. They spent eighteen months planning the tournament. Their efforts resulted in the Women's World Cup having a title sponsor for the first time; it was officially known as the Hansells Vita Fresh World Cup.\nFormat.\nUnlike the two previous women's world cups, the 1982 tournament featured a final. A round-robin league stage involved each of the five teams playing each other three times each; a total of 30 group matches, from which the top two teams qualified for the final. The tournament took place over 29 days, from 10 January to 7 February. Each match was played as a 60-overs-per-side contest.\nParticipants.\nFive teams were invited: Australia, England, India, the Netherlands and the West Indies, but as in 1978, South Africa were not invited due to the ongoing boycott. Despite the increased sponsorship, and the involvement of the IWCC, participating teams and players had to fund their own visit. For example, each Indian player had to pay ₨10,000 (roughly £570, or US$1,000 at the time). This cost was prohibitive for the Dutch team, who withdrew from the tournament, as they had four years earlier. The West Indies also pulled out, in protest that New Zealand had hosted the apartheid-era South African rugby team in 1981. In order to prevent another four-team competition, the organising committee decided to invite a selection of players to form an International XI, as had featured at the 1973 World Cup.\nGroup stage.\nSummary.\nThe tournament began on 10 January 1982 with two matches played in Auckland. Australia beat India by 153 runs, a new record margin in women's ODIs. In the other match, another record was set; England and New Zealand played out the first tied match in women's ODIs. The tournament remained in Auckland for the next round of matches on 12 January; England beat India by four wickets, while New Zealand surpassed the record set by Australia two days earlier, by beating the International XI by 184 runs, a record which would stand for six years. New Zealand set another new record in their next match two days later, when they bowled India out for what was, at the time, the lowest total in women's ODIs: 37. On the same day in Hamilton, England beat the International XI by 132 runs. Australia beat New Zealand by eight wickets and England by 44 runs on consecutive days in New Plymouth, while India completed a 79-run victory over the International XI in Napier. England remained in New Plymouth, and beat New Zealand by seven wickets the day after their loss to Australia.\nContinuing to move south, Australia beat the International XI by 64 runs in Palmerston North, while on the same day India beat England by 47 runs, India's first win over England, and a victory \"The Guardian\" described at the time as India's \"best ever result in the World Cup\". On 21 January, New Zealand beat the International XI by 97 runs. Two days later, Australia beat England by six wickets. England played again the next day, beating the International XI by nine wickets, while New Zealand beat India by eight wickets. Australia then won twice in two days, beating the International XI by 146 runs and India by four wickets. In the last round of matches played in the North Island, England beat New Zealand by five wickets, New Zealand then lost to Australia by 69 runs, before India beat the International XI by 78 runs.\nThe tournament moved to the South Island on 30 January; Australia beat the International XI by 76 runs in Dunedin. The next day, England beat India by ten wickets, and New Zealand beat the International XI by 84 runs. Australia and England tied the 25th match of the tournament; it was England's second tie of the group stage, and the second ever in women's ODIs. India were once again bowled out cheaply by New Zealand in their next match, and were beaten by eight wickets. On 4 February, Australia and England both posted large totals in their victories; Australia scored 193 for five as they beat India by 39 runs, while England scored 242 for four in a 113-run over the International XI. Two days later, Australia beat New Zealand by 41 runs, and India beat the International XI by 14 runs; meaning that the International XI did not record a win in the competition. In the final match of the group stage, Australia beat England by three wickets.\nHaving remained unbeaten throughout the tournament, only dropping points in their tie with England, Australia finished top of the table. England trailed them by fourteen points in second place; both qualified for the final. New Zealand won all their matches against India and the International XI, but against Australia and England, only gained points during their tie with England. India's victory over England was their only win that did not come against the International XI.\nPoints table.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nFinal.\nThe final was the only match of the tournament played at Lancaster Park, Christchurch, and took place in front of a crowd of 3,000. Dickie Bird became the only umpire to stand in both a men's and women's World Cup final. England won the toss and batted first. They scored slowly until the last ten overs of their innings; Jan Southgate made their highest score, with 53 runs, but found batting difficulty against Australia's spin bowling. In the last ten overs, England played more expansively, and eventually finished with 151 runs, meaning that Australia would need to score 152 to win. Australia lost three wickets early in their chase, but were steadied by a partnership between Karen Read and Sharon Tredrea. Quick scoring from Jen Jacobs and Marie Cornish late-on in the innings helped Australia to their target with six balls remaining, securing a three-wicket victory, and their second World Cup title.\nStatistics.\nEngland's Jan Brittin finished with the most runs during the World Cup, having accumulated 391, ahead of the 383 scored by Lynne Thomas of the International XI and Susan Goatman, also of England, who scored 374. Brittin also made the highest score of the tournament, when she scored 138 not out against the International XI. The only other century of the tournament came against the same opposition: Barbara Bevege's 101. The best averages of the competition were achieved by England's Heyhoe-Flint, with 47.83, and two Australians, Jill Kennare (43.87) and Lyn Fullston (41.00).\nAmongst the bowlers, Fullston took the most wickets (23), followed by Jackie Lord of New Zealand, with 22, and India's Shubhangi Kulkarni, who took 20. Lord had the best bowling figures in an innings, when she took six wickets against India. The only other bowler to take five wickets in an innings was Fullston, who did so against New Zealand, taking five for 27. Kulkarni had the best bowling average in the World Cup, collecting her wickets at 11.70. She was followed by Fullston (12.00) and Lord (12.40). The most economical bowler was New Zealand's Sue Brown, who conceded 1.53 runs per over, followed by a pair of Australians; Cornish (1.76) and Denise Martin (1.77)."

Hosted by India for the first time, it was the second edition of the Women's Cricket World Cup, after the inaugural 1973 World Cup in England.\nIt was originally proposed that South Africa host the World Cup, but this was abandoned to conform with the sporting boycott of the country. The Women's Cricket Association of India (WCAI) then made a successful bid, and served as the primary organiser, with the International Women's Cricket Council (IWCC) providing only limited oversight. Along with India, which was making its debut, five other teams were originally invited – Australia, England, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and the West Indies. The Netherlands and the West Indies, which had both not previously participated, were forced to withdraw due to financial issues. The four teams that did compete (the lowest number in the tournament's history) played a round-robin tournament of three matches each, with Australia going undefeated to claim its first title. Australia's captain, Margaret Jennings, led the tournament in runs, while her teammate, Sharyn Hill, led the tournament in wickets.\nSquads.\nInformation is only available for players who played at least one match at the tournament.\nWarm-up matches.\nAt least five warm-up matches were played against various local Indian teams, all but one of which came before the tournament.\nMatches.\nEngland vs Australia.\nBoth Australia and England went into the last match of the tournament undefeated, which meant it functioned as a \"de facto\" final, akin to the Uruguay v Brazil match at the 1950 Football World Cup. England's Megan Lear later recounted that the \"most memorable part of [the] tournament was playing in front of crowds of 40,000 plus\".\nStatistics.\nMost runs.\nThe top five runscorers are included in this table, ranked by runs scored and then by batting average.\nSource: ESPNcricinfo CricketArchive\nMost wickets.\nThe top five wicket takers are listed in this table, ranked by wickets taken and then by bowling average.\nSource: ESPNcricinfo"

In the final, the team with the higher winning percentage of games in the tournament were to be the home team. If the teams competing in the final had identical winning percentages in the tournament, then World Baseball Classic, Inc. (WBCI) would conduct a coin flip or draw to determine the home team.\nBracket.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nResults.\nFinal − Japan 5, South Korea 3.\nSouth Korea won the coin flip held after the second semifinal between Japan and the United States, designating them as the home team for the final.\nJapan drew first blood, scoring on a RBI single by Michihiro Ogasawara in the third inning. Shin-Soo Choo tied the score 1−all with a home run in the fifth inning. With runners on first and third, Hiroyuki Nakajima hit an RBI single to bring Seiichi Uchikawa home to give Japan the lead 2−1. South Korea failed to take advantage of Japanese pitcher Hisashi Iwakuma, who was visibly tired, when they failed to score in the seventh inning, when Iwakuma was relieved by Toshiya Sugiuchi after two outs. Uchikawa hit a single to start the eighth. Atsunori Inaba scored a double to put Uchikawa in scoring position, and Uchikawa scored on Akinori Iwamura's sacrifice fly. Hyun-wook Jong retired the remaining batters to close out the inning.\nJapan brought out their closer, Yu Darvish, for the bottom of the ninth with a 3−2 lead. Darvish struck out Keun-woo Jeong, but walked Hyun-soo Kim and Tae-kyun Kim to put South Koreans on first and second with one out. Darvish then struck out Choo and was one out away from saving the game. But Bum-ho Lee singled, driving in Jong-wook Lee for the game-tying run to make it 3–all and send the game into extra innings.\nJapan batted first, with Chang-yong Lim pitching for South Korea in the tenth. Uchikawa and Iwamura hit a single to put runners on first and third with two out. Ichiro was one strike away from ending the inning when he hit a line-drive single up the middle that scored Iwamura and Uchikawa. Lim then hit Nakajima with a pitch and intentionally walked Norichika Aoki to face Kenji Johjima who was hitless up to that point. Lim was able to strikeout Johjima and send the game to the bottom of the tenth. Darvish made short work of South Korea, capping with a strikeout of Keun-woo Jeong to clinch Japan's successful defense of their 2006 championship.\nJapan's Daisuke Matsuzaka was awarded the tournament MVP for the second consecutive time, with a 3−0 record and 2.45 ERA."

The school competes in the Southeastern Conference in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The Tigers play their homes games at Auburn Arena in Auburn, Alabama on the university campus. The program began in 1971.\nAuburn has won five SEC regular season championships and four SEC tournament championships. Auburn has appeared in the NCAA tournament 21 times, making it as far as the championship game three times in a row in 1988, 1989, and 1990. Auburn has produced eight WNBA draft picks, including DeWanna Bonner who was selected with the fifth overall pick, the highest in Auburn history. Eight Auburn players have been named All-Americans and Auburn has had 73 All-SEC selections. Four Auburn players have been named SEC Player of the Year: Vickie Orr in 1988, Carolyn Jones in 1990 and 1991, Lauretta Freeman in 1993, and DeWanna Bonner in 2009. Former head coaches Joe Ciampi and Nell Fortner have been selected as SEC Coach of the Year a total of four times.\nHistory.\nThe Auburn women's basketball team has been consistently competitive both nationally and within the SEC. Despite playing in the same conference as perennial powerhouse Tennessee and other competitive programs such as LSU, Georgia, Kentucky and Vanderbilt, and more recently, South Carolina, Mississippi State and Texas A&amp;M, Auburn has won five regular season SEC championships and four SEC tournament championships. Auburn has made 21 appearances in the NCAA women's basketball tournament, advancing to the Sweet 16 seven times and the Elite Eight six times. Auburn played in three consecutive National Championship games in 1988, 1989 and 1990, and won the Women's NIT in 2003.\nWhen Coach Joe Ciampi announced his retirement after 25 years at the end of the 2003–2004 season, the resulting search snared the highly experienced, former Purdue and US National and Olympic team head coach, Nell Fortner. Fortner coached the team through the 2011–2012 season, including a 2009 SEC regular-season championship and a 30-4 record. The Tigers made two NCAA Tournament appearances in Fortner's eight-year tenure.\nFortner was replaced in 2012 by Terri Williams-Flournoy who had been the head coach at Georgetown University for eight seasons. Williams-Flournoy directed the Tigers to three NCAA Tournament appearances, a pair of 20-win seasons and two trips to the WNIT in her nine seasons.\nWilliams-Flournoy was relieved of her coaching duties following the 2020-21 season. On April 3, 2021, Johnnie Harris was named the program's seventh head coach.\nStandout former Auburn players include: Mae Ola Bolton, Ruthie Bolton, Vickie Orr, Carolyn Jones, Chantel Tremitiere, Lauretta Freeman, Le'coe Willingham, DeWanna Bonner, Monique Morehouse, Blanche Alverson, Tyrese Tanner and Unique Thompson.\nPlayers.\nAwards and honors.\nOther honors.\nSEC Player of the Year\nSEC Tournament MVP\nSEC Freshman of the Year\nSEC Scholar-Athlete of the Year\nAuburn in the WNBA.\nWNBA Draft picks.\nAuburn has produced eight WNBA draft picks, including three in the inaugural 1997 draft.

Six years later in 1987, Auburn routed Georgia by a score of 83–57 to win their second championship. After losing in the championship game to Tennessee twice in a row in the following years, Auburn defeated Tennessee in the 1990 championship game 78–77. Auburn won its most recent SEC Tournament championship in 1997, defeating Florida 52–47. Auburn has reached the SEC Tournament final four other times, falling to Tennessee in 1985, 1988, and 1989 and falling to Vanderbilt in 2009.\nFour Auburn players have been selected as SEC Tournament MVP: Becky Jackson in 1981, Vickie Orr in 1987, Carolyn Jones in 1990, and Laticia Morris in 1997.

Following the 1990–91 basketball season, the NSWAC was absorbed by the Trans America Athletic Conference, with the TAAC incorporating all NSWAC statistics and records as its own. The conference changed its name to Atlantic Sun Conference in 2002, and rebranded itself as the ASUN Conference in 2016.\nHistory.\nFor most of its history, the tournament was held at predetermined campus sites, a tradition which started with the inception of the women's tournament. From 2004-07, the tournament was played regularly at the Dothan Civic Center in Dothan, Alabama, though then-conference member Troy was the official host in 2004-05, and the city of Dothan was the host in 2006-07, after Troy had departed for the Sun Belt Conference. Starting in 2008, the tournament moved yet again, this time to Nashville, Tennessee, hosted by Lipscomb. In 2010, the tourney was moved to Macon, Georgia and was hosted by Mercer University through 2013. It then moved to Alico Arena on the campus of Florida Gulf Coast University near Fort Myers, Florida for two seasons. The 2016 tournament began a new era for the event, with all games being held at campus sites. Since then, all games have been hosted by the higher seed of the teams involved, except for the 2021 edition. With the 2020–21 season dramatically affected by COVID-19, the ASUN chose to move its entire tournament to the campus of Kennesaw State University in Kennesaw, Georgia."

        "title": "ESPN College Basketball",
        "text": "ESPN College Basketball is a blanket title used for presentations of college basketball on ESPN and its family of networks (including ABC since 2006). Its coverage focuses primarily on competition in NCAA Division I, holding broadcast rights to games from each major conference, and a number of mid-major conferences.\nESPN was the first broadcaster to provide extensive early-round coverage of NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship, prior to CBS, later in partnership with Turner Sports, holding sole rights to \"March Madness\". The network also covers a number of early-season tournaments, conference championships, and is also the exclusive broadcaster of the National Invitation Tournament and the Women's Division I championship.\nHistory.\n1979.\nESPN has aired college basketball games from its inception, starting in 1979 with DePaul's victory over Wisconsin with a then-novice color commentator Dick Vitale and Joe Boyle doing the play-by-play. In the early days, Vitale was paired with veteran sportscaster Jim Simpson.\n1980s.\nOne of the first milestone events that ESPN covered was the NCAA tournament. In 1980, the fledgling channel had a total of 23 tournament games. More specifically, ESPN aired the NCAA Productions telecasts of all 16 first-round games (12 on tape delay). Jay Randolph, Gary Thompson, Steve Shannon, Steve Grad, Fred White, Larry Conley, Bill O'Donnell, Bucky Waters, and Jeff Mullins were among the commentators. ESPN again aired 16 first-round games (12 on tape delay) produced by NCAA Productions in 1981. That year, ESPN aired the BYU-Notre Dame (at Atlanta) with Bill O'Donnell and Jeff Mullins on the call. This particular game soon became famous for Danny Ainge's coast-to-coast buzzer beater to send BYU to Elite 8. ESPN also aired the last Final Four consolation game at 5 p.m. on March 30, 1981.\nThey intensively covered the early rounds of \"March Madness\", gaining the entire tournament much prestige. The early rounds of course were not the most ideal time, many games taking place during work hours. When CBS gained exclusive coverage in 1991, they would largely mimic how their predecessor had covered the event. ESPN aired the NCAA productions telecasts of all 16 first-round games (12 on tape delay).\nDuring the 1985 NCAA tournament, ESPN aired five live games on each first round day which, combined with the CBS games and the around the clock ESPN tape delayed games, made for almost non-stop basketball for 55 consecutive hours from Thursday noon through early Saturday evening. With four games at each first round site, NCAA Productions typically sent two announcer crews to each site to call two games each.\nOne of the next milestones in ESPN's coverage was when they aired \"Championship Week\" for the first time in 1986 (the term would be coined later however). The network was given critical acclaim for its coverage of the conference tournaments, of bouncing from game to the next. It also raised the profile of many \"mid-major\" and \"minor\" conferences who received their only national attention during a single game, usually the championship game of their conference tournament. Like everything else with ESPN, the success and expansion of the network led to more games being televised in this made-for-TV event.\n1987 was the last year that ESPN was involved in the regional semifinals of the NCAA Tournament. John Saunders was ESPN's studio host in the afternoon while Bob Ley was the studio host in the evening. Dick Vitale served as the studio analyst for both men. In 1989, Tim Brando became the afternoon studio host while John Saunders moved to the evening. And then a year later, Chris Fowler replaced Brando as the afternoon studio host. As previously mentioned, 1990 was also the last year ESPN/NCAA Productions' involvement.\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s with only a single network; no regional or internet coverage, ESPN televised around 200 games a year.\n1990s.\nIn 1991, they would lose coverage of the early rounds of the NCAA Tournament but would continue to televise just as many regular season games and conference tournament games.\nIn 1993, ESPN aired the Women's Selection Show for the first time ever. Unlike the men's tournament, ESPN is the only network that airs the unveiling.\nIn 1996, ESPN and ESPN2 aired a total of 281 men's games and 22 women's games.\n2000s.\nESPN has rapidly increased its coverage throughout the years as the network as expanded from a single cable channel to a multiple outlets including the internet.\nIn 2003, ESPN and its sister networks aired all the games of the Women's NCAA Tournament for the first time ever, a practice that still exists today.\nOn March 4, 2005, ESPNU premiered on the outset of a Texas–Oklahoma State game from Stillwater, Oklahoma with a special two-hour edition of \"College GameDay\". ESPNU has aired the first set of games of each season, beginning in its initial season of 2005.\nIn 2005–06, the ESPN family of networks aired 884 games (they aired 140 women's games that year). However the following season, they aired over 1000 games.\nIn 2007, ESPNU as well as ESPN2 aired the first-ever \"NIT Selection Show\". Also, ESPN Radio aired its first-ever coverage of the \"Selection Sunday\". Also that year, a then-record of more than 3.3 million brackets entered on ESPN.com surpassing the record set the previous year.\nDuring the 2007–2008 season, the ESPN networks aired a total of more than 1,050 men's games and 150 women's games. ESPNU aired over 250 games. In addition, ESPN aired Pac-10 games for the first time since 1995, through a new agreement with FSN. They showed a total of 2 games. The year was marked by Dick Vitale missing his first assignment ever due to surgery. He was replaced by Jay Bilas on \"Saturday Primetime\". He returned on February 6 for the UNC-Duke matchup. Due to the 2008 Atlanta tornado outbreak, ESPN2, instead of CBS, aired the 2008 SEC tournament finals from Alexander Memorial Coliseum on the campus of Georgia Tech. However, CBS production was utilized including talent and graphics. ESPN had a record 3.65 million entries for the \"Tournament Challenge\".\nLegendary basketball coach Bob Knight retired from coaching in February 2008, he joined ESPN, the following month as a studio analyst for \"Championship Week\" and later appeared during the NCAA tournament, including on location from San Antonio at the Final Four. His role was greatly expanded during the 2008–09 season, when he appeared on many platforms including a weekly Thursday game as well as \"College GameDay.\"\nThe ESPN networks aired about 1,100 games during the 2008–09 season, including 148 women's games (including the entire NCAA Tournament).\nIn the 2009–10 season, ESPN began a 15-year deal to serve as the main rightsholder of the SEC. The package initially contained a broadcast television package via ESPN Regional Television (\"SEC Network\", later \"SEC TV\"), which replaced the conference's long-standing association with Raycom Sports. ESPN later launched an SEC Network cable network.\n2010s.\nIn 2010, ESPN reached a deal for rights to Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) basketball and football, while still maintaining Raycom's long-standing syndicated package. In July 2016, ESPN announced an extension of the agreement, which would include the formation of the ACC Network cable channel, and the end of Raycom's broadcast television package after the 2018–19 season. In 2017, ESPN renewed its rights to the Big Ten through the 2022–23 season.\nIn 2017, ESPN unveiled a significantly redesigned on-air presentation for college basketball games; ESPN explained that the new branding was designed to reflect the fan culture and tribalism of the game.\n2020s.\nIn August 2022, ESPN lost its rights to the Big Ten after the upcoming 2022–23 season. In October 2022, ESPN renewed with the Big 12 Conference.\nDue to the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes, it was announced that five January 2024 \"NBA Wednesday\" games instead was airing on ABC instead of on ESPN as part of a Doubleheader, to replace this coverage ESPN will air a single college basketball game each night instead.\nCoverage.\nGame coverage.\nESPN broadcasts weekly games in various windows. Its flagship weekly games are \nESPN currently airs many pre-season tournaments and showcases, some of which organized by ESPN Events, including the AdvoCare Invitational, the ACC–Big Ten Challenge (from 1999 through 2022), the Champions Classic, the Jimmy V Classic, and the NIT Season Tip-Off. The Jimmy V Classic is accompanied by \"Jimmy V Week\", a charity appeal across ESPN's networks for the V Foundation for Cancer Research. The event traditionally includes an airing of Jim Valvano's speech at the 1993 ESPY Awards, where he addressed his condition and announced the formation of the charity. \nThe final week of the regular season is branded as \"Bracket Builder Week\" (formerly \"Judgment Week\") and highlights games involving possible contenders for the NCAA tournament, while \"\"\"Champ Week\" (formerly \"Championship Week\") is used as the blanket branding for coverage of conference tournaments. ESPN formerly broadcast other in-season events, including \nPost-season tournaments.\nESPN airs the National Invitation Tournament since 1989. While domestic rights to the NCAA men's tournament are held by CBS and Turner Sports, ESPN International distributes coverage of the tournament internationally, and produces its own feed of the Final Four and championship game using the \"ESPN College Basketball\" staff. In 2013, ESPN International's Final Four coverage was called by Dan Shulman and Dick Vitale (alternatively joined by Brad Nessler for one of the semi-final games).\nNon-games.\nESPN has traditionally aired coverage of non-game action including Midnight Madness, which it help popularize by airing the first practices.\n\"College GameDay\" which grew as a spin-off of the popular football series is a weekly series that airs during conference play and post-season action. The main difference however is that the sites are pre-determined based on the location of the \"Saturday Primetime\" match-up. The show incorporates many of the features and is similar to the football edition.\nDuring the NCAA tournament, many ESPN personalities including Dick Vitale appear to discuss the tournament. In addition during the \"Final Four\", there is an on-location set. Typically special editions of \"College Gameday\" and \"SportsCenter\" appear during this time. In 2017, alongside its selection shows for the NIT and Women's NCAA Division I tournament, ESPN first held the \"Tournament Challenge Marathon\"—a 24-hour-long slate of programming (including special editions of existing ESPN studio shows) devoted to bracketology. The event was co-promoted with ESPN.com's \"ESPN Tournament Challenge\" bracket game, and contained charitable appeals for the Jimmy V Foundation. The event was revived in 2018, with a 25-hour marathon of tournament-related programming.\nESPNU airs a National Signing Day, first premiering in 2008. It was done due to the popularity of the football edition.\nWomen's coverage.\nESPN has greatly expanded its coverage of the women's game, which now includes the entire NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship tournament, culminating with the \"Final Four\". They air many of the same pre-season and conference tournaments as the men do including \"Jimmy V Women's Basketball Classic\", \"Holiday Hoops\", \"ESPNU Campus Connection Week\", \"February Frenzy\", \"Rivalry Week\", and \"Championship Week\". The season begins with the \"State Farm Tip-Off Classic\". ESPN2 airs a weekly \"Big Monday\" game in primetime. In addition, ESPN airs the \"Maggie Dixon Classic\". Every February, ESPN2 airs \"February Frenzy\". They air multiple games in a telecast window(s) and go to the games whip-around style. The Women's Selection Show is aired on ESPN including bonus coverage on ESPNU on \"Selection Monday\" after many years of being overshadowed by the men's show.\nCriticism.\nESPN is often accused of having a bias towards certain teams, including the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), particularly the Duke Blue Devils and North Carolina Tar Heels. ESPN and the ACC have a rights deal that extends through the 2026–27 season which provides additional football, men's and women's basketball and Olympic sports coverage on a variety of platforms, suggesting the bias may have a financial motivation. In addition, ESPN has also been very fond of the Kentucky Wildcats as most of ESPN's Super Tuesday weeks usually tends to feature a game involving Kentucky, even when it is playing against one of the lesser SEC teams.\nDick Vitale is often criticized for being a \"homer\" for Duke, especially for former coach Mike Krzyzewski, as well as most teams in the ACC (for example, a February 28, 2017 game between Indiana vs. Purdue game was scheduled to be on ESPN but was demoted to ESPN2 in favor of Florida State vs. Duke). He is also known for mentioning Duke frequently during broadcasts, even when Duke is not playing. Temple head coach John Chaney once said \"You can't get Dick Vitale to say 15 words without Duke coming out of his mouth\". He is sometimes called \"Duke Vitale\" or \"Dookie V\", a take-off on his \"Dickie V\" nickname, by detractors for the same reason. Although his bias towards Duke is widely speculated by many, he is also believed to favor the entire ACC in general, including Duke's rival, North Carolina as well as Kentucky.\nA large number of college basketball games are covered off-site, with announcers watching games on television at a studio at Bristol or Los Angeles. For instance, some 2016 NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship games are produced off-site.\nTypical games.\nDuring the regular season, typical games that are shown almost every year on the ESPN family of networks include Duke-North Carolina, Florida-Kentucky, Texas Tech-Baylor, Gonzaga-Saint Mary’s, and Kansas-Kansas State.\n\"Championship Week\" always features most Division I conference tournaments including expanding coverage of the \"major\" conferences. The \"mid-major\" and/or \"minor\" conferences will typically only get the latter rounds of the tournaments carried, if not, only the conference finale game."

Since 1988, the winner of the conference tournament has been awarded the Lamoriello Trophy, named after the first commissioner of Hockey East, Lou Lamoriello.\nThe tournament was first hosted at the Providence Civic Centre (now called the Amica Mutual Pavilion) in Providence, Rhode Island, with Providence winning the inaugural tournament. Boston College has won the most Hockey East Men's Ice Hockey Tournaments with eleven and has the most championship game appearances with sixteen. Jerry York has coached nine championship teams and has the most championship game appearances with eleven. Shawn Walsh has made the most consecutive championship appearances with seven (1987–1993).\nThe TD Garden (formerly the FleetCenter) has hosted the tournament since 1996. The Boston Garden hosted the tournament seven times, while the Providence Civic Center and Kelley Rink each hosted the tournament twice. In 2021, the Mullins Center served as host for the championship game, as all tournament games were held on campus locations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Massachusetts earned the right to host the title game as the higher seed of the two semifinal winners. \n2016 was the first Championship in which at least one of the \"Big 4\" schools (Boston College, Boston University, Maine and New Hampshire) did not play in the title game.\nPerformance by team.\nThe code in each cell represents the furthest the team made it in the respective tournament:\n&lt;br&gt;"

It is regarded by critics as one of the hundred best Mexican films of all time.\nIn the film, a taxidermist is unhappily married to a religious fanatic who maliciously torments him. After the wife breaks his new camera, he poisons her to death and puts her skeleton on display. \nPlot.\nPablo Morales (Arturo de Córdova) is a cheerful taxidermist, who lives with his bitter, crippled, obsessive, and extremely religious wife Gloria (Amparo Rivelles). Pablo wants to have children, but Gloria does not. Gloria constantly rebuffs his amorous advances, and constantly belittles him by telling him that he stinks of dead animals. Her primary reason for existence seems to be maliciously annoying her husband.\nPablo has been saving money to buy a camera, but Gloria takes the money Pablo was saving and gives it to the church, leading to conflict with the local priest. Gloria falsely accuses Pablo of drunkenness and abuse. Pablo gets his camera, but Gloria maliciously breaks it, which proves to be the straw that breaks the camel's back.\nPablo takes his revenge by poisoning her. He then dissects Gloria's body and places her skeleton in the front window of his shop. The police and local priest become suspicious and he is put on trial, but he manages to escape man's justice (but not God's).\nProduction.\nArthur Machen's original 1927 essay, \"The Islington Mystery\", which can be found in his collection \"The Cosy Room\", was based largely on the case of the famous murderer Dr. Crippen. Screenwriter Luis Alcoriza was influenced by his association with Luis Buñuel.\nReception.\nThis film is ranked 19 in the list of the 100 best films of Mexican cinema, in the opinion of 25 film critics and experts on Mexico, published by the magazine \"Somos\" in July 1994."

        "text": " \nThe history of rugby union matches between Argentina and Ireland is one of a very even contest and significant mutual rivalry, a rivalry increased by a series of notable meetings at the Rugby World Cup. \n, the sides have met twenty four times with a result of fifteen wins to Ireland, eight to Argentina and one drawn game; however, five of these matches were not a fully test capped match for Ireland. At the end of the 2010 Autumn Internationals there was only a nineteen-point difference in cumulative points scored. The largest winning margin of 23 points for Argentina was recorded in the meeting of their 2015 Rugby World Cup quarter-final, when Argentina won by 43 points to 20. Ireland's largest winning margin is 46 points, which occurred in November 2021. \nArgentina have yet to beat Ireland on Irish soil, and Ireland have only won twice in Argentina. Ireland's first win against Argentina was in 1952, however it was only a capped match for Argentina. Ireland's first fully test capped away win in Argentina came in 2014. Since 2012 matches between the two teams have been held for the Admiral Brown Cup. Argentina first won the Cup in 2015; since 2018 it has been held by Ireland.\nIn the nineteen matches since 1990 which are counted as full internationals by both sides, Argentina have won six times and Ireland thirteen times. The five matches played between 1952 and 1973 are not regarded as full internationals by Ireland, but are by Argentina; in these matches each side has two wins, with one match drawn.\nXV results.\nBelow is a list of matches that Argentina has awarded matches test match status by virtue of awarding caps, but Ireland did not award caps."

One of its main aims is to develop players for Germany to be able to participate in the 2015 Rugby World Cup, as well as to establish a German team in the European Challenge Cup, the \"Wild Titans\" by 2010. The later plan was delayed but a German team is now scheduled to enter the competition from 2011, alongside other academy teams from Russia, Spain and Georgia.\nHistory.\nThe academy was named after its founder, the German entrepreneur Hans Peter Wild. He originally conceived the idea in May 2007 and the academy was established in October of the same year.\nThe academy aims to import expertise from the more developed rugby nations in order to improve the game in Germany. It started out with an under-19 group which was later followed by an under-21 group, and draws young players from the Frankfurt, Heusenstamm and Heidelberg area, targeting clubs and schools. In 2008, the academy \"decided to become more professional\" and employed a new manager and coach.\nIn November 2008, the academy embarked on its first tour, traveling to England to play two matches. In March 2009, an academy team, the \"Wild Titans\", will be traveling to Hong Kong for a tournament. Mustafa Güngör and Benjamin Danso, two current German internationals, are part of the 15 selected players for the tournament.\nAims and achievements.\nThe academy aims to develop the game of rugby union in Germany, by awarding scholarships to young and senior players. It also plans to assist in the development of coaches and referees. The main goals of the academy are:\nChristopher Liebig was the first player trained with the academy to make a debut for Germany, in its game against Portugal in February 2009.\nIn 2018, the academy's scope was significantly curtailed, as Dr. Wild shifted his focus away from German rugby in the wake of the \"Rugbystreit\" (The \"Rugbystreit\" in German Rugby.)\nStaff.\nThe \"W.R.A.\" employees a number of staff for coaching purposes:"

The conference was founded in 1971 and disbanded in 2013 following major conference realignment, with then-member Bowling Green taking ownership of the conference name. In 2021, the CCHA was reestablished with eight members, including Bowling Green. At the completion of each regular season, both versions of the CCHA have held the CCHA Men's Ice Hockey Tournament to determine the conference champion. The tournament champions receive the Mason Cup.\nThe tournament has had a variety of formats.\nThe tournament was first hosted at the St. Louis Arena in St. Louis, Missouri with Ohio State winning the inaugural tournament. Michigan State won the most CCHA Men's Ice Hockey Tournaments with eleven while Michigan appeared in the most championship game appearances with seventeen. Ron Mason has coached thirteen championship teams, more than any other CCHA coach, and also has the most championship game appearances as coach with seventeen. The Joe Louis Arena in Detroit, Michigan hosted the tournament from 1982 to 2013. The St. Louis Arena hosted the tournament six times, while the BGSU Ice Arena in Bowling Green, Ohio and Lakeview Arena in Marquette, Michigan each hosted the championship game twice.\nIn the final championship tournament of the original CCHA in 2013, Notre Dame defeated Michigan.\nIn February 2020, seven schools that had announced their departures from the Western Collegiate Hockey Association, effective after the 2020–21 season, announced they would start play in a new CCHA in 2021–22. Four of these schools had played in the final season of the original CCHA, and a fifth had briefly been a member.\nThe CCHA tournament resumed in 2022 with a new format in which all games are played at campus sites. Specifically, the first round consists of best-of-three series, with all games hosted by the higher seed in each matchup; the semifinals are single games hosted by the top two surviving seeds; and the final is also a single game hosted by the highest remaining seed."

        "text": "New Ross Golf Club is an Irish golf club founded in 1905 and based in Tinneranny, New Ross, County Wexford, Ireland. The club's slogan is \"A Pleasure to Play\".\nHistory.\nThe land for a nine-hole golf course was acquired on Mockler's estate at Castle Annaghs, under a lease with a seven-year duration. The course was briefly relocated to the estate of Reggie Jeffares at Tinneranny in 1917, but follow Jeffares death in 1918, that lease was not renewed. The course was reopened at Annaghs in 1926 before that lease was terminated, and another course was laid out at Chilcomb Park, the present site of the Albatross factory. In 1928, the Land Commission acquired the Jeffares estate, and the Club had a permanent home under a sporting lease until 1983, when the member agreed to buy the property outright.\nThe period from 1991 to 1997 was probably the most progressive period in the historical development of New Ross Golf Club. In 1992, the club was among the first member clubs to grant equal rights to women. Plans were drafted to build the current clubhouse in 1997. The clubhouse was completed and opened to members in 1998.\nIn 2005, its centenary year, it was decided to redesign the 11th hole building a brand new green. The 18th green was also re-designed. Further redevelopment of the 12th, 13th, 15th and 16th greens commenced in September 2008 and is due to be completed and open to play in May 2009.\nThe Course.\nThe back nine has been in play for over a hundred years while the front nine has been in play since 1995. The new nine was designed by Des Smyth (2006 Ryder Cup Vice-Captain) and Declan Brannigan, and is an example of modern design with old style golfing values. In the far distance forming a spectacular backdrop to the 11th green lies the fifteen mile stretch of the Blackstairs Mountains from Dranagh to Mount Leinster, separating counties Carlow and Wexford.\nIn 2009, the club won the Association of Land Contractors of Ireland Award after redesigning four new greens on its course."

        "text": "The Diamond League is an annual series of elite track and field athletic competitions comprising fifteen of the best invitational athletics meetings. The series sits in the top tier of the World Athletics (formerly known as the IAAF) one-day meeting competitions.\nThe inaugural season was in 2010. It was designed to replace the IAAF Golden League, which had been held annually since 1998. The full sponsorship name is the Wanda Diamond League, the result of an agreement with Wanda Group that was announced in December 2019.\nWhile the Golden League was formed to increase the profile of the leading European athletics competitions, the Diamond League's aim is to \"enhance the worldwide appeal of athletics by going outside Europe for the first time.\" In addition to the original Golden League members (except Berlin) and other traditional European competitions, the series now includes events in China, Qatar, Morocco, and the United States.\nBeginning in March 2022, after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Diamond League excluded Russian and Belarusian athletes from all of its track and field meetings.\nEditions.\nThe number in the table represents the order in which the meeting took place.\nIn March 2019 the president of the IAAF, Sebastian Coe, announced changes in the Diamond League's format for the 2020 series. The number of Diamond Disciplines was reduced from 32 to 24 and a second Chinese meet was added to the calendar. The dual final format was replaced by a single final. However, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, 7 of the originally planned 15 meets were cancelled, the season was delayed to June 10, only four or the meets had a full competitive program, and the final was cancelled with no champions crowned in 2020.\nIn December 2020, the 2021 Diamond League was announced to return with 32 disciplines and a two-hour broadcast window.\nScoring system.\nThe original Diamond League scoring system, used from 2010 to 2015, awarded points to the top three athletes at each meeting (4 points for first place; 2 points for second place; 1 point for third place). Each of the thirty-two disciplines (sixteen each for male and female athletes) was staged a total of seven times during the season; points scored in the final meeting for that discipline (either Zürich or Brussels) were doubled. The athletes who finished the season with the highest number of points in their discipline won the \"Diamond Race\"; in case of a tie on points, the number of victories was used as the first tie-breaker, followed by the results of the final. Only athletes who competed in their discipline's final meeting were eligible to win the Diamond Race. In 2016 scoring was expanded to the top six (10–6–4–3–2–1); double points (20–12–8–6–4–2) were still awarded in the event finals.\nA completely new system was introduced in 2017; the top eight athletes at each meeting are now awarded points (8–7–6–5–4–3–2–1), but these points only determine which athletes qualify for the discipline finals in Zürich and Brussels. The athletes who win at the finals are declared IAAF Diamond League Champions, and the allocation of the overall prize money is likewise determined solely by the results of the final. This system, with the winner of the final automatically winning the overall championship, is similar to the former IAAF Grand Prix circuit with its Grand Prix Final. As part of the scoring changes, the term 'Diamond Race' is no longer used. Instead, athletes compete in 'Diamond Disciplines' to become the Diamond League champion.\nAfter the 2019 season, the final format changed from being held by two separate meets to one meet.\nMeetings.\nAll meetings since the event's inauguration have been held in the Northern Hemisphere in spring and summer months, in line with the traditional international track and field season.\nNotes.\nAthing Mu won the final as a national wild card so she was ineligible to win the Diamond League title, which went to runner-up Keely Hodgkinson"

Their final such game, against the West Indians at Eastbourne in late August 1928, was notable for the 261 not out scored by John Knott in the second innings.\nThe club no longer plays fixtures considered first class, but it does maintain annual fixtures against MCC, Hurlingham Cricket Club, and Cambridge's counterpart club, the Quidnuncs Cricket Club, as well as the Oxford University CC."

In 2012, according to International Rugby Board figures, there were over 160,000 registered rugby union players in Sri Lanka, making it the second largest rugby-playing nation in Asia, behind Japan.\nGoverning body.\nThe Sri Lankan Rugby Football Union (SLRFU) is the governing body in the country. The Sri Lankan Football Union (as Ceylon Rugby Football Union) was founded in 1908, the first Rugby Union in Asia. The SLRFU joined the IRB in 1988.\nIn March 2011 the IRB stripped the SLRFU of full member status after it failed to conduct board elections in accordance with the By-Laws, the SLRFU's full membership however was subsequently re-instated follows the successful completion of the Union’s Annual General Meeting and Board elections.\nHistory.\nEarly years: 1879-1945.\nSri Lanka discovered the game of rugby at the same time as India, and the first rugby club, the Colombo Football Club, was founded in Sri Lanka in 1879 (in 1896 the Colombo Football Club amalgamated with the Colombo Hockey Club to become the Colombo Hockey and Football Club). The first rugby match played between two selected teams occurred on 30 June that year between Colombo and a 'World' Team.\nThe first ever club game to be played was on 7 September 1880 between Dickoya MCC and Dimbulla ACC at Darawella, with Dickoya winning the game by 9 points to 3.\nIn 1885 E. H. Joseph became the first Ceylonese to represent an English School in Cricket and Rugby.\nIn 1891 rugby was introduced to the country's high schools by L. E. Blaze, the first principal of Kingswood College, Kandy. Kingswood played the first high school rugby match in the country against their hometown rivals Trinity College in 1906. The match resulted in a draw, 6-all.\nThe nation's first 'national' match involved an All Ceylon team playing against the professional All Blacks (the New Zealand rugby league team) under rugby union rules on their 1907–1908 New Zealand rugby tour of Australia and Great Britain on 12 September 1907. The professional all blacks won the match 33-6. The professional All Blacks only played upon being guaranteed a fee of 50 pounds, this resulted in English Rugby Football Union banning its member countries from playing representative matches in Ceylon.\nAs a result, in 1908 the Australia national rugby union team passed through the Port of Colombo on their way to England via the Suez Canal, without playing a game in Ceylon. The only solution to ensure matches against foreign teams during their brief stopovers at the Colombo was the formation of a National Rugby Union, affiliated to the English Rugby Football Union. On 10 August 1908 an historic meeting of the Ceylon Rugby Football Union (Ceylon RFU) was held at the Grand Orient Hotel in Colombo, with the representatives from Colombo HC &amp; FC, Uva Gymkhana Club, Kelani Valley Club, Kandy Rovers, Dickoya Maskeliya Cricket Club and Dimbula Athletic &amp; Cricket Club. H. B. T. Bourcher (the representative from Uva) was elected as the first president of the Union with J. G. Cruickshank elected honorary secretary. Boucher held the chairman's position until 1914 but Cruickshank resigned from the post in 1910.\nOn 20 August 1910, an exhibition rugby match was held between a team from the 2nd Leicestershire Regiment and a combined Ceylon team.\nIn 1922 the first rugby club to include Ceylonese players, Ceylonese Rugby &amp; Football Club, was formed.\nThe country's first involvement in a rugby tournament was in 1926 when Ceylon RFU sent an all-Ceylon team (composed entirely of Europeans) to compete in the All India Rugby tournament (originally known as the Madras Presidency Rugby tournament) held in Madras. It was also the maiden overseas tour by a rugby team from Sri Lanka. In 1928 the team tied for the championship and in 1929, under the captaincy of J. D. Farquharson, they won it outright defeating Madras by 11 points to 8. In 1932 they won the cup for the second time defeating Calcutta. At the 1938 tournament the Ceylon RFU fielded two teams one wholly comprising Europeans and the other Ceylonese. The Ceylonese team making history, when in their first match they defeated a combined Planters team by 16 points to nil. The Ceylon RFU ceased participating in the competition in the late 1960s.\nDuring this time the game of rugby flourished in Ceylon mainly due to the plantations companies’ enthusiasm and commitment to promote rugby in the country.\nThe 1930 (which the British Lions won 45–0) and the 1950 British Lions tour to New Zealand and Australia (again a loss 44–6), also played unofficial matches in Ceylon on their way home from tours of New Zealand and Australia.\n1945 onwards.\nIn the post-WWII period, S. Muthiah campaigned for the sports introduction into the national police service.\nIn 1938 the Western Australia Rugby Union sent a representative side to tour Ceylon, playing five matches against Up Country, Low Country, All Ceylon, Ceylonese and All Colombo. The side won three out of their four matches (Low-Country 11-9, Up-Country 24-3, Ceylonese 16-6) losing to All Ceylon 12-3.\nIn 1953 an Australian Colts side toured Ceylon defeating Colombo 35–11, All-Ceylon 39-nil, Up-Country 32-3, the Barbarians 30–3 and All-Ceylon 11-3.\n1955 the New Zealand Colts team toured the island winning against a combined Colombo team 35–5, Up Country 24-3, All Ceylon 35–nil and against the Barbarians, 33-nil.\nIn 1957 the Australian Colts team returned for a second tour beating Low-Country 14-9, Up-Country 43–nil, All-Ceylon 21-nil, the Barbarians 22-nil and All-Ceylon 37–3.\nIn 1959 a combined Oxford and Cambridge team competed against Colombo 41-nil, All-Ceylon 37-3, Up-Country 52-nil, the Barbarians 55-nil and 45–nil against All-Ceylon.\nA British Joint Services (Far East) team in 1964 defeated Ceylon Services 16–5 and against a President’s XV 14-6. The British Joint Services returned in 1966 and again defeated Ceylon Services 39-nil and the President's XV 6-3.\nThe British Joint Services toured for a third time in 1968 beating All-Ceylon 14-12. That year a combined All-India team lost to All-Ceylon 18-19.\nIn 1968 four clubs sides were invited to participate in the All India Rugby Tournament, Havelock SC, Police SC, CH &amp; FC and CR &amp; FC against four Indian teams, Calcutta, Madras, Armenians and Maharashtra Police. C.R &amp; FC were the eventual winners defeating Havelock SC by 8 points to 6 in the final.\nIn December 1973 the Ceylon RFU was renamed the Sri Lankan Rugby Football Union (SLRFU). The SLRFU was admitted into the IRB in 1988, as a member of the Asian Rugby Football Union.\nRecent events.\nSri Lanka is considered one of the rugby's success stories, despite a modest win record on the international stage. Crowds of forty or fifty thousand have attended club games. Sri Lanka's problems have been threefold: firstly, a lack of finance, secondly, third world infrastructure, and thirdly, the country has been war-torn for a number of years.\nCarlton Super Sevens.\nThe Carlton Super Sevens series, a domestic club competition comprising two tournaments hosted on consecutive weekends, began in 2011. The series was contested by ten teams, representing the nine provinces of the country and the Jaffna region. Tournament events were hosted at various locations, including Kandy, Galle and Koggola, and the final leg of the series for each season was held in Colombo. Prominent players from around the world were contracted to join each local franchise to raise the standard of competition. With the return of the Sri Lanka Sevens international tournament for 2015, the Carlton Super Sevens series ceased after the 2014 season. \nSerendib Cup.\nIn 2013, Colombo hosted the Serendib International Cup, a tournament for emerging nations which involved Sri Lanka as hosts and the Malagasy and Polish national teams. The competition was backed by the International Rugby Board and played over three match days at Colombo Racecourse between 26 October and 1 November, coinciding with the 2013 end-of-year rugby union tests. There were plans to expand the Serendib International Cup in future years to include 16-24 teams, but the tournament did not survive beyond the inaugural event. \nNotable players.\nNotable Sri Lankan players include Len Saverimutto, who is the father of scrum half Christian Saverimutto, who was capped three times for Ireland in the 1995–96 season. Mahesh Rodrigo was a dual international and represented Sri Lanka in the national cricket team; he was a scrum half, and captained the Ceylon XV.\nNational teams.\nMen.\nSri Lanka has yet to qualify for the Rugby World Cup, however the national team has enjoyed success in recent years, rising to 37th on the world rankings in 2015.\nThe team is currently ranked fourth in Asia and competes in Division One of the Asian Five Nations.\nSri Lanka also has a national sevens team, which is ranked fourth in Asia.\nWomen.\nAlthough Sri Lanka's women have not yet played test match rugby, they have been playing international sevens rugby since 2003, with the team debuting at Hong Kong and reaching ninth place in the tournament. In 2005 the Sri Lanka women’s team won the Bowl final at the Asian Sevens held in Singapore. In 2013 and again in 2014 the team won the Plate final at the Asian Championships in Thailand (defeating Singapore, 17-5) and in Hong Kong (defeating Thailand, 19-14), the best results the team has achieved to date. – \"See: Current playing record\"\nInternational competitions hosted.\nSri Lanka currently hosts the Sri Lanka Sevens tournament but has previously held other international events. – \"See: Serendib International Cup\"\nSri Lanka Sevens.\nThe Sri Lanka Sevens is an annual international rugby sevens competition that is currently (since 2015) played in Colombo at the Racecourse Sports Complex. The tournament was originally sponsored as the Singer Sri Lankan Airlines Rugby 7s from 1999 to 2008 and hosted in Kandy. It was rebranded as the Carlton Sri Lanka Sevens and moved to Colombo for 2009 and 2010 when the Carlton Sports Club – Tharunyata Hetak's sports wing – took over the running of the tournament in partnership with the Sri Lanka Rugby Football Union. From 2011 to 2014 it was transformed into a local club competition, the Carlton Super 7s, comprising two tournaments held on consecutive weekends. The international team format was revived for 2015 when the Sri Lanka Sevens tournament, now called the Colombo Sevens, was re-established and included as part of the Asian Sevens Series.\nDomestic club competitions.\nThe two top-level competitions for rugby union teams in Sri Lanka are the Dialog Rugby League and the Clifford Cup. Previously there was also a series for rugby sevens teams; held from 2011 until 2014. – \"See: Carlton Super Sevens\"\nNippon Paint Rugby League.\nThe major club competition in Sri Lanka is the Nippon Paint Rugby League. It is currently sponsored by Nippon Paints. The 'A' Division features nine teams, which compete on a home and away basis. The League Competition was sponsored by Caltex between 2000 and 2010. In 2006 the Navy SC withdrew from the competition, due to their members military commitments. The club rejoined the competition in 2009 with the Old Zahirians Sporting Club being forced to leave. In 2012 the competition was expanded with the inclusion of a team from Nawalapitiya, the Upcountry Lions, the following year a further team from Hambantota, the Hambantota Sharks was included. Both clubs only played in two seasons of the 'A' Division.\nClifford Cup.\nThe most prestigious club knockout tournament in Sri Lanka is the Clifford Cup. It commenced in 1911, as a competition between the mercantile executives in Colombo and planters in the hill country. The Clifford Cup was awarded by Lady Elizabeth Clifford, wife of the then Governor Sir Hugh Clifford. The competition has been played amongst eight clubs with 79 seasons played over 100 years.\nInter-school competitions.\nInter-school rugby boasts a rich history in Sri Lanka, with Kingswood College in Kandy standing as the pioneer. It was in 1891 that rugby was introduced to schools in Sri Lanka, then known as Ceylon, and this credit goes to the esteemed Sri Lankan educator, Mr. Louis Edmund Blaze. Notably, he not only founded the institution but also assumed the role of its inaugural principal.\nIn 1906, a milestone was achieved as Kingswood College and Trinity College competed in the inaugural inter-school rugby match, resulting in a 6-all draw.\nSchools Rugby League.\nThe focal point of the yearly inter-school rugby schedule is the Schools Rugby League, officially designated the Dialog Schools Rugby League due to sponsorship by Dialog Axiata. This event is coordinated by the Sri Lanka Schools Rugby Football Association in partnership with Sri Lanka Rugby.\nThis event highlights schoolboys in the under-19 age group competing for honours across three divisions: Division 1, 2, and 3. Division 1 and 2 have been additionally divided into three and two tiers respectively, namely Division 1 – Segments A, B, and C, and Division 2 – Segments A and B. In the 2023 season, more than 70 school teams took part in these three divisions.\nFor the 2024 season, Division 1 – Segments A, B, and C will include the following participating school teams.\nSchools Rugby\nDivision 1 – Segment A\nDivision 1 – Segment B\nDivision 1 – Segment C\nOther tournaments.\nThe customary opening events of the inter-school rugby season are the seven-a-side rugby tournaments organized by the SLSRFA, namely the All Island Under 18 Rugby Sevens and the Under 19 School’s Elite Rugby 7s.\nThe primary inter-school knockout rugby competition is the Dialog Schools Rugby Knockout Tournament, commonly referred to as the President’s Trophy. It features eligible teams from the Division 1 – Segment A league. Teams that qualify from the Division 1 – Segment B and C leagues contend for the Premier Trophy and the Chairman’s Trophy respectively.\nApart from the under 19 age group rugby, the SLSRFA also organises tournaments spanning various age levels and involving numerous schools.\nTraditional inter-school rugby fixtures.\nAlongside the primary tournaments in the inter-school rugby calendar, traditional fixtures between schools have also taken place. These fixtures are held either as part of the league or as standalone events, sparking significant interest among their respective supporters.\nSome of the more noteworthy encounters include: \nAmong the array of traditional fixtures, the fixture that holds the most prominent status within the rugby community in Sri Lanka and beyond is the Bradby Shield Encounter. This fiercely contested encounter takes place annually between Royal College and Trinity College since 1945, following a two-legged system. The victor of the competition is determined by the aggregate scores from both matches, which are usually played a few weeks apart.\nRugby union stadiums in Sri Lanka.\nThis is a list with stadiums in Sri Lanka which are used for rugby union. A capacity of 5,000 or higher is required."

        "title": "Johns Hopkins–Maryland lacrosse rivalry",
        "text": "The Johns Hopkins–Maryland lacrosse rivalry is an intercollegiate rivalry between the Johns Hopkins Blue Jays, which represent Johns Hopkins University, and the Maryland Terrapins, which represent the University of Maryland. The most prominent event has been the men's lacrosse series, which is widely regarded as one of the greatest rivalries in the sport. More than 115 contests in the series have been played since the schools first met in 1895. The competition is intensified by each program's status as a traditional lacrosse powerhouse. As such, the game has often held national championship implications, and twice the teams played to represent the United States in the Olympics.\nThe schools currently meet only in lacrosse, as all other Johns Hopkins athletics fall under NCAA Division III and all Maryland athletics are Division I. From the late 19th into the 20th century, however, their football teams also competed regularly. More recently, the schools have played in women's lacrosse.\nNCAA alignment.\nIn 1973, the National Collegiate Athletic Association instituted a three-tier classification system, which created Division I, Division II, and Division III. The third tier, Division III, is the one in which no athletic scholarships are awarded to student-athletes. Johns Hopkins, as a perennial lacrosse power, chose to continue competition in Division I in that sport, while all of its other athletic teams were relegated to Division III. In 2004, the NCAA upheld the decision to allow Division III schools to \"play up\", and grant scholarships, in a sport at the Division I level (usually ice hockey). Since Maryland competes strictly at the Division I level, the two schools currently meet only in men's and women's lacrosse.\nMen's lacrosse.\nBackground.\nBoth schools call the rivalry the greatest and most historic in men's lacrosse. \"Sports Illustrated\" ranked it among the best all-time college rivalries, and before the teams' 100th meeting, called it \"the equivalent of Michigan–Ohio State in football.\" A 2003 Harris Interactive poll found that Marylanders considered it the state's fourth biggest rivalry after the Cowboys–Redskins, Ravens–Redskins, and Duke–Maryland. The Hopkins–Maryland all-time record differs based upon whether games played before Maryland had a varsity team are counted. Johns Hopkins recognizes those games and records the series as 71–43–1 in its own favor. Maryland, however, recognizes only games played since the formation of their varsity team in 1924, which puts the all-time record at 64–43–1, also in favor of Hopkins.\nThe rivalry, which is the oldest in the sport, is fueled by history, competitiveness, and cultural implication. Both schools are located in the state of Maryland, a historical hotbed for lacrosse, and have traditionally been two of the sport's powerhouses. Many of the opposing players have had past associations in grade school, high school, or youth club sports. Hopkins' former coach and former player Dave Pietramala said, \"Everybody knew each other; we had all played together at some point or another. It was a fierce, intense game and there was no love lost on the field.\" Additionally, Johns Hopkins is a private university, while Maryland is a public institution. Former Terrapins coach Dick Edell said:\"To get the juices flowing before the game, [we'd tell the Maryland] kids that it was the blue-collar guys against the future executives—that this was their only chance to get them before they got into the real world. Plus, you have all the kids who came from the same high school, or worked the camps together, so there was that closeness that you have to live with for the other 364 days, no matter who wins.\"\nEarly years.\nThe two teams first played in 1895 and met six more times through 1923. In those early matches, Johns Hopkins scored a combined sixty points to Maryland's three. In 1924, Maryland fielded its first varsity-level lacrosse team, which defeated Hopkins, 4–2, but the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA) awarded the Blue Jays the co-national championship (along with Syracuse). Since that season, the teams have met annually with the exception of a two-year hiatus due to World War II. Johns Hopkins won three straight national titles from 1926 to 1928, where each season culminated with a victory over Maryland. In 1928, Maryland had a perfect 9–0 record until Johns Hopkins defeated the Terps in the season finale, 6–3. At season's end, a single-elimination tournament was held to determine which team would represent the United States in a trial lacrosse competition during the Summer Olympics. Maryland defeated Navy and Rutgers to advance to the final game, where they were again bested by Johns Hopkins.\nThe following season, the Terrapins embarked upon a three-year run in which they lost only four games, and they defeated the Blue Jays each season including a shutout, 6–0, in 1930. In 1932, however, Hopkins defeated Maryland twice during the regular season and once more in a postseason game to decide participation in the Olympics. Between 1930 and 1934, the Blue Jays won three national championships and lost only two games, both of which were to the Terrapins. Maryland captured national titles in 1936, 1937, and 1939. That year, however, Hopkins managed to break a four-game losing streak against them. The Terrapins won the 1940 title by beating the undefeated Blue Jays, 7–6, in the series' first game decided by one goal. Maryland finished the season with a perfect 10–0 record. The following year, Hopkins finished 12–0 and captured the national championship after a convincing victory over Maryland, 10–3. Johns Hopkins secured four more national titles from 1947 to 1950, and defeated Maryland each year, three times by a margin of at least six goals.\nSeveral days before the game in 1947, Hopkins supporters stole \"Testudo\", a 300-pound bronze statue of a diamondback terrapin, from the Maryland campus. Approximately 200 Terrapins fans drove to Baltimore to retrieve it, and a riot erupted before the city police intervened. The Hopkins dean ordered the students to return the statue, which they did after painting a blue 'H' on its back.\nMaryland dominance.\nIn the 1950s, the two teams won a combined six national championships, with Maryland dominating the first part of the decade and Johns Hopkins the latter. Between 1951 and 1956, Maryland posted a 5–0–1 record against Hopkins, with three games won by at least six points. The Terps won consecutive national titles in 1955 and 1956, while posting a combined record of 21–0. In 1957, the Blue Jays snapped the Terrapins' 31-game winning streak with an upset win, 15–10. Two years later, both teams shared the national title with Army. Between 1955 and 1959, Maryland compiled a 48–3 record, with all three losses at the hands of Johns Hopkins.\nIn 1960, Navy became the first team other than Hopkins to defeat Maryland since 1954. That same year marked the start of Navy's eight-year national championship streak that lasted through 1967. That season, Navy beat Maryland 10–8, before traveling to Homewood Field. There, Johns Hopkins upset Navy, 9–6, for the first time in their last ten meetings. The Blue Jays and Terrapins met for the season finale where Hopkins needed a victory to win the national title outright. Maryland acted as a spoiler, however, and beat Johns Hopkins, 9–5, to take a share of the championship. Hopkins went on to win or share the next four national titles.\nAdvent of the NCAA tournament.\nIn 1971, the NCAA replaced the USILA as the awarding authority for the men's lacrosse championship with the introduction of a tournament. Since then, the Blue Jays and Terrapins have appeared in the finals a combined 27 times and have met each other in the finals three times. In 1972, Maryland beat Johns Hopkins in the regular season, 13–12, to earn the number-one seed. The two teams met again in the semifinals, where Hopkins eliminated Maryland, 9–6, and advanced to the finals before losing to Virginia by one goal. The following two years, Hopkins and Maryland met in the finals.\nIn 1973, Maryland routed Hopkins during the regular season, 17–4. That year's Terrapins, led by future Hall of Fame inductee and four-time All-American Frank Urso, are considered one of the all-time best college lacrosse teams and averaged almost 18 goals a game. When the teams met in the championship game, however, the Blue Jays employed a possession game to offset Maryland's offensive firepower, and the first shot on goal did not take place until 8:38. At halftime, Johns Hopkins had taken a 5–2 lead. Time expired with the score tied, 9–9, which forced the game into overtime. Urso scored for the Terrapins to take a 10–9 lead and Maryland goalie Bill O'Donnell made several impressive saves to secure the win.\nThe following year, Maryland was again named the top-seed, despite having lost to second-seed Johns Hopkins during the regular season. In the championship game, Hopkins quickly took the lead, led by Hall of Fame attackman Jack Thomas and entered halftime with a 10–4 advantage. In the second half, Maryland outscored them 8–7, but the effort fell short. In 1975, Maryland defeated Hopkins, 19–11, before winning the national title, and won again the following year, 21–13, on their way to finish as national championship runners-up after an overtime loss to Cornell in the final. In 1977, the Blue Jays edged the Terrapins, 21–20, in the regular season and began a run in the series. Hopkins eliminated Maryland in the tournament semifinals in both 1977 and 1978, before beating them in the 1979 championship game at home in College Park, Maryland. During that game, the Blue Jays were able to limit the Terrapins' second all-time leading scorer and 1979 attackman of the year Bob Boneillo. During the 1970s, Maryland participated in six NCAA title games, including four in a row from 1973 to 1976. During that span, the Terps won two national titles and lost four.\nHopkins dominance.\nDuring the 1980s, Johns Hopkins dominated the series, winning 12 of 13 games, including nine by an average margin of 5.6 points. During this period Hopkins, led by head coach Henry Ciccarone, won three national titles. By 1987, Maryland's fourth-year head coach Dick Edell had helped revitalize the Terrapins as a national power. Maryland posted an 11–0 record during the regular season, where the win over Hopkins, 11–7, was the only game decided by less than six goals. In the NCAA tournament, Maryland defeated Penn in the quarterfinals, 12–8, and advanced to again meet Hopkins in the semifinals. Despite having recorded its first three-loss season in over a decade, and having edged North Carolina in the quarterfinals, the Blue Jays upset the Terrapins, 13–8. Hopkins, led by goalkeeper Quint Kessenich, advanced to win the national title against then undefeated Cornell in the final.\nRelative parity.\nIn 1995, Johns Hopkins narrowly retained an undefeated regular season by winning four one-goal games, which included an edging of Maryland, 16–15. Hopkins entered the tournament as the number-one seed, and again met Maryland in the semifinals. Edell helped guide the Terps to an early lead, and they ended the half with an advantage, 10–4, with the final result a rout, 16–8. The performance of Maryland goalie Brian Dougherty earned him the title of the tournament's Most Outstanding Player, despite the Terps' loss in the final against Syracuse.\nThe following season, Maryland earned a number-two seeding after defeating Hopkins, 12–9. The teams met again in the tournament quarterfinals, where, playing at home, Hopkins gained a 7–0 lead against heavily favored Maryland. The Terrapins rallied, but the Blue Jays held them off to preserve victory, 9–7. In 1998 at Homewood Field, Hopkins upset first-ranked Maryland, 10–6 during the regular season. This time when they met in the tournament quarterfinals, Maryland had the homefield advantage at Byrd Stadium. The Terps led 10–6 in the fourth quarter before the Blue Jays rallied to force overtime. Maryland, however, won the ensuing faceoff and scored after several shots on goal, never allowing Hopkins to gain possession of the ball. The Terps eventually advanced to the final, where they were defeated by Princeton.\nRecent years.\nFrom 2001 to 2003, each match-up was decided by one goal. Maryland won coach Dick Edell's final, and Hopkins coach Dave Pietramala's first, game of the series in 2001. The Blue Jays won the following two seasons, with both games decided in overtime. In 2004, the teams played their 100th anniversary game and both sides wore special \"throwback\" jerseys. Hopkins scored five times before the first television timeout, then took an 8–1 first period lead on the way to a victory, 14–10. Hopkins extended their streak to four wins in 2005, before Maryland's new head coach Dave Cottle took away his first victory in 2006. In 2009, the teams played in the inaugural Day of Rivals double-header, where Hopkins preserved victory, 10–9, when a final-second Maryland shot on the crease was deflected. The two met for the event again in 2010, with Maryland coming out on top, 10–9, due in part to a perfect four-for-four extra-man offense.\nThe rivalry became a conference matchup in the 2014–15 academic year when both schools joined the new men's lacrosse league formed by Maryland's new all-sports home, the Big Ten Conference, with Johns Hopkins as an associate member. The first Big Ten game between the two was an upset for Johns Hopkins 15–12 with a rematch in NCAA semi-finals May 22, 2015 at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia which went to Maryland 12–11.\nStarting in 2015, the regular season winner of the game has been awarded \"The Rivalry Trophy\". It is a crab-shaped trophy, crafted by Sandtown Millworks, made using reclaimed wood from Baltimore. It weighs 25 pounds and measures 32 inches wide and 22 inches tall.\nThe 2020 game scheduled for April 25, 2020 at Baltimore, Maryland was canceled by the NCAA due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Maryland was 5-1 after their last game against Albany on March 7, 2020, while Hopkins was 2-4 after their OT win again Mt. St. Mary's on March 10, 2020. In April 2020, athletic director Jennifer S. Baker announced Hopkins and head coach Dave Pietramala mutually agreed to part ways as the university looked to \"move the program in a different direction,\" after Pietramala had coached the Jays for 20 years and set a career record of 207–93.\"\nRival accomplishments.\nThe following summarizes the accomplishments of the two programs.\nWomen's lacrosse.\nThe Johns Hopkins and Maryland women's lacrosse teams first played in 1979 in Arnold, Maryland, a game which the Lady Terps won handily, 17–1. They did not meet again until after the Johns Hopkins women's team was promoted from Division III to Division I in 1999. The following year, the teams met and played each season through 2009, but did not play again until 2015. As of the last meeting between the teams in 2019, the Maryland women held a perfect record against Hopkins, having won all 19 meetings by a combined margin of 298–153.\nHopkins and Maryland became conference rivals in women's lacrosse in the 2016–17 school year when Hopkins joined the Big Ten for that sport. The first Big Ten game between the two was accordingly played in 2017.\nRival accomplishments.\nThe following summarizes the accomplishments of the two programs."

        "title": "History of rugby union matches between Argentina and France",
        "text": "France's national rugby union team first played Argentina in 1949 when they undertook a two-test tour of the latter country. France won both matches. Argentina did not manage a win over France until their 16th meeting in 1985, under the captaincy of Hugo Porta.\nFrance has been Argentina's most frequent Test match opponent. France played a significant role in the early development of Argentine rugby in which the two countries played each other 13 times between 1949 and 1977. In total, the two countries have met 51 times, with France winning 36 games, Argentina 14 and one game is drawn. \nThe teams have played each other three times at Rugby World Cup tournaments: In 1999 France won a quarter-final, and in 2007 Argentina beat France 17–12 in the tournament-opening pool game and again 34–10 in the playoff for third and fourth place after Argentina had lost to tournament winners South Africa in the semi-final. Even though Argentina had shown strong form in the year leading up to the tournament (winning 10 of 13 Test matches plus a one-point loss to France), the opening-game win was regarded as an upset by the media.\nThough about two-thirds of the games have been played on Argentina's ground, France has won more than two-thirds of them. France won the only match the two have played on neutral ground.\nThe biggest difference in points was achieved by France during the second game of their 2012 tour to Argentina, winning 49–10.\nSince 2000, the series has been especially closely fought, though Argentina has had the upper hand. In the 19 matches played in that time frame, the Pumas are 10–9, but nine of the matches were decided by a converted try (7 points) or less.\nWhen the IRB introduced their world team rankings system in 2003, Argentina was ranked seventh and France fifth. Since then the ranking changed frequently and the two teams' order was reversed many times like in March 2009, when Argentina climbed to fourth place and France fell to seventh. Most recently, following Argentina's win in the first of their two-Test series in June 2012, the two teams switched places in the rankings with the Pumas in sixth and France in seventh but after their second game a week later, which saw France won by 39 points, France climbed back to the 5th place and Argentina drop to eighth."

The tournament was held between 6 February and 20 March 2010.\nThe championship was contested by England, France, Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales. France won the tournament, achieving a final 12–10 victory over England to win the Grand Slam, their first since 2004 and ninth overall (including six in the Five Nations). This was also their 17th outright victory, including 12 victories in the Five Nations, excluding eight titles shared with other countries. France also retained the Giuseppe Garibaldi Trophy by defeating Italy in the tournament, to whom they had (then) never lost within the Six Nations.\nIreland, 2009 Grand Slam winners, came second with three victories and two defeats. Despite defeating England and Wales, Ireland failed to win the Triple Crown after a 23–20 defeat to Scotland in their final match. England and Wales came third and fourth respectively with two victories each, while Scotland and Italy finished in fifth and sixth positions for the third tournament in a row. Both teams achieved just one victory each, with Scotland also recording a draw in the Calcutta Cup match against England to place ahead of Italy.\nSummary.\nThe reigning champions on entering the tournament were Ireland, who won the Grand Slam and Triple Crown in 2009.\nIreland did not win the Triple Crown in 2010 due to a surprise 23–20 loss to Scotland in the final Six Nations match at Croke Park on 20 March, with Scotland avoiding their third \"wooden spoon\" since 2004 in the process. Brian O'Driscoll had opened the scoring in the 11th minute and Ireland were level with Scotland in the 64th minute after Tommy Bowe scored a try, with substitute Ronan O'Gara converting. Scotland's Johnnie Beattie scored his team's first try since they played Wales in their second game and Dan Parks scored a penalty in the final minute to prevent Ireland winning the Triple Crown. Ireland coach Declan Kidney described it as \"not our greatest day\".\nIreland's previous match – a 27–12 victory over Wales on 13 March – had seen O'Driscoll achieve 100 caps for his country. Ireland's previous match against England had seen John Hayes achieve 100 caps for his country, the first player to do so for Ireland.\nIreland's loss to Scotland meant France had won the Championship but could still achieve the Grand Slam by beating England in their final game at the Stade de France on 20 March. The Grand Slam was achieved by France following a 12–10 victory in this game. It was France's first Grand Slam since 2004. England scored the only try of the game. Jonny Wilkinson was not included in the England starting team for only the third time in his career. Bryce Lawrence from New Zealand refereed the game.\nThe nominations for \"Player of the Championship\" were announced on 17 March; these were Tommy Bowe (Ireland), Mathieu Bastareaud, Morgan Parra, Thierry Dusautoir, Imanol Harinordoquy (all France) and Shane Williams (Wales). Ireland captain Brian O'Driscoll, who had won the award in three of the four previous seasons, was not included this time. Tommy Bowe was named as the player of the championship on 25 March, having polled nearly 50% of the fan votes.\nResults.\nThe schedule for the 2010 Championship was released on 2 April 2009. Following the success of the tournament's first Friday night game, between France and Wales in the 2009 Championship, the organisers scheduled the reverse fixture to also be played on a Friday night.\nRound 3.\nNotes:"

After his sporting career he has concentrated on his profession as an estate agent and chartered surveyor.\nEarly life.\nRichard Harding was born in Bristol. He attended Millfield School from 1968 to 1971, where he became head of house at Shapwick Manor; his nickname there was \"Gilbert\". He went on to study Land Economy at St John's College, Cambridge, graduating with a BA in the subject in 1975.\nRugby career.\nRichard Harding played rugby union at school and whilst at Cambridge University earned a Blue. He went on to play for Bristol RFC and was a stalwart of the team during the 1980s where he was also known by the nickname \"Corky\". He was particularly known for his extremely long pass which was used to great effect by Bristol. Harding would pass from a scrum straight to the full back which was intended to leave the opposing fullback flat-footed, allowing a two on one with the opposing wing. Whilst at Bristol he was part of the side who won the 1982–83 John Player Cup Final at Twickenham\nHarding's first cap for England came on Saturday, 5 January 1985 when England played Romania at Twickenham. The match was won by England 22–15. After that match, the position of scrum-half was contested by Harding, Richard Hill and Nigel Melville. Harding gained two more caps in 1985 against France and Scotland at Twickenham both in the Five Nations. In the France game Harding is remembered for his tackle on Patrick Esteve when he knocked the ball out of his hands over the try line. In 1986 he was not capped but returned to the team in 1987 when he was picked to replace the dropped Richard Hill following disciplinary action against the latter following the 1984 England-Wales match in Cardiff on 7 March. Harding played in the final Five Nations match against Scotland and found himself as first choice for the first Rugby World Cup in 1987. He played three of England's four games, (being rested against the USA) but was replaced in the 1988 Five Nations by Melville. He came on as a substitute in the Ireland game, and was picked for the end of season game against Ireland, which was played to celebrate the centenary of Dublin. The 1988 tour of Australia and Fiji saw two scrum-halves included, and Harding was one of them. Harding played in both Australian tests which both ended in defeat. The final test of the tour was to be the first ever test against Fiji. Harding was honoured by being selected as the captain, and England were victorious, 25–10. Harding was the fourth player from Bristol RFC to have been made captain of England. However he soon found himself relegated to third choice scrum-half, behind Hill (making a comeback to the side) and Dewi Morris, who made his debut in the home match against Australia in 1988, and Harding could not force his way back into the England reckoning again.\nEngland Games.\n1985 Friendly v Romania (Twickenham)\n1985 Five Nations Championship v France (Twickenham) v Scotland (Twickenham)\n1987 Five Nations Championship v Scotland (Twickenham)\n1987 World Cup\nv Australia (Sydney) v Japan (Sydney) v Wales (Brisbane)\n1988 Five Nations Championship\nv Ireland (R) (Twickenham)\n1988 Millennium Match\nv Ireland (Dublin)\n1988 Tour Australia &amp; Fiji\nv Australia (Brisbane) v Australia (Sydney) v Fiji (c) (Suva)\nOutside Rugby.\nHarding's background in Land Economy led him to become a Chartered Surveyor and he opened up Richard Harding Estate Agents.

        "text": "Antti Niemi (; born 29 August 1983) is a Finnish former professional ice hockey goaltender. During the 2009–10 season as a member of the Chicago Blackhawks, he became the first Finnish goaltender to win the Stanley Cup. Niemi also played for the San Jose Sharks, Dallas Stars, Pittsburgh Penguins, Florida Panthers, and Montreal Canadiens.\nPlaying career.\nEarly years.\nNiemi played junior-level hockey for Kiekko-Vantaa from 1998 until 2005, where he also worked part-time as a Zamboni driver and later had his number retired. He turned pro with the Pelicans of the Finnish SM-liiga in 2005, playing three seasons with the team. In November 2007, Niemi debuted for the Finnish national team. He then signed with the Chicago Blackhawks of the National Hockey League (NHL) as an undrafted free agent in 2008. Assigned to Chicago's minor league affiliate, the Rockford IceHogs, Niemi spent the majority of the 2008–09 season in the American Hockey League (AHL), alternating starts with Corey Crawford. In February 2009, he was called up to the Blackhawks as an injury replacement. He made his NHL debut on 27 February, playing one period in a 5–4 overtime loss to the Pittsburgh Penguins. Niemi recorded his first NHL start and win several days later on 1 March, a 4–2 victory versus the Los Angeles Kings.\nStanley Cup season with Chicago.\nThe following season, Niemi made the Blackhawks lineup out of training camp. The Blackhawks began their season with a back-to-back season opening series against the Florida Panthers, held in Niemi's native Finland in the city of Helsinki. The first game of the season opener was held 2 October 2009. Niemi started the second game, held on 3 October. In that game, Niemi stopped all 23 shots he faced against the Panthers to earn his first NHL shutout.\nCompiling a very respectable record of 26–7–4 during the regular season, Niemi was named the Blackhawks' starting goaltender for the playoffs near the end of the 2009–10 NHL regular season and prior to the 2010 Stanley Cup playoffs, replacing Cristobal Huet. During game two of the opening series, Niemi recorded a shutout victory against the Nashville Predators at United Center, making him the first Blackhawks goaltender since Ed Belfour in 1996 to record a post-season shutout. \nOn 22 April 2010, Niemi stopped 33 shots to record his second shutout of the post-season, making him the first Chicago goaltender since Tony Esposito in 1974 to record two shutouts in one playoff series. On 16 May 2010, Niemi made 44 saves in a 2–1 victory over the San Jose Sharks in Game 2 of the Western Conference Final. Chicago ended up sweeping the series against San Jose in four games.\nIn only his second Stanley Cup Finals game, Niemi made 32 saves, earning the Player of the Game honors from the NHL. On 9 June 2010, Niemi led the Blackhawks to a Stanley Cup championship with a 4–3 overtime win over the Philadelphia Flyers. Niemi was the third Finnish goaltender to make it to the Stanley Cup Finals and the first ever to win the Cup.\nNiemi filed for arbitration during the off-season, and was eventually awarded $2.75 million. Chicago officially walked away from the deal on 2 August due to salary cap restraints and signed veteran goaltender Marty Turco from the Dallas Stars for $1.3 million.\nSan Jose Sharks.\nOn 2 September 2010, Niemi officially signed a one-year, $2 million contract with the San Jose Sharks. He made 30 saves in his first regular season victory with the Sharks, a 3–2 win over the Columbus Blue Jackets. After a poor start to the season, Niemi was platooned with fellow Finnish netminder Antero Niittymäki, but strong play in the month of February, which saw him go 14–2–1 with a 1.91 goals against average (GAA) and .924 save percentage, cemented him as the Sharks' starting goaltender. On 1 March 2011, Niemi signed a four-year contract extension with San Jose worth $15.2 million. His nickname with the Sharks was \"Nemo.\"\nIn October 2012, Niemi signed a one-month contract with Pelicans in Finland during the 2012–13 NHL lockout. In the 2012–13 season, Niemi led the Sharks in GAA with 2.16, while leading the NHL in minutes played with 2,581, tied for the League lead with 24 wins in 43 starts, along with finishing third in the NHL with 1,127 saves. On 8 May 2013, Niemi was nominated for the Vezina Trophy, but ultimately lost out to Sergei Bobrovsky of the Columbus Blue Jackets. With his prowess in the shootout throughout the season \"The Hockey News\" awarded Niemi the Gilles Villemure Award as the Best Shootout Goalie.\nDallas Stars.\nOn 27 June 2015, the second day of the 2015 NHL Entry Draft, Niemi's rights were traded to the Dallas Stars in exchange for the 193rd pick in the 2015 draft. The Stars signed Niemi, forming a partnership with fellow Finnish starting goaltender Kari Lehtonen, on a three-year deal worth $13.5 million on 29 June. On 8 October 2015, Niemi started the first game of the season for the Dallas Stars instead of longtime starter Lehtonen, posting a 37 save shutout and picking up two assists in the 3–0 Dallas Stars victory over the Pittsburgh Penguins. Niemi and Lehtonen would alternate regularly for the entire season. In the playoffs, Lehtonen was given the first chance as the starting goaltender before Niemi started a few games as well.\nNiemi would continue to alternate with Lehtonen to begin his second season with the Stars in the 2016–17 season. However, Niemi struggled mightily and was relegated to the backup role. Despite winning 12 games, Niemi placed last in the league amongst recorded goaltenders in goals against average and second to last in save percentage. With the Stars missing the post-season and with the acquisition of goaltender Ben Bishop, Niemi was placed on waivers to be bought out from the remaining year of his contract on 26 June 2017.\nPittsburgh Penguins and Florida Panthers.\nOn 1 July 2017, Niemi signed a one-year contract with the Pittsburgh Penguins worth $700,000 for the 2017–18 season. Niemi started three games for the Penguins, during which he allowed 16 goals and recorded a 7.5 goals against average. He was placed on waivers on 23 October.\nOn 24 October, Niemi was claimed off waivers by the Florida Panthers after being waived the previous day. After featuring in just two winless games with the Panthers, and with the return to health of Roberto Luongo, he was placed on waivers once again on 13 November.\nMontreal Canadiens.\nOn 14 November, Niemi was claimed off waivers by the Montreal Canadiens, and became their official backup on 4 January 2018 after the team traded Al Montoya to the Edmonton Oilers.\nNiemi posted a 7–5–4 record and a .929 save percentage in 19 total games with the Canadiens. This career resurgence earned him the Montreal chapter of the Professional Hockey Writers' Association's nomination for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy and a one-year, $950,000 contract extension with the Canadiens. On 15 January 2019, Niemi set a franchise record for most saves in a regular season home game, stopping 52 shots in a 5–1 win over the Panthers, besting the previous mark of 49 saves shared by Jeff Hackett and Carey Price.\nJokerit.\nAs an impending free agent from the Canadiens following the 2018–19 season, Niemi ended his 11-year NHL career, returning to Finland in signing a one-year contract with Jokerit of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) on 5 June 2019. \nInternational play.\nNiemi won a bronze medal at the 2014 Winter Olympics. He dressed as the backup goaltender for four of Finland's six games, but he did not see any ice time."

        "title": "Larry Sanders (basketball)",
        "text": "Larry Sanders (born November 21, 1988) is an American former professional basketball player. He played power forward for the Virginia Commonwealth University Rams before declaring himself eligible for the 2010 NBA draft and was selected 15th overall by the Milwaukee Bucks.\nHigh school career.\nSanders did not play basketball in the ninth grade, and the private school he attended did not offer it. However, after he transferred to Port St. Lucie High School, the school's basketball coach, Kareem Rodriguez, saw potential in the then 6'1\" Sanders and prevailed on him to play for the team. Sanders grew to 6'4\" in his second year and to 6'6\" in his third. He would sprout further to 6'9\" in his senior year. His production and growth spurt was enough that Rodriguez alerted his friend Tony Pujol, an assistant at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU), to watch out for him. He began garnering statewide attention in his junior campaign as he helped Port St. Lucie reach the Class 5A state semifinals. In his senior year, while averaging 18.9 points and 13 rebounds, Sanders led Port St. Lucie (20–8) to the District 13-5A Championship, and was named by the Associated Press to the First Team All-State. He committed to the VCU Rams when major schools only just started to take interest in him.\nCollege career.\nAt VCU, he was keen to train under its then head coach Anthony Grant, who was known to have tutored standout big men at the University of Florida while he was still an assistant there. For his first two seasons for VCU, Sanders played 2nd star to guard Eric Maynor. He excelled in that role, utilizing his size and athleticism to disrupt teams defensively. As a sophomore, he helped the Rams into the 2009 NCAA tournament against the UCLA Bruins, but lost 65–64 in the first round of the tournament. Sanders went on to have a more prominent role in his junior season after Maynor was drafted into the NBA. As a junior Sanders averaged 14.4 points, 9.1 rebounds, and 2.6 blocks, with 53% field-goal accuracy, all statistical team highs, on his way to earning the second of his consecutive CAA Defensive Player of the Year awards in 2008–09 and 2009–10.\nLarry Sanders announced in April 2010 after his junior year that he was departing VCU early to enter the NBA draft.\nProfessional career.\nMilwaukee Bucks (2010–2015).\nSanders was chosen by the Milwaukee Bucks with the 15th overall pick in the 2010 NBA draft. On July 8, 2010, he signed a multi-year, rookie scaled contract with the Bucks. On February 20, 2011, he was assigned to the Fort Wayne Mad Ants of the NBA D-League. On February 26, 2011, he was recalled by the Bucks.\nOn November 30, 2012, he recorded his only career triple-double with 10 points, 12 rebounds and 10 blocks in a loss to Minnesota. He finished the season second in blocks per game behind Serge Ibaka. Sanders also finished third in voting for the NBA Most Improved Player Award, after Paul George and Greivis Vásquez.\nOn August 20, 2013, Sanders signed a four-year, $44 million contract extension with the Bucks.\nIn December 2013, Sanders was sidelined for 25 games after sustaining a torn ligament in his thumb in a night club altercation. Sanders was fined for the two municipal citations of disorderly conduct and assault and battery charges, but police did not pursue further criminal charges. That same year he was cited twice for animal cruelty for leaving two German shepherd puppies outside without proper food, water, and shelter. \nOn March 20, 2014, it was announced that Sanders would miss the rest of the 2013–14 season due to a fractured right orbital bone.\nOn April 4, 2014, Sanders was given a five-game suspension for violating the NBA's drug policy after testing positive for marijuana.\nIn December 2014, Sanders was placed on Bucks' inactive roster due to personal reasons. After a seven-game absence, Sanders appeared on the Bucks' bench on January 7, 2015, against the Phoenix Suns, but did not suit up. Rumors emerged that Sanders wanted to leave the sport, all of which were denied by his agent.\nSanders again violated the NBA's drug policy during the 2014–15 season and was subsequently suspended without pay for a minimum of ten games on January 16, 2015.\nIt was announced on February 21, 2015, following his second suspension for marijuana use, that the Bucks were buying out Sanders' contract. On February 25, a video of Sanders was released where he explained that he entered into a program at Rogers Memorial Hospital for anxiety, depression and mood disorders. He said that the program led him to realize \"what's important, and where I would want to devote my time and energy\" and that ultimately he realized that \"for [basketball] to be consuming so much of my life and time right now ... it's not there for me. It's not that worth it.\" He did, however, claim to still love the game and that \"if I get to a point where I feel I'm capable of playing basketball again, then I will.\"\nOn January 26, 2017, Sanders announced his decision to return to basketball.\nCleveland Cavaliers (2017).\nOn March 13, 2017, Sanders signed with the Cleveland Cavaliers. He made his debut for the Cavaliers the following night in a 128–98 win over the Detroit Pistons. He played the final 1:58 and missed his only shot attempt while recording two fouls. On April 12, 2017, he was waived by the Cavaliers after appearing in five games. During his stint with Cleveland, he had multiple assignments with the Canton Charge of the NBA Development League. He reportedly struggled keeping up with responsibilities on and off the court. Sanders later played with 3 Headed Monsters in the 2019 Big3 season.\nPersonal life.\nIn his time away from basketball, Sanders created an artist collective, clothing line, and non-profit organization named Citizen of Matter. Sanders also worked as a music producer under the moniker L8 Show. Sanders received a placement on PartyNextDoor's second studio album titled \"PartyNextDoor 3\" on a track titled \"Don't Run\". Also had short lived adult film career under the name Benz Brown."

It took place March 7–10, 2009 at Sioux Falls Arena in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.\nTop-seeded North Dakota State defeated #3 seed Oakland 66–64 to earn an automatic berth into the 2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. The winning points came on a shot by Ben Woodside, who was also named the tournament MVP, with 3.3 seconds left. North Dakota State trailed for most of the final; the Bison were behind by as much as 14 points in the first half and 12 with less than 10 minutes left, but they went on an 18–4 run to end the game, capped by Woodside's shot. A long three-pointer by Oakland's Johnathon Jones at the buzzer bounced off the rim, preserving the Bison victory.\nThe Bison, who were in their first season of eligibility for Division I postseason play, became the first men's team in Division I or its predecessors in more than 35 years to qualify for the NCAA Tournament in its first year of eligibility. The previous team to accomplish this feat was Southwestern Louisiana, now Louisiana-Lafayette, in 1972. The Bison were the second Summit League team \"that day\" to accomplish this feat—South Dakota State, also in its first year of Division I postseason eligibility, won the Summit women's tournament final, held at the same site, to book a place in the NCAA women's tournament. In another coincidence, the Jackrabbits defeated Oakland in their final.\nFormat.\nUnlike most Division I basketball conferences, the Summit League does not send all of its teams into its conference tournament. Out of the league's 10 teams, the top eight receive berths in the conference tournament. After the 18-game conference season, teams are seeded by conference record, with tiebreakers used if necessary in the following order:\nBracket.\n\"* Overtime\""

The Kansas Jayhawks are coached by Dan Fitzgerald.\nHistory.\nBaseball has been played at the University of Kansas since 1880.\nIn 1993, the Jayhawks went to the 1993 College World Series in Omaha, NE. This was their first, and so far, only CWS appearance. The Jayhawks were led by All-Americans Jeff Berblinger, Jeff Neimeier and Jimmy Walker into the Mideast Regional in Knoxville, Tenn. After losing their first game to Fresno State, 7–4, the Jayhawks rebounded against host Tennessee for a 3–2 win. Jayhawk Freshman Jamie Splittorff, son of former Kansas City Royal Paul Splittorff, got the win for KU going 8 innings. KU then trounced Rutgers, 8–2, and Clemson, 9–1, to set up the all important re-match with Fresno State. Jayhawk coach Dave Bingham turned to Walker, who had been a reliever all season for KU, to start the Regional Final. Walker didn't disappoint as he pitched a complete game and the Jayhawks won in 10 innings, with some late game magic. Down 2–1 in the bottom of the ninth with one out, Berblinger tripled. One out later, Berblinger scored on Josh Igou's infield hit to force extra innings. In the tenth, Brent Wilhelm scored on Darryl Monroe's hot shot to short stop. Once in Omaha the joy was short-lived, as the Jayhawks lost to Texas A&amp;M, and then Long Beach State for an early exit. \nThe Jayhawks returned to the Regionals in 1994, earning a bid to the Atlantic II Regional in Tallahassee, Fla.\nThe Jayhawks would once again find themselves in a regional in the 2006 NCAA Division I baseball tournament after winning the 2006 Big 12 baseball tournament. That year KU traveled to Corvallis, Oregon for the Corvallis Regional. KU went 1–2 and did not advance.\nThe Jayhawks made the 2009 NCAA Division I baseball tournament as a 3 seed in the Chapel Hill Regional and went 2–2. They went 1–1 against 2-seed Coastal Carolina, defeated 4-seed Dartmouth, and were finally knocked out by 1-seed and regional winner North Carolina in the last game of the regional.\nIn 2014, the Jayhawks made their 5th NCAA tournament appearance, but were eliminated after finishing 1–2 in the Louisville Regional.\nMLB players.\nCurrent.\nKansas has no active players in MLB, but Rob Thomson, Manager of the Philadelphia Phillies played for Kansas from 1983 to 1985.

His professional career began in 1991 and its entirety has been spent in the Cardinals' organization.\nCareer.\nWarner was selected in the 17th round of the 1991 Major League Baseball Draft after graduating from the University of Wyoming. During his pro playing career (1991–1999) he played every infield position (although he was primarily a shortstop and second baseman) as well as corner outfield positions, and even pitched in three games. He threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed . His career peaked at Triple-A with 307 games played between 1997 and 1999 with the Louisville and Memphis Redbirds. In 792 minor league games, he rang up 594 hits, including 40 home runs, and batted .267.\nIn 2000, Warner retired as a player and spent the season as the batting practice pitcher for the Major League Cardinals. After working as a minor league coach from 2001 to 2002, he received his first managerial assignment in 2003 in the Rookie-level Appalachian League. He was a minor league coach again in 2004, then resumed his managerial career in the Cardinal farm system in 2005, progressing from Class A (Palm Beach Cardinals) in 2005–2006 to Double-A (Springfield Cardinals) from 2007 to 2011. He was named manager of the Memphis Redbirds on November 21, 2011. On December 10, 2014, Warner was named the Cardinals' roving minor league infield coordinator and was replaced as manager of the Redbirds by Mike Shildt. Through eleven seasons as a manager, Warner has compiled a record of 734–730 (.501).\nMidway through the 2017 season, the Cardinals promoted Warner to the big league staff in a general coaching role. He returned to the minors for the following season but became the Cardinals' bench coach on July 14, 2018, after manager Mike Matheny was fired and current bench coach Shildt was named interim manager. For the 2019 season, Warner became third base coach."

Norway's Magnus Moan, second in the World Cup standings, also had a disappointing championships as well, with a best place finish of fifth in the 10 km individual large hill events even though he set the fastest cross-country skiing portion time in both the 10 km individual large hill and the 10 km individual normal hill events.\nCompetition changes.\nNordic combined had the greatest changes in it schedule with the debut of the 10 km mass start and the replacement of the 7.5 km sprint and 15 km individual Gundersen events with two separate 10 km individual events. The first event, replacing the 15 km Gundersen, was a single jump from the individual normal hill followed by a 10 km cross country event using the Gundersen system while the second event, replacing the 7.5 km sprint, was a single jump from the individual large hill followed by a 10 km cross country event also using the Gundersen system. The Nordic combined changes were approved at an autumn seasonal meeting in Zürich, Switzerland, the week of 29 September 2008. Other changes listed in the ski jumping part of the team Nordic combined was only one jump and being listed was the point time differential will be 1 point equals 1.33 seconds. At the closing ceremony of the championships, FIS President Gian Franco Kasper stated that the event will be thoroughly analyzed as part of an overall season assessment as part of the discipline's current overhaul at season's end.\n10 km individual normal hill.\n22 February. Formerly the 15 km Individual Gundersen, the event consisted of one jump from the normal (HS 100) hill followed by the 10 km cross country race using the Gundersen system. Ronny Ackermann of Germany was three-time defending champion when the event was the 15 km Gundersen and finished 13th in this event. Schmid had the longest jump of the jumping part of the competition, but lost out to Lodwick and Koivuranta on style points with the American outscoring the Finn by 0.5 points by the judges. Koivuranta would fade to fourth during the cross country portion of the event while Demong would ski from 12th to claim bronze in the event. Norway's Magnus Moan had the fastest time in the cross country portion to move from 44th to his final position of 17th, followed by Demong and Lodwick. This was Lodwick's second gold medal and the fourth overall for the United States at these championships, more than they had earned in the country's history in the championships (3 total as of the 2007 championships.).\n10 km individual large hill.\n28 February. Formerly the 7.5 km sprint, the event now consisted of one jump from the large (HS 134) hill followed by the 10 km cross country race using the Gundersen system. Finland's Hannu Manninen was the defending champion, but did not defend his title to his retirement following the 2007–08 season. Lamy Chappius had the longest jump at the ski jumping part of the event while Koivuranta finished ahead of Ryynänen to better style points by the judges even though both jumped the same distance. Ryynänen would finish fourth while Koivuranta would not start in the cross-country part of the event. Norway's Magnus Moan would have the fastest time in the cross country portion of the event, moving from 34th to his fifth-place finish. American Bill Demong redeemed himself from his disqualification in the 4 x 5 km team event two days earlier by winning his first individual world championship gold medal and his second overall. Demong's gold brought the total American gold count to three which tied all of medals the country had won at the world championships prior to Liberec, and their sixth overall. Kircheisen's silver was the eighth overall for Germany at these championships.\n10 km mass start.\n19–20 February. This event debuted at these championships. It consisted of a 10 km mass start of cross country skiing. The winner of this part of the event was awarded 120 points with those finishing behind having points awarded by how they finish using the Gundersen method (1 point equals 4 seconds). The athletes then had two ski jumps from the normal (HS 100) hill measured by distance only and scored using the K-point of the hill. HS 100 has a K-point of 90 meters which was set at 60 points. Anything before or after 90 m had two points per meter change from the set 60 point standard. Points shown are to rounded time. The top three leaders after the cross country portion of the event were Lodwick (United States), Edelmann (Germany), and Demong (United States). A trial round was held for the ski jump, but the ski jump portion was postponed on the 19th to continuous snowfall and high winds. As a result, the jumping part of the event took place 16:00 to 17:45 CET the next day. Mario Stecher of Austria had the longest first jump of 101.0 m while Lamy-Chappius had the longest second jump. It was the first individual world championship medals for all the top three finishers.\n4 × 5 km freestyle team.\n26 February. The Finnish team of Anssi Koivuranta, Janne Ryynänen, Jaakko Tallus and Hannu Manninen were the defending champions, but was only able to finish eighth with Ryynänen and Tallus. The biggest shock in the ski jumping part of the event was American Bill Demong being disqualified for not wearing his bib during competition (ICR 526.1), causing the team to not start the cross-country part of the event (This incident would later be known as \"Bibgate\".). Asikainen had the longest jump of the ski jumping part with 136.0 m. Kokslien had the fastest first leg of the relay to move Norway from sixth to fourth with the top three leaders at the first exchange being Japan, Austria (who would finish fifth), and France (who would finish fourth). Braud of France had the fastest second leg to move the French from third to first. Second and third after the second exchange were Norway and Germany, respectively. Kircheisen of Germany ran the fastest third leg to move his country at the third exchange from third to first with Japan and Norway holding second and third, respectively. Japan's Kobayashi had both the fastest anchor leg and fastest overall leg to help his country beat Germany in a photo finish to win their first Winter Olympic or world championships in this event since the 1995 event in Thunder Bay.\n4 x 5 km freestyle"

The playoffs concluded on May 21 with the champion New York Islanders defeating the Minnesota North Stars 5–1 to win the final series four games to one and win the Stanley Cup.\nIn game one of the Edmonton-Montreal series, Wayne Gretzky recorded five assists, at the time this was a single game playoff record.\nThese were the last Stanley Cup playoffs conducted under a format that paired teams in each round without regard to division or conference standing.\nPlayoff seeds.\nThe sixteen teams that qualified for the playoffs are ranked 1–16 based on regular season points.\nPreliminary round.\n(1) New York Islanders vs. (16) Toronto Maple Leafs.\nThe New York Islanders, the defending 1980 Stanley Cup champions, entered the playoffs as the regular season, Campbell Conference, and Patrick Division champions, earning 110 points. The Toronto Maple Leafs earned 71 points during the regular season to finish sixteenth overall in the league. This was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the only previous meeting being the 1978 Stanley Cup Quarterfinals, where Toronto defeated the Islanders in seven games. The Islanders won three of the four games in this year's regular season series.\nToronto was swept in the opening round of the playoffs for the second consecutive year. New York's series-clinching win in game three was the first (and to date only until the bubble in the 2020 playoffs) time that the Islanders have won a playoff game in Toronto, and this was also only the second (and to date, last) victory that a road team has ever earned in the three series between these two franchises. As of 2019, this series marks the only time that the Islanders have defeated Toronto in the Stanley Cup playoffs. In game one, the Islanders scored three times on the power play, and Bryan Trottier scored twice and added three assists in a decisive 9–2 victory. The Islanders dominance of the Maple Leafs continued in game two, as Trottier recorded a hat trick in a 5-1 Islanders win. The Islanders jumped all over the Maple Leafs quickly in game three, by jumping out to a 5–0 lead after the first period. The Maple Leafs and Islanders traded goals in the second period 19 seconds apart. Game three ended in a series-clinching 6-1 Islanders victory.\n(2) St. Louis Blues vs. (15) Pittsburgh Penguins.\nThe St. Louis Blues entered the playoffs as the Smythe Division champions, earning 107 points. The Pittsburgh Penguins earned 73 points during the regular season to finish fifteenth overall in the league. This was the third playoff meeting between these two teams; the teams split their two previous series. Their most recent meeting was in the 1975 Preliminary round, where Pittsburgh defeated St. Louis in two-game sweep. These teams split this year's four-game regular season series.\nIn game one of the series, Pittsburgh struck quickly thanks to a Greg Malone goal at 0:15 of the first period. However, the Blues recovered by the end of the second period and took a 3–2 lead into the final period, which they held on to, winning the game 4–2. Game two proved to be a different story, as the Penguins exploded offensively and scored four times in the second period to erase a 1-0 first period deficit. The Blues and Penguins traded goals in the third period, giving Pittsburgh a 6–4 victory that tied the series at a game apiece. Game three went back and forth, with both teams trading goals all game long until Bernie Federko scored his second goal of the game with 4:06 left to play in the third period. The Blues won the game 5-4 and retook home ice advantage in the best-of-five series. The Penguins avoided elimination in game four, as Randy Carlyle and Mike Bullard each scored three points in the game, helping the Penguins to a 6–3 win. Game five was another tight contest and for the first time in the series overtime was required, with the score tied at 3 after regulation time. The game and series ended on Mike Crombeen's second goal of the series, scored at 5:16 of the second overtime period, giving St. Louis a 4–3 win and a 3–2 series victory.\n(3) Montreal Canadiens vs. (14) Edmonton Oilers.\nThe Montreal Canadiens entered the playoffs as the Wales Conference and Norris Division champions, earning 103 points. The Edmonton Oilers earned 74 points during the regular season and finished fourteenth overall, losing the tiebreaker with the New York Rangers in wins (30 to 29). This was the first playoff meeting between these two teams. These teams split this year's four-game regular season series.\nThe Oilers recorded the first playoff series victory by any of the four teams that joined the NHL in the 1979. It was also the first-ever sweep by the Oilers, including their history as a World Hockey Association franchise. The Oilers gained a 6–3 victory in game one, in large part due to Wayne Gretzky's five-assist night. At the time this was a new playoff record for assists by a single player in one game. Edmonton went on to win game two, with Risto Siltanen's power play goal at 4:43 of the second period giving the Oilers a 2–1 lead, Edmonton eventually winning the game by a score of 3–1. Edmonton completed the sweep of the heavily favoured Canadiens in game three, defeating Montreal 6–2. Gretzky led all scorers in the three-game series, finishing with 11 points (3G, 8A).\n(4) Los Angeles Kings vs. (13) New York Rangers.\nThe Los Angeles Kings entered the playoffs as the fourth overall seed in the league with 99 points, winning the tiebreaker with the Buffalo Sabres in wins (43 to 39). The New York Rangers earned 74 points during the regular season and finished thirteenth overall, winning the tiebreaker with the Edmonton Oilers in wins (30 to 29). This was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the only previous meeting being the 1979 Preliminary round, where New York defeated Los Angeles in two-game sweep. The Kings won three of the four games in this year's regular season series.\nThe Rangers won game one in large part due to the impressive goaltending performance of Steve Baker, as he turned away 31 of the Kings' 32 shots. Game two was marked by a brawl at the end of the first period; six players were ejected from the game as result of this. The Kings won game two 5–4 on the strength of a Dean Hopkins goal at 17:16 of the third period. Game three was dominated by the Rangers, as eight different players would score in the game for New York, and the Rangers won 10–3 on home ice. Game four was tied 3–3 in the third period, until Tom Laidlaw's goal at 6:44 gave the Rangers a 4–3 lead. The Rangers added two more goals in the third, earning a series-clinching 6–3 victory. Ranger forwards Ron Duguay and Ulf Nilsson each scored a goal in every game of this series.\n(5) Buffalo Sabres vs. (12) Vancouver Canucks.\nThe Buffalo Sabres entered the playoffs as the Adams Division champions, earning 99 points, losing the tiebreaker with the Los Angeles Kings in wins (43 to 39). The Vancouver Canucks earned 76 points during the regular season and finished twelfth overall in the league. This was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, and was a rematch of last year's Preliminary Round, where Buffalo defeated Vancouver in four games. These teams split this year's four-game regular season series.\nThe Sabres swept Vancouver in three games, eliminating the Canucks in the preliminary round for the second consecutive season. Buffalo forced game one to overtime as Andre Savard scored the tying goal with just 8 seconds left in the third period. Rookie centre Alan Haworth scored the game-winning goal for Buffalo five minutes into overtime. The Sabres scored three times on the power play in game two, winning the game 5–2. Vancouver attempted to mount a comeback from a 4–1 deficit in the third period of game three before Buffalo's Tony McKegney scored his second goal of the game, giving the Sabres a 5–3 lead. Buffalo hung on to their 5–3 lead and clinched the series with a game three victory.\n(6) Philadelphia Flyers vs. (11) Quebec Nordiques.\nThe Philadelphia Flyers entered the playoffs as the sixth seed in the league with 97 points.

        "title": "Alabama Crimson Tide women's gymnastics",
        "text": "The Alabama Crimson Tide gymnastics is a Division I gymnastics team representing the University of Alabama in NCAA competition. The Tide hosts its home matches in Coleman Coliseum on the university's Tuscaloosa, Alabama campus. One of only seven gymnastics teams to win the national title, the Crimson Tide has won six NCAA championships, ten SEC championships, and an NCAA-record 32 Regional championships. The team is led by first-year head coach Ashley Priess-Johnston, who succeeded Dana Duckworth following the 2022 season.\nHistory.\nThe early years.\nWith the passage of the 1972 Title 9 Amendment which provided for the inclusion of women in sports, The University of Alabama Gymnastics team existed as a club sport. With the first team acting as a club sport In 1972, The University of Alabama Gymnastics Team existed and competed with such teams as Jacksonville State until it was later sanctioned as a viable gymnastic team in 1975.\nThe University of Alabama's first gymnastics team debuted in 1975 and began with a loss to Georgia College. The team moved along in relative obscurity, going through four coaches in four years, until the summer of 1978 when Sarah Campbell was announced as the fifth head coach of the Crimson Tide. Her first team finished the year 7-7 and she followed up in 1980 with the first winning season in school history. In 1983, the Crimson Tide made its first championship appearance in Salt Lake City, Utah after winning the South Region, defeating the Florida Gators.\nThe eighties.\nAlabama blossomed into a perennial contender under Sarah Patterson and continued to qualify for nationals as well as producing numerous All-Americans. Penney Hauschild became the Tide's first NCAA Champion in 1985 when she won the uneven bars as well as capturing the All-Around title, becoming the first non-Utah gymnast to do so. She would defend her All-Around title in 1986 while also winning the floor title.\nThe Crimson Tide continued to advance throughout the decade and finally won their first NCAA title in 1988. The Tide marched into Salt Lake City and defeated host Utah (189.50) and defending champion Georgia (186.80) with a commanding 190.05. 1988 also marked the Tide's first SEC title, when the competition was hosted in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.\nThe nineties.\nThe 1990s began with a bang for the Tide as Alabama was crowned the 1990 SEC Champions. The team won its second national title in 1991 before a home crowd in Tuscaloosa. A rivalry between Alabama and Georgia, which endures to this day, began around this time. Patterson and Georgia coach Suzanne Yoculan hosted frequent dual meets between their teams to inspire the rivalry. The Tide first sold out Coleman Coliseum on February 1, 1997, when 15,043 fans watched Alabama take on Georgia; the Tide continues to report some of the highest fan turnout of any program, with an average attendance at home meets in 2014 of 12,826 (second only to Utah).\nIn 1995, the Tide won their third SEC Tournament championship in Gainesville. Alabama went into their final rotation in fourth place before scoring the highest team vault total in NCAA history as all their gymnasts scored 9.9 or higher, with junior Kim Kelly capping off the night with a perfect 10.\nAlabama finished the 1996 season with their third national championship, recording a record team score of 198.025. However, 1997 saw the Crimson Tide fail to reach the Super Six for the first time since 1983.\nThe new millennium.\nAlabama captured their fourth SEC title in 2000, but only managed a fifth-place finish at nationals that year, improving to fourth in 2001. The Tide looked dangerous once again in 2002 as Andreé Pickens, Raegan Tomasek, Alexis Brion, Kristin Sterner, and freshman Jeana Rice led the Tide to a fourth national championship at home in Tuscaloosa, defeating two-time defending national champion UCLA. In 2003, the Tide won their fifth SEC title with the youngest squad in program history, with seven freshman, three sophomores, three juniors and one senior. Nationally, Rice won the All Around in 2004 while freshman Ashley Miles won the first of her three national titles on vault. The Crimson Tide added their first Olympian to the team with Terin Humphrey, a two-time silver medalist at the 2004 Olympics, who joined Alabama in 2005 and would go on to win two national uneven bar titles.\nIn 2007, the Tide marked their first absence from the Super Six since 1997. In 2009, Alabama was the first gymnastics program to draw two crowds of over 15,000 in one season. They finished the season in second place behind Georgia, their best result since 2005.\nThe 2010s.\nAlabama maintained a rank of No. 1 throughout the 2010 regular season, but struggled at the SEC championships and finished the night as runners up behind Florida. Despite putting on one of the top performances of the preliminaries, Alabama stumbled in their first rotation at Nationals, sinking as low as sixth place during the final competition before rallying back to finish 3rd.\nThe Tide began the 2011 season with eight freshmen on the team, making it the largest class in school history and accounting for nearly half the roster. The Tide finished the regular season at 11–1, and won the 2011 SEC Championship, taking down No. 1 Florida in the process. Alabama entered the Super Six that year as the No. 1 seed and defeated defending champions UCLA with a winning score of 197.650, their highest Super Six score since 1996. The Tide defeated the overwhelming favorite Florida to win a second consecutive title in 2012 with a score of 197.850.\nAlabama entered the 2013 postseason primed for a close battle with Florida in the Super Six, but uncharacteristic mistakes saw Alabama slip to third place behind Oklahoma, while Florida won its first national title. As the host school in 2014, Alabama won their eighth SEC Championship with a team score of 197.875, but fell to fourth place at Nationals after having to count a fall. Alabama's win at the 2014 Seattle Regional marked Patterson's thousandth career win.\nIn 2015 Dana Duckworth was announced as the head coach after Sarah Patterson retired. She led them to their second straight SEC title, 9th overall, their 21st regional title and a fourth-place finish at Nationals.\nThe Power of Pink.\nThe Power of Pink is the name given to one of the Crimson Tide's home meets each season in which all the participants and fans wear pink to support breast cancer awareness. The first Power of Pink meet, designated the \"Drive 4 the Cause\" meet, was held in February 2005 at Alabama's home meet against Auburn; Coach Sarah Patterson ordered pink leotards for her team and requested that all fans show up wearing pink. The meet, now known as the \"Pink Meet\", is an annual crowd favorite with each following \"Pink Meet\" selling out. The movement quickly spread among other NCAA gymnastics teams, with many schools participating in at least one Pink Meet per season, usually in late February or early March.\nAmong Patterson's early supporters was the local DCH Regional Medical Center, which created the DCH Breast Cancer Fund. The fund was set up to provide disadvantaged women with means for early detection and treatment for breast cancer. Other supporters include the University, community leaders and Tuscaloosa Toyota. Tuscaloosa Toyota became more and more involved donating free pink shirts to give away at the meets and prize give-aways during the meet. Over a decade of Pink Meets, almost $1.5 million has been raised for cancer research at the DCH Fund. Each Alabama gymnast escorts a breast cancer survivor during team introductions at Pink Meets hosted in Coleman Coliseum.\nNCAA titles.\nAlabama has won 29 individual NCAA championships."

        "title": "1984 Stanley Cup playoffs",
        "text": "The 1984 Stanley Cup playoffs, the playoff tournament of the National Hockey League (NHL) began on April 4, after the conclusion of the 1983–84 NHL season. The playoffs concluded on May 19 with the Edmonton Oilers defeating the four-time defending champion New York Islanders 5–2 to win the Stanley Cup Finals four games to one, the franchise's first Stanley Cup.\nPlayoff seeds.\nThe 1984 playoffs largely maintained the format used for the previous two seasons. The four teams with the best regular-season records from each of the four divisions secured playoff berths. The division semi-finals saw the first-place club against the fourth-place team, while the other two teams played against each other. The winning clubs then met in the division final. Home-ice advantage for these first two rounds of the playoffs were granted to the team with the better regular-season record. Division winners then met one another in the conference finals.\nLeaving behind the coin flip system introduced for the 1982 playoffs, the NHL changed the method by which home-ice advantage is determined for the final two rounds. The higher point total accumulated by teams within a division from contests against teams of the other division in the conference, secured home-ice advantage for the corresponding division champion. Similarly, the higher point total accumulated by teams within a conference from contests against teams of the other conference, secured home-ice advantage for the corresponding conference champion.\nThis formula resulted in home-ice advantage for the Adams and Smythe division champions in the conference finals and resulted in home-ice advantage for the Wales Conference champion in the Stanley Cup finals.\nThe sequence of Stanley Cup Finals games was changed for this season. The series opened with two games at the venue of the team with home-ice advantage and then shifted to the opponent's rink for the next three games, including the fifth (if necessary). The series then returned to the initial venue for the final two games (if necessary).\nThe following teams qualified for the playoffs:\nDivision semifinals.\nPrince of Wales Conference.\n(A1) Boston Bruins vs. (A4) Montreal Canadiens.\nThis was the 19th playoff series between these two teams. Montreal lead 16–2 in previous playoff meetings. Montreal won the most recent meeting in seven games in the 1979 Stanley Cup Semifinals.\n(A2) Buffalo Sabres vs. (A3) Quebec Nordiques.\nThis was the first playoff series meeting between these two teams.\n(P1) New York Islanders vs. (P4) New York Rangers.\nThis was the sixth playoff series meeting between these two teams. The Islanders won four of the previous five meetings, including in each of the past three seasons. The Islanders won in six games in last year's Patrick Division Finals.\n(P2) Washington Capitals vs. (P3) Philadelphia Flyers.\nThis was the first playoff series meeting between these two teams.\nClarence Campbell Conference.\n(N1) Minnesota North Stars vs. (N4) Chicago Black Hawks.\nThis was the third playoff series meeting between these two teams. Chicago won both previous meetings over the past two seasons, including last year's Norris Division Finals in five games.\n(N2) St. Louis Blues vs. (N3) Detroit Red Wings.\nThis was the first playoff series meeting between these two teams.\n(S1) Edmonton Oilers vs. (S4) Winnipeg Jets.\nThis was the second playoff series meeting between these two teams. This was a rematch of last year's Smythe Division Semifinals, in which Edmonton won in a three-game sweep.\n(S2) Calgary Flames vs. (S3) Vancouver Canucks.\nThis was the third playoff series meeting between these two teams. Both teams split their prior two meetings in the past two seasons. Calgary won last year's Smythe Division Semifinals 3–1.\nDivision finals.\nPrince of Wales Conference.\n(A3) Quebec Nordiques vs. (A4) Montreal Canadiens.\nThis was the second playoff series meeting between these two teams. Quebec won the only previous meeting 3–2 in the 1982 Adams Division Semifinals.\nGame six of this series is referred to as the Good Friday Massacre.\n(P1) New York Islanders vs. (P2) Washington Capitals.\nThis was the second playoff series meeting between these two teams. This was a rematch of last year's Patrick Division Semifinals, in which New York won 3–1. By winning their eighteenth consecutive series, the Islanders set a North American major professional sports record for most consecutive playoff series victories (previously set by the Boston Celtics with seventeen series wins over eight years in the 1950s and 1960s).\nClarence Campbell Conference.\n(N1) Minnesota North Stars vs. (N2) St. Louis Blues.\nThis was the fifth playoff series meeting between these two teams. St. Louis won three of the previous four meetings, including their most recent in the 1972 Stanley Cup Quarterfinals in seven games.\n(S1) Edmonton Oilers vs. (S2) Calgary Flames.\nThis was the second playoff series meeting between these two teams. This was a rematch of last year's Smythe Division Finals, in which Edmonton won in five games.\nLanny McDonald scored the overtime winner for Calgary in Game 6.\nConference finals.\nPrince of Wales Conference final.\n(P1) New York Islanders vs. (A4) Montreal Canadiens.\nThis was the third playoff series meeting between these two teams. Montreal won both prior meetings, including the most recent meeting in six games in the 1977 Stanley Cup Semifinals.\nClarence Campbell Conference final.\n(S1) Edmonton Oilers vs. (N1) Minnesota North Stars.\nThis was the first playoff series meeting between these two teams.\nStanley Cup Finals.\nThis was the third playoff series meeting between these two teams. New York won both previous meetings, and was a rematch of New York's four-game sweep in last year's Stanley Cup Finals.\nThe Islanders attempted to match the 1950s Montreal Canadiens and win the Stanley Cup five consecutive times, against the Edmonton Oilers attempting to win the franchise's first championship. The Islanders lost the first game at home 1–0, but bounced back to defeat the Oilers 6–1 in the second game. Edmonton took over the series from that point, winning the next three games, all played in Edmonton.\nPlayer statistics.\nSkaters.\nThese are the top ten skaters based on points.\nGoaltenders.\nThis is a combined table of the top five goaltenders based on goals against average and the top five goaltenders based on save percentage, with at least 420 minutes played.

        "text": "Russell Lewis Miller (March 25, 1900 – April 30, 1962), was a professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) during 1927 and 1928 for the Philadelphia Phillies. Listed at and , he threw and batted right-handed.\nBaseball career.\nMiller's minor league baseball career spanned 1925 to 1932, as he compiled a 49–43 win–loss record pitching a total of 162 games for seven different teams. He spent time with farm teams of the St. Louis Cardinals in 1927 and Chicago Cubs in 1929.\nMiller's major league career consisted of 35 appearances for the Philadelphia Phillies; two in 1927 (both starts) and 33 in 1928 (12 starts). His two appearances in 1927 came in late September; after losing his first start on September 24 to the Chicago Cubs, he won his second start on September 29 against the Boston Braves, pitching a complete game while allowing just one run. In 1928, Miller accrued an 0–12 record, taking losses both as a starting pitcher and as a reliever; he did earn two saves. Overall with the Phillies, Miller had a 1–13 record with 5.40 ERA and 23 strikeouts in innings pitched.\nPersonal life.\nMiller was born in Ohio in 1900. He was a younger brother of fellow major league pitcher J. Walter Miller (1898–1975); both played college baseball at Ohio State University. Miller's senior entry in the Ohio State yearbook noted that he was a member of Delta Tau Delta fraternity and that he had earned three varsity letters in baseball. In February 1942, he was working in agricultural extension for Ohio State, and he was later the agricultural agent for Crawford County, Ohio, a position he held for 28 years, until his death. Miller died in 1962 in Bucyrus, Ohio, and was interred in Reynoldsburg, Ohio. He was survived by his wife and two sons."

        "text": "John Burke (10 January 1948 – 9 June 2013) was an English professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1960s and 1970s. He played at representative level for Great Britain (non-Test matches), and at club level for Normanton, Leeds, Keighley, South Sydney Rabbitohs, Castleford and Wakefield Trinity, as a .\nBackground.\nJohn Burke was born in Wakefield, West Riding of Yorkshire, England. He worked as a plumber, and he died aged 65 in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, England.\nPlaying career.\nLeeds.\nJohn was a Normanton boy and his career took him to Leeds, Keighley, South Sydney and Castleford before arriving at Belle Vue in 1978. \nHis Leeds career started in 1964 but he did not break into the first team until 1967 and then more regularly in 1969-70 after the retirement of Mick Clark. In his first full season he won a League Leaders’ winners medal and a Yorkshire League winners medal and was in Leeds’ front row when they went down to St Helens in the 1970 Championship Final. The following 1970–71 season saw John play in another three cup finals (including Leeds 23–7 victory over Featherstone Rovers in the 1970 Yorkshire Cup Final, and Leeds' 9–5 victory over St Helens in the 1970 BBC2 Floodlit Trophy Final) and also saw him play at Wembley, playing at in Leeds' 7–24 defeat by Leigh in the 1971 Challenge Cup Final on Saturday 15 May 1971, in front of a crowd of 85,514.\nKeighley and Castleford.\nIn 1972 he moved to Keighley, making his début in an 11-16 home defeat by Hull KR on 1 September. He played a total of 103 games for Keighley between 1972 and 1976 which saw him score eight tries and a drop goal (a left foot effort at York in a 1975 Yorkshire Cup tie). His time at Lawkholme Lane also saw him close to Wembley again, with a 1976 semi-final defeat (4-5 v St Helens).\nAfter a brief retirement he arrived at Castleford in 1976. His notorious reputation caught up with him here with numerous suspensions. In-between Keighley and Castleford, he also had the 1976 season with the South Sydney Rabbitohs where he played ten first-team games.\nWakefield Trinity.\nWhen John signed for Wakefield Trinity in April 1978, he was suspended almost immediately. He had been out of the game six months after a Castleford sending-off. On his return game in the Trinity Reserves, he was sent off again so a two-game ban saw him miss his first two Trinity games, at St Helens and at home to Hull. He made his Trinity début at Hull KR on 9 April 1978 and he was sent off again, along with Bill Ashurst in a narrow 16-17 defeat. The suspension forced him to miss the first three games of 1978–79 but from that time on he was the cornerstone of the Trinity pack that saw them go all the way to Wembley. He was a first class ball handler, strong runner and tremendous tackler and went on to play twenty one games in the season, scoring his only Trinity try at Huddersfield in October 1978. He played in all the cup rounds, Featherstone (home), Oldham (away) and Barrow (home) before having one of his best ever games in the semi-final victory over St Helens, when he had a hand in the match winning try, scored by Andrew Fletcher in the 9-7 win. There then followed John's second visit to Wembley but also his second defeat when he played at in Wakefield Trinity's 3-12 defeat by Widnes in the 1979 Challenge Cup Final on Saturday 5 May 1979, in front of a crowd of a crowd of 94,218. He came second in the press vote for the Lance Todd Trophy behind David Topliss.\nHis successful season earned him the Trinity Supporters' Player of the Year for 1978-79, followed by a late call up to the Great Britain tour squad. The Lions were already ‘Down Under’ when John earned his call-up following injuries and although did not feature in the Test line up he played in nine tour games before throwing his boots into Auckland Harbour and never playing again.\nHe waited until returning home in August 1979 before officially announcing his shock retirement but his powerful runs, strong defence and deft handling skills were to be lost to the club.\nHe played a total of twenty four first team games, scoring one try. In his retirement he became an accomplished runner and he could be seen running many half marathons around the city. He was also a successful plumber and resided in Durkar before his illness.\nInternational honours.\nJohn Burke was selected for Great Britain while at Wakefield Trinity for the 1979 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand. He played nine times for the GB team whilst on tour in 1979, but no test matches"

        "title": "WrestleMania XXVI",
        "text": " \nWrestleMania XXVI was the 26th annual WrestleMania professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The event took place on March 28, 2010, at the University of Phoenix Stadium in the Phoenix suburb of Glendale, Arizona. It was the first WrestleMania since WrestleMania XI with a non-title match as a main event, the first WrestleMania held in Arizona, and the third held in an open-air venue, after WrestleMania IX and WrestleMania XXIV.\nThe card consisted of eight matches, including three main matches. The final match on the card was a no disqualification, no countout match where The Undertaker defeated Shawn Michaels to improve his undefeated WrestleMania streak to 18–0; per the pre-match stipulation, Michaels was forced to retire (though he would wrestle one more match at Crown Jewel 2018). In the main match from the SmackDown brand, World Heavyweight Champion Chris Jericho defeated the 2010 Royal Rumble winner Edge to retain the title. In Raw's main match, John Cena defeated Batista to win the WWE Championship. The undercard also included a No Holds Barred match between Bret Hart and Mr. McMahon and the sixth annual Money in the Bank ladder match, which was the last to be contested at a WrestleMania before it became a stand-alone PPV event in July.\nTickets for the event commenced sale to the public on November 7, 2009. WrestleMania XXVI generated approximately 885,000 PPV buys, grossing US$49 million in revenue. With an attendance of 72,219, the event grossed $5.8 million in ticket sales, making the event the highest grossing and attended entertainment event held at the University of Phoenix Stadium.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nWrestleMania is considered World Wrestling Entertainment's (WWE) flagship pay-per-view (PPV) event, having first been held in 1985. It has become the longest-running professional wrestling event in history and is held annually between mid-March to mid-April. It was the first of WWE's original four pay-per-views, which includes Royal Rumble, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, referred to as the \"Big Four\". WrestleMania XXVI featured wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown brand divisions.\nGlobal Spectrum, the University of Phoenix Stadium's operator, had worked in previous years with WWE to recruit the event to its venue in the Phoenix suburb of Glendale, Arizona. On January 18, 2008, Global Spectrum publicly announced its intention to host WrestleMania in 2010. The event gained media attention in the weeks prior when a photo of Wayne Gretzky, then head coach of the Phoenix Coyotes, wearing a shirt promoting the event surfaced in the Swedish newspaper \"Expressen\". At a press conference on February 24, 2009, at the University of Phoenix Stadium, WrestleMania XXVI was formally announced to be held at the venue on March 28, 2010; it marked the first time a WrestleMania had taken place in the state of Arizona. Tickets for the event went on sale November 7, 2009, at 10:00am MST.\nThe roof of the University of Phoenix Stadium was opened several times during the event, marking the third time in WrestleMania history after WrestleMania IX and XXIV that the event has been held in an open-air venue. As in the previous open-air events, a steel tarpaulin structure was placed over the ring, which was placed at the 50-yard line. Custom-built from Belgium, the tarpaulin held 30 tons of light and camera equipment, with much of the equipment shipped from the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Over 1,000 lights were used, adapting to the decrease in sunlight as the show continued into the night. The entrance stage stood off the stadium floor and measured wide. In an interview with \"The Arizona Republic\", production manager Brian Petree described the stage design as a \"completely new design that hasn't been done anywhere and won't be done again\", while production designer Jason Robinson discussed basing his stage design themes often on local flavors, or in simple terms, the stage design of this year's WrestleMania simply resembles to that of a ziggurat. The entrance ramp linking to the stage has been lined with cauldrons of fire, each at a temperature of . In addition, 400,000 individual pieces of pyrotechnic product have been launched into the open air after Robinson promised to introduce new types of pyrotechnics never used in a WWE show before. Pre-planning for the set-up began six months before the event, while the construction structures and equipment inside the stadium began two weeks before the event. It is estimated that 100 trucks were used to deliver equipment, in comparison to the 12 semi-trucks used in a regular WWE show.\nThe official theme songs for the event were \"I Made It\" by Kevin Rudolf, \"Be Yourself\" by Audioslave, \"Thunderstruck\" by AC/DC, and \"The Show\" by Since October. \"\" by Johnny Cash was also used to promote the Undertaker-Michaels match. Fantasia Barrino performed the annual rendition of \"America the Beautiful\" at the start of the show. The commentators were Michael Cole, Jerry Lawler, and Matt Striker.\nMarketing.\nAlong with WrestleMania XXVI, a series of events grouped as \"WrestleMania Week\" were held in the week preceding the event. To begin promotion for the event in Glendale, a \"Kick-off Party\" was held at the Westgate City Center on March 19, which included appearances from WWE wrestlers, autograph signings and live entertainment along with a giant LED screen viewing of that night's episode of \"SmackDown\". The third annual \"WrestleMania Art\" (formerly \"WrestleManiArt\"), an art exhibition and auction featuring work by WWE superstars, was held on March 24 at the Make-A-Wish Foundation National Headquarters. WrestleMania's annual fan convention, WrestleMania Axxess, was held from March 25 through March 28 at the Phoenix Convention Center. On March 27, WWE hosted its annual WWE Hall of Fame ceremony at the Dodge Theater, where the Class of 2010 were inducted.\nStorylines.\nThe professional wrestling matches at WrestleMania XXVI featured professional wrestlers performing as characters in scripted events pre-determined by the hosting promotion, World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). Storylines between the characters were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\" with the Raw and SmackDown brands—storyline divisions in which WWE assigned its employees to different programs.\nAt The Bash in 2009, Edge and Chris Jericho established a tag team partnership when they won the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship that night. Their partnership was short lived as Edge suffered a torn achilles tendon and had to vacate his half of the championship. Jericho distanced himself from Edge, crediting himself for all of the team's success. Edge made his return from injury at the Royal Rumble during the namesake match. Edge would eliminate Jericho en route to winning the Royal Rumble match, earning himself an opportunity to fight for either the WWE Championship or the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania. In the main event of the Elimination Chamber event three weeks later, Jericho won the World Heavyweight Championship in an Elimination Chamber match. The following night on \"Raw\", Edge challenged Jericho for the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania after spearing him.\nOne of the predominant rivalries heading into WrestleMania XXVI was between John Cena and Batista for the WWE Championship. The conflict started when Cena sided with Bret Hart over Hart's hostility with WWE Chairman Mr. McMahon. When Hart and McMahon confronted each other on the February 1 episode of \"Raw\", Batista saved McMahon from an attack and ambushed Hart from behind. After the show ended, Cena tried to help Hart but was too attacked by Batista. In the opening match of the Elimination Chamber event, Cena won the WWE Championship from Sheamus in an Elimination Chamber match but was shortly interrupted by McMahon, who ordered a title match between Cena and Batista to take place on the spot. With Cena too tired to compete, Batista defeated him and won the title. On the February 22 episode of \"Raw\", Cena asked for a rematch for the title at WrestleMania, which McMahon gave him the opportunity to as long as he defeated Batista that night. Later that night, Batista intentionally got himself disqualified by kicking Cena in the groin to set up their match at WrestleMania.\nAt WrestleMania 25, Shawn Michaels was unsuccessful in defeating The Undertaker and ending Undertaker's undefeated streak at the event. When the match won the 2009 Slammy Award for Match of the Year, Michaels stated in his acceptance speech that he could still defeat The Undertaker at WrestleMania and challenged him to a rematch. A month later, The Undertaker, then the World Heavyweight Champion, made his reply and denied a rematch, stating that he had nothing to prove to Michaels. The refusal saw Michaels obsess about facing the Undertaker at the event, attacking referee Charles Robinson and SmackDown general manager Theodore Long respectively after failing his title match opportunities in the Royal Rumble match and Elimination Chamber qualifiers. At the Elimination Chamber event, Michaels snuck into Undertaker's Elimination Chamber match for the World Heavyweight Championship and performed a Sweet Chin Music on The Undertaker, enabling Chris Jericho to defeat The Undertaker and win the World Heavyweight Championship. On the following night, The Undertaker changed his mind and accepted the rematch but with the stipulation that if Michaels loses, he would have to retire. Michaels accepted, noting that if he could not end the streak, there was no reason why his career should continue. Two weeks later, Michaels and The Undertaker agreed on another additional stipulation; that the match would have no disqualifications and no count-outs.\nOn the February 22 episode of \"Raw\", the sixth annual Money in the Bank ladder match was set for WrestleMania XXVI. In this match, numerous participants compete to retrieve a briefcase that is suspended above the ring with a cable by climbing a ladder. The briefcase holds a symbolic contract which the holder would be able to exchange for a WWE or World Heavyweight match at any time or location of his choosing up until WrestleMania XXVII. The first qualifying match was held later that night, in which Christian defeated Carlito to qualify. Three more qualifying matches were held on the February 26 episode of \"SmackDown\", which saw Dolph Ziggler defeat John Morrison and R-Truth in a triple threat match, Kane defeat Drew McIntyre, and Shelton Benjamin defeat CM Punk to qualify. The March 1 episode of \"Raw\" saw both Jack Swagger and Montel Vontavious Porter qualify by defeating Santino Marella and Zack Ryder respectively. Matt Hardy was the next to qualify for the match when he defeated Drew McIntyre on the March 5 episode of \"SmackDown\". In what was initially declared as the final qualifying match, Evan Bourne defeated William Regal on the March 9 episode of \"Raw\" to become the eighth competitor. Due to his favorable association with Vince McMahon, McIntyre was given a third chance on the March 12 episode of \"SmackDown\" to qualify for the match, increasing the number of participants to nine. In what would also be made an Intercontinental Championship defense by Theodore Long, McIntyre defeated local competitor Aaron Bolo to qualify. On the March 22 episode of \"Raw\", the number of participants was once again increased to a record ten, when Kofi Kingston defeated Vladimir Kozlov to qualify.\nAs the guest host of the January 4 episode of \"Raw\", Bret Hart made his return to the show; the first time Hart had appeared since the Montreal Screwjob incident at the 1997 Survivor Series where Vince McMahon was involved in legitimately double-crossing Hart out of the WWF Championship. On \"Raw\", Hart tried to put all hostilities aside and make peace with McMahon, but McMahon again betrayed Hart and kicked him in the groin. The rivalry was further fuelled during Hart's second appearance a month later, where McMahon refused to induct Hart's father, Stu Hart, into the WWE Hall of Fame. On the February 8 episode of \"Raw\", John Cena called out McMahon and told him that Hart wanted to face him at WrestleMania, which McMahon accepted. Hart, who had been banned from the arena, showed up and attacked McMahon. Hiding behind security guards, McMahon changed his mind and canceled the bout. Unable to get his match, Hart addressed the fans a week later and decided to make his goodbye, thanking them. Later on that night, Hart was involved in a car accident when a reversing car smashed the open door from Hart's limousine onto his leg, sending Hart immediately to hospital. McMahon agreed to a \"proper farewell\" from Hart on the March 1 episode of \"Raw\", but the segment ended up as a challenge from McMahon for a WrestleMania match. Despite initial reluctance from Hart due to his leg, Hart was convinced to accept after McMahon said he had no more heart, called him a coward and kicked his crutches from underneath him. A contract signing was held two weeks later, moderated by guest host Stone Cold Steve Austin, who reversed McMahon's decision on Stu Hart's induction into the Hall of Fame. Before the contract was signed, Hart asked for the match to be a No Holds Barred match, which McMahon agreed to. Afterward, Hart revealed that his leg was perfectly fine and that his car accident was a setup created by Cena and himself to force a match out of McMahon.\nOn the March 5 episode of \"SmackDown\", ShoMiz (Big Show and The Miz) were scheduled to defend their Unified WWE Tag Team Championship at the event against a team who won a triple threat match between Cryme Tyme (Shad Gaspard and JTG), The Hart Dynasty (Davey Boy Smith Jr. and Tyson Kidd), and the pairing of The Miz's former partner John Morrison and R-Truth. Morrison and Truth would go on to win the qualifying match.\nAt the previous month's Elimination Chamber event, then-WWE Champion, Sheamus, was eliminated from Raw's Elimination Chamber match by Triple H. Two weeks later, Sheamus ambushed Triple H following his match teaming with Shawn Michaels against The Big Show and The Miz, and beat him down. The following week on \"Raw\", Sheamus issued a challenge to Triple H at WrestleMania, which saw him accept.\nIn early 2009, Randy Orton had formed a contingency known as The Legacy, also featuring Ted DiBiase and Cody Rhodes. Later in that year, Orton had grown frustrated with his group, leading to a number of verbal confrontations and an assault on DiBiase, leading to the three of them having their membership being tested in matches under the threat of expulsion and a beat-down. The tension was staved off until the Royal Rumble which Rhodes accidentally prevented Orton from winning the WWE Championship. A similar result occurred the next month at the Elimination Chamber event with Rhodes trying to aide his partners in their Elimination Chamber match for the title as Orton was caught in the crossfire, leading to DiBiase eliminating Orton. And on the following night of \"Raw\", Orton turned on his associates, leading to a Triple Threat match between the three men at WrestleMania.\nSince the beginning of 2010, CM Punk and his storyline disciples Luke Gallows and Serena had been on a crusade of sorts in order to promote the message of straight edge, a lifestyle that abstains from alcohol, tobacco, and recreational drug use; he did so by preaching his gospel to the crowd and sometimes by \"converting\" members of the crowd by shaving their heads. The three of them would call themselves the Straight Edge Society. On the February 12 episode of \"SmackDown\", Punk faced Rey Mysterio in a losing effort. Following the match, he and his group assaulted Mysterio, leading to a series of interference between the two. The animosity would escalate between the two on the March 12 episode of \"SmackDown\", when Mysterio brought his family into the ring to commemorate his daughter, Aaliyah's, 9th birthday. Punk interrupted the celebration by threatening Mysterio and taunting his children as they left the ring. The events came to a boiling point to Mysterio and Punk preparing to face each other at WrestleMania. Following Mysterio's loss to Gallows, the prematch stipulation for their match would be that if the former would lose, he would join the Straight Edge Society.\nEvent.\nPre-show.\nA dark match was scheduled before the actual event, the superstars not involved in the event competed in a 26-man battle royal. Eventually Yoshi Tatsu, Zack Ryder, Finlay and Mike Knox were left. Finlay and Knox were eliminated by Ryder who himself was then kicked and eliminated by Tatsu to win the Battle Royal.\nAs the show went live, singer Fantasia performed the annual rendition of \"America the Beautiful\".\nPreliminary matches.\nThe first match for the evening was a tag team match for the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship featuring champions ShoMiz (The Miz and Big Show) versus John Morrison and R-Truth. The Miz and Morrison started off the encounter, at one point Morrison attempted to hit Miz with the \"Starship Pain\" only for Big Show to come in for the save. Later, R-Truth tried to springboard onto the Big Show but was caught and hit against the ring post. The match ended when Big Show blind tagged himself in and knocked out Morrison, pinning him to win the match and retain the titles.\nThe second bout was a triple threat match between Randy Orton, Ted DiBiase, and Cody Rhodes, all formerly of the stable known as Legacy. Rhodes and DiBiase spent most of the match double teaming Orton, however when DiBiase attempted to pin Orton, he was stopped by Rhodes. This turned into a brawl between the two which led to Orton taking the advantage. The match ended when Orton punted Rhodes and executed the \"RKO\" on DiBiase to win the fall.\nThe annual Money in the Bank ladder match took place next, with Jack Swagger, Christian, Dolph Ziggler, Drew McIntyre, Evan Bourne, Kane, Kofi Kingston, Montel Vontavious Porter, Shelton Benjamin, and Matt Hardy as the participants. It started off with every superstar trying to incapacitate each other long enough to climb and retrieve the briefcase. In between Swagger was stuck in between a ladder with Christian and Hardy hitting him with two ladders of their own. Another instance was when Bourne performed a shooting star press, known as \"Air Bourne\", on Christian from a vertically placed ladder wedged between another and the middle rope. The match came to an end when Swagger hit Christian with the Money in the Bank briefcase and unhooked it to become the new Mr. Money in the Bank.\nAfter that match, the WWE Hall of Fame Class of 2010 was introduced.\nThe fourth match was contested between Triple H and Sheamus. The match started with Sheamus taunting Triple H and calling himself the future of the business. He then spent most of the time dominating Triple H with his backbreaker and submission moves. Triple H then took back control of the match by performing a Facebreaker knee smash and spinebuster on Sheamus. Sheamus then executed a \"Brogue Kick\" on Triple H for a near-fall, and then tried to execute a powerbomb only for Triple H to reverse and execute a \"Pedigree\" to win the match.\nIn the fifth match, CM Punk faced Rey Mysterio. A malfunction in Mysterio's opening delayed the match. The bout went evenly matched throughout with neither superstars managing to get the advantage for long. CM Punk's disciples Luke Gallows and Serena attempted to interfere throughout the match. The end came when Serena distracted the referee and Gallows tried to distract Rey Mysterio. Punk lifted Mysterio from behind and attempted to execute the \"G.T.S\" but was reversed into the \"619\". Mysterio then executed a diving splash and pinned him for the win.\nMr. McMahon took on Bret Hart next, with Bruce Hart as the special guest referee. McMahon entered and informed Hart that he wanted to give him a \"WrestleMania sized\" screwing and called out Hart's family, asserted he had paid them to turn on Hart. Hart then informed McMahon that his family had informed him about this before and that they would screw Vince instead. The match included members of the Hart family including The Hart Dynasty beating on McMahon. Hart then placed McMahon in the \"Sharpshooter\", with McMahon tapping out to end the match.\nMain event matches.\nThe seventh match was for the World Heavyweight Championship between Edge and reigning champion Chris Jericho. Each man tried to get the better of each other only to be countered every time. Edge tried for a Spear but Jericho countered with a \"Codebreaker\" for a near-fall. He applied the \"Walls of Jericho\", but Edge was able to break the hold. The match ended when Jericho hit Edge with the championship belt and executed a second \"Codebreaker\" to win and retain his title. After the match, Jericho attempted to attack Edge but was fought off and speared by Edge through the barricade.\nNext, a ten-diva tag team match pitted Women's Champion Michelle McCool, Divas Champion Maryse, Layla, Alicia Fox, and Vickie Guerrero against Mickie James, Beth Phoenix, Eve, Kelly Kelly, and Gail Kim. Guerrero pinned Kelly to win the match for her team.\nThe penultimate match was Batista defending the WWE Championship against John Cena. Cena entered the ring after a performance from the U.S. Air Force Honor Guard Drill Team. Batista dominated the first half of the match. Cena made a return after hitting a suplex. The match started to go evenly after that. An instance included Cena executing the \"Five Knuckle Shuffle\" off the top turnbuckle. Then Batista delivered a \"Batista Bomb\" for a two-count and Cena delivered an \"Attitude Adjustment\" for a two-count. The match came to an end after Cena reversed a \"Batista Bomb\" into an \"STF\". Batista eventually submitted. Cena won the match and the WWE Championship, making him a nine-time World champion.\nThe 10th and final match of the event was billed as \"Streak vs Career\" and pitted The Undertaker against Shawn Michaels. The match started out with both men executing their signature moves early on. The Undertaker injured his leg while performing \"Old School\" and Shawn focused on his leg. The action then went outside the ring. An instance included Undertaker executing a \"Tombstone Piledriver\" on the stadium floor, but Michaels kicked out when Undertaker tried to pin him in the ring. Later in the match, Michaels executed a \"Sweet Chin Music\" for a near-fall. Soon after, Undertaker also executed a \"Chokeslam\" and a \"Last Ride\" successfully, but Michaels kicked out of each. Michaels also applied numerous submission maneuvers on Undertaker's injured ankle, such as the \"Ankle Lock\", \"Figure Four Leglock\", and \"Crossface\", but The Undertaker was successful in countering all of them. Undertaker also applied the \"Hell's Gate\", but Michaels reversed it into a pin attempt, with Undertaker kicking out at two. When the action spilled outside again, Undertaker attempted a \"Last Ride\" on the announce table, but Michaels countered it and executed a second \"Sweet Chin Music\", which placed the Undertaker on top of the announce table. Michaels performed a moonsault aiming at the Undertaker's injured ankle through the announce table. After taking The Undertaker back in the ring again, Michaels then executed his third \"Sweet Chin Music\" for a dramatic near-fall. Michaels then attempted \"Sweet Chin Music\" again but Undertaker countered into a \"Chokeslam\", and quickly followed up by executing a second \"Tombstone Piledriver\" for a near fall. Undertaker began to signal the end for Michaels, but stopped his cut-throat action and told Michaels to stay down. Michaels, however, taunted Undertaker by completing the action on his own and slapping him in the face. Then Undertaker responded with a third jumping \"Tombstone Piledriver\" and pinned the fallen Michaels for the win, and extended his undefeated streak at WrestleMania to 18–0, ending Michaels' career. After the match, the two shook hands and embraced. Undertaker soon left and Michaels interacted with the fans for the final time as the event came to a close.\nReception.\nThe event has received mixed to positive reviews from critics. Canadian Online Explorer's professional wrestling section gave the entire event 6.5 out of 10, down from its WrestleMania 25 rating of 9 out of 10. The Money in the Bank ladder match received 7 out of 10, the World Heavyweight Championship match received 8 out of 10 and the WWE Championship received 6.5 out of 10. The main event received a 9.5 out of 10 rating. WrestleMania 26 was also ranked 1st by YouTube wrestling channel Cultaholic in their 2020 ranking of every 2010 PPV from Worst to Best.\nThe main event was ranked as the best WrestleMania main event of all time by Cultaholic in 2019. Drew McIntyre, who was originally supposed to face The Undertaker at the event, called the bout \"a phenomenal match\".\nAftermath.\nThe next night on \"Raw\", Shawn Michaels gave his farewell address to the fans. The episode was a tribute to Michaels, with many vignettes airing periodically before commercials, highlighting his accomplishments and his greatest matches. In his address, Michaels thanked all the fans and specifically Vince McMahon, Bret Hart and Triple H on supporting him throughout his career. The Undertaker also made an appearance when he tipped his hat to Shawn as a sign of respect.\nBefore Michaels' farewell speech, Triple H came out and stated how much he would miss him and remembered all the good times they had. Before he could continue any more, however, he was attacked by his WrestleMania opponent Sheamus. This set up a rematch between the two in a Street Fight at Extreme Rules. Not only would Sheamus win that match, but he would also put Triple H out of action indefinitely following a round of Brogue Kicks to Triple H's skull.\nThe feud between Batista and John Cena continued as Batista came out and demanded he be awarded the WWE Championship back and that he never lost the match at WrestleMania in the first place. Later on, after a tag team match, Batista attacked Cena and said that he wouldn't be making anyone tap out anymore as he invoked his rematch clause at Extreme Rules and that it would be a Last Man Standing match. Cena emerged victorious after duct-taping Batista's legs to the ring post. The two would face off one final time at Over the Limit in an \"I Quit\" match, and after making him scream \"I Quit!\", Cena would then slam Batista through the stage set off the top of an automobile. The next night on \"Raw\", an injured Batista quit the company out of frustration over the losses and new \"Raw\" general manager Bret Hart denying him a future rematch against Cena.\nOn the episode of \"SmackDown\" after WrestleMania, Chris Jericho came out to flaunt the fact that he had defeated Edge at the event. In the middle of his speech, Edge attacked him again and hit him with another spear after stripping Jericho, revealing his injured ribs as a result of Edge's spear at Wrestlemania. Jack Swagger then came from behind and hit Edge with the Money in the Bank briefcase he had won at WrestleMania. He then cashed in his title opportunity and performed a Gutwrench Powerbomb on Jericho, thus winning the World Heavyweight Championship."

        "title": "Provincial League (baseball)",
        "text": "The Provincial League, sometimes known as the Quebec Provincial League, was a minor league baseball league based in the Canadian province of Quebec. It went through a number of incarnations during the 20th century, spending time as both an independent baseball league (1922–23, 1935–1939, 1948–49, and 1958–1971) and as a member of the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues (1924, 1940, and 1950–1955). It is notable as a successful independent league at a time when few existed, and was a haven for black and indigenous players excluded from organized baseball.\nEarly history.\nThe Provincial League was part of a long history of Quebec-based minor leagues. The first iterations played in 1894 and 1900. Later, the Ontario–Quebec–Vermont League played from 1922 to 1924, spending two years as an independent league before joining the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues, the governing body of minor league baseball, in its last season. Like later incarnations of the league, it was the product of Canadian Pacific Railway sports promoter Joseph Page and retired Major League Baseball pitcher Jean Dubuc, who labored extensively to set up teams in towns with Canadian Pacific stops.\nThe Provincial League concept was relaunched in 1935. The league spent five seasons as an independent circuit before joining the NAPBL as a Class B league in 1940. Throughout this time, the most successful clubs were Quebec City and Trois-Rivières. The Provincial League took a hiatus during World War II, and returned afterward as an independent league with inconsistent levels of success. By 1948 it was again a fully professional six-team league, though outside the purview of the NAPBL. In 1950 it rejoined the NAPBL as a Class C circuit, following a similar pattern to earlier successful independent organizations. It lasted until 1955 before folding. In 1958 the final iteration of the Provincial League launched; it lasted until 1971 as an independent organization.\nThe Provincial League has drawn some scholarly attention as a professional independent circuit during a time when very few such leagues existed. Especially in the late 1930s, it was known as safe haven for black and indigenous players who were excluded from the organized leagues. During this time, the opportunities it offered drew black players from across North America, and it even once included a team representing the Caughnawaga Mohawk reservation. Other notable players included Maurice Richard, Pete Gray, Adrián Zabala, Roland Gladu, and a retired Félix Mantilla."

Jacobs may have been the first aboriginal ice hockey player in the NHL.\nPlaying career.\nJacobs was a resident of the Kahnawake Mohawk Territory, south of Montreal. Jacobs was proficient as a youth playing lacrosse. Photographs exist of Jacobs as a member of the reserve lacrosse team in 1910.\nJacobs was also proficient at ice hockey. He is first recorded on a hockey team with Dominion Bridge Company team in the 1912–13 season. Records exist for Jacobs playing for various teams from 1912 through 1916 and from 1917 through 1925, the last recorded team being the amateur Cleveland Ohio Blues of the USAHA.\nJacobs' record in the NHL is unclear. Jacobs was invited to the Toronto Arenas' training camp in December 1918. Jacobs potentially earned an opening-day roster spot but an announcement in the \"Toronto Globe\" indicated he was returning to the Montreal area instead. Jacobs played several games for the Montreal Stars of the Montreal Hockey League that season. Jacobs is recorded in referee reports for five games for Toronto between December 31 and February 4. However no newspaper reports list Jacobs as being in the lineup for any of those games. He may have been a substitute and did not play. Jacobs is recorded in an Ottawa paper for the opening-day December 23 game, but no other newspaper included Jacobs in the game report. An NHL report for the season records Jacobs as only participating in the December 31 game.\nUS census records for 1930 and 1940 list Jacobs as living in Detroit with his wife Alice."

He was picked up by the National League's Washington Senators in July 1899; but after batting just .234 in 14 games, he was released.

Duncan never played again after the 1899 season ended.\nTwo years later at the age of 30, Duncan drowned during a fishing trip on October 16, 1901, in Foxburg, Pennsylvania. According to a newspaper report, \"In company with two friends, he went out in a row boat to fish, taking a quantity of dynamite to kill the fish.

USA defeated Australia in the finals to win the tournament.\nSponsoring organizations.\nThe event is sponsored by the Federation of International Lacrosse (FIL) and the \"Czech Women’s Lacrosse\" (CWL). This tournament was first held in 1982 and is held every four years. It is the first major event to be sponsored by the FIL. In August 2008, the men's international governing body \"International Lacrosse Federation\" merged with the former governing body for women's lacrosse, the \"International Federation of Women's Lacrosse Associations\", to form the Federation of International Lacrosse (FIL).\nThe CWL also sponsors the 12th annual Prague Cup as an associated event. This tournament, held at the same venue as the World Cup, allows international club teams to compete at the same time in the open event.\nTeams.\nSixteen teams, the most ever, competed in the 2009 World Cup tournament. New entries include: Austria, Denmark, Haudenosaunee, Ireland, South Korea, and the Netherlands. The Haudenosaunee is the first team of women to represent the indigenous peoples of the Americas in the Women's World Cup. Lacrosse is seen as a sacred sport to the Iroquois and was traditionally a sport reserved for only men. In earlier tournaments, clan mothers protested the women's team playing the sacred sport and threatened to lay down on the field to prevent them from playing.\nThe tournament saw the return of defending gold medal winners Australia, as well as Canada, England, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Scotland, United States, Wales and the Czech Republic.\nTeams were split into three separate pools. Pool A (Australia, United States, England, Canada, and Japan) and Pool B (Wales, Scotland, Czech Republic, Germany and New Zealand) played round robins games against each team in their pool seeding for the quarterfinals. Pool C (Austria, Denmark, Haudenosaunee, Ireland, Korea and Netherlands) played in two mini-pools ((I)&amp; (II)) to determine who will advance to the next round of play.

        "text": "Michael P. McCoy (born April 1, 1972) is an American football coach and former player who is the quarterbacks coach for the Jacksonville Jaguars of the National Football League (NFL). He has previously spent time as quarterbacks coach for the Carolina Panthers, the offensive coordinator of the Denver Broncos and Arizona Cardinals, and four seasons as head coach of the San Diego Chargers.\nPlaying career.\nLong Beach State.\nAfter graduating from San Marin High School in Novato, California, McCoy attended California State University, Long Beach, where he redshirted his first year. During his redshirt freshman season in 1991, McCoy played in eight games for the Long Beach State 49ers, starting five of them. He completed 87 of 165 passes for 938 yards, seven touchdowns and three interceptions. \nUtah.\nWhen Long Beach State discontinued its football program in December 1991, McCoy transferred to the University of Utah. In his first season with the Utes, he served primarily as the backup to senior Frank Dolce. He saw action in six games, starting two contests while Dolce was injured. He continued as the starter for the 1993 and 1994 seasons, with career totals at Utah of 7,404 yards passing, 49 TD, 23 Int, completing 63.7% for a rating of 146.1.\nHis collegiate career ended dramatically in 1994 when he threw a game-winning, 5-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Kevin Dyson in the final minute to give Utah a 16–13 win over Arizona in the Freedom Bowl. He led the Utes to a season-ending top ten national ranking.\nProfessional.\nAfter he wasn't selected in the 1995 NFL Draft, McCoy signed with the Denver Broncos as a rookie free agent but was cut during the preseason. In November of that year, the Green Bay Packers signed him to their practice squad following injuries to Brett Favre and his backup Ty Detmer. McCoy also had stints with the Amsterdam Admirals, San Francisco 49ers, Philadelphia Eagles and Seattle Seahawks. McCoy played two years in the CFL with the Calgary Stampeders behind Dave Dickenson.\nCoaching career.\nCarolina Panthers.\nFrom 2000 to 2008, McCoy served on the Carolina Panthers coaching staff, appearing in Super Bowl XXXVIII with the Panthers.\nDenver Broncos.\nAfter the 2008 season, Mike McCoy was hired to be the new offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach of the Denver Broncos. In 2009, then-Broncos QB Kyle Orton enjoyed a career year under McCoy, posting career highs in virtually every passing category. The following year, the Broncos passing attack ranked seventh in the NFL, and Orton ranked fourth in the league in passing yards per game. McCoy revamped the Broncos offense in 2011 to accommodate Tim Tebow's skill-set, and the Broncos led the NFL in rushing.\nOn December 31, 2012, Chicago Bears head coach Lovie Smith was fired, and the Bears asked the Broncos for permission to interview McCoy for the head coach position.\nIn addition to the Bears, the Arizona Cardinals, Buffalo Bills, San Diego Chargers, and Philadelphia Eagles also asked and were granted permission to interview McCoy for their vacant head coaching positions during the Broncos' playoff bye week. When asked about McCoy being a hot head coaching candidate, Denver head coach John Fox responded, \"he’s a heck-of-a coach.\"\nSan Diego Chargers.\nOn January 15, 2013, McCoy became the head coach of the San Diego Chargers, succeeding Norv Turner. McCoy was the youngest active head coach in the NFL and the second-youngest in team history; Al Saunders was 39 years old when he became head coach in 1986. He earned his first win as a head coach on September 15, 2013, against Chip Kelly and the Philadelphia Eagles.\nStarting the season with a paltry 4–6 record, the Chargers won 5 of their last 6 games – winning 4 straight to end the season – and finished the regular season with a 9–7 record. McCoy led the Chargers to a playoff berth as the AFC's 6th seed. The Chargers had not made the playoffs since 2009. McCoy's Chargers upset the Cincinnati Bengals to a 27–10 victory in the Wild Card round. This was the Chargers' first playoff victory since 2008. The Chargers' win streak would end in the next round of the playoffs with a 24–17 loss to the eventual AFC Champion Denver Broncos.\nDespite their success in 2013, the Chargers went 9–7, 4–12 and 5–11 in the next three seasons. McCoy was fired on January 1, 2017 after their 37–27 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. McCoy ended his Chargers tenure with a 28–38 record. A little over two weeks later, the Chargers announced their intention to move to Los Angeles after 56 years in San Diego, making McCoy the last person to coach a professional football team in the city until Mike Martz coached the San Diego Fleet of the Alliance of American Football in 2019. To date, he is the last person to coach an NFL team in the city.\nReturn to Denver.\nOn January 13, 2017, McCoy was named the offensive coordinator of the Denver Broncos. He was fired after a six-game losing streak on November 20, 2017.\nArizona Cardinals.\nOn January 25, 2018, McCoy was hired by the Arizona Cardinals as the offensive coordinator, replacing Harold Goodwin. On October 19, 2018, McCoy was fired after offensive struggles with the team and was replaced by Byron Leftwich.\nJacksonville Jaguars.\nOn February 7, 2022, McCoy was hired by the Jacksonville Jaguars to serve as the team's quarterbacks coach for the 2022 season.\nPersonal life.\nA native of Novato, California, McCoy and his wife Kellie have two children, a daughter and a son, Olivia and Luke."

        "text": "The Providence Friars men's basketball team represents Providence College in NCAA Division I competition. They were a founding member of the original Big East Conference from 1979 until 2013, and are now a member of the current Big East Conference. They play their home games at the Amica Mutual Pavilion in Providence, Rhode Island.\nThe Friars have made two Final Four appearances in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, in 1973 and 1987. Four former players or coachesDave Gavitt, John Thompson, Rick Pitino, and Lenny Wilkensare enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. In addition, two-time NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament champion, current Chicago Bulls head coach Billy Donovan, helped lead the Friars (as a player) to the Final Four in 1987.\nHistory.\nEarly years: 1921-1955.\nProvidence Friars basketball can be traced back to 1921, when the four-year-old school fielded its first basketball team on an informal basis. This first team only lasted two years, however, and did not return until the 1926–27 season when Archie Golembeski, the school's football coach, led to the team to a win over St. John's before devoting his time to football the next year. He was replaced by Al McClellan, who coached the team to four New England championships — 1929, 1930, 1932, and 1935 — and had an overall winning percentage over .700. In 1938, McClellan left and was replaced by Ed Crotty, who led the team to a 15–5 record in 1942–43 before the team suspended play the next year after the outbreak of World War II. After the war, the NCAA divided its teams into two divisions, the University Division and the College Division; with a smaller enrollment and no home court (the team played in an on-campus auditorium and then local high school gyms), the Friars were placed into the College Division and no longer faced the opponents they once played.\nMullaney era: 1955-1969.\nIn 1949, Vin Cuddy was hired as the team's head coach, leading the team to a 14–9 record in his first season and qualified for the NAIB regional tournament in 1951, behind the school's first 1,000-point scorer, Jim Schlimm. By 1955, Cuddy's record fell to 9–12 and he was replaced by Joe Mullaney; at the same time, the school opened its first on-campus gym, Alumni Hall. In 1959, Mullaney and the Friars defeated ranked Villanova on the road, leading to their first-ever National Invitational Tournament bid.\nThe Friars reached the NIT Finals in 1960 with future hall-of-famer Lenny Wilkens being named MVP in his senior season before winning the tournament in 1961 behind Vin Ernst, John Egan, and Jim Hadnot. Two years later, led by another future hall of famer, John Thompson, as well as future Boston Mayor Ray Flynn, the Friars won their second NIT title. With a 24–2 record in 1964–65, the number four ranked Friars reached the Elite Eight of the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. In 1966–67, Jimmy Walker led the nation in scoring and became the school's first 2,000-point scorer as well as the first New England player selected first overall in the NBA draft. That season also marked the last in Mullaney's run of nine consecutive 20-win seasons. Two years later, Mullaney was hired as the head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers of the NBA.\nGavitt era: 1969-1979.\nFollowing Mullaney's departure, Dave Gavitt, an assistant under Mullaney who then became head coach at Dartmouth, took over as the Friars' head coach in 1969. In his second year, Gavitt began a string of eight consecutive 20-win seasons. For the 1972–73 season, the team began playing in downtown Providence at the brand-new 12,000-seat arena, the Providence Civic Center (renamed the Dunkin' Donuts Center in 2001). That season was the Friars' best to date; led by Ernie DiGregorio and the troubled center Marvin Barnes, the team went on a 17-team game winning streak that ended in a Final Four loss to Memphis State. The next year, the Friars posted a 28–4 record and made their second straight Sweet Sixteen appearance. The team continued its top-flight status with back-to-back 20-win seasons in 1976–77 and 1977–78, earning NCAA tournament bids each year, one coming after defeating top-ranked Michigan in 1976. After a 10–16 season in 1978–79, Gavitt left Providence to become the first commissioner of the Providence-based Big East Conference. He finished his 10-year career at Providence with a 209–84 (.713) record.\nMullaney returns: 1979-1985.\nAfter spending the first six decades of their existence as an independent, the Friars joined the Big East in its inaugural season, 1979–80. The conference originally consisted of Providence, Boston College, Georgetown, St. John's, Seton Hall, Syracuse, and Connecticut. New head coach Gary Walters led the team to an 11–16 record in 1979–80, and was replaced by Mullaney in 1981. His next stint with the Friars would not be as successful, and consisted of only one winning season (1983–84, behind Otis Thorpe) against three losing.\nPitino era: 1985-1987.\nIn 1985, New York Knicks assistant coach Rick Pitino was hired as the latest Friars head coach. In his first season the Friars compiled a 17–14 record and made their first NIT appearance in a decade. The next year, 1986–87, the Friars posted a 25–9 record behind Billy Donovan and made their second-ever Final Four appearance in the 1987 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. After losing to Syracuse, Pitino left the school and re-joined the Knicks as their head coach in 1987. The Friars have not returned to the Final Four since Pitino's departure.\nChiesa, Barnes, Gillen: 1987-1998.\nIn 1987–88, the Friars posted a losing record under new head coach Gordie Chiesa, who was replaced by Rick Barnes after the season.

Led by Thomas, the Friars made an NIT bid in 1999. The team returned to the NCAA tournament two years later, posting a 21–10 record behind John Linehan. While the Friars posted a losing record in Linehan's senior season in 2001–02, the guard broke Allen Iverson's single-season Big East steals record of 67 as well as Murdock's NCAA career steals record of 377. Led by Ryan Gomes, the Friars returned to the NIT with an 18–14 record in 2002–03 and made another NCAA appearance in 2003–04 with a 20–9 record.

In 2009–10, Davis' team lost their final 11 games to finish 15th in the Big East. The Friars averaged 82 points per game, the fourth highest in Division I, while also surrendering 85 points per conference game, the worst statistical performance in Big East history. In Davis' third season, 2010–11, the Friars finished 14th in the conference despite having Division I's second-leading scorer in Marshon Brooks. Davis was fired after the 2010–11 season.\nCooley era: 2011-2023.\nOn March 22, 2011, the Friars hired Fairfield head coach Ed Cooley, as the 15th head coach in program history. A Providence native, Cooley brought a reinvigorated energy surrounding the program and recruited six consensus Top 100 recruits in his first three years.\n2011–12 season.\nIn his first season at Providence, Cooley led the Friars to a 15–17 mark overall, posting an 11–3 mark (8–0 at home) in non-conference action and going 4–14 in the Big East. That season, point guard Vincent Council was named All-Big East Third Team and forward LaDontae Henton earned Big East All-Rookie Team accolades.\n2012–13 season — NIT quarterfinals.\nIn his second season, Cooley led the Friars to a 19–15 record overall and a 9–9 mark in league play. Included in the 9–9 Big East record in 2012–13 was a 7–2 mark over the last nine games of the conference season, marking the second best turnaround over second half of the season in Big East history. The Friars played the season with a short roster with transfers Carson Desrosier and Tyler Harris having to sit out the year per NCAA transfer rules, five star Freshman shooting guard and Providence native Ricky Ledo sitting our per NCAA eligibility issues, and five star Freshman point guard Kris Dunn sitting out the first semester with a shoulder injury. Friars Freshman guard Josh Fortune, was the only incoming player in 2012–2013 season eligible to compete. Cooley guided the Friars to the NIT where the squad posted a 2–1 record, beating Charlotte and Robert Morris before losing in the quarterfinals to eventual NIT Champion Baylor. That season, combo guard Bryce Cotton was named All-Big East First Team and Kadeem Batts was recognized as a co-winner of the league's Most Improved Award and earned All-Big East Honorable Mention accolades. After spending one year at Providence without being able to play, Ledo declared for the 2013 NBA Draft and was drafted by the Minnesota Timberwolves, eventually being traded to the Dallas Mavericks.\n2013–14 season — Big East tournament champions / NCAA tournament first round.\nIn his third season at Providence, Cooley led the Friars to a 10–8 mark in the Big East Conference and finished tied for 3rd with Xavier and St. John's. Transfers, Junior forward Carson Desrosiers and Sophomore forward Tyler Harris, were eligible to play their first season in black and white, having sat out the NCAA-enforced one-year period. However, in addition to former Senior point guard Vincent Council's graduation and Ricky Ledo entering the draft, Sophomore point guard Kris Dunn faced another shoulder injury and had to sit out almost the entire year as a medical redshirt, Cleveland State transfer Sophomore guard Junior Lamomba had to sit out the NCAA-enforced one-year period, and incoming Freshmen Brandon Austin and Rodney Bullock were suspended for the entire season due to an unspecified violation of team rules. The Friars finished the season at 23–12 overall, the most wins in a season since 1996–1997. Two players received regular season honors, Senior point guard Bryce Cotton was named All-Big East First Team and Senior forward Kadeem Batts earned All-Big East Second Team accolades. Entering the Big East Tournament, the Friars played as the 4th seed due to losing the tie-breaker with Xavier. They defeated St. John's in the Quarterfinals, Seton Hall in the semifinals, and Creighton in the thrilling final at Madison Square Garden, claiming PC's second tournament title in Big East history. By winning the Big East Tournament the team earned an automatic bid, removing any \"bubble\" fears. On their way to making history as the first tournament champion of the reconfigured league, Junior forward Ladontae Henton was named to the All-Tournament Team and Senior guard Bryce Cotton was named the tournaments Most Outstanding Player. On selection Sunday, the Friars were given the 11th seed in the 2014 NCAA tournament East Regional and faced the UNC.

The Friars clinched the title at home in front of a sold out Dunkin Donuts Center crowd. The Friars spent most of this season ranked in the AP and Coaches top 25 Polls reaching as high as 8/9 on Feb 14, 2022.\n2022-2023 season — Coach Cooley's final season with the Friars.\nThe Friars finished their season with a 13–7 record in Big East play and a 21–12 record overall, including a loss to UConn in the Big East tournament quarterfinals and a First Round loss to the University of Kentucky in the NCAA tournament.

Their record is 0–1.\nArena.\nThe Providence Friars men's basketball team has been playing at the Amica Mutual Pavilion (aka \"the AMP\") since its inception in 1972, having played almost all of its home basketball games at the arena since it opened. The Amica Mutual Pavilion took over naming rights in 2022. The Amp (formerly Providence Civic Center and Dunkin’ Donuts Center (aka \"The Dunk\") ) is an indoor arena, located in downtown Providence, Rhode Island, and seats approximately 12,410 fans for basketball games. In 2001, the arena was named the Dunkin' Donuts Center as part of a naming-rights deal with Dunkin' Donuts. Ironically they served Dunkin coffee but no actual Donuts. In December 2005, the Rhode Island Convention Center Authority purchased the building from the city of Providence and spent $80 million on an extensive renovation connecting it indoor to the Convention center and a nearby luxury hotel. Renovations were also inclusive of a new Jumbotron, luxury suites, HVAC chiller, upgraded concessions, concourse updates, new seating bowl and other amenities. Since the renovations, the arena has been touted as one of the most state of the art arenas and one of the best atmospheres in the NCAA. The fans are known for being knowledgeable of basketball, and hostile to visiting teams and coaches. This has resulted in one of the best home records in D1 basketball since 2021-2022. Prior to playing at the Amica Mutual Pavilion, the Friars played on campus at Alumni Hall (Providence) from 1955 until moving to the AMP in 1972. Alumni Hall seated approximately 2,600 fans from 1955 until its renovation in 2012, and now seats approximately 1,850 fans. \nRivalries.\nVillanova Wildcats.\nThe two smallest schools in the original Big East, Providence and the Villanova Wildcats, currently battle at least twice each year during conference play. The two teams first met on February 15, 1936, resulting in a 46–37 Friars victory. Villanova leads the all-time series, 67-42 since 1949-1950. The rivalry is elevated by the Catholic orders which run the schools; Providence's Dominicans and Villanova's Augustinians.\nBoston College Eagles.\nThese two former Big East rivals are in adjacent states with both teams said to have among the most intense fans in New England. Though they now reside in separate conferences, they still meet occasionally during non-conference play.\nConnecticut Huskies.\nThe only two New England schools in the old Big East for its final eight seasons, these two schools fought for New England bragging rights each year until the 2013 season, when Providence and 6 other teams in the \"Catholic 7\" broke away to form the new Big East and UConn remained in the now-called American Athletic Conference. UConn joined the new Big East and started playing in the conference in 2020, renewing the rivalry.\nRhode Island Rams.\nThe annual Rhode Island State Championship game is played between these schools once a year and is considered often to be the highlight of the schedule for the Rams. The game now alternates annually between Providence (The Amp) and Kingston The Ryan Center always resulting in a rare home sellout for Rhode Island in their year hosting. The annual match-up is usually played in December and has produced many memorable games and moments for both teams over the years. In recent years Providence has dominated the rivalry and holds a commanding 64-26 advantage since 1949-1950\nSocial Media.\nProvidence basketball has a presence and notable fan following on:\nfacebook\nInstagram\nX (formerly twitter)\nThe Friartown following on X (formerly twitter) is rabid and uses #pcbb"

        "text": "John Oldham (June 22, 1923 – November 23, 2020) was an American college and professional basketball player, college basketball coach and athletic director. Oldham interrupted his studies at Western Kentucky University (WKU) to serve in the US Navy during World War II. He was on the university's basketball team and after graduation in 1949 played for the Fort Wayne Pistons. Oldham went into coaching in 1952 at College High School in Bowling Green, Kentucky.

He returned to WKU in 1964 to coach the Western Kentucky Hilltoppers basketball team, leading them to four NCAA tournaments, one NIT, and winning four Ohio Valley Conference (OVC) championships. In 1971 Oldham was promoted to athletic director at WKU, a position he held until 1986. During his tenure the university won six OVC and one Sun Belt Conference All-Sports Championship. After retirement he was elected to the Bowling Green City Commission.\nCareer.\nOldham came to Western Kentucky University in 1942 after earning All-State honors at Hartford High School. In 1943 he left college to serve in the United States Navy during World War II. He returned to the college in 1946, graduating in 1949. The teams he played on at Western were nationally ranked, participated in three National Invitation Tournaments, including a 3rd-place finish in 1948, won three KIAC titles, one SIAA championship, and the first Ohio Valley Conference title. He was a United Press and Associated Press All-American in 1949.

He led the school to three conference championships and its first two appearances in the NCAA tournament. Oldham returned to coach his alma mater, the Western Kentucky Hilltoppers, in 1964, taking over for his former coach Edgar Diddle who retired after 42 years at the school. In seven seasons, he finished 146–41 with a 78% winning percentage, leading them to four NCAA tournaments and an NIT berth while winning five Ohio Valley Conference championships. He led the Hilltoppers to the 1971 NCAA tournament to the Final Four and finished third overall. Their third-place finish was later vacated by the NCAA due to allegations that one of their players, Jim McDaniels, had signed a professional contract prior to the end of the season. He was named Ohio Valley Conference coach of the year four times.\nIn 1971 Oldham was named Athletic Director for WKU, and served in that position until his retirement in 1986. During his tenure as AD, WKU won six OVC All-Sports Championships and one Sun Belt Conference All-Sports Championship. He oversaw the football program upgrading from NCAA Division 2 to Division 1AA in 1978, the school leaving the OVC and joining the Sun Belt Conference in 1982, and the Western Kentucky Lady Toppers basketball team becoming one of the top programs in the country. He also hired the school's first African American Head Coach, Clem Haskins as men's basketball coach, in 1980. He has been inducted into the Lions Club Kentucky High School Hall of Fame (1969), Kentucky Athletic Hall of Fame (1986), Ohio Valley Conference Hall of Fame (1989), Kentucky High School Hall of Fame (1990), Tennessee Tech Sports Hall of Fame (1990) and WKU Athletic Hall of Fame (1991).\nIn 1991 Oldham was elected to the Bowling Green City Commission and was re-elected twice, serving as Commissioner through December 1998.\nOldham died at Bowling Green on November 23, 2020, at the age of 97. He was due to be buried in the city's Fairview Cemetery with military honours on November 30.\nCultural impact.\nThe 1971 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers NCAA Final-4 basketball team was the first non-historically black Kentucky collegiate basketball team to start five African-American players. Coach Oldham started Clarence Glover, Jim McDaniels, Jim Rose, Jerry Dunn and Rex Bailey. Oldham was pressured not to start all five together, but said \"they are my best five players.\"\nThe concept of WKU's Red Towel athletics logo was developed by John Oldham in 1971, based on Ed Diddle's use of a red towel while coaching games.\nIn 1980 Oldham hired the first African-American head coach in school history, when he named Clem Haskins basketball coach.\nOn December 27, 2012, WKU honored Oldham in a pregame ceremony in which the court at EA Diddle Arena was named \"John Oldham Court.\" Oldham was a player, basketball coach, and athletic director during his time at WKU.\nCareer playing statistics.\nNBA.\nSource"

        "text": "The men's 100 metres at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics were held at the Olympic Stadium on August 15 and August 16. The two main contenders for the event were the reigning World Champion Tyson Gay and Usain Bolt, the reigning Olympic champion and world record holder. Gay entered the competition with a season's best of 9.77 seconds (an American record) while Bolt's season's best was 9.79 seconds. Four other competitors had broken the 10-second barrier during the last months before the World Championship: former world record holder Asafa Powell, Olympic finalist Churandy Martina and emerging sprinters Daniel Bailey and Mike Rodgers.\nThe first day saw a number of high-profile athletes eliminated; Derrick Atkins, the 2007 silver medallist, did not pass the first round. Churandy Martina, area record holders Samuel Francis and Olusoji Fasuba, Simeon Williamson, and 2003 gold medallist Kim Collins were all knocked out in the quarter-finals. Also, a double false start meant disqualification for the new European junior record holder Christophe Lemaitre. Gay, Powell and Rodgers ended with the fastest times of the day, although Bolt and Bailey comfortably won heat five, exchanging smiles and glances in the process. The semi-finals saw Bolt—typically slow out of the blocks—false start for the first time over 100 m, but he eventually finished in 9.89 seconds (the fastest ever semi-final). Six of the eight qualifying athletes broke 10 seconds, and US champion Rodgers was the biggest name not to qualify.\nThe final, which was advertised in Berlin as \"Das Duell\" between Gay and Bolt, proved to be historic. By the 20-metre mark, Bolt had already taken a slight lead of 0.01 seconds, and he continued to pull away from the rest of the pack until the finish. He finished in a world record-breaking time of 9.58 seconds, beating Gay by some distance, even though the American had run 9.71 seconds, which was the third fastest time ever. Bolt beat his own previous mark by over a tenth of a second, an achievement statisticians claimed was 20 years ahead of schedule in the long term scheme of the 100 metres world record progression. So emphatic was Bolt's winning time, that both bronze medal winner Powell and sixth placed Dwain Chambers said they were happy just taking part in the fastest race in history.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the records were as follows:\nThe following new world, championship and North American records were set during the competition.\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: First 3 in each heat (Q) and the next 4 fastest (q) advance to the quarterfinals.\nQuarterfinals.\nQualification: First 3 in each heat(Q) and the next 1 fastest(q) advance to the semifinals.\nSemifinals.\nFirst 4 of each Semifinal will be directly qualified(Q) for the Finals."

        "text": "National Tennis Leagues (NTL) was a tour for professional male tennis players established in 1967 by George MacCall. In 1970 it was sold to the World Championship Tennis (WCT), a competing professional tennis league run by Lamar Hunt.\nHistory.\nThe National Tennis League (NTL) was formed by former U.S. Davis Cup captain George MacCall in 1967, as a governing body to an American professional tennis tour. MacCall signed several players to contracts, including Arthur Ashe, Rod Laver, Roy Emerson and Stan Smith.\nThe NTL followed in the wake of MacCall's departure from the existing International Professional Tennis Association (IPTA), which had been created by promoter Wallace Dill in 1966, and preceded the creation of World Championship Tennis (WCT), formed by Lamar Hunt and David Dixon The NTL differed from the IPTA and from WCT in being the first to sign women to professional contracts in addition to men.\nIn 1968 Billie Jean King became the first woman of the Open Era to sign a pro contract to tour, in a group with Rosie Casals, Françoise Dürr and Ann Haydon-Jones as the women's section of the National Tennis League. \"On April 1, 1968, we signed with the National Tennis League, as George MacCall's troupe was called. Frankie (Durr) and Rosie (Casals) received a guarantee of $20,000 per annum for two years, mine (Ann Haydon-Jones) was $25,000 and Billie Jean King's was $40,000. George envisaged us playing a lot of matches and tournaments amongst ourselves and did not expect us to be as much involved in open tennis as later proved to be the case...We joined the six men that he already controlled - Emerson, Laver, Gimeno, Gonzales, Rosewall and Stolle. A group of ten was an attractive proposition to offer and he believed he was going to do very well from it. His main problem was one of administration. He had to keep flying all over the world to tie up arrangements with the various associations but didn't leave sufficient time to organize his professional tours in America, the most important part of the operation, and didn't seem to be able or willing to delegate.\"\nIn June 1969 Fred Podesta's formed Tennis Champions Inc. and became the parent company of the NTL with Podesta as president and MacCall as executive director.\nNevertheless, except for the 1969 and 1971 tournaments, many of the best players missed the Australian Open, because of the remoteness, the inconvenient dates (around Christmas and New Year's Day), and the low prize money. In 1970 the National Tennis League (NTL), which employed Rod Laver, Ken Rosewall, Andrés Gimeno, Pancho Gonzales, Roy Emerson and Fred Stolle, prevented its players from entering the tournament because the guarantees were insufficient. The tournament was ultimately won by Arthur Ashe.\nBoth professional organizations, the NTL and WCT, banned their contracted players from contesting the grand slams at some stage during their short tenure and this made the International Lawn Tennis Federation, the predecessor of the current ITF, very nervous. That was the catalyst that led to the abandonment of the distinction between amateur and professional tennis players and by 1968, the beginning of the Open Era, all tennis players could compete in all tennis tournaments George MacCall sold the NTL's player contracts to Lamar Hunt in July 1970. He became the first Commissioner of World Team Tennis in 1974. Some of the players he signed to contracts were: Rod Laver, Ken Rosewall, Roy Emerson, Pancho Gonzales, Fred Stolle, Billie Jean King and Rosie Casals. He traveled the world to sign players. Many tournaments had to get their players through George."

Despite there being two hundredths of a second remaining in the match, the timer could only be reset to a whole second after the mistake.

CHA was originally a men's and women's ice hockey conference, but has been a women's-only conference since 2010 when Niagara and Robert Morris joined Atlantic Hockey, Bemidji State joined the Western Collegiate Hockey Association, and Alabama–Huntsville became an independent school. After the completion of each regular season, it held the CHA Men's Ice Hockey Tournament to determine its men's conference champion. In 2001, CHA commissioned the Bruce M. McLeod Trophy, named after its first commissioner, which was awarded to the tournament champion. In 2003, CHA was granted an annual automatic bid to the NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship for its tournament champion. Before this, the only CHA team to have played in the national championship tournament was Niagara, which received an at-large bid into the 2000 tournament. No CHA team won a national championship, and until 2009, Niagara was the only CHA team to have advanced past the first round. In the 2009 tournament, Bemidji State became the only CHA team and 16th ranked seed to ever advance to the Frozen Four.\nEleven CHA Men's Ice Hockey Tournaments were held during the existence of CHA. The tournament was first hosted at the Von Braun Center in Huntsville, Alabama and was won by Niagara. Bemidji State, Niagara, and Wayne State won the most CHA Men's Ice Hockey Tournaments, with three each. Alabama–Huntsville and Bemidji State had the most championship game appearances, with six each.

Moreno Argentin won the team its first \"monument\", the 1990 Tour of Flanders, followed by a victory at the La Flèche Wallonne. 1990 also saw the team's first Tour de France stage win (Argentin) and two more Girostages (Adriano Baffi).\nIn 1991, Argentin scored another double in Belgium, with wins in La Flèche Wallonne and Liège–Bastogne–Liège. Davide Cassani won three major classics in Italy (Milano–Torino, Giro dell'Emilia and Coppa Agostoni), while Massimiliano Lelli won two Giro stages - finishing third overall. More success followed at the Tour de France as stage wins for Bruno Cenghialta, Argentin and Marco Lietti registered a Tour triple triumph on consecutive days. That followed a team time trial win on Stage 2 into Chassieu that put Rolf Sørensen in the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification for four days.\nAriostea dominated the 1992 Tirreno–Adriatico with five stage wins and the general classification (Sørensen). Giorgio Furlan won the Tour de Suisse, Rolf Gölz the Tour Méditerranéen. There was another stage win in the Giro, this time for Marco Saligari. Roberto Conti finished 9th in the general classification.\nIn 1993, its final year, Ariostea was victorious in the Amstel Gold Race (Rolf Järmann). Bjarne Riis won a Giro stage and placed 5th in the general classification in the Tour de France. Saligari also won a stage in the Giro, and was the winner that year's Tour de Suisse. By far the most successful rider of the team this year was Pascal Richard of Switzerland. He won the Giro del Lazio, Giro di Lombardia, the Tour de Romandie and a handful of stages and one day races throughout the year. In the team's final race, the 1993 Giro di Lombardia, Ariostea riders Pascal Richard and Giorgio Furlan finished first and second, breaking away for the final 6 miles of the race.\nTeam manager Ferretti and a number of riders went to the next year."

The delegation for the 2010 Winter Games consisted of a single alpine skier, Kwame Nkrumah-Acheampong, also known as the \"Snow leopard\". He was also the nation's flag bearer in the Parade of Nations. Nkrumah-Acheampong did not win any medals, finishing behind his fellow African, Samir Azzimani of Morocco.\nBackground.\nGhana first participated in a Summer Olympic Games as the Gold Coast at the 1952 Games in Helsinki, Finland. They participated on 12 occasions prior to 2010, winning four medals along the way; three in boxing and a bronze medal in 1992 for the football team.

They sent a single alpine skier Kwame Nkrumah-Acheampong, who was also selected to be the flag bearer in the Parade of Nations during the opening ceremony.\nAlpine skiing.\nThe sole Ghanaian athlete at the Games, Kwame Nkrumah-Acheampong, competed in the men's slalom. Known as the \"Snow leopard\", Nkrumah-Acheampong was born in Glasgow, Scotland and raised in Accra, Ghana. He moved to England in 2000, and learnt to ski at the ski slope in Milton Keynes after being hired as a receptionist there. He joined the international skiing circuit in 2005, becoming the first black African to do so.\nIn 2009, he qualified for the 2010 Winter Olympics, scoring 137.5 International Ski Federation points, within the required range of 120–140 points.

Nkrumah-Acheampong was one of three African skiers at the 2010 Winter Games, alongside Samir Azzimani of Morocco, and Leyti Seck of Senegal.\nNkrumah-Acheampong only received partial funding from the Ghana Olympic Committee, allowing him to travel to Vancouver, but not covering the travel costs of his support team. When bookmaker Paddy Power discovered the situation, they paid for his manager, coach and physiotherapist to travel to Canada to help his preparation for the Olympics. Nkrumah-Acheampong also sought individual sponsorship for the spots on his leopard spotted ski race suit.\nHe said \"Some people were sceptical, others just did not believe that it was possible to train in such a short period of time and try and qualify, but I think now I can stand up and say it's possible.\" He was listed by \"Time\" as one of the 25 Winter Olympians to watch during the games, and he was placed as a 500–1 shot for the gold medal. In the slalom, Nkrumah-Acheampong registered times of 1:09:08 and 1:13:52 in his two runs, resulting in a final position of 47th overall. This was one place behind Azzimani of Morocco."

        "text": "James Michael Montgomery (born July 10, 1949) is an American former professional football player who was a running back in the National Football League (NFL) for the San Diego Chargers, Dallas Cowboys and Houston Oilers. He played college football for the Kansas State Wildcats.\nEarly years.\nMontgomery attended Dodge City High School, where he played as a quarterback, before being switched to running back as senior. He contributed to the team's 1966 undefeated season, although it resulted only in a league championship title, because at the time there was no playoff system or state championship game.\nHe accepted a football scholarship from Kansas State University, where he played as a running back and wide receiver. In 1969, he posted 408 rushing yards (second on the team), 217 receiving yards and 4 touchdowns. As a senior, he registered 436 rushing yards (second on the team), 386 receiving yards and 4 touchdowns.\nProfessional career.\nSan Diego Chargers.\nMontgomery was selected by the San Diego Chargers in the third round (65th overall) of the 1971 NFL draft. Because of his versatility he was used at running back (60 carries for 226 yards and one touchdown), wide receiver (28 receptions for 361 yards and 2 touchdowns), quarterback (3 of 6 attempts for 80 yards and one touchdown) and on special teams (2 fumble recoveries).\nOn August 1, 1972, he was traded along with wide receiver Billy Parks to the Dallas Cowboys in exchange for running back Duane Thomas, who was a player the Chargers coveted.\nDallas Cowboys.\nIn 1972, he was a backup running back. Playing against his former team the San Diego Chargers, he returned a fumble 54 yards for a touchdown on special teams. He registered 8 receptions for 131 yards, 3 receiving touchdowns, 35 rushes for 81 yards and one rushing touchdown.\nIn 1973, he was moved to wide receiver during training camp. He replaced Otto Stowe in the starting lineup after he suffered a broken ankle in the seventh game of the season against the Philadelphia Eagles, but Montgomery would also fell to injury in the next game and open the door for third-string rookie Drew Pearson to take over and never relinquish the position. He finished the season with 14 receptions for 164 yards and 3 touchdowns.\nOn July 5, 1974, he was traded to the Houston Oilers, after he signed a contract for the 1975 season with the Birmingham Americans of the World Football League. The Cowboys received a fourth round draft choice (#90-Pat Donovan).\nHouston Oilers.\nOn October 24, 1974, he suffered a serious knee injury against the St. Louis Cardinals. He later had a blood clot from complications from the surgery. He appeared in 5 games and made 9 receptions for 179 yards and one touchdown.\nMontgomery spent the next year on the injured reserve list. On August 24, 1976, he was released after not being able to fully recover from his previous injury."

        "title": "List of NCAA Division I women's basketball career scoring leaders",
        "text": "In basketball, points are the sum of the score accumulated through free throws or field goals. In National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I basketball, where a player's career is at most four seasons under normal circumstances, it is considered a notable achievement to reach the 1,000-points scored threshold. In even rarer instances, players have reached the 2,000- and 3,000-point plateaus (no player, whether male or female, has ever scored 4,000 or more points at the Division I level). The top 25 highest scorers in NCAA Division I women's basketball history are listed below. While the NCAA's current three-division format has been in place since the 1973–74 season, it did not sponsor women's sports until the 1981–82 school year; before that time, women's college sports were governed by the Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW).\nTo be listed in the NCAA record book, a player must have been active in at least three seasons during the era in which the NCAA governed women's sports—although for those players who qualify for inclusion in the record book, AIAW statistics are included. Most notably, Lynette Woodard of Kansas, whose career total of 3,649 points made her the career scoring leader in women's major-college basketball before Iowa's Caitlin Clark passed her on February 28, 2024, was not recognized as the NCAA career leader because her entire college career (1977–81) predated NCAA sponsorship of women's sports.\nSome players among the top 25 scorers in Division I history played in the era before the three-point line was officially adopted in women's basketball on an experimental basis in 1986–87 and fully in 1987–88. All of the players with a dash through the three-point field goals column were affected by this rule. Valorie Whiteside of Appalachian State is the only three-point shot era player on this list who did not make a single three-point shot, and she only played in one season in which the use of the three-pointer was mandatory.\nThe three-point distance was first marked at from the center of the basket, the same distance then used in NCAA men's basketball. From that point through the 2007–08 season, the three-point lines remained at . On May 3, 2007, the NCAA men's basketball rules committee passed a measure to extend the distance of the men's three-point line back to ; the women's line remained at the original distance until it was moved to match the men's distance effective in 2011–12. The men's distance was changed to match the FIBA standard of in a two-phase implementation that took effect in 2019–20 in Division I and 2020–21 in Divisions II and III, but the women's distance was not changed until 2021–22, when it was moved to match the men's distance. \nThe only player on this list to be enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame is Cheryl Miller.\nThree players among the top 25 played basketball in more than four seasons. Rachel Banham of Minnesota tore her ACL 10 games into her senior season of 2014–15. She qualified for a medical hardship waiver, popularly known as a \"medical redshirt\", that allowed her to compete in a fifth season. Dyaisha Fair of Buffalo and Syracuse and Ashley Joens of Iowa State both benefited from a blanket NCAA waiver that did not count the 2020–21 season, which was impacted by COVID-19, against the athletic eligibility of any basketball player. Two players among the top 25 played at more than one school: Alysha Clark, who played two seasons at Belmont before transferring to Middle Tennessee, and Fair, who played the first three seasons of her career at Buffalo before transferring to Syracuse for her final two seasons of eligibility."

Outside rugby, Meredith later became a literary adjudicator in Eisteddfodau.\nRugby career.\nMeredith was first selected for Wales on 4 February 1888 in the opening game of the Home Nations Championship against Scotland at Rodney Parade. Meredith was one of seven new caps in the Welsh squad, and one of five in the pack, which included fellow Swansea teammates W.H. Howell and T. Williams. Wales won the game thanks to a single try from Thomas Pryce-Jenkins and Meredith was reselected for the next game of the tournament, played away to Ireland at Lansdowne Road. Although the team was more stable in its selection, with the same eight forwards playing, Ireland won comfortably and for eight of the Welsh team it was their last Championship match.\nMeredith found himself dropped for the next season's Championship but unlike most of the 1888 team, found himself back in the Welsh team when he was chosen to play in the opener of the 1890 Championship against Scotland. Played at the Cardiff Arms Park, Wales lost the game and the following game to England was expected to follow the same pattern. Wales had never beaten the English, but the England team had missed the last two seasons after an argument with the Scottish Rugby Union and this was their first Championship game of the tournament. Now under the captaincy of Arthur Gould, Meredith was part of a victorious Wales team, thanks to a clever try from William Stadden. Although part of the winning team, Meredith was never reselected for Wales with Tom Graham taking Meredith's place.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

        "text": "Joel Powers Sherman (November 4, 1890 – December 21, 1987) was an American professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball for the Philadelphia Athletics in 1915.\nBiography.\nA native of Yarmouth, Massachusetts, Sherman attended Barnstable High School, where he and his brother Fred played together on the school's football and baseball teams. Sherman went on to attend the University of Massachusetts Amherst, which was known at the time as \"Massachusetts Agricultural College\". There he played college baseball, and in 1914 was part of a team that featured three future major leaguers in Sherman, Chick Davies, and Lee King.\nSherman began his professional baseball career in 1915, pitching for the Jersey City Skeeters of the International League, where he posted an 11-11 record over 203.2 innings of work. In late September, Sherman was called to the major leagues to join Connie Mack's Philadelphia Athletics. The A's had won the American League pennant in 1914, but had dropped to last place in a historically bad 1915 season. \nSherman's major league debut came on September 24 in the second game of a doubleheader against the Chicago White Sox at Shibe Park. The A's lineup that day featured Baseball Hall of Famer Nap Lajoie at second base, and the White Sox lineup featured another Hall of Fame second baseman in Eddie Collins, as well as Shoeless Joe Jackson in left field. A's starter Tink Turner had lasted only two innings and allowed six runs. Turner had been relieved by Cap Crowell, who pitched the third inning and allowed another five runs. Down 11-0 after three, Mack brought in Sherman for the fourth. Sherman proceeded to pitch the final six innings, allowing only one run on four hits as Philadelphia was downed, 12-5. Sherman came to the plate three times, but did not reach base.\nSherman's second and final major league appearance came six days later on September 30, as the A's visited Griffith Stadium for a game with the Washington Senators. Sherman was the star of the game, as he got the start on the mound against Washington's Harry Harper and went the distance, allowing only one walk, and scattering 11 hits in Philadelphia's 4-3 win. At the plate, Sherman was the lone Athletic with a multi-hit day, recording two singles with a walk and one RBI in four plate appearances. \nSherman returned to the International League in 1916, playing for the Baltimore Orioles, where he posted a 19-16 record in 265 innings on the mound, and boasted a .270 batting average. He returned to Baltimore in 1917, then played for the Hartford Senators of the Eastern League in 1919 and 1920, but never returned to the majors. In his two-game major league career, Sherman posted an impressive 2.40 ERA in 15 innings with one victory on the mound, and a .333 batting average in seven plate appearances.\nA Cape Cod native, Sherman pitched for the Hyannis town team in the Cape Cod Baseball League for many seasons. As a young man, he had played for the team from 1906 to 1913, prior to the formal organization of the Cape League in 1923. Then after a 14-year hiatus he returned to play again for Hyannis in the newly-formed league from 1927 to 1931. Sherman's long career with Hyannis, predating even the league itself, accounts for his being referred to by some as the \"father of the [Cape] league.\"\nSherman married Ethel Hossman, a music instructor from Barnstable, and went on to teach and coach at Westerly High School in Westerly, Rhode Island. He died in 1987 in Cape Coral, Florida at the age of 97."

        "title": "2009 Bowling Green Falcons football team",
        "text": "The 2009 Bowling Green Falcons football team represented Bowling Green State University during the 2009 NCAA Division I FBS football season. They were led by first-year head coach Dave Clawson and played in the East Division of the Mid-American Conference. They played their home games at Doyt Perry Stadium. They finished the season 7–6, 6–2 in MAC play to finish in third place in the East Division. They were invited to the Humanitarian Bowl where they lost to Idaho.\nPreseason.\nCoaching changes.\nOn November 28, 2008, athletic director Greg Christopher announced that head coach Gregg Brandon had been fired after six seasons and 44–30 record, including a 31–18 conference record, which was the best of any MAC coach since 2003 and led the team to three bowl games (2–1) and shares of two East division championships. Christopher stated that a culmination of on and off the field events led to Brandon's dismissal, nine months after Brandon received a three-year contract extension. The on-field problems included the Falcons 6–6 record, which was very disappointing as the Falcons were favored to win the MAC East division, and a 1–4 home record which included losses to Miami (OH) and Eastern Michigan (who finished 2–10 and 3–9 respectively) and a 40–34 double-overtime loss to eventual MAC Champion Buffalo, after the Falcons led the game by 20 points entering the fourth quarter and gave up two touchdowns within the final three minutes of the game. Off the field, eleven Falcons players found themselves in legal troubles, two of which were arrested on drug trafficking charges. The program was also stripped of nine scholarships by the NCAA because of inadequate grades on the association's Academic Progress Report. Christopher stated that Brandon's post-game tirade about the lack of student support and attendance after the Buffalo loss, did not factor into his decision to release the coach.\nOn December 7, 2008, the Falcons lost two valuable coaches to rival Toledo, as defensive coordinator Mike Ward and co-offensive coordinator Matt Campbell were brought to the Rockets by new head coach (and former BG assistant) Tim Beckman. The two assistants left, because they were not guaranteed contracts after Gregg Brandon was fired. Ward was a very influential tool in recruiting and a few recruits were expected to rescind their verbals to Bowling Green, because of his departure.\nOn December 12, 2008, athletic director Greg Christopher named Dave Clawson as the program's 17th head coach. Clawson, served the previous season with Tennessee as the Volunteers' offensive coordinator and had been the head coach at Fordham and Richmond, winning three conference championships and two Div. I-FCS Coach of the Year awards. Others that were considered for the job included former Oklahoma State defensive coordinator Tim Beckman (now head coach at Toledo), Ohio State defensive coordinator Luke Fickell, former Florida offensive coordinator Dan Mullen (now head coach at the University of Florida), Louisville defensive coordinator Ron English, LSU offensive line coach Greg Studrawa, Central Michigan assistant Zach Azzani, Missouri defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus and Purdue defensive coordinator Brock Spack\nOn January 27, 2009, Clawson announced eight additions to his coaching staff for the upcoming season. The list included Shannon Morrison and Joe Trainer hired as co-defensive coordinators, Warren Ruggerio as offensive coordinator, John Hunter as running backs coach, John McDonnell as offensive line coach, Doug Philips as defensive ends coach, Sean Spencer as defensive tackles coach and special teams coordinator, and Clint Dowdle as director of football operations. A month after being introduced as co-defensive coordinator, Joe Trainer left the Falcons to become head coach at Rhode Island, a school that he was previously an assistant and defensive coordinator.\nOn February 2, 2009, quarterbacks coach Jim Hofher left the Falcons to become offensive coordinator at Delaware.\nKey losses.\nClawson dismissed Senior defensive lineman Michael Ream for an undisclosed violation of team rules in April. Ream, who had been suspended in 2007 due to violating team rules, was to be the only senior on Bowling Green's defensive line. When asked about the dismissal, Clawson stated \"We are disappointed that we had to take this step, but when a student-athlete makes a poor decision, he must live with the consequences of his decision.\"\nThe following are some of the key players (all but Ream having graduated) who will be no longer eligible to play in the 2009 season:\nOffense:\nDefense:\nSpecial Teams:\n†-Dismissed from team\nSchedule.\nSources:\nGame summaries.\nTroy.\nThe Dave Clawson era at Bowling Green began with a home contest against the Sun Belt's Troy Trojans in the first meeting between the two schools. The game was also the first time that Bowling Green opened the season at home since 2003. The Falcons came into the game as a 7-point underdog.\nTroy received the opening kickoff and marched 80 yards down the field on ten plays in just under two minutes, led by Troy quarterback Levi Brown, who had played under Clawson at Richmond. Troy running back DuJuan Harris finished off the drive, running the ball in from two yards out to put Troy up 7–0. The teams would trade punts on the next two drives before Bowling Green pushed the ball into Troy's territory. After completing a pass on fourth and six to Troy's 25-yard line, Tyler Sheehan was intercepted by Troy defensive back Bryan Willis ending the Falcons' deepest drive of the first quarter. Troy would push their lead to 14–0 after Brown hit wide receiver Jerrel Jernigan for a 13-yard touchdown. The Falcons would answer on the following drive, as Sheehan hooked up with senior wide receiver Freddie Barnes for a 31-yard touchdown pass cutting Troy's lead to 14–7. Late in the second quarter Troy drove deep into Bowling Green's territory, but their drive stalled at the Falcons' 17-yard line after the Trojans failed to convert on fourth and one. The Falcons would run the clock out and end the half trailing 14–7\nThe Falcons would show a totally different look in the second half effectively shutting the door on the Troy's offense, including forcing a fumble and intercepting Brown twice. The Falcons scored on their second drive of the third quarter, as Sheehan found Barnes for eight yards and their second touchdown of the game. On the first play of the fourth quarter, senior defensive back Roger Williams intercepted a Levi Brown pass at Bowling Green's 29-yard line. Bowling Green would take the lead on the following possession, as freshman kicker Jerry Phillips converted a 21-yard field goal making the score 17–14 in Bowling Green's favor. Bowling Green would score on its second consecutive possession, as junior runningback Willie Geter capped off a 4 play, 49 yard drive with a one-yard rush, increasing the Falcons' lead to 24–14. Bowling Green freshman defensive back Adrien Spencer sealed the win for Bowling Green after he picked Brown off on a fourth and four and took the ball back for a 64-yard interception return for a touchdown, increasing the score to 31–14.\nDuring the game, Bowling Green senior wide receiver Freddie Barnes set the school record for most receptions in a game, as he collected 15 receptions for 157 yards and Clawson became the eighth consecutive coach to win their debut as the head coach at Bowling Green.\nMissouri.\nThe Falcons' second game of the season came on the road against the Big 12's Missouri Tigers who came into the game ranked #25th in the nation. The Falcons entered the game with a 3–1 series advantage, including a 20 – 13 victory the last time the two teams met at Faurot Field in 2001. The Falcons came into the game as a 20-point underdog and were not expected to cause the Tigers much of a threat.\nThe Falcons would start off the game well reaching the red zone on three of their first five drives. The Falcons would strike first as Tyler Sheehan hooked up with sophomore receiver Ray Hutson on a 10-yard touchdown pass late in the first quarter to complete a 10 play, 80-yard drive and give the Falcons a 7–0 lead. On the first play of Missouri's ensuing possession, sophomore quarterback Blaine Gabbert fumbled the ball after being hit by Falcons' senior linebacker Cody Basler and the ball was recovered by junior defensive lineman Carlos Tipton at Missouri's 22-yard line. The Falcons offense would waist the opportunity, going three and out, gaining three yards and having to settle for a 37-yard field goal from freshman kicker Jerry Phillips to push the Falcons lead to 10–0 at the end of the first quarter. The Falcons would recover another fumble in Missouri's territory as senior defensive back Jahmal Brown forced Missouri junior defensive back to fumble the ball on a punt return and junior linebacker Neal Dahlman recovered the ball for the Falcons at Missouri's 18-yard line. The Falcons would waist their second possession with a short field, going three and out for four yards and settling for a 32-yard field goal from Phillips to push the lead to 13–0. The Tigers would get two field goals from sophomore kicker Grant Ressel (38, 46) to cut the Falcon lead to 13–6 at halftime.\nBowling Green would keep the foot on the pedal entering the second half, taking the opening possession of the half 73 yards on 11 plays capped off with a 1-yard touchdown run from Willie Geter to push the Falcons lead to 20–6. From there, the Falcons offense would go stagnant, only gaining five first downs the rest of the game. Missouri would wear down the Falcons' defense starting with an 11 play, 87 yard drive culminating in a 27-yard touchdown pass from Gabbert to Jarred Perry to cut the Falcons' lead to 20–13. Missouri would continue to run down the Falcons scoring on their next two possessions with a 33-yard pass from Gabbert to Wes Kemp and a 1-yard run by Der Washington to give the Tigers the 27–20 lead. The Falcons would have one last chance, taking possession at their own 16-yard line. Sheehan would complete a 17-yard pass to senior receiver Chris Wright on the first play of the drive, but would only complete one of his next four passes as the Falcons turned the ball over on downs near midfield."

        "text": "The Iowa State Cyclones women's basketball team represents Iowa State University (ISU) and competes in the Big 12 Conference of NCAA Division I. The team is coached by Bill Fennelly, who is in his 28th year at Iowa State. The Cyclones play their home games at Hilton Coliseum on Iowa State's campus.\nOverview.\nIowa State University is a national power in women's basketball. Since the expansion of the Big 12 in 1996, ISU has had only three losing seasons, has won three conference titles (1 regular season, 3 tournament), and has the best conference tournament record in the Big 12. Iowa State has made it to and won the Big 12 tournament championship game more times than any team except Oklahoma. Bill Fennelly is the coach of the women's team and largely responsible for building the program. In games played since the Big 12 was founded in 1996, ISU has a winning record against every Big 12 school except Baylor.\nOn a national level, since 1996 the Cyclones have made the NCAA tournament twenty one times, advancing six times to the Sweet Sixteen, including twice to the Elite Eight. Additionally, Iowa State has made the WNIT twice in that span. ISU was in the AP Top 25 poll for over four years and was in the Top 10 for 34 consecutive weeks starting in the 1999 season. ISU has been ranked in the top 10 for attendance every season since 1999–2000, including a #3 ranking for the 2008–2009 season which led all Big 12 schools and #2 nationally for the 2012–2013 season.\nHistory.\nGloria Crosby (1973–1974).\nIn 1973, Coach Gloria Crosby led the Iowa State Women's Basketball team through their first season as a Division I program. Prior to that, women were only able to play intramural basketball. The team, at that point known as the \"Cagers\", played their first game on January 12, 1974, losing to Northern Iowa by 73–38. Crosby and the Iowa State Women's Basketball team got their first win a week later over Wartburg, 51–38. Gloria Crosby coached just one season and finished her basketball coach career at ISU with an 8–8 record. She would become the head coach of the Iowa State Softball team.\nLynn Wheeler (1974–1980).\nLynn Wheeler took over as head coach for ISU's second season of women's basketball (1974). Wheeler coached for six seasons and had winning records in three of those seasons. In Wheeler's second season, she led Iowa State to its first 20 win season. Lynn Wheeler resigned after finishing with 14 straight defeats, stating \"I've taken this team as far as I can.\"\nDeb Oing (1980–1984).\nIn 1981, Deb Oing became Iowa State’s third coach. Over four seasons she coached ISU to a 31–80 record and was coach in 1984 for ISU's only winless conference season (0–14). She coached Iowa State to the program’s first official Big Eight conference win, an 80–76 decision over Oklahoma in Ames on November 27, 1982. In 1982, Oing served with Team USA as an assistant.\nPam Wettig (1984–1992).\nPam Wettig became Iowa State's fourth head coach in 1985. Wettig coached for eight years and finished a 100–121 record. Wettig coached Iowa State to their first win in the Big Eight Conference tournament in 1990 (the Big Eight switched to a single-elimination event in 1983). Wettig was named Big Eight Coach of the Year for the 1985–1986 season.\nTheresa Becker (1992–1995).\nTheresa Becker became Iowa State’s fifth coach (1993–1995), finishing a disappointing 18–63 over three seasons. Iowa State never finished better than a tie for 7th place in the Big Eight under Becker.\nBill Fennelly (1995–Present).\nIn 1995 (one year before inception of the Big 12), Iowa State hired former University of Toledo head women's basketball coach, Bill Fennelly. When Fennelly arrived, Iowa State hadn't had a winning season in seven years and only five winning seasons ever. In his first season, Fennelly led the Cyclones to a 17–10 record. That is nearly as many wins as Fennelly's predecessor, Theresa Becker, had in her career (18) at ISU in the three previous years.\nFennelly came to Iowa State after building a successful program at Toledo (.758 overall winning percentage, three NCAA and three WNIT appearances). In nineteen seasons at Iowa State (1995–2014), Fennelly has continued that success, compiling a record of 410–184 overall and 177–118 in conference play.\nUnder Fennelly, Iowa State advanced to its first NCAA appearance (1997), won its first NCAA game (1998), and hosted five consecutive NCAA first and second-round games (1998–2002) when host sites were earned, not pre-determined. Fennelly was national runner-up for the Associated Press (AP) Coach of the Year and guided the Cyclones to their first national ranking, reaching #22 (both in 1998). Iowa State advanced to the Elite 8 in 1999 and again in 2009. The Cyclones have made it to the Sweet 16 six times (1999–2001, 2009, 2010, 2022). Stacy Frese became Iowa State’s first AP All-American (1999). Iowa State won the Big 12 regular season title (2000) and three Big 12 Conference tournament championships (2000–2001, 2023). Iowa State defeated its first #1 ranked team (Texas Tech, ESPN poll) and advanced to its first post-season Final Four in the WNIT (both 2004).\nChampionships.\nConference Tournament seeds.\nIn their history of appearances in the Big Eight/Twelve Conference tournaments, they have been seeded in the top five spots 16 times, with the most common seed being 8th, which they have been placed eight times.\nNCAA Tournament history.\nThe Cyclones have a 22–22 record in the NCAA Tournament.\nHilton Coliseum.\nThe Cyclones play at Hilton Coliseum, on the campus of Iowa State University, in Ames, Iowa. The Cyclones’ yearly attendance average has grown from 733 fans per game the season before Coach Fennelly came to ISU to over 10,000 per contest in 2011–2012. ISU’s attendance has ranked among the top 11 schools nationally in each of the last 17 seasons, including ranking fourth for three straight years from 1999 to 2002 and fourth or higher for seven straight years from 2007 to 2014. Iowa State was ranked 2nd in attendance in 2013 and 2014. The Cyclones enjoyed their first-ever sellout crowd in a 2004 WNIT/NIT doubleheader against Saint Joseph's. In 2009, Iowa State had a higher total attendance with over 156,000 than 16 of the 31 Division I conferences."

        "title": "Basketball in India",
        "text": "In India, basketball is a popular sport, with a multiple club league system, as well as men's and women's national teams. Indian basketball made significant improvements, most notably in 2015, making them one of the top emerging continental teams.\nHistory.\nBasketball was brought to India in 1893–4 by Canadian T. Duncan Patton, who later returned to India as the Acting General Secretary of the Calcutta YMCA from 1903 to 1905. The game was initially most popular among women, although slow to spread. The country's first match is recorded as 1930 by some sources, with the first Indian National Championship for men being held in 1934 in New Delhi. The Basketball Federation of India (BFI), which controls the game in India, was formed in 1950.\nBasketball in India as of today.\nBasketball is played in most Indian high schools, colleges and universities. There is considerable patronage for the game among the younger generation. It is played by both men and women of all ages and ability. Many government institutions have professional basketball teams who play for them. For example, ONGC in Uttarakhand, Indian Overseas Bank in Tamil Nadu, Indian Bank in Karnataka, Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited in New Delhi, Indian Railways, and Kerala State Electricity Board in Trivandrum play for their respective institution and state.\nThere are many championships for senior, junior, and youth levels for boys and girls. Invitational all-India tournaments like Master Prithvinath Memorial, Don Bosco Invitational Tournament, Kiloi Invitational Tournament, Ramu Memorial and many other are being organised every year. Indian basketball has championships throughout the year for different age groups. Championships for youth are mainly between April and July when children have their summer break from school.\nBasketball is especially popular among the Tibetan exile community in Dharamshala.\nBeing one of the earliest countries to adopt basketball, India has so far produced numerous talented basketballers who have earned recognition in the international arena. Indian players have also won several trophies for their country. Basketball in India is mainly being run and managed by a large number of national and state level associations, spread all over India. These basketball associations are working with a common view of popularising the game in all parts of the country. Apart from that, developing the overall infrastructure for the game and uncovering new talent from the grassroots level are some of the other principal objectives of the Indian basketball associations.\nIndia's first ever professional basketball league UBA was started in 2015. UBA completed four seasons in India.\nBasketball Federation of India.\nThe Basketball Federation of India was established in 1950 and is the official governing body of basketball in India. It follows FIBA rules for organising basketball championships and is affiliated to FIBA Asia and the Indian Olympic Association.\nLeague system.\nIndia created its first professional basketball league, titled Universal Basketball Alliance (UBA), in 2015. The first winner of the UBA was Chennai Slam. The tournament was folded in 2017 after it completed its fourth season and in 2022 the league was replaced with the EPBL and the developmental INBL.\nThe National Basketball Championship is national level basketball tournament for both men and women, organised by the Basketball Federation of India, contested among the regional state teams affiliated under the federation.\nInternational support and influence.\nNBA in India.\nThe National Basketball Association has realised the immense potential of the sport in this large and growing market, and is working hard with the Basketball Federation of India to expand its popularity.\n2008.\nLate in 2008, NBA great Robert Parish came to India as part of the NBA/WNBA Hoop School Program. This relationship further expanded into a cultural exchange, which saw Bollywood superstars Lara Dutta and Dino Morea make a trip to watch the Los Angeles Lakers in action, and on 8 April 2009, saw the NBA inaugurate a refurbished basketball court in a Mumbai suburb.\n2015.\nIn April 2015, Canadian Sim Bhullar made his professional debut in the NBA, becoming the first player of Indian descent in the league. Two months later, Satnam Singh Bhamara became the first Indian to ever be selected in the NBA by being the 52nd pick in the 2015 NBA draft for the Dallas Mavericks. He'd also been the first player to be drafted as a high school postgraduate since 2005.\n2017.\nIn April 2017, India on track (IOT) collaborated with NBA to form NBA Basketball Schools to train kids and teach them to play the NBA way. There are more than 12 centres running around the country from Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, and many more.\n2019.\nThe first ever NBA games in India took place on 4 and 5 October 2019 at the NSCI Dome in Mumbai. The NBA India Games featured two preseason games between the Sacramento Kings and Indiana Pacers, and marked the first time that teams from a North American sports league played in India.\nIMG Reliance joint venture.\nIn June 2010, a deal was struck with the Basketball Federation of India and the IMG-Reliance joint venture which aimed to take Indian basketball to a professional level. The 30-year deal sees IMG Reliance take control of the game launching a league, controlling merchandise, developing infrastructure and other commercial aspects in this new development. The BFI will launch and control school and college leagues with assistance from IMG. IMG Reliance will also construct academies in India in line with the IMG Florida sports academy. In July, coaches from Florida came to India to select 8 boys and girls between the ages of 13 and 15 to take to the US on a scholarship. The first batch was selected and is preparing to undertake the scholarship at IMG Florida. More scholarships will be offered with the aim of launching India's first professional league in four years. IMG chief Ted Fortsmann and Reliance owner Mukesh Ambani see the IPL as a perfect model to use.\nOne of the first people to have been accepted to the IMG Reliance program, Satnam Singh Bhamara, had also declared to go for the 2015 NBA draft while coming straight out of the IMG Reliance program as a post-graduate. When Bhamara was selected by the Dallas Mavericks as the 52nd pick of the draft, he would be the first player to have been drafted directly out of high school without any additional international, college, or D-League competition since Amir Johnson back in 2005.\nIndia Rising.\nFounded as best Indian diaspora basketball team, they participate at various international events, such as The Basketball Tournament."

        "text": "With the end of the Second World War's European theatre in early May, it was possible to organise eleven first-class cricket matches, the first to be played in England since 1939, though none were part of any official competition.\nAn Australian Services XI, which included Keith Miller, Lindsay Hassett and Cec Pepper, played five \"Victory Tests\" against England, plus a further game against Leveson-Gower's XI. England also played a Dominions team at Lord's. A New Zealand Services XI, including Martin Donnelly, played against Leveson-Gower's XI.\nYorkshire hosted Lancashire at Bradford Park Avenue in a memorial match for Hedley Verity, who was killed in action two years earlier. The other two matches were Yorkshire against a very useful Royal Air Force XI at North Marine Road; and over-33s against under-33s at Lord's.\nLeading players.\nLeading batsmen in the 1945 season were Len Hutton, who made 782 runs at 48.87 with a highest score (HS) of 188; Keith Miller, 725 @ 72.50 (HS 185); Cyril Washbrook, Bill Edrich, Wally Hammond, Cec Pepper, Martin Donnelly and Lindsay Hassett.\nThe most successful bowler was Dick Pollard who took 28 wickets at 24.25 with a best bowling analysis (BB) of 6–75. Other leading bowlers were Pepper, who took 27 @ 27.29 (BB 4–57); Reg Ellis, Doug Wright, Bob Cristofani and George Pope.\nDebutants.\nFirst-class debutants in 1945 included Trevor Bailey and three other future England Test players: Donald Carr, Alec Coxon and John Dewes.\nPlayers who made their final first-class appearances during the season included Herbert Sutcliffe, Learie Constantine and Jack Iddon. Iddon was killed in a motor accident shortly before the beginning of the 1946 season."

        "text": "The 1932 World Snooker Championship, known at the time as the Professional Championship of Snooker, was a professional snooker tournament that took place from 14 to 20 April 1932, with the final being held at Thurston's Hall in London, England. It is recognised as the sixth edition of the World Snooker Championship. The defending champion, Joe Davis from England, won the title for the sixth time by defeating New Zealander Clark McConachy by 30 to 19 in the final. The score when Davis achieved a winning margin was 25–18, with played afterwards. Davis set a new Championship record of 99 in the 36th frame of the final. McConachy had become the first player from outside the British Isles to enter the championship. The only other participant was Tom Dennis, who was defeated 11–13 by McConachy in the semi-final at Skegness.\nBackground.\nThe World Snooker Championship is a professional tournament and the official world championship of the game of snooker. The sport was developed in the late 19th century by British Army soldiers stationed in India. Professional English billiards player and billiard hall manager Joe Davis noticed the increasing popularity of snooker compared to billiards in the 1920s, and with Birmingham-based billiards equipment manager Bill Camkin, persuaded the Billiards Association and Control Council (BACC) to recognise an official professional snooker championship in the 1926–27 season. In 1927, the final of the first professional championship was held at Camkin's Hall; Davis won the tournament by beating Tom Dennis in the final. The annual competition was not titled the World Championship until 1935, but the 1927 tournament is now referred to as the first World Snooker Championship. Davis also won the title in 1928, 1929, 1930, and 1931, with Dennis runner-up in four of the first five years of the championship, the exception being 1928, when Fred Lawrence lost to Davis in the final.\nFor the 1932 championship, the preliminary heats and semi-finals were to be best of 25 , played over three days, with the final contested over 49 frames across six days. The entry fee was set at five guineas per player (), with a five guineas sidestake required for each match. Entry fees would be used to provide prize money for the finalists, with 60 per cent going to the champion, and gate receipts for each match would be divided equally, after expenses (including 5 per cent of the gross receipts for the BACC), between the two players concerned.\nSummary.\nBy the closing date of 29 February, only three players had entered for the competition: Joe Davis, Tom Dennis and Clark McConachy, who became the first player from outside the British Isles to enter the championship. Dennis and McConachy were drawn to play each other, with the winner meeting Davis in the final. On 26 March, Davis defeated McConachy 25,161–19,259 to retain the Professional Billiards title that he had held since 1928, with those two players being the only entrants.\nSemi-final\nMcConachy and Dennis played their match from 14 to 16 April at Dennis's Billiards Lounge in Skegness, over 25 frames. There were eight frames played each day with four frames in the afternoon and four in the evening (five on the final day). After Dennis had won the first two frames, both sessions on the first day ended level, leaving the score 4–4 overnight after a day that attracted only a small audience. The players were again level after the second day, Dennis winning three of the four frames in the afternoon and McConachy taking all but one of the evening's four frames. McConachy won three of the four frames on the final afternoon to lead 11–9. In frame 19, McConachy made a of 72 with 9 reds and 9 , winning the frame 92–32. In the evening session Dennis won two of the first three frames to trail 11–12. McConachy made an early break of 47 in the 24th frame and won the frame 93–36 to secure victory at 13–11. A review of the match in \"The Skegness Standard\" noted that \"only a mere handful of spectators was present at the majority of the six sessions\", attributing this to the admission charges of 4s 3d () and 2s 3d () being \"too high\"; the same article commented on the difference in the players' styles, describing McConachy as \"rapid and alert in all his movements\" and adding that \"he fairly ran around the table when a 'good thing' presented itself\" in contrast to Dennis's cool and unflustered approach.\nFinal\nThe final was played from 25 April to 30 April over 49 frames. There were eight frames played each day, with four frames in the afternoon and four in the evening (and five scheduled for the final afternoon). The match was held at Thurston's Hall, in Leicester Square, London. The first day ended 4–4 with both sessions level. McConachy had the highest break of the day with a 67 in the 8th frame, Davis making a 51 break in the 5th frame. Davis won both sessions 3–1 on the second day to lead 10–6, having made a 57 break in frame 14. On the third day, Davis again won both sessions 3–1 to extend his lead to 16–8, and compiled an 80 break in frame 19. McConachy won the first three frames on the fourth day but Davis took the next four and the day ended with Davis 20–12 ahead. On the fifth day Davis won three frames in the afternoon to lead 23–13, needing just 2 more frames for victory. In frame 36, Davis set another Championship record break. McConachy the first , but Davis then had a break of 99 including 12 reds. On 99 he snookered himself and, in attempting to hit a red with the , committed a by having the cue ball strike the instead. An article in \"The Times\" reporting on the session stated that \"On the evidence of the play, [Davis] is the greatest exponent of the game ever seen.\" McConachy won all four frames in the evening to reduce Davis's lead to 23–17, making a 51 break in frame 39. Davis won two of the first three frames in the final afternoon session to lead 25–18 and retain the Championship. The remaining six were played, the two in the afternoon were shared while Davis won all four in the evening. In his 1976 autobiography, Davis wrote that although being defeated by McConachy for the 1932 billiards title had felt like a serious possibility, \"snooker was not [McConachy's] strong point and, in the final ... I won comfortably.\" The championship trophy was presented by Henry Procter, the Member of Parliament for Accrington. Davis had extended his record of winning the championship every year since 1927, with this being his sixth world title.\nMain draw.\nMatch results are shown below.

Donaldson won the two dead frames which finished the evening session. In 1939, Donaldson recounted to an interviewer in \"The Billiard Player\" that \"[Davis] annihilated me. He wiped me right off the table\" and that \"I saw at once that there was far more in the game than I had ever dreamt of.\"\nThe final between Davis and Smith was originally planned for 6 days with 8 frames per day (9 on the final day). Davis won all four afternoon frames on the first day but Smith took three of the four frames played in the evening, to leave Davis 5–3 ahead.

Walter Lindrum won a close match 23,553–22,678.\nDavis had been due to leave Australia on 30 October but accepted an offer of a snooker match against Horace Lindrum, delaying his departure until 7 November. An 81- snooker match was arranged to be played at the Tivoli Billiard Theatre, Bourke Street, Melbourne from 29 October to 6 November with two of five frames played each day. Davis insisted on using the same table that had been used for the World Billiards Championship final. The match was reported in both \"The Age\" and \"The Glasgow Herald\" as being the unofficial world championship.\nLindrum won the first two frames of the match, but Davis led 6–4 at the end of the first day. Davis made a of 56 in the fifth frame. Davis extended his lead to 12–8 on the second day and then won eight frames on the third day to lead 20–10. Davis made breaks of 56 and 54 on the third day. Davis extended his lead to 27–13 on the fourth day but Lindrum won 6 frames on the fifth day to leave Davis 31–19 ahead. On the Saturday, the sixth day, Davis won 8 frames to lead 39–21, including a 50 break. Davis won frames 1 and 3 on the Monday afternoon to take a winning 41–22 lead. With the result decided the match became more open and Lindrum had breaks of 54 and 80, the highest of the match. The final Tuesday afternoon session was abandoned, because it clashed with the Melbourne Cup. After a final evening session of 5 frames Davis finished 46–29 ahead.\nIn late November, Fred Lindrum, Horace Lindrum's uncle, criticised Davis for demanding a £100 side-bet and for insisting on the use of the match table that had been used for the World Billiards Championship final against Walter Lindrum. Horace had just successfully challenged Fred for the Australian Professional Billiards Championship. In 1974, Horace Lindrum wrote that although the money that he lost was approximately equivalent to his fare to England and this had deprived him of the opportunity to enter the following professional championship, the contest provided \"match experience against a top class overseas player. It was experience I urgently needed.\"\nSummary.\nThere were five entrants to the 1935 World Snooker Championship: defending champion Joe Davis, Willie Smith, Alec Mann, Tom Newman, and Conrad Stanbury, who became the first ever Canadian to enter the championship. Davis and Newman had been the only entrants in 1934. All of the matches in the 1935 tournament took place at Thurston's Hall, whereas in previous years players had been required to arrange venues for some matches themselves. The final was to be 49 frames played over five days, with the other matches all being 25 frames played over three days each. Stanbury was drawn to play Smith, with the winner meeting Mann in one semi-final, and Davis was drawn to play Newman in the other semi-final. On 6 April, Davis retained the UK Professional English Billiards Championship, by completing a 21,733–19,910 defeat of Newman at Thurston's.\nFirst round.\nWillie Smith and Conrad Stanbury played their first-round match from 8 to 10 April. The players and referee agreed in advance that, contrary to the official rules of the game, they would a being played for only if there might be some doubt, rather than in every case. Stanbury took a 2–0 lead, and Smith won the other frames played in the afternoon to equalise. in the evening, Smith moved into a 4–2 lead, and the day ended with the layers at 4–4. Stanbury won five of the eight frames on the second day to lead 9–7. Smith won three frames in the final afternoon session to level the match at 10–10. Stanbury took a 12–11 lead but Smith won the last two frames to win the match, after Stanbury missed a straightforward attempt to the in the .\nSemi-finals.\nIn the first semi-final, played from 11 to 13 April, Smith faced Alec Mann. Smith won all eight frames on the first day, and compiled a 74 break in frame 5. Mann took the first three frames on the second day, but the score at the end of the day was 12–4 to Smith, leaving him just one frame from victory. Smith took the first frame on the third day 50–44 to win the match 13–4. The remaining were played, with the eventual score being 18–7 to Smith.\nJoe Davis and Tom Newman met in the second semi-final, from 15 to 17 April. Newman won the first frame but at the end of the first day Davis led 5–3, extending his lead to 7–5 after the second morning session, and 10–6 after two days. On the final day Davis won the first three frames to win the match 13–6. In frame 24, a \"dead\" frame, Davis made a break of 110 winning the frame 135–0. Davis eventually finished 15–10 ahead. The 110 was the first century break in the history of the tournament.\nFinal.\nThe final between Davis and Smith was held from 22 to 27 April. Davis won the first four frames, but the evening session was tied to leave the score at 6–2. Smith then reduced the gap after the second day, which ended with Davis leading 9–7. Davis led 14–10 at the half-way stage with the score at 18–14 after day 4, and 22–18 after day 5. After the final afternoon session the score was 24–20 and the match ended on the first evening frame which Davis won by 58 to 39, securing victory at 25–20. The remaining frames were played out with Davis eventually winning 28–21. Davis scored the highest break of the final, a 92 break in frame 38, with 12 , 8 and 4 pinks. It was Davis's ninth consecutive title victory in the championship.\nAftermath.\nSnooker historian Clive Everton later claimed that the championship record break of 110 made the tournament more financially viable, saying that it \"established the [world snooker championship] as a paying proposition.\" In his column for \"Reynolds's Illustrated News\", published the day after the conclusion of the final, Smith wrote that snooker was \"gradually ousting billiards in the clubs and public halls\", saying that he regretted this, as he preferred billiards because it was harder to master. He noted that \"the public seems to like snooker best at the professional games\" and that for the final against Davis, \"the hall has been packed – the first time it has happened in the history of the Professional Snooker Championship.\" \"The Billiard Player\" similarly reported that \"For the first time in its history this contest drew large and continuous crowds to Thurstons.\" Previously, snooker had featured at Thurston's only for the championship itself or alongside headlining billiards matches, but the following season included the first week-long snooker matches at the venue.\nMain draw.\nMatch results are shown below.

        "text": "The 1936 World Snooker Championship was a snooker tournament that was held at the Burroughes and Thurston's Halls in London, England from 23 March to 2 May 1936. There were 13 entries; a significant increase from five in the previous year and just two in 1934. Defending champion Joe Davis won the Championship for the tenth consecutive time, defeating Horace Lindrum in the final 34–27. Horace Lindrum became the first Australian to compete at the World Championship and made the only century break of the tournament, a 101 in his semi-final match against Stanley Newman.\nOverview.\nThe World Snooker Championship was created in 1927 by Joe Davis and the Billiards Association and Control Council (BA&amp;CC). The defending champion of the event was Davis, who had won the 1935 event by defeating Willie Smith 28–21 in the final. The championship was contested over several weeks in two locations, at the Thurston's Hall and Burroughes Hall in London, England. The final was played between 27 April and 2 May 1936 at Thurston's Hall. The event had 13 participants, with three players receiving a bye to the second round. Tom Dennis, who had received a bye, later withdrew. His scheduled opponent Stanley Newman's first game was in the semi-finals. Matches were played as the best-of-31 until the final, which was played as the best-of-61 frames. \"Dead frames\", after a player has already won the match were also played.\nSchedule.\nBelow was the schedule for the event.\nSummary.\nThe Championship started on 23 March, following the 1935/1936 Daily Mail Gold Cup English billiards tournament two days earlier which has fully occupied Thurston's Hall since the beginning of the year. Sessions were extended to five frames, compared to the four frames that had been played in 1935. The first match was between Clare O'Donnell and Sydney Lee. O'Donnell led 6–4 after the first day and 11–9 after two days. Lee won the last two frames on the final afternoon to reduce O'Donnell's lead to 13–12 and then won the first three in the evening to lead 15–13 before O'Donnell won the last three frames to win the match 16–15.\nHorace Lindrum met Bert Terry in the second match.

O'Donnell won frame 21 but Lindrum won the match in the next frame, winning 16–6. The afternoon session ended with Lindrum 19–6 ahead.

        "text": "The 1937 World Snooker Championship was a snooker tournament held at Thurston's Hall in London, England from 22 February to 20 March 1937. It is recognised as the 11th edition of the World Snooker Championship. There were nine participants in the event, with debutants Fred Davis (brother of defending champion Joe Davis) and Bill Withers competing in a qualifying match. Withers won the match to join with the remaining seven players in the main event.\nJoe Davis won his 11th championship title by defeating Horace Lindrum by 32 to 29 in the final, despite trailing 13–17 and 19–21 during the match. The highest of the tournament was 103, compiled by Joe Davis in the 31st frame of the final.\nBackground.\nThe World Snooker Championship is a professional tournament and the official world championship of the game of snooker. The sport was developed in the late 19th century by British Army soldiers stationed in India. Professional English billiards player and billiard hall manager Joe Davis noticed the increasing popularity of snooker compared to billiards in the 1920s, and with Birmingham-based billiards equipment manager Bill Camkin, persuaded the Billiards Association and Control Council (BACC) to recognise an official professional snooker championship in the 1926–27 season. In 1927, the final of the first professional snooker championship was held at Camkin's Hall; Davis won the tournament by beating Tom Dennis in the final. The annual competition was not titled the World Championship until the 1935 tournament, but the 1927 tournament is now referred to as the first World Snooker Championship. Davis had also won the title every year from 1928 to 1936.\nSummary.\nThe BACC introduced a qualifying competition for the first time. If necessary, they would select players from the entrants to play in the qualifying event, the winner to advance to the competition proper. With nine entries, Bill Withers and Fred Davis were chosen to play a qualifying match, the winner to join the main event. The Championship proper was played at Thurston's Hall over a four-week period from 22 February and 20 March. All matches were played over 31 frames, except the final, which was played over 61 frames.\nFirst round.\nThe first match of the competition proper took place from 22 to 24 February and was between Horace Lindrum and Sydney Lee. Lee won the first , but Lindrum took an 8–2 lead after the first day by winning both the afternoon and evening 4–1. This was extended to 15–5 after two days, just one frame from victory, as he won three of the five afternoon frames and all but one of the five evening frames. Lindrum took the first frame on the final day to win the match 16–5. The final score was 20–11.\nThe second match of the first week was played by Willie Smith and Tom Newman from 25 to 27 February. Smith took a 4–1 lead from the afternoon session, but Newman was level at 5–5 after the evening's play. Newman took an 11–9 lead on the second day. On the final day Newman led 14–13 before claimed the next two frames to lead 15–14. Newman made a 57 in the next frame to level the match. Smith won the last frame 85–23 to secure victory.\nSidney Smith faced Alec Brown in the first match of the second week, staged from 1 to 3 March. Smith won the last frame of the afternoon session to take a 3–2 lead into the evening, and added the sixth frame. Brown won frame seven on a , and took the following two frames for a 5–4 lead, before Smith levelled the match at 5–5 after compiling a break of 55. Smith had the best of both sessions on the second day, winning four of the five frames in each, for a 13–7 lead. The correspondent for \"The Times\" felt that Smith's play had been excellent, whilst Brown's was not up to his usual standard. Brown won three of the afternoon frames on the final day but still needed to win all six frames in the evening to win the match. Brown took the first evening frame, but Smith won the second by 87–29 to win the match 16–11. The final score was 18–13.\nFrom 4 to 6 March, Joe Davis met Withers in the last quarter-final. Davis won the first frame, and, after trailing 0–35 in in the second frame, produced a break of 59 and went on to take the frame. Withers made a 47 break in the third frame and was leading by 36 points with just the colours (worth 27 points) left but, by gaining 16 points in , Davis managed to level the score with just the left. Withers, however, the black to win the frame. Davis led 9–1 at the end of the first day, after breaks of 77 in the eighth frame and 64 in the tenth frame. Davis added the five frames from the second morning session, and, with an 84 break, the first frame of the second evening. He claimed victory at 16–1 by taking the following frame. He also won the remaining 14 to finish at 30–1, having taken 28 frames in succession. Davis made breaks of 97 and 99 on the final afternoon. The five official afternoon frames having been completed quickly, the players played an exhibition frame during which Davis made a new record break of 135, beating the 133 scored by Sidney Smith during the 1936 Daily Mail Gold Cup earlier in the season. Davis's break was a total clearance during which he took the 15 , 8 blacks, 4 , a , 2 and all the colours.\nSemi-finals.\nLindrum played Willie Smith in the first semi-final, from 8 to 10 March. Lindrum led 6–4 after the first day, and extended his lead to 14–6 after two days. In the 17th frame, Smith potted the final black, but then touched the before it had stopped moving, and was called for a foul that lost him the frame. Although Smith won the first two frames on the final day, Lindrum won the next frame to lead 15–8. In the following frame, Smith led 57–9 but Lindrum made a 50 clearance to win the frame 59–57 and the match 16–8. Lindrum finished the match 20–11 ahead.\nIn the second semi-final, played from 11 to 13 March, Joe Davis trailed 2–3 after the first session, but led 6–4 against Sidney Smith after the first day. Smith had the best of the second day to level the match at 10–10. Davis took a narrow lead after the final afternoon session, taking the last frame to lead 13–12. In the evening Davis won the first three frames to secure the match 16–12, the final score being 18–13 after dead frames.\nFinal.\nThe final between Joe Davis and Lindrum, from 15 to 20 March, was a repeat of the previous year's final. The 1937 referee was Charles Chambers. Davis recorded breaks of 38 and 50 in winning the first frame, and a 53 when taking the third frame to lead 2–1. Lindrum compiled an 81 break in the next frame to level the match, before Davis claimed the fifth frame for a 3–2 lead after the first session. In the evening, Lindrum equalised at 5–5, having registered a 75 break in frame eight. On the second day, Lindrum won the eleventh frame after clearing the colours and then potting the re-spotted black, and finished the afternoon session 11–9 up. He extended this to 17–13 at the half-way stage, making an 80 break in the 21st frame. The fourth day started with a break of 103, which was the highest of the tournament, by Davis in frame 31. Davis fouled on his first visit to the table and, after a break of 29 by Lindrum, Davis cleared the table on his second visit. Two frames later, he constructed a break of 93, and by the end of the day, had reduced his deficit to 19–21. He then won eight of ten frames on the fifth day to lead 27–23. After the final afternoon session Davis still led 29–26, with Lindrum needing to win five of the six evening frames. Lindrum won the first two frames, but Davis claimed the following two frames to win the match at 31–28. The last two frames were shared to give a final result of 32–29.\nLindrum later wrote that \"years later I am still pondering the loss of that 1937 crown.\" He felt that he was in good form during the match, and reflected that \"It didn't seem possible but when play began at night, frame after frame slipped slowly from my grasp.\" \"Billiards and Snooker\" magazine's commentary on the tournament stated that the standard of play was higher than in any of the preceding championships. Praising Joe Davis, the article suggested that \"It may be doubted if any game was so completely, so perfectly interpreted as is snooker by Davis.\"\nMain draw.\nThe results for the tournament are shown below. Match winners are denoted in bold.\nQualifying.\nWithers and Fred Davis played at Thurston's Hall from 7 to 9 January. It was the championship debut for both players. Joe Davis was playing Tom Newman in a 71-frame handicap match on the same days which meant that the Withers and Fred Davis match was played earlier in the day than usual with two sessions at 11:30 am and 5:15 pm. Withers took a decisive 16–13 lead on the final evening, and the match ended with him 17–14 ahead.\nCentury breaks.\nThe 103 break by Horace Lindrum was the first century break in the final of the World Snooker Championship."

Horace Lindrum, the runner-up in 1936 and 1937 did not participate, due to his disagreement with Billiards Association and Control Council the over the competition terms, including about the type of that would be used on the playing tables.\nBackground.\nThe World Snooker Championship is a professional tournament and the official world championship of the game of snooker. The sport was developed in the late 19th century by British Army soldiers stationed in India.

The annual competition was not titled the World Championship until the 1935 tournament, but the 1927 tournament is now referred to as the first World Snooker Championship. Davis had also won the title every year from 1928 to 1937.\nThere were ten entrants. Horace Lindrum, the losing finalist in 1936 and 1937, did not enter for 1938, because he objected to certain conditions, particularly to the used. Fred Davis, Herbert Holt and Charles Read were chosen to play in a qualifying event, the winner to join the other seven players in the main event.

The main event was held from 14 March to 22 April at Thurston's Hall, with the final over 61 and all other matches over 31 frames. The entry fees of 5 guineas per player were to be used as prize money for the finalists, with the winner receiving 60%.\nSummary.\nFirst round.\nThe first match in the competition proper was held from 14 to 16 March, with defending champion Joe Davis playing Sydney Lee.

The score was level at 5–5 after the first day and 10–10 after two days. Smith led 13–12 after the final afternoon and, winning three of the first four evening frames, took the match 16–13.

Smith took four of the five frames in the fifth session, leaving him one frame behind at 12–13, and levelled the match by winning the first frame of the sixth session, but Davis again led over-night with the score at 16–14.

Smith won the first three frames on the final day but Davis had a 98 clearance in frame 54 to ensure victory at 31–23. Smith won the next before Davis won the six evening frames to finish 37–24 ahead.\nIt was Davis's twelfth consecutive world snooker championship title. The author of the report in \"The Times\" following his victory suggested that Smith had established that he was the third-best player, behind Davis and Lindrum, but that based on the final, \"there was no question regarding the superiority of the holder of the championship.\" Davis and Lindrum arranged a match over 133 frames, starting on 11 April, to be played at Thurston's. The match was handicapped, with Davis, conceding 10 points each frame to Lindrum. Davis won that series 71–62, after Lindrum had been only two frames behind when the score was 61–59.\nMain draw.\nMatch results are shown below. Winning players and scores are denoted in bold text.\nQualifying.\nThe two matches were played at Thurston's Hall immediately before the competition proper. Two players described as \"unknowns\" by Willie Smith played in the first match from 7 to 9 March; Herbert Holt from Blackpool and Charles Read from Salisbury. Read took an early 4–1 lead but Holt dominated thereafter, winning 16–10, the final score being 21–10. From 10 to 12 March, Holt then played Fred Davis to determine the winner of the qualifying event. Davis proved too strong for Holt, leading 9–1 after the first day and taking a winning 16–2 lead on the second day. The final score was 23–8."

        "title": "1939 World Snooker Championship",
        "text": "The 1939 World Snooker Championship was a snooker tournament held at Thurston's Hall in London, England from 23 January to 4 March 1939. It was the thirteenth edition of the World Snooker Championship. Joe Davis retained the championship title that he had held since 1927. In the best-of-73- final against Sidney Smith, Davis won the match 43–30, securing the victory at 37-25 earlier in the match. Fred Davis set a new championship highest by compiling a 113 in the 22nd frame of his 14–17 semi-final defeat by his brother Joe Davis.\nThere were fifteen participants, with four players taking part in a qualifying competition for a place in the twelve-person main event. Walter Donaldson, who entered the championship for the first time since his debut in 1933, won the qualifying event, and eliminated Claude Falkiner, a tournament debutant who was taking part in his first cue sports tournament for several years, in the first round of the main draw, before losing in the quarter-finals to Sidney Smith.\nBackground.\nThe World Snooker Championship is a professional tournament and the official world championship of the game of snooker. The sport was developed in the late 19th century by British Army soldiers stationed in India. Professional English billiards player and billiard hall manager Joe Davis noticed the increasing popularity of snooker compared to billiards in the 1920s, and with Birmingham-based billiards equipment manager Bill Camkin, persuaded the Billiards Association and Control Council (BACC) to recognise an official professional snooker championship in the 1926–27 season. In 1927, the final of the first professional snooker championship was held at Camkin's Hall; Davis won the tournament by beating Tom Dennis in the final. The annual competition was not titled the World Championship until the 1935 tournament, but the 1927 tournament is now referred to as the first World Snooker Championship. Davis had also won the title every year from 1928 to 1938.\nFor the 1939 Championship, the BACC announced a closing date for entries of 31 October 1938, and that the main competition would be played at Thurston's Hall. Players would be responsible for organising the qualifying matches themselves, with the first-drawn player drawn for the match being preferred to make the arrangements. All matches except the final were to be played over 31 , with the final consisting of 73 frames.\nThere were 15 entries for the Championship. The number of players places in the competition proper was increased from 8 to 12, with four selected players competing in the qualifying competition. The main event was held over a six-week period from 23 January to 4 March at Thurston's Hall. Qualifying matches had to be completed by 14 January. On 21 January, the 1938/1939 Daily Mail Gold Cup, which was won by Alec Brown, concluded. A preview of the World Championship in \"The Times\" suggested that despite the improvement in the standard of play of younger competitor such as Brown and Sidney Smith, Davis was likely to retain the title he had held since the tournament's inception in 1927.\nSummary.\nFirst round.\nThe first match was between Sidney Smith and Sydney Lee from 23 to 25 January. Smith had a 4–1 lead after the first , and 6–4 at the end of the first day. The next day, Smith claimed four of the five frames in the afternoon session so was 10–5 ahead. After the fourth session, his advantage was 13–7 and, by winning the first three frames on the final day, he achieved decisive 16–7 lead. The final score after was 21–10.\nFrom 26 to 28 January, qualifier Walter Donaldson played Claude Falkiner. Falkiner took three of the five frames in the first session, and Donaldson won three frames from five in the evening, leaving the score was level at 5–5 after the first day. Donaldson won four of the five frames in both of the sessions on the second day to lead 13–7. On the final day Donaldson took a 16–8 winning lead and ended 21–10 ahead. Falkiner had been had been runner-up in the professional billiards championship in 1920 and 1922. Playing Donaldson was his first competitive cue sports match in several years, and his first participation in the World Snooker Championship. The correspondent for \"The Times\", whilst describing Donaldson as \"a player of considerable skill\", felt that Falkiner's lack of recent match experience contributed to his defeat.\nThe second week started with a match between Tom Newman and Alec Mann, which was held from 30 January to 1 February. Newman led 4–1 following the initial session, and 6–4 after the first day, and increased his lead 13–7 after two days. Newman compiled a 71 in the opening frame of the final day before a ruined his chance of a century break. Newman gained a winning 16–10 lead by taking the first frame of the evening session and finished 19–12 ahead.\nFred Davis and Conrad Stanbury met in the last first round match, which started on 2 February. Davis won the first six frames and led 13–7 at the start of the final day, 4 February. Davis took a winning 16–9 lead and eventually won 19–12 after dead frames.\nQuarter-finals.\nDaily Mail Gold Cup winner Alec Brown met Horace Lindrum in the first quarter-final, from 6 to 8 February. He had beaten Lindrum 46–25 in the Gold Cup tournament, but had received a 21-point start in each frame. Brown took a 6–4 lead, winning each of the first two sessions 3–2. On the second day, Brown compiled a break of 83, his highest-ever in competitive play, in the 13th frame. He led 10–5 at the close of the session, and 13–7 at the end of the day. Brown added the last frame on the final afternoon to secure a win at 16–9. Lindrum won five of the evening frames to give a final score of 17–14.\nFrom 9 to 11 February, Sidney Smith played Donaldson in the second quarter-final. By taking three frames in each of the first two sessions, Smith established a 6–4 lead, extending this to 9–6 after winning the third session, again by a single frame. In the fourth session, Donaldson then won three frames in a row to equalise at 9–9, and added a fourth successive frame to lead 10–9. Smith took the last frame of the session and the second day concluded with the pair level at 10–10. Donaldson led 13–12, after the fifth session. In the concluding session, after Smith won the 26th frame to draw level, Donaldson moved a frame ahead again at 14–13. Smith made a 77 break in the 28th frame to make it 14–14, then added the next frame. Donaldson equalised at 15–15. In the , Smith led 43–34 with one left and, taking the red and then a and the to the , won the frame 69–34 and the match 16–15.\nThe next match was between Fred Davis and Newman, and was played from 13 to 15 February. Davis had won the first six frames in his opening match and on this occasion he won the first seven frames. From 8–2 up after the first two sessions, Davis won the first six frames on the second day to lead 14–2 then led 15–5 overnight, just one frame from victory. Davis won the second frame on the final day to secure victory at 16–6. The final score was 21–10 after dead frames. A match report in \"The Times\" referred to Davis as \"a sound and steady rather than a brilliant player\".\nJoe Davis played his first match of the 1939 Championship in the last quarter-final, against Willie Smith, from 16 to 18 February. Davis took a 6–4 lead on the first day after taking three frames from five in both sessions. Smith then won the first four frames of the second day to lead 8–6, but Davis claimed the final six frames for a 12–8 overnight advantage and, by winning the first four frames of the final day, secured a decisive 16–8 lead. During the dead frames, Davis extended his run to 11 frames before Smith won four of the six evening frames to give a final score of 19–12.\nSemi-finals.\nThe first semi-final was between Sidney Smith and Brown, from 20 to 22 February. Brown took a 5–1 lead and led 6–4 overnight. Smith then won the first seven frames on the second day to take an 11–6 lead; the second day ended with the score at 12–8. Smith continued to dominate on the final day winning the match 16–9 by winning the last frame of the afternoon session. The final score was 20–11.\nFrom 23 to 25 February, brothers Joe and Fred Davis played each other in the second semi-final. Fred won the first three frames, and led 3–2 after the first session, but Joe led 6–4 overnight. Fred regained the lead on the second afternoon but Joe took four of the evening frames and finished the day 11–9 ahead. Joe won the first frame on the second day but Fred then made a 113 clearance in the 22nd frame. Fred's break, a new record for the World Championship, included 12 reds, 6 , 3 pinks, 2 blues, a and then all the colours. Fred won the next frame but Joe then took the following four frames and achieved victory at 16–11. The final score after dead frame was 17–14.\nFinal.\nJoe Davis met Sidney Smith in the final for the second successive year. The final took place from 27 February to 4 March, and was extended from the 61 frames in the previous championship to 73 frames, 6 frames being played per session. Davis won the first five frames and ended the day 8–4 ahead. He extended the lead to 15–9 and 20–10 before Smith won all six frames on the third evening to reduce Davis's lead to 20–16. The fourth afternoon session was shared but Davis won five frames in the evening to lead 28–20. Davis made breaks of 73, 64, 69 and 95 in the first seven frames on the fifth day, and ended the day 35–25 ahead, two frames from victory. Davis took the first two frames on the final day to win the match 37–25. The remaining 11 frames were played leaving a final score of 43–30. Davis was presented with the championship trophy by author Compton Mackenzie.\nIt was the thirteenth consecutive world championship won by Davis, a feat that the Birmingham Post's correspondent wrote \"proved again .. that he has no equal as a snooker player\". Snooker historian Clive Everton called Davis's semi-final win over his brother \"the strongest challenge [Joe Davis] had yet encountered\" in the history of the tournament\".\nMain draw.\nMatch results are shown below. Winning players and scores are denoted in bold text.\nQualifying.\nWalter Donaldson, who had last entered the tournament on his debut in 1933 World Snooker Championship, met Herbert Holt in the first qualifying match at the Lion Hotel, Blackpool from 8–10 December 1938. Holt led 11–9 after two days but only won two frames on the final day, Donaldson taking a winning 16–13 lead and finishing 18–13 ahead. the match between Dickie Laws and Stanley Newman was played at Thurston's Hall.

        "text": "Combined Oxford and Cambridge Universities cricket teams were formed at intervals between 1839 and 1992, often playing against touring teams. Mostly the team consisted of students who were current members of either Cambridge University Cricket Club or Oxford University Cricket Club but there were four matches from 1874 to 1893 in which the Universities team was a Past and Present combination. The combined teams always held first-class status, unofficially at first and then officially from 1895.\n19th century.\nThe combined team's first match was against Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's in 1839, in which Edward Sayres took his only ten-wicket match haul, and in 1848 they played a game against Gentlemen of England at the same venue, in which William Hammersley took ten wickets.\n20th century.\nThe team later undertook overseas tours in the middle part of the twentieth century, but played only two first-class games outside Britain, both being at Sabina Park, during the tour of Jamaica in 1938. Kenneth Weekes made his first-class debut for Jamaica in the first of these, scoring 106 in the second innings.\nAfter a thirty-year gap, the Oxford and Cambridge team returned to first-class cricket in 1968, with a match against the touring Australians, and for a quarter of a century thereafter the team had fairly regular matches against touring teams at either the University Parks in Oxford or Fenner's in Cambridge, but playing no other first-class games. The team's last match was in 1992, when they played the Pakistanis.\nThere was a similar combined team known as British Universities which played in the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup, a limited overs competition, between 1975 and 1998. At first, this team was sometimes called Oxford and Cambridge Universities, or Oxbridge, but it was not first-class."

        "text": "William Wilkinson (born April 22, 1947) is a retired Canadian ice hockey coach. He coached the Wayne State Warriors men's ice hockey program for its entire 9-year existence at the Division I level. Prior to that, Wilkinson coach the Western Michigan for seventeen seasons.\nCareer.\nWilkinson played for St. Lawrence for three years, leading the team in scoring as a sophomore and serving as the team captain in his senior season. After graduating in 1970 Wilkinson taught high school for a year before returning to Canton as an assistant coach for his alma mater.\nWilkinson served as an assistant for St. Lawrence for seven years, leaving to accept a similar position at North Dakota for one season. He spent a further three seasons as an assistant at Bowling Green under Jerry York before getting his first head coaching job at Western Michigan. After a poor showing in his first year the Broncos produced their first 20+ win season at the D-I level, earning Wilkinson the CCHA Coach of the Year. Two years later Wilkinson got the Broncos to surprising 32-win season, the program's only 30-win season (as of 2018), won the CCHA Tournament and reached the NCAA tournament for the first time. The team declined to a mediocre level for much of the next seven years before finally returning to the NCAA tournament in 1994. The Broncos made another trip to the playoffs two years later but remained winless in NCAA postseason play under Wilkinson.\nDuring the 1998–99 season two of Wilkinson's players were arrested at a team party in a building that Wilkinson owned. An internal investigation was started and the entire team was subsequently suspended for violations of NCAA regulations. Wilkinson was eventually fired as head coach on February 3 but allowed to remain at the university as a special assistant to the AD. Once the season was over Wilkinson formally left and later took over as head coach for the newly-created program at Wayne State. The Warriors played as an independent for one season before joining the CHA. Wayne State produced a modest record their first season in conference but won both of their games in the CHA Tournament to earn Wilkinson his second conference championship. The Warriors followed that up by winning 20 games the next year, winning the CHA regular season title and claiming their second consecutive championship. With all of that team success Wilkinson was awarded with the CHA Coach of the Year. In 2003, with the NCAA tournament expanding to 16 teams, the CHA was to receive its first automatic bid and the two-time champions didn't disappoint, winning 20 games once more and claiming their third consecutive tournament championship. In the tournament Wayne State was set against the #2 overall seed Colorado College and, despite a valiant effort, could not overcome three power play goals from the Tigers.\nAfter their three year run the Warriors declined sharply and never produced another winning record. In 2007 the university announced it was shuttering the men's team, citing a $500K annual operating cost coupled with no on-campus rink and a troubled economy.\nWilkinson continued to coach after Wayne State shut down, spending three seasons with CH Jaca and then a six-month stint with the Melbourne Mustangs before retiring."

He later joined the Taranaki Mountainairs for the 2011 New Zealand NBL season. For the 2011–12 season, he played in Iran for Shiraz a.s Pipe.\nFor the 2012–13 season, Campbell moved to Qatar to play for Al Rayan. However, in November 2012, he attempted to board a plane in Qatar and was denied exit from the country. Campbell was trying to get to his new job in Cyprus after his Qatari team failed to honor his contract. Campbell's agent, Bill McCandless, said \"[Campbell] plays for a team for 50 days, makes next to nothing, gets evicted and tries to take a plane to a new job in a new country and he can't get out?\". To leave the country, Campbell was forced to sign a $20,000 settlement, despite requesting the team to pay him a $25,000 severance penalty after Al Rayan paid him just $1,430 for his 50 days with the team out of the $10,000-per-month salary he had signed for.\nCampbell finished his career in October 2013 after a six-game stint in Uruguay with Club Atlético Bohemios."

Hammons Arena in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\nChampionship game.\nOn March 8, Oakland clinched their first-ever bid to the NCAA tournament – it was their eighth year in Division I – by dispatching league favorite Oral Roberts in their conference tournament final. The final score was 61–60. Pierre Dukes was the hero, hitting a 3-pointer with 1.3 seconds left. It was his only shot of the second half. Afterwards, Ken Tutt's desperation shot at the buzzer banked high off the rim and Oakland celebrated. After the game, Dukes said, \"When I got it, I looked at the clock and there wasn't enough time to get it back to him, so I figured I'd let it fly.\" He was referring to Rawle Marshall who passed it to him for the winning shot. Dukes was shooting 35 percent from 3-point range and almost didn't even make the team.\nCortney Scott had 19 points for Oakland, while Marshall scored 18. Caleb Green had 13 points for the Oral Roberts Golden Eagles in the loss, while Tutt added 12. While the Golden Eagles did lead at half time, 28–27, the Golden Grizzlies went on a 17–6 run to begin the second half, and Oral Roberts had to claw their way back to have the lead in the closing seconds.\nThe Golden Grizzlies started the season with seven consecutive losses and had the fourth-hardest non-conference strength of schedule at the end of the season. At 12–18, they had the worst record of any qualifier to the NCAA tournament. They won the play-in game against Alabama A&amp;M, then lost to North Carolina in the first round."

        "text": "In 1982, the first Division I NCAA women's basketball tournament was held. The NCAA was able to offer incentives, such as payment of transportation costs, to participating members, something the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women was not able to do. When former AIAW powerhouses like Tennessee, Louisiana Tech, and Old Dominion decided to participate in the NCAA tournament, the AIAW tournament lost much of its appeal and popularity.\nNBC canceled its TV contract with the association, and in mid-1982 the AIAW stopped operations in all sports. Following the last AIAW sanctioned event in 1982, the AIAW pursued a federal antitrust suit against the NCAA. But one year later, after the presiding judge ruled against the organization, the AIAW ceased existence on June 30, 1983.\nUnder NCAA governance, scholarships increased. However, several problems the NCAA was facing, then and now, began to also affect women's intercollegiate athletics. Examples of these include recruiting irregularities and increased turnover in coaching positions for revenue-producing sports.\nSeveral AIAW championships were televised by the TVS Television Network in 1979."

While working in the Cardiff area he began playing rugby for Cardiff Rugby Club. In 1883 Clare was selected to represent his adopted country when he played for Wales in the opening game of the 1883 Home Nations Championship against England. This was only the third international game Wales had played and was the first ever game of the inaugural Six Nations Championship. Under the captaincy of Charles Lewis, Clare played three-quarters along with David Gwynn and Cardiff team-mate William Norton. Wales lost the game by two goals and four tries to nil, and Clare was not reselected to represent Wales again.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

        "title": "Heriot's Cricket Club",
        "text": "Heriot's Cricket Club is a cricket club based in Edinburgh, Scotland.\nHistory.\nGeorge Heriot's School Former Pupils Cricket Club, now known as Heriot's Cricket Club, was founded at a meeting held in Edinburgh's George Heriot's School on 5 December 1889. The foundation took some months before that of the Former Pupils Rugby Club in October 1890, Heriot's Rugby Club so the Cricket Club is the senior Heriots Former Pupils Club. Its first home was the almost as-new Logie Green (also known as Puddocky thanks to a local population of frogs), the school sports ground in the Warriston district of Edinburgh. The move to the present ground at Goldenacre, Goldenacre less than half a mile away, was completed in 1902. The ground's red-brick pavilion, which still dominates the main square as well as commanding views of Edinburgh, also dates back to that time. The very first delivery at Goldenacre, by William White of Heriot's, produced a simple caught-and-bowled chance, promptly grassed – not the last easy catch to be dropped at the ground.\nGroundsman as a 'professional'.\nThe club has always had at least two regular elevens, and often three or four, as well as a continuing link with Heriot's School and its teams through junior sides. However, some of its earliest members were not Herioters, including its first Scottish cap, batsman John Mushet (who played once, against Australia in 1912). Other members were teachers at the School. Mushet aside, probably the club's finest early player was John Waddell, who inaugurated a tradition of spin bowling (left-arm, in Waddell's case) and took nearly 300 wickets in six seasons before his early death in 1899. The Club groundsman was also usually a competent player, who would play for the team as the \"professional\". This tradition continued until the 1970s, with names including David \"Pa\" Nicoll, Arthur Creber and George Waites. By 1914, when play was stopped by the outbreak of war across Europe, the fixture list included most of Scotland's leading clubs outside the already existent Western Union.\nPost-war era.\nAfter the First World War, Heriot's FP emerged as one of the leading Clubs in the east of Scotland. The playing facilities at Goldenacre expanded to their present dimensions with two, sometimes three, squares. Several talented players appeared, such as batsman Alec Bateman, off-spinner Alex Gordon, opening bowler Jack Nicoll, and aggressive all-rounder Sid Plowright. But only two were capped, all-rounder Charles Groves and Club professional Arthur Creber, a quick bowler who has the only \"all-10\" in the First XI's history. Wicketkeeper Lindsay Mitchell would later become an influential figure as master in charge of cricket at the School, especially in the period after 1950 when a flood of playing talent emerged to inaugurate the club's most successful period on the field, between 1966 and 1985.\nThere was no East League until 1953. Once formed, however, Heriot's FP immediately became one of its leading sides, regularly challenging for the title of champions, although with no ultimate success for many years. The bowling attack was spearheaded by international fast bowlers Jim Souness and George Miller when available; Ken Scotland, also known as one of the many Herioter Scotland rugby full-backs, was also capped at cricket in 1955. The club had strength in depth too, with the Second XI winning its league (the Grade A) four times between 1954 and 1960. On the social side, developments included the licensing of a bar in the Club pavilion, the main mover being long-time member and later club president Jim Adair.\nTowards the end of the 1950s there emerged from the School Heriot's two most famous cricketers: off-spinning all-rounder George Goddard and opening batsman/wicketkeeper Hamish More. With their maturing influence ever more apparent, Heriot's FP finally won the East League for the first time in 1966, and went on to take the title again in 1969 and 1970. Goddard and More became the first Herioters to hold down regular places in the Scotland side: More scored his first international century in 1969, while Goddard was eventually appointed Scotland captain in 1974.\nOpen era.\nHeriot's FP went \"open\" in 1974, allowing a limited number of non-Herioters to become members. This move heralded a spectacular period of consistent success in an increasingly competitive East League. The championship was won eight times between 1974 and 1983, including seven successive titles from 1977 on. In addition the Club took the Scottish Cup in 1978, defeating ancient rivals Watsonians at Hamilton Crescent. Key recruits included internationalist opening bowlers in Peter Rhind, Eric Thompson and Jack Ker, alongside batsman Andrew Ker (who was first capped from the club). George Goddard and Hamish More continued amongst the leading players in Scotland throughout, and two other home-grown Herioters, spinners Richard Rodger and Euan McIntyre, were also capped in this remarkable period. Heriot's strength in depth was also apparent in the Second XI's four Grade A titles between 1971 and 1982.\nThe run-up to the club's celebration of its centenary season in 1989 was not so successful in terms of league titles and trophies, although the Second XI won the Grade A league again in 1988 (including a \"10-for\" performance by Dave McDougall). The centenary was marked not only by a cricket week blessed with fine weather and good matches, but also by publication of a detailed Club history which has since been enthusiastically reviewed by no less than best-selling author Alexander McCall Smith Alexander mccall smith (see his \"Love over Scotland\" (2006) p. 18). The interior of the Goldenacre pavilion, including the bar area, was modernised by the Heriot Trust in a further marking of the club's century.\n1990's.\nThe Goddard-More era ended in the early 1990s, the two having left far behind all previous Club wicket-taking and run-scoring record. Nonetheless, the Club entered the Scottish National League in 1996 as champions of the East League once again, having taken the title in successive seasons in 1994 and 1995. The Scottish Cup was won again in 2000, with victory over Grange in a match played at Boghall, Linlithgow. The National League has never been won but the Club remained in the Premier Division until the end of the 2009 season, when relegation followed defeat in a play-off with Forfarshire. However 2010 saw an immediate return to the top flight, and in 2012 the Scottish Cup was won again (and again against Watsonians, as in 1978), with the final taking place this time at Titwood in Glasgow. In the latter period of the club's history caps have been gained by Mike Allingham, Asim Butt, John Blain, Sean Weeraratna, Dewalt Nel, Stephen Knox and, continuing the More family theme, young Robert More (son of George) was capped in 2002.\nThe club's name-change, mentioned in the first paragraph above, resulted from the increasingly \"open\" nature of the membership; but it continues to enjoy strong links and relations with George Heriots School.\nRugby internationalists that played cricket for Heriot's.\nSeveral rugby internationalists have turned out for Heriot's Cricket Club over the years and the club still retains strong links with its sister rugby club.\nKen Scotland, Adam Buchanan-Smith, Andrew Ker (Kelso RFC) and Gordon Ross have all been capped for Scotland at rugby while playing their cricket at Goldenacre in the summer months.\nHome ground – Goldenacre.\nThose who know Goldenacre will be aware that the square was moved some years ago, with the famous slope being removed to leave a level outfield. The square has taken some time to \"bed in\"; however head groundsman Simon Theurer assisted by consultant Steve Wright, the former chief groundsman at Leicestershire County Cricket Club, toiled mightily in 2007 and the deck is becoming harder and faster. The club in conjunction with the school is looking to update many aspects of the ground and construct a new all weather net and practice facility.\n2012 – Scottish Cup winners.\nHeriot's won the Scottish Cup in 2012 defeating Edinburgh rivals Watsonians in the final by 6 wickets.\nThe 1st XI, captained by Scottish international cap Steve Knox, currently play in the Eastern Premier Division and run 3 senior and 3 junior teams. The club is entirely open nowadays and acts as a draw for top cricket players and aspiring youngsters from across the North of Edinburgh and Leith in particular.\n2013.\nIn 2013 Heriot's finished sixth in the Eastern Premier Division and reached the final of the Masterton Trophy, losing to close rival Grange in the final. The 3rd XI finished second in their league and got promoted. Cameron Farrell scored a record (including Masterton Trophy games) number of runs with 817 and an average of 68.08. Mark Watt finished top of the bowling figures taking 37 wickets at an average of 17.59. Mark Watt featured in the Scotland U/19 team that went to the World Cup in Sri Lanka at the end of the season.\n2014 season – 125th year.\nIn 2014 the club played once again in the Eastern Premier Division captained by Cameron Farrell, Steve Knox as coach and Chris Middleton as president. The club celebrated 125 years playing a Scotland XI on 27 July at Goldenacre as part of the celebrations.\nThe club finished 4th overall in the Premiership and the Under 18 team won the Scottish Championship for the first time in the club's history. Led by Mark Watt the team defeated Carlton in the final and also accounted for Grange, Watsonians, Clydesdale and Ayr en route to winning the Championship. Watt was subsequently called into the full Scotland squad.\nCurrent.\nThe current set up holds a first XI in the Eastern Premier Division, Second XI in ESCA Championship and Third XI in ESCA Division 2. The junior set up has the All stars, under 10's and under 12's .

        "text": "The following is a list of countries with their first Major League Baseball player. Listed are each country that at least one current or former major league player was born in, along with the name of the first person born in that country to play in a major league game, and the year and sports league of that player's major league debut.\nBackground.\nThe globalization of baseball has been occurring since its inception. After an influx of players from western Europe in early years, the major leagues came to see fewer European players and more players from Latin America. Players born in over 50 countries and on every continent except Antarctica have now appeared in major league games. Considerations:\nList.\nListed players appeared in at least one game of a professional baseball major league (commonly referred to as Major League Baseball, although that entity did not exist before 1903), which encompasses:\nThe seven major Negro leagues from 1920 to 1948 were officially recognized as \"major leagues\" in December 2020. Note that the status of the National Association as a major league is in dispute. National Association players are included in the major league records of sites such as Baseball-Reference.com and Retrosheet, thus are also included here.\n Hall and Wright both made their debut on 5 May 1871.\n&lt;br&gt; Immigrated to, raised in, and/or developed in the United States."

        "text": " is an arcade game released in 1990 by SNK for the Neo Geo console and arcade systems. The players controls characters with red and blue hair and can select balls from 8 to 15 pounds. It is the only bowling game released on the Neo Geo.\nModes.\n\"League Bowling\" has three types of modes, played up to 4 players.\nRegulation.\nPlayed just like a normal game of bowling, with 300 being a perfect score.\nFlash.\nValues of 100 to 300 will flash on a randomizer during the time the bowler throws his shot. A strike adds the bonus flash value to the score accumulated at the end of the game. Below each strike value is a smaller point value, which is added to the score for a spare.\nUnlike regular bowling, bonus shots in the tenth frame are not awarded; once a strike or spare is thrown, the game ends.\nThe maximum possible score is 3,000.\nStrike 90.\nPlayed just like regulation except that a strike scores 90 points for the frame, and a spare scores 60 for the frame, with no carry-over bonus. 30 points are awarded in the case of a field goal (throwing the ball in between the 7 and 10 pins). Like the Flash mode, there are no bonus shots in the tenth frame.\nThe maximum possible score is 900.\nMulti Link Play.\nIn addition, it also has the option to link up to 4 Neo-Geo MVS machines to become the 8-player game. This is the only Neo-Geo game that features the 8-player support. The 8-player gameplay video are shown on YouTube with the link below.\nReception.\nIn Japan, \"Game Machine\" listed \"League Bowling\" on their February 1, 1991 issue as being the eighth most-popular arcade game at the time. Likewise, \"RePlay\" reported the game to be the twentieth most-popular arcade game at the time. The title was met with mixed to positive reviews from critics, many of which criticized its awkward controls for being passable but praised its humorous artstyle as well as the characters and their reactions.\n\"AllGame\"s Kyle Knight praised the cartoon-style presentation, simple gameplay and multiplayer but criticized the audio and lack of replay value. \"Consoles Plus\"s J.B. Aerstut also commended the visual presentation, comparing it with the works of \"Tex Avery\", audio and playability but felt mixed in regards to its longevity. \"Hobby Consolas\" Manuel del Campo gave positive remarks to the multiplayer, character animations, appropriate music, sound and playability but criticized one gameplay aspect. \"Joystick\"s Jean-Marc Demoly and \"Player One\"s Cyril Drevet commented positively in regards to the animated audiovisual presentation, realism and longevity. \"Joystick\" also regarded it as one of the best bowling simulators in the genre but was criticized for being repetitive and limited.\nPorts.\nTom Fulp, the founder and CEO of Newgrounds, ported the game to Flash in 2002. The port features no ball selection, a regulation mode only, fewer animations, and the different player's sprites are the same.\nLater on 2010, SNK Playmore releases the NEOGEO Station, which includes the emulation of the game and other Neo-Geo games for the PlayStation 3 and the PSP.\nOn July 12, 2011, Virtual Console version for the Wii was released in Japan.\nEaster Egg.\nNadia, from the anime \"\", can be seen cheering in the background."

        "title": "Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs men's ice hockey",
        "text": "The Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs men's ice hockey team is an NCAA Division I college ice hockey program that represents the University of Minnesota Duluth. The Bulldogs are a member of the National Collegiate Hockey Conference (NCHC). The team plays home games at the 6,800-seat AMSOIL Arena at the Duluth Entertainment Convention Center.\nThe Bulldogs program has produced many NHL players such as Glenn 'Chico' Resch, Jim Johnson who is currently the assistant coach for the San Jose Sharks, Tom Kurvers, Dave Langevin, and Bob Mason. Perhaps the best known alumni of Minnesota-Duluth include Hockey Hall of Fame member Brett Hull, as well as Mark Pavelich and John Harrington, both of whom were members of the \"Miracle on Ice\" gold medal-winning 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team. On April 9, 2011, the Bulldogs defeated the University of Michigan, 3–2 in overtime, to win its first NCAA Division I Championship. UMD captured its second national championship on April 7, 2018, with a 2–1 win over the University of Notre Dame, and its third championship (and second consecutive one) on April 13, 2019, with a 3–0 win over the University of Massachusetts Amherst.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nDuluth started its ice hockey team in 1930 but shuttered the program after only two years. Once the depression and World War II had ended, the Bulldogs rekindled the team and played as a minor independent for a few seasons before joining the MIAC as a provisional member. When UMD joined the MIAC fully in 1952 it coincided with the Bulldog's dominance of the conference. In its first two eligible seasons Minnesota–Duluth won the MIAC crown, going 15–2 in league play. After Bob Boyat's one season behind the bench where the team finished 2nd in conference, Connie Pleban took over and the Bulldogs ran roughshod over the MIAC. Duluth won six consecutive MIAC titles without losing a single game in league play. UMD also began to win against some of the major programs by the early 1960 and in 1962, with Ralph Romano now at the helm, the Duluth hockey team left the MIAC and played as an independent looking to promote itself as a major program (no formal distinctions between levels of play existed at the time for ice hockey).\nWCHA.\nAfter four seasons the WCHA invited Minnesota–Duluth to join as its 8th member school. The addition of the Bulldogs allowed the WCHA to hold an 8-team conference tournament, which meant that UMD would participate in the first championship in program history. Predictably, the Bulldogs didn't fare well the first time out and that trend held for several seasons, as it wasn't until 1971 that Duluth notched its first postseason victory. More concerning was that, in its first 15 seasons in the WCHA, UMD produced only 2 winning seasons and never finished above 5th place in the conference. All of that was set to change, however, when Mike Sertich was promoted to head coach in 1982.\n1980s success.\nUnder Sertich UMD made the NCAA Tournament three straight seasons from 1983 to 1985. The Bulldogs advanced to the NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament for the first time in school history in 1983, but were defeated by Providence College in a two-game series by the scores of 3–7 and 2–3.\nIn 1983–84 UMD won its first conference regular season title and conference postseason tournament to receive the program's second bid to the NCAA tournament. UMD defeated Clarkson University in the quarterfinals and advanced to the 1984 Frozen Four in Lake Placid, New York. UMD reached the title game by defeating WCHA foe, University of North Dakota, 2–1 in overtime. The championship game featured a match-up between Minnesota–Duluth and Bowling Green (CCHA). After 60 minutes of hockey, the game remained tied, 4–4. Bowling Green's Gino Cavallini scored a goal in the fourth overtime to defeat UMD in the longest NCAA Division I ice hockey championship game in history, 97 minutes and 11 seconds of playing time.\nFor the third season in a row, the Bulldogs reached the NCAA tournament and for the second straight season UMD reached the Frozen Four. The team had their hopes for a national championship lost in another overtime game, this time a 6–5 semi-final loss in three overtimes to Rensselaer. The Bulldogs would rebound in the third place game to defeat Boston College, 2–1 in overtime.\nMinnesota–Duluth next bid to the NCAA tournament would come in 1993. The Bulldogs faced Brown University in the first round, winning 7–3. UMD was defeated by Lake Superior State in the quarterfinals, 4–3. Lake Superior State would go on to the Frozen Four, losing in the national title game to Maine.\nRecent history.\nUMD's next NCAA post-season berth came after an 11-year drought in 2004. The Bulldogs won the first game in the Midwest Regional, shutting out Michigan State 5–0. The win over Michigan State set up a game against WCHA rival and the defending back-to-back national champions, Minnesota. UMD advanced to the Frozen Four by defeating Minnesota 3–1 and faced another WCHA rival, Denver, in the semi-final game. After two periods, with UMD leading, it was looking very likely that UMD would make it into the NCAA Championship game since UMD hadn't lost all season when leading after two periods, but the Bulldogs lost to the Pioneers 5–3 after a four-goal third period by Denver.\nThe 2008–09 season marked a historic season for the Bulldogs. The 5th-seeded Minnesota–Duluth swept through the 2009 WCHA playoffs. UMD swept Colorado College in the opening round by scores of 4–1 and 3–1. The Bulldogs advanced to the WCHA Final Five and won 2–1 against Minnesota in the opening game at the Xcel Energy Center in Saint Paul, Minnesota; In the next game, the team beat North Dakota with a 3–0 shutout victory and advanced to the WCHA championship against Denver. Playing in the third game in three days, the Bulldogs shocked the crowd when the team defeated Denver with a 4–0 shutout win. The win over DU was the program's third WCHA Playoff Championship in the school's history and marked the first time that a 4th or 5th-seeded team had won the WCHA Final Five. The historic playoff run by UMD was punctuated by winning three games against ranked teams in three consecutive nights, including back-to-back shutouts from goaltender Alex Stalock; in addition to the shutouts, the Bulldogs allowed only three goals against through the entire WCHA playoffs.\nWith the WCHA title, Minnesota–Duluth secured an automatic bid to the 2009 NCAA Tournament. The Bulldogs entered tournament play and amazingly forced overtime by scoring two goals in the last 40 seconds of regulation and then scored in overtime for a 5–4 overtime win over Princeton. The team advanced to the West Regional final against first-ranked Miami (Ohio). In the game the RedHawks took a 2–0 lead into the third period when the team rallied back and scored late in the game.\nThe 2010–11 season marked a historic year for the UMD program. On December 30, 2010, the Bulldogs moved into the new 6,800-seat AMSOIL Arena located at the Duluth Entertainment Convention Center. In 2011, the Bulldogs earned an at-large NCAA Tournament bid. They reached the Frozen Four for the fourth time in the school's history with 2–0 and 5–3 wins over Union College and Yale University, respectively. UMD was the only Minnesota team competing in the 2011 Frozen Four at the Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul, essentially making it a home series for the team. On April 7, the Bulldogs defeated Notre Dame by a score of 4–3 to secure its first trip to the championship game since the 1983–84 season. On April 9, the Bulldogs beat the Michigan Wolverines 3–2 in overtime to win their first men's ice hockey championship in school history.\nIn the summer of 2011, Minnesota Duluth, along with five other schools, announced the formation of a new conference, known as the National Collegiate Hockey Conference (NCHC).

The tournament was held at Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, Russia. \nNew Zealand won the tournament, defeating England 33–0 in the final. Attendance for the tournament was poor, with matches played in mostly empty stadiums.\nWorld Rugby, then known as the International Rugby Board (IRB), initially stated that the Rugby World Cup Sevens would be scrapped if rugby sevens were to be included in the Olympic programme for the 2016 Summer Olympics. As the International Olympic Committee voted for the sport's inclusion, this was thought likely to be the last edition of the tournament. However, the IRB clarified that in June 2013, the tournament would be retained and held quadrennially from 2018.\nHosting.\nIn December 2009, the IRB confirmed that the governing rugby boards of Brazil (Brazilian Rugby Association), Germany (German Rugby Federation) and Russia (Rugby Union of Russia) formally expressed their intention to tender to host the tournament. Scottish Rugby Union, the governing rugby board of Scotland, which did not choose to express interest, was also previously considering bidding for the tournament.\nIn February 2010, the IRB reported that Rugby Union of Russia had formally submitted its tender for the right to host Rugby World Cup Sevens 2013, while the Brazilian and German rugby boards had confirmed their withdrawal from the bidding process. This announcement left Russia as the only country bidding to host the event.\n\"This tender submission underlines our continued commitment to ignite a new Rugby frontier in Russia through a strategic vision of promotion, participation and growth.\"\n—Vyacheslav Kopiev, President of Rugby Union of Russia\nSix days before hosting the 2010 IRB Junior World Rugby Trophy, Russia was officially named as host at the IRB annual congress on 12 May 2010.\nQualification.\nNotes (Men's):\n Canada and United States qualified for the tournament taking the 2 available places in the North America/Caribbean category.\n Zimbabwe and Tunisia qualified for the tournament taking the 2 available places in the Africa category.\n Australia and Tonga qualified for the tournament taking the 2 available places in the Oceania category.\n Portugal, Spain, France, Georgia and Scotland qualified for the tournament taking the 5 available places in the Europe category.\n Japan, Hong Kong and Philippines qualified for the tournament taking the 3 available places in the Asia category.\n Uruguay qualified for the tournament taking the 1 and only place available in the South America category.\nNotes (Women's):\n Canada qualified for the tournament through NACRA's regional qualifying tournament taking the 1 and only place available in the North America/Caribbean category.\n Tunisia qualified for the tournament taking the 1 available place in the Africa category.\n England, Ireland, Spain, France and Netherlands qualified for the tournament taking the 5 available places in the European category.\n Fiji, Japan, and China qualified for the tournament through AFRU's regional qualifying tournament taking the 3 available places in the Asian and Oceania category.\n Brazil qualified through CONSUR's regional qualifying tournament taking the 1 and only place in the South America category.\nQualified teams.\nMen\nWomen"

        "text": "Fishless cycling is a form of \"maturing\" an aquarium. In this process, ammonia is provided to allow beneficial bacteria to colonize. Fishless cycling can reduce the chance of fish loss resulting from insufficient populations of these bacteria.\nProcess.\nFishless cycling takes place over a period of several weeks, during which the aquarist provides an ammonia source for the development of the nitrifying bacterial colony. Nitrifying bacteria in the aquarium grow on all surfaces, but particularly in areas of high water flow and high surface area such as the filter. Allowing ammonia to be converted to nitrite, and on to the less harmful nitrate, minimizes stress and injury to aquarium fish. The \"nitrogen cycle\" may take several weeks to complete, but may be quicker under certain conditions. Higher water temperatures, greater dissolved oxygen and bacterial seeding from an established tank may cut down the time required to less than a week.\nAdvantages.\nThe most significant advantage of fishless cycling is that it can reduce fish loss due to ammonia and nitrite spikes. Fish loss can be very discouraging for beginners of fish keeping, so indirectly, fishless cycling can also help beginners get a good start.\nCycling aquariums using feeder fish is risky, because it infects the aquarium with any disease or parasite they happen to have. Fish raised as feeders do not get the same degree of care as non-feeders. Fishless cycling avoids this potential problem.\nFishless cycling also allows the aquarium to be partially stocked from the moment it is cycled, if the nitrogen cycle is completed with high concentration of pure ammonia added daily. This means that for large aquariums, where fish must be added in several batches, fishless cycling is faster than cycling with fish. It can also be extremely useful when the fish keeper plan to stock a tank full of territorial aggressive fish, such as African cichlids, where the later added fish can be at a disadvantage. However, care in adding ammonia for fishless cycling must be used, too high of an ammonium concentration can kill the helpful bacteria. \nDisadvantages.\nThese are not problems when ammonium hydroxide or ammonium chloride is used as the source of ammonia."

        "title": "Darren Lewis (American football)",
        "text": "Darren Lewis (born November 7, 1968), nicknamed \"Tank\", is an American former professional football player who was a running back for three seasons with the Chicago Bears of the National Football League (NFL) in the early 1990s. He played college football for the Texas A&amp;M Aggies and was a consensus All-American in 1990. He was a sixth-round selection by the Bears in the 1991 NFL Draft.\nHigh school.\nLewis was a star at Dallas football powerhouse Carter High School and was considered by some to be the top high school player in the class of 1987. While at Carter, Lewis was reported to be avoiding colleges in the Southwest Conference. \"I don't want my football career to end because some other guy takes money,\" Lewis said.\nCollege.\nLewis attended Texas A&amp;M University, and holds two of the top three rushing seasons in Aggies' history (1,692 in 1988 and 1,691 in 1990), behind Trayveon Williams (1,760 in 2018) and is the Aggie leader in career rushing yards (5,012 from 1987 to 1990). Lewis' 5,012 career rushing yards ranked him fifth on the NCAA's all-time career rushing list at the conclusion of his college career, but currently rank him 15th. His college career was filled with highlights and culminated with a spot on the first-team All-American team in 1990.\n1987 season.\nAs a freshman Lewis ran for 103 yards and two touchdowns against Baylor to lead the Aggies to a 34–10 victory, their first in Waco in 10 years. He ran for a freshman record 194 yards in a 42–24 whipping of TCU, which was broken four years later by fellow Carter High alum, Greg Hill. He capped off the season by throwing a 24-yard halfback pass to Tony Thompson for a touchdown as the Aggies stomped Notre Dame, 35–10, in the 1988 Cotton Bowl Classic, and finished ranked in the NCAA top-10 for the second time in three years. His 668 rushing yards were second at the time only to Curtis Dickey for an Aggie freshman.\n1988 season.\nIn his sophomore season of 1988, the Aggies were ineligible for the Southwest Conference championship due to NCAA violations, but an undaunted Lewis enjoyed a record-breaking season. He rushed 100 yards or more in each of the last 10 games of the season, setting a mark for both consecutive 100-yard games and most in one season, both still A&amp;M records. His streak included strong road performances highlighted by a 192-yard showing in Fayetteville against the Arkansas Razorbacks and a 201-yard effort at the Astrodome against Houston. Against Texas, Lewis helped the Aggies jump to a 28–0 lead by scoring a 15-yard touchdown and adding a 36-yard run to set up a second score. Lewis ran for 212 yards that day as the Aggies went on to beat the Longhorns 28–24 for their fifth consecutive win against their main rival. His 1,692 yards rushing that year is remained a Texas A&amp;M record until broken in 2018 by Trayveon Williams and was second in the NCAA that year only to Oklahoma State's Barry Sanders. Lewis was named to the All-Southwest Conference team, his first of two such honors (1988 and 1990).\n1989 season.\nIn 1989, Lewis helped new head coach R. C. Slocum get off to a good start by rushing for three touchdowns in a tight road victory against Texas Tech. Lewis also rushed for 120 yards against Houston and along with fullback Robert Wilson (115 rushing yards), helped control the ball and hold a Cougar offense that averaged nearly 60 points in their other games to just 13 against the Wrecking Crew. His strongest performance of the season was against Rice, in which he ran for 201 yards. Although his 961 total rushing yards were a down year by Lewis' standards, the total still ranked seventh best all-time at Texas A&amp;M.\n1990 season.\nIn 1990 Lewis etched his name into the A&amp;M record books by finishing his college career with perhaps his finest season, as he led the country in rushing and was named a first-team All American. He set a scoring benchmark against Houston, as he ran for 124 yards and four rushing touchdowns, breaking three tackles on a 12-yard run for a score in the fourth quarter in a 36–31 loss to Houston. His 232 yards against Texas Tech is second all-time in Texas A&amp;M history and was the highest total for an Aggie in 40 years. The Aggies would go on to demolish BYU and Heisman Trophy winner Ty Detmer, 65–14, in the Holiday Bowl behind Lewis' 104 rushing yards and two touchdowns, vaulting the Aggies from unranked to a No.15 finish in the AP Poll. Lewis finished his college career with over 5,000 rushing yards, which at the time was fifth all-time in NCAA history. His 45 career rushing touchdowns were a Texas A&amp;M record for nearly 20 years until being broken by Jorvorskie Lane in 2008. His 27 career 100 yard games are still an A&amp;M record and his five career 200-yard rushing games are both a Texas A&amp;M and Southwest Conference record.\nProfessional career.\nDespite his spectacular college career, Lewis' stock fell quickly after he tested positive for cocaine at the NFL scouting combine. He was selected in the sixth round of the 1991 NFL Draft (161st overall pick) by the Chicago Bears. Lewis was the only player to test positive for drugs at the combine, and Chicago general manager Bill Tobin said that he thought a different player had tested positive. Tobin considered not inviting Lewis to minicamp.\nLewis spent portions of three seasons with the Bears. His best NFL season came in 1992, when he appeared in 16 games and gained 382 yards on 90 rushing attempts. In October 1993, Lewis was arrested and charged with battery following a domestic dispute. The Bears released Lewis later that month after the team signed running back Tim Worley. Chicago head coach Dave Wannstedt said that if something happened to starting running back Neal Anderson, he was not comfortable that Lewis could take over starting duties.\nLewis played in 33 games for the Bears, starting five of them and totaling 431 rushing yards in his career.\nAfter football.\nLewis continued to struggle with a cocaine addiction, which resulted in a divorce and the loss of his house. In August 2014, he pleaded guilty to three criminal charges related to armed robberies in the Dallas area. At his sentencing the following month, Lewis was given a 27-year term in federal prison. Lewis married Tammie Thibodeaux July 6, 2012."

        "text": "&lt;br&gt;\nRobert Louis Carpenter (December 12, 1917 – October 19, 2005), was an American professional baseball pitcher who appeared in 80 games in Major League Baseball (MLB) between and , and again from to , with the New York Giants and Chicago Cubs. Born in Chicago, he stood tall, weighed , and batted and threw right-handed.\nCarpenter entered baseball in 1936 at age 18 in the Class C Cotton States League. In his fifth pro season, he was called up to the Giants in September 1940. His maiden appearance came as the starting pitcher against the Boston Bees at the Polo Grounds on September 5; he lasted six innings and allowed three earned runs without earning a decision. Then, over two weeks later on September 22, Carpenter was given his second MLB starting assignment, also against Boston. This time, he earned a complete game, 7–3 victory at the \"Beehive\", allowing nine hits and striking out four. Four days later, he was even more effective, shutting down the last-place Philadelphia Phillies 2–1 on six hits in another complete game for his second big-league triumph. \nCarpenter appeared in 57 games for the –1942 Giants, 44 of them starts, and won 11 games each season. He threw 20 complete games and three shutouts, and he earned two saves coming out of the New York bullpen. He then missed three consecutive baseball campaigns during his service in the United States Army during World War II. When he returned to baseball in 1946, he was ineffective, apart from a four-hit shutout against the Boston Braves on May 26. He worked in only 12 games, and only one contest after June 28. He won only one of four decisions, with a mediocre 4.85 earned run average. \nThen, in 1947, the Giants released him May 12 after two poor outings. He was given a second chance by the Cubs on July 25. The following day at Wrigley Field, he gained a measure of revenge against the Giants, retiring all six men he faced in a relief assignment, but he worked in only three more games through August 13 in what would be his final season in baseball.\nIn his 80 games pitched, Carpenter posted a 25–20 record and 3.60 earned run average. In 54 starts, he threw 23 complete games and four shutouts. He allowed 411 hits and 132 bases on balls, with 134 strikeouts, in 399 innings of work. Twenty-four of his 25 victories came before his wartime service.\nBob Carpenter died at age 88 in Evergreen Park, Illinois."

He is one of the few players in the history of the German team who was a professional.\nBiography.\nMohr was born in Hannover on 25 August 1978.\nHe played for Bourgoin in the Heineken Cup in 1999–2000.\nMohr scored a try in Germany's home game against Spain in the qualifying for the 2007 Rugby World Cup, which the team won.\nThe German rugby federation repeatedly tried to have Mohr released for the team but his club refused despite being obliged to.\nMohr and his club, La Rochelle, finished in the top five of the French second division in each season from 2007 through 2010. After failing to earn promotion in the first three seasons, losing in the promotion semi-finals in 2008 and 2009 and in the final in 2007, the club finally broke through with a win over Lyon in the 2010 promotion final. After ten years with La Rochelle he announced his departure from the club in 2012. Being thought after by German club DSV 78 Hannover he decided to stay in France and join third division side Stade Niortais instead. He played his last competitive rugby match on 6 April 2013, when he fielded for Germany against Sweden in a 73–17 victory. Mohr retired after this match from international and club rugby and will work for a drink vending machine manufacturer and also act as a talent scout for La Rochelle. He however returned to the German team one more time in May 2014 in the decisive world cup qualifier against Russia which Germany lost.\nHe was part of Germany's 7's side at the 2009 Hannover Sevens.\nStats.\nRobert Mohr's personal statistics in club and international rugby:"

Argentina credited its own players with test match caps for both games on that tour, and for two games against the New Zealand XV when Argentina toured New Zealand in 1979.

        "text": "The Louisiana Tech Lady Techsters basketball team represents Louisiana Tech University in Ruston, Louisiana. The team currently competes in Conference USA. The current head coach of the Lady Techsters is Brooke Stoehr. Louisiana Tech has won three National Championships and has competed in 13 Final Fours, 23 Sweet Sixteens, and 27 NCAA tournaments. The Lady Techsters basketball program boasts three Wade Trophy winners, five Olympic medalists, eight members of the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame, 16 All-Americans, and 21 WNBA players. The Lady Techsters have an all-time record of 1207–406, with a .748 winning percentage, and are the fifth program in NCAA history to reach 1,200 wins. The Lady Techsters have made 27 appearances in the NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament, which is the twelfth most all-time.\nHistory.\nSonja Hogg Era (1974–1982).\nIn 1974, Louisiana Tech President F. Jay Taylor established the university's first women's athletic program, a women's basketball team. He hired a 28-year-old P.E. teacher at Ruston High School, Sonja Hogg, as the program's first head coach. Following 13- and 19-win seasons in 1974 and 1975, she never won less than 20 games in a season for the rest of her time at Louisiana Tech. The late 70s and early 80s saw much success, with Hogg leading the Lady Techsters to 4 straight Final Four appearances from 1978 to 1981, including 2 national championships in 1980 and 1981.\nHogg-Barmore Era (1982–1985).\nLeon Barmore joined the Lady Techster staff in 1977 as an assistant, quickly moving up the ranks. After becoming Associate Head Coach in 1980, he was named co-head coach in 1982. With this duo leading, Tech saw continued dominance, including 3 straight trips to the NCAA tournament, 2 Final Four appearances, and 1 appearance in the final match. Following the 1985 season, Hogg left to coach at Deer Park High School, leaving Barmore solely in charge of the program.\nLeon Barmore Era (1985–2002).\nFollowing Sonja Hogg's departure, Leon Barmore once again continued the dominance of previous years. During 16 years as the sole head coach, Barmore coached the Techsters to the NCAA tournament every season, 7 Final Four appearances, 4 more trips to the final round, and 1 additional national title during the 1987–1988 season. He also successfully navigated the Techsters through conference moves to the American South, Sun Belt, and WAC; winning 13 regular-season conference titles. Retiring after the 2001 season, Barmore had earned a coaching record of 576 wins and 87 losses, good for a win percentage of .869 and the 2nd best in basketball history. He has been inducted into both the Basketball Hall of Fame and the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame.\nKurt Budke Era (2002–2005).\nAfter Barmore's retirement, Kurt Budke was named as head coach of the Lady Techsters. Budke had served as an associate head coach under Barmore since 2000 and had previously coached successfully in the NJCAA. In his 3 years as head coach, the Techsters earned 3 regular season conference titles, 2 conference tournament titles, 3 NCAA tournament appearances, and 2 Sweet Sixteen appearances. Following the 2004–2005 season, Budke was hired by Oklahoma State to fill the same position. He left Ruston with an 80–16 record.\nChris Long Era (2005–2009).\nChris Long, another assistant who had been on staff under Barmore, was named as the 4th Lady Techsters head coach in 2005. While he started his tenure continuing the dominance of previous coaches, including 2 regular season conference titles and 1 NCAA tournament appearance, he was fired halfway into the 2008–2009 season after a 12–11 start. This followed a 16–15 season in 2007–2008 where Tech failed to play in the postseason for the second season in a row. He left the Techsters with a 71–44 record.\nTeresa Weatherspoon Era (2009–2014).\nAfter Chris Long was fired midway into the 2008–2009 season, Teresa Weatherspoon was named Interim head coach, later becoming the 5th head coach of the Lady Techsters. Previously, she had played under Sonja Hogg and Leon Barmore from 1984 to 1988 and had been an associate head coach at Louisiana Tech since 2008. As head coach, she led the Techsters to 2 regular season conference titles, 1 conference tournament title in 2009–2010, and 2 NCAA tournament appearances. Following Louisiana Tech's move from the WAC to Conference USA in 2013, Weatherspoon was fired after a 12–20 season where the Lady Techsters finished last in the conference.\nTyler Summitt Era (2014–2016).\nTyler Summitt was hired in 2014 following Teresa Weatherspoon's firing. Previously he served as an assistant coach at Marquette from 2012 to 2014. Summitt gathered a 30–31 record during his tenure in Ruston. His time as head coach was marked by scandal, however, as news broke that he was involved in an extramarital affair with Brooke Pumroy, a player who had transferred from Marquette along with Summitt. After this affair was leaked, Summitt resigned on April 7, 2016.\nBrooke Stoehr Era (since 2016).\nBrooke Stoehr was hired to be the next head coach of the Lady Techsters following Tyler Summitt's resignation in April 2016. Previously, she coached for 4 seasons at Northwestern State. Before that, she played at Tech for 4 seasons from 1998 to 2002 under Leon Barmore. Currently, in her eighth season as head coach, she has led the Techsters to 4 WNIT bids, and 1 division regular season conference title.\nSeasons.\n \nPostseason results.\nAIAW Division I.\nThe Lady Techsters made three appearances in the AIAW women's basketball tournament, with a combined record of 9–3. \nHome venues.\nThomas Assembly Center.\nThe Thomas Assembly Center (TAC) has been home to the Lady Techsters basketball team since the 8,000-seat facility opened in November 1982. Constructed at a cost of $17.5 million, the TAC is a cylindrical arena with a concrete finish and bronze glass at the entrance level. In 2007 a new state-of-the-art maple wood floor was installed in the TAC and named \"Karl Malone Court.\"\nIn the Lady Techsters' first game at the TAC, Louisiana Tech lost to USC, led by Cheryl Miller and Cynthia Cooper, 64–58 in front of 8,700 fans on December 4, 1982. However, the Lady Techsters picked up their first win at the TAC in their next game by defeating Alabama 83–56 on December 9, 1982.\nOn January 22, 1985, Louisiana Tech set an attendance record of 8,975 at the TAC in a women's/men's doubleheader in which the Lady Techsters defeated Northeast Louisiana 79–77 in overtime. The Lady Techsters have hosted 15 crowds of more than 7,000 and eight capacity crowds of more than 8,000. The Lady Techsters regularly rank in the Top 40 in NCAA women's basketball average attendance, including a program record average of 5,330 in 1983–84.\nThe Lady Techsters have been almost unbeatable at the TAC. As of the 2022–23 season, the Lady Techsters boast a 522–106 record at the TAC, an 83.1% winning percentage. The Lady Techsters have recorded thirteen undefeated seasons at the TAC, and is a perfect 36–0 all-time in NCAA tournament games there. The Lady Techsters won 161 consecutive games against unranked opponents at home from 1992 to 2004, and the Lady Techsters won 114 consecutive regular season home conference games between 1992 and 2007; and have posted home winning streaks of 49, 52 and 62 games, all of which rank in the Top 15 in Division I history.\nMemorial Gymnasium.\nIn 1952, Memorial Gymnasium, now Scotty Robertson Memorial Gymnasium, was constructed on the Louisiana Tech University campus in Ruston to serve as the home of the Louisiana Tech Bulldogs basketball. After the inception of the Lady Techsters basketball team in 1974, Memorial Gymnasium was home to Lady Techster basketball through the 1981–82 season. In the first game in program history, the Lady Techsters lost to Southeastern Louisiana 55–59 in Memorial Gym on January 7, 1975. However, in their next game, the Lady Techsters rebounded to defeat LSU 97–83 to christen Memorial Gym with the first victory in Louisiana Tech women's basketball history on January 24, 1975.\nDuring the 1979–80 season, more than 5,000 fans routinely packed inside Memorial Gym to watch the Lady Techsters play, and Louisiana Tech's attendance peaked at 6,220 for UCLA and 6,314 for Stephen F. Austin. After that season, the Louisiana State Fire Marshall ordered Louisiana Tech to not allow more than 5,200 spectators into Memorial Gym again. If Louisiana Tech did not comply, the fire marshal vowed to personally count the crowd and not let more than 4,800 enter Memorial Gym again. As a result, Louisiana Tech President F. Jay Taylor initiated the construction of the 8,000 capacity Thomas Assembly Center.\nIn the Lady Techsters' final game played in Memorial Gym, Louisiana Tech defeated Kentucky 82–60 on March 20, 1982, in the Midwest regional final of the first NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament. Throughout the eight seasons the Lady Techsters played in Memorial Gymnasium, Louisiana Tech amassed 84 wins and only 6 losses at home. The Lady Techsters' 93.3% winning percentage at Memorial Gym ranks third best all-time only trailing Tennessee at Thompson–Boling Arena (94.2%) and Connecticut at Gampel Pavilion (93.7%).\nTraditions.\nLady Techsters.\nWhen Sonja Hogg was hired in 1974 as the first women's basketball coach, she refused to call her team the Lady Bulldogs after the Louisiana Tech men's nickname. She asserted that bulldogs were \"unfeminine\" and that \"a lady dog is a b!+¢#.\" For that reason, her first initiative as head coach was to nix the nickname Bulldogs from any connection with her team. Thus, Hogg decided to change her team's nickname to the Lady Techsters.\nHogg would not allow her Lady Techsters to wear knee or elbow pads because they were unladylike. A 1986 Sports Illustrated article stated, \"A Lady Techster is likely to be a good student and a devout Christian, probably favors needlepoint over Madonna tapes on airplanes and fears a drug test about as much as she does an airport metal detector.\" The same article stated that Hogg's insistence that her players act like ladies gave the team an \"almost antebellum image\" that was well-suited to a conservative town like Ruston.\nColumbia Blue.\nIn 1896, Col. A.T. Prescott, president of what was then Louisiana Polytechnic Institute, announced the selection of red and blue as the institution's colors. Red was chosen to represent courage, and blue was selected to embody loyalty. In the 1960s, Columbia blue was introduced to Louisiana Tech in various applications. In 1974, Sonja Hogg, along with the head of the university's art department, Raymond Nichols, presented various shades of blue to the athletics council, and Hogg's preference of Columbia blue was adopted as the primary color of the Lady Techsters. Prior to 2003, the university's teams, departments, and organizations used various shades of blue ranging from light blue to dark blue. Yet in 2003, Louisiana Tech standardized its shade of blue by adopting reflex blue as the official hue. However, due to Louisiana Tech's rich tradition in women's basketball, the Lady Techsters basketball team was granted the only exemption to not adopt reflex blue and was allowed to continue to use the traditional Columbia blue. While other teams have since used Columbia blue in limited capacity, the shade is still mostly synonymous with the women's basketball team.\nJersey Sleeves.\nIn 1974, Sonja Hogg designed the Lady Techster jerseys with modest sleeves to avoid her players showing sports bra straps (or before their invention, regular bra straps) or underarms. As Lady Techster basketball rose to national prominence, the jersey sleeves became recognized as part of the Lady Techster brand. Sleeves remained a staple of the Lady Techsters jerseys throughout Leon Barmore's tenure as head coach. After Barmore retired in 2002, new head coach Kurt Budke introduced the first Lady Techsters sleeveless jerseys at the behest of the players.\nHoop Troop.\nHoop Troop is the official basketball pep band at Louisiana Tech University. The \"Hoop Troop\" performs at most women's basketball home games and travels to select road basketball games. The band also usually travels to all post-season games played by the Lady Techsters, and is known nationally as one of the best basketball bands in college basketball. In the 2005 post-season, the \"Hoop Troop\" was featured in a \"Sports Illustrated's College Edition\" article, \"65 Things We Want to See During March Madness\" in which states, \"30) The Louisiana Tech pep band, a.k.a. the Hoop Troop, the funniest band in the land.\" The \"Hoop Troop\" was the only basketball band to be listed.\nPlayers.\nHonors.\nWade Trophy\nThree Lady Techsters have been awarded the Wade Trophy, the award presented annually to the best women's basketball player in the NCAA. Connecticut is the only program to have more than three players awarded the Wade Trophy.\nNaismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame\nWomen's Basketball Hall of Fame\nAll-Americans\nEleven Lady Techsters have been awarded 16 Kodak First Team All-America honors.\nConference player of the year\nFourteen Lady Techsters have garnered 19 conference player of the year honors.\nOlympic medalists.\nLady Techsters have won five Olympic Games medals.\nLady Techsters in the WNBA.\nTwenty-one former Lady Techsters have been drafted or played in the WNBA.

        "title": "1886 World Series",
        "text": "The 1886 World Series was won by the St. Louis Browns (later the Cardinals) of the American Association over the Chicago White Stockings (later the Cubs) of the National League, four games to two. The series was played on six consecutive days running from October 18 to October 23 in Chicago and St. Louis.\nThe teams were judged to be approximately equal going into the series, with gamblers betting on the teams at even odds. However, Chicago pitcher Jim McCormick was sidelined by a chronic foot ailment after game 2, and third Chicago pitcher Jocko Flynn had already been lost for the season due to an arm ailment. An effort to use a substitute pitcher was protested by St. Louis, with the board of umpires flipping a coin to decide the matter in favor of the Browns. With his team unable to field a competent second starter, Chicagos ace John Clarkson proved unable to carry the full pitching load, tipping the series to St. Louis.\nThe series was decided in extra innings of game 6 by Curt Welch's so-called \"$15,000 slide\" following a passed ball. The decisive run scored by Welch became one of the most famous plays in the history of baseball in that era.\nBackground.\nIn 1886, the St. Louis Browns won the American Association championship for the second consecutive season with a record of 93–46, while the Chicago White Stockings won the National League championship with a record of 90–34. The victory for the White Stockings, who featured the slugger Cap Anson, marked the 6th time in 11 years that the team had garnered the National League pennant.\nThe two teams agreed to meet each other in a best-of-seven pre-modern-era World Series, with the winner taking all the prize money. It was the second straight year that the Browns and White Stockings met in the World Series. The six games of the series were played on six consecutive days. The first three games were scheduled for Chicago, with the next three games to be held in St. Louis. A decisive seventh game, if necessary, was to be held in a neutral site. The location of the rubber game in the match was to be determined by coin toss, with each franchise owner selecting a city for the game.\nGoing into the series, gamblers are said to have assessed the teams as approximately equal, with bets on the series outcome commonly taking place at even money. More than $50,000 was said to have been wagered on the series in St. Louis alone. The Browns are said to have traveled together on a special rail car to Chicago on the day before the scheduled October 18 start of the series.\nGame summaries.\nGame 1.\nMonday, October 18, 1886 at Chicago Ball Park in Chicago, Illinois\nThe Browns arrived in Chicago on the morning of game day, October 18, and were immediately incensed at an article appearing in the morning \"Chicago Tribune\" calling Browns' star third baseman Arlie Latham a \"monkey\" and advising that White Stockings outfielder King Kelly should create a collision with him on the base. The series started in cold, windy conditions at 3:00 pm, with the grandstands filled with a crowd estimated variously between 3,000 and 5,000 — somewhat fewer than anticipated.\nThe game began with a coin toss to determine which side would bat first, with Anson and Chicago winning the call and sending the Browns to the plate to open.\nAfter retiring the side in order in the top of the first, Chicago quickly jumped out to a two-run lead powered by a Cap Anson RBI triple to the right-center gap. Clean-up hitter Fred Pfeffer drove Anson home with a single, and the blue-uniformed home team took a lead, 2–0. This would prove to be all the scoring that the White Stockings needed for the win as Chicago's ace pitcher John Clarkson (a future member of the Baseball Hall of Fame) struck out ten in throwing a five-hit shutout as \"Anson's Pets\" beat Dave Foutz and the Browns, 6–0.\nGame 2.\nTuesday, October 19, 1886 at Chicago Ball Park in Chicago, Illinois\nScottish-born right-hander Jim McCormick got the start and took the loss for Chicago, giving up two home runs to St. Louis outfielder Tip O'Neill. St. Louis curveball specialist Bob Caruthers made short work of the home team, allowing just two hits and cruising to a 12–0 victory in a game mercifully shortened to 8 innings by darkness.\nThe game was reckoned by one sportswriter to be \"one of the worst games...ever played\" by the Chicagos, who not only failed to hit Caruthers but who also \"fielded like a parcel of schoolboys out on a lark and missed nearly every opportunity given them to do effective work.\" Chicago committed an astounding 12 errors and made 2 wild pitches in the defeat, with third baseman Tom Burns single-handedly adding 4 errors to the team total.\nGame 3.\nWednesday, October 20, 1886 at Chicago Ball Park in Chicago, Illinois\nHeavy morning rain in Chicago followed by extensive drizzle threatened the third game of the 1886 World Series on October 20. However, around 2:00 pm the skies cleared up and the ground was fit to play when the teams took the field for warmups shortly before 3:00 pm. Attendance was weak, doubtlessly owing to the bad weather. Coming off his complete game 1-hitter the previous day, Bob Caruthers again took the ball for the Browns, while John Clarkson made his second series start for the White Stockings. A coin toss determined the first team to bat, with St. Louis winning the flip and sending Chicago up to the plate first.\nWith his effectiveness hindered by the necessity of pitching two days in a row, the Browns found themselves on their heels quickly when ace Bob Caruthers walked four of the first five batters, surrendering a second run on a base hit given up to third baseman Tom Burns of the Chicagos. The game was called after completion of eight innings due to darkness. John Clarkson was again on top of his game as the right hander struck out 8 Browns in earning his second win of the series. Caruthers took the loss for the Browns, giving Chicago a lead of two games to one in the series.\nThe Browns and their supporters were despondent over the loss and returned from Chicago to a station devoid of welcoming fans. Browns players were critical of player-manager Charlie Comiskey's decision to start Caruthers in back-to-back games, noting that Nat Hudson had been ready to start for the visitors until the last-minute decision was made to bring back the team's ace on zero rest. Star outfielder Tip O'Neill expressed the view that the pitching situation had been miserably managed and that the entire team had been put off by the decision not to rest Caruthers.\nGambling odds to win the series moved to 5:4 in favor of Chicago following the Browns' game 3 loss.\nGame 4.\nThursday, October 21, 1886 at Sportsman's Park in St. Louis, Missouri\nThe series moved to St. Louis on October 21, with Chicago ace John Clarkson pitching for the third time in four days. Clarkson was nothing if not durable, having won 53 games in 1885 to lead the National League — the second greatest number of wins by an individual pitcher in baseball history. It was necessity rather than design that forced Clarkson into back-to-back action during the World Series, however. Chicago's second pitcher, Jim McCormick, failed to make the trip due to a recurrence of \"rheumatism\" in his feet, an ailment which hampered his mobility and made participation impossible. Moreover, third Chicago pitcher Jocko Flynn, a 23-game winner, was already lost to the team for the year (and for his career) with arm trouble. In an effort to overcome the pitching deficit the team hurriedly signed a youthful 39-game winner from a minor league club in Duluth, Ward Baldwin, but the new addition to the team did not see action in the series.\nIt was not for the lack of trying that Baldwin was unavailable to fill the void left by McCormick's injury. Chicago manager Cap Anson intended to start the newcomer in game 4, but objection was made by Browns owner Chris von der Ahe, who declared there was an understanding that the World Series was a competition between the two teams which had won the championships of their respective leagues and that no additional players were to be used by either side. Chicago owner Albert Spalding remonstrated on behalf of the new addition to his stable and the two owners stormed off for speedy decision of the dispute by the board of umpires appointed for the series, a process specified by an earlier agreement between the teams. Three of the four umpires (two from each league) were located and it was determined that the matter should be left to the toss of a coin. The National League lost the flip and Baldwin was barred from the series.\nAfter the starting bell rang at 3:15 pm, the Chicagos managed to rack up a 3–0 lead in the top of the first inning with one hit, two walks, two errors, and a sacrifice fly. The Browns narrowed the margin with a run in the second inning on some astute base running by Bill Gleason, with another run notched in the third inning when Tip O'Neill tripled home a runner. The tide turned decisively in the fifth inning when starting pitcher John Clarkson, pitching a second consecutive game, began to run out of gas, giving up a two-run single to center by Gleason, followed by an RBI single by Browns first baseman Charlie Comiskey.\nThe White Stockings managed to get two runs back in the top in the sixth, powered by Abner Dalrymple's RBI triple to right field, followed by a base hit by Clarkson. The Browns put the game away for good with three more runs in the bottom half of the frame, however, with three walks, two singles, and a muffed fly ball doing the damage. The game was called after seven innings due to darkness, the series knotted at two games each. Chicago manager Cap Anson was angered by the decision to call the game after 7 innings, claiming that sufficient light remained to see the ball when the game was ended, but his plea went unheeded as the crowd of about 8,000 scurried for the exits.\nAfter the game losing pitcher John Clarkson acknowledged that \"They got away with me today, without the shadow of a doubt. I can't say anything, but they beat us all around... They just hit me and hit me hard.\" While losing pitcher Clarkson was sanguine about the defeat, team owner Spalding was enraged by the outcome, declaring to a newspaper reporter that his team had \"a perfect right\" to pitch new signee Ward Baldwin instead of the exhausted Clarkson and that the St. Louis owner \"had no business to interfere with me.\" He continued:\n\"Baldwin is as much a member of the Chicago Club as any man on it and we signed him for the season of 1886 \"(sic.)\" and 1887 as well. I am not at all satisfied with the result of today's business, and I think the action of Mr. Von der Ahe in the matter was unsportsmanlike and wrong, and if the loss of this game interferes with our winning the series, I think it would be only right to make some kind of a protest against it.\"\nGame 5.\nFriday, October 22, 1886 at Sportsman's Park in St. Louis, Missouri\nThe action returned to St. Louis on October 22 for game 5. Chicago manager Cap Anson attempted to start the game with Ned Baldwin in the pitcher's area, but the St. Louis crowd roared its disapproval and the Browns refused to play until Baldwin was removed. Forced to improvise in light of Chicago's lack of an alternate pitcher to John Clarkson, Anson trotted out shortstop Ned Williamson to make the start, only to see the hapless conscript knocked out of the box after giving up three hits and walk in the first inning, resulting in two runs. Right fielder Jimmy Ryan came in to relieve, showing himself a better pitcher than Williamson but nevertheless taking the loss as his teammates blundered away the game defensively.\nOne observer noted that \"the playing on both sides was very loose, the batting heavy, and the errors numerous,\" with the Chicagos playing a particularly \"wretched game both at the bat and in the field.\" Chicago right fielder Tom Burns committed two particularly costly errors, allowing runs to score, with Nat Hudson giving up only three hits en route to an easy 10–3 victory. Catcher Silver Flint contributed mightily to the carnage, allowing four runs to score on passed balls and making another costly throwing error to third base.\nThe game was called after 7 innings when it became too dark to see the ball. An estimated 16,000 fans were in attendance to witness the hometown Browns go up three games to two in the best-of-seven series.\nGame 6.\nSaturday, October 23, 1886 at Sportsman's Park in St. Louis, Missouri\nThe final game of the 1886 World Series took place in St. Louis on October 23 and proved to be a legendary affair. Bob Caruthers made his third pitching start for St. Louis, with John Clarkson returning to the mound for a fourth time for Chicago. Under threatening skies the White Stockings took a 2–0 lead into the fourth inning, when a brief rain shower prompted fans to leave the grandstand and run onto the field, demanding that the umpire call the game, thereby nullifying the result, because of inclement weather. Order was restored only with the assistance of a legion of police.\nA 3–0 Chicago lead held until a dramatic eighth-inning comeback by the Browns. Charlie Comiskey began the St. Louis half of the inning with a single to right field and was sent to third by a bunting Curt Welch, who managed to beat out the throw to first base, putting runners on the corners. Chicago infielder Tom Burns threw wildly to first in an effort to pick off Welch only to see the ball skip away and Comiskey score on the error, with Welch advancing to second. The home crowd erupted. Clarkson managed to collect two outs when Dave Foutz and Yank Robinson flew out, but he kept the inning alive with a walk of the hitter in the 9-spot, Doc Bushong, bringing the potential go-ahead run to the plate, leadoff hitting third baseman Arlie Latham.\nThe loud and abrasive Cap Anson had been riding Latham throughout the game when he was on the field from the third base coaching area, taunting him as a \"soft spot\" in the Browns' defense. Latham delivered his answer with his bat, hammering a long fly ball that was misjudged by outfielder Abner Dalrymple. Running on contact, both Welch and Bushong scored on the play, knotting the score at 3.\nNeither team scored in the 9th inning, sending the game to extra innings. Chicago similarly failed to score in their half of the 10th inning, but in the bottom half of the frame the Browns started a rally, with the Browns' Curt Welch advancing to third base. Clarkson wound up and threw a pitch that got past catcher King Kelly, with Welch coming home to win the game and the series for St. Louis. It is disputed whether or not Welch was forced to slide in scoring the winning run, but the event was memorialized as the \"$15,000 Slide\" nevertheless and became the most famous play in 19th century baseball.\nThere was contemporary disagreement as to whether the final play of the game was made possible by a passed ball or a wild pitch, with Chicago catcher King Kelly telling the press that he was willing to take the blame:\n\"I signaled Clarkson for a low ball on one side and when it came it was high up on the other. It struck my hand as I tried to get it, and I would say it was a passed ball. You can give it to me if you want to. Clarkson told me that it slipped from his hands.\"\nThe reporter of the \"Chicago Tribune\" differed with the official scoring decision, asserting that the all-important passed ball was \"really a wild pitch by Clarkson.\"\nRegardless of the intricacies of official scoring, the winning run excited the packed grandstand mightily, with fans remaining in their seats and cheering for fifteen minutes after the game was over, while hundreds of others stormed the Browns' locker room with congratulations.\nOverview.\nThe Browns' Tip O'Neill led all players with a .400 batting average, eight hits, and two home runs in the series. Welch had the second-highest batting average, at .350. Caruthers, who started three games for St. Louis, went 2–1 with a 2.42 earned run average. Clarkson started four games for Chicago and went 2–2 with a 2.03 ERA.\nThe Browns outhit the White Stockings in the series, scoring a total of 38 runs in the six games to 28 for their National League opponents. The Browns amassed a total of 64 hits, including 6 doubles, 8 triples, and 2 homers against a total of 52 hits for the White Stockings, who managed 13 extra-base hits, including 3 home runs.\nIt was agreed before the series that one half of total gate receipts would be distributed among the players, with the victors receiving the spoils on a winner-takes-all basis. All receipts were put into the bank in a joint account held by the team owners, with no disbursal of funds to take place until one team had won a majority of games in the 7-game series. A similar winner-takes-all allocation of the other half of the proceeds was made by the respective teams' owners. Total receipts for the series were $13,920.10, from which was first deducted the $100 salaries of the umpires and team travel expenses. The remaining funds were split in half between Browns players and team owner Chris Von der Ahe, with each player taking home slightly over $500.\nThe 1886 World Series was the American Association's only undisputed championship over the National League.\nBatting order.\nSt. Louis Browns\n1.

        "title": "2009 attack on the Sri Lanka national cricket team",
        "text": "The 2009 attack on the Sri Lanka national cricket team occurred on 3 March 2009, when a bus carrying Sri Lankan cricketers, part of a larger convoy, was fired upon by 12 gunmen near Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore, Pakistan. The cricketers were on their way to play the third day of the second Test against the Pakistani cricket team. Six members of the Sri Lanka national cricket team were wounded and six Pakistani policemen and two civilians were killed.\nThe attack was believed to have been carried out by the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi. In August 2016, three of the terrorists involved in the attack were killed during a police raid in Lahore. In October, the attack's mastermind was killed in eastern Afghanistan during a military operation, while hiding there.\nBackground of the tour.\nThe safety of touring cricket teams in Pakistan had long been an issue. In May 2002, New Zealand abandoned their Test series in Pakistan after a suicide bomb attack outside their hotel. However, they returned in the 2003/2004 season to fulfill their commitments. Australia had refused to tour in October 2002 on safety grounds. The Sri Lankan cricket team was in Pakistan as a replacement for the Indian team, who had pulled out after the Mumbai attacks. In order to persuade the Sri Lankan team to visit, the Pakistan government offered to give them presidential-style security. The series was the first Test tour of Pakistan since South Africa visited in October 2007.\nAttack.\nAccording to the officials, 12 gunmen were hiding near Liberty Square, in the centre of Lahore, waiting for the Sri Lankan team to pass on their way to the Gaddafi stadium. They started firing at the bus when it crossed the road. The Pakistan police escorting the team returned fire; in the ensuing fighting, six policemen and two civilians died. After about 20 minutes, the militants fled, leaving behind rocket launchers and grenades.\nThe gunmen first shot at the wheels of the bus, and then fired at the bus itself and its occupants. The attackers had fired a rocket at the bus, which missed and hit a nearby electric pole. The driver of the bus, Mehar Mohammad Khalil, had then kept on driving a distance of about until they reached the stadium. Khalil was awarded Tamgha-i-Shujaat for his bravery. The attackers had also thrown a grenade under the bus, which exploded after the bus had passed over it.\nA minivan following the team bus carrying the match referee and umpires was also fired upon and the driver was killed. Simon Taufel, Steve Davis, Nadeem Ghauri, Ahsan Raza, umpires performance manager Peter Manuel, liaison officer Abdul Sami and ICC match referee Chris Broad were in this minivan. The minivan was subsequently allegedly abandoned by security personnel and no bullets were fired by the security forces for twenty minutes. Chris Broad threw himself over and kept his hand on the chest of Ahsan Raza to slow down the profuse bleeding from a bullet injury. A police officer who climbed into the minivan to seek cover drove the minivan to safety.\nSecurity cameras captured footage of several gunmen carrying automatic weapons and backpacks, firing on the convoy from the Liberty Square roundabout. They were later seen jogging up the street and escaping on motorcycles. The video was broadcast around the world presenting pictures of the attacks.\nCCTV footage has been made public. They arrived at 8:39 am local time and left at 8:46 am. The attackers were armed with AK-47 assault rifles, hand grenades, RPG launchers, claymores and explosive charges.\nThe Sri Lankan team were then taken to the stadium and airlifted from the pitch via Pakistan Air Force Mil Mi-17 helicopters, and immediate arrangements were made for the Sri Lankan team to return to Colombo on the next available flight. The second Test, which was the last scheduled fixture of the tour, was abandoned as a draw.\nInjuries.\nSeveral team members sustained minor wounds, including:\nSix Pakistani policemen and two civilians were killed in the attack.\nSamaraweera and Paranavitana were hospitalised following the incident. The others had sustained minor injuries and shrapnel wounds. Samaraweera sustained shrapnel wounds to his thigh, and Paranavitana to his chest. The team's Assistant Coach Paul Farbrace was also injured. Although it was reported that Coach Trevor Bayliss also sustained minor injuries, it was later announced that this was incorrect.\nReserve umpire Ahsan Raza, who was travelling in a van for the umpires that was following the Sri Lankan team bus, was shot twice and taken to hospital. The driver of the minibus was killed in the attack.\nInvestigation and attribution.\nImmediately following the attacks, Pakistani authorities blamed the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), a militant organisation. Pakistani officials said that the attacks were similar to the Mumbai attacks. Most of the Pakistani press blamed Pakistani Islamist militants and Al-Qaeda for the attacks. Police said that kidnapping was a possible motive, but police officials refused to comment on this.\nSri Lankan Foreign Minister Rohitha Bogollagama said on 4 March that he could not rule out involvement of the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in the Lahore attacks. Some European intelligence sources supported this suspicion. Sri Lankan military officials, on the other hand, were skeptical of LTTE involvement, and an LTTE spokesperson labelled reports of LTTE connection as 'not true'. A junior Pakistani cabinet minister said that the government had evidence that the attackers came from India. On 6 March 2009, government officials had ruled out the involvement of Indian intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing and LTTE and were zeroing in on Lashkar-e-Taiba.\nOn the morning of the attack, the Sri Lankan and Pakistani cricket teams did not depart from the hotel together, as they had done on previous days, and the Pakistani team's schedule was delayed by 5 minutes. Statements by Australian umpire Simon Taufel, match referee Chris Broad, and spin bowler Muttiah Muralitharan, referencing this delay sparked conspiracy theories that the militants were acting on inside information. Later, Muralitharan expressed alarm at such interpretations of his comments and explained that he only suspected the gunmen to be monitoring the team movements.\nFederal Bureau of Investigation director Robert Mueller arrived in Pakistan the day after these attacks and met with Pakistani officials to discuss security issues and the Mumbai attacks.\nInterior Adviser Rehman Malik, told the National Assembly Standing Committee on the Interior that no evidence of LeT's involvement has been found so far, and that sufficient evidence has been surfaced pointing to involvement of a foreign hand.\nSecurity lapse.\nThe Investigation committee found three Superintendents of police (SPs) to have neglected the initial warning. by Intelligence agencies The Chief Minister of Punjab had also tipped off the authorities about a possible threat to the Sri Lankan team a month before.\nArrests.\nOn 5 March, Salmaan Taseer, the governor of Punjab province, said the individuals responsible for the attack had been identified, but would not be revealed until the investigation was complete. The province offered a reward of 10 million rupees (US$125,000) for information leading to the capture of the militants responsible for the attack.\nPolice in Punjab arrested over 250 suspects, including 4 who were said to be 'prime suspects'. Police called Muhammad Aqeel, who ran a sports bikes business in Islampura, the mastermind behind the attack, and said that he had received a call from one of the militants at 9:05 am on the morning of the attacks asking for instructions. Though Aqeel was still absconding, his brother, Muhammad Faisal, had been arrested. Police also arrested Shahzad Babar of Rahim Yar Khan after a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card registered in his name was used in the attack along with eight others.\nSecurity officials in Pakistan told The Times that most of the two dozen people arrested in connection with the attacks belonged to Jaish-e-Mohammed, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, outlawed militant groups with close links to Al-Qaeda. Aqeel, who is an activist of Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, escaped a police raid on his home in Kahuta on 9 March 2009.\nAlso another gunman Zubair, aka Naik Mohammad, of Zubair, was arrested from Madina Colony, Walton Road in Lahore. He was a waiter at a hotel in Rawalpindi, when he was recruited by Sifullah. He went to Miram Shah and was trained in the use of different weapons.\nOther accused including Samiullah, alias Ejaz of Nankana district, Adnan, alias Sajjad, Ajmal alias Ahsaan, Farooq, Ameer of Punjab Taliban, and Umer, alias Abdul Wahab of D. I. Khan, were still at large.\nThe attack was planned at Tauheed Hotel, and a house rented for this purpose in Madina Colony, Walton Road. The auto rickshaws used in the attack were purchased by Samiullah.\nA secret investigative report has surfaced later prepared by the Additional Inspector General of the Crime Investigation Division, Punjab on 22 January 2009 outlining the potential threat to the Sri Lankan team.\nReactions.\nPakistan and Sri Lanka.\n – The attack was condemned by the Pakistani president Asif Ali Zardari and prime minister Yousaf Raza Gillani. Governor Salmaan Taseer stated that the same people who executed the 2008 Mumbai attacks were responsible for this attack. Following the attack, Pakistan's interior minister Rehman Malik declared Pakistan to be \"in a state of war\". Pakistani officials also blamed India of covert involvement, citing long-standing enmity between the two South Asian countries. These claims were largely seen as an exercise in diverting attention away from the crisis.\nChief Minister of Punjab (Pakistan) Shehbaz Sharif criticised the current government and said that he had already tipped authorities of a possible attack beforehand.\nPakistani newspaper \"Dawn\" condemned the attack and cited security loopholes.\nThe \"Daily Times\", blamed Al-Qaeda and the Lashkar-e Jhangvi in an editorial, stating, \"International cricket is no longer possible in Pakistan; therefore we should stop accusing foreign teams of discriminating against Pakistan vis-à-vis India. The question here is of the survival of Pakistan, not of cricket.\" The \"Daily Jang\", responding on Chris Broad, Simon Taufel and Steve Davis's comments, said that their \"vivid description of the terrifying attack gives us an insight into how people everywhere will see the events of the morning of March 3.\" It went on to say the \"men appeared genuinely shocked over the sight of Pakistani security men running for cover\". The paper goes on to say that \"their candid comments will seal the fate of Pakistan cricket for some time to come\". It also said that Pakistan \"must give up complaining\" and that \"ways to liven up the game at the domestic level need to be reconsidered with renewed urgency\".\n – Sri Lankan president Mahinda Rajapaksa said, \"I condemn this cowardly terrorist attack targeting the Sri Lankan cricket team. The Sri Lankan players had gone to Pakistan as ambassadors of goodwill.\" Prime Minister Ratnasiri Wickremanayake said that \"Sri Lanka and Pakistan share a very close relationship and we will take all steps to protect this relationship.\" The driver of the bus whose presence of mind saved the cricketers was hailed as a hero. The Sri Lankan team praised the bus driver. Then-captain of the Sri Lanka cricket team Mahela Jayawardene praised Khalil saying he owed his life to the driver. Spinner Muttiah Muralitharan also gave Khalil his team shirt.\nOthers.\n – Secretary General Ban Ki-moon strongly condemned the attacks according to UN spokesman Marie Okabe. She also added that \"Any attack targeting civilians, in this case athletes, is despicable and unjustifiable, and we urge authorities in Pakistan to do all in their power to find the culprits and bring them to justice.\"\nThe International Cricket Council – Chief Executive Haroon Lorgat said:\nWe note with dismay and regret the events of this morning in Lahore and we condemn this attack without reservation. It is a source of great sadness that there have been a number of fatalities in this attack and it is also very upsetting for the wider cricket family that some of the Sri Lanka players and one match official have been injured in this attack. At this time our thoughts and prayers are with the injured people and also the families of those who have died.\nThe West Indies Cricket Board made a statement through president Julian Hunte and said \"It was a sad day for International Cricket\", and gave their full sympathy to the Sri Lankan players and the umpires.\nIndian and New Zealand players wore black armbands while playing their next One Day International as a show of solidarity towards the Sri Lankan players injured in the attack, as did Australia and South Africa while playing their next test.\nOther countries.\n – Prime Minister Kevin Rudd also condemned the attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team, calling it \"shameful and cowardly\". He demanded answers from Pakistan after claims that police left Australians travelling with Sri Lanka's cricket team in the lurch as the bus was attacked. \"I am sufficiently concerned about what has been said by the Australians that we need an explanation and we intend to get one.\" Foreign Minister Stephen Smith said the attack demonstrates that there is a persistent threat to Pakistan's very existence and showed the need for a tougher war against extremists.\n – Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said that the Chinese government expressed deep condolences to the victims and sincere sympathy to the wounded.\n – French Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs expressed solidarity with the Pakistani people and authorities at this \"testing time\".\n – Home Minister P. Chidambaram expressed shock over the attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team in Pakistan: \"We condemn the incident. We are sorry for the Sri Lankan team. We hope that the players ... I read two, three names ... Samaraweera, Mendis ... I hope they are safe and will recover. We are shocked by that incident.\" Further he said that Pakistan could become a failed state and it was not clear who was in control of the country.\n - Prime Minister John Key was outraged over the attack. He called it a \"despicable terrorist act\" while condemning the attack. He further said that he intends to convey \"a message of condolence to the Sri Lankan Government and Sri Lankan cricket team\".\n – Foreign Minister Ali Babacan called Pakistan's Foreign Minister Makhdoom Shah Mehmood Qureshi and offered his condolences personally and on behalf of the government and the people of Turkey.\n – Prime Minister Gordon Brown, commenting on the attacks, said that Pakistan must clamp down on such perpetrators in its midst and said that a vast majority of Al-Qaeda fighters were in Pakistan, adding the government must make arrests to show it is \"fulfilling its role in the world community\". Foreign Secretary David Miliband stated that Pakistan was facing a \"mortal threat\" from internal militancy.\n – President Barack Obama expressed deep concern over the attack. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called these attacks an \"eerie replica\" of the Mumbai attacks and said Pakistan was facing a serious internal security threat. Ambassador to Afghanistan Christopher Dell mused that Pakistan potentially posed a bigger security problem for the rest of the world than Afghanistan.\nCriticism.\nPolitician and former Pakistan cricket captain Imran Khan criticised the security arrangements and said that the security provided was 10 times less than what is provided to government officials such as Rehman Malik.\nMatch referee Chris Broad was also critical of the security provided. He stated that he and his colleagues were left like 'sitting ducks' in the trailing minivan during the attack. He also accused the security personnel of fleeing the scene. He questioned why the Pakistan team which usually travelled with the Sri Lankan team was delayed by seven minutes that day and avoided being attacked. Javed Miandad was critical of Broad's comments and demanded that International Cricket Council ban him for life. Pakistan Cricket Board lodged a formal complaint against Chris Broad with the International Cricket Council on 9 March 2009. Ijaz Butt, the head of Pakistan Cricket Board accused Broad of lying. Umpire Simon Taufel also said that the umpire's minibus was abandoned while the players' bus was moved to the ground to evacuate the players. Criticising the security entourage for abandoning them and inability of the police to arrest the attackers Simon said, \"You tell me why no one was caught. You tell me why. Supposedly 25 armed commandos were in our convoy, and when the team bus got going again, we were left on our own.\"\nCo-umpire Steve Davis said \"he felt let down\" by the security. International Cricket Council umpires performance manager for East Asia, Sri Lanka and Pakistan, Peter Manuel told \"Dawn\" that the minivan carrying the umpires was basically abandoned by the security personnel: \"It was unbelievable. Bullets were raining on us and not a shot was fired in our defense by the Pakistan security officials.\" Sri Lanka coach Trevor Bayliss backed the comments made by Simon Taufel, Chris Broad and Steve Davis criticising the security. Intikhab Alab, Pakistan cricket team's coach, asked Chris Broad to apologise to his country and team due to the remarks he made against Pakistani police security. English cricketer Dominic Cork who was commentating in Pakistan on the series and who himself was caught in the attack later criticised the security and Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Ijaz Butt.\nSri Lankan bowler Muttiah Muralitharan said the security arrangement was the worst he had ever seen, and vastly inferior to that provided in Sri Lanka. He said \"The security people we had didn't even seem to fight back. Were they professionals with enough training? They didn't seem to know what to do. I was surprised the terrorists were able to just reload the magazines and keep firing, and they never got caught. It was shameful. If this had happened in Colombo they would never have got away.\"\nEyewitness Habib Akram, bureau chief of SAMAA TV news channel, said that the gunmen were very calm as they moved and fired by turns and that there was hardly any fire returned by the police. His office overlooks the traffic circle where the incident took place. Closed-circuit television footage of the event reported by Geo TV showed four of the attackers walking or jogging away unchallenged from the site, into a marketplace while no policemen are seen.\nFormer president and former army chief Pervez Musharraf criticised the police commandos inability to kill any of the gunmen, saying \"If this was the elite force I would expect them to have shot down those people who attacked them, the reaction, their training should be on a level that if anyone shoots toward the company they are guarding, in less than three seconds they should shoot the man down.\" Inspite the ICC umpires, referee and Sri Lankan team heavily criticized Pakistani police and security services present on the attack site for their incompetence, Governor of Punjab province where the attack took place in Pakistan, gave medals and awards to honour valour and bravery of police officials for fighting the terrorists during the attack, which was met with severe controversy and described as \"ironic\".\nAftermath.\nInsurance cost for cricket matches in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka rose.\nThe New Zealand team cancelled its December 2009 tour of Pakistan. Bangladesh also put off a scheduled tour by Pakistan to Bangladesh.\nThe Union Home Minister of India, P. Chidambaram, said that the Indian Premier League should consider postponing the forthcoming T20 league matches due to be held over 45 days from 10 April to 24 May 2009 in 9 Indian cities, since in the light of these attacks, security forces would be stretched too thin between the league matches and the five phases of the forthcoming general elections in India. The elections were slated to be held between 16 April and 13 May and it was impossible to reschedule them while IPL organizers appeared to be unwilling to postpone the tournament. Former England coach Duncan Fletcher said that English players contracted to the IPL would now be more concerned for their safety. The 2009 Indian Premier League was hosted by South Africa between 18 April and 24 May 2009. Former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly said after these attacks Pakistan was not a safe venue to play cricket.\nThe 2011 Cricket World Cup was to be co-hosted by Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, but in the wake of this attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team the International Cricket Council (ICC) stripped Pakistan of its hosting rights due to security concerns. The headquarters of the organising committee were originally situated in Lahore, but was then shifted to Mumbai. Pakistan was supposed to hold 14 matches, including one semi-final. Eight of Pakistan's matches were awarded to India, four to Sri Lanka and two to Bangladesh.\nThe Sri Lankan Foreign minister has said the Sri Lankan cricket team \"will give highest consideration to the invitation extended to it to undertake visit again. Sri Lanka will not allow Pakistan's isolation in cricket.\" In October 2017, the Sri Lankan cricket team returned to Pakistan for the first time since the attack to play a Twenty20 International match at the Gaddafi Stadium. In September 2019, the Sri Lankan team toured Pakistan, playing a 3-match One-Day International series in National Stadium, Karachi and a 3-match Twenty20 International series in Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore.\nIn December 2019, Sri Lanka agreed to play two match test series in Pakistan, thus marking test cricket's return to Pakistan after a decade since the terror attack."

        "text": "The DePaul Blue Demons men's basketball program is the NCAA Division I intercollegiate men's basketball program of DePaul University in Chicago, Illinois. The team competes in the Big East Conference. DePaul's last NCAA tournament victory was in 2004. DePaul's NCAA tournament record since the end of the 1991–92 season is 1–2, spanning the last 30 tournaments played.\nThe Blue Demons play home games at Wintrust Arena at the McCormick Place convention center on Chicago's Near South Side.\nHistory.\nDePaul was an independent from 1923 to 1991. It joined the Great Midwest Conference in 1991 which later merged with the Metro Conference in 1995 to become Conference USA, in which DePaul was a member through 2005. DePaul left for the Big East Conference in 2005 and was a member until 2012 when it joined the reconfigured Big East in 2013.\nEarly history (1923–1942).\nRobert L. Stevenson was the first head coach in DePaul basketball history. In his one season as coach during the 1923–24 season, he coached the Blue Demons to a record of 8–6. Harry Adams was head coach for the 1924–25 season and finished with a record of 6–13. Eddie Anderson was head coach from 1925 to 1929 and compiled an overall record of 37–26.\nIn 1929, Jim Kelly became head coach at DePaul where he compiled a record of 99–22 in his 7 seasons as coach before leaving in 1936. Tom Haggerty coached DePaul from 1936 to 1940 and compiled an overall record of 63–32. Bill Wendt coached DePaul for 2 seasons from 1940 to 1941 and had a record of 23–20.\nRay Meyer era (1942–1984).\nNaismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame head coach Ray Meyer coached at DePaul for 42 years from 1942 to 1984 and finished with an overall 724–354 record (.672). He coached his team's to 21 post-season appearances (13 NCAA, eight NIT). Meyer led his teams to two Final Four appearances in the 1943 NCAA basketball tournament and 1979 NCAA Division I basketball tournament. Meyer's 1943 Final Four appearance was his first season coaching DePaul. His teams were a No. 1 seed in its NCAA regional three years in a row in 1980, 1981 and 1982; however, those teams all lost their first game to #8 seeds in upsets. Meyer led DePaul past Bowling Green to capture the 1945 National Invitation Tournament, the school's only post-season title. In total, Meyer recorded 37 winning seasons and twelve 20-win seasons, including seven straight from 1978 to 1984.\nMeyer coached George Mikan who was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1959, made the 25th and 35th NBA Anniversary Teams of 1970 and 1980, and was elected one of the NBA's 50 Greatest Players ever in 1996. On October 21, 2021, it was also announced that Mikan had made the NBA 75th Anniversary Team. Meyer also coached the 1980 Naismith College Player of the Year, Mark Aguirre.\nDuring Ray Meyer's tenure, the Blue Demons originally played in University Auditorium before moving to Alumni Hall in 1956. For the start of the 1980 season, DePaul men's basketball moved to the Rosemont Horizon later renamed Allstate Arena.\nJoey Meyer era (1984–1997).\nJoey Meyer was head coach of DePaul from 1984 to 1997 compiling an overall record of 231–158. He started as an assistant coach at DePaul for eleven seasons under his father, Ray Meyer. When Ray Meyer retired in 1984, Joey Meyer was promoted to head coach.\nJoey Meyer led DePaul to seven NCAA Tournament appearances in his first eight seasons, including back-to-back Sweet Sixteen appearances in his second and third seasons. In the 1986 tournament, #12-seeded DePaul—led by freshman guard Rod Strickland (14.1 ppg season average) and junior Dallas Comegys (13.8 ppg) -- upset #5-seeded Virginia and #4-seeded Oklahoma in the East regional before losing to top-seeded Duke 74–67. In 1987, the Blue Demons—again led by Comegys (17.5 ppg) and Strickland (16.3 ppg) -- finished the regular season 26–2 and received a #3 seed in the Midwest regional of the 1987 tournament. They defeated #14-seeded Louisiana Tech and #6-seeded St. John's before losing to #10-seeded LSU. Meyer was honored as the Chevrolet Coach of the Year in 1987. Besides seven NCAA tournament appearances, Meyer led the Blue Demons to three appearances in the National Invitation Tournament.\nIn both 1988 and 1989, DePaul reached the second round of the NCAA tournament, but they were on a downward trajectory. In 1992, the Blue Demons were co-champions of the newly formed Great Midwest Conference but made their last NCAA tournament appearance under Meyer. In 1996, they finished 11–18, their first losing season since 1971, and the next year, a young DePaul team finished 3–23. Meyer was dismissed on April 28, 1997.\nPat Kennedy era (1997–2002).\nPat Kennedy was named head coach after Joey Meyer. It was the first time a member of the Meyer family hadn't coached DePaul basketball in 55 years. Kennedy coached DePaul from 1997 to 2002 and finished with an overall record of 67–85.\nDave Leitao era – First tenure (2002–2005).\nDave Leitao was named head coach at DePaul for the 2002–03 season. His teams made post-season play in all three of his seasons as head coach. In his second season, his team advanced to the second round of the 2004 NCAA tournament before being eliminated by eventual national champion Connecticut. His teams also played in the 2003 and 2005 NIT Tournaments. In his first stint as head coach at Depaul, he finished with a 58–34 overall record. Leitao left to become the head coach at the University of Virginia in 2005.\nJerry Wainwright era (2005–2010).\nJerry Wainwright was named DePaul head coach in 2005. In his first season he finished with a 12–15 record. In his second season in 2006–07, the Blue Demons beat #5 Kansas, pulling off one of the greatest upsets in school history. They also beat 2006 NCAA tournament teams California, Northwestern State, Marquette, Connecticut and Villanova with Wainwright leading the Blue Demons to the 2007 National Invitation Tournament quarterfinals before losing to Air Force. Four games into the 2007–08 season, Wainwright logged his 200th career win as a head coach, but the team finished with a 10–19 record. The 2008–2009 season saw DePaul finish 9–24 overall and 0–18 in regular season Big East play. Wainwright began the 2009–10 season as head coach, but was fired on January 11, 2010, after a 7–8 start to the season. He still had two years remaining on his contract at the time of his firing. Wainwright finished with a 59–80 overall record in his five years at DePaul. Assistant coach Tracy Webster was named interim head coach for the remainder of the 2009–10 season and finished with a 1–15 record.\nOliver Purnell era (2010–2015).\nOn April 6, 2010, Oliver Purnell, formerly of Clemson University signed a seven-year deal with DePaul. In his first season in 2010–11, Purnell finished with a record of 7–24. The rest of his tenure saw his teams with finish with similar records of 12–19 during the 2011–2012 season, 11–21 during the 2012–2013 season, 12–21 during the 2013–2014 season and 12–20 in 2014–15. At the conclusion of the 2014–2015 season, Purnell announced his resignation. He finished with an overall record of 54–105 at DePaul.\nDave Leitao era – Second tenure (2015–2021).\nDave Leitao returned for his second stint as DePaul head basketball coach for the 2015–2016 season. The team finished with a record of 9–22 in his first season back with the Blue Demons. The 2016–2017 season saw the Blue Demons finish with a 9–23 record in Leitao's second season. This season would be DePaul's last season playing at Allstate Arena in Rosemont, Illinois after 37 years at the venue. For the 2017–2018 season, the Blue Demons moved back to Chicago to play their home games at 10,387-seat Wintrust Arena at the McCormick Place convention center. The first season at Wintrust Arena saw the Blue Demons return to double-digit wins finishing with a record of 11–20 in Leitao's third season.\nFollowing the 2017–2018 season, DePaul's eleventh straight losing season under coaches hired by current Athletic Director Jean Lenti Ponsetto, a group of \"concerned students and alumni\" purchased a full-page advertisement in the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" calling for change within the school's Athletic Department. Additional reasons the students and alumni wanted change was that since the 1989–90 season, DePaul had won only one NCAA tournament game in the 29 seasons that transpired. DePaul had also only been to two NCAA Tournaments since the 1991–92 season, hadn't qualified for the NCAA Tournament since the 2003–04 season and the Blue Demons had not made postseason play since 2006–07. Additionally, DePaul finished last in the Big East eight out of the past ten seasons including a tie for last place during the 2017–18 season.\nThe 2018–2019 season saw a turnaround for DePaul as the Blue Demons finished with a 19–17 overall record. In Leitao's fourth season, he led the Blue Demons to the 2019 College Basketball Invitational post-season tournament. The team finished as runner-up to the University of South Florida Bulls. In the Best of Three Championship series, DePaul beat South Florida in game 2, but dropped games one and three to the Bulls to give DePaul a second-place finish in the tournament.\nTony Stubblefield era – (2021–2024).\nOn April 1, 2021, Tony Stubblefield was hired as head coach. He previously served as an assistant coach at Oregon. Stubblefield was fired on January 22, 2024. Assistant coach Matt Brady served as the interim head coach for the remainder of the 2024 season.\nChris Holtmann era - (2024–present).\nOn March 14, 2024, former Ohio State head coach Chris Holtmann was hired as the new head coach.\nChampionships.\nFinal Fours.\nDePaul has played in two Final Fours in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament.

        "text": "CBS has occasionally broadcast boxing events; its first broadcast occurred in 1948. The network's most recent broadcasts of the sport have fallen under Al Haymon's \"Premier Boxing Champions\" banner, and its most recent primetime broadcasts have been produced by sister pay television channel Showtime.\nHistory.\nCBS' earliest experience with boxing dates back to 1948 with the debut of \"Pabst Blue Ribbon Bouts\". The program, featuring blow-by-blow commentator Russ Hodges, lasted through 1955.\nCBS had a renewed interest in boxing after losing the National Football Conference package to Fox following the 1993 season. In 1994, they had a new series of fights on Saturday or Sundays under the \"Eye on Sports\" banner. Tim Ryan (blow-by-blow) and Gil Clancy (color) were the commentators during this period. CBS continued airing boxing on a somewhat regular basis until 1998, by which time they had the NFL (after acquiring the American Football Conference package from NBC) and college football back on their slate.\nOn the afternoon of December 15, 2012, as part of a larger marathon of live boxing events being broadcast that day by sister premium network Showtime, CBS broadcast \"Showtime Boxing on CBS\"—which featured a main event between Leo Santa Cruz and Alberto Guevara from Los Angeles. The telecast, although delayed due to an overrunning college basketball game, was seen by approximately 1.5 million households. It marked the first live broadcast of a boxing event on CBS since 1997.\nIn February 2015, CBS Sports reached a deal with Al Haymon's \"Premier Boxing Champions\" to air a series of eight, Saturday afternoon cards (branded as \"PBC on CBS\"). CBS Sports Network also aired shoulder programming for Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao. In 2016, CBS Sports Network began to pick up a larger number of events from smaller promoters such as Roy Jones Jr. and Pep Gomez.\nOn June 25, 2016, as part of \"PBC\", CBS broadcast Showtime-produced coverage of a card featuring a WBC welterweight championship fight between Keith Thurman and Shawn Porter, marking the first boxing event broadcast on CBS in primetime since 1978. The following March, CBS aired Thurman's welterweight unification bout against Danny García.\nNotable moments.\nAngelo Dundee, Muhammad Ali's trainer, was brought in to be Sugar Ray Leonard's trainer and manager. Long-time coaches Janks Morton, Dave Jacobs and lawyer Mike Trainer made up the rest of Leonard's team. Promoted by ABC-TV as their replacement for the aging Ali, Leonard made $40,000 for his first professional fight (then a record) against Puerto Rican Luis Vega. The fight was televised nationally on CBS-TV, and the novice Leonard won by a 6-round unanimous decision.\nFor decades, from the 1920s to the 1980s, world championship matches in professional boxing were scheduled for fifteen rounds, but that changed after a November 13, 1982 WBA Lightweight title bout ended with the death of boxer Kim Duk-koo in a fight against Ray Mancini in the 14th round of a nationally televised championship fight on CBS. Exactly three months after the fatal fight, the WBC reduced the number of their championship fights to 12 rounds. It was also the last fight to air as part of strike replacement programming on CBS because of the NFL strike, which ended three days later.\nA then 14-0 Oscar De La Hoya appeared on a December 10, 1994 card for CBS.\nThe last time CBS aired a live boxing event prior to 2012, was on January 20, 1997, when then-middleweight champion Bernard Hopkins knocked out Glen Johnson in the 11th round."

        "title": "Coastal Athletic Association Men's Basketball Player of the Year",
        "text": "The Coastal Athletic Association Men's Basketball Player of the Year (formerly the Colonial Athletic Association Men's Basketball Player of the Year) is an award given to the Coastal Athletic Association's most outstanding player. The award was first given following the 1982–83 season, when the conference was known as the ECAC South basketball league. In 1985, the conference expanded to offer more sports, and became the Colonial Athletic Association; the conference name was changed to Coastal Athletic Association in 2023.\nThe first award, the only tie, was given to Dan Ruland of James Madison and Carlos Yates of George Mason. Two different players have won the award three times. David Robinson of Navy won in 1984, 1985, and 1986. George Evans won in 1999, 2000, and 2001 while playing for George Mason. Evans' first award in 1999 was as a 28-year-old sophomore—he had served seven years in the United States Army, seeing combat in Somalia, Bosnia, and Desert Storm. Steve Hood of James Madison, Odell Hodge of Old Dominion, Brett Blizzard of UNC Wilmington, Eric Maynor of VCU, Charles Jenkins of Hofstra, Jerrelle Benimon of Towson, Justin Wright-Foreman of Hofstra and Aaron Estrada of Hofstra have each won the award twice.\nHofstra has the most all-time awards with nine and most individual recipients with six. Since July 2022, it is the only one of the five schools with the most awards to still be in the conference. George Mason (six winners) left for the Atlantic 10 in 2013. James Madison, Old Dominion and VCU have each had four winners; James Madison left for the Sun Belt Conference in 2022, Old Dominion left for Conference USA in 2013, and VCU left for the A-10 in 2012. Navy's three wins by Robinson were won while the team was a conference member for just nine years. Another charter member, Richmond, won three awards before leaving the conference in 2001. Other original members to leave, American and East Carolina, each have one recipient. Of the conference's current members, William &amp; Mary went the longest without its first winner. In 2015, 32 years after the award was first handed out, Marcus Thornton claimed William &amp; Mary's first ever CAA Player of the Year honor.\nWinners by school.\nThe CAA began in 1982 when it was known as the ECAC South. The CAA was officially organized in 1985 when it expanded from only a basketball conference. Awards from the ECAC are included.\nYears of joining reflect the calendar year in which each school joined the CAA or ECAC South."

        "title": "1926 Italian Grand Prix",
        "text": "The 1926 Italian Grand Prix was a Grand Prix motor race held at Monza on 5 September 1926.\nThe cars were divided into two classes, which raced simultaneously but over a different distance. The longer race, which was also the final race of the 1926 AIACR World Manufacturers' Championship season, was contested by 1.5-litre Grand Prix cars over 60 laps, while the shorter race was for up to 1.1 litre cyclecars, and held over 40 laps. Like the other races in the 1926 season, the Italian Grand Prix was quite dull, with just two cars running after the cyclecars had finished their race.\nReport.\nCostantini's Bugatti took the lead early, with the other two Bugattis battling with the two Maseratis over the first two laps, the gap between second and fifth place just 5 seconds after the first lap, with the Chiribiri of Serboli down the field with the 1100cc cars. After just four laps, Maserati retired with engine failure, followed one lap later by team-mate Materassi, also with engine failure, leaving just the three Bugattis and the lone struggling Chiribiri in the 1500cc class.\nThe Chiribiri of Serboli eventually retired after 27 laps in a spectacular fire in the otherwise dull race. Goux and Sabipa swapped positions a few times mostly due to pitstops, but Goux ultimately retired after 36 laps. Once the cyclecars had finished their 40 laps, the two remaining Bugattis continued uneventfully until nearly the end of the race. However, on his 58th lap, Costantini, who had totally dominated the race experienced engine trouble, but was able to crawl around to the pits. Although he lost the lead to Sabipa, he was able to finish the race on just three (of eight) cylinders."

        "title": "UCI Track Cycling World Championships – Women's omnium",
        "text": "The Women's omnium at the UCI Track Cycling World Championships was first contested in 2009 in Poland.\nThe format of the multi-race endurance event (\"Omnium\" coming from the Latin \"Omnia\", for all) has evolved rapidly since its introduction in 2009. In its first iteration, the competition consisted of 5 events over a single day; a 'flying lap', a time trial over 200 metres with a rolling start, a scratch race, an individual pursuit time trial, a points race, and a 500 metre time trial. Riders were awarded points to match their placing in each event (1 for 1st, 2 for 2nd, etc) and the lowest cumulative score won the competition, with tie-breaks broken by cumulative times in the timed elements of the race.\nIn 2011, the competition was extended to six events: a 250m flying start time trial; a 5 km scratch race; an elimination race or 'Devil'; an individual pursuit; a 10 km points race; and a 500m time trial. Again, the placing a rider achieved in each event is converted to points, and the rider with the fewest points at the end of the competition won.\nIn 2015 the order and scoring of the events changed. The points race was moved to the finale event, and the five earlier events allowed riders to win points (with a maximum of 40 for 1st place) to carry into the final points race, whereupon points won in that race were simply added to the total, with the highest scoring rider (carried points included) at the end of that race declared the winner of the event.\nIn 2017 the first major change of events since 2011 took place, as the three timed elements were removed entirely, and a new fourth event the tempo race introduced. The format of carrying points over from the first three events into the final points race was maintained.\nSix cyclists have won the title more than once, taking two gold medals each: Laura Trott and Katie Archibald, both of Great Britain, Tara Whitten of Canada, Sarah Hammer and Jennifer Valente of the United States, Kirsten Wild of the Netherlands in 2012 &amp; 2016, 2017 &amp; 2021, 2010 &amp; 2011, 2013 &amp; 2014, 2022 &amp; 2023, and 2018 &amp; 2019 respectively. Trott's three silver medals to Wild's one silver and two bronze medals makes Laura Trott, now Laura Kenny, marginally the most successful athlete overall in the history of the event. Along with Katie Archibald's 2017 and 2021 gold medals and Lizzie Armistead's silver, it also makes Great Britain the most successful nation in the event."
