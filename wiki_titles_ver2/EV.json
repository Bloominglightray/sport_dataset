        "title": "2013 IIHF World Championship final",
        "text": "The 2013 IIHF World Championship final was played at the Ericsson Globe in Stockholm, Sweden, on 19 May 2013 between Sweden and Switzerland. The game determined the winners of the 2013 IIHF World Championship, with Sweden winning 5–1.\nBackground.\nThis was Sweden's fifth final of the 21st century (their most recent final occurred in 2011), as well as the team's tenth final in history (discounting years when champions were determined through round-robins). Sweden had previously won eight gold medals. This was the first time a host nation qualified for the final since 2008, when Canada qualified for the final.\nThis was Switzerland's first final in history. Switzerland had previously won one silver medal (1935) and eight bronze medals, the most recent one in 1953. Switzerland was the only team in the tournament to go undefeated before the final, winning all nine games with one victory coming through a shootout.\nSweden and Switzerland faced each other in the semifinals in 1992 and 1998, with Sweden winning both times, but this was the first final between the two teams. The Swiss team won the preliminary round game against Sweden 3–2.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nSwitzerland took early control of the game, and five minutes in, rushing defenceman Roman Josi opened the scoring with a backhand shot that went five-hole on Swedish goaltender Jhonas Enroth. After eight minutes of play, the Swiss had outshot the Swedes 8–0. Sweden regrouped and turned the game around in a three-minute span. At 8:42, Erik Gustafsson scored his first goal of the tournament to tie the game on a rebound in front of the net. Two minutes later, Sweden got a power play following a \"checking to the head\" penalty to Andres Ambühl, and at 11:38 Henrik Sedin scored to put Sweden ahead 2–1. Switzerland received a bench minor two minutes later for \"too many players on the ice\", but the Swedes did not convert on the ensuing power play. The first period ended 2–1 in Sweden's favor.\nThe second period was scoreless and very even, featuring excellent play from Jhonas Enroth and Switzerland's goaltender Martin Gerber. The period featured one tripping penalty to Sweden at 32:01, and one hooking penalty to Switzerland at 39:10, but neither team managed to score any goals.\nTwo minutes into the third period, Switzerland received another power play from an interference penalty to Sweden but would pay for their lost chance to tie the game. At 47:13, Sweden's Simon Hjalmarsson scored on a breakaway to make the score 3–1, and eight minutes later, Loui Eriksson put the Swedes ahead by three goals. Following a tripping penalty to Sweden at 56:27, Switzerland pulled Martin Gerber for an extra attacker, but it only took nine seconds before Henrik Sedin sealed the game with an empty netter.\nThe game ended 5–1 for Sweden, who captured the team's ninth gold medal in history. The victory marked the first time since 1986 that a host nation won the tournament."

        "title": "IFSC Climbing World Cup",
        "text": "The IFSC Climbing World Cup is a series of competition climbing events held during the year at various locations around the world, organized by the International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC). At each event, the athletes compete in three disciplines: lead, bouldering, and speed. The number of events varies from year to year, and the winners for each discipline are decided by the points accumulated in the year.\nThe first World Cup was held in 1989 and included only lead competition climbing events. Speed climbing was introduced in 1998, and bouldering in 1999. For 18 seasons, from 1989 to 2006, World Cups were held under the auspices of the International Council for Competition Climbing which was part of the UIAA; they were called UIAA Climbing World Cups. Since 2007, they have been held under the auspices of the IFSC.\nScoring system.\nIndividual disciplines.\nAt the end of each World Cup competition, a trophy is awarded to the winner, the top three athletes are awarded gold, bronze, and silver medals, and the top six athletes are awarded prize money.\nAs of 2022, the top 80 competitors of individual World Cup competitions are eligible to accrue points. Tied competitors are awarded the average of the points allocated for the tied rank positions, rounded down to two decimal places.\nFor each discipline (lead, bouldering and speed), the points awarded to each athlete are added together throughout the World Cup series in order to determine an \"overall\" World Cup ranking. If an athlete participates in all competitions in a discipline, their worst result is discarded (provided that IFSC organizes at least 6 competitions for that season). At the end of the season, the athlete with highest ranking in each discipline will be considered to be the overall winner of the World Cup series, and will be awarded a trophy. The athletes ranking second and third will be awarded a plate.\nNational team ranking.\nAt the end of each competition, a national team ranking is determined, for each discipline, by adding the ranking points of the three highest ranked individual team members. For each discipline (lead, bouldering and speed), the points awarded to each team are added together throughout the World Cup series in order to determine the overall team ranking. If a team participates in all competitions in a discipline, its worst result is discarded (provided that IFSC organizes at least 6 competitions for that season). At the end of the season, the team with highest overall ranking is awarded a trophy.\nCombined ranking.\nFor each season, results obtained by each athlete across events and across disciplines (Lead, Bouldering and Speed) are considered to determine a combined ranking. At the end of the season, prizes are awarded to the top three athletes. The combined title was first introduced in 1998, together with the first speed event. Bouldering was introduced in the following year.\nFrom 1998 to 2017, the combined score for each athlete was obtained by adding together the overall World Cup scores obtained by that athlete in at least two different disciplines. For instance, in 2017 Janja Garnbret won the combined title with a combined score of 1135 points, which was the sum of the overall scores she obtained in Lead and Bouldering. Since she competed in no Speed event, her score in that discipline was zero.\nSince 2018, more complex rules were applied to determine the combined score. Only athletes participating in at least two competitions in each discipline (i.e. 2 in Bouldering, 2 in Lead, and 2 in Speed) were eligible for the combined title. For each World Cup event, rankings were adjusted by discarding non-eligible athletes. Since they were relative to a selected subset of athletes (the eligible ones), these adjusted rankings were called \"relative rankings\", as opposed to the \"general rankings\" applied to the whole set of participants. If an eligible athlete participated in more than two competitions in a discipline, only the best two results in that discipline were considered. For each eligible athlete, the relative rankings obtained in the selected six events were multiplied together to determine a combined score. Athletes were ranked according to their combined score in ascending order. Namely, the athlete with the lowest score was awarded the combined title. For instance, in 2018 Jakob Schubert won the Combined World Cup with a score of 48 points, determined as shown in the table.\nIn 2019, individual combined events were introduced in the World Cup series, where participants are required to compete in all disciplines (Bouldering, Lead and Speed) and medals are awarded based on their combined results. Nevertheless, at the end of the season, combined World Cup rankings will be determined as well, with the same method applied in 2018, based on results across disciplines obtained by each athlete in six selected events.\nMen's results.\nComplete rankings starting from the 1991 season are available on the IFSC web site.\nWomen's results.\nComplete rankings starting from the 1991 season are available on the IFSC web site.\nSeason podium table.\n\"Updated after season 2022 (Men's Category)\"\n\"Updated after season 2022 (Women's Category)\"\nMedal table.\n\"Updated after Wujiang 2024\""

        "title": "Kent State Golden Flashes men's golf",
        "text": "The Kent State Golden Flashes men's golf team is an intercollegiate sport at Kent State University in Kent, Ohio, United States. The program was established in 1934 and competes in the National Collegiate Athletic Association at the Division I level as a member of the Mid-American Conference. Through the 2021–22 season, the Flashes have won 30 conference titles, which includes two championships won as a member of the Ohio Athletic Conference prior to 1951. The 28 MAC titles are the most men's golf titles in conference history and the most conference titles among any sport at Kent State. In addition to their conference titles, Kent State has made 37 appearances in the NCAA Division I Men's Golf Championships, winning three regional championships and advancing to the championship rounds 24 times. The program's highest national finishes are a tie for 5th in 2012, 6th in 2008, and 9th in 2000. Through 2022, Kent State has produced 27 MAC medalists.\nWindmill Lakes Golf Club in Ravenna serves as the program's home course and occasionally hosts matches. The main practice facility is the Page and Ferrara Golf Training and Learning Center, a building located in Franklin Township, which the team shares with the women's golf team. The facility includes a outdoor practice range, outdoor practice tees, and outdoor short-game practice areas as well as an indoor putting and chipping area, a video analysis room, and a Science and Motion Putt lab. In addition, the rear of the facility features heated stalls which allow team members to access the driving range year-round.\nKSU alumnus Jon Mills serves as head coach, after succeeding Herb Page in 2019. Under Page, who coached Kent State for 41 seasons, the Flashes won 23 MAC titles and made 29 appearances in the NCAA tournament. He was named MAC Coach of the Year 21 times and NCAA District IV Coach of the Year nine times. Notable players from the program include 2003 British Open champion Ben Curtis, and Canadian professional golfers Corey Conners, Mackenzie Hughes, Bryan DeCorso, Taylor Pendrith, and Ryan Yip.\nHistory.\nThe team was founded in late 1934 and initially competed only in the fall sports season. Kent State had joined the Ohio Athletic Conference in 1931, so the new golf team began play in the OAC their first season. They were first coached by Joe Begala, a physical education instructor who was also coaching the KSU football team, wrestling team, and men's tennis team that season. In their inaugural season, the Flashes went undefeated in dual match play to claim the school's first conference championship in any sport, going 6–0. The following season, Kent State went 1–5. Until 1936, the OAC used a dual meet format to determine its golf champion and did not have a conference championship meet at the end of the season. The Flashes made their first appearance in the NCAA Men's Golf Championships in 1947, finishing 38th. Kent State went undefeated in OAC dual meets again in 1949, but finished seventh at the OAC meet. However, they again qualified for the NCAA championships, where they finished 28th. Kent State claimed their first and only OAC meet championship in their final OAC tournament appearance in 1950, after finishing the regular season with an 8–1 record in dual matches. KSU was ineligible for the 1951 OAC tournament after the conference passed a resolution barring the Flashes from competing for the conference title. At the Ohio Intercollegiate Golf Championship held a week after the OAC championship, however, Kent State finished 23 and 24 strokes ahead of the OAC co-champions. They also qualified for the NCAA Championships that season, finishing 17th.\nThe Flashes began competition in the Mid-American Conference in 1952 and hosted the championship meet at Meadowview Golf Course just east of campus in Franklin Township. The MAC Golf Championship was part of the MAC's \"sports carnival\", which included the tennis and track championships. KSU finished third in both their first and second MAC appearances. They claimed their first MAC team and individual titles in 1954 as co-champions with the Ohio Bobcats, and qualified for their fourth NCAA Men's Golf Championships appearance. After a tie for second at the MAC Championships in 1955, the Flashes finished no better than 4th until a 3rd place showing in 1967. The following season, they won their second overall and first outright conference title, again played at Meadowview.\nBecause of the Kent State shootings on May 4, 1970, the university was closed and all activities suspended. As such, the Flashes did not participate in that year's MAC championship meet. They returned in 1971 with a team runner-up finish and their second individual title, followed by another individual title in 1973. They claimed their third MAC title in 1977 and qualified for that season's NCAA championships, but were unable to attend.\nHerb Page began his tenure as head coach in 1978 and has made Kent State a regular contender in both the Mid-American Conference and at the NCAA tournament. He led the Flashes to their fourth MAC championship in 1984 and their first appearance in the NCAA championship round since 1954, followed in 1987 with another NCAA championship round appearance. Beginning with their 1989 regional appearance, Kent State has qualified for the NCAA regionals in 25 of 29 seasons, including eight consecutive from 1989 through 1996 and seven consecutive from 2008 through 2014. They have advanced to the championship round in 14 of those years, winning regional championships in 1993, 2001, and 2010. In the championship round, Kent State has finished as high as a tie for 5th in 2012, 6th in 2008, and 9th in 2000. In the Mid-American Conference, since their fifth MAC title in 1992, the Flashes have won 21 additional MAC championships in 27 seasons, including four in a row from 1992 through 1995, five consecutive titles from 1997 through 2001, and six consecutive from 2009 through 2014. Additionally, under Page, Kent State has had 20 MAC medalists, 16 MAC Golfer of the Year recipients, and he has been named MAC Coach of the Year 20 times, all of which are the most in conference history.\nConference championships.\nKent State has won 28 Mid-American Conference Men's Golf Championships since joining the conference in 1951 and has had 27 individual MAC medalists, including co-champions in 2005, 2006, and 2010. Prior to joining the MAC, Kent State competed as a member of the Ohio Athletic Conference from 1934 to 1951, where they won two titles. The Flashes won their first conference title in any sport in 1934 in their first season of play and won the OAC again in 1950. They won their first MAC title in 1954 when they shared the championship with the Ohio Bobcats. After titles in 1968, 1977, and 1984, Kent State won four in a row beginning in 1992, followed by five consecutive MAC titles beginning in 1994, and six consecutive beginning in 2009. Kent State's 28 MAC championships are the most in conference history.\nNCAA tournament.\nThe NCAA Division I Men's Golf Championships debuted in 1939 and the Flashes made their first appearance in 1947. Initially, the tournament consisted of only the championship rounds, with regional rounds added in 1989. Through the 2020–21 season, Kent State has 36 total appearances in the tournament with 22 appearances in the championship round. Since the start of regional play, Kent State has advanced to the championship round 15 times and won three regional titles through 2020. They have three top-ten finishes in the championship round: a tie for 5th in 2012, 6th in 2008, and 9th in 2000.\nCoaches.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nFacilities.\nThe team's home course is Windmill Lakes Golf Club, located approximately east of Kent in Ravenna, which has also been used by the women's golf team since their inception in 1999. Kent State began using the course regularly in 1978 after Herb Page, the head professional and part-owner at Windmill Lakes, was hired as head coach. Windmill Lakes is a par 70 course measuring . It is mainly used for practices and occasional tournaments, hosting the Mid-American Conference Men's Golf Championships in 1984 and 1993. It was most recently used for a tournament in 2008 when KSU hosted the FirstEnergy Intercollegiate.\nAt their founding in 1934, the Flashes had two home courses, both of which were located just outside the city of Kent in Franklin Township: Twin Lakes Country Club in the Twin Lakes area just north of Kent, and Meadowview Golf Course, just east of campus. The university bought Meadowview in January 1966 and eventually renamed in the Kent State University Golf Course. Kent State hosted the Mid-American Conference Men's Golf Championships at Meadowview on five occasions between 1952 and 1975. After moving to Windmill Lakes, the Flashes continued using the Kent State University Golf Course for occasional practice until it was closed at the end of 2016.\nThe main training facility for both the men's and women's golf teams is the Ferrara and Page Golf Training and Learning Center, located in Franklin Township adjacent to the southern boundary of the former KSU Golf Course, less than north of Dix Stadium. The facility, named after head coach Herb Page and philanthropists Emilio and Margaret Ferrara, includes a outdoor putting green, a practice range, along with practice fairways and tee areas, and heated bays that allow outdoor practice during winter months. Inside is a practice green, team locker rooms, video room, offices, weight room, and a lounge and study area.\nAwards.\nThe Mid-American Conference has four awards, which are selected at the conference championship: Sportsman of the Year, Golfer of the Year, Freshman of the Year, and Coach of the Year. Both the Golfer of the Year and Freshman of the Year awards started in 1994, while Coach of the Year began in 1973. The Sportsman of the Year award, started in 1981 is voted on by players. "

        "title": "List of NCAA Division I men's ice hockey seasons",
        "text": "Tournament play begins.\nThough U.S. colleges had been fielding men's ice hockey teams since 1895, the NCAA did not have a formal tournament in place to decide a champion until after World War II. Starting with the 1947-48 season, the NCAA tournament invited the four top-ranked teams to Colorado Springs, Colorado to compete for the NCAA Championship.\n \nRotating tournaments.\nAfter spending 10 years at one location, the NCAA began to move the Division I ice hockey tournament to different sites. Over the next 14 years, the tournament was held in 11 different venues and, more importantly to the northeast teams, was held in New England eight times. While the rotations stopped briefly in 1972, they resumed after 1974 and the tournament has not been held in the same city for consecutive years since.\n \nQuarterfinals expansion.\nFor the 30th season of the tournament, which had become the de facto possession of the WCHA and ECAC, the NCAA instituted a new rule by which they were able to add up to four additional teams to the tournament if they saw fit. This policy essentially became a vehicle allowing the CCHA champion to play with the lone exception coming in 1978. For the 1981 tournament the NCAA altered the rule to guarantee a full quarterfinal round and started including true 'at large' teams for the first time. Between 1981 and 1987 the quarterfinals consisted of two games where the team that scored the most goals in the two games would advance to the \"Frozen Four\". Between 1977 and 1987 Detroit, Michigan and Providence, Rhode Island would each host the tournament 4 separate times.\n \nAdditional expansion.\nWith 4 major conferences and a myriad of independent programs competing at the Division I level, the tournament was expanded to 12 teams beginning with the 1987-88 season. The first round followed the same pattern as the quarterfinals with teams playing two games against a single opponent and the one with a higher goal total after the series advancing. The rest of the tournament retained the earlier format. One year later the goal-total format was abandoned and replaced by a best-of-three series for the opening round and quarterfinals. In 1992 the entire tournament was switched to a single-elimination format and divided into two regional locations that would feed into the \"Frozen Four\". For the first time, in 1999, the championship was held in a region without a local Division I program when the championship round was awarded to Anaheim, California.\n \nFurther expansion and commercialization.\nAfter the addition of two more conferences around the turn of the century (MAAC and CHA, neither of which now sponsors men's hockey) bringing up the total number to 6, and with each receiving an at-large bid starting in 2001 and 2003 respectively, the tournament was again expanded by 4 teams. Two additional regional groups were added (Northeast and Midwest) and byes into the quarterfinals were eliminated. Additionally the \"Frozen Four\" was seen as a vehicle to increase both revenue and the popularity of college hockey, as such the apex of the tournament began to move around to non-traditional college hockey areas, usually in the buildings of NHL teams.\nThe first decade of the 21st century saw significant changes to hockey's conference landscape. After the 2002–03 season, the MAAC hockey programs split from the league to form Atlantic Hockey. CHA stopped sponsoring men's hockey after the 2009–10 season, but still operates as a women's league.\n \nConference realignment and dissolution.\nIn 2010, Terry Pegula, an alumnus of Pennsylvania State University, donated $102 million to his alma mater for the express purpose of building a brand-new hockey arena and to fund the upgrade of both the men's and women's ice hockey programs from club level to Division I. This began a chain of events that caused a massive amount of conference realignment, the founding of two new conferences, and the ending of one of the oldest conferences in the NCAA. Penn State's rise to the D-I ranks gave the Big Ten its sixth university that sponsored varsity men's ice hockey, a number significant for two reasons. First, Big Ten bylaws dictate that the conference can only sponsor a sport if it has at least six participating members. More significantly, NCAA rules on conference formation dictate that at least six teams must be present for a conference to receive an automatic bid into the NCAA tournament. In short order the other five teams announced their intention to leave their conferences (WCHA and CCHA). In response several members of the WCHA, including traditional powerhouses Denver and North Dakota, split to form a new conference, the NCHC. The NCHC quickly grew to 8 member teams, leaving the WCHA with only 4 remaining schools and the CCHA with 6. Five of the remaining CCHA schools then proceeded to join the WCHA, along with the Independent Alabama-Huntsville, bringing the WCHA up to 10 member schools. The remaining CCHA team, Notre Dame, joined Hockey East. In essence all of the universities that changed conferences were not significantly harmed by the upheaval because no team was left without a conference by the start of the 2013–14 season. However, the shift did create one more automatic qualifier for the tournament, reducing the chance to receive an at-large bid for all schools across the nation.\nIn November 2019, the seven Midwestern schools among the 10 members of the men's WCHA jointly announced they would leave the league after the 2020–21 season, citing the league's extended geographic footprint as a reason for this move. On February 18, 2020, these seven schools announced they would start play in a new CCHA in the 2021–22 season. In July of that year, the revived CCHA announced that St. Thomas, which had just received NCAA approval to move directly from Division III to Division I starting in July 2021, would join the league upon its arrival in D-I.\nThe 2020 tournament was cancelled on March 12, 2020, just before the start of most conference postseason tournaments, due to concerns from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n "

        "text": "The Wales national rugby union team toured Argentina in May–June 1999. They played five matches, including two tests against the Argentina national team. The tour served as preparation for the 1999 Rugby World Cup, which Wales hosted in October and November that year.\nWales won the test series 2–0, winning the first test 36–26 and the second 23–16 to claim their first series victory in the Southern Hemisphere; however, they only won one of their three tour matches, beating Tucumán 69–44 but losing 31–29 to Buenos Aires and 47–34 to Argentina A.\nSquad.\nWales coach Graham Henry named a squad of 37 for the tour of Argentina, including three uncapped players: scrum-half Rhodri Jones, and back-rowers Richard Arnold and Ian Boobyer. Fly-half Arwel Thomas and lock Andy Moore were recalled to the Wales team after missing the 1999 Five Nations Championship. Henry also named seven standby players, including lock Gareth Llewellyn and full-back Byron Hayward. After injuries to Pontypridd's Ian Gough and Kevin Morgan, Llewellyn and Hayward were called up to the main tour squad. Centre Scott Gibbs was also ruled out after breaking a hand; he was replaced by Newport's Matthew Watkins.\nStandby squad\nResults.\n\"Scores and results list Wales's points tally first.\"\nBuenos Aires v Wales.\nWales named a strong team for the opening match of their tour, and took a 19–14 lead into half-time thanks to a late try from Allan Bateman, converted by Arwel Thomas, who also kicked four penalties in the opening quarter; however, Buenos Aires were still in the game thanks to a try from Rolando Martín and three José Cilley penalties, and they took the lead early in the second half when Octavio Bartolucci crossed for the home side and Cilley added the extras. Wales went back in front thanks to a converted try from Geraint Lewis, but Cilley added another penalty before converting Tomás Solari's try to give Buenos Aires a 31–26 lead as the game entered its final quarter. Thomas pulled the score back to 31–29 three minutes later, but there were no further scores and Wales suffered a shock defeat.\nTucumán v Wales.\nWales won their first match of the tour in a nine-try performance against Tucumán. Wing Matthew Robinson scored four times, while Mark Taylor and Neil Boobyer claimed two apiece, and Geraint Lewis completed the scoring. Fly-half Arwel Thomas was almost perfect from the tee, converting all nine tries and kicking two out of three penalty attempts for a total of 24 out of Wales's 69 points. Tucumán scored 22 of their points in a 10-minute spell in which they took a 25–20 lead, but Wales were able to come back to win 69–44.\nFirst test: Argentina v Wales.\nFollowing his four tries in the game against Tucumán four days earlier, Matthew Robinson was named on the wing for Wales's first test against Argentina, taking the place of Gareth Thomas. In the only other change from the team that beat England in the final game of the Five Nations, Allan Bateman partnered Mark Taylor in the centres in place of the injured Scott Gibbs. Despite a strong team, Wales found themselves 23–0 down before the half-hour mark; fly-half Gonzalo Quesada scored 18 of those points, converting his own try as well as one from Octavio Bartolucci, in addition to three penalties. Wales got back into the game shortly before half-time as Neil Jenkins kicked a penalty before converting a Dafydd James try with the last play of the half, reducing the deficit to 23–10. Jenkins added another penalty before converting a Brett Sinkinson try in the first 10 minutes of the second period. He then levelled the scores as the game entered the final quarter, only for Quesada to restore a three-point lead for the hosts; however, Shane Howarth made it 26–26 with a drop goal in the 68th minute. Wales then pulled clear thanks to a try from Chris Wyatt, which Jenkins converted before kicking another penalty to give the tourists a 36–26 win. Coach Graham Henry blamed Wales's slow start on having arrived late at the stadium; their police escort did not turn up and the team coach was blocked in at the hotel, which meant they arrived only 45 minutes before kick-off. Henry commended his team's determination to come back from 23–0 down, and reserved special praise for their scrummaging, particularly that of hooker Garin Jenkins, who he said he had \"misjudged\" when he took over as Wales coach.\nArgentina A v Wales.\nGraham Henry changed his entire starting line-up for the midweek match against Argentina A in Rosario. The opening 20 minutes of the game saw Arwel Thomas and Felipe Contepomi trade penalties, but tries from Juan Fernández Miranda, Gonzalo Camardón and Nicolás Fernández Miranda in the second quarter meant Wales trailed 27–15 at the break. Further penalties from Contepomi, a drop goal from Camardón and a converted try from Patricio Grande extended that lead to 29 points before Wales scored their first try through scrum-half Rhodri Jones just before the hour mark. Neil Boobyer added another a few minutes later, and Nick Walne also crossed as the game entered the final 10 minutes, but despite successful conversions from Arwel Thomas, it was not enough to avoid another tour defeat. During the match, a photography gantry collapsed under the weight of around 20 spectators who had climbed on it; there were no serious injuries, but the match was stopped for six minutes while aid was provided.\nSecond test: Argentina v Wales.\nHaving failed to live up to his performance against Tucumán in the first test, Matthew Robinson was dropped in favour of Gareth Thomas on the right wing as one of two changes to the Wales line-up from a week earlier; the other change saw Geraint Lewis come in for Colin Charvis in the back row. Wales took an 8–0 lead in the opening 15 minutes thanks to a penalty from Neil Jenkins and a try from his namesake Garin. Felipe Contepomi reduced the deficit with a penalty 10 minutes later, but that was soon followed by the biggest flashpoint of the game; after Dafydd James was deemed to have illegally killed the ball, he was punched by Argentina prop Mauricio Reggiardo, sparking a mass brawl on the sideline. As a result, Reggiardo was yellow-carded along with Argentina captain Pedro Sporleder and Wales prop Peter Rogers. Contepomi put Argentina into a 9–8 lead with two more penalties, only for Jenkins to edge Wales back in front with a kick of his own on the stroke of half-time. He added another early in the second half, before stretching the lead to 17–9 with a 46th-minute drop goal after Chris Wyatt managed to steal the ball from an Argentina line-out. Wales had the chance to put the contest to bed shortly after as Thomas headed towards the try line, only to knock on. Contepomi missed the opportunity to close the gap with two kicks at goal, and Wales responded with two more penalties of their own to take the lead to 23–9 and Jenkins' international points total past the 800 mark, behind only Australian fly-half Michael Lynagh. José Orengo's try, converted by José Cilley, reduced the home side's deficit to seven points in the final minutes, but it was too little, too late as Wales secured the whitewash and their first series win in the Southern Hemisphere."

        "text": "Brett Maher ( ; born November 21, 1989) is an American football placekicker who is a free agent. He played college football for the Nebraska Cornhuskers and was signed by the New York Jets as an undrafted free agent after the 2013 NFL draft. Maher has also been a member of several NFL teams, and the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, the Ottawa Redblacks and the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League (CFL).\nEarly years.\nMaher attended Centennial Public Schools in Utica, Nebraska for his first three years of high school before transferring to Kearney High School, where he played high school football for the Bearcats.\nAs a senior, Maher made 8-of-14 field goals, 41 of 46 extra points, and averaged 41.1 yards per punt. He also played wide receiver, posting 775 receiving yards and 10 touchdowns. Maher received All-state honors from the \"Lincoln Journal Star\" and \"Omaha World-Herald\" at the end of the season.\nIn basketball, Maher was an honorable-mention Class A all-state pick as a senior. In track, he won the long jump and pole vault state championships as a senior, setting a state record in the latter. Maher has pole vaulted 4.93m (16'-2\").\nCollege career.\nMaher turned down other football scholarship offers to walk-on at the University of Nebraska. As a redshirt freshman and as a sophomore, he appeared in all games as the holder for field goals and extra points, while also serving as the backup punter behind Alex Henery.\nAs a junior, Maher was named the starter at placekicker and punter after Henery graduated. Maher made 19-of-23 field goals, 43-of-44 extra points and averaged 44.5 yards per punt (sixth in school history). He received Big Ten Conference Special Teams Player of the Week honors three times, while being named Eddleman-Fields Big Ten Punter of the Year and Bakken-Andersen Big Ten Kicker of the Year. Maher became one of the few specialists in Big Ten history to be named All-Conference both at kicker and punter in the same season.\nAs a senior, the school awarded Maher with a football scholarship. He made 20-of-27 field goals, all of his 59 extra point attempts, 57 touchbacks out of 96 kickoffs, and averaged 41.8 yards per punt. Maher's 20 field goals ranked second in school history for a season, and his 119 points set a record for most points scored by a kicker. Maher ranked third overall in conference in scoring and first among kickers. He received the Bakken-Andersen Big Ten Kicker-of-the-Year Award for the second straight year.\nMaher finished his collegiate career with 39-of-50 made field goals (78%), 219 points, 120 punts for a 43.2-yard average and 43 punts inside the 20-yard line.\nProfessional career.\nNew York Jets.\nMaher was signed as an undrafted free agent by the New York Jets after the 2013 NFL Draft on May 12, 2013, earning the contract following a rookie minicamp tryout. He was waived on July 23, to make room for placekicker Billy Cundiff.\nDallas Cowboys.\nOn August 11, 2013, Maher was signed by the Dallas Cowboys, to play in the preseason while Dan Bailey recovered from an injury. Maher was released two weeks later on August 27.\nWinnipeg Blue Bombers.\nOn May 1, 2014, Maher signed a contract with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the Canadian Football League (CFL). He played in two preseason games for the Bombers before being released by the team due to the restrictions on the number of national and international players on the team's roster; the team kept their Canadian incumbent, Lirim Hajrullahu.\nOttawa Redblacks.\nA few weeks after being released by Winnipeg, Maher signed with the Ottawa Redblacks. In Week 4 of the season, Maher was named the CFL's Special Teams Player of the Week after going 6-for-6 on field goals, scoring all the Redblacks' points in an 18–17 decision over the Toronto Argonauts. The victory marked the expansion club's first-ever win. On May 13, 2015, Maher was released by the Redblacks because of a hip injury he suffered in the prior month, before the start of training camp. Maher missed all but four games during the season due to the injury.\nHamilton Tiger-Cats.\nOn May 19, 2016, Maher signed with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats after taking part in a team minicamp. He completed 82% of his field goal attempts that season, going 41-for-50, and had a punt average of 45.9 yards.\nCleveland Browns.\nOn March 20, 2017, Maher signed with the Cleveland Browns. On May 2, Maher was released after not being able to pass rookie Zane Gonzalez on the depth chart.\nOttawa Redblacks (second stint).\nOn June 10, 2017, Maher signed with the Redblacks. He achieved the same completion percentage as the previous season in Hamilton (82%), recording the same number of field goals (41) on 50 attempts. Maher's punt average was 46.7 yards.\nDallas Cowboys (second stint).\n2018 season.\nOn April 4, 2018, Maher signed with the Cowboys, to limit the off-season workload of Dan Bailey. Maher was 4 out of 5 field goal attempts in preseason, which included two 45-yarders and a 57-yard field goal. On September 1, in a surprise move, the Cowboys released Bailey, making Maher the team's kicker to start the season. Maher's NFL debut came in the season opener against the Carolina Panthers, where he missed his first career field goal attempt (47 yards). Maher would then go on to make fifteen straight field goal attempts.\nIn Week 4, Maher kicked all four field goals (32, 43, 22, and 38 yards), including a 38-yard game-winner as time expired, in a 26–24 comeback victory over the Detroit Lions, earning him NFC Special Teams Player of the Week. Two weeks later against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Maher converted four field goals, including a 55-yarder which at the time was his career long and the second-longest field goal in AT&amp;T Stadium behind Dan Bailey's 56-yard field goal. From Week 7 to Week 11, Maher missed either a field goal or an extra point in four straight games.\nOn November 18, Maher kicked a 48-yard game-winning field goal to beat the Atlanta Falcons. Three weeks later,he kicked a new career-long 62-yard field goal against the Philadelphia Eagles as time expired in the first half. The field goal also set a franchise record and tied for the third-longest in NFL history.\nIn Week 16, Maher converted two field goals (including the second longest in franchise history-59 yards) and three extra points in a 27–20 win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, earning him NFC Special Teams Player of the Week. Maher made 5-of-8 (63%) field goal attempts in the final 4 games (not including playoffs), missing a field goal in three of the last four games.\nMaher finished with 29-of-36 field goals (80.6%), 32-of-33 extra points and 67.5% touchbacks of his kickoffs. Maher ranked eighth in the league with 29 field goals and tied for most field goals of at least 50 yards (6), which also tied a franchise record for a single season. He was 25th in field goal percentage and tied for 11th in the league in accuracy from 40 to 49 yards (7-of-11).\n2019 season.\nIn 2019, Maher struggled with his accuracy during the preseason, but the team showed confidence on his ability by not bringing another kicker to compete with him. On October 6, Maher made one out of three field goal attempts against the Green Bay Packers. However, in the next game against the Jets, he became the first kicker in NFL history to have two made field goals of 62 or more yards in a career.\nOn October 20, Maher set a new career long and broke his own franchise record when he made a 63-yard field goal against the Philadelphia Eagles. Maher finished the game converting all four of his extra points and all three of his field goals, earning NFC Special Teams Player of the Week honors. Maher kept struggling during the season with accuracy issues, but the team was patient, waiting for him to play through it. On November 28, he missed two field goals (one deflected) in the 15–26 loss against the Buffalo Bills.\nOn December 5, Maher missed a 42-yard field goal in the 31–24 loss against the Chicago Bears, his 10th miss of the season. Although Maher converted a 31-yard attempt in the final two minutes to cut the lead to seven points, he also hit a kickoff out of bounds early in the fourth quarter, helping the Bears take over at their own 40-yard line. After the game he was quoted in the media as saying: \"I felt like I hit every ball pretty well tonight. I'll put my head on the pillow tonight feeling good about what I did this week and moving forward\".\nOn December 9, with the team having lost three consecutive games and in jeopardy of missing the playoffs, Maher was released by the Cowboys due to accuracy concerns. He finished the season converting just 20-of-30 field goals (67%), 7-of-13 (54%) on attempts between 30 and 49 yards, missing at least one attempt in 8 of 13 games and making all 36 extra points.

He was waived again on February 22, 2022.\nDallas Cowboys (third stint).\nOn August 9, 2022, the Cowboys signed Maher after releasing Jonathan Garibay to compete for the kicking position with Lirim Hajrullahu. He was waived on August 30, 2022, and signed to the practice squad the next day.\nOn September 17, 2022, the Cowboys promoted Maher from the practice squad. In the Cowboys' eventual win over the Cincinnati Bengals, Maher kicked a 54-yard field goal in the second quarter and a 50-yard field goal with three seconds left to seal the 20–17 upset win. In the next game, he hit three field goals in a \"Monday Night Football\" game against the New York Giants. But before halftime, Maher just missed left of the uprights from 59 yards out, giving him a 3-for-4 performance. The following week, Maher hit all four field goals (53, 45, 28, 29) against the Commanders, although he did have an extra point blocked, his fourth extra point miss of his career.\nOn November 20, 2022, Maher converted all four field goals against the Minnesota Vikings, three of which were 50 yards or longer, including a 60-yard field goal that he had to make twice, because of a play review by the officiating crew.

On January 22, 2023, he made 2-of-2 field goal attempts and had his first extra point of the game blocked against the San Francisco 49ers.\nAlthough he struggled in the postseason, Maher had one of the best kicking regular seasons in franchise history, by making 29-of-32 field goals (90.6%), with 2 misses coming from 59-yard attempts, and was nine of 11 (82%) from 50-plus yards. He made 50-of-53 extra points attempts, with two of them being blocked. Maher led the league with 78 touchback kickoffs.

The team that scored more goals on aggregate over the two legs advanced to the next round. If the aggregate score was level, the away goals rule was applied, i.e. the team that scored more goals away from home over the two legs advanced. If away goals were also equal, then 30 minutes of extra time was played. The away goals rule was again applied after extra time, i.e. if there were goals scored during extra time and the aggregate score was still level, the visiting team advanced by virtue of more away goals scored. If no goals were scored during extra time, the tie was decided by penalty shoot-out.\nIn the draws for each round, teams were seeded based on their UEFA club coefficients at the beginning of the season, with the teams divided into seeded and unseeded pots. A seeded team was drawn against an unseeded team, with the order of legs in each tie decided randomly. Due to the limited time between matches, the draws for the second and third qualifying rounds took place before the results of the previous round were known. For these draws (or in any cases where the result of a tie in the previous round was not known at the time of the draw), the seeding was carried out under the assumption that the team with the higher coefficient of an undecided tie advanced to this round, which means if the team with the lower coefficient was to advance, it simply took the seeding of its defeated opponent. Prior to the draws, UEFA may form \"groups\" in accordance with the principles set by the Club Competitions Committee, but they were purely for convenience of the draw and for ensuring that teams from the same association were not drawn against each other, and did not resemble any real groupings in the sense of the competition.\nTeams.\nThere were two routes which the teams were separated into during qualifying:\nA total of 55 teams (40 in Champions Route, 15 in League Route) were involved in the qualifying phase and play-off round.

Normally, he would have been suspended for the two legs against St. Patrick's Athletic and the first leg of the Celtic; however, Legia Warsaw failed to register Bereszyński for the St. Patrick's Athletic matches, meaning he would have had to sit out both legs of this match and the first leg of the next UEFA match.

The 32 teams were allocated into four pots based on their UEFA club coefficients at the beginning of the season, with the title holders being placed in Pot 1 automatically. They were drawn into eight groups of four containing one team from each of the four seeding pots, with the restriction that teams from the same national association could not be drawn against each other. Moreover, the draw was controlled for teams from the same association in order to split the teams evenly into the two sets of groups (A–D, E–H) for maximum television coverage.\nThe fixtures were decided after the draw. On each matchday, four groups played their matches on Tuesday, while the other four groups played their matches on Wednesday, with the two sets of groups (A–D, E–H) alternating between each matchday. There were other restrictions: for example, teams from the same city (e.g., Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid, Chelsea and Arsenal, Benfica and Sporting CP) in general did not play at home on the same matchday (UEFA tried to avoid teams from the same city playing at home on the same day or on consecutive days), and Russian teams did not play at home on the last matchday due to cold weather.\nOn 17 July 2014, the UEFA Emergency Panel ruled that Ukrainian and Russian clubs would not be drawn against each other \"until further notice\" due to the political unrest between the countries. Therefore, Ukrainian club Shakhtar Donetsk (Pot 2) and Russian club CSKA Moscow (Pot 3) could not be drawn into the same group despite being in different pots.\nTeams.\nBelow were the 32 teams which qualified for the group stage (with their 2014 UEFA club coefficients), grouped by their seeding pot.

        "text": "The 2015 UEFA Champions League final was the final match of the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League, the 60th season of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the 23rd season since it was renamed from the European Champion Clubs' Cup to the UEFA Champions League. It was played at the Olympiastadion in Berlin, Germany, on 6 June 2015, between Italian side Juventus and Spanish side Barcelona.\nFor the second time – after 2010 – both teams came into the final with the possibility of definitively winning a continental treble, having each won their national league and cup for the season. Barcelona scored the only goal of the first half after four minutes, through Ivan Rakitić. Ten minutes after the interval, Juventus equalised with a goal by Álvaro Morata. In the 68th minute, Luis Suárez put Barcelona back in the lead, and Barcelona's win was confirmed when Neymar scored with the last kick of the game. It was Barcelona's fifth trophy in the competition, and sealed their second treble, the other coming in 2009. It was also Juventus' sixth defeat in a European Cup final, the most by any club, a record they previously shared with Bayern Munich and Benfica.\nAs winners, Barcelona earned the right to play against the winners of the 2014–15 UEFA Europa League, Sevilla, in the 2015 UEFA Super Cup, and won that match 5–4. They also qualified to enter the 2015 FIFA Club World Cup in Japan as the UEFA representative, going on to beat Argentina's River Plate in the final.\nVenue.\nThe Olympiastadion was announced as the venue for the final at the UEFA Executive Committee meeting in London on 23 May 2013. This was the first European Cup/Champions League final hosted in Berlin.\nThe current Olympiastadion was built for the 1936 Summer Olympics in the western part of the city. Since 1985, the stadium has hosted the finals of both the DFB-Pokal and its female equivalent. The Olympiastadion hosts the Internationales Stadionfest, which was an IAAF Golden League event from 1998 to 2009. The stadium hosted the 2009 World Championships in Athletics.\nAside from its use as an Olympic stadium, the Olympiastadion has a strong footballing tradition, having been the home of Hertha BSC since 1963. It was also used for three matches at the 1974 FIFA World Cup, and was renovated ahead of the 2006 tournament, at which it hosted six matches, including the final.\nBackground.\nThis was the eighth European Cup/UEFA Champions League final for both Juventus and Barcelona. Juventus won two of their previous finals (1985, 1996) and lost five (1973, 1983, 1997, 1998, 2003), while Barcelona won four of their previous finals (1992, 2006, 2009, 2011) and lost three (1961, 1986, 1994). Barcelona also played in six Cup Winners' Cup finals (winning in 1979, 1982, 1989, 1997, and losing in 1969, 1991), while Juventus also played in one Cup Winners' Cup final (winning in 1984) and four UEFA Cup finals (winning in 1977, 1990, 1993, and losing in 1995).\nThe two teams had previously played six times in UEFA club competitions, but never in a final. In their previous UEFA club competition meetings, Barcelona won 2–1 on aggregate in the 1985–86 European Cup quarter-finals and 3–2 on aggregate in the 1990–91 European Cup Winners' Cup semi-finals, while Juventus won 3–2 on aggregate in the 2002–03 UEFA Champions League quarter-finals. They also played in the 1952 Latin Cup semi-finals, won by Barcelona 4–2, and the 1970–71 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup second round, won by Juventus 4–2 on aggregate.\nSimilar to the 2010 UEFA Champions League final, both teams entered the final in the possibility of winning the treble of domestic league, domestic cup and Champions League titles. Juventus were crowned champions of the 2014–15 Serie A on 2 May, and won the 2015 Coppa Italia final eighteen days later. Barcelona were crowned champions of the 2014–15 La Liga on 17 May, and won the 2015 Copa del Rey final thirteen days later. While it would have been the first treble for Juventus, Barcelona had previously won the treble in 2008–09.\nRoad to the final.\n\"Note: In all results below, the score of the finalist is given first (H: home; A: away).\"\nJuventus.\nAs winners of the 2013–14 Serie A, Juventus qualified automatically for the group stage. They were seeded second in Group A featuring – in seeded order – Atlético Madrid (champions of the 2013–14 La Liga), Olympiacos (champions of the 2013–14 Superleague Greece), and Malmö FF (champions of the 2013 Allsvenskan).\nTheir campaign began on 16 September, hosting Malmö at the Juventus Stadium, winning 2–0 through second-half goals by Carlos Tevez. On 1 October, they travelled to face Atlético at the Vicente Calderón Stadium, losing by a sole goal from Arda Turan late on, a result that left all four teams level on three points apiece. Three weeks later Juventus again lost by one goal on their travels, Pajtim Kasami scoring in the first half for Olympiacos, whose goalkeeper Roberto played a key role. On 4 November, hosting the Greeks, Juventus won 3–2 after trailing 1–2, getting two goals in as many minutes from Roberto's own goal and Paul Pogba's winning strike.\nOn 26 November, Juventus won away for the first time in the group, with second-half goals from Fernando Llorente and Tevez at Malmö's Swedbank Stadion. In the final group game on 9 December, they hosted a goalless draw against Atlético, which sent both teams through, but Juventus in second place.\nAs group runners-up, Juventus had to face a group winner – Germans Borussia Dortmund of Group D – in the last 16. They won 2–1 at home in the first leg on 24 February 2015, with all the goals in the first half – visitor Marco Reus equalised either side of strikes from Tevez and Álvaro Morata. The same forwards were on target in the second leg at the Westfalenstadion on 18 March – Tevez scored twice, including in the third minute – as Juventus won 3–0, and 5–1 on aggregate.\nIn the quarter-finals, Juventus faced Monaco, runners-up in the 2013–14 Ligue 1. The only goal of the tie came in the first leg at home on 14 April, Arturo Vidal scoring a penalty kick after Ricardo Carvalho tripped Morata. It was their first advancement into the semi-finals for 12 years.\nOn 5 May, Juventus hosted reigning champions Real Madrid at Juventus Stadium. Morata opened the scoring against his former team, and Cristiano Ronaldo equalised before half time. Tevez scored the winning goal from the penalty spot after he was fouled by Dani Carvajal. Eight days later, the two teams drew at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium: Ronaldo scored a penalty after Giorgio Chiellini fouled James Rodríguez, but in the second half Morata equalised. Juventus advanced to the final 3–2 on aggregate.\nBarcelona.\nBarcelona qualified for the group stage as runners-up to Atlético in the previous season's La Liga. They were the top seeds in Group F, alongside – in order – Paris Saint-Germain (winners of the 2013–14 Ligue 1), Ajax (winners of the 2013–14 Eredivisie) and APOEL (winners of the 2013–14 Cypriot First Division).\nIn their first game of the group, defender Gerard Piqué headed the only goal to defeat APOEL at the Camp Nou on 17 September. However, thirteen days later at the Parc des Princes, they fell 3–2 to Paris Saint-Germain. On 21 October, Barcelona hosted Ajax and got first-half goals through Neymar and Lionel Messi; Anwar El Ghazi scored for the visitors with two minutes to play but Sandro's added-time strike confirmed a 3–1 win. Barcelona travelled to the Amsterdam Arena on 5 November and defeated Ajax 2–0 with a Messi goal in each half; he equalled the tournament's record of 71 overall goals.\nOn 25 November, Barcelona played APOEL at the GSP Stadium in Nicosia, winning 4–0 with a hat-trick from Messi and a further goal from Luis Suárez; Messi became the competition's all-time top scorer. Barcelona won the group with a 3–1 home win over PSG on 10 December. They initially fell behind to a goal by Zlatan Ibrahimović, but replied with a goal each from the South American forward line of Messi, Neymar and Suárez.\nIn the last 16, Barcelona faced Manchester City, winners of the 2013–14 Premier League and Group E runners-up. In the first leg at the City of Manchester Stadium on 24 February 2015, Suárez scored twice in the first 30 minutes, and Sergio Agüero got a goal back for the hosts after the break. In the return game on 18 March, City goalkeeper limited Barcelona to a single goal by Ivan Rakitić, and Barcelona advanced 3–1 on aggregate.\nBarcelona met PSG again in the quarter-finals. On 15 April in Paris, Neymar scored the only goal of the first half and Suárez added two more, with the hosts getting a consolation through Jérémy Mathieu's own goal. Six days later, two first-half goals from Neymar sealed a 5–1 aggregate win.\nIn the semi-finals, Barcelona's opponents were Bayern Munich, winners of the 2013–14 Bundesliga. They hosted the first leg on 6 May, breaking the deadlock with two late goals from Messi in a three-minute spell, and an added-time addition by Neymar. Six days later at the Allianz Arena, Bayern took the lead through Medhi Benatia, and Neymar put Barcelona into the lead by half time. Second-half goals by Robert Lewandowski and Thomas Müller gave Bayern a 3–2 win on the night, but Barcelona advanced 5–3 on aggregate.\nPre-match.\nAmbassador.\nFormer Germany international player Karl-Heinz Riedle, who won the Champions League with Borussia Dortmund against Juventus in 1997, was named the ambassador for the final.\nLogo.\nUEFA unveiled the visual identity of the final on 29 August 2014. It blends the stadium with the city's Brandenburg Gate.\nTicketing.\nWith a stadium capacity of 70,500, a total amount of 46,000 tickets were available to fans and the general public, with the two finalist teams receiving 20,000 tickets each and with 6,000 tickets being available for sale to fans worldwide via UEFA.com from 5 to 23 March 2015 in four price categories: €390, €280, €160, and €70. The rest of 24,500 tickets were allocated to sponsors and officials.\nRelated events.\nThe 2015 UEFA Women's Champions League final was held on 14 May 2015 at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in Berlin. Unlike recent years, in which the Women's Champions League final was held in the same week as the men's Champions League final, the two matches are separated by almost a month, as the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup started in early June.\nThe annual UEFA Champions Festival was held between 4–7 June 2015 in the streets around Brandenburg Gate.\nOpening ceremony.\nThe UEFA Champions League Anthem is performed by German soprano Nina Maria Fischer and Spanish tenor Manuel Gomez Ruiz, the first time it had been performed as a duet.\nMatch.\nOfficials.\nIn May 2015, the officials were chosen for the final by UEFA, led by Turkish referee Cüneyt Çakır. His compatriots Bahattin Duran and Tarık Ongun were chosen as assistant referees, and fellow Turks Hüseyin Göçek and Barış Şimşek the additional assistants, with Mustafa Emre Eyisoy the reserve assistant. Jonas Eriksson, of Sweden, was chosen as fourth official. Çakır is a UEFA elite referee, and has refereed at UEFA Euro 2012 and the 2014 FIFA World Cup, as well as the 2012 FIFA Club World Cup Final.\nÇakır was scrutinised by the British media in 2013 when he sent off Manchester United's Nani in a Champions League round of 16 match and the English team went on to lose to Real Madrid. Manager Alex Ferguson was so enraged by the decision that he refused to speak to the media after the game. UEFA confirmed that no action would be taken against the referee, concluding that he made the correct judgement.\nTeam selection.\nJuventus defender Giorgio Chiellini was ruled out of the final with a calf injury picked up in training on 3 June. Barcelona had no injury concerns before the final.\nBarcelona's Luis Suárez had previously been involved in two controversies with players in the Juventus squad: in 2012, he was found guilty by an FA commission of using racially insulting language towards Patrice Evra in a game between their respective former clubs Liverpool and Manchester United, and at the 2014 FIFA World Cup he escaped punishment for biting Chiellini but was punished retrospectively. Evra stated that he would shake Suárez's hand before the game, after Suarez had refused to shake his hand in their last match.\nSummary.\nIn the second minute, Barcelona's Javier Mascherano conceded a corner kick, which Juventus aimed at Evra but Barcelona cleared it. However two minutes later, Jordi Alba made a run on Barcelona's left, passing to Neymar and then Andrés Iniesta who set up Ivan Rakitić to score the first goal from close range. Rakitić's goal was Barcelona's fastest goal in a Champions League final, and the fourth fastest in a Champions League final overall. In the 11th minute, Arturo Vidal of Juventus received the first yellow card for fouling Sergio Busquets. At half time, Barcelona led 1–0.\nTen minutes into the second half, Juventus equalised: Claudio Marchisio back-heeled the ball to right-back Stephan Lichtsteiner, who set up Carlos Tevez. Barcelona goalkeeper Marc-André ter Stegen blocked the shot from Tevez, but Álvaro Morata levelled the scores by putting the rebound into the net. In the 67th minute, Juventus appealed for a penalty when Paul Pogba went down in the area when challenged by Dani Alves, but the referee did not give it. Two minutes later, Barcelona took the lead again when Lionel Messi shot from the edge of the area, Gianluigi Buffon blocked it and Suárez put in the rebound. Soon after, Neymar put the ball into the net from Alba's cross, but it was disallowed as the referee deemed that Neymar had headed it into his own hand.\nIn the 78th minute, Barcelona substituted Iniesta, who gave his captain's armband to Xavi, making his 767th and final appearance for Barcelona. Soon after, Juventus made three substitutions in quick succession: Vidal was replaced with Roberto Pereyra and Morata with Fernando Llorente, while Evra made way for Kingsley Coman. In added time, Barcelona made their final two changes, as Rakitić made way for Jérémy Mathieu and the limping Suárez for Pedro.\nIn the final added minute, Alves handled the ball near the halfway line, and Juventus launched the resulting free kick towards the Barcelona goal, where it was cleared. The ensuing counter-attack ended with Pedro giving an assist to Neymar, who scored the final kick to make it 3–1.\nDetails.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nPost-match.\nWith the win, Barcelona became the first European club to achieve the treble twice. Their fifth European title put them joint third with Bayern Munich and Liverpool, until Liverpool won the 2019 final to achieve their sixth title. Bayern also went on to win their sixth trophy a year later, in the 2020 final. If only the Champions League era is considered, this is their fourth title, putting them joint first with Real Madrid. Madrid extended their lead by winning a fifth title in 2016 and, as of 2022, they have won eight titles in the Champions League era.\nOn the other hand, Juventus became the first team to lose six finals: they previously shared the record with Benfica and Bayern Munich. Patrice Evra became the first player to play in four losing UEFA Champions League finals, having previously been a runner-up in 2004 (with Monaco), 2009 and 2011 (both with Manchester United).\nNeymar's goal meant that three players shared the title of top scorer in the competition, alongside Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. He became the first player since Kaká in 2006–07 to be top scorer apart from those two. Messi was the top assister with six, with Ronaldo among the runners-up with four. After the final, both Messi and Ronaldo had a record 77 Champions League goals, but Ronaldo had one more if qualifiers were to be included.\nReactions.\nSpeaking to Canal+ after his final game for Barcelona, Xavi said he felt nostalgic knowing that he would never play for the team again, but deemed it \"incredible\" to win the Champions League in his last appearance. He admitted that Barcelona had been shaken by Juventus' equaliser, but had recovered through Messi doing \"his thing\". Xavi praised manager Luis Enrique for his successes despite his disputes with the club's board; there was uncertainty whether Luis Enrique would remain in his position for the following season.\nLuis Enrique called the final \"spectacular\", and his team's opponents \"absolutely top-level\". Of the Juventus team, he singled out Buffon for praise. In his own side, he commented that Neymar had gone from \"very, very good\" in his previous season, to \"spectacular\" in this one, ranking him among the world's best players. Luis Enrique stated that Suárez' performances had been worth the money Barcelona paid for him, despite initial doubt whether he would adapt to a new team. In spite of Barcelona's treble, the manager concluded that it had been \"a difficult year, a transitional year\".\nJuventus manager Massimiliano Allegri praised his team for their efforts, and said that despite a few regrets, they could exit with confidence from their performance. He commented that the team reaching the final had inspired the city of Turin and the whole of Italy. Allegri added that to improve on the season would not mean winning a treble, but remaining within Europe's top 8 teams for the future.\nSubsequent matches.\nAfter winning the final, Barcelona qualified for the 2015 UEFA Super Cup against compatriots Sevilla, winners of the 2014–15 UEFA Europa League. In the match on 11 August in Tbilisi, Georgia, Barcelona won 5–4 with Pedro scoring an extra-time winner. It was their fifth win in the competition, equalling Milan's record.\nIn December, Barcelona travelled to Japan as Europe's representative in the 2015 FIFA Club World Cup. They defeated China's Guangzhou Evergrande 3–0 in the semi-finals and River Plate of Argentina by the same score in the final. It was a record third win in the competition, and their fifth trophy of the calendar year."

        "title": "2014 Giro d'Italia",
        "text": "The 2014 Giro d'Italia was the 97th running of the Giro d'Italia, one of cycling's Grand Tour races.\nThe race started off in Belfast, on 9 May, with a team time trial and concluded in Trieste, on 1 June, with a flat stage. A total of 198 riders from 22 teams entered the 21-stage race, which was won by Colombian Nairo Quintana of the team. The second and third places were taken by Colombian Rigoberto Urán and Italian Fabio Aru, respectively.\nQuintana became the first Colombian to win the Giro. He won the secondary young rider classification. In the other classifications, rider Nacer Bouhanni was the winner of the points classification and 's Julián Arredondo won the Mountains classification. finished as the winners of the team classification, while won the team points classification. This was also the first grand tour where non-Europeans led for the entire race, with a Canadian, two Australians, and two Colombians wearing the Pink jersey.\nTeams.\nAll eighteen UCI ProTeams were automatically invited and were obliged to attend the race. As the winners of the 2013 Coppa Italia rankings for Italian teams, were invited to the race in October 2013. In January 2014, the three remaining wildcard places were decided by a vote on social media, from a shortlist of eight UCI Professional Continental teams. The places were later awarded to the , and squads.\nThe 22 teams that competed in the race were:\nPre-race favourites.\nBefore the start of a race, Nairo Quintana, Joaquim Rodríguez, Cadel Evans, Rigoberto Urán were among the main favourites for overall victory. Other possible contenders were Domenico Pozzovivo, Michele Scarponi, Dan Martin, Ivan Basso, Rafał Majka and Przemysław Niemiec.\nStages.\nThe 2014 Giro has its stages categorized into five different categories, named A to E. The category of a stage determines the points given for the points classification, and for the maximum time allowed for cyclists to finish the stage. Category A is reserved for the flattest stages, while category D is for the stages with the highest mountains. Category E is for time-trial stages.\nIt started in Belfast on 9 May 2014 and traveled across both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. There were three rest days instead of the usual two and the race started on a Friday.\nClassification leadership.\nIn the 2014 Giro d'Italia, four different jerseys were awarded. For the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage, and allowing time bonuses (10, 6 and 4 seconds respectively) for the first three finishers on mass-start stages, the leader received a pink jersey. This classification is considered the most important of the Giro d'Italia, and the winner is considered the winner of the Giro.\nAdditionally, there was a points classification, awarding a red jersey. In the points classification, cyclists received points for finishing in the top 15 in a stage. Unlike in the better known points classification in the Tour de France, the type of stage has no effect on what points were on offer – each stage had the same points available on the same scale. The winner earned 25 points, second place earned 20 points, third 16, fourth 14, fifth 12, sixth 10, and one point fewer per place down to a single point for 15th. In addition, points could be won in intermediate sprints.\nThere was a mountains classification, the leadership of which was marked by a blue jersey. In the mountains classifications, points were won by reaching the top of a climb before other cyclists. Each climb was categorized as either first, second, third, or fourth-category, with more points available for the higher-categorized climbs. The \"Cima Coppi\", the race's highest point of elevation, was worth still more points than the other first-category climbs. The fourth jersey represents the young rider classification, marked by a white jersey. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders born after 1 January 1989 were eligible.\nThere were two classifications for teams. In the Trofeo Fast Team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time; the Trofeo Super Team was a team points classification, with the top 20 placed riders on each stage earning points (20 for first place, 19 for second place and so on, down to a single point for 20th) for their team.\nThe rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run.\nFinal standings.\nMinor classifications.\nOther less well-known classifications, whose leaders do not receive a special jersey, were awarded during the Giro. These awards are based on points earned throughout the three weeks of the tour. Each mass-start stage has one intermediate sprint, the \"Traguardi Volante\", or T.V. The T.V. sprints give bonus seconds towards the general classification, points towards the regular points classification, and also points towards the T.V. classification. This award was known by various names in previous years, and was previously time-based. It was won by Italian Marco Bandiera. The \"Premio della Fuga\", rewards riders who take part in breakaways at the head of the field. Each rider in an escape of ten or fewer riders receives one point for each kilometre that the group stayed clear. Andrea Fedi won this classification.\nOther awards include the Fighting Spirit (Combativity classification), which is a compilation of points gained for position on crossing intermediate sprints, mountain passes and stage finishes. This classification was won by Julián Arredondo. The Azzurri d'Italia classification is based on finishing order, but points were awarded only to the top three finishers in each stage. It was won by Frenchman Nacer Bouhanni. Teams take part in the Fair Play classification where teams are given penalty points for minor technical infringements. This was won by . A new classification, the Energy Prize classification was introduced this year and awarded points to the rider with the fastest time in those last 3 km gets 4 points, the second 2 points and the third one point. The first winner of this was Enrico Battaglin."

It has been held every year since the NEC was established in the 1981–82 season. The tournament is an eight-team single-elimination tournament and seeding is based on regular season records. The bracket is reseeded after the quarterfinals, with the highest remaining seed playing the lowest remaining seed in the semifinals. The tournament winner receives the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA basketball tournament.\nRobert Morris, which left the NEC in 2020 for the Horizon League, is the program that has won the most NEC Tournament Championships (9), followed by current NEC members LIU (6) and Fairleigh Dickinson (6) as well as Mount St. Mary's (also 6), which left the NEC in 2022 for the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference. LIU, which before 2019–20 represented only the university's Brooklyn campus, has been the only program to win three consecutive tournament championships, from 2011–2013. Robert Morris won back-to-back championships on three occasions (1982–83, 1989–90 and 2009–10), the only other programs to win back-to-back championships, Marist and Rider, are also no longer members of the NEC. Of the current conference members (9 programs), three have not won a championship. Sacred Heart has participated in all NEC tournaments since joining the conference; Le Moyne and Stonehill have yet to participate.\nThrough the 2022 tournament, schools transitioning from NCAA Division II were ineligible for the conference tournament, paralleling NCAA policy that prohibits such schools from NCAA-sponsored postseason play (either the NCAA tournament or the NIT). After the 2021–22 season, the NEC presidents voted to allow transitional members to participate in the NEC tournament starting with the third season of their four-year transition. Merrimack, which joined the NEC in 2019–20, was thus eligible for the 2023 tournament, its last before completing its D-I transition. Stonehill, a 2022–23 arrival, was only in its first transition year and, therefore not eligible to participate in the 2023 NEC tournament. Under the 2022 rule, should a transitional program win the conference tournament, the automatic NCAA tournament bid went to the other finalist.\nEffective for the 2023–24 academic year, NEC teams transitioning from Division II are eligible for the NEC tournament during the entirety of their transition periods. If a reclassifying institution wins the NEC tournament championship, the tournament runner-up will be awarded the NEC's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. If two reclassifying teams reach the final of the NEC tournament, the conference will stage an automatic qualifier game between the two non-advancing semifinalists. The rule change resulted in Stonehill and Le Moyne being eligible for the 2024 NEC tournament, since that was Stonehill's second transition year and Le Moyne's first. Similarly, Mercyhurst, which joins the NEC from Division II in July 2024, will be eligible for the 2025 NEC tournament.\nChampionships by school.\nChicago State and Mercyhurst will play their first NEC seasons in 2024–25."

        "text": "The La Liga Argentina de Básquet (abbreviated \"LLA\", and literally in English \"The Argentine Basketball League\"), previously known as the Torneo Nacional de Ascenso (abbreviated \"TNA\", and literally in English \"National Promotion Tournament\") is the second division of the Argentine basketball league system. The La Liga's predecessor is the Torneo Federal de Básquetbol, which became the third division when the LLA was created in 1992.\nCompetition format.\nLa Liga Argentina consists of 28 teams, which are divided into four Divisions: North Center North, South, and Center South, with 7 teams per zone. The competition format is similar to that of Liga A, with a regular season divided into two stages. In the first stage, teams from the same division compete in a double round-robin format, with standings determined by a points system. Teams from the Center North and South Divisions will play two extra inter-zone matches.\nAfter the first phase, each team carries over 100% of the points obtained to the second stage. In the second stage, two Conferences (North and South) are formed uniting the four divisions, so each Conference has a total of 13 teams each. A new double round-robin series of matches take place, with the final standings in each conference determined by the same points system of the first stage.\nThe final stage of the tournament follows a playoff format. The top four teams from each Conference advance directly to the Conference quarterfinals, while the teams ranked from 5th to 12th place in each Conference compete in a separate bracket to allocate the remaining berths for the Conference quarterfinals. Every series in this final stage follow a best-of-five format. The winning team of the Finals will earn a spot in the top tier the following year."

Cross previously worked in tourism and owned a number of souvenir shops in Devon. He had also made business deals with other shops in the United Kingdom before retiring to work on a part-time basis.\nRugby history.\nCross had previously played rugby for Teignmouth R.F.C. and Torquay RFC. In 1996, Cross attended the Olympics in Atlanta, United States while wearing a Union Flag costume; he received a measure of publicity for it. Later in the year, he wore the costume to an England match at Twickenham Stadium in London. Two years later, he changed the costume to be based on the Flag of England as he felt that the Union Flag was not right for use at Twickenham. The year afterwards, he received a phone call from the Rugby Football Union inviting Cross to become the first official mascot of the England team because they had seen him in his costume. He made his official debut in 2000 against Australia.\nIn 2006, the RFU commissioned a teddy bear based on Cross to be sold as official England merchandise. 5,000 were produced and they sold out within a season. Cross uses his position to compete in charity fundraisers. In 2007, Cross later acted in a Greene King IPA advert for the RFU.\nCostume.\nWhen at England matches, Cross wears a top hat with the St. George's Cross on it as well as a white and red tail coat with a red rose and lapel pins on the lapel. Cross also carries a bulldog toy which is placed on the touchline at matches at Twickenham."

        "text": "Lee Dong-jun (born Daniel Sandrin; 27 January 1980) is an American-born South Korean basketball player.\nCareer.\nLee began his basketball career playing for the University of Portland in the 1998–1999 season, appearing in eight games and scoring an average of 1 points. He transferred to Seattle Pacific University in 2000. After his graduation, he went on to play on professional teams in Luxembourg and Germany before coming to South Korea in 2006.\nIn South Korea, Lee joined Yonsei University's team in March 2006. Lee's participation in university basketball was controversial because he was not a South Korean citizen and he had previously played in professional leagues in Europe. Even after he naturalised, Korea University continued to object to his participation due to his professional experience; after he was ruled ineligible, a physical altercation broke out at a September 2006 match between Yonsei University and Korea University. Coming to South Korea was a difficult adjustment for Lee in terms of culture and language. Philippine Olympic Committee president Monico Puentevella stated in media interviews that Sandrin had told him \"he couldn’t relate with the Koreans because they hardly speak English … he felt more comfortable with our team. Nevertheless, Lee stated that he relished the opportunity to live in the country and learn more about his roots.\nLee would go on to play professionally in the Korean Basketball League for the Daegu Orions. He later moved to the Seoul Samsung Thunders. In January 2013 he and elder brother Lee Seung-jun were booked on assault charges in Mapo District, leading to controversy over whether they should be permitted to play in the then-ongoing KBL All-Star Games.\nOn 21 November 2016, it was announced that Lee would serve as one of two Alab Pilipinas' world imports together with his brother Lee Seung-jun.\nPersonal life.\nLee was born into a basketball family: his father was an avid player, and taught the game to Lee's older brother and then to Lee himself. He graduated from Bothell High School in 1998 before going on to the University of Portland and then Seattle Pacific University. He naturalised as a South Korean citizen in June 2006, relinquishing his U.S. citizenship in the process. His elder brother Eric Sandrin followed him to South Korea and in 2009 also naturalised as a South Korean citizen, changing his name to Lee Seung-jun."

        "text": "Richard James Conway (22 April 1935 – 25 May 2022), also known as Red Conway, was a New Zealand rugby union player. He played ten tests for the New Zealand national team, the All Blacks, between 1959 and 1965 at number 8 or flanker. In 1960, he had a finger amputated so he could take part in a tour of Australia and South Africa.\nEarly life.\nConway was born in Whakatāne on 22 April 1935, and educated at Whakatane High School, where he played as a hooker. As well as playing rugby, Conway played softball as a catcher in the summer, and represented Rotorua in 1956.\nRugby union career.\nConway was small for a loose forward, standing tall and weighing , but was known as a dynamic tackler.\nProvincial.\nConway made his provincial debut for Otago, where he spent several winters, in 1957. He went on to play 72 games for Bay of Plenty from 1962 to 1968, and was captain of the team.\nInternational.\nConway debuted for the All Blacks in 1959, playing the second test against the touring British Lions. The first test had resulted in a New Zealand win, but was described as \"New Zealand's saddest victory\" by some in the press due to the Lions' outscoring the home team four tries to none.\nA persistent finger injury incurred from playing as a softball catcher put Conway's 1960 tour of South Africa in doubt. The damage occurred to his third finger on his right hand after it was broken while trying to catch a foul ball. After the break mended the finger retained a kink and he was told by a specialist that if he kept playing rugby the finger would keep breaking. To keep his spot on the tour Conway decided have the finger amputated after the final selection trial. He was not selected for the All Blacks for five years following the tour until 1965, when he was recalled for four tests against South Africa. He played an important role in securing a 3–1 series victory. That was his last game for the All Blacks, although he did play in a \"The Rest\" team against them the next year.\nLater life and death.\nConway worked as a carpenter, and he coached rugby at club level in Whakatāne during the 1970s.\nHe died in Whakatāne on 25 May 2022, aged 87."

He was a finalist at the 1946 US Open in the Men's Doubles where along with Don McNeill he lost 3–6, 6–4, 2–6, 6–3, 20–18 to William Talbert and Gardnar Mulloy.\nFrank Guernsey was born on 19 January 1917, in Orlando, Florida, to Frank Drummond Guernsey and Anita McChesney Guernsey.\nIn 1938 and 1939 Guernsey won the NCAA Men's Tennis Championship singles title playing for Rice University. In 1939 he won the singles title at the River Oaks Invitational Tournament, a reasonably prestigious tournament at the time. In 1941 he and Don McNeil won the National Indoor Doubles Championship, defeating Jack Kramer and Bobby Riggs in the final. Also in 1941, he partnered with Bobby Riggs to win the River Oaks Doubles Championship, beating Jack Kramer and Ted Schroeder in the final. He was enlisted in the Rice University Hall of Fame in 1941. In 1946 he and Don McNeil successfully defended their National Indoor Doubles Championship, this time defeating Pancho Segura and Alejo Russell in the final.\nIn April 1941 Guernsey signed up for the United States Army Air Force (USAAF) and was sent to California for fighter pilot training. In 1942 he was dispatched to Alaska and took part in the Aleutian Campaign. In 1943 he trained Air Force pilots in Florida. In 1944 Guernsey was transferred to the 8th Air Force in England where he flew support missions for bombing campaigns and was credited with shooting down two German enemy planes. He received the Distinguished Flying Cross and Air Medal with five oak leaf clusters. During his service he flew P-39, P-40, and P-47 fighter planes.\nIn 1989 he was inducted into the Men's Collegiate Tennis Hall of Fame."

        "title": "Yale Rugby",
        "text": "The Yale Bulldogs Rugby Team, or simply, Yale Rugby is the rugby union team of the Yale University. Yale has fielded a team that has played using the rugby rules since at least 1876. The school competes in the Ivy Rugby Conference and in Division I-AA of USA Rugby's intercollegiate competition. The YRFC plays a fall and spring schedule, which includes both a 15s and a 7s program. The team has approximately 45 players and is coached by Head Coach, Craig Wilson and Assistant Coaches Brad Dufek, Alycia Washington and Greg McWilliams.\nTeams.\nMen's team.\nYale Rugby was founded in 1875, making it one of the oldest rugby teams in North America. The date refers to the first Harvard vs Yale contest held in 1875, two years after the inaugural Princeton–Yale football contest. Harvard athlete Nathaniel Curtis challenged Yale's captain, William Arnold to a rugby-style game. The next season Curtis was captain. He took one look at Walter Camp, then only 156 pounds, and told Yale captain Gene Baker \"You don't mean to let that child play, do you? . . . He will get hurt.\"\nThe two teams agreed to play under a set of rules called the \"Concessionary Rules\", which involved Harvard conceding something to Yale's soccer and Yale conceding a great deal to Harvard's rugby. The game featured a round ball instead of a rugby-style oblong ball, and caused Yale to drop association football in favor of rugby.\nThough it was not a founding member of the Intercollegiate Football Association (\"IFA\"), which agreed on November 23, 1876 to play using the rugby union code, Yale often played per those rules as its competition agreed to use the rugby union code rules. Yale played on November 30, 1876, the very first Thanksgiving game using the rugby union code. This game was played against Princeton exactly one week after Princeton agreed to play abiding by IFA rugby union code. By 1879 Yale had joined peer schools Princeton Rugby and Harvard Rugby to be a member of IFA and play all its games per rugby union code (as slightly modified from time to time by IFA).\nBy 1893, forty thousand (40,000) spectators showed up to watch Yale play Princeton on Thanksgiving in New York’s Manhattan Field. The game Yale and Princeton played on Thanksgiving of 1893 was much closer to rugby than American football as there were no forward passes (as such rule was not established for another dozen or so years when Walter Camp, a Yale Alumnus and rugby player, worked with University of Pennsylvania alumnus and rugby player John Heisman to change the rules of 19th century college rugby to create American Football).\nYale Rugby's Walter Camp was leader of a handful of former rugby players to change the rules in last decade of 19th Century and first decade of 20th Century to add additional rule innovations like the snap and downs, which had begun to distinguish the American game from rugby.\nYale Rugby, along with the Harvard and Princeton Rugby teams, began the tradition of U.S. college students going on Spring Break athletic tours in the Caribbean.\nWomen's team.\nThe Yale Women's Rugby Football Club was founded in 1978. Yale head coach Craig Wilson began as the coach of Yale's women's squad and assistant to the Men's team before taking on the head coach role of both teams in fall 2019.\nCups and competitions.\nIvy League regular season.\nThe first Ivy League Rugby Tournament Championship was played in 1969. In 2009, the men joined a newly established Ivy Rugby Conference that was formed to foster better competition among rugby teams from the Ivy League schools and to raise the quality of play. Ivy Rugby formed committees to manage the league independently of the Territorial Area Unions. The Ivy Rugby Conference, and specifically its sevens tournament, has enabled the Ivy schools to tap into existing rivalries and fan bases. The women began a full season of Ivy League play in the fall of 2011.\nThe Koranda Cup.\nThe Yale vs. Princeton rugby rivalry has strong historic roots dating back to the 1870s. In 2002, after many years of not playing Yale regularly, Princeton decided to re-establish the tradition and challenge Yale to an annual match each spring. The following year, Yale graciously accepted Princeton's request to make the match special for both teams by creating a trophy in memory of Rob Koranda. Rob died in a Chicago porch collapse in June 2003, a tragedy that claimed 12 other young lives. The 2019 cup currently sits in New Haven and will be challenged again in spring 2020.\nLas Vegas 7's Invitational.\nThe Yale team competes annually in the Las Vegas 7's tournament."

        "title": "Dartmouth Rugby",
        "text": "The Dartmouth Rugby Football Club (or Dartmouth Rugby) is the men's college rugby team of Dartmouth College. \nThe student-run club was founded in 1951, and competes in the Ivy Rugby Conference against its traditional Ivy League rivals. Current head coach and former assistant coach James Willocks took over the team in 2017, leading the club to the 2019 D1-AA Spring Championship, the club's first 15-a-side national title.\nHistory.\nThe predecessor sport to both rugby and American football at Dartmouth was an idiosyncratic ball game named \"Old Division\", which combined elements of soccer and rugby. The game pit teams of seniors and sophomores against juniors and freshmen, and was sufficiently popular to have slowed the development of football on the isolated campus. \nRugby was played on campus as early as 1875, when initial attempts were made to organize a team. In October 1875, Dartmouth declined an invitation to play a friendly against Tufts University as the students were \"not sufficiently versed in the rules to warrant their playing.\"\nIn a nod to the then-embryonic Harvard–Yale football rivalry, Dartmouth students erected the school's first goal posts in 1876. \nIn November 1880, the \"Dartmouth Rugby Foot-Ball Association\" was founded by Clarence Howland, Class of 1884. \nMen's team.\nThe Dartmouth rugby team comprises more than 100 students and often fields more than four sides on a given weekend during the fall term.\nOne of the strengths and strongest traditions of the two clubs are the Annual Tours, the first of which occurred during the 1958–1959 school year when Dartmouth rugby toured both England and Southern California. The former team was the first U.S. college rugby team to invade England (one English newspaper describing the event as \"the nastiest upset since Bunker Hill\"), and Sports Illustrated covered the 7-game tour in its January 19, 1959 issue. In 1962 DRFC toured in Ireland, and in 1964 the team toured both Germany and Scotland. Since 2000, the teams tours have included trips to England, Ireland, Italy, Spain, South Africa, Argentina, and Uruguay.\nDartmouth has enjoyed success on a national stage. In 1965, the first XV was undefeated and was declared the unofficial national collegiate champion. More recently, since 1980 Dartmouth has twice reached the finals of the US national collegiate championship and has reached the semi-finals three times. In 2011 and 2012, former head coach Alex Magleby led Dartmouth to back-to-back rugby sevens national titles in the Collegiate Rugby Championship.\nWomen's team.\nDartmouth also has a women's team, the DWRC, which was founded in 1978. Dartmouth women's rugby team was promoted to varsity status in 2015. The promotion to varsity was aided in part by the NCAA's commitment to contribute towards the varsity program's annual costs. Dartmouth women's rugby became the third Ivy League varsity rugby program following Harvard (2013) and Brown (2014), and if five Ivy League schools recognize their teams as varsity they can compete for an official Ivy League championship.\nDartmouth women's rugby had previously unsuccessfully applied for varsity status in 2012.\nDWRC has produced numerous USA Eagles National Team Players and All-Americans. Women’s rugby is led by head coach Katie Dowty.\nCups and competitions.\nCRC 7s.\nDartmouth has been successful in national rugby sevens competitions. In 2011, Dartmouth defeated Army 32-10 for the men's championship in the Collegiate Rugby Championship in a match broadcast live on NBC from PPL Park in Philadelphia. Dartmouth repeated as champions in the 2012 Collegiate Rugby Championship, defeating Cal 21-19 in the semifinal and beating Arizona 24-5 in the final. Dartmouth went 5-1 at the 2012 USA Rugby Sevens Collegiate National Championships to win the consolation bracket.\nIvy League Rugby.\nDartmouth has also enjoyed success in Ivy League competitions. Dartmouth has won the Ivy League cup 12 times since it was established in 1969, including 5 consecutive championships from 1998 to 2002 and 6 consecutive championships from 2008 to 2013. In November 2011 the team captured the Ivy League Sevens Championship. Dartmouth first won the New England Championship in 1980 and has repeated numerous times. The Dartmouth Women's Rugby Club (or DWRC) has won nine Ivy League titles.\nVarsity Cup.\nDartmouth is one of a few select colleges to be selected to play in the Varsity Cup collegiate rugby championship. In 2013 Dartmouth was the #3 seed, behind perennially strong opponents BYU and Cal.\nFacilities.\nCorey Ford Clubhouse.\nThe clubs dedicated the Corey Ford Rugby Clubhouse in September 2005 with matches against Army (DRFC) and Radcliffe. The Clubhouse — which is considered one of the best college rugby facilities in the country — was built into the hillside at the halfway line of Battle Field and Brophy Field, which are separated by a twenty-foot bank. Spectators view games from the deck of the Clubhouse and from the hillside that runs the length of the fields."

The Bulldogs (also informally referred to as the Zags) were in their 34th season as a member of the West Coast Conference, and were led by head coach Mark Few, who is in his 15th season as head coach. They finished the season 29–7, 15–3 in WCC play to be WCC regular season champions. They were also champions of the WCC tournament to earn an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament.

He was selected by the Giants in the third round of the 1989 NFL draft and played college football at LSU.\nPlaying career.\nIn 1994, he took over from Wes Hopkins as the starting free safety of the Philadelphia Eagles, and played there the following year, until he was replaced by rookie Brian Dawkins. Jackson is also known for making the tackle against Emmitt Smith that sprained his shoulder in the final regular season game of the 1993 season. Smith went on to account for 229 total yards with said shoulder injury, giving the Cowboys a much needed first round bye in the playoffs on their way to a second straight Super Bowl, Super Bowl XXVIII.

        "title": "Jim Foster (basketball)",
        "text": "Jim Foster (born October 16, 1948) is a former American basketball coach who served as the head coach of the women's college basketball team at Chattanooga from 2013 to 2018. He has previously served as a head coach of the women's basketball team at St. Joseph's, Vanderbilt and Ohio State. He has been elected to the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame as a member of the class of 2013. On February 1, 2018, Foster notched his 900th career win as a head coach, becoming the eighth fastest to reach that mark and tying for seventh in all-time career wins. He announced his retirement in May 2018, after 40 years on the bench.\nEarly years.\nFoster was born October 16, 1948 in Abington, Pennsylvania. He grew up in Cheltenham, Pennsylvania, and attended Cardinal Dougherty High School in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He joined the Army in 1966, and served until 1969, with half of that time spent in Vietnam. While he was serving, his brother, John was drafted. Although Jim's tour was scheduled to end, he agreed to serve an additional tour in Vietnam so his brother would not have to serve in a war zone. After completing his tours, Foster attended Temple University, graduating in 1980.\nCoaching career.\nFoster began his coaching career at Bishop McDevitt High School in Cheltenham Township, Pennsylvania, where he served as the boys basketball assistant coach and the girls basketball head coach.\nSaint Joseph's University.\nFoster began his college head coaching career as the head coach at St. Joseph's in 1978. He remained as head coach for 13 seasons, compiling a record of 248–126. In 1985, the Hawks won seven of their eight Atlantic Ten games to win the conference title. They won 25 games during the season to earn their first ever bid to an NCAA tournament. This bid would be the first of six consecutive bids to the NCAA Tournament.\nVanderbilt.\nFoster accepted a position as head coach of the women's basketball team at Vanderbilt in 1991. He remained there for eleven seasons, compiling a record of 256–99. He made the Elite Eight five times during his tenure with the Commodores, including a trip to the 1993 Final Four. To date this remains the only Final Four appearance by a Vanderbilt basketball team.\nWhile at Vanderbilt, Foster served a one-year term as President of the Women's Basketball Coaches Association.\nOhio State.\nFoster became the head coach of the women's basketball team at Ohio State in 2002. He served in that position for eleven years, with a record of 279–82. While at Ohio State, the Big Ten selected Foster as the women's basketball coach of the year three consecutive years, 2005–2007 and again in 2009. Foster was fired by Ohio State at the end of the 2012–2013 season after his team did not make the NCAA tournament. Kevin McGuff was hired as his replacement.\nOhio State played Notre Dame in the first-ever women's basketball game played on an aircraft carrier. The game was played on the , now a National Historic Landmark in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. The Yorktown served in Vietnam while Foster was serving in Vietnam. Notre Dame won the game, 57–51.\nChattanooga.\nOn May 9, 2013, Chattanooga announced the hiring of Foster to become the new head coach of the women's basketball team. In April 2016, Chattanooga announced that Foster's contract had been extended through the 2021–22 season, although he decided to retire in May 2018.\nUSA basketball.\nFoster served as assistant coach or head coach of USA Basketball teams on nine occasions, and served (2013–16) as the chair of the Women's Junior National Team Committee.\nIn 1987, he was the assistant coach of the gold medal-winning 1987 Olympic Festival women's basketball team. In 1989 he was the assistant coach of the USA representative at the World Junior Championships in Bilbao, Spain (now called U19). In 1990, he was an assistant coach under Theresa Grentz for the USA National team at the World Championships in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The team, behind the 22 point per game scoring of Teresa Edwards, won all eight contests, with only the win over Cuba decided by single digits. The USA team faced Yugoslavia in the gold medal game, and won 88–78. The same team returned to Seattle, Washington, for the 1990 Goodwill Games. The team hadn't lost a game in the last 36 games, but they struggled in the opening game against South Korea. They were trailing after more than eleven minutes played before going on a run to take a commanding lead. The next opponent was the USSR, who led at halftime, before the USA took over in the second half. The USA team then won two games easily, and faced the USSR again for the gold medal. This time, the USA took at ten point lead in the first half, opened the second half with a 16–1 run and held on to win 82–70.\nIn 1991, Foster had his first USA experience as a head coach, with the Junior Select Team, coaching the team to a 5–1 record. In 1992, he returned to his role as an assistant under Grentz, when the USA National team went to the Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. The team only suffered one loss but it was a 79–73 loss in the medal round to the Unified team (the countries of the former Soviet Union). The team won the final game against Cuba to earn the bronze medal.\nFoster took over the head coaching duties of the USA Women's Junior World Championship Team in 1993. The Championship was held in Seoul, South Korea. The USA team lost to host South Korea, but then won three games to stay in contention for the medal round. At the end of preliminary play, the USA team, with a 4–1 record, was in a three-way tie for two medal round positions. The tie-breaking rule was based upon point differential, and the USA team was third behind South Korea and Russia. The USA team then lost a one-point game to France, and recovered to beat Japan in the final game. The team ended with an overall record of 5–2, but this was only good enough for seventh place.\nIn 1997, Foster was named head coach of the USA representative to the World University Games, held in Marsala, Sicily, Italy. The USA team had not won gold in this biennial event since 1991. This year, the USA team would be dominant, with easy victories in all but one contest. After winning their first three contests by no fewer than 38 points, the USA team faced Russia. The game had five ties and 13 lead changes. Connecticut's Nykesha Sales led the scoring of the USA team with 17 points, hitting connective baskets in the second half to give the USA a lead it would not give up. The USA went on to win the game 78–70. The USA went on to win the two medal rounds games, with a 100–82 victory over Cuba to give the USA team the gold medal.\nIn 2003, Foster was named head of the USA team competing at the FIBA World Championship For Young Women (also known as the U21 Women's World Championship) held in Šibenik, Croatia. After winning their first two games, the USA team lost to Brazil 73–60. The USA team went on to win their next games, and qualified for the medal round. The semifinal game was against France, their opponent in the first game, That game had been close, with the USA winning by a score of 56–48. This game would also be close, with the USA winning 58–47 to advance to the gold medal game in a rematch against Brazil. The USA team started out much better, and had a 50–31 margin early in the second half, but Brazil went on a run and cut the lead to seven points with a little over a minute left in the third quarter. Neither team scored for several minutes into the fourth quarter, but the USA finally out together a run, and won the game 71–55 to win the gold medal.\nFoster now has been part of the coaching staff of five gold medal teams and one bronze medal team for the US, with an overall record of 27–4.\nHall of Fame.\nFoster was inducted in the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame in June 2013. In his induction speech, he recalled meetings with Pat Summitt when the Hall of Fame was in the formative stages. His credentials include 35 years of head coaching experience at St. Joseph's, Vanderbilt, Ohio State and Chattanooga with a 71.8% lifetime winning percentage, along with four Big Ten Coach of the Year awards.\nHead coaching record.\nSources: St. Joseph's, Ohio State"

        "title": "List of baseball players who defected from Cuba",
        "text": "This is a list of baseball players who defected from Cuba, consisting of Cuban baseball players who have defected since the beginning of Fidel Castro's presidency.\nBackground.\nPrior to the Cuban Revolution, which saw Castro rise to power in 1959, Cuban-born players often played in the American Negro leagues and in Major League Baseball (MLB). Following the revolution, U.S.-Cuba relations became strained, and Castro ended professional baseball in Cuba (the Cuban League) and forbade Cuban players to play abroad.\nSome players defected during the Cold War. Rogelio Álvarez, who debuted in MLB in 1960, was barred from continuing his professional career in the United States, and defected from Cuba through Mexico in 1963. Bárbaro Garbey left Cuba in the Mariel boatlift in 1980. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Cuba's economy struggled badly and faced severe repercussions from the Embargo. Baseball players began to seek careers in MLB due to the high salaries. In 1991, René Arocha defected. He was followed by Rey Ordóñez in 1993. Rolando Arrojo defected during the 1996 Summer Olympics, which were held in the United States. The Cuban government treats attempted defectors as disloyal, which led to increased defections. Orlando Hernández was loyal to Cuba, until they banned him from the national team following the defection of his half-brother, Liván.\nPlayers attempting to play in MLB often choose not to defect to the United States or Canada, because establishing residency there subjects them to the Major League Baseball draft. By defecting to another nation, they can be considered international free agents.\nIn 2008, Joe Kehoskie, a former baseball agent who represented several dozen Cuban players, told author Michael Lewis, \"There’s at least half a billion dollars of baseball players in Cuba right now and probably a lot more.\" By the end of 2014, approximately 30 subsequent Cuban defectors had signed MLB contracts totaling just under $500 million.\nThe largest contract given to a Cuban defector was outfielder Rusney Castillo's seven-year contract with the Boston Red Sox, signed in 2014, worth $72.5 million. First baseman José Dariel Abreu signed a six-year contract worth $68 million with the Chicago White Sox in 2013. The largest contract given to a pitcher was the $32 million the New York Yankees gave to José Contreras in 2002, while the Cincinnati Reds signed Aroldis Chapman for $30.25 million in 2010.\nWhile some players who defected have obtained multimillion-dollar contracts to play in MLB, many received only minor-league contracts and did not reach MLB, and many others didn't sign contracts at all. Players who defect are often separated from their families, leading to severed relationships, such as between Jorge Toca and the mother of his son.\nIn late 2018, an agreement was reached between MLB, the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA), and the Baseball Federation of Cuba. The agreement created a legal path for Cuban baseball players to sign with MLB teams without having to defect. However, the Trump administration declared the agreement illegal and revoked it in April 2019. Since then, players have continued to defect, such as Lázaro Blanco in 2021."

        "text": "Harold Hunter Sr. (April 30, 1926 – March 7, 2013) was an American basketball coach and player. He became the first African American to sign a professional contract with a National Basketball Association (NBA) team when he joined the Washington Capitols on April 26, 1950. Hunter was cut from the team during training camp and never played for an NBA team. He later coached basketball for the United States men's national basketball team, Tennessee State University, and the U.S. Olympic basketball team.\nEarly life.\nHunter was born on April 30, 1926, in Kansas City, Kansas. He graduated from Sumner High School, now known as Sumner Academy of Arts &amp; Science, in 1944. The school, which had a top ten national ranking in science at the time, was the only all-black high school left in the city. In 2000, a group of Sumner alumni published a book on the history of the school, \"The Sumner Story,\" which focused on Hunter's career.\nHunter played as a guard for North Carolina College, now known as North Carolina Central University, in Durham, North Carolina. He is credited with helping the North Carolina Central men's basketball team win the 1950 Colored Intercollegiate Athletic Association Tournament championship and was named the most valuable player of the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association tournament that year.\nIn 1984 the university inducted Hunter into its Athletic Hall of Fame. The university also retired his basketball jersey in 2009 to mark the university's centennial. The Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association (CIAA) inducted him into its hall of fame in 1987.\nIn 1950, Harold Hunter was drafted during the 10th round of the 1950 NBA draft into the Washington Capitols basketball team. He signed a contract with the Capitols on April 26, 1950, the day after the draft, becoming the first African American player to sign a contract with any NBA basketball team. However, he was cut from the team during the Capitols' training camp and did not play professionally for any NBA team.\nCoaching career.\nHunter coached the boys and girls basketball teams at Williston School in Wilmington, North Carolina, during the 1950–51 season. He served as athletic director and coach of the football, basketball, track and tennis teams at P. S. Jones High School in Washington, North Carolina from 1952 to 1954. Hunter returned to Williston from 1954 to 1957. \nHunter served as an assistant coach for the Tigers basketball team from 1957 to 1959. In 1959, he became the head coach for the Tigers, succeeding outgoing coach John McLendon. He coached the Tigers for nine seasons from 1959 to 1968, leading the team to a 172–67 winning record, including four instances of more than twenty wins in a row. Seventeen of Hunter's Tennessee State players were drafted into the NBA. Hunter holds the record as the second-winningest men's basketball coach in Tennessee State's history.\nHunter became the first African American to coach the U.S. men's Olympic basketball team in 1968, leading them during their tour of the Soviet Union and Europe. He took the U.S. team to a victory over the Soviet national basketball team in a game held in Minsk, present-day Belarus.\nHunter also became the first African American to lead both men's and women's teams to the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) national basketball tournament. He later coached both men's and women's college basketball at Xavier University of Louisiana from May 1974 to 1977; as an assistant coach for Dillard University's women's team under head coach Mary Teamer during the 1980s; and at Southern University from 1986 to 1991. All of these schools are in New Orleans.\nHe began coaching Xavier's Gold Rush basketball team in May 1974 following the departure of previous coach Bob Hopkins. Under Hunter, the team placed 11–9 in the 1974–75 season (winning his first seven games with the team), 12–15 in the 1975–76 season, but only won six games during the 1976–77 season. He was succeeded as coach by Bernard Griffith in 1977. During his tenure, he encouraged his players to participate in charitable activities: In 1975, the team repainted the university's St. Michael's residence hall during summer break., and they played an exhibition game to benefit the Big Brothers of Greater New Orleans on November 8, 1975.\nRetirement.\nHunter and his wife, Jacqueline, resided in New Orleans after his retirement from coaching. They were forced to leave New Orleans and move to Tennessee after Hurricane Katrina struck and flooded the city in 2005.\nHunter was interviewed for the 2008 ESPN documentary, \"Black Magic\", which focused on early, pioneering basketball players from Historically Black Colleges and Universities in the United States.\nHarold Hunter died at his home in Hendersonville, Tennessee, at 6:55 a.m on March 7, 2013, at the age of 86. He was survived by his wife, Jacqueline T. Hunter, a biology faculty member at Xavier University of Louisiana; daughter, Micki; and son, Harold Jr."

After that season, the Spiders' full-time home of the Atlantic 10 Conference (A-10) established a men's lacrosse league, with Richmond as one of the six inaugural members. The Spiders play their home games at Robins Stadium and are currently coached by Dan Chemotti.\nHistory.\nStarting a program.\nIn September 2012, the University of Richmond announced a reconfiguration of its athletics program, discontinuing its men's soccer and men's track and field programs at the conclusion of the 2012–13 season and the elevation of men's lacrosse from club to varsity status at the NCAA Division I level starting in 2014. One month after revealing its plans to elevate men's lacrosse to varsity status, Richmond announced it had hired Dan Chemotti to lead the program. Chemotti, a former player and captain at Duke University, came to Richmond at the end of a five-year stint as an assistant at Loyola University, which won the Division I national championship in his final year on staff.\nIn February 2013, Richmond announced it would join the Atlantic Sun Conference, now known as the ASUN Conference, as an associate member for men's lacrosse when the program began play in 2014. The 2014 season would be the first year of men's lacrosse sponsorship for the Atlantic Sun, with full members Jacksonville and Mercer being joined by associate members Furman, High Point, Richmond, and VMI.\nUp and running.\nRichmond began play in the 2014 season, hosting No. 7 Virginia in front of 4,249 fans at Robins Stadium. Richmond held a halftime lead over the Cavaliers but ultimately fell, 13–12. Despite a strong showing against a high-quality opponent in their first-ever game, it took until the sixth game of the season for the Spiders to record the program's first victory, a 12–11 win over Vermont.\nRichmond went on to finish the regular season with a record of 4–10, but with an Atlantic Sun record of 2–3, the Spiders earned the fourth seed in the Atlantic Sun tournament held at the campus of No. 1 seed Mercer. Richmond upset Mercer in the semifinals, 14–6, before defeating No. 2 seed High Point, 8–7, to earn the Atlantic Sun's automatic bid to the 2014 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship. Richmond became the first first-year program in NCAA Division I history to qualify for the tournament.\nThe Spiders traveled to Air Force for one of two play-in games, where Richmond fell, 13–5.\nThe SoCon takes over.\nJust prior to the 2014 season, the Atlantic Sun Conference and the Southern Conference announced a partnership that would see the Southern Conference (SoCon) take over sponsorship of men's lacrosse as both Mercer and VMI joined the SoCon beginning in the 2014–15 academic year. With the addition of Bellarmine University, the 2015 SoCon season included seven programs.\nThe 2015 season saw the Spiders finish the regular season with a 10–4 record, with three of the four losses coming to nationally ranked teams. Richmond finished a perfect 6–0 in SoCon play, earning a conference championship and the top seed in the Southern Conference tournament, which was held at Robins Stadium. Richmond defeated Furman in the semifinals but fell to High Point in double overtime in the championship game, ending the Spiders' season.\n2016 saw the Southern Conference add Air Force as its eighth men's lacrosse program. The Spiders once again finished the regular season with a 10–4 record, placing second in the SoCon with a 6–1 record. Richmond's lone conference defeat was a 9–8 loss to Air Force, which claimed the regular season conference championship with a perfect 7–0 record. In the Southern Conference tournament once again held at Robins Stadium, the Spiders defeated No. 3 seed High Point before falling once again to Air Force, 9–8 in overtime.\nRichmond's fourth year as a program in 2017 saw the team finish the regular season with a record of 11–3 including a victory over defending national champions North Carolina and each of its three losses (Duke, Virginia, and Air Force) coming by a single goal. The Spiders finished 6–1 in SoCon play, earning a share of the regular season championship as part of a three-way tie with Air Force and Furman. Per the Southern Conference tie breaking criteria, Air Force received the number one seed in the conference tournament, while Richmond received the second seed and Furman the third seed. At the tournament, once again held at Robins Stadium, the Spiders defeated Furman in the semifinals before falling once more to Air Force, 9–6, to finish the season with a 12–4 record. Just prior to the start of the conference tournament, Richmond announced it had signed head coach Dan Chemotti to a new five-year contract.\nA-10 homecoming.\nSince at least the mid-2010s, Richmond's full-time home of the A-10 had been working toward establishing a men's lacrosse league. In the 2022 season, the conference had four full members that sponsored men's lacrosse (Richmond, St. Bonaventure, Saint Joseph's, and UMass), two short of the number required for an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. In February 2022, \"USA Lacrosse Magazine\" reported that the A-10 was evaluating Fairfield, High Point, and Hobart for associate membership in order to reach the required membership total. On May 23, 2022, the A-10 announced that it would establish a men's lacrosse league in the 2023 season, with the four full members joined by High Point and Hobart.\nSeason results.\nThe following is a list of Richmond's results by season as an NCAA Division I program:\n†NCAA canceled 2020 collegiate activities due to COVID-19."

Drexel currently competes as a member of the Colonial Athletic Association (CAA) and plays its home games at Vidas Field in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Drexel made its first NCAA tournament appearance in 2014, and a second NCAA tournament appearance in 2021.\nHistory.\nLacrosse was established at Drexel in 1941 under coach Maury McMains. At the time, the university was known as Drexel Institute of Technology. Drexel's first USILA All-American was Ray Greene, who after serving in World War II transferred to Johns Hopkins, where he became a Hall of Fame midfielder. Drexel's 1947 schedule included games against Syracuse, Johns Hopkins, Virginia, Penn State and Penn.\nThrough the 1950s, highlights included Drexel reaching as high as number six in the standings in 1952, finishing the year with a five and two record. In 1953, Dick Young achieved first-team All-American honors at midfield. Drexel in 1958 completed the season with an 8 and 2 record, including a win over a Lehigh team who would go on to win the \"Class C\" lacrosse national title the following year.\nIn 1967, Drexel lacrosse aligned with the Middle Atlantic Conference and in 1975 the East Coast Conference. During this era, Lynn Ferguson, a two-time All-American midfielder, was named an All-American in both football and lacrosse in the same year. Drexel reached the small college USILA tournaments in both 1972 and 1973, with records of 11–3 and 9–4, respectively. The 1972 season also included a 14 to 6 win over the innovative Morgan State Bears lacrosse team.\nIn 1978, Dennis Fink earned Drexel's first Division I All-America honor for lacrosse, was the first Drexel player to lead the nation in scoring with 98 points and currently ranks among the all-time leader in several Lacrosse records. Fink also led Drexel to their only ECC conference title, as well as a 10 and 2 record.\nDrexel would later realign with the North Atlantic Conference (1992) and the America East Conference (1997) before settling in the Colonial Athletic Association in 2002.\nThe 1998 men's lacrosse squad won eleven straight to begin the season, finished with twelve wins against two defeats, including a 14 to 10 defeat of top 20 Towson University, and a number 19 national ranking. In 2007, Drexel lacrosse defeated University of Virginia, ranked number one at the time and the defending National Champion, Drexel's first victory over a number one ranked Division I team in any sport.\nIn 2008 the Dragons set a school record with 13 wins, ranking as high as 10th in the nation and reaching the Colonial Tournament finals before losing 10–9 in overtime to Hofstra, narrowly missing out on an NCAA tournament bid. In 2010, the team reached their highest ever national ranking at number 7 in the nation following a win over then number three Notre Dame, the eventual NCAA Division I tournament runner up.\nIn 2014, Drexel scored in the third overtime as the Dragons came back from a three-goal deficit with five minutes to go in the game, to defeat Hofstra 11–10, win its first Colonial Athletic Association championship and earn their first NCAA tournament berth in lacrosse. In the first round of the tournament, the Dragons eliminated fourth seeded Penn by a score of 16–11. The highlight of the game was three consecutive goals by Drexel in a span of just over 11 seconds at the end of the first half. The Dragons moved on to the quarterfinals where they lost to Denver 15–6 at Delaware Stadium. Drexel was the first Pennsylvania based Division I college team to advance past the first round of the NCAAs since Penn reached the Final Four in 1988.\nPrior to 2014, Drexel had not appeared in any NCAA Lacrosse Tournaments, though the team did get invitations to the 1972 and 1973 USILA small college tournaments, and since then, they did make the 2021 NCAA Tournament.\nDrexel has had 46 lacrosse All-Americans since beginning the sport in 1941.\nIn 81 seasons, Drexel has an all-time record of 462 wins, 481 losses and 3 ties, 946 total games, winning percentage through the 2023 season."

The Golden Eagles play their home games at Valley Fields starting in 2016 and were formerly coached by Joe Amplo.\nHistory.\nStarting a program.\nMarquette started talking about adding a new program to its offerings in the summer of 2010. The athletic department eventually settled on lacrosse since the school lacked a spectator spring sport, and by September the move was approved by the Board of Trustees. The University partnered with former college head coach Dave Cottle, who led the search committee for the program's first coach. Marquette introduced former Hofstra assistant Joe Amplo as head coach on February 27, 2011.\n2015: Put on the map.\nThe first two years of play for the Golden Eagles went as expected. Marquette went 5–8 in its first season, earning the program's first victory on March 2, 2013 against Air Force, and 6–10 in the second season. It was 2015 when Amplo and his team started turning heads.\nMarquette started its season defeating two straight ranked opponents, No. 18/16 Lehigh and No. 17/19 Hofstra. On February 16 the Golden Eagles entered the media and coaches' top 20 for the first time in program history. They would move as high as 9th in the media poll.\nHowever, Marquette couldn't hold on down the stretch. Losses to Georgetown, Bellarmine, Notre Dame, Duke and Denver ended the Golden Eagles tournament hopes.\nTournament Time.\nDespite the strong 2015 season, Marquette hadn't accomplished its goal of making the NCAA Tournament. The team wouldn't have to wait much longer.\nAfter defeating Villanova in the first round of the BIG EAST tournament, the Golden Eagles shocked the lacrosse community on May 7, 2016, defeating then-No. 1 Denver 10-9 for the Golden Eagles' first BIG EAST title. The loss was the first for Denver in their three years of BIG EAST play and the Pioneers first home loss in 22 games. The win was only the second for a Marquette program over a top ranked team, and the first since the men's basketball team took down Kentucky in 2003. Liam Byrnes was named the tournament's most valuable player.\nThe win propelled the Golden Eagles from an on-the-bubble team to the sixth best seed and Marquette's first tournament appearance in just its fourth season of play. Marquette hosted its first NCAA Tournament game on May 14, 2016, a 10–9 loss to perennial powerhouse North Carolina. The Tar Heels would go on to defeat Maryland 14-13 in overtime for their first NCAA title since 1991.\nSeason results.\nThe following is a list of Marquette's results by season as an NCAA Division I program:"

        "text": "The Soul of Baseball: A Road Trip Through Buck O'Neil's America is a 2007 book written by Joe Posnanski about Buck O'Neil, an American professional baseball player in the Negro leagues during the 1940s and 1950s. O'Neil's contributions to the game of baseball and his love for the sport garnered national attention when he was featured in Ken Burns' 1994 documentary \"Baseball\".\nBook summary.\nPosnanski, a former baseball writer for \"Sports Illustrated\" and \"The Kansas City Star\" accompanied O'Neil on a 2006 cross-country journey to raise awareness of the Negro leagues. O'Neil, who was in his 90s during the trip, spent much of the time reminiscing with Posnanski about his experiences growing up in a segregated country, being denied the opportunity to attend high school in Florida because he was black, playing in the Negro leagues, and eventually breaking racial barriers in Major League Baseball as both a scout and a coach.\nOne of O'Neil's greatest achievements was working with the Baseball Hall of Fame to ensure proper recognition of former Negro league players, many of whom were later enshrined as a result of his efforts. O'Neil's own entry was considered by many to be assured, but at the book's end, O'Neil received news that the Hall of Fame decided not to induct him as a member.\nHis inclusion was denied by one vote, a decision that was characterized by one writer as \"... an act of stupidity and ignorance all of [the] committee members must live with forever.\"\nSoon after hearing the news, and shortly before Posnanski's book was published, O'Neil died at the age of 94.\nReviews.\nThe book was reviewed favorably in many newspapers and websites. Comments included:\n\"Posnanski masterfully conveys O'Neil's charisma and the rhythm of his words, which often read like free verse. The author trailed his subject as he traversed the country to rekindle interest in the talented players who pushed their way from state to state on rickety buses in an era when Major League Baseball excluded black players. O'Neil's unceasing efforts helped several Negro League stars get inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Despite being a good player, manager and scout in his own right—not to mention a tireless ambassador for the game—he fell one vote shy of election, an injustice decried by his admirers. But O'Neil was not bitter [and] saw goodness in the world despite having been deprived of numerous opportunities because of the color of his skin.\"\n\"A moving elegy for both the Negro Leagues and one of the game's biggest personalities.\"\n \"O'Neil was nearly one of the guys who died unknown. But in his final years, he became something of a celebrity after appearing prominently in Ken Burns' baseball series. He died as Posnanski was finishing the book, and it's one of the sadder deaths in all of print. But \"The Soul of Baseball\" is so warmly told, its stories alternately regretful and hysterical, its lessons too pure and uncynical, that the reader is left not broken, but joyful. After I turned the final page, I simply returned to Page 1 and began all over again.\"\nThe book won the 2007 Casey Award, an annual award given by \"Spitball Magazine\" to the literary world's best baseball book."

He spent his three-year professional career at Newcastle Falcons, alongside his brother, Jonny Wilkinson, predominantly playing as a Centre.\nCareer.\nEarly career.\nBorn in Wokingham, Wilkinson played for National League 3 North side Darlington Mowden Park during the 2001/02 season, making 20 appearances and scoring 3 tries.\n2002–2006.\nIn August 2002, Wilkinson signed for Newcastle Falcons, where his brother, Jonny, was captain. He made his professional debut against Leeds Carnegie, playing as centre, but unusually, for that position, wearing the 15 shirt. His performance drew praise from then-manager Rob Andrew, who stated \"It was a pretty big debut for someone who hasn't played higher than Third Division North before.\" He made his European Challenge Cup debut in a 27–8 defeat to Treviso, His first appearance at fly-half, would not prove successful, as Newcastle lost 20–0 against London Irish. By the end of that season, he had made six appearances in the league and five in the Challenge Cup. He would feature far less the following season, making just four league appearances and two in the European Challenge Cup, although he did score his first professional tries against Valladolid RAC in a 71–10 victory for the Falcons. He made five Premiership appearances in the 2004/05 season, with his Heineken Cup debut coming against Newport Gwent Dragons, playing at fly half in a 25–17 victory. 2005/06 would see him play just once, a brief appearance from the replacement's bench in a 27–18 defeat against Saracens.\nPost-retirement.\nIn 2006, Wilkinson retired from professional rugby, aged 28, to become the academy fitness and conditioning coach at Newcastle, at the same time Rob Bowen joined the club's academy. He remained in the post for three years, before departing the club in 2009. Two years after his departure, he started the Fineside clothing range alongside his brother."

        "text": "In June 2013, France played a three-test series against New Zealand as part of the 2013 mid-year rugby test series. This was the sides' first encounter since they met in the 2011 Rugby World Cup final, which New Zealand won 8–7. It was France's first test series against the All Blacks since their 2009 two-test tour of New Zealand, which ended in a 1–1 draw.\nThe tour began at the stadium where they last played each other, Eden Park in Auckland on 8 June. Following this, they played a mid-week match against the Auckland Super Rugby franchise, the Blues, at North Harbour Stadium in Auckland on 11 June. The second test was played in Christchurch at Rugby League Park on 15 June, and the third test at Yarrow Stadium in New Plymouth on 22 June.\nSquads.\nFrance.\nOn 14 May, head coach Philippe Saint-André named a 35-man squad for the fixtures against New Zealand and the Blues. The selection created controversy when South African-born prop Daniel Kötze and flank Bernard Le Roux and Fijian-born wing Noa Nakaitaci (qualifying on residency grounds) were chosen ahead of in-form French-born players. The most notable absentees were wing Vincent Clerc (injured with his club), captain and lock Pascal Papé (injured during the Six Nations Championship) and fly-half François Trinh-Duc (deemed out of form, with Camille Lopez and Rémi Talès chosen ahead of him).\nWing Alexis Palisson withdrew from the squad due to injury and was replaced with Marc Andreu prior to the first test. Injured during the first test, flank Fulgence Ouedraogo also withdrew from the tour and was replaced in the squad by Damien Chouly.\nHead coach: Philippe Saint-André\nNote*: Chouly joined the squad between the first two tests after Ouedraogo came off injured in the first test.\nNew Zealand.\nNew Zealand 32-man squad for the 2013 mid-year series to be played against France. The squad includes Matt Todd, who is included as injury cover for Sam Whitelock—who is not expected to be available until the third Test. All players play Super Rugby and provincial rugby within New Zealand.\nProp Joe Moody was added to the squad as prop cover should all the original props not be available for the first test.\nBackground.\nFollowing their later encounter in the 2011 Rugby World Cup final France and New Zealand had different fortunes.\nFrance, under the leadership of newly appointed head coach Philippe Saint-André, endured a mixed 2012 Six Nations Championship (ending 4th with 2 wins, 1 draw and 2 losses) which was the last outing of several key figures of the squad with the likes of Julien Bonnaire, Imanol Harinordoquy, Lionel Nallet, Jean-Baptiste Poux, Aurélien Rougerie, William Servat and Dimitri Yachvili playing their last games in the France jersey while only a couple of players (Wesley Fofana and Yoann Maestri) received their first caps. The Summer tour of Argentina then marked the rise of new players like Brice Dulin, Maxime Machenaud, Fofana and Maestri and saw the return in the mix of Thomas Domingo (who had missed on the World Cup due to injury), Yoann Huget (who had missed on the World Cup due to suspension) and Frédéric Michalak (back from his stint in Super Rugby after having fallen out of favour of French rugby) while experienced players like Vincent Clerc and Thierry Dusautoir were rested, the captaincy being handed to Pascal Papé. The Series was drawn 1-1. France then ended 2012 on a high with three straight wins in the Autumn Internationals over Australia, Argentina and Samoa, claiming the fourth spot in the IRB World Rankings which gave them First Seed status for the 2015 Rugby World Cup draw thus avoiding New Zealand, Australia and South Africa at pool stage. However the 2013 Six Nations Championship was a real disappointment as France ended up bottom of the table, claiming only one win and a draw with a squad that had not much evolved since the previous Summer - Antonie Claassen, Gaël Fickou, Jocelino Suta and Sébastien Vahaamahina being the only new caps while long-time absentees Mathieu Bastareaud and Yannick Nyanga were recalled. Philippe Saint-André stated that the Top 14 final being played just one week prior to the first test, players taking part in this final and thus joining the squad late would not feature in the first test.\nNew Zealand also started 2012 with a new head coach with former assistant coach Steve Hansen taking over Graham Henry's role. The All Blacks whitewashed Ireland during their Summer tour, winning the series 3-0 with a remarkable 60-0 victory in the third Test, their largest ever winning margin over Ireland. New Zealand followed with a perfect 2012 Rugby Championship - which featured Argentina for the first time - winning all six of their games. However their traditional Bledisloe Cup match in October put an end to their 16-game winning streak when they drew (18-18) with Australia. The All Blacks went on to hammer Scotland, Italy and Wales (scoring 30+ points each time) in the end-of-year tests before suffering their first defeat in two years at the hands of England on December 1. New Zealand however remained on top of the IRB World Rankings and were given Top Seed status for the 2015 Rugby World Cup. Starting in January 2013, stalwart All Blacks captain Richie McCaw was granted a six-month sabbatical from rugby to try and extend his career up to the 2015 World Cup. He has thus not taken any part in the 2013 Super Rugby campaign nor will he take part in the mid-year tests series against France. He is due to resume his international career in the 2013 Rugby Championship after a few stints with his Christchurch club side.\nMatches.\nNotes:\nNotes:\nAftermath.\nFollowing the tour the All Blacks went on to record a perfect 2013 Rugby Championship against Argentina, Australia and South Africa with six wins out of six matches for the second time in a row in as many instances of the competition.\nDuring the end-of-year internationals they went on to beat successively Australia, Japan, France, England and Ireland thus finishing 2013 undefeated with 14 wins out of 14 matches, the first national team to ever achieve this feat in the professional era.\nAfter suffering their fourth defeat at the hands of New Zealand in the same year in their first match of the end-of-year internationals, France overcame Tonga before losing to South Africa thus finishing the year with only two wins out of eleven matches.\nFrance then experienced a mixed 2014 Six Nations Championship with three wins (against England and Italy at home and Scotland away) and two losses (to Wales away and Ireland at home), ending up fourth.\nDuring the 2014 mid-year internationals New Zealand hosted England while France toured Australia."

        "title": "Tour de France records and statistics",
        "text": " \nThis is a list of records and statistics in the Tour de France, road cycling's premier competitive event.\nOne rider has been King of the Mountains, won the combination classification, combativity award, the points competition, and the Tour in the same year - Eddy Merckx in 1969, which was also the first year he participated. Had the young riders classification, which replaced the combination classification, existed at the time, Merckx would have won that jersey too. \nThe only rider to approach the feat of winning the green, polka dot and yellow jersey in the same Tour was Bernard Hinault in 1979, where he won the race and the points classification, but finished 2nd in the mountains competition. After Merckx in 1972 no other rider would win three distinctive jerseys in a single Tour until Tadej Pogačar in 2020, a feat he repeated the following year.\nTwice the Tour was won by a racer who never wore the yellow jersey until the race was over. In 1947, Jean Robic overturned a three-minute deficit on a 257 km final stage into Paris. In 1968, Jan Janssen of the Netherlands secured his win in the individual time trial on the last day.\nIn addition to 1947 and 1968, in 1989 Greg LeMond overcame a +:50 deficit to Laurent Fignon on the last day of the race in Paris to win the race on the final day, however Lemond had worn the yellow jersey earlier in the race. This was the final time the last stage in Paris was held as an individual time trial.\nThe Tour has been won four times by a racer who led the general classification on the first stage and held the lead all the way to Paris. Maurice Garin did it during the Tour's first edition, 1903; he repeated the feat the next year, but the results were nullified in response to widespread cheating. Ottavio Bottecchia completed a GC start-to-finish sweep in 1924. In 1928, Nicolas Frantz also led the GC for the entire race, and the final podium was made up of three riders from his Alcyon–Dunlop team. Lastly, Belgian Romain Maes took the lead in the first stage of the 1935 tour, and never gave it away. Similarly, there have been four tours in which a racer has taken over the GC lead on the second stage and held the lead all the way to Paris. After dominating the ITT during Stage 1B of the 1961 Tour de France Jacques Anquetil held the Maillot Jaune from the first day all the way to Paris.\nRené Pottier, Roger Lapébie, Sylvère Maes, Fausto Coppi and Bradley Wiggins all won the Tour de France the last time they appeared in the race.\nAppearances.\nBetween 1920 and 1985, Jules Deloffre (1885 – 1963) was the record holder for the highest number of Tour de France participations, with 14, and was sole holder of this record until 1966 with the fourteenth and last participation of André Darrigade. The record for most the appearances as of 2021 is held by Sylvain Chavanel, with 18. George Hincapie had held the mark for the most consecutive finishes with sixteen, having completed every Tour de France that he participated in except his first one, but was disqualified in October 2012 from the 2004, 2005 and 2006 editions of the race for his use of performance-enhancing drugs. Joop Zoetemelk and Chavanel jointly hold the record for the most finishes with sixteen each, with the former having completed all 16 of the Tours that he started. Zoetemelk also held the record for the most Tour de France stages completed with 365, a tally that was surpassed when Chavanel finished Stage 18 of the 2018 edition of the Tour. Chavanel's record now stands at 369.\n Zoetemelk currently holds the record for most kilometers ridden in Tour de France history at 62,885, a record which will be difficult to break considering the shorter stage lengths in modern Tours. Of the riders on this list only Van Impe (1976) and Zoetemelk (1980) have won the race.\nRiders who are still active are indicated in bold. \nSmallest winning margin.\nIn the early years of the Tour, cyclists rode individually, and were sometimes forbidden from riding together. This led to large gaps between the winner and the runner-up. Since the cyclists now tend to stay together in a peloton, the margins of the winner have become smaller, as the difference usually originates from time trials, breakaways or on mountain top finishes, or from being dropped by the peloton. In the table below, the ten smallest margins between the winner and the second placed cyclists at the end of the Tour are listed, all of them under one minute. The largest margin, by comparison, remains that of the first Tour in 1903: 2h 49m 45s between Maurice Garin and Lucien Pothier. \nCadel Evans is on this list twice, losing the 2007 and 2008 races by less than a minute; and he is just off this list for the 2011 edition, which he won by overturning a deficit during the final time trial claiming the victory by just 1:34 over Andy Schleck. The smallest margins between first and second placed riders are as follows.\nSuccessful breakaways.\nThe longest successful post-war breakaway by a single rider was by Albert Bourlon in the 1947 Tour de France. In the stage Carcassonne-Luchon, he stayed away for . It was one of seven breakaways longer than 200 km, the last being Thierry Marie's 234 km escape in 1991. Bourlon finished 16:30 ahead. This is one of the biggest time gaps but not the greatest. That record belongs to José Luis Viejo, who beat the peloton by 22:50 in the 1976 stage Montgenèvre-Manosque. He was the fourth and most recent rider to win a stage by more than 20 minutes. Another remarkable solo effort was Fons de Wolf during stage 14 of the 1984 Tour de France. He won the stage by 17:40 and actually came within a minute and a half of Tour favorite Laurent Fignon in the overall standings. He paid for his solo effort in the following stages, however, and fell back in the standings thereafter.\nOverall speed.\nThe 2022 edition was the fastest Tour de France in history. Jonas Vingegaard rode 3,349,8 km in 79h 33' 20\", thus realising an overall speed of 42.102 km/h (26.161 mph).\nThe slowest Tour de France was the edition of 1919, when Firmin Lambot's average speed was 24.1 km/h.\nStage speeds.\nThe fastest massed-start stage was in 1999 from Laval to Blois (194.5 km), won by Mario Cipollini at 50.4 km/h (31.32 mph). The fastest time-trial is Rohan Dennis's stage 1 of the 2015 Tour de France in Utrecht, won at an average pace of . The fastest stage win was by the 2013 Orica GreenEDGE team in a team time-trial. They completed the 25 km time-trial at 57.7 km/h (35.85 mph).\nThe fastest climb of Alpe d'Huez was by Marco Pantani in 1997 Tour de France at 23.1 km/h (14.35 mph).\nStage wins per rider.\nThe table below shows the top 26 riders who have won the most stages (including half-stages, excluding Team Time Trials). Riders who are still active are indicated in bold. Riders with the same number of stage wins are listed alphabetically.\nThree riders have won 8 stages in a single year:\nMark Cavendish has the most mass finish stage wins with 34 ahead of André Darrigade and André Leducq with 22, François Faber with 19 and Eddy Merckx with 18.\nThe youngest Tour de France stage winner is Fabio Battesini, who was 19 when he won stage 3 in the 1931 Tour de France. The oldest Tour de France stage winner is Pino Cerami, who won stage 9 of the 1963 edition at 41 years old.\nRiders who have won in all three specialties.\nThese riders have won mountain, sprint, and individual time trial stages in a single Tour.\nStage wins per country.\nRiders representing 33 countries have won at least one stage in the Tour de France.\nStage towns.\nSome cities and towns have hosted 25 or more stage starts and finishes:"

The exhibition is very lively from start to finish; the blows fall thick and fast, and some very clever pugilistic generalship is exhibited.”\nIn an analysis of boxing in the context of modernism, Irene Gammel argues that the scene’s “symmetry and beauty [gesture] towards the artfulness of boxing as a cultivated sport.” In addition, she argues that the women’s choreographed movement shows “their boldly modern female physicality and sportsmanship.”"

        "text": "John Joseph Fisher (born June 1, 1961) is an American businessman. He is the principal owner of the Oakland Athletics of Major League Baseball, the San Jose Earthquakes of Major League Soccer and the Texas Rattlers of the Professional Bull Riders organization. He is a former part-owner of the San Francisco Giants, having purchased a stake in the team in 1992 with his father as part of an investment group formed in an ultimately-successful effort to prevent the team from relocating to Tampa Bay, Florida. He sold that stake away in order to complete a sale to buy the Athletics. He is the son of Gap founders Donald Fisher and Doris F. Fisher.\nEarly life and education.\nFisher is the son of Doris Feigenbaum Fisher and Don Fisher, the co-founders of Gap, and inherited his fortune from them. Fisher attended Phillips Exeter Academy and Princeton University, where he received a bachelor's degree in 1983. After college, Fisher worked in the mailroom at the Republican National Committee and worked as a fundraiser for then-President Ronald Reagan and Vice President George H. W. Bush. He then attended graduate school at Stanford University School of Business, where he earned a master's degree in Business Administration.\nCareer.\nAfter graduate school, he took a job for a real estate company that did business with his parents' company, the Gap. The business was not successful and he became president of Pisces, the Fisher family's investment management company. \nIn 1992, John purchased a stake in the San Francisco Giants with his father, as part of a locally-formed investment group's effort to prevent the franchise from relocating to the Tampa Bay area. His father's memoir describes John as having been anxious about rumors in the early 1990s that the Giants could move to Florida. He told his father: \"I think we ought to try to put a deal together to keep the Giants here. Warren Hellman's interested in it, and so is Walter Shorenstein. We should be interested\". The investment group's effort was ultimately successful and the Giants stayed in San Francisco, opening a new bayfront ballpark in 2000 (now known as Oracle Park). Fisher retained a small ownership stake in the Giants \"so he could continue to monitor its financials\", according to his father, until 2005, when he was required to sell it upon becoming the owner of the Oakland Athletics.\nHe established a relationship with Lewis Wolff to jointly purchase several Fairmont hotels in San Francisco, which led to his investment in the Oakland Athletics of Major League Baseball. He also has stakes in the San Jose Earthquakes of Major League Soccer and Celtic, which competes in the Scottish Premiership.\nFisher has been the majority owner of the Athletics since he and Wolff closed on their joint purchase of the team in 2005, and is now also the managing general partner. In November 2016, Wolff sold his 10% share in the Athletics to Fisher, giving him full ownership of the team.\nIn April 2022, \"Forbes\" estimated his net worth to be $2.4 billion.\nOakland Athletics relocation to Las Vegas.\nIn April 2023, the Oakland Athletics announced a plan to build a new stadium on the Las Vegas Strip at the site of the former Wild Wild West Gambling Hall &amp; Hotel casino near Interstate 15, near the T-Mobile Arena, while also ending negotiations with the City of Oakland. After this, in a June 13 game against the Tampa Bay Rays, the crowd of 27,759 protested the relocation in an organized \"reverse boycott\" by wearing green \"Sell\" shirts, holding signs, and chanting \"Sell the team!\" during the game.\nPhilanthropy.\nFisher is a member of the board of directors for KIPP and co-chair of the Charter School Growth Fund.\nPolitical views.\nIn 2019, it was revealed that Fisher, with his mother Doris F. Fisher and brothers William S. Fisher and Robert J. Fisher, had donated nearly $9 million to a political action committee that opposed Barack Obama in the 2012 election. He has donated to Ohio rep. Mike Carey, a longtime coal lobbyist and supporter of President Donald J. Trump. In 2023, it was revealed Fisher had endorsed fellow billionaire and Republican Party candidate Doug Burgum for the 2024 US presidential election, having donated the maximum legal amount to Burgum's campaign.\nPersonal life.\nHe is married to Laura Meier Fisher. The couple lives in San Francisco. Fisher, who is Jewish, has two brothers: Robert J. Fisher and William S. Fisher."

        "text": "The 2013 Preakness Stakes was the 138th running of the Preakness Stakes thoroughbred horse race. The race was held on May 18, 2013, and was televised on NBC. The race was won by Oxbow. The post time of the race was EDT. The race was the 12th race on a card of 13 races. The Maryland Jockey Club reported total attendance of 117,203, the second highest attendance for American thoroughbred racing events in North America during 2013.\nPayout.\nThe 138th Preakness Payout Schedule\nField.\n2013 Kentucky Derby winner Orb as expected entered the Preakness. It was announced on May 6 that Vyjack and Normandy Invasion would also be starting in The Preakness. Other Derby starters confirmed for The Preakness are Goldencents (17th) and the D. Wayne Lukas trained duo of Oxbow (6th) and Will Take Charge (8th). Later connections of Vyjack and Normandy Invasion withdrew their nominations. Horses that did not start in the Kentucky Derby and were nominated include Illinois Derby winner Departing, Sunland Derby winner Govenor Charlie and Titletown Five.\nNine 3-year-olds were entered for the 138th Preakness Stakes. The post position draw was held at the International Pavilion in the Pimlico Infield at 6 p.m. on May 15, 2013 and were broadcast live on Horse Racing TV using a blind draw. After the draw Orb was installed as the even money favorite, securing the rail.\nRace.\nOn the day of the race, the Kentucky Derby winner Orb was bet down further from even money of 1–1 on the morning line down to a prohibitive odds-on favorite at 3-5 by post time. Florida Derby runner-up Itsmyluckyday was listed as a distant second favorite at -1 while Santa Anita Derby winner Goldencents was the third choice at almost -1 by post time. Oxbow was relegated to longshot status of almost -1, the only horse with longer odds was stablemate Titletown Five at 22–1.\nAt the break Oxbow was brushed by Will Take Charge, and then steadied as Goldencents, Oxbow and Titletown Five rushed out to the lead in that order. Orb broke well in sixth place out of nine stakes winning colts. Passing the stands for the first time Oxbow moved to the lead and led by one and one half length over Goldencents completing the first quarter mile in a slow :23-4/5. Making a point to ride three to four paths off the rail Oxbow's jockey Gary Stevens slowed down the pace of the race. Rounding Pimlico's famous \"Clubhouse Turn\" Oxbow opened a daylight advantage moving ahead by two and a half lengths tipping the clock at :48-3/5 for the first half mile. At this point Orb was running in fifth place only two lengths behind Oxbow.\nRacing down the backstretch and entering the final turn Oxbow's lead dwindled to only a length and a half with Goldencents and Itsmyluckyday within striking distance. At the top of the lane Oxbow hit another gear and widened his lead to three lengths over Itsmyluckyday who went six wide and made a menacing run toward the front. The first mile was completed in 1:38 flat on the front end as Derby winner Orb toiled in sixth place.\nNearing the wire, Oxbow, under some hand urging by Stevens, held on to win by one and three quarter lengths over Itsmyluckyday. Louisiana Derby runner-up Mylute closed from the back of the pack under Rosie Napravnik to finish third by two and a quarter lengths (the best finish ever by a woman jockey in the 138-year history of the Preakness). Kentucky Derby winner Orb made up some ground at the end but could finish no better than fourth, nine lengths behind the winner. Just after the wire NBC announcer Tom Hammond exclaimed, \"Gary Stevens just stole the Preakness,\" with Oxbow becoming the first wire-to-wire winner of the race since Aloma's Ruler in 1982. The \"Hall-of-Fame ride\" allowed Oxbow to conserve enough energy to finish the mile and three sixteenths in a final time of 1:57.54; it was the slowest Preakness winning time since 1961."

Nevertheless, cycling became increasingly common during the 2010s and thousands of cyclists participate in Critical Mass events, protesting against the Municipality of Bucharest's opposition to building segregated cycle facilities.\nThe largest biking event is \"Prima Evadare\" (\"The first escape\").\nCycle path.\nThe earliest segregated cycling paths were built in the 1970s in the Colentina district, along a 3-km stretch of Șoseaua Colentina between Obor and Colentina River. They were replaced in 2007 with parking spaces.\nBetween 2008–2010, the Bucharest City Hall built 122 km of cycling paths on the sidewalks of the city (mixing bicycle and pedestrian traffic), at a cost of 12 million €. They were closed down by the traffic police in 2012 as they were found to be illegal according to the traffic code.\nMayor of Bucharest Sorin Oprescu announced in March 2013 that he refuses to allow segregated cycling paths to be built on the roads, as he claims that the Romanian drivers are uncivilized and that he \"doesn't want to count the dead people\" due to traffic accidents. Oprescu also claimed that most cyclists don't even want any such cycling paths.\nAs a reaction to Oprescu's claim of cyclists not wanting segregated cycling paths, the Cyclist Community of Bucharest organized a protest under the slogan \"we want [dedicated] paths on the road\" on 23 March 2013, in which up to 3000 cyclists participated. An even larger protest was organized on 21 September 2013, when more than 5000 cyclists participated.\nThe result is a segregated cycling path in the central Calea Victoriei avenue."

Schwartz; the foreword is written by Doris Kearns Goodwin.\nSexton, a Catholic, grew up in New York City and as a young man was a Brooklyn Dodgers fan. A graduate of a Jesuit prep high school, Sexton holds an M.A. in comparative religion (1965), and a Ph.D. in history of American religion (1978) from Fordham University. Sexton served as the President of New York University from 2002 to 2016.\nBackground.\n\"Baseball as a Road to God\" is based on a course John Sexton has taught at New York University for more than a decade. Sexton’s course originated when one of his students asked him why he was such a big baseball fan because the sport, according to the student, was not very interesting. Reportedly, Sexton responded, “You are among the great unwashed. But there is hope for your soul.”\nOn the night before opening day, the end of a baseball fan's version of Advent, John Sexton entered his classroom at New York University to speak of Joe DiMaggio. He came to speak, too, of Ernest Hemingway and Gay Talese, of Lord Krishna and a sacred tree in the Amazon, and what he called 'this notion of touching the ineffable'. Around Dr. Sexton sat 18 undergraduates, some religious and some not, some bleacher diehards and some not, all of them enrolled in a course titled Baseball as a Road to God. It is the sort of course in which the teaching assistants go by the angelic designation Celestials and discussion sections are named for Derek Jeter and Willie Mays among other diamond luminaries.\nBook Summary.\nSimilar to the class Sexton teaches, the book uses the game of baseball to help religious faith and the spiritual life. The book, similar to a baseball game, is divided into chapters, each of which is referred to as an “inning”.\nIn each chapter, Sexton discusses the game’s greatest moments, legendary characters, time honored rituals, and famous acts of faith and betrayal. An example to Sexton’s approach is found in \"Seventh Inning - Saints and Sinners\" where Sexton takes the reader on a course that begins with the concept of canonization and then walks it forward to the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, NY. Along the way, Sexton introduces the reader to various baseball sinners, chief among them being Ty Cobb.\nReception and reviews.\nCritical reviews have been positive. In their reviews, many critics identify with Sexton’s love for baseball and the game's ability to bring a sense of renewal each spring.\nKearns’ foreword to the book has also garnered praise.\nIn a lovely foreword to the book, historian Doris Kearns Goodwin — born, like Sexton, a Brooklyn Dodgers fan, she made the inspired choice of becoming a learned devotee of the Red Sox — tells of helping Gil Hodges break out of a batting slump by giving him \"the St. Christopher’s medal blessed by the pope that I had won in a catechism contest by knowing the seven deadly sins.\" She notes that since St. Christopher \"was the patron saint of travel, I was certain that my medal had guided Hodges safely around the bases.\"\nA discordant note was offered by E.J. Dionne of \"The Washington Post.\" Dionne, a Boston Red Sox fan, had a positive review of the book but objected to Sexton’s dismissive attitude toward Red Sox fans."

He played for the Western Suburbs Magpies. He played 65 first grade games in the New South Wales Rugby League premiership with the Magpies, and then spent a season playing with Barrow in England. He was described as a \"hard man\" known for his \"rugged play\". He was also known for being bald and bearded.\nClub career.\nA Cooma junior, Freeman made his first-grade debut with the Western Suburbs Magpies in the first game of the 1983 season. He was a regular in the side that year, playing at either prop or second row. The next year he made just 4 appearances, all losses.\nWith the threat of Wests being kicked out of the competition, Freeman spent the 1985 season playing with Cooma in the country Group 16 league. Returning to Wests, he was often the starting prop in 1986, and again in 1987 when he made 22 appearances for the season. In 1986 he captained the Magpies when they had a surprise 30–20 victory over Manly\nFreeman missed the first 4 games of the 1988 season due to a suspension imposed after a head-high tackle in a pre-season National-Panasonic Cup match. Freeman denied the charge, saying, \"He went down fairly easily and when I slung him to the ground his head hit hard. I thought my tackle was hard but it was fair.\" On-ground officials disagreed, saying the opposing player had been unconscious before he hit the ground. Freeman received a reduced sentence because of his previously clean record.\nFreeman spent two more years with Wests, before playing for Barrow in the 1989/90 English season.\nAfter retiring, Freeman spent a season coaching Junee.\nFreeman was honoured as a bench player in the Western Suburbs Magpies' Team of the Eighties."

        "title": "Atacama skeleton",
        "text": "Ata is the common name given to the long skeletal remains of a human fetus found in 2003 in the Chilean ghost town of La Noria, in the Atacama Desert. DNA analysis done in 2018 on the premature human fetus identified unusual mutations associated with dwarfism and scoliosis, though these findings were later disputed. The remains were found by Oscar Muñoz, who later sold them; the current owner is Ramón Navia-Osorio, a Spanish businessman.\nOverview.\nDNA analysis on the premature human fetus identified unusual mutations associated with dwarfism and scoliosis, although other research contested genetic abnormalities, finding that the skeleton showed normal fetal development. There is unfounded speculation by people such as UFO theorist Steven M. Greer that Ata is an extraterrestrial. Such speculation led to Ata's inclusion in the 2013 UFO film \"Sirius\" and captured the attention of Stanford University geneticist Garry P. Nolan, who contacted the production team and analyzed the remains of the skeleton. The results of his DNA analysis show the skeleton to be human and not of extraterrestrial origin.\nAnalysis.\nAlthough initially thought to be older, the fetal remains have been dated to as recently as the late 1970s, and have been found to contain high-quality DNA, suitable for scientific analysis. The remains have an irregularly shaped skull and a total of 10 ribs (as opposed to 12 for adult humans), and potential signs of oxycephaly. Considering that the frontal suture of the skull is very open and the hands and feet not fully ossified, anatomist and paleoanthropologist William Jungers has suggested that it was a human fetus that was born prematurely and died before or shortly after birth. An alternative hypothesis by Nolan is that Ata had a combination of genetic disorders that led to the fetus being aborted before term, and pediatric radiologist Ralph Lachman has said that dwarfism alone could not account for all the features found in the fetus.\nDuring the DNA analysis by Nolan, the B2 mtDNA haplotype group was found in the remains. Haplogroups identify human genetic populations that often are associated distinctly with particular geographic regions around the globe. Combined with the alleles found in the mitochondrial DNA contained in the remains, the findings suggested that Ata is indigenous to the western region of South America.\nIn March 2018, Nolan published additional results, stating that the fetus had a rare bone aging disorder, as well as other genetic mutations in genes associated with dwarfism, scoliosis, and abnormalities in the muscles and skeleton. The researchers identified 64 unusual mutations in 7 genes linked to the skeletal system, and they noted that finding so many mutations that specifically affect skeletal development has never been reported before.\nControversy.\nA subsequent study, published in September 2018 by an international research team led by New Zealand's University of Otago Associate Professor of Bioarchaeology Siân Halcrow, questioned the March 2018 study by Nolan, stating: \"As experts in human anatomy and skeletal development, we find no evidence for any of the skeletal anomalies claimed by the authors. Their observations of 'anomalies' represent normal skeletal development in the fetus, cranial moulding from delivery, and potential post-mortem taphonomic effects\" and that the team was \"sceptical\" concerning the genomic results. The authors also raised ethical concerns about the work by Nolan, saying that \"studies such as these that do not address ethical considerations of the deceased and their descendant communities threaten to undo the decades of work anthropologists and others have put in to correct past colonialist tendencies.\"\nThe publisher of the earlier study, \"Genome Research\", responded by stating that the ethical standards did not cover work on \"specimens of uncertain biological origins, such as the Atacama skeleton,\" but also stated their intention to review their own policies on such studies. The authors of the \"Genome Research\" article published a response acknowledging the ethical concerns and calling for the repatriation of the remains. They distanced themselves from possible ethical missteps by largely claiming ignorance about the handling of the remains and the circumstances of the discovery, and noting that they were presented with roughly a cubic millimeter of bone to analyze."

        "text": "The East Fremantle Lacrosse Club was founded in 1899 and is the oldest continually existing lacrosse club in Western Australia.\nHistory.\nLacrosse first commenced in Western Australia in 1896 however in the first two years only social games were conducted. In 1898 four teams: Fremantle, Perth, Cottesloe and Mercantile were established and the first competition matches began. In April 1899 at the annual general meeting of the. Fremantle Lacrosse Club it was decided to form a second lacrosse club in Fremantle as the club was too strong for any of the other clubs. The original uniform was a long sleeved dark blue jersey with orange armbands and cuffs. In 1901 the uniform changed to a black jersey with a royal blue collar and cuffs.\nThe team won its first premiership in 1904. In 1909 East Fremantle amalgamated with Fremantle, with the club playing in the East Fremantle uniform and winning the premiership that year. In 1915 the competition ceased due to World War I and resumed in 1919. The club continued to play with Fremantle until 1926 when it resumed under its own name.\nIn 1934, the club again amalgamated with Fremantle retaining the club's colours but using the home ground of Fremantle. In 1940, the club won its next premiership, the club's success was repeated again the following year.\nIn 1957, the club was formally incorporated. In 1960 the club constructed permanent club rooms at Preston Point Reserve and in 1961 won the premiership. In 1966, the club established a women's side, which won its first premiership in 1967."

She won the tournament without dropping a set (or playing a tie-break set), as she gained redemption following the previous year's heavy defeat in the final to Serena Williams. En route, she defeated Lindsay Davenport in the second round, served three bagels (one each to Elena Vesnina, Elena Dementieva and World No. 1 Justine Henin, whom she defeated very impressively in the quarter-finals) and defeated Jelena Janković (who had defeated the defending champion Williams in the quarter-finals) in the semi-finals, before facing Serbian Ana Ivanovic in the final. In a match dubbed as the \"Glam Slam final\", Sharapova upset the highly fancied Serb in straight sets to claim her first Australian Open title, and third Major title.\nMiddle East series.\nAfter playing two Fed Cup rubbers for Russia to kick off February, Sharapova then competed at the Qatar Ladies Open. She defeated Galina Voskoboeva, Tamarine Tanasugarn, Caroline Wozniacki and Agnieszka Radwańska (who had benefited from the withdrawal of top seed Ana Ivanovic in the third round) before facing (and defeating in three sets) Vera Zvonareva in the final.\nSharapova then withdrew from Dubai due to a viral infection.\nIndian Wells &amp; Miami.\nSharapova reached the semi-finals at Indian Wells for the third time in four years, but was defeated there by compatriot and eventual runner-up Svetlana Kuznetsova, bringing an end to her 18-match winning streak to start the season. Following Indian Wells, Sharapova withdrew from Miami, citing a recurring shoulder injury.\nClay court season.\nAmerican clay court season.\nAfter withdrawing from Miami, Sharapova won her first career clay court title in Amelia Island, defeating Dominika Cibulková in the final. At Charleston, she lost to eventual champion Serena Williams in the quarter-finals.\nEuropean clay court season.\nAfter deciding to skip the 2008 Qatar Telecom German Open, Sharapova next played at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, reaching the semi-finals before being forced to withdraw from her match against eventual champion Jelena Janković due to a calf injury.\nFollowing Justine Henin's surprise retirement during the same week as the Rome event, Sharapova was elevated to World No. 1 in the rankings. Subsequently, she was named as the top seed at the French Open, which she needed to win to complete a Career Grand Slam (and thus protect her top ranking). After surviving a close final set against compatriot Evgeniya Rodina in the first round, and another three-setter against Bethanie Mattek in the second, Sharapova fell in the fourth round in three sets to eventual finalist Dinara Safina, having held several match points in the second set.

        "title": "2009 Maria Sharapova tennis season",
        "text": "Results and statistics from Maria Sharapova's 2009 tennis season.\nYearly summary.\nPre-comeback.\nAt the beginning of the year, Sharapova was forced to concede the defence of her Australian Open title, a decision which would see her drop out of the WTA's Top 10 for the first time since winning Wimbledon in 2004. Her continued absence from the Tour also cost her the titles she won in Doha and Amelia Island last year; she also missed both the Premier Mandatory events at Indian Wells and Miami, and subsequently saw her world ranking drop to No. 65.\nSharapova first attempted her comeback by playing doubles with Elena Vesnina at Indian Wells (she did not play in the singles tournament). This decision would backfire, as they lost to fellow Russians Ekaterina Makarova and Tatiana Poutchek in three sets in the first round.\nComeback to tennis.\nIn May, it was announced that she would be making her comeback at the Warsaw Open, which she entered as a wild card entry. She eventually reached the quarter-finals, losing to eventual finalist Alona Bondarenko. In the week during which the tournament was held, though, her world ranking dropped to No. 126, her lowest ranking since 2003, but her run in Warsaw saw her rise to No. 102 in the world rankings.\nFrench Open.\nSharapova entered the 2009 French Open unseeded at a Major for the first time since the 2003 US Open. In the second round, she defeated 11th seed Nadia Petrova 6–2, 1–6, 8–6. She went on to reach the quarter-finals, where she suffered her worst defeat at a Major tournament, losing to Dominika Cibulková and winning only two games (she had to defend a match point at 0–6, 0–5 down in the second set, in the process avoiding her second career double bagel defeat). Despite the defeat, Sharapova moved back into the World's Top 100 in the rankings.\nGrass court season.\nSharapova started her grass court season at Birmingham, where she had won her first grass court title five years earlier. Unseeded, she defeated Stéphanie Dubois, Alexa Glatch, seventh seed and future Wimbledon quarter-finalist Francesca Schiavone and Yanina Wickmayer to reach the semi-finals, before being defeated by Li Na there. Her run in Birmingham brought her ranking back into the Top 60.\nAs it was in 2008, her Wimbledon campaign would once again turn out to be short-lived, as she was defeated in the second round by Gisela Dulko in three sets.\nUS Open series.\nSharapova next played at the 2009 Bank of the West Classic, where she defeated Ai Sugiyama and Nadia Petrova before being defeated by Venus Williams in the final eight.\nShe next played at Los Angeles, where she recorded her first career victory against Victoria Azarenka before falling in three sets to eventual champion Flavia Pennetta in the semi-finals. She then reached her first final since April 2008 at the Rogers Cup, falling there to Elena Dementieva in straight sets.\nTo conclude the US Open series, she competed at the US Open as the 29th seed; this was her lowest seeding at a Major tournament since the 2004 Australian Open. She defeated Tsvetana Pironkova and Christina McHale for the loss of three games each in the first two rounds, but was then stunned in the third round by little-known Melanie Oudin in three sets.\nFall series.\nSharapova picked up her first title since April 2008, when she won the Toray Pan Pacific Open event in Tokyo after her Serbian opponent Jelena Janković retired at 2–5 down in the first set. This marked her 20th career singles title. At Beijing, her final tournament of the season, she received a bye into the second round, where she defeated Victoria Azarenka in three sets, before falling to Peng Shuai in the third. Her impressive comeback eventually led to her finishing the year ranked World No. 14, having been No. 126 back in May.\nAll matches.\nThis table chronicles all the matches of Sharapova in 2009, including walkovers (W/O) which the WTA does not count as wins.

        "title": "List of international cricket centuries by Greg Chappell",
        "text": "Greg Chappell is a former international cricketer who represented Australia in 161 matches between 1970 and 1984. He was described by the cricket journalist Gideon Haigh as \"the outstanding Australian batsman of his generation\", while fellow journalist Christopher Martin-Jenkins said he was capable of \"[mastering] even the best bowlers in the worst batting conditions.\" A right-handed top-order batsman, he scored 27 centuries (100 or more runs in a single innings) in international cricket – 24 in Test cricket and 3 in One Day Internationals (ODIs). He ranks 9th amongst Australian batsmen in terms of international centuries, and joint 41st overall, though he played fewer matches than all but Don Bradman above him.\nChappell played his first Test match in December 1970, and became the tenth Australian to score a century on Test debut, accumulating 108 runs against England in the second Test of the 1970–71 Ashes series. In 1974, he scored centuries in both innings of a match against New Zealand; his brother, Ian also achieved the feat in the match. In the first innings against New Zealand, Chappell recorded his highest score in Test cricket, 247 not out. He scored two centuries in a Test again late the following year against the West Indies, during his first match as captain of Australia. He scored three further double centuries in Test matches, two against Pakistan, and one against India, all in 1980 or 1981. During the fifth Test of the 1983–84 series against Pakistan, Chappell announced that he would retire at the end of the match; during the fourth day he scored his final century in international cricket. In doing so, Chappell became one of only four players to score centuries in both their first and last Test match.\nIn ODI cricket, Chappell made his debut in January 1971, but did not score his first century in the format until 1977, when his 125 not out helped Australia to chase down victory against England. His highest score in ODIs came in 1980, when he scored 138 not out against New Zealand, and he scored his third and final ODI century against the same opponents in 1982. Though he only scored three ODI centuries, he was the first player to score more than 2,000 runs in the format, and at the time of his retirement, he was the leading run-scorer in ODIs."

        "title": "Kentucky–North Carolina basketball rivalry",
        "text": "The series between two of the most victorious college basketball programs of all time, Kentucky (1st) and North Carolina (3rd), has been a long and eventful one, although only in the mid-1960s was there a sustained series between the two which lasted through the early 1970s. That series was ended and another which began in the late 1980s was aborted early, before the current series started.\nHistory.\nMarch 25, 1995: #4 UNC 74, #2 UK 61.\nKentucky got off to an early start, however the momentum of the game was broken irreparably part-way through the first half when Andre Riddick and Rasheed Wallace got into an altercation which literally brought the game to a standstill while the officials attempted to sort out the mess. Technicals were called on each player, along with UK's Walter McCarty, who was a part of the altercation.\nOnce play finally resumed, Kentucky was never able to push the lead despite Wallace sitting on the bench for the remainder of the half. As the game wore on, Kentucky was unable to hit their shots, going an uncharacteristic 7 for 36 from the three-point line. Dean Smith's stated game plan was to guard only Tony Delk from the perimeter. This left many of the UK players (many of them excellent three point shooters) wide open from the perimeter. Unfortunately for Kentucky, all of these players had off shooting nights (on the same night) and UK simply did not capitalize on their open looks. In the end, UK became rattled and could never put together a sustained comeback. UNC was led by Jerry Stackhouse's 18 points along with 18 points from Donald Williams. Much like the aftermath of the 1977 loss, Kentucky was able to regroup from the stinging loss to the Tar Heels and came back to capture the NCAA title the following year.\nDecember 2, 2000: UK 93, #6 UNC 76.\nThe first game of the renewed series, held in the Dean Smith Center, found Kentucky at a particularly critical time. Although the season was still early, UK was reeling from poor offensive execution and were saddled with a 1–3 record. Having dropped out of the top 25 ranking, the game on paper looked like a blow-out in favor of the Heels. Not a cheerful situation for Kentucky fans, especially since UK was at the time on the tail end of a 16–6 all-time series record with UNC and with UK not having beaten UNC for over 25 years.\nThe game was a blow-out, however it was Kentucky which did the damage. With Cliff Hawkins shredding the UNC defense with his penetration and previously unknown Marquis Estill exploding for 19 points, UK rolled to an easy victory and went on to salvage the season. UK's Keith Bogans scored 18 points, but more importantly held UNC's high scoring Joseph Forte (who was also Bogans' former high school teammate at DeMatha (MD)) in check. The game came perilously close to surpassing North Carolina's worst home loss at the Dean Dome, and would have if not for two last-minute 3-point shots by Forte.\nDecember 8, 2001: #11 UK 79, UNC 59.\nOn their home court the 11th ranked Wildcats toppled the unranked Tar Heals in an impressive 20 point victory. [./Https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php%3Ftitle=Tayshaun_Prince&amp;oldid=1189312206 Tayshaun Prince] scored 31-points, had 11-rebounds, four-assists, and four-steals in a 79–59 victory over North Carolina. In scoring Kentucky's first fifteen points, Prince made five consecutive three-point shots to start the game. \nDecember 3, 2005: UNC 83, #10 UK 79.\nNorth Carolina lost the core of their national championship team, including promising freshman Marvin Williams to the National Basketball Association draft and were an extremely young, inexperienced and unproven team when they arrived in Lexington early in the season. The Wildcats, on the other hand, were a relatively experienced team with what was expected to be a talented sophomore class ready for a breakout season. The Wildcats began the game as most expected by taking a 16–10 lead, but the young Tar Heels weren't fazed by the crowd and went on a 15–3 run of their own to claim the lead. North Carolina hit seven three-pointers in the first half en route to a twelve-point lead at halftime 44–32.\nKentucky tightened the margin in the second half, scoring the first seven points after intermission, but could never get over the hump. UNC controlled the boards, mainly due to freshman sensation Tyler Hansbrough and senior David Noel. Other Tar Heels such as Reyshawn Terry (who led all scorers with 25), Bobby Frasor and Wes Miller all contributed key baskets throughout the game, keeping the Wildcats in check. For their part, Kentucky kept the game tight throughout the second half but mental mistakes at key moments and other lapses such as an inability to keep UNC from getting offensive rebounds doomed them to the loss.\nDecember 5, 2009: #5 UK 68, #10 UNC 66.\nDefending National Championion North Carolina opened up the contest with a 9–2 lead until Kentucky, led by freshman John Wall, went on a 28–2 run in the first half. Wall dominated at times while helping the Wildcats build a 19-point first-half lead, then spent 20 anxious minutes in the training room after cramping up. It took a couple of bottles of Gatorade and a bit of teeth grinding by Wall to get back on the floor. The Tar Heels showed grit by eventually climbing within 2 of UK late in the second half. Two Wall free throws with 4.3 seconds left sealed the victory for UK.\nThe win provided redemption of sorts for Wall, a native of Raleigh, N.C., who grew up wanting to play for the Tar Heels. Though North Carolina pursued him throughout high school, the Tar Heels never offered him a scholarship. The win over North Carolina also pushed UK closer to the first program to reach 2,000 wins.\nMarch 27, 2011: #11 UK 76, #7 UNC 69.\nComing on the heels of an upset victory over top-seeded Ohio State and a commanding victory over eleventh-seeded Marquette in the 2011 Regional semifinals, the fourth-seeded Wildcats and second-seeded Tar Heels met at the East Regional Final in Newark, New Jersey, to decide the final team to advance to the Final Four. Prior to the game, Kentucky had not been to a Final Four in 13 years, since it won a National Championship in 1998, while North Carolina had recently won National Championships in 2005 and 2009, and a Final Four in between in 2008.\nKentucky made 12 of 22 three-pointers, including Kentucky freshman Brandon Knight scoring 22 points, while the rest of the Kentucky line-up, Darius Miller, Terrence Jones, and Doron Lamb, also drilled threes of their own to give the Wildcats an early confidence boost. Kentucky went into the halftime with a 38–30 lead then made it stand up as North Carolina failed to take advantage when the Wildcats grew skittish with the lead. Kentucky's DeAndre Liggins nailed a three from the corner with 37 seconds remaining that would push Kentucky's lead to 73–69. A seldom-used reserve a year ago who has flourished in his final season, Josh Harrellson again held his own against North Carolina's bigger, more heralded front line, scoring 12 points and grabbing eight rebounds.\nDecember 3, 2011: #1 UK 73, #5 UNC 72.\nIn 2011 North Carolina and Kentucky were ranked number one and number two to begin the season. A week prior to the match-up North Carolina lost on the road to the University of Nevada Las Vegas, dropping them to fifth and moving Kentucky up to first in the polls. This match-up was the first time the two schools had met this highly ranked since December 26, 1981 in East Rutherford, New Jersey, when Michael Jordan, James Worthy and Sam Perkins combined for 66 points in North Carolina's 82–69 victory. This matchup had even more media anticipation and included more than two dozen National Basketball Association scouts and front office personnel. Kentucky's young squad that starts three freshmen and two sophomores responded.\nThe game was a back-and-forth battle throughout. The first half saw North Carolina in control, even commanding a double-digit lead with ten minutes left in the half. In the second half Kentucky climbed back into it, even capturing the lead on a 7–0 run capped by a Doron Lamb three to make the score 63–60 in favor of Kentucky. The final minute was highlighted by high drama. North Carolina's Reggie Bullock hit a 3-pointer to cut the Wildcats' lead to 73–72 with 48 seconds left. After freshman Marquis Teague missed the front end of a one-and-one, Anthony Davis blocked John Henson's game-winning shot, grabbed the rebound, and the Wildcats ran out the clock to win. Kentucky would eventually win the NCAA national title that season.\nDecember 14, 2013: #18 UNC 82, #11 UK 77.\nNorth Carolina and Kentucky were both ranked in the top 20 coming into this game. At the time of the game, UNC had wins over #1 Michigan State (a team that had beaten Kentucky a month earlier) and #3 Louisville (Kentucky's arch-rival, whom Kentucky would defeat two weeks later), but also unexpected losses to unranked Belmont and UAB. It was a team that tended to play well against good teams and occasionally poorly against inferior teams. Meanwhile, Kentucky had lost to #20 Baylor and the aforementioned Michigan State Spartans (#2 at the time), but had no quality wins to speak of.\nThe game was an exciting one, with the score remaining close throughout the game. Kentucky took an early 9–4 lead, then held a small lead (1–7 pts) for much of the first half. UNC took their first lead at 24–23 on a Joel James layup with 5:31 left in the 1st half; UNC wasn't able to extend the lead beyond 5 points, and Kentucky eventually regained the lead with 16:03 left in the second half. From there, the score would remain within 4 points until the 12:00 mark, when UNC extended the lead to 6 on Desmond Hubert tip-in. Kentucky would never regain the lead, though UNC was never able to extend the lead into double digits.\nKentucky dominated the boards, pulling down 44 rebounds to the Heels' 32, and scored 19 second-chance points. UNC, however, won the turnover battle 9–17, scored 24 points in transition, and shot a higher field goal percentage for the game (48% vs. 41%). The game featured plenty of fouls by both teams (26 for UNC, 30 for UK) and an unusually high number of free throws for both teams (45 for UNC, 43 for UK).\nPaige was the highest scorer for either team, scoring 23 points on 13 field goals and making all 10 of his free throw attempts. He scored 21 of his 23 points in the second half to lead the Tar Heels to the 82–77 victory. James Michael McAdoo also scored 20 points for the Heels, shooting 4 of 6 from the field and making 12 of 19 free throws to go with 5 rebounds and 4 assists.\nFor the Wildcats, Aaron Harrison led the way with 20 points on 8 of 12 field goals; he also made his only three point shot and all 3 of his free throws attempts. Andrew Harrison, meanwhile, scored 17 points (on 3 of 11 field goals and 10 of 17 free throws), and tallied 6 rebounds and 7 assists. James Young also contributed 16 points (half of which came from the foul line), and Willie Cauley-Stein grabbed 12 rebounds (5 offensive).\nHowever, Kentucky would go on to have the more successful season, making the NCAA championship game after going 12–6 in the SEC (2nd place). UNC fell one game short of the Sweet Sixteen, after starting the ACC 1–4 and then rattling off 12 straight wins, finishing 13–5 for a second place tie in the ACC.\nMarch 26, 2017: #5 UNC 75, #6 UK 73.\nNorth Carolina was given the #1 seed in the south regional, while Kentucky was given the #2 seed. North Carolina rolled past #16 seed Texas Southern in their first-round game 103–64. In their second-round game, the Tar Heels overcame a late deficit to defeat #8 seed Arkansas 72–65. They then blew past #4 seed Butler in the Sweet Sixteen 92–80, securing a spot in the South Region Final. Kentucky's path included wins over 15 seeded Northern Kentucky in the first round, and a 65–62 win over 10 seeded Wichita State in a rematch from their 2014 NCAA Tournament game. Kentucky was then faced up against #3 seed UCLA in a rematch of the game UCLA won earlier in the season 97–92; Kentucky won 86–75.\nNorth Carolina led the Wildcats the entire first half, finishing with a 38–33 lead. Kentucky answered by beginning the second half with a 6–0 run to take their first lead of the game. North Carolina quickly took the lead back, and held it until the 7:27 mark of the 2nd half when Kentucky tied it at 57. Kentucky then took a 64–59 lead before North Carolina went on a 12–0 run. De'Aaron Fox hit a 3-pointer with 46.8 seconds left; Malik Monk then hit a 3 of his own with 38.5 seconds left to make it 71–70. Justin Jackson answered the three with a breakaway layup to make it 73–70 Tar Heels with 33 seconds left. A very contested three pointer by Malik Monk with 7.2 seconds left tied it up yet again.

        "title": "2013 Kentucky Derby",
        "text": "The 139th running of the Kentucky Derby commenced at 6:33 pm Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) on May 4, 2013, at Churchill Downs. The race was televised in the United States on the NBC television network. The favorite, Orb, won a purse of $1.4 million with a final time of 2:02.89, with Golden Soul finishing second and Revolutionary placing third.\nThe attendance for the race was 151,616. Security was increased in the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombings; coolers and large purses were banned.\nQualification.\nFor the first time, the colts making the field in the Kentucky Derby qualified under a new points system. In years past, colts qualified based on graded stakes earnings. A total of thirty-six races, with the first coming last year, gave Derby starters an opportunity to accumulate points towards an entry into the race. Twenty horses qualified for the Kentucky Derby with two other horses (\"Fear the Kitten\" and \"Carving\") listed as \"also eligible\" in case one of the starters would be scratched prior to the opening of betting.\nPayout.\nThe 139th Kentucky Derby Payout Schedule\nField.\nAfter the draw of the field, Orb, the Florida Derby winner, was the 7:2 favorite. Trainer Todd Pletcher had five different horses in the race, including the winners of the Arkansas Derby (Overanalyze), Louisiana Derby (Revolutionary) and Wood Memorial (Verrazano). Among jockeys, noteworthy entrants were Kevin Krigger, who rode Goldencents, trying to become the first black jockey to win since Jimmy Winkfield in 1902, and Rosie Napravnik, riding Mylute, attempting to become the first female jockey to win the Derby.\nScratches.\n\"Black Onyx\" was scratched late after early betting began. As a result, it was too late for \"Fear the Kitten\", who would have been eligible in the case of scratch, to enter the race. Connections for \"Carving\", who was listed as \"also eligible\" after \"Fear the Kitten\", elected not to make the trip to the Derby.\nRace.\nOn race day, rain fell steadily throughout the morning and early afternoon. The rain stopped before the start of the Derby, but the track conditions remained cold and \"sloppy\". All the pre-race favorites drew favorable posts. Black Onyx drew lane one, which was left open when he scratched.\nThe Derby got off to a very fast start as Palace Malice took the early lead. As Normandy Invasion seized the lead, Orb was just about in last place. \"I was so far behind. I just let him be calm and relaxed, and he was able to do it,\" said Orb jockey Joel Rosario. \"He was very relaxed and did exactly what I wanted. It was a perfect trip.\"\nOrb rallied down the stretch, winning by 2 1/2 lengths in a time of 2:02.89. The win gave Hall of Fame trainer and native Kentuckian Shug McGaughey his first career Kentucky Derby victory. His horses were 0–6 in six previous Derby starts. \"I've always dreamed of this day and it finally came,\" McGaughey remarked. \"I'm thrilled for the people who put in so much time on this horse, and of course I'm thrilled for me.\" The win supplemented a record setting season for Rosario. He racked up 38 victories in the spring session, the most ever, and in March won the world's richest horse race - the $10 million Dubai World Cup. The Derby marked Orb's fifth consecutive win, earning $1,414,800 and bringing the horse's lifetime winnings to $2,335,850. He is owned by Ogden Mills Phipps and Stuart Janney III.\nGolden Soul took second place while Revolutionary finished third. Revolutionary trainer, Todd Pletcher, who had a record tying five horses in the field, remarked \"I thought he ran super. He got shuffled back farther than we thought and he had to keep waiting to try to make up ground ... He closed strongly and just ran out of ground.\" Normandy Invasion and Mylute rounded out the top five. Riding Mylute, Rosie Napravnik's fifth-place finish was the highest ever by a female jockey, besting her own record of ninth place set in 2011.\nWagering.\nAccording to live odds on the Kentucky Derby website, more than $4.7 million was wagered on Orb of the $36.6 million gambled on the race, making the horse a 5:1 favorite as betting closed.\nJust minutes before, Orb pulled even with Revolutionary as a 6:1 favorite even though more than $4 million was bet on Revolutionary and approximately $3.5 million on Orb.\nSubsequent Grade I wins.\nAlthough Orb never won another race, several members of the Derby field went on to subsequent Grade I victories."

        "text": "Jeffrey Ryan Locke (born September 27, 1989) is a former American football punter. He played college football at UCLA, and was drafted by the Minnesota Vikings in the fifth round of the 2013 NFL Draft.\nHigh school career.\nLocke attended Mountain Ridge High School in Glendale, Arizona, where he played football as a punter, kicker, and wide receiver. As a senior, Locke averaged 43.6 yards on 38 punts with 10 inside the 20-yard line, kicked 47 touchbacks on 54 kickoffs, converted 29 of 32 extra point attempts, and made 11 of 20 field goals. He set school records for most field goals in a season (11), longest punt (71 yards), and longest field goal (63 yards, a state record). For his efforts, Locke was ranked No. 1 kicker by ESPN.com and No. 1 nationally at punter by scout.com.\nCollege career.\nLocke attended the University of California, Los Angeles and played for the UCLA Bruins football team from 2008 to 2012. He did not see action in his first year but later became UCLA's starting punter and kickoff specialist for four seasons. He made 53 career starts with a punting average of 44.23, No. 2 in UCLA history. Locke also had a 42.54% touchback rate on kickoffs. In 2011, Locke took over for field goal and extra point duties in a few games following an injury to UCLA's starting placekicker. He went 2–3 on field goals, connecting from 49 and 51 as well as converting 6 of 9 extra point attempts.

Locke agreed to give his number 12 to Freeman and switched to number 18 and wore it for the next three seasons.\nIndianapolis Colts.\nOn March 10, 2017, Locke signed with the Indianapolis Colts.

He was released on August 31, 2018.\nArizona Hotshots.\nOn January 20, 2019, Locke signed with the Arizona Hotshots of the Alliance of American Football. The league ceased operations in April 2019.\nPersonal life.\nLocke \"got hooked on punting\" after attending a camp run by former NFL punter Ray Guy when he was in high school. He listed former NFL punter Daniel Sepulveda as one of the players he most admired.\nLocke graduated from UCLA with a grade-point average of 3.885 and a bachelor's degree in economics. While at school, he spent some of his time researching athletic scholarships and helped his teammates set up personal budgets."

        "text": "Micah Richmond Hyde (born December 31, 1990) is an American football safety who is a free agent. He played college football at Iowa and was drafted by the Green Bay Packers in the fifth round of the 2013 NFL draft.\nEarly years.\nHyde was born in Fostoria, Ohio, and attended Fostoria High School where he lettered in three sports: baseball, basketball and football. On the gridiron, he was a team captain during his sophomore, junior, and senior seasons with the team. As a junior, Hyde earned northern Ohio first-team honors as a quarterback, cornerback, and kicker. He was also named honorable mention as a punter. He was additionally named a first-team defensive back and quarterback in his senior year. He also earned first-team all-conference basketball and baseball honors and averaged 22 points a game in basketball during his time there. During his career, he had 165 tackles, eight interceptions and seven defended passes as a cornerback. As a quarterback, he had 549 rushing attempts for 3,443 yards and 46 touchdowns and also completed 606 out of 997 passes for 7,864 yards and 65 touchdowns. Hyde broke 17 school records, including those for touchdown passes in a season and a career.\nCollege career.\nHyde was heavily recruited coming out of high school and received scholarship offers from numerous schools including Iowa, Ball State, Bowling Green, Miami (OH), Ohio, and Toledo. He was ranked as a two-star dual-threat quarterback by Rivals.com He ran the 40-yard dash in 4.45 seconds, had a 3.2 GPA at Fostoria and scored a 20 on his ACT.\nHyde ultimately decided to play for the Iowa Hawkeyes and competed mainly on special teams and on a defense that had 11 players who would go on to be drafted into the NFL. He received his first college playing time in a game against Northern Iowa and contributed one tackle on special teams. He also appeared against the Michigan Wolverines and recorded two tackles.\nDuring his sophomore year, Hyde played a much more expanded role on defense and started all 13 games at cornerback. He made his first big impact in a game against the Ball State Cardinals, where he forced a fumble and intercepted a pass. Later in the season when the Hawkeyes played Michigan State, Hyde scored his first touchdown on a lateral from teammate Tyler Sash late in the first quarter. He finished the season with a career-high in tackles with 82, 58 of them solo, with 4 interceptions. His performance led to him being named as an honorable mention to the All-Big Ten team.\nAfter the successes of his second year, Hyde was rotated between free safety and cornerback during spring practice and started the first two games at safety. He was moved back to cornerback against Pittsburgh and had two interceptions, the second winning the game for the Hawkeyes as it allowed them to run the clock out. He finished the year with 72 tackles (1.5 for loss), 3 interceptions, and a forced fumble. He was named an honorable mention to the All-Big Ten team.\nIn his final year with the Hawkeyes, Hyde was named a first-team All-Big Ten selection and also won the Tatum-Woodson Award, annually given to the best defensive back in the conference. He finished his career starting every game for three consecutive seasons. He finished his senior year with 78 tackles, 14 defensed passes, an interception, three forced fumbles and two fumble recoveries.\nProfessional career.\nHyde was one of 60 defensive backs to attend the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis, Indiana, and performed all of the combine drills. On March 25, 2013, Hyde attended Iowa's Pro Day and ran positional drills. He attempted to perform better in multiple combine drills, but was only able to lower his time in the three-cone drill (6.67s). He was projected to be a sixth round pick by NFL draft experts and scouts. He was also ranked the 25th best cornerback prospect in the draft by DraftScout.com. \nGreen Bay Packers.\n2013 season.\nThe Green Bay Packers selected Hyde in the fifth round (159th overall) of the 2013 NFL draft.

He was drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the sixth round of the 2013 NFL Draft after his college career at Florida State and played his entire eight-year professional career with the Steelers.\nHigh school career.\nWilliams played high school football for Ridge Community High School and was one of the state's top linebackers. He was teammates with Mike James. Williams was named Polk County Defensive Player of the Year as a junior and 3A second-team All-State honors as a senior. He amassed almost 300 tackles with 48 tackles for loss and 25 sacks over three varsity seasons.\nRegarded as a four-star recruit by \"Rivals.com\", Williams was ranked as the No. 10 inside linebacker prospect in his class. He was also co-MVP of the \"Scout.com\" combine in Jacksonville. Highly recruited, Williams chose Florida State over Louisiana State, Ohio State, and Florida.\nCollege career.\nWilliams graduated early from high school and enrolled at Florida State in January 2008. He was the back-up at middle linebacker, behind upper-classmen Derek Nicholson and Dekoda Watson, and saw action in every game except the win at Miami (FL).

        "text": "The 2014 Masters Tournament was the 78th edition of the Masters Tournament, the first of golf's four major championships in 2014. It was held April 10–13 at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia. Bubba Watson won his second Masters, three shots ahead of runners-up Jonas Blixt and Jordan Spieth; defending champion Adam Scott tied for fourteenth place.\nAfter world number one Tiger Woods withdrew, three entered Augusta with a chance to leave with the top ranking. Adam Scott needed a two-way tie for third, Henrik Stenson a two-way tie for second, and Jason Day a win. The trio finished T-14, T-14, and T-20, respectively, so Woods remained number one.\nField.\nThe Masters has the smallest field of the four major championships. Officially, the Masters remains an invitation event, but there is a set of qualifying criteria that determines who is included in the field. Each player is classified according to the first category by which he qualified, with other categories in which he qualified shown in parentheses.\nGolfers who qualify based solely on their performance in amateur tournaments (categories 6–10) must remain amateurs on the starting day of the tournament to be eligible to play.\n1.

The total of 24 Masters debutants was a record, beating the 23 in 1935.\nCraig Stadler and Kevin Stadler were the 12th father and son to play in the Masters, but the first to play in the same year.\nTiger Woods had played in 19 consecutive Masters (1995–2013). Also absent was Pádraig Harrington who had appeared in the previous 14 Masters, and in every major in the last eight years.\nRound summaries.\nFirst round.\n\"Thursday, April 10, 2014\"\nBill Haas led by a stroke after a 68 on the first day, one shot ahead of Louis Oosthuizen, Bubba Watson, and defending champion Adam Scott. There were 18 players, including Rory McIlroy, Jordan Spieth, Fred Couples and Rickie Fowler, within three shots of the lead after the first round. The weather conditions were near-perfect: clear and calm with temperatures in the mid-70s (24 °C).\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, April 11, 2014\"\n2012 champion Bubba Watson recorded five consecutive birdies on holes 12–16 on his way to a round of 68 (−4) and a three-shot lead after 36 holes. Watson was the only player from the top-10 after the first round to match or better his score in the second round. Joining Watson for the low round of the day (68) were Thomas Bjørn, Jim Furyk and John Senden. Three-time champion Phil Mickelson shot 73 (+1) and missed the cut at the Masters for the first time since 1997.\nAmateurs: \"Goss (+3)\", Fitzpatrick (+5), Lee (+9), Niebrugge (+11), Porteous (+12), McCoy (+17).\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, April 12, 2014\"\nSecond round leader Bubba Watson fell back to the field with a two-over-par 74. Jordan Spieth shot another round of 70 to tie Watson for first place at five-under-par. Miguel Ángel Jiménez shot the lowest round of the day, 66 (−6), to move into a tie for fifth place.\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, April 13, 2014\"\nSummary.\nBubba Watson shot a 69 in the final round to win the Masters for the second time in three years. Jordan Spieth had taken the lead after a birdie on the second hole, and expanded his lead to 2 shots following a Watson bogey on the third. Spieth held the outright lead until the eighth hole, when Watson scored a birdie to Spieth's bogey. Another Watson birdie and Spieth bogey on the ninth hole gave Watson a two-shot lead, which he never relinquished and won going away, finishing three shots ahead of both Spieth and Swedish golfer Jonas Blixt. Blixt was the only player in the field to post four sub-par rounds. Joost Luiten shot the low round of the day, 67 (−5)."

The club's football and netball teams currently compete in the Hampden Football Netball League, with the football squad having joined it in 2013 along with the Hamilton Kangaroos.\nApart from football and netball, the club has a cricket section which up until 2023 played in the Portland and District Cricket Association. That association amalgamated with the Hamilton and District Cricket Association ahead of the 2023-24 season.\nHistory.\nThe club was established as \"Portland Football Club\" on 6 June 1876 at a meeting held at Mac's Hotel. Portland's current colours (black and gold) were first used in 1902 and again in 1909, but changed in 1919. The distinctive black with gold sash came into being in 1930.\nHanlon Park became Portland's home ground in 1923 and has remained as such, except for 1961 when Henty Park was used while Hanlon Park was top dressed. Before 1923, football was played from 1866 on the cricket ground the North Cliff.\nIn 1931 the club joined the Western District FL after previously playing in a local competition that had local clubs nearby. The development of the automobile allowed the team to travel greater distances and play against larger towns. The club soon developed a rivalry against Hamilton, Coleraine and Casterton.\nThe Western Border Football League (an amalgamation of the Western District Football League and the South Eastern Border Football League) was formed in 1964.\nAt the Annual General Meeting of the Club held on 16 February 1994, the name of the club was changed to the Portland Football-Netball Club and became incorporated under that name on 29 March 1994.\nSubsequent to this, the name of the Club changed to its present title, namely the Portland Football Netball Cricket Club at a Special General Meeting on 9 March 2006.\nIn 2013 Portland opted to transfer to the Hampden Football Netball League. This move came when the Hamilton and Imperials clubs decided to merge and also desired to transfer to the Hampden FNL.\nLeading goalkickers.\n•John Phillips 1982 (104)\n•Tim Otter 1989 (108)\n•Luke Hampshire 1992 (87)\n•Jarrod Holt 2012 (71)\n•Jay Moody 2015 (52)\n•James Roberts 2016 (50)\n•James Roberts 2017 (60)\n•Thomas Sharp 2022 (82)\nMost Senior Games.\nMick Jennings holds the record of 323 games.( Mick also played another 21 games with Heywood )\nMost goals in a season.\nTim Otter with 109 in 1989.

        "title": "2005 Maria Sharapova tennis season",
        "text": "Results and statistics from Maria Sharapova's 2005 tennis season.\nYearly summary.\nAustralian Open series.\nSharapova began her season at the Australian Open, as the fourth seed. She reached the semi-finals, defeating Grand Slam debutant Li Na and the previous year's US Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova en route, before being defeated in the semi-finals by eventual champion Serena Williams in an epic three set thriller on Rod Laver. Sharapova, had several match points in the final set, but ended up losing it 6–8.\nIndian Wells &amp; Miami.\nSharapova reached the semi-finals at Indian Wells for the first time, but she would suffer the ignominy of a double bagel defeat, failing to win a single game against Lindsay Davenport. This would turn out to be Sharapova's only career defeat against Davenport. She fared much better in Miami though, beating the likes of Justine Henin-Hardenne and Venus Williams en route to the final. In the final, she lost in straight sets to Kim Clijsters.\nEuropean clay court season.\nSharapova first clay event of the season was the Berlin Open where she was the first seed. She lost in straight sets in the quarters, to eventual champion Justine Henin-Hardenne. Her next tournament was the Internazionali B.N.L D'Italia Open. She lost in the semifinals to Swiss Patty Schnyder, in three sets after winning the first set. Her final clay tournament of the year was the French Open where she reached the quarterfinals. In the quarters she lost to Justine Henin-Hardenne, for the second and final time in the season.\nGrass court season.\nSharapova successfully defended her title in Birmingham, defeating future rivals Samantha Stosur and Tatiana Golovin, before defeating, future world number one, Jelena Janković in a three set final.\nAs the defending champion at Wimbledon, Sharapova navigated her way through to the semi-finals without the loss of a set (and serve, with the exception of her third round victory against Katarina Srebotnik), before being defeated by eventual champion Venus Williams; the defeat ending a 22-match winning streak on grass dating back to the 2003 Wimbledon 4th Round.\nUS Open series.\nA week before the start of the US Open, Sharapova claimed the World No. 1 ranking for the first time, succeeding Lindsay Davenport. Subsequently, she was named top seed at a Major tournament for the first time, at the US Open, where she reached the semi-finals to complete the feat of having reached at least the quarter-final stage at each of the four Majors.\nSharapova won her first four matches for the loss of just 12 games, before being sternly tested by compatriot Nadia Petrova in the quarter-finals, before winning in three sets. In the semi-finals, she lost to eventual champion Kim Clijsters in three sets. This marked the fourth consecutive Major tournament in which Sharapova was defeated by the eventual champion. Despite this defeat, Sharapova reclaimed the World No. 1 ranking following the tournament, having improved from her third round showing from 2004.\nFall series.\nSharapova's first of two fall tournaments was the 2005 Beijing Open. She had a lot of points here, after making it to the semifinals last year falling to compatriot Svetlana Kuznetsova. She won her first match in a rollercoaster three setter, 6–0, 5–7, 6–2. Then she won her second round easily, in straight sets. In her semifinal match versus Maria Kirilenko, she had to retire the match due to injury.\nSharapova's Next tournament was the Kremlin Cup in Moscow. In her opening round match versus Anna-Lena Grönefeld, she was up 6–1, 4–2, when Grönefeld had to retire the match due to injury. Her next match was versus fellow Russian and future World No.1, Dinara Safina. Sharapova lost after taking the first set 6–1. This was her first loss after winning the opening set since May.\nWTA Tour Championships.\nSharapova qualified for the year-end WTA Tour Championships for the second year in a row, having picked up three titles during the season. She was drawn in the Green Group along with Lindsay Davenport, Patty Schnyder and Nadia Petrova. Sharapova won two of her three matches, the only loss coming to Petrova in the last match. Sharapova qualified for the semi-finals after finishing first in her group; thus, the semi-final saw her drawn against Amélie Mauresmo, in which she was defeated in straight sets, bringing an end to her 2005 season.\nAll matches.\nThis table chronicles all the matches of Sharapova in 2005, including walkovers (W/O) which the WTA does not count as wins. They are marked ND for non-decision or no decision.\nYearly Records.\nHead-to-head matchups.\nMaria Sharapova vs. Justine Henin-Hardenne 1-2\nMaria Sharapova vs. Venus Williams 1-1\nMaria Sharapova vs. Lindsay Davenport 2-1\nMaria Sharapova vs. Maria Kirilenko 1-1\nMaria Sharapova vs. Kim Clijsters 0-2\nMaria Sharapova vs. Serena Williams 0-1"

The UCLA Bruins swept the Mississippi State Bulldogs in a best-of-three series to win the NCAA National Championship, the university's first in baseball and the 109th national title in all sports.\nThe 64 participating college baseball teams were selected from an eligible pool of 298 NCAA Division I programs. Thirty teams were awarded an automatic bid as champions of their individual conferences. Additionally, 34 non-automatic qualifying teams were awarded at-large berths by the NCAA Division I Baseball Committee.\nThe 64 teams were divided into sixteen regionals consisting of four teams each. All four teams, in each regional, competed in a double-elimination tournament. Regional champions then faced one another in a best-of-three games series in their individual Super Regional based upon a predetermined bracketed system. This format determined the final eight participants to advance to the College World Series in Omaha, Nebraska.\nFourteen of the sixteen original Regional hosts advanced to their respective Super Regional; the exceptions were the #8 national seed Oregon Ducks and the Virginia Tech Hokies.\nFor the first time in television history, ESPN provided live cut-ins and highlights from all 16 Regionals with the new Bases Loaded platform — similar to ESPN Goal Line and Buzzer Beater for college football and basketball.\nNational seeds.\nThese eight teams automatically host a Super Regional if they advance to that round.

As of 2020, almost 28,000 basketball Guns are being used by high schools, colleges, and the NBA. Joseph had previously invented a non-automated rebounding device known as the \"Shoot-A-Way,\" for which he filed a patent for in 1984. Like the Shoot-A-Way, the Gun has a \"collection net [that] can be adjusted from 11 feet to 14 feet to force players to shoot with the right amount of arch depending on where they are shooting from.\" Although unlike the Shoot-A-Way, which used tracks to return the ball to the player, the Gun returns the ball by shooting the ball back to the player at a previously set speed and time, this function allows for the player to take up to 1800 shots every hour. This function also allows for a ball to be passed every two seconds, which allows a player to take 200 shots in 10 minutes. Currently there are two models of the basketball Gun invented by John Joseph; the Gun 6000 and the Gun 8000.\nThe Gun 6000.\nThe Gun 6000 is the basic model invented by John Joseph in 1998. The Gun rebounds the player’s missed or made shots, and then it passes the ball back to the player for another shot. This model includes \"a timing device so [players] can determine the distance and the speed of [their] return passes.\" The Gun 6000 also keeps track of shots taken, shots made, and the percentage of made shots.\nThe Gun 8000.\nThe Gun 8000 is a more advanced model invented by John Joseph, which was released on September 1, 2009. This model includes several new features including: a touch pad of where the player wants the pass directed, a time delay button, the ability to input a set number of passes from a given spot before the Gun moves to the next one, as well as a button that won’t allow the machine to move to the next spot until the player has made a set number of shots from his/her current spot. The Gun 8000 also allows the user to print out a receipt of his/her makes, attempts, and percentage.\nThe Gun 10K.\nThe Gun 10K is Shoot-A-Way's most advanced basketball shooting machine invented by John Joseph and released in 2017. This model has a touchscreen to select where the player wants the pass directed, time delay in between each pass, the ability to input a set number of passes from a given spot before The Gun moves on to the next one, as well as the ability to pick the order in which The Gun will pass to the locations. The Gun 10K also has an optional built in Bluetooth speaker system to play music through the players phone during a workout. The Gun 10K comes standard with the ability to track workout stats through the free Shoot-A-Way app. "

The UCLA Bruins won the tournament with a 75–71 victory over the Arizona Wildcats in the championship game.\nSeeds.\nTeams will be seeded by conference record, with ties broken by record between the tied teams followed by record against the regular-season champion, if necessary.\nSchedule.\nWednesday–Saturday, March 12–15, 2014\nThe top four seeds received a first-round bye.\nBracket.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGame summaries.\nIn a matchup of the two best teams in the Pac-12, UCLA upset No. 4 Arizona 75–71 to win the conference tournament final. The Bruins' Jordan Adams made a three-point field goal that broke a tie with 45 seconds remaining. Teammate Kyle Anderson had 21 points, 15 rebounds and five assists, and was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. \"I don't know that I've ever seen [those numbers] and just one turnover for a point guard,\" said Arizona coach Sean Miller of Anderson's performance.\nUCLA twice led by 11 in the first half, including 12–0 spurt at the start of the game that put them ahead 14–3. It temporarily quieted Arizona fans, who made up an overwhelming majority of the crowd. The Wildcats used a 12–2 run to cut the Bruins lead to 43–40 at halftime. UCLA exceeded Utah's 39 points from their entire second-round game against Arizona, and matched Colorado's game total of 43 against the Wildcats in the semifinals. One the nation's top defenses, Arizona allowed the Bruins to shoot 58.1 percent, making 18 of 31 from the field. The Wildcats defense tightened in the second half, when the game saw seven ties and eight lead changes. Arizona took their second lead of the game with less than 16 minutes remaining in the game—they first led 3–2 early. Arizona's Nick Johnson, the Pac-12 Player of the Year, scored 14 of his 22 in the second half. However, Anderson countered with 10 points and nine rebounds in the half.\nFree throws were a key difference in the game, with UCLA making 21 of 25, while Arizona was only 6 of 16. The Wildcats surrendered 75 points just twice all season, both times to the Bruins; UCLA lost 79–75 to Arizona earlier in January.\nAll-tournament team.\nThe following were honored as the top players of the tournament:\nMost outstanding player.\nThe MVP was determined after the Tournament.\nKyle Anderson, who scored 21 points and grabbed 15 rebounds for UCLA in the championship game, was named Tournament MVP.\nHall of Honor inductees.\nInduction ceremony was held on Friday, March 14, 2014, during the tournament:"

        "title": "Cricket in Hong Kong",
        "text": "Cricket has been played in Hong Kong since at least 1841. Like most cricketing nations, it was part of the British Empire. The national cricket team has been active since 1866, and the Hong Kong Cricket Association was granted associate membership of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 1969. The national team have played four matches with One Day International status, but have never been granted Test match status. Each year, Hong Kong hosts the Hong Kong Cricket Sixes, an ICC sanctioned event that features teams of six players in a six over competition.\nHistory.\nHong Kong became a colony of the British Empire after the First Opium War (1839–42), and it was around this time that the first recorded cricket match was played in the colony; in 1841. Ten years later, the Hong Kong Cricket Club was formed, while in 1866, Interport matches were established against Shanghai. In 1890, a further series of matches were started, against The Straits, and Ceylon. Two years after this, the Hong Kong cricket team was returning from one such match against Shanghai, when the ship they were travelling on, the SS \"Bokhara\", was caught in a typhoon, and sank. All but two members of the cricket team, along with 114 others, drowned. \nAn organised domestic cricket league was first established in the 1903–04 season, and was won during its inaugural year by the Army Ordnance Corps. In 1966, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) visited Hong Kong for the first time, on their return from a tour of Australia and New Zealand. The Hong Kong Cricket Association was granted associate membership of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 1969, and a few years later, the domestic structure was altered, with the First and Second Division being replaced with Sunday and Saturday Leagues, respectively.\nIn 1982, the Hong Kong national cricket team made they first appearance in the ICC Trophy, and finished fifth in their group of eight, recording two wins, against Israel, and Gibraltar. Interport matches continued until 1987, when the final one was played, against Singapore. In 1992, the first Hong Kong Cricket Sixes tournament was contested, and was won by Pakistan. By finishing as runners-up in the 2000 ACC Trophy, Hong Kong qualified for the 2004 Asia Cup. At the 2004 competition, Hong Kong played their first One Day International (ODI) matches, suffering heavy losses to Bangladesh and Pakistan. Later in 2004, a Saturday League match had to be cancelled, because Hussain Butt may have posed \"a danger to passing traffic\" during an innings of 311 not out, in which he hit 36 sixes. After finishing as runners-up in the 2006 ACC Trophy, Hong Kong once again qualified for the Asia Cup, where in the 2008 tournament, they once again lost heavily twice, against Pakistan and India.\nCricket is now one of the fastest growing sports in Hong Kong. The game is spreading beyond the Sub Continent or English origin population and many Chinese are also taking up the sport. In a few years it is expected to make some good strides.\nDomestic cricket.\nTypically, cricket is played between September and April in Hong Kong, during the cooler months of the year. There are only three grass pitches in the territory, with the rest of the grounds using artificial wickets. The top-level of the domestic cricket is the Sunday League, which consists of 50 over cricket contested by eleven teams. A Saturday League is also played, in which nineteen teams play 35 over matches."

        "text": "The 2017 FIFA U-20 World Cup was the 21st edition of the FIFA U-20 World Cup, the biennial international men's youth football championship contested by the under-20 national teams of the member associations of FIFA, since its inception in 1977 as the FIFA World Youth Championship. The tournament was hosted by South Korea from 20 May to 11 June 2017.\nAlong with Japan and Mexico, South Korea became the third nation to have hosted all of FIFA men's international competitions, namely the 2002 FIFA World Cup, the 2001 FIFA Confederations Cup, and the 2007 FIFA U-17 World Cup.\nThe South Korean FA originally made a request to host the tournament outside the traditional June/July period, as it would clash with South Korea's rainy season, as well as any possible national team selection should they have qualified for the Confederations Cup.&lt;ref name=\"When/Where in Korea 2017\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nSerbia, the 2015 champions, were not able to defend their title as they failed to reach the final round of the UEFA qualifying tournament. In doing so, they became the fifth consecutive incumbent title holder to fail to qualify for the subsequent tournament. The official match ball used in the tournament was Adidas Krasava.\nEngland won their first FIFA U-20 World Cup title after beating Venezuela 1–0 in the final via a goal from Dominic Calvert-Lewin.\nHost selection.\nAlong with asking member associations whether it wished to host the Under 20, Under 17 or the Beach Soccer World Cup in 2017 (along with Women's Tournaments a year previous), a declaration of interest would need to have been sent by 15 May 2013. A total of 12 countries submitted a bid to host the tournament by the May 2013 deadline:\nThe final decision on who would be hosts were made as part of FIFA's Executive Committee meetings in Brazil on 5 December 2013 with Korea Republic being awarded the hosting rights.\nQualified teams.\nA total of 24 teams qualified for the final tournament. In addition to South Korea who qualified automatically as hosts, the other 23 teams qualified from six separate continental competitions. Starting from 2017, the Oceania Football Confederation received an additional slot (in total two), while UEFA will have five instead of six slots.\nVenues.\nCheonan, Daejeon, Incheon, Seogwipo, Jeonju and Suwon were the six cities chosen to host the competition from a shortlist of nine, with Seoul, Pohang, and Ulsan not chosen.\nPreparation.\nAs part of preparations for the U-20 World Cup, the 2016 Suwon JS Cup, an international football friendly tournament, was held to prepare the host organisers.\nOrganization.\nThe following were key milestones in the organization of the tournament:\nDraw.\nThe draw was held on 15 March 2017, 15:00 KST (), at the Suwon Atrium in Suwon, South Korea. Two Argentine players who have won the FIFA U-20 World Cup, Diego Maradona and Pablo Aimar, participated in the draw. Minho Choi from the South Korean idol group SHINee also participated in the draw.\nThe 24 teams were drawn into six groups of four teams, with hosts South Korea being automatically seeded into Pot 1 and assigned to the first position of group A. The rest of the teams were seeded into their respective pots based on their results in the last five FIFA U-20 World Cups (more recent tournaments weighted more heavily), as follows:\nFurthermore, five bonus points were added to each of the 6 continental champions from the qualifying\ntournaments.\nThe draw started with the hosts South Korea being \"drawn\" to A1. Teams from Pot 1 were drawn first, followed by Pot 2, Pot 3, and finally Pot 4, with each team also drawn to one of the positions within their group. Teams from the same confederation could not be drawn against each other for the group stage.\nThe draw resulted in the following groups:\nMatch officials.\nA total of 22 refereeing trios (a referee and two assistant referees), 5 support referees and 21 video assistant referees were appointed for the tournament. This was the first FIFA underage tournament which uses the video assistant referee.\nSquads.\nEach team had to name a preliminary squad of 35 players. From the preliminary squad, the team had to name a final squad of 21 players (three of whom must be goalkeepers) by the FIFA deadline. Players in the final squad could be replaced due to serious injury up to 24 hours prior to kickoff of the team's first match. The squads were announced by FIFA on 11 May 2017.\nGroup stage.\nThe top two teams of each group and the four best third-placed teams advanced to the round of 16.\nAll times are local, KST ().\nTiebreakers.\nThe rankings of teams in each group were determined as follows (regulations Article 17.7):\nIf two or more teams were equal on the basis of the above three criteria, their rankings were determined by:\nGroup A.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup B.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup C.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup D.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup E.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup F.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nRanking of third-placed teams.\nThe four best teams among those ranked third are determined as follows (regulations Article 17.8):\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nKnockout stage.\nIn the knockout stage, if a match was level at the end of normal playing time, extra time was played (two periods of 15 minutes each) and followed, if necessary, by a penalty shoot-out to determine the winner. However, for the third place match, no extra time was played and the winner was determined by kicks from the penalty mark.\nIn the round of 16, the four third-placed teams were matched with the winners of groups A, B, C, and D. The specific match-ups involving the third-placed teams depend on which four third-placed teams qualified for the round of 16:\nFinal.\nThis was the first ever final for both England and Venezuela in the history of the tournament, in their 11th and 2nd appearances respectively. England's previous best result was in 1993 when they finished third, while Venezuela were eliminated in the round of 16 in 2009. This was England's first appearance and victory in the final of a global football tournament since their senior side's 1966 FIFA World Cup victory, ending 51 years of waiting for a global tournament trophy.\nAwards.\nThe following awards were given at the conclusion of the tournament. They were all sponsored by Adidas, except for the FIFA Fair Play Award and Goal of the Tournament.\nGoalscorers.\nWith five goals, Riccardo Orsolini is the top scorers in the tournament.

        "title": "2017 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup",
        "text": "The 2017 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup was the ninth edition of the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup, the premier international beach soccer championship contested by the men's national teams of the member associations of FIFA. Overall, this was the 19th edition of a world cup in beach soccer since the establishment of the \"Beach Soccer World Championships\" which ran from 1995 to 2004 but was not governed by FIFA. This was the fourth tournament to take place under the biennial basis; the World Cup now takes place once every two years, after taking place on a yearly basis until 2009.\nFIFA originally started the bidding process in April 2013, whilst in December 2014, the Bahamas were appointed as hosts; this was the first time a men's senior FIFA tournament was hosted in the Caribbean, and the first FIFA tournament hosted by the Bahamas. Fifteen teams advanced through their respective preliminary continental qualification competitions, which started in September 2016 and ended in March 2017, to join the host team in the final tournament which included three nations making their debuts at the finals and notably saw two-time champions (in 2011 and 2013) Russia fail to qualify. The tournament was played from 27 April to 7 May 2017, with all 32 matches hosted in one 3,500 seater stadium, in the Bahamian capital, Nassau.\nThe hosts, making their first appearance at a World Cup, exited at the group stage. Portugal were the defending champions, but were eliminated by Brazil in the quarter-finals. Brazil ultimately went on to defeat Tahiti in the final to claim their fourteenth world title since the competition's inception in 1995, and their fifth title of the FIFA era, ending an eight-year wait after last winning the crown in 2009. Iran finished third to claim the best ever placing by an Asian nation in the history of the competition.\nHost selection.\nFirst bidding.\nOn 17 April 2013, FIFA announced that bidding had begun for five competitions between 2016 and 2017, including the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup. Declarations of interest were made by May 15 deadline whilst the hosts were scheduled to be revealed in December 2013.\nThe following 10 countries made an official bid for the World Cup, as revealed by FIFA on 28 May 2013. \nSecond bidding.\nDue to undisclosed circumstances, FIFA did not pick a host from the first round of bidding by December 2013. And so on 6 March 2014, FIFA announced that bidding had re-opened for the 2017 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup. New member associations interested in hosting submitted a declaration of interest by 15 April 2014, and provided the complete set of bidding documents by 1 October 2014.\nThe following 12 countries made official bids for hosting the tournament. Argentina were the only country to submit an entry in both rounds of bidding.\nOn 19 December 2014, the FIFA Executive Committee announced the Bahamas as hosts.\nQualification.\nQualification began with the European qualifiers on 2 September 2016 and concluded with the final match of the AFC event on 11 March 2017. The hosts, the Bahamas, qualified automatically.\nEuropean nations usually receive five spots at the World Cup, and North American nations, two. However Since the Bahamas, as hosts, automatically qualified, taking one of the two North American two berths by default, it was decided by FIFA to transfer one spot from UEFA to CONCACAF to still allow two North American countries to qualify as normal, reducing the number of European berths to four.\nAfrican zone.\nThe two African qualifiers were determined via the 2016 Africa Beach Soccer Cup of Nations (the first time the qualification event was held under the \"Africa Cup of Nations\" title after CAF upped their commitment to beach soccer in 2015). Eight nations took part in the finals between 13 and 18 December in Lagos, Nigeria, who qualified from a preliminary 14 team, two-legged play off event in August and September. Senegal ultimately proved victorious claiming their fourth African crown and fourth successive qualification to the World Cup. Runners-up and hosts Nigeria also qualified, their first qualification since 2011.\nAsian zone.\nThe qualifiers for members of the AFC took place in Kuala Terengganu, Malaysia between 4 and 11 March 2017. 14 teams originally entered but two (Myanmar and Uzbekistan) withdrew before the start of the tournament. Having never failed to qualify for a FIFA era World Cup, Japan narrowly progressed to the semi-finals of the competition as the best runner-up of the three groups in the group stage. Iran and the United Arab Emirates successfully won their semi finals to qualify for the World Cup (for the 7th and 5th time respectively), with Iran winning the final (their 2nd AFC title). Semi final losers Japan and Lebanon contested the final World Cup berth in the third place play off with the Japanese coming out on top to qualify.\nEuropean zone.\nThe qualifiers for the members of UEFA took place between 2 and 11 September 2016 in Jesolo, Italy. A total of 28 teams entered into the tournament with the top four teams (the semi-finalists) qualifying for the World Cup finals. In a surprise result, Poland, ranked 12th in Europe prior to the competition, won the event and secured only their second qualification to a World Cup finals following their debut in 2006. The other successful qualifiers were runners-up Switzerland, third placed and defending World Champions Portugal who beat Italy, finishing fourth, the final qualifier. Poland's success in the second group stage caused a major upset by denying two time World Cup champions (2011 and 2013) Russia a berth at the finals for the first time since 2006. Three time World Cup runners-up (2003, 2004 and 2013) Spain also failed to qualify for just the second time since their debut in 1998.\nNorth, Central American and Caribbean Zone.\nThe North American qualification event took place between 20 and 26 February 2017 in Nassau, the Bahamas at the very stadium the World Cup would be hosted in. 16 teams took part contesting two qualification berths. In a surprise to all, Panama, in just their second CONCACAF Beach Soccer Championship appearance, beat all four historically dominant forces in North America on their way to winning the tournament (Costa Rica in the group stage, the United States in the quarter-finals, El Salvador in the semi-finals and defending champions Mexico in the final). As the finalists, Panama and Mexico qualified for the World Cup, the former for the first time (the first new North American World Cup debutants since 2009), the latter for the fifth time.\nOceanian zone.\nThe 2017 OFC Beach Soccer Championship was originally scheduled to take place in February, however for undisclosed reasons, the tournament was cancelled. Due to their strong performances at the previous two World Cups, the OFC handpicked Tahiti to be the Oceanian representative at the 2017 World Cup (without having to qualify) in December 2015.\nSouth American zone.\nQualifiers for South America took place in Lambaré, Paraguay between 5 and 12 February 2017 with all 10 members of CONMEBOL taking part (the only qualification event to see all members of the respective confederation participate). With three berths available, finalists Brazil and hosts Paraguay secured their qualification by winning their respective semi finals. Brazil beat the Paraguayans in the final to win their sixth title. Ecuador beat Argentina on penalties in the third place play off to claim the final spot at the World Cup, their first qualification after missing out by one placing, finishing fourth, on three previous occasions. This condemned Argentina to their first absence from a World Cup since 2003, their first of the FIFA era, and missing just a third World Cup in total having first appeared in the maiden event in 1995.\nQualified teams.\nThe following 16 teams qualified for the final tournament. In addition to Bahamas who qualified automatically as hosts, the other 15 teams qualified from six separate continental competitions. The slot allocation was approved by the FIFA Executive Committee on 17 March 2016.\nOrganisation.\nThe following were key milestones in the organisation of the tournament:\nVenue.\nOne venue in the capital city of Nassau was used.\nMatch officials.\nFIFA chose 24 officials from 24 different countries to referee matches at the World Cup, who were revealed on 31 March 2017. At least one referee was representing each of the six confederations: four from the AFC, three from CAF, five from CONMEBOL, three from CONCACAF, one from the OFC and eight from UEFA.\nDraw.\nThe official draw was held on 28 February 2017, 20:00 EST (), at the Atlantis Paradise Island Hotel in Nassau, Bahamas, in the attendance of the Bahamas Prime Minister, Perry Christie and CONCACAF General Secretary, Philippe Moggio. Former Brazilian association football international, Emerson and Miss Universe Bahamas 2016, Cherell Williamson, assisted the draw.\nThe 16 teams were drawn into four groups of four teams, with hosts Bahamas being allocated to position A1. The teams were seeded into their respective pots based on their BSWW Beach Soccer Rankings published on 27 February 2017, with the highest ranked teams placed into pot 1 alongside the hosts, the next highest ranked into pot 2 and so on. The identity of the AFC teams were not known at the time of the draw, so the three slots reserved for AFC teams were seeded based on the order in which they would finish in the 2017 AFC Beach Soccer Championship and not the world rankings, with the winners of the qualifiers going to pot 2, runners-up to pot 3 and third place team to pot 4. Teams from the same confederation could not be drawn against each other for the group stage.\nSquads.\nEach team first named a preliminary squad of 18 players. From the preliminary squad, the team then named a final squad of 12 players (two of whom had to be goalkeepers) by the FIFA deadline of 20 April 2017. Players in the final squad may be replaced due to serious injury up to 24 hours prior to kickoff of the team's first match.\nGroup stage.\nEach team earns three points for a win in regulation time, two points for a win in extra time, one point for a win in a penalty shoot-out, and no points for a defeat. The top two teams of each group advance to the quarter-finals.\nAll times are local, EDT ().\nTiebreakers.\nThe rankings of teams in each group are determined as follows (regulations Article 18.5):\nIf two or more teams are equal on the basis of the above criterion, their rankings are determined as follows:\nAwards.\nIn the aftermath of the final at 18:00 local time, FIFA presented individual awards to the three best players of the tournament, three top goal scorers, and to the best goalkeeper. In addition, a collective award was given to the team with the most points in the Fair Play ranking. Following this, this winners trophy was awarded to Brazil, the champions of this year's World Cup.\nWhen deciding the scoring awards, players tied with the same number of goals scored were then split based on the number of assists the tied players in question provided during the tournament, with the player with more assists ranked higher than the other. In this case, Rodrigo and Ahmadzadeh were tied on nine goals each. However Rodrigo had three assists to Ahmadzadeh's one and so were ranked accordingly.\nStatistics.\nGoalscorers.\nTop goalscorer, Gabriele Gori, recorded the second highest number of goals ever scored in a World Cup with 17 and became the first Italian of the FIFA era to be top scorer (Alessandro Altobelli was top scorer in the pre-FIFA era in 1995 and 1996). Notably Madjer (who holds the record for the highest number of goals scored at a single World Cup (21 in 2006) and the highest tally of goals overall in the FIFA era at 87) failed to score even a single goal at a World Cup finals for the very first time.\nFormer Golden Boot winner, Dejan Stankovic, scored his highest number of goals (seven) since winning the award with 16 in 2009. The winner of the Golden Boot in the last edition, Pedro Moran (who won the award with eight goals) scored five goals this time around.\nThere was a total of 103 scorers in this year's World Cup.\nDiscipline.\nRed cards received (1)\nBroadcasting rights.\nThe following table is a summary of some notable and participating countries' broadcasting licensee holders."

        "text": "Mark Moore (born February 13, 1977) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey defenseman. He was drafted and signed by the Pittsburgh Penguins of the NHL, and played 115 games in the ECHL and an additional 15 games in the American Hockey League.\nCareer.\nMoore was drafted by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the seventh round of the 1997 NHL Entry Draft, selected 179th overall. At the time, Moore was a member of the Harvard Crimson men's ice hockey team. During his senior year, Moore and his two younger brothers Steve and Dominic were all members of the Harvard hockey team, with both younger brothers finishing the season as the top two scorers on the team. The three brothers were the first fraternal trio to skate for the Harvard Crimson and only the sixth fraternal trio in NCAA history to skate on the same team.\nUpon graduating from Harvard, Moore signed an NHL player contract with the Pittsburgh Penguins. He attended the Penguins' training camp and was eventually assigned to their ECHL affiliate in Wheeling. Although Moore was not known for his scoring (he averaged 5 points per season while at Harvard), he scored 22 points in 66 games during the 2001-02 ECHL season. Moore split his time between the Nailers and the Augusta Lynx in his final season, during which he was injured.\nAfter missing almost a year, Moore turned down a tryout with the NHL's Montreal Canadiens in September 2003 due to not receiving clearance to play from his doctors. Several months later, Moore's brother Steve would be forced into retirement due to a vicious hit from then-Vancouver Canucks forward Todd Bertuzzi.\nPersonal.\nMark is the older brother of Dominic Moore and Steve Moore. Dominic has played over 500 NHL games with nine different NHL teams, and Steve is a former Colorado Avalanche prospect who played 69 NHL games from 2001 until 2004. Dominic was later traded to the Penguins (the same team that drafted Mark) with Libor Pivko for a 2007 NHL Entry Draft third round pick. While Mark and Dominic played against each other, Mark and Steve once played against each other during a preseason game at the First Union Arena, home of the AHL's Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins.\nAfter his retirement from hockey, Moore authored a book titled \"Saving the Game\" in 2006 and briefly wrote for \"The Hockey News\".\nMoore was once nicknamed \"The Smartest Man in Hockey\" due to scoring a 1590 out of a possible 1600 points on his SAT.\nSince his retirement, Moore has committed his life to academia, earning several degrees including a BCL/JD from McGill University and a Doctorate of Philosophy from Oxford University. After earning his law degree, Moore also clerked for Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin at the Supreme Court of Canada. Dr. Marcus Moore currently teaches courses on Sports Law, Contracts, and Jurisprudence at UBC's Peter A. Allard School.\nMoore runs the Ivy Hockey Academy school in Toronto."

The tournament was sanctioned by the International Baseball Federation (which titled it the Baseball World Cup as of the 1988 tournament). The tournament took place, for the second time, in Venezuela, which had also hosted the previous (1944) tournament. It was contested by six national teams playing ten games each from October 27 through November 18 in Caracas.\nBoth Cuba and Mexico boycotted this AWS in protest of the events of the previous edition, when controversy surrounded the tournament regarding umpiring decisions, which had led to forfeits of games and general ill-will. \nThe host Venezuelan team finished undefeated with a perfect 10–0 record, winning its second consecutive gold medal and third overall.\nColombia finished in second place with a 7–3 record and won silver for its first medal in series history, while Panama went 6–4 for a bronze medal. It was also the first medal for the Panamanians in the tournament. \nNicaragua, a former silver medalist both in 1939 and 1940, placed fourth at 5–5. The Costa Rica and El Salvador teams debuted in the Series and shared last place with a 1–9 mark.\nHéctor Benítez of Venezuela earned Most Valuable Player honors after leading the hitter in batting average (.526), hits (20), RBI (16) and runs scored (16). Teammate Luis Zuloaga was the top pitcher with a 4–0 record, while setting a Series record with seven consecutive wins. Other statistical leaders for Venezuela were Ramón Fernández, with 21 hits, and Luis Romero Petit, who stole nine bases. \nAnother well observed performance came from Panamanian catcher León Kellman, who was the only player to hit two home runs in the Series. Previously, in 1941, Kellman was the only player to homer in the Series. "

        "text": "The individual show jumping in equestrian at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich was held at Olympic Stadium on 3 September. It was open to men and women. There were 54 competitors from 21 nations, with two additional non-starters. The event was won by Graziano Mancinelli of Italy, the nation's first victory in individual jumping since 1960 and third overall, tying France for most of all nations. Great Britain extended its podium streak in the event to four Games (no other nation had managed more than two) with Ann Moore's silver. The United States reach the podium for a second straight Games as Neal Shapiro took bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the 14th appearance of the event, which had first been held at the 1900 Summer Olympics and has been held at every Summer Olympics at which equestrian sports have been featured (that is, excluding 1896, 1904, and 1908). It is the oldest event on the current programme, the only one that was held in 1900. The team and individual events remained separated, as they had been starting in 1968.\nFour of the top 10 riders from the 1968 competition returned: gold medalist William Steinkraus of the United States, two-time (1960 and 1968) bronze medalist David Broome of Great Britain, sixth-place finisher Jim Elder of Canada, and seventh-place finisher Piero D'Inzeo of Italy. Also returning was D'Inzeo's brother Raimondo D'Inzeo. Raimondo had won the 1960 gold and 1956 silver medals; Piero had won the 1960 silver and 1956 bronze medals. The brothers were competing in their seventh Olympics; they would be the first to reach eight Games. Broome was the reigning (1970) World Champion. \nFor only the second time, no nations made their debut in the event.

Entering the tournament, Raj was ranked top of the ICC's batting rankings, while Katherine Brunt of England was rated the best bowler. West Indian Stafanie Taylor, second in the batting rankings, was the top ranked all-rounder. All three players maintained their positions at the top of the rankings at the conclusion of the tournament.\nAt the conclusion of the tournament, an ICC panel selected their team of the tournament.

        "title": "2013–14 St. Francis Brooklyn Terriers men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 2013–2014 St. Francis Brooklyn Terriers men's basketball team represented St. Francis College during the 2013–14 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The team was coached by Glenn Braica, who was in his fourth year at the helm of the St. Francis Terriers. The Terrier's home games were played at the Generoso Pope Athletic Complex. The team has been a member of the Northeast Conference since 1981. The Terriers were selected to participate in the 2013 Maui Invitational Tournament where they won the Consolation Game of the Regional Rounds.\nSt. Francis Brooklyn finished the season at 18–14 overall and 9–7 in conference play for a fourth place tie with Mount St. Mary's. The Terriers qualified for their fourth consecutive NEC tournament under head coach Glenn Braica. The Terriers were given the 5th seed because of a regular season loss to Mount St. Mary's, which served as a tiebreaker. The 5th seed Terriers went on the road to take on 4th seed Mount St. Mary's, losing 72–71. The Terriers led by 19 points with 9:15 left in the game yet lost in the final possession of the game.\nSeason outlook.\nIn Glenn Braica's first three seasons, the Terriers have made the NEC tournament each year. Going into this season Braica has a combined 42–48 overall record and 30–24 conference record. Last year the Terriers earned the eighth seed in the conference, yet for the third season in a row the Terriers were eliminated in the quarterfinals. For the 2013–14 campaign, the Terriers were picked to finish seventh in the NEC by the NEC Preseason Coaches Poll.\nThere were changes to the coaching staff prior to the start of the season. Andy Johnston and Danny Nigro, both assistant coaches in Braica's staff resigned, with Johnston taking a professional head coaching position in Iceland. Coach Braica filled out his staff with former Terrier head coach Ron Ganulin and former Terrier player Jamaal Womack. Clive Bentick who is entering his seventh season as an assistant coach was elevated to the top spot. Ganulin was head coach for 14 years during which he accumulated over 200 wins and was twice named the Northeast Conference's Coach of the Year.\nThe Terriers will have four of their five starters returning for the season. The only loss in the starting 5 is Forward-center Akeem Johnson, who graduated and signed a professional contract to play in the Korisliiga of Finland. The Terriers may fill the vacancy with returning Senior Matt Milk or returning Junior Lowell Ulmer, with Milk more of a traditional Center and the more athletic Ulmer a forward-center. The four returning starters are Junior Power forward Jalen Cannon, Junior Swingman Kevin Douglas, Senior Shooting guard Ben Mockford and Junior Point guard Brent Jones. Of the four, Jones will be heavily challenged for playing time at the one position by returning Sophomore Anthony White. The Terriers top returning player is Jalen Cannon, who earned Second Team All Northeast Conference honors last season and led the team in scoring (14.7 ppg), rebounding (8.8 rpg) and field goal percentage (.556). Cannon also earned All-Rookie Team honors as a freshman in 2011–2012 and was selected for the 2013–14 Preseason All-NEC Team. In addition to the returning players the Terriers added several players that figure to compete for the Center and Point guard positions.\nPreseason signings.\nThe Terriers have nine returning players and have added 4 new players. They include sophomore forward Amdy Fall, freshman guard Sheldon Hagigal, freshman guard Yunus Hopkinson and freshman forward Wayne Martin. Fall helped the College of Central Florida to the NJCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship and prior to Junior College, Fall helped lead Wings Academy (Bronx, NY) to the PSAL semifinals in 2010-2011. Hagigal is a strong combo guard who prepped for two years at West Oaks Academy (Orlando, Florida) and averaged 13 points, 2 assists, and 5 rebounds. Prior to West Oaks Hagigal led Westbury High School (Long Island) to the 2010 county championship title and then to the Class A Long Island title. Hopkinson is a point guard who prepped at Lee Academy in Maine in 2011-2012. Prior to enrolling at Lee Academy, Hopkinson was the eighth leading scorer in the city and finished second-best in the PSAL's 'AA' divisions in 2009-2010, averaging 28.3 points per outing for West 50th Street Campus (Food &amp; Finance). Martin helped lead South Shore to a 17-9 record and a berth in the PSAL quarterfinals in 2011-2012. Martin averaged 12.1 points and 8.3 rebounds per game.\nRegular season.\nNon-conference games.\nSt. Francis Brooklyn upset Miami (FL) in their first match of the season 66–62 in overtime. The Hurricanes were the defending ACC regular season and ACC tournament champions, and the Terriers win on the road is a program highlight. The Terriers were led by freshman Wayne Martin, who came of the bench to score 17 points and Jalen Cannon, who had his first double-double of the season with 14 points and 10 rebounds. For their second match the Terriers beat Florida Atlantic 59–57, completing a two-game sweep while in Florida. The Terriers were led by Jalen Cannon and Ben Mockford, with each contributing 15 points and for the second straight game, rookie Wayne Martin added critical baskets down the stretch by scoring the winning layup with 32 seconds remaining.\nAfter the Maui Invitational Tournament the Terriers headed back to Brooklyn for their Home Opener against the Mount Saint Vincent Dolphins. They were able to beat the Dolphins 83–54 behind Martin's 18 points and Cannon's 17 points. St. Francis Brooklyn hit the road again to face the then 5–2 Stony Brook Seawolves, where they pulled out a 70–68 win with 1.5 seconds left on a Wayne Martin tip-in. The Terriers were led by Jalen Cannon's 23 points and the win gave them a 3-game win streak. The heavily favored Seawolves also had their 13-game home unbeaten streak broken. St. Francis then lost its next 2 games to teams with losing records, first at Army (1–6) and then hosting former NEC member Monmouth (3–6). The Terriers fell to the Black Knights 54–67 and never led in the game after the first minute of play. The only highlight of the game was Sheldon Hagigal's career high 13 points. Against Monmouth the Terriers also trailed for most of the game and the closest they ever game to tying was in the second half when they came within 6 points with 9:43 left in the second half. They were led again by Hagigal, who scored a new career high 23 points. The Terriers then snapped their two-game skid against Canisius at home. The Golden Griffins (6–3) came in averaging almost 74 points, yet the Terriers held them to 51 as they beat them 67–51. The freshman Hagigal led the Terriers in scoring with a 15-point effort. Next, St. Francis hosted the Lafayette Leopards at The Pope and won 65–62 on 19 points and 10 rebounds from Cannon. The game-winner came on a three-pointer from Isailovic which hit the backboard to end the game; the win put the Terriers at 7–5 on the season. The Terriers won their next two games and extended their win streak to four by beating NJIT at home 77–65 and Delaware State on the road 60–57. St. Francis was then poised to be the first men's basketball program in NEC history to win 10 non-conference games as they faced Columbia, but the Terriers were not able to attain the record as they lost 61–81. With the loss, the Terriers finished the non-conference portion of their schedule at 9–6, their best start to a season in 12 years.\nNEC games.\nTo open their conference schedule, the Terriers beat Long Island 78–64. The Terriers had a six-game losing streak against the Blackbirds dating back four years, yet they got their first win in seven attempts as Ben Mockford scored a career high 30 points. They next traveled to Maryland to take on Mount St. Mary's, which came in with a 4–10 record yet the Terriers fell 82–88. St. Francis never led in the game and the only highlights were the performances of Cannon (25 pts) and White (15 pts), both of which put up career highs for points scored. The Terriers proceeded to go 5–2 in their next 7 contests. Then prior to a pivotal NEC match-up against Robert Morris at The Pope on February 8, 2014, it was announced that 4 men's basketball players would be suspended. The players were Brent Jones, Anthony White, P. J. Santavenere, and Wayne Martin. The reason for their suspension was not announced. The Terriers ended up losing 50–72. Later on, all players except Anthony White were reinstated. Yet the distraction of the suspensions wound up costing the Terriers 3 consecutive loses, leading to a 6–6 conference record. The Terriers then won 3 of their last 4 games to finish conference play at 9–7 and the season at 18–13. The Terriers qualified for the NEC Tournament with the 5th seed. St. Francis Brooklyn won 18 games for the first time since the 2001-2002 season and also led the NEC in scoring defense (66.7) and rebounding margin (+3.3).\nNEC tournament.\nThe Terriers qualified for their fourth consecutive NEC Tournament under fourth-year head coach Glenn Braica. The Terriers will have the 5th seed and face 4th seed Mount St. Mary's, the Terriers last met the Mount in the NEC playoffs in the 1999 semifinals where MSM won 68-66. The Terriers again lost in the quarterfinals of the NEC Tournament, this time losing 71-72. The Terriers led by 19 points with 9:15 left in the game yet lost in the final possession of the game. It was later revealed that for 2.5 seconds in the final minute of play Mount St. Mary's had 6 players on the court, during a crucial in-bounds pass by St. Francis. With 6 players Mount St. Mary's forced a turnover and scored a lay-up making it a 1-point game with 26 seconds left on the clock. The NEC commissioner reviewed the situation and assessed a two-game suspension for the 2014-15 regular season to the officiating crew that worked the game in question.\nRoster.\n \nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#0038A8; border: 2px solid #CE1126;;color:#FFFFFF;\"| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#0038A8; border: 2px solid #CE1126;;color:#FFFFFF;\"| NEC Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#0038A8; border: 2px solid #CE1126;;color:#FFFFFF;\"| 2014 NEC Tournament"

        "text": "At the 2002 West Asian Games. the athletics events were held in Kuwait City, Kuwait in April 2002. It had a men's only programme containing seventeen track and field events. Several athletics events usually held at multi-sport events were excluded from the schedule: the steeplechase, 10,000 metres, javelin and discus throws, marathon and race walking events were all absent.\nAll of the twelve countries present at the games sent athletes to compete in the athletics and eight of them reached the medal table. Qatar finished with the most medals, taking seven gold medals in a haul of sixteen. Saudi Arabia were the next best with five golds and fourteen overall, while the hosts Kuwait took third in the table through their four golds from eleven medals in total. These three countries dominated the events, with Jean-Claude Rabbath's gold for Lebanon and Ali Feizi's silver for Iran being the only top two placings among the rest of the nations.\nSome of the best results came from the sprinting events: Salem Al-Yami won the 100 metres in a Saudi Arabian record time of 10.13 seconds, while Fawzi Al-Shammari did a 200/400 metres double, breaking the Kuwaiti national record with a run of 45.25 seconds in the latter. Qatari athletes won six of the nine medals on offer in the middle- and long-distance running events. Qatar also won both of the throwing events, including Bilal Saad Mubarak's shot put victory in 19.10 metres. Saudi Arabia swept the hurdles through Mubarak Ata Mubarak and Hadi Soua'an Al-Somaily with times of 13.60 and 49.04 seconds, respectively – a good standard for the region.\nA number of West Asian Games champions went on to win at the 2002 Asian Games later that year: Fawzi Al-Shammari won the 400 m, Hadi Soua'an Al-Somaily won the 400 m hurdles, Khamis Abdullah Saifeldin won the 3000 m steeplechase and Salem Al-Ahmedi won the triple jump. Further to this, West Asian silver medallists Jamal Al-Saffar and Mukhlid Al-Otaibi topped the podium at the Asian Games and Hussein Al-Sabee (third in the long jump here) was another Asian Games champion. Many athletes were also medallists at the 2002 Asian Athletics Championships held in August later that year."

The team rose to prominence in 1976, at which time scholarships became available to female basketball players. They were the first Division I team to give these scholarships.\nHistory.\nThe Women of Troy made their first appearance in the Final Four in the 1981 AIAW Tournament. Following the successful 1982 season, in which USC reached the Elite Eight of the first NCAA tournament, the Trojans went on to win national championships in 1983 and 1984. The 1983 championship team included three All-Americans, Paula McGee, Cheryl Miller, and Rhonda Windham. The 1983 team went 31–2 in the regular and post-season combined. The 1983 team bested their opponent, Louisiana Tech, by a mere 2 points. The final score was 69–67. The 1984 championship team went 29–4 in the regular and post season. The 1984 team faced University of Tennessee. The victory this year came by a healthy eleven points. The final score was 72–61. USC made the National Championship again in 1986 but did not prevail. They lost to University of Texas 97–81. They since have yet to appear in the National Championship.\nIn 1987 and 1994 the Trojans won the Pac-10 Championship. The Trojans had begun their longest playoff drought in 1998, which was broken when the team made it to the playoff bracket in 2005. Not until 2011 did the Trojans make it to the postseason again. In 2006 USC opened the Galen Center, which was the new home of the Women of Troy. It can seat over 10,000 fans, and it was sold out in 2007 for a game between the Trojans and the UCLA Bruins. It was the first time in history that an NCAA women's basketball game was sold out. Every year since 1986, at least one member of the Trojans team has been honored in the Pac-10 awards. To date, eleven players who played for USC have won Olympic medals.\nGiven USC's early and iconic development of women's basketball, the legacy was featured in an HBO documentary entitled \"Women of Troy,\" which premiered on March 10, 2020.\nPostseason results.\nAIAW Division I.\nThe Trojans made two appearances in the AIAW National Division I basketball tournament, with a combined record of 2–3. \nExternal links.\nOfficial Twitter: https://twitter.com/USCWBB\nFan Forum: https://www.uscbasketball.com/forum/the-lyon-center"

In 2009 after 103 years playing in the 1st XV competition Sydney Boys High School decided to withdraw itself from AAGPS Rugby. After a two-year absence High returned in 2011 with their 1st XV in the 2nd XV competition. In 2012 the Armidale School's 1st XV was admitted into the 2nd XV competition while High were placed in the inaugural 3rd XV competition. Sydney Grammar School decided not to participate in the 2013 1st XV competition reducing the number of schools competing in the 1st XV to 6. It was decided that both the 1st XV and 2nd XV competitions would only include Newington, Shore, Riverview, St Josephs, Kings and Scots. The 3rd XVs of all these schools joined the 1st XVs of Armidale, Grammar and High in a nine-team 3rd XV competition. With the 1st XV and 2nd XV only having six teams, it was also decided that the competition format should change from a single round-robin to a double round-robin. However it has since changed back to a single round-robin competition. The 3rd XV competition remained a single round-robin."

        "text": "The 2007 Rafael Nadal tennis season officially began on 1 January 2007 with the start of the Chennai Open. He won five titles, including one Major and three Masters.\nYear summary.\nRafael Nadal started the year by playing in six hard-court tournaments. He lost in the semifinals and first round of his first two tournaments and then lost in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open to eventual runner-up Fernando González. After another quarterfinal loss at the Dubai Tennis Championships, he won the Indian Wells Masters after beating Novak Djokovic in the final, before losing to Djokovic in the quarterfinals of the 2007 Miami Masters.\nHe played five clay-court tournaments in Europe after that, winning the titles at the Monte-Carlo Masters, the Torneo Godó in Barcelona, and the Italian Open, before losing to Roger Federer in the final of the Hamburg Masters. This defeat ended his 81-match winning streak on clay, which is the male Open Era record for consecutive wins on a single surface. He bounced back quickly in the French Open, not dropping a set en route to the final where he faced Federer once again, this time winning in four sets to join Björn Borg as the only man to win three French Open titles in a row since 1914.\nBetween the tournaments in Barcelona and Rome, Nadal defeated Federer in the \"Battle of Surfaces\" exhibition match in Mallorca, Spain, with the tennis court being half grass and half clay.\nNadal played the Artois Championships at the Queen's Club in London for the second consecutive year. As in 2006, Nadal was upset in the quarterfinals. Nadal then won consecutive five-set matches during the third and fourth rounds of Wimbledon before being beaten by Federer in the five-set final. This was Federer's first five-set match at Wimbledon since 2001.\nIn July, Nadal beat the unseeded Stan Wawrinka in the final of the clay-court Stuttgart Open, which proved to be his last title of the year. He played three important tournaments during the North American summer hard court season. He was a semifinalist at the Canadian Masters in Montreal before losing his first match at the Cincinnati Masters. He was the second-seeded player at the US Open, but was defeated in the fourth round by David Ferrer.\nAfter a month-long break from tournament tennis, Nadal played the Madrid Masters in Madrid and the Paris Masters, but David Nalbandian beat him in straight sets in the quarterfinals and final of those tournaments. To end the year, Nadal won two of his three-round robin matches to advance to the semifinals of the Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai, where Federer defeated him in straight sets.\nDuring the second half of the year, Nadal battled a knee injury suffered during the Wimbledon final. In addition, there were rumors at the end of the year that the foot injury he suffered during 2005, caused long-term damage, which were given credence by coach Toni Nadal's claim that the problem was \"serious\". Nadal and his spokesman strongly denied this, however, with Nadal himself calling the story \"totally false\"."

In his 39-year career, he coached at two schools: Muhlenberg College (1981–1987) and The College of Wooster (1987–2020).\nCareer.\nA native of Monroeville, Ohio, Moore played college basketball at Wittenberg University, graduating in 1974. He won three OAC championship titles.\nMoore kicked off his coaching career at Springfield Catholic Central High School, where he coached junior varsity basketball in 1974-75 while teaching mathematics. He then attended Ohio University in the 1975-76 season, where he served as a volunteer graduate assistant and coached Ohio's junior varsity walk-on team, while completing his master's degree in Physical education. From 1976 to 1981, he served as an assistant coach at Wittenberg, helping the team capture an NCAA Division III national championship in 1977 under coach Larry Hunter. From 1981 to 1987, he was the head coach of Muhlenberg College, where he recorded 87 wins and 65 defeats.\nIn 1987, Moore was named head men's basketball coach of The College of Wooster. Moore retired from coaching following the Fighting Scots' loss in the first round of the 2019-20 NCAA Division III basketball tournament. When he retired in 2020, Moore had a record of 867 wins and 253 losses (780-188 at Wooster), ranking 12th in all-time men's basketball wins, regardless of division. He also was second all-time in games won in the NCAA Division III, when leaving Wooster. While at Wooster, his players received a total of 21 All-America accolades. Under Moore's guidance, Wooster had a record of 522 wins and 113 victories in the 2000s, which made the Fighting Scots the winningest NCAA Division III team of the century.\nMoore was named North Coast Athletic Conference (NCAC) Coach of the Year nine times and is a five-time NABC Great Lakes District Coach of the Year. In 2008, he was presented with NABC's \"Guardians of the Game\" award.\nSome of Moore's players went on to play professionally after leaving Wooster, including players like Tom Port (played in Iceland and Ireland), James Cooper (played in Germany), Evan Pannell (played in Canada) and Mike Trimmer (played in European and South American countries).\nOther Wooster standouts of the Moore era include players like Bryan Nelson (2003 NCAA Division III Player of the Year, by NABC), Erich Riebe, Ian Franks, Ryan Gorman, Dan Fanelly, Stan Aukamp, Justin Hallowell, Danyon Hempy, John Ellenwood and Doug Thorpe. Riebe was Moore's first recruit at Wooster. Being able to get a player like Riebe \"changed Wooster basketball forever\", according to Moore's longtime assistant coach (later associate head coach and his successor as head coach), Doug Cline. As a coach, Moore was known to exemplify the intensity he expected from his players. Before a game against rival Wittenberg in 2001, Moore ended up breaking his hand in practice when diving for a ball in order to demonstrate to his players the type of intensity he was looking for."

        "text": "Ian Patrick Clark (born March 7, 1991) is an American professional basketball player who last played for Melbourne United of the Australian National Basketball League (NBL). He played college basketball at Belmont University. As a senior, he was the 2012–13 Ohio Valley Conference Co-Player of the Year with Murray State's Isaiah Canaan. Clark was third in the nation in three-point field goal shooting percentage and led the Bruins to the conference championship in the school's first year as an OVC member. In July 2013, Clark signed a two-year contract with the Jazz after his performance at the Las Vegas Summer League impressed numerous teams. Clark won an NBA Championship with the Warriors in 2017.\nHigh school career.\nClark was a four-year varsity letter winner at Germantown High School in Germantown, Tennessee. In his final three seasons he led the team in scoring, culminating in a senior season that saw him average 23 points, 5 rebounds and 5 assists per game. He was a three-time all-metro selection by \"The Commercial Appeal\", and in 2009 he was an all-region selection. His Belmont player biography describes him in high school as \"A dynamic, multi-dimensional guard who could make an instant impact on both ends of the floor.\"\nCollege career.\nWhen Clark enrolled at Belmont University as a freshman in 2009–10, the school was still in the Atlantic Sun Conference (A-Sun). He made an immediate impact as its Freshman of the Year as well as being named to the A-Sun Second Team. He averaged 14.9 points and 3.3 rebounds per game and was named a Mid-Major Freshman All-American by CollegeInsider.com. The following year, Clark was named to the A-Sun First Team as the Bruins went 19–1 in conference play to win the A-Sun regular season championship. They also won the conference tournament championship and Clark was named to the all-tournament team. The Bruins earned an automatic berth into the NCAA Tournament but lost to Wisconsin in the Round of 64.\nIn 2011–12, for the second season in a row, Clark was named to the A-Sun's First Team. The Bruins also repeated as regular season and conference tournament champions, qualified for the NCAA Tournament, but once again lost in the Round of 64.

        "text": "Jim Callahan (born July 29, 1946) is a former American football player and author who currently resides in Anna Maria, Florida. Callahan was selected in the eighth round of the 1969 NFL Draft by the Atlanta Falcons. Callahan was recruited out of college by future National Football League (NFL) general manager Bobby Beathard and signed a contract with the Falcons one month later.\nCallahan played wide receiver at Temple University for the 1966, 1967, and 1968 football teamsg under head coach George Makris. Prior to enrollment at Temple University, Callahan earned first team All-Catholic League honors at Cardinal Dougherty High School. Callahan scored a touchdown the first 10 times he touched the football in intercollegiate play, leading the \"New York Times\" to report facetiously that \"Jim Callahan of Temple is in a slump\" after the 11th reception of his career did not go for a touchdown.\nWhen his college career ended, Callahan held Temple Owls football records for most career points (218), most points in a season (86 in 1968), most points in a game (30 verses Bucknell University in 1966), most career touchdowns (36), most touchdowns in a season (14 in 1968), most career receptions (105), most receptions in a season (57 in 1968), most career receiving yards (1,848), most receiving yards in a season (786 in 1968), and most career receiving touchdowns (36).\nCallahan also was on the receiving end of the longest pass play in Temple history; a 90-yard pass thrown by quarterback John Waller against Northeastern University in 1968. His five touchdown receptions against Bucknell in 1966, the most touchdown receptions for one game in Temple history, helped the Owls defeat Bucknell for the first time in 12 years.\nAfter college, Callahan spent the 1969 pre-season with the Atlanta Falcons, but he was placed on waivers on September 1, 1969. He spent the remainder of the 1969 season with the Alabama Hawks of the Continental Football League; a farm team located in Huntsville, Alabama. He was inducted into the Temple University Hall of Fame in 1981.\nCallahan authored the book \"WALLS\" in 1993 (with a revised edition in 1996). According to Callahan, \"WALLS\" is \"based on the belief that life is not a series of unrelated random events. There is a process to how people gather and evaluate information and make the choices that direct their life. WALLS offers an opportunity for you to step out of your daily routine and explore some issues that have a tremendous impact on how you direct your life toward the outcome you desire.\""

This was the 21st time that the winner of the Kentucky Derby and the winner of the Preakness Stakes competed in the race. A total of fourteen horses entered the race, tying for the second-largest field for the third time in the race's history.\nOrb was the morning line favorite. Trainer Todd Pletcher entered a record 5 horses in the race, including the filly Unlimited Budget who was attempting to become the second filly to win the race in the modern era after Pletcher's 2007 winner Rags to Riches. Ridden by Rosie Napravnik, who in doing so, became the first woman jockey to ride all three Triple Crown races in a single year, the filly-and-female-jockey story garnered considerable press.\nRace.\nOxbow held the lead late into the race until Palace Malice passed him with a quarter-mile to go. Palace Malice eventually won by lengths. Orb made a run from back in the pack and finished third."

        "text": "The 2016 UCI Road World Championships took place in Doha, Qatar, in October 2016. The championships was moved from the traditional September to October to avoid extreme hot and blustery weather. The event consisted of a road race, a team time trial and a time trial for elite men and women and a road race and a time trial for men under-23, junior men and junior women. It was the 89th Road World Championships and the first time that Qatar and the Middle East hosted the championships.\nBidding.\nQatar was announced as the host during the 2012 UCI Road World Championships in the Netherlands. Norway also made a bid but was unsuccessful. Norway will now be the host of the 2017 UCI Road World Championships.\nUCI WorldTeam boycott of team time trial.\nIn August 2016 the AIGCP approved a motion for all UCI WorldTeams to boycott the time trial event, due to the UCI insisting that WorldTeams should compete in the event as a requirement of granting a WorldTeam licence without providing a participation allowance to teams, as is the case with other UCI World Tour races. It was reported that the UCI Professional Continental teams attending the AIGCP General Assembly also supported the motion. The UCI expressed disappointment with the move and stated that it \"continued to expect excellent participation in this year's UCI Road World Championships Team Time Trial\".\nSchedule.\nAll times are in (UTC+3).\nCourses.\nThe races primarily started and finished in the capital city of Doha, the home base for the Tour of Qatar. The initial plans were to have a flat time trial circuit , with the men riding it four times, and a larger flat circuit of around for the road race. However, UCI sport and technical director Philippe Chevallier stated in June 2013 that the courses did not meet the requirements for a world championship and it had been decided to construct a hilly purpose-built course, like had been done for the 1980 Summer Olympics. Despite this, in February 2014 Sheikh Khalid Bin Ali Al Thani, the president of the Qatar Cycling Federation, said that the organisers would not create a purpose-built course for the World Championships due to a lack of time.\nThe route for the Worlds road races was presented in February 2015, which was made up of a loop of through the desert and a finishing circuit in Doha city centre, including of cobblestones. The finishing circuit of on The Pearl Island was used for a stage of February's Tour of Qatar: riders noted that the course was highly technical, going through 24 roundabouts, with stage winner Alexander Kristoff comparing it to a criterium. However it was also noted that the lack of long straight sections meant that the effect of the crosswinds frequently occurring in Qatar would be significantly lessened, reducing the race's unpredictability.\nSubsequently, in August 2016 it was reported that the UCI had made changes to the course, increasing the amount of riding through the desert to and reducing the number of laps of the finishing circuit from eleven down to seven. The start of the men's race was also moved to the Aspire Zone, with the riders heading out northwards towards Al Khor and returning to Doha. The women started from the Qatar Foundation in Education City, and completed seven laps of the finishing circuit, with a total race distance of .\nBroadcasting.\nSources"

It was the 22nd final of the Scottish Challenge Cup since it was first organised in 1990 to celebrate the centenary of the Scottish Football League.\nBoth teams progressed through four elimination rounds to reach the final. The match was Queen of the South's fourth appearance in the final of the competition, the last in 2010, whilst it was Partick Thistle's first cup final in 42 years since the League Cup in 1971. The tournament was contested by clubs below the Scottish Premier League; Partick Thistle from the First Division and Queen of the South from the Second Division.\nThe scoreline was 0–0 after 90 minutes of normal time which forced 30 minutes of extra time to be played. Queen of the South scored the first goal of the game in the 101st minute from Nicky Clark. Partick Thistle were awarded a penalty kick with only two minutes left to play and missed; Aaron Muirhead, who missed the penalty, was then sent off for headbutting Chris Higgins. Partick equalised the score to 1–1 in the final minute of the match from Kris Doolan and take the game to penalties. Queen of the South emerged victorious after winning the shoot-out 6–5.\nRoute to the final.\nThe competition is a knock-out tournament and in 2012–13 was contested by 32 teams; the 30 clubs that played in the First, Second and Third Divisions of the Scottish Football League and two Highland Football League clubs by invitation. For the first and second rounds only, the draw was divided into two geographical regions – north/east and south/west. Teams were paired at random and the winner of each match progressed to the next round and the loser was eliminated."

        "title": "Brandon Miller (basketball, born 1979)",
        "text": "Brandon Miller (born May 21, 1979) is an American basketball coach, who previously played college basketball at Southwest Missouri State and Butler. Miller served as Butler's head coach for one season in 2013–14 before requesting a medical leave of absence in October 2014. On January 2, 2015, Butler University announced that Miller would not be returning following his university-approved medical leave and that interim coach Chris Holtmann had been named the Bulldogs head coach.\nBorn in New Castle, Indiana, Miller played point guard for New Castle Chrysler High School before beginning his college career at Southwest Missouri State. When head coach Steve Alford left after Miller's freshman year, he transferred to Butler. He started all 97 games over the next three years, finishing in the school's all-time top five in both made 3-point field goals and assists. During Miller's time at Butler, the team won three NCAA tournament games. Miller was named to multiple honorary teams for both his play and his academics. He won the Horizon League's highest individual honor, the Cecil M. Coleman Medal of Honor, and the 2003 Chip Hilton Award, given annual to the player who best exemplifies the values taught by the Chip Hilton literary character – leadership, character, and talent on and off the court.\nAfter college, Miller entered into coaching as a video coordinator at Xavier. Subsequently, he held assistant coaching positions at Butler and then Ohio State before quitting basketball after the 2010–11 season to spend more time with his family. After a year, he returned to coaching as a special assistant to the head coach at Illinois. In April 2013, Miller rejoined the Butler staff as an assistant coach under Brad Stevens. When Stevens left to coach the Boston Celtics in July, Miller was promoted to head coach.\nEarly life.\nBrandon Miller was born May 21, 1979, in New Castle, Indiana to Roger and Terry Miller. He has an older brother, Scott, and a younger sister, Lindsey. As a kid, he was always fiercely competitive. Whether playing checkers with his grandfather or Nintendo with his friends he expected to win, and when he did not he demanded a rematch. Childhood friend and future teammate Darnell Archey recalled \"I’d have to drop the [Nintendo] controller and run out of the room after I won\" or the game would never end. Miller was frequently injured as a child, usually from going \"full tilt\" in sports. At age four or five, he crashed his bike into a neighbor's house. In youth football, he broke his arm playing quarterback, then re-broke it diving for a loose ball in basketball. In junior high, he ran into a basket support while practicing baton exchanges, badly bloodying his face.\nMiller grew up with basketball. His father, Roger Miller, was a teacher and assistant basketball coach at New Castle Chrysler High School. Brandon Miller's own pursuit of basketball was described by those who knew him as \"relentless\". At age eight, he was doing box jumps when he fell and injured himself seriously enough to go to the emergency room. The next day, he was eager to resume his training. \"That sort of thing is why some people think he’s a little bit crazy\", says his father. By age nine, Miller was doing agility drills, situps, and pushups on a regular basis. He was given a key to New Castle Fieldhouse – the nation's largest high school arena – and would often practice shooting by himself until 10 or 11 pm. Roger Miller was offered the opportunity to be a head coach elsewhere, but declined because the family did not want to leave New Castle.\nThe 1994–95 New Castle Chrysler basketball team was loaded with returning juniors and seniors. No sophomores made the varsity team, but Brandon Miller did as a Freshman. That year, New Castle beat Alexandria in the opening round of the Semi-state playoffs with the help of Scott and Brandon Miller. The younger Miller later described it as one of his all-time favorite games. New Castle fell to Ben Davis in the finals of the Semi-states, one game away from the Final Four.\nThe following season, Brandon Miller became the starting point guard. New Castle returned to the Semi-states, falling to Ben Davis in the semi-final round. Miller scored a team-high 17 points in the loss. During Miller's junior year, New Castle achieved a 21–1 record and number 2 ranking entering the sectional playoffs. Miller scored a game highs of 20 and 17 points as he led his team to a sectional title. New Castle advanced through the regionals before being upset by Franklin in the Semi-states. Miller was selected to the All-State team as a high honorable mention. He was chosen as a member of the Junior All-Star squad.\nAs a senior, Miller tore a ligament in his knee. Knowing he could not damage it further, he continued to play on the injured knee through the playoffs. Due to a change in the playoff format, New Castle met top ranked Anderson in the sectionals, instead of avoiding them to the Semi-states. New Castle led through three quarters but ultimately lost a close game in which Miller was held to eight points. For the year, Miller shot 48 percent from the field and 73 percent on free throws. He was selected to the All-State team as a high honorable mention, and to the \"Herald-Times\"'s All-State Second Team.\nMiller ended his high school career with 1,066 points scored, a 60–11 record as a starter, and three semi-state appearances. He became the first New Castler player to win two North Central Conference championships. Steve Bennett, who was the head coach during Miller's senior year, remarked, \"When he walked into the huddle, you were confident ... Brandon had a championship attitude. There aren’t that many guys you can say that about.\" Miller graduated 12th in his class of 260.\nCollege.\nOut of high school, Miller was recruited to play college basketball by his childhood idol, and New Castle basketball legend, Steve Alford. He signed with Alford's Southwest Missouri State Bears, joining the team for the 1998–99 season. Miller averaged 11 minutes a game and the Bears advanced to the Sweet 16 of the 1999 NCAA tournament. After the season, Alford left Southwest Missouri State to take the head coaching job at Iowa. With Alford gone, Miller decided to transfer to Butler to be closer to home. There, he was reunited with high school teammate Darnell Archey. Alford later said not offering Miller an Iowa scholarship was one of the biggest mistakes of his coaching career.\nAfter sitting out a year due to NCAA regulations regarding transfer students, Miller became the Butler Bulldogs' starting point guard for the 2000-01 season. Miller injured his shoulder in November 2000, but did not miss a game, playing through the injury all year. Butler won the Horizon League regular season title and made the 2001 NCAA tournament as a 10th seed. Powered by strong play from Miller and fellow guards Thomas Jackson and LaVall Jordan, Butler built a 33-point lead over Wake Forest by halftime and cruised to a 79–63 victory. Miller scored a team-high 18 points in what was Butler's first NCAA Tournament win since 1962. Two days later, 2nd-seeded Arizona limited Miller to four points as Butler's season ended in a 73–52 loss. During the off-season, Miller had surgery to fix his shoulder.\nThe following season, Miller led Butler to a 25–5 record and the Horizon League regular-season title. However, the team was \"snubbed\" by the selection committee and ending up playing in the 2002 NIT. Miller made the District V All-Academic Team, the Horizon League Academic All-Conference team, and the Horizon League Academic Honor Roll.\nDuring his senior season, Miller led the Bulldogs in both scoring and assists. Butler won the Horizon League regular-season title for the third straight year. Miller was sick during the Horizon League tournament, scoring just four points as Butler fell in the championship game. It looked as though Butler might miss the 2003 NCAA tournament for the second straight year, but they were granted an at-large selection as a 12th seed. In the team's opening-round game, Butler upset 5th-seeded Mississippi State despite \"an overwhelmingly partisan Mississippi State crowd\". With Butler trailing 46–45 and 26 seconds left on the clock, Miller pulled down a rebound and set up Butler's offense. He got the ball back off a screen and hit a 10-foot floater, driving into the lane with 6.2 seconds left in the game. \"To hit a shot like that in the NCAA tournament, nothing compares to it,\" he remarked. \"It's something you dream about when you're a kid. It's something you dream about when you're 23.\" \"Sports Illustrated\" called the game an \"instant tourney classic\" thanks to Miller's shot. He finished with a team-high 14 points. It was Miller's fourth final-minute go-ahead basket of the season.\nButler proceeded to upset 4th-seeded Louisville 79–71, making the Sweet 16 for the first time since 1962. Miller did not score against Louisville, but was instrumental in breaking down their pressure defense and getting Archey, who hit eight 3-pointers, open looks. He also drew two charges on defense. \"Brandon was just so terrific,\" said Butler coach Todd Lickliter. \"He was just so tough.\" Their surprising success made Butler the media darlings of the tournament. ESPN's Pat Forde described Archey and Miller as a \"fundamentally flawless starting backcourt\", ascribing much of Butler's success to the duo's play. Butler subsequently lost to 1st-seeded Oklahoma, finishing the season with a school record 27 wins.\nMiller was named as a co-recipient of Butler's \"Most Outstanding Male Athlete\" award for his senior performance, and won the Horizon League's highest individual honor – the \"Cecil M. Coleman Medal of Honor\". He made both the All-Horizon League and All-Horizon League Defensive teams. He was named to the District V All-Academic team, and won the 2003 Chip Hilton Award for demonstrating strong leadership, character, and talent both on and off the court. Of the latter award, journalist David Woods remarked that it was fitting because \"in the clutch, [Miler] was Chip Hilton right out of a Clair Bee novel.\" Miller graduated in 2003 with a bachelor's degree in education.\nMiller started all 97 games Butler played during his three seasons there, averaging double figures in scoring each year. He scored 1121 points, made 189 three-point field goals, and compiled 305 assists, despite having three different coaches over his three years at Butler. He is one of eight Butler players to score over 1,000 points in just three seasons. Miller finished his career in second place on the school's all-time rankings for made 3-pointers, and fifth place in assists. As of 2013, he still ranks in the top 10 in both categories. He led the Bulldogs to a 77–20 record during his tenure.\nAs a player, Miller was known for his unconventional style. He would often drive to the basket, seemingly out of control, and put up one-handed shots high off the backboard. Other times, he would stare down his defender as if he was about to penetrate, only to launch a quick three-pointer instead. In February 2006, Miller was named to Butler's \"Team of the Sesquicentennial\", an honorary team of the university's 15 all-time greatest players, marking the school's 150th anniversary.\nCoaching career.\nMiller began his coaching career as a video intern at Xavier for the 2003–04 season. Xavier's coach, Thad Matta, was hired by Ohio State the following year and brought Miller along, naming him the Director of Basketball Operations. After two seasons in the position, Miller became the team's Video Coordinator for the 2006–07 season. In April 2007, he left Ohio State to join the Butler staff as an assistant coach. According to Matta, Miller \"was crucial to the early success we experienced at Ohio State\".\nAt Butler, Miller was involved in recruiting, game preparation, player instruction, and on-court coaching. During his first year there, the team won the Horizon League title and an NCAA tournament game. At the end of the season at Butler, Miller returned to Ohio State as an assistant coach, assuming duties similar to those he performed at Butler. He spent the next three seasons working under Matta before quitting after the 2010–11 season. Missing family vacations and his son Mason's T-ball games had been weighing on Miller when he had an \"aha moment\" during a retirement party for his father. Recalling how his father had passed up opportunities for advancement, Miller knew he needed to adjust his priorities. \"[Coaching is] a job that can become all-consuming. It's a job that the time and the effort, and even more than that, where your mind is at on a day-to-day basis, puts you in a position where you can struggle in terms of finding the balance that you need\", said Miller explaining his decision to resign. \"I look at my life and the first thing that I want to accomplish when it's all said and done is I want to be a very good husband and I want to be a terrific father.\" Later, he described quitting as one of the best decisions of his career. \"I think it gave me perspective on how I was going to coach in the future\", he explained. \"I learned a lot from it.\" Matta was surprised by the decision, saying \"He's one of those guys you can't really visualize not being a coach.\" During Miller's time at Ohio State, the team won two Big Ten titles and went to two Sweet 16s.\nMiller got a sales job at Forest Pharmaceuticals. He enjoyed the job, but after nine months started to miss basketball. After a year off, Miller returned to coaching as a special assistant to Illinois head coach John Groce. In April 2013, Miller rejoined the Butler staff as an assistant coach under Brad Stevens.\nHead coach.\nAfter Stevens left Butler to coach the Boston Celtics, Miller was promoted to head coach on July 6, 2013. Athletic director Barry Collier said Miller was his first thought when Stevens left. After interviewing Miller, Collier had a gut feeling he was the right man for the job, a feeling that did not change after he interviewed other candidates and weighed the decision. He remarked, \"As a player, assistant coach, and person, Brandon has exemplified The Butler Way and brings a blend of energy, talent and integrity to this role. With Brandon's leadership, Butler is well positioned to expand upon the success of the last few years.\" Miller called it a childhood dream come true, and said he had no plans to change the team's core values. \"The same goals we had a week ago are still our goals today\", he remarked. He retained Butler's other assistant coaches – Michael Lewis and Terry Johnson – on his staff.\nReaction to the promotion of Miller was favorable. Jeff Goodman of ESPN predicted Miller would succeed because he is smart and \"shares many of the same values and character traits\" of past Butler coaches. Matt Norlander of CBS Sports said Miller was the \"right guy\" for the job, but said Butler was facing \"huge challenges in the coming years.\" \"Indianapolis Star\" reporter Bob Kravitz said the hire was exactly what one would expect from Butler and that it was \"impossible\" and \"foolish\" to argue that it was the wrong choice for the program. Speaking on behalf of the Butler players, Michael Volovic remarked \"everyone is really excited to play for coach Miller.\"\nAfter the announcement, Stevens called Miller \"one of the best and brightest I've ever been around\". According to Groce, \"[Miller] was known for his high basketball IQ, leadership skills and strong character [as a player]. Those traits carried over into his coaching, and his passion and love for the game of basketball have led him back to this profession\". Matta remarks \"Brandon is a person I had the utmost respect for as a player and now have for as a coach.\"\nIn Miller's first season, Butler struggled to a 14-17 record (4-14 in the Big East Conference) as the team battled injuries. It would turn out to be his only season on the job. On October 1, 2014, Miller abruptly went on a leave of absence to deal with an unspecified medical issue. Butler refused to elaborate, out of respect for Miller's privacy. Assistant coach Chris Holtmann served as interim coach. On January 2, 2015, Butler University announced that Miller would not be returning following his medical leave.\nPersonal life.\nAs of July 2013, Miller and his wife Holly had two young sons, Mason Allen, then age 6, and Michael David, then age 4. The couple first met in eighth grade. Off the court, Miller is described as kind and \"down-to-earth\". Brandon's brother-in-law, Daniel Cox, is now the head coach of basketball at New Castle High School, Miller's alma mater.\nMiller's older brother, Scott, is an optometrist. His younger sister, Lindsey, is nurse practitioner."

        "text": "The International Gay Bowling Organization (IGBO) represents over 5000 lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) members from Australia, Canada, Germany, New Zealand, United Kingdom and United States. The organization was established in 1980 to provide a collaborative sporting group within the LGBT community. The organization embraces the \"ideals of Unity, Fellowship and Communication\". By 2019, the group had more than 8,000 members. \nHistory.\nLGBT sports leagues began emerging in the United States in the 1970s, primarily as a social outlet for men and women who wished to fraternize with other homosexual amateur athletes in a non-bar atmosphere.\nIn 1989, the national tournament was held in Cincinnati, Ohio, and featured 770 competitors. Stand-up comedian Judy Tenuta performed during the first night of the event.\nOver the past 30 years, the IGBO has dealt with topical issues such as increasing participation by women, memorializing members who have succumbed to AIDS, raising funds for charitable organizations and the ongoing pursuit of increasing membership worldwide.\nThe organization's participation levels younger bowlers has somewhat lowered in part due to more favorable public opinion of LGBT persons; however, many younger members have left the organization as a result of poor management from both the executive board as well as league leadership.\nStructure.\nIGBO is a membership-based organization of member leagues, tournaments and individuals (associates). Leagues and tournaments join IGBO to network and promote their events across the organization. Individuals can become a part of IGBO by joining a member league or individually as an associate member.\nIGBO conducts business through a board of elected volunteers and a series of committees. Twice annually, in November and May, IGBO conducts a conference to gather representatives from member leagues and tournaments and conduct business."

        "title": "1999 Serena Williams tennis season",
        "text": "The Serena Williams 1999 season was her breakthrough season, winning her first career title at the Open Gaz de France and winning her first slam at the US Open.\nYear summary.\nEarly hard court season.\nAt the Australian Open, Williams lost in the third round to Sandrine Testud despite holding two match points. After two losses in tight three-setters in Australia, at the hands of Testud in Melbourne and Steffi Graf in Sydney, Williams won her first professional singles title when she defeated Amélie Mauresmo in the final of the Open Gaz de France in Paris, thus becoming the 13th unseeded player to win a Tier II or higher event since 1980. With Venus also winning the IGA Superthrift Classic in Memphis, Tennessee, that day, the pair became the first sisters to win professional tournaments in the same week.\nIn March of that year, at the Evert Cup in California, Williams won her first WTA 1000 event, defeating a 29-year-old Steffi Graf in the final, thus ending Graf's completed finals winning streak at 20, which dated back to 1995. Soon afterward at the Miami Masters, Williams had her 16-match winning streak ended by her sister in the first all-sister singles final in WTA history and the first all-sister women's final in 115 years, with the only other such final taking place at Wimbledon in 1884, when Maud Watson beat her older sister, Lilian, to become Wimbledon's first female champion. This was the best winning streak that includes a player's first title since Steffi Graf's 23-match streak in 1986. Williams then made her top-10 debut, at No. 9.\nClay court season.\nWilliams lost in the quarterfinals of the Italian Open and the German Open. At the French Open, Williams lost in the third round to Mary Joe Fernández, but in the doubles event, she and Venus did not drop a single set en route to the final, where they defeated the pair of Martina Hingis and Anna Kournikova, who were the self-proclaimed \"Spice Girls\" of tennis, having dropped just a single set on their route to the Australian Open doubles title. It was the first major title for the Williams sisters and would be their first step towards completing the career Golden Slam in doubles.\nWilliams then missed Wimbledon because of injury. When she returned to the tour two months later, Williams made her Fed Cup debut. After a two-and-a-half-hour rain delay and with Monica Seles unavailable, the USTA and U.S. captain Billie Jean King turned to her other rookie, 17-year-old Serena, to try to close out the tie. Williams did just that, toppling Rita Grande, 6-1, 6-1, in 50 minutes, thus sending the U.S. back to the final for the first time since 1996. In doing so at 17 years and nine months old, she became the sixth youngest player in US Fed Cup history to win a match. The Williams sisters, who were traveling internationally without their parents for the first time in their careers, then teamed up to win the dead doubles rubber against Tathiana Garbin and Adriana Serra Zanetti, to cap a perfect debut. She then won her third title at the JPMorgan Chase Open in Los Angeles, beating Julie Halard-Decugis in the final. This moved her ranking back into the Top 10 at No. 9, tying her career high. \nLate hard court season.\nAt the US Open, Williams defeated Grand Slam champions Kim Clijsters, Conchita Martínez, Monica Seles, and defending champion Lindsay Davenport in consecutive matches to reach the final, where she faced the world No. 1, the 18-year-old Martina Hingis, who had defeated her sister in the semifinals and also in the 1997 US Open final. She finished the job that her sister could not by beating Hingis 6–3, 7–6(7–4) to capture her first US Open title at age 17 in only her second year as a pro; she won despite making 57 unforced errors, 33 more than Hingis. In doing so, she became the lowest seed to win the US Open in the Open era, the sixth American woman in the Open Era to win a Major, and only the second African-American woman, after Althea Gibson in 1958, to win a Grand Slam singles tournament.\nIn the doubles event, the Williams sisters defeated Chanda Rubin and Sandrine Testud in the final, 4–6, 6–1, 6–4 to win the women's doubles title. It was the second doubles major title for the Williams sisters, and their second step towards completing the career Golden Slam in doubles. Serena thus became the fifth woman in the Open Era to win both the singles and doubles event of a major, while she and Venus became the first sisters to win a US Open doubles championship in 101 years, since Juliette and Kathleen Atkinson accomplished it in 1897 and 1898. In total, the Williams girls earned $1.29 million for their two-week US Open travel, $915,000 of it reeled in by Serena.\nTo complete her 1999 season, Williams teamed up with Venus to win a doubles match in the Fed Cup final to help Team USA win the 1999 Fed Cup title against Russia at the Taube Family Tennis Stadium in Stanford, Calif. Williams ended the year ranked in a career-high world No. 4 in just her second full year on the main tour.\nTournament schedule.\nSingles schedule.\nWilliams' 1999 singles tournament schedule is as follows:\nDoubles schedule.\nWilliams' 1999 doubles tournament schedule is as follows:\nMixed doubles schedule.\nWilliams' 1999 doubles tournament schedule is as follows:"

        "title": "Asian nations at the FIFA World Cup",
        "text": "Association football is among the most popular sports in Asia, with 13 members of the Asian Football Confederation having competed at the sport's biggest international event, the men's FIFA World Cup. The highest ranked result in the World Cup for an Asian team is 4th place in the 2002 FIFA World Cup by South Korea.\nResults.\nTeam results by tournament.\nThe team ranking in each tournament is according to FIFA. The rankings, apart from the top four positions (top two in 1930), are not a result of direct competition between the teams; instead, teams eliminated in the same round are ranked by their full results in the tournament.\nFor each tournament, the number of teams in each finals tournament (in brackets) are shown.\nOverall team records.\nAs per statistical convention in football, matches decided in extra time are counted as wins and losses, while matches decided by penalty shoot-outs are counted as draws. 3 points per win, 1 point per draw and 0 points per loss.\nAppearances.\nNot qualified.\n34 of the 46 active FIFA and AFC members have never appeared in the final tournament.\nSummary of performance.\nThis table shows the number of countries represented at the World Cup, the number of entries (#E) from around the world including any rejections and withdrawals, the number of Asian entries (#A), how many of those Asian entries withdrawn (#A-) before/during qualification or were rejected by FIFA, the Asian representatives at the World Cup finals, the number of World Cup Qualifiers each Asian representative had to play to get to the World Cup (#WCQ), the furthest stage reached, results, and coaches.\nCompetitive record.\n1938: The first Asian nation at the World Cup.\nThe Indonesian team, prior to independence in 1945 (as the Dutch East Indies). Indonesia was the first Asian team to participate in the FIFA World Cup when the team qualified for the 1938 tournament after its opponent, Japan, withdrew from the qualification heats. The 6–0 loss to eventual finalists Hungary in the first round of the tournament in Reims, France, remains the nation's only appearance in the World Cup. The straight knock-out format used at the time made it the only game ever played by the Indonesians. Thus, Indonesia holds the World Cup record as the team with the fewest matches played (1) and one of the teams with the fewest goals scored (0). They were 15th place in the rankings.\n1950: India's withdrawal.\nBurma, Philippines and Indonesia withdrew before the draw, so India qualified automatically. India later also withdrew because of the expense of traveling. Other teams economized by sailing, rather than flying, to the tournament. FIFA decided not to invite another team, leaving the World Cup three teams short.\n1954: South Korea's first World Cup.\nIn the 1954 FIFA World Cup qualification, the Asian zone was allocated one place (out of 16) in the final tournament. In the 1954 World Cup qualification, three countries from the AFC participated. China PR withdrew, South Korea won against Japan and for the first time qualified for the World Cup. South Korea lost twice 0–9 to Hungary and 0–7 to Turkey. They were 16th place in the rankings.\n1958–1962: World Cup without Asia.\nAt the 1958 World Cup qualification, FIFA rejected South Korea's entry. Qualifications were held with Africa, Turkey, Cyprus and China PR withdrew in the first qualification round, Indonesia and Egypt in second. Sudan withdrew in the final qualification round as they refused to play against Israel for political reasons. Israel technically would have qualified automatically, but before the qualification rounds began, FIFA ruled that no team would qualify without playing at least one match (except for the defending champions and the hosts), and Israel had yet to play any. A special play-off was created between Israel and the runner-up of one of the UEFA Groups, where the teams played against each other on a home-and-away basis, with the winner qualifying. After Belgium refused, Wales, the runner-up of UEFA Group 4, was the team drawn from the UEFA group runners-up. Israel lost both times 0–2 and did not reach the World Cup.\nThere was only one round of play at the 1962 FIFA World Cup qualification. The three teams played against each other on a home-and-away basis. The group winner would advance to the UEFA/AFC Intercontinental play-off. Indonesia withdrew. South Korea won twice against Japan and advanced to the UEFA/AFC Intercontinental play-off. South Korea lost both times against Yugoslavia and did not reach the World Cup.\n1966: North Korea's impressive performance.\nAFC, CAF, OFC confederations competed together in the qualification rounds. After having no teams from Africa or Asia qualifying for the previous two World Cups, FIFA decided to allocate a single spot to the winner of a four-way play-off between the winners of three African groups and the winner of the Asian zone. South Africa was suspended by FIFA due to apartheid. All 15 remaining African teams withdrew in protest against there being no automatic qualification for an African team, leaving the AFC–OFC winner to qualify by default. Japan then withdrew because the three-team tournament was moved from Japan to Cambodia, leaving only Australia and North Korea to contest the final place. Because North Korea lacked diplomatic relations with most countries, finding a suitable venue for the match proved difficult, until Head of State Norodom Sihanouk, an ally of Kim Il Sung, agreed to hosting the matches in Phnom Penh. North Korea easily won both legs to qualify. North Korea qualified for the eighth FIFA World Cup held in England.\nNorth Korea got to Group 4. North Korea predictably lost the first game against the USSR by 0–3, the second was 1–1 against Chile. However, in an upset North Korea beat Italy 1–0 at Ayresome Park, Middlesbrough, and finished above them, thus earning qualification to the next round along with the USSR. This was the first time that a nation from outside Europe or the Americas had progressed from the first stage of a World Cup. In their match against Portugal, they lead 3–0 after only 22 minutes. Portugal's Eusébio changed the pace, scoring four goals in the game and José Augusto added a fifth in the 78th minute to earn Portugal a 5–3 win. In a 1999 documentary featuring interviews with surviving members of the team, they describe themselves as having been welcomed home as national heroes.\n1970: Israel debut at the World Cup.\nThe 1970 AFC and OFC FIFA World Cup qualification were held together. Israel, New Zealand and Rhodesia received byes and advanced to the second round directly. The remaining three teams, Australia, Japan and South Korea, played against each other twice in South Korea. Australia advanced to the second round Group 1 and won over Rhodesia and advanced to the final round. In Group 2, Israel advanced to the final round when they defeated New Zealand twice. North Korea, despite their good performance in the previous tournament staged in England in 1966, refused to play in Israel and withdrew. In the final round, Israel defeated Australia 2–1 on aggregate and reached the World Cup. Israel qualified for their only World Cup to date as an Asian team. Soon after this, however, they left the Asian Football Confederation, and now compete in the European zone as they are now a member of UEFA. As of 2018, this is Israel's only World Cup finals appearance.\nIsrael lost their first game 0–2 against Uruguay, the other ended in a 1–1 draw against Sweden and 0–0 with Italy. Israel ranked last in the group and did not advance in the tournament. The team finished 13th out of 16 teams.\n1974: Another World Cup without Asian nations.\nThe Asian and Oceania zone competed for one place in the World Cup. India, Sri Lanka and the Philippines withdrew before the matches were played. The remaining 15 teams were divided into two zones, based on geographical and political considerations. Zone A had 7 teams (teams from East Asia, plus Israel). All matches were played in the Republic of Korea. Zone B had 8 teams (teams from West Asia and Oceania, plus Indonesia and North Korea). South Korea won Zone A and Australia Zone B. In the final round, South Korea and Australia were tied 2–2 on aggregate, and a play-off on neutral ground in Hong Kong was played to decide the qualifier. Australia won this match through a Jimmy Mackay goal, scored off a free kick.\n1978: Iran's debut.\nA total of 21 AFC and OFC teams and Israel entered the competition. However, South Vietnam could not compete after being annexed by Vietnam. The Asian zone was allocated one place (out of 16) in the final tournament. The 21 teams would be divided into 5 groups. Sri Lanka, North Korea, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates withdrew. Hong Kong, South Korea, Iran, Kuwait and Australia won in their group. Iran won the final group and qualified for the FIFA World Cup for the first time.\nThe group consisted of Iran, Netherlands, Peru and Scotland. Iran, the reigning Asian champion, went out of the tournament winless. Iran lost two of their three group stage games: 0–3 against the Netherlands and 1–4 against Peru. However, they managed to draw 1–1 against Scotland with a late Iraj Danaeifard goal. The team finished 14th out of the 16 teams.\n1982: Kuwait's debut.\nA total of 21 AFC and OFC teams entered the qualification. Iran withdrew before the draw was made. The Asian and Oceania zone was allocated two places (out of 24) in the final tournament. The remaining 20 teams would be divided into four groups. New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and China PR advanced to the Final Round. In the Final Round, Kuwait ranked first place and immediately qualified to the World Cup. China PR and New Zealand finished level on points and goal difference, and a play-off on neutral ground (Singapore) was played to decide the qualifier. Kuwait won 2–1 and qualified to the World Cup for the first time.\nKuwait's group consisted of Czechoslovakia, England and France. In the opening match, Kuwait held Czechoslovakia to a 1–1 draw. In the game between Kuwait and France, with France leading 3–1, France midfielder Alain Giresse scored a goal vehemently contested by the Kuwait team, who had stopped play after hearing a piercing whistle from the stands, which they thought had come from Soviet referee Miroslav Stupar. Play had not yet resumed when Sheikh Fahid Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, brother of the Kuwaiti Emir and president of the Kuwaiti Football Association, rushed onto the pitch to remonstrate with the referee. Stupar countermanded his initial decision and disallowed the goal to the fury of the French. Maxime Bossis scored another valid goal a few minutes later and France won 4–1. Kuwait lost the third game 0–1 against England. Kuwait finished fourth in their group and 21st out of the 24 teams.\n1986: Iraq's debut, South Korea's return.\nA total of 27 AFC teams entered the competition. The Asian zone was allocated two places (out of 24) in the final tournament. Teams were divided into two zones, based on geographical considerations. Zone A had 13 teams (teams from West Asia) and Zone B had 14 teams (teams from East Asia). Lebanon, Oman withdrew. Iran were disqualified. Iraq won Zone A Final Round, South Korea won Zone B. Iraq and South Korea qualified for the 1986 World Cup.\nAs of 2018, this was the last time Iraq qualified for the finals. Iraq lost all three games: 0–1 against Paraguay, 1–2 against Belgium and 0–1 against Mexico, and finished 23 out of the 24 teams. However the defeat to Paraguay was controversial, as Iraq's Ahmed Radhi had scored a header from a corner right at the end of the first half which the referee disallowed as he incorrectly blew the whistle for half-time just before the header went into the back of the net. The defeat to Belgium was also controversial as the referee gave a yellow card to Iraq's Basil Gorgis in a case of mistaken identity (the yellow was supposed to be given to Ghanim Oraibi) while the score was 0–2. Gorgis sarcastically applauded the referee's incorrect decision which led to him getting sent off and Iraq lost 1–2. South Korea qualified for the first time since 1954. In its first game, South Korea lost 1–3 against Argentina, in the second game drew Bulgaria 1–1 in a downpour and in the third lost 2–3 against Italy. South Korea finished 20 out of the 24 teams.\n1990: United Arab Emirates first World Cup.\nTwenty-six teams were in the running for these spots; Bahrain, India, Maldives and South Yemen withdrew without playing a qualifying match. The Maldives withdrew before the final draw, leaving 25 teams to be divided into six groups of four or five teams each. South Korea, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, China PR, Saudi Arabia and North Korea advanced to the Final Round. South Korea and the United Arab Emirates qualified for the 1990 World Cup, taking the first two places.\nThe United Arab Emirates qualified for the FIFA World Cup for the first time, its only appearance to date, but lost all three of its games: 2–0 to Colombia, 5–1 to West Germany and 4–1 to Yugoslavia. All three of the UAE's first round opponents reached the last 16. They were 24th (and last) place in the rankings. South Korea also lost all its three games: 0–2 to Belgium, 1–3 to Spain and 0–1 to Uruguay, and finished 22 out of 24 teams.\n1994: Saudi Arabia reaches the Round of 16.\nA total of 30 teams entered the qualification. The Asian zone was allocated two places (out of 24) in the final tournament. The 30 teams were divided into six groups of five teams each, although Myanmar and Nepal withdrew after playing no match. The teams would play against each other twice. The group winners would advance to the Final Round. Iraq, Iran, North Korea, South Korea, Saudi Arabia and Japan advanced to the Final Round, with Saudi Arabia and South Korea taking the first two places in the World Cup.\nSaudi Arabia qualified for the World Cup finals for the first time. Their group consisted of Belgium, Netherlands, Saudi Arabia and Morocco. Saudi Arabia lost its first game 1–2 against Netherlands, although they scored the first goal. Later, they beat Morocco 2–1. Against Belgium, Saudi player Saaed Al-Owairan ran from his own half through a maze of Belgian players to score the game's only goal. With three teams on an identical 6 points and an identical goal difference of +1, there was little to separate the top three, and all three qualified for the second round: but Netherlands and Saudi Arabia were ranked in the first two places (with guaranteed qualification) ahead of Belgium (in third place and having to rely on being one of the four best third-placed teams) on goals scored, with the Dutch further ranked ahead of the Saudis by virtue of having defeated them in the match between the sides. Saudi Arabia wrote history by become the first Asian team since North Korea (also a debutant at the time) in 1966 to reach the knockout stage. In the first knockout stage match, Saudi Arabia faced Sweden and lost 1–3 after two goals from Kennet Andersson and one from Martin Dahlin. They were 12th place in the rankings.\nSouth Korea's World Cup began with two draws against Spain (2–2) and Bolivia (0–0). However they lost the decisive match 2–3 against title holders Germany, being 3-0 down after 20 minutes, pulling two goals back shortly after half-time but being unable to force an equalizer. They finished at 20th place in the rankings, and more importantly, lowest of the six third-placed teams, of which the top four qualified for the second round.\n1998: Four Asian nations at the World Cup.\nA total of 36 teams entered the competition. The Asian zone was allocated 3.5 places (out of 32) in the final tournament, with three qualifiers by right and a fourth to play off against the winners of the Oceania qualifying tournament. The 36 teams were reduced to 10 by preliminary qualifying matches, who were drawn into two groups of five. Saudi Arabia and South Korea qualified automatically as group winners for the 1998 World Cup. Japan and Iran, the two second-placed teams, played off in a single match at a neutral venue, Japan won 3-2 after extra time and qualified for the first time. Iran, fourth in the qualifying tournament after losing to Japan, had to play off against the winners of the Oceania tournament, which was Australia. In a two-legged tie played home and away, both matches were drawn, 1–1 in Iran and 2–2 in Australia, Iran qualifying by scoring more \"away\" goals after coming back from 2-0 down.\nSaudi Arabia.\nSaudi Arabia were placed in Group C alongside South Africa, Denmark and hosts France. Saudi Arabia started with a 1–0 defeat by Denmark. Next, France scored four to eliminate Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia (0–2–0), which again failed to show any resemblance to the 1994 team that reached the second round, played most of the game with ten men after defender Mohammed Al-Khilaiwi was given a direct red card in the 19th minute for a poor tackle on Bixente Lizarazu. Forward Thierry Henry scored two goals, while David Trezeguet and Lizarazu scored one each for France. With two goals against Saudi Arabia, South Africa led but watched in horror as the Saudis scored on two penalty kicks to gain a 2–2 draw. The Saudis entered the match under new coach Mohammed al-Kharashi, a longtime assistant, after Brazilian Carlos Alberto Parreira was fired following the 4–0 loss to France.\nJapan.\nJapan lost all three of its matches in its debut, however Japan demonstrated relatively good performance for a debutant, with all three losses were just minimal. In the first, it fell 1–0 to Argentina, with Gabriel Batistuta scoring for the opponents, knocking the ball over the Japanese goalkeeper on the edge of the penalty area. In the second match, against Croatia, a late Davor Šuker goal ensured a 1–0 Croatia victory and his nation's progression to the next round, simultaneously eliminating Japan from the tournament. Japan's World Cup campaign officially ended with an unexpected 2–1 defeat to rank outsiders Jamaica. Two goals from Theodore Whitmore gave Jamaica their first ever win in the World Cup finals, although Masashi Nakayama had the honour of scoring Japan's first-ever goal at the World Cup finals, which came in the 74th minute.\nIran.\nIran's first game of Group F was played against Yugoslavia, a 1–0 loss instigated by a Siniša Mihajlović free-kick. Iran recorded their first World Cup victory in the second game, beating the United States 2–1, with Hamid Estili and Mehdi Mahdavikia scoring goals for Iran. The Iran–U.S. World Cup match was preheated with much excitement owing to each country's political stance after the Iranian Revolution. In an act of defiance against all forms of hatred or politics in sports, however, both sides presented one another with gifts and flowers and took ceremonial pictures before the match kickoff. Following the defeat by Iran, the U.S. were eliminated from the World Cup. Iran played Germany in the third game, where they lost 2–0. German goals were scored from Oliver Bierhoff and Jürgen Klinsmann. The one win and two defeats left Iran third in the final group standings, not enough for progression to the next round.\nSouth Korea.\nSouth Korea entered the 1998 World Cup without a single win to their name despite 14 World Cup games' experience. South Korea played Mexico, the Netherlands and Belgium. In the first game, South Korea lead in the 27th minute thanks to a Ha Seok-ju free-kick that was deflected into the Mexican goal. A couple of minutes after the goal was scored, however, Ha Seok-ju was sent off for a bad challenge from behind, and Mexico leveled the score through half-time substitute Ricardo Peláez. With approximately 15 minutes remaining, Luis Hernández put Mexico in the lead with a simple tap-in. Hernández then went on to complete the victory after scoring Mexico's third goal. South Korea had to wait four more years to record their first ever victory in a World Cup: its next game against the Netherlands was a heavy 0–5 defeat, the third-worst loss in the nation's World Cup history. Its third game was against Belgium. A big win would have given Belgium a chance of progressing and an early goal by Luc Nilis might have set them on the way. The Koreans, however, mounted stiff resistance and in the second half, and Yoo Sang-chul scored the equaliser in an eventual 1–1 draw.\n2002: South Korea and Japan host the World Cup.\nSouth Korea and Japan were selected as hosts by FIFA on 31 May 1996. Initially, South Korea, Japan and Mexico presented three rival bids. However, the two Asian countries agreed to unite their bids shortly before the decision was made, and they were chosen unanimously in preference to Mexico. This was the first World Cup to be hosted by two or more countries. The 2002 World Cup was the tournament's 17th staging. It was also the first World Cup held in Asia, and the last in which the golden goal rule was utilized. South Korea and Japan, the co-hosts, qualified automatically, leaving 2.5 spots open for competition between 40 teams. Myanmar withdrew from the tournament after being placed in Group 2 but before any matches had been played, therefore reducing the group to three teams. Afghanistan, Bhutan, North Korea and Timor-Leste did not participate in the qualification process. Asia's two remaining automatic qualifying berths were taken by Saudi Arabia and China PR. Iran failed to become a third Asian representative in the World Cup after losing their AFC/UEFA playoff against the Republic of Ireland.\nChina PR.\nChina PR qualified for the finals for the first time. Coached by Bora Milutinović (the fifth national team he coached in five consecutive World Cups), the nation failed to earn a point or even score a goal. As football is widely followed in China, national team success is considered to be a source of national pride. Around 300 million people tuned into broadcasts of China's 2002 World Cup matches, with a staggering 170 million new television sets being bought by citizens in order to watch their nation's first World Cup appearance. Its first game was against Costa Rica. Costa Rica dealt China PR a harsh blow by taking the lead against the run of play on 61 minutes. Rónald Gómez's slick backheel played Paulo Wanchope in, and Wu Chengying's challenge only popped the ball up for Gómez to fire in a left-foot shot. China PR had no time to gather their thoughts before they were 2–0 down. China's PR best moment of the first-half came on 39 minutes when they broke quickly after fending off a Costa Rica free-kick. Its second game against Brazil was a 0–4 defeat. China PR looked lively and appeared to be enjoying themselves, even when they overhit the ball, but China PR could not do anything about Roberto Carlos's left-footed free-kick goal in the 15th minute. Ronaldo then scored two and Ronaldinho one to effectively end the match. China PR searched for their first goal of the tournament in their third match, against Turkey. After just ten minutes, however, they were already down 0–2. Just before the half-hour mark, China PR almost scored their first goal of the tournament when Yang Chen hit the post. Hasan Şaş again set up Turkey with a cross to the far post, this time for Ümit Davala to score off the post. China PR failed to score a goal and was eliminated from the tournament.\nSouth Korea.\nSouth Korea beat Poland 2–0 after Hwang Sun-hong and Yoo Sang-chul scored. The first real chance for the home side came in the 20th minute, when Yoo Sang-chul shot across the face of an outstretched Jerzy Dudek. South Korea started to apply more pressure and took the lead in the 25th minute: Lee Eul-yong played the ball into Hwang Sun-hong, who hit the ball first-time into the net. In the 53rd minute, South Korea scored their second goal: Yoo Sang-chul ran towards Tomasz Wałdoch and Radosław Kałużny, then confidently shot between them and past goalkeeper Dudek. Even the President of Korea waved his hat at the goal, which secured South Korea's first-ever win at the World Cup finals. In its second match, against the United States, the game's first real scoring chance fell to the U.S.' Clint Mathis, who scored with a left-footed drive from the middle of the penalty area. Later on, in the 78th minute, an Ahn Jung-hwan glancing header completely stunned American goalkeeper Brad Friedel, who seemed rooted to the spot as the ball sailed into the net. South Korea missed the chance to take all three points right at the end when Choi Yong-soo stabbed another shot over the bar, with only Friedel to beat. South Korea played its third match against Portugal, needing a win to be guaranteed a place in the second round, though earning one point would suffice (for the U.S. as well, however).\nThe South Koreans tore apart a Portuguese side who had João Pinto and Beto sent off. In the 70th minute, Park Ji-sung smashed in a brilliant goal for Korea to secure a 1–0 victory and Korea's progression to the next round. Here, South Korea beat Italy 2–1 in sudden-death extra time. In the 18th minute, Christian Vieri headed Italy into the lead from a Francesco Totti corner. Ahn Jung-hwan had the best chance for Korea in the 36th minute when he shot over the bar from close range. Two minutes from time, the stadium erupted as Italy defender Christian Panucci failed to clear the ball, with Seol Ki-hyun pouncing on his mistake. Totti received his second yellow card for diving in the penalty area. Ten-men Italy finally fell to a 117th-minute, golden goal header scored by Ahn Jung-hwan, who at the time was ironically playing for Italian club Perugia.\nIn the quarter-finals, Spain were unable to win a second consecutive penalty shootout, losing to South Korea after having two goals controversially disallowed in normal time, with South Korea becoming the first (and, as of 2018, the only) team from outside Europe and the Americas to reach the last four of a World Cup. Four minutes after the restart, a Spanish goal was disallowed, while a second Spanish goal was disallowed after the linesman judged that the ball had gone out of play before Fernando Morientes headed the ball into the net. In the 100th minute, Morientes turned on a long throw-in and crashed his shot against the left post. Korea won 5–3 on penalties and became the first ever Asian nation to reach the semi-finals of the World Cup, where they would face Germany.\nThe match started slowly: South Korea kept possession well and Germany appeared content to keep the volume of the crowd down, with both sides entering half-time level at 0–0. In the 75th minute, however, Michael Ballack ran on to Oliver Neuville's low cross; his shot was blocked by goalkeeper Lee Woon-jae, but Ballack followed up to convert the rebound and secure Germany's place in the final with a 1–0 victory. With the semi-final defeat, Korea contested the third-place match in Daegu against the other defeated semi-finalist, Turkey. Turkey, however, won third place after an entertaining 3–2 victory in a match that included the fastest ever World Cup goal, scored by Parma striker Hakan Şükür after just 11 seconds. Lee Eul-yong replied in the ninth minute with a curling free-kick into the top right-hand corner, but shortly after, İlhan Mansız put Turkey back in front in the 13th minute after splitting the South Korean defence by playing a swift one-two with Şükür. Song Chong-gug then managed to stun Turkey goalkeeper Rüştü Reçber when his long-range shot deflected off of Cha Du-ri's bottom, in injury time, for a last consolation goal that ended the game on a slight high note for the home fans.\nSaudi Arabia.\nSaudi Arabia were eliminated as the worst team in tournament, after three defeats and no goals scored, including an 0–8 loss to Germany, 0–1 to Cameroon and 0–3 to the Republic of Ireland.\nJapan.\nHosts Japan topped their group with two wins and one draw. In the first match, they drew 2–2 with Belgium. Marc Wilmots broke the deadlock with a beautiful overhead kick in the 57th minute. Two minutes later, Japan's Takayuki Suzuki, in the penalty area, got a foot on to Shinji Ono's pass from the half-way line. In the 67th minute, Arsenal's Junichi Inamoto ran through three defenders to give Japan a 2–1 lead. Five minutes later, the stadium was momentarily silenced when Peter Van Der Heyden, beating the offside trap on the edge of the area, neatly lobbed Japan goalkeeper Seigo Narazaki as he came off his line. Japan advanced to the second round with a 1–0 win over Russia and a 2–0 victory against Tunisia. Japan register their first ever World Cup finals victory. However, they subsequently exited the tournament during the Round of 16 after a 1–0 defeat to Turkey. Ümit Davala headed Turkey into the lead from an Ergün Penbe's corner in the 12th minute. An Alessandro Santos free-kick crashed against the woodwork later on to give the Japanese some hope for the second-half. Japan made a couple of substitutions at half-time as they looked for fresh initiative. Hidetoshi Nakata deflected shot almost troubled Turkish goalkeeper Rüştü Reçber. Japan continued to look for the equaliser, with Akinori Nishizawa's header on target and Tomokazu Myojin shooting just narrowly wide. With ten minutes left in the game, Nishizawa's shot flew over the bar and with it Japan's hopes of a place in the quarter-finals.\n2006: Setback of Asia.\nForty-four Asian teams are affiliated with FIFA, but Cambodia, Philippines, Bhutan and Brunei decided not to take part, while Myanmar was banned from the competition, so a total of 39 teams took part to compete for 4.5 places in the World Cup. Qualification matches reduced them to two 4-team groups. Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Japan and Iran as the top two in each group qualified for the 2006 World Cup finals. The two third-placed teams played off (Bahrain and Uzbekistan drew 1–1 over two legs, Bahrain progressing on the away goals rule) for the right to face the fourth-placed CONCACAF team, but the result of this was that Bahrain lost 2–1 to Trinidad &amp; Tobago. The tournament was a disappointment for teams from Asia, as none of them managed to reach the knockout stage.\nIran.\nIran returned to World Cup after missing the 2002 edition and started their campaign with high expectations from fans and media. Their first match was against Mexico in Group D. The game was level 1–1 at the half-time, but Iran lost at the end because of a defensive mistake, and the match finished 3–1, with goals scored by Omar Bravo and Zinha for Mexico and Yahya Golmohammadi for Iran. Iran then played Portugal in the second game, losing 2–0; goals were scored by Deco and Cristiano Ronaldo, the latter from a penalty. The two losses meant Iran was eliminated from the competition even before contesting their third and final game against Angola. Iran drew 1–1, with Sohrab Bakhtiarizadeh scoring the Iran goal to send Iran bottom of their group with only a point.\nJapan.\nJapan also failed to advance to the Round of 16 after finishing the group without a win, losing to Australia 1–3 in the first match. In the 26th minute, Shunsuke Nakamura scored the first goal, only for Australia to respond with three late goals in the 84th, 89th and 92nd minutes. In game two, Japan drew with Croatia 0–0. After defeats in the opening game, both Japan and Croatia seemed reluctant to take any early risks and for 20 minutes, little appeared to transpire. In the 21st minute, however, Niko Kranjčar missed penalty, while five minutes into the second-half, the ball arrived at the far post only for Atsushi Yanagisawa to horrendously miss an open goal, skewing the ball back across the goalmouth. In Japan's third match, it lost to world's powerhouse Brazil 1–4, despite scoring the game's first goal, in the 34th minute, from Keiji Tamada, and finished bottom.\nSouth Korea.\nSouth Korea won its first match 2–1, against Togo; goals were scored by Lee Chun-soo and Ahn Jung-hwan. The victory marked Korea's their first World Cup finals win outside of home soil. In the second game, a 1–1 draw with France, Thierry Henry scored in the ninth minute, but Park Ji-sung leveled the score in 80th minute. Before the last match, against Switzerland, South Korea had a strong chance to reach the round of 16, in which only a draw would ensure the Koreans into the knockout stage, in case of France fail to beat Togo. However, the match ended in a complete disappointment for South Korea: Switzerland scored first from a Philippe Senderos headed a goal off a Hakan Yakin free-kick in the 23rd minute. France went ahead against Togo in the 55th minute, and as South Korea struggled to find the net of Switzerland, the Swiss star striker, Alexander Frei, doubled Switzerland's lead with 13 minutes to play while France won their match, resulting in South Korea's elimination from the competition with total disbelief from fans.\nSaudi Arabia.\nSaudi Arabia, like Iran and Japan, went out without a win and finished last. The Saudis drew the first match 2–2 with Tunisia; Saudi Arabia had the lead as late as the 93rd minute, but Radhi Jaidi leveled the score. The Saudis' next game was against Ukraine, ended in a complete 0–4 defeat. Saudi Arabia knew before kick-off that they had to score at least four goals to stand a chance of qualifying, but hope was small when their next opponent was Spain. Thus, survival was clearly priority number one as they allowed Spain, who had changed their entire first 11, to feel their way into the match. Juanito scored at the 39th minute and buried their chances of progression beyond the group stage.\n2010: South Korea and Japan reach the Round of 16, North Korea's return.\nForty-three teams competed for spots at the 2010 World Cup; Laos, Brunei and the Philippines did not enter qualification. This was the first time Timor-Leste competed in World Cup qualification and the first time Australia attempted to qualify as a member of the AFC, having moved from the Oceania Football Confederation at the start of 2006. Asia's four automatic qualifying berths were taken by Australia, Japan, North Korea and South Korea, collectively filling the top two places in two five-team groups. The two third-played teams, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, played off for fifth place and the right to face an intercontinental playoff, against the winners of the Oceania qualifying group: and for the second World Cup in a row, Bahrain won the fifth-place Asian playoff on away goals, but lost the intercontinental playoff - this time to New Zealand.\nNorth Korea.\nNorth Korea qualified for the first time since 1966; they were drawn into Group G, and played their first match against five-time winners Brazil on 15 June. Brazil won 2–1 in a game where North Korea were well organised defensively and showed resilience, frustrating the Brazilians. Despite their best efforts, however, they were nevertheless outmatched and eventually broken down. Maicon's relief was visible after his goal to finally put Brazil ahead. Their next game was against Portugal on 21 June, where they suffered a heavy 0–7 defeat. Despite starting well (much like against the Brazilians), with a defensive, well organised approach, once Portugal scored the first, the North Korean defense unfolded and the following six goals were scored with relative ease. In North Korea's last match, against the Ivory Coast on 25 June, the team fell 3–0. After losing all three matches in the group stages, North Korea were eliminated, finishing last in Group G with no point.\nSouth Korea.\nSouth Korea were drawn into Group B alongside Argentina, Nigeria and Greece. South Korea registered the first win at the 2010 World Cup with a 2–0 victory over Greece, with goals scored by Lee Jung-soo and captain Park Ji-sung. In the second match, South Korea fell to Argentina 1–4, with striker Gonzalo Higuaín scoring a hat-trick and Park Chu-young scoring an own goal for the Argentines; Lee Chung-yong scored Korea's consolation goal. South Korea coach Huh Jung-moo, who played against Argentina's Diego Maradona at the 1986 World Cup, saw his team struggle to live with Argentina's quick tempo and the quality of their pass-and-move football. The decisive match was with Nigeria, which ended 2–2 and with subsequent triumph for South Korea, because paired with Argentina's defeat of Greece, the draw sealed their first-ever progression beyond the group stage on foreign soil.\nAs Group B runners-up, South Korea faced Uruguay in the last 16. The South Koreans were effervescent in their attacking third but shaky in their defence, which was exposed as early as the eighth minute: Diego Forlán was fed on the left and played a low ball across the six-yard area, which was misjudged by goalkeeper Jung Sung-ryong and his statuesque defence but not by Luis Suárez at the far post, who calmly slotted in for his second goal of the competition. In the 68th minute, the South Koreans' luck change when, off of a free-kick, Bolton's Lee Chung-yong pounced on Mauricio Victorino's attempted headed clearance to score a nod-in from eight yards out; it was the first goal Uruguay had conceded in the tournament. With ten minutes remaining, Suárez lurked on the fringes of the 18-yard area as a corner was swung in from the right. He cut in from the left before curling in a well-struck shot that left goalkeeper Jung Sung-ryong rooted as the ball clipped the post on its way in. The South Koreans pressed and should have taken the game into extra-time, but substitute Lee Dong-gook's weak shot squirmed under the shirt of Fernando Muslera before it was comfortably cleared.\nAustralia.\nAustralia were drawn into Group D, which also featured three-time world champion Germany, Ghana and Serbia. On 14 June, Australia faced Germany in Durban; Pim Verbeek surprisingly chose to play without a recognised striker. Australia were comprehensively defeated 4–0, and Verbeek was heavily criticised for his tactics, with chief SBS Football Analyst Craig Foster calling for his immediate sacking.\nAustralia's second group match, against Ghana, resulted in a 1–1 draw. Australia shot its only goal early in the first half by Brett Holman after Ghana's goalkeeper Richard Kingson fumbled the ball following a Mark Bresciano free-kick. Shortly after, a goal-bound strike from Ghana's Jonathan Mensah was blocked on the goal line by Harry Kewell's upper arm, resulting in a penalty kick and a straight red card for Kewell. Ghanaian striker Asamoah Gyan scored the equalizing goal. Despite the man advantage, however, Ghana were mostly limited to long-range shots on Australia's goal, and some desperate defending from Australia saw the game finish a draw.\nIn their final group match, against Serbia, Tim Cahill was back from suspension and scored via a header in the second half to give Australia a 1–0 lead. Only four minutes later, Brett Holman doubled the scoreline with an impressive long-range effort. Late in the second half, Serbia managed to score a late goal through Marko Pantelić after Australian goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer fumbled the ball, with the game ultimately ending at 2–1. Germany had defeated Ghana 1–0, which meant that both Australia and Ghana finished on four points. Ghana, however, progressed to the knockout stage due to their superior goal difference. Verbeek completed his term as Australian coach at the end of the 2010 World Cup.\nJapan.\nJapan hung on to win their first-ever World Cup match on foreign soil, defeating Cameroon 1–0. The game's only goal came in the 39th minute when Keisuke Honda controlled a cross at the far post and stabbed the ball past goalkeeper Souleymanou Hamidou. In the second game, Japan lost 0–1 to the Netherlands. Wesley Sneijder's powerful 52nd-minute winner from just outside the box settled a fascinating Group E contest between two contrasting sides who opened up in the second half and were creating good chances right up to the final whistle. Loitering just outside the penalty area, Sneijder lashed a powerful right-foot shot towards goal that goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima could only deflect into the net despite being well-placed to make the save. Japan had the best chance to level the score one minute from time, but unmarked substitute Shinji Okazaki fired over the net from ten yards out.\nJapan's third, decisive match was against Denmark. Midfielder Keisuke Honda opened the scoreline, bending a 30-yard free-kick past Danish goalkeeper Thomas Sørensen in the 17th minute. Just 13 minutes later, teammate Yasuhito Endō fired past Sørensen's outstretched hand to make it 2–0 for Japan. Takeshi Okada's side had to survive a late scare as Jon Dahl Tomasson tapped in a rebound after goalkeeper Kawashima saved the Dane's penalty kick. However, substitute Shinji Okazaki's 88th-minute strike clinched second place in the group for Japan with a 3–1 victory.\nJapan faced Paraguay in the last 16. The match was decided by a penalty shootout after the score was locked at 0–0 for 120 minutes. Paraguay won the shootout and progressed to its first ever World Cup quarter-final. The match was a generally unexciting affair, as Japan adopted a defensive posture while Paraguay itself maintained a solid defence. The first-half produced the occasional chance on goal, with Lucas Barrios having a shot saved shortly before a long-distance shot from Daisuke Matsui hit the crossbar of Paraguay's goal. The second half was similar, with both sides producing occasional chances to score rather than periods of outright dominance. The result of the deadlock was extra time, which continued goalless. A penalty shootout ensued, during which Yuichi Komano missed a spot kick for Japan. Paraguay scored all five of its penalties, clinching the win and subsequent progression to the quarter-finals.\n2014: Disappointment for the Asians.\nThe 2014 FIFA World Cup, held in Brazil, marked the first time since 1990 where no Asian team managed to win a game, and where the AFC was the only FIFA confederation without both wins and teams represented in the knockout stages. Three of Asia's four qualifiers in 2010—Australia, Japan and South Korea—qualified for the 2014 tournament. Iran, meanwhile, qualified for the first time since 2006. Jordan and Uzbekistan played off for fifth-place (again as third-best teams from two groups), Jordan winning 9–8 on penalties after a 2–2 draw, but losing a subsequent intercontinental playoff - this time against CONMEBOL's fifth team, Uruguay.\nAustralia was eliminated early despite good performances against Chile and the Netherlands that both ended in close losses (1–3 and 2–3 respectively). In their third match, however, they were blown-out 3–0 to defending World Cup champions Spain, who were themselves also mathematically eliminated from the tournament. The Australian performance however, received praise from public fans for their determination in face of difficulties of their group, thus spared Australia from criticism unlike the rest of Asian teams.\nJapan opened the scoring in its first match against the Ivory Coast, but lost the lead en route to an eventual 1–2 defeat. In the following games, the Japanese failed to break Greece's tight defence and finished in a goalless draw even when Greece had only 10 men, and afterwards, despite equalizing Colombia at half-time, eventually lost 4–1 to ensure an early tournament exit.\nSouth Korea opened the score against Russia after a blunder by goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev, but wound up conceding the equalizing goal shortly after. A high-scoring match with Algeria had the Koreans defeated 4–2, and a 1–0 loss to Belgium ended South Korea's campaign.\nAfter an opening 0–0 draw with Nigeria, the Iranian defense held Argentina goalless for most of the match before a Lionel Messi goal in injury time. Needing to beat the already-eliminated Bosnia and Herzegovina to clinch the group's second spot in the knockout stages, Iran wound up defeated 3–1 and lost the chance to qualify.\n2018: Record five Asian teams at FIFA World Cup.\nThe 2018 FIFA World Cup, held in Russia, marked the first time five Asian teams qualified for the final tournament. 46 teams were whittled down to two groups of 6, with the now-usual format of two automatic qualifiers from both groups, plus a play-off between the third-placed teams for fifth place who would face a further intercontinental playoff. Iran, South Korea (from Group A), Japan and Saudi Arabia (from Group B) formed the four automatic qualifiers: Australia played off against Syria for fifth place, won it 3–2 in extra time over two legs, and played off against the fourth CONCACAF team. Australia's 3–1 victory over Honduras over two legs thus made the fifth AFC qualifier.\nOnly Japan advanced past the group stage, a feat aided by fair-play points in tie-breaking (after being level on points, goal-difference and goals scored), at the expense of Senegal with whom they drew 2–2 in the group stages: Japan also defeated Colombia 2–1 and lost to Poland 1–0. This was the first time that fair-play had been used as a tie-breaker in a World Cup group stage. Aside from Australia, who only got a draw and two defeats, the other three had at least one win: Saudi Arabia secured a 2–1 comeback victory over Egypt, Iran defeated Morocco, and in the biggest upset, South Korea beat the defending champions Germany. In the round of 16, Japan surprised a favoured Belgium and earned a 2–0 lead, only to suffer a 3–2 comeback, with the two goals scored by Belgium from Jan Vertonghen and Marouane Fellaini. The match ended with a Belgian goal by Nacer Chadli in the last minute of stoppage time.\n2022: Three out of six Asian teams reach the second round.\nThe 2022 FIFA World Cup was held in Qatar – the first time a single nation from the Asian federation had hosted it, after the joint hosting of Japan/South Korea in 2002: also the first time since the World Cup's earliest days, that a nation made their inaugural appearance as hosts without having previously qualified. Qatar thus being granted automatic qualification as hosts, Asia still retained their regular 4.5 qualifiers (4 automatic, 1 to go forward to an intercontinental playoff – this time the 5th Asian was drawn against the 5th CONMEBOL team). 46 nations entered. The first two rounds of qualification (the 12 lowest ranked teams playing off in the first round, to allow 6 to go through to the second stage and join the other 34) were combined with the qualification stages for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup, thus Qatar played in the second round but did not need to play in the subsequent stages. Qatar nevertheless won their second-round group: eight groups of five saw 12 qualifiers (7 group winners minus Qatar, and 5 second-place teams) sorted into a third round, of two groups of six. The second and third rounds in question was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, many matches being delayed or rearranged, and North Korea withdrew outright after having played five of their eight matches. Asia's World Cup qualifiers from the competition were the same teams as in 2018: once again Iran and South Korea topped Group A, while Saudi Arabia and Japan headed Group B. Australia once again qualified as Asia's fifth team, by winning the playoff of the third-placed teams (2–1 against the UAE) followed by the intercontinental playoff (5–4 on penalties following a 0–0 draw against Peru): both matches having to be reduced to single matches rather than two-leg home-and-away affairs, played at a neutral venue – in Qatar itself – only a few months before the World Cup, thanks to pandemic-related delays. Australia's victory meant that five Asian teams joined Qatar to make six Asian teams in the World Cup for the first time, of whom three were to get through the group stage to the second round. Following the end of the group stage in the first FIFA World Cup in a West Asian nation, by irony, the most successful Asian sides in this edition, were entirely made up of East Asian nations.\nQatar.\nThe hosts, drawn in a group with Ecuador, Senegal and the Netherlands, lost all three of their games. Ecuador beat them 2–0 in the opening match, a third goal being disallowed for offside by video assistance: Qatar scored their first and, as it turned out, only goal in a 3–1 defeat to Senegal: and then finally were defeated 2–0 by the Dutch, becoming the first tournament hosts to lose all their games at the World Cup. They were also the only Asian team to fail to win at least one match in this World Cup.\nIran.\nIran, the highest ranked team from Asia at the time, arrived to the World Cup in Qatar with political turmoil at home and were hammered 6–2 by England in the first match in the group stage, but two injury-time goals to defeat Wales 2–0 gave Iran first-ever World Cup win against a European opposition, and meant that their fate was still in their own hands by the time of their third match against the USA. However, the USA scored a first-half goal to take second place in the group and send Iran home.\nSaudi Arabia.\nSaudi Arabia came from behind to score a shock 2–1 win against Argentina with two goals from Saleh Al-Shehri and Salem Al-Dawsari, one of the tournament's perennial favourites, to give Asia's first ever win in the 2022 World Cup, which was described as one of the greatest football upsets in World Cup history. However, a sobering 2–0 defeat to Poland in the next match despite Saudi domination, which included a missed penalty from Salem Al-Dawsari, saw them needing to defeat a desperate Mexico in the third match to qualify. Instead, Mexico butchered the Saudis and put those hopes to bed in the second half by taking a 2–0 lead, two narrow offside decisions preventing a third goal; a Saudi goal in injury-time by Salem Al-Dawsari to pull the score back to 2–1 served only as consolation (and to ensure that Poland's qualification ahead of Mexico was on goal-difference rather than fair-play, little separating the two sides), the Saudis ultimately finishing at the bottom of the group, putting an end to West Asian involvement in the World Cup. Because of defeat to Mexico as well, Saudi Arabia suffered a 32 years knockout stage drought, standing second as a record for the longest knockout stage drought among Asian teams, after North Korea.\nAustralia.\nAustralia opened the scoring against France, but slumped to a 4–1 defeat after the French rallied under Mbappe. However, a shock 1–0 victory against group dark horse Tunisia in the second match with a header from Mitch Duke gave them a chance to qualify by winning or possibly even drawing the third match against Denmark. A goal for Leckie halfway through the second half gave Australia the victory, and Australia finished the group in second place (on goal difference behind France, following Tunisia's surprise victory over the French which would have seen them progress at Australia's expense if Denmark had managed to equalize) and qualified for the second round for the second time in their history and for the first time as an AFC member, where they would face Argentina. The victory over Denmark marked the first time Australia had kept two clean sheets in succession at the World Cup, or kept a clean sheet against any European side, and the first time they had won two matches in a single World Cup. Against Argentina, though, their luck ran out: goals from Messi in the first half, and Alvarez in the second, gave Argentina a 2–0 lead. Australia pulled a goal back, thanks to an own goal by Fernandez from a deflected shot by Goodwin, and came perilously close to an injury-time equalizer, but Kuol's shot was saved by Martinez, Argentina winning 2–1 in the end, putting an end to Australia's most successful World Cup run.\nJapan.\nJapan, 1–0 down at half-time, came back to beat Germany 2–1 to give Asia's second World Cup win and the biggest shock after Saudi Arabia's win over Argentina. They dominated possession and territory against Costa Rica in their second match, but it was Costa Rica scored a late goal and went away with a 1–0 win, leaving Japan needing at least a point against Spain. At half-time, again 1–0 down and with Spain having the majority of possession and territory, it appeared that Japan were down and out, especially with Germany seemingly dominant against Costa Rica despite having only one goal to show for it. However Japan turned it around in the second half, and scored two goals – the second including a potentially controversial VAR decision over whether the ball had previously gone out of play: most video angles showed the ball grounded on the wrong side of the line, but one crucial camera angle showed part of its curvature overhanging the edge of the line and thus still in play. Spain were unable to equalize, and Japan thus overtook them to top the group – ahead of Spain, who finished in second place ahead of Germany on goal difference, in what would be the greatest achievement in Japanese football history for beating two former world champions in a difficult group. Japan would go on to face Croatia in the second round: Maeda gave them the lead just before half-time, but Perisic equalized for Croatia shortly afterwards. Both teams tired in the second half, and a scrappy extra-time period produced few chances as the game went to a penalty shoot-out. Croatia's keeper Livakovic was the hero, saving three of Japan's penalties, Croatia winning the shoot-out 3–1 after four penalties for each side.\nSouth Korea.\nSouth Korea drew their first match 0–0 against Uruguay. In the second, against Ghana, they were 2–0 down at half-time: they pulled both goals back, only to concede a third shortly later, and were unable to force an equalizer, losing 3–2, leaving them needing to beat already-qualified Portugal in their third match and hope the other result was favourable. Although this seemed a difficult task, South Korea came back from a goal down to beat Portugal 2–1, and since Uruguay only beat Ghana 2–0 (the same margin by which they had lost to Portugal), South Korea were level with them on goal difference and ahead on goals scored, and went forward to join Japan and Australia in the last sixteen to meet Brazil, the first time three teams from Asia had qualified for the knockout stage. The Koreans, however, were totally outclassed by Brazil, 4-0 down after barely half an hour, and it could have been even more before half-time but several clear chances were wasted. In the second half Brazil noticeably eased up, and scored no more, in fact the Koreans pulled a late goal back, but 4-1 marked the end of Korea's and Asia's participation in 2022.\nNotable players.\nIn 2020, the AFC selected five World Cup heroes and invited three experts Philippe Troussier, Afshin Ghotbi and Steve Darby to decide the best player among them, as well as taking a poll of fans, which would be responsible for 25 percent of overall points. It also announced two versions of all-time XI at the World Cup on the basis of fans' vote and Opta's statistics."

Davis Jr. (September 7, 1938 – May 30, 2021) was an American professional basketball player who played two seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and was a starter on two NCAA Final Four teams at the University of Cincinnati.\nEarly life.\nDavis was born in Vanceburg, Kentucky, the son of Ralph E. Davis Sr., a self-employed businessman, and Anna Louis (Plummer) Davis. He played basketball at Lewis County High School in Vanceburg. He scored 1,810 points for the Lions and averaged 26.4 points and 18 rebounds per game as a senior. He was an all-district selection for three years. As a senior in 1956 he was named second team all-state by Louisville \"Courier-Journal\" as he led the Lions to the Eastern Kentucky Conference title. He was also an honor student.\nCollege career.\nDavis attended the University of Cincinnati, where he was a three-year starter for the Bearcats and coach George Smith.\nAs a sophomore in 1957–58, he averaged 7.9 points per game as the Bearcats posted a 25–1 record and won the Missouri Valley Conference (MVC) title led by fellow sophomore and future Hall-of-Famer forward Oscar Robertson and future longtime NBA player Connie Dierking.\nAs a junior in 1958–59, Davis started at point guard alongside Carl Bouldin and averaged 15.5 points (second to Robertson), 4.4 assists and 2.0 rebounds as the Bearcats were again MVC champions and Davis was named All-MVC. The 26–4 Bearcats advanced to the NCAA Final Four, where they finished in third place.\nAs a senior in 1959–60, Davis posted averages of 13.7 points (again second to Robertson), 4.4 assists and 2.0 rebounds per game while shooting 50 percent from the field as again the Bearcats won the league crown. Davis was named All-MVC and was also named second-team All-American by Converse. The Bearcats went 28–2, again advancing to the Final Four and again finishing third.\nDavis' 1,093 career points ranked sixth in Cincinnati history upon his graduation in 1960.\nNBA career.\nDavis was drafted in the third round (17th overall) of the 1960 NBA draft by the Cincinnati Royals.\nAs a rookie in 1960–61, he played in 73 games, averaged 16.6 minutes, 2.4 assists and 1.2 rebounds per game as a reserve guard for the 33–46 Royals.\nOn April 26, 1961, he was drafted by the Chicago Packers in the NBA expansion draft. For the 1961–62 season, in 77 games Davis' playing time increased to nearly 26 minutes per game as he posted career-high averages of 10.4 points, 3.2 assists and 2.1 rebounds per game for the 18–62 expansion team. In November 1961, the Packers had traded Davis to the St. Louis Hawks in a multi-player deal, but the trade was rescinded by NBA Commissioner Maurice Podoloff.\nIn 1962 he was officially traded to the St. Louis Hawks, but he did not play and his NBA career ended after two seasons.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1981, Davis was inducted into the University of Cincinnati Athletics Hall of Fame. In 1998, he was inducted into the Greater Cincinnati Basketball Hall of Fame. In December 2010, Lewis County High School held a ceremony to retire Davis' number.\nDavis was inducted into the inaugural class of the Lewis County high schools Hall of Fame in 2021.\nDavis died on May 30, 2021, at age 82.\nCareer statistics.\nNBA.\nSource"

Lee's inaugural baseball team in 1968, returning to play for both teams as a senior. His baseball play earned SIUE Baseball Player of the Year honors in 1969 and resulted in his being the first SIUE student-athlete to be drafted to play professional baseball.\nCollins was a 12th round pick of the St. Louis Cardinals in the June, 1969 Major League Baseball draft as a first baseman and outfielder. After two seasons with six clubs in the Cardinal organization, Collins returned to SIUE, becoming an assistant coach for Roy Lee.\nCollins spent two seasons as Lee's assistant, then moved to Lewis and Clark Community College as assistant to coach Arnold Copeland. In 1979, Collins returned to SIUE, replacing the retiring Roy Lee as the Cougars head coach. Over the following 34 seasons, Collins' Cougars built a record of 1,028–766–7. In Collins' first thirty years as the Cougar coach, the school continued as the strong Division II program built by Coach Lee, earning fourteen trips to the NCAA Division II Baseball Championship tournament and advancing to the Division II College World Series five times. In 2009, the Cougars began the transition to NCAA Division I, joining the Ohio Valley Conference (OVC). In the team's first year of eligibility, the Cougars qualified for the 2012 OVC Tournament. Having seen the team through its transition to Division I, in July 2012, Collins stepped down as the Cougar's head coach, assuming new duties as SIUE's first Director of Development for Intercollegiate Athletics. He retired from the university in February 2014.\nCollins earned his bachelor's degree in Physical Education in 1970 and added a master's degree in counselor education in 1973, both from SIUE.\nCollins is one of seven individuals who will be inducted into the American Baseball Coaches Association (ABCA) Hall of Fame in January 2019."

        "text": "Robert Alford (born October 31, 1988) is a former American football cornerback. He played college football at Southeastern Louisiana and was drafted by the Atlanta Falcons in the second round of the 2013 NFL draft.\nEarly years.\nAlford was born in Hammond, Louisiana. He attended Hammond High Magnet School and played high school football and ran track for the Hammond Tornadoes. He was a first-team all-District 7-5A selection at wide receiver, catching 10 touchdown passes as a senior for the Tors. He was chosen as the Tors' Rookie of the Year as a sophomore.\nIn addition to football, Alford was on the Tornadoes' track &amp; field team, where he competed as a sprinter and jumper. He finished second in the 400-meter dash at the 2007 LHSAA Track and Field Championships, with a time of 49.62 seconds. At the 2008 Region II-5A Championships, he won both the 400 meters, recording a career-best time of 48.68 seconds, and the long jump, setting a personal-best mark of 7.09 meters.\nCollege career.\nAlford enrolled in Southeastern Louisiana University, where he played for the Southeastern Louisiana Lions football team from 2008 to 2012. After redshirting in 2008, he started nine of the 10 games in 2009, appearing in at cornerback and finished the season with 46 tackles (35 solo), and was also second on the team with five pass breakups. He was granted a medical redshirt after missing the 2010 season with an injury. He returned in 2011 and was named second team All-Southland Conference after establishing himself as one of the conference's elite cornerbacks. He started all 11 games for the Lions, and finished second in the Southland with five interceptions and fourth in the league with seven pass breakups. He finished the year with 52 tackles (45 solo), and his five interceptions was the eighth-highest single-season total in school history. In his final season, he was named first team All-Southland conference after finishing the year with 39 tackles (35 solo), including five for loss, four interceptions and eight pass break ups.\nProfessional career.\nOn November 21, 2012, it was announced that Alford had accepted his invitation to play in the 2013 Senior Bowl. He became the second player from Southeastern Louisiana to play in the Senior Bowl and the first since Ronnie Hornsby in 1979. On January 26, 2013, Alford recorded five combined tackles and an interception to help Detroit Lions' head coach Jim Schwartz's South team that defeated the North 21–16. Alford had an impressive performance that also included an 88-yard kickoff return to start the game and immensely raised his draft stock. He was one of 60 collegiate defensive backs and 35 cornerbacks to attend the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis, Indiana. Alford performed all of the combine drills and finished fourth among all defensive backs in the 40-yard dash. On March 26, 2013, Alford attended Southeastern Louisiana's pro day, but opted to stand on his combine numbers and only performed positional drills as team representatives and scouts from 15 NFL teams attended. At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, Alford was projected to be a second or third round pick by NFL draft experts and scouts. He was ranked the 10th best cornerback prospect by NFL analyst Mike Mayock and the 11th best cornerback by NFLDraftScout.com.\nAtlanta Falcons.\nThe Atlanta Falcons selected Alford in the second round (60th overall) of the 2013 NFL draft. The Atlanta Falcons also drafted Washington's Desmond Trufant in the first round (22nd overall). He was the first player drafted from Southeastern Louisiana since Brett Wright in 1984. Alford also became the second highest selection in Southeastern Louisiana's school history, behind only Calvin Favron who was selected in the second round (46th overall) of the 1979 NFL draft.\n2013.\nOn June 14, 2013, the Atlanta Falcons signed Alford to a four-year, $3.40 million contract that includes $1.07 million guaranteed and a signing bonus of $853,744.\nThroughout training camp, he competed for a starting cornerback job against Asante Samuel, Desmond Trufant, and Robert McClain. Head coach Mike Smith named him the third cornerback on the Falcons' depth chart, behind Samuel and Trufant.\nHe made his professional regular season debut in the Atlanta Falcons' season-opener at the New Orleans Saints and recorded one tackle, two pass deflections, and intercepted the first pass of his career during their 23–17 loss. He made his first career interception off a pass attempt by quarterback Drew Brees that was intended for receiver Marques Colston at the end of the third quarter. On November 3, 2013, Alford recorded two combined tackles, deflected a pass, and intercepted a pass by Cam Newton in the Falcons' 34–10 loss at the Carolina Panthers. After posting a 3–10 season, head coach Mike Smith elected to start Alford at cornerback over Asante Samuel for their Week 14 matchup against the Green Bay Packers. He made his first career start and recorded five combined tackles and deflected a pass during their 22–21 loss. The following week, Alford collected a season-high nine combined tackles in Atlanta's 27–26 victory over the Washington Redskins. He played in all 16 games with four starts as a rookie finishing with 40 combined tackles (28 solo), nine pass deflections, two interceptions, and one forced fumble.\n2014.\nAlford entered the 2014 season slated as the starting cornerback alongside Desmond Trufant. On October 19, 2014, Alford recorded two solo tackles, defended two passes, and intercepted Baltimore Ravens' quarterback Joe Flacco twice during a 29–7 loss. During a Week 10 matchup at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, he collected a season-high nine combined tackles in a 27–17 victory. The following week, Alford made one tackle before leaving a 19–17 win against the Carolina Panthers with a broken wrist. On December 14, 2014, the Atlanta Falcons placed him on injured reserve after it he underwent surgery and it became apparent he wouldn't be able to return during the season. He finished the season with 36 combined tackles, three interceptions, and 11 pass deflections in ten games and ten starts.\n2015.\nThroughout his first training camp under new head coach Dan Quinn, Alford competed to maintain his role as starting cornerback against Akeem King, rookie Jalen Collins, and Phillip Adams. He was named the starting cornerback, opposite Desmond Trufant, to start the regular season.\nOn October 11, 2015, Alford recorded one tackle, two pass deflections, intercepted Washington Redskins' quarterback Kirk Cousins twice, and returned one for a touchdown during the Falcons' 25–19 victory. He intercepted Cousins' pass on the last play of the game and returned it for a 59-yard game-winning touchdown, marking the first touchdown and pick six of his career. Alford missed the Falcons' Week 9 matchup against the San Francisco 49ers after suffering a groin injury. In Week 17, he collected a season-high eight solo tackles in the Falcons' 20–17 loss to the New Orleans Saints. He completed the season with a total of 53 combined tackles (45 solo), 15 passes defensed and two interceptions, and a touchdown in 15 games and 15 starts.\n2016.\nHead coach Dan Quinn named Alford and Desmond Trufant the Falcons' starting cornerback duo to start the regular season. He started the Atlanta Falcons' season-opener against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and made five combined tackles and deflected two passes during their 31–24 loss. In Week 3, he collected a season-high eight combined tackles and deflected a pass in Atlanta's 45–32 win against the New Orleans Saints. On October 2, 2016, Alford recorded three solo tackles, defended three passes, intercepted two passes, and returned one for a touchdown in the Falcons' 48–33 victory over the Carolina Panthers. He returned his second interception off Cam Newton for a 30-yard touchdown, marking the second pick-six of his career. Alford finished the season with 61 combined tackles (50 solo), 19 pass deflections, two interceptions, and a touchdown in 16 games and 16 starts.\nOn December 8, 2016, the Atlanta Falcons signed Alford to a four-year, $38 million contract extension that includes $12 million guaranteed and a signing bonus of $3 million.\nThe Atlanta Falcons finished first atop the NFC South with an 11–5 record and received a playoff berth. On January 14, 2017, Alford started his first career playoff game and recorded five solo tackles in the Falcons' 36–20 victory over the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC Divisional Round. The Atlanta Falcons went on to defeat the Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship 44–21 and went on to Super Bowl LI.\nOn February 5, 2017, Alford recorded 11 combined tackles, an interception, fumble recovery, and touchdown as the Falcons lost to the New England Patriots 34–28 in overtime. His touchdown came off an 82-yard return after intercepting quarterback Tom Brady in the second quarter. Alford was involved in a notable play with Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman, who completed a very difficult catch off of Alford's shoe. Alford deflected Brady's throw into the air behind him, and Keanu Neal and Ricardo Allen merged on the ball to try an intercept it or knock it down. The ball bounced off Alford's left leg and almost into the turf, but Edelman caught it a mere centimeters off the ground. This play set up the Patriots on the Falcons side of the field and allowed them to continue the eventual game-tying drive.\n2017.\nAlford was named the starting cornerback, along with Desmond Trufant, for the fourth consecutive season. On November 20, 2017, Alford recorded a career-high ten combined tackles and deflected three passes in a 34–31 victory at the Seattle Seahawks.

He was the 2012–13 Great West Conference Player of the Year as a senior after leading the NJIT Highlanders to the school's first ever Great West Conference regular season championship. He is NJIT's all-time leading scorer in the Division I era after finishing his career with 1,726 points.\nFamily.\nJulian Flores (8).\nMarco Banegas-Flores\nHigh school.\nFlores spent his traditional four-year high school career at John D. O'Bryant School of Mathematics &amp; Science in Roxbury, Massachusetts. In 2008–09, he spent one additional year at Marianapolis Preparatory School in Thompson, Connecticut. Flores averaged 17 points per game during that postgraduate year while shooting greater than 40 percent from three-point range. In the 2009 New England Class B Prep championship he scored 35 points. The \"New England Recruiting Report\" tabbed him as the 18th-best prospect from the state of Connecticut.\nCollege.\nFlores suited up for the NJIT Highlanders from 2009–10 through 2012–13. In all four seasons he averaged between 12.6 and 16.9 points per game. From his freshman through his junior years, Flores was named to the All-Great West Conference Second Team, and in his freshman season he was also named to the All-GWC Newcomer Team as well as its Freshman of the Year. Heading into his senior season, the Great West Conference media selected Flores as the preseason player of the year. The media's prediction came true after Flores was named its player of the year by leading the Highlanders to their first ever conference regular season championship.\nProfessional.\nFlores went unselected in the 2013 NBA draft. The Brooklyn Nets were the only NBA team to give him a pre-draft workout, and when no other teams showed interest he began his professional career overseas. In August 2013 he signed with Uni-Riesen Leipzig, a team in Germany's Bundesliga Pro-B. He played there for two seasons before returning to the United States to pursue a business career."

        "text": "Tony Miller (born April 16, 1973) is an American former basketball coach and player. Miller was a two-time Dutch League All-Star in 1998 and 2000. During his collegiate career at Marquette University, Miller recorded 956 assists, which as of the end of the 2020–21 season still remains the eighth-highest total in NCAA Division I history.\nEarly life.\nMiller was born in Cleveland, Ohio. He attended Villa Angela-St. Joseph High School (VASJ) where he was a two-sport star between basketball and football. Miller was the starting point guard for all four seasons in basketball and led them to a state championship as a senior in 1991–92. In football, he became the starting quarterback in his sophomore season, succeeding future National Football League quarterback Elvis Grbac. Miller led the football squad to a state championship as a junior, a feat Grbac did not even accomplish. He wasn't heavily recruited from college basketball teams because it was thought he would play football at the next level instead, but then-Marquette head coach Kevin O'Neill was persistent in his recruitment, and eventually Miller signed to play for the Warriors.\nCollege.\nIn his four-year career spanning from 1991 and 1995, Miller started all 123 games in which he played. For his career he averaged 8.3 points and 7.8 assists while finishing with 1,027 and 956, respectively. His assists total ranks eighth all-time in Division I history, and was fifth all-time when he graduated. In his sophomore and junior seasons, Miller was the catalyst for Marquette's back-to-back NCAA Tournament berths; in the 1994 tournament, he was the primary reason why Marquette was able to break Kentucky's full-court press as the Warriors upset the Wildcats to advance to the Sweet 16. As a senior, Marquette were the runners-up in the 1995 National Invitation Tournament. Miller was a three-time Great Midwest Conference Second Team selection from 1993 to 1995.\nProfessional career.\nMiller played professional basketball from 1995–96 through 2007–08. In 13 seasons he played for different teams in the United States, Belgium, Lithuania, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. In 1997–98 and 2000–2001 he was a Dutch League All-Star. Miller finished his professional career playing in the British Basketball League for the Everton Tigers.\nCoaching career.\nMiller's first job came in 2009–10 as the strength and conditioning manager for USC. He was hired by his former head coach at Marquette, Kevin O'Neill, who was then the USC head coach. In 2010–11, Miller was promoted to a full-time assistant coach position. He was not retained when Andy Enfield took over as head coach in 2013–14. Miller spent the 2013–14 season as an assistant coach at St. John Bosco High School in Bellflower, California, where he helped the team win a Division 2 state championship. He then moved on to become an assist for Cal State Los Angeles for two seasons before retiring from coaching."

The first match was played on 12 June 2014, with the last two played concurrently on 23 June. The top two teams, Brazil and Mexico, advanced to the round of 16.\nStandings.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nMatches.\nBrazil vs Croatia.\nThe two teams had met in two previous matches, including in the 2006 FIFA World Cup group stage, won by Brazil 1–0. Croatia forward Mario Mandžukić was suspended for the match, after being sent off in the team's final qualifier against Iceland.\nCroatia opened the scoring in the 11th minute through a Marcelo own goal, as the ball bounced off him into the net after Nikica Jelavić deflected Ivica Olić's cross. Neymar equalized for the hosts with a shot after receiving a pass from Oscar. In the second half, Brazil took the lead with Neymar's penalty after Dejan Lovren was controversially judged to have fouled Fred in the penalty area. Croatia had a potential equalizer disallowed, after a foul was again controversially called on the Brazilian goalkeeper, Júlio César. In added time, Oscar sealed the win, toe-poking the third goal for Brazil from after receiving a pass from Ramires.\nPost-match, FIFA referees chief Massimo Busacca defended the officials for awarding the penalty and insisted there had been some contact between Lovren and Fred, even if it was minimal. However, former top-level FIFA referee Markus Merk criticized FIFA for having Yuichi Nishimura as the referee in the opening match, labelling the refereeing in the match as \"embarrassing\".\nThe game was notable for a number of pioneering events. This was the first occasion in FIFA World Cup history on which an own goal (which was also the first ever own goal scored by Brazil in World Cup finals) opened scoring in the tournament. As the first game played at this World Cup, the match also saw the first use of vanishing spray to mark free kick spots, and the advent of goal-line technology, two innovations introduced during the tournament.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nMexico vs Cameroon.\nThe two teams had met in one previous match, in a friendly in 1993, won by Mexico 1–0.\nMexico's Giovani dos Santos had two goals disallowed for offside in the first half.\nHowever, replays showed that he was in line with the last defender for the first case, while the ball came from a Cameroon player for the second. In the second half, dos Santos had a shot saved by the Cameroon goalkeeper, Charles Itandje, but the ball rebounded into the path of Oribe Peralta, who slotted the ball into the empty net with his left foot.\nMexico captain Rafael Márquez made history by becoming the first player to captain his nation in four different World Cups. Samuel Eto'o also appeared in his fourth World Cup, joining fellow Cameroonians Jacques Songo'o and Rigobert Song as the only African players to have achieved the feat.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nBrazil vs Mexico.\nThe two teams had met in 38 previous matches, including three times in the FIFA World Cup group stage, all won by Brazil (1950: 4–0; 1954: 5–0; 1962: 2–0). Their most recent meeting was in the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup group stage, won by Brazil 2–0.\nMexican goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa made four outstanding saves to deny Brazil. In the first half, he saved a header from Neymar tight to his right to push the ball around the post, and blocked a close-range effort from Paulinho. In the second half, he saved a low shot from Neymar and a late point-blank header from Thiago Silva.\nThis was the first time since the 1970 FIFA World Cup that the host team drew 0–0 in the group stage (in the case, the own Mexico, in the opening match of the respective tournament, an 0-0 draw with Soviet Union). Mexico became the first team from outside UEFA or CONMEBOL to take a point from Brazil in the World Cup.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nCameroon vs Croatia.\nThe two teams had never met before.\nIn a match where both teams needed at least a point to stay alive in the competition, Croatia opened scoring when Ivica Olić scored from close range from Ivan Perišić's pass. Just before half time, Cameroon was reduced to 10 men when Alex Song was dismissed for an off the ball incident with Mario Mandžukić. Perišić scored at the beginning of the second half when he intercepted Cameroonian goalkeeper Charles Itandje's goal kick and ran 50 yards before slotting in at the near post. Mandžukić scored the last two goals, the first a header from Danijel Pranjić's corner and the second a tap in after Itandje parried Eduardo's shot into his path. The result confirmed Cameroon's elimination from the tournament.\nIn a case of infighting, Cameroonian defender Benoît Assou-Ekotto was caught on camera head-butting teammate Benjamin Moukandjo. Song later apologised to Mandžukić and his country for his ejection, while Cameroonian coach Volker Finke said he was very disappointed with their performance.\nOn 1 July 2014, Cameroon officials announced that they had opened an investigation on claims that seven of the Cameroon's players were involved in fixing the result. However, FIFA said there was no evidence that there were any match fixing in any of Cameroon's matches.\nOlić, who previously scored a goal in the 2002 World Cup, became the second player to have a 12-year gap between World Cup goals, after Michael Laudrup in 1986 and 1998. Mandžukić became the first Croatian player to score a brace in a World Cup game. The 4–0 scoreline was also the biggest win by Croatia in the World Cup.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nCameroon vs Brazil.\nThe two teams had met in four previous matches, including in the 1994 FIFA World Cup group stage, won by Brazil 3–0. Their most recent meeting was in the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup group stage, won by Cameroon 1–0. Cameroon midfielder Alex Song was suspended for the match (first match of a three-match ban), after being sent off in the previous match against Croatia.\nBrazil, where a draw would guarantee their qualification to the knockout stage, opened the scoring in the 17th minute when Luiz Gustavo crossed from the left for Neymar to beat the goalkeeper with a first time low side-footed finish to the corner. Already-eliminated Cameroon equalised when Allan Nyom beat Dani Alves on the left before crossing for Joël Matip to finish from close range. Neymar put Brazil back in front when he collected the ball from Marcelo and ran at goal before finishing with a low right foot shot that wrong footed the goalkeeper from just inside the penalty area. In the second half David Luiz crossed from the left for Fred to extend Brazil's lead with a close range header before half-time substitute Fernandinho completed the scoring when he collected a pass from Oscar before finishing with a low right footed shot. The result assured that Brazil pipped Mexico on goal difference to qualify to the knockout stage as group winners.\nThe match was Brazil's 100th in the World Cup, and they followed Germany (which played their 100th match in their first game of the 2014 World Cup) to become the second team to reach the milestone.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nCroatia vs Mexico.\nThe two teams had met in three previous matches, including in the 2002 FIFA World Cup group stage, won by Mexico 1–0.\nComing into the final round of matches, Croatia needed to win to guarantee qualification to the knockout stage regardless of the result of Cameroon vs Brazil, while Mexico only needed a draw to do so. The game was goalless for the first 70 minutes, until a Héctor Herrera corner to the back post allowed Rafael Márquez to score from a header, outleaping the Croatian defenders. With Croatia progressing only by way of a win, they were caught out on a break a short time later where Andrés Guardado scored after receiving a pass from Oribe Peralta. Mexico scored their third goal when Márquez flicked on Guardado's corner with substitute Javier Hernández scoring at the back post. Ivan Perišić scored in his second consecutive World Cup match after a neat back pass from Ivan Rakitić to get a consolation goal for Croatia in the closing minutes of the game, before Croatia's Ante Rebić was sent off for a foul on Carlos Peña. Mexico qualified as group runners-up (behind Brazil on goal difference) on virtue of the win, while Croatia were eliminated.\nWith his goal, Márquez joined Cuauhtémoc Blanco as the only Mexican player to score in three World Cups.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

        "text": "Group B of the 2014 FIFA World Cup consisted of Spain, the Netherlands, Chile, and Australia. This group contained the finalists of the previous World Cup in 2010: Spain (reigning champion) and the Netherlands (runners-up). Play began on 13 June and ended on 23 June 2014. The Netherlands and Chile progressed to the knockout stage, while Australia and Spain were eliminated after suffering two defeats in their opening two matches. Chile was eliminated by Brazil in the second round after penalties, while the Netherlands made their way to the semi-finals in which they lost to Argentina on penalties. The third place match was won by the Netherlands with a convincing 3–0 victory against Brazil.\nStandings.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nMatches.\nSpain vs Netherlands.\nThe two teams had met in 9 previous matches, including in the 2010 FIFA World Cup Final, won by Spain 1–0 after extra time. This was the first time in the FIFA World Cup that the previous finalists met in the group stage.\nHalfway into the first half, the referee judged that Diego Costa caught a trailing leg from Stefan de Vrij's attempted tackle. Xabi Alonso scored the penalty kick for Spain, shooting into the bottom-right corner with his right foot, putting them into the lead. They were unable to keep the lead until half time though, with Robin van Persie scoring a 15-yard diving looping header after a long ball from Daley Blind from the left after he spotted Iker Casillas slightly off his line. In the second half, Blind assisted another goal for Netherlands, this time setting up Arjen Robben who controlled the pass before coming inside to finish with his left foot from ten yards out. Twelve minutes later, Netherlands scored again, as De Vrij headed the ball in from a tight angle from a Wesley Sneijder free kick on the left. Spanish goalkeeper Iker Casillas protested that he had been fouled by Van Persie, but the goal was allowed to stand and Casillas received a yellow card for his protest. Not long after this, a backpass from Sergio Ramos was miscontrolled by Casillas with his left leg, resulting in Van Persie gathering the ball and scoring into an empty net for his second goal of the game. The fifth goal for Netherlands was a solo effort from Robben. Having received the ball near the halfway line from a Wesley Sneijder pass, he outran Ramos, Jordi Alba and Casillas, before slotting the ball into the net from 10 yards out with his left foot.\nThe 5–1 scoreline was the biggest loss margin for a defending champion in the FIFA World Cup, and also Spain's second biggest loss in the World Cup after their 6–1 thrashing against Brazil in 1950. With their goals, Van Persie and Robben became the first Dutch players to score in three World Cups. Casillas and Xavi joined Andoni Zubizarreta as the only Spanish players to appear in four World Cups.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nChile vs Australia.\nThe two teams had met in five previous matches, including in the 1974 FIFA World Cup group stage, a 0–0 draw.\nChile took a 2–0 lead within the first 15 minutes. First, Alexis Sánchez controlled an Eduardo Vargas header in the penalty area to slot home. Two minutes later, Jorge Valdivia's shot from a Sánchez pass doubled the lead. Australia pulled one back through a Tim Cahill header from a cross by Ivan Franjic before half time. Australia could not find the equaliser in the second half, and in stoppage time, Chilean substitute Jean Beausejour converted the rebound after Mauricio Pinilla's shot was saved by Mathew Ryan.\nWith their respective goals, Cahill became the first Australian player to score in three World Cups, while Beausejour became the first Chilean player to score in two World Cups.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nAustralia vs Netherlands.\nThe two teams had met in three previous matches, all in friendlies, most recently in 2009.\nThe Netherlands took the lead after Arjen Robben collected a Daley Blind headed pass at the halfway line, burst into the penalty area and scored with a low shot to the goalkeepers left. Soon after the restart, Australia equalised through Tim Cahill's left-foot volley into the goal from the underside of the bar from Ryan McGowan's cross. Australia took the lead in the second half with Mile Jedinak's penalty, awarded for a handball by Daryl Janmaat, but Robin van Persie equalised after he received substitute Memphis Depay's pass and scored. Ten minutes later, Memphis Depay received a pass from Jonathan de Guzmán and his long-range effort beat Australia goalkeeper Mathew Ryan.\nAt the age of 20, Depay's goal made him the Netherlands' youngest scorer at World Cups.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nSpain vs Chile.\nThe two teams had met in ten previous matches, including twice in the FIFA World Cup group stage, both won by Spain (1950: 2–0; 2010: 2–1).\nChile opened the scoring when Charles Aránguiz squared a pass to Eduardo Vargas to score home in the penalty area. Near the end of the first half Alexis Sánchez's free kick was parried by Spanish goalkeeper Iker Casillas to Aránguiz who put in the rebound. Spain, which needed at least a point to stay alive in the competition, had its best chance in the second half which fell to Sergio Busquets, but he missed from close range. Spain's loss confirmed the qualification of both Chile and the Netherlands into the knockout stage, and eliminated both Spain and Australia.\nSpain became the fifth defending champions to be knocked out in the group stage.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nAustralia vs Spain.\nThe two teams had never met before. Australia forward Tim Cahill was suspended for the match due to accumulation of yellow cards.\nIn a match between two already-eliminated teams, Spain went in front in the 36th minute after Andrés Iniesta threaded a pass down the right to overlapping full-back Juanfran, who then crossed the ball low to David Villa to finish with a back flick of his right foot low to the net. In the second half, Fernando Torres scored Spain's second with a low finish from the left of the penalty area after a pass from Iniesta, before substitute Juan Mata, receiving a pass from Cesc Fàbregas, scored from the right of the penalty area with a low shot between the goalkeeper's legs.\nVilla's goal was his ninth career World Cup goal. Already Spain's record World Cup goalscorer, he also joined Fernando Hierro, Raúl and Julio Salinas as Spanish players who had scored in three World Cups.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nNetherlands vs Chile.\nThe two teams had never met before. Netherlands forward Robin van Persie was suspended for the match due to accumulation of yellow cards.\nWith both teams already assured of qualifying for the knockout stage after their first two matches, this match would decide which team would win the group: the Netherlands needed only a draw while Chile needed a win. The Netherlands went in front in the 77th minute with a header from six yards by substitute Leroy Fer after a Daryl Janmaat cross from the right. Another substitute Memphis Depay got the second in injury time, when he scored from close range after Arjen Robben had made a run down the left before crossing from the byline. With this win the Netherlands won Group B with a perfect record of three wins out of three, while Chile finished as group runners-up.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

The top two teams, Colombia and Greece, advanced to the round of 16.\nStandings.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nMatches.\nColombia vs Greece.\nThe two teams had met in one previous match, in a friendly in 1994, where Colombia won 2–0. Colombia midfielder Fredy Guarín was suspended for the match, after being sent off in the team's final qualifier against Paraguay.\nColombia took the lead within five minutes, Juan Cuadrado's cutback was converted by Pablo Armero via a deflection off Greek defender Kostas Manolas. Colombia extended the lead in the second half, when Abel Aguilar flicked on a corner kick from James Rodríguez and Teófilo Gutiérrez scored from close range.\nGreece's best chance fell to Theofanis Gekas, who headed against the bar. In stoppage time, Cuadrado set up James to complete the scoring with a low shot.\nThe 3–0 scoreline was Colombia's biggest win to date in the World Cup.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nIvory Coast vs Japan.\nThe two teams had met in three previous matches, all in friendlies, most recently in 2010.\nJapan took the lead in the first half, when Keisuke Honda collected a pass from Yuto Nagatomo after a quick throw-in to strike home with his left foot high into the net.\nHowever, Ivory Coast came back with two goals in two minutes in the second half, first Wilfried Bony headed in from Serge Aurier's cross from the right from six yards, followed by a Gervinho header from six yards from another cross from Aurier on the right.\nWith his goal, Honda became the first Japanese player to score in two World Cups, and also claimed sole possession of being the top Japanese scorer in World Cup history with three total goals.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nColombia vs Ivory Coast.\nThe two teams had never met before.\nAfter a goalless first half, Colombia scored first when James Rodríguez headed in Juan Cuadrado's corner.\nThe lead was extended six minutes later when Ivory Coast was caught in possession, and Teófilo Gutiérrez released substitute Juan Quintero to score. Ivory Coast reduced the deficit through Gervinho, who received a pass from Arthur Boka in the left wing, dribbled past three Colombian players and shot home.\nThe second goal of the tournament by James allowed him to join Bernardo Redín and Adolfo Valencia as the only Colombian players to score more than one goal in the World Cup.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nJapan vs Greece.\nThe two teams had met in one previous match, in the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup group stage, won by Japan 1–0.\nGreece was reduced to ten men in the first half when Kostas Katsouranis was booked twice in eleven minutes. In the second half, Greece had a Theofanis Gekas header saved, while Japan, which needed at least a point to stay alive in the competition, had chances to score through Yoshito Ōkubo and Atsuto Uchida, but the game finished goalless. The result ensured Colombia's qualification to the knockout stage, their first since 1990.\nThis was the first clean sheet kept by Greece in World Cup history.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nJapan vs Colombia.\nThe two teams had met in two previous matches, most recently in a friendly in 2007, and also in the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup group stage, won by Colombia 1–0.\nColombia took the lead mid-way through the first half, with Juan Cuadrado taking a penalty kick, shooting low down the middle after Japan centre back Yasuyuki Konno fouled Colombia striker Adrián Ramos in the box.\nJapan then equalised through Shinji Okazaki's headed goal from a cross from Keisuke Honda on the right in first half stoppage time. Colombia's James Rodríguez was introduced after the half time break, and was credited for providing two assists for two goals scored by Jackson Martínez, on 55 minutes when he shot low to the net with his left foot, and 82 minutes when he curled the ball in from the right of the penalty area with his left foot, before finishing off the scoring with a strike of his own, assisted by Ramos, where he beat the last man before clipping the ball over the goalkeeper. Colombia, which had already qualified for the knockout stage and would do so as group winners if either they didn't lose this match or Ivory Coast did not beat Greece in the other match, finished as group winners with a perfect record of three wins out of three, while Japan, which had to win the match to have any chance to qualify, were eliminated.\nFaryd Mondragón became the oldest player to make an appearance in the history of the World Cup, at the age of , when he came on for the last five minutes of the match, breaking the record of Roger Milla, who played at the 1994 World Cup at the age of 42. He also set the record for the longest time between World Cup appearances as 15 years and 363 days had passed since his last versus England at the 1998 World Cup, breaking Alfred Bickel's record of 12 years and 13 days between appearances (1938–1950).\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGreece vs Ivory Coast.\nThe two teams had never met before. Greece midfielder Kostas Katsouranis (red card in previous match) and Ivory Coast defender Didier Zokora (accumulation of yellow cards) were suspended for the match.\nGreece, which had to win to have any chance to qualify for the knockout stage, went in front in the 42nd minute after Cheick Tioté's defensive mistake allowed substitute Andreas Samaris to steal the ball, play a one-two with Georgios Samaras, and run in on goal before shooting past the goalkeeper with his right foot. In the second half, substitute Wilfried Bony equalised with a low right foot finish after Gervinho's pass from the left. As Japan were losing to Colombia in the other match played at the same time, Ivory Coast only required a point to qualify for the knockout stage for the first time. The game looked to be heading for a draw, until Greece won a penalty in injury time when Giovanni Sio tripped Samaras as he was about to strike the ball, and Samaras scored the penalty hitting the ball to the goalkeeper's left. The win meant Greece finished as the group runners-up, and put them into the knockout stage for the first time in its World Cup history (after unsuccessful campaigns in 1994 and 2010), while Ivory Coast were eliminated in the group stage for the third tournament in a row.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

        "text": "Group D of the 2014 FIFA World Cup consisted of Uruguay, Costa Rica, England and Italy. This was the only group to contain more than one previous winner of the World Cup. It was also the only group with three top 10 FIFA World Ranking teams as of October 2013 (ranking date for final draw) and at the start of the competition. Play began on 14 June and ended on 24 June 2014.\nCosta Rica topped the group undefeated, despite being considered underdogs and expected to finish last in a group containing three former winners of the competition. Two of them, England and Italy, were eliminated.\nStandings.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nMatches.\nUruguay vs Costa Rica.\nThe two teams had met in 10 previous matches, most recently in 2009 in the CONCACAF – CONMEBOL play-off, won by Uruguay 2–1 on aggregate to qualify for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\nUruguay led the game 1–0 at half time, through an Edinson Cavani penalty after Diego Lugano was pulled down in the box by Júnior Díaz. Keylor Navas prevented Uruguay's lead from doubling by tipping over Diego Forlán's shot. In the second half, Joel Campbell equalised with a low shot to the right corner when the ball fell to him in the box after a deep cross from Cristian Gamboa on the right. Soon afterwards, Costa Rica went into the lead when Óscar Duarte scored with a low diving header to the right corner after a free kick from Christian Bolaños.\nA pass from Campbell allowed substitute Marco Ureña to make it 3–1 with a low shot from a tight angle on the right, and in injury time Maxi Pereira was given a straight red card for a kick at Campbell.\nIt was the first time Costa Rica scored three goals in a World Cup match, and also the first time that Uruguay lost to a non-South American or non-European country in the World Cup.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nEngland vs Italy.\nThe two teams had met in 24 previous matches, including in the 1990 FIFA World Cup third place match, won by Italy 2–1. Their most recent competitive meeting was in the UEFA Euro 2012 quarter-finals, won by Italy on penalties after a scoreless draw.\nItaly went ahead first, when from a short corner, Andrea Pirlo dummied Marco Verratti's pass, and Claudio Marchisio scored with a low right footed shot from outside the penalty box.\nEngland quickly equalised through a close-range Daniel Sturridge goal from a Wayne Rooney cross from the left. The scores were level at 1–1 at half time, but Mario Balotelli headed Italy's winner from close range five minutes after play resumed from a cross by Antonio Candreva on the right.\nThe England physiotherapist Gary Lewin was stretchered off with a dislocated ankle suffered in the celebrations for England's goal, which ruled him out for the rest of the World Cup.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nUruguay vs England.\nThe two teams had met in ten previous matches, including twice in the FIFA World Cup (1954, quarter-finals: Uruguay 4–2 England; 1966, group stage: Uruguay 0–0 England). Uruguay defender Maxi Pereira was suspended for the match, after being sent off in the team's match against Costa Rica.\nUruguay took the lead in the first half, the goal headed in by Luis Suárez from a cross by Edinson Cavani on the left.\nEngland equalised in the second half, when Wayne Rooney scored his first World Cup goal with a tap-in from a cross by Glen Johnson from the right. Suárez later secured Uruguay's victory, receiving the ball from goalkeeper Fernando Muslera's clearance which flicked off Steven Gerrard, and shot home his second goal of the match powerfully with his right foot.\nThis was the first time that England lost three World Cup matches in a row, dating back to England's loss to Germany in the 2010 World Cup round of 16.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nItaly vs Costa Rica.\nThe two teams had met in one previous match, in a friendly in 1994.\nMario Balotelli had Italy's best chance in the first half, lobbing the ball wide from inside the penalty area. Late in the first half, Joel Campbell had a clear penalty appeal denied, but Costa Rica nevertheless took the lead within a minute, as Júnior Díaz crossed from the left for Bryan Ruiz to head the ball onto the crossbar and over the line from close range.\nCosta Rica was able to hold on for the win in the second half, ensuring their qualification for the knockout stage, their first since 1990, while simultaneously ensuring England's group stage exit, their first since 1958.\nCosta Rica became the second country to beat two World Cup champions in the group stage of one tournament, the other being Denmark, who had done it twice in 1986 (Uruguay and West Germany) and 2002 (Uruguay and France). Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon appeared in his fourth World Cup (he was also in the squad for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, but did not appear in any match), the fifth Italian player to do so.\nCoincidentally, Costa Rica's qualification to the Round of 16 occurred exactly twenty-four years after their victory against Sweden at the 1990 FIFA World Cup, which also sealed their first-ever qualification to the Round of 16. Because of this, \"La Nación\"'s Rodrigo Calvo called 20 June \"a blessed date\" for the Costa Rican team.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nItaly vs Uruguay.\nThe two teams had met in eight previous matches, including twice in the FIFA World Cup (1970, group stage: Italy 0–0 Uruguay; 1990, round of 16: Italy 2–0 Uruguay). Their most recent meeting was in the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup third place match, won by Italy 3–2 on penalties (2–2 draw after extra time).\nAfter a goalless first half, Italy were reduced to 10 men in the second half when Claudio Marchisio was sent off for a studs-up challenge on Egidio Arévalo. \nAround the 79th minute, Uruguay forward Luis Suárez bit the left shoulder of Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini. Chiellini showed the bite marks to Mexican referee Marco Rodríguez, who missed the incident. As the Italian players protested to the referee for not penalising Suárez, Uruguay won a corner which Gastón Ramírez delivered from the right. Diego Godín rose to head the ball, with the only goal of the game going in off his back. In the 84th minute, a member of the Italian coaching staff was dismissed from the bench by the referee after an altercation with his Uruguayan counterparts. Uruguay's win qualified them for the knockout stage as the group runners-up, and eliminated Italy from the tournament; this marked the second consecutive time that Italy had been eliminated at the group stage.\nSuárez bite.\nAfter the biting incident, Suárez claimed that he \"had contact with [Chiellini's] shoulder, nothing more\" and that \"these things happen\".\nOn the same day of the match, FIFA opened disciplinary proceedings against Suárez regarding the biting incident. During the proceedings, FIFA confirmed that Suárez's previous two bans due to biting incidents (seven games for biting Otman Bakkal while playing for Ajax and 10 games for biting Branislav Ivanović while playing for Liverpool) would be taken into account. Two days after the match, the FIFA Disciplinary Committee banned Suárez for nine international matches, effective immediately, meaning he would take no further part in the World Cup. It was the longest such ban in World Cup history, exceeding the eight-match ban handed to Italy's Mauro Tassotti for breaking the nose of Spain's Luis Enrique at the 1994 FIFA World Cup. He was also banned from taking part in any football-related activity (including entering any stadium) for four months and fined CHF100,000 (approx. £65,700/€82,000/US$119,000). The verdict would not prevent Suárez from transferring to another club. Suárez later admitted that he had bitten Chiellini and formally apologised, while writing that the \"physical result of a bite\" occurred in a collision with Chiellini. On 3 July, the Uruguayan Football Association (AUF) appealed against the decision to FIFA, but it was rejected on 10 July. After an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, Suárez was later allowed to participate in training and friendly matches with new club Barcelona.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nCosta Rica vs England.\nThe two teams had never met before.\nAs England could no longer advance to the knockout stage, their manager Roy Hodgson made nine changes to the starting line-up with Frank Lampard captaining the side. The match finished goalless, and the draw was enough to confirm Costa Rica, which had already sealed their place in the knockout stage, as the group winners with seven points after three matches.\nThis was England's 11th goalless draw in World Cup history, more than any other team.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

The top two teams, France and Switzerland, advanced to the round of 16.\nStandings.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nMatches.\nSwitzerland vs Ecuador.\nThe two teams had never met before.\nEcuador took the lead in the first half when Walter Ayoví's free kick was headed in by Enner Valencia. Switzerland equalised early in the second half from another set-piece, Ricardo Rodríguez's corner kick headed in by half-time substitute Admir Mehmedi.\nThe winning goal of the match was scored by another substitute Haris Seferovic in the 93rd minute of the game with just 20 seconds remaining in injury time. A Swiss breakaway started in their own penalty area when Valon Behrami won the ball, and finished by Seferovic converting Rodríguez's cross.\nThis was Switzerland's first World Cup win over South American opposition in six attempts.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nFrance vs Honduras.\nThe two teams had never met before.\nThe match started without the national anthems being played before the kick-off, which FIFA later said was due to an audio system malfunction. France took the lead in the first half on a penalty kick converted by Karim Benzema, which was awarded on a foul by Wilson Palacios on Paul Pogba, for which Palacios received his second yellow card and was sent off.\nAn own goal by Honduras goalkeeper Noel Valladares early in the second half gave France a two-goal lead. Benzema's shot rebounded off the post and then hit Valladares, and despite his effort to scoop it clear, the ball was indicated by goal-line technology to have crossed the line and the goal was awarded. The goal was the first time that a goal was awarded in the World Cup with the support of goal-line technology. There was some confusion when the animated replay of the goal was shown in the stadium, however, as when the ball first hit the post, causing \"NO GOAL\" to correctly flash onto screens in the stadium, it then hit Valladares and crossed the line, producing \"GOAL\" on the screen. The initial flash of \"NO GOAL\" drew boos from fans, caused a commotion among the managers and players on the sideline, and led to confusion even from the BBC's experienced television commentator Jonathan Pearce, who required his colleague Martin Keown to explain the incident to him. In response to the confusion, FIFA promised to review how the replays are shown in the future for similar incidents. \nFrance completed the scoring when Benzema scored his second goal, as he blasted in the rebound after Mathieu Debuchy's shot was inadvertently blocked by Patrice Evra and fell to him in the penalty area.\nStretching back to their last match of the 1982 World Cup, this was the fifth consecutive World Cup match that Honduras failed to score a goal, matching the record held by Bolivia (1930–1994) and Algeria (1986–2010).\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nSwitzerland vs France.\nThe two teams had met in 36 previous matches, including in the 2006 FIFA World Cup group stage, a 0–0 draw.\nFrance took the lead in the 17th minute when Olivier Giroud headed in Mathieu Valbuena's corner. Almost straight from the restart, Karim Benzema intercepted a Swiss pass and set up Blaise Matuidi to increase the lead. Granit Xhaka scored, but he was deemed offside. Later, Benzema was tripped by Johan Djourou in the penalty box, but his penalty was saved by Swiss goalkeeper Diego Benaglio and Yohan Cabaye shot the rebound onto the crossbar. A quick counter-attack saw Giroud cross for Valbuena and France took a 3–0 lead at half time.\nFrance added two more goals in the second half, first Paul Pogba crossing for Benzema to score, then Benzema setting up Moussa Sissoko. Switzerland scored two late consolation goals, from a 35-yard free kick by substitute Blerim Džemaili, and a volley by Granit Xhaka after a pass by Gökhan Inler. While the referee was blowing the final whistle, Karim Benzema scored a sixth goal at the end of the match, causing some confusion for a short while about the final score.\nGiroud's goal was France's 100th goal in the World Cup, joining four other countries to have achieved this feat (Brazil, Germany, Italy and Argentina).\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nHonduras vs Ecuador.\nThe two teams had met in 14 previous matches, all in friendlies, most recently in 2013, a 2–2 draw. The two coaches, fellow Colombians Luis Fernando Suárez and Reinaldo Rueda, had previously managed their opponents: Suárez managed Ecuador in the 2006 World Cup, while Rueda managed Honduras in the 2010 World Cup. Honduras midfielder Wilson Palacios was suspended for the match, having received a red card against France.\nHonduras took the lead in the first half when Carlo Costly collected left back Brayan Beckeles's long clearance to score with his left foot.\nEcuador, which needed at least a point to stay alive in the competition, equalised three minutes later when Juan Paredes's shot was deflected and Enner Valencia turned the ball in at the far post from close range. Enner Valencia scored the game winner in the second half, heading in a free kick from Walter Ayoví.\nCostly's goal snapped Honduras's 511-minute World Cup scoreless streak stretching back to 1982, second place at the time to the record of 517 minutes between 1930 and 1990 held by Bolivia. Enner Valencia's brace gave him three total goals in the tournament, and he joined Agustín Delgado as the country's joint top scorer in the World Cup.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nHonduras vs Switzerland.\nThe two teams had met in one previous match, in the 2010 FIFA World Cup group stage, a 0–0 draw.\nAll three goals of the match were scored by Xherdan Shaqiri. In the sixth minute, he received the ball from Stephan Lichtsteiner, dribbled inside and curled the ball into the net with his left foot. In the 31st minute, a break-away by Switzerland saw Josip Drmić setting up Shaqiri to convert. Shaqiri completed his hat-trick in the 71st minute, from another break-away and assist by Drmić.\nAs Ecuador drew with France in the other match taking place simultaneously, Switzerland sealed a place in the knockout stage as the group runners-up, while Honduras, which needed a win to have any chance of qualifying for the knockout stage for the first time, were eliminated with zero points.\nShaqiri's hat-trick was the 50th hat-trick in the history of the World Cup, and also the second by a Swiss player, following Josef Hügi in the 1954 World Cup. Honduras completed their third World Cup tournament still without a win, and had played more matches (nine total) without a win than any other side.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nEcuador vs France.\nThe two teams had met in one previous match, in a friendly in 2008, won 2–0 by France. France midfielder Yohan Cabaye was suspended for the match due to accumulation of yellow cards.\nThe match finished goalless, with the point enough to confirm France's place in the knockout stage, winning the group with seven points. Ecuador, which had to match Switzerland's result in the final match to have any chance of qualification, had captain Antonio Valencia sent off in the second half after a high tackle on Lucas Digne.\nAs Switzerland defeated Honduras in the other match played at the same time, Ecuador was eliminated, thus being the only team in the CONMEBOL group to fail to advance to the Round of 16.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

        "text": "Group F of the 2014 FIFA World Cup consisted of Argentina, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Iran and Nigeria. Play began on 15 June and ended on 25 June 2014. The top two teams, Argentina and Nigeria, advanced to the round of 16.\nStandings.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nMatches.\nArgentina vs Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nThe two teams had met in two previous matches, both in friendlies, most recently in 2013, both won by Argentina.\nBosnia and Herzegovina conceded three minutes into their World Cup debut, when Lionel Messi's free kick from the left was flicked on by Marcos Rojo and bounced off Sead Kolašinac into the net for an own goal. In the second half, Messi played a one-two with substitute Gonzalo Higuaín and shot home from the edge of the penalty area with his left foot into the bottom-right corner. With five minutes remaining in normal time, Bosnia and Herzegovina pulled one back, when Senad Lulić's pass found substitute Vedad Ibišević to score the country's first ever World Cup goal, shooting under the goalkeeper with his left foot.\nKolašinac's own goal after two minutes and nine seconds broke the record for the fastest own goal in the history of the FIFA World Cup, surpassing Carlos Gamarra's own goal (two minutes and 46 seconds) in Paraguay's first group stage match against England at the 2006 FIFA World Cup.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nIran vs Nigeria.\nThe two teams had met in one previous match, in the 1998 Lunar New Year Cup, won 1–0 by Nigeria.\nIn a goalless game of few chances, Iran's Reza Ghoochannejhad forced a save from Vincent Enyeama in the first half, while Nigeria substitute Shola Ameobi headed wide in the second half.\nThis was the first goalless match as well as the first draw of the tournament after the previous 12 matches all produced a winner, and was the longest wait for a draw in a single tournament since 1930, where there were no draws in the entire tournament. This was also the first clean sheet kept by Iran in the World Cup.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nArgentina vs Iran.\nThe two teams had met in one previous match, in a friendly in 1977, won on penalties by Argentina after a 1–1 draw .\nIn a match where Argentina dominated in terms of possession and shots, they scored the only goal one minute into second half injury time when Lionel Messi received a pass from Ezequiel Lavezzi on the right wing, dribbled inside and curled a left-footed shot past the outstretched hands of the Iranian keeper Alireza Haghighi. Before the goal, Iran had chances to score, but Argentina goalkeeper Sergio Romero was able to save Ashkan Dejagah's header and Reza Ghoochannejhad's shot, and Dejagah also had a penalty appeal turned down when Argentina defender Pablo Zabaleta tackled him in the area but only just got his toe to the ball. With the win, Argentina were guaranteed to advance to the knockout stage.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nNigeria vs Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nThe two teams had never met before.\nBosnia and Herzegovina thought they had taken the lead when Edin Džeko put the ball into the net, but his effort was ruled out for offside, which replays later showed to be an incorrect decision. Referee Peter O'Leary later admitted Džeko's goal was disallowed in error. Seven minutes later, Nigeria took the lead when Emmanuel Emenike burst past Emir Spahić to cross for Peter Odemwingie to score, firing in through the legs of Asmir Begovic. Džeko came closest to scoring the equaliser to keep his team's qualification chances alive, but his shot in second-half stoppage time was deflected onto the post by Nigeria goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama. Nigeria held for the win and eliminated Bosnia and Herzegovina as a result.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nNigeria vs Argentina.\nThe two teams had met in six previous matches, including three times in the FIFA World Cup group stage, all won by Argentina (1994: 2–1; 2002: 1–0; 2010: 1–0).\nBefore the match, Nigeria were the only team yet to concede in the tournament, but their defence were breached inside three minutes when Ángel Di María's shot hit the post and Lionel Messi slammed home the rebound. Nigeria, which would qualify for the knockout stage if they gained a point or if Iran failed to beat Bosnia and Herzegovina in the other match, equalised within a minute, when Michel Babatunde fed Ahmed Musa, and he cut inside and curled the ball into the net. Messi put Argentina in front in first half injury time with a direct free kick, but Musa equalised once again early in the second half, after playing a one-two with Emmanuel Emenike and scored. Argentina, which needed only a point to win the group, then scored the game winner when a corner from Ezequiel Lavezzi was flicked on by an Ezequiel Garay header and Marcos Rojo scored with his knee. Argentina won the group with a perfect record of three wins out of three, while Nigeria were able to qualify as group runners-up despite losing as Iran also lost to Bosnia and Herzegovina in the other match.\nMusa became the first Nigerian player to score more than once in a World Cup match.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nBosnia and Herzegovina vs Iran.\nThe two teams had met in five previous matches, all in friendlies, most recently in 2009.\nBosnia and Herzegovina, which had already been eliminated, led 1–0 at half-time through a goal by Edin Džeko, shooting low with his left foot after he received a pass from Miralem Pjanić. Pjanić extended the lead in the second half when he slotted low past the goalkeeper, after receiving a through ball from Tino-Sven Sušić. Iran, which had to win and also hoped Nigeria lost to Argentina to have any chance for qualification to the knockout stage, reduced the deficit after Reza Ghoochannejhad tapped home from close range from a Javad Nekounam cross. However, Bosnia and Herzegovina scored a third goal when Avdija Vršajević slotted home with his right foot after Sejad Salihović played him in on the right, sealing their first win in World Cup finals history, and also confirming Iran's elimination, meaning that they failed to advance to the knockout stage for all four of their World Cup campaigns.\nWith Ghoochannejhad's goal for Iran, the 2014 World Cup became the first since 1998 in which every participating team managed to score at least once.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

        "text": "Group G of the 2014 FIFA World Cup consisted of Germany, Portugal, Ghana and United States. Play began on 16 June and ended on 26 June 2014. The top two teams, Germany and the United States, advanced to the round of 16. Germany would go on to win the World Cup.\nStandings.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nMatches.\nGermany vs Portugal.\nThe two teams had met in 17 previous matches, including in the 2006 FIFA World Cup third place match, won by Germany 3–1. Their most recent meeting was in the UEFA Euro 2012 group stage, won by Germany 1–0.\nGermany took the lead with a Thomas Müller penalty kick, shooting low and hard into the bottom left-hand corner, awarded after a foul on Mario Götze by João Pereira. Mats Hummels doubled the advantage for Germany by heading in a corner kick from Toni Kroos.\nShortly before halftime Müller and Pepe were involved in an altercation, in which Pepe headbutted Müller and was sent off. In first half stoppage time, Müller intercepted a clearance from Bruno Alves to slot home. Müller completed his hat-trick in the second half, as he scored from close range after Portugal goalkeeper Rui Patrício stopped André Schürrle's cross from the right.\nThe match was Germany's 100th in the World Cup, the first team to reach the milestone. Müller's hat-trick was the seventh by a German player in the World Cup, the most of any nation. This was Portugal's worst loss in their World Cup history.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGhana vs United States.\nThe two teams had met in three previous matches, including twice in World Cup in 2006 and 2010, where both times Ghana beat United States 2–1. The 2006 FIFA World Cup encounter was in their last group stage match, and the 2010 FIFA World Cup encounter was in the round of 16 final where Ghana won again, which in both occasions, eliminated United States from those previous World Cups.\nClint Dempsey opened the scoring for the United States within 29 seconds (the fifth fastest goal in the history of the World Cup), as he received the ball from Jermaine Jones, dribbled past John Boye and shot into the far corner. The lead lasted until the 82nd minute, when Asamoah Gyan's back-heel set up André Ayew to score. However, the United States scored the game-winning goal four minutes later, when half-time substitute John Brooks headed in Graham Zusi's corner. The American victory was marred by an injury to Jozy Altidore, leaving the match in the 21st minute with a strained left hamstring.\nDempsey's goal was officially timed by FIFA at 30 seconds after kick-off, the fifth fastest in World Cup history, and the fastest by an American player. He also became the first American player to score in three World Cups. DaMarcus Beasley became the first American to play in four World Cups. Brooks became the first American substitute ever to score in a World Cup.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGermany vs Ghana.\nThe two teams had met in three previous matches, including in the 2010 FIFA World Cup group stage, won by Germany 1–0.\nAfter a goalless first half, Germany took the lead when Thomas Müller crossed from the right for Mario Götze, whose header went in off his thigh. Ghana equalised three minutes later, when André Ayew headed in Harrison Afful's cross from the right. Ghana then took the lead when Sulley Muntari intercepted the ball from Philipp Lahm, then slipped a through ball for Asamoah Gyan to score with his right foot.\nJust two minutes after coming on as a substitute, Miroslav Klose once again tied up the match, with a close-range finish after Benedikt Höwedes flicked on a corner from Toni Kroos.\nKlose's goal took his World Cup total to 15, equalling the record mark held by Brazil's Ronaldo. He also joined Pelé and Uwe Seeler as the only players to have scored in four World Cups. Gyan became the joint top African scorer in the World Cup (tied with Cameroon's Roger Milla) with five goals, and also the first African player to score in three World Cups. Just as in the 2010 meeting, Jérôme Boateng (Germany) and Kevin-Prince Boateng (Ghana) faced each other, the second time two brothers faced each other in a World Cup game.\nIn the 52nd minute, a man with a Polish passport, identified as Leszek Ludomir, invaded the pitch shirtless, with neo-Nazi letters and numbers painted on his chest and back. FIFA's official TV feed cut out the images. The man was approached in a calm and friendly manner by Ghana midfielder Sulley Muntari, who quickly escorted him off the pitch, and he was then taken into custody by the stadium security. It was also quite surprising that no police were seen on the pitch in pursuit of the invader.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nUnited States vs Portugal.\nThe two teams had met in five previous matches, including in the 2002 FIFA World Cup group stage, won by the United States 3–2. Portugal defender Pepe was suspended for the match after his red card against Germany.\nPortugal took the lead within five minutes, when Geoff Cameron's mis-hit clearance fell to Nani and he scored from close range. Near the end of the first half, Nani's long-range shot hit the post, and American goalkeeper Tim Howard saved Éder's follow-up. In the second half, Michael Bradley had a shot cleared off the line by Ricardo Costa, but the United States eventually equalised through Jermaine Jones, as he curled in a right-foot shot in after a corner was cleared to him.\nThe United States then took the lead, as Graham Zusi crossed for Clint Dempsey to score with his midriff. Had the United States held on for the win, they would have clinched a place in the knockout stage while eliminating Portugal at the same time, but in the fifth minute of injury time, Cristiano Ronaldo crossed for substitute Silvestre Varela to head in the equaliser and keep Portugal's qualification hopes alive.\nVarela's goal (94:33) was the latest World Cup goal scored in regulation time. In the 39th minute, the players took a short water break during an injury stoppage, but this was not considered an official \"cooling break\" as introduced by FIFA for this tournament.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nUnited States vs Germany.\nThe two teams had met in nine previous matches, including twice in the FIFA World Cup, both won by Germany (1998, group stage: 2–0; 2002, quarter-finals: 1–0). The match featured two German coaches, Jürgen Klinsmann and Joachim Löw, facing each other. United States coach Klinsmann played in three World Cups for Germany (he scored the second goal in the 1998 match against the United States), and also managed them in 2006 with Löw as his assistant, who succeeded him after the World Cup.\nBoth teams came into this match needing only one point to qualify for the knockout stage. The only goal of the match was scored by Thomas Müller in the 55th minute, who slotted in the rebound with his right foot from the edge of the penalty area after American goalkeeper Tim Howard parried out Per Mertesacker's header.\nWith the win, Germany qualified as group winners, while the United States also qualified despite the loss as Portugal's 2–1 win over Ghana at the same time ensured that the Americans finished as group runners-up above the Portuguese on goal difference, meaning that they reached the knockout stage of consecutive World Cups for the first time. This was the first match of the tournament where Bastian Schweinsteiger was included in the starting lineup and the last match where Lukas Podolski saw any time on the pitch.\nWith Costa Rica and Mexico also reaching the knockout stage earlier, this was the first time there were three CONCACAF teams in the knockout stage of a World Cup.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nPortugal vs Ghana.\nThe two teams had never met before. Ghana midfielder Sulley Muntari was suspended for the match due to accumulation of yellow cards. However, along with fellow midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng, Muntari was indefinitely suspended from the team for disciplinary reasons by the Ghana Football Association before the match.\nBoth teams came into the match knowing that to have any chance of qualifying for the knockout stage, they had to win while hoping that the United States vs Germany match, played at the same time, did not end in a draw. Portugal took the lead in the first half, when John Boye deflected in Miguel Veloso's cross with his knee for an own goal. Asamoah Gyan equalised for Ghana in the second half, heading in Kwadwo Asamoah's outside of the foot cross from the left. It was Gyan's sixth goal in World Cups, passing the tally of Roger Milla as the top African goalscorer in the competition. Cristiano Ronaldo scored the winner for Portugal in the 80th minute, after Ghana goalkeeper Fatau Dauda palmed the ball to him in the penalty area after a cross from the left, making Ronaldo the first Portuguese player to score in three World Cups.\nDespite the win and Germany's win over the United States, Portugal finished behind the United States on goal difference, and were eliminated together with Ghana, who failed to reach the knockout stage for the first time in their three campaigns.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

The top two teams, Belgium and Algeria, advanced to the round of 16.\nStandings.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nMatches.\nBelgium vs Algeria.\nThe two teams had met in two previous matches, both friendlies, most recently in 2003, won 3–1 by Belgium.\nAlgeria took a one-goal lead in the first half after Sofiane Feghouli converted a penalty kick, awarded for a foul on him by Jan Vertonghen. Belgium came back with two goals in the second half, both scored by substitutes.\nThe equaliser was scored by Marouane Fellaini, heading in a cross from the left by Kevin De Bruyne, followed by the game winner scored by Dries Mertens from a pass by Eden Hazard.\nFeghouli's goal snapped Algeria's 506-minute World Cup scoreless streak stretching back to 1986, second place at the time to the record of 517 minutes between 1930 and 1990 held by Bolivia.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nRussia vs South Korea.\nThe two teams had met in one previous match, in a friendly in 2013.\nAfter a goalless first half, the two teams traded goals by substitutes in the second half as the match finished 1–1. First, Han Kook-young passed to Lee Keun-ho, and his long range shot was spilled by Russian goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev into the net.\nRussia equalised after Alan Dzagoev's shot was parried by South Korean goalkeeper Jung Sung-ryong, the clearance hit Andrey Yeshchenko, and Aleksandr Kerzhakov scored from close range.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nBelgium vs Russia.\nThe two teams had met in eight previous matches (including matches involving the Soviet Union), including four in the FIFA World Cup (1970, group stage: Belgium 1–4 Soviet Union; 1982, second group stage: Belgium 0–1 Soviet Union; 1986, round of 16: Belgium 4–3 (aet) Soviet Union; 2002, group stage: Belgium 3–2 Russia).\nAleksandr Kokorin had Russia's best chance in the first half, heading wide from six yards. Late in the second half, Belgian substitute Kevin Mirallas hit the post with his free kick, but Belgium did find the game-winner through another substitute, Divock Origi scoring from 8 yards out after Eden Hazard's cut-back from the left. This victory sent Belgium into the knockout stage.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nSouth Korea vs Algeria.\nThe two teams had met in two previous matches, both in friendlies both in 1985.\nAlgeria, who needed at least a point to stay alive in the competition, scored three goals in the first half to take a comfortable lead. First, Islam Slimani sped past two South Korean defenders to receive Carl Medjani's long pass and slot home with his left foot past the advancing goalkeeper. Two minutes later, Rafik Halliche headed in Abdelmoumene Djabou's corner from the left. Djabou scored himself later after he received a pass from Slimani, shooting low with his left foot from twelve yards out. Early in the second half, Son Heung-min controlled a long pass from Ki Sung-yueng to shoot with his left foot between the goalkeeper's legs and reduce the deficit, but Yacine Brahimi restored Algeria's three-goal lead after a one-two with Sofiane Feghouli to side foot home from inside the penalty area with his right foot. Koo Ja-cheol scored South Korea's second goal after a pass from Lee Keun-ho from the left, but Algeria held on for its third ever World Cup victory, but its first since 24 June 1982.\nAlgeria became the first African team to score four goals in a World Cup match.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nSouth Korea vs Belgium.\nThe two teams had met in three previous matches, including twice in the FIFA World Cup group stage (1990: South Korea 0–2 Belgium; 1998: South Korea 1–1 Belgium).\nBelgium, who had already qualified for the knockout stage and would win the group if either South Korea did not win this match, or Algeria didn't beat Russia in the other simultaneous match, had Steven Defour sent off for a reckless tackle on Kim Shin-wook at the end of the first half. Belgium scored the only goal of the match in the second half, when substitute Divock Origi's shot was parried by South Korea goalkeeper Kim Seung-gyu and Jan Vertonghen converted the rebound with his left foot.\nBelgium's win ensured that they topped their group, while South Korea, who had to win by two goals to have any chance for qualification to the knockout stage, were eliminated.\nSouth Korea's elimination meant that all four Asian representatives finished bottom of their group with a combined record of zero wins, three draws and nine defeats, the worst showing by the Asian Football Confederation since the 1990 World Cup.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nAlgeria vs Russia.\nThe two teams had met in three previous matches (only involving matches during the time period of the Soviet Union).\nAleksandr Kokorin opened the scoring for Russia, who had to win to have chance of qualifying for the knockout stage, in the 6th minute when he scored with a header after a cross from Dmitri Kombarov from the left. Algeria equalised in the 60th minute when Islam Slimani scored with a header at the back post after a free kick from the left by Yacine Brahimi was missed by Russian goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev. Algeria held on for the draw, and as South Korea lost to Belgium in the other match played at the same time, Algeria finished as group runners-up and reached the second round for the first time in their history (after unsuccessful campaigns in 1982, 1986, and 2010), while Russia failed to advance out of the group stage in all three tournaments since the break-up of the Soviet Union.\nFor Algeria's goal, television replays showed that Akinfeev had a green laser light shining in his face during the play.\nAfter the match the Algerian Football Federation was fined 50,000 CHF by FIFA for the use of laser pointers, a prohibited item in the stadium according to FIFA Stadium Safety and Security Regulations, and other violations of the rules by Algerian fans.\nWith fellow African representative Nigeria also reaching the knockout stage earlier, this was the first time that there were two teams from the Confederation of African Football in the knockout stage of a World Cup.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

        "text": "The knockout stage of the 2014 FIFA World Cup was the second and final stage of the competition, following the group stage. It began on 28 June with the round of 16 and ended on 13 July with the final match of the tournament, held at Estádio do Maracanã, Rio de Janeiro. The top two teams from each group (16 in total) advanced to the knockout stage to compete in a single-elimination tournament. A third-place match was played between the two losing teams of the semi-finals.\nIn all matches in the knockout stage, if the score was level at the end of 90 minutes, two 15-minute periods of extra time were played. If the score was still level after extra time, the match was decided by a penalty shoot-out.\n\"All times listed below are in Brasília official time ().\"\nQualified teams.\nThe top two placed teams from each of the eight groups qualified for the knockout stage.\nRound of 16.\nBrazil vs Chile.\nThe two teams had met in 68 previous matches, including three times in the FIFA World Cup knockout stage, all won by Brazil (1962, semi-finals: 4–2; 1998, round of 16: 4–1; 2010, round of 16: 3–0).\nBrazil opened the scoring when Thiago Silva flicked on a corner kick before David Luiz turned the ball into the net with his thigh. While replays suggested that Chilean defender Gonzalo Jara may have had the last touch, FIFA later confirmed that the goal was scored by Luiz, not Jara. Chile equalised when Hulk lost possession after a throw-in in his own half; Eduardo Vargas stole the ball and passed to Alexis Sánchez to score.\nIn the second half, Hulk's goal was disallowed as Howard Webb adjudged that the player used his arm in bringing down the ball and gave him a yellow card instead. Chances were few after that with Brazil dominating possession and Hulk forcing Claudio Bravo into a decent save, and the match went to extra time. The best chance of extra time came in the last seconds as Mauricio Pinilla's shot hit the crossbar. In the resulting penalty shootout, the score was tied 2–2 after four rounds, with Brazil goalkeeper Júlio César saving from Pinilla and Sánchez, while Willian missed and Hulk's shot was saved by Bravo. In the fifth round, Neymar scored his penalty, meaning Chile had to score, but Jara's shot hit the inside of the post. Brazil advanced to the quarter-finals to face Colombia.\nThe result meant that in all four World Cups where Chile qualified for the knockout stage, they were eliminated by Brazil.\n&lt;section begin=i1 /&gt;&lt;section end=i1 /&gt;\nColombia vs Uruguay.\nThe two teams had met in 38 previous matches, including in the 1962 FIFA World Cup group stage, won 2–1 by Uruguay. Their most recent meetings were in the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, with both teams winning at home, Colombia winning 4–0 and Uruguay winning 2–0. Uruguayan striker Luis Suárez was not in the line-up because of a nine-game ban imposed by FIFA due to a biting incident involving Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini during their final group stage match. This was the first (and only) match of Uruguay in Maracanã Stadium in a World Cup since the historical Maracanazo.\nColombia won 2–0 with both goals from James Rodríguez, the first in the 28th minute, where he controlled Abel Aguilar's headed ball on his chest before volleying left-footed from 25 yards out with the ball going in off the underside of the crossbar, which won the 2014 FIFA Puskás Award later in the year.\nThe second goal, in the 50th minute, was a close-range shot from six yards out after receiving the ball from a header by Juan Cuadrado on the right.\nColombia progressed through to the quarter-finals for the first time in their history, where they would face Brazil. \n&lt;section begin=i2 /&gt;&lt;section end=i2 /&gt;\nNetherlands vs Mexico.\nThe two teams had met in six previous matches, including in the 1998 FIFA World Cup group stage, a 2–2 draw. Mexico midfielder José Juan Vázquez was suspended for the match due to accumulation of yellow cards.\nGiovani dos Santos opened the scoring for Mexico early in the second half with a left-footed volley from outside the box after gathering a Dutch clearance. \nMexico led until the 88th minute, when a Dutch corner was headed back by substitute Klaas-Jan Huntelaar for Wesley Sneijder to equalise with a hard shot from 16 yards. Only a few minutes later, with stoppage time coming to a close, Arjen Robben drew a penalty for the Netherlands after being fouled by Rafael Márquez on the right of the penalty area, which Huntelaar converted to win the match for the Netherlands. Netherlands advanced to the quarter-finals to face Costa Rica, while Mexico were eliminated in the round of 16 for the sixth tournament in a row.\nThe match was the first time in World Cup history where a cooling break was instituted, with temperatures at and humidity levels at 68%.\n&lt;section begin=i3 /&gt;&lt;section end=i3 /&gt;\nCosta Rica vs Greece.\nThe two teams had never met before. This match was Greece's first ever in the FIFA World Cup knockout stage.\nBryan Ruiz opened the scoring in the 52nd minute when Christian Bolaños passed to him and he shot low left-footed from outside the penalty area to the right corner of the net with Greek goalkeeper Orestis Karnezis not moving on his line. Costa Rica were then reduced to 10 men with Óscar Duarte being sent off after picking up a second yellow card. Sokratis Papastathopoulos equalised in injury time shooting into the net from seven yards out after Costa Rica goalkeeper Keylor Navas had saved an initial shot from Theofanis Gekas. No goals were scored in extra time, and the match went to a penalty shoot-out. During the intermission before the penalty shoot-out, the Greek coach Fernando Santos was sent off following a dispute with the referee. In the penalty shoot-out, Navas saved Gekas' shot before Michael Umaña scored the winning penalty for Costa Rica hitting it high to the goalkeeper's right.\nThis marked the first time that Costa Rica progressed to the quarter-finals in a FIFA World Cup, where they faced the Netherlands.\n&lt;section begin=i4 /&gt;&lt;section end=i4 /&gt;\nFrance vs Nigeria.\nThe two teams had met in one previous match, in a friendly in 2009, won by Nigeria 1–0.\nPaul Pogba had the best chance in the first half but his right foot volley after a cross from the right was saved by Vincent Enyeama. In the second half Yohan Cabaye saw a shot come back off the bar. The opening goal came with 11 minutes to play when Pogba headed into the net after a mistake by Enyeama where he failed to hold onto a corner kick from the left by Mathieu Valbuena. In injury time, France got a second when Joseph Yobo put into his own net under pressure from Antoine Griezmann after a cross from the right by Valbuena.\nFrance advanced to the quarter-finals to face Germany, while Nigeria were eliminated at the round of 16 in all three World Cups where they reached the knockout stage.\n&lt;section begin=i5 /&gt;&lt;section end=i5 /&gt;\nGermany vs Algeria.\nThe two teams had met in two previous matches, including in the 1982 FIFA World Cup group stage, where Algeria defeated West Germany 2–1. This match was Algeria's first ever in the FIFA World Cup knockout stage.\nAfter a goalless 90 minutes when an Algerian goal was disallowed, Germany opened the scoring two minutes into extra time, when half-time substitute André Schürrle scored with a left foot back-heel from Thomas Müller's cross from the left. \nGermany extended the lead in the 120th minute when Mesut Özil converted with his left foot high into the net after Schürrle's shot was blocked on the line, but Algeria pulled one back in injury time when substitute Abdelmoumene Djabou scored with his left foot from six yards after a cross from the right by Sofiane Feghouli.\nGermany advanced to the quarter-finals to face France, continuing their streak of reaching the last eight in every World Cup since 1954. Djabou's goal, timed at 120 minutes and 51 seconds, was the latest goal in World Cup history, surpassing Alessandro Del Piero's goal against Germany in 2006, timed at 120 minutes and 32 seconds.\n&lt;section begin=i6 /&gt;&lt;section end=i6 /&gt;\nArgentina vs Switzerland.\nThe two teams had met in six previous matches, including in the 1966 FIFA World Cup group stage, won by Argentina 2–0.\nThe match went to extra time with Ángel Di María scoring the only goal with two minutes remaining with a side-foot finish from the right of the penalty area after a run and pass from Lionel Messi. \nSwitzerland had a chance to equalise in injury time but Blerim Džemaili headed against the post then prodded the rebound wide. Argentina advanced to the quarter-finals to face Belgium.\n&lt;section begin=i7 /&gt;&lt;section end=i7 /&gt;\nBelgium vs United States.\nThe two teams had met in five previous matches, including one in the 1930 FIFA World Cup group stage won by United States 3–0 and which was one of the two first FIFA World Cup matches to be played. An unofficial friendly between the two teams was scheduled on 12 June 2014 in São Paulo, but was cancelled because of traffic due to the opening ceremony and match. Belgium midfielder Steven Defour was suspended for the match, after being sent off in the last group stage match against South Korea.\nIn a game dominated by the Belgians, but still goalless through the first 90 minutes thanks to U.S. goalkeeper Tim Howard, U.S. striker Chris Wondolowski missed a great chance in stoppage time from less than five yards out. Thus, the game went to extra time and Belgium took the lead within two minutes. Romelu Lukaku, who came off the bench at the start of extra time, crossed from the right into the penalty area, Matt Besler failed to clear the ball, and Kevin De Bruyne shot low into the far corner from the right of the penalty area. Near the end of extra time first half, De Bruyne's through ball from the right set up Lukaku to extend the lead with a left footed shot to the net. \nThe United States pulled one back early in extra time second half, when substitute Julian Green volleyed in Michael Bradley's lobbed pass with his right foot from near the penalty spot. Minutes later, the U.S. nearly equalised on a set piece routine that saw Clint Dempsey through on goal, but his first touch was too hard and the ball was corralled by Belgian goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. Belgium held on for the win, and advanced to the quarter-finals to face Argentina.\nWith Belgium's victory, the 2014 World Cup became the first tournament where all the top teams of the group stage advanced to the quarter-finals. U.S. goalkeeper Tim Howard recorded 15 saves in the match, which was the most saves recorded in a match since FIFA started to keep track of the number of saves in 1966. Julian Green also became the youngest player to score a goal in the 2014 FIFA World Cup.\n&lt;section begin=i8 /&gt;&lt;section end=i8 /&gt;\nQuarter-finals.\nFrance vs Germany.\nThe two teams had met in 25 previous matches, including three times in the FIFA World Cup (1958, third place match: France 6–3 West Germany; 1982 semi-finals: France 3–3 (aet) West Germany, West Germany won 5–4 on penalties; 1986, semi-finals: France 0–2 West Germany).\nThe only goal came in the 13th minute when Mats Hummels got ahead of his marker Raphaël Varane to head Germany into the lead from ten yards out after a free-kick from Toni Kroos on the left. Karim Benzema had a shot in second half injury time from the left which he hit straight at Manuel Neuer.\nGermany advanced to the semi-finals where they would face Brazil. They became the first team to reach four straight World Cup semi-finals, breaking the record of three shared by their predecessor West Germany (1966–1974 and 1982–1990) and Brazil (1970–1978 and 1994–2002). Germany was also guaranteed their 13th top four finish, the most by any nation.\n&lt;section begin=j1 /&gt;&lt;section end=j1 /&gt;\nBrazil vs Colombia.\nThe two teams had met in 25 previous matches, but never in the FIFA World Cup. This was the first time Colombia had reached the quarter-finals of the World Cup. Brazil midfielder Luiz Gustavo was suspended for the match due to accumulation of yellow cards.\nBrazil took the lead in the 7th minute, when Neymar's corner from the left was turned in from close range by Thiago Silva. \nColombia appeared to have equalized through Mario Yepes in the 66th minute, but it was overturned for offside. Instead, Brazil doubled the lead in the 69th minute when David Luiz scored directly from a long-range free kick, side-footing the ball over the wall and into the top-right corner, despite David Ospina getting fingers on the ball. Colombia reduced the deficit with 10 minutes to go, when James Rodríguez converted a penalty kick low into the left corner and sent the goalkeeper the wrong way. The penalty was awarded after substitute Carlos Bacca was fouled by Brazil goalkeeper Júlio César. Neymar was kneed in the back by Colombia defender Juan Camilo Zúñiga in the 88th minute, which resulted in the striker's withdrawal from the match. Subsequent medical evaluation discovered a fractured vertebra, forcing the Brazilian to miss the remainder of the tournament. Brazil advanced to the semi-final, where they faced Germany.\nJames's sixth goal of the tournament was enough for him to win the Golden Boot award. He also became the first player to score in his first five career World Cup matches since Peru's Teófilo Cubillas (across the 1970 and 1978 tournaments).\n&lt;section begin=j2 /&gt;&lt;section end=j2 /&gt;\nArgentina vs Belgium.\nThe two teams had met in three previous matches, including twice in the FIFA World Cup (1982, group stage: Argentina 0–1 Belgium; 1986, semi-finals: Argentina 2–0 Belgium). Argentina defender Marcos Rojo was suspended for the match due to accumulation of yellow cards.\nThe only goal of the match was scored by Argentina forward Gonzalo Higuaín in the eighth minute, a powerful shot with his right foot from just inside the penalty area after a pass from Di María was deflected to him by Belgium defender Jan Vertonghen. \nHiguaín had a chance to extend the lead in the second half, but his shot hit the crossbar. Argentina won 1–0 to advance to the semi-finals, where they would face the Netherlands.\n&lt;section begin=j3 /&gt;&lt;section end=j3 /&gt;\nNetherlands vs Costa Rica.\nThe two teams had never met before. This was the first time Costa Rica had reached the quarter-finals of the World Cup. Costa Rica defender Óscar Duarte was suspended for the match, after being sent off in the round of 16 match against Greece.\nAfter a goalless 90 minutes, which saw Wesley Sneijder's free kick hit the post and Robin van Persie's shot deflected onto the crossbar by Costa Rica defender Yeltsin Tejeda, the match headed to extra time. In the second period, substitute Marco Ureña had a shot saved by Netherlands goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen, while Sneijder had another shot hit the crossbar. In added time at the end of 120 minutes, Dutch manager Louis van Gaal brought on Tim Krul to replace Cillessen. \nIn the subsequent penalty shoot-out, Krul saved from Bryan Ruiz and Michael Umaña, while the Netherlands scored all four of their kicks to advance to the semi-finals, where they would face Argentina.\nUzbek referee Ravshan Irmatov took charge of his ninth World Cup match, breaking the record of most World Cup games officiated, which he previously held jointly with Joël Quiniou of France, Benito Archundia of Mexico, and Jorge Larrionda of Uruguay.\n&lt;section begin=j4 /&gt;&lt;section end=j4 /&gt;\nSemi-finals.\nBrazil vs Germany.\nThe two teams had met in 21 previous matches, including in the final of the 2002 FIFA World Cup (their only previous encounter in the tournament's history), won by Brazil 2–0.\nWhile Germany kept the same starting line-up as their quarter-final against France, Brazil made two changes: defender and captain Thiago Silva was suspended for the match due to accumulation of yellow cards, and was replaced by Dante, while forward Neymar was sidelined after suffering a fractured vertebra in the quarter-final against Colombia, and was replaced by Bernard. Germany took the lead in the 11th minute, Thomas Müller volleying in Toni Kroos's corner. Miroslav Klose scored Germany's second goal, after a passing move saw him set up by Kroos, his first shot was saved by Brazil goalkeeper Júlio César, but he slotted in the rebound. Kroos then scored two quick goals in succession, the first one after Philipp Lahm's cross was missed by Müller, the second one after stealing the ball from Fernandinho and playing a quick one-two with Sami Khedira. Khedira then scored Germany's fourth goal in six minutes, after exchanging passes with Mesut Özil, to give Germany the 5–0 half-time lead. Substitute André Schürrle added two more goals in the second half, first slotting in from Lahm's cross, then scoring via the crossbar after a cut-back from Müller. Brazil scored a consolation goal in the 90th minute, as Oscar received a pass from Marcelo, dribbled inside and scored. Germany reached their eighth World Cup final, a record by any nation, where they would face Argentina, while Brazil had to settle for the third-place play-off against the Netherlands.\nThe game equalled Brazil's biggest margin of defeat, a 6–0 loss to Uruguay in 1920, and it broke a 62-match home unbeaten streak in competitive matches going back to the 1975 Copa América, where they lost 3–1 to Peru in the same exact stadium of this match. The match also broke many World Cup records: It was Brazil's biggest World Cup defeat (eclipsing their 1998 final loss to France), the biggest defeat by a World Cup host nation (previous record was by three goals), and the biggest margin of victory in a World Cup semi-final (three previous semi-finals ended in 6–1 scorelines).\nKlose's goal was his 16th at World Cup finals tournaments, allowing him to overtake Brazil's Ronaldo as the tournament's all-time top scorer. Germany's seven goals took their total tally in World Cup history to 223, surpassing Brazil's 221 goals to first place overall.\nNetherlands vs Argentina.\nThe two teams had met in eight previous matches, including four times in the FIFA World Cup: Netherlands won 4–0 in the second group stage of the 1974 FIFA World Cup and 2–1 in the quarter-finals of the 1998 FIFA World Cup, Argentina won 3–1 (after extra time) in the final of the 1978 FIFA World Cup, whereas a group stage encounter of the 2006 FIFA World Cup ended in a 0–0 draw.\nThe Netherlands made one change to their starting line-up from their quarter-final, with Nigel de Jong returning from injury to replace Memphis Depay, while Argentina made two changes, with Marcos Rojo returning from suspension to replace José María Basanta and Enzo Pérez replacing the injured Di María. The match finished 0–0 after extra-time with very little chances as both sides cancelled each other out. In the penalty shoot-out, Sergio Romero saved the first penalty from Ron Vlaar diving to his left and the fifth penalty of the shoot-out from Wesley Sneijder when he dived high to his right. Argentina scored all of their four penalties to win 4–2. Maxi Rodríguez scored the decisive fourth penalty, shooting to Dutch goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen's right to send Argentina into the final, where they would face Germany, while the Netherlands had to settle for the third-place play-off against Brazil.\nThis was the first World Cup semi-final to end in a goalless draw. Argentina won their fourth World Cup penalty shoot-out, tied with Germany for most wins, and were involved in their fifth World Cup shoot-out, a record for any nation.\n&lt;section begin=k2 /&gt;&lt;section end=k2 /&gt;\nThird place play-off.\nThe two teams had met in 11 previous meetings, including four times in the FIFA World Cup: Netherlands won 2–0 in the second group stage of the 1974 FIFA World Cup and 2–1 in the quarter-finals of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, and Brazil won 3–2 in the quarter-finals of the 1994 FIFA World Cup and 4–2 on penalties after a 1–1 draw (after extra time) in the semi-finals of the 1998 FIFA World Cup.\nBrazil made six changes in their starting line-up from their semi-final, while the Netherlands made only two, with Wesley Sneijder, who was originally part of the Dutch starting line-up, replaced by Jonathan de Guzmán after an injury during the pre-match warm-up prevented him from playing. The Netherlands opened the scoring within three minutes, after Van Persie converted a penalty kick awarded for a foul on Arjen Robben by Thiago Silva. Daley Blind extended the lead in the 17th minute, scoring after a David Luiz headed clearance fell to him inside the penalty area. Georginio Wijnaldum completed the scoring in second half injury time as he shot home from substitute Daryl Janmaat's cross from the right, the ball going in off the Brazilian goalkeeper’s foot. \nThe Netherlands finished third for the first time in their World Cup history. With Michel Vorm's participation (who was substituted into the match in second half injury time), the Netherlands became the first team to use all of their 23 players in a World Cup since the finals squads were expanded from 22 to 23 players in 2002. Brazil, who finished fourth for the second time in World Cup history, conceded a total of 14 goals in the tournament, the most they had ever allowed in a World Cup and also the most conceded by any World Cup hosts. Brazil also became the second team to concede 100 World Cup goals, after Germany. Van Persie's goal was the 100th goal that Brazil had conceded in the FIFA World Cup and made him the second highest Dutch goalscorer with six World Cup goals along with Wesley Sneijder, Arjen Robben, Dennis Bergkamp, and Rob Rensenbrink, all behind Johnny Rep on seven. Lastly, since the beginning of the 21st century, all four World Cups in 2002, 2006, 2010 and 2014 involved the third-place victors scoring three goals. (this trend would stop in 2018, when Belgium scored only twice against England).\n&lt;section begin=l1 /&gt;&lt;section end=l1 /&gt;\nFinal.\nThe two teams had met in 20 previous matches, including six times in the FIFA World Cup: 1958, group stage: West Germany 3–1 Argentina; 1966, group stage: West Germany 0–0 Argentina; 1986, final: West Germany 2–3 Argentina; 1990, final: West Germany 1–0 Argentina; 2006, quarter-finals: Germany 1–1 Argentina (after extra time, Germany won 4–2 on penalties); 2010 FIFA World Cup, quarter-finals: Germany 4–0 Argentina. Their third final meeting is the most ever in World Cup history, and also tied the record for the most frequent fixture in tournament history, as Brazil vs Sweden and Germany vs Serbia (including Yugoslavia) had also been played seven times in the World Cup.\nBoth teams initially named unchanged starting line-ups from their semi-finals, but Germany had to make a late change as Sami Khedira injured his calf and was replaced by Christoph Kramer, who was himself substituted in the first half by André Schürrle after a blow to his head. In the first half, Gonzalo Higuaín shot wide after a Toni Kroos's misplaced header fell to him, and also had a goal disallowed for offside. Later, Jérôme Boateng cleared off the line after a Lionel Messi run, and Benedikt Höwedes's header hit the post. In the second half, Argentina's best chance fell to Messi, whose shot went just wide, while Toni Kroos also had a chance for Germany but could not convert. For the third World Cup final in a row, the match went to extra time. In the first half, Schürrle had a shot saved by Sergio Romero, while Rodrigo Palacio's lobbed shot was also unsuccessful. Germany scored the only goal in the second half, as Schürrle ran down the left wing and crossed for substitute Mario Götze, who controlled the ball on his chest and volleyed past Romero.\nGermany won their fourth World Cup title, and their first title since German reunification (they won as West Germany in 1954, 1974, and 1990). It was the first time a European team won the tournament in the Americas. For the third tournament in a row, the World Cup was won by a European team, first time for any confederation. Argentina finished as the runners-up for the third time in their history.\nA total of 171 goals were scored in the tournament, a joint record along with the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Götze's goal was the 32nd by a substitute, a World Cup record. Including the final, a total of eight matches went to extra time, a joint record along with the 1990 FIFA World Cup."

        "text": "Jimmy David Stevens (born 27 January 1991) is an English former professional rugby union player, most recently playing for Leicester Tigers in Premiership Rugby. He played as a Hooker. Stevens joined London Irish in 2013, and played 42 times before leaving for a two-season spell at Nottingham.\nEarly life.\nJimmy was born in Truro, Cornwall, and grew up in the town of St Ives. He started playing rugby at his local club, St Ives RFC, along with his older brothers Louis and Tony, before moving to Redruth RFC junior section, where he continued his development under the guidance of coaches Nigel Thomas, Phil Olds and Paul Hancock. Jimmy's performances for Redruth and his county side saw him selected for England Under 16s, where he took part in an unbeaten 4 Nations tournament. Jimmy continued his rugby at Truro College and international honours continued, with call-ups to the England U18 and U19 teams.\nProfessional career.\nJimmy signed an academy contract with Leicester Tigers, before being promoted to the first team in 2011/2012. Here he was lucky enough to play with the likes of George Chuter and Tom Youngs, and spent some time on loan to Nottingham RFC. His continued performances saw him signed to London Irish by head coach Brian Smith at the start of this season, and he made an immediate impact, with 3 tries from his first 6 appearances and a near faultless performance in his first game in the Amlin Cup."

        "text": "Joseph Nathaniel Jackson (born February 8, 1992) is an American professional basketball player who last played for the Northern Arizona Suns of the NBA G League. He played college basketball for the University of Memphis where he was named the 2013 Conference USA Player of the Year.\nEarly life.\nJackson was born in Memphis, Tennessee to parents Lachaundra Jackson and Joseph Burns. Due to his parents struggles financially and living in a difficult area where Jackson was constantly getting into trouble and not attending school, he and his two younger sisters moved in with his grandmother, Lillie Cox. As a seventh grader, Jackson was rarely attending school, but after moving in with his grandmother, his life began to turn around during eight grade.\nHigh school career.\nJackson was a consensus top 15 recruit coming out of White Station High School in Memphis, Tennessee. As a senior in 2009–10, he averaged 29.3 points, 6.2 rebounds, 3.9 assists and 2.8 steals per game. He also finished his four-year prep career having scored 3,451 points (23.2 per game) and amassed the second-highest points total in the history of Shelby-Metro area high school basketball. Jackson was named the 2009–10 Tennessee Mr. Basketball for Class AAA; he was also named a McDonald's High School All-American as well as a first-team \"Parade\" All-American. In the 2010 McDonald's All-American Game, Jackson recorded two points, two assists and one rebound in 12 minutes of playing time.\nCollege career.\nJackson struggled to adapt to the pace and size of college basketball in his freshman season and through the midpoint of his sophomore season despite his solid statistics – 9.9 points and 3.1 assists in 2010–11 followed by 11.0 points and 3.8 assists in 2011–12. The Tigers won the Conference USA tournament his freshman year, then won both the regular season and conference tournament championships in his sophomore campaign. Jackson was named the MVP for both the 2011 and the 2012 Conference tournaments.\nIn 2012–13, his junior season, Jackson averaged 13.6 points, 4.8 assists, 3.3 rebounds and 1.7 steals for a Memphis team that went undefeated in conference play (16–0), qualified for the 2013 NCAA tournament as the number six seed (advancing to the Round of 32) and finished with an overall record of 31–5. He surpassed the 1,000-point mark for his career, was an All-Conference First Team selection and was honored as the Conference USA Player of the Year.\nOn February 13, 2014, he was named one of the 30 finalists for Naismith College Player of the Year award.\nProfessional career.\nAfter going undrafted in the 2014 NBA draft, Jackson joined the Memphis Grizzlies for the 2014 NBA Summer League. On September 26, 2014, he signed with the Phoenix Suns. However, he was later waived by the Suns on October 14, 2014. On November 2, 2014, he was acquired by the Bakersfield Jam as an affiliate player. On April 16, 2015, he was named the D-League's Most Improved Player for the 2014–15 season after improving from 6.0 points per game during December to 17.7 points per game during March. On the season, he averaged 13.9 points, 3.5 rebounds, 4.9 assists and 1.5 steals in 38 games.\nIn July 2015, Jackson was selected with the 14th pick of the 2015 KBL draft by the Goyang Orion Orions, signing with them afterwards. As a rookie in the 2015–16 KBL season, Jackson mostly came off the bench behind another American player Aaron Haynes who is a veteran scorer in KBL. Initially, Jackson played limited minutes, but as the season continued, he began to see some more playing time. By the end of the season, he averaged 18.56 minutes a game (PPG 14.4, APG 4.4). His team advanced to the KBL finals in the playoffs against Jeonju KCC Egis (regular season champions), and won the championship.\nOn May 23, 2016, Jackson signed with Chinese club Luoyang Zhonghe for the 2016 NBL season. On August 16, 2016, Jackson signed with Israeli club Maccabi Rishon LeZion. He was released by Maccabi after appearing in only two games.\nOn February 27, 2017, Jackson signed with the Northern Arizona Suns of the NBA Development League."

The Gators competed in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Southeastern Conference (SEC). They were led by head coach Billy Donovan, and played their home games in the O'Connell Center on the university's Gainesville, Florida campus.\nThe Gators finished the SEC regular season with an 18–0 record in conference play, the first SEC team to ever accomplish the feat, after the SEC re-expanded to an 18-game regular season schedule prior to the 2012–13 season. In doing so, the Gators won their seventh SEC regular season championship, and their third in four seasons. The Gators beat the Kentucky Wildcats 61–60 to claim the fourth SEC Tournament championship title.\nBy claiming the SEC tournament, the Gators earned an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament, and were selected as the #1 overall seed, and were placed in the South Regional. The Gators defeated all of their first four opponents by at least 10 points and advanced to the Final Four as the only #1 seed remaining. At that point, the Gators had a school record winning streak of 30 wins, dating back to December 2, 2013, where the Gators lost in a tight game at UConn 64–65. The Gators' semifinal opponent was a rematch against UConn, who had won the East Regional. The Gators got off to a quick start; however, the Huskies were able to catch up and led at halftime. In the second half, the Gators fell farther behind, giving up numerous turnovers, and missing numerous field goals. The Gators eventually suffered only their third (and worst) loss of the season to eventual national champion UConn once again, 63–53, and ended the heavily favored Gators' hopes at earning a third national championship.\nTeam statistics.\nAs of April 5, 2014. &lt;br&gt;\n Indicates team leader in specific category.

        "text": "The 2030 FIFA World Cup will be the 24th FIFA World Cup, a quadrennial international football tournament contested by the men's national teams of the member associations of FIFA. The 2030 World Cup will mark the centennial World Cup competition. For the first time, three countries from two continents will host the competition, with Spain, Portugal, and Morocco as host nations. Additionally, Uruguay, Argentina, and Paraguay will commemorate the 100th anniversary of the FIFA World Cup, in particular the first World Cup in Uruguay. The first game, alongside a special centenary celebration, will be held in the Estadio Centenario in Montevideo, Uruguay. The second and third games will be held in Argentina and Paraguay, respectively. The rest of the games and the opening ceremony will be held in Morocco, Portugal, and Spain. This will be the first World Cup held in Africa since 2010, in South America since 2014, as well as in Europe since 2018.\nHost selection.\nFIFA launched the bidding process in 2022. As hosts of the 2022 and 2026 editions respectively, the 2030 FIFA World Cup cannot be hosted by a member of the Asian AFC or the North American CONCACAF.\nHosts are required to have at least fourteen all-seater stadiums with a capacity of 40,000, with a minimum of seven being pre-existing. The opening match and final must take place in an 80,000-seat stadium, while the semi-finals must take place in a 60,000-seat stadium. Hosts must also have at least 72 suitable training site options for team base camps, four suitable venue-specific training site options per stadium, in addition to two suitable referee base camp training site options, all with suitable accommodation. The FIFA Council also regulates requirements relating to broadcasting sites, competition-related event sites, as well as accommodation. In addition, sustainability, environmental protections and human rights will also be factors considered by the council, along with governmental support, the organisational model to be used, besides provisions for the establishment of a \"legacy fund\".\nTeams.\nQualification.\nAll six host nations will qualify for the World Cup.\nConcerns.\nThe 2030 FIFA World Cup has already been met with backlash from fans, football officials, and environmental groups with them noting the large distance between South America and Europe would require considerable plane travel, which would increase the carbon footprint and negate FIFA's carbon neutral plans. They have also noted the issues for fans of teams who would get drawn with Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay, as well as the short amount of rest for players once those teams travel back to the main hosts in Iberia and Morocco. Former FIFA president Sepp Blatter warned that the number of hosts that the 2030 FIFA World Cup has would cause the tournament to \"lose its identity\". Others have noted that with the FIFA rotation system, CONCACAF (which will host the 2026 FIFA World Cup), CONMEBOL, UEFA, and CAF would be unable to bid, leaving 2034 open to the AFC and OFC, which has led to accusations that FIFA selected the hosts to ensure that Saudi Arabia, an AFC member with major human rights controversies, would have their bid unopposed."

        "text": "The 2001 Wales rugby union tour of Japan was a series of matches played in June 2001 in Japan by the Wales national rugby union team. With their best players involved in the 2001 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to Australia, the squad featured a blend of youth and experience. Although they won just one of their non-test matches on tour, Wales won both tests against the Japan national team. \nResults.\n\"Scores and results list Wales' points tally first.\"\nWales v Barbarians.\nBefore embarking on their tour, Wales played an uncapped match against the Barbarians, the first match of three for the Barbarians on their own tour of Great Britain. Much of the discussion regarding Wales' team selection for the match centred around fly-half Gavin Henson, who at , would be the youngest Wales player to appear at the position since Llewellyn Lloyd in 1896. Henson ultimately started the game on the bench, as coach Graham Henry preferred Neil Jenkins, one of eight Wales players in the team who were due to join the British &amp; Irish Lions on their tour to Australia later in the summer. Shortly before the game, the Welsh Rugby Union decided to downgrade it from fully-capped to uncapped.\nThe Barbarians held a 14–7 lead at half-time, thanks to tries from Dan Luger and Joeli Vidiri, either side of one from Jenkins. Wales thought Shane Williams had levelled the scores with a try under the posts just before the break, but it was ruled out for a forward pass in the build-up. After the interval, Kevin Morgan scored a pair of tries for the home side, one converted by Jenkins and the other by Stephen Jones, to put them 21–14 up. Substitute winger Friedrich Lombard responded for the Barbarians, but Braam van Straaten missed the conversion to leave them two points behind. Williams did score a try shortly afterwards, with Jones converting to put Wales 28–19 up. The Barbarians' replacement hooker Naka Drotské cut the deficit to two points again with a converted try, but Craig Quinnell restored Wales' nine-point margin soon after. As the game entered the final minutes, Percy Montgomery scored a try for the Barbarians, again converted by Van Straaten, only for Stephen Jones to kick a penalty moments later, putting Wales five points up shortly before the 80-minute mark; however, in the third minute of injury time, Lombard scored his second try of the game to level the scores, and Van Straaten kicked the conversion to give the Barbarians a 40–38 win.\nSuntory v Wales.\nWales' opening tour match was against Japanese league champions Suntory, the first time a Japanese club side had faced a touring international team. Taking over as coach from Graham Henry, who was coaching the British &amp; Irish Lions in Australia, Lynn Howells named nine full internationals in the Wales team, including Stephen Jones, who was playing out of position at inside centre to accommodate Henson at fly-half. Jones captained the team in the absence of tour captain Andy Moore, who was rested. Cardiff flanker Robin Sowden-Taylor was picked to start despite not having played a senior match at club level; meanwhile, lock Craig Quinnell was picked to start the match, but he pulled out due to injury and was replaced by Adam Jones. Despite wing Craig Morgan suffering a knee injury in the 17th minute that ultimately ruled him out of the rest of the tour, Wales held a 21–10 lead at half-time; however, four second-half tries from Suntory, including a last-minute winner, saw them come from behind to claim a 45–41 victory. Howells put the defeat down to fatigue brought about by the high temperatures, and a lack of control once they took a big lead. Centre Jamie Robinson also suffered an injury during the match, but it was deemed minor and he remained on tour.\nJapan Select XV v Wales.\nLynn Howells changed all 15 players in his starting line-up for the match against the Japan Select XV at Nagai Stadium in Osaka, and hailed the experience brought by the additions of centre Allan Bateman and lock Andy Moore for a match against a side including several foreign players; however, Bateman suffered an early ankle injury and although he was able to continue until half-time, he was taken off during the break and ultimately ruled out of the rest of the tour. The Japan Select XV scored the first try of the game, Jun Akune putting them 7–0 up after the conversion by Tanaka. Wales equalised through Adrian Durston's try, converted by Lee Jarvis, but a penalty from Tanaka put the Japan Select XV back in front. Jarvis put Wales 13–10 up as the interval approached, thanks to a pair of penalties, but a try from Tomokazu Yamauchi on the stroke of half-time put the home side 15–13 up at the change of ends. Within two minutes of the restart, Shane Williams gave Wales the lead again, his try again converted by Jarvis, who added a penalty shortly after. Williams then scored his second try of the match, just over 10 minutes into the second half, and Jarvis extended the margin to 15 points with the conversion. He scored a fourth penalty as the match entered the final 10 minutes to make the score 33–15, but the Japan Select XV scored a consolation try – a second for Yamauchi – to make the final score 33–22.\nFirst test: Japan v Wales.\nWales' first test against Japan was their 500th international match. Coach Lyn Howells selected a young team with an average age of 24, giving debuts to centre Adrian Durston and back rowers Andy Lloyd and Gavin Thomas; full-back Kevin Morgan made his first international appearance for more than three years, and Stephen Jones made his first appearance of the tour at fly-half. Meanwhile, Japan had to play an under-strength team due to a dispute between the Japan Rugby Union and some of their clubs. Gareth Thomas scored the opening try for Wales after just four minutes, and Mark Jones crossed soon after. Kevin Morgan added another try, followed by scores from Lloyd and Shane Williams (2) before Morgan had his second of the game, and Durston scored Wales' eighth of the game before the end of the first half. Japan scored two tries in the second half, but they proved mere consolation as Williams added to his first-half double with two more, equalling the national record for the most tries by an individual in a single game. Captain Andy Moore came off with a strained groin before the end of the first half, but he praised the team's performance, particularly in the first half.\nPacific Barbarians v Wales.\nWales made 14 changes from the team that beat Japan three days earlier; Mark Jones was the only survivor, switching from the right wing to the left. The inexperienced side conceded two tries in the first seven minutes, but a try from Mark Jones helped them recover to trail 17–16 at half-time; however, Wales were kept scoreless in the second half. Captain Chris Stephens was sin-binned for throwing a punch, and the Pacific Barbarians scored two more tries, as well as three more penalties, giving them a 36–16 win. Towards the end of the game, Mark Jones was stretchered off with knee ligament damage, putting an end to his tour. Stephens was criticised after the game for picking up a yellow card for punching; his selection as captain had already come under scrutiny before the game, having been fined £2,000 for punching Cross Keys player Ioan Bebb in the first game of the previous season, causing an eye injury that ended Bebb's career.\nSecond test: Japan v Wales.\nDespite his yellow card in the midweek match against the Pacific Barbarians, Chris Stephens was named on the bench for the second test against Japan. In the starting line-up, Wales made two changes from the first test; Tom Shanklin was named on the wing to make his test debut in place of the injured Mark Jones, while Nathan Budgett was named in the back row in place of Andy Lloyd. Wales held a 19–3 lead after half an hour, thanks to a try from Gavin Thomas and two from Gareth Thomas, but two quick tries and a penalty for Japan put the home side 20–19 up at half-time. After the break, Wales scored four tries in the first 20 minutes; Gavin Thomas opened the scoring with his second try of the game, before Shane Williams scored his seventh try of the tour, followed by two in two minutes from debutant Shanklin. Scrum-half Dwayne Peel came on to make his test debut in the 73rd minute, shortly before Gareth Thomas completed his hat-trick. Following a consolation score from Hirotoki Onozawa, fellow substitute Jamie Robinson scored another try with the final play of the game, giving Wales a 53–30 win and a 2–0 victory in the test series."

It was the 8th Italian Grand Prix. This race was also the VI Grand Prix d'Europe.\nThis race was marred by the death of at least 22 spectators as well as driver Emilio Materassi on lap 17, when Materassi lost control of his car on the main straight at over 200 km/h while trying to overtake Giulio Foresti. The car swerved to the left of the track, bounced over a three-meter deep and four-meter wide protection ditch and a fence and crashed into the grandstand, killing him along with 22 spectators. Other sources have stated that 27 spectators were killed overall, but this is unconfirmed.\nBy either estimation this is the worst accident, with respect to the number of lives lost, to occur at a Grand Prix, and the second-deadliest in motor racing history, being surpassed by the 1955 Le Mans disaster. As a result the Italian Grand Prix was to not be held until 1931.\nClassification.\nFastest Lap: Luigi Arcangeli, 3m37.4 (165.59 km/h)"

        "text": "Keith Davis (21 May 1930 – 2 March 2019) was a New Zealand rugby union player who played for both New Zealand and New Zealand Māori. He played for Auckland, and won the Ranfurly Shield in his first ever provincial game. After gaining All Blacks selection in 1952, Davis toured with the team to Europe and North America in 1953–54. He played extensively for New Zealand Māori between 1952 and his retirement in 1959; his time with the team included matches against both South Africa and the British Lions. Davis was awarded the Tom French Cup for Māori player of the year in 1952, 1953 and 1954.\nEarly career.\nKeith Davis was born in Whakatane and educated at Sacred Heart College in Auckland, where he played for the first XV from 1947 to 1949. He was half-back, and was selected for Auckland in 1952 after making a number of appearances for the Auckland B side in 1951 and early 1952. Davis' first provincial game was a Ranfurly Shield challenge against Waikato that Auckland won 9–0 to raise the Shield. The side's first defence was against Waikato two weeks later; with Waikato avenging their loss to regain the Shield following a 6–3 victory. Davis was selected for the New Zealand Māori in early 1952, and played with them during their internal-tour of New Zealand. He was subsequently selected for the New Zealand national side—the All Blacks—later that year. He made his Test debut against Australia on 13 September 1952, a match that the All Blacks won 15–8. At the conclusion of the 1952 season he was awarded the Tom French Cup for Māori player of the year.\n1953–54 European tour.\nIn 1953 Davis was selected as one of the half-backs for the All Blacks' tour of Europe and North America. He was preferred over his cousin, Vincent Bevan, as the starting half-back for the All Blacks' five Tests. Of the five Test matches—against England, France, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales—the All Blacks won three; their two losses coming to France and Wales. Davis also played in the All Blacks last match of the British and Irish leg of their tour—against Barbarian F.C. in Cardiff. The All Blacks were behind 5–3 at the end of the first half, but after a Davis try early in the second half to give them a 6–3 lead, before a conversion by Ron Jarden. The All Blacks scored a further three tries, with the final one set up by Davis, to eventually win 19–5. He was All Black number 546.\nNew Zealand Māori and later career.\nAfter returning from tour, Davis was selected to captain the New Zealand Māori tour of Fiji in 1954. Before leaving for Fiji, the team played six matches against provincial teams in New Zealand. The eight match tour of Fiji included three matches against Fiji; the team won seven of their matches, with the one loss to Fiji in Lautoka.\nThe following year Davis was recalled for one Test match against Australia that the All Blacks won 8–0. He did not play any of the All Blacks' matches against the 1956 Springboks, but was a reserve in two Tests of the series. The most important New Zealand Māori match of the season was against the touring Springboks—Davis was selected at half-back. The match was lost 37–0, and has been tainted by accusations that Ernest Corbett, the Māori Affairs Minister at the time, had asked the New Zealanders to lose the match. However some members of the Māori side have disputed that Corbett even spoke to their team. The match was described by historian Lindsay Knight as \"one of the worst experiences in his [Davis's] career\".\nDavis toured with the Māori to Australia in 1958, and played all three \"Test\" matches against Australia. Australia won the first Test, but the second Test resulted in a 3–3 draw. However the Māori recovered to win the final Test 13–6 to draw the series. On returning to New Zealand, Davis was selected for the All Blacks for the last time. He played in three Tests against the touring Australians; the series was won by the All Blacks two Tests to one. He was not selected for the All Blacks again, and finished his career with 25 games for the side, including 10 Tests.\n1959 was Davis' final season of first-class rugby. He finished his career for Auckland, and played for the Māori against the touring British Lions. The New Zealanders lost the game 12–6, but did prevent the Lions from scoring any tries—the only time this was achieved on tour. After retiring from rugby Davis continued to be involved as a coach and selector with both his club side Marist, and also the Māori All Blacks in the 1960s. He was eventually awarded his Test cap at a capping ceremony in 2010, 58 years after first playing for the All Blacks.\nDavis died on 2 March 2019."

        "text": "Rugby union is a mostly amateur sport within the Northern Territory in Australia. The game is run by the Northern Territory Rugby Union, composed of representatives from clubs, regional rugby unions, referees, and affiliated bodies for schools and junior rugby.\nThere is no professional rugby team based in NT but the annual Hottest 7s tournament held in Darwin draws teams from around Australia and overseas, and awards prize money to the winners.\nHistory of rugby union in the Northern Territory.\nRugby was the second football after soccer played in the Territory. The first match was played in Darwin between Town and Vestees, originally planned for New Year's Day 1916, it was postponed after original plans to involve sailors from a visiting warship fell through, Vestey's won 9 to Darwin's 3 on Monday 24 January. However, after the initial fanfare, the NT Football Association (Australian rules football) commenced a month later and its popular weekly matches took the limelight off rugby for over half a century.\nEfforts were made after World War I to organise matches against visiting warships in the 1920s however the arrival of rugby league in the 1920s was a further setback to organised rugby.\nA rugby union competition in Darwin was started in the reconstruction phase following Cyclone Tracy. A New Zealander named David Cooper advertised for other interested players which led to the founding of the Northern Territory Rugby Union in 1975. The first Darwin club rugby competition match was played on 2 October 1976 at Alawa Oval between the South Darwin Rabbitohs and the RSL Dragons (now the Darwin Dragons).\nFrom 1983 onward, the Bushratz RUFC from Jabiru played in the Darwin 2nd grade competition, and also briefly in the Katherine competition in 2009. However, due to a shortage of player numbers (as of 2013), the club no longer takes part in these competitions.\nIn 1984, the Alice Springs club competition was started by the Central Australian Rugby Union. The Katherine club competition was established by the Katherine Rugby Union in 1987. Katherine also later briefly fielded a composite team in the Darwin competition, but found the logistics associated with the travel distance difficult to sustain.\nIn 1989, the inaugural Territory 7s tournament was held in Darwin and won by Fijian team Duavata. The annual tournament was renamed the Hottest 7s in 2005, and the organizers in 2013 claimed it was the richest rugby sevens tournament in the Southern Hemisphere with a prize pool of $65,000.\nThe East Arnhem Rugby Union was created in Nhulunbuy in 2004, with a junior rugby competition played during the Dry Season between April and August. Teams from East Arnhem (initially under the name of Gove Rugby) have regularly entered tournaments such as the Darwin Hottest 7s and Singapore CC 7s.\nClub competitions.\nDarwin.\nThe Darwin club rugby competition runs from March to September since switching from Wet Season to Dry Season in 2003, and is administered by the Northern Territory Rugby Union. There are six clubs based in the Darwin metropolitan area that have 1st and 2nd grade open teams, and juniors from under 7 to under 17.Some clubs also have a women's team.\nAlice Springs.\nThe Alice Springs club rugby competition runs over the summer from November to April and is administered by the Central Australian Rugby Union. There are four clubs (as of 2013) with one open grade team each:\nKatherine.\nThe Katherine club rugby competition runs over the Wet Season from October to April and is administered by the Katherine Rugby Union. There are four clubs (as of 2013) with one open grade team each:\nRepresentative teams.\nSenior and junior representative teams are selected from players within the Northern Territory each year to compete against representative rugby teams from other Australian states and territories. The senior men's team is known as the Mosquitoes and the senior women's team is known as the Goannas. Team colours are ochre, black and white.\nThe Mosquitoes competed in the Australian Rugby Shield prior to the cancellation of the competition after the 2008 season.\nFrom 2018 an additional competition was formed for teams from so-called \"Minor States\", called the Emerging States Championship, featuring the Mosquitoes, Adelaide Black Falcons, Victoria Country Barbarians and the Tasmania Jack Jumpers. The first Competition was held in Adelaide in September 2018, and the Black Falcons were the inaugural winners."

        "text": "James Clare (born 13 April 1991) is an English former professional rugby league footballer who played as a er or in the Super League and the RFL Championship in the 2010s and 2020s.\nClare spent the majority of his career with the Castleford Tigers (Heritage № 926) in the Super League across two spells, making over 100 appearances and scoring over 50 tries. He played two seasons for the Bradford Bulls in the Championship, and also represented the Leigh Centurions in the Super League. He spent time on loan or dual registration with Doncaster, Halifax and the York City Knights in the Championship, and at the York City Knights in League 1.\nBackground.\nClare was born in Castleford, West Yorkshire, England.\nHaving come through the Castleford Tigers academy system, Clare earned his first full-time contract prior to the 2012 season.\nPlaying career.\nCastleford Tigers.\nClare made his first team début for the Castleford Tigers on 16 March 2012 away to the Huddersfield Giants. He made 2 further appearances that season, and scored his first try on 8 July 2012 at home to the Huddersfield Giants.\nIn June 2013, Clare signed a two-year contract extension with the Tigers. On 8 September 2013, Clare scored 4 tries in Castleford's visit to local rivals Wakefield Trinity Wildcats on the final day of the season. In 2013, he made 9 appearances and scored 8 tries.\nClare was allocated squad number 24 prior to the 2014 season. He made 17 appearances and scored 11 tries for Castleford as the team finished 4th in Super League and reached the Challenge Cup final.\nClare was given squad number 2 for 2015, following the retirement of Kirk Dixon, after his impressive performances in 2014 established him in the first team. Despite this, Clare said, \"The hard work starts now in my eyes. The number will mean nothing if you don't train as hard as you can or perform on the day\". He made 9 appearances and scored 4 tries for the Tigers, as well as playing for the York City Knights on dual registration, before his move to the Bradford Bulls was announced on 22 July. \nDoncaster (loan).\nClare joined newly-promoted Championship side Doncaster for the 2013 season. He was to be on a 24 hour call back for parent club Castleford after 28 days. Clare made 4 appearances and scored 1 try for the club across February and March before returning to the Tigers.\nYork City Knights (dual registration).\nIn 2015, Clare played for the York City Knights in League 1 through their dual registration arrangement with Castleford. The Tigers' head coach Daryl Powell said he was \"looking for him to build some confidence\" through spending time at York. Clare made 7 appearances and scored 9 tries for the Knights.\nBradford Bulls.\nClare signed for Championship side the Bradford Bulls in July, towards the end of the 2015 season. He signed a deal until the end of the 2016 season. \nIn the 2015 Season, Clare featured in Round 23 (Halifax). Clare played in Qualifier 1 (Sheffield Eagles) to Qualifier 4 (Widnes Vikings) then in Qualifier 6 (Leigh Centurions) to Qualifier 7 (Halifax). He scored against the Sheffield Eagles (1 try), the Wakefield Trinity Wildcats (1 try) and Salford Red Devils (1 try).\nIn the 2016 Season, Clare featured in the pre-season friendlies against the Leeds Rhinos and the Castleford Tigers. He scored against Castleford Tigers (1 try). He featured in Round 1 (Featherstone Rovers) to Round 22 (Oldham). Clare played in the Challenge Cup in the 4th Round (Dewsbury Rams). He scored against Whitehaven (2 tries), the Swinton Lions (3 tries), the Leigh Centurions (3 tries), the London Broncos (1 try), Halifax (1 try), the Sheffield Eagles (1 try), the Dewsbury Rams (1 try), Workington Town (2 tries), Oldham (2 tries) and the Batley Bulldogs (2 tries). In June, midway through the season, Clare signed a contract extension keeping him at Bradford until 2018. \nClare later recalled that, after Bradford were placed in administration in November 2016, he \"seriously considered quitting the game for good\", saying, \"The amount of emotional stress you go through takes its toll on you physically in the end.\" In January 2017, following the Bradford Bulls' liquidation, Clare became a free agent.\nLeigh Centurions.\nOn 5 January 2017, it was announced that Clare had signed a 2-year deal with the newly-promoted Leigh Centurions. Leigh head coach Neil Jukes said: \"James is someone we've admired and monitored for some while now, especially after his performance in our epic draw at Bradford last year.\" He was allocated shirt number 28, due to arriving after the squad numbers were revealed. \nUnfortunately, Clare suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury in Leigh's pre-season win over the Dewsbury Rams on 29 January 2017. This ruled him out for most of the upcoming season. He made his first appearance for the Centurions on 3 September against the Widnes Vikings in the fourth round of the Qualifiers, scoring a try. He played the remainder of the season, making 5 appearances and scoring 6 tries. Leigh were defeated by the Catalans Dragons in the 2017 Million Pound Game, resulting in their relegation to the Championship and meaning all contracts became null and void, leaving other clubs free to approach Clare.\nCastleford Tigers.\nIn December 2017, Clare rejoined his hometown club Castleford Tigers on a one-year deal for the 2018 season, with an option to extend the deal by a further year. He said, \"Cas are the club that I've supported for my entire life so to be back here and to have another chance to pull on this famous shirt is great,\" and added, \"I pushed for the move as much as I could because I knew I always wanted to come back here.\"\nIn his first season back at Castleford, Clare wore the number 26. After beginning the season at Halifax on dual registration, he played his first game since returning against the Salford Red Devils on 11 March, scoring a try. He was kept out for a number of months mid-season due to a tibial plateau fracture. In July, he extended his contract until the end of the 2020 season. Despite his injury - and the fierce competition for places on Castleford's wings from Greg Eden, Greg Minikin and Jy Hitchcox - he made 18 appearances and scored 8 tries.\nThe 2019 campaign proved to be Clare's most prolific season yet in the Super League. He regained squad number 2, claiming the right-wing berth as his own following Greg Minikin's move to centre. He made 30 appearances, playing in all but 2 of Castleford's matches, and scored 16 tries, topping the club's try-scoring charts. This included his second hat-trick for the Tigers on 12 July - this was his first Castleford treble since 2013 and it occurred, again, in a visit to local rivals Wakefield. Clare also finished the season as the runner up for the club's Players' Player of the Year award.\nFollowing the arrival of Sosaia Feki and Derrell Olpherts at Castleford for 2020, Clare was given squad number 21. He made a strong start to the campaign and had made 5 appearances and scored 4 tries when the season was suspended in March. Upon the season's resumption, injuries to teammates saw Clare fill in at fullback and centre. In December 2020, it was announced that Clare had signed a two-year extension with Castleford, with head coach Daryl Powell touting him as the team's \"most improved player\" and praising his hard work and commitment.\nPrior to the 2021 season, Clare was forced to undergo knee surgery due to an injury sustained during the previous campaign. This caused him to miss the start of the year, and he was limited to 7 appearances throughout the season. First-team opportunities proved harder to come by for Clare in 2022 under Lee Radford, making 3 appearances, though he was a part of the coaching staff for the club's academy. On 26 August 2022, Castleford confirmed that Clare would leave the club at the end of the season upon the expiry of his contract. Across both stints with Castleford, Clare made 108 appearances and scored 54 tries.\nHalifax (dual registration).\nIn February 2018, Clare played for Championship side Halifax through their dual registration agreement with Castleford. He made 3 appearances.\nYork City Knights (loan).\nIn February 2022, Clare joined Championship team York on a one-month loan deal. However, he only made one appearance for the Knights after receiving a three-match ban for punching in a pre-season friendly for Castleford.\nRetirement.\nClare retired from professional rugby league following the conclusion of the 2022 season. He had been offered a new contract by Castleford alongside a foundation coaching role but instead opted to focus on his own coaching business, the Elite Rugby Academy, for children aged 4 to 14. He began work in secondary education in late 2022 as a PLC co-ordinator in a Pontefract school. He has proved popular with all the students and continues to promote rugby league in school."

It began on 13 September 2014 at Beijing in China and finished on 28 June 2015 in London after eleven races. Nelson Piquet Jr. came first in the overall standings, and so became the first ever Formula E champion.\nThe car.\nFor the first season, all teams were supplied an electric racing car built by Spark Racing Technology, called the Spark-Renault SRT 01E. The chassis was designed by Dallara, with an electric motor developed by McLaren (the same as that used in its P1 supercar), a battery system created by Williams Grand Prix Engineering and a Hewland five-speed gearbox. Michelin were the official tyre supplier. 42 electric cars were ordered by the FIA.\nTeams and drivers.\nFor the 2014–15 season, 10 teams contested the series. Each team fielded two drivers; each driver had two cars. That meant that 40 cars were required by the teams. All teams were ostensibly based at the sport's technical headquarters at the Donington Park race circuit, in the United Kingdom, although some teams had a greater presence there than others. Formula E organiser FEH itself has offices there for administration and operations staff.\nAll ten teams were confirmed to race in April 2014. However, in June 2014, Drayson Racing pulled out of the championship, with its entry taken by Trulli, a new team formed by former Formula One driver Jarno Trulli. Drayson entered the team in a supply and sponsorship arrangement, to be its principal technology partner.\nCalendar.\nThe season included 11 races, held between September 2014 and June 2015. The initial calendar had ten races and was approved by the FIA World Motor Sport Council in December 2013. However, in April 2014, changes were made to the calendar including dropping Rio de Janeiro, which had previously replaced Hong Kong, and moving the Los Angeles round to 4 April. On 22 May 2014, Los Angeles County officials announced that their race would take place away on a modified version of the Long Beach street circuit. On 3 February 2015, it was revealed that a race would be held in Moscow on 6 June to restore the calendar to its original schedule of ten races. On 19 February 2015, it was announced that the final round in London would be a double-header, expanding the calendar to eleven races.\nChampionship standings.\nChampionship points were awarded as follows:\nEach driver's lowest-scoring round was dropped from their total; however, rounds where the driver was excluded from the race could not be dropped.\nDrivers' Championship.\n† – Drivers did not finish the race, but were classified as they completed more than 90% of the race distance.\nTeams' Championship.\nThe points system was the same as the Drivers' Championship, except that all rounds counted towards the total.\n† – Drivers did not finish the race, but were classified as they completed more than 90% of the race distance."

        "text": "Mark Montgomery (born August 30, 1990) is a minor league baseball pitcher who is a free agent.\nA native of Williamsburg, Virginia, Montgomery attended Bruton High School, and was drafted by the Yankees out of Longwood University in the 11th round of the 2011 MLB draft. He won the Yankees' Kevin Lawn Award for 2012.\nCareer.\nNew York Yankees.\nMontgomery began his career with the Low–A Staten Island Yankees of the New York–Penn League in 2011, where he pitched four games before being promoted to the Single–A Charleston RiverDogs for the rest of the year. The day after his promotion, Montgomery record five strikeouts in one inning. Between the two teams, he had a 1.91 ERA, 51 strikeouts, 13 walks, and 15 saves in 26 games with 28.1 innings pitched, with no win-loss record.\nIn 2012, Montgomery started the season with the Yankees' High–A affiliate, the Tampa Yankees, before earning a promotion to the Trenton Thunder, the organization's Double-A affiliate. He was selected as a Florida State League Mid-Season All-Star. Between the two levels, Montgomery went 7-2 with a stellar 1.54 ERA in 46 games/64.1 innings pitched with 99 strikeouts, 22 walks, and 15 saves once again. He also pitched in the Arizona Fall League that year, appearing in the Rising Stars game and being named to the AFL All-Prospect Team.\nBefore the 2013 season, Baseball Prospectus ranked Montgomery the Yankees' 9th best prospect. MLB.com places him as the team's 8th best prospect. He started the year with the Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders, but dealt with a loss in velocity that the organization blamed on a poor conditioning regimen in the offseason. He dealt with shoulder fatigue and had three different stints on the disabled list that year. For the season, his ERA regressed to 3.38 in 45.1 innings over 29 games (including four games with the GCL Yankees). He still struck out 59 batters, but walked 25 while dealing with command issues.\nDespite being healthy again in 2014, Montgomery's velocity didn't return and he relied heavily on his slider. He was ultimately demoted to Double-A when the Yankees signed Heath Bell to a minor league deal in June. For the season between the two teams, he held a 2-1 record, 2.10 ERA (including a microscopic 0.81 for Trenton), 51 strikeouts, 26 walks, and 4 saves in 51.1 innings pitched. \nMontgomery was not invited to big league camp in 2015 and began the season in Double-A Trenton. He allowed two runs and struck out 13 in 12 innings, seeing his velocity return to the low 90s. He earned a promotion back to Scranton in May but spent the season bouncing between the two levels. Overall, he accumulated a 2.66 ERA, 17 saves, 53 strikeouts, and 17 walks in 50.2 innings. He pitched in the Venezuelan Winter League in the offseason. \nMontgomery was added to big league camp in 2016. He once again spent the season split between Trenton and Scranton, pitching to a 2.56 ERA, striking out 63 and walking 22 in 45.2 innings. He also pitched for Scranton in the International League championship series. The Yankees released him on March 31, 2017.\nSt. Louis Cardinals.\nMontgomery then signed a minor league contract with the St. Louis Cardinals organization. In 46 games for the Triple–A Memphis Redbirds, he registered a 5–1 record and 2.43 ERA with 73 strikeouts and 5 saves in innings pitched. He elected free agency following the season on November 6.\nDetroit Tigers.\nHe signed a minor league contract with the Detroit Tigers on November 25, 2017. The deal included an invitation to the Tigers' 2018 spring training camp. Montgomery was assigned to the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens, where he made 12 appearances with a 1.98 ERA in innings pitched. He was released on July 8, 2018, reportedly after suffering a potentially season-ending elbow injury.\nBoston Red Sox.\nOn July 20, 2018, Montgomery signed with the Boston Red Sox, in a minor league deal to run through the 2019 season. In August, Montgomery pitched for the Gulf Coast League Red Sox and the High–A Salem Red Sox on rehabilitation assignments, making two relief appearances with each team and allowing a total of four earned runs in innings pitched.\nMontgomery started the 2019 season on the injured list with the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox. He was released from the Red Sox organization on May 16, 2019."

        "text": "The Royal Dutch Swimming Federation (, “KNZB”) is the official governing body for swimming, in the Netherlands. The federation overlooks several other sports including competition swimming, open water swimming, water polo, diving and synchronized swimming. The federation is based in Nieuwegein and affiliated with the national sports body NOC*NSF. The responsibility of the KNZB is to organize and track various events. When a new organization from one of the water sports joins the KNZB they can participate in the competitions governed by the KNZB. They will then be placed on a ranking list.\nHistory.\nThe KNZB was founded on August 14, 1888 by four collaborating swim organizations. At this time the federations responsibility covered only five swim clubs \nIn 1888 the federation was named Nederlandse Zwem Bond (“NZB” English: Dutch Swimming Federation). In 1933, federation was renamed to the KNZB gaining the word Koninklijk (Royal in Dutch). In 1909 the KNZB joined the world swimming governing body, FINA which was established one year earlier.\nCompetition Swimming.\nCompetition swimming is considered a top sport in the Netherlands where swimmers such as Pieter van den Hoogenband, Inge de Bruijn, and Ranomi Kromowidjojo have brought home Olympic success. All Dutch swimming records are ratified by the KNZB. Virtually all swim clubs of the Netherlands are member of the KNZB. Membership benefits include the right to participate in competitions, discounts to attend courses and liability insurance.\nCompetitions.\nThere are two national competitions that the KNZB governs.

The competition promotes swimmers to practice longer distances. Simplified regulations for the individual makes the competition more attractive.\nOfficials.\nIn order to keep the games fair, all judges are trained under the material of the KNZB. This system uses a ladder style chart for grading officials. Where officials must meet certain requirements before they can move to the next level.\nWater Polo.\nAll water polo games that are associated with the KNZB are eligible to partake in the national league games. The league games determine the ranking of the club.\nDiving.\nThe KNZB currently has three competitions set up for diving, in which are: \nThis competition is classified as the qualification NK-Al. \nThis competition is classified as the qualification NJK.

        "text": "The 2014 Survivor Series was the 28th annual Survivor Series professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event produced by WWE. It took place on November 23, 2014, at the Scottrade Center in St. Louis, Missouri, and was the first Survivor Series event to livestream on the WWE Network, which launched in February. The event was notable for the WWE debut appearance of former World Championship Wrestling (WCW) wrestler Sting and also the first Survivor Series since 2001 to not feature a world championship match.\nEight matches were contested at the event, including two on the Kickoff pre-show. The main event saw Team Cena (John Cena, Dolph Ziggler, Erick Rowan, Big Show, and Ryback) defeat Team Authority (Seth Rollins, Kane, Luke Harper, Mark Henry, and Rusev) in a 5-on-5 Survivor Series elimination match, with Ziggler emerging the lone survivor. Ziggler was the second wrestler to survive a 3-on-1 situation in a Survivor Series elimination match, eliminating Kane, Harper, and Rollins. The only other person to survive a 3-on-1 situation was Ric Flair at the 2006 event. The event had 100,000 buys (excluding WWE Network views), down from the previous year's 177,000 buys.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSurvivor Series is an annual gimmick pay-per-view (PPV) produced every November by WWE since 1987. The second longest running pay-per-view event in history (behind WWE's WrestleMania), it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and SummerSlam, collectively referred to as the \"Big Four\". The event is traditionally characterized by having Survivor Series matches, which are tag team elimination matches that typically pits teams of four or five wrestlers against each other. The 2014 event was the 28th Survivor Series and was scheduled to be held on November 23, 2014, at the Scottrade Center in St. Louis, Missouri. In addition to airing on traditional pay-per-view, it was the first Survivor Series to livestream on the WWE Network, which launched in February.\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised eight matches, including two on the Kickoff pre-show, that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\".\nOn the October 27 episode of \"Raw\", after John Cena, the #1 contender for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, rejected an offer to join The Authority, Triple H scheduled a traditional Survivor Series tag team elimination match, with a team representing The Authority facing a team captained by Cena. Later that night, it was hinted that Intercontinental Champion Dolph Ziggler had joined Team Cena; both Cena and Ziggler saved each other from post-match attacks. The next week on \"Raw\", Vince McMahon announced that if Team Authority loses at Survivor Series, The Authority would be out of power (Triple H would be fired as COO, Kane would be fired as Director of Operations, and Stephanie McMahon would no longer be a Principal Owner of WWE). Seth Rollins, Kane and Randy Orton joined Team Authority with Rollins as captain, while Ziggler joined Team Cena. Later that night, Orton was ejected by The Authority after he attacked members of The Authority, and turned face in the process for the first time since 2013. The next week on \"Raw\", Rusev joined Team Authority after The Authority helped him retain the United States Championship from Sheamus. Sheamus joined Team Cena along with Big Show and Jack Swagger, while Mark Henry and Ryback joined Team Authority. But, by the end of the night, Swagger dropped out of Team Cena after Rollins injured him, while Ryback attacked and left Team Authority after Kane interfered in his main-event match against Cena. Luke Harper applied to join Team Authority by attacking Ziggler. The next week on \"Raw\", Harper was confirmed as the final member of Team Authority. While Cena was scouting Ryback to fill out his team, team Authority attacked the rest of Team Cena, which played a part in Ziggler losing his Intercontinental Championship to Harper, and Sheamus dropping out of Team Cena after Mark Henry injured him. Later that night, Erick Rowan and Ryback joined Team Cena. On the November 21 episode of \"SmackDown\", in response to comments made by Cena stating that he felt responsible for his team, Triple H announced that if Team Cena lost, all of Team Cena, except Cena himself, would be fired. Later that night, with Cena absent, Team Authority and a chair-wielding Triple H attacked the rest of Team Cena.\nOn the October 31 episode of \"SmackDown\", Nikki Bella won a Battle Royal to face AJ Lee for the WWE Divas Championship. On November 10, WWE.com announced that AJ Lee would defend the title against Nikki at Survivor Series.\nAt Hell in a Cell, Bray Wyatt attacked Dean Ambrose during his Hell in a Cell match against Seth Rollins. On the November 10 episode of \"Raw\", it was announced that Ambrose would face Wyatt at Survivor Series.\nOn November 17, it was announced on WWE.com that Gold and Stardust would defend the WWE Tag Team Championship against The Miz and Damien Mizdow, The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso), and Los Matadores (Diego and Fernando) (with El Torito) in a fatal four-way tag team match at Survivor Series.\nOn November 17, it was announced on WWE.com that the Survivor Series kickoff show would feature the return of Bad News Barrett from injury and Fandango, accompanied by Rosa Mendes, against an unknown opponent.\nOn November 18, it was announced on WWE.com that Alicia Fox, Natalya, Emma, and Naomi would face Paige, Cameron, Layla, and Summer Rae in a Survivor Series elimination tag team match at Survivor Series.\nEvent.\nPre-show.\nThe analysis team was hosted by Renee Young and consisted of Alex Riley, Booker T, and special guest Paul Heyman.\nDuring the Survivor Series Kickoff pre-show, Fandango faced Justin Gabriel. Fandango executed \"The Last Dance\" to win the match.\nLater, Jack Swagger faced Cesaro. Swagger forced Cesaro to submit to the \"Patriot Lock\" to win the match.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe event began with Mr. McMahon calling The Authority and John Cena to the ring. He added the stipulation, that should Team Authority lose, the only person who can bring The Authority back to power would be Cena himself. Cena then responded by saying \"there is no chance in hell\" he would bring The Authority back to power.\nThe first match saw Gold and Stardust defend the Tag Team Championship against The Miz and Damien Mizdow, The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso), and Los Matadores. After Goldust was incapacitated by a \"Samoan Splash\" from an Uso, Mizdow stole the pin to win the titles for his team.\nNext, Team Natalya (Alicia Fox, Emma, Naomi, and Natalya) faced Team Paige (Paige, Cameron, Layla, and Summer Rae) in a traditional 4-on-4 Survivor Series elimination tag team match. Cameron was eliminated by Naomi after Naomi pinned her with a bridging rolling reverse cradle pin. Layla was eliminated by Fox after a tilt-a-whirl backbreaker. Summer Rae was eliminated after Emma forced her to submit to the \"Emma Lock\". Paige was eliminated by Naomi after a handstand modified headscissors driver.\nAfter that, Dean Ambrose faced Bray Wyatt. Ambrose was disqualified after he hit Wyatt with a chair. After the match, Ambrose attacked Wyatt with \"Dirty Deeds\" on the chair, a diving elbow drop through a table and buried Wyatt underneath a table and chairs and climbed a ladder. Later in the event, it was announced that Wyatt would face Ambrose in a tables, ladders, and chairs match at .\nIn the fourth match, Adam Rose and The Bunny faced Slater-Gator (Heath Slater and Titus O'Neil). The Bunny executed a missile dropkick on Slater to win the match.\nNext, Michael Cole, Jerry Lawler, and John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield interviewed Roman Reigns via satellite, who announced he would return in late December.\nIn the fifth match, AJ Lee defended the Divas Championship against Nikki Bella. After Brie Bella kissed AJ, Nikki executed the \"Rack Attack\" on AJ to win the title.\nMain event.\nIn the main event, Team Cena (John Cena, Dolph Ziggler, Big Show, Erick Rowan, and Ryback) faced Team Authority (Seth Rollins, Kane, Mark Henry, Rusev, and Luke Harper) (with Triple H, Stephanie McMahon, Jamie Noble, Joey Mercury, and Lana) in a traditional 5-on-5 Survivor Series elimination tag team match. Henry was the first man eliminated by Big Show after a \"Knockout Punch\". Ryback was eliminated by Rusev after a \"Curb Stomp\" from Rollins and a jumping savate kick. Rusev tried to put Ziggler through a broadcast table with a splash but missed, fell through the table and was counted out. Rowan was eliminated by Harper after a discus clothesline. Cena was eliminated by Rollins after a \"Knockout Punch\" from Big Show, who betrayed Team Cena by shaking Triple H's hand and walking out on the match, eliminating himself by countout and turning heel. Ziggler eliminated Kane with a \"Zig Zag\" and Harper with a schoolboy. Ziggler executed a \"Zig Zag\" on Rollins but Triple H pulled the referee out of the ring. The Authority attacked Ziggler, but he fought them off and executed a second \"Zig Zag\" on Rollins as another referee came out to the ring. Triple H attacked the other referee and attacked Ziggler, executing a \"Pedigree\" on him. He called out Scott Armstrong to count the pin, but WCW wrestler Sting appeared, making his WWE debut. Sting knocked out Armstrong and had a staredown with Triple H. Sting then executed a \"Scorpion Death Drop\" on Triple H and pulled Ziggler on top of Rollins for the pin and win. Per the pre-match stipulation, The Authority was removed from power. Triple H was fired as the COO, Stephanie was no longer a principal owner of WWE and Kane lost his role as the Director of Operations. The show ended with Triple H and Stephanie heartbroken that they lost their power, and they realized that they were nothing better than the people that clean the floors and they realized that since they were fired from power, they lost the privilege to fly on the corporate jet to WWE events, and they can only work at WWE headquarters and no longer influence the careers and lives of the superstars. The fans chanted \"Yes! Yes! Yes!\" and \"You got fired!\" Stephanie would throw a tantrum and not accept the results as she would cry as the event went off the air.\nReception.\nSurvivor Series received generally positive reviews, with particular praise going toward the main event, with highlights including Sting's debut and Ziggler's performance. Speaking of the Ambrose-Wyatt match, Larry Csonka of 411mania said \"The match was good, and they set up next month so I really don't have a lot of complaints with this\". He gave the match ***3/4 (out of *****). He gave the main event ****, calling it \"a very good main event presentation\". He gave the entire event a score of 7 out of 10. The main event received the Slammy Award for match of the year 2014.\nAftermath.\nOn the November 24 episode of \"Raw\", Triple H and Stephanie McMahon bid farewell to the WWE Universe, but were interrupted by Daniel Bryan, who returned and served as the general manager for both \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\" that week, putting members of Team Authority in unfavorable situations. Mark Henry was put in a match against Ryback, which he lost quickly. Luke Harper defended his Intercontinental Championship against Dean Ambrose, which ended in a disqualification due to Harper pushing Ambrose into the referee. Kane was put into concessions for the night as Concessions Kane. Rusev and Lana were forced to speak out the Pledge of Allegiance or defend the United States Championship in a Battle Royal, which Rusev did successfully on \"SmackDown\". Seth Rollins lost a 3-on-2 handicap match against John Cena and Dolph Ziggler, with Jamie Noble and Joey Mercury chosen as his partners by fans poll. At the end of the show, it was announced that the Anonymous Raw General Manager would be returning the following week.\nOn the December 29 episode of \"Raw\", after threatening to Curb Stomp guest host Edge (who had to retire due to multiple neck injuries that could leave him paralyzed), Seth Rollins coaxed John Cena into bringing back The Authority after just over a month of exile. The following week, The Authority rewarded Rollins by placing him in the WWE World Heavyweight Championship match at the Royal Rumble also involving Cena and defending champion Brock Lesnar. Also on that same show, the Authority also gave out pre-match stipulated consequences to Team Cena, which resulted in the firings of Dolph Ziggler, Erick Rowan, and Ryback. Later, on the January 19, 2015, episode, Cena defeated Rollins, Big Show, and Kane in a 3-on-1 handicap match (with his #1 contendership on the line) with the help of Sting - thus allowing Ziggler, Rowan, and Ryback to get their jobs back. On the January 22, 2015, episode \"SmackDown\", Daniel Bryan welcomed Ziggler, Rowan, and Ryback to celebrate their return to WWE. The three would continue to team as a quasi-faction well into 2015 before going their separate ways just before WrestleMania 31.\nOn the December 8 episode of \"Raw\", AJ Lee invoked her rematch clause against Nikki Bella for the Divas Championship at TLC: Tables, Ladders &amp; Chairs."

        "text": "The Uruguay–Argentina–Chile–Paraguay 2030 FIFA World Cup bid, also known as the South American Bid or simply the South Bid, was an unsuccessful joint bid to host the 2030 FIFA World Cup by Uruguay, Argentina, Paraguay and Chile. The tournament's name would be \"Centenary World Cup\".\nThe intended bid had initially been shared between only Uruguay and Argentina. The intended bid followed an earlier web movement claiming that FIFA should give Uruguay hosting rights for the 100th anniversary of the first World Cup, which was held in Uruguay and won by Uruguay. Argentina played in the deciding match of the 1930 FIFA World Cup.\nThe Uruguay–Argentina intention to bid was officially confirmed on 29 July 2017 before Paraguay was confirmed as the third host on 4 October 2017. Chile confirmed their bid to host with the group on 14 February 2019 as a joint communique from the confirmed nations. Bolivia also made a request to join, and Peru was rumoured to be interested in hosting. The joint bid was officially launched on 7 February 2023.\nOn 4 October 2023, the Morocco–Portugal–Spain bid was selected over the South American bid, with Uruguay, Argentina, and Paraguay being selected to host three inaugural matches on the occasion of the centenary of the 1930 World Cup. \nHistory.\nBackground.\nOn 4 October 2005, during his visit to Uruguay to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the inaugural FIFA World Cup, FIFA President Sepp Blatter had a meeting with the Uruguayan President Tabaré Vázquez. In that meeting Vázquez formally suggested that Uruguay could co-host the 2030 FIFA World Cup with another Mercosur nation to commemorate the centenary of Uruguay 1930.\nAfter the meeting, Blatter stated, \"During our meeting, the President told me of his dream of seeing this tournament hosted in the region. I told him that today's dream could be tomorrow's vision, which in turn could become a proper initiative and finally a project. At present, the South American Football Confederation is scheduled to host the 2014 FIFA World Cup, and all (national) associations will be able to present their candidature when we begin the selection process at the end of 2006. Dr Nicholas Leoz tells me that with the system of rotation it will be the turn of South America in 2030. That is the situation as it currently stands.\".\nAnnouncement of the intention to bid.\nThe bidding period has not started, so an official bid is not possible at this stage. A joint bid intention was announced by the Argentine Football Association and the Uruguayan Football Association on 29 July 2017. Before Uruguay and Argentina played out a goalless draw in Montevideo, Uruguay player Luis Suárez and Argentine captain Lionel Messi – who happened to be teammates at FC Barcelona – promoted the bid with commemorative shirts.\nOn 31 August 2017, it was suggested Paraguay would join as a third host. CONMEBOL, the South American confederation, confirmed the joint three-way bid in September 2017. The inclusion of Paraguay as a host had previously been opposed by key Uruguayan Football Association official Wilmar Valdéz and President Tabaré Vázquez.\nOn 14 February 2019, Chilean president Sebastián Piñera announced on his Twitter account that Chile will join the CONMEBOL bid and plans to co-host the 2030 FIFA World Cup. A formal announcement between all four presidents is expected but yet to be confirmed.\nFinally, on 7 February 2023, the 4 federations officially launched the joint bid to host the 2030 FIFA World Cup.\nPromotion of the candidacy.\nWhile the \"Iniciativa 2030\" commission continues to work on the project, in June 2018 the Uruguayan Post Office launched some stamps about this bid, promoting the candidacy for the 2030 World Cup.\nAlso, during the 2018 World Cup, a provisional Conmebol headquarters was installed in Russia to promote the joint candidacy. They did different activities to publicize the candidacy, and in that way they presented a photographic and film exhibition of the 1930 World Cup, played in Uruguay.\nDuring the celebration of the Copa América 2019, held in Brazil, the spot and the official posters of the candidacy were released, with a presentation made by Conmebol, which exhibited them at all times.\nDuring the 76th FIFA Congress in March 2023, CONMEBOL President Alejandro Dominguez promoted the bid, claiming that “[w]e have to have the Centenary World Cup here, to honour history.”\nPause due to the pandemic.\nIn March 2020, due to the arrival in the region of the coronavirus disease pandemic, talks between the countries were stopped.\nTo encourage the candidacy, in 2021 CONMEBOL determined that Uruguay will be the venue for the men's and women's Copa Libertadores finals, designating the Centenario and Gran Parque Central stadiums, respectively, as the venues for the two events. The idea of the confederation was for Uruguay to acquire international notoriety by hosting the tournaments, which, for example, Argentina and Chile have achieved with the holding of Copa Américas or Paraguay by also hosting a continental event. CONMEBOL also invested two million dollars in various reforms in the Centenario stadium, to take advantage of the occasion and promote the re-launch of the South American candidacy.\nThe Uruguayan Secretary of National Sports, Sebastián Bauzá, said in October 2021 that, despite the break, the spirit of winning the venue remains \"unaltered\". In charge of the Chilean commission, the journalist Michael Boys, declared: \"There is not so much trouble. First comes the official application in 2022. After a few months, FIFA will deliver the technical requirements. And then comes the whole political and diplomatic part: get the votes so that the seat is elected\". FIFA extended the deadline for official applications until the end of 2022.\nBidding process.\nThe bidding process was launched in the second quarter of 2022; a host will be chosen at the 74th FIFA Congress in 2024.\nQualification.\n48 teams will qualify for the World Cup with the current format set by United 2026. If the bid is accepted and they do win over other rival bids, then Paraguay, Uruguay, Argentina and Chile would automatically qualify.\nMajor sporting events hosting experiences.\nArgentina, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay have all hosted various major sporting events. The following is an incomplete list:\nBid committee.\nOn 20 March 2019, Argentina President Mauricio Macri, Chile President Sebastián Piñera, Paraguay President Mario Abdo and Uruguay President Tabare Vazquez accepted to create a bid committee with a representative from each country to coordinate with CONMEBOL. The first meeting will be in Buenos Aires, Argentina on 8 April 2019.\nVenues by country.\nFor the 2026 FIFA World Cup, it has been confirmed that stadiums must have a capacity of at least 40,000 for group round, second round, and quarter final matches, 60,000 for the semi-finals, and at least 80,000 for the Opening Match and Final. As of yet the rules for 2030 have not been announced.\nThere are no specific details of the venues that will be proposed by the \"Uruguay-Argentina\", \"Uruguay-Argentina-Paraguay\" or \"Uruguay-Argentina-Paraguay-Chile\" bid, but according to the statements, some information can be deduced. According to information that made public after Paraguay aspire to be included in the event, it was unofficially known that Argentina would have eight venues, that Uruguay would have three stadiums and that Paraguay would add two scenarios to the proposal.\nArgentina.\nIn 2012, after a meeting between executives from Uruguay and Argentina, it was confirmed that the Estadio Ciudad de La Plata and the Estadio Centenario would be two of the main venues of the project.\nAlso a new stadium in Santiago del Estero, the Estadio Único Madre de Ciudades was built for the candidature.\nIn October 2017, an official councilor from Mar del Plata proposed to start a process so that the city could be declared as an Argentine sub-venue for the event. Also San Juan was also proposed as a venue of the World Cup, planning to reform the Estadio San Juan del Bicentenario. Argentina has the only stadium in the Southern Cone with a capacity of at least 80,000.\nChile.\nChile has currently only two stadiums of over 40,000 seats, both located in its capital Santiago (Nacional and Monumental). Other stadiums could require major investments as many other stadiums in other co-bid nations.\nIn March 2019, President Piñera announced that Chile would propose five cities for hosting the tournament: Santiago, Concepción, Antofagasta and Valparaíso, with a fifth city between Coquimbo and Temuco yet to be decided. Every stadium would need to be renewed in order to comply with the required eligibility criteria.\nParaguay.\nThe fact of planning a joint bid between Uruguay and Argentina for the 2030 World Cup, corresponds to the fear of the Uruguayans of not being able to host a world tournament due to its scarce sports infrastructure. For this reason, the Paraguayan intention is to provide two venues and argue their inclusion in order to ensure the success of the candidacy.\nIn this case, about possible Paraguayan stadiums, both scenarios will correspond to the Asunción sub-sector, and it is speculated that they will be the Defensores del Chaco Stadium and the recently reopened General Pablo Rojas Stadium, popularly known as \"La Nueva Olla\". Like the Uruguayan case with Montevideo, Paraguay must receive the authorization of FIFA for that the sub-office in Asunción can provide two stadiums for the candidature.\nIn turn, the second Paraguayan headquarters would be in Ciudad del Este or Encarnación. The Antonio Aranda Stadium (Ciudad del Este) is could be the second Paraguayan headquarters, following a project by the club 3 de Febrero to modernize the stadium and have a capacity of 50.000 spectators, being the biggest stadium in Paraguay.\nIn 2019, Paraguayan digital newspaper D10 reported that Club Cerro Porteño's Estadio General Pablo Rojas was chosen as Asunción's venue, whilst the other chosen venue was the Villa Alegre Stadium in the city of Encarnación.\nUruguay.\nThe Estadio Centenario would be one of the Uruguayan stadiums, and a candidate to host the final match. According to the former president of the Uruguayan Football Association (AUF), Wilmar Valdez, Uruguay will have only two cities hosting matches, which will be Montevideo and Maldonado.\nA likely candidate for a host stadium would be the Estadio Centenario, where the final of the first world championship was played in 1930 and which is Uruguay's largest stadium. With respect to the Maldonado sub-station, it would be the only stadium in that department, Domingo Burgueño Miguel Stadium. However, the organization plans a third stadium in Uruguay, which would be another one in the Montevideo sub-center.\nOnly two other stadiums in Montevideo could be taken into account: the Estadio Gran Parque Central (also host the first World Cup), or the recently inaugurated Estadio Campeón del Siglo. Also since the end of 2012, Nacional has been promoting the inclusion of Gran Parque Central as the second stadium of the Montevideo venue in 2030, which it ratified again in 2017. The argument that will be presented for Nacional's request of a second stadium in Montevideo will be the history of the stadium as one of the first two World Cup stadiums, together with the former Pocitos Stadium. According to the president of the AUF, Wilmar Valdez, the stadium of Peñarol (Estadio Campeón del Siglo) will not be taken into account due to its accessibility problems.\nIn April 2018 it was confirmed that Uruguay would present two venues (Montevideo and one in the interior of the country) and that the Uruguayan organization would have four stadiums: Centenario, Gran Parque Central and Campeón del Siglo in Montevideo, and also a new stadium outside of the capital. 300 million dollars will be invested to modernize the Estadio Centenario and another stadium will be built in the interior (probably in Punta del Este or Colonia) with an investment of also 300 million dollars.\nPotential venues.\nDuring the 76th CONMEBOL Ordinary Congress on 31 March 2023, a video was shown introducing the possible venues that the bid would have, shown below. Considering that forty-eight teams will compete, it has been noted that \"at least twelve stadiums\" will be required, but the number of possible stadiums could be higher.\nControversy.\nWhile some have supported the bid for its symbolic return to where the World Cup started, there has been some concern about both the economic and security situation in South America. Examples of political instability include the 2021 anti-government protests in Colombia (which led to the country losing hosting rights to the 2021 Copa América), instability in Peru, and protests in Ecuador and Brazil. Two countries in the region (but not included in the World Cup bid) gave up hosting rights to international competitions in 2022-23: Ecuador withdrew from hosting the 2024 Copa América due to economic concerns, while Peru withdrew from hosting the 2023 FIFA U-17 World Cup due to the country's inability to fulfill its commitments to completing the infrastructure required to stage the tournament."

        "title": "NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament upsets",
        "text": "An upset is a victory by an underdog team. In the context of the NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament, a single-elimination tournament, this generally constitutes a lower seeded team defeating a higher-seeded (\"i.e.\", higher-ranked) team; a widely recognized upset is one performed by a team ranked substantially lower than its opponent.\nThis is the list of victories by teams seeded 11 or lower in the first round and second rounds of the tournament, as well as those by teams seeded 8 or 9 against 1 and 7 or 10 against 2 seeds in the second round, since it expanded to 64 teams in 1994; as these low-seeded teams were automatically paired against higher-seeded teams at the start of the tournament, their opening victories are almost always considered upsets. Most victories by these teams in later rounds were usually against better seeded opponents as well. The list also includes victories by teams seeded 8 or lower in the Sweet 16 (the four regional semifinals), teams seeded 7 or lower in the Elite Eight (the four regional finals), and teams seeded 6 or lower in the Final Four. All teams are listed by athletic brand names they used at the time of their wins, which do not always match those in use today.\nThe NCAA defines a tournament \"upset\" as a victory by a team seeded 5 or more lines below its defeated opponent.\nThe first 16 seed ever to win a game in an NCAA Division I basketball tournament was Harvard in 1998 against Stanford. According to an Associated Press retrospective on the 10th anniversary of the game in 2008, \"The difference between the teams was much smaller than usual for a No. 1 and a 16 seed.\" Harvard had two years of tournament experience and the nation's leading scorer that season in Allison Feaster. Stanford suffered two devastating injuries during the run-up to the tournament. First, Vanessa Nygaard tore an ACL in the Cardinal's final regular-season game against Oregon State. Because the extent of her injury was not known at the time the tournament field was selected, the Cardinal still received a 1 seed. Then, in the team's first practice after the tournament selection, leading scorer and rebounder Kristin Folkl also tore an ACL.\nMost successful low seeds.\nBest outcomes for low seeds since expansion to 64 teams in 1994:\nBest Performances by #16 Seeds.\nOther than Harvard beating Stanford in 1998, no losing #16 seed has even lost by single digits and/or taken a game to overtime, with the closest margin of defeat being a 12-point loss by #16 Grambling to #1 Texas Tech in the same tournament.\nBest Performances by #14 &amp; #15 Seeds.\nNo #14 seed has beaten a #3 and no #15 seed has beaten a #2 seed, but they have come close.\nRound of 64.\nDetail between each pair of seeds in this section has been updated as of completion of the 2024 Round of 64, representing 120 games played between each pair.\n16 defeats 1.\nThere has been 1 game where a 16-seed has defeated a 1-seed (), in the round of 64, since 1994:\n15 defeats 2.\nNo 15-seed has ever won a game in the women's tournament.\nThe closest any 15 seed came to winning was in 2017, when Long Beach State lost 56–55 to 2 seed Oregon State.\n14 defeats 3.\nNo 14-seed has ever won a game in the women's tournament.\nThe closest any 14 seed has come to winning are the three 2-point losses to 3 seeds in 2003, 2004, and 2012.\n13 defeats 4.\nThere have been 7 games where a 13-seed has defeated a 4-seed (), in the round of 64, since 1994:\n12 defeats 5.\nThere have been 26 games where a 12-seed has defeated a 5-seed (), in the round of 64, since 1994:\n11 defeats 6.\nThere have been 37 games where an 11-seed has defeated a 6-seed (), in the round of 64, since 1994:\nRound of 32.\nThis round is called the second round.

        "text": "The 1971 England rugby union tour of the Far East was a series of matches played between September and October by an English national selection in Asia, as part of the RFU's centenary celebrations. None of the six international matches on this tour were given official Test status, with England playing as England XV, No \"caps\" were awarded to the English players who took part on the tour. \nThe first match against Japan was played at the Kintetsu Hanazono Rugby Stadium, in Osaka, on the Friday, 24 September 1971, (Vernal Equinox Day, a public holiday in Japan), in front of a crowd of 13,000. The Japanese side was captained by 30 year old Akira Yokoi and coached by Tetsunosuke Onishi. England struggled to overcome Japan in the match, despite outscoring the home side five tries to two (tries were still worth four points). The match was level at 19-19 with three minutes to go before tries from right wing Peter Glover in the 37th minute and centre Jeremy Janion in the 38th minute gave the English XV a 27-19 victory.\nThe second match of the series held under lights at the Chichibunomiya Rugby Stadium in Tokyo on Tuesday, 28 September 1971, before 25,000 people, was even closer than the previous game. At halftime neither side had scored a try, but England crept out to a halftime lead of 6-0, with two penalties scored by fullback Peter Rossborough. Japan then came back hard in the second half, getting three points of their own, with a penalty scored by flanker Yoshiharu Yamaguchi. One of the Japanese centres, Koji Miyata, was tackled just three yards from the try line but the visitors eventually held out for a 6-3 win.\nResults.\n\"Scores and results list England's points tally first.\""

        "text": "Pellicani Bocconi Lacrosse (officially Bocconi Sport Team SSD - Sezione Lacrosse) is an Italian lacrosse team founded in Milan, Italy in 2009.\nHistory.\nLacrosse was introduced in Bocconi University by a few students who had played lacrosse before in England and Hong Kong. In 2011, the team won second place at its first appearance in Coppa Italia. The arrival of American player/coach Scott Offerman helped transform the previously strictly amateur team into a more rigorous athletic organization.\nSeason-by-Season.\nIn 2011/12 Bocconi Lacrosse won the Italian National Championship and we arrived 2nd in Coppa Italia. Its coach won the \"Coach of the Year\" award and \"Best Season Attackman\" award.\nIn 2012/13, Bocconi Lacrosse won again the Italian National Championship beating Red Hawks Merate 17–3 in the final match. Bocconi Lacrosse completed the perfect season, winning all the matches.\nIn September 2013 Bocconi Lacrosse won its first Italian National Cup beating Roma Leones 6–5 in the finale.\nIn 2013/14, Bocconi Lacrosse ended up first in the League without losing a single game and with goal difference +120. The team has also won the Coppa Italia 2014 in Prato.\nIn 2014/15, Bocconi Lacrosse ended up first in the League without losing a single game again. The team has also won the Coppa Italia 2015 in Torino. In April 2015, the team has won their only international title, the Zombies Cup in Belgrade, Serbia, having a perfect score (5-0) and beating the Poznan Hussars in the Finals.\nIn 2015/16, Bocconi Lacrosse ended up first in the League without losing a single game for four years straight. In September 2016, the team ended up 7th at the Ken Galluccio Cup, repeating the success of the previous year. In October 2016, the team won its fourth straight Coppa Italia, which was held in Milan, beating Red Hawks Merate in the finals 9–5.\nIn the 2016/17 season, for the 5th year in a row, Bocconi Lacrosse won the League without losing one single game thus qualifying again for the Ken Galluccio Cup. In September of that year the team finished 8th and finished the season winning its 5th straight Coppa Italia.\nThe two following seasons, after the historical core of the team retired, the Pelicans saw a massive restructuring of the team, and through the management of Matteo Scotti, Enrico Mazzullo and finally of Roberto Antonioli, managed to bring back a competitive team for the 2019/20 season.\nDuring the 2019/20 season, the renewed ensemble started off the championship with a 4-0 stint that was only stopped by the annulment of the Championship itself due to the rise and spread of COVID-19. Also, the subsequent season was annulled by the Italian Federation.\nAfter the 2-year break a trimmed-down team got into the 2021/22 season, and after a shaky start, managed to finish second with the mixed Roma/Merate/Torino team winning the Championship in the last match. The team bounced back in June, winning its 6th Coppa Italia.\nIn 2022/23, the Pelicans reached both the Championship and Coppa Italia finals, bringing home only two silver medals during what is known as the \"cursed month\"."

She was knocked out in the first round by compatriot Maria Kirilenko in three sets; this marked Sharapova's worst performance at a Major tournament since she lost in the first round of the 2003 French Open, and the first time she lost a match at the tournament since her heavy defeat in the 2007 final to Serena Williams (she did not participate in 2009 due to injury).\nNorth American season.\nRather than participate at the two Middle East Premier tournaments in Doha and Dubai, Sharapova decided to instead compete at the Cellular South Cup in Memphis, as a means of attempting to regain her confidence following her first round defeat in Australia. As the top seed in the tournament, Sharapova won the tournament without dropping a set, defeating Shenay Perry, Bethanie Mattek-Sands, Elena Baltacha, Petra Kvitová and Sofia Arvidsson on her way to capturing her 21st career title.\nSharapova's next tournament was Indian Wells. After receiving a bye in the first round, and defeating compatriot Vera Dushevina in the second, Sharapova was upset in the third round by Zheng Jie of China in three sets. Following the defeat, Sharapova then withdrew from Miami citing an elbow injury. This was the third year in a row in which Sharapova was forced to miss the North American hard-court season concluder.\nClay court season.\nAfter a few weeks off the tour, Sharapova returned at the Madrid Open in May, but, as it was at the Australian Open earlier in the year, her tournament would be another short affair, as she fell in the first round to Lucie Šafářová. Following the early exit in Madrid, Sharapova then entered the Internationaux de Strasbourg as a wildcard entry and the top seed, where she would win her second title for the year, by defeating Kristina Barrois in the final.\nSharapova then competed at the French Open as the 11th seed. After routine straight sets victories over Ksenia Pervak and Kirsten Flipkens in the first two rounds, Sharapova lost in the third round to four-times champion Justine Henin, however, she would become the first player since Svetlana Kuznetsova in 2005 to win a set against the Belgian at the French Open. Sharapova was also the last player to be beaten by the Belgian at the tournament; Henin's victory was her 23rd (and last) consecutive match victory at the tournament.\nGrass court season.\nFollowing the French Open, Sharapova started her preparations for Wimbledon by reaching the final of the Aegon Classic in Birmingham, where she was beaten by top seed Li Na after serving seven double faults in the match.\nSharapova was seeded 16th at Wimbledon. She defeated Anastasia Pivovarova, Ioana Raluca Olaru and Barbora Záhlavová-Strýcová in the first three rounds, all in straight sets, to set up a fourth round showdown against defending champion Serena Williams, in what would be their first meeting on grass since the 2004 Wimbledon final, and thus a rematch of the same final, which Sharapova won. However, there would be no repeat this time around, as Sharapova succumbed in straight sets, despite holding several set points in the first set. This marked her fifth straight defeat to Williams since the end of 2004, and the fourth consecutive year in which she would fail to reach the quarter-finals at Wimbledon.\nFollowing her defeat at Wimbledon, Sharapova then visited her parents' hometown of Gomel, Belarus, to meet the victims of the Chernobyl accident, which occurred when Sharapova was conceived by her parents, who escaped the city as a result.\nUS Open series.\nAfter a month off the Tour, Sharapova returned to action at the Bank of the West Classic in Stanford. She defeated Zheng Jie, Olga Govortsova, Elena Dementieva and Agnieszka Radwańska en route to reaching her fourth final for the year, where she was defeated easily by emerging rival Victoria Azarenka. Sharapova then made her tournament debut at Cincinnati, where she defeated Svetlana Kuznetsova (who had just won the title in San Diego the previous week), Andrea Petkovic, Agnieszka Radwańska (for a second time in three weeks), Marion Bartoli (who had just defeated Caroline Wozniacki in the third round) and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova (in three sets) to reach her fifth final of the year. There, she faced Kim Clijsters, the defending US Open champion. She came very close to winning the title, holding championship points in the second set before rain interrupted the match and Sharapova's momentum; this break allowed Clijsters to make a comeback and eventually win in three sets.\nSharapova's next tournament was the US Open, where she was seeded 16th. After defeating Jarmila Gajdošová, Iveta Benešová and Beatrice Capra in the first three rounds, Sharapova lost in the fourth round to top seed Caroline Wozniacki, in a match where she served nine double faults and committed 36 unforced errors. Her collective performances at the Majors in 2010 represented her worst performance at that level since 2003, the last year she failed to reach a single Major quarter-final until this year.\nThe victory over Capra, which preceded the loss to Wozniacki, marked Sharapova's 100th match victory at a Major tournament, and her first double bagel victory at the same level.\nAsian hard court season.\nSharapova's Asian hard court swing would turn out to be short-lived one; as the defending champion in Tokyo, Sharapova lost in the first round to Kimiko Date-Krumm in three sets, and in Beijing, she fell to compatriot Elena Vesnina in the second round. This meant that she lost three of her last four matches to finish the season, and thus failed to qualify for the year-end championships for the third year in succession. She had qualified for the alternate year-ending championships, the WTA Tournament of Champions in Bali, but chose not to participate.\nSharapova finished the season ranked World No. 18, only nine rankings points behind a resurgent Ana Ivanovic; this was her lowest year-end ranking since 2003.\nAll matches.\nThis table chronicles all the matches of Sharapova in 2010, including walkovers (W/O) which the WTA does not count as wins.

        "text": "The 2013 Giro d'Italia began on 4 May, and stage 11 occurred on 15 May. The 2013 edition began with a road stage, for the first time since 2003, around Naples before a team time trial took place the following day on the island of Ischia. The rest of the opening half of the race – remaining within Italy for the duration – consisted of medium-mountain stages, save for two categorised flat stages and the first of two individual time trials during the event; the -long eighth stage between Gabicce Mare and Saltara, where each remaining member of the starting peloton of 207 riders competed against the clock.\nMark Cavendish became the first race leader, as he won the opening stage in Naples; the first of two stage wins that Cavendish achieved during the opening half of the race, along with the sixth stage. As a result, Cavendish was the only rider to win multiple stages in the opening half of the race. Cavendish lost the race lead the following day, as his team failed to a sufficient time for him to remain in the jersey. won the stage, which put Salvatore Puccio into the \"maglia rosa\" after he had placed highest during the opening stage, out of the five remaining members of the train at the finish. Luca Paolini soloed into the leader's jersey after the third stage, attacking with remaining and held clear of the field to win by sixteen seconds. He held the leader's jersey for four days, before losing it on the seventh stage, held in heavy rain.\nOn that stage, Adam Hansen – a rider who had completed all three Grand Tours in 2012 – took the honours by over a minute from a stage-long breakaway, while Beñat Intxausti was able to take the leader's jersey after finishing in the group of the overall favourites for the race. Intxausti's weakness in the time trial discipline saw him surrender the lead the following day, losing three and a half minutes to the stage winner, team-mate Alex Dowsett. Vincenzo Nibali – a previous Grand Tour winner at the 2010 Vuelta a España – assumed the race lead, and held the lead to the end of the eleventh stage, which marked the halfway point of the race. Nibali had ended the time trial 29 seconds clear of closest challenger Cadel Evans, but he gained twelve bonus seconds on the tenth stage, the race's first summit finish, to extend his advantage to 41 seconds with the more mountainous second half of the Giro still to come.\nStage 1.\nFor the first time since the 2003 edition of the race, the Giro d'Italia began with a mass-start stage rather than a time trial test against the clock. Naples was announced as the starting location for the race in June 2012, with the 2013 race marking the 50th anniversary of the race's only other start in Naples; on that occasion, Vittorio Adorni soloed to victory in Potenza. The opening stage of the 2013 Giro was a circuit race in and around Naples, with two different circuits being utilised. Four laps of a -long circuit were completed first, with two ascents of a fourth-category climb providing any potential breakaways with the opportunity of claiming the mountains jersey on the opening day. From there, a shorter circuit of in length was completed eight times, with the finish of the stage at the Lungomare Caracciolo. With no major tests on the stage, it was widely expected to end in a sprint finish.\nAlmost immediately after the race began, the breakaway was formed, with seven riders attempting to work together in order to create a sizable advantage over the field, but could not muster an advantage of much over two minutes. The 's Giovanni Visconti and Cameron Wurf of each led the breakaway over the summit of the climb, with Guillaume Bonnafond () also achieving three points through minor placings on both ascents. This meant that the first \"maglia azzurra\" would be settled in the final sprint. Around halfway into the stage, Wurf moved off the front on his own, and remained clear of the field until around , where the -led peloton moved past him.\nSeveral late crashes split the field into many groups, the last of which came inside the final , ensuring that the majority of the field would receive the same time as the stage winner. For the final sprint, it came down to a select group of sprinters; sat on the front with the lead-out for Matthew Goss, but Elia Viviani () and 's Mark Cavendish moved ahead, with Cavendish ultimately taking the victory on the line by almost a bike length. With his 37th Grand Tour stage win, moving him into a tie for eighth place on the all-time list with Rik Van Looy, Cavendish picked up the pink and red jerseys on the podium as leader of the general and points classifications. Although disappointed with losing the sprint, Viviani became the first white jersey wearer as young rider leader, and Visconti placed highest in the sprint to take the mountains lead.\nStage 2.\nFor the second stage of the race, the peloton was ferried over to the volcanic island of Ischia, which was hosting the Giro d'Italia for the first time in 54 years. On that occasion, an individual time trial over a course of was contested; which was won by Antonino Catalano, taking his only Giro stage victory, beating every other member of the peloton – with the exception of Jacques Anquetil – by over a minute. For Ischia's appearance in the 2013 race, a technical, undulating parcours of was set aside for the team time trial, including gradients of approaching 7% for a period within the final of the course. The start order for the stage was primarily set by the reverse order of how each of the 23 teams were ranked in the \"Trofeo Fast Team\" standings after the previous day's opening stage; the only exception was that would set off last, as Mark Cavendish was in possession of the \"maglia rosa\", as the general classification leader.\n were the first team to start – each team setting off thereafter, at three-minute intervals – and only shed one rider from their train by the time they reached the finish in a time of 23' 01\", but that time was beaten by the next squad on the course, as went below 23 minutes, recording a time of 22' 55\". were next onto the stage, and were comfortably quicker, as they were 22 seconds faster for the course. Their time was not beaten until hit the course, and despite early problems for several of their team, they came across the line in a time of 22' 05\". As it turned out, the time was not to be beaten, giving the squad their second team time trial victory of the season after a victory in the discipline at the Giro del Trentino. By the end of the stage, only one team – the  – remained within ten seconds, having recorded a quicker time, by two seconds, to the intermediate point in Casamicciola Terme. Cavendish surrendered the leader's jersey, as could only record the seventeenth best time, 48 seconds down on . As a result, Salvatore Puccio became the race leader, as of the five remaining members of the train at the finish, he had placed highest on the opening stage.\nStage 3.\nBack on the mainland after its foray to Ischia, the third stage of the 2013 Giro was split into three distinct sections. From the start in Sorrento, the peloton completed two circuits of a loop before making an undulating way along the Amalfi coast to Salerno. Upon reaching Salerno – where the first of two intermediate sprint points was held, along with one at Agropoli – the route remained relatively flat for the next . The day's two categorised climbs came within the final third of the stage; the second-category San Mauro Cilento, averaging 6.7% over , with gradients reaching 16% in the opening metres of the climb, and the third-category Sella di Catona, averaging 6.6% over . From the top of the Sella di Catona, there was a near- descent into the finish town of Ascea.\nThe day's breakaway was formed immediately after the start in Sorrento, with seven riders going clear to establish an advantage; the best of which was Fabio Taborre of the team, who trailed the overall leader Salvatore Puccio () by 22 seconds overnight. Despite this, the septet was allowed to establish an advantage of over seven minutes at its maximum. On the San Mauro Cilento, the breakaway was down to six riders as Bert De Backer () lost contact with his companions. rider Willem Wauters led over the climb, while the peloton came across the top around 3' 45\" down on the lead sextet, with De Backer in between. A group of sprinters fell off the back of the peloton, including 's Mark Cavendish and Nacer Bouhanni of , but both were able to rejoin.\nTaborre attacked on the descent from the climb, gaining an advantage of over a minute at one point, reaching the foot of the Sella di Catona with such a lead. upped the pace in the peloton, which enabled the group to overcome the remnants of the breakaway group, and at one point, caused a fracture in the main field which saw a group of overall contenders including Ryder Hesjedal, Vincenzo Nibali, Bradley Wiggins and Michele Scarponi to get clear. Hesjedal then attacked solo from this group, passing Taborre, before slowing up and returned to the main group. On the descent, Nibali's team-mate Valerio Agnoli pushed on and had Hesjedal and 's Luca Paolini join him. This group was brought back, with keeping the pace high. Paolini attacked again with around remaining, and was not to be caught, taking his first stage win in his début Giro, and the \"maglia rosa\" from Puccio, who lost seven minutes. rider Cadel Evans led home a sixteen-rider select group sixteen seconds behind, ahead of Hesjedal.\nStage 4.\nThe race continued to make its way along the coast of the Tyrrhenian Sea, heading southwards to the southernmost point of the 2013 Giro d'Italia with the finish in Serra San Bruno. With a parcours of , the fourth stage was also the second longest of the entire race, with only the thirteenth stage involving a longer day in the saddle. The stage was predominantly flat, with only the final quarter of the stage involving sizable shifts in altitude, with two categorised climbs as part of the parcours, for the second day in succession. The third-category Vibo Valentia climb was slow and progressional, as it averaged only 3% over , before the second-category Croce Ferrata. Incorporating the second intermediate sprint at Soriano Calabro, the climb itself was long, and reached a maximum gradient of 10%. A descent of almost followed towards the finish in Serra San Bruno, with most of the final kilometre being run on cobblestones.\nJust like the previous day, the day's main breakaway was made up of seven riders, with the best-placed among the septet being Emanuele Sella (), who trailed race leader Luca Paolini of by 2' 39\" overnight. The group managed to build up an advantage of around eight minutes at one point during the stage. Paolini's team maintained their presence at the front of the peloton, cutting the advantage by half by the time the race reached the mark. The lead group split at this point, with Sella, Ioannis Tamouridis () and 's Anthony Roux gradually falling back to the main group. The lead then went back up to 5' 10\", before falling substantially prior to the first climb of the day, the Vibo Valentia, to about one minute.\nTamouridis' team-mate Miguel Mínguez attacked on the climb, and was the last member of the breakaway to be brought back by the main field, eventually doing so with remaining. There were several mini-attacks from there, lasting all the way to the foot of the other climb, the Croce Ferrata, where 's Sylvain Georges attacked out of a six-rider move at the bottom; he managed to establish a maximum lead of over a minute, before moved to the front of the peloton. 's Danilo Di Luca and Robinson Chalapud () attacked out of the peloton and soon passed Georges on the road, maintaining a small gap over the main field. Di Luca launched a long sprint for the line, doing so from around out, and was not caught until to go. From there, 's Enrico Battaglin finished strongest to take the biggest win of his short professional career, by two lengths ahead of Sella's team-mate Fabio Felline and the 's Giovanni Visconti, who had earlier done enough to regain the mountains classification lead. Paolini retained the \"maglia rosa\" after finishing tenth on the stage.\nStage 5.\nAnother predominantly flat stage, the fifth stage started with a gradual downhill stretch from the start town of Cosenza, before a fourth-category ascent at Cipolletto, after around of racing. From there, the race meandered its way back to coastal roads, taking in intermediate sprint points at Villapiana Lido and Rocca Imperiale. With around remaining, the route turned away from the coast, and headed towards the finish town of Matera. On the run-in was another fourth-category climb at Montescaglioso, before a gradual uphill finish in Matera; the roads rose by 2.6% within the final kilometre before the finish on the \"Via Dante Alighieri\". It was expected to disadvantage out-and-out sprinters, but favour sprinters with climbing capabilities, such as 's John Degenkolb, and rider Matthew Goss.\nSix riders formed the primary breakaway for the day, establishing their advantage from the points onwards. The best placed of the sextet was Stefano Pirazzi of the team, who trailed overall leader Luca Paolini () by just over three minutes overnight; after he claimed maximum points at the first climb at Cipolletto, Pirazzi sat up from the lead group and returned the peloton. After Pirazzi dropped back, the peloton slowed their pace substantially, and the five-man lead group were allowed to build up a lead of almost ten minutes on the stage. The weather changed on the route; having started in bright sunshine, heavy rain hit the peloton with around making conditions treacherous on the roads. The lead group's advantage was continually brought back on the route, holding a lead of just over 30 seconds by the time they reached the final climb at Montescaglioso.\nThe lead five riders were brought back one-by-one, with the last rider to be caught being Ricardo Mestre of the team, with about to go. Pirazzi attacked on the climb in the hope of gaining more points to the mountains classification – ultimately crossing the summit in first position – but was joined on the descent by 's Ben Gastauer. Gastauer soon left Pirazzi behind and was joined by Mestre's team-mate Robert Vrečer. rider Lars Bak also provided assistance to the group within the final , but the trio were ultimately caught. Marco Canola led the field into the final kilometre for , with Degenkolb's lead-out man Luka Mezgec falling to the tarmac on the still-wet roads, meaning Degenkolb had to chase Canola on his own; he caught up with him, and soon sprinted away to his first stage win at the Giro, and his sixth Grand Tour stage win.\nStage 6.\nThe sixth stage of the Giro d'Italia was seen as one of the most sprinter-friendly stages of the race, with the parcours being run largely at sea level, on the coast of the Adriatic Sea. The course meandered inland after the second of the day's intermediate sprint points at Barletta – the first coming prior in the town of Trani – with a slight ascent of a small hill, but nothing categorised towards the mountains classification. The route headed back to the coast for the finish in Margherita di Savoia, where around two-and-a-half laps of a -long circuit were completed before the expected sprint finish. The day's breakaway was all-Australian, as 's Jack Bobridge was joined by Cameron Wurf of  – who featured in the breakaway on the opening day – as they got clear after numerous smaller attacks had been brought back within the opening , gaining an advantage of six and a half minutes at one point during the stage, before the sprinters' teams started the chase.\nWurf's team-mates were twice able to launch Elia Viviani to gain points on 's Mark Cavendish, in relation to the points classification, at each of the intermediate sprint points. Prior to the first passage through the finish line, the two leaders were brought back and almost immediately after, there was a large crash in the main field, which blocked the road momentarily. The group split, but ultimately came back together within and set up the sprint finish. led into the final kilometre, but soon came to the fore with Gert Steegmans launching Cavendish for his second stage win of the race, and his 38th Grand Tour stage win. After praising the lead-out of his team-mates, Cavendish dedicated his victory on the podium to Wouter Weylandt, by holding a dossard with the number 108 on it, the number Weylandt had been competing with during the 2011 Giro d'Italia, when he was killed during the third stage, held on 9 May. He also regained the lead of the points classification from overall leader Luca Paolini, who maintained the \"maglia rosa\".\nStage 7.\nAn undulating parcours of awaited the riders for the seventh stage of the 2013 Giro d'Italia, starting and finishing on the coast of the Adriatic Sea. However, most of the day's action was scheduled for inland, and in the second half of the stage; within the final , there were four categorised climbs – two third-category and two fourth-category ascents respectively – as well as the day's two intermediate sprints, coming in Chieti (most notably, a frequent stage finishing town for the early-season Tirreno–Adriatico stage race) and in Chieti Scalo. The final climb of the San Silvestro came with just remaining before the pan-flat finish to in Pescara, just above sea level.\nFabio Taborre () launched the first attack of the day, but it was not until a group of six riders had formed that the breakaway was allowed to break free and establish an advantage; the best-placed rider amongst them was rider Emanuele Sella, who trailed overall leader Luca Paolini of by just under seven minutes. The sextet built up a lead of almost seven and a half minutes around halfway through the stage, before Taborre and his team-mates – as well as Paolini's team – set about trying to reduce the lead. The lead group split on the second climb in Chieti, when Sella and Adam Hansen of , were able to drop the four other members of the breakaway. Rain was also making riding conditions difficult, with Sella being caught out while cornering; Hansen waited for his fellow escapee before regaining the momentum to gap the main field. Hansen was able to drop Sella on the third of the four climbs, the third-category, 5.9% average gradient ascent of the Santa Maria de Criptis, reaching the top of the climb with an advantage of some 30 seconds.\nIn the main field, 's Tanel Kangert and rider Danilo Di Luca both launched combative moves off the front, while at the bottom of the final climb, Kangert's team-mate Vincenzo Nibali fell to the ground due to the slippery conditions. The main field had split at this point, with missing the junction, leaving Bradley Wiggins in a chasing group. Sella – who was in between the lead and the peloton – crashed with around remaining, with the same corner later catching out Wiggins, who later elected to gingerly descend the rest of the hill, losing more time to the main group. At the front, Hansen – who completed all three Grand Tours in 2012 – was still out front and soloed away to his first win since 2010. A 27-rider group came across the line just over a minute later, with 's Enrico Battaglin leading the group. The majority of the race favourites were within this group, with the exception of Wiggins, who lost nearly 90 seconds more than that, dropping outside the top 20 overall. Paolini was also in that group, and thus surrendered the lead of the race to the 's Beñat Intxausti, with Nibali and 's Ryder Hesjedal within ten seconds ahead of the following day's time trial.\nStage 8.\nThe first of two individual time trials to be held in the 2013 Giro d'Italia, the eighth stage was the longest such test against the clock to feature in the race since 2009. On that occasion, then- rider Denis Menchov won the stage after completing the course, in the Cinque Terre, in a time just over 94 minutes. The Marche region played host to the parcours, with a twisty, technical course, but not overly mountainous unlike 2009. The final of the course was also set to test the riders; from the second intermediate time-check in , the riders steadily climbed towards the finish at the Villa del Balì in Saltara, with an 11.2% average gradient climb coming within the final kilometre. As was customary of time trial stages, the riders set off in reverse order from where they were ranked in the general classification at the end of the previous stage. Thus, Jack Bobridge of , who, in 201st place – of the 207 riders who started the race – trailed overall leader Beñat Intxausti () by one hour, twenty-four minutes and twelve seconds, was the first rider to set off on the stage.\nAlthough Bobridge was first into the stage, he was not the first to finish, as 's Maxim Belkov – who started the stage three minutes behind Bobridge, at one-minute intervals – recorded a time of one hour, twenty-one minutes and thirty-two seconds for the course; Bobridge finished three minutes further later, losing six minutes in total to Belkov. Belkov's time remained at the top of the time-sheets for around fifteen minutes before rider Jesse Sergent took over at the top, beating Belkov's time by 3' 05\". Again, Sergent held the top spot for around the same length of time as what Belkov did, before the eventual stage-winning time was recorded. British national champion Alex Dowsett () set the fastest time at each of the intermediate splits, and ultimately recorded a time exactly two minutes quicker than Sergent, in a time of one hour, sixteen minutes and twenty-seven seconds. In his début Grand Tour, Dowsett achieved his first stage victory since the 2011 Tour of Britain, also in an individual time trial.\nAmong the overall contenders, 's Bradley Wiggins was considered as the pre-stage favourite, but was not expected to take the \"maglia rosa\" after losing time the previous day into Pescara. Wiggins caught his minute-man Danilo Di Luca () in the early part of the stage, but he had stop several minutes later with a puncture; he threw his bike to the ground, before receiving a new bike from his mechanics. Although he was 52 seconds down on Dowsett at the first split, Wiggins had reduced the gap to just 10 at the finish, which was the closest anyone got to Dowsett. 's Michele Scarponi put in a solid performance to lose just 43 seconds to Wiggins, while the 's Cadel Evans lost 29 to remain 47 seconds ahead of him, in the overall classification. Evans also moved up to second overall, as 's Vincenzo Nibali became the new leader. Nibali went quicker than Dowsett to the first intermediate, but faded in the second portion of the course, finishing fourth on the stage – just behind team-mate Tanel Kangert – losing eleven seconds to Wiggins, but maintained a 1' 16\" lead over him overall.\nStage 9.\nThe ninth stage of the 2013 Giro d'Italia was the last to be contested before the first of two rest days to be held during the race, the following day. With an itinerary of through the mountains of Tuscany, it was to be expected that the breakaway would have a chance to achieve another stage victory, on roads expected to feature in September's UCI Road World Championships due to be held in the region. The parcours had a mix of categorised climbs throughout; for the four categorised climbs during the stage, each of the four categorisations available to the race organisers for ascents was implemented. The highest of these was the first-category Vallombrosa climb, but was not overly difficult at 6% over . Two punchy climbs followed; the third-category Vetta le Croci averaged over 9% during the climb, while the Fiesole averaged 5.7%, before a run to the finish in Florence.\nAfter an earlier seven-rider move had been brought back early in the stage, the day's breakaway came about at the point, with a group swelling to twelve riders going clear; the best placed among the group was 's Juan Manuel Gárate, who trailed overall leader Vincenzo Nibali () by 5' 42\" overnight. The lead group split on the day's first climb, the Consuma Pass, when 's Robinson Chalapud attacked along with Stefano Pirazzi of the team, with the duo being joined by rider Maxim Belkov on the descent from the climb. The trio were continuing to extend their lead over the main field, holding an advantage of over five minutes at that point. Belkov lost time on the second climb – where Pirazzi led Chalapud over the top again, in order to boost his position in the mountains classification – but was able to rejoin on the descent, once more.\nOnce Belkov had rejoined, he did not stay around long, accelerating down the road from Pirazzi and Chalapud. He had established an advantage of almost two minutes by the time that another three riders had joined up with Pirazzi and Chalapud, with around remaining of the stage; the chase group soon expanded to nine riders chasing after Belkov, who was over three and a half minutes clear with remaining. Belkov tired in the closing stages, but still did enough to win the stage by 44 seconds for his first professional victory. Behind, Jarlinson Pantano () and 's Tobias Ludvigsson had attacked out of the chase group, and had vainly set off in pursuit of Belkov. Both riders were ultimately beaten to the line by 's Carlos Betancur, who attacked out of the peloton on the final climb; he mistakenly believed that he had won the stage, celebrating as he came across the line. Pantano beat Ludvigsson for third, while Cadel Evans () led home the group of overall contenders not long after, taking the points classification lead in the process. One overall contender missing from the group however, was Ryder Hesjedal of , who lost over a minute on the course, and dropped out of the top ten overall.\nStage 10.\nThe race's first summit finish was key to its resumption after the first rest day the previous day; the parcours from Cordenons started with a gradual climb out of the starting town, with several small hills in the opening half of the stage. The roads started to climb towards more sharply after the day's first intermediate sprint point, coming with around to go in Paularo. From there, the riders began the climb of the Passo Cason di Lanza – a ascent from the bottom to the top, but with a downhill portion of just over  – averaging a gradient of around 8.5%. A long gradual descent followed, towards the town of Chiusaforte before the ascent of the Altopiano del Montasio. After a sustained approach, the climb of ramped up immediately with 14% sections – sections reached 20% near the top of the climb – with the average being around 8%. The final kilometre was a false flat, averaging 3.2%, before the finish at up.\nA group of thirteen riders formed the day's breakaway, with the group being initiated at the mark of the stage, with their advantage over the main field reaching a maximum of around nine minutes at the mid-stage point. moved to the front of the peloton as the first climb began, while at the front of the race, rider Jackson Rodríguez attacked on his own. He was followed up the climb by 's Tiago Machado, who had also attacked out of the group with Serge Pauwels of . The numbers in the peloton had reduced significantly thanks to the pace being set, before Rodríguez's team-mate Franco Pellizotti attacked from the group, beginning a chase of the leaders. Following his difficulties to remain with the overall contenders on the previous stage, defending Giro winner Ryder Hesjedal () again struggled to remain in contention, cracking on the climb. He lost almost 21 minutes by the stage's end.\nRodríguez began to suffer with mechanical problems on the descent from the climb, and after a change of machinery, he was joined by Pauwels at the front, after he had moved away from Machado; the duo reached the lower slopes of the final climb with a lead of around 2' 20\" over the main field, still being led by . This gap was wiped out before the steeper segments of the climb had commenced, with around remaining. Rigoberto Urán attacked several kilometres later, with forced to try and chase down the move for race leader Vincenzo Nibali, through domestique Valerio Agnoli. Urán held a lead of around 50 seconds at one point during his attack, and ultimately soloed away to the stage victory. Fellow Colombian rider Carlos Betancur () managed to get clear with around to go, and finished 19 seconds behind Urán, with the rest of the overall contenders coming across the line 12 seconds later, led home by Nibali. With eight bonus seconds gained at the line, Nibali extended his overall lead to 41 seconds over 's Cadel Evans, while Urán moved ahead of team-mate Bradley Wiggins into third place, by one second.\nStage 11.\nThe midway point of the race was marked by a transitional stage across the Friuli Venezia Giulia region, starting at the Cave del Predil around to the south of Tarvisio. After descending towards Tarvisio itself, the riders crested a small hill on the route at , before descending gradually for around . Having made their way through the feed zone at Ovaro – at the foot of the Monte Zoncolan, which featured in 2011 – the riders ascented the second-category Sella Ciampigotto, a rolling climb of around 4.5% in gradient. From there, the riders descended through the two intermediate sprint points – at Lozzo di Cadore and Pieve di Cadore – before the final kick up to the finish at Erto e Casso. The final climb was another rolling climb, with an average of around 5%, but the climb itself maxed out at 9% in places. The Vajont stage was held to commemorate victims of the Vajont Dam disaster in 1963, when a landslide caused major flooding in the Piave Valley, and the deaths of around 2,000 people.\nPrior to the start, it was announced that rider Sylvain Georges – who had been lying 81st overall – had tested positive for heptaminol after the seventh stage, and he failed to start the stage. With descending key to the first hour of racing, the peloton remained together for the duration, before a twenty-rider breakaway group was allowed to form at the mark; 20 of the 23 teams that started the race were represented, with only , and not represented. The highest placed rider within the group was 's Danilo Di Luca, who trailed overnight leader Vincenzo Nibali () by almost fourteen minutes overnight. The group built up a lead of around five minutes at the halfway point, prior to the day's first climb. After Stefano Pirazzi () extended his mountains classification lead by placing second to Jackson Rodríguez of at the summit, the group continued as one down the descent. The group held a lead of around five and a half minutes over the peloton, being led by , who were setting the pace for Nibali.\n rider Patrick Gretsch attacked the group, and set off to an advantage which eventually reached almost two minutes prior to the final climb. Di Luca tried to get away twice, but was unable to gain enough ground to breach the group; however, his move was the catalyst for another three riders to counter-attack, with 's Guillaume Bonnafond being joined by Ramūnas Navardauskas of  – who wore the \"maglia rosa\" during the 2012 Giro d'Italia – and Daniel Oss of the . Bonnafond could not remain with his rivals, and soon dropped back to the group while Navardauskas and Oss set off in chase of Gretsch, catching him with around to go. Gretsch struggled to contribute to the pace, and ultimately cracked prior to the final climb. Navardauskas dropped Oss with several sharp accelerations at the to go mark, and soloed away to his first Grand Tour stage win by over a minute from Oss. Pirazzi broke away from the chasing group to take third – further extending his mountains lead – while the remainder of the group came home in small packs. The peloton came home almost six minutes down, although the 's Beñat Intxausti was able to gain some time on the other overall contenders; a gap of 18 seconds was enough for Intxausti to move back into the top ten overall."

        "text": "Stage 12 of the 2013 Giro d'Italia was contested on 16 May, and the race concluded on 26 May. The second half of the race was almost entirely situated within Italy; it started with a categorised flat stage from Longarone to Treviso, before four mountain stages – as well as a mountainous individual time trial between Mori and Polsa – en route to the finish in Brescia, where the race concluded with a road stage for the first time since 2007. The race also crossed over into France during the fifteenth stage, ending with a summit finish on the Col du Galibier. After the second rest day of the race, the peloton returned to Italy in the following stage, from Valloire in France to Ivrea.\nHaving picked up the overall race lead after the eighth stage, rider Vincenzo Nibali was able to hold onto the race leadership for the entire second half of the Giro, and as a result, achieved the second Grand Tour general classification victory of his career; he had previously won the 2010 Vuelta a España for the team. Nibali held a 41-second lead margin over 's Cadel Evans until the fourteenth stage, when Nibali attacked on the final climb to the outside Bardonecchia, and was able to gain 45 seconds on Evans by finishing second to 's Mauro Santambrogio. Nibali later won two stages during the final week of the race, further extending his overall advantage, and eventually completed the race with a winning margin of close to five minutes. Evans was unable to hold onto second place overall, as he faded on the final climb of the race to Tre Cime di Lavaredo; he ultimately finished third overall behind rider Rigoberto Urán, who had become his squad's leader after Bradley Wiggins was forced to withdraw.\nAside from the overall race battle, Mark Cavendish was able to avenge his close defeat in the points classification at the 2012 race – where he lost the red jersey by a single point to rider Joaquim Rodríguez – by taking the classification on the final day in Brescia. The rider's victory in Brescia, his fifth of the race – he achieved three in the second half of the race, with other victories on stages 12 and 13 – allowed him to become only the fifth rider to complete a clean sweep of points classification victories at Grand Tours. Giovanni Visconti was another rider to take multiple victories during the second half of the race, taking solo victories at the Col du Galibier and into Vicenza. The second half of the race was also adversely affected by snow, with three stages being re-routed and a fourth having to be cancelled due to heavy snow and treacherous conditions; the cancelled stage was the first due to weather since the 1989 Giro d'Italia.\nStage 12.\nThe second half of the race started with a stage ideally favoured towards the sprinters; with a parcours of  – one of the shortest of the race – the stage was predominantly downhill from the start in Longarone, all the way to the finish in Treviso. Along the course, there were two fourth-category climbs alternating with the two intermediate sprint points – coming in the comunes of Pieve d'Alpago and Vidor respectively – within the opening two-thirds of the stage. The two categorised climbs were short and punchy; the Muro di Cà del Poggio averaged 12.2% over , while the Montello-Santa Maria della Vittoria ascented at an average of 6.3% over . Once the riders reached Treviso, they completed a loop around the city; the final metres involved the crossing of a bridge, before the line on the Viale Bartolomeo Burchiellati.\nWet conditions awaited the riders in Longarone, where the breakaway was initiated almost immediately after the start, with a four-rider move going clear. The breakaway was made up of ninth stage winner Maxim Belkov (), rider Fabio Felline, Bert De Backer of and 's Maurits Lammertink. Lammertink's team-mate Marco Marcato bridged the gap not long after, to make it a quintet. With a lead of nearly three-and-a-half minutes, all bar De Backer fell in the treacherous conditions, but were able to get back on their bikes not long after. The sprinters' teams slowly brought the lead group back, holding a 25-second lead going into the final loop around Treviso; the quintet managed to hold off until inside the final kilometre.\nFrom there, the lead-out train swooped to the front, with Gert Steegmans providing the perfect launch for Mark Cavendish to take his third stage win of the race, and what was to be the 100th win of his professional career. 's Vincenzo Nibali maintained his 41-second overall lead ahead of the 's Cadel Evans. Further behind, rider Bradley Wiggins suffered the most notable time loss during the stage. With no fewer than four team-mates around him, Wiggins lost 3' 17\" on the day to the main group, falling out of the top ten overall. Wiggins attributed his lack of performance to an ever-worsening medical ailment; he had been taking antibiotics due to him suffering from a cold and chest infection. Due to this, general manager Dave Brailsford stated that the team would now be backing Rigoberto Urán, lying third overall, as their best hope of winning the race.\nStage 13.\nAt , the thirteenth stage was also the longest stage of the 2013 Giro d'Italia. The parcours, which ran through six different regions, was flat from the start to around the point. From there, there were several uncategorised hills on the route, passing through the two intermediate sprint points – which were competed at the comunes of Castagnole delle Lanze and Alba respectively – before reaching the day's only categorised climb. The third-category Tre Cuni was seen as a potential danger for the sprinters – ahead of the finish in Cherasco – with a gradual rolling climb of around 5% over . From there, the riders descended towards the finish with several rolling hills in between; the expectations were still there for a sprint finish, but not a certainty. Prior to the start of the stage, former contenders for the overall classification, Bradley Wiggins () and Ryder Hesjedal () both withdrew from the race.\nA seven-rider group broke away from the peloton after around of racing, and with no potential contenders for the overall classification, the main field allowed the breakaway members to build up a lead of almost fourteen minutes at one point during the stage. With the main contenders unwilling to pull the gap back, it was left to the teams of the sprinters to set the pace; they did so gradually, with the leaders holding an advantage of just over a minute before the climb to Tre Cuni, around from the finish. On the climb, 's Nicola Boem initiated the first attack, and was joined by Pablo Lastras of the and Lars Bak (), with the trio pulling clear of the remaining four members of the lead group. A small group attacked the peloton behind, but after several kilometres off the front of the bunch, this group was pulled back, leaving the three leaders around thirty seconds clear.\n – looking to set up Mark Cavendish for a fourth stage win at the race – were stationed at the front of the peloton, and slowed the pace of the chase, and allowed the lead trio to gain several seconds of an advantage, pushing the lead out to almost a minute. Boem was dropped shortly after, while Lastras and Bak were joined by another group of riders, with seven going clear from the peloton. From the group, Giampaolo Caruso () attacked with remaining, but his solo bid for victory was stopped with left. led the field into the final kilometre for Elia Viviani, but Cavendish was first to launch his sprint, and was able to hold off the rest, just edging out Giacomo Nizzolo of on the line. With his fourth victory of the race, Cavendish became the sixth rider to win 40 Grand Tour stages, and the first rider to take successive Giro stages since Alessandro Petacchi in 2009.\nStage 14.\nOriginally due to be held over a parcours of , the fourteenth stage was altered on the morning of the stage, due to bad weather, which also precluded televised live pictures of the race for all but the final few hundred metres. The originally-scheduled climb to Sestriere, a second-category gradual ascent, was removed from the itinerary, with the peloton being re-routed along roads in the Susa Valley to Oulx. The race rejoined the original itinerary at Oulx; in total, was added to the stage distance. From there, the parcours rose to steadily to an intermediate sprint at Bardonecchia, before the climb to the finish on the . A first-category climb for its third appearance in the Giro, the Jafferau averaged a 9% gradient over , with places reaching 14% and portions of the climb being run on unsurfaced roads.\nA group of seven riders went clear after around of racing, but this was quickly reduced to four, as three riders fell on wet roads. When they had recovered to the main field, the lead group started to increase their advantage. The all-Italian group – former race leader Luca Paolini (), Daniele Pietropolli of , rider Sonny Colbrelli and 's Matteo Trentin – were able to extend their advantage to almost ten minutes at one point before the peloton started to bring them back. As the race moved towards the Jafferau, took up station on the front of the peloton, slimming the numbers in the main group. Before the final climb, Trentin was dropped by his three companions, and was soon caught by the main field on the climb.\nThe leaders held a lead of around four minutes at the foot, at which point, Colbrelli attacked. Only Paolini could stay with him, as they set about trying to hold off the front. Sergio Henao () attacked halfway up the climb, where he was joined by Diego Rosa of ; Rosa's move was the precursor of an attack by his team captain Franco Pellizotti. Pellizotti caught the duo, and soon set off alone after the leaders, pulling within two minutes before being caught. Paolini dropped Colbrelli with around remaining, and held a 43-second lead over the fast-closing chasers. After Paolini was caught, \"maglia rosa\" wearer Vincenzo Nibali attacked for , pulling 's Mauro Santambrogio with him. The two remained clear until the end, with Santambrogio taking the stage win, his first in a Grand Tour. Nibali finished close behind, to extend his overall lead to 1' 26\" over 's Cadel Evans, with Santambrogio moving into fourth overall, one second behind Rigoberto Urán of .\nStage 15.\nOriginally due to be held over a parcours of , the stage was slightly shortened due to snow on the Col du Galibier. The snow forced organisers to move the stage finish further down the climb, to the memorial in honour of Marco Pantani. Pantani soloed to a stage victory after attacking on the Col du Galibier during the 1998 Tour de France, before winning at Les Deux Alpes; the catalyst to his overall victory in the race. At one point, both the Col du Galibier and the day's opening climb, the Col du Mont Cenis, were reportedly off the itinerary due to the atmospherical conditions, but both were eventually ascended during the stage. The first-category Col du Mont Cenis climb started in Italy, and crossed over into France with a gradual -long climb, averaging around 6.2%, before the race descended down towards Saint-Michel-de-Maurienne, and the start of the second-category Col du Télégraphe. The Col du Télégraphe averaged 7.2% over nearly , although reaching 11% in places. After a slight descent to Valloire, the Col du Galibier ascent commenced, with almost covered before the finish.\nWith continued uncertainty about the safety of the Col du Mont Cenis, racing was neutralised until near the top of the ascent, where mountains classification leader Stefano Pirazzi () attacked with 's Robinson Chalapud. The duo were joined on the descent by five more riders as the peloton allowed them to gain a lead of over two minutes. rider Pieter Weening soon went off the front on his own, but could not force the pace by himself and soon fell back to rejoin the rest of the breakaway. The group held a maximum lead of over six minutes, but it was around a third of that by the time they reached the Col du Télégraphe. Pirazzi and Weening were strongest in the early kilometres, before Giovanni Visconti () and 's Matteo Rabottini were able to join back up with them. Visconti dropped his breakaway companions with around remaining, setting off on a solo effort. Rabottini tried to chase him on the descent from the Télégraphe, but ultimately, Visconti soloed to his first Grand Tour stage win. Rabottini's resolve lasted until inside the final kilometre when he cracked, and allowed a group of four riders to do battle for second. 's Carlos Betancur won the sprint for second place ahead of 's Przemysław Niemiec, and Rafał Majka of ; with the 12 seconds on offer for second, Betancur moved into the white jersey as young rider leader, ahead of Majka. The overall contenders group came across the line 54 seconds down on Visconti.\nStage 16.\nThe final week of racing commenced after the race's second rest day the previous day; the sixteenth stage was a transitional stage, returning to Italy following the Col du Galibier finish of the previous stage. Starting in Valloire, the parcours of began with a descent from the Col du Télégraphe, going in the opposite direction from the way that the peloton had climbed previously. Having reached Saint-Michel-de-Maurienne, the parcours sloped up again towards Modane and onwards to the Mont Cenis, this time in reverse, crossing back into Italy. From the foot of the climb, there was around of relatively flat terrain before reaching the finish town of Ivrea for the first time. From there, a loop was tackled, which contained a third-category climb. The climb, the Andrate, averaged around 8% in gradient – reaching 13% in places – and was expected to deny the sprinters of any chance of winning the stage. The day's breakaway was formed prior to the Mont Cenis, when an attack by 's Wilco Kelderman instigated a move of sixteen riders in total, while six more riders were able to bridge up towards the leaders before they had reached the summit of the climb.\nThe 22-man lead group held an advantage of around three minutes over the top, with the lead continuing to increase on the descent into Italy. were stationed on the front of the peloton, and were later joined by and to take up some of the pace-making, when the lead advantage had reached five minutes; this margin was putting the highest-placed riders from those teams – Yuri Trofimov and Robert Kišerlovski – in danger from 's Damiano Caruso, who was in the breakaway. The lead gap had been more than halved by the time the field reached the first intermediate sprint with around remaining, in the comune of Agliè. Counter-attacks were key on the run-in towards Ivrea for the first time; after several mini-attacks, rider Emanuele Sella was the first to gain a manageable advantage over the rest of the breakaway.\nHe was later joined by Kelderman and 's Danny Pate, and they were around twenty seconds clear as they hit Ivrea. A five-rider group made contact on the final climb, among whom was mountains classification leader Stefano Pirazzi (), who continued to extend his points lead. The remnants of the peloton had also caught up with the leaders, with young rider leader Carlos Betancur of leading Pirazzi over the summit. All the main contenders for the race were up front, with the exception of 's Mauro Santambrogio, who would ultimately lose over two minutes on the day. A group of three riders managed to get clear in the closing stages, where Beñat Intxausti () won the sprint ahead of 's Tanel Kangert and Przemysław Niemiec of . Intxausti saluted his former team-mate Xavier Tondo while coming across the line; crossing his fingers to form an X, in honour of Tondo, who was killed prior to a training ride with Intxausti in May 2011.\nStage 17.\nWith the exception of the final stage of the race heading into Brescia, the seventeenth stage marked one of the last opportunities for a sprinter to prevail in the 2013 Giro d'Italia. Starting in the Lombardy comune of Caravaggio, the parcours of in length, was predominantly a flat, transitional stage, except for a fourth-category climb towards the end of the stage. Following the two intermediate sprint points in San Bonifacio and Orgiano, the climb of the Crosara was narrow and technical; averaging 6.8% over the course of  – with portions of the climb reaching 12% in gradient – meaning that teams would have to take extra care in consideration of the climb, hoping to keep their sprinters in check prior to the descent and finish into Vicenza.\nIn the early kilometres, the day's breakaway was formed as Luke Durbridge (), Maxim Belkov of , rider Gert Dockx and 's Miguel Ángel Rubiano went clear. The quartet's lead reached a maximum of around five minutes at the midpoint of the stage, but was gradually reduced from then on. took station on the front of the peloton, in the hope of keeping points classification leader Mark Cavendish in contention for the stage victory; other sprinters' teams also helped to bring the time gap down. Belkov was first to be dropped, after falling into difficulty with around remaining. The other three riders from the lead group held an advantage of around one minute as they hit the foot of the Crosara. Cavendish ran into trouble on the climb, but remained as leader of the points classification overnight.\nRubiano lifted the pace, which saw Dockx being dislodged from the front, while a second burst of acceleration saw his only other lead companion, Durbridge, being dropped as well. launched a two-pronged attack through Alessandro Proni and Danilo Di Luca, with Di Luca forcing himself clear in chase of Rubiano; he caught him with just under remaining, when Giovanni Visconti () attacked from the peloton, joining quickly after bridging the 30-second gap. Visconti attacked over the top of the climb solo, gaining a maximum advantage of 35 seconds, but did enough to hold on, despite nearly crashing, for his second stage win in four days – his team's third in succession, after Beñat Intxausti's win on stage 16 – by 19 seconds. 's Ramūnas Navardauskas led the main group across the line in second, mistakenly believing he had won the stage, while the main contenders were also positioned within the group, leaving the general classification unchanged.\nStage 18.\nThe second of two individual time trials to be held in the 2013 Giro d'Italia, the eighteenth stage was deemed as a mountainous time trial – the form of the discipline returning to the race after a one-year hiatus – in the Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol region, in northern Italy. The parcours of was split into several distinct sections; starting at the velodrome in Mori, the opening kilometre of the stage was on a false flat, before an , 6.6% climb towards the intermediate time-check at Brentonico. An undulating false flat section in the middle portion was then covered, before a steeper climb to the finish in Polsa; the slopes hit 10% at one point during the climb, but again averaged 6.6% over around . As was customary of time trial stages, the riders set off in reverse order from where they were ranked in the general classification at the end of the previous stage.\nThus, Rafael Andriato of , who, in 172nd place, trailed overall leader Vincenzo Nibali () by three hours, fifty-six minutes and fifty seconds, was the first rider to set off on the stage. Andriato was not the first rider to reach the line, as rider Miguel Mínguez – who started directly behind him on the road, at a one-minute interval – passed him and went on to record a time of 48' 55\" for the course. Mínguez's time held for around quarter of an hour until Steve Cummings took the lead for the , when he recorded a time for the course of 47' 08\". Eros Capecchi was first to break 47 minutes for the , before 's Dario Cataldo – the Italian national time trial champion – assumed the top position with a time of 46' 10\". rider Stef Clement was the next rider to record the quickest time, achieving a time five seconds clear of Cataldo, setting a time of 46' 05\".\nDamiano Caruso () broke into the 45-minute region with the next quickest time for the course, with the weather conditions changing around the time that he was reaching the finish in Polsa. From the sun that had greeted the earlier runners on the course, the weather worsened and soon heavy rain was falling. Caruso's time was ultimately good enough for third on the stage; the first rider to beat the time was 's Samuel Sánchez, who recorded a time of 45' 27\", a time which enabled him to move into the top ten in the general classification. However, the best performance was left to the overall leader, Nibali. Setting the best time at the intermediate time-check, Nibali completed the course in 44' 29\", to take his third Giro stage victory. He also managed to get within 24 seconds of catching his main rival for the general classification, 's Cadel Evans, who had started three minutes before him. As a result, Nibali's overall lead grew to 4' 02\" over Evans, with rider Rigoberto Urán ten seconds further back in third.\nStage 19.\nThe nineteenth stage was scheduled to be the queen stage of the 2013 Giro d'Italia, covering a distance of between Ponte di Legno and Val Martello. However, much like the previous weekend's stages to Bardonecchia and the Col du Galibier, the scheduled route was affected by poor weather conditions; race organisers had been expecting snow to fall on the potentially key mountain stages. This materialised, and as such, the two main climbs for the day – the -long Passo di Gavia and the Passo di Stelvio (the scheduled \"Cima Coppi\" for the Giro), the highest two climbs of the race – were removed from the route. A revised route was released the night before the scheduled start of the stage.\nAlong with the extension of the stage by , two new climbs were added to the route. The second-category Passo del Tonale was set to test the riders – the 7.5% average climb of , coming inside the opening of the stage – while the first-category Hofmahdjoch, 9.5% over , was due to be ascented halfway through the stage. Further adverse conditions overnight dropped even more snow on the scheduled itinerary, and ultimately, race organisers cancelled the stage on safety grounds; the first weather-related cancellation of a stage in the Giro since 1989 – when the sixteenth stage was cancelled – and the first cancellation of any form since 2001, when the peloton refused to race in the eighteenth stage, after drug raids. Competing riders and teams supported the decision that the race organisers made in relation to the stage.\nLater in the day, it was announced that rider Danilo Di Luca had tested positive for the banned glycoprotein hormone erythropoietin (EPO) – which controls red blood cell production – during an out-of-competition drugs test held a week in advance of the race. After receiving notification of his rider's positive test, team manager Angelo Citracca stated that Di Luca had been sacked – after less than a month with the squad – and that they were launching legal proceedings against Di Luca. Di Luca – who had previously served a fifteen-month suspension after testing positive for continuous erythropoietin receptor activator (CERA) at the 2009 Giro d'Italia – himself expressed his \"surprise\" at the positive test, while race director Michele Acquarone angrily chastised Di Luca at a press conference, describing him as \"stupid\".\nGeneral classification after cancellation of stage 19\nStage 20.\nLike several other stages to be held during the second half of the 2013 Giro d'Italia, the penultimate stage of the race had to be re-routed due to unfavourable weather conditions which resulted in potentially dangerous riding conditions. The original parcours of was slightly lengthened to , but it also meant that three of the five originally-scheduled climbs of the route being removed; the first-category Passo Giau was bypassed, along with the second-category ascents of the Karerpass and the Passo di San Pellegrino. With the previous day's cancellation of the Passo di Stelvio, the climb to Tre Cime di Lavaredo became the \"Cima Coppi\". The was the first part of the climb, averaging 7.2% over , before a false flat to the short, steep Col Sant'Angelo. The final climb averaged over 11% for the final , but reached 18% in places.\nThe day's breakaway was formed after around of racing, with a four-rider group consisting of earlier stage winner Adam Hansen (), Pavel Brutt of , rider Yaroslav Popovych and 's Giairo Ermeti. The quartet built up a lead of more than eight minutes at one point during the stage, before the peloton – being led by , and  – set about reducing that advantage. As the leaders reached Cortina d'Ampezzo, their advantage was around three minutes; upon leaving the comune, Popovych attacked his companions. Brutt and Hansen were able to bridge back up, before Brutt attacked of his own accord. He quickly gained an advantage of around a minute over the others, when rider Pieter Weening attacked from the peloton, closely followed by mountains classification leader Stefano Pirazzi () and Darwin Atapuma of . Weening caught up with Hansen, and the duo set off in chase of Brutt, with the peloton around one minute behind the leader, and closing on the climb.\nBy the top of the Passo Tre Croci, Brutt was around 30 seconds clear of Weening – who had dropped Hansen – with the leaders group a further 20 seconds behind. In the driving snow, Brutt was caught with around remaining by Weening, Pirazzi, 's Gianluca Brambilla and the 's Eros Capecchi. Capecchi launched a move at the bottom of the final climb, gaining ground from the others, but behind, Vincenzo Nibali, in the \"maglia rosa\" for , was pulled clear from the peloton by team-mate Tanel Kangert. Nibali was joined by Colombian duo Rigoberto Urán () and Carlos Betancur () for a period, and after catching Capecchi, Nibali launched another attack, soloing away to his second consecutive stage victory, and all but securing the race overall. 's Fabio Duarte bridged up to his compatriots, and ultimately won the sprint for second place, seventeen seconds behind, ahead of Urán and Betancur. In the general classification, Nibali extended his overall lead to 4' 43\" over Urán, who had moved ahead of 's Cadel Evans – who cracked on the climb – for second place overall. Betancur was another mover; he moved from seventh to fifth overall, and reclaimed the lead of the young rider classification from rider Rafał Majka.\nStage 21.\nAfter the previous five editions of the Giro d'Italia had finished with individual time trial stages, the 2013 edition ended with a mass-start road stage. With no categorised climbs on the route, and very little in the way of undulation during the parcours, it was widely expected to finish in a mass sprint finish in Brescia. Once the riders had reached Brescia, the peloton had to complete eight laps of a -long city centre circuit, with the race's final intermediate sprint coming on the third passage through the finish line. Going into the stage, the points classification was also set to be settled, as overall leader Vincenzo Nibali () held an eleven-point advantage over 's Mark Cavendish, with 41 points on offer during the stage. With little competition in the stage, the field remained together all the way to Brescia.\nCavendish had reduced the gap in the classification to three points, after taking the honours in the opening intermediate sprint at Sirmione. 's Stefano Garzelli was allowed to head into Brescia on his own, in his final Giro d'Italia, before took up the head of the pace again. Giairo Ermeti () attacked for the second day running, and once Cavendish had chased him down and taken the second batch of eight points at the other intermediate sprint, the group came back together for the eventual final sprint. led into the final kilometre for Cavendish, with in tow for Elia Viviani; after Matteo Trentin pulled off, Cavendish launched his sprint and despite competition from 's Sacha Modolo, achieved his fifth stage win of the race, to become the fifth rider to win the points classification at all three Grand Tours. Nibali finished within the peloton to take the general classification, and his second Grand Tour overall win, after the 2010 Vuelta a España. 's Carlos Betancur and Stefano Pirazzi () also confirmed their respective wins in the young rider classification and the mountains classification."

He scored centuries (100 or more runs in a single innings) in Test cricket and One Day International (ODI) matches on 11 and 16 occasions, respectively. Described by BBC Sport as \"one of the best one-day batsmen New Zealand has ever produced\", Astle is the fourth-highest run-scorer for his country in international cricket.\nAstle made his ODI debut against the West Indies at Eden Park, Auckland, in January 1995. His first century came the same year against India at the Vidharba Cricket Association Ground, Nagpur. Opening the batting, he made 114 runs from 128 balls in the match which New Zealand won. He scored a century against England in the 1996 Cricket World Cup. Astle's match-winning innings of 119 against Pakistan was included among the 100 best ODI innings of all time by \"Wisden\" in 2002. He scored his second World Cup century when he made 102 against Zimbabwe in the 2003 tournament. His highest score of 145 not out was made against the United States in the 2004 Champions Trophy. In ODIs, Astle scored the most (five) centuries against India. He ended up in the nineties on nine occasions, including twice where he remained not out.\nAstle made his Test debut against Zimbabwe in 1996, a year after he started playing international cricket. The same year he was picked up for the West Indies tour in which he scored back-to-back hundreds. His highest score of 222 (off 168 balls) was made against England at the Jade Stadium, Christchurch, in 2002. In the course of the innings, he set two records—fastest double-century scored in Test cricket, and the second-highest individual score in the fourth innings of a Test match. Astle played four Twenty20 International matches between 2005 and 2006 without scoring a century. His highest score in the format was 40 not out."

        "text": "Rod Taylor (born December 1, 1966) is an American former professional ice hockey player. Taylor played twelve years in the East Coast Hockey League, scoring 689 points in 678 games. He is the second all-time career scorer in the ECHL and was inducted to the ECHL Hall of Fame in 2009. In 2019, he became head coach of the Norfolk Admirals in the ECHL.\nCareer.\nAfter four years at Ferris State University, Taylor joined the Hampton Roads Admirals of the East Coast Hockey League on December 14, 1991. With the exception of a recall to the AHL's Baltimore Skipjacks during the 1992-93 AHL season, Taylor spent nine seasons with the Admirals, leading the team in scoring five times, and winning two ECHL championships (Riley Cup, 1992; Kelly Cup, 1998.) He remaining with the team until the Admirals until the team suspended operations after the 1999-2000 ECHL season. Taylor holds several Admirals' franchise records, including career goals scored, points scored, and games played.\nTaylor joined the nearby Richmond Renegades for the 2000-01 ECHL season, scoring 56 points in 61 games. On December 29, 2000 Taylor scored his 326th ECHL goal, surpassing the career mark set by former Renagades' forward Trevor Jobe. Taylor returned to the Renagades for the 2001-02 ECHL season. Despite scoring near a point-per-game pace during the first fifteen games of the season, Taylor was benched with rumors starting that Taylor might be traded for the first time in his professional career.\nTaylor joined the South Carolina Stingrays for the 2002-03 ECHL season. As a member of the Stingrays, Taylor set another career ECHL record. On January 29, 2003 Taylor assisted on a goal scored by Ryan Brindley, giving Taylor his 686th career point, passing the career mark previously set by Darryl Noren. Following the game, Taylor's game-worn jersey was immediately shipped to the Hockey Hall Of Fame in Toronto. Several weeks after setting the ECHL's all-time scoring record, the Stingrays place Taylor on waivers. After being waived by the Stingrays, Taylor joined the Peoria Rivermen on March 7, 2003. After scoring one assist in two games, Taylor was waived by the Rivermen due to the team not being able to guarantee him a spot on the playoff roster. Taylor joined the Toledo Storm on March 22, 2003, signing as a free agent. He played two games with the team but did not score any points. After twelve years in the ECHL, Taylor retired after the 2002-03 season.\nTaylor's points scoring record lasted for ten months, with then-Mississippi Sea Wolves forward Louis Dumont breaking the record on November 20, 2003 after he knocked in a rebound for his 690th career point.\nTaylor briefly came out of retirement to play for the Richmond Riverdogs of the United Hockey League in 2005. The 39-year-old Taylor played one game and scored two goals.\nAfter his retirement, Taylor returned to the Hampton Roads area. He was named to the ECHL Hall of Fame in 2009. Joining the Hall of Fame with Taylor was former coach John Brophy, who coached Taylor during his tenure with the Hampton Roads Admirals.\nMany of Taylor's ECHL records remained unbroken for several years. Taylor held the ECHL goal-scoring record for twelve years until Alaska Aces forward Wes Goldie scored his 369th ECHL goal against the Ontario Reign on March 24, 2012."

        "title": "Fungo golf",
        "text": "Fungo golf is a game involving two or more players in which they use fungo bats and baseballs and their object is to hit certain objects at a field. Fungo golf is played very similar to golf, where the player with the fewest strokes after a certain number of holes (typically nine or eighteen) wins the game. While there is no concrete history of how fungo golf was created, it has spread throughout America as a popular game especially with baseball players and coaches.\nMethod of play.\nTo figure out who shoots first, players usually throw or roll a baseball to a certain object (usually at close range) and whoever is closest shoots first. The first person then gets to choose the first hole and tees off. To tee off (and for most shots) players hit the ball like they were playing baseball, but depending on the distance from the hole the player may choose to ‘putt’ the ball instead of hitting it. To putt the ball, the player places the ball on the cup (the end of the fungo bat), and can toss the ball from the cup in hopes of getting a more accurate shot. In shooting or putting, the player must have one foot where the ball landed during the entire duration of their swing or putt, failure to keep the foot planted results in a loss of a stroke. Scorekeeping is identical to traditional golf; the player with the fewest strokes essentially wins the hole. Players traditionally play nine or eighteen holes of fungo golf, and at the end the person with the fewest strokes in the set number of holes wins the game.\nAnother variation of playing is setting a target (i.e. home plate), and that is the hole for the entire game. For the entire game players go to a different part of the field and try to hit home plate in the fewest strokes. To make the game more interesting players can create certain hazards or obstacles that the players must avoid hitting while making their shot. If a player hits a certain hazard then they may be penalized one stroke, a player can also lose a stroke if he loses their ball while taking a shot.\nPlayers can also create complex holes such as ‘two-part holes’ where the players must hit or reach one object before attempting to shoot at the hole. For example, a ‘two-part hole’ could consist of hitting the scoreboard first, and then once they have hit the scoreboard they must hit the ball back to home plate, that would be one hole with the player with the fewest strokes winning the hole. ‘Two-part holes’ are typically saved for the last hole in order to make things more complex and difficult on the leader.\nIf there is a tie, the players are forced to play in sudden death where the winner of the next hole wins the game. The two players can agree upon a hole for the sudden death round, or if there is a player who is not playing they may choose the hole. The players will keep playing until there is a winner."

        "title": "Rhythmic Gymnastics World Cup",
        "text": "The Rhythmic Gymnastics World Cup is a competition for rhythmic gymnastics sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG). It is one of the few tournaments in rhythmic gymnastics officially organized by FIG, as well as the World Championships (including the Junior World Championships), the gymnastics competitions at the Olympic Games and the Youth Olympics, and the rhythmic gymnastics events at the World Games. The World Cup series should not be confused with the Rhythmic Gymnastics Grand Prix series, which is neither officially organized nor promoted by FIG.\nHistory.\nIn 1983, FIG decided to hold a World Cup event in rhythmic gymnastics. The event was staged as an alternative to the World Championships, a tournament held, at the time, every four years. The World Cup aimed to bringing together elite gymnasts in all around competition and in apparatus finals. Standalone World Cup tournaments were staged in 1983, 1986 and 1990, and have been retroactively called World Cup Finals by the International Gymnastics Federation.\nTaking inspiration from the Grand Prix series established in 1994, the FIG Executive Committee made the decision to revive the World Cup in 1999 as a series of tournament which served as qualification stages, over the course of two years, for a World Cup Final event. The different stages, sometimes referred to as World Cup qualifiers, mostly served the purpose to award points for individual gymnasts and groups according to their placement. These points would be added up after a period of two years in order to qualify a limited number of athletes for the biennial World Cup Final event.\nFive World Cup Final events were staged in even years from 2000 to 2008. For example, the World Cup Final tournament in 2000 served as the last stage of a series of competitions through the 1999–2000 season. At the World Cup Final, gold, silver and bronze medals were awarded to individual athletes (in four different apparatuses) and groups (in two different routines) after a qualification phase and a final presentation. The World Cup Final format was kept until 2008; the International Gymnastics Federation has decided not to host a single, standalone World Cup Final event after the 2008 World Cup Final.\nSince 2009 the World Cup is staged through a series of events held annually, as opposed to the biennial format adopted from 1999 to 2008, or the standalone event format adopted from 1983 to 1990.\nCurrent format.\nThe current format of the World Cup divides the tournament in a series of events staged annually. In each of the stages, the top three gymnasts or groups in each apparatus, as well as in the all-around competition, are awarded medals and prize money. The stages usually attract the best rhythmic gymnasts in the world, with a considerable number of medalists at the Olympic Games and the World Championships competing in each event. FIG may also allow federations to organize parallel events to the World Cup series, such as junior tournaments. These tournaments, however, are not official FIG competitions and are not considered part of the World Cup Series.\nAfter each stage, gymnasts are awarded points according to their placement (not only in medal positions) in the all-around and each of the four apparatuses. Groups are also awarded points according to placement in the all-around competition and each of the two routines. After the last event of the World Cup series, the 3 or 4 best results at the World Cup stages count towards a ranking list. The same is true for the World Challenge Cup series. The individual gymnast (or group) with the highest number of points in each apparatus (or each routine) is then declared the winner of the World Cup series. A separate ranking also defines the winners in each apparatus (or each routine) of the World Challenge Cup series. Winners receive a cup at the end of the series.\nEvents.\nWorld Cup Final.\nThere were eight Rhythmic Gymnastics \"World Cup Finals\" held between 1983 and 2008. On the first three occasions, 1983, 1986 and 1990, the World Cup was held as a stand-alone event. From 1999 to 2008, each \"World Cup Final\" was held in an even-numbered year following a two-year long series that served as the qualification stages for the final event. The first \"World Cup Final\" using this format, formally considered the \"Fourth World Cup Final\", was staged in 2000, following the 1999–2000 series; the last \"World Cup Final\" took place in 2008, at the end of the 2007–08 series. \"World Cup Finals\" are no longer held for any of the FIG disciplines.\nWorld Cup qualifiers.\nFrom 1999 to 2008, a series of World Cup qualifiers were staged. The top 3 gymnasts or groups in each apparatus at the qualifier events would receive medals and prize money. Gymnasts or groups that finished in the top 8 would also receive points that would be added up to a ranking which would qualify individual gymnasts for the biennial World Cup Final.\nWorld Cup series.\nSince 2009, the World Cup has been competed as a series of events held in different countries throughout the period of one year. From 2009 to 2016, the Rhythmic Gymnastics World Cup events were divided into Category A events (reserved for invited athletes only) and Category B events (open to all athletes). The format of the World Cup series was changed in 2017, when it was divided into: 1) the World Cup series; and 2) the World Challenge Cup series. All of the World Cup and World Challenge Cup events are open to all athletes.\nHosts.\nA number of nations across three different continents have hosted the events, including the World Cup Finals, World Cup qualifiers, as well as the World Cup and World Challenge Cup stages from 1983 to 2024. Notably, the International Gymnastics Federation has never appointed nations from Africa, Oceania and South America as hosts of the World Cup or World Challenge Cup events.\nAll-time medal table.\nWhat follows is a table containing the total number of medals earned historically at the World Cup and World Challenge Cup events. Results accounted for include: 1) the eight editions of the World Cup Final from 1983 to 2008; 2) all of the stages from the World Cup series (including World Cup qualifiers from 1999 to 2008) up to 2023; and 3) all of the stages from the World Challenge Cup events, since 2017. Results from the 1999 and 2001 World Championships, events that counted points for the ranking in their respective years, have not been taken into account. Overall, the total number of nations is considerably smaller when compared to the number of nations which earned at least one medal at the Artistic Gymnastics World Cup circuit."

        "text": "The Rhythmic Gymnastics Grand Prix circuit is an annual competition of tournaments in rhythmic gymnastics open to gymnasts from all over the globe. The series consists of a number of stages in different countries in Europe. The Grand Prix circuit usually hosts some of the most watched yearly events in rhythmic gymnastics, frequently gathering some of the best gymnasts in the world. Each Grand Prix stage is held as an all-around qualification competition, followed by four apparatus finals with hoop, ball, clubs and ribbon. The final event in the circuit is commonly referred to as \"Grand Prix Final\". The focus in each stage is on individual performances, though groups have also been allowed to compete in some stages since, at least, 1995. The Grand Prix circuit should not be confused with the Rhythmic Gymnastics World Cup series, which is a competition officially organized by the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG), whereas the Grand Prix is neither organized nor promoted by FIG.\nHistory.\nThe Grand Prix circuit was established in 1994. The then vice-president of the International Gymnastics Federation, Hans-Jürgen Zacharias, and Robert Baur, came up with the idea of a series of events held in different cities, and the rules were drafted in the course of many meetings with the European Union of Gymnastics (UEG). The objective was to bring together the elite of international Rhythmic Gymnastics, as well as rising stars. The best gymnasts in the world were to be included in a ranking and prize money was also to be paid. Nations which have hosted Grand Prix stages include Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, France, Germany, Israel, Netherlands, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Russia, and Ukraine.\nGrand Prix circuit.\nEach year, a number of stages that go from a minimum of three to a maximum of ten, are staged across different countries in Europe. Individual gymnasts perform in an all-around competition that also serves as qualification for apparatus finals. In the early editions of the Grand Prix, a separate all-around final was also staged. The closing event of the circuit is commonly referred to as \"Grand Prix Final\". Until 2005, gymnasts earned points in each stage and only the highest ranked gymnasts were allowed to compete in the Grand Prix Final. Although group events have taken place at the same venues where the Grand Prix Final is staged, there is a strong focus on individual performances, with groups often not being considered part of the official Grand Prix competition.\nAll-time medal table.\nWhat follows is a table containing the total number of medals earned by individual gymnasts representing their nations in every stage of the Rhythmic Gymnastics Grand Prix circuit from 1994 to 2023. The results accounted for include only senior medalists in the regular stages of the circuit, as well as the Grand Prix Final. Group events, either at official Grand Prix competitions or international tournaments held alongside Grand Prix stages, were not taken into consideration.\nGroup events.\nOrganizers of Grand Prix events are also allowed to hold extra events for groups on the same venue. In the early editions, the group competitions were staged as parallel events (usually in the form of international tournaments) that were intertwined with individual performances during the Grand Prix competitions. In 2003, an official Grand Prix event especially for groups was held in Sofia, Bulgaria. Since 2016, organizers can also register a Grand Prix competition in groups. Nations which have earned at least one medal on senior level, either in international tournaments or official Grand Prix stages, since 1995, include:"

She eventually lost in the quarter-finals to Paola Suárez.\nGrass court season.\nSharapova won her first title for the year in Birmingham, defeating Tatiana Golovin in the final in three sets. At Wimbledon, Sharapova was seeded 13th, meaning she could have faced a potential fourth round meeting against the French Open champion, Anastasia Myskina, who had defeated her in Australia earlier in the year. However, Sharapova was able to take advantage of Myskina's early exit to reach the quarter-finals, where she dropped her first set of the tournament to Ai Sugiyama, before winning in three sets. In the semi-finals, she faced 1999 champion Lindsay Davenport, trailing by a set and a break before making a comeback to prevail in three sets after the rain appeared to halt Davenport's momentum.\nThe final saw Sharapova face two-time defending champion Serena Williams, who had defeated her in Miami earlier in the year, in what was their first meeting. Williams entered the match as the favourite, but Sharapova would produce a stunning straight-sets victory to become the third-youngest woman (after Lottie Dod and Martina Hingis) to triumph at Wimbledon. The victory was hailed by the media as \"the most stunning upset in memory\". By virtue of winning Wimbledon, Sharapova would enter the Top Ten for the first time in her career, and would remain there until January 2009, when she decided not to defend her 2008 Australian Open title due to a serious shoulder injury.\nUS Open series.\nSharapova entered the US Open as the seventh seed, but she was defeated in the third round by Mary Pierce.\nFall series.\nDuring the fall of the season Sharapova played and won consecutive titles at the hansol korea open and at the japan tennis championships thus extending her title tally to 4 .She also reached the final of the zurich open defeating venus williams en route but eventually lost to alicia molik in three tight sets.\nWTA Tour Championships.\nSharapova qualified for the year-end WTA Tour Championships by virtue of her impressive season, which saw her capture four titles for the year to date. She was drawn in the Black Group along with Amélie Mauresmo, US Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova and Vera Zvonareva. Sharapova won two of her three matches, the only loss coming to Mauresmo in her first match. Sharapova qualified for the semi-finals after finishing second in the group behind Mauresmo; thus, the semi-final saw her drawn against French Open champion and Red Group leader Anastasia Myskina, which she won in three sets.\nThe final saw her up against Serena Williams for the third time in the year. After losing the first set, and trailing 0–4 in the final set, Sharapova defeated her for the second (and to date last) time this year, to become the second player in WTA Tour Championships history to win the title on her first attempt (Petra Kvitová would later achieve this feat in 2011, Dominika Cibulková in 2016 and Ashleigh Barty in 2019). She would finish the year ranked World No. 4, and be recognised by the WTA as the \"Player of the Year\" and \"Most Improved Player of the Year\". Additionally, she would earn $2,506,263 in prize money, the most by any player this year.\nAll matches.\nThis table chronicles all the matches of Sharapova in 2004, including walkovers (W/O) which the WTA does not count as wins.

In the final, she faced Belgian Justine Henin-Hardenne, who had previously captured the title in 2003 (and would do so again in 2007), and recorded an impressive straight sets victory to claim her second Grand Slam title at just 19 years of age.\nFall series.\nAfter her success at the us open she won back to back titles at the tier 1 Zurich Open by defeating Shahar Pe'er, Timea Bacsinszky, Katarina Srebotnik, Daniela Hantuchova.

        "text": "Kevin Foster (born June 17, 1990) is an American professional basketball player who last played for Beşiktaş of the Turkish Basketball League (TBL). The shooting guard played college basketball for Santa Clara University between 2008–09 and 2012–13. Foster made 431 three-point field goals in his career, which is tied for the fourth-most all-time in NCAA Division I history. He finished his collegiate career as Santa Clara's all-time leading scorer with 2,423 points, which is also the most in San Francisco Bay Area Division I history and second most in West Coast Conference history. Foster holds a rare distinction of being named a most valuable player (MVP) in two different postseason tournaments: the 2011 CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament (CIT) and the 2013 College Basketball Invitational (CBI), both of which Santa Clara won.\nHigh school career.\nFoster, a native of Katy, Texas, attended Morton Ranch High School. As a junior he was named to the All-District 18-5A First Team and the All-Greater Houston Second Team. In his senior year, Foster averaged 21 points per game and was named the MVP and All-District 18-5A First Team. He was also a Texas top-30 player his final season.\nCollege career.\nIn his freshman season in 2008–09, Foster averaged 14.7 points and 2.5 assists per game and was named the WCC Co-Newcomer of the Year, WCC All-Freshman Team and Freshman All-American Team. He broke Kurt Rambis' freshman year scoring record, Steve Nash's single-season three-pointers made record and four other freshman class records in the process. In his true sophomore year, he only played in six total games before suffering a season-ending foot injury, so he was able to redshirt the 2009–10 season.\nIn 2010–11, Foster was named to the WCC First Team after leading all of Division I in three-pointers made (140), attempted (380), and made per game (3.68). The Broncos were invited to participate in the 2011 CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament, which they won behind Foster's play as he was named its MVP. The following season, Foster was suspended for the rest of the season by the school after he was arrested for drunk driving in January 2012. He managed to play in only 18 games before the incident.\nFoster's senior year in 2012–13 saw the Broncos finish with a 26–12 overall record en route to the 2013 CBI championship, where he was named its MVP. He averaged 19.3 points and 4.3 assists per game during the season. Milestones for Foster that season include scoring his 2,000th career point, breaking the conference record for three-pointers made, and eventually becoming the school's all-time leading scorer with 2,423 points.\nProfessional career.\n2013–14 season.\nFoster went undrafted in the 2013 NBA draft. On July 29, 2013, he signed with Beşiktaş of Turkey for the 2013–14 season. However, he later parted ways with Beşiktaş on October 29, 2013 after appearing in just two Eurocup games. That same day, he signed with Skyliners Frankfurt of the Basketball Bundesliga. His contract with Skyliners was voided a day later after he did not pass the medical examinations.\nOn February 7, 2014, Foster joined BK Ventspils of Latvia for a 10-day trial period but was ultimately not signed by the club.\n2014–15 season.\nOn November 1, 2014, Foster was selected by the Reno Bighorns in the fourth round of the 2014 NBA D-League draft. However, he was later waived by the Bighorns on November 13, 2014.\nThe Basketball Tournament.\nKevin Foster played for Team Tampa 20/20 in the 2018 edition of The Basketball Tournament. He scored 11 points and grabbed five rebounds in the team's first-round loss to Ram Nation."

It was contested by England, France, Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales. Including the competition's previous incarnations as the Home Nations Championship and Five Nations Championship, it was the 120th edition of the tournament.\nGoing into the final day, three teams could have still won the championship – Ireland, England and France. In the final game, Ireland hung on to win against France by just two points and secure the championship, on points difference over England.\nThis was their first championship since 2009, and the 12th title they have won, including predecessor championships.\nThe final game also saw the retirement of Brian O'Driscoll from international rugby, with a record number of 141 international caps – 133 for Ireland (83 as captain), and 8 for the British and Irish Lions.\nEngland won the Triple Crown by beating Wales, Scotland and Ireland – they became the first team to win the Triple Crown while another of the Home Nations won the championship outright.\nThe 2014 tournament saw 12 players earn their first cap – three English, four French, two Scottish, one Irish, one Italian and one Welsh. Sergio Parisse and Martin Castrogiovanni became the most-capped Italian players with 105 caps, with Gethin Jenkins earning the same number to become the most-capped Welsh player. In their match against Wales on 1 February, Italy broke the world record for the most-capped starting pack with 587 caps, surpassing the previous record of 546 caps as held by New Zealand.\nIn line with a global change to the Television Match Official (TMO) protocol, this was the first Six Nations tournament where the TMO could be called upon to review up to two phases prior to a try being scored and to review potential instances of foul play occurring at any time during the match.

        "text": "Rafael Montero (born October 17, 1990) is a Dominican professional baseball pitcher for the Houston Astros of Major League Baseball (MLB). Montero signed with the New York Mets as an international free agent in 2011, and made his MLB debut with them in 2014. He has also played in MLB for the Texas Rangers and Seattle Mariners.\nMinor League career.\nMontero signed with the New York Mets as an international free agent on January 20, 2011. Nearing his 21st birthday he signed at a much older age than most Dominican players. In his first professional season he went 5-4 with a 2.15 ERA and 66 strikeouts in 71 innings.\nIn 2012, Montero went 11-5 with a 2.36 ERA, with 110 strikeouts and 19 walks in 122 innings. Prior to the 2013 season, \"Baseball America\" ranked him as the Mets' fifth best prospect. He started the season with the Double-A Binghamton Mets. He was promoted to Triple-A Las Vegas 51s in June.\nIn 2013, with Binghamton and Las Vegas went 12-7 with a 2.43 ERA with Binghamton and a 3.05 ERA with Las Vegas, with 150 strikeouts and 35 walks in 154.4 innings pitched.\nMajor League career.\nNew York Mets.\n2014.\nMontero was promoted on May 14, 2014, with Dillon Gee going to the disabled list with a lat strain. Montero started against the New York Yankees at Citi Field on the same day. In the top of the third inning, he struck out shortstop Derek Jeter for his first major league strikeout on a 3-2 fastball. He earned his second strikeout against Brett Gardner in the top of the fifth inning. Montero earned the loss as the Mets lost 0-4 as he pitched six innings giving up 5 hits, 3 runs, 2 home runs, 2 walks and struck out 3. He was sent down on May 31 to make room for Buddy Carlyle on the roster. On August 11, pitcher Jacob deGrom went on the disabled list with rotator cuff tendinitis. Montero was called up on August 12 in deGrom's place. On August 23, Montero was re-sent back to the 51s to make room for deGrom coming off the disabled list. He was recalled on September 6 as part of the September call-ups. He was later moved to the bullpen on September 13. Montero finished the season with a 1-3 record, 4.06 ERA in 10 games with 42 strikeouts in 44.1 innings pitched with a WHIP of 1.511 while giving up 44 hits, 21 runs (20 of them earned), 8 home runs, and 23 walks.\n2015.\nOn April 17, 2015, he was sent down to the 51s to make room for Danny Muno. He was recalled up on April 27 to replace Muno on the roster. A day later he was once again sent down as Jack Leathersich was called up. On April 29, it was discovered that his rotator cuff was swelling and placed on the disabled list. He was placed on the 60-day disabled list on July 24. Montero would never pitch again in 2015. Montero finished the season with a 0-1 record, 4.50 ERA in 5 games (one start) with 13 strikeouts in 10 innings pitched with a WHIP of 1.400 while giving up 9 hits, 6 runs (5 of them earned), and 5 walks.\n2016.\nMontero began the 2016 season with the 51s. He was called up on April 12, with Eric Campbell being demoted to the 51s. Montero made one start with an ERA of 8.02 pitching 19 innings while giving up 23 hits, 17 runs (all earned), 4 walks and 16 strikeouts.\n2017.\nIn 2017 he was 5-11 with a 5.52 ERA.\n2018: Lost season.\nMontero underwent Tommy John Surgery after suffering a UCL tear and missed the entire 2018 season. He elected free agency on November 3, 2018.\nTexas Rangers.\n2019.\nOn December 4, 2018, Montero signed a minor-league deal with the Texas Rangers. Starting on June 17, Montero made appearances for the AZL Rangers, Frisco RoughRiders, and Nashville Sounds as he made his way back from Tommy John surgery. On July 22, 2019, the Rangers selected Montero's contract and promoted him to the major leagues. With Texas in 2019, Montero went 2–0 with a 2.48 ERA and 34 strikeouts over 29 innings.\n2020.\nThe following year, he was 8-for-8 in save opportunities, the first saves of his major league career, as he recorded a 4.08 ERA and 1.02 WHIP in innings during the pandemic-shortened season.\nSeattle Mariners.\nOn December 15, 2020, Montero was traded to the Seattle Mariners in exchange for Jose Corniell and a player to be named later (PTBNL). The PTBNL, Andres Mesa, was sent to Texas on June 14, 2021.\nIn 40 games for the Mariners, Montero struggled to a 7.27 ERA with 37 strikeouts. On July 23, 2021, Montero was designated for assignment by the Mariners.\nHouston Astros.\n2021.\nOn July 27, 2021, Montero was traded to the Houston Astros along with Kendall Graveman in exchange for infielder Abraham Toro and pitcher Joe Smith. He made four appearances for Houston, allowing one unearned run over six innings, three hits, two walks, and struck out five.\n2022.\nMontero avoided arbitration with the Astros on March 22, 2022, agreeing to a $2.275 million contract for the season. He earned his first save of the season on April 28 pitching in the ninth versus the Rangers, while yielding a home run to Corey Seager before closing out a 3–2 win.\nMontero struck out two on July 3 in a 4–2 victory over the Los Angeles Angels in which Astros pitchers struck out 20 batters to establish a franchise record in a nine inning contest. Contributing were starter Framber Valdez (first six innings), Héctor Neris (7th), Montero (8th) and Ryan Pressly (9th). On August 15, Montero endured a rare collapse as he was charged three of four runs in the eighth inning without having recorded an out, taking the loss in a 4–2 defeat versus the Chicago White Sox. On August 31, 2022, Montero closed out the ninth versus the Rangers for his tenth save, the first time he had recorded double-figures in saves in a season. \nOver the 2022 regular season, Montero made 71 relief appearances and accumulated innings, 2.37 ERA, 14 saves, and 5–2 W–L record, and allowed 47 hits, three home runs, and 23 bases on balls with 73 strikeouts. He ranked third in the AL in pitching appearances, and tied for seventh in holds (23), and ranked second on the Astros pitching staff in both holds and saves.\nMontero made his postseason debut on October 11, 2022, in Game 1 of the American League Division Series (ALDS). He pitched a clean ninth inning and was the winning pitcher in an 8–7 Astros' walk-off win over the Mariners. Montero appeared in each game of the ALDS, delivered shutout innings, allowed three total baserunners, and struck out three batters.\nOn November 2, 2022, Montero relieved Bryan Abreu in the eighth inning of Game 4 of the World Series, with a no-hitter on the line. Montero came close to allowing a hit with two outs in the inning on a line drive to right field, but it was caught with ease by right fielder Kyle Tucker. Montero was then relieved by Ryan Pressly for the 9th inning, who completed the no-hitter. The Astros defeated the Philadelphia Phillies in six games to give Montero his first career World Series title.\nFollowing the World Series, Montero became a free agent.\n2023.\nOn November 15, 2022, Montero re-signed with the Astros on a 3-year, $34.5 million contract.\nPersonal life.\nMontero and his wife, Yasmina, have one daughter who was born in 2020."

Due to lack of finances with ownership the team was to stop playing, but since he wasn't getting his just due to play, Smith decided he would go play for free along with 4 other teammates to gain much needed experience &amp; playing time. It proved worth it with Smith averaging 28 ppg &amp; 8 apg with 4 rpg in 4 games.

The Bulldogs played their home games at Hinkle Fieldhouse, which has a capacity of approximately 10,000. This was the first year that Butler competed in the Big East Conference, as they moved from the Atlantic 10 Conference following the 2012–13 season.\nThe Bulldogs started the season off great and were cruising into their inaugural Big East conference games. However, once they started playing their in-conference games, they fell fast. Many of the games were characterized by leads late in the second half that the Bulldogs couldn't sustain and resulted as losses in either the last minute or overtime. Some of the games also resulted in blowouts. The Bulldogs were also faced with some player transfers and other adversity; Andrew Smeathers and Rene Castro announced at various points during the season that they were transferring. Castro and Kameron Woods also faced suspensions from the team at various points during the season. The Bulldogs made an early exit in the Big East tournament, losing to Seton Hall in the first round, 50–51.\nThe season was the Bulldogs' first losing season since the 2004–05 season, and only the second in the past 21 years. It was also the first time in the past nine seasons that Butler did not win a game in the conference tournament.\nOff season.\nDuring the offseason, Butler suffered two major blows. First, on July 3, 2013, head coach Brad Stevens left to take the vacant head coaching job with the NBA's Boston Celtics. Stevens was succeeded by Butler assistant Brandon Miller, hired three days later. The second blow came on August 16, when the school announced that Roosevelt Jones, the team's leading returning scorer from 2012 to 2013, tore ligaments in his left wrist during the team's trip to Australia and would undergo surgery that would force him to miss the entire season.\nRegular season.\nOn November 4, 2013, after the two exhibition games, junior Andrew Smeathers announced that he was leaving the team. He finished the fall semester and transferred to Mount St. Mary's. On February 15, it was announced that freshman Rene Castro was transferring to another school. He had been suspended for three games during the season and according to Miller, was \"dealing with a disciplinary team issue.\" Junior forward Kameron Woods was also temporarily suspended during the season; he did not make the trip to New York to play St. John's.\nThe team finished the season losing to Seton Hall in the first round of the Big East Championship.\nRegular season.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=| Australia Exhibition Trip\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#13294B; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#13294B; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Non-Conference Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#13294B; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Big East Conference Play\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#13294B; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Big East tournament"

        "title": "Colombia at the FIFA World Cup",
        "text": "This is a record of Colombia's results at the FIFA World Cup. The FIFA World Cup is an international association football competition contested by the men's national teams of the members of \"Fédération Internationale de Football Association\" (FIFA), the sport's global governing body. The championship has been awarded every four years since the first tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946, due to World War II.\nThe tournament consists of two parts, the qualification phase and the final phase (officially called the \"World Cup Finals\"). The qualification phase, which currently takes place over the three years preceding the finals, is used to determine which teams qualify for the finals. The current format of the finals involves 32 teams competing for the title, at venues within the host nation (or nations) over a period of about a month. The World Cup Finals is the most widely viewed sporting event in the world, with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the 2006 tournament final.\nColombia has appeared in the FIFA World Cup on six occasions in 1962, 1990, 1994, 1998, 2014 and 2018.\nOverall record.\nColombia at the 1962 FIFA World Cup.\nIn the 1962 qualifiers, they faced Peru in a two-game series and qualified for their first World Cup.\nColombia qualified.\nAt Chile 1962, Colombia lost 2–1 to South American champions Uruguay in their opening match. They then drew 4–4 with the reigning European champions Soviet Union in one of biggest shocks at Chile 1962. In this game, Colombia scored four goals against Soviet goalkeeper Lev Yashin, widely considered the best goalkeeper in football history. Also in that game, Marcos Coll scored the only Olympic goal in World Cup history. Additionally, in coming back from three goals down to draw the match, the Colombians completed the biggest comeback to draw in World Cup history. Unfortunately, their campaign ended with a 5–0 defeat to Euro 1960 runners-up Yugoslavia, so they went out in the group stage.\nGroup One\nColombia at the 1990 FIFA World Cup.\nAt Italia '90, Colombia defeated United Arab Emirates 2–0, lost to Yugoslavia 1–0, and earned their place in the Round of Sixteen after a dramatic 1–1 draw with West Germany, which would later win the Cup.\nGroup D\nDuring their Round of Sixteen match against Cameroon, the game went into extra time after a 0–0 draw. In an unfortunate moment, goalkeeper René Higuita failed to protect the ball from the goal line, enabling Cameroon striker Roger Milla to snatch it from him, and score Cameroon's decisive second goal. Milla struck twice, giving Cameroon a 2–0 lead in extra time. Colombia would score in the 115th minute, but were unable to get an equalizer.\nColombia at the 1994 FIFA World Cup.\nQualification — CONMEBOL Group One\nColombia qualified. \"Argentina\" advanced to the CONMEBOL / CONCACAF / OFC Intercontinental Play-off.\nColombia finished top of their qualifying group without having lost a match, which included a historic 5–0 win over Argentina in Buenos Aires. Expectations of the team were high, some even naming them as favourites to win the tournament.\nThe match between Colombia and Romania was the first game for either side in the group phase. Romania took the lead in the 16th minute with their first attack of the match when Raducioiu took on three defenders before firing home a low shot. On the half hour mark, Hagi made it 2–0 when he noticed Córdoba out of position and dipped a cross over his head into the net. Valencia pulled a goal back for the Colombians in the 43rd minute when he headed in a corner from Perez. In the second half, Raducioiu put the result beyond doubt with his second goal in the final few minutes.\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe team went into their second group game against the United States knowing they had to win to have any chance of progressing. On the 35th minute Andrés Escobar attempted to cut out a cross but accidentally deflected the ball into his own net. Earnie Stewart took the US two goals in front after scoring in the 56th minute. Valencia scored a consolation goal for Colombia in the closing minutes of the match.\nThey did win their final group match 2–0 over Switzerland, but it was not enough to help them progress\nGroup A\nAndrés Escobar.\nSix days after Colombia's last match against Switzerland, Andrés Escobar was shot in Medellín by known drug cartel criminals. Escobar had previously scored an own goal in the group stage match against the United States.\nColombia at the 1998 FIFA World Cup.\nColombia began their qualification rounds in South America well and ended in third place with 28 points, 2 points below Argentina who was in 1st place with 30 points. They ended in Group G with Tunisia, England, and Romania.\nQualification For France 98: A total of 10 CONMEBOL teams entered the competition. The South American zone was allocated 5 places (out of 32) in the final tournament. Brazil, the defending champions, qualified automatically, leaving 4 spots open for competition between 9 teams.\nArgentina, Paraguay, Colombia and Chile qualified.\nGroup G\nIn their opening match, Adrian Ilie of Valencia CF gave Romania a 1–0 victory over Colombia after he placed a magnificent chip shot in the 44th minute from some that sailed over goalkeeper Faryd Mondragón into the net.\nColombia's second match was against Tunisia. Colombia's Léider Preciado struck seven minutes from the end to give a 1–0 win.\nAlthough England needed only a draw to guarantee a place in the final 16, Darren Anderton drove home a fiercely struck angled drive in the 20th minute. David Beckham curled in a free kick nine minutes later and England won the game 2–0. Colombia was thus eliminated.\nColombia at the 2014 FIFA World Cup.\nAfter 16 years out of the World Cup, Colombia won their first match against Greece by a score of 3–0, marking the country's best ever performance in FIFA World Cup. The first goal was scored by Pablo Armero five minutes after the kick-off, Teofilo Gutierrez scored the second goal from a corner shot, James Rodriguez made their final score during the three minutes overtime. Colombia went on to beat Ivory Coast 2-1 and Japan 4–1. For the first time in history, Colombia won their group in group stages at the Fifa World Cup. They defeated Uruguay 2–0 in the Round of 16, marking the deepest run in the World Cup ever for the Colombia national team. They met Brazil in the quarter-finals and were narrowly defeated 2–1, bringing to an end their most successful World Cup campaign to date.\nBrazil (host), Argentina, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador and Uruguay qualified.\nThe two teams had met in one previous match, in a friendly in 1994, where Colombia won 2–0. Colombia midfielder Fredy Guarín was suspended for the match, after being sent off in the team's final qualifier against Paraguay.\nColombia took the lead within five minutes, Juan Cuadrado's cutback was converted by Pablo Armero via a deflection off Greek defender Kostas Manolas. Colombia extended the lead in the second half, when Abel Aguilar flicked on a corner kick from James Rodríguez and Teófilo Gutiérrez scored from close range.\nGreece's best chance fell to Theofanis Gekas, who headed against the bar. In stoppage time, Cuadrado set up James to complete the scoring with a low shot.\nThe 3–0 scoreline was Colombia's biggest win to date in the World Cup.\nThe two teams had never met before.\nAfter a goalless first half, Colombia scored first when James Rodríguez headed in Juan Cuadrado's corner.\nThe lead was extended six minutes later when Ivory Coast was caught in possession, and Teófilo Gutiérrez released substitute Juan Quintero to score. Ivory Coast reduced the deficit through Gervinho, who received a pass from Arthur Boka in the left wing, dribbled past three Colombian players and shot home.\nThe second goal of the tournament by James allowed him to join Bernardo Redín and Adolfo Valencia as the only Colombian players to score more than one goal in the World Cup.\nThe two teams had met in two previous matches, most recently in a friendly in 2007, and also in the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup group stage, won by Colombia 1–0.\nColombia took the lead mid-way through the first half, with Juan Cuadrado taking a penalty kick, shooting low down the middle after Japan centre back Yasuyuki Konno fouled Colombia striker Adrián Ramos in the box.\nJapan then equalised through Shinji Okazaki's headed goal from a cross from Keisuke Honda on the right in first half stoppage time. Colombia's James Rodríguez was introduced after the half time break, and was credited for providing two assists for two goals scored by Jackson Martínez, on 55 minutes when he shot low to the net with his left foot, and 82 minutes when he curled the ball in from the right of the penalty area with his left foot, before finishing off the scoring with a strike of his own, assisted by Ramos, where he beat the last man before clipping the ball over the goalkeeper. Colombia, which had already qualified for the knockout stage but needed a point to be certain of winning the group, finished as group winners with a perfect record of three wins out of three, while Japan, which had to win the match to have any chance to qualify, were eliminated.\nFaryd Mondragón became the oldest player to make an appearance in the history of the World Cup, at the age of , when he came on for the last five minutes of the match, breaking the record of Roger Milla, who played at the 1994 World Cup at the age of 42. He also set the record for the longest time between World Cup appearances as 15 years and 363 days had passed since his last versus England at the 1998 World Cup, breaking Alfred Bickel's record of 12 years and 13 days between appearances (1938–1950).\nThe two teams had met in 38 previous matches, including in the 1962 FIFA World Cup group stage, won 2–1 by Uruguay. Their most recent meetings were in the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, with both teams winning at home, Colombia winning 4–0 and Uruguay winning 2–0. Uruguayan striker Luis Suárez was not in the line-up because of a nine-game ban imposed by FIFA due to a biting incident involving Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini during their final group stage match.\nColombia won 2–0 with both goals from James Rodríguez, the first in the 28th minute, where he controlled Abel Aguilar's headed ball on his chest before volleying left-footed from 25 yards out with the ball going in off the underside of the crossbar, which won the 2014 FIFA Puskás Award later in the year.\nThe second goal, in the 50th minute, was a close-range shot from six yards out after receiving the ball from a header by Juan Cuadrado on the right.\nColombia progressed through to the quarter-finals for the first time in their history, where they would face Brazil.\nThe two teams had met in 25 previous matches, but never in the FIFA World Cup. This was the first time Colombia had reached the quarter-finals of the World Cup. Brazil midfielder Luiz Gustavo was suspended for the match due to accumulation of yellow cards.\nBrazil took the lead in the 7th minute, when Neymar's corner from the left was turned in from close range by Thiago Silva.\nThey doubled the lead in the 69th minute when David Luiz scored directly from a long-range free kick, side-footing the ball over the wall and into the top-right corner. Colombia reduced the deficit with 10 minutes to go, when James Rodríguez converted a penalty kick low into the left corner and sent the goalkeeper the wrong way. The penalty was awarded after substitute Carlos Bacca was fouled by Brazil goalkeeper Júlio César. Neymar was kneed in the back by Colombia defender Juan Camilo Zúñiga in the 88th minute, which resulted in the striker's withdrawal from the match. Subsequent medical evaluation discovered a fractured vertebra, forcing the Brazilian to miss the remainder of the tournament. Brazil advanced to the semi-final, where they faced Germany.\nJames's sixth goal of the tournament was enough for him to win the Golden Boot award. He also became the first player to score in his first five career World Cup matches since Peru's Teófilo Cubillas (across the 1970 and 1978 tournaments).\nColombia at the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\nFinal standings\nGroup stage\nThe two teams had met in three previous matches, most recently in a 2014 FIFA World Cup group stage game, won by Colombia 4–1.\nIn the third minute, Carlos Sánchez blocked Shinji Kagawa's 20-yard shot with his arm and the referee pointed to the penalty spot before showing the midfielder a straight red card. After lengthy protests, Sanchez eventually left the field and Kagawa slotted the penalty into the bottom right corner of the net. José Pékerman then replaced Juan Cuadrado with Wílmar Barrios at the half-hour mark, and an equaliser arrived nine minutes later, from a Juan Fernando Quintero free kick, shot low under the jumping wall which the goalkeeper failed to keep out. In the second half, David Ospina dived full length to his left to stop Takashi Inui's curling 20-yard shot. Yuya Osako then headed the ball into the far corner of the net from a Keisuke Honda corner from the left. With 13 minutes left, James Rodríguez's strike from inside the box was turned over the crossbar by the outstretched leg of Osako.\nThe two teams had met in five matches, most recently in a 2006 friendly, won by Colombia 2–1.\nAbel Aguilar was taken from the field on a stretcher in the 32nd minute and was replaced by Mateus Uribe. Shortly after, a cross by James Rodríguez from the right was met by the head of Yerry Mina, who lost his marker to head over Wojciech Szczęsny's outstretched arms and into the net. Juan Fernando Quintero fired wide from 25 yards at the start of the second half. Cuadrado then squared to Radamel Falcao on the edge of the box who lifted his shot well over the crossbar. In the 58th minute, Robert Lewandowski controlled a long pass only to shoot straight into David Ospina's midriff as Poland attempted their first shot on target of the game. Quintero's slide-rule pass presented Falcao with a one-on-one situation and he guided the ball past Szczęsny with the outside of his right foot to double his side's lead. With 15 minutes left on the clock, James' pass from the left found Cuadrado in space through the middle and he took a touch before finishing it into the bottom-right corner of the net.\nPoland were the first European nation to be eliminated from the 2018 World Cup. Including Colombia's victory against Poland, there were 14 World Cup goals scored on 24 June 2018 - the most on a single day of action in the competition (maximum 3 games) since 10 June 1990 (also 14).\nThe two teams had met only once, a 2014 friendly game which ended in a 2–2 draw.\nThe referee awarded Senegal a penalty in the 17th minute. After consulting VAR, he judged that defender Davinson Sánchez had won the ball before making any contact with Sadio Mané. After half an hour, James Rodríguez was substituted with what appeared to be a recurrence of the injury that kept him out of Colombia's 2–1 loss to Japan. Mané took a free-kick in the 64th minute which he shot off-target. Kalidou Koulibaly got a touch on a Luis Muriel drive to deflect the ball narrowly wide. And in the 74th minute Colombia scored the decisive goal of the game, Juan Quintero's corner from the right found Yerry Mina who rose and crashed home a header that went through goalkeeper Khadim N'Diaye.\nWith Senegal being the last African team to be knocked out of Russia 2018, there were no teams from Africa in the Round of 16 for the first time since the stage was introduced in 1986. Colombia were the only team to reach the knockout stages of Russia 2018 despite losing their opening match of the tournament. Senegal became the third team to be eliminated from Russia 2018 despite winning their opening game of the tournament (also Iran and Serbia); and even moreover, this was the first time Senegal got eliminated from the group stage, despite owning a huge advantage prior to the match against Colombia. The last time as many as three teams failed to get through the group stages despite winning their opener was in 2002 (Argentina, Costa Rica and Russia).\nThe teams had faced each other in five previous matches, including one World Cup group stage match in 1998, a 2–0 England win. Their most recent meeting came in a friendly in 2005, a 3–2 England win.\nIn the 16th minute, Harry Kane arrived beyond the back post to meet a Kieran Trippier cross, but was unable to direct his header on target. Wílmar Barrios was booked when he appeared to headbutt Jordan Henderson in the build-up to a free-kick Trippier bent narrowly wide. Colombia gave away a penalty early in the second half when Carlos Sánchez dragged Kane down in the box after a corner from the right. Kane scored from 12 yards, shooting down the middle to give England the lead. Colombia forced their way into extra-time, Yerry Mina scoring a downward header from a Juan Cuadrado corner from the right. Eric Dier scored the final penalty in the shoot-out, England came from 3–2 down after Mateus Uribe and Carlos Bacca failed to convert their spot-kicks.\nThis was the first time that England had won a penalty shoot-out at the FIFA World Cup, and only the second time they had won on penalties at any major tournament (the previous occasion being against Spain at Euro 1996). Kane became the first player to score in six consecutive England appearances since Tommy Lawton did so in 1939. England conceded in injury time at the end of the second half for the first time in World Cup history, with Mina's goal coming after 92 minutes and 33 seconds.\nSquads.\n1962 World Cup.\nHead coach: Adolfo Pedernera\n1990 World Cup.\nHead coach: Francisco Maturana\n1994 World Cup.\nHead coach: Francisco Maturana\n1998 World Cup.\nHead coach: Hernán Darío Gómez\n2014 World Cup.\nHead coach: José Pékerman\n2018 FIFA World Cup.\nHead coach: José Pékerman\nGoalscorers.\nColombia's record World Cup scorer, James Rodríguez, has also won the Golden Boot when he scored 6 goals in the 2014 FIFA World Cup.\nAwards and records.\nTeam Awards\nIndividual Awards\nRecords"

        "text": "Jennifer Snow Lee (born 15 August 1965) is a Hong Kong equestrian.\nPersonal life.\nLee is a native of Virginia in the United States. She is married to Sam Lee Kwok-Tung, a Hong Kong Chinese man, with whom she has two children, and moved to Hong Kong with him in 1994.\nEquestrian career.\nLee began representing Hong Kong in equestrian competition at the international level soon after her arrival. She won medals in every competition in which she participated since 2001, held Hong Kong's high jump record, and was ranked 11th in the world in the International Federation for Equestrian Sports' World Jumping Challenge.\nWith Lee's skill, and equestrian at the 2008 Summer Olympics being held in Hong Kong rather than Beijing with the rest of events, it was a natural next step for her to attempt to participate, but her road to the Olympics was filled with obstacles. Lee, along with fellow U.S. citizen showjumpers Jennifer Chang and Charlotte Morse and U.K. citizen dressage rider Aram Gregory, were not successful in obtaining special dispensations from the International Olympic Committee to compete for Hong Kong without holding Chinese nationality. Among them, Lee and Gregory chose to apply to for naturalisation as Chinese nationals to the Hong Kong Immigration Department, which is authorised by Beijing to process Chinese nationality applications from Hong Kong residents. People of Chinese descent born in Hong Kong are permitted to hold multiple citizenship; however, applicants for naturalisation are required to renounce all other citizenships they hold. This was a difficult decision for Lee, in particular due to her concerns about her ability to travel back to her former home to care for her ageing parents; the U.S. is alone among Western countries in not granting visa-free treatment to holders of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region passports, meaning she would have to apply for a United States visa, and could face the possibility of rejection.\nLee was approved for naturalisation in July 2008, but her quest to represent Hong Kong at the Olympics finally faced an insurmountable barrier in the form of an injury to her horse, Mr Burns. The horse was in Belgium undergoing pre-export quarantine at the time. Lee's withdrawal meant that Hong Kong would not field an Olympic show jumping team; Lee's fellow show jumpers Kenneth Cheng, Samantha Lam, and Patrick Lam would go on to compete as individuals.\nLee went on to compete for Hong Kong at the 2010 Asian Games in Guangzhou. She made another attempt to enter the Olympics as a member of the Hong Kong show jumping team which participated in team selection trials for the 2012 Summer Olympics. Lee did well individually, with 17 penalties over two rounds placing her at 17th among 37 contestants, but other members of her team had worse luck, and in the end they failed to qualify."

Brown played 128 games over a nine-year career, winning the 1972 and 1973 premierships with Manly. His position of choice was on the .\nBrown was also the founder of the Men of League foundation in 1999.\nCareer.\nCanterbury-Bankstown.\nBrown, a goal kicking winger, was a Canterbury-Bankstown junior and made his first grade debut in 1966. He was the Berries (as the Bulldogs were then known) top try scorer in 1967 scoring 10 tries, but injury kept him out of the teams finals campaign, which famously included stopping the St. George Dragons in the preliminary final, ending the Dragons bid for a 12th straight premiership. Canterbury would go down 10–12 to the South Sydney Rabbitohs in the Grand Final.\nMax Brown played a further 3 seasons with Canterbury, totaling 24 tries and 6 goals from 64 games before signing to play with Manly from 1971.\nManly-Warringah Sea Eagles.\nBrown was signed by Manly boss Ken Arthurson and for five years played alongside the likes of Graham Eadie, Ken Irvine, Bob Fulton, Terry Randall, and English hard man Mal Reilly. He was a member of the Sea Eagles first two premiership's in 1972 and 1973 over Eastern Suburbs and Cronulla respectively and was the Sea Eagles leading goal kicker in 1972 with 29 goals.\nBrown, who in an era when foul play was still rife in rugby league, wasn't one who often got involved in dirty play, though he did hit replacement Cronulla fullback Rick Bourke with a swinging arm as Bourke crossed for Cronulla's only try of the 1973 Grand Final at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Bourke was flattened and Brown broke his right thumb in the incident. Some 30 years later Brown was able to catch up with Bourke and apologise for the incident (the 1973 GF was known as the toughest of them all with many fights breaking out during the game).\nMax Brown retired from playing after 1975. He played 128 games in 9 seasons (64 for both Canterbury and Manly), scoring 44 tries and kicking 39 goals.\nPersonal life.\nBrown, like South Sydney's dual international winger Michael Cleary, sometimes worked as a model outside of the game at a time when working class rugby league players didn't do such things, and years before players such as Andrew Ettingshausen and Craig Wing were able to use their good looks to earn a living away from rugby league.\nMen of League.\nIn 1999 Max Brown was diagnosed with cancer that he had reportedly had for over 7 years (it was only found out when the tumor burst inside him resulting in emergency surgery). The cancer was believed to have been caused by a simple rub down cream he and other players had been using for years after training and games. Brown was forced to take over 6 months off from work while he was undergoing treatment, and it was during this time that he came up with the idea for the Men of League foundation to assist rugby league players, coaches, referees, officials and administrators – from all levels of the game – plus members of their families who have fallen on hard times\nAfter struggling to get the foundation up and running for six months, Brown, Jim Hall and Ron Coote contacted current National Rugby League auditor Ian Schubert who jumped on board and helped organise the first ever Men of League function at the NSW Leagues Club in Sydney."

        "text": "Atlético Petróleos de Luanda, commonly known as Petro de Luanda, is an Angolan basketball club based in Luanda. It competes at the local level, at the Luanda Provincial Basketball Championship and at the Angola National Basketball Championship. Additionally, the club plays at the continental level, at the Basketball Africa League (BAL).\nEstablished in 1976, the team is part of a multi-sports club which includes a football and handball team as well. Petro has been one of the most successful teams in Angola, having won the second most Angolan championships with 16 titles, trailing only Primeiro de Agosto, and sharing the record for most Angolan Cups with 14 cups. The team has won two continental titles as well, having won the FIBA African Champions Cup in 2006 and 2015.\nHistory.\nThe Atlético Petróleos de Luanda club was founded on 14 January 1980 from the merger of three clubs, Grupo Sonangol, Clube Atlético de Luanda and Benfica de Luanda. The establishment was a result of business cooperation after the independence of Angola from colonisation by Portugal. Another reason was that the country's oil company aimed to reintegrate with the community through sports. The club started with football before later establishing its basketball section.\nPetro de Luanda won its first Angolan Basketball League in 1989, which was followed by seven more championships, as well as six Angolan Cups, during the 1990s. \nDuring the 2000s, Petro won the league championship in 2006 and 2007 but saw arch-rivals Primeiro de Agosto win most of the trophies this decade. On 26 November 2006, Petro de Luanda won its first-ever continental title after winning the 2006 FIBA Africa Clubs Champions Cup in Lagos. They beat Primeiro de Agosto in the final, and Mílton Barros was named the tournament MVP.\nThe 2010s were more balanced for the Angolan League in term of competition, with Petro winning the 2011, 2015 and 2019 title. On 19 December 2015, they won their second continental title after taking the 2015 FIBA Africa Clubs Champions Cup at home in Luanda. Under head coach Lazare Adingono, Petro defeated another Angolan team Rec do Libolo in the final. American point guard Manny Quezada received MVP honours.\nAs the champions of the 2018–19 national championship, Petro qualified for the inaugural season of the Basketball Africa League (BAL). The BAL was a new initiate co-organised by FIBA Africa and the NBA. \nIn September 2020, Petro announced the signing of Brazilian head coach José Neto. Under Neto, a period of domination on the national level began.\nIn the 2021–22 season, Petro won the triple crown; winning its 15th national title, the Angolan Cup and the Supercup. In all league games, Petro was unbeaten and had a 31–0 record including the playoffs. In the same season, Petro had another successful run in the BAL which ended with them losing the finals to US Monastir. Ahead of the finals, head coach José Neto won the inaugural BAL Coach of the Year award.\nIn 2023, Petro de Luanda won its 14th Angolan Cup, overtaking Primer de Agosto to become the club with the most cup titles in the country's history. In the following 2023–24 season, Petro struggled in the Kalahari Conference of the BAL with a 2–2 record. On March 20, 2024, Petro announced it had terminated its contract with José Neto, ending his four-year tenure as head coach. Sergio Valdeolmillos was hired as the team's new coach four days later.\nPlayers.\nCurrent roster.\nThe following is Petro de Luanda's roster for the pre-season of the 2023 BAL season."

        "text": "Andrei Andreyevich Mironov (; born 29 July 1994) is a Russian professional ice hockey defenceman who is currently under contract to Dynamo Moscow of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). He was selected by the Colorado Avalanche, 101st overall, in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft.\nPlaying career.\nMironov played as a youth within his hometown Moscow, and was drafted in the fourth round, 103rd overall in the KHL Junior Draft by Dynamo Moscow in 2011. As a defensively minded player on the blueline, he appeared in the Minor Hockey League with HC MVD junior club in the 2011–12 season. He made his senior KHL debut playing with Dynamo during the 2012–13 KHL season. Appearing in an impressive 40 games, for 5 assists, and in all 18 post-season games, Mironov contributed to help Dynamo capture the Gagarin Cup in his first professional season.\nMironov was signed by Dynamo Moscow to a two-year contract extension on 12 September 2013. Having established his role as a regular on the blueline of Dynamo as an 18-year-old, Mironov improved his point totals in the following season with 3 goals and 7 assists in 46 games.\nAt the conclusion of his third season in the KHL in which he was a selection to the 2015 KHL All-Star Game, Mironov was swiftly signed to a two-year contract extension with Dynamo Moscow on 22 April 2015. After he was passed over in the three preceding drafts, Mironov was selected 101st overall by the Colorado Avalanche, marking their first Russian selection since 2004, in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft on 27 June 2015.\nIn the 2016–17 season, Mironov was limited to just 18 games contributing with 4 points due to injury. He returned to health in the post-season for Dynamo, before losing in the Conference semi-finals to eventual champions SKA Saint Petersburg. With the Avalanche signalling strong interest to bring Mironov over to North America, Mironov was released from the remainder of his contract with Dynamo and agreed to a two-year, entry-level contract with Colorado on 12 May 2017.\nAfter attending his first training camp with the Avalanche, Mironov made the team's opening roster to begin the 2017–18 season. He made his NHL debut with Colorado in a 4-2 victory over the New York Rangers at Madison Square Gardens on 5 October 2017. While still adapting to the North American game, Mironov was primarily a healthy scratch before he was re-assigned on a conditioning stint to AHL affiliate, the San Antonio Rampage on 19 October 2017. Following his return to Colorado, Mironov featured in 7 games over the month of November, scoring his first NHL goal and adding an assist in a 5-2 defeat to the Nashville Predators on 18 November 2017.\nUnable to earn regular playing time on the Avalanche blueline, Mironov was returned to the Rampage to continue his development for another month before he was again recalled and featured in his 10th game, a 6-1 victory over the New York Islanders on December 31, 2017. Despite the win, Mironov was unable to draw back into the Avalanche lineup and was returned again to the Rampage. With the Avalanche hit through injury, Mironov received multiple call-ups as a healthy scratch.
