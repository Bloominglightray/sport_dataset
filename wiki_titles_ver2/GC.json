The Federation controls and organises national championships at senior and youth levels, and is responsible for the men's and women's national teams\nThe FeVA also controls the practise of similar disciplines such as beach volley.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nVolleyball was introduced in Argentina in 1912 by the YMCA, with the first Federation established in 1932. That body organised not only volleyball but cestoball, ruling both sports. The first championship organised by the federation was held in 1933.\nThe Federation published the first rules of the game in 1936, then extending to other aspects of the game such as transfers and players classifications, or size and weight of the reglementary ball. In 1941, the Federation was admitted as member of the Argentine Sports Confederation and Argentine Olympic Committee. \nIn 1942, cestoball separates from the FeVA to establish its own federation. \nFeVA.\nThe current Argentine Volleyball Federation was established in 2003 after the FIVB designated a \"work group\" to temporarily administer the practise of volleyball in Argentina. Some of the competitions held by the body are the women's national league, men's serie A2 and A3 (second and third divisions) and the national teams of both, men's and women's.\nThe only competition in Argentina not organised by the FeVA is the Liga Argentina de Voleibol – Serie A1, which is controlled by the ACLAV (\"Asociación de Clubes Liga Argentina de Voleibol\").\nThe FeVA was recognised as the only representative volleyball body of the country by the FIVB."

        "text": "The 1962–63 North Dakota Fighting Sioux men's ice hockey team represented the University of North Dakota in college ice hockey. In its 3rd year under head coach Barry Thorndycraft the team compiled a 22–7–3 record and reached the NCAA tournament for the third time. The Fighting Sioux defeated Denver 6–5 to win the championship game at the McHugh Forum in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts.\nSeason.\nNorth Dakota entered the 1962–63 season after finishing 5th in the WCHA for the previous two seasons. Head coach Barry Thorndycraft was in his fourth season leading the program and could now see his first recruiting class lead the team as seniors. The Fighting Sioux got off to a good start with three home wins against non-conference opponents before opening up the WCHA schedule against Michigan State on the road. After solidly winning the first game 11–4 the Spartans repaid the favor by taking game two 5–6. North Dakota returned home for a series against a Canadian junior team where UND utterly dominated then hit the road again and traveled to Duluth to take on the comparatively weak Bulldogs. Despite the disparity in talent Minnesota–Duluth was able to win their first game of the season, holding the Fighting Sioux to a single goal. North Dakota took the second game to prevent the weekend from becoming a disaster and went in with a decent record of 7–2 but only 1–1 in conference.\nTheir first opponent after the new year was defending national champion Michigan Tech but with the games in Grand Forks UND had the advantage. The Sioux took the first game 4–2 but the Huskies fought back in the second match and battled North Dakota to a 3–3 tie. The three point weekend allowed UND to ahead of Michigan Tech in the standings despite having played two fewer conference games and after sweeping Minnesota in Minneapolis the following weekend North Dakota was within shouting distance of league-leading Denver. After trouncing another junior team in a single home game North Dakota played host to the Pioneers and the North Dakota faithful roared when the home team won both games to take over atop the WCHA standings, leading with a .813 winning percentage in conference.\nUND played one more home game against the Winnipeg Maroons before heading out on an arduous road trip. Their first stop was in Houghton the following weekend where Michigan Tech was waiting to exact revenge. The Huskies stifled UND in both games, holding the Fighting Sioux to a single goal over the weekend and comfortably took both matches. Three days later North Dakota found themselves at altitude in Colorado where they played four games in five days against Denver and Colorado College. Denver too was able to pay the Fighting Sioux back with two home wins but CC fell in both games to give UND a good chance at earning a home playoff berth in the WCHA tournament.\nWith Denver and MTU playing each other the following week all North Dakota had to do was take care of business at home against Minnesota and Michigan and they would be able to lock up home ice in at least the first round. UND barely won the two contests against Minnesota but the two wins allowed them to leapfrog the Golden Gophers and with Denver splitting its series with the Huskies North Dakota could earn the #1 seed with its only series against the league-worst Wolverines. With nothing left to lose Michigan fought back against the Fighting Sioux and tied the first game 2–2 before barely losing the second match 6–5. The mostly good weekend allowed North Dakota to finish 11–5–2 in league play, giving UND a .667 winning percentage which left them in a tie for first with Denver. North Dakota's first title since forming the WCHA allowed them to earn home ice in their first-round series against Michigan Tech but because Denver had more wins (12) North Dakota was only the second seed.\nFor the second consecutive year the WCHA had altered the playoff format, making the first round a two-game total-goal series instead of a single-elimination match. While goaltender Joe Lech earned the team's only shutout of the season in the first game against the Huskies, UND could only manage 2 goals themselves. The slim margin was built upon swiftly the next night and North Dakota took the series easily with a 6–1 win. Unfortunately, right after the game the team had to travel almost a thousand miles to play Denver the following day. Despite the journey, the Fighting Sioux put up a fight against the Pioneers and sent the game into overtime tied 4–4 but it was Denver who came out on top.\nDue to finishing as the WCHA runner-up North Dakota was offered the second western seed and accepted the entry into the 1963 NCAA Tournament, their first appearance since winning the title in 1959. Ordinarily, UND would have played the winner of the ECAC Tournament but because an ongoing disagreement between the NCAA and the Ivy League about post-season participation Harvard declined their invitation. Instead, North Dakota was set to face ECAC runner-up Boston College at their home venue. While the partisan crowd hoped that the Eagles would be able to carry the day North Dakota swiftly dispatched BC, winning the game 8–2, and sending them to the championship against Denver.\nThe home team had won all five games between the two schools that season but now a neutral venue would decide which team was ultimately the best. North Dakota came out swinging, scoring the first goal less than two minutes into the contest and added two more before eight minutes had elapsed. Denver would score two goals in quick succession to cut the lead to 1 but within the span of 54 seconds UND added two for to regain a 3-goal lead. UND had outshot Denver 15–7 in the first and they continued to keep the pressure on Rudy Unis into the second, firing another 15 shots at the DU netminder. Al McLean scored just after the 5-minute mark to put his team up 6–2 but Denver started to slowly claw back with two goals to cut the lead in half before the end of the period. In the third North Dakota's offense pulled back slightly but in closing their ranks they were able to limit Denver to only 2 shots on goal. Even so, Denver's Bob Hamill was able to get his third goal of the night with more than six minutes remaining but that was all Denver could muster in the final frame and UND skated away with their second national title, ending Denver's NCAA tournament winning streak at 7 games.\nThe five goals scored by UND in the first tied the record held by the 1961 Denver team for the most in the opening period while the seven total goals also tied for the most. While he did win the game, with Joe Lech's less-than-stellar championship game (5 goals allowed on 17 shots) it wasn't much of a surprise that he didn't make either All-Tournament team but five of his teammates were named to the first team: George Goodacre, Don Ross, Al McLean, Dave Merrifield and Don Stokaluk. Team captain Maurice Roberge was also named to the second team. McLean, having scored twice including the game-winner, was named as tournament MOP.\nAfter the season McLean, Merrifield and Ross were named as AHCA All-Americans while Merrifeld and Ross made the All-WCHA First Team. Lech and McLean were named to the WCHA Second Team while Barry Thordycraft won the WCHA Coach of the Year\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "text": "Two human polls made up the 2019–20 NCAA Division I men's basketball rankings, the AP Poll and the Coaches Poll, in addition to various publications' preseason polls. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the season ended March 12, 2020. As a result, the NCAA did not bestow a national championship. Instead, that title was de facto bestowed by one or more different polling agencies. There were two main weekly polls that began in the preseason—the AP Poll and the Coaches' Poll.\nKansas, while having not officially made a claim, finished first in both polls. While the program recognised the Helms Athletic Foundation mythical national championship rankings for the 1921-22 and 1922-23 seasons as national championships, this team has yet to be recognised.\nUSA Today Coaches Poll.\nThe Coaches Poll is the second oldest poll still in use after the AP Poll. It is compiled by a rotating group of 31 college Division I head coaches. The Poll operates by Borda count. Each voting member ranks teams from 1 to 25. Each team then receives points for their ranking in reverse order: Number 1 earns 25 points, number 2 earns 24 points, and so forth. The points are then combined and the team with the highest points is then ranked No. 1; second highest is ranked No. 2 and so forth. Only the top 25 teams with points are ranked, with teams receiving first place votes noted the quantity next to their name. The maximum points a single team can earn is 775.\nSee also.\n2019–20 NCAA Division I women's basketball rankings"

        "title": "Unwritten rules of baseball",
        "text": "There is a set of unwritten rules of baseball that some players and managers follow. The rules often concern gamesmanship and not disrespecting players on the opposing team. Incidents have occurred when one or more players interpret the actions of another player as violating the unwritten rules, which can result in beanballs and bench-clearing brawls. As the rules are unwritten, and in many cases vague, the interpretation is left to the players involved.\nHistory.\nSince the beginnings of baseball in the 19th century, players have adopted unwritten rules about how to behave during the game. According to sportswriter Ross Bernstein, these rules have evolved over time. Joe Garagiola wrote a book about baseball published in 1960, titled \"Baseball is a Funny Game\", in which he mentioned the unwritten rules of baseball.\nIn his book, Garagiola described the \"purpose pitch\", also known as a brushback pitch, a pitch thrown towards the batter's head. In 1986, Peter Schmuck and Randy Youngman of the \"Orange County Register\" wrote a column on the unwritten rules, identifying 30 such rules. The column was later carried by \"Baseball Digest\" in their June 1986 issue.\nThe unwritten rules of baseball are meant to establish certain behavioral thresholds for sportsmanship. Though some rules are universal, they are not always enforced in an equal way. Certain players are given more leeway than others, especially veteran home run hitters who take time admiring their home runs.\nUnwritten rules.\nThe unwritten rules include:\nPunishments for violating the unwritten rules include beanball wars. These beanings can result in bench-clearing brawls.\nSome unwritten rules are no longer followed. The baseball color line, dictating that black players could not play in Major League Baseball (MLB), was an unwritten rule. It was broken in 1947 with the signing of Jackie Robinson.\nNotable incidents.\nStan Williams, a pitcher who played during the 1960s, wrote the names of players he felt he had to retaliate against on the inside of his baseball cap.\nIn 1979, pitcher Ed Farmer allowed a home run to Wayne Gross, and felt that Gross took too long rounding the bases. The next time they faced each other was four years later; they were teammates and Farmer hit Gross during batting practice to retaliate.\nIn a 1964 game between the Cincinnati Reds and the Philadelphia Phillies, the Reds' Chico Ruiz stole home during a scoreless game, while Frank Robinson, their best hitter, was at bat. The Phillies felt this violated baseball's unwritten rules, and he was hit in the ribs during an at bat.\nPitcher Bob Gibson was a known adherent of the unwritten rules. He once beaned an opposing batter for a perceived slight that occurred 15 years earlier.\nNolan Ryan adhered to the unwritten rules, and was known to retaliate for violations against other teams' players with beanballs. He would also throw beanballs at hitters who bunted to him, making him field his position. The Chicago White Sox took issue with his brushback pitches, leading to a brawl between Ryan and Robin Ventura after Ryan threw at Ventura during a game in 1993.\nIn 1994, while playing in Minor League Baseball, Michael Jordan violated the unwritten rules by stealing third base even though his team had an 11–0 lead. His manager, Terry Francona, explained the unwritten rule to him after the game.\nAlex Rodriguez was twice criticized for violating the unwritten rules during his career. In 2007, Rodriguez distracted Howie Clark from catching a pop up while he ran the bases. During a 2010 game between the Oakland Athletics and New York Yankees, Rodriguez ran from first to third base on a foul ball, and crossed the pitcher's mound while returning to first base. Athletics' pitcher Dallas Braden called out Rodriguez for crossing the mound.\nPlayers who have bunted to break up a no-hitter have received attention. Ben Davis bunted against Curt Schilling during a potential perfect game in 2001, stirring controversy. During a 2014 game, Andrew Cashner was in the process of a no-hitter, when Domonic Brown bunted for a hit. Andrelton Simmons bunted for a hit during a no-hitter in 2018.\nIn 2015, Manny Machado hit a home run off of Jonathan Papelbon, and Papelbon believed that Machado took too much time admiring the home run. The next time they faced each other, Papelbon threw at Machado's head. Bryce Harper, Papelbon's teammate, took issue with Papelbon's reaction. When Harper failed to hustle on a fly out, Papelbon confronted Harper in the dugout, leading to a fight. Harper later called for the end to the unwritten rules. While many fans agreed with Harper, players supported Papelbon.\nIn the 2015 American League Division Series between the Toronto Blue Jays and the Texas Rangers, the Blue Jays' José Bautista hit a home run and flipped his bat in an exaggerated manner. Pitcher Sam Dyson took offense to the bat flip and told Edwin Encarnación to tell Bautista to \"respect the game\". The next year, the Rangers retaliated by having pitcher Matt Bush bean Bautista. Bautista later slid into the Rangers' Rougned Odor, leading to a fight.\nIn a 2019 National League game between the Cincinnati Reds and Pittsburgh Pirates, Reds player Derek Dietrich stood at home plate and admired a home run off pitcher Chris Archer, which bounced out of the stadium and into the Allegheny River. The Pirates felt he admired it for too long of a time, and Archer threw behind him on his next at-bat, sparking a brawl that resulted in the ejections of four players and Reds manager David Bell. Dietrich went on to hit another home run that also left the stadium, though the Pirates eventually won 7–5.\nIn 2020, Fernando Tatís Jr. of the San Diego Padres was accused of breaking an unwritten rule in a game against the Texas Rangers when he swung at a 3–0 pitch with the bases loaded when his team was leading by seven runs in the eighth inning. The swing resulted in a grand slam that extended the Padres' lead to 11 runs. Rangers manager Chris Woodward and Padres manager Jayce Tingler were critical of Tatís, and Tatís issued an apology. The following day, in another game against the Rangers, Tatís allegedly broke another unwritten rule by stealing third base when his team was leading by six runs in the fourth inning. A number of current and former players came to Tatís's defense.\nIn 2021, rookie Yermín Mercedes of the Chicago White Sox was accused by his own manager of breaking an unwritten rule in a game against the Minnesota Twins. Mercedes swung at a 3–0 pitch when his team was leading 15–4, hitting a home run off Willians Astudillo, a position player pitching. The next game, in the seventh inning, Mercedes was thrown at by Twins pitcher Tyler Duffey, resulting in him and manager Rocco Baldelli being ejected from the game by home plate umpire Jim Reynolds. White Sox manager Tony La Russa was publicly critical of Mercedes, calling him \"clueless,\" and said he didn't have a problem with the Twins throwing behind Mercedes in apparent retaliation. In contrast, teammates of Mercedes, as well as opponents, including pitcher and future teammate Alex Wood, supported him.\n\"Let the Kids Play\" marketing campaign.\nIn 2018 MLB launched a marketing campaign called \"Let the Kids Play\", which explicitly criticized the unwritten rules concerning bat flips and player celebrations. MLB began embracing bat flips, promoting them to fans on social media. This became an issue of contention when Tim Anderson did a bat flip after a home run in April 2019. Pitcher Brad Keller hit Anderson with a pitch during Anderson's next at bat, causing a bench-clearing brawl."

He played for the Penrith Panthers, Balmain and the Parramatta Eels in the New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL) competition. Clarke is the brother of former rugby league players Peter Clarke and Craig Clarke.\nPlaying career.\nClarke made his first grade debut for Balmain in Round 16 1984 against Manly-Warringah at Brookvale Oval. In 1985, Balmain finished second on the table but were eliminated in consecutive weeks during the finals series. Clarke played a total of 24 games for Balmain in 1985.\nBalmain would go on to be a constant feature in the finals series over the coming years. Clarke missed both the 1988 and 1989 grand final defeats through injury. In 1990, Clarke joined Penrith and was a member of their first ever grand final side. Penrith would lose to Canberra 18–14.\nIn 1991, Penrith would reach their second grand final in a rematch against Canberra. Clarke played at prop as Penrith came from behind to win their first premiership 19–12 at the Sydney Football Stadium. After winning the 1991 premiership, Penrith's fortunes declined and the club failed to reach the finals in the following seasons.\nIn 1994, Clarke signed with the Parramatta Eels. Clarke played two seasons for Parramatta as the club struggled towards the bottom of the ladder narrowly avoiding the wooden spoon in 1995. Clarke retired following the conclusion of the 1995 season."

        "title": "1960–61 Denver Pioneers men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1960–61 Denver Pioneers men's ice hockey team represented University of Denver in college ice hockey. In its 5th year under head coach Murray Armstrong the team compiled a 30–1–1 record and reached the NCAA tournament for the third time in four years. The Pioneers defeated St. Lawrence 12–2 in the championship game at the DU Arena in Denver, Colorado. Denver set a record for the most wins by a team in one season, breaking the previous high of 27 they had earned the previous year.\nSeason.\nDenver's program was riding high after winning the NCAA tournament the year before as well as having the first player in program history earn an NHL contract following the championship. Head coach Murray Armstrong was not willing to rest on his laurels, however. After the team's first national title in 1958 the program was shut out of the tournament the following year and, not wanting to see a repeat performance, Armstrong watched his team get off to a fast start with three wins at home before embarking on a brief but arduous road trip.\nTheir first stop was in North Dakota where they easily took two games from a weak Fighting Sioux squad before heading to Houghton to face a tough Michigan Tech team that given them fits the year before. The Huskies took the first game, holding Denver to a season-low 2 goals, but the Pioneers evened the score the next night with a 5–2 win.\nTwo days later Denver was back home where they would remain for essentially the next two months. Denver playing too many of their games at home was the main cause of their missing the 1959 tournament despite having the best record in the country. Even with that recent history the Pioneers had skewed an already home-favored schedule for 1961 with 20 games at home and only 8 on the road. They were able to do this in part because they now belonged to the WCHA rather than being an Independent program and as a result they would only have to be one of the two best squads in the 7-team conference to have home-ice in the playoffs.\nWith all of these advantages built into their schedule Denver took full advantage and ran roughshod over their opponents. After sweeping four games in 5 days against Michigan State and Michigan (though they got a scare with an overtime win in the final match), Denver welcomed the Huskies for a rematch at the end of December and took both games to place themselves firmly atop the conference standings. After a series against a Canadian senior team that provided Denver with its only tie of the season, the Pioneers dominated North Dakota in two games before welcoming the US National Team. Though Team USA had just won the gold medal most of the players from that squad were no longer on the team and the perceptibly weaker group was easily defeated in both games.\nAfter their first of two home-and-home meetings with in-state rival Colorado College, Denver hosted the Warroad Lakers for a three-game series and totally dominated the visitors by scoring 9 goals in each game. In mid-February Denver finally left Colorado for two games against a strong Michigan squad and took both contests before ending their regular season with a second series against the CC Tigers.\nThe one team from the WCHA that they did not face during the season was Minnesota. This was due to the on-going feud between the two programs over recruiting practices. Both teams were able to benefit from this since the two teams were the strongest in the WCHA and finished in the top two of the conference. Denver won their second consecutive WCHA title with their 17–1 conference record and played Michigan Tech at home in the WCHA tournament. For the first game of the total-goal series Denver dominated the Huskies, winning 9–1 and followed that up with an equally impressive 8–2 victory the following night. Denver's 17–3 victory was the widest margin for any 2-game series in the history of the WCHA tournament as well as being tied for the most goals scored by one team in a two-game series.\nDenver received the top western seed while WCHA co-champion Minnesota was afforded the #2 seed. Partially due to Denver and Minnesota having not played against one another all season the NCAA took the unprecedented step of placing both WCHA teams in the same semifinal game. This was the first time two teams from the same conference or region would play in an opening round of the NCAA tournament, an occurrence that would not happen again until 2008. Despite their being the top two teams from the WCHA from the drop of the puck it was obvious that Denver was far superior to the Golden Gophers. Minnesota did well to hold the Pioneers to six goals in their 6–1 victory that sent Denver back to the title game. In the championship match Denver faced Tri-State League champion St. Lawrence and were heavily favored to repeat as national champions. Despite that it was the Saints who scored first, less than 90 seconds into the contest. Denver was able to tie the score less than two minutes later and then built a two-goal lead before the Larries cut the lead to one with just under seven to play in the first period. After the second goal against Denver clamped down on the Saints' attack and controlled the rest of the game. In the final 45 minutes of play Denver scored the final 9 goals of the game (an NCAA tournament record) to win by an astounding 10-goal margin (also a record). Team captain Bill Masterton scored a hat trick with two assists and was named the tournament MOP. Denver's thoroughly dominating performance in the two games got five members of the team onto the All-Tournament first team (tied for the most in NCAA history): Marty Howe, Grant Munro, Trent Beatty, Bill Masterton and Jerry Walker with only Minnesota's Mike Larson stopping their bid for a sweep. Additionally George Kirkwood and George Konik made the second team.\nThe 1961 Denver team set several new NCAA records, including most wins by a program with 30. Their 30–1–1 record was the second best winning percentage () for an NCAA champion at the time and currently sits at 4th-best in history (behind only 1949 Boston College, 1970 Cornell and 1993 Maine as of 2018) Denver also scored at one of the highest goals per game pace in NCAA history with a whopping 7.56. Additionally they were the best defensive team to that point, allowing only 59 goals against in 32 contests for a team goals against average of 1.84. Denver's average margin of victory of 5.72 goals was the second-largest average in NCAA history at the time and still stands as the largest ever for a championship team. Jerry Walker's 85 points that season were a record for any WCHA player and were not beaten until the conference expanded to many more games in the mid-1970s while his WCHA-record 56 goals still stands as of 2018. George Kirkwood set an NCAA record for wins in a season with 30 and finished with a then-record career winning percentage of which was broken by future Hall-of-Famer Ken Dryden.\nDenver's unparalleled performance throughout the season caused the WCHA voters to name 5 players to the All-WCHA First Team: George Kirkwood, George Konik, Marty Howe, Bill Masterton and Jerry Walker while a record 5 Pioneers appeared on AHCA All-American West Team with Grant Munro being selected rather than Konik.\nThe 1960-61 Denver team is commonly regarded as the best in the history of the program and one of the greatest teams in NCAA history.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862633; \" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862633; \" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862633; \" | \n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862633; \" | "

        "title": "La Tourette Golf Course",
        "text": " \nLa Tourette Golf Course is a public course on Staten Island in New York City. The land is part of Staten Island's Greenbelt and has views of historic Richmond Town. The La Tourette House, which dates to 1836 and is on the National Register of Historic Places, serves as the clubhouse. Considered by some to be the crown jewel of New York City's public golf course network, it is home to the annual New York City Amateur Championship.\nHistory.\nLa Tourette Park, like much of the surrounding area, was once the farm property of David (1786–1864) and Ann (1794–1862) La Tourette. The La Tourette's established their farm in 1830. Soon their 500-acre holding was the largest privately owned property on Staten Island. Over time the farm became one of the top producing family–run farms in the area and was renowned for its superb produce. The La Tourette family operated the farm until 1910. In 1928, New York City purchased 120 acres of the property for $3,500 per acre with plans to build a public golf course. The site was transferred to the parks department in 1955 and was designated a New York City Landmark in 1973.\nThe first nine holes, designed by David L. Rees, opened in 1929. The original course included the current versions of the 15th through 18th holes and finished with three par 3s, the last of which played away from the clubhouse. In 1935, John Van Kleek designed nine new holes and redesigned the original nine. A major addition, the restaurant area, was added to the clubhouse as well. In 1964 Frank Duane remodeled four holes.\nIn the 1960s work began on the Richmond Parkway, now known as Korean War Veterans Parkway, which was planned by Robert Moses (1888-1981) based on proposals drawn up in the 1930s. Moses, who was New York City's Parks Commissioner from 1934 till 1960, had a master plan for a network of parkways throughout New York City. His plan for Staten Island was to ring the island with roadways and to crisscross the borough with Richmond Parkway and the Willowbrook Expressway, now named in honor of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. In 1970, New York State approved routing of the roadways through Staten Island's green space. The State rejected alternatives proposed by the City because they would require the taking of more than 200 homes. Maps of the proposed roadways show a break-up of La Tourette Golf Course. Richmond Parkway would have run up the 4th fairway with an interchange at Richmond Hill Road near the 5th and 11th tees. The road would have continued across the 13th and 14th holes and a large interchange with the Willowbrook Expressway was to be built beyond the 16th green and 17th tee. In the 1800s, Staten Islander and great landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted envisioned miles of parkland covering the central rugged portions of the island. In the 1970s islanders agreed with Olmsted and the building of the roadways through the middle of the island were canceled after community opposition; the Parkway and the Expressway were completed to their current configuration.\nJim Albus, a multiple winner on the PGA Tour Champions, was La Tourette's head professional from 1969 till 1980. Albus is a winner of the prestigious Metropolitan Open and the Senior Players Championship. He is a member of the PGA Metropolitan Section Hall of Fame.\nCourse description.\nLa Tourette has medium size greens, some of which have multiple plateaus (1, 3, 6, 16, 17) and others with unique mounding (4-original, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 15). One of the more difficult par 4s is the 5th hole with trees hanging over the right side of the green and a large mound separating the green in two. Holes 4, 6, 10, 12, 13, 15 and 18 play uphill to the green. For the most part, the golf course is right in front of you with few if any blind shots. For years La Tourette had the unique feature of two practice putting greens, one for flat putts and one for breaking putts. Today the two greens are mowed as one big practice green.\nSince its last major update in 1964, the golf course has seen some minor changes to improve course maintenance and increase speed of play. A fairway bunker short and right of the 1st green was removed. In the 1970s the 3rd green was extended in the back right and the progression of lengthening the hole some 35 yards began. On the 4th hole a large bunker in the middle of the fairway was removed and a second green was built to the right of the original green when a bike path was built along Forest Hill Road. The size of the putting surfaces of the 7th and 12th greens were reduced which eliminated some of the unique putting contours of the original design. In the 1970s the back tee was cleared so the 8th hole could play over the lake and the left fairway bunkers, that were out of play near the 9th hole, were removed. Out of play bunkers to the left of the 11th fairway, protecting Forest Hill Road, had been abandoned and neglected for years but were restored to protect the new bike path."

        "title": "North Adelaide Golf Course",
        "text": "North Adelaide Golf Course is a 54 hole golf course in Adelaide, South Australia. The golf course is situated in the park lands which surround the City of Adelaide. The course consists of three courses, the Par 69 North Course, the Par 71 South Course, and an 18 hole Par 3 course. The North Adelaide Golf Course is perhaps the only golf course of its size to be located only a kilometre away from the business heart of a capital city.\nHistory.\nGolf has a long history in the Adelaide park lands, stretching back to 1870, 34 years after the European settlement of Adelaide. Before 1870, there is no known record of golf having been played in South Australia. Sir James Fergusson was appointed as governor of South Australia in 1868, and upon his arrival in Adelaide in 1869 set about establishing Adelaide's first golf club with David Murray and several other men. This golf club played its inaugural game of golf on May 15, 1870, with two rounds of a seven-hole course in what is now of the Adelaide park lands. A nine-hole course was briefly established, but ultimately this early golf club was to be short lived, becoming defunct around 1876 following the departure of Governor Fergusson in 1873. \nThe North Adelaide Golf Club was formed in 1890 by William Pope and a group of professional men who lived in North Adelaide and the surrounding areas. This club played on a nine-hole course established at Montefiore Hill in modern-day of the Adelaide park lands. Cows, which had the run of the park lands at the time, were a frequent hazard on this early course. Fences were erected around the greens to prevent damage from grazing cattle, and local rules allowed golfers to take a mulligan if the fencing interfered with a shot. Players were also permitted to lift their ball from cow pats without incurring a penalty stroke.\nIn 1905 the North Adelaide Golf Course was officially opened as a municipal course. In 1921 the Adelaide City Council took over the original 9-hole course, extending it to 18-holes and creating the second public course of its kind in Australia (after Moore Park in Sydney). In 1950, holes on the existing course were reshuffled as the second 18-hole course was constructed in modern-day . In 1959 the names of the courses were changed from No.1 and No.2 to North and South, respectively. In 1960 the 18 hole Par 3 course was opened as the first of its kind in Australia. Several holes have been realigned in the intervening years, and club membership waxed and waned. In 2005 the North Adelaide Golf Club celebrated its 100th year as a municipal golf club.\nFeatures.\nSouth Course\nThe championship style South Course is a Par 71 measuring in at 5884 meters in length. From the ladies tees the course is a 5404 metre Par 73. The course features a variety of holes, from Par 3s to Par 5s. Mature trees line the Santa Ana couch tees, Kikuyu grass fairways, and Bent grass greens.\nNorth Course\nThe short but challenging North Course is a Par 69 measuring in at 4534 metres in length. From the ladies tees the course is a 4320 metre Par 70. It hosts a mix of short, tight holes and longer, open fairways.\nPar 3 Course\nThe North Adelaide Golf Course Par 3 sits between the River Torrens and War Memorial Drive, and hosts 18 holes ranging in length from 56 to 140 metres. Tee's are of synthetic turf while the fairways and greens are Kikuyu grass, and Bent grass as in the North and South Courses."

        "title": "Australian cricket team in New Zealand in 1886–87",
        "text": "The Australian cricket team toured New Zealand in late November and early December 1886.\nIt was Australia's third tour of New Zealand, after tours in 1877-78 and 1880-81, and the shortest of the three. The Australians played five matches against provincial teams, four of which fielded 22 players (the other team, Canterbury, fielded 18) with the aim of providing more evenly-matched contests. As the matches were not 11-a-side they are not considered to have been first-class. The Australians won two of the matches and drew the other three.\nThe Australian team.\nThe Australians were returning from their 1886 tour of England, apart from George Bonnor and Tup Scott, who had remained in England. The 11 remaining players toured New Zealand, with the addition of Jim Phillips. Several of them were carrying injuries, and most of them were fatigued.\nBlackham and Spofforth had been on the previous two tours of New Zealand.\nGiffen was sick throughout the tour and unable to play at all. He umpired in the match against Hawke's Bay. Blackham suffered a severe gash to his hand while batting against Canterbury, and was unable to play thereafter, so the Australians played with only 10 men for the last three matches, the local associations lending them substitute fieldsmen. Blackham umpired in the match against Auckland.\nThe tour.\nMost of the Australians sailed from England on the \"Arawa\", stopping only briefly in Hobart, where Phillips joined them, on the way to Port Chalmers. Spofforth and Garrett arrived on a slightly later ship, missing the first day of the Otago match.\nEvans took 16 for 25 and 10 for 37, for match figures of 96.1–58–62–26 (four-ball overs). Trumble top-scored in each innings with 30 and 52. The Australians were dismissed at stumps on the first day, when Spofforth and Garrett had not yet arrived in Dunedin, so they batted only nine men in their first innings. Otago's top-scorer was Andrew Grieve, who made 33 in the second innings. The Australians considered Charlie Frith, who took 4 for 33 in their first innings, \"the most troublesome bowler\" they faced on this tour.\nThe Australians, who had lost to Canterbury in 1877–78, again struggled. They found the bowling of David Dunlop difficult to handle, as he bowled his leg-breaks cleverly into a strong wind and took 5 for 50 and 3 for 17. Two Canterbury batsmen, the captain William Millton in the first innings and Edward Barnes in the second, scored 35, but the highest Australian innings was 32 by Blackham in the first innings. In the second innings a ball from Frederick Wilding struck Blackham on the first finger of his left hand, opening a gash an inch and a half long and putting him out of action for the rest of the tour.\nThe Australians' total of 475 set a record for the highest total in any match in New Zealand. It occupied 323.2 four-ball overs. Jones (159 in five and a half hours) and Palmer (76) put on 202 for the first wicket.\nPalmer took 15 for 47 off 27 four-ball overs, bowling unchanged through the Hawke's Bay innings. Garrett, with 31, was the only batsman on either side to reach 20. For Hawke's Bay, Charles Edwards took 6 for 39.\nThe Auckland batsman Dan Lynch, who had bowled so effectively against the Australians on their previous two tours, scored 46 in Auckland's first innings. It was the highest score by any New Zealand batsman against the Australians on their first three tours of New Zealand. After taking figures of 57–32–41–12 in Auckland's first innings, Palmer made 72 in Australia's second innings, which lasted 212 overs; the Auckland bowler Edward Mills had figures of 59–32–53–7. An extra day was added, but the slowness of the match prevented a result: off 462.3 four-ball overs only 487 runs were scored.\nThe Australians sailed for Sydney on the \"Mararoa\" shortly after seven o'clock at the end of the third day's play.\nLeading players.\nJones was the highest scorer, with 280 runs at an average of 35.00; Trumble scored 218 at 27.25. Palmer was the leading wicket-taker, with 53 wickets at an average of 4.98; Evans took 34 at 3.23. Lynch's 46 for Auckland was the highest score by a New Zealander, and his team-mate Mills's 7 for 53 were the best figures. The New Zealand cricket historian Tom Reese wrote in 1927 that Jarvis's keeping was \"the chief feature of the tour ... absolutely brilliant throughout, and it is generally considered that the best wicket-keeping ever seen in New Zealand was displayed by Jarvis on this tour\"."

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball career fielding errors as a right fielder leaders",
        "text": "In baseball statistics, an error is an act, in the judgment of the official scorer, of a fielder misplaying a ball in a manner that allows a batter or baserunner to advance one or more bases or allows an at bat to continue after the batter should have been put out. The right fielder (RF) is one of the three outfielders, the defensive positions in baseball farthest from the batter. Right field is the area of the outfield to the right of a person standing at home plate and facing toward the pitcher's mound. The outfielders must try to catch long fly balls before they hit the ground, or to quickly catch or retrieve and return to the infield any other balls entering the outfield. The right fielder must also be adept at navigating the area of right field where the foul line approaches the corner of the playing field and the walls of the seating areas. Being the outfielder farthest from third base, the right fielder often has to make longer throws than the other outfielders to throw out runners advancing around the bases, so they often have the strongest or most accurate throwing arm. The right fielder normally plays behind the second baseman and first baseman, who play in or near the infield; unlike catchers and most infielders (excepting first basemen), who are virtually exclusively right-handed, right fielders can be either right- or left-handed. In the scoring system used to record defensive plays, the right fielder is assigned the number 9, the highest number.\nThe list of career leaders is dominated by players from the early 20th century; only six of the top 20 players were active after 1951, only one of whom played primarily in the American League. Only nine of the top 91 single-season totals were recorded after 1939, only four after 1979. To a large extent, the leaders reflect longevity rather than lower skill. Roberto Clemente, who tied a modern National League record with 131 errors as a right fielder, won twelve consecutive Gold Glove Awards for defensive excellence.\nBecause game accounts and box scores often did not distinguish between the outfield positions, there has been some difficulty in determining precise defensive statistics prior to 1901; because of this, and because of the similarity in their roles, defensive statistics for the three positions are frequently combined. Although efforts to distinguish between the three positions regarding games played during this period and reconstruct the separate totals have been largely successful, separate error totals are unavailable; players whose totals are missing the figures for pre-1901 games are notated in the table below. Harry Hooper is the modern (post-1900) leader in career errors committed by a right fielder with 144. Dave Parker is second all-time, and holds the modern National League record with 134 career errors in right field. Only fourteen right fielders have committed more than 100 career errors at the position since 1900."

        "title": "Governors Island Golf Course",
        "text": "Governors Island Golf Course was a military course on Governors Island in New York Harbor, New York City, approximately from the southern tip of Manhattan Island. The golf course offered one of the most unique golf experiences in New York City due to its views of the Brooklyn and Manhattan skylines, with the Statue of Liberty as a backdrop. It was considered the only golf course in Manhattan as Governors Island is technically part of the borough.\nThe golf course closed in 1996, but was re-opened for a one-time golf tournament in 2006.\nHistory.\nGolf came to Governors Island in 1903, when a six-hole course, three holes played twice, was built near Fort Jay which was known as The Quadrangle. The golf course got a boost when Chief of Staff General Leonard Wood issued orders in 1910, that all officers must keep themselves fit. Golf was one of the sports noted by officers responding to the departmental order issued by Major General Frederick Dent Grant.\nThe version of the course that was in use for over 60 years dates back to the late 1920s when it was built with assistance from Plainfield Country Club greenskeeper Fred Roth on a piece of ground that was being utilized as a polo field. Polo was an important sport in the United States Army in the 1920s and a polo field was constructed on Fort Jay's glacis and the Parade Ground in the summer of 1925. The newly groomed open space presented an opportunity to update the golf course which was seeing increased play as Army personnel seemed to have more leisure time since troop levels had not been reduced to pre-1917 levels after World War I. Golf course features were improved with the construction of tee boxes, putting greens, and bunkers, and the polo players and the golfers began sharing the same space. The course measured , played to a par of 30 for its nine holes, and was built on a plot of land that was just under 10-acres. Course routing was designed around Fort Jay, a star-shaped Revolutionary War vintage fortification which is on the National Register of Historic Places. The layout was sometimes called “the world’s crookedest” because it was shoe-horned into limited space with many twists and turns.\nSoon the golf course was being used for tournament play and the public was invited to see the matches. \nIn 1927 Gene Sarazen, Francis Ouimet, Walter Hagen, and Jess Sweetster played a fund raiser on the island for the Army Relief Society. After the completion of Liggett Hall in 1930, the polo field was moved to the open space south of the new barracks to address the conflict between golfers and polo players. In the 1940s, course maintenance was performed by inmates of a military prison on the island who were incarcerated during the Second World War for being absent without leave.\nJurisdiction of Governors Island passed from the United States Army to the United States Coast Guard in 1966. As part of a Fort Jay improvement project, the Coast Guard updated the golf course by planting trees to direct the line of play and protect buildings, and installed fencing to ensure golf balls stayed on the course. Governors Island Golf Course was in use until August 31, 1996 when the Coast Guard left the island.\nIn 2006 over $1 million was spent to temporarily restore six of the green complexes abandoned in 1996 for a charity event that also promoted the island's opportunities. Architect Robert McNeil was hired to build a multi-tee layout that when completed had a configuration that allowed only one foursome on the course at a time. The course re-used tees, greens, and fairways to route a crisscrossing 18 hole layout that even included a 490-yard par 5. The Manhattan Golf Classic was conducted from October 19 through 22 and consisted of various competitions and clinics that featured golf professionals Tom Watson, Annika Sorenstam, and Natalie Gulbis, as well as actors Craig T. Nelson, Dennis Quaid, William Shatner and Bruce McGill. Developer Donald Trump and golf teaching guru Hank Haney also participated. The event was billed as the \"first ever professional golf tournament in the history of New York City\", although Fresh Meadow Country Club, when it was in Queens had hosted two major championships in the 1930s, and Van Cortland Park Golf Course in The Bronx and the Fox Hills Golf Course on Staten Island had conducted professional events in the early 1900s. On October 22, 2006, a skins game between a foursome of Watson, Trump, Sorenstam, and Gulbis was televised from the 'composite' 18-hole course.\nCourse description.\nGovernors Island Golf Course occasionally had a set-up where one hole was played twice. In 1925, the \"New York Times\" published a story entitled “Fort Jay Golf Offers Weird Hazards: Governors Island Links a Fretful Maze of Moats, Windows, Canteens and Other Distracting Visions\", that gave a description of the golf holes. The article said, the first hole played away from the Commanding General's house with a shot into the moat at Fort Jay. The second and third holes were played near Colonel's Row. The fourth hole bordered buildings marked as “canteens,” where players were advised to aim for the “A” in the word “CAFETERIA” and to hit their shots over the top of the building. The area between the sally port and the canteens was covered with wire netting to protect passersby. The fifth hole required a billiard shot: “hit the wall of the fort and let it carom over to the green.” The last holes led away from buildings.\nIn 1925, the “Ground Rules” of the Governors Island Golf Club included “A ball lodging within the fort is out of bounds,” and “The area within the cafeteria (canteen) buildings and the tennis court will be played as a water hazard.”"

        "text": "Four cities submitted bids to host the 1983 Pan American Games that were recognized by the Pan American Sports Organization (PASO); however, only one city, Hamilton submitted their bid on time. On April 23, 1977, Caracas, Venezuela was selected over Hamilton, Canada in a two-city vote to host the IX Pan American Games by the PASO at its general assembly in San Juan, Puerto Rico.\nHost city selection.\nBy the rotational system rule, it was a country from the Central America and Caribbean zone's turn to host the games. With Venezuela being such a country, the Venezuelan Olympic Committee argued that Canada had no right to bid for the 1983 Games for this reason. However, the deadline to submit a bid was March 21, and Venezuela entered its bid 30 days late; this situation was not covered in the PASO regulations.\nThe PASO approved a recommendation to hold an open vote for the bids from Hamilton and Caracas. A total of 28 of the 33 countries took place in the vote; the exact results of the vote were not released.\nCandidate cities.\nCaracas, Venezuela.\nVenezuela entered its bid for the 1983 Games thirty days after the official deadline for entries. Had the city submitted its bid on time, a vote would not have been necessary, as it would have been the only eligible city to host the Games, due to rotation regulations. Even so, many believed that Caracas still had the greatest chance of winning.\nHamilton, Canada.\nHamilton submitted its bid offer to the Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) to be the Canadian host city in early April 1976. Canada was not happy with the recent 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. \"The Montreal Olympics left a very bad taste because of its huge cost ... we want to prove that the Pan American Games can be held at a minimum cost,\" said Mayor John A. McDonald. The cost to host the 1983 Games in Hamilton would have been around $60 million; a contribution of $17 million each from the commonwealth and provincial government was expected to help with funding.\nHamilton had previously hosted the (inaugural) 1930 Commonwealth Games.\nThe city would have held 19 sports from July 16 to August 1, 1983. The main venue would have been the $32 million Ontario Sports Training Center, which was undergoing construction. The Pan American Village was going to be located at the same site as the 1977 Canadian Wrestling Championship, an event the city was already planning to host.\nIn April 1977, Venezuela made a request to Canada to withdraw their bid for the Games, in which the Canadian government rejected. Earlier, in January of that year, the Hamilton's Games committee sent a telegram to the Venezuelan government, offering to drop the Hamilton bid if Venezuela wanted to bid. Venezuela sent no reply to the telegram, and did not enter a bid until after the PASO deadline.\nHavana, Cuba.\nCuba's late application for Havana to be the host city of the 1983 Games was made by an official of the Cuban Olympic Committee (COC) to PASO President Mario Vázquez Raña by a long-distance phone call.\nSantiago, Chile.\nSantiago did not meet the deadline for application, but was still eligible to be in the running for host city."

Their head coach was Archie Miller, his third year as Indiana head coach. The team played its home games at Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall in Bloomington, Indiana, as a member of the Big Ten Conference. The season officially kicked off with the annual event, Hoosier Hysteria, on October 5, 2019.\nThe Hoosiers started off another strong campaign by going 11–1 before dropping back-to-back games in late December 2019 and early January 2020. During the bulk of the conference season, IU was able to win most of their home games (7–3), while stealing a few road games (2–8) to end their final season with an overall record of 20–12 and a conference record of 9–11. Indiana entered the Big Ten tournament as the 11 seed where they faced the 14th-seeded Nebraska Cornhuskers. The first-round matchup ended in an 89–64 IU victory, staging a second-round matchup with 6 seed Penn State. However, on the morning of March 12, 2020, the Big Ten Conference announced that it would be cancelling the remaining tournament games due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Following suit, that afternoon, the NCAA announced that it was cancelling all winter and spring championships. This announcement officially, and abruptly, ended the Hoosiers' season, where they were expected to make the NCAA tournament for the first time in 4 years.\nPrevious season.\nDespite getting off to a strong start of 12–2, which included three conference wins, IU struggled mightily down the backstretch of the season. Riddled with injuries and the inability to shoot, the Hoosiers lost 12 of 13 games before turning things around and finishing the regular season with a four-game winning streak. Having put themselves back into the conversation for making the NCAA tournament for the first time in 3 years, the Hoosiers looked to knock off Ohio State in the Big Ten tournament. With a win, many bracketologists had IU safely in the field. However, the Hoosiers fell short and lost to Ohio State, 75–79. IU was deemed one of the Last Four Out in the NCAA tournament, so they earned 1 seed in the NIT, where they advanced to the quarterfinals before losing to Wichita State, 63–73. Thus, the Hoosiers' 119th season ended with an overall record of 19–16 and 8–12 in the Big Ten.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=| Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=| Big Ten tournament"

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball career fielding errors as a pitcher leaders",
        "text": "In baseball statistics, an error is an act, in the judgment of the official scorer, of a fielder misplaying a ball in a manner that allows a batter or baserunner to advance one or more bases or allows an at bat to continue after the batter should have been put out. The pitcher is the player who pitches the baseball from the pitcher's mound toward the catcher to begin each play, with the goal of retiring a batter, who attempts to either make contact with the pitched ball or draw a walk. The pitcher is often considered the most important player on the defensive side of the game, playing the most difficult and specialized position, and as such is regarded as being at the right end of the defensive spectrum. Pitchers play far less than players at other positions, generally appearing in only two or three games per week; only one pitcher in major league history has appeared in 100 games in a single season. There are many different types of pitchers, generally divided between starting pitchers and relief pitchers, which include the middle reliever, lefty specialist, setup man, and closer. In the scoring system used to record defensive plays, the pitcher is assigned the number 1.\nThe list of career leaders is dominated by players from the 19th century when fielding equipment was very rudimentary; baseball gloves only began to steadily gain acceptance in the 1880s, and were not uniformly worn until the mid-1890s, resulting in a much lower frequency of defensive miscues. The top 25 players in career errors began playing in the 19th century, most of them playing their entire careers before 1900; only four were active after 1901, none after 1911. Most of the top 92 played entirely in the 19th century, with only 19 making their major league debut after 1900; only six made their debut after 1940. The top 16 single-season totals were all recorded before 1890, the top 95 were recorded before 1904, and the top 297 were recorded before 1924. To a large extent, the leaders reflect longevity rather than lower skill. Jim Kaat and Greg Maddux, whose error totals of 56 and 53 rank fifth and seventh among pitchers since 1940, won sixteen and eighteen Gold Glove Awards respectively for defensive excellence.\nBobby Mathews is the all-time leader in career errors committed by a pitcher with 220, more than twice as many as any pitcher who began playing after 1900; he is the only pitcher to commit more than 200 career errors. Tim Keefe is second with 166 career errors as a pitcher. A total of seventeen players have committed more than 100 career errors as pitchers. Justin Verlander, who had 34 errors through the 2022 season to place him tied for 234th all-time, is the leader among active players."

Puerto Rico's bid was presented extemporaneously.\nMexico City hosts the games.\nIn 1973, due to unstable political and financial reasons mainly due to the military coup of Augusto Pinochet, Santiago declined to organize the games. The runner-up San Juan had already been awarded the 1979 Pan American Games, so they declined to host the games. São Paulo,Brazil took over as the host city but was forced to give up because of a meningitis epidemic that swept Brazil in 1974.\nAfter São Paulo dropped out, President Luis Echeverría Álvarez informed President of the Mexican Olympic Committee (COM) Mario Vázquez Raña that Mexico City was authorized to host the games in an on an emergency basis. The committee then informed PASO that the city would host the games,if as no other countries or city are interested. With just 10 months until the Pan American Games, the PASO announced that Mexico City would serve as the host city."

        "text": "Three cities submitted bids to host the 1967 Pan American Games that were recognized by the Pan American Sports Organization (PASO). On April 22, 1963, Winnipeg was selected over Caracas and Santiago to host the V Pan American Games by the PASO at its general assembly in Sao Paulo, Brazil.\nHost city selection.\nThe host city selection was set to be made prior to the opening ceremonies of the 1963 Pan American Games in Sao Paulo, but the voting was delayed until Monday April 22. The Metropolitan Corporation of Greater Winnipeg (Metro) was expected to assist in Winnipeg's finances for the Games, but backed out right before the vote was to take place. Mayor of Winnipeg Stephen Juba believed that Metro attempted to ruin Winnipeg's bid for the Games and that was why the voting was delated, stating, \"They can say all they want, but they deliberately tried to scuttle our bid on the eve of the departure of our delegation to Brazil ... When this got in the papers as 'the largest Greater Winnipeg municipality backing out' you can bet that’s why the Pan-American congress delayed a decision on the site for 1967.\"\nWinnipeg went on to win the games. The results of the voting were not released.\nCandidate cities.\nWinnipeg, Canada.\nThe countries that made up the PASO assured Winnipeg that the city would host the 1967 Games after the city failed to secure the hosting rights of the 1963 Pan American Games—an event that Sao Paulo claimed. The same committee that organized the bid for those games worked to create a better bid for the 1967 Games.\nThe Citizens Committee estimated that the total net cost to hold the games in Winnipeg at $4.5 million. The Government of Canada, the Government of Manitoba, and Greater Winnipeg were expected to cover one-third of the costs each.\nThe main sporting venues were the Winnipeg Stadium and Winnipeg Arena, which were to host the opening and closing ceremonies, track events, soccer, basketball, and possibly more. Ontario also purchased the Grand Beach Provincial Park from Canadian Natural Resources in hopes that it could be renovated to a point that it could host the sailing events, and after the games, it could be used for public use. Additionally, organizers hoped to purchase Whiteshell Provincial Park for the tennis matches and Falcon Lake for rowing. Other venues included the Oshawa Civic Auditorium, Minto Armoury, Assiniboia Downs, and University of Manitoba. Additionally, the Pan American Village would be located in the Fort Osborne Barracks, which would be centered around the new $25 million addition known as the Selkirk Lines.\nSantiago, Chile.\nOn March 18, 1963, authorities announced that Santiago had bid for the 1967 Games.\nInterested cities.\nMiami and Kansas City, United States.\nOn February 12, 1963, the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) gave permission to Miami and Kansas City to bid for the 1963 Pan American Games. Since the United States was bidding of the 1968 Summer and Winter Olympics, the country was allowed to have more than one bidding city apply to host the Games."

        "title": "2019 Kentucky Derby",
        "text": "The 2019 Kentucky Derby (officially, the 2019 Kentucky Derby presented by Woodford Reserve) was the 145th running of the Kentucky Derby, and took place on Saturday, May 4, 2019, in Louisville, Kentucky. The field was open to 20 horses, who qualified for the race by earning points on the 2019 Road to the Kentucky Derby. The Derby is held annually on the first Saturday in May, at the end of the two-week-long Kentucky Derby Festival. It is a Grade I stakes race for three-year-old Thoroughbreds at a distance of , and has been run at Churchill Downs racetrack since its inception in 1875. The purse for 2019 was increased from million to million.\nThe race was broadcast by NBC, with coverage by NBCSN of undercard races beginning at 12:30 pm EDT and main network coverage of pre-race activities starting at 2:30 pm EDT. Cleveland Browns star quarterback Baker Mayfield provided the \"Riders Up\".\nAlthough Maximum Security crossed the finish line before long shot Country House, Maximum Security was disqualified and the victory was awarded to Country House after Maximum Security was judged to have cost War of Will and Long Range Toddy a better placing in the race when he swerved into their path, causing them to check strides.\nQualification.\nThe Kentucky Derby is only open to three-year-old Thoroughbreds, thus entrants in the 2019 race were foaled in 2016, mostly as part of the North America foal crop of roughly 22,500. The field is limited to twenty horses who qualify based on points earned in the 2019 Road to the Kentucky Derby, a series of designated races that was first introduced in 2013. This point system replaced the previous graded stakes race earnings system.\nMost positions in the Derby starting gate are earned on the main Road, consisting of 34 races in North America plus one in Dubai. The seven major preps for the Kentucky Derby are the Louisiana Derby, UAE Derby, Florida Derby, Wood Memorial, Blue Grass Stakes, Santa Anita Derby and Arkansas Derby. Each of these races provided the winner with 100 qualifying points, essentially guaranteeing that horse a berth in the Derby provided the owner pays the required nomination and entry fees. The first three of these major preps were run in late March and were won by By My Standards, Plus Que Parfait and Maximum Security respectively. The next three major prep races were run on April 6, and were won by Tacitus, Vekoma and Roadster respectively. The last major prep was run on April 13, and was won by Omaha Beach.\nOne qualification position is also available via the European Road to the Kentucky Derby, and another via the Japan Road. In 2019, none of the offers for the European Road were accepted and the top three finishers in the Japan Road declined their invitation as they had not been nominated to the Derby. The connections of the fourth-place finisher on the Japan Road, Master Fencer, decided to accept the offer, marking the first time that a Japanese-bred horse entered the Derby via the Japan Road.\nField.\nThe cutoff to qualify for the Derby was 40 points, the highest such total since the points system was adopted. The post position draw took place on April 30, after which Omaha Beach was installed as the 4–1 morning line favorite. However, he was scratched from the race on May 1 due to an entrapped epiglottis, which impaired his breathing. Because of his withdrawal, Bodexpress drew into the field as program number 21. With the subsequent scratch of Haikal (originally post position 11) combined with Omaha Beach (originally post position 12), horses with higher program numbers moved over two place in the starting gate—for example, Code of Honor (saddle cloth 13) started from post position 11.\nTrainer Bob Baffert, whose five Derby wins include Triple Crown champions American Pharoah and Justify, had three of the leading contenders: Champion Two-Year-Old Game Winner, Santa Anita Derby winner Roadster, and Arkansas Derby second-place finisher Improbable who would go on to be the 2020 Champion Older Dirt Male after three Grade One wins. \"This year is different,\" said Baffert. \"With [Justify and American Pharoah] I knew I had the horse and felt like I needed a little luck. Now I've got three nice horses, and there's a lot of parity. It's wide open.\"\nRace Description.\nA crowd of 150,729 turned out for the Derby. The rain held off until late afternoon, but then drenched the track, turning the track condition sloppy.\nMaximum Security went off as the second favorite (behind Improbable) at odds of 9–2 based on his frontrunning win in the Florida Derby. As expected, he went to the early lead, running a very fast opening quarter of 22.31 seconds. Jockey Luis Saez then slowed down the pace, as they completed the half-mile in 46.62 and six furlongs in 1:12.50. As they rounded the final turn, the field began to bunch up as other contenders mounted their closing drives. With about of a mile remaining in the race, Maximum Security swerved out from the two path (i.e., two positions away from the rail) into the four or five path. In the process, he made contact with War of Will and also interfered with Long Range Toddy and Bodexpress, causing all three horses to check strides. Saez, who later said that Maximum Security swerved in reaction to noise from the large crowd, quickly corrected course and returned to the two path, bumping Code of Honor who had been gaining ground on the rail. Maximum Security fought back and again drew clear of the field, crossing the finish line first.\nMeanwhile, Country House had broken from an outside post position and settled into mid-pack, carried three wide around the first turn. Going into the final turn, he was still in ninth place but rapidly made up ground while again moving wide. He was close to Maximum Security when that horse veered out, and was carried wide by Long Range Toddy. He could not respond to Maximum Security's rally, but held off the rest of the field to finish a clear second.\nObjections.\nAfter the race, the jockeys of Country House and Long Range Toddy each filed an objection to the result. The rules of racing in Kentucky provide for the disqualification of a horse if it shifts its position in a manner that impedes another horse, costing the other horse a better placing in the race. Although Country House was not materially harmed by Maximum Security's swerve on the far turn, at least three other horses — War of Will, Long Range Toddy, and Bodexpress — were severely affected. During a 22-minute review, the stewards determined that \"Maximum Security veered out into the path of #1 War of Will, who was forced to check and who, in turn, impeded #18 Long Range Toddy, who came out into #21 Bodexpress, who had to check sharply, making contact with #20 Country House.\" The stewards upheld the objections and disqualified Maximum Security to 17th place, after Long Range Toddy.\nThe disqualification is the first in Derby history to remove the first-place finishing horse for an on-track infraction; Dancer's Image was disqualified days after the 1968 Kentucky Derby for testing positive for an illegal medication.\nThe ruling proved controversial, with Maximum Security's owners blaming jockey Tyler Gaffalione on War of Will for causing the incident. War of Will's trainer, Mark Casse, responded that the interference by Maximum Security was worse than he originally thought and that he too would have filed an objection if War of Will had finished in the money. The stewards later issued a fifteen-day suspension on Maximum Security's jockey, Luis Saez, for \"failure to control his mount and make the proper effort to maintain a straight course thereby causing interference with several rivals\".\nIt was the first Kentucky Derby win for trainer Bill Mott, who commented that it was \"bittersweet\" to win the race in such a manner even though it was normally a routine matter to disqualify a horse for such an incident. NBC analysts Randy Moss and Jerry Bailey were quick to say they thought that Maximum Security was the best horse and that \"the best horse won\".\nAt odds of 65–1, Country House became the second-highest-priced winner (behind Donerail in 1913) in the 145-year history of the Derby.\nResults.\n\"Note\": The margins listed above are based on Maximum Security's first-place finish before disqualification.\nTrack condition: sloppy\nTimes: mile – 22.31; mile – 46.42; mile – 1:12.50; mile – 1:38.63; final – 2:03.93.&lt;br&gt;\nSplits for each quarter-mile: (22.31) (24.31) (25.88) (26.13) (25.30)\nSource: Equibase chart\nPayouts.\nThe table below gives Kentucky Derby payout schedule\nWagering.\nWagering on the Kentucky Oaks day totaled US$60.2 million, including US$19.4 million on the Kentucky Oaks race. Wagering on the Kentucky Derby day totaled US$250.9 million, including US$165.5 million on the Kentucky Derby race. Wagering across the Kentucky Derby Festival totaled US$343.0 million.\nSubsequent Grade I wins.\nSeveral horses from the 2019 Derby went on to win Grade I races later in their career, including Maximum Security, who was named the champion three-year-old colt. However, Country House never raced again due to a career-ending bout of laminitis."

This gave Canada several power plays, but did not result in a goal. Nevertheless, the first goal of the match was scored by Shea Theodore for the Canadian team after getting a loose puck, which was the only goal of the period. Early in the second period, Finland earned a power play, which led to the game-tying goal from team captain Marko Anttila.\nIn the third period, Anttila scored another goal for Finland to make it 2–1. With five minutes remaining, Harri Pesonen scored another goal for the Finnish team to make it a 3–1 lead, which stood until the end.\nFinland won the title for the third time, which was also their second win in Slovakia, the first being in 2011.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

        "title": "Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020",
        "text": " is a 2019 sports video game based on the 2020 Summer Olympics. It is the sixth game in the \"Mario &amp; Sonic\" series, a crossover between Nintendo's \"Super Mario\" and Sega's \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" franchises, and the first since the \"Rio 2016 Olympic Games\" edition. It was developed and published by Sega for the Nintendo Switch in November 2019 and for arcade cabinets in 2020.\nThe game received mixed reviews, with praise for the presentation and gameplay, but criticism for a perceived lack of content for single-player, multiplayer features, and the story mode.\nGameplay.\nLike previous \"Mario &amp; Sonic\" titles, \"Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020\" is a sports game featuring a crossover cast of characters from Nintendo's \"Super Mario\" and Sega's \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" series. The player, using one of the characters, competes in a multitude of events based on sports from the Olympic Games. The game features a variety of events; returning ones from previous \"Mario &amp; Sonic\" titles include boxing, soccer, swimming, and gymnastics, while new ones include karate, skateboarding, sport climbing, and surfing.\nThe game supports a variety of controllers, including the Joy-Con motion controllers. The game also features single system split-screen multiplayer, LAN multiplayer, and online play. An additional 2D Mode is also included, based on the 1964 Summer Olympics, and featuring 8-bit and 16-bit styles for Mario and Sonic, respectively. These 2D Mode events have more limited controls and the option to enable a CRT overlay to further emulate the feel of games of that era.\nThere are thirty-two playable characters in the game. Similar to the Wii U version of the previous game, the series' regulars since the second game are playable in all events while the other twelve are only playable in one event as a guest. Guest characters include Larry Koopa, Wendy O. Koopa, Ludwig von Koopa, Diddy Kong, Rosalina, Toadette (who is the game's sole newcomer), Dr. Eggman Nega, Jet the Hawk, Rouge the Bat, Zavok, Zazz, and Espio the Chameleon. In order to unlock these guest characters, players had to progress through the game's story mode.\nDevelopment and release.\nIn October 2016, Sega announced it had secured the licensing rights from the International Olympic Committee to publish video games based on the 2020 Summer Olympics, with plans for games to be released on various devices. \"Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020\" was announced alongside \"Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 - The Official Video Game\" on March 29, 2019, at the Sega Fes stage show in Japan. It was the first \"Mario &amp; Sonic\" game since the \"Rio 2016 Olympic Games\" edition for the Wii U and Nintendo 3DS, and was released worldwide for the Nintendo Switch in November 2019; a version for arcade cabinets will release sometime in 2020. A companion game for Android and iOS, \"Sonic at the Olympic Games - Tokyo 2020\", was also released in 2020. The game was featured at E3 2019, and Gamescom 2019. \"Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020\" was the final game AlphaDream worked on before it filed for bankruptcy in 2019. Racjin, Yuke's, and Success Corp also worked on the game; Racjin helped develop previous \"Mario &amp; Sonic\" games, while Yuke's helped Sega develop \"Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 - The Official Video Game\".\nA tie-in free-to-start mobile game Sonic at the Olympic Games - Tokyo 2020 was released for on Android and iOS on May 7, 2020. Like its predecessor \"Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games\", it features similar gameplay to the main game, albeit lack of \"Mario\" characters and the 2D mode, additional events, and a new story. Despite the delay of the Tokyo Olympic Games from 2020 to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the game retained the \"Olympic Games Tokyo 2020\" name for branding purposes.\nReception.\n\"Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020\" has received \"mixed or average reviews\" from critics according to the review aggregator Metacritic.\nThe game has received praise for its mini games, which have been described as fun to play. The game has also received praise for the story mode for having its own mini-games, references to various Mario and Sonic games, respectively, humor, and Olympic history. Also, the game has received praise for the 2D events for adding value for fans of the retro Mario and Sonic style, as well as emulating the feel of sports games of that era, such as \"Track &amp; Field\". However, the game has also received criticism for its story mode having \"tedious progression\" and slow dialogue. The game has also received criticism towards its lack of single-player content.\nReception to multiplayer was mixed. Local play received praise for making events more enjoyable and adding replay value, but was criticized for its limited options and \"lack of formal structure\". The online mode has been criticized due to lag, especially when playing with 8 players, although 2 to 4 players online has been reported to be smoother, with less lag.\nIn Japan, it was the 28th best-selling game of 2019, with 195,128 units sold in Japan that year. The game sold over 900,000 units as of March 2020."

        "text": "The 2018 Overwatch League Grand Finals was the first championship series of the Overwatch League (OWL), which took place July 27–28, 2018. The series was the conclusion of the 2018 Overwatch League playoffs and was played between the London Spitfire and the Philadelphia Fusion at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York.\nLondon qualified for the playoffs as the fifth seed and defeated the fourth-seeded Los Angeles Gladiators and second-seeded Los Angeles Valiant in the playoffs. Philadelphia qualified for the playoffs as the sixth seed and defeated the third-seeded Boston Uprising and top-seeded New York Excelsior in the playoffs.\nLondon Spitfire defeated Philadelphia Fusion in the first and second matches by scores of 3–1 and 3–0, respectively, to claim the title of Overwatch League Grand Finals Champions before a two-day attendance of 22,434 spectators.\nRoad to the Grand Finals.\nThe Grand Finals are the post-season championship series of the Overwatch League (OWL), a professional international esports league; the teams of the Grand Finals compete for a $1.4 million prize pool, where the winners receive $1 million. 2018 season was the first in OWL history and consisted of twelve teams in two divisions. Each team played 40 matches throughout the regular season. The playoffs were contested by six team – the two teams with the best regular season record in each division and the following four teams with the best regular season record, regardless of division.\nAt the conclusion of the regular season, both London and Philadelphia had regular season records of and were the fifth and sixth seeds, respectively, making them the bottom two teams to qualify for the season playoffs. The teams faced each other five times throughout the 2018 season, with one of those match-ups being the Stage 2 Semifinals – a game in which Philadelphia won. Overall, Philadelphia had beaten London in three out of their five match-ups.\nLondon Spitfire.\nCloud9 was awarded the London slot for an OWL franchise on August 10, 2017, and was later named the London Spitfire. Shortly afterwards, they disclosed their 12-player inaugural season roster, the maximum permitted, which would be entirely composed of South Korean players. The roster would mainly be an amalgamation of their current Cloud9 KONGDOO core and OGN's Overwatch APEX Season 4 champions GC Busan.\nLondon started the season with a win to the a 3–1 victory over the Florida Mayhem and continued that winning trend through their first five games, resulting in the team's best win streak of the 2018 regular season. They would end Stage 1 of the 2018 Season with a record, earning them the third and final spot in the Stage 1 Playoffs. The team then became the first-ever stage playoffs champions, after achieving victories over the Houston Outlaws (3–1) and the New York Excelsior (3–2) in a reverse sweep. On March 7, midway through Stage 2, the Spitfire parted ways with head coach Lee \"Bishop\" Beom-joon for undisclosed reasons. The team finished Stage 2 with an improved record and attained another stage playoffs berth. However, they fell short to the Philadelphia Fusion in a 2–3 semi-finals series. As the season progressed, the Spitfire experienced a slight dip in form during Stages 3 and 4, resulting in a combined record of . Despite this relative downturn, the team's performance during the first half of the season secured their berth in the season playoffs as the fifth seed.\nLondon lost their first postseason matchup against the Gladiators on July 11 by a score of 0–3 in the quarterfinals. The Spitfire turned it around the next two games against the Gladiators, winning in 3–0 sweeps in matches two and three and advancing the team to the semifinals. London won both games against the Los Angeles Valiant in the semifinals, winning 3–0 in match one and 3–1 in match two.\nPhiladelphia Fusion.\nOn September 20, 2017, Overwatch developer Activision Blizzard officially announced that Philadelphia Flyers owner Comcast Spectacor had acquired the rights to the Philadelphia-based Overwatch League franchise; later the team name was revealed as the Philadelphia Fusion. Shortly afterwards on November 3, their roster was revealed.\nPhiladelphia's first regular season OWL match was a 3–2 victory against the Houston Outlaws on January 11. On January 25, Philadelphia upset the undefeated New York Excelsior, which marked New York's only loss in Stage 1. With a lack of preparation time heading into the regular season, the team struggled for form in Stage 1 and would only manage to notch six victories, missing the Stage 1 Playoffs. Using the stage-break to catch up on lost practice time and welcoming the arrival of Israeli DPS player Josue \"Eqo\" Corana, Stage 2 would prove to be a turning point for the team. After opening up the stage with back-to-back sweeps over the Boston Uprising and Florida Mayhem, the team would continue to impress and go on to achieve a much improved 3rd-place finish – good enough for a stage playoffs berth. During the Stage 2 Playoffs, the team surprised many after defeating heavily favored Stage 1 champions London Spitfire in the semi-finals, however a finals match-up with the New York Excelsior would prove a juggernaut too much as the Fusion would fall short in a hard-fought 5-map match. Heading into the final match of Stage 3 on May 5, the Fusion needed a win over the Los Angeles Valiant for a shot to claim the 4th seed in the Stage 3 playoff bracket. However, the Valiant proved too much to handle, as they defeated the Fusion by a score of 3–2 and claimed the 4th seed for their own. After Dallas Fuel's upset 3–1 win over the Los Angeles Valiant on June 15, Philadelphia needed a 4–0 sweep over the London Spitfire in order to make the Stage 4 Playoffs. While the Fusion were victorious in that matchup, they were only able to win by a score of 3–1 and subsequently, missed the Stage 4 Playoffs. Philadelphia Fusion claimed the 6th seed in the Season Playoffs on June 15, after Seoul Dynasty lost to the Los Angeles Gladiators.\nFusion defeated third-seeded Boston Uprising in the quarterfinals by two matches to one. The team went on to face the top-seeded New York Excelsior in the semifinals, a game the Fusion were considered heavy underdogs. Philadelphia dominated New York in the first match, winning three maps to zero, and took the second match by three maps to two.\nVenue and ticketing.\nThe Barclays Center in New York was selected as the 2018 OWL Grand Finals host venue on May 9, 2018. Overwatch League commissioner Nate Nanzer emphasized that two factors influenced the decision to select the Barclays Center as the grand finals host: the venue's location in a prominent global city and its world-class status. Nanzer also acknowledged the fervent fanbase of the New York Excelsior (NYXL), stating that the support from NYXL fans played a role in selecting New York as the host city. Opened in 2012, the $1 billion stadium has a capacity of about 19,000 and is used by the Brooklyn Nets of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the New York Islanders of the National Hockey League (NHL). The arena has also hosted concerts, conventions and other sporting and entertainment events, including the 2013 NBA draft, the 2015 NBA All-Star Weekend, the 2016 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, UFC 223, and the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards.\nTicket sales for the finals began on May 18, 2018. Two-day general admission tickets sold for $60. Fans also had the option to upgrade their packages. The \"Grandmaster\" package, priced at $75, and the \"Master\" package, priced at $40, offered exclusive perks, including the chance to take photos with Overwatch League players, attend meet-and-greets with players, and receive Overwatch League merchandise, or \"swag\". Within a few hours of being on sale, the Grandmaster package upgrades were entirely sold out, leaving only the General Admission tickets and the Master package upgrades. The remaining tickets for the event sold-out exactly two weeks later, leaving resell tickets in excess of $125.\nBroadcast and viewership.\nOn the first day of the season playoffs, Disney and Blizzard announced a multi-year partnership that would bring the league and other professional \"Overwatch\" competitive events to ESPN, Disney XD, and ABC, starting with the playoffs and throughout all of the following season. The partnership marked the time that a live esports competition had aired on ESPN in prime time and the first time that an esports competition had aired on ABC. \nThe Nielsen ratings for the Grand Finals broadcasts on ESPN and ABC were relatively low compared to other programs that aired in similar time slots. The full Friday broadcast on ESPN received a 0.18 rating, while a later ESPN2 re-airing of digital coverage managed a 0.05 rating. ABC's Sunday afternoon recap achieved a 0.3 rating. These ratings, when translated into household estimates, indicated the viewership numbers as 215,280 households for the Friday broadcast on ESPN, 59,800 households for the Saturday re-airing on ESPN2, and 358,800 households for Sunday's recap on ABC. However, Nielsen estimates are based on television-owning households in the United States and don not provide a comprehensive view of viewership patterns. Additionally, comparing Nielsen ratings to concurrent viewers on platforms like Twitch, where Overwatch League's grand finals broadcasts garnered between 150,000 and 350,000 concurrent viewers, can be challenging as households and viewers are not equivalent.\nAccording to a press release from Blizzard, the Overwatch League Grand Finals achieved a global viewership of 10.8million across the two days. This number was attained through a combination of officially partnered streaming platforms, including Twitch, ESPN, MLG, and Chinese partners ZhanQi TV, NetEase CC, and Panda TV. The Finals were also aired on South Korea's MBC network with a slight delay. Among all of these platforms, the average minute audience was reported to be 861,205 over both days. Blizzard reported that the United States accounted for 289,175 of the average minute viewers, encompassing both the Twitch stream and the ESPN broadcast. The remaining substantial portion of the audience hailed from international markets, with the Chinese market likely playing a significant role. Chinese streaming numbers can be intricate due to challenges such as botting, which involves creating fake users to inflate viewer numbers, and differences in metrics used by various websites to calculate the number of viewers.\nEntertainment.\nThe 2018 Overwatch League Grand Finals featured a lineup of entertainment performances. David Garibaldi, an artist known for his Speed painting abilities, created his own take on the Overwatch League logo. Blizzard said that one fan would have the opportunity to receive the artwork as a special memento. DJ Mick entertained the audience on Friday during breaks in the broadcast. Meanwhile, DJ Envy opened for DJ Khaled and performed during breaks on Saturday.\nOn July 25, 2018, the Overwatch League announced that the Grand Finals would be opening with a live performance from DJ Khaled. However, the decision to have DJ Khaled as the opening act received mixed reactions from the online community. A notable point of contention surrounding DJ Khaled's performance stemmed from his past remarks, which were deemed sexist in nature. In an interview, he made statements suggesting that he expects certain actions from his wife, which he himself may not reciprocate. This led to criticism and backlash from some members of the public. Overwatch League host Malik Forté also expressed his thoughts on the artist choice on Twitter, emphasizing the importance of mutual respect and equal treatment within relationships. Past BlizzCon events had successfully featured artists like Weird Al Yankovic and Muse, prompting some to suggest that the League could have considered alternative artists from the area who had not been involved in similar controversies. \nHe performed live at the Barclays Center on July 28, prior to the first match of the second day. The performance was streamed live exclusively on Twitch. During his performance, DJ Khaled made several attempts to engage the audience by encouraging them to sing along to his songs. However, it became evident that the crowd was not familiar with the lyrics, resulting in awkward moments of deafening silence. Despite the challenges, DJ Khaled continued with his performance, incorporating DJ medleys and additional vocals. Twitter users were quick to respond to the performance, with many offering humorous takes on the situation. While DJ Khaled demonstrated professionalism by completing the entire 15-minute performance, the overall reception was mixed, with some viewers questioning whether he was the most suitable choice for the Overwatch League event. The performance sparked discussions within the \"Overwatch\" community about music preferences and the choice of DJ Khaled as the opening act.. Tatjana Vejnovic of \"Overwatch Wire\" described the performance as \"the worst one [she's] ever witnessed... the performance should be categorized as a disaster.\"\nMatch summaries.\nMatch one.\nMap 1: Dorado.\nThe 2018 Overwatch League Grand Finals commenced with the escort map Dorado. At the beginning of the match, the Philadelphia Fusion, who had a 70% win rate on the map, advanced a payload through the map with ease. Led by Sado, who was playing as Reinhardt, they charged forward aggressively. On the other hand, the London Spitfire appeared somewhat unsettled and unprepared. Throughout the match, several players made uncharacteristic errors. As the game progressed, however, the Spitfire gradually regained their composure and began performing more steadily. The Philadelphia Fusion capitalized on the Spitfire's overaggressive positioning around the payload. Key plays by their players, such as Eqo on Hanzo and Carpe on Widowmaker, allowed them to gain ground effectively. Eqo's precise arrow shots and Carpe's eliminations of enemy players supported their team's dominance. As the match transitioned to the map's interior areas, the London Spitfire's defense improved notably. Birdring's Genji play and Fury's performance as D.Va made it harder for the Fusion to make further progress. However, Fusion's Hotba utilized D.Va's \"self-destruct\" ability, eliminating Gesture, a key player from the Spitfire team, and creating an advantageous opportunity for the Fusion. They capitalized on this advantage, overpowering the Spitfire and securing a 3–0 map lead.\nAs the London Spitfire transitioned to their attack phase, they appeared entirely undeterred by the previous defensive collapse. The Spitfire exhibited an impressive start, and at one point, it seemed likely that they would achieve a full payload capture with four minutes left on the clock. As the payload reached its final destination inside the building at the end of Dorado, the Philadelphia Fusion seemed to awaken to the urgency of the situation. With just meters remaining for the payload to reach its final destination and nearly three minutes on the clock, the Spitfire encountered a formidable obstacle against the Fusion's defense, led by Eqo on Hanzo and Carpe on Widowmaker. These two snipers consistently inflicted substantial damage on the attacking Spitfire, causing considerable disruption to their progress. In combination with the effective coordination of Hotba on D.Va and Sado on Winston, who provided crucial cleanup support, the Fusion managed to hold their ground and turn the tables on the Spitfire. Despite the Spitfire's earlier dominance, the tide shifted drastically, and the Philadelphia Fusion turned the situation in their favor. They held firm against London's efforts and repelled the attack, securing at victory from what appeared to be an impending defeat.\nMap 2: Oasis.\nDuring the second map, Oasis, the London Spitfire maintained their aggressive momentum, reminiscent of their performance at the beginning of Dorado. The Spitfire swiftly secured control of the capture area, establishing a dominant offensive presence, led by Fury's Roadhog and Birdring's Hanzo. The Philadelphia Fusion initially appeared somewhat shaken by the Spitfire's assertive playstyle but managed to regain composure. They found success by relying on Eqo's Pharah play and Sado's performance as a tank. Through coordinated efforts, the Fusion were able to capture the point and secure approximately 49% control. Despite the Fusion's efforts, the Spitfire showcased resilient defense, preventing the Fusion from gaining further control, and won the round.\nThe Philadelphia Fusion adjusted their strategy to a more balanced team composition after their initial approach failed. This change allowed Carpe to showcase his skills as Tracer. Philadelphia managed to secure control of the point and gained 41% of control before the London Spitfire mounted a comeback. Led by Gesture and Bdosin, who played Zenyatta, the Spitfire took charge and successfully cleared out most of the Philadelphia damage heroes, seizing control of the point for themselves. Birdring's performance across multiple heroes was pivotal in the Spitfire's success on Oasis. His 15 eliminations to only 2 deaths showcased his effectiveness in working with the frontline to control Carpe's Widowmaker and limit his impact on the match. Despite a brief scare, the Spitfire outlasted the Fusion and secured a convincing victory, resulting in a 1–1 tie as they headed into halftime.\nMap 3: Eichenwalde.\nComing out of the half-time break and into the third map of the night, hybrid map Eichenwalde, the Fusion subbed-in tank player Gael \"Poko\" Gouzerch for Isaac \"Boombox\" Charles. Philadelphia managed to regain momentum by swiftly capturing the opening point. However, after the initial capture and a brief push of the payload, the London Spitfire regrouped and took advantage of Philadelphia's challenging choke point position on the map. Leveraging the map's topography, the Spitfire effectively stalled and wasted valuable time from the Fusion's clock. As the clock dwindled down to about a minute, the Fusion finally began moving the payload, progressing it towards the bridge of Eichenwalde. Nonetheless, the Spitfire's tank line, particularly Gesture's Winston, dominated the remainder of the match and halted Philadelphia's progress along the way.\nThe London Spitfire encountered difficulties when it was their turn to attack. For nearly three minutes, they struggled to make any significant progress against the defense of the Philadelphia Fusion. However, with about 50 seconds remaining, the Spitfire executed a decisive push and successfully captured the point, thanks in part to Gesture's performance on Winston, which proved instrumental once again. Although the Philadelphia Fusion had a strong start, they faced a swift breakdown in their defense. Bdosin's Tracer, who had been a constant threat throughout the match, secured crucial eliminations for the Spitfire during their payload push, propelling them to victory. As a result of the Spitfire's successful attack and capture of the point, they took the map victory, securing a 2–1 lead in the series.\nMap 4: Volskaya Industries.\nThe fourth, and final, map of the night was the assault map Volskaya Industries. Needing a win to save the series, the Philadelphia Fusion encountered initial challenges, struggling to make significant progress on the opening point against the defense of the Spitfire. Despite the tough start, the Fusion found a glimmer of hope when a few careless mistakes by the Spitfire players allowed Poko on D.Va and Eqo on Zarya to execute a near team kill. This play enabled the Fusion to seize control of the opening point with approximately one minute remaining. Although the Fusion capitalized on this opportunity, they faced a different story when it came to Point B. After initially capturing half of the point, they found themselves at a loss against the Spitfire, particularly against Profit's play as Mei. The Spitfire's solid defense prevailed, thwarting the Fusion's efforts to complete the map.\nOn the attacking side, the Spitfire faced an equally slow start due to a formidable defensive effort from the Fusion. Unconventional in their approach, the Fusion adopted a more aggressive defensive style, led by Hotba on Roadhog, which proved highly successful in nearly fully holding London off the point. Despite facing a tight situation and limited time on the clock, the Spitfire secured a crucial elimination on Mercy, shifting the momentum in their favor and capturing Point A. The ensuing gameplay witnessed a tense back-and-forth exchange. However, in the closing moments, Profit swapped to Tracer and picked up five critical final blows in a span of 93 seconds, and the Spitfire captured Point B, securing the victory in the series.\nMatch two.\nMap 1: Junkertown.\nEscort map Junkertown was the first map of the night, and Philadelphia was the first to attack. The Fusion launched their offense with a Bastion composition, effectively shielded for a powerful push. While the London Spitfire put up a fight, the Fusion managed to advance swiftly through the first two sections of the map. However, as they entered the last third of the map, the Fusion was shut down. With less than two minutes remaining, Profit's Hanzo, combined with Gesture's well-timed halt ability as Orisa, unleashed a Dragonstrike that eliminated four members of the Philadelphia Fusion, effectively halting their advance.\nOn London's attack, Gesture on Orisa and Bdosin on Roadhog consistently combined their abilities to create a force that proved challenging for the Philadelphia Fusion to defend against. Despite the Fusion's efforts, Poko, who started as the flex tank in place of Hotba, continued to impress with his performance. Poko executed a three-kill D.Va bomb, successfully slowing down the Spitfire's advance towards the second point. However, the London Spitfire displayed relentless determination, and their coordinated play proved overwhelming. They decisively rolled over the Philadelphia Fusion, securing a 3-2 map victory and establishing a 1-0 lead in the series after Map 1.\nMap 2: Lijiang Tower.\nThe second map of the night was Lijiang Tower. On the first sub-map, Night Market, the Spitfire completely dismantled the Fusion, strategically forcing them into vulnerable positions and capitalizing on those opportunities to pick off their opponents. London executed their game plan flawlessly, preventing the Fusion from gaining a single percentage on Night Market, resulting in a decisive victory for the Spitfire.\nMoving on to the second sub-map, Garden, the Spitfire continued their aggressive playstyle. Although the Fusion managed to gain a foothold on the objective, While the Fusion managed to establish a foothold on the point, Carpe's exceptional Widowmaker play proved instrumental as he battled against Gesture's Winston, landing crucial headshots. Despite Carpe's efforts, the Spitfire had already amassed an overwhelming 99% control. The Fusion managed to make a bit of a resurgence, reaching 38% control, but the Spitfire pushed the Philadelphia Fusion off the point and securing a resounding 2–0 victory on Lijiang Tower.\nMap 3: King's Row.\nThe third, and final, map of the day was hybrid map King's Row. Philadelphia commenced their attack run against the London Spitfire with both teams opting for a single support composition. Boombox and Bdosin played Roadhog, while neptuNo and Nus assumed the role of Mercy. The Fusion swiftly secured Point A after Carpe's Widowmaker landed critical headshots, but they encountered some difficulties on Point B. As the payload advanced through the streets of King's Row, Profit's Junkrat served as a constant annoyance as a flanker. Additionally, Bdosin's aggressive Zenyatta play added further pressure to the Fusion, as he executed his own flanks. Despite the Spitfire's attempts to impede their push, the Fusion kept the momentum alive through the second checkpoint with 1:30 remaining on the clock. As the Fusion turned the corner, Neptuno moved in to resurrect Sado, but he was killed. Soon after, Fury used his Self Destruct to eliminate two more Fusion players. As London had no more ultimates, the Fusion were able to finish the map in overtime.\nIt was then the London Spitfire's turn to attack, they struggled to capture the first point. With just under two minutes remaining, the Spitfire transitioned to a triple-tank, triple-support composition and captured Point A. The composition featured Reinhardt and Brigitte, which lacked mobility and resurrection capabilities, forcing the Spitfire to reset. With Gesture's Earthshatter, London managed to advance the payload to Point B with 2:18 remaining to complete the map. The Spitfire completed King's Row with 1:10 left on the clock.\nSince London was the only team to finish their attack run with time remaining on the clock, they were granted another chance to attack. With only one tick needed on Point A to secure victory, the Spitfire swiftly capitalized on their advantage. London wasted no time and quickly gained control, effectively boxing out the Fusion and securing the crucial first elimination. Within seconds, the Spitfire won the map."

The championships were held from February to June in seven countries across five continents and served as a qualifying event for Paralympic swimming at the 2020 Summer Paralympics. The event was sponsored by Allianz.\nIn 2017, the IPC announced that the event would be hosted in Kuching, Malaysia. However, on 27 January 2019, Malaysia were stripped of their hosting rights because their government refused to allow Israeli athletes into the country to compete.\nOn 15 April 2019, London, United Kingdom was announced as the new host for the championships, now rescheduled to take place from 9 - 15 September.\nHost selection.\nIn September 2017, World Para Swimming (formerly IPC Swimming) granted hosting rights to Kuching, Malaysia, who prevailed over a bid from London in Great Britain. The award was made with the understanding that they would permit all qualified athletes to compete. In 2019, as part of a solidarity move with the Palestinian National Authority, Malaysia announced that they would ban Israeli athletes from entering the event in a move that was supported by 29 Malaysian non-governmental organizations. The Malaysian Paralympic Council said they were following a Malaysian government policy to bar Israelis from competition as Malaysia bans Israeli passport holders from entering the country. After a meeting held in London, the IPC decreed that this was a politically motivated exclusion and stripped Malaysia of their hosting rights. This came after an Israel Foreign Affairs Ministry statement saying the ban of Israeli athletes was \"shameful and totally opposes the Olympic spirit\". Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad stood by the decision, calling Israel \"a country which does not obey international laws\" and said \"I don't understand because the world has the power but still has to listen to Israel.\"\nThe IPC requested bids as stand-in hosts by 11 February. London was selected to host the championships at the Queen Elizabeth Park in April 2019.\nParticipating nations.\n637 swimmers from 73 nations participated.\nEvents.\nThe series was held at venues in seven countries. Events commenced on 15 February in Melbourne, Australia. Further events were held in April in Indianapolis, São Paulo and Glasgow, in May in Singapore, in May and June in Lignano Sabbiadoro, and in Berlin on 9 June.\nThe championships served as one of the qualifying events for swimming at the 2020 Summer Paralympics in Tokyo, Japan.\nMedal table.\nThe medals table as of day 7.\nBroken records.\nA total of 188 records were broken during the Championships: 39 World records, 55 Championship records, 22 African and Oceanian records, 21 Asian records, 17 American records and 12 European records.\nSchedule.\nPurple squares mark final heats scheduled.\nMulti-medalists.\nList of male and female multi-medalists who have won three gold medals or five medals."

        "text": "The Tip, sometimes referred to as the Immaculate Deflection, was a play in the in the National Football League (NFL) between the #5 seeded San Francisco 49ers and the #1 seeded Seattle Seahawks. The game was played in CenturyLink Field (now known as Lumen Field) in Seattle, Washington and, being the NFC Championship Game, was televised nationally on Fox.\nWith the score 23–17 in favor of the Seahawks, the 49ers had driven the ball all the way to the Seahawks' 18 yard line. With 30 seconds left in regulation, 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick threw a pass to Michael Crabtree in the right corner of the endzone. Before Crabtree could catch the ball, cornerback Richard Sherman deflected the ball directly into linebacker Malcolm Smith's hands for an interception, all but sealing the Seahawks victory. With the win, the Seahawks advanced to just their second Super Bowl appearance in franchise history, in which they defeated the Denver Broncos 43–8 for their first Super Bowl win. The Tip is often considered one of the biggest moments in Seattle Seahawks history.\nEvents of the play.\nUntil the fourth quarter, the Seahawks had not had a lead the entire game. That changed when Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson threw a 35-yard touchdown pass to Jermaine Kearse with 13:44 left in the game, making the score 20–17. After a 47-yard field goal by Steven Hauschka with 3:37 left, the lead increased to 23–17.\nThe 49ers moved the ball quickly to the 18 yard line, needing a touchdown and subsequent extra point to retake the lead. With 30 seconds remaining, 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick avoided mounting pressure from defensive end Cliff Avril, launching a pass to Michael Crabtree in the right side of the endzone. Before Crabtree could catch the ball, cornerback Richard Sherman leaped into the air and tipped the ball. It promptly landed into the hands of linebacker Malcolm Smith, who took a knee for a Seattle touchback with 22 seconds left in the game.\nAfter the play.\nAfter a brief celebration, Sherman ran over to Crabtree and offered his hand for a handshake, but Crabtree shoved Sherman's facemask. Sherman then directed a choke sign at Crabtree, which earned him an unsportsmanlike conduct flag. Since there was still 22 seconds left, the game continued. Russell Wilson knelt three times, causing the 49ers to burn their last two timeouts, and the game was over.\nRichard Sherman's post-game interview.\nThe following is Sherman's now-famous post-game interview with Erin Andrews:\nMany considered Sherman's outburst as immature, rude, and disrespectful toward Crabtree and Andrews. Sherman later said in a CNN interview \"You know, I don't mean to attack [Crabtree]. And that was immature and I probably shouldn't have done that. I regret doing that.\"\nName.\nThe play was later dubbed the Immaculate Deflection as a tribute to the Immaculate Reception. The plays were somewhat similar: in both plays, the pass was deflected into a teammate's hand. However, the Immaculate Deflection resulted in an interception, whereas with the Immaculate Reception, it was caught by the offense and run in for a touchdown.\nAftermath.\nThe Seahawks went on to blow out the Denver Broncos 43–8 in Super Bowl XLVIII two weeks later, winning their first Lombardi Trophy in team history. The 49ers, however, did not return to the postseason until 2019, also failing to climb above the .500 mark in terms of their win–loss record in each of the following seasons until 2019. Some credit Sherman's tip with the steady decline of the 49ers. Coincidentally, Sherman joined the 49ers in 2018.\nSix days after the Championship game, Sherman was fined $7,875 for his unsportsmanlike conduct penalty toward Crabtree.\nIn 2018 in a week 13 matchup between the 49ers and the Seahawks, the Seahawks reenacted Sherman's tip after a 1st quarter touchdown pass. Doug Baldwin played the role of Sherman, tipping the ball to David Moore, who played the role of Malcolm Smith. Jaron Brown played Kaepernick, and Tyler Lockett played Crabtree. Since both Sherman and Smith were currently on the 49ers, it was unsure if it was a tribute to Sherman, or a mockery, especially after Sherman called the Seahawks a middle of the road team prior to the game. The Seahawks won the game 43-16 and officially eliminated the 49ers from playoff contention."

In total, 47 events were held during the season: however, the ending of the season was highly disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. 18 world ranking tournaments were planned to take place, but only 17 were played. An event was held in Austria, the first time in any snooker season, while the 2020 China Open was cancelled. The Tour Championship and the World Snooker Championship were postponed, and the Gibraltar Open played with no audience. The season contained 128 professional tour players, 35 of which had been given new two-year places on the tour from a combination of invitations and qualifying events.\nJudd Trump, the reigning world champion, won a record six ranking titles for a season. Trump also became the second player ever to compile over 100 century breaks in a season. Ronnie O'Sullivan won the 2020 World Snooker Championship, defeating Kyren Wilson with a score of 18–8. By doing so O'Sullivan also won his 37th ranking title, the most of any player. The other Triple Crown championships were the 2019 UK Championship, won by Ding Junhui, and the 2020 Masters, won by Stuart Bingham.\nPlayers.\nThe World Snooker Tour in the 2019–20 season consisted of a field of 128 professional players.

Eight places were also given to players who were highest on the one-year ranking list, but had not already qualified after the previous tour.\nThe remaining places were offered by means of invitation and by competing in qualifying events.

        "text": "The 2020 Pro Bowl was the National Football League's all-star game for the 2019 NFL season. It was played on January 26, 2020, at Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Florida, and was televised nationally by ESPN, while being simulcast on ABC and Disney XD.\nFan voting began on November 12, 2019, and ended on December 12, 2019. The initial roster was released on December 17, 2019. The Baltimore Ravens tied an NFL record (set by the 2007 Dallas Cowboys) by having 13 players selected to the game. The coaching staff for the AFC was led by John Harbaugh of the Baltimore Ravens, and for the NFC by Pete Carroll of the Seattle Seahawks. The AFC won the game, 38–33.\nThis was the first occasion since the 1995 season that the New York Giants had no player make the Pro Bowl.\nThe game was largely overshadowed by the news of NBA legend Kobe Bryant's death in a helicopter crash on the day the game was held, which also claimed the lives of his 13-year-old daughter Gianna, and 7 other victims. The tragedy prompted the NFL to conduct a moment of silence during the game for Bryant and the other victims of the crash, with various on-field tributes occurring during the game.\nBackground.\nThe NFL's three-year contract with Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Florida, expired after the 2019 game. The league explored alternative sites, including hosting the game in Miami a week after the Super Bowl. In August 2019, the NFL decided to keep the game in Orlando for an additional year.\nRule changes.\nAs in previous years, some rules for the Pro Bowl were different from the regular season. Some of the rules used in this game were:\nAFC roster.\nThe following players were selected as the AFC Pro Bowl Team:\nNFC roster.\nThe following players were selected as the NFC Pro Bowl Team:\nSpecial teams.\nNotes:\nPlayers must have accepted their invitations as alternates to be listed; those who declined are not considered Pro Bowlers.\nBroadcasting.\nThe game was televised nationally by ESPN, while being simulcast on ABC and Disney XD, and in Spanish by ESPN Deportes.\nEarly in the first quarter, an ABC News special report (simulcast on ESPN, with Disney XD continuing on with game coverage) interrupted the game to announce the death of NBA legend Kobe Bryant in a helicopter crash earlier in the day; before the game, NFC players who learned of his death conducted a prayer led by Wilson, while various on-field tributes were made during the game. With coverage of Bryant's death becoming a certain and continuing theme of the game coverage, it was decided to end the Disney XD simulcast with nine minutes remaining in the second quarter and switch that network to an impromptu marathon of \"Big City Greens\"."

On March 26, 2020, MLB and the MLBPA reached a deal that included the option to shorten the draft to five rounds, and also shorten the 2021 draft to 20 rounds due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In a plan to allow teams to sign an unlimited number of undrafted players for $20,000 each, MLB ultimately opted to shorten the 2020 draft to five rounds. The draft was originally planned to be hosted live for the first time in Omaha, Nebraska, to accompany the since-cancelled 2020 College World Series. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the draft was instead held remotely from MLB Network's studios in Secaucus, New Jersey. With sponsorship from T-Mobile, the event was officially the 2020 MLB Draft Presented by T-Mobile, with ESPN providing live coverage for the first time since 2008, alongside MLB Network.\nThe Detroit Tigers, who had the worst record of the 2019 MLB season, selected Spencer Torkelson with the first overall pick in the draft. As punishment for their role in the sign stealing scandal, the Houston Astros forfeited their first- and second-round picks in the draft. The Boston Red Sox also forfeited their second-round pick in the draft as punishment for their own sign-stealing violations. Among the selected players, there were 41 who had played for the United States national baseball team and 2 who had played for the Canada national baseball team.\nOn September 18, 2020, the Chicago White Sox promoted Garrett Crochet to the major leagues, becoming the first MLB player in six years to reach the big leagues in the same year in which he was drafted."

        "text": "Elections to the National Baseball Hall of Fame for 2021 proceeded according to rules most recently amended in 2016. As in the past, the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) voted by mail to select from a ballot of recently retired players. The results were announced on January 26, 2021, with no players receiving enough votes to be inducted.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, meetings of the Early Baseball committee and Golden Days committee—two of a group of four bodies generally referred to as the Veterans Committee—which were scheduled to consider players from the 1871–1949 and 1950–1969 eras, respectively, were postponed from December 2020 to December 2021.\nThis was the first time since 2013 that the BBWAA did not elect a player to the Hall of Fame, and the first time since 1960 that no one was selected for induction to the Hall, either via the BBWAA or one of the Veterans Committees.\nAlso due to the COVID-19 pandemic, four people elected to the Hall in 2020 balloting—Derek Jeter, Larry Walker, Ted Simmons, and Marvin Miller—who were originally scheduled to be inducted on July 26, 2020, were inducted during 2021 ceremonies. The 2021 formal induction ceremonies in Cooperstown, New York, were originally planned to be held indoors and without spectators on July 25, 2021, then were moved to September 8, 2021.\nBallot.\nThe list of players appearing on the ballot was released on November 16, 2020. There were 14 players carried over from the prior year's ballot, who garnered at least 5% of the vote and were still eligible for election, and 11 players who appeared on the ballot for the first time, whose last major league appearance was in 2015 and were chosen by a screening committee. A player must receive at least 75% of the votes cast to be elected. A total of 2365 votes were cast for individual players, an average of 5.9 votes per ballot\nPlayers who met first-year eligibility requirements but were \"not\" selected by the screening committee for inclusion on the ballot included: Jeremy Affeldt, Scott Baker, Jeff Baker, Grant Balfour, Clint Barmes, Joe Beimel, Rafael Betancourt, Willie Bloomquist, Alberto Callaspo, Bruce Chen, Randy Choate, Kevin Correia, Neal Cotts, David DeJesus, Chris Denorfia, Jeff Francis, Jason Frasor, Jonny Gomes, Kevin Gregg, Aaron Harang, Corey Hart, Reed Johnson, Dan Johnson, Gerald Laird, Adam LaRoche, Jason Marquis, David Murphy, Wil Nieves, Alex Rios, Wandy Rodriguez, Cody Ross, Skip Schumaker, Grady Sizemore, Rafael Soriano, Tim Stauffer, Dan Uggla, C. J. Wilson, Randy Wolf and Delmon Young.\nJ. G. Taylor Spink Award.\nThe J. G. Taylor Spink Award has been awarded annually since 1962; it is named after J. G. Taylor Spink, publisher of \"The Sporting News\" from 1914 until his death in 1962, and first recipient of the award. It recognizes \"meritorious contributions to the field of baseball writing\". Past honorees include Ring Lardner, Grantland Rice, Damon Runyon, and Shirley Povich. The results of voting for the 2021 award were announced on December 8, 2020:\nIn February 2021, the award was renamed as the BBWAA Career Excellence Award, after the BBWAA voted to remove Spink's name \"due to Spink’s troubled history in supporting segregated baseball.\"\nFord C. Frick Award.\nThe Ford C. Frick Award has been presented annually to a preeminent baseball broadcaster since 1978. According to the Hall, the criteria adopted in July 2016 are \"Commitment to excellence, quality of broadcasting abilities, reverence within the game, popularity with fans, and recognition by peers.\" A new election cycle was established, rotating annually between \"Current Major League Markets\" (team-specific announcers) with the 2017 Frick Award; \"National Voices\" (broadcasters whose contributions were realized on a national level) with the 2018 Frick Award; and \"Broadcasting Beginnings\" (early team voices and pioneers of baseball broadcasting) with the 2019 Frick Award. Since this cycle repeats every three years, all finalists for the 2021 award were \"National Voices\".\nOn December 9, 2020, sportscaster Al Michaels was named the 2021 recipient of the Ford C. Frick Award. Before working nationally, Michaels was an announcer for the Cincinnati Reds and San Francisco Giants in the 1970s. Notable baseball events he called include the 1986 American League Championship Series and 1989 World Series. The eight finalists for the award were:"

        "title": "Sean Gleeson (American football)",
        "text": "Sean Gleeson is an American football coach and former player. He is a football analyst at the University of Missouri.\nPlaying career.\nGleeson grew up in Glen Ridge, New Jersey and briefly in Franklin, New Jersey before that. He played high school football for Glen Ridge High School, where he also played baseball and ice hockey. As starting QB, Gleeson led the Glen Ridge football squad to a winless season. He then spent a post-graduate year at Trinity-Pawling School in Pawling, New York. Gleeson then moved on to play quarterback at Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts from 2003 to 2006. In 2005, he led the NESCAC in passer rating with a rating of 163.6. In 2006, while splitting time as a senior, Gleeson helped lead his team to an 8–0 record, and combined with his co-quarterback partner to throw for over 4,000 yards, all while on the path to claiming the NESCAC title.\nCoaching career.\nDelbarton School.\nFollowing Gleeson's playing days and graduation from Williams College, he spent 2007 through 2010 at Delbarton School in Morristown, New Jersey. Here, he was a coach for football, baseball, and bowling.\nFairleigh Dickinson-Florham.\nIn 2011, Gleeson joined Brian Surace's staff at Fairleigh Dickinson-Florham as the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach.\nPrinceton.\nGleeson joined Bob Surace's (brother of FDU head coach Brian Surace) coaching staff at Princeton prior to the 2013 football season. He served as the running backs coach from 2013 through 2016. When Princeton offensive coordinator James Perry left to become the head coach at Bryant, Gleeson was promoted to offensive coordinator. In addition to this promotion, Gleeson shifted from coaching the running backs, to coaching the quarterbacks.\nThe following was taken from Gleeson's Biography page on the Princeton Athletics website:\n“In his first year as the quarterbacks coach, Gleeson oversaw a historic season for Chad Kanoff, who would go on to win the Bushnell Cup as the Ivy League Offensive Player of the Year. Kanoff broke the Princeton and Ivy League records for single-season passing yards with 3,474, and he also broke the Ivy League single-season completion percentage of 73.2, breaking the mark held by former Dallas Cowboys head coach and former Princeton Bushnell Cup winner Jason Garrett.\nIn 2018, he coordinated an offense that set an Ivy League record with 470 points. Princeton ranked second in the FCS in scoring and third in total offense, and it scored at least 40 points in eight of 10 games. For the first time in Ivy League history, Princeton had both finalists for the Offensive Player of the Year award, and quarterback John Lovett became only the fifth multiple-time Bushnell Cup winner in Ivy history.\nAs a coordinator, 18 members of the 2017 and 2018 Princeton offenses earned All-Ivy League honors, including first-team honors for Kanoff, WR Jesper Horsted (twice), and OL Mitchell Sweigart. Horsted ended his career with several single-season and career receiving records, while Sweigart became Princeton's first lineman to earn multiple first-team All-Ivy honors since 2000-01.”\nOklahoma State.\nOn January 27, 2019, Gleeson was announced as Mike Gundy's new offensive coordinator at Oklahoma State.\nRutgers.\nAfter one year at Oklahoma State University, Greg Schiano recruited Sean back to his home state of New Jersey. Gleeson accepted the same position that he had previously held at Oklahoma State University with Rutgers. The signed contract made Gleeson the highest paid assistant coach in Rutgers University history. On October 9, 2022, Sean was fired.\nNorthwestern.\nGleeson joined Northwestern Wildcats football in 2023 as a Senior Offensive Analyst.\nMissouri.\nGleeson joined Missouri Tigers football in 2023 as an Analyst.\nPersonal life.\nGleeson met his wife, Lauren, while they were both working at Delbarton School. They have three sons, Eamon, Patrick, and William. Gleeson also has two sisters, Carly and Haley, and a brother, Liam."

        "text": "Joseph Brady (born September 23, 1989) is an American football coach who is the offensive coordinator for the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League (NFL). He previously served as the offensive coordinator for the Carolina Panthers from 2020 to 2021. He was a passing game coordinator and wide receiver coach for the LSU Tigers during the 2019 season, winning the Broyles Award for the best assistant coach in college football, and an offensive assistant for the New Orleans Saints from 2017 to 2018. \nEarly life.\nSon of Joe and Jodi, brother of Jacey (former Miami Dolphins cheerleader), Brady was born in Miami Lakes, Florida and grew up in Pembroke Pines, Florida where he was a four-year letterwinner as a wide receiver at Everglades High School.\nPlaying career.\nBrady spent four years as a wide receiver for the William &amp; Mary Tribe from 2009–2012. As a junior, he appeared in all eleven games.\nCoaching career.\nNew Orleans Saints.\nIn 2017, Brady was hired by the New Orleans Saints as an offensive assistant under head coach Sean Payton.\nLSU.\nIn 2019, Brady joined head coach Ed Orgeron and the LSU Tigers as their passing game coordinator and wide receivers coach. Recognized as the top assistant coach during the 2019 college football season, Brady was honored with the 24th annual Broyles Award. Another highlight of his tenure was Joe Burrow winning the Heisman Trophy. Subsequently, he emerged as a leading candidate for numerous offensive coordinator vacancies in the NFL, but eventually agreed to a three-year contract extension with LSU, but he left for the NFL just days later anyway (see next paragraph).\nCarolina Panthers.\nOn January 16, 2020, Brady was hired by the Carolina Panthers as their offensive coordinator under head coach Matt Rhule. The Panthers \nstaff were selected to coach in the 2021 Senior Bowl, but Brady missed the game due to COVID-19 protocols. On December 5, 2021, Brady was fired by the Panthers.\nBuffalo Bills.\nOn February 4, 2022, Brady was hired by the Buffalo Bills as their quarterbacks coach. The Bills fired OC Ken Dorsey on November 14, 2023 after a 5–5 start to the 2023 season, and Brady was promoted to interim offensive coordinator. Under Brady, the Bills offense went from almost entirely focused on passing with quarterback Josh Allen and receiver Stefon Diggs to being more balanced and favoring running backs James Cook and Ty Johnson, also allowing Allen to run more. This new approach helped Buffalo win six of their final seven games to finish with an 11–6 record and their fourth consecutive AFC East title. The Bills promoted Brady to full-time offensive coordinator following the season."

The Spartans defeated Clarkson 6–1 in the championship game at the Williams Arena in Minneapolis, Minnesota. as of 2018, the 1965–66 Michigan State team has the worst record of any national champion for Division I (or equivalent) ice hockey.\nSeason.\nComing off of their first winning season in 3 years, Michigan State began the 1965–66 season on a sour note, losing both games at Colorado College and then continued their losing streak with the first two games of a three-game series against ECAC Hockey opponents. The Spartans finally earned a win against St. Lawrence to finish their road trip 1–4. State opened their home schedule against North Dakota with a split which continued with the succeeding two series against Denver and CC. MSU met their first Big Ten opponent when Minnesota arrived in mid-January but after the Golden Gophers handed Amo Bessone's team two losses the Spartans were wallowing near the bottom of their conference with a 3–7 record.\nThe only bright spot for MSU was that the WCHA had accepted Minnesota–Duluth into the conference and, as a result, changed the playoff format so all 8 teams would be included regardless of their records. MSU got back in the win column the following weekend against the Bulldogs, taking both games before travelling to Minneapolis to earn a split with the Gophers. MSU continued to slowly climb out of the cellar with two wins in their first home-and-home series with arch-rival Michigan and then extended their winning streak with two more wins against Wisconsin, bringing their all-time record against the Badgers to 6–0.\nWith a home playoff game in sight Michigan State was stopped dead in their tracks by defending national champion Michigan Tech who took two contests from the Spartans. MSU ended their regular season against Michigan with another home-and-home series but could only manage a split, finishing the season in 6th-place in the WCHA standings. Part of the rearrangement of the playoff system for the WCHA came with dividing the eight teams into two regions (east and west) with MSU being joined by Minnesota–Duluth, Michigan and Michigan Tech. Because Michigan had finished ahead of the Spartans (due to winning the final regular season game 1–0 in overtime), Michigan State had to open the conference tournament on the road. Despite the hostile crowd MSU was able to win the game against the 5th-place Wolverines and, because of an odd arrangement for the second round, headed back home for a match against top-seeded Michigan Tech. With the Spartan faithful cheering them on, Michigan State upset the Huskies 4–3, winning their first WCHA Tournament (shared with Denver) and advanced to their second NCAA Tournament.\nDespite having a worse record than Denver, Michigan State was slated to play lower-seeded Boston University in the opening round, a team who was only in the tournament because ECAC runner-up Cornell declined the invitation. Michigan State's showed up in full force against the Terriers, holding BU to a single goal and winning a nail-biter 2–1 to advance to the title game. They met Clarkson for the championship, but unusually for an east-vs.-west matchup the two teams were familiar with one another with Clarkson having won a game early in the season. However, past was not prologue in this case and team captain Mike Coppo opened the scoring in the fifteenth minute of the opening frame. Clarkson tied the score just over three minutes later but that was the only goal they could get past Gaye Cooley and MSU began a string of five uninterrupted goals late in the second to win their first National championship.\nBrian McAndrew, Mike Coppo, Don Heaphy and Gaye Cooley were all named to the All-Tournament first team while Bob Brawley and Tom Mikkola made the second team. Cooley was named Tournament Most Outstanding Player and, because of his job shepherding the Spartans through early-season injury and ice trouble, Amo Bessone shared the Spencer Penrose Award for national coach of the year with Clakrson's Len Ceglarski, the only time in history the award was split (as of 2018). The team's leading scorer, Doug Volmar was the only Spartan to be named to the AHCA All-American West Team or the All-WCHA First Team while none made it onto the WCHA Second Team.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#007A53\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#007A53\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#007A53\" | "

The Crusaders are the newest member of the Hockey East Association (HEA). They play at the Hart Center in Worcester, Massachusetts.\nHistory.\nHoly Cross women's ice hockey became a varsity sport in 1999, after ten years as a club sport and two years as semi-varsity team. They joined the ECAC East conference, which later became the New England Hockey Conference (NEHC).\nJane Ford, former director of telecommunications for Holy Cross, served as head coach for the inaugural season. Then Peter VanBuskirk took over as head coach in the 2000–01 season, after having coached the Holy Cross men's ice hockey team for ten years. He was head coach for the women's team for nineteen years.\nHoly Cross finished first in their conference in the 2008–09 season, with a 24-2-1 record, and won the ECAC Open Championship against Sacred Heart by a score of 4-2. They had six post-season titles while playing in the ECAC East/NEHC: 2003, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2015, and 2016.\nAfter two years of discussions with the Hockey East Association, Holy Cross joined the conference for the 2018–19 season. They were the 10th team to join the conference.\nHoly Cross earned their first Hockey East win on November 30, 2018, in a 5–3 victory against the powerhouse Northeastern Huskies. Jada Brenon, the team's freshman goalie, made 34 saves in the win, which was played at home at the Hart Center.\nIn 2019, VanBuskirk retired as head coach. After nineteen seasons with the women's team, he finished with a record of 295-178-35. He was elected as an honorary member of the Holy Cross Athletic Hall of Fame in 2020.\nKatie Lachapelle stepped in as head coach in 2019–20, after serving as the associate head coach for two years. Prior to coming to Holy Cross, she had been assistant coach at Boston University for nine seasons. She has also been an assistant coach at Ohio State, Niagara, and Union. Lachapelle graduated from Providence College, where she played for the Friars. She was captain in her senior year and was on the ECAC All Star Team in 1997. In May 2020, Lachapelle was named as the head coach for the United States women's national under-18 ice hockey team. The IIHF subsequently canceled the 2021 U-18 Women's World Championships that had been scheduled to take place in January 2021.\nMeredith Roth joined the coaching staff as associate coach for the Crusaders in 2019, after serving as the head coach for the Green Knights women's ice hockey program at St. Norbert's College, in Division III NCAA ice hockey. Devan Taylor joined the coaching staff as assistant coach in 2020.\nIn the 2019–2020 season, the Crusaders recorded their first Hockey East series sweep, against the Merrimack Warriors. They finished the season in 9th place, with a 5-23-5 overall record.\nThe start of the 2020–21 season was delayed due to concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic. A modified schedule was released by the Hockey East Association in early November 2020, based on discussions by the Hockey East's Return to Play Task Force. Hockey East women's ice hockey teams, including Holy Cross, are scheduled to play 18 games that will count towards the final league standings. The Crusaders played their first series of the new season against the Maine Black Bears, on home ice, from November 20–21. Holy Cross lost the first match-up by a score of 2-1 but won the second game by a score of 3-2.\nThe team's co-captains for the 2020–2021 season are Carlie Magier, Antonia Matzuka, and Julia Pelletier.\nCoaches.\nSources:\nAwards and honors.\nECAC East Player of the Year.\nStacey Hochkins, 2010\nECAC Open Tournament Most Outstanding Player.\nStacey Hochkins, 2010\nCCM All American Team.\nStacey Hochkins, 2009–10 East Second Team All-Star\nStacey Hochkins, 2010–11 East Second Team All Star\nStacey Hochkins, 2011–12 East Second Team All Star\nNEHC Player of the Year.\nKara Violette, 2017 NEHC Player of the Year\nNEHC Rookie of the Week.\nJulie Matthias, 2015 (Nov 2 &amp; Dec 14)\nSam Girard, 2015 (Nov 9)\nDanielle Doherty, 2015 (Nov 23)\nHoly Cross Varsity Club Hall of Fame.\nThe following is a list of people associated with the Holy Cross women's ice hockey program who were elected into the Holy Cross Varsity Club Hall of Fame (induction date in parentheses).\nCurrent roster.\n&lt;section end=roster /&gt;"

        "text": "Three cities submitted bids to host the 1971 Pan American Games that were recognized by the Pan American Sports Organization. On July 22, 1967, Cali was selected over Santiago and Champ, Missouri by PASO at its general assembly, held at the Manitoba Medical College in Winnipeg, Canada, to host the VI Pan American Games.\nHost city selection.\nThirty committees took place in the vote in Winnipeg, with Honduras not voting. The debates took place before the Congress of PASO and lasted four hours. At 5:46 PM, President of the Mexican Olympic Committee Josué Sáenz announced the results: Cali 12 votes, Santiago 11 votes, and Champ 6 votes.\nCandidate cities.\nCali, Colombia.\nIn November 1964, delegates from Colombia announced that Cali would bid to be the host city for the 1971 Pan American Games, a bid that had the support of Governor of Valle del Cauca Humberto González Narváez, the Executive Director of the Vallecaucana Action Unit, and Mayor of Cali Artemo Franco Mejia. On April 8, 1965, the Cali host city committee was formed. The bid received further support from the Colombian Olympic Committee, Mexican Olympic Committee, and multiple Boards and Assemblies of Valle from July to October 1965.\nColombia had its share of success in hosting large sporting events such as the 1946 Central American and Caribbean Games. In response to Chile's remarks on the violent history of Colombia, the country noted the positive impact it would have, pointing out that the games would stabilize the country in that regard. Additionally, the city promised to build an Olympic village if they were awarded the games, and the village would be repurposed as a university campus afterwards.\nFinances were also a major focus in Cali's bid. At the time, Colombia had the second richest oil reserves of all Latin American countries, behind Venezuela, giving Colombia a large amount of money in its national treasury. The city made sure it was known, as well, as one spokesman pointed out, \"We don't like to say this, but we have the money and they don't.\" Cali's bid was presented by President of the City Council of Cali Hector Villegas, four of his council members, a senator, and National Olympic officials.\nSantiago, Chile.\nSantiago boasted its history of hosting large sporting events, such as the 1962 FIFA World Cup, 1986 South American Games, and 1986 Central American and Caribbean Games, which gave Chilean officials a wealth of experience hosting these types of games. The Mayor of Santiago also made a point to focus on the country's history of peace and non-violence—a point that was made to contrast that of Colombia's history. The city guaranteed an Olympic village if they were selected as the host city. Santiago's bid was presented by Mayor Manuel Fernandez, two Chilean cabinet ministers, and the president and vice-president of the Chilean Olympic Committee.\nChamp, United States.\nThe small town of Champ, adjacent to St. Louis, was a late entry to host the games. The delegation was led by a local businessman William Bangert. He planned to build a $150 million stadium with the capacity to hold 300,000 attendees. Additionally, the town was willing to cover the transportation, accommodation, and food expenses of all the delegation, and even more, President Lyndon B. Johnson had approved $20 million to organize the games. However, Champ was accused of attempting to \"buy\" votes due to these financial incentives.\nAdditionally, many believed that since Chicago had hosted the 1959 Pan American Games, the United States should not hold the 1971 games, as President of the PASO José de Jesús Clark Flóres even noted, \"According to Rule 23 of the PASO regulations: 'when two or more member countries of the PASO aspire to host a Pan American Games, they will prefer a country that has never organized them.'\""

A two-time All-American for both singles and doubles, Crowe was the 1982 AIAW singles champion and also helped guide Indiana to the team title that year. While at Indiana, she won the Broderick Award (now the Honda Sports Award) as the nation's top collegiate tennis player in 1982.\nAt the 1982 US Open, Crowe reached the third round of the singles main draw, with wins over Stacy Margolin and Barbara Hallquist.\nAs a doubles player she featured in the main draw of all four grand slam tournaments during her professional career and was runner-up at the Virginia Slims of Utah in 1984, partnering Robin White. Her most regular doubles partner on tour was Kim Steinmetz.\nShe retired from professional tennis in 1988 and has since become Heather Conner through marriage.\nIn 2011 she spoke publicly of having been sexually abused from the age of 14 by tennis player Bob Hewitt, who was coaching her at the time. The allegations led to an investigation into Hewitt, with more victims coming forward, ultimately leading to his imprisonment in South Africa."

At the Pan American Games (PASO ) Assembly, from November 12 to 14, 1986, in Bridgetown, Barbados, Mar del Plata withdrew its bid, leaving Havana as the winner to host the Games.\nCandidate cities.\nHavana, Cuba.\nAfter Santiago, Chile in 1983, and then subsequently Quito, Ecuador in 1984, forfeited being the host for the 1987 Pan American Games, Havana and Indianapolis presented themselves as candidates to hold the 1987 Games. In November 1984, the PASO General Assembly met in Mexico and voted Indianapolis as the host for the 1987 games. The United States Olympic Committee promised to not submit a bid for the 1991 Games, and them, along with PASO, guaranteed to support the Cuban candidacy to organize the 1991 Games.\nIn 1986, at the PASO Assembly in Barbados, Mar del Plata argued that, due to PASO regulations, Havana was not eligible to host the 1991 Games, since Central America's turn to host the games was in 1987. Cuba responded by threatening to boycott the 1987 Games if they were not awarded that 1991 games. This would have been an issue, as Cuba was the second-largest contender in the Pan Am Games.\nAs tensions grew between the committees, president of the Puerto Rico Olympic Committee, Germán Rieckehoff asked Mar del Plata if they would consider withdrawing their bid, noting that Argentina hosted the inaugural Pan American games, and Cuba had never held the games. To avoid discord in the Pan American unity, the Argentina Committee withdrew their bid in favor of Havana, understanding the reasoning of the Cuban community."

        "text": "Walter Loreo McCoy (February 20, 1920 – November 10, 2015) was an American Negro league baseball and Minor League Baseball pitcher. Listed at 5' 11\" (1.80 m), 172 lbs (78 kg), he batted and threw right handed.\nBorn in Leavenworth, Kansas, McCoy grew up in San Diego, California where he was a sandlot ball star before\npitching in the Negro leagues in the mid-1940s. In between, he entered military service in 1942 and earned an MVP Award while pitching on the U.S. Army special services team.\nFollowing his discharge in 1945, McCoy played for the Chicago American Giants and Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro leagues in a four-season span from 1945 to 1948. He had decent success before moving to organized baseball in 1949, playing in various Minor League clubs and also in the Mexican League before retiring from baseball in 1955.\nMcCoy spent 1949 with the Visalia Cubs of the California League. Then, in 1950, he became the first black ballplayer to appear in a game for the Sacramento Solons in the AAA Pacific Coast League.\nAfterwards, McCoy played for the Potros de Tijuana of the Southwest International League from 1951 to 1952. He then found himself on the move again, expanding his career in the independent Manitoba-Dakota League with the Winnipeg Giants, Bismarck Barons and Carman Cardinals in all or part of three seasons spanning 1953–1955, ending his playing days with the Tecolotes de Nuevo Laredo of the Mexican League late in 1955.\nIn an eighth-year career, McCoy posted an 8-13 record and a 5.27 earned run average in 28 games (14 starts). He also played winter ball with the Yaquis de Obregón of the Mexican Pacific League in its 1947–1948 season, setting a league pitching record by winning 11 consecutive games. In the same season, he allowed just one hit in a 2–0 shutout over the Venados de Mazatlán on January 8, 1948.\nAfter retiring, McCoy worked as a building contractor for more than 40 years. In his spare time, he coached his grandson's Little League Baseball team, while his daughter served as an assistant coach. From 1996 to 1997, McCoy played on a 30-year and older baseball team with his sons and was chosen for the All-Star team. He continued coaching his grandson through 1999.\nMcCoy gained huge recognition when Major League Baseball held a special draft of the surviving Negro league players before the 2008 MLB Draft. Each Major League club selected a surviving former Negro leagues player, who represented every player who did not have the opportunity to play baseball in the major leagues. The idea of the special draft was conceived by Hall of Famer Dave Winfield, well known for his exceptional community service through the years. As a result, McCoy was drafted as a pitcher by the San Diego Padres.\nMcCoy died from natural causes November 10, 2015, in Lemon Grove, California, at the age of 95.\nExternal links.\n and Seamheads"

He played college basketball for the TCU Horned Frogs.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Fort Worth, Texas to Don Alex Robinson Sr and Darla Biggs Robinson, Alex grew up in nearby Arlington, Texas. He attended Timberview High School, where he became a basketball star for the Wolves – averaging over 23 points per game and earning All-State honors as a senior in 2014.\nCollege career.\nTexas A&amp;M.\nRobinson enrolled at Texas A&amp;M University in College Station, Texas on a basketball scholarship in the summer of 2014.

        "title": "Bids for the 1987 Pan American Games",
        "text": "Two cities initially submitted bids to host the 1987 Pan American Games that were recognized by the Pan American Sports Organization. On July 12, 1981, Santiago was selected over Quito by PASO to host the X Pan American Games after the first round of voting at its general assembly held in Caraballeda, Venezuela. \nFor economic reasons, Santiago was forced to forfeit hosting the games. This made Quito the host of the games, but in 1984, they also stepped out. Subsequently, Havana and Indianapolis presented themselves as candidates to hold the 1987 Games. On December 18, 1984, PASO elected Indianapolis as the host city, giving Indianapolis two and a half years to prepare for the games.\nFirst host city selection.\nOnly 32 of the 35 Pan American National Olympic Committees participated in voting, as Antigua, Cayman Islands and Guyana did not participate in the voting for reasons that were not explained. Santiago defeated Quito in the first round by a margin of four votes.\nFirst candidate cities.\nSantiago, Chile.\nIn mid-1980, the Chilean Olympic Committee (COCH) requested the support of the President of Chile Augusto Pinochet to nominate Santiago as the venue for the X Pan American Games, which resulted into a letter from Pinochet, dated 10 December 1980, addressed to the President of PASO Mario Vázquez Raña.\nPresident of the COCH Gustavo Benko reported that Chile had a budget of $150 million for the Games; of that amount, $70 million would be dedicated exclusively to sports fields and venues, $44 million to the Pan American Village, and the rest to organizational expenses. As a part of their bid, Santiago noted that the Chilean Department of Housing had already approved the Pan American Village construction in La Florida, which would include over 1,000 apartments, media and communication centers, recreational areas, club houses, medical centers, and training areas.\nQuito, Ecuador.\nMany predictions had Quito as the favorite to host the 1987 Games; even Ecuador believed that they would have 22 votes in their favor.\nSecond host city selection.\nDue to the Chilean Economic Crisis of 1982, Santiago was forced to forfeit hosting the game, making Quito the host of the games, but in 1984, they also stepped out; subsequently, Havana and Indianapolis presented themselves as candidates to hold the 1987 Games. In part due to Indianapolis already having most of the key venues in place, PASO selected them to host the games. Many believed that Cuba would end up boycotting the 1987 Games if they did not win. Considering Cuba was the second-largest presence in the Pan American Games, the United States Olympic Committee and PASO guaranteed to support the Cuban bid to organize the 1991 Games, so long as on Cuba participated in the Indianapolis games.\nIndianapolis, United States.\nOriginally, Indianapolis intended to bid for the 1991 Games, with a view to the 1993 World University Summer Games; however, after Santiago, and then Quito, backed out of hosting the 1987 Games, mayor of Indianapolis Bill Hudnut and former Indiana Supreme Court justice Theodore R. Boehm made a bid for Indianapolis to be the host city at the PASO meeting in Mexico City in November 1984. Indianapolis had recent success in hosting national and international sporting events, with the most recent one being the 1982 National Sports Festival, and was the headquarters of the Amateur Athletic Union. Because of this, the city already had over $136 million worth of first-class sporting venues.\nHavana, Cuba.\nCuba made a formal request to meet with PASO Havana in June 1984 to discuss the candidature of Havana to be the host of the 1987 Pan American Games. On that same day, the Cuban government announced that it would not be participating in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. President Fidel Castro explained to PASO that it was not for security reasons, but rather that it was due to solidarity reasons with the Soviet Union. This news did not bode well with PASO, and the meeting with Cuba was postponed, leading to Indianapolis winning the bid for the 1987 Games.\nMany believed that, due to this, Cuba would not participate in the Indianapolis games. Nevertheless, the dialogue between the main Cuban authorities and those of the Indianapolis Organizing Committee and the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) flourished. Two agreements were made between the parties: Cuba would participate in the 1987 Pan American Games and the PASO and USOC gave guarantees to support the Cuban candidacy to organize the 1991 Pan American Games."

        "title": "Equestrian statue of Henry IV",
        "text": "The equestrian statue of Henry IV is a bronze equestrian statue completed by Pietro Tacca. The statue, which now stands on the bridge Pont Neuf, was indirectly commissioned by Marie de Médicis for her husband, King Henry IV of France. The original commissioned artist, Giambologna, died before its completion, and Pietro Tacca took over the commission. The statue was erected in 1614, torn down in 1792 during the French Revolution, and rebuilt by 1818.\nDescription.\nThe original statue of King Henry IV depicts the king riding his horse, which is placed on top of a central raised pedestal. At each of the four corners of the pedestal is a bronze statue of a chained slave. The pedestal's design was made by Ludovico Cigoli with the help of Pietro Tacca, Pietro Francavilla and Francesco Bordoni in its creation.\nAccording to the drawings of Ludovico Cigoli, a Medici court artist, the slaves were depicted with European features and posed with \"Michaelangelsque contortions\". The four slaves all rest on the bottom ledge of the pedestal and are chained to the harpies behind them on the upper corners of the pedestal. In Ludovico's drawing the slaves are bound with bands around their arms and chained to the harpies' hips. Other details on the pedestal are scenes of battle on the left and presumably the right side of the statue, along with \"seated youths bearing swags\".\nAccording to Victoria Thompson, the king and horse's pose were heavily influenced by the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius and his own equestrian statue.\nCreation.\nCommission.\nMarie de Médicis was the primary person to have wanted the creation of the statue of Henry IV. In 1604 it was most likely her that convinced her uncle, Ferdinando I, to have a miniature of the desired bronze statue commissioned. Due to her concerns on the potentially slow pace of the actual statue's completion (due to Giambologna's age at the time), she wanted to shorten the process. She did so by suggesting a time-saving idea. She suggested to Ferdinando I that since the bronze body and horse of his statue was already made, that it could be used instead of the original idea for the figure. He rejected the idea, but suggested that previous molds for his horse were to be reused instead.\nFerdinando I then visited Giambolongna's workshop to see the work that had been done. On September 17 and November 6 of 1607 he saw the cast of the horse and potentially any other progress that was made. Maria de Medici made her own checks on the workshop during 1606–1608. She used courtiers to keep tabs on the statue's progress. One by the name of Calvaliere Camillo Guidi was used to inform the King and Queen of anything concerning the statue's completion, whether it was a lack of labor or even money.\nDelays.\nIt was the concern for time that made Giambologna have his assistant, Pietro Tacca aid him on the project. Tacca had been the one to cast the bronze of both the horse and body of Henry IV. He had also been the one to have made the head of the statue and the extra embellishments on the front of Henry IV. He even had to take over the project when Giambolongna had died in August 1608. At the time of Giambologna's death, Pietro Tacca was working on a commission for the wedding of the Grand Duchess Cristina. Another instance included bad weather impeding the casting of the horses in bronze near the end of 1608.\nDelays in the transport of the statue from the workshop to Paris occurred as well. Pietro Tacca and Giovan Battista Cresci had to weigh the statue, which took time that Marie de Médicis had not wanted to waste. Afterwards there was a stall after the statue's pieces arrived in Livorno, as no one decided to ship it out for almost a year. Various other delays occurred, such as complications in transportation by ship, like after landing in Savona, where the statue's parts were stranded on the seaport's docks for at least a week.\nCompletion.\nPrior to the statue's completion, Henry IV was assassinated. This then added to the significance of the statue as it had yet to be finished at the time. Even though the official date of the statue's completion is unknown, sources gathered by Kathrine Watson state that Baldinucci took note of its completion in 1611. The statue was then shipped out of the workshop on March 5, 1612 after it had been weighed for transport. The statue of the king and horse were placed on its base on Pont Neuf in 1614.\nDestruction of original.\nDuring the French Revolution, in 1792, the original statue was torn down from its spot on the Pont Neuf. It was around this time that many citizens became distrustful of their king, Louis XVI, due to increasing suspicions of him being a traitor. It was on August 11, 1792 that the citizens tore down the statues of Louis XIII, Louis XIV, and Louis XV. Henry IV's statue was torn down the next day. This delay was due to the \"symbolic 'virtues' \" the statue held to the people of the revolution.\nThe rider and horse were both destroyed, sparing only three pieces of the king, and a part of the horse. The four slaves on the pedestal, along with the four pieces of the king and horse, were saved and now reside in the Louvre.\nRecreation.\nPrior to the French Revolution the people who learned of Henry IV's contributions to the history and wellbeing of France regarded him as the model of a good king. This contributed to the symbolism of the statue and its integration into royal ceremonies. As time went on, the oral stories and memories of the people continued, reinforcing the significance of the statue as it represented the important ideas and values that the people of France held to their future kings, like Louis XVI. When the Revolution began and the suspicions against Louis XVI grew, it clashed with the people's views and wishes of what their king was expected to represent.\nWhen Louis XVIII, Louis XVI's brother, had re-entered Paris, a temporary replacement statue made of plaster-of-paris stood on Pont Neuf. This was made possible by the Minister of the Interior, Jacques-Claude Beugnot. Due to the comparisons of Louis XVIII to Henry IV and many people's desires, plans for the restoration of the statue were underway.\nBronze for the new statue was obtained from a statue of Louis Charles Antoine Desaix, as well as from the statue of Napoleon in \"Place Vendôme\". The new version of the statue, made by François-Frédéric Lemot, was finished by 1818.\nThe statue that can be seen today varies from its previous version. The current statue still retains the iconic pose of Henry IV and his horse, but the main differences are visible on the pedestal. The slaves, harpies, and youths from the previous version were not integrated into the present-day version of the piece."

        "text": "T. Adrian Hill (born in Washington, D.C.) is an American football official in the National Football League (NFL) since the 2010 NFL season, wearing uniform number 29.\nEarly life.\nHill was born in Washington, D.C. and raised mostly in upstate New York. He did not play football in high school because he was undersized. He would play the role of referee when his friends played pickup football.\nHill earned degrees in electrical and software engineering and computer science from the University at Buffalo before moving to the Washington metropolitan area to work as a software engineer for Westinghouse Electric Corporation. To make extra money, he responded to a newspaper ad for football officials and spent the next fourteen years officiating high school football games as a side job. He made $13 per game as a youth football referee.\nOfficiating career.\nHill's first college football officiating experience came in 2004 in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference. He was an official in Conference USA, where he worked at the referee position. In 2007, Hill worked four games in the now-defunct NFL Europe league as a line judge.\nHill was hired by the NFL in 2010 and made his first appearance during a September 12, 2010, game between the Washington Redskins and Dallas Cowboys at FedExField as a line judge. He was promoted to referee with the start of the 2019 NFL season following the retirements of Pete Morelli and Walt Coleman. He worked as a line judge, side judge, and field judge before being promoted to referee, the seventh African-American to receive this honor.\nHill made unwanted headlines during a January 3, 2021, game when he called a roughing-the-passer penalty against Detroit Lions safety Tracy Walker after he sacked Kirk Cousins of the Minnesota Vikings on a 4th and goal play. The sack, which would have given the Lions the ball, appeared to be routine as the Lions players started to celebrate before realizing the penalty flag was against them. Cousins told Walker \"I don't necessarily agree with that call, but I'll take it\" as players on both sides of the field looked befuddled about the call. The Vikings would score a touchdown two plays later and go on to win the game 37–35. Both social media and mainstream media outlets covered the call with headlines such as \"Tracy Walker's phantom personal foul penalty causes uprising on social media\" (Detroit Sports Nation), \"NFL fans could not believe the horrendous, game-changing roughing call from Lions-Vikings\" (USA Today), \"Detroit Lions robbed by one of the worst calls ever in game vs. Minnesota Vikings\" (Detroit Free Press), \"Ridiculous roughing call on Kirk Cousins sack sets up Vikings' game-winning TD\" (Yahoo Sports), \"Lions flagged for roughing passer against Vikings on simple sack, befuddles fans\" (Fox News) and \"Worst Call in NFL History Aids Vikings in 37-35 Win against Lions\" (Sports Illustrated). Though it seemed to be a blown call, Hill explained it as a clear-cut penalty in a post-game interview saying \"By rule, one of the categories for roughing-the-passer is full body weight, where the tackler lands with his full body weight on the quarterback. That's the category this play fell into.\"\n2023 crew.\nSource:\nEngineering career.\nAfter earning his bachelor's degree from Buffalo, Hill earned a Master of Science from Johns Hopkins University.\nIn the 1990s, Hill worked as a NASA contractor at Goddard Space Flight Center for what became Raytheon Technologies. In 2000, he was hired as an aerospace software engineer at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory Space Exploration Sector. He was the flight software lead on \"MESSENGER\" and had important roles on the \"New Horizons\" mission and the Parker Solar Probe. He has served as the flight software lead for the Precision Tracking Space System, has led the development of fault protection systems for the Radiation Belt Storm Probes and has led flight software development for the Hubble Space Telescope. While working for Raytheon, he was a developer for the Submillimeter Wave Astronomy Satellite programs.\nIn 2006, he was named Engineer of the Year by the Baltimore chapter of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.\nHe was the lead author of \"Command and Data Handling Flight Software test framework: A Radiation Belt Storm Probes practice\", a paper presented at the 2013 IEEE Aerospace Conference.\nPersonal life.\n, Hill resided in Bowie, Maryland with his wife, VaLerie. He is the brother of Seattle radio host, Steve \"The Thrill\" Hill of the KISW 99.9 radio show \"The Mens Room\"."

        "title": "Brazil at the 2018 FIFA World Cup",
        "text": "The following article concerns the performance of Brazil at the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\nThey reached the quarter-finals, eventually being knocked out 2–1 by Belgium.\nSquad.\nCoach: Tite\nBrazil's final squad was announced on 14 May 2018.\nGroup stage.\nBrazil vs Switzerland.\nThe two teams had met in eight matches, including one game at the 1950 FIFA World Cup group stage, a 2–2 draw.\nPaulinho's close-range effort forced Yann Sommer into a save. The first goal was scored shortly after when Philippe Coutinho scored from outside the penalty area with a right foot shot. Brazil also came close before the break as Thiago Silva headed inches over the crossbar. Five minutes into the second half, Steven Zuber equalised with a controversial header after a corner from the right decided by VAR review when he appeared to push Miranda in the back. More controversy was caused in the 73rd minute, after Gabriel Jesus was denied a penalty after being hacked down by Manuel Akanji in the penalty area. Brazil came close several times during the closing minutes, but Neymar, Roberto Firmino, and Miranda were unable to garner goals.\nBrazil have failed to win any of their last three World Cup matches (D1 L2), their worst winless run since June 1978, when they went four games without a win. Valon Behrami is the first Switzerland player in history to appear at four World Cups. Brazil failed to win their opening match at the World Cup for the first time since 1978, when they drew 1–1 with Sweden.\nBrazil vs Costa Rica.\nThe two teams had met in ten matches, including two games at the FIFA World Cup's group stages, in 1990 and 2002, with both ending in a victory for Brazil's (1–0 and 5–2, respectively).\nCelso Borges shot an effort wide of the target from a Cristian Gamboa cutback after 13 minutes. Gabriel Jesus shot into the back of the net from an offside position in the 25th minute. Marcelo shot a low drive five minutes from the break, which Keylor Navas stopped. After the break, Jesus headed against the crossbar before Navas diverted Philippe Coutinho's follow-up wide. Neymar curled around the right-hand post from 18 yards in the 72nd minute, before the officials arrived at the correct decision via VAR to deny him a penalty. Coutinho gave Brazil the lead in the 91st minute, when he burst into the box to get on the end of a Roberto Firmino nod down and a touch from Jesus before poking the ball low to the net. Neymar then tapped home Douglas Costa's chipped cross from the right from close range deeper into the stoppage time.\nNeymar's strike seven minutes into stoppage time was the latest ever at a World Cup in regular time. This was Brazil's first World Cup victory thanks to a goal scored in the 90th minute. Costa Rica were knocked out of the tournament after this game for the first time since 2006, with a game to play.\nSerbia vs Brazil.\nThe two teams had met once, a 2014 friendly won by Brazil 1–0. Playing as Yugoslavia, the two teams met 18 times, including four times at FIFA World Cup's group stages in 1930, 1950, 1954 and 1974, with one victory each and two draws.\nMarcelo was replaced with Filipe Luís in the 10th minute, due to a back spasm. Gabriel Jesus created a chance for Neymar, whose cross-goal strike was pushed away by Vladimir Stojković. Jesus cut inside of Miloš Veljković and saw his shot blocked behind by Nikola Milenković. In the 36th minute, Paulinho raced between two defenders and poked Philippe Coutinho's delivery beyond the onrushing Stojković. Neymar had a low drive kept out by Stojković at the near post five minutes into the second period. Aleksandar Mitrović headed a cross from Antonio Rukavina straight at the feet of the keeper in the 65th minute. Thiago Silva headed home at the near post from Neymar's left-wing corner in the 68th minute.\nBrazil have qualified from the group stage of the World Cup for the 13th consecutive tournament, a run stretching back to 1970. Brazil have now won back-to-back World Cup matches for the first time since 2010, when they won their opening two group matches. For Serbia, this was the second consecutive elimination from the group stage in their World Cup history as an independent nation.\nKnock-out stage.\nBrazil vs Mexico.\nThe teams had met in 40 previous matches including two games at CONCACAF Gold Cup finals (1996 and 2003, both won by Mexico), the 1999 FIFA Confederations Cup Final (won 4–3 by Mexico), and four times in the FIFA World Cup group stage, three won by Brazil and one ending in a draw (4–0 in 1950, 5–0 in 1954, 2–0 in 1962 and 0–0 in 2014).\nHirving Lozano's half-volley was well blocked by Miranda, while at the other end, Guillermo Ochoa saved Neymar's drive from just outside the penalty area. After 25 minutes, Neymar raced past Edson Álvarez in the area and forced Ochoa into a save with his left hand. Gabriel Jesus went close in the 33rd minute, finding space in a crowded area and drilling in a left-footed strike that Ochoa palmed away. In the 51st minute, Neymar's back-heel on the edge of the area teed up Willian for a burst into the box and his scuffed cross from the left was slid into an empty net by Neymar from close range. With two minutes remaining, Neymar powered through on the left and his low effort was diverted by Ochoa's foot into the path of Roberto Firmino, who tapped the ball into an empty net from close range.\nSince the introduction of the round of 16 in 1986, Mexico have been eliminated at this stage of the World Cup seven times – more than twice as many as any other nation. This was also Mexico's fourth defeat on the hand of Brazil, and moreover, Mexico had never scored a single goal against Brazil in the FIFA World Cup.\nBrazil vs Belgium.\nThe teams had met in four previous matches. Their most recent meeting came in a World Cup knockout stage match in 2002, Brazil winning 2–0 to advance to the quarter-finals. That match was also the only time the two sides had previously met in a World Cup.\nBelgium scored from their first corner of the game in the 13th minute, Vincent Kompany flicked on Eden Hazard's left-wing delivery but the decisive touch came from Fernandinho, who turned the ball past Alisson via his arm. Belgium doubled their lead by breaking from a Brazil corner in the 31st minute, Kevin De Bruyne arrowed a right foot drive across Alisson and into the left corner of the net from the edge of the penalty area after Romelu Lukaku collected the ball, turned and embarked on a 40-yard run with a pass at the end to free De Bruyne. Brazil's third change yielded a goal three minutes and 14 seconds after his introduction, Renato Augusto gliding between two Belgium defenders to nod a flicked header past Thibaut Courtois from a Philippe Coutinho cross. Coutinho's first-time shot flew wide and yet another Neymar penalty appeal was rejected, before he drew a fingertip save from Courtois in the 94th minute.\nDe Bruyne became the 100th player to score at Russia 2018 (excluding own goals). Belgium have reached the World Cup semi-finals for only the second time, losing out to eventual winners Argentina in 1986. Belgium's victory was only their second ever against Brazil, and first since a 1963 friendly match in Brussels. This was the first time in 30 matches in all competitions that Brazil had conceded more than once in a game, since a 2–2 draw with Paraguay in March 2016."

        "title": "Baseball Rule",
        "text": "In American tort law, the Baseball Rule is an exculpatory clause applicable to baseball games with spectators; it holds that a baseball team or its sponsoring organization cannot be held liable for injuries suffered by a spectator struck by a foul ball batted into the stands, under most circumstances, as long as the team has offered some protected seating in the areas where foul balls are most likely to cause injuries. This is considered within the standard of reasonable care that teams owe to spectators, although in recent decades it has more often been characterized as a limited- or no-duty rule, and applied to ice hockey and golf as well. It is largely a matter of case law in state courts, although four states have codified it.\nThe rule arose from a pair of 1910s decisions by the Missouri Court of Appeals, both considering suits filed by spectators at home games of the minor league Kansas City Blues. In the first, considered to be the case that established the rule, the court upheld a trial verdict against the plaintiff, holding that his decision to sit outside the netting the team had installed behind home plate constituted contributory negligence and assumption of risk on his part. Conversely, in the second, decided a year later, the court upheld a verdict \"for\" a plaintiff who had been struck in the eye by a foul ball that passed through a hole in the netting between him and home plate. Other state courts accepted those cases as precedent and used them to decide similar cases.\nBy the 1930s it was interpreted as requiring teams to erect protective screening over the stands behind home plate, a practice that had already become common in the late 19th century due to injuries from foul balls, which rose after an 1884 rule change allowed overhand pitching. Courts have seen it as balancing the team's duty of care toward spectators with the spectators' interest in having an unobstructed view of the game available and perhaps being able to take home a recovered foul ball as a souvenir. It has been held to apply in some other situations besides foul balls—when a player deliberately threw the ball into the stands as a souvenir, for instance—but not in others, such as errant pitches from a relief pitcher warming up in the bullpen, situations where multiple balls are in play (such as (formerly) batting practice), where struck spectators are not in the seating areas of the venue or where they may have been distracted by the team's mascot.\nIn the wake of some serious injuries caused by foul balls in Major League Baseball (MLB) parks in the 2010s, including the first foul-ball spectator death at an MLB game in almost 50 years, there have been calls for the rule to be re-examined or abolished altogether, as more spectators are struck by a foul ball than players in the game are hit by a pitch. While MLB has required all of its teams to extend their protective screens to cover the area to the far end of the dugout on either side of the field, critics note that it is no longer possible for spectators to choose to sit under those screens given that all seats in the venue are reserved for those who buy them, many for the entire season. Further, they say, balls are hit harder and spectators, who on average now sit closer to the field than they did in 1913, have more distractions. Two states' supreme courts have declined to adopt the rule, which has been criticized as a relic of the era before the adoption of comparative negligence; a widely read \"William and Mary Law Review\" article further argues that the Baseball Rule fails the law and economics standards of optimally allocated tort liability.\nHistory.\nDevelopment of modern game.\nProfessional baseball in the United States began in 1869. In those early years, there was little risk of injury from a ball hit into the stands. While seats were located as close as a few feet (1–2 m) from the foul lines, putting fans at risk of being hit by overthrown balls or lost bats, there was less risk from batted balls. At the time, the rules required pitchers to not only deliver the ball underhand, but with their arms barely bent and from below the waist. In addition, batters could and did request the ball be pitched to a specific position over the plate.\nAs a result, most games were dominated by offense, with fielding providing most defense, and games often ended with very high scores by modern standards. One or sometimes both teams exceeding 100 runs in a game was not unusual. Pitchers, some of whom had learned to throw the ball very fast even underhand, began to influence the game and drive down scores with the help of gradual rule changes that allowed the ball to be delivered from higher up, with the arm more cocked, making the first curveballs possible. Injuries in the stands from foul balls in the late 1870s earned the area behind home plate the nickname of \"the slaughter pit\"; the National League's Providence Grays became the first team to erect a protective screen over that section of their park in 1879.\nIn 1884 the evolution to modern pitching was completed when overhand pitching was allowed. Consequently it became much harder for hitters to direct the ball into fair territory when they connected with it. More teams began erecting backstops, as they came to be called, similar to those the Grays had put up, but they were not always popular with fans. The Milwaukee Northwestern League team removed theirs after two weeks of fan complaints that they unduly obstructed their view of play.\n19th-century tort law.\nFatalities from foul balls occurred in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; many of those struck and killed were children watching or otherwise in proximity to amateur games. In one unusual 1902 incident, a 20-year-old Ohio man watching a game was stabbed through the heart when a friend who was lending him a knife was struck by a foul ball as he did; after telling his friends he was not badly hurt, he began bleeding uncontrollably and died a few minutes later. The \"Washington Star\" reported in 1888 that a man claiming to have been hit by a ball (whether batted or thrown was not clear) at a Washington Statesmen game the year before had filed suit; if he had, it did not result in a published opinion.\nMedia reports from the era suggest that there were other lawsuits besides the 1888 Washington lawsuit against baseball teams over foul ball injuries around the turn of the century, but none were reported. They may have been disposed through settlement, trial or withdrawal. It has also been suggested that the law concerning torts brought by public invitees such as spectators at a baseball game was not seen as favorable to such suits.\nUp to the time of baseball's origins in the United States, common law treated those on private property not generally open to the public, like sporting venues, but on the property with the owner's permission, as licensees. The property owner owed them no other duty of care than to protect them from unforeseeable hazards incident to the conditions of the property. That standard would have likely precluded any suit over injuries from a foul ball as they were a foreseeable risk.\nHowever, in 1866 an English court's decision, \"Indermaur v. Dames\", held that a landowner was indeed liable for damages from personally known hazards or hazards the landowner reasonably could have been expected to. Since the plaintiff was there for business reasons, to inspect a faulty gas regulator, when he fell through the defendant's floor and suffered injury, the Court of Common Pleas held he was not a licensee but a visitor or invitee, there to transact business mutually beneficial to both parties, a distinction recent cases had begun to recognize but not formalize. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court accepted \"Indermaur\" as precedent two years later in a similar case of a ship damaged by a submerged rock, and it would eventually be so recognized by the courts of 26 states and the U.S. Supreme Court.\nIn 1883 the Massachusetts Supreme Court held that a patron of a place of public amusement was an invitee, and that the defendant, a dance hall, had a duty to maintain the premises safely. Legal scholar Seymour Thompson wrote in a popular work on tort law that the duties of business owners towards invitees, or business visitors as they were now known, applied with \"special force to ... establishments to which the public are invited in large numbers.\" As the 20th century dawned, courts had applied that principle to a wide variety of such businesses, including sports venues.\nHowever, despite a more favorable legal climate, there were no reported cases over foul ball injuries. Marquette law professor J.G. Hylton, in a history of the origins of the Baseball Rule, notes that the visitor principle had primarily decided cases where the issues with the property had existed prior to the plaintiff's entry on to it and thus a plaintiff could claim both that the defendant knew of the defect and he himself did not, whereas most spectators at a baseball game would have known that foul balls frequently entered the stands at high speed. There had not been many cases where the plaintiffs' knowledge of the possible risks was a factor.\nAlso, at the time, American courts recognized assumption of risk and contributory negligence, when proven, as absolute bars to any recovery by a plaintiff. \"If [they] knew of the dangers of foul balls and chose to sit in an unprotected seat,\" Hylton writes, \"then he or she opened himself up to the charge that his or her own negligence ... had contributed to his or her injury.\" He also speculates that the dominant cultural ethos of rugged individualism during the Gilded Age and early Progressive Era may have led injured spectators to fault themselves, and only themselves, for their injury.\nThe earliest reported lawsuit over injuries from a batted baseball was filed during the first decade of the 20th century. A man watching a horse race at an Iowa agricultural fair was hit by a foul ball from a baseball game being played on the track's infield. He sued the directors of the fair; in 1907 the state's Supreme Court held that the directors were not liable since their organization's purpose was to promote agriculture and the baseball game was not part of that, thus they could not be expected to have knowledge of the risks it posed and there was no nonfeasance.\nThe following year, Michigan's Supreme Court took judicial notice, in a case brought by a patron injured by a foul ball from a nearby game while dancing at a resort, of the inherent risks of watching a baseball game and that every spectator assumed them by choosing to watch:\nEstablishment of the Baseball Rule.\n\"Crane v. Kansas City Baseball &amp; Exhibition Co.\".\nIn 1913, an appellate court for the first time heard a case against a baseball team arising from a foul ball injury incurred by a paying spectator at the game. Three years earlier, Samuel Crane had gone to a home game of the Kansas City Blues, an American Association class AA minor league team, at Association Park in Kansas City, Missouri. At the ticket counter, he had the choice of a seat in the bleachers, beyond the outfield fence, for 25¢ ($ in today's dollars) or in the grandstand, next to the infield, for twice that price. In either area, all seats were general admission; Crane could sit wherever he wanted if a space was available.\nBy that time protective screens had been installed in every baseball park where the game was played professionally. At minimum they covered the area immediately behind home plate; the screen at Association Park extended as far as first and third base on either foul line, roughly from home. Crane decided to sit in an area beyond the screen, and at some point during the game was struck by a foul ball and injured; the details are not known.\nCrane later filed suit in Jackson County Circuit Court, arguing that the Blues had been negligent and seeking $100 in damages ($ in today's dollars) plus court costs; their duty of reasonable care to him required that they screen off \"all\" the grandstand seats. He and the team stipulated to the facts of the case and agreed to try it as a question of law. The trial court held for the team; Crane appealed.\nThe Kansas City Division of the Missouri Court of Appeals affirmed the judgement. Citing the Michigan Supreme Court's 1908 \"dictum\", it held that Crane had assumed the risks of watching a baseball game when he chose to attend. Since given a choice between protected and unprotected seats, Crane chose the latter (for the unobstructed view, the court speculated), there was contributory negligence on his part and the team was not liable. \"One invited to a place who is offered a choice of two positions one of which is less safe than the other cannot be said to be in the exercise of reasonable care if, with full knowledge of the risks and dangers, he chooses the more dangerous place\", wrote Judge W.O. Jackson. \"That is a fundamental rule of the law of negligence.\"\nAlmost a century later, Hylton observed that despite Crane's failure to win his case, the court's decision did impose two requirements on teams. While they avoided a requirement they screen off all seats and end the practice of offering standing room only attendance behind the outfield fence to latecomers at sold-out games, both of which would have likely reduced attendance, the court did hold that teams owed a duty of reasonable care to fans, which specifically meant that they should offer at least some protected seating. \"This responsibility could not be shirked,\" Hylton wrote, \"and it did not matter either if the patron knew of the danger before attending or was informed of it upon entering the park.\"\n\"Edling v. Kansas City Baseball &amp; Exhibition Co.\".\nWithin a year another case of a fan injured by a foul ball at a Blues game came before the same court, allowing it to apply and clarify the rule. The circumstances of this case were markedly different, and the court found for the plaintiff, one Edling.\nIn 1911, Charles Edling, like Crane, went to a Blues home game. He, too, paid the higher price for a grandstand seat, but unlike Crane chose to sit behind the netting, halfway up the stands from the field level, on almost a line with home plate and the pitcher's mound so he could see pitches curve. During the game, Edling lost sight of one of the many foul balls until it struck him in the eye, having passed through a square-foot () hole in the netting. The injuries were serious, including a broken nose as well as the eye damage, and Edling filed suit, demanding $3,500 ($ in today's dollars) plus court costs.\nSince there was a factual dispute as to the condition of the screen—the team claimed it was new and in perfect condition, while fans who had attended other games testified that it had had many holes which had gone unrepaired for a long time—the case was heard by a jury. The team mounted two other defenses: that even in perfect condition a screen unobtrusive enough to not detract from spectators' enjoyment of the game could not also be strong enough to stop \"all\" foul balls, and that Edling had also been contributorily negligent by failing to keep track of the ball that had hit him after it had been hit (to that, Edling's lawyer responded that if the Blues' players had kept their eyes on the ball as well as the team's lawyers said Edling should have, the team would have had a much better season).\nThe jury found for Edling and the Blues appealed. In response to the team's claim that the jury should not have heard the testimony about the condition of the screen, the appeals court relied on \"Crane\" to hold that by purposely sitting behind the screen, Edling could reasonably assume he was safe from foul balls. \"It was the duty of defendant to keep the screen free from defects, and if it [did not], the jury could properly infer that it ... was guilty of negligence.\"\n\"We must also ignore the suggestion that [screening capable of blocking all foul balls would be too hard to see through]\", the court said. Evidence at trial, it explained, had shown that a mesh of chicken wire similar to that used at Association Park could stop any batted ball with minimal impact on spectators' view, when properly maintained. Citing Edling's attorney's comment, the court also agreed it was not Edling's responsibility to avoid injury by keeping track of the ball at all times. \"The uncertainty in the direction, speed and force of a batted ball is one of the interesting and exciting features of the game,\" the court observed, \"and frequently it is difficult for even a trained eye to follow the course of the ball.\"\nHylton reads \"Edling\" as contractualizing the relationship between team and spectator in the area of foul ball risk and protection. By screening off some of the seats, a team implicitly guaranteed to the spectators who chose to sit behind the screen that it would be in sufficient condition to protect them from foul ball injuries, unless (as the team claimed Edling had) they knowingly remained in front of a defective portion. \"While not obligated to screen every seat in the park\", he comments, \"the team was obligated not only to provide protected seats for fans who desired them but also to maintain those seats in a reasonable manner.\"\nPrecedence and evolution.\n\"Crane\" became precedent outside Missouri before \"Edling\" was even heard there. Later in 1913, the Minnesota Supreme Court considered a case, like Crane's, brought by a spectator who had chosen to sit in an unprotected area of the stands and been injured by a foul ball. The plaintiff, a woman who was attending a baseball game for the first time ever on Ladies' Day, had won in the lower courts, but the state's highest court overturned the verdict, citing the case's similarities to \"Crane\" and quoting from that opinion extensively. Unlike Crane, the plaintiff argued that she had had no familiarity with the game and thus should at least have been warned about the possibility of injury from a foul ball, but the court did not distinguish her case from Crane's on that basis.\nWashington's Supreme Court relied on \"Crane\" in 1919 to reverse an earlier case in which it had allowed an injured spectator to proceed with his suit. The circumstances were similar—the plaintiff had chosen to sit in unprotected seating where protected seats had been available—but the plaintiff in \"Kavafian v. Seattle Baseball Club Association\" had initially argued that the team's negligence lay in having changed its mind about where to put screening, as Kavafian's seat was located in an area of the stadium originally intended to have it. Per \"Crane\", the court again found that as long as the team had made some protected seats available a spectator who chose not to sit there assumed all the risk.\nIn 1929 the Supreme Court in neighboring Oregon was confronted with a first-impression variation on the foul-ball injury. A man who had attended a game in Portland four years earlier and sat near the edge of a screen was nevertheless struck and permanently injured by a foul ball that curved behind it. At trial he had prevailed and been awarded $3,000 ($ in today's dollars), which was upheld on appeal. However, the state Supreme Court held that such an unusual trajectory for a foul ball was so unforeseeable that the team could not reasonably be expected to protect spectators from a ball so hit and vacated the award.\nJoan Quinn, a San Francisco teenager who attended a 1929 game of the Pacific Coast League's Seals at Recreation Park, asked to be seated behind the screen but was told by the usher that none were available at that time, so she sat in an unprotected seat expecting the usher would find a protected one. A foul ball hit by Gus Suhr struck and injured her. She sued not only the club but Suhr, the first reported instance in which a plaintiff named a batter as a defendant in addition to the team in a foul ball tort, arguing that since she had requested a protected seat she had not voluntarily assumed the risk of the injury that befell her.\nAt trial the judge granted the team's motion for a directed verdict in their favor after Quinn presented her case. On appeal the court took note that while protected seats were available elsewhere in the grandstand, she had nonetheless insisted on sitting near first base, and upheld the ruling, saying that she had temporarily assumed the risk. The California Supreme Court agreed and saw fit to reprint the entire appellate opinion.\nA 1930 incident concerned a ball hit fairly, though not during the actual game. The plaintiff went to a game in New Orleans and bought a ticket to the bleachers, from home plate and protected by a five-foot-high () screen at field level. While walking to his seat before the game, he was hit by a ball from batting practice, to which he had not paid attention, and his jaw was broken. The following year the Louisiana Supreme Court upheld a judgement for the team, finding the case fundamentally similar to \"Crane\", with the plaintiff's inattention to the game similarly constituting contributory negligence and the team having satisfied its duty as the grandstand was already properly screened.\n\"Grimes v. American League Baseball Club\".\nIn one unusual case, also from Missouri, a court did hold that a plaintiff sitting in unprotected seating could recover. On the last day of the St. Louis Browns' 1931 season at Sportsman's Park, Violet Grimes attended, with a date, and chose to sit near third base at field level, well outside the area screened behind home plate. To accommodate extra crowds expected for that year's World Series, in which the Cardinals, who shared the park with the Browns, were hosting the first two games against the Philadelphia Athletics starting the next day, temporary wooden seats had been built and added, extending into the field. In the second game of a doubleheader with the Chicago White Sox a foul ball ricocheted off the railing on the temporary seating and into Grimes' eye.\nGrimes prevailed at trial and was awarded $5,000 by the jury ($ in today's dollars). The Browns appealed; the court upheld the verdict, noting that the distance between the foul lines and the stands existed for a reason and that the temporary seating (closed to spectators that day) distinguished the case from \"Crane\" and the others like it in that it was not an ordinary part of games at the park. \"[P]laintiff was subjected,\" the court wrote, \"not only to the usual and ordinary perils of the game when played under its usual and ordinary conditions ... but also to an unusual and extraordinary hazard which had concededly been put in the park to meet unusual conditions and which was not even designed or intended to serve a purpose at the game plaintiff was attending.\"\n\"Brisson v. Minneapolis Baseball &amp; Athletic Association\".\nOverall, in the two decades after \"Crane\" courts in six more states would rely on it as precedent and reaffirm that reliance; by the 1930s it was seen as a seminal case in the area of landowner liability, specifically the liability of sporting venue operators. The most significant of those cases came from the latter line when the Minnesota Supreme Court heard \"Brisson v. Minneapolis Baseball &amp; Athletic Association\" in 1932. It settled two questions \"Crane\" and the courts that relied on it had not.\nBrisson alleged that he had intended to sit in the protected area, but found all the seats there filled. So he sat instead in an unprotected seat, where like the other plaintiffs he was hit by a foul ball and injured. He argued that \"Crane\" required the team to ensure that protected seats were available for any spectator who wanted one; thus, the lack of availability of such seats negated any assumption of risk on his part.\nA verdict in the plaintiff's favor, too, was appealed again to the state's highest court and overturned, as the justices believed that reasonable care did not require making unprotected seats available for \"anyone\" who wanted them. What it \"did\" require was that teams make a reasonable amount of such seats available as to satisfy the typical demand for them, \"and\" that the \"most dangerous\" area of the stands be so screened. While the Minnesota Supreme Court did not specify any part of the stands at a baseball game, later courts more explicitly stated this to be the seats behind home plate, which had already been screened at most baseball parks since the 1880s.\nMid-20th century evolution.\nIn 1942, when deciding \"Hudson v. Kansas City Baseball Club\", which held that a plaintiff asserting that he had believed that a reserved seat he bought a ticket for was protected was not sufficiently different from other cases as to warrant an exception to the rule, the Missouri Supreme Court noted that \"Crane\" and \"Edling\" \"have become leading cases throughout the country\" in torts related to foul ball injuries.\nThe following year a spectator struck in the abdomen by a foul at a 1941 Columbus Red Birds game, one of the earliest to be played at night, argued that the team should have provided sufficient illumination for those in unprotected seating, as he was that night, to be able to see the ball should it come into the stands, appealed the directed verdict for the team. The Ohio Court of Appeals divided, with two of the three judges declining to distinguish night games. \"If the risk was greater due to the fact that it was a night game played under artificial lights, by the same token the plaintiff was under greater obligation to protect himself by seeking a position of safety behind screens.\" The dissenting judge argued that that was a factual question a jury should have been allowed to decide, saying \"it would be a dangerous policy for the law to pronounce a principle of immunity to ball clubs against ordinary care as related to the construction of its stands or the location or the placing of equipment which has to do with the safety of its patrons.\"\nAn appeals court in neighboring Indiana later that year also declined to distinguish an injury resulting from a fellow spectator's attempt to throw the foul back on the field, holding that that too was part of the game. \"The danger of a ball thrown by a spectator toward the playing field while play is in session seems to us to be an ordinary hazard of the game\" wrote the court in \"Emhardt v. Perry Stadium\", noting also that the plaintiff had testified she and her husband had regularly attended games at the park for four years prior to the 1937 incident. It affirmed summary judgement for the defendant team and park.\nSince \"Brisson\" had specified the terms under which teams needed to provide screening, plaintiffs seeking to recover began basing their challenges on their lack of knowledge of the risks. These cases generally involved women who had accompanied their husbands or sons to the ballpark. The first such case had been decided the year before, when a Texas appeals court heard \"Keys v. Alamo City Baseball Co.\". Keys had taken her son to a Texas League game in San Antonio, where they both sat in unprotected seats far from the backstop. During the fifth or sixth inning, she was struck in the chest by a foul ball her son had ducked while she had been talking to a friend seated several rows behind her.\nTo overcome the team's assumption of risk defense, she argued that she was not that familiar with the game, having only attended one other baseball contest several years earlier. While it found the team partially negligent in that the usher who had directed her and her son to the seats did not warn them there was no protection there from foul balls, the court disagreed with claim of ignorance of the hazard, noting that the record showed that her son, aged 14, had gone to other games at the park and often played or threw baseballs in and around the home, suggesting \"he was a baseball 'fan', as is nearly every normal American boy.\" Even if Keys had not taken note of this, the court added, she had been at the game for long enough to see, as her son had pointed out to her, that quite a few foul balls go into the stands.\nIn yet another case from Kansas City, brought by a woman who moved with her son to unprotected seats at a 1947 game on the usher's apparent assurance that they were safe only to be hospitalized after the ensuing injury, the Missouri Supreme Court called the dangers of being struck by a foul ball \"open and obvious to any one who possesses normal powers of observation. A knowledge of the rules or strategy of the game is not necessary to a realization of such hazard.\"\n\"Schentzel v. Philadelphia National League Club\".\nA Pennsylvania Superior Court panel echoed \"Keys\" in 1953's \"Schentzel v. Philadelphia National League Club\" when it overturned a jury verdict in favor of a woman who had gone with her husband to see a Philadelphia Phillies doubleheader at Shibe Park in 1949. The couple had driven to Philadelphia from Allentown and arrived late, at the start of the first game's seventh inning. They had been assured by the ticket seller that their seats, in the upper deck, were behind the screen. When they found out that they were not, rather somewhat displaced towards first base, they resolved to see if they could exchange their tickets for a pair to seats that were, but due to crowds in the aisle, they chose to wait until that trip could be made more easily. Roughly two minutes afterwards, 10 minutes after they arrived, the woman was injured by a foul ball.\nSchentzel made the novel argument that teams should install extra screening on Ladies' Days, such as the one she had attended, since many women were admitted for free and it could not be expected that most of them would be familiar with the game. But as in the Texas case, the Pennsylvania court did not find it plausible at that time that the plaintiff could be ignorant of the fact that foul balls went into the stands, her testimony that the game was the first she had ever attended and the minimal amount of time she and her husband had been at the game notwithstanding. Starting from the premise that she was a middle-aged woman of normal intelligence, the court reiterated the holding of \"Keys\" in this regard:\nFirst major league foul ball death.\nIn 1970, for the first time, a spectator died of injuries from a foul ball at a major league game. Alan Fish, 14, went to the Los Angeles Dodgers May 16 home game at Dodger Stadium against the San Francisco Giants with other boys from his recreational program and the program director, where they sat in the second row at field level along the first base line. A Manny Mota foul hit Fish on the back of the head, above his ear, in the bottom of the third.\nFish initially lost consciousness, but regained it after a minute and appeared to have recovered completely by the end of the game. However, on his ride home he began experiencing dizziness, and by the time he returned his parents took him to three hospitals in order to find one that would treat him. His condition deteriorated and surgery could not be done; Fish died after being taken off life support three days later.\nThe Fishes brought suit against the Dodgers, the medical facilities and the first physician to see their son, asking $1 million in damages. They alleged the team had been negligent in designing and operating the stadium, and along with the other defendants had been negligent in treating Alan. The trial judge disallowed the first count against the Dodgers, and before trial the Fishes dropped suit against the medical facilities. When it finally came to trial in 1973, the jury initially deadlocked, but after the judge pressured them to keep deliberating, they found for the defendants. Three years later an appeals court reversed the trial court on the grounds of a jury instruction that should have been given but was not.\n1970s-80s: Comparative negligence.\nWith plaintiffs now effectively denied the opportunity to recover based on their own level of knowledge of the game, lawyers began adding the claim that teams were negligent in failing to warn spectators about the dangers of foul balls. Many states had reformed their tort laws, with courts and/or legislatures embracing the newer doctrine of comparative negligence, assumption of risk and contributory negligence, the pillars of the Baseball Rule in \"Crane\", were no longer absolute defenses and a plaintiff whose own negligence had contributed to their injury could still recover, albeit less than what they had demanded, as long as they were found to be less than 50 percent at fault.\nThese cases left the Baseball Rule intact; courts in California, New York and Texas wrote influential rulings declining to revisit it, although not without some skepticism, and an outright dissent in New York. These favorable verdicts notwithstanding, teams \"did\" begin to take some steps to warn fans of the danger from foul balls. Waivers were printed on the back of tickets, and teams began having announcements read over the park's public address system reminding fans to stay alert at \"any\" time balls were in use on the field, not just during play.\nIn declining to revisit the Baseball Rule without contributory negligence and assumption of risk as absolute defenses to suits over foul ball injuries, courts revised the duty of care owed by teams to spectators. \"Crane\" had stated that it arose out of reasonable care, but the decisions of the 1980s held that a team owed either a limited duty or no duty at all to spectators beyond that established by the Baseball Rule.\n\"Akins v. Glens Falls City School District\".\nIn 1981's \"Akins v. Glens Falls City School District\", the New York Court of Appeals, the highest court of a state that had been one of the first to adopt comparative negligence, heard the first case challenging the Baseball Rule under that doctrine.\nFive years earlier, Akins had attended one of her son's high school baseball games. Arriving after it had started, she chose to watch, standing since there were no seating facilities available, behind a three-foot-high (1 m) chainlink fence that ran from the backstop along the third base line, approximately from the plate. Within 10 minutes, a foul ball hit her in the eye, causing permanent injury.\nAt trial, she asked $250,000 ($ in today's dollars) alleging the school district could have put wings equal in height to the backstop's to both bases at minimal cost; the jury found the school district liable and awarded her $100,000, finding her only 35 percent liable for her injury. A five-judge panel of the state's Appellate Division divided narrowly in upholding her appeal, with the dissenting justices arguing that Akins had not proved the school district negligent, and the case went to the Court of Appeals. The judges there also divided narrowly, reversing the appeals court.\nJudge Matthew J. Jasen's majority opinion held that the standard set by \"Brisson\" almost half a century earlier—screening behind the plate at least and protected seating available for the number of spectators who could reasonably be expected to want it—still applied. Since that had been provided, the school district had met the duty of reasonable care (which was now required of New York landowners regardless of the category of visitor) and was not liable; Jasen did not think the court needed, given that holding, to reconsider the Baseball Rule under comparative negligence.\nThe court's chief judge, Lawrence H. Cooke, wrote the dissent. He and his two colleagues accused the majority of usurping the jury's task. \"This attempt to precisely prescribe what steps the proprietor of a baseball field must take to fulfill its duty of reasonable care is unwarranted and unwise ... [it] has in effect undertaken the task of prescribing the size, shape and location of backstops and other protective devices.\" Cooke noted that the jury in the case had heard testimony that it was relatively inexpensive to add those wings to the backstop and that they were common in the area, that school district officials knew that fouls went over the fence but posted no signs warning of them, and that the batter who had hit the foul in a varsity high school contest was a powerful enough hitter to have made it to the major leagues by the time the Court of Appeals heard the case. Lastly he charged that the majority had, by refusing to consider comparative negligence in this case, effectively negated it as a concept.\n\"Rudnick v. Golden West Broadcasters\".\nThree years later, an appeals court in another comparative negligence state, California, considered a foul ball case in that light. Loretta Rudnick, after being struck and injured by a foul ball at a California Angels game, brought suit against the team. While she had been sitting in an unprotected area of Anaheim Stadium near first base, she argued that that was no longer a valid defense for the team, since under comparative negligence her stated lack of familiarity with baseball and consequent assumption that all seats were safe made her responsibility a triable issue of fact. After presenting her case, the trial court had granted the Angels' motion for summary judgement.\nThe appeals court reversed, but only because it felt the Angels' motion had not met the standard for summary judgement. In asserting that 2,300 protected seats were available, the motion neglected in the court's opinion to note that that number was but a tenth of the crowd the team typically drew, nor did it make any effort to show how that was a reasonable amount to have available, especially when most of those seats were reserved for season ticket holders. The rest of its opinion went on to reassert the validity of the Baseball Rule, as recognized by the state's Supreme Court in \"Quinn\" a half-century earlier, in the comparative negligence environment, allowing in the process that \"[t]he law has traditionally treated the national pastime in a \"sui generis\" manner\" For spectators, it concluded, \"the chance to apprehend a misdirected baseball is as much a part of the game as the seventh inning stretch or peanuts and Cracker Jack.\"\nA concurring justice agreed that the Angels had not satisfied the requirement of demonstrating that no issue of fact existed, but took issue with the majority's reaffirmation of the Baseball Rule. \"They find, quite remarkably, that \"Quinn\" ... is still a beacon of enlightened tort law.\" He cited the many changes made to baseball since 1935 as parallel to changes in tort law. Baseball had indeed gotten \"sui generis\" treatment from the law, he agreed, but \"there is absolutely no support to suggest it is above the law and insulated from the duty and liabilities imposed on others. Say it ain't so, Joe!\"\n\"Friedman v. Houston Sports Association\".\nThree years after \"Rudnick\", a Texas appeals court likewise rejected the notion that the move to comparative negligence required reassessing the Baseball Rule. After an 11-year-old girl had been struck in the face by a foul while sitting near first base at a 1978 Houston Astros game, she and her father were awarded $180,000 in actual and punitive damages, which the judge then set aside on a defense motion. In affirming, the appeals court first reiterated the holding from \"Keys\" that it would be \"absurd, and no doubt ... resented by many patrons\" to expect a baseball team to individually warn everyone entering the park of the dangers from foul balls leaving the field of play. It then rejected the argument that the state's recent move to comparative negligence required it to reconsider the Baseball Rule, noting that neither New York nor California had, either. \"Comparative negligence does not create a duty,\" it wrote.\nLike \"Akins\" and \"Rudnick\", the decision came with some skepticism. A concurring justice noted that while he agreed with the decision since Friedman had been accompanied by her father, he was troubled by the court's willingness to discard the jury's findings that her father had not himself been negligent. He speculated that there would be situations in which a duty to warn could be found, perhaps if a young child entered the venue unsupervised, even though his or her parents might be held negligent for allowing that.\n1990s–present: Reconsideration.\nIn 1992 appeals courts in Chicago, hearing the cases of two spectators who had been injured at games of both of the city's MLB teams, showed less deference to the Baseball Rule than courts previously had. The state legislature responded by codifying the rule into statute. In the 21st century, courts in Idaho, Indiana, and New Mexico declined to adopt it, although in the latter instance that state's Supreme Court overruled the decision.\n\"Coronel v. Chicago White Sox\".\nBlanca Coronel's lawsuit against the White Sox had little to distinguish it from other cases in the Baseball Rule line. She had gone to Comiskey Park in 1986 to attend her first Sox game, where she sat behind the plate, five rows from the field and three seats outside the edge of the backstop. In the sixth inning, she reached down for some popcorn and when she looked up, a foul ball struck her in the face and broke her jaw. The trial court hearing her suit granted summary judgement for the team, and she appealed, arguing the team's duties to her rested on questions of triable fact.\nUnlike its predecessors in the other large states, however, the Illinois Appellate Court declined to reaffirm the Baseball Rule. Justice Anthony Scariano reviewed other cases, from Illinois and other states, including \"Wells\" and \"Akins\", to conclude that \"we cannot accept the suggestion advanced by the Sox that it should be they and not the jury who should determine the adequacy of the protection afforded its fans at a baseball game.\" The Sox' backstop, he pointed out, was only wide, narrower than the one at the high school game in \"Akins\", and a jury thus could consider whether that was sufficient protection.\nScariano also rejected the team's argument that it owed Coronel no duty to warn her of the hazards of foul balls beyond the language on the ticket and a warning on the scoreboard during the game. Illinois case law since the state's move to comparative negligence had held that even in the case of \"open and obvious\" dangers like foul balls landowners might still be found to have a duty to warn. One of the factors that might trigger that duty was the possibility that a visitor might have his or her attention diverted in a way that increased their risk of injury from the hazard, This Scariano saw as an especially apt point for baseball spectators:\nThe court remanded the case so a jury could decide the questions of fact.\n\"Yates v. Chicago National League Baseball Club\".\nAround the same time, a different division of the same Illinois appellate court heard \"Yates v. Chicago National League Ball Club\", a suit against the Cubs over a Leon Durham foul ball that struck the plaintiff in the face at Wrigley Field in 1983, ending his own baseball career and causing vision problems that persisted over the pendency of the case. A jury had found for him and the Cubs appealed.\nThe Cubs' appeal was primarily based on evidentiary issues at the trial. Most relevant to the Baseball Rule, the appeals court ruled that Yates did not have to introduce evidence that the amount of seats protected by the backstop was adequate to meet demand, as \"Coronel\" had narrowed a plaintiff's burden of proof to simply whether the screen was adequate protection without regard to the demand for seats behind them, and, contrary to one of the Cubs' other grounds for appeal, the jury could consider that question.\nThe appeals court also rejected the Cubs' argument that the ticket waiver created a contractual assumption of risk. Other Illinois case law had held that a contractual assumption of risk required that the plaintiff have assented to the agreement; this could not be so, the trial court had ruled, because \"the print was so small that it was not legibly reproduced on the photocopy submitted to the trial court.\"\nNew Mexico: \"Crespin\" and \"Edward\".\nThe New Mexico Court of Appeals became the first court to explicitly reject the Baseball Rule in 2009's \"Crespin v Albuquerque Baseball Club\". The Crespins' four-year-old son's skull was fractured by a ball hit into the stands during batting practice while the family was enjoying a pregame picnic, in an area with tables behind the outfield fence, for local Little Leaguers served by the minor league Albuquerque Isotopes. They sued the Isotopes, the city of Albuquerque as stadium owner, batter Dave Matranga, then with the New Orleans Zephyrs, and the Zephyrs' parent team, the Houston Astros, for whom Matranga had played in the majors.\nThe trial court granted summary judgement to all defendants. On appeal, the court affirmed it for the Astros and Matranga, since he had hit the ball fairly as baseball players are supposed to do (in a game, the court noted, the hit would have been a home run) and thus the Astros, for whom Matranga had once played, had trained him properly and neither he nor they could have been held negligent. But it reversed the judgement against the team and city.\n\"This case presents the first opportunity for a New Mexico appellate court to consider whether to carve out an exception to the usual tort doctrines for the sport of baseball.\" The court declined, finding the rule inconsistent with comparative negligence. \"Under our present tort system, we discern no public policy reason to justify bestowing immunity on the business of baseball.\" It remanded the case to the trial court so the jury could decide, among other issues, whether the Isotopes were negligent in failing to warn the picnickers that batting practice was about to begin.\nThe following year the state's Supreme Court overruled the appeals court, in a decision renamed \"Edward v. City of Albuquerque\". \"[W]e believe that a limited-duty rule\", Chief Justice Edward L. Chávez wrote for a unanimous court, \"albeit not the one argued for by defendants, is warranted by sound policy considerations.\" After a lengthy review of previous case law from in and out of state, he called the rule \"symmetrical\" in that while spectators had to exercise ordinary care to avoid injury from batted balls, while teams had a duty not to increase the risks. Chávez sought to balance the team's duties with the interest of spectators in catching a foul ball. He did, however, affirm the appeals court's denial of summary judgement, saying the city and team had not sufficiently established the facts to support it.\n\"Rountree v. Boise Baseball Club\".\nIn 2013's \"Rountree v. Boise Baseball Club\", Idaho's Supreme Court rejected the Baseball Rule. The plaintiff had been hit while eating in Memorial Stadium at a 2008 Boise Hawks game. The trial court had held that only the state legislature could adopt it, which Justice Jim Jones wrote for a unanimous court, was incorrect. But while the court could adopt it, he continued, \"[w]e find no compelling public policy requiring us to do so.\"\nThe court, Jones conceded, had earlier adopted the fireman's rule, limiting the liability of landowners for injuries suffered by responding emergency personnel on their property. But that recognized \"the fundamental link between firefighters confronting danger and sustaining consequent injuries.\" Jones did not see any similar reason the public had to expose itself to foul ball injuries to watch baseball. The opinion also rejected the defendants claim that implied primary assumption of risk was a valid defense in the case.\n\"South Shore Baseball LLC v. DeJesus\".\nThe year after \"Rountree\", the Indiana Supreme Court also declined to adopt the Baseball Rule, even as it held for the defendant team on the facts of the case. \"South Shore Baseball LLC v. DeJesus\" had been brought by a woman struck in the face by a pop-up foul on the opening day of the 2009 Gary SouthShore RailCats season at U.S. Steel Yard. She had been sitting just outside the screening, heard the foul and looked up to see it in time for it to strike her in the face, breaking several bones and blinding her in the left eye.\nAt trial, the team's motion for summary judgement was denied, then reversed on appeal. While DeJesus had argued that the netting should have extended further, she had testified that she had been to many RailCats games, that she was aware of the hazards of foul balls and had heard a warning to that effect over the stadium's public address system. She appealed to the state Supreme Court, which affirmed. \"This undisputed evidence shows DeJesus was not relying on the netting to protect her from the danger of foul balls,\" wrote Justice Mark Massa for a unanimous court.\nThe court had also been asked, in an \"amicus curiae\" brief filed by the Indianapolis Indians, the Pittsburgh Pirates triple-A minor league team in the state, to formally adopt the Baseball Rule, which it said the state had already done 70 years earlier in \"Emhardt\". Massa responded with a baseball metaphor: \"Although we appreciate a well-turned double play, we will take this particular pitch.\" \"Emhardt\"s holding had contained the essence of the rule, he agreed, but it was rooted in the legal doctrines the state had abandoned in favor of comparative negligence. \"We do not find it instructive here.\"\nMassa agreed that \"[b]aseball undoubtedly occupies a special place in American life and culture\", quoting praise for the sport from a 1911 decision of the court, but \"[n]evertheless, we are not convinced that any sport, even our national pastime, merits its own special rule of liability.\" If that was a decision the state should make, it was the state legislature's prerogative, he concluded.\nExceptions.\nInjury to non-spectating bystander.\nCourts have strictly adhered to the Baseball Rule, but they have almost always limited its applicability to spectators watching the game or walking through viewing areas, holding that only that activity gives rise to the assumed risk of foul ball injury. The first plaintiff to recover after Edling was a young Wisconsin girl who was hit in the face while her mother was adjusting her dress along a highway about from a baseball diamond at a park operated by the local trolley company; the family was not watching the game. \"There can be no serious claim that the respondent was guilty of contributory negligence, as she was on the highway and entirely ignorant of her danger\", the Wisconsin Supreme Court held in 1925 as it affirmed a $2,000 ($ in today's dollars) jury verdict in her favor.\nBatting practice.\nAnother 1925 case from the Midwest addressed an injury arising from batting practice, resulting in a change in procedure for that aspect of the pregame. The plaintiff in \"Cincinnati Base Ball Co. v. Eno\" was attending a Cincinnati Reds twi-night doubleheader four years earlier with her father; during batting practice between the games, which at the time consisted of several groups of players scattered around the field, she and her father went closer to the field for a look at the players practicing there, just away, a foul broke her jaw. The Ohio Supreme Court affirmed an appellate ruling that reversed the trial court's directed verdict for the team, distinguishing the case from \"Crane\" and its progeny by noting that multiple balls were in play during batting practice and spectators could not reasonably be expected to keep track of all of them. As a result of the case, the Reds and other professional teams began holding batting practice with only one batter at a time, swinging from home plate.\nLost bats.\nThe Baseball Rule has not been extended to cover injuries from lost bats that go into the stands. In 1938 a California appeals court considered the case of Martha Ratcliff, who had been walking down the aisle to her protected seat at a San Diego Padres Pacific Coast League game during batting practice when struck by a player's bat, which had slipped from his grip away. She prevailed at trial and was awarded $2,000 by the jury, a verdict sustained on appeal, since the evidence showed that bats had gone into the stands before and the court held that \"[i]t was a question for the jury whether such an accident as this could have been reasonably anticipated and we think the evidence is sufficient to sustain their finding upon that question.\"\nThrown balls.\n\"Maytnier v. Rush\".\nA ball errantly \"thrown\" into the stands as a consequence of a pitcher's warmup during the game, rather than batted, also was beyond the scope of the rule. In 1957, David Maytnier, 13, went to a Cubs doubleheader at Wrigley Field, where he got a front-row ticket that he had requested be as close to the Cubs' dugout as possible; he wound up being seated about 10 or 15 seats further away from the plate than the dugout. The seat was thus close to the bullpen, where a wild pitch by reliever Bob Rush struck Maytnier in the face during the sixth inning of the second game.\nMaytnier's father sued both Rush and the Cubs; testimony at trial revealed that the former, who had been having problems with his pitching that season, had been experimenting with a new pitch which in that particular instance, bullpen catcher Gordon Massa testified, had been above him and to his left, beyond his ability to catch when standing. The jury found for Maytnier against the team but for Rush against him.\nBoth Maytnier and the Cubs appealed. His appeal against the Rush verdict was dismissed as untimely. The Cubs' appeal made several arguments including all the previous Baseball Rule cases from Illinois and other states. The court distinguished them all from the instant case; instead it was more persuaded by \"Eno\" and \"Ratcliff\":\nThe case had thus been properly submitted to the jury, and the appeals court therefore declined to disturb it.\nPossibly as a consequence of \"Maytnier\", baseball venues at all levels banned players from playing pepper, a warmup exercise (sometimes played as an informal game in itself) in which a batter bats balls to several fielders nearby, due to the risk of similar injuries to spectators, since it was often played on the side of the field before games. This is often indicated with signs. Teams have also moved bullpens off the field to enclosed areas behind the back fence.\n\"Loughran v. The Phillies\".\nIn contrast to \"Maytnier\", injuries resulting from a ball \"deliberately\" thrown into the stands by a player as a souvenir were held beyond recovery under the Baseball Rule in a 2005 Pennsylvania case. Jeremy Loughran sued the team and outfielder Marlon Byrd after he was hit in the face and concussed by a ball thrown into the stands by Byrd after making the last out of an inning during a 2003 game. The trial court granted Byrd and the team summary judgement, and Loughran appealed.\nThree of the four judges on the Superior Court panel affirmed the trial court. They rejected Loughran's argument that Byrd's throw was not a customary part of the game and thus outside the scope of the risk he assumed in attending it. In so determining, \"we cannot be limited to the rigid standards of the Major League Baseball rule book; we must instead consider the actual everyday goings on that occur both on and off the baseball diamond\" the court wrote. \"[B]oth outfielders and infielders routinely toss caught balls to fans at the end of an inning\" which, indeed, had occurred 20 times that night, two of which landed near Loughran, before he was injured.\nJustice John Bender dissented, arguing that the majority should have distinguished between an accidental throw into the stands and Byrd's \"gratuitous\" toss, completely unnecessary to the game. \"Apparently, in the majority's view, a thrown ball is a thrown ball\" he wrote. \"I am unwilling to accept the premise that simply because the custom is commonplace, the commonality of the custom provides blanket immunity from the way it is carried out.\" Players throwing last-out balls into the stands as a gift to fans had a duty to exercise reasonable care in doing so, he reiterated.\nSpectators away from seating area.\n\"Jones v. Three Rivers Management Corporation\".\nOn July 16, 1970, the day the Pittsburgh Pirates played their first home game at Three Rivers Stadium, Evelyn Jones was walking one of the stadium's interior concourses before the game. There were openings that looked out over the field; during the course of her walk, she looked through some but did not stop to do so for long. Near right field, unaware that batting practice had begun, she turned to go to a concession stand for food, and as she did was struck in the eye by a batted ball.\nAt trial, a jury found for Jones against the Pirates and its subsidiary that managed the stadium, awarding her $125,000. The Superior Court panel that heard the appeal reversed both, but divided on the management company's liability. Jones appealed that decision to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.\n\"Movies must be seen in a darkened room, roller coasters must accelerate and decelerate rapidly and players will bat balls into the grandstand\", Justice Samuel J. Roberts wrote for a unanimous court, referring to other state tort precedents concerning inherent risks at places of amusement as well as the Baseball Rule, which he characterized as \"no-duty\". \"But even in a 'place of amusement' not every risk is reasonably expected.\" He noted that the openings and archways overlooking the field near where Jones was hit were architectural choices not essential to playing baseball, and thus the jury was properly charged with deciding whether the Pirates were negligent in operating the stadium with them. Their verdict was sustained; the Baseball Rule was held to apply only to those spectators in the seating area.\n\"Maisonave v. Newark Bears\".\nAlmost 30 years later, the New Jersey Supreme Court held similarly in \"Maisonave v. Newark Bears\", where the plaintiff had likewise suffered serious eye injuries after being hit by a foul ball when he turned around after hearing a warning while buying food from a vendor at a cart in an open area of the Riverfront Stadium concourse. After a trial court granted summary judgement to the team, an appeals court reversed and the Supreme Court sustained. Chief Justice James R. Zazzali's majority opinion, one of the earliest to refer to the rule specifically as the \"baseball rule\", held it imposed a limited duty on teams, since fans \"actively engage in the game by trying to catch foul balls\", but followed \"Jones\" in holding it applied only to injuries sustained by those spectators in areas of the venue specifically intended for them to view the game from:\nTwo justices wrote separate opinions. John E. Wallace Jr. concurred in the result, but said he found the Baseball Rule anachronistic. He called for it to be replaced with the business-invitee class of visitor that had preceded it, noting that even the majority had admitted that the most dangerous seats for foul ball injuries were no longer those behind home plate but along the baselines. Wallace rejected concerns that abandoning it would give rise to a legal regime in which baseball teams and park owners would be forced to protect \"every\" seat from foul balls. \"Instead,\" he wrote, \"the application of traditional tort principles, such as comparative negligence, will adequately even out the playing field for both sides.\"\nJustice Roberto A. Rivera-Soto, joined by Jaynee LaVecchia, took the opposite approach, concurring in the reaffirmation of the Baseball Rule but dissenting from its limitation to the seating area. While he agreed with Wallace that it was better that \"one and only one standard of care should apply in respect of the peril of objects leaving the playing field\", Rivera-Soto would have had the court adopt the broader Baseball Rule for spectators regardless of where they were in the stadium, approvingly quoting the trial court's holding that \"once a spectator, always a spectator — at least until the last out is registered.\" With the \"hybrid standard of care\", the decision adopted, ballparks might eventually be forced to completely seal off play, he feared.\n\"[U]nless relief is provided through the Legislature,\" Rivera-Soto warned, the state's minor league stadiums would \"serve as little more than a hothouse for budding tort litigation\" under \"Maisonave\". The following year, the state legislature responded to the decision by codifying the Baseball Rule into statute, just as its Illinois counterpart had done in response to \"Coronel\" and \"Yates\".\n\"Turner v. Mandalay Sports Entertainment LLC\".\nIn 2008, a divided Nevada Supreme Court came to the opposite conclusion in considering the case of a woman injured by a foul ball while sitting at a table on the concourse drinking beer at Cashman Field during a Las Vegas 51 game. Justice Ron Parraguirre wrote for a four-justice majority that, since the team had both verbal and signed warnings and the plaintiff chose to consume her beer in an unscreened area, one where she had not in his opinion demonstrated a significant risk of injury, it had not breached what it held to be its limited duty to her. In his dissent, Chief Justice Mark Gibbons, joined by Michael Cherry and Michael L. Douglas, agreed with the \"Maisonave\" court, which he quoted, that the Baseball Rule was properly limited to fans in areas meant for watching the game.\nMascot antics.\n\"Lowe v. California League of Professional Baseball\".\nIn the late 20th century many professional sports teams began creating mascots for their branding, depicting them in logos and hiring people to dress up as the characters and entertain fans in the stands during lulls in play. In 1994 John Lowe was attending a home game of the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes, the Los Angeles Dodgers Class A farm team, when the team's mascot, \"Tremor\", a seven-foot-tall () dinosaur played by a costumed team employee, repeatedly bumped his head with his tail. Lowe turned to look back eventually, and as he did was struck in the face by a foul ball, breaking several facial bones.\nLowe's suit named the California League and the team as defendants, who were granted summary judgement by the trial court. The appeals court found much to criticize in that action, primarily that the defendants' pleadings \"offered nothing in the way of either relevant or competent evidence\" that the facts were beyond dispute; they also referred to mascots as an \"intrical part of the game\". On that point the court noted that the team had played games the previous season without Tremor.\n\"As a matter of law, we hold that ... the game can be played in the absence of [a mascot]'s antics\" the court concluded. Those antics had increased Lowe's risk of injury, and therefore under California law the plaintiff had a right to a jury trial. It reversed the trial court and remanded the case.\n\"Harting v. Dayton Dragons Professional Baseball Club\".\nAn Ohio appeals court took a contrasting approach to the role of the mascot in the modern live baseball experience when it decided \"Harting v. Dayton Dragons Professional Baseball Club\" in 2005. The plaintiff had been watching a Dayton Dragons minor league game in 2005 at which the San Diego Chicken, a pioneering baseball mascot, was present. Harting was struck by a foul and knocked unconscious while he was performing in front of her; she sued both him and the team.\nThe trial court granted summary judgement to both defendants. Harting argued on appeal that their primary assumption of risk defense did not apply to her since she had been distracted by the Chicken. \"This argument ignores the fact that team mascots and their antics are common phenomena and the mascots are normally present during the entire course of the game\", the court responded. \"The fact that Harting was allegedly distracted by the Chicken ... when she was struck by the foul ball did not negate her duty to pay attention to the action taking place on the field.\" It further noted that she had not testified that the Chicken blocked her view of either the field or the foul ball.\n\"Coomer v. Kansas City Royals\".\nIn his \"Loughran\" dissent, Pennsylvania appellate justice John Bender had speculated about a hypothetical future case in which, under the majority's logic, \"one of those executing the hotdog launch imprudently aimed at spectators seated a couple of rows into the stands ... would be immune if a spectator lost an eye after getting hit nearly point blank by a foil wrapped hotdog.\" In 2009, that occurred, when John Coomer suffered a detached retina and cataracts requiring two surgeries after Kansas City Royals' mascot Sluggerrr hit him in the eye with a \"thrown\" hot dog. At his suit, a jury found for the team and he appealed.\nOn appeal the Missouri Supreme Court reversed. Judge Paul C. Wilson wrote for a unanimous court that, contrary to the jury's findings but per \"Lowe\", getting injured by a hot dog thrown by the team's mascot was \"not\" an inherent risk of watching baseball and a jury instruction to that effect was prejudicial to Coomer's case, since it was not a factual question for them to decide:\nOn retrial the jury found neither Coomer nor the team to have been at fault.\nCodification.\nFour states—Arizona, Colorado, Illinois and New Jersey—have formally codified the Baseball Rule into law. In the latter two, this was done after state courts had limited the rule's applicability in different ways.\nThe statutes the states adopted vary in the degree to which they have adopted the traditional components of the rule. In Arizona, teams are immune from liability for injuries from balls, bats or other equipment as long as they have offered enough protected seats to reasonably meet demand. New Jersey's law specifies that the team must protect the seats behind home plate. Illinois gives teams even more protection, requiring only that they keep the protective equipment in good order and exempting only a player's willful or wanton conduct. Colorado's statute, on the other hand, is the least specific, requiring only that teams \"make a reasonable and prudent effort to design, alter, and maintain the premises of the stadium in reasonably safe condition relative to the nature of the game of baseball\"\n\"Jasper v. Chicago National League Ball Club\".\nAfter the passage of the Illinois statute, James Jasper brought suit against the Cubs over a foul ball injury he claimed could have been prevented by a screen that had been removed in 1992 when the team installed skyboxes on the upper deck of Wrigley Field behind home plate. He asked the court to also declare the statute violated both the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution and a provision of the state constitution that forbids the legislature from conferring a special benefit or exclusive privilege without a good public policy reason. Other sports, Jasper noted, did not get the same degree of immunity that the Baseball Rule, now codified into law, offered teams in that sport; he also argued it benefited only for-profit teams since other statutes limited the liability of non-profit park owners.\nThe trial court granted the Cubs' motion for dismissal of the constitutional claims. On Jasper's appeal, the court found the statute constitutional. \"[T]he sport of baseball does have unique characteristics that would reasonably prompt a legislature to enact limited liability legislation\", it wrote, citing a similar case where the state's Supreme Court had upheld a law limiting the liability of landholders for injuries to snowmobilers on their property on the grounds that that recreational activity, too, had inherent dangers that property owners could not reasonably be expected to completely control. The court also rejected Jasper's claim that the statute's exclusion of golf courses could not be considered as he had not introduced any evidence suggesting a similar risk of injury from wayward golf balls; lastly it cited earlier cases in support of its dismissal of Jasper's contention that since other laws protected non-profit facility operators the legislature had only meant to protect the Cubs and White Sox:\nApplicability to other sports.\nBaseball is not the only sport that raises the potential for injuries to spectators struck by objects leaving the playing area. Litigation over injuries to ice hockey fans struck by hockey pucks at games in the U.S. dates to the 1930s, and there have also been suits from spectators injured by golf balls. Those actions have been guided by the Baseball Rule to some degree.\nIce hockey.\nLike baseball, hockey is played with a hard object that can leave the playing area and go into the stands at high speeds. As a result of this, rinks today have protective plexiglass shielding atop the boards. And like baseball, that shielding is higher in the areas where pucks are most likely to go into the stands: behind the goals. But unlike baseball, the gameplay is more flowing and continuous and requires fans to keep their eyes on a puck moving up and down the rink which may be difficult to see, much less anticipate.\nHockey was first played in the United States in the 1890s; professional leagues had formed within two decades and the Boston Bruins, the first American team in the National Hockey League, began playing in 1924; on lower levels the sport was primarily played in Northeastern and Midwestern states with cold winters. Lawsuits over injuries from pucks leaving the rink were first reported in the mid-1930s.\nSince hockey was less established in the United States than baseball, courts of that era were willing as they had not been in the latter instance to consider a spectator's degree of knowledge of the sport, or lack thereof, as a factor. This yielded different holdings in different states. In the first two cases of hockey puck injuries considered by New York courts in 1935, the Baseball Rule cases in existence at the time were cited as precedent to hold that hockey teams or rink operators had no duty to screen all the seats, just enough for those who wanted them, and that \"[i]t is common knowledge that the puck may leave the ice when the players are shooting for a goal.\"\nHowever, the Supreme Court of neighboring Massachusetts upheld a verdict the following year for a woman struck by a puck at Boston Garden, since it was the first hockey game she had attended and the usher who escorted her to her seat at center ice had not warned her that even with three vertical feet (1 m) of glass between her and the rink pucks could still come into the stands. Four years later the same court declined to disturb a jury's verdict in favor of a man who was injured by a puck as he was walking from his seat to use the bathroom. The defendant had argued for contributory negligence, but, the court said, the degree to which the accident could have been anticipated was a factual finding properly submitted to the jury.\nCiting the relative novelty of the sport, which had only been played in California for 12 years at that time, a 1939 appeals court in that state declined to apply the Baseball Rule to hockey in \"Thurman v. Ice Palace\". The plaintiff had attended an intramural University of Southern California hockey game at the defendant arena, where wire screens had been installed at the ends but not along the sides, where Thurman was sitting when a puck hit her in the mouth. Through her father, she sued the arena, the student organization that sponsored the game and all its members individually. The trial ended in a directed verdict for all the defendants, and she appealed.\nThe appeals court affirmed the individual defendants' motions for dismissal, but reversed the directed verdict for the entities. Rejecting both the New York courts' decisions from four years earlier, as well as the defendants' reliance on \"Quinn\", the court distinguished hockey from baseball by noting that in the former sport, the puck is \"ordinarily batted along the ice\", so spectators unfamiliar with the game, like Thurman, would not expect it to become airborne. Therefore:\nA Pennsylvania court echoed \"Thurman\"s reasoning in letting a verdict in favor of another woman who was injured at her first hockey game stand. \"The argument is made that this case is analogous to a spectator at a baseball game\", wrote a Court of Common Pleas judge in 1952's \"Schwilm v. Pennsylvania Sports\", alluding to many of the other cases without citing any. Had the plaintiff been sitting on the side of the rink the court would have applied the same principle as the Baseball Rule and granted the defense request for judgment notwithstanding verdict, but since she was sitting at the end, where the team had raised the stands at Pittsburgh's Duquesne Gardens to a higher level without similarly making the screens higher, and had no understanding that pucks can go into the stands before one hit her in the head, the jury had properly found that the team had been negligent in its duties to spectators.\nPrior to that case the consensus had been changing. Five years before \"Schwilm\", in \"Modec v. City of Eveleth\", the Minnesota Supreme Court upheld a trial court's decision to set aside a $2,500 verdict won by a plaintiff from the city after he was injured at a municipally owned rink leased to a private operator. On appeal, the plaintiff had cited the cases from Massachusetts and other states where juries had been allowed to consider whether a plaintiff unfamiliar with hockey had been properly advised of the dangers. But the court distinguished those states from Minnesota, where the sport had been widely popular for a long time: \"Hockey is played to such an extent in this region and its risks are so well known to the general public that as to the question before us there is no difference in fact between the two games so far as liability for flying baseballs and pucks is involved.\" Per its holdings in \"Wells\" and \"Brisson\", it affirmed the trial court.\nAn Illinois court still distinguished the two sports in the 1981 case of \"Riley v. Chicago Cougars Hockey Club\". The plaintiff had been sitting in the front row of the upper deck at a 1974 game of the World Hockey Association (WHA) Cougars when a slap shot was deflected upwards and struck him, knocking him unconscious and causing a Jacksonian seizure that left a permanent brain lesion resulting in occasional epileptic seizures. He sued both the league and the team, winning a $90,000 verdict from the jury. It was affirmed on appeal; the defense, citing \"Maytnier\", had asked the court to apply the Baseball Rule to hockey but it declined: \"We do not believe that the general nonliability rule that is usually applied in baseball cases is necessarily applicable in hockey cases, because there are fundamental differences in the way baseball and hockey are played and the dangers incident to the games.\"\nIn the later years of the 20th century, NHL attendance and interest grew as more games were broadcast and the league expanded. A half-century after the Minnesota court's decision in the Eveleth case, an appeals court in neighboring Wisconsin followed the trial court in extending the Baseball Rule (in the process making one of the earliest judicial references to it as such) to hockey in affirming a grant of summary judgement in favor of the Milwaukee Admirals, saying the plaintiff's admitted knowledge of hockey made her contributorily negligent enough to bar recovery even under comparative negligence. Courts in Pennsylvania and California made similar holdings. In the latter, the court noted, in the half-century since \"Thurman\", \"professional ice hockey has grown in popularity both in California and nationally. In the present case, it is undisputed that ice hockey spectators face a known risk of being hit by a flying puck.\"\nThe first years of the 21st century saw the first (and , only) fatal hockey puck injury at an NHL game. Brittanie Cecil, 13, was watching a Columbus Blue Jackets game at Nationwide Arena on March 16, 2002, from behind the goal, when she was struck in the temple by a deflected slap shot. Initially she appeared have suffered only a cut, but walked to a first-aid station and was taken from there to the hospital, where after first improving her condition deteriorated due to a torn vertebral artery that had not been discovered, leading to her death two days after the injury.\nHer parents sued the Blue Jackets and other parties; they were eventually able to settle out of court for $1.2 million. League commissioner Gary Bettman ordered all NHL teams to put higher netting behind their arenas' goals.\nGolf.\nCases involving injury from errant golf balls, which are smaller than baseballs or hockey pucks but are likewise very hard and travel at high speeds, account for half of all reported golf-related tort actions. Most, however, are between golfers themselves, among whom different standards of care apply, or to bystanders off the course. In the 1970s and '80s, several cases involving injuries to spectators who paid to attend golf tournaments or other events reached appeals courts. One commentator suggests cases of this type, analogous to baseball, are much rarer in golf since professional players of that sport \"tend to be able to do what the average Joe cannot—consistently hit golf shots.\"\nSome of the situations that gave rise to the injuries argued similar reasons to Baseball Rule cases as to why golf courses or sponsoring organizations should be held liable. While waiting in line at a concession stand between fairways during the 1973 Western Open, played at the Chicago-area Midlothian Country Club, Alice Duffy was struck in the right eye, blinding her. Her suit alleged that the country club had failed to exclude spectators from the concession stand area, which she claimed had a higher risk of injury that the club was aware of.\nThe trial court granted summary judgement to the defendants; Duffy appealed, arguing a triable issue of fact existed. The appeals court agreed with her and reversed. Among the cases it relied on was \"Maytnier\", which it held to similarly deny the contractual assumption of risk defense and require that the defense argue more than just the plaintiff's awareness of a defect but the plaintiff's specific knowledge of that defect. On retrial the jury found for Duffy and awarded her almost $450,000, a verdict affirmed after the club's appeal.\n\"Grisim v. Tapemark Charity Pro-Am Golf Tournament\".\n\"Grisim v. Tapemark Charity Pro-Am Golf Tournament\", a 1986 Minnesota case, most directly reaches the underlying issue of the Baseball Rule: the availability of protected seating. The plaintiff had been attending the defendant tournament, where she was watching a golfer complete the 18th hole; since the bleachers next to the green were mostly full she decided to watch from under a nearby tree, where other spectators had already chosen to sit. Her left eye had to be surgically removed after being struck.\nThe trial court granted summary judgement to the defendant tournament and country club, holding that primary assumption of risk barred the claim. Grisim appealed and the court agreed with her that that was reversible error. Citing \"Wells\", it said there was a triable issue of fact for the jury as to whether the club had provided enough of the protected seating behind the green.\nOutside the U.S..\nCanada.\nLiability for injuries to spectators from projectiles leaving the playing area in Canada has long been controlled by a case arising from a hockey puck injury. In 1934's \"Elliott v. Amphitheatre Ltd.\", the Court of King's Bench of Manitoba, after reviewing many of the precedent American baseball cases, denied recovery on the grounds of assumption of risk: \"The proprietor is held not to be an insurer and spectators assume the risk peculiar to that form of amusement.\" It was also one of the authorities cited by the Minnesota Supreme Court in \"Modec\"; but a decade earlier the Rhode Island Supreme Court, asked to consider \"Elliott\" as precedent by a defendant hockey rink, distinguished it from the one before it, since Elliott had testified to having watched many hockey games whereas the plaintiff in the case before it was attending her first hockey game and the Manitoba court had pointed to Elliott's familiarity as a reason for its decision.\nJapan.\nIn all home stadiums of Nippon Professional Baseball teams, netting protecting the closest seats to the field extends all the way to the foul poles. When a foul ball gets over it, ushers point to it with a loud whistling device to alert fans, and immediately check on anyone who appears to have made contact with the ball. Signs at the entrances to sections remind fans of the danger, and animated video clips warning fans to watch for fouls are regularly played on the scoreboard; tickets also have waivers printed on the back as they do in the U.S.\nThe Tokyo Dome, home of the popular Yomiuri Giants, includes one section without netting. Spectators pay extra for these seats, known as \"excitement\" seats. A glove and helmet is provided with each one; however many of those who sit in those seats do not use them.\nDespite these protections, foul balls do go into the stands and injure fans, who sometimes sue. In 2015, a woman blinded in one eye by a foul ball at a Nippon Ham Fighters game in the Sapporo Dome won a (just under US$380,000) verdict against the team. The Fighters responded by adding a warning horn to the ushers' whistles.\nCriticism.\nIn the late 2010s, two widely-covered incidents brought the Baseball Rule into focus and led to calls for it to be abolished or greatly modified. Late in the New York Yankees 2017 season, a one-year-old girl attending a game at Yankee Stadium with her parents and grandparents was struck by a foul, suffering multiple facial fractures that led to a five-day hospital stay. The Yankees announced afterwards that they would join other MLB teams in extending their protective netting to the far end of the dugout from the near end, where it had been up to that point.\nThe next season every team would have expanded screening, but that did not prevent the second foul-ball injury spectator death in MLB history, also at Dodger Stadium. Near the end of a Dodgers-San Diego Padres game, a foul ball went over the top of the fencing and struck Linda Goldbloom, 79, seated just below the press box, in the head. She died in a hospital four days later.\nOutdatedness.\nIn a number of the Baseball Rule cases, particularly the more recent ones, judges, first in dissents such as \"Akins\" and \"Rudnick\", and later in the \"Crespin\" and \"Rountree\" majorities, rejected the Baseball Rule as an artifact of the tort-law regime that prevailed before comparative negligence, when assumption of risk and contributory negligence were absolute bars to a plaintiff's recovery, and a reminder of why that transition was made in the first place. But some also recognized that baseball, as well, had changed considerably since then and there was no reason for the law to sentimentalize the sport.\nBob Gorman, coauthor of \"Death at the Ballpark\", notes on his blog that \"Crane\" was decided during an era of baseball now known as the dead ball era, when games were generally low-scoring and teams relied generally on the small ball strategy of getting singles to advance their runners along the bases and get them in scoring positions. Home runs were rare and so were foul balls hit into the stands as batters did not regularly swing for the fences. The same ball could be used for the entire game, and often was. In 1918, a newer, harder ball was introduced, and batters began hitting home runs more frequently.\nThe general admission policy under which Crane bought his ticket has also long vanished, replaced by reserved seating, often for an entire season, in which case a spectator could not move to a protected section even when those seats are empty. And the price of protected seating itself has risen far faster than inflation: single-game tickets for seats behind home plate and the backstop today cost in the $150–300 range, more than 10 times what Crane could have paid for a protected seat in 1911.\nChanges in gameplay and presentation.\nIn a 2018 \"William and Mary Law Review\" article calling on courts to modify or even abolish the Baseball Rule, authors Nathaniel Grow and Zachary Flagel took note of how the game has changed even since the end of the dead ball era. Pitchers today throw the ball much harder, and batters likewise have improved their physical training and consequently their hitting power; it was estimated that the Todd Frazier foul which injured the young girl at Yankee Stadium was traveling at when it struck her. At those speeds, spectators have less than half a second to react in the time it takes a ball to reach the stands, barely more than the quarter-second average human reaction time to visual stimuli. In 2004, the Massachusetts Appeals Court noted the testimony of a plaintiff's expert witness, an engineering professor who calculated that a woman with no baseball familiarity who suffered permanent facial injuries from a foul that hit her at a Boston Red Sox game had little more than a second from the time the ball was hit to react to it, although it upheld summary judgement for the team per Massachusetts' earlier acceptance of the Baseball Rule.\nGrow and Flagler also calculated that early 21st century spectators are closer to the field of play than their counterparts of previous eras. The advent of retro-classic ballparks in the mold of Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards accelerated a trend of putting spectators closer to the action. Backstops are now closer to home plate than they were in the mid-20th century, and the amount of overall foul territory has declined 21 percent since 1920, shortly after the Baseball Rule was established, suggesting spectators' ability to react to a foul has been correspondingly attenuated. Most of this decline has occurred since the early 1990s.\nAs the cases involving mascot antics attest, spectators are offered a greater degree of distractions. In the past, spectators' attention, as it was in \"Keys\", might be diverted from the action on the field only by socializing with those seated nearby. \"While fans of yesteryear could be held responsible\nfor their own assumption of risk associated with being hit by a projectile\nleaving the field,\" wrote the authors of a 2002 \"Marquette Sports Law Review\" article, \"such a finding was predicated on the fact that the injured fan was watching the game rather than turning his attention away from the game.\"\nBut, \"baseball games today are increasingly marketed as multifaceted entertainment experiences, offering spectators a variety of additional stimuli potentially distracting their attention from the action on the field\", Grow and Flagler write. In addition to the mascots, increasingly sophisticated scoreboards run detailed video graphics with advertisements and scores and video highlights of games being played elsewhere. Ballparks also now offer free Wi-Fi, encouraging fans to use their smartphones to interact with players via social media during games, or order food for later pickup.\nImprovements in pitching, such as better conditioning and an increased reliance on specialist relief pitchers, have led to an increase in foul balls; in 2017 the number of foul balls exceeded balls put in play for the first time, according to FiveThirtyEight. Most of those foul balls have gone into the stands; the website attributes this development to the shrinkage of foul territory on the playing field. In 2014 Bloomberg News estimated that there were, on average, 1,750 foul ball injuries at MLB parks every season; meaning fans get hit by foul balls more than batters get hit by a pitch.\nIncompatibility with law and economics.\nGrow and Flagel note that the Baseball Rule, unlike many other areas of tort law, has not been reexamined under law and economics, a movement that began with Guido Calabresi's 1970 book \"The Cost of Accidents\". The goal in torts under law and economics is for most liability to rest with the party that can avoid the most risk at the least cost. \"By doing so,\" they write, \"courts can allocate liability in a way that increases the likelihood the parties will adopt the optimal level of precaution necessary in a given case, thus minimizing the overall social cost of accidents.\"\nIt would cost MLB teams, which collectively see around $10 billion a year in revenue, mere thousands and a few days to install more of netting in thinner sizes which are less visually obstructive, Grow and Flagel argue. Injured spectators, on the other hand, 7.5 percent of whom require hospitalization, bear the costs of their own medical care (or their insurers) if they cannot recover in court. Those have reached $150,000 in some cases.\nAdditional screening, Grow and Flagel allow, will have some additional costs to teams beyond the installation. As many of the Baseball Rule cases have noted, the unprotected seats offer fans not just an unobstructed view but a chance to catch and keep a foul ball, which teams have permitted fans to do since 1921. Some may decide not to attend if that opportunity is denied them; however Grow and Flagel believe fans will adjust. The seats behind home plate and thus the backstop, they note, are typically the most expensive at any ballpark, \"suggest[ing] that fans will continue to prioritize proximity to the field over an unobstructed view, and will adjust to the presence of additional netting.\".\nFans, by contrast, have three options to reduce their risk: sit in a protected seat, sit in a distant area of the stadium beyond reach of foul balls, or not attend the game at all. Grow and Flagel do not think these options are optimal. As previously noted, it is often utterly impossible or costly to obtain tickets behind screening. Fans choosing to sit in the upper decks will make the experience of watching games less desirable, and not going to games at all would cost teams more than the netting would. \"The insights provided by the law-and-economics movement strongly suggest that the Baseball Rule currently fails to impose liability on the lowest cost and best risk avoider—the team itself—in the most efficient and socially optimal manner\", Grow and Flagel write.\nGrow and Flagel argue that courts should abandon the Baseball Rule, or seriously modify it. They recommend subjecting teams to a strict liability standard for spectator injuries, which they admit might increase ticket prices but could be balanced by allowing some consideration of a spectator's own negligence, such as intoxication or making a deliberate attempt to catch the ball. Should courts or legislatures decline to do so, they could then expand the definition of the most dangerous area of the field, which most courts, along with the New Jersey statute enacted in response to \"Maisonave\", have historically defined as the area behind home plate, without any real evidence. \"The fact that MLB itself has officially encouraged its teams to extend their protective netting beyond just the area immediately behind home plate,\" they observe, \"strongly suggests that the Baseball Rule, as traditionally applied, no longer imposes a reasonable level of care upon professional baseball teams.\"\nCourts could also hold that teams have a duty to warn fans about the dangers of foul balls entering the stands to a greater extent than they currently do, contrary to the common law that landowners generally do not have to, Grow and Flagel write. While spectators may be aware that foul balls do enter the stands, they may be under the impression those are pop flies, more easily avoidable than the line drive fouls that have caused injuries and deaths, and they may overestimate their ability to react to the latter. While mandatory warnings of hazards have been criticized as ineffectual, courts have been receptive to them in situations where the risk of distraction is high. Grow and Flagel suggest that if warnings were mandated, teams would have an incentive to experiment and find the most effective ways of delivering them.\nDefenses and responses.\nThe Baseball Rule has its defenders. \"The fact that the limited duty rule has its origins in the earliest\ndays of baseball does not mean it's anachronistic or unfair\" writes David Tavella. Without it, he believes teams would have no choice but to screen off the entire field, depriving most fans of a chance to catch a foul or connect with the players. In particular, he criticizes the New Mexico appeals court's \"Crespin\" decision, which had not yet been overruled at the time of his writing, as going too far in leaving all determinations of duty to the jury, which could lead to inconsistent results. Were the Baseball Rule to be modified, he believes, \"Maisonave\" is a more sensible standard, in his opinion, since it limits the rule's application to spectators engaged in the game from the seating area and its immediate vicinity.\nTavella also dismisses complaints about the reliance on assumption of risk. \"The [criticisms] generally are that the rule is old, so it must be changed.\" He is dubious of plaintiffs who testify that their baseball knowledge was so limited that they had no idea balls would leave the field of play, saying that danger should be obvious to a first-time spectator. Tavella believes that a combination of the limited-duty rule established in \"Maisonave\", the assumption of risk defense, and a general negligence standard would best balance the interests of teams and spectators.\nThe cases involving mascot antics have come in for specific criticism. Ross Freeman, a law student at Missouri at the time, argued in 2015 that \"Coomer\" in particular was wrongly decided for both legal and policy reasons. On a legal basis, he noted, the state did not recognize different degrees of negligence. He saw even stronger policy reasons, believing the decision would adversely affect the state's MLB teams.\nCiting a 2013 article in \"The Wall Street Journal\" that found the total actual gameplay in MLB games averaged about 18 minutes out of the three hours it usually took to play, Freeman argued that mascots and other in-stadium entertainment were now inextricably part of the game, contrary to the state supreme court's holding:\nThe court could also have distinguished \"Coomer\" from \"Lowe\", the California precedent it relied on, Freeman wrote, by noting that Tremor's behavior in the latter case was not just negligent but recklessly so.\nGarrett Broshuis, a former minor league player and baseball writer who has since become an attorney, makes similar arguments for both retaining the Baseball Rule and not applying it to objects tossed by mascots. In the former instance, he notes, in addition to other arguments, that stadium designers allow for it. In the latter, he sees little difference between the launched or thrown hot dogs and foul balls, as both are often equally desired. \"So long as adequate care is taken in the selection of such souvenirs for tossing, these two attributes—spectator awareness and spectator desirability—dictate that the baseball rule should extend to souvenirs thrown into the stands.\""

        "text": "The men's artistic individual all-around competition at the 1936 Summer Olympics was held at the Waldbühne on 10 and 11 August. It was the ninth appearance of the event. There were 111 competitors from 14 nations, with each nation sending up to 8 competitors. The event was won by Alfred Schwarzmann of Germany, the nation's first victory in the men's individual all-around. Germany also received bronze, with Konrad Frey taking third. Silver went to Switzerland's Eugen Mack.\nBackground.\nThis was the ninth appearance of the men's individual all-around. The first individual all-around competition had been held in 1900, after the 1896 competitions featured only individual apparatus events. A men's individual all-around has been held every Games since 1900.\nNine of the top 10 gymnasts from the 1932 Games returned: gold medalist Romeo Neri of Italy, silver medalist István Pelle of Hungary, bronze medalist Heikki Savolainen of Finland, fifth-place finisher Savino Guglielmetti of Italy, sixth-place finisher Frank Haubold of the United States, seventh-place finisher Oreste Capuzzo of Italy, eighth-place finisher Fred Meyer of the United States, ninth-place finisher Mauri Nyberg-Noroma of Finland, and tenth-place finisher Al Jochim of the United States. Neri, Nyberg-Noroma, and Savolainen had all been in the top 10 in 1928 as well. The reigning (1934) World Champion was Eugen Mack of Switzerland, with Nero second and Emanuel Löffler of Czechoslovakia third.\nAustria, Bulgaria, and Romania each made their debut in the event. Italy made its eighth appearance, most among nations, having missed only the 1904 Games in St. Louis.\nCompetition format.\nThe gymnastics format returned to the aggregation format used in 1928 but not in 1932. Each nation entered a team of eight gymnasts (Bulgaria had only 7). Scores for each exercise were on a scale of 0 to 10. All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise, with the scores summed to give a final total for each apparatus of up to 20. The scores in each of the six apparatus competitions were added together to give individual all-around scores (up to 120); the top six individual scores on each team were summed to give a team all-around score (up to 720). No separate finals were contested.\nSchedule.\nThere were two sessions each day. Nations assigned to one session on Day 1 as follows:\nOn day 2, the assignments were based on the standings for the team event with the leading nations going in the later session:\nResults.\nRomeo Neri, the individual all-around champion from the previous 1932 Summer Olympics, injured himself during the competition and finished last."

The Falcons were led by first-year head coach Scot Loeffler and played their home games at Doyt Perry Stadium in Bowling Green, Ohio. They competed as members of the East Division of the Mid-American Conference (MAC).\nPreseason.\nCoaching changes.\nSeven games into the 2018 season, Bowling Green fired third-year head coach Mike Jinks; defensive coordinator Carl Pelini served as interim head coach for the remainder of the season.

        "text": "The 1988 NCAA Division III Men's Ice Hockey Tournament was the culmination of the 1987–88 season, the 5th such tournament in NCAA history. It concluded with Wisconsin-River Falls defeating Elmira in the championship series 3-0 in the deciding mini-game. All Quarterfinals matchups were held at home team venues, while all succeeding games were played in Elmira, New York.\nPlattsburgh State's tournament performance was later vacated due to NCAA violations.\nThe NCAA stopped naming an all-tournament team beginning with this tournament. The all-tournament team would next be awarded in 2009. Additionally, the Tournament Most Outstanding Player was not awarded but it would be conferred the following season.\nQualifying teams.\nThe following teams qualified for the tournament. There were no automatic bids, however, conference tournament champions were given preferential consideration. No formal seeding was used while quarter and semifinal matches were arranged so that the road teams would have the shortest possible travel distances. Because the semifinal series were played at home team venues the NCAA elected to select an equal amount of eastern and western teams.\nFormat.\nThe tournament featured three rounds of play. Starting in 1988, each round of the tournament consisted of a two-game series with a 20-minute mini-game used to determine a winner. Mini-game scores are in \"italics\". Also, in 1988, the third-place game was discontinued. The teams were seeded according to geographic proximity in the quarterfinals so the visiting team would have the shortest feasible distance to travel.\nBracket.\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "text": "Jack Nicklaus' Unlimited Golf &amp; Course Design is a 1990 golf video game developed by Sculptured Software and published by Accolade for the Amiga and MS-DOS. A Super NES version with the same golf courses, titled Jack Nicklaus Golf, was released in May 1992. It is the second in a series of golf games named after golfer Jack Nicklaus, following \"Jack Nicklaus' Greatest 18 Holes of Major Championship Golf\" (1988).\nThe game includes a golf course designer that allows the player to create customized courses. The computer version was praised for its graphics and course designer, although reviewers criticized the long reanimation times in each version of the game. It was followed by \"\" (1992).\nGameplay.\nThe game includes the real-life Muirfield Village and the fictional game-only course \"The Bear's Track,\" both designed by Nicklaus. Unlike its predecessor, the game also includes a golf course designer, allowing the player to create a customized course. Three vacant plots exist for the player to create custom courses, and the two existing courses can also be edited. In designing courses, the player can choose between three types: mountainside, parkside, and seaside. The course designer features various options, including hills, valleys, trees, and lakes. The player can also create custom backgrounds for the courses. Several add-on disks, released for the game and its predecessor, can be used to add additional golf courses. Courses created with \"Jack Nicklaus' Unlimited Golf &amp; Course Design\" can be imported into the subsequent game, \"\".\nGame modes include skins and stroke, and the player can choose to rewind a poor golf shot and try it again. The golfer is viewed from a third-person perspective, and each hole starts with an overhead angle above the course which allows the player to view the distance to the hole. The game informs the player of the distance to the hole, and offers a selection of golf clubs. A power bar along the left side of the screen controls the shot. Jack Nicklaus appears in the game to give advice to the player before each hole, and the game provides an option to view each shot through a reverse-angle replay. The Super NES version features the same courses and a course designer. It also includes a password feature, and a replay option with various angles.\nRelease.\n\"Jack Nicklaus' Unlimited Golf &amp; Course Design\" was released in the United States in June 1990, for the Amiga and MS-DOS. Jack Nicklaus was involved in the game's design. The game was accompanied by a 224-page guide book, \"The Official Guide to Jack Nicklaus Computer Golf\", which gives advice on course design. The book was published by Compute Publications and written by Mark Harrison, with a foreword by Nicklaus.\nThe Super NES version, titled \"Jack Nicklaus Golf\", was released in the United States in May 1992. It was published by Tradewest, along with an unrelated Game Boy version also titled \"Jack Nicklaus Golf\". The Amiga version received a budget re-release in 1994, published by Action Sixteen.\nReception.\nThe computer version received praise for its graphics and course designer. Jeff Prosise of \"PC Magazine\" considered it to be \"the best, most realistic golf simulation on the market\", and praised the sound and various game options. \"PC Magazine\"s Jonathan Matzkin ranked it among the magazine's compilation of the best games of 1990. \"Amazing Computing\" considered the game superior to its 1988 predecessor, praising the \"nicer\" graphics and stating that they load faster than the previous game, although others criticized the slow reanimation. Albert Kim of \"Sports Illustrated\" considered the game entertaining and praised the course designer, but stated that the designer took some time to master, with the instruction manual being 156 pages long. \"Boston Herald\" called it \"one of the best computer golf games available,\" and praised its add-on course disks. Michael J. Himowitz of \"The Baltimore Evening Sun\" praised the gameplay, realistic courses, and various camera angles. Tom Malcom of \".info\" considered it to be the best golf game available up to that time.\nThe Super NES version was also criticized for slow reanimation; Jonathan Davies of \"Super Play\" stated that because the \"nice\" graphics take so long to animate, the game was \"virtually unplayable.\" \"N-Force\" praised the digitized graphics and the replay options of the Super NES version, but stated that the game needed more holes, while reviewers for \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" considered the game to be average.\nSeveral critics reviewed the game's Amiga re-release. \"Amiga Action\" considered the graphics to be average and stated that it was \"far too easy to mess a shot up.\" The magazine further wrote that the game possibly had the thickest instruction manual ever for a golfing game, with more than half of it devoted to the course designer, and stated that designing courses would be fun, but \"the long wait for the whole thing to activate isn't worth it.\" Jonathan Davies, then writing for \"Amiga Power\", stated that the course designer \"works undeniably well,\" but that it would only appeal to hardcore golfers. Davies considered \"PGA Tour\" and \"Nick Faldo's Championship Golf\" to be superior games. Tony Dillon of \"CU Amiga\" criticized the graphics for being blocky, simple, and repetitive. Dillon also criticized the gameplay, writing that it alternated between too easy and too difficult. \"The One Amiga\" praised the game's graphics and various options, including the course designer, but criticized the sluggish controls and inconsistent shot accuracy."

The United States made its fifth appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the inaugural 1896 Games.\nCompetition format.\nThe gymnastics format returned to the aggregation format used in 1928 but not in 1932. Each nation entered a team of eight gymnasts (Bulgaria had only 7). All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise, with the scores summed to give a final total. The scores in the rings were added to the other apparatus scores to give individual all-around scores; the top six individual scores on each team were summed to give a team all-around score. No separate finals were contested.\nThe compulsory exercise was described in the Official Report (dashes indicate \"clearly perceptible\" pauses):"

        "text": "The men's parallel bars competition at the 1936 Summer Olympics was held at the Waldbühne on 10 and 11 August. It was the sixth appearance of the event. There were 110 competitors from 14 nations, with each nation sending a team of up to 8 men. The event was won by Konrad Frey of Germany, the nation's first victory in the event since 1896 (and second overall, with Germany having the winning gymnast both times it competed). Germany also took the bronze, as Alfred Schwarzmann finished third. Second place and the silver medal went to Michael Reusch of Switzerland. Germany was the first nation to have two gymnasts win the parallel bars.\nBackground.\nThis was the sixth appearance of the event, which is one of the five apparatus events held every time there were apparatus events at the Summer Olympics (no apparatus events were held in 1900, 1908, 1912, or 1920). Eight of the 15 gymnasts from 1932 returned: silver medalist István Pelle of Hungary, bronze medalist Heikki Savolainen of Finland, fourth-place finisher Mauri Nyberg-Noroma of Finland, sixth-place finisher Al Jochim of the United States, seventh-place finishers József Hegedűs and Miklós Péter of Hungary, tenth-place finisher Savino Guglielmetti of Italy, and eleventh-place finisher Frank Haubold of the United States. All but Guglielmetti had also competed in 1928. 1932 gold medalist Romeo Neri was competing in Berlin but did not contest the parallel bars. Switzerland had swept the podium at the 1934 world championships with Eugen Mack, Josef Walter, and Walter Bach.\nAustria and Romania each made their debut in the men's parallel bars. The United States made its fifth appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the inaugural 1896 Games.\nCompetition format.\nThe gymnastics format returned to the aggregation format used in 1928 but not in 1932. Each nation entered a team of eight gymnasts (Bulgaria had only 7). All entrants in the gymnastics competitions (Neri of Italy did not compete in the parallel bars) performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise, with the scores summed to give a final total. The scores in the parallel bars were added to the other apparatus scores to give individual all-around scores; the top six individual scores on each team were summed to give a team all-around score. No separate finals were contested.\nThe compulsory exercise was described in the Official Report:"

        "title": "Drew McDonald (basketball)",
        "text": "Drew McDonald (born September 9, 1996) is an American former basketball player. He played college basketball for the Northern Kentucky Norse. McDonald was named the conference's Player of the Year in 2019.\nBorn in the Cincinnati area to a high school basketball coach and growing up in the suburb of Cold Spring, Kentucky, McDonald was lightly recruited by NCAA Division I programs and unranked by recruiting services despite being a finalist for Kentucky's Mr. Basketball award at Newport Central Catholic High School. In four seasons at Northern Kentucky University (NKU), he has become the school's all-time leader in points and rebounds, and has also been called \"the on-court catalyst ushering in the Division I era of Norse Athletics\" by Premier Sports Management, the administrator of the annual Senior CLASS Awards in multiple NCAA sports.\nEarly life and high school.\nUnlike most sons of coaches in men's college basketball, McDonald's coaching parent is his mother. Following a college basketball career at NKU, the former Christie Freppon married former NKU tennis player Jeff McDonald, going on to become head girls' basketball coach at Newport Central Catholic (NCC or NewCath) during Drew's childhood. Drew, the only son among the McDonalds' three children, served as a ball boy while his mother was coaching. In a 2018 interview for NKU's student newspaper, McDonald recalled, \"It was just kind of a lifestyle. I would just go shoot on the sidelines and go be around the team. I just like being around it. That’s just, the way we lived was basketball. It shaped me into how I am today.\" He also picked up many of the game's subtleties even before turning 10; in the same story, his mother said, \"I think we’ve gone through 20 of them [dry-erase boards]. He would be in the family room with the whiteboard and the marker drawing (plays). He was doing it for hours and everyday.\" His mother used many of the plays the young McDonald drew up in NewCath games. As McDonald progressed in the sport, his mother remained a vocal presence, with Drew recalling that she was \"the LaVar Ball of Newport Central Catholic.\"\nAfter a major growth spurt in middle school that saw him add 12 inches (30 cm), McDonald went on to attend NCC, where he was a star in both basketball and golf. In basketball, he was initially on the junior varsity team as a freshman, and got to dress for varsity games, but moved full-time to the varsity early in that season after scoring 22 points off the bench in a varsity game. He averaged 11.7 points and 6.5 rebounds as a freshman, and by his senior season had increased those averages to 16.8 and 10.7. During his NCC career, the Thoroughbreds went 129–20 overall, winning state titles in the All \"A\" Classic, an in-season state tournament for Kentucky's smallest high schools, in each of his last three seasons. In his senior season of 2014–15, he was a finalist for Kentucky Mr. Basketball, also sharing player of the year honors in the Kentucky High School Athletic Association's 9th Region (which covers Northern Kentucky). In golf, he won nearly 50 individual titles on Northern Kentucky's junior circuit and more than 50 other individual titles, including an All \"A\" state championship as a senior.\nRecruiting.\nMcDonald was not highly ranked by most recruiting outlets, partly because he had equally talented teammates at other positions. While he received two other Division I scholarship offers from UNC Asheville and Wright State, he was a priority recruit for NKU's coach at the time, Dave Bezold. McDonald's NKU heritage also played into his decision—not only were both of his parents athletes at the school, but a cousin played volleyball at both NKU and Xavier, and a late uncle, Bill Aker, had been head baseball coach at NKU for nearly 30 years, and is the namesake of NKU's baseball field. When McDonald verbally committed to the Norse before his senior year at NewCath, he told \"The Cincinnati Enquirer\", \"They wanted me and they've wanted me for about two years,\" adding \"I wanted to go somewhere where I was wanted. My dream has always been to play in the NCAA tournament, and what better way to do that then to lead your hometown school to its first March Madness and play in front of all your friends and family.\" He initially wanted to play both basketball and golf in college, but quickly concluded that the time demands of participating in both sports at the Division I level would be too great, and put his competitive golf career on hold upon his graduation from NewCath.\nCollege career.\nHis freshman season of 2015–16 was NKU's first in the Horizon League. Although mostly playing off the bench, he still averaged nearly 20 minutes per game and finished with averages of 10.5 points and 6.2 rebounds, also amassing five double-doubles. He was twice named the Horizon League's Freshman of the Week, led the Norse in scoring during conference play, and made the league's All-Freshman Team at the end of the season.\nThe following season was the first in which the Norse were eligible for the NCAA Tournament, following the end of the school's four-year transition from NCAA Division II. In that season, McDonald led the Norse in both scoring (16.4 points) and rebounds (7.7). His 37 points on January 7, 2017, against Cleveland State were the most by an NKU player since the school's 2012 move to Division I. McDonald was named to the All-Horizon League first team at the end of the regular season, and was also named to the conference's five-member All-Academic Team for men's basketball; the only other individual named to both teams was conference Player of the Year Alec Peters of Valparaiso. NKU went on to win the Horizon League tournament, becoming only the seventh Division I men's team overall and the second since 1970 to reach the NCAA tournament in its first season of eligibility; McDonald was named to the all-tournament team. NKU's season ended in the first round of the NCAA tournament with a 79–70 loss to Kentucky.\nPrior to McDonald's junior season of 2017–18, he was named the Horizon League's preseason player of the year. He again led the Norse in scoring and rebounding (17.0 and 9.6), and also led the conference in double-doubles with 18 as the Norse won the Horizon League regular-season title outright. McDonald was again named to the All-Horizon League first team and All-Academic Team, this time as the only individual to make both teams. The Norse were shocked in the quarterfinals of the Horizon League tournament by Cleveland State, landing them in the National Invitation Tournament as a conference regular-season champion that did not make the NCAA tournament. They would lose 66–58 in the first round at Louisville despite a halftime lead and a double-double from McDonald. After the season, McDonald was named as a Lou Henson All-American as one of the top 30 mid-major players in Division I men's basketball. During the 2018 offseason, McDonald represented the US in the inaugural FISU America games for university athletes in the Americas, held in Brazil, with the USA winning the gold medal.\nHis senior season of 2018–19 saw him named again as the Horizon League's preseason player of the year. McDonald was also named as one of 20 preseason candidates for the Karl Malone Award, presented by the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame to the top Division I men's power forward. Early in the season, he was named one of 30 candidates for the men's basketball version of the Senior CLASS Award, and was later named as one of the 10 finalists for that award. During the season, he became the all-time rebounding leader for the Norse in a loss to Eastern Kentucky on December 8, 2018, and surpassed the 1,000-rebound mark in a win over Detroit Mercy on February 7, 2019. At the time, he was one of only nine active Division I men's players with 1,000 or more rebounds, and only the sixth player in Horizon League history to reach the milestone. On March 2, in his final regular-season college game, a win over Green Bay that secured a share of the Horizon League regular-season title, he surpassed the 2,000-point mark and became the school's all-time scoring leader. As of the end of the regular season, McDonald again led the team in scoring (19.3) and rebounds (9.6). McDonald was also named to the Horizon League All-Academic team for the third time. On the opening day of the Horizon League tournament, he was named the conference's Player of the Year.\nPost-college.\nFollowing the close of his college career, McDonald did not pursue a professional basketball career. Instead, he accepted a role with the Northern Kentucky Chamber of Commerce as a membership representative.\nPersonal life.\nMcDonald's athletic pedigree goes well beyond his NKU family connections. Christie's father and brother, Tom Freppon Sr. and Jr., respectively played basketball at Xavier and Thomas More. In addition to the aforementioned cousin, two of his aunts played college volleyball, one at Western Kentucky and the other at Midway.\nMcDonald extensively volunteers with local children's organizations, among them his former elementary school, the Ronald McDonald House, and Cincinnati Children's Hospital. His Senior CLASS Award nomination additionally mentioned an episode during the aforementioned FISU America games. After one of Team USA's games, two Brazilian reporters sought an interview with him. When McDonald showed up for the interview, he noticed that the stool normally found in the room was absent. He excused himself and quickly returned with the stool, setting it up for the interview. According to Premier Sports Management, \"While this was a simple act of kindness, it is indicative of McDonald’s humility and helpfulness that is always on display.\""

Of the 50 horse and rider pairs to begin the competition, only 27 finished. Three horses died during the competition. \nThe fourth jump was a relatively novel obstacle: a jump over a hurdle into a pond. Of the 46 pairs remaining by that point in the competition, 28 had a fall of the horse or the rider at that obstacle. This included one of the equine fatalities, the American horse Slippery Slim. The International Equestrian Federation subsequently temporarily banned such jumps.\nCompetition format.\nThe team and individual eventing competitions used the same scores. Eventing consisted of a dressage test, a cross-country test, and a jumping test.\nThe dressage test was a 12 section test. The maximum time allotted was 13 minutes; points were deducted over that time. The maximum score was 400 points, though the results typically listed the difference between the score and that maximum (that is, a score of 250 would be listed as a \"loss of points\" of 150).\nThe 36 km cross-country test had five phases: (1) a 7 km road stretch; (2) a 4 km, 12 obstacle steeplechase; (3) a 15 km road stretch; (4) an 8 km, 35 obstacle cross-country course; and (5) a 2 km road stretch. Points could be lost for refusals or falls at the obstacles in the second a fourth phases, with three refusals at the same obstacle resulting in elimination. Points could also be lost if maximum time limits for each phase were exceeded; however, points could be gained instead if the pair finished the obstacle phases under the allotted time.\nThe jumping test featured 12 obstacles and had a time limit of 155 seconds. Points were lost for faults (including elimination for the third refusal on the course) and for exceeding the time limit.\nResults.\nStandings after cross-country.\nNo pair was over time on Stage A, so no points were lost in that phase."

Though the tournament was arranged by the NCAA it is not considered as part of the NCAA tournament and is displayed here for reference. This tournament had been used to determine the Division II tournament invitees but, with the majority of bids being submitted to the Division III tournament, the regional tournament was now used for this championship.\nNCAA Qualifiers.\nThe following teams qualified for the tournament. There were no automatic bids, however, conference tournament champions were given preferential consideration. No formal seeding was used while quarterfinal matches were arranged so that the road teams would have the shortest possible travel distances.\nFormat.\nThe tournament featured three rounds of play. In the Quarterfinals, teams played two-game aggregate series to determine which school advanced to the semifinals. Beginning with the semifinals all games became Single-game eliminations. The winning teams in the semifinals advanced to the National Championship Game with the losers playing in a Third Place game. The teams were seeded according to geographic proximity in the quarterfinals so the visiting team would have the shortest feasible distance to travel."

They finished the season 28–8 overall, tied for the ACC regular season title with a 12–2 record and made it to the Elite Eight of the 1983 NCAA Tournament. They were coached by Dean Smith in his twenty-second season as head coach of the Tar Heels. They played their home games at the Carmichael Auditorium in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.\nSummary.\nJordan frequently got into foul trouble early in his freshman year at North Carolina (1981–82). He frequently played the ends of games with four fouls.\nHe originally went by “Mike Jordan”, but media began using Michael in the middle of his freshman season at UNC. Late example of “Mike Jordan”: New York Times, UNC vs. St. John's, first game of 1982–83 season\nPLAYER PROFILE\nWhen Jordan's shooting touch was off, he would defer to teammates and concentrate more on his defense.\nGoing into the 1982–83 season, UNC lost starters James Worthy, who left for the NBA after his junior year, and Jimmy Black, a senior, from the previous season's national championship team. Sophomore Michael Jordan and junior Sam Perkins missed preseason practices due to injuries, only to return at the start of the regular season. As a result, North Carolina started the season with a record of 0–2 for the first time since 1919. UNC's record went to 3–3, dropping out of the national rankings, before going on an 18-game winning streak.\nConference regular season.\nTaking full advantage of the 19-foot three-point line, newly adopted by the Atlantic Coast Conference and other conferences around the country, Jim Braddock made 6 of 7 three-point attempts in the opening game of conference play in an 86–69 romp over Rutgers.\nJanuary 8, 1983 - 17-year-old freshman Brad Daugherty scored 15 points and grabbed nine rebounds.\nJanuary 15, 1983 - Lynwood Robinson transferred from UNC to Olive.\nJanuary 29, 1983 - Michael Jordan scored his college career-high of 39 points against Georgia Tech, shooting 11–16 from the field, 11–13 from the free throw line and 6 of 7 from the three-point stripe including a four-point play that broke a 45–45 tie and gave UNC the lead for good. Aside from Jordan and Perkins, the rest of the Tar Heels shot 3 of 22 from the floor.\nFebruary 5, 1983 - With its win over Furman, North Carolina runs its record to 20–3, giving UNC head coach Dean Smith his record 12th straight 20-win season (a record he had previously shared with Jerry Tarkanian).\nFebruary 10, 1983 - #1 UNC won 64–63 over #3 Virginia. Both teams struggled from the field, with UNC shooting a paltry 41%. The Tar Heels managed to claw back from a 16-point second half deficit. Michael Jordan led the way with 16 points and a key steal-and-stuff with four personal fouls on him at the end of the game. Ralph Sampson of Virginia had 15 points and 12 rebounds but also six turnovers. Buzz Peterson suffered a right knee injury and is expected to be out for the season.\nFebruary 13, 1983 - With a 30–21 rebounding advantage, Villanova (#12, 17–4) snapped UNC's 18-game winning streak and became only the fourth non-ACC opponent to defeat UNC at Carmichael Auditorium, and the first to do so since 1973.\nThe Tar Heels suffered a three-game losing streak, partly attributable to Michael Jordan's difficulties with foul trouble.\nFebruary 27, 1983 - UNC's record against Clemson at Chapel Hill goes to 30–0 with another victory.\nMarch 5, 1983 - In its regular season finale against Duke, UNC pounded the ball hard inside, making 57 percent of its shots from the floor, and 12 of 15 three-point baskets, in what turned into a three-point shootout. Michael Jordan scored 32 points in each game against Duke.\nMarch 11, 1983 - UNC was led by Michael Jordan and Matt Doherty (career high 28 points) as the Tar Heels connected on 14 of 24 three-point shots to easily advance 105–79 over Clemson in the ACC Tournament.\nMarch 12, 1983 - Michael Jordan fouled out of the close contest with 3:42 remaining in regulation. NC State got a 70–65 lead with 2:57 remaining, but did not score again, and UNC came back to tie it before the buzzer. Dereck Whittenburg carried the scoring load for the Wolfpack in overtime.

        "text": "The 1964–65 Michigan Tech Huskies men's ice hockey team represented Michigan Tech University in college ice hockey. In its 9th year under head coach John MacInnes the team compiled a 24–5–1 record and reached the NCAA tournament for the fourth time in its history. The Huskies defeated Boston College 8–2 in the championship game at the Meehan Auditorium in Providence, Rhode Island.\nSeason.\nWith the last remnants of their first national championship team having graduated over the summer, John MacInnes moved Michigan Tech into a new era. With only six returning players from the year before, the Huskies were one of the least-experienced teams in the country (at last as far as college hockey) but the 1963 recruiting class would turn out to one of the best in history. With two good sophomore goaltenders to choose from, MacInnes decided to platoon his two netminders, allowing them to share the starting role and keep them well-rested throughout the season. With virtually no senior leadership on the team (both seniors were depth-players) all three captain roles were taken by juniors.\nMichigan Tech began their season at home against Waterloo Lutheran (now called Wilfrid Laurier), winning both games easily, before travelling to Ontario to take on two senior teams and came away with two wins despite a scare in the second match. At the beginning of December MTU opened their conference schedule against North Dakota, taking both games against the Fighting Sioux and pushing their record to 6–0. Two weeks later the Huskies travelled to Grand Forks where UND repaid the favor by winning both of their home games to tie the two teams in the WCHA standings.\nAfter the winter break Michigan Tech returned to the ice with pair of series against Minnesota–Duluth beginning with a road trip to Duluth. The Bulldog had been improving since becoming a top-tier program in 1961, producing their first winning campaign this season, but they were unable to stop the Huskies in any of the four games. The scored for all the matches were fairly close but MTU returned to their conference schedule with a 10–2 record, looking for a chance to head back to the NCAA Tournament.\nMichigan Tech began a two-week road trip against Minnesota, splitting the series with the Golden Gophers, and ended by taking three points against last season's Runner-Up, Denver. MTU finished out the month of January at home against Michigan, but could only manage a split against the defending national champions. With a pedestrian 5–4–1 WCHA record Michigan Tech was in danger of dropping out of conference playoff contention and unless they finished in the top four in the conference they wouldn't have the change to make the NCAA Tournament.\nMTU opened February with their 17th annual Winter Carnival, hosting Colorado College and winning two very important games. The next week they played host to Denver, who were themselves in danger of missing the WCHA Tournament, and earned a split with the Pioneers. Michigan Tech ended their regular season with another two-week road trip, playing both Michigan and Michigan State. While there was a chance that the Huskies could have been pushed out of the playoff picture at the outset, the Huskies took both games against the Spartans to guarantee themselves a postseason berth. While North Dakota was too far in front for them to catch, Michigan Tech could still gain home ice in the first round of the WCHA Tournament and with two wins against the Wolverines that's exactly what they did.\nMichigan Tech opened their conference tournament against Minnesota with a 8–4 win, putting their opponents in a deep hole. The Huskies played safer in the second match, holding the Golden Gophers to 3 goals to earn a tie and win the total-goal series 11–7. The WCHA had changed the tournament schedule that year to have the championship game the week after the First Round rather than the day after. The extra time allowed Michigan Tech to rest and not have to rush 500 miles overnight so when they took on the Fighting Sioux they were ready for the fifth meeting between the two and were able to constrain one of the top offenses in the country to 4 goals while scoring s times themselves to win their second WCHA championship. Because the WCHA would change the playoff format the following season, Michigan Tech was the last solitary tournament champion for twelve seasons and were the last program to win the MacNaughton Cup as the postseason champion (the trophy would revert to a regular season championship trophy in 1966).\nAs the WCHA Champion Michigan Tech was given the top western seed and opened the 1965 NCAA Tournament as the home team despite playing in the home building of their opponent, Brown. The Huskies didn't give the partisan crowd much to cheer about, scoring twice in the first while holding the Bears to 8 shots. Rick Best held Brown scoreless for the entire game, earning the first ever shutout in tournament history while Senior Fred Dart scored twice to send MTU to their fourth championship game. Despite the shutout, MacInnes continued his goaltender rotation and put future Hall of Famer Tony Esposito in net against ECAC champion Boston College and, while Tony O kept BC off the scoresheet until late in the second, the Huskies as a whole were more than a match for the Eagles. Michigan Tech set a new championship record by scoring the first six goals of the game, a mark that has only been equaled one other time (by Michigan Tech in 1975) as of 2018. Five players combined for the six goals with only tournament MOP Gary Milroy scoring twice. BC's first goal came on a 5-on-3 power play but the game was in hand by that point and the two teams played out the final period without too much fanfare as MTU won the national championship.\nDue to their thoroughly dominating performance in the two games, Michigan Tech tied a record by placing five players on the All-Tournament first team: Tony Esposito, Dennis Huculak, Pete Leiman, Gary Milroy and Wayne Weller. Only Esposito was named to AHCA All-American West Team and the All-WCHA First Team while Huculak and Milroy made the WCHA Second Team. Milroy finished second on the team in scoring, behind fellow sophomore Wayne Weller, and was named as the WCHA Sophomore of the Year.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

He also was a member of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in the Canadian Football League (CFL). He played college football at Auburn University.\nEarly years.\nBlake attended Lincoln County High School, where he played defensive tackle. His brother Ricky Blake was one of his teammates. \nHe enrolled at Northwest Mississippi Community College. He played offensive tackle and was a two-time first-team J.C. Gridwire. He transferred to Auburn University after his sophomore season.\nHe played mostly at offensive guard, switching to defensive tackle in short-yardage situations. He was the first Auburn two-way player in 14 years. He received All-SEC honors as a senior.\nProfessional career.\nBlake was selected by the Miami Dolphins in the second round (43rd overall) of the 1992 NFL Draft. Although he was mostly an offensive lineman in college, he was drafted with the intention of converting him into a nose tackle for the Dolphins' 3-4 defense. He suffered a broken bone in his left foot by dropping a 45-pound weight in April before the NFL Draft. He was placed on the physically unable to perform list on July 19, 1992. He was waived on August 26 and placed on the injured reserve list.

While the Saturn version was largely ignored by reviewers, The Rookie found it more enjoyable than the PlayStation version, citing better control, though he still advised gamers to hold out for \"World Series Baseball '98\" instead. He scored it higher than the PlayStation version in control and fun factor, and equal in graphics and sound."

        "text": "The 2018 UST Growling Tigers men's basketball team represented University of Santo Tomas in the 81st season of the University Athletic Association of the Philippines. The men's basketball tournament for the school year 2018-19 began on September 8, 2018, and the host school for the season was National University.\nThe Tigers finished sixth at the end of the double round-robin eliminations with 5 games and 9 losses. UST at one point during the second round was at fourth place in the standings, but they went on to lose all four of their remaining games and crashed out of the Final Four matches.\nThey had an average losing margin of 21.0 points and an average winning margin of 9.8 points.\nTwo of the Growling Tigers' opponents gave them blowout losses in both rounds of the eliminations. The Ateneo Blue Eagles won over them by 32 and 40 points in each round, while the De La Salle Green Archers won by 27 and 41 points.\nThe 41-point loss to La Salle was the worst in the career of Aldin Ayo, the one-time back-to-back NCAA and UAAP champion coach.\nReturning fourth year point guard Renzo Subido was chosen Player of the Week by the UAAP Press Corps in the first round of eliminations for the duration of September 12–16, while rookie CJ Cansino received the citation twice on the weeks of October 10–14 and October 24–28.\nCansino, the Season 80 Juniors MVP also made history when he became the first rookie to score a triple-double since UAAP statistics were first officially recorded in 2003. Against the UE Red Warriors in the second round, Cansino tallied 20 points, 14 rebounds, and 10 assists.\nThe Growling Tigers also recorded a single-game league best 59 rebounds in their opening game on September 8, 2018, against the NU Bulldogs.\nRoster changes.\nOnly big man Jeepy Faundo has graduated, but the team experienced an exodus of players before the start of the UAAP season.\nRegie Boy Basibas, who had suited up for the Tigers in their preseason games, and Joco Macasaet, their veteran center, were both faced with uncertainties regarding the league's age eligibility rules as both players were turning 25 within the school year. Both of them decided to move on from the team to play in the commercial leagues.\nJordan Sta. Ana also played in the preseason, but decided to go on leave due to personal reasons. He later announced his transfer to Letran.\nThe official lineup for UST's Season 81 campaign consisted of nine new players (eight rookies, one transferee), four holdovers and two returnees.\nWith a champion coach tapped to handle the team, analysts have stressed how the team is still in a rebuilding phase and have once again predicted UST to miss out on a Final Four finish.\nCoaching changes.\nAldin Ayo replaced Boy Sablan as head coach on January 11, 2018. The coaching change was announced by Institute of Physical Education and Athletics (IPEA) director Fr. Jannel Abogado following Sablan's resignation on November 20, 2017, together with his entire coaching staff.\nAyo, a former player of the 1998 and 1999 NCAA champion Letran Knights came into coaching prominence after leading the Knights to the 2015 championship on his first year and duplicating the feat when he jumped over to the UAAP to lead La Salle to the 2016 championship. At the end of Season 80, he made a decision to sign with UST where he will coach the men's basketball team for the next six years.\nCoaching Staff.\nAppointed as Ayo's deputies were McJour Luib, Kristoffer Co, Bonnie Garcia, Randy Alcantara, Jason Misolas, Nap Garcia, Ruden de Vera, Philip Go, Marvin Pangilinan, and Noel Zorilla.\nSchedule and results.\nPreseason tournaments.\nThe Filoil Preseason Cup games were aired on 5 Plus and ESPN 5. The UCBL games were aired on Solar Sports.\nUAAP games.\nElimination games were played in a double round-robin format and all of UST's games were televised on ABS-CBN Sports and Action and Liga.\nUAAP Statistics.\nSource: Imperium Technology"

        "title": "Bob Mitchell (baseball)",
        "text": "Bob Mitchell (November 12, 1932 – June 12, 2019) was an American pitcher who played in Negro league baseball.\nBiography.\nBorn and raised in West Palm Beach, Florida, Mitchell was fascinated with baseball since he was an 11-year-old while watching the all-black West Palm Beach Yankees club, often through knotholes in the grandstand or earning a close-up look by selling peanuts. In his spare time, he swatted tennis balls with broom handles or just tuned his fastball tossing rocks at targets on train tracks.\nMitchell graduated from Roosevelt High School in 1951. Though he had an interest in writing, his main motivation was to play baseball. The same year, he won a spot with his beloved West Palm Beach team in the Florida Negro League. In 1952, he pitched for the Florida Cubans based in Lakeland, Florida, home field and training center of the major league Detroit Tigers. Mitchell spent two seasons with the team, including a showdown with the Kansas City Monarchs and a highly touted prospect named Ernie Banks. After the game, Mitchell was approached by the Monarchs manager Buck O'Neil, who showed interest in his pitching abilities. Mitchell then was invited to throw batting practice to the Monarchs and earned a contract to join the team, which had a strong pitching staff featuring the legendary Satchel Paige.\nMitchell debuted with the Monarchs in 1954 and made his first appearance against the Indianapolis Clowns, in which he threw his fastball and his curveball. That was the first start of his four-year career with the Kansas City club. In 1956, Mitchell asked the then manager Jelly Taylor to let him pitch the game that evening in Canada, something pitchers did not do. He pitched a complete game victory while striking out 13 batters in his nine innings of work. He finished his Negro American League career with a 30-14 record.\nMitchell retired in 1957 and married his pregnant fiancéé. He then worked for Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft United Technologies from 1964 to 1993.\nYMitchell never forgot his former Negro league ballplayers, becoming an advocate for those men whose careers in the Negro leagues did not pave the way for inclusion into organized baseball. In 1993, he successfully lobbied Major League Baseball for a pension plan for black players who were excluded after 1947, the year Jackie Robinson integrated white baseball, getting about 85 players were granted an annual pension. While some MLB teams added black players to their rosters during the decade after Robinson's breakthrough, most only signed one or two black players at a time. Those actions denied most Negro leaguers the chance to show off their skills in the majors and also denied them the pensions afforded those players.\nMitchell continued the fight for those who continued playing in the Negro leagues ball after 1947. As a result, additional black players became eligible to receive supplementary financial assistance from MLB in 2004, including survivor benefits for widows and supplementary financial assistance. As of late 2003, 41 Negro leagues players were drawing the annual $10,000 pension while supplying health insurance for an additional 34 Negro leagues players and spouses, included in the separate 1993 deal.\nIn his third attempt to aid Negro leaguers, Mitchell managed to get MLB to finally decide that players on segregated black baseball teams in the late 1940s and 1950s were discriminated against because the so-called white leagues did not fully integrate until 1959.\nMitchell received his due recognition in 2008, when he was selected by the Arizona Diamondbacks in the MLB special draft of the surviving Negro league players. Hall of Fame Baseball player Dave Winfield hatched the idea to have this draft while MLB clubs each selected a former NLB player.\nMitchell settled in Tampa Bay, Florida and took an active role in teaching children the essentials of reading, writing, and arithmetic as well as moral values and the importance of faith. He died on June 12, 2019."

        "title": "Anthony Richardson (basketball)",
        "text": "Anthony Lamont Richardson (born July 29, 1983) is an American former professional basketball player. He was one of the top prospects of the high school class of 2001, being named North Carolina Mr. Basketball and a McDonald's All-American. He played 4 years of college basketball for the Florida State Seminoles, and went undrafted in the 2005 NBA draft. He then earned an all-star selection in the CBA and was named the 2007 USBL Player of the Year while also leading the league in scoring. He played 9 years of professional basketball in Germany, Japan, South Korea, the Netherlands and in the NBA D-League.\nHigh school career.\nRichardson is the son of Norman Primous and Mary Richardson, and was born and raised in Raleigh, North Carolina, where he attended Leesville Road High School. He played 4 years of varsity basketball at Leesville, where he was coached by Darryl Robinson; he gained national recognition during his senior year, when he contributed to lead the team to the 4A state championship game, which Leesville lost to Richard J. Reynolds High School 94–73. Richardson was ranked the no. 9 power forward and the no. 50 player in the nation by ESPN, while Bob Gibbons ranked him 18th overall, and 1st in the state of North Carolina. During his high school years he played both the power forward and the small forward positions.\nHe averaged 18 points, 9 rebounds and 3 assists per game in his senior season, and was named 2001 North Carolina Mr. Basketball. His successful senior year earned him a selection as a McDonald's All-American and in the \"Parade\" All-America Third Team. In the 2001 McDonald's game, which was played in Durham, North Carolina, he wore jersey number 45 (his usual 54 was taken by Kwame Brown) and he scored 10 points, shooting 4/10 from the field and 2/3 from the free throw line. He also played in another high school all-star game, the Capital Classic, where he scored 7 points (2/9 shooting, 3/4 on free throws).\nCollege career.\nRichardson was recruited by several NCAA Division I programs, and considered offers from Clemson, Florida State, NC State, East Carolina, Maryland and Wake Forest. He committed to Florida State in the fall of 2000, being the first player to commit for the Seminoles that year, and the sixth McDonald's All-American to sign for Florida State. After initially falling short on his SAT college admissions test, he qualified instead on the ACT. He was diagnosed with a learning disability, and his grades put his NCAA eligibility on the line: he had to follow additional summer courses in order to achieve the required grades, and in September 2001 the NCAA granted him full eligibility.\nRichardson chose to wear jersey number 54 (his high school number). Florida State's most decorated recruit since Randell Jackson in 1995, he found it difficult to live up to the pressure as a freshman. He played 27 games, averaging 18.3 minutes per game and posting averages of 7.1 points, 3.7 rebounds and 1 assist per game. He recorded a season-high 19 points against NC State on January 8, 2002. During the season he was once named ACC Rookie of the Week, and at the end of his first year he was selected as an All-ACC freshman team honorable mention, and he was also an All-ACC Academic Selection for his good grades.\nIn 2002 coach Steve Robinson left the Seminoles and was replaced by Leonard Hamilton, who decided to give Richardson a starting role in the team. As a result, Richardson saw his playing time increased to 29 minutes per game, and as a sophomore he recorded career-highs in all the major statistical categories with 12.4 points, 5.3 rebounds, 1.5 assists, 1.2 steals and 1.1 blocks. He also recorded a new single game high with 20 points (including 10/10 from the foul line) along with 9 rebounds against Georgia Tech on January 14, 2003. He was second in the team for scoring and rebounding behind Tim Pickett.\nHis junior year saw him starting the first 16 games of the season, and on December 1, 2003, he recorded a new career-high with 27 points on 10/13 shooting (4/5 on free throws) against Northwestern. He then lost his starting role and came off the bench for the rest of the season, averaging 7.3 points, 3.6 rebounds and 1 assist per game. As a senior he only started 8 games out of 29, recording his best shooting percentages but also career-lows in points, rebounds and assists per game.

He played 13 games with the team, averaging 11.5 points and 7.4 rebounds before transferring to the Reno Bighorns, where he ended the 2010–11 season starting 27 of 30 games played with averages of 14.3 points and 6.8 rebounds in 31.1 minutes per game. In 2011 Richardson moved outside the US again, this time joining Japanese team Aishin Sea Horses. In 41 games in the top tier of Japanese basketball he recorded 10 points, 5.1 rebounds and 1.4 blocks per contest, playing 19.4 minutes. After the season ended he went back to the Reno Bighorns in the NBA D-League, and briefly played for the team (6 games) after signing for the Fort Wayne Mad Ants where he ended the 2012–13 D-League season with overall averages of 13.3 points and 4.7 rebounds per game.\nIn 2013 he was selected in the first round of the Korean Basketball League draft by Busan KT Sonicboom. He was an all-star selection for the 2013–14 season, during which he played for two teams. He initially played for the Busan KT Sonicboom, where in 23 appearances he averaged 17.7 points, 5.4 rebounds, 2.4 assists and 1.1 blocks, and then signed for the Goyang Orions where he ended the season playing 33 more games, recording 14.2 points and 5.3 rebounds. During the 2014 all-star game in the KBL he won the slam dunk contest. His last professional experience was the 2014–15 KBL season, played with the Wonju DB Promy, where in 63 games he averaged 10.8 points, 3.7 rebounds and 1.2 assists in 15.5 minutes per game."

The tournament was held March 6–March 9 at Ford Center in Evansville, Indiana. Belmont won the championship, defeating UT Martin 59–53. Belmont's Jenny Roy was named tournament MVP.\nFormat.\nThe OVC women's tournament is a traditional single-elimination tournament featuring the top eight teams in the conference regular-season standings. This differs from the format used in the OVC men's tournament; while that tournament also involves only eight of the league's 12 members, it has a radically different format, consisting of two stepladder brackets that produce the tournament finalists. The women's tournament is seeded so that the #8 seed faces the #1 seed in the first round, #7 faces #2, and so on. There is no reseeding, so if the #8 team were to defeat the #1 seed it would continue in the tournament playing the team which would have faced the #1 seed in the subsequent round (winner of #4 vs. #5)."

Over 370 individuals have managed or co-managed a team in at least one match in the competition.\nStatistics and notable achievements.\nCarlos Alberto Parreira is the manager who has taken part in the most editions of the tournament, six from 1982 to 2010. Parreira also shares with Bora Milutinović the record for most different nations managed in the World Cup, with five. Helmut Schön holds the records for both most matches managed (25) and most matches won (16), all with West Germany in 1966–1978.\nTwenty-one managers have won the World Cup, with Vittorio Pozzo being the only one to do so twice, in 1934 and 1938 with Italy.\nThe first person who had the roles of both a player and a manager in the tournament is Milorad Arsenijević, who played for Yugoslavia in 1930 and then coached them in 1950. Three men who lifted the trophy as players went on to also triumph as managers: Brazil's Mário Zagallo in 1970, West Germany's Franz Beckenbauer in 1990 and France's Didier Deschamps in 2018.\nThe youngest manager to appear in the competition is Juan José Tramutola, who co-managed Argentina at age 27 in 1930, while the oldest is Otto Rehhagel, who was in charge of Greece at age 71 in 2010.\nWhile many of the participating nations have on one or more occasions employed foreign managers for the World Cup, the two teams with the most appearances, Brazil and Germany, have always been led by natives. On the other side of the spectrum, Ecuador is the team with the most participations always coached by foreigners – four, always with managers coming from fellow South American countries. No foreign manager has ever won the World Cup, and only two have reached the final match: George Raynor of England, with Sweden in 1958, and Ernst Happel of Austria, with the Netherlands in 1978.\nBy team.\nBelow, the teams are listed in decreasing order of number of appearances in the World Cup.\nGermany.\nIncluding West Germany (1954–1990).\nSerbia.\nIncluding Yugoslavia until 1990 and Serbia and Montenegro (FR Yugoslavia) in 1998–2006.\nRussia.\nIncluding Soviet Union until 1990.\nCzech Republic.\nIncluding Czechoslovakia until 1990.\nDR Congo.\nParticipated as Zaire in 1974.\nIndonesia.\nParticipated as Dutch East Indies in 1938.\nBy year.\nFlags indicate the managers' nationalities, while FIFA trigrammes indicate the teams they were in charge of.\nRecord appearances.\nThe below table lists the records of all managers who have appeared in either:\nKey: ; ; ; ; ; .\nAs per statistical convention in football, matches decided in extra time are counted as wins and losses, while matches decided by penalty shoot-outs are counted as draws."

Although the honorees generally do not compete together as a unit, the term is used in U.S. team sports to refer to players who are selected by members of the national media. Walter Camp selected the first All-America team in the early days of American football in 1889. The 2019 NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans are honorary lists that will include All-American selections from the Associated Press (AP), the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA), the \"Sporting News\" (TSN), and the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) for the 2018–19 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. All selectors choose three teams, while AP also lists honorable mention selections.\nThe Consensus 2019 College Basketball All-American team was determined by aggregating the results of the four major All-American teams as determined by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Since United Press International was replaced by TSN in 1997, the four major selectors have been the aforementioned ones. AP has been a selector since 1948, NABC since 1957 and USBWA since 1960. To earn \"consensus\" status, a player must win honors based on a point system computed from the four different all-America teams. The point system consists of three points for first team, two points for second team and one point for third team. No honorable mention or fourth team or lower are used in the computation. The top five totals plus ties are first team and the next five plus ties are second team.\nAlthough the aforementioned lists are used to determine consensus honors, there are numerous other All-American lists. The ten finalists for the John Wooden Award are described as Wooden All-Americans. The ten finalists for the Senior CLASS Award are described as Senior All-Americans. Other All-American lists include those determined by USA Today, Fox Sports, Yahoo! Sports and many others.

At this time, both Weber and Boise still played in small gymnasiums, while ISU's Minidome had about triple the seating capacity of the others; Boise State upset the host in the final.\nFor a second consecutive year, junior center Steve Hayes was named to the all-conference team, joined by junior forward Greg Griffin; junior guard Ed Thompson was on the second team. Hayes was a unanimous selection.\nPostseason results.\n!colspan=5 style=| Big Sky tournament"

The Red Foxes, led by third year head coach Matt Brady, played their home games at the McCann Center and were members of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference. The team captains were seniors Jared Jordan and Will Whittington. They finished the season 25–9 overall, 14–4 in MAAC play to finish in first place, winning the MAAC regular season championship. They advanced to the semifinals of the MAAC tournament where they lost to Siena. As a regular season conference champion who failed to win their conference tournament, they received an automatic bid to the 2007 National Invitation Tournament where they defeated Oklahoma State in the first round before falling to NC State in the second round. The season was also highlighted by wins over Big Ten Conference opponent Minnesota and Old Dominion, who had defeated eighth-ranked Georgetown two games prior.\nPreview.\nMarist entered the season having finished in third place in the MAAC the previous season. The team returned first team All-MAAC selection Jordan, and third team All-MAAC selection Whittington. Jordan led the NCAA in total assists with 247, and assists per game with 8.5, while Whittington was a prolific 3-point shooter. James Smith, a versatile 7' center, also returned for Marist. With the returning talent, Marist was the unanimous choice to win the conference title. Jordan was selected as the preseason MAAC player of the year, while Whittington was tabbed as a preseason All-MAAC first team selection.\nSchedule.\nThe team had a fast start to the season, getting off to a 14–4 mark, and 6–1 in conference play. They would lose three of their next four games, but finished the season on an eight-game winning streak. This enabled Marist to qualify for just their fourth post season appearance (2 NCAA and 1 NIT).\nMarist's first highlight of the season was a win over Big Ten member Minnesota in the inaugural Old Spice Classic on November 23. Despite playing SEC foe Arkansas close in the semifinals, the Razorbacks proved too tough down the stretch. Marist concluded the Old Spice Classic by defeating Western Michigan in the third place game. Jordan was named to the All-Tournament Team and selected as the MVP of the tournament. The team continued their highlights, defeating Old Dominion at home on November 29, 84–71. Old Dominion had defeated No. 8 ranked Georgetown just 10 days prior to this matchup. The final score was exactly the same as the previous season, although the Monarchs won that contest. Both teams ended the night with identical 5–2 records as well.\nOn February 24, Marist played their final MAAC game at home against their rival, the Siena Saints. Entering the contest, Marist was 13–4 in MAAC play, while Siena was 12–5. Niagara, who would play against Rider on Sunday afternoon, was also 12–5. There was a potential for a three-way tie for first place should Marist lose the game. The team would need a win to capture the outright MAAC regular season championship for the first time in school history. In a nationally televised game on ESPN2, and in front of a sellout crowd of 3,200, Marist defeated Siena 98–88 in overtime. Both games that the two teams played during the season had been overtime wins for Marist. They ended the regular season slate 23–7 overall, and 14–4 in the MAAC, and clinched the No. 1 seed in the MAAC tournament, while also setting the school mark for victories in a season (23).\nAs the No. 1 seed in the MAAC tournament in Bridgeport, Connecticut, they defeated No. 8 seed Canisius 87–63 in the quarterfinals. In the semifinals, they were matched up again with Siena, for the third time in the season. This time, Siena defeated Marist 86–78, and Siena moved on to the championship game. Because they finished the season as the No. 1 seed, and failed to win their conference tournament, they were an automatic selection to the NIT. In the first round, they were matched up to play at Oklahoma State in Stillwater, Oklahoma. Senior guard Will Whittington led Marist with 31 points, as Marist scored the upset, 67–64. It was the first postseason win in school history. Despite Whittington leading the Red Foxes with 18 points, Marist lost to NC State in the second round, 62–69 to end the season.\n!colspan=9 style=| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=|MAAC tournament\n!colspan=9 style=| 2007 NIT\nAwards &amp; milestones.\nMAAC Conference honors.\nThe following players/coaches earned Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference postseason recognition:\nSee also.\n2006–07 Marist Red Foxes women's basketball team"

        "text": "The men's 15 kilometre cross-country skiing competition at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, United States, was held on Sunday 17 February at the Mount Van Hoevenberg in Essex County, New York.\nFavourites.\nJózef Łuszczek of Poland was the 1978 World champion and Nikolay Bazhukov of the Soviet Union was the defending champion from the 1976 Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria.\nThe Race.\nEach skier started at half a minute intervals, skiing the entire 15 kilometre course. The race developed into the closest duel in the history of cross-country skiing. Thomas Wassberg of Sweden and Finnish veteran Juha Mieto fought a tight battle for the gold medal. Wassberg started last of the 63 participants, half a minute behind Norwegian Ove Aunli. Mieto, wearing bib 54, started half a minute behind the reigning world champion at the distance, Polish skier Józef Łuszczek.\nWassberg started fast, and at the 5 km mark he had caught Aunli by 30 seconds and was in the lead, three seconds ahead of Mieto. Łuszczek also had a strong opener, only ten seconds behind the leader, closely followed by the 19-year old West German Jochen Behle and the 30 km winner Nikolay Zimyatov. At 10 km Wassberg had increased his lead to 4.8 seconds. Mieto, still in second place, had almost caught Łuszczek, starting half a minute in front of him, but the Pole was still in third place, now 30 seconds behind Wassberg. Aunli had been able to adjust his speed by following Wassberg and advanced from 13th to fifth place. Only two seconds separated the four fastest skiers behind Wassberg and Mieto 5 km from home. Behle had dropped down to ninth at 10 km and was out of contention for the medals.\nJuha Mieto passed Łuszczek and left him behind before crossing the finish line in 41:57.64, beating Zimyatov's time by 36 seconds. Thomas Wassberg, still skiing together with Aunli, was told 500 m from home that he had a one second lead over Mieto, and, fighting desperately, crossed the finish line in 41:57.63. He won the race by the closest possible margin, one hundredth of a second. Aunli secured the bronze medal for Norway, beating Zimyatov by 5 seconds.\nAftermath.\nWassberg proposed to Mieto that they could cut their medals in two parts and then melt them together as a mixed gold-silver medal. Mieto politely thanked him, but said no to the idea, and ended the 1980 season by winning the unofficial Cross-Country World Cup for the second consecutive time. The International Ski Federation (FIS) decided shortly after the 1980 Olympics that all times in cross-country races would henceforth be rounded to the nearest tenth of a second."

        "title": "Project Reset (Welsh Rugby Union reform)",
        "text": "Project Reset is a proposed Welsh Rugby Union reform programme to restructure Welsh regional rugby. Recent years have indicated both regional and club rugby in Wales is in financial crisis, with sides such as Neath RFC closely defeating a liquidation order and Ospreys at risk of losing key players in 2019 and the 2019/20 season ahead.\nA number of proposals are reportedly being mooted by the Union to reestablish Welsh rugby union as a competitor for nearby rivals such as the Irish Rugby Football Union and English Rugby Football Union whose sides have seen financial growth and test match success.\nThe Professional Rugby Board is reported to have concluded that the Ospreys and Scarlets should merge to form a west Wales super team in the pro 14, making room for a north Wales team affiliated to RGC 1404.\nBackground.\nRugby union in Wales is the national sport and is considered a large part of national culture. The sport is today managed by the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) which formed in 1881. The main domestic competition in Wales is the Pro14, in which Wales have four regional sides in the competition: Ospreys, Cardiff Blues, Scarlets and Dragons. The sides also compete in the Europe-wide European Rugby Champions Cup, European Rugby Challenge Cup, and Anglo-Welsh Cup.\nSince the regionalisation of professional Rugby Union in Wales, the national team has undoubtedly experienced great success, with some attributing this to the regional concept. The regions have been reasonably successful in the Pro12 (renamed Pro14 from 2017–18 forward), with Welsh teams winning on six occasions. The Ospreys are one of the most successful team in the history of the league with four titles (just short of the record five titles held by Leinster as of 2018). However, the Welsh sides have made little impact in the European Cup, with no team getting further than the semi-finals. A desire for success in Europe had been one of the principal reasons for setting up the regions in the first place.\n2013 dispute.\nThe regions currently operate on a 2009 Participation Agreement which expires in 2019.\nThe regions in 2013 protested against a new agreement, as they felt it did not offer any funding commitments or clarity regarding competitions such as the Heineken Cup. The Union retorted that funding would increase but that regions would need to commit to the framework or risk losing their revenue streams.\n2018 rumoured solutions.\nIn 2018 the WRU launched Project Reset to review regional arrangements. Faced with the financial dominance of French Top 14 and English Premiership Rugby sides, the WRU have in recent years increased salaries to bring Welsh international players such as Taulupe Faletau, Dan Biggar, Ross Moriarty, and Rhys Webb back into the Welsh league system. Yet the Union now feel the salary arrangements are unsustainable.\nThe WRU has established a Professional Rugby Board, composed of representatives from both the WRU and the regions, to discuss the proposed changes.\nProposal 1 - Merge Scarlets/Ospreys and Blues/Dragons.\nUnder one proposal, the region system would decrease from four sides to two. Ospreys and the Scarlets would merge, as would Cardiff Blues and Dragons. Such proposals face widespread opposition from sections of supporters whose local loyalties would prevent them from travelling to traditionally 'rival' grounds to follow their team, standing in the terraces with their bitter rivals. Opponents of the proposal have also pointed to the struggles of the Scottish rugby union team in test fixtures since switching to a two-region model dominated by Edinburgh and Glasgow Warriors.\nProposal 2 - End the Dragons franchise or move it to North Wales.\nAs the poorest performing franchise, the WRU have reportedly discussed moving the Dragons franchise to North Wales, or closing it altogether. This would be challenging given the side's contractual commitments, and its guarantees to ground share at Rodney Parade with Newport RFC and EFL League Two side Newport County A.F.C. until 2021. The WRU have proposed the resulting space then be filled by a North Wales side taking the place of Conwy-based, semi professional RGC 1404.\nIn recent years Dragons have improved their attendances however, so such a move is considered highly controversial and financially ineffective. The WRU nonetheless own both the team and the ground, so have strong control over the franchise's future.\nA regional rugby franchise, originally known as \"Rygbi Gogledd Cymru\" (Welsh language for \"Rugby North Wales\") and later known as RGC 1404, was established in North Wales; plans called for the side to enter the Welsh Premier Division as early as 2010–11 and eventually the Celtic League/Pro12, but the venture was unsuccessful and was liquidated in 2011. The team, however, continues to play as part of Wales' national rugby academy. RGC 1404 also had a partnership with Rugby Canada by which the franchise would have a secondary role of developing players for the Canada national rugby union team, at least until enough local players were developed to fill a complete competitive squad.\nProposal 3 - Merge Cardiff Blues and Ospreys.\nAs the most successful side in Pro14 (previously Celtic League) history, Ospreys now face significant issues, with reports of debts and stalled contract negotiations threatening their claim to players such as Alun Wyn Jones and head coach Allen Clarke. Managing director Andrew Millward had described the struggle, involving year long budget cuts and structural flaws in the Welsh rugby system, as leaving Wales unable to compete with rivals IRFU and FRR.\nFacing a merger with Cardiff Blues however, Ospreys supporters have pushed back, arguing that the removal of the Ospreys franchise from the Swansea region would leave one of Wales' rugby heartlands without a local region side, instead forced to travel to their rivals ground at Cardiff Arms Park.\nBlues supporters also point to the fierce battle their side won to remain in their traditional Cardiff RFC colours and name back in 2003, and are unwilling to adopt a new identity.\nProposal 4 - Merge Ospreys and Scarlets.\nMore recent discussions have punted merging western sides Scarlets and Ospreys, with the Llanelli and Swansea teams either sharing grounds or moving fully. Scarlets opposed such a merger with Ospreys back in 2003, with the late Stuart Gallacher famously opposed to any arrangement which would have ended the Scarlets name.\nA report by the BBC indicated that the Professional Rugby Board concluded the Ospreys and Scarlets should merge, to play as early as next season (2019-20). The Irish Times report that it was agreed that current players contracts will be honoured, with Scarlets head coach Brad Mooar and Ospreys boss Allen Clarke serving in coaching roles at the new side. Venues would be split, with Guinness Pro 14 fixtures played at Parc y Scarlets in Llanelli, European games at Swansea’s Liberty Stadium, and the Ospreys Llandarcy training ground as the chosen training site. Formation of a north Wales Pro 14 side would then be possible.\nResult.\nAs of 6 March 2019, a statement by Scarlets indicated that the talks to merge with Ospreys had broken down, with the Llanelli side no longer interested in the deal. As a result, the PRB will continue its discussions of all options."

Cofield said of his decision: \"The young man had to be taught a lesson. While we may have had a shot at postseason play, the basketball program at Wisconsin is more important than whether we win or lose a game.\""

He helped the team achieve a 10–0 regular season record and reach the state's 4A playoff semifinals.\nHe was a highly recruited football player in Alabama, but his grades didn't meet the NCAA's standards to receive a scholarship.\nCollege career.\nStewart enrolled at Ferrum College to improve his grades. He was the team's leading rusher as a freshman, transferring at the end of the season to Auburn University.\nAs a sophomore, he didn't see much action in a team that had future NFL players Bo Jackson, Brent Fullwood, Tommie Agee and Tim Jessie at the running back position. As a junior, although he was listed as the third-string running back behind Jackson and Fullwood, he was used predominantly as a blocker, registering 37 carries for 199 yards and one touchdown.\nIn 1986, because of the talent level at the running back position, he was tried briefly at linebacker, before being redshirted to extend his college eligibility.\nAs a redshirt senior, the starter James Joseph cracked his left kneecap in September, opening the door for Stewart to be one of the players employed in a running back by committee approach. He was fifth on the team with 54 carries for 181 yards and 2 touchdowns. He scored 2 rushing touchdowns against Vanderbilt University. He finished his college career with 92 carries for 383 yards and 3 touchdowns.\nProfessional career.\nOn February 3, Stewart was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Chicago Bears after the 1988 NFL Draft, to be used as a fullback. He was placed on the injured reserve list on August 23. He was released on September 4, 1989.\nIn October 1989, he was signed to the Dallas Cowboys' practice squad. On November 21, he was promoted to the active roster. He wasn't re-signed after the season.\nCoaching career and death.\nIn 1992, Stewart was named a volunteer assistant coach and strength coach at Jefferson Davis High School, contributing to the team winning a state championship in 1996. On July 3, he died from injuries suffered in a traffic accident on U.S. Route 80, between Selma and Montgomery."

        "title": "2016 UST Growling Tigers basketball team",
        "text": "The 2016 UST Growling Tigers men's basketball team represented University of Santo Tomas in the 79th season of the University Athletic Association of the Philippines. The men's basketball tournament for the school year 2016–17 began on September 4, 2016, and the host school for the season was also UST.\nThe Tigers finished eighth and last at the end of the double round-robin eliminations, winning three games against eleven losses. It was the most number of losses in a season for the Growling Tigers since the Final Four format began in 1993.\nThey had an average winning margin of 3.7 points and an average losing margin of 16.2 points. Three of their losses were by blowouts, once to the Adamson Falcons in the first round by 27 points, and twice to the De La Salle Green Archers by 38 and 43 points respectively.\nSecond-year guard Marvin Lee was chosen Player of the Week by the UAAP Press Corps in the second round of eliminations for the duration of October 12–16.\nCoaching changes.\nBoy Sablan replaced Bong dela Cruz as the Tigers' head coach following controversies surrounding the latter. Almost two months after falling short of winning the championship against the FEU Tamaraws in Season 78's Finals series, Dela Cruz became the subject of an administrative investigation stemming from complaints of physical and verbal abuse that he allegedly made against some of the players in the roster.\nShort of calling it a preventive suspension, the Institute of Physical Education and Athletics (IPEA) has ordered the coach to recuse himself from team activities until a decision on his tenure was reached based on would-be findings from the investigations. As a result, Dela Cruz stopped attending team practices beginning January 25, 2016.\nRumors surfaced that former Growling Tiger Bal David was among those who were being considered to replace Dela Cruz, but eventually, it was Sablan who was selected to be the new coach in late May where he signed a one-year contract for the upcoming Season 79 basketball tournament.\nSablan was a Glowing Goldies teammate of former coach Pido Jarencio in the 1980s and also served as one of his deputies from 2006 until 2013.\nCoaching staff.\nAppointed as Sablan's deputies were Tylon Dar Juan, Bam Ledesma, Gina Francisco, Patrick Fran, Rabbi Tomacruz, John Aquino, and Kris Anthony Agarao.\nIneligibility issues.\nBefore the start of the season, the UAAP came out with a new ruling that would lower the age limit of student-athletes from the previously accepted 25 years to 24 years. This would mean that two of the three graduating Growling Tigers would be considered over aged for the upcoming UAAP tournament. Team captain Louie Vigil, Fil-Canadian point guard Jon Sheriff and forward Kent Lao were on their final playing year in the Tigers roster, but only Vigil and Sheriff would be affected by the new rule. Sheriff turned 25 on July 31, while Vigil would be the same age on September 26.\nVigil was already considering signing up for the PBA rookie draft in October when the UAAP decided to defer implementation of the said rule. Protests lodged by concerned schools and affected athletes were instrumental in the reversion of the age eligibility rules. This was announced after the UAAP board of trustees convened in their annual planning session in Spain.\nInjuries.\nMario Bonleon suffered a season-ending wrist injury during their September 14 game against La Salle in the first round of eliminations.\nSchedule and results.\nUAAP games.\nElimination games were played in a double round-robin format and all of UST's games were televised on ABS-CBN Sports and Action and Balls.\nUAAP statistics.\nSource: HumbleBola\nAftermath.\nReeling from one of their worst finishes in the UAAP, the UST faithful were eagerly awaiting Steve Akomo's completion of his residency so that he can finally suit up for the Tigers and lead them back to their winning ways. The Cameroonian center has proven to be a reliable reinforcement when he led the University of the Visayas to the CESAFI Finals in 2012 against Ben Mbala who was then playing for Southwestern University.\nDuring the Adamson–UST postgame interview at the MOA Arena last November 9, UST Coach Boy Sablan introduced Akomo to the press as the go-to guy for the Tigers alongside Joco Macasaet, Zach Huang and Regie Boy Basibas in their UAAP campaign for the next season. Macasaet, Huang, and Basibas, who were all in their second playing year, started the game for UST against the Falcons, while the veteran group of Louie Vigil, Kent Lao, Marvin Lee and Renzo Subido were benched, allegedly for disciplinary reasons. Sablan justified the action by saying that he was giving the fans a preview of the Tigers' future brand of basketball, in reference to the trio and Akomo.\nFormer head coach Pido Jarencio, who gave the Tigers the 2006 UAAP title and a back-to-back Finals appearances in 2012 and 2013 had indirectly given the UST community a glimmer of hope when he sent out a controversial tweet from his social media account on December 6. The message reads, \"I am just a call away,\" and a follow-up tweet had Jarencio exclaiming, \"let's bring back the glory!\"\nFans were quick to attribute his messages to the dismal performance of the team in the tournament, which was quite the opposite of their Finals run the previous year. Jarencio later confirmed in interviews that he was actually willing to come back to coach the team on two conditions, \"if the position for head coach became vacant and if the management,\" and \"if the UST community wanted him back.\" Jarencio resigned as UST's head coach in January 2014 in exchange for a coaching job in the PBA.\nOn May 4, Renzo Subido announced on Twitter his plan to skip the upcoming Season 80 tournament. He explained how he was dissatisfied with the way that he has played during the course of his three-year college career. He also added that he planned to join the PBA D-League where he was hoping to improve his skills. A week later, Mario Bonleon made a similar tweet about taking time off from the team. On May 11, he had cited experiencing burnout as one of the reasons for wanting to leave the team. He also expressed his intention to join a D-League team during his time away from the Tigers.\nThe Growling Tigers joined the 2017 Filoil Flying V Preseason Premier Cup in the summer, but failed to make it past the elimination round compiling only a single win against seven losses. This was highlighted by a 39-point loss to the Lyceum Pirates. Because of the Tigers' poor showing, various reports began to circulate about some players' growing dissatisfaction with their head coach, which resulted to speculations that Sablan was on his way out as the team's chief tactician.\nSablan, whose one-year contract expired on May 31, 2017, denied rumors of his replacement, pointing out that there was not much time left for a new coach to prepare the team in time for the September 9 tournament opening. Dar Juan and incoming team captain Marvin Lee have also come out to Sablan's defense. Lee denied the report that some of his teammates wanted to leave the team by explaining that the players were given permission by the coaching staff to go on leave. He was referring to Regie Boy Basibas, Zach Huang, and Joco Macasaet who were all absent during the game against the San Beda Red Lions. Dar Juan, on the other hand told reporters that Sablan was not in physical shape to coach the team after going through surgery, but added that the head coach was actually present during the May 21 game against the Letran Knights. Sablan had undergone surgery on his gallbladder on May 15 and was unable to coach the team during the tournament. Assistant coaches Tylon Dar Juan and Bam Ledesma took over practices and coaching duties.\nAccording to a tweet from former Varsitarian sports editor Alex Cerado on June 20, Sablan's contract has been renewed for another year.\nPlayers drafted into the PBA.\nLouie Vigil was picked 17th overall in the second round of the 2017 PBA draft by the Leo Austria-led San Miguel Beermen on October 29, 2017. Kent Lao, meanwhile applied for the draft the following year and was selected in the third round by the Caloy Garcia-coached Rain or Shine Elasto Painters as the 30th overall pick in the 2018 PBA draft on December 16, 2018."

Xavier Marshall was also named in the United States' squad, having previously played 37 international matches for the West Indies cricket team.\nThe United Arab Emirates retained Mohammad Naveed as the captain of the team, after their regular captain, Rohan Mustafa, had previously been suspended. Mustafa returned to the squad, along with Ahmed Raza and Rameez Shahzad, who had also previously been suspended.\nThe United Arab Emirates won the T20I series 1–0, after the first game finished as a no result due to rain.\nFollowing the T20I matches, the United States played seven 50-over matches against the UAE, a UAE XI team and Lancashire County Cricket Club. The latter match was the first fixture between the two teams. It was also the first time an American cricket team had played Lancashire since the Philadelphian cricket team toured England in 1903, when they played at Old Trafford.

        "text": "The 2021 Women's Cricket World Cup Qualifier was an international women's cricket tournament that was held in Zimbabwe in November and December 2021. The tournament was the final part of the qualification process for the 2022 Women's Cricket World Cup. All of the regional qualification tournaments used the Women's Twenty20 International format. The tournament was the fifth edition of the World Cup Qualifier, with the fixtures played as 50 overs matches. Originally, the top three teams from the qualifier would have progressed to the 2022 Women's Cricket World Cup in New Zealand. The top three teams, along with the next two best placed teams, also qualified for the next cycle of the ICC Women's Championship.\nOriginally, the qualifier was scheduled to take place in Sri Lanka from 3 to 19 July 2020. In March 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the International Cricket Council (ICC) confirmed that they were reviewing the scheduling of the tournament. On 12 May 2020, the ICC confirmed that the tournament had been postponed. In December 2020, the ICC confirmed that the qualifier would be played during June and July 2021. In April 2021, the ICC postponed the tournament to November and December 2021. In August 2021, the ICC confirmed the dates for the tournament, and that it would be played in Zimbabwe. The full schedule for the tournament was announced in November 2021. The ten teams were placed into two groups of five, with the top three teams from each group advancing to the Super Six stage of the tournament.\nOn 8 November 2021, Papua New Guinea announced that they had been forced to withdraw due to several players recording positive tests for COVID-19. On 10 November, the ICC confirmed that there would be no replacement team for Papua New Guinea, with Group A reduced to four teams. In late November 2021, a new variant of the COVID-19 virus was discovered in southern Africa, with Cricket Ireland issued a statement saying they were monitoring the situation. Prior to the discovery of the new variant, three members of the Sri Lankan team had tested positive for COVID-19. Their scheduled match against the West Indies, due to take place on 27 November 2021, was cancelled after seven members of the Sri Lankan team tested positive.\nLater the same day, the ICC announced that the qualifier tournament had been called off, due to concerns of the new COVID variant and travel restrictions. Per the ICC's playing conditions, the qualification slots were based on the team's ODI rankings, therefore Bangladesh, Pakistan and the West Indies progressed to the 2022 Women's Cricket World Cup, with Sri Lanka and Ireland qualifying for the next ICC Women's Championship. This decision meant that the other teams at the tournament were ineligible for World Cup or Women's Championship qualification, as the ICC only grants ODI status to full members, and as such they are not included in the ODI rankings. The decision was seen as controversial, given that at the point the tournament was abandoned, Thailand, an Associate team, had been leading their group and were already guaranteed a spot in the Super Six stage with two points carried forward, but were not allowed to qualify for the World Cup or even the Women's Championship, a circumstance that at least one online cricket publication described as cruel. As a result, Thailand became the first team since the creation of the qualifiers in 2003 to win at least 3 of their first 4 matches without ultimately qualifying for the World Cup, as well as the second team since ODI status began to be offered in 2011 to win at least 3 matches overall without ultimately gaining ODI or Women's Championship status.\nStatus of matches.\nIn September 2018, ICC chief executive Dave Richardson announced that all matches at ICC World Cup Qualifiers would be awarded One Day International (ODI) status. However, in November 2021, the ICC reversed this decision, and determined that all fixtures in the Women's World Cup Qualifier featuring a team without ODI status would be recorded as a List A match. This followed an announcement retrospectively applying first-class and List A status to women's cricket.\nQualification.\nThe following teams qualified for the tournament:\nPapua New Guinea withdrew from the qualifier due to positive COVID-19 tests within the squad.\nSquads.\nThe following teams and squads were announced for the tournament. Players marked with an * were named as reserves in their respective sides."

The union is the constituent body of the Rugby Football Union (RFU) for Essex, and administers and organises rugby union clubs and competitions in the county.

The first recorded match played by an Essex representative team was actually held a year before the union was created, when they lost to a representative team from neighbouring Suffolk at Chelmsford in 1884. In December 1890 Essex would join with Suffolk and Norfolk to form the Eastern Counties Rugby Union, with Cambridgeshire joining later in 1920 and would participate in the County Championship. Essex would try and leave the Eastern Counties and gain constituent body status but were refused by the Rugby Football Union three times in 1972, 1975 and 1977. Finally in 2003 the county were awarded full status and would compete in the County Championship as an Essex side.\nSenior county team.\nThe Essex senior men's team currently play in Division 2 of the County Championship having won promotion from Division 3 at the end of 2018. The 2018 competition also marked the county's first appearance at Twickenham Stadium when they reached the Shield final, losing 22-24 to Dorset &amp; Wilts.\nAffiliated clubs.\nThere are currently 45 clubs affiliated with the Essex RFU, with teams at both senior and junior level.\nCounty club competitions.\nThe Essex RFU currently helps run the following club competitions: \nCups.\n1st team:\n2nd team:"

Defending champion Tiger Woods was three shots back after shooting a 68 and pre-tournament favorite Bryson DeChambeau was a further two shots back after a 70. Play was suspended for three hours due to an electrical storm. 44 of the 92 players did not complete their first rounds on Thursday due to the lack of daylight. On Friday morning, Casey was joined in the lead by Dylan Frittelli and Dustin Johnson, who matched his 65.\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, November 13, 2020\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"Saturday, November 14, 2020\"\nDustin Johnson, Jon Rahm, and Justin Thomas were among five players sharing the 36-hole lead, making it the first time the top three players in the world rankings have shared the 36-hole lead in a major championship. Johnson, a co-leader after the first round, got to 10-under-par with birdies on three of his first four holes before consecutive bogeys on holes 14 and 15 (his fifth and sixth, respectively, of the round). He then made 11 consecutive pars before closing with a birdie on the ninth to finish at 9-under-par.\nThomas made four straight birdies on holes 15 to 18 (his sixth to ninth) and overcame a double-bogey at the first, completing his round with birdies at the last two holes for a three-under-par round of 69. Rahm, who finished his round on Saturday morning, had a bogey-free 66 (−6). They were joined at the top of the leaderboard by Abraham Ancer, making his Masters debut, and Cameron Smith, who eagled the 15th before finishing with three straight birdies.\nTwo-time champion Bernhard Langer made the cut at three-under, becoming, at age 63, the oldest player in Masters history to make the cut. Two amateurs made the cut, John Augenstein on 3-under-par and Andy Ogletree at one-under.\nWith the first round still to be completed on Friday morning, the second round started at 9:30 am instead of the planned 7:00 am. 48 players did not finish their second round as play was suspended. The second round continued at 7:30 am on Saturday. After the completion of the round, 60 players made the cut, the leading 50 and ties, with the third round beginning at 10:20 am.\nAmateurs: \"Augenstein (−5), Ogletree (−1)\", Sugrue (+4), Michel (+6), Lin (+8), Gallegos (+16)\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, November 14, 2020\"\nWorld No. 1 Dustin Johnson had a bogey-free round of 65 (−7) to take a four-shot lead into the final round. Johnson, part of a five-way tie for the lead going into the round, jumped to the top of the leaderboard with an eagle on the par-five second hole after hitting his approach shot to three feet. He also birdied the third hole before making a 38-foot birdie putt on the fourth. On the back nine, Johnson two-putted for birdie on both par-fives, the 13th and 15th, and saved par from left of the 18th green to finish his round. His 16-under-par score of 200 after 54 holes tied the Masters tournament record, set by Jordan Spieth in 2015. He also became the first player in Masters history with two rounds of 65 or better in the same tournament.\nSouth Korea's Im Sung-jae, making his Masters debut, birdied the 18th after getting a fortunate bounce off the mound to the left of the green to 14 feet. He joined Abraham Ancer, another Masters rookie, and Cameron Smith in a tie for second place at 12-under-par.\nJon Rahm, tied for the lead at the start of the round, fell four shots back of Johnson playing the eighth hole before making double-bogey on the par-five, his third shot ricocheting off a tree trunk and into bushes from where he had to take a penalty drop. He had an even par round to finish seven strokes off the lead and tied for seventh place. Justin Thomas was still within two shots of Johnson but made four bogeys on the back nine to drop six back.\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, November 15, 2020\"\nSummary.\nDustin Johnson began the round with a four-shot lead before making consecutive bogeys at the fourth and fifth holes. Cameron Smith reduced the lead to one after making birdie at the ninth, hitting his approach shot from the pine straw to four feet.\nJohnson, meanwhile, came back to birdie the sixth and two-putt for birdie on the par-five eighth after reaching the green in two, taking a two-shot lead into the back nine. He laid up on the par-five 13th but managed to get up-and-down for birdie, then made a six-foot birdie putt on the 14th. After again laying up on the 15th, Johnson chipped to seven feet for his third shot and made the birdie putt to become the first player in Masters history to reach 20-under. He made par on the final three holes to set a new Masters scoring record, breaking the old mark of 18-under set by Tiger Woods in 1997 and Jordan Spieth in 2015.\nSmith bogeyed the 11th after missing the green to the right and finished at 15-under, five behind Johnson and tied for second place. Im Sung-jae, making his Masters debut at the age of 22, birdied both par-fives on the back nine to join Smith at 15-under. Smith shot a three-under 69, becoming the first player in Masters history with four rounds in the 60s. Johnson's five-shot margin of victory was the largest at the Masters since Woods won by 12 in 1997. He made only four bogeys in the tournament, the fewest ever by a Masters champion.\nWoods, the defending champion, made a 10 on the par-three 12th after hitting three balls into the water, the highest score on a hole in his career. But he came back to birdie five of his last six holes, including the last four in a row for the first time at the Masters, and finished in a tie for 38th place.\nOf the two amateurs who made the cut, Andy Ogletree finished at 2-under-par while John Augenstein finished at 3-over-par.\nFor the second year in a row, a two-tee start was used, with players teeing off between 8:00 am and 9:39 am, using the 1st and 10th tees.\nScorecard.\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\"\nMedia.\nThis was the 65th consecutive Masters to air on CBS Sports, which began coverage in 1956. Cable coverage aired on ESPN. To ensure that play would conclude before the earlier sunset, and to accommodate CBS's coverage of the NFL, the final round was scheduled so that coverage would begin at 10:00 a.m. ET (similarly to the previous year's final round, which was moved up due to the threat of storms) and conclude around 2:30 p.m. ET. To accommodate the tournament, CBS was only assigned late-afternoon NFL games (4:05 p.m. ET kickoff) for that week's games. Furthermore, CBS's SEC football game on Saturday, normally a 3:30 p.m. ET game, was scheduled for a 6:00 p.m. ET kickoff so that it could air as a lead-out for third round coverage. It was reported that in the event that the final round did overrun past 4:00 p.m. ET, coverage could be shifted to ESPN's sister broadcast network ABC and simulcast on CBS Sports Network, but that this was highly unlikely.\nThe SEC game was postponed due to COVID-19 cases in one of the participating teams, leading to CBS scheduling only its pre-game show \"College Football Today\" (largely to recap the day's games) after the conclusion of coverage, and giving the rest of the game's broadcast window back to affiliates and its regular Saturday-night network programming.\nTo cross-promote the tournament, ESPN broadcast \"College GameDay\" on-location from Augusta National's par 3 course on November 14.\nFor the first time since 1963, there was no live coverage of the Masters on free to air television in the UK, with pay television broadcaster Sky Sports securing exclusive rights. Extended highlights were however shown free to air by BBC Sport with what turned out to be the last major tournament covered by veteran commentator Peter Alliss who died less than a month later in December 2020.\nViewership.\nFacing competition from early-afternoon NFL games on Fox, the final round was seen by 5.59 million viewers in the United States according to the Nielsen ratings — making it the least watched final round at the Masters since 1957."

        "text": "The 2019–20 Michigan State Spartans men's basketball team represented Michigan State University in the 2019–20 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The Spartans were led by 25th-year head coach Tom Izzo and play their home games at Breslin Center in East Lansing, Michigan as members of the Big Ten Conference.\nWith a win against Ohio State on March 8, 2020, the Spartans earned a share of their third straight Big Ten regular season championship. The Spartans finished the season 22–9, 14–6 in Big Ten play to finish in a three-way tie for first place. Their season ended following the cancellation of postseason tournaments due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOn January 5, in a game against rival Michigan, senior point guard Cassius Winston recorded nine assists to move his career total over 800 making him the first Big Ten basketball player to ever record more than 1,600 points and 800 assists in a career. On January 17, Winston recorded his 817th career assist moving him past Mateen Cleaves for the most assists in Big Ten history.\nCassius Winston was a consensus All-American for the second consecutive year, becoming only the second Spartan to become an All-American in more than one season. Winston is one of only four players in Division I history with at least 1,900 points and 850 assists for a career and was one of just seven Division I players to average at least 18.0 points, 5.5 assists, and 2.0 rebounds per game on the season.\nWith a win over Maryland on February 29, Tom Izzo earned his 300th career Big Ten win, leaving him 53 victories behind the all-time leader Bob Knight. The Spartans began the season as the preseason No. 1 in both the AP and Coaches polls for the first time in school history.\nPrevious season.\nThe Spartans finished the 2018–19 season 32–7, 16–4 to earn a share of the Big Ten championship. As the No. 1 seed in the Big Ten tournament, they defeated Ohio State, Wisconsin, and Michigan (for the third time on the season) to win the tournament championship. The win over Ohio State on March 15, 2019 marked Tom Izzo's 600th career win. The Tournament win marked the school's sixth tournament championship, the most in the Big Ten. As a result of the Tournament victory, the Spartans received the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament as the No. 2 seed in the East Region. In the First Round of the NCAA Tournament, MSU defeated No. 15-seeded Bradley two days before beating No. 10-seeded Minnesota to advance to the team's first Sweet Sixteen since 2015. In the regional semifinals, the Spartans defeated No. 3-seeded LSU to advance to the Elite Eight. There they defeated overall No. 1-seed Duke to advance to the school's 10th Final Four and eighth under head coach, Tom Izzo. In the National Semifinals, Michigan State lost to No. 3-seed Texas Tech.\nThe Spartans were led by Big Ten Player of the Year, junior Cassius Winston, who won the NCAA Tournament East Region's award for Most Outstanding Player, averaging 18.9 points and 7.5 assists per game on the season. He and sophomore Xavier Tillman were both selected for the East Region All-Tournament team.\nOffseason.\nDepartures.\nOn April 19, 2019, Nick Ward announced he would declare for the NBA draft and sign with an agent.

Ward was not selected for the NBA draft.\nReturning players.\nOn April 19, 2019, Cassius Winston announced he would not enter the NBA draft and would return to school for his senior season.\nRecruiting class.\nOn September 22, 2018, four-star point guard Rocket Watts committed to the Spartans. On November 1, 2018, four-star forward Malik Hall committed to MSU. On December 6, MSU once again missed out on a top recruit as No. 2-ranked Vernon Carey chose Duke over the Spartans. On March 10, 2019, the day after witnessing MSU defeat Michigan to win a share of the Big Ten championship, three-star forward Julius Marble announced he had committed to MSU. \nIncoming transfers.\nOn May 28, 2019, Marquette forward Joey Hauser announced he would transfer to MSU. On September 11, Tom Izzo stated that the school had requested a waiver from the NCAA to allow Hauser to play in the 2019–20 season, but Izzo did not expect the waiver to be granted. Izzo later announced that the waiver had been denied, but that the school had appealed the ruling. On November 21, Izzo announced that the appeal had formally been denied. Izzo stated he was \"devastated\" by the denial and announced he had resigned from his position on the board of the National Association of Basketball Coaches. Hauser sat out the 2019–20 season as a result, but will have at least two years of eligibility left beginning in the 2020–21 season.\nEarly offseason rankings.\nIn April 2019, most early pollsters listed Michigan State as the No. 1 team in the country for the 2019–20 season. These included ESPN (No. 1), \"Sports Illustrated\" (No. 1), Yahoo! Sports (No. 1), \"USA Today\" (No. 1), NBC Sports (No. 1), CBS Sports (No. 1), and Bleacher Report (No. 1). Only the \"Sporting News\" failed to list MSU No. 1 instead listing them as No. 2.\nIn a poll of over 100 college basketball coaches conducted by CBS Sports, the Spartans were picked to win the 2020 National Championship, receiving a record 54% of the votes. Cassius Winston was selected as the best player for the season, receiving a record 50% of the votes.\nPreseason.\nPreseason rankings.\nIn its preseason college preview, Lindy's Sports ranked Michigan State No. 1 in the country and picked the Spartans to win the Big Ten. Athlon Sports also ranked MSU as No. 1 in the country and also picked the Spartans to win the Big Ten. NBC Sports and \"Street and Smith\" also named MSU No. 1 in the country.\nFor the first time in school history, the Spartans were ranked No.1 in the Preseason AP Poll. The Spartans were also ranked No. 1 in the preseason Coaches Poll, also for the first time in school history.\nPreseason Big Ten polls.\nPrior to the conference's annual media day, unofficial awards and a poll were chosen by a panel of 28 writers, two for each team in the conference. Michigan State was the near unanimous selection to win the conference, receiving 27 of 28 first-place votes.\nAt Big Ten media day, Cassius Winston was a unanimous selection as the preseason player of the year. Winston was also a unanimous selection to the 10-member All-Big Ten Preseason Team. Xavier Tillman was also selected to the team.\nCBS Sports picked MSU to win the Big Ten while naming Winston as the Preseason Player of the Year and Tom Izzo as Preseason Coach of the Year.\nPreseason awards.\nCBS Sports named Cassius Winston to the Preseason All-American first team and picked him as Preseason Player of the Year.

Cassius Winston led the Spartans with 20 points and seven assists. Aaron Henry added 13 points while Xavier Tillman scored six points and had 10 rebounds. MSU lost 103–87 in the scrimmage.\nJoshua Langford injury.\nOn October 22, Tom Izzo announced that Joshua Langford, who only played in 13 games the previous season due to a foot injury, had suffered a setback and would not be able to play to start the season. Izzo said Langford would be out indefinitely and would be reevaluated in January 2020. On December 19, Izzo announced that Langford would be out for the season and would not return.\nExhibition.\nOn October 29, the Spartans played an exhibition game at Breslin Center against Albion College. Cassius Winston's two younger brothers, Zach and Khy, were on the Albion team, though Zach did not play due to an injury. Mark \"Rocket\" Watts started as the shooting guard with Langford out and Thomas Kithier started at power forward. Xavier Tillman led MSU with 19 points and eight rebounds while Winston scored 16 points and added nine assists. Kithier grabbed a game-high 11 rebounds as the Spartans used several different lineups in the tune-up prior to the season opener on November 5. MSU won easily 85–50.\nRegular season.\nEarly non-conference games.\nKentucky.\nThe Spartans took on No. 2-ranked Kentucky to open the season on November 5 at the Champions Classic. The game was played at Madison Square Garden in New York. MSU trailed for most of the game, falling behind every time they were able to move close to the Wildcats. Cassius Winston led the Spartans with 21 points, but no other Spartan scored more than Gabe Brown's 10 points. MSU shot less than 20% from three and under 40% from the floor. They were able to narrow the Kentucky lead to two points with just over a minute remaining, but were unable to complete the comeback, losing 69–62. The Spartans turned the ball over 15 times in the loss.\nBinghamton.\nMSU returned home to take on Binghamton in their home opener on November 10. Shortly before the game, it was revealed that Cassius Winston's brother Zach had been hit by a train and died the night before. It was later announced that Zach had committed suicide. Winston chose to play in the game and scored 17 points and dished out 11 assists. Xavier Tillman also scored 17, while Aaron Henry had 16 and Marcus Bingham Jr. had 13. The Spartans led by 31 at the half and won easily, 100–47. MSU continued to struggle from three, making only 28% of their three-pointers, but did shoot over 63% from the floor and had only four turnovers in the easy win. Michigan State had a moment of silence before the game in Zach Winston's memory. The win evened MSU's record at 1–1 on the season.\nSeton Hall.\nThe newly third-ranked Spartans traveled to take on No. 12 Seton Hall in Newark, New Jersey on November 14 as part of the Gavitt Tipoff games. Seton Hall guard Myles Powell, who suffered an ankle injury in his team's previous game, surprisingly started and scored 37 points against the Spartans as the game remained tight throughout. Cassius Winston, playing in his second game since his brother's death, scored 21 points for the Spartans, but it was Malik Hall who helped the Spartans to the win, scoring 17 points in 19 minutes on a perfect 7–7 from the floor. Rocket Watts added a clutch three-pointer after missing a layup on the prior possession to keep the Spartans in the game. Due mostly to Hall's 3–3 from three, the Spartans shot 44% from behind the arc. Hall hit the game-winning layup with less than a minute remaining as the Spartans pulled out the 76–73 win. The Spartans moved to 2–1 on the season with the win.\nCharleston Southern.\nThe Spartans returned home to face Charleston Southern on November 18. Aaron Henry did not play in the game due to ankle injuries suffered in the Seton Hall game. Xavier Tillman scored a career-high 21 points and grabbed 10 rebounds as MSU destroyed Charleston Southern 94–46. Gabe Brown made his first career start and scored 12 points including a couple of impressive dunks. Rocket Watts scored a career-high 11 in the win. Following the game, Winston addressed the crowd in his first public comments since the loss of his brother. MSU moved to 3–1 with the win.\nMaui Invitatoinal.\nVirginia Tech.\nMSU traveled to Hawaii to participate in the Maui Invitational with games beginning November 25. In the first game against Virginia Tech, Cassius Winston suffered foul trouble and was held to only seven points and two assists. The Spartans had problems limiting Tech's three-point shooting, allowing the Hokies to shoot over 47% from three. Aaron Henry led the Spartans with 18 points while Xavier Tillman had 14 rebounds. However, a 10-point deficit late proved too much for the Spartans to overcome as they were shockingly defeated 71–66 in the first round of the tournament. Tom Izzo publicly apologized for the loss after the game, citing Winston's recent tough times with the loss of his brother. Izzo admitted he was out-coached in the game. The loss dropped the Spartans to 3–2 on the season.\nGeorgia.\nThe Spartans next faced Georgia, coached by former Izzo assistant Tom Crean, in the consolation bracket on day two of the tournament. The Spartans jumped out to an early lead over the Bulldogs as Cassius Winston rebounded from his rough first game of the tournament. Winston scored 28 points while Xavier Tillman added 15 and Aaron Henry scored 14. MSU led by more than 20 early in the second half before Georgia freshman Anthony Edwards went off, scoring 33 of his 27 points in the second half to bring Georgia within two points. The Spartans held off the Bulldogs however, winning 93–85. Tom Izzo noted after the game that he needed to persuade Winston, who was still struggling with the death of his brother, to leave the locker room to play the game. Winston responded with eight assists in the win. The win moved MSU to 4–2 on the season.\nUCLA.\nMSU next faced UCLA in the fifth place game of the Maui Tournament. Cassius Winston again played well, scoring 20 points while Xavier Tillman had 13 points as MSU led throughout against the Bruins. Leading by as many as 15 in the second half, the Spartans won 75–62 marking the end of the tournament the team. Marcus Bingham Jr. started his second straight game, marking his first start of the season, but only played seven minutes and failed to score. MSU left Maui with a 5–2 record on the season.\nDuke.\nThe newly 11th-ranked Spartans returned home to face Duke in the ACC–Big Ten Challenge on December 3. The Spartans, who were 2–11 under Tom Izzo against Duke were run off the floor by the Blue Devils. Duke took an early lead behind former MSU recruiting target Vernon Carey and extended their lead to over 20 points in the second half. Duke shot over 56% from the field including 46% from three as they demolished the Spartans 87–75. Xavier Tillman scored 20 for the Spartans who, after being the preseason No. 1 team, dropped to 5–3 on the season. Tom Izzo again apologized for the performance after the game, saying the Spartans were \"[o]utcoached, outplayed, outworked.\" The loss dropped MSU to 5–3 on the season.\nEarly conference game.\nRutgers.\nThe Spartans next welcomed Rutgers to Breslin Center on December 8 for the Big Ten opener. Michigan State led throughout the game, but was never able to pull away as Rutgers seemed to answer every MSU run. Cassius Winston led all scorers with 23 points and added seven assists and three steals. Gabe Brown started for injured Rocket Watts and scored 14 points while Xavier Tillman also scored 14. The Spartans pulled away at the end to win 77–65 and move to 1–0 in the Big Ten and 6–3 on the season.\nNon-conference game.\nOakland.\nAfter a week off for finals, the Spartans played Oakland at Little Caesars Arena in Detroit on December 14. MSU struggled again from three-point range, shooting only 31%, but had no problems with Oakland overall. MSU limited Oakland to 26% shooting from the field and led throughout. The Spartans led by 24 at the half and cruised for an easy 72–29 win. Only Xavier Tillman scored in double figures for the Spartans, scoring 10, while 12 other Spartans scored in the game. Cassuis Winston scored only nine points making only three of 13 shots, but added four assists. Tillman added 13 rebounds in the game. Rocket Watts missed the game with a leg injury that was considered to be minor. The win moved MSU to 7–3 on the season.\nSecond early conference game.\nNorthwestern.\nMSU next traveled to face their second early-season Big Ten foe, Northwestern on December 18. With every other Big Ten road team losing in the early season games, MSU looked to avoid the early trend. MSU led throughout, but every time they looked to put the game away, Northwestern would narrow the lead. MSU turned the ball over 16 times, but Cassius Winston scored 21 points and Xavier Tillman added 15 as the Spartans held on for a 77–71 win. Tillman and Aaron Henry each grabbed 10 rebounds and MSU improved its three-point shooting, making 42.9%. The win moved MSU into sol possession of first place in the Big Ten with a 2–0 record and 8–3 overall.\nRemaining non-conference games.\nEastern Michigan.\nMSU returned home and out-of-conference to face Eastern Michigan December 21. EMU, who was 9–1 on the season, was no match for the Spartans. MSU dominated the Eagles, limiting them to only 10% shooting from three and 23% overall. Meanwhile, the Spartans shot 50% from three as the Spartans ran EMU out of the gym. Cassius Winston scored 21 points and added seven assists. Aaron Henry added six assists and 12 points. Foster Loyer scored a season-high 13 for the Spartans as MSU reached the 100-point mark for the second time on the season, winning 101–48.

Xavier Tillman and Aaron Henry each added 15 points for the Spartans who ended the non-conference schedule at 10–3. Rocket Watts made his first appearance in a game since the Duke loss and scored nine points in 12 minutes. Tom Izzo did state Winston not playing was mostly precautionary and did not expect him to miss any more games.\nRemaining conference games.\nIllinois.\nMSU returned to Big Ten play to face Illinois at Breslin Center on January 2, 2020. Cassius Winston returned to the lineup and MSU led from the start, leading by as many as 13 in the first half. Illinois was able to cut the lead to five at the half despite missing all 11 of their three-point shots as the Spartans led 35–30. The Spartan defense continued to play well in the second half, limiting Illinois to under 30% from the field and allowing only three made three point baskets.

The win moved the Spartans to 11–3 on the season and to 3–0 in Big Ten play.\nMichigan.\nThe Spartans welcomed Michigan to East Lansing on January 5 for a Rivalry game having beaten the Wolverine three times the prior year. MSU took an early lead and led throughout. Michigan kept the game close for most of the first half, helped by 13 MSU turnovers. However, Michigan could not contain Cassius Winston, as he scored a career-high 32 points and added nine assists on 11–19 shooting. The nine assists moved his career total over 800 making him the first Big Ten basketball player to ever record more than 1,600 points and 800 points in a career. MSU only led by 10 at the half, but pushed the lead to as many as 18 in the second half. Xavier Tillman played well, earning a double-double with 20 points and 11 rebounds. MSU limited the Wolverines to under 22% from three and under 37% from the field as the game was never in doubt. The Spartans shot over 52% from the field and over 46% from three in the game. The win was the fourth straight by the Spartans over Michigan and the seventh straight win for MSU on the season. The win moved MSU to 4–0 in Big Ten play and 12–3 on the season.\nMinnesota.\nMinnesota traveled to Breslin to play the Spartans on January 9. The Spartans again led through most of the first half, but Minnesota took the lead on a few occasions near the half. MSU went to the break leading 36–32. Cassius Winston came alive in the second half scoring 18 of his game-high 27 points in the half. Xavier Tillman notched 19 points and a career-high 16 rebounds as the duo led the Spartans to 74–58 win. Despite Minnesota's big man up front, the Spartans out-rebounded the Gophers 48–30 and held Minnesota to under 40% shooting in the game. The win marked the Spartans' eighth straight and moved them to 5–0 in Big Ten play and 13–3 on the season.\nPurdue.\nMSU next headed on the road to Purdue where they had not won since 2014. MSU played poorly and was blown out by the Boilermakers, trailing by 17 at the half and losing by 29. Cassius Winston led the Spartans with 10 points as MSU could only muster 42 points in the game. Winston also turned the ball over nine times as MSU struggled mightily. Rocket Watts added 10 points in the loss, but Tom Izzo was embarrassed by the performance. Izzo stated that it was \"probably the worst beating I've taken as a coach\". MSU only made two three-point baskets and shot just 35% from the field in the loss. The loss dropped the Spartans to 5–1 in conference and 13–4 overall, but the Spartans remained alone in first play in the Big Ten.\nWisconsin.\nThree days before the Spartans returned home to face Wisconsin on January 17, the school announced that guard Kyle Ahrens would miss extended time as he looked to recover from a plethora of injuries. Michigan State did not need him against Wisconsin, as the Spartans continued to dominate at home, leading throughout and pushing the lead to over 20 at times. Cassius Winston only had six points and four rebounds, but that was enough to pass Mateen Cleaves for the Big Ten record in assists. Xavier Tillman scored 15 while Aaron Henry and Gabe Brown added 13. Rocket Watts added 11 in the easy win over the Badgers. The Spartans held Wisconsin under 36% from the field and only 21% from three in the win. Winston appeared to be pressing to set the record as he turned the ball over five times and struggled from the field. The 67–55 win moved MSU to 14–4 overall and 6–1 in Big Ten play as MSU remained alone in first place in the conference.\nIndiana.\nAfter playing five of their first seven conference games on the road, the Spartans began a two-game road trip starting with Indiana on January 23. MSU started slowly, falling behind 20–8 early in the first half. MSU fought back, unlike it did against Purdue, and drew within seven at the half. The Spartans continued to narrow the lead in the second half and briefly took the lead before Indiana retook the lead and was able to hold off the Spartans. Cassius Winston led all scorers with 17, but struggled early. Aaron Henry added 12 points for the Spartans, but MSU turned the ball over 13 times as they lost 67–63. The road loss moved MSU into a first-place tie with Illinois atop the Big Ten. The loss left the Spartans at 14–5 overall and 6–2 in conference play. After the game, Tom Izzo vowed to make changes as he was unhappy with his team's play.\nMinnesota.\nStaying on the road, the Spartans traveled to Minneapolis to face Minnesota on January 26. MSU starting lineup changed, as Tom Izzo had promised, with freshmen Rocket Watts and Malik Hall starting for sophomores Aaron Henry and Marcus Bingham. Both teams started slowly, but Minnesota missed many open looks as the Spartans took control of the game. Cassius Winston had 18 points and eight assists while Xavier Tillman notched a double double with 17 points and 10 rebounds. Minnesota trailed by double figures for most of the game and MSU won by 18, 70–52. MSU's defense suffocated the Gophers, limiting them to 17.9% from three and only 28% overall in the win. The win kept the Spartans in a first-place tie with Illinois at 7–2 and 15–5 overall.\nNorthwestern.\nThe Spartans returned home to face last place Northwestern on January 29. Aaron Henry returned to the starting lineup, but struggled from the floor, not making a field goal until late in the second half. He did however have four steals and two assists. Despite this, the Spartans jumped to a big lead early in the first half behind Cassius Winston's 18 points and Xavier Tillman's 12 points, eight rebounds, and four assists. MSU led by as many as 13 in the first half. In the second half, MSU blew the Wildcats off the floor leading by as many as 36 in the easy win over Northwestern. Foster Loyer added 12 points on four three-pointers and MSU was able to rest many of their key players for large portions of the second half. The 79–50 win moved MSU a half game ahead of Illinois for the Big Ten lead at 8–2 in conference play and 16–5 overall.\nWisconsin.\nMSU returned to the road to play short-handed Wisconsin on February 1. On January 29, it was announced that the Badgers second-leading scorer, Kobe King, was leaving the program and that guard Brad Davison would be suspended for one game for a flagrant foul in Wisconsin's loss to Iowa on January 27. This did not seem to matter in the first half as the Badgers jumped out to an early double digit lead and looked to be on the brink of blowing out the Spartans. Trailing by 16 at the half, the Spartans mounted a vigorous comeback behind Cassius Winston's 23 points and Rocket Watts' 16 points, but Xavier Tillman missed several easy layups in the final minutes as the Spartans were unable to complete the comeback. Two Winston three-pointers at the end narrowed the gap to one as the Spartans lost 64–63. Tillman made only three of 15 shots in the game, but did add 14 rebounds. Gabe Brown did not start and only played three minutes due to illness. The loss left the Spartans tied with Illinois for first in the Big Ten at 8–3 and 16–6 overall.\nPenn State.\nThe Spartans returned home to face Penn State. The Nittany Lions had not beaten the Spartans at Breslin Center since 2009, but they started well. PSU shot over 40% from the field in the game and took a six-point lead to half time. Cassius Winston again played well, scoring a game-high 25 points, but no other Spartan reached double figures. MSU narrowed the lead in the second half as the teams exchanged leads. Penn State took a three-point lead with less than 15 seconds remaining, but Winston was fouled while making a running layup to narrow the lead to one. However, Winston missed the game-tying free throw and then missed a desperation three-pointer as the Spartans lost their second straight game 75–70. Thomas Kithier did not play in the game due to illness. MSU shot over 47% from the field in the game but turned the ball over 15 times. The loss dropped the Spartans to 8–4 in Big Ten play, 16-7 overall, and out of first place.\nMichigan.\nMSU returned to the road to face rival Michigan on February 8. MSU trailed throughout the game and was never able to narrow the Michigan lead, losing 77–68. Cassius Winston had 20 points and Xavier Tillman scored 17, but only four other Spartans scored as MSU lost its third straight game. The loss moved MSU to 8–5 in Big Ten play and 16–8 overall.\nIllinois.\nThe Spartans then traveled to Champaign to face Illinois on February 11 having fallen out of the AP poll for the first time since the end of 2017. After struggling early in recent road tests, the Spartans jumped early on Illinois and led by 17 at the half. After pushing the lead to 20 early in the second half, the Illini fought their way back into the game and took the lead with a little more than five minutes left in the game. The Spartans, however, did not fold as they had done recently and exchanged leads with Illinois until Illini freshman big man Kofi Cockburn made two free throws with 20 seconds remaining to give Illinois the 69–68 leas. Cassius Winston then drove to the basket drawing three Illini defenders and his shot which may well have been a pass was rebounded and dunked home by Xavier Tillman with six seconds remaining. Illinois turned the ball over on their final possession as the Spartans broke their three-game losing streak. Rocket Watts exploded in the game for the Spartans, scoring 21 points on 14 shots in his return to the starting lineup. Tillman added 17 while Aaron Henry had 13 in the win. The win moved MSU to with 1.5 games of the conference lead with a 9–5 record and 17–8 overall.\nMaryland.\nESPN College Gameday came to East Lansing as MSU welcomed Big Ten leader Maryland to town on February 15. The Spartans again started slow, trailing by as many as 15 in the first half, but narrowed the lead to eight at halftime. MSU then took control of the game and fought their way to a seven-point lead with just over three minutes remaining. However, MSU's defense, which had held Maryland guard Anthony Cowan Jr. to two points in the second half, gave up four three-pointers on Maryland's next four possessions while the Spartans failed to score. Two free throws with little time remaining gave Maryland a 67–60 win and all but ended MSU's hopes for a conference championship. The loss moved MSU to 17–9 overall and 9–6 in Big Ten play, 2.5 games behind Maryland. MSU again struggled for scoring behind Xavier Tillman's 18 points and Cassius Winston's 14.\nNebraska.\nMSU returned to the road to play Nebraska on February 20. Tom Izzo started walk-on Jack Hoiberg, son of Nebraska head coach Fred Hoiberg. MSU failed to pull away through most of the first half and only led by three at the half despite making nine three-pointers in the half. Turnovers were a major story for the Spartans who turned the ball over 12 times in the first half and 21 times in the game. However, Cassius Winston, despite five turnover, scored 23 points while Gabe Brown added 17 points on five three-pointers. Kyle Ahrens added 14 as the Spartans pulled away to win by 21, 86–65. Izzo decided on the drive to the arena to start Hoiberg and Fred Hoiberg said he appreciated the gesture. The win kept the Spartans in a tie for third place in the Big Ten at 10–6 and 18–9 overall.\nIowa.\nWith four games remaining in the regular season and the Spartans clinging to hopes of a Big Ten title, Iowa came to the Breslin Center on February 25 and dominated the first half, taking a 33–27 lead at the half. MSU's struggles in the half related to Xavier Tillman garnering two early fouls and playing only four minutes in the half. Additionally, Cassius Winston only scored one point in the half. Rocket Watts kept his team in the game scoring most of team-high 21 points in the first half. In the second half, Tillman solidified MSU's defense on Big Ten Player of the Year candidate Luka Garza and added two blocks to set the MSU career block record. Winston also came alive in the second half, scoring 19 of his 20 points to bring the Spartans back into the game. Aaron Henry scored 12 of his 17 points in the second half as the Spartans rallied to win 78–70, marking the first time on the season that the Spartans had won after trailing at the half. The win kept the Spartans in second place still two games behind Maryland at 11–6 and 19–9 overall.\nMaryland.\nThe Spartans traveled to face Maryland on February 29. MSU jumped out to a 9–0 start and led throughout the first half. Maryland did tie the game halfway through the first half, but MSU again pulled away and, helped by a three-quarters court shot by Cassius Winston at the buzzer, and led by 11 at the half. The Spartans continued to dominate the second half, leading by double digits most of the way as MSU cruised to a 78–66 win over the Terrapins. Winston had 20 points and six assists while Rocket Watts added 13 and Malik Hall scored 16. Xavier Tillman added 14 points and 12 rebounds as the Spartans drew within one game of the conference lead with the win. The win moved the Spartans to 12–6 in conference and 20–9 overall, the school's ninth straight season with at least 20 wins.\nPenn State.\nWith two games remaining in the regular season, the Spartans traveled to face Penn State on March 3. MSU did not start well as Penn State dominated the first half making 10 of 17 three pointers and leading by as many as 19 in the half. The Spartans roared back in the second half, taking the lead less than five minutes in to the half. Xavier Tillman scored a career-high 23 points and added 14 rebounds. Rocket Watts added 18 points on 20 shots and Cassius Winston scored 14 as the Spartans came back to win 79–71. The Spartans shot over 53% from the field while limiting Penn State to under 34%. The Spartan defense also held the Nittany Lions to no made three-pointers (0 for 13) in the second half as they pulled away for the win. The win, combined with a Maryland loss, moved the Spartans into a first place tie in the conference at 13–6 and 21–9 overall.\nOhio State.\nIn their final regular season game, the Spartans faced Ohio State at Breslin for Senior Day and with a chance to win a third straight Big Ten regular season championship. MSU jumped out to an early lead, leading by as many as 12 in the first half, but Ohio State was able to close the deficit to four before Xavier Tillman made a fall-away jumper as the first half expired to give MSU a 38–32 halftime lead. Cassius Winston, on his Senior Day, took over in the second half and scored a game-high 27 points and dished out six assists. Rocket Watts continued his strong play, scoring 19 points, while Tillman added 15 as the Spartans extended their lead to 20 with more than two minutes remaining in the game. MSU then substituted its seniors out of the game as Winston, Kyle Ahrens, and Connor George kissed the Spartan logo to cheers from the MSU crowd. MSU held on for the win, 80–69, securing their third straight Big Ten regular season championship, their 10th under Tom Izzo. The win moved the Spartans to 14–6 and 22–9 overall. The game ended up being the final game of the season for the Spartans.\nPostseason.\nBig Ten tournament.\nDue to tie-breaking rules, the Spartans received the No. 2 seed in the Big Ten tournament. However, the tournament was canceled before the Spartans played their first game, due to ongoing concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic.\nNCAA Tournament.\nLike the Big Ten tournament, the NCAA tournament was canceled due to the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States.\nSchedule and results.\nThe Big Ten announced MSU's conference opponents on April 17, 2019. MSU participated in the Champions Classic, the ACC–Big Ten Challenge, and the Maui Invitational Tournament. Additionally, the Spartans participated in the Gavitt Tip-Off Games for the first time, playing Big East opponent, Seton Hall. It was expected that the Spartans would take an exhibition tour of Spain in late summer, but the school announced on June 17 that there would be no trip.\n!colspan=9 style=|Exhibition\n!colspan=9 style=|Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=|Big Ten tournament\n!colspan=9 style=|\"Canceled\"\n!colspan=9 style=|NCAA tournament\n!colspan=9 style=|\"Canceled\"\nPlayer statistics.\nSource"

        "title": "George Kirby (baseball)",
        "text": "George Joseph Kirby (born February 4, 1998) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Seattle Mariners of Major League Baseball (MLB). He made his MLB debut in 2022.\nAmateur career.\nKirby grew up a fan of the New York Yankees in Westchester County, New York. He attended Rye High School in Rye, where he played both baseball and basketball. As a sophomore baseball player in 2014, he threw 153 pitches in the NYSPHSAA Section 1 Class A championship game to beat Lakeland High School. Elon University began recruiting him to play college baseball in 2014. After his junior season in 2015, he was named to the New York State Sportswriters Association's All-State First Team for Class A as a pitcher and first baseman and \"The Journal News\" Westchester/Putnam All-Star First Team alongside Josiah Gray. As a senior in 2016, he went 6–0 with a 0.32 ERA and 73 strikeouts in innings and was again named to the All-State First Team. Although expected to be an early pick in the 2016 Major League Baseball draft, he fell to the New York Mets in the 32nd round because of signability concerns. He chose not to sign with the Mets and instead chose to attend Elon to play college baseball for the Elon Phoenix.\nAs a freshman at Elon in 2017, Kirby appeared in 16 games (five starts) and pitched to a 1–3 record with a 4.84 ERA, striking out 55 batters in innings. He was named to the Colonial Athletic Association (CAA) All-Rookie Team. In 2018, as a sophomore, Kirby appeared and started in 15 games, going 10–3 with a 2.89 ERA and 96 strikeouts in innings. He earned a spot on the All-CAA Second Team. After the season, Kirby played in the Cape Cod Baseball League for the Harwich Mariners where he posted a 1.38 ERA in 13 innings. Prior to the 2019 season, Kirby was named a preseason All-American by both Baseball America and Perfect Game. He was named the 2019 CAA Pitcher of the Year after going 8–2 with a 2.75 ERA in 14 starts, striking out 107 batters and walking only six in innings.\nProfessional career.\nSeattle Mariners.\nMinor Leagues.\nConsidered to be one of the top prospects for the 2019 Major League Baseball draft, Kirby was drafted by the Seattle Mariners with the 20th overall pick. He signed with Seattle for $3.24 million. After signing, he was assigned to the Everett AquaSox of the Class A Short Season Northwest League, with whom he spent all of the 2019 season. Over nine games (eight starts), Kirby compiled a 2.35 ERA, striking out 25 over 23 innings. Kirby did not play a minor league game in 2020 due to the cancellation of the minor league season caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. To begin 2021, he returned to Everett, now members of the High-A West. In August, he was promoted to the Arkansas Travelers of the Double-A Central. Over 15 starts between the two clubs, Kirby compiled a 5–3 record and 2.53 ERA, striking out eighty batters over innings. Kirby returned to Arkansas to open the 2022 season.\n2022.\nOn May 8, 2022, the Mariners selected Kirby's contract and promoted him to the major leagues. He made his MLB debut that day as the starting pitcher versus the Tampa Bay Rays, and threw six scoreless innings in which he struck out seven batters.\nOn August 24, 2022, while pitching against the Washington Nationals, Kirby set an MLB record by throwing 24 consecutive strikes to start the game, the most by a major league pitcher since 1988. The previous record was set by Joe Musgrove in 2018 with 21 consecutive strikes.\nHe made his Postseason debut on October 8, 2022 in the Mariners 10-9 win over the Blue Jays in the 2nd and final game of the Wild Card Series. He came out of the bullpen to close out the game and the series in the bottom of the 9th. He gave up a one out walk to Matt Chapman, then retired the next two hitters to seal the game for the Mariners and advance them to the ALDS. His next Postseason appearance came in that ALDS against Houston, this time Seattle was down in the series two games to zero, and facing elimination. This time around, Kirby got the opportunity to start the game, and he pitched very good. He tossed seven scoreless innings, striking out five and walking none. He was pulled from the game prior to the 8th inning, with the score tied 0-0. The game remained tied going into the 18th inning, which set an MLB playoff record (broke the record set only a few days before in a game between Cleveland and Tampa Bay). The Mariners used nine more pitchers that game after Kirby, and the Astros didn't score until rookie shortstop Jeremy Pena's solo home run off of Mariners reliever Penn Murfee broke the tie and gave the Astros the lead, which they held on to.\nKirby finished 6th in the AL Rookie of the Year voting in 2022.\n2023.\nThrough his first fourteen starts of the 2023 season, he had 75 strikeouts and six walks in 87 2/3 innings for a MLB-leading 12.50 strikeout-to-walk ratio.\nKirby was named to his first All-Star game in 2023, joining the team as a replacement for the injured Shane McClanahan. He got to appear in front of his home fans in Seattle in the All-Star game, where he pitched the 4th inning, allowing two hits and one run. He is one of only two graduates of Rye High School (New York) to make an MLB All-Star Game, with the other being B.J. Surhoff.\nAfter a loss to the Tampa Bay Rays on Friday, September 8, 2023, Kirby openly criticized his manager Scott Servais for leaving him in the game past the 6th inning. The next day, he apologized to Servais, saying \"Skip, that's not who I am\".\nOn September 26, 2023, Kirby was hit by a baseball that was thrown onto the field by a fan sitting behind the third base side dugout. The fan, who was wearing a jersey of Mariners outfielder Jarred Kelenic, was promptly identified and removed from the stadium by security.\nDuring Kirby's final start of the 2023 regular season on October 1, 2023, facing Texas Rangers shortstop Corey Seager in the 4th inning, he tossed the first (and only to this point) knuckleball of his MLB career. He did this to honor the legacy of former Red Sox and Pirates pitcher Tim Wakefield, who had passed away earlier that day, who was famous for being a knuckleball pitcher. Kirby, who grew up a Yankees fan, always respected Wakefield, saying after the game \"I always loved watching that guy pitch. even though he's a Red Sox player and I'm a born Yankees fan.\" The Mariners catcher who caught the pitch, Cal Raleigh, grew up a Red Sox fan.\nKirby finished the 2023 season with a 13-10 record and a 3.35 ERA across 31 starts and 190.2 innings. He struck out 172 batters, while walking a minuscule 19 batters. He led all of the Major Leagues in Walks Per 9 Innings (BB9) and Strikeout to Walk Ratio (SO/BB) with a 0.9 and a 9.05, respectively."

        "title": "Clearview Golf Club",
        "text": "The Clearview Golf Club (also Clearview Golf Course) was the first golf course in the United States to be built, owned, and operated by an African American. The club was started in 1946, with Bill Powell purchasing the land and working on it in his spare time. It opened to the public and to all races in April 1948. The club, which is located outside of East Canton, Ohio, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. Bill Powell's daughter, Renee Powell who learned to play on Clearview, went on to become the second black woman to play on the LPGA tour.\nAbout.\nThe Clearview Golf Club is currently the only golf course in the United States that was designed, built, managed, and owned entirely by African Americans. It is one of 13 black-owned or operated golf courses in the US.\nThe club is located two miles outside of East Canton, Ohio. It is a par-72 course. It has 18 holes and covers around 130 acres of land.\nThe club is named \"Clearview\" because Bill Powell, the designer and first owner, wanted a place that \"would represent his 'clear view' of what the game should be about: access for all.\" The club is currently managed by Bill's children, Larry Powell and Renee Powell.\nHistory.\nThe Clearview Golf Club was designed by Bill Powell and was begun in East Canton, Ohio in 1946. As an African American, Powell had faced prejudice when attempting to join other golf clubs in the United States, so he chose to build his own. First, Powell tried to get a GI loan, but was turned down. Powell obtained financial support for his effort to build the golf club from two black physicians and from his brother who took out a second mortgage. With this support, he was able to purchase a 78-acre dairy farm. \nPowell moved his family to a house on the golf course. At the time, he was working as a security guard and in his spare time, he started converting the farm into a golf course. He worked on the course during the day, growing grass and clearing the land by hand while at night, he worked at Timken. He completed the first nine holes by 1948. The club opened in April that same year, with Powell's wife, Marcella, helping out. His young daughter, Renee Powell, began playing golf on the course shortly after it first opened at the age of 3. Renee would go on to become the second black woman to play on the LPGA tour.\nOnce the club was open, it welcomed everyone, regardless of race. The club did experience some problems with vandalism and community hostility, but these did not impair the club's success. A member of the Ku Klux Klan golfed his course, but Powell only told his daughter, Renee, about the incident. Racists called the club the \"nigger nine.\" But Powell didn't care. He said, \"I wanted this to be a place where race didn't matter; where the only thing that matters is the game of golf.\"\nPowell expanded the club to eighteen holes in 1978. In 1995, Renee took over as head golf professional at Clearview. Her father, Bill, never saw a profit while running the course. Like her father and her brother, Larry, Renee didn't draw a salary for working at the club. Renovations sponsored by the PGA of America took place in 1999.\nIn 2001, the course was listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Also in 2001, the course began to operate as a non-profit under the name, Clearview Legacy Foundation. The foundation, the club and the Ohio Historical Society erected a historical marker on the site in 2001.\nThe club was renovated for free in 2004 by Hurdzan-Fry Golf Course Design. The Hurdzan-Fry renovation helped fix the main drainage system at the course. The drainage system was connected to two ponds on the course.\nIn 2007, civil engineering students from the University of Akron provided drawings and designs to help renovate the golf course. The drawings helped the fundraising drive to raise $1.6 million for capital improvements. In 2009, the club faced problems when Buckeye Industrial Mining was allowed to mine coal 370 feet from the club."

        "text": "Calgary 2026 was an unsuccessful bid for the 2026 Winter Olympics by the city of Calgary, Alberta and the Canadian Olympic Committee. Calgary previously hosted the 1988 Winter Olympics. The bid was withdrawn after a local referendum in which 56.4% of Calgary voters rejected the bid.\nHistory.\nCalgary hosted the highly successful 1988 Winter Olympics and posed the bid as \"a catalyst to renew the legacies of 1988\". The Olympics were projected to cost Calgary between CAN$5 - 5.1 billion but funding deals meant Alberta would have paid CAN$700 million and the IOC would have contributed CAN$1.2 billion.\nA Calgary Bid Exploration Committee was established and returned a report to Council and the public.\nThere was speculation that Calgary City Council would cancel the bid before the public vote with reports that the mayor Naheed Nenshi was ready to officially end the bid over funding complications. This proved unfounded after the council voted against cancelling the bid early; eight of the city's 15 councillors voted to kill the proposals, two short of the two-thirds super-majority needed to end the Olympic bid.\nCalgarians were given a non-binding vote on the Olympic bid on 13 November 2018. Voters had to be over 18, a resident of Calgary on the vote day and a Canadian citizen and were asked \"Are you for or are you against Calgary hosting the 2026 Olympic and Paralympic Games?\". The city voted against the proposed plans, with 56.4% opposing and 43.6% supporting the bid and turnout at 40%. Only one of Calgary's 14 wards voted in favour of holding the Games.\nAfter the plebiscite, the City Council unanimously voted to suspend the bid on 19 November 2018, leaving just two joint bids vying for the 2026 games: Stockholm-Åre and Milan–Cortina d'Ampezzo.\nPrevious bids.\nCalgary had previously bid for several Olympic Games, often with the help of the Calgary Olympic Development Association. It bid for the 1964 Winter Olympics losing to Innsbruck, Austria and the 1968 Winter Olympics losing to Grenoble, France. The city partnered with Banff for its third bid and looked set to win the 1972 games, but environmental worries about plans for the development of parts of the Banff National Park meant it finished second to Sapporo, Japan.\nCalgary won the right to represent the Canadian Olympic Association for the 1988 games, defeating a rival bid from Vancouver. The city was opposed by bids from Falun, Sweden and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy. Calgary was confirmed as the host for the 1988 games at the 84th IOC Session in Baden-Baden in 1981.\nVenues.\n80% of the venues for the bid were pre-existing or temporary.\nSporting venues.\nIn Calgary, pre-existing venues included the Olympic Oval for speed skating, McMahon Stadium for the Opening and Closing ceremonies, the Saddledome (the home of the Calgary Flames) for ice hockey. Planned venues included a medium-sized arena for ice hockey with a capacity of 5000 (intended to serve as a replacement of the Stampede Corral) and a multi-sport complex for figure and short track speed skating with a capacity of 10,000.\nOlympic Village.\nThe main Olympic Village was proposed to be in Calgary and have a capacity of 2900 with smaller villages in Canmore (capacity of 1050), Nakiska (capacity of 1000) and Whistler (capacity of 350).\nNon-sporting venues.\nThe broadcasting centre would have been in the existing BMO Centre."

        "text": "The 2018 ITU Triathlon Mixed Relay World Championship was the 10th edition of the mixed relay world championships and the 6th to be held in Hamburg, Germany. The race was hosted on 15 July 2018 to coincide with the 2018 ITU World Triathlon Series Hamburg race, and featured 40 men and 40 women representing 20 countries. The race was around the Binnenalster, an artificial lake in central Hamburg. The race followed the standard mixed relay format, where each athlete would swim 300m, cycle 7 km and run 1.7 km before tagging their next teammate to do the same, with the specified gender order of female—male—female—male.\nOver the first two legs a leading group would emerge but soon be recaptured multiple times. It wasn't until the third leg where a permanent lead group appeared containing the USA, France and the UK. Over the final leg Australia had a great run moving them from fourth to second after overtaking the US on the final straight, but it was France that would win after breaking clear on the cycle. This win would earn France their second world relay title.\nCourse.\nThe event was contested in the city centre of Hamburg, for the relay each of the four athletes would complete the same course one after another. The 300m swim is an out and back course in the Alster. Due to the location of the Reesendammbrücke bridge athletes were required to pass under the bridge both going out and coming back. After the swim a short run to the transition area was required. The cycle consisted of two 3.5 km laps along a flat and technical circuit. The course held two 180° turns as well as many 90° turns with the laps mainly following the shore of the artificial lake Binnenalster. The cycle finished at the same transition area, leading to a 1.7 km run costing of two laps of differing lengths (0.95 km and 0.75 km). Both laps where mostly flat and crossed the Reesendammbrücke bridge.\nThe course was designed to be as spectator-friendly as possible, with the race being the most popular on the ITU's calendar pulling in crowds of over 250,000 gather most years.\nQualification.\nThe qualification was organised by the ITU however a nation wishing to compete must send a bid to the ITU at least 60 days before the competition. From all bids the ITU gives automatic qualification to the host nation, which as for the past five years has given immediate entry for the German team. The ITU also gives the top 11 nations (excluding the host) from the previous years championship automatic qualification. Then the best placed teams in each continental championship to not have already qualified gain a spot. After this all the remaining bids are listed in order of their results form their continental championship and the remaining spaces are filled from the best placed team. If any team should withdraw from the championship the best ranked team from their continent not to have qualified will replace them.\nRace report.\nGoing into the race the three favourites where the current title holders — the Australian team, the winners of the most recent mixed relay the - US team, and the French team due to the previous days performances in the individual races in Hamburg, with Vincent Luis placing second and Cassandre Beaugrand gaining her first ITU win.\nDuring the first swim the group had split in three with the UK and the Netherlands emerging a few seconds clear of a chasing group consisting of Mexico, the US, Hungary and Japan. However, over the course of the cycling all of the athletes regrouped to the point where five seconds separated first and last place. Over the first run not much separated the top contenders with the previous day's second place woman, Laura Lindermann, leading into the second leg. Over the swim and cycle of the second leg a leading pack of four emerged consisting of France, Germany, the UK and the US with a twenty-second advantage. Over the run the group shattered with Dorian Coninx of France pulling away and Jonas Schomburg of Germany falling back. Such was the split as at the start of the third leg where France had a six-second lead over second place and a twenty five second lead over third. During the swim and bike of the third leg the leading pack of four reformed but with Japan replacing Germany. Then the run the group again split with France leading. A large enough gap was never established with France two seconds ahead of the US in second, eleven seconds ahead of the UK in third and forty seconds clear of fifth place Australia. The gaps remained over the final swim until the bike leg where Luis of France took the lead from Kevin McDowell of the US. Similarly, Jacob Birtwhistle of Australia chased his way into third. Luis maintained his lead earning the win for France whilst Birtwhistle of Australia chased down McDowell overtaking him in the last 100m to take second for Australia, leaving third for the US."

He batted and threw right handed.\nBiography.\nBorn in the Washington, D.C. area, Tillman grew up following the Washington Senators team, while playing pick-up baseball games in the streets with his friends using a broomstick for a bat.\nLater, he played for minor black ball clubs before joining the Homestead Grays of the Negro National League, a powerhouse franchise that split its home games between Pittsburgh and Washington, D.C.\nFrom 1941 through 1943, Tillman was a backup for incumbent Josh Gibson, widely known as \"the Black Babe Ruth.\" Additionally, Tillman had the task of filling in for Gibson whenever the latter played in the Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League.\nAfterwards in 1947, Tillman played with the Charlotte Black Hornets of the Negro Carolina League before moving back to his homeland and playing with teams based in Rockville, Maryland (ACs) and Washington, D.C. (Aztecs). By then, Negro league teams began folding due to Major League Baseball recruiting of black players after Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947.\nAfter his playing days ended, Tillman joined the Chariot Singers, a gospel music group based in Washington, D.C. that performed at local churches. He also worked as a truck driver for W.D. Campbell Furniture Company. After settling in Capitol Heights, Maryland, he worked in D.C. florist shops, retiring once in 1982, then returning to work in 1984 before finally retiring in 2000.\nTillman eventually achieved local and national honors recognizing his contributions to the Negro leagues and the game of baseball. Among his contributions, Tillman delivered his first speech in 1998 to students of Cardozo Senior High School in the district. He later traveled to black baseball memorabilia events across the country in 2002 to sign autographs and meet baseball enthusiasts.\nTillman received his due recognition in February 2008, when he was honored by the U.S. Department of State during Black History Month. Four months later, he was selected by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the special draft of the surviving Negro league players, an event staged by Major League Baseball where each MLB club selected a former NLB player.\nTillman died in 2009 in Capitol Heights, Maryland at the age of 89, following complications from a stroke."

The union is the constituent body of the Rugby Football Union (RFU) for Berkshire, and administers and organises rugby union clubs and competitions in the county. It also administers the Berkshire county rugby representative teams.\nHistory.\nAlthough club sides had been existence in the county as early as the 1890s the Berkshire RFU did not form until 1931. A Berkshire representative side played the county's first competitive game in 1932 against Sussex but had to wait until January 1947 for the RFU to admit them to the County Championship, making their debut in the 1948 competition, where they reached the quarter-finals. In 1948 the Berkshire Society of Rugby Football Referees was formed by referees that lived locally, having previously belonged to the London Society, who had up until then also overseen games involving Berkshire clubs.\nWith the introduction of rugby union leagues in 1987, despite their closeness to London the majority of Berkshire clubs were placed in the south-west regional leagues, and up until the end of the century were grouped with Dorset and Wiltshire sides in a 3 tier Berks, Dorset &amp; Wilts league. In 1994 Dennis Easby (D H Easby) became the first ever member of the Berkshire RFU to be elected as the president of the national RFU. Formerly of Redingensians, where he had been club captain, Easby held the top job for the 1994-95 season. He died in 2017. For the 2000-01 season, the RFU restructured the leagues and Berks clubs in the south-west regional leagues were instead grouped with clubs from Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire.\nSenior county team.\nThe Berkshire senior men's team currently play in Division 3 of the County Championship. Their best result was in 2002 when they reached the final of the County Championship Plate (then known as the Shield), losing 12-34 to Warwickshire in the final at Twickenham Stadium.\nAffiliated clubs.\nThere are currently 16 clubs affiliated with the Berkshire RFU, with most teams having both senior and junior level teams with both boys and girls. 13 of these 16 clubs have voting rights - see notes below. The teams play in various competitive levels, from National 1 (Level 3) through to (Level 10) as well as IGR and social teams with most senior teams running between 1 and 4 teams. \nCounty club competitions.\nThe Berkshire RFU currently helps run the following club competitions: \nLeagues.\nSince 2000-01 the league system in this region is combined between three rugby football unions - Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire. Currently there are several divisions for first teams in the region including:\nAs well as leagues for second and third teams (currently no promotion into the English league system):\nCups.\nIn additions to senior men's cups, the Berkshire RFU county also run a woman's festival as well as a junior rugby competitions for clubs and schools (under-13 through to colts). Berkshire RFU also support the Reading Schools Rugby Competition (Un 12-16) as well as the Berkshire Schools Cup (which is run for ages U12 - U18)"

        "title": "List of highest individual scores in cricket",
        "text": "Cricket is a bat-and-ball game that originated in England around the 16th century. It is played between two teams, with each trying to score as many runs as they can, across one or two innings. Records for early cricket matches are incomplete and often non-existent, especially for very minor matches, but cricket historians have still attempted to trace the history of the \"highest single innings score by a batsman in any class of cricket\".\nJohn Minshull scored the first recorded century in 1769, scoring 107 runs. The record was broken twice in the following ten years, but then stood for almost 30 years before Lord Frederick Beauclerk scored 170 runs in 1806. William Ward scored 278 runs for the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1820 to claim the record, which was the last time that the highest score was made during a match regarded as being first-class. His record was surpassed by just one run in a minor match in Essex before Edward Tylecote scored the first quadruple century in cricket, accruing 404 runs during a House match at Clifton College. Three further quadruple centurions increased the record in the 1880s.\nIn 1899, A. E. J. Collins scored 628 runs in another House match at Clifton College to claim the record, in an innings which spanned four afternoons. His record stood for over 116 years, until Pranav Dhanawade became the first player outside of England to make a record score. Batting for his school in the HT Bhandary Challenge Trophy, Dhanawade scored 1,009 runs from just 327 balls.\nProgression of record.\nIn 1769, John Minshull scored the first recorded century (100 runs or more) in cricket. At the time, it was uncommon for a team's innings to be in excess of 100 runs, as the poor quality of the cricket pitches made batting difficult. Most matches were played on fields grazed by sheep, rather than dedicated cricket grounds. Playing for the Duke of Dorset's team against a team from Wrotham, Minshull scored 107 runs in his side's second innings. Only the scores for the Duke of Dorset's team are recorded, so the result of the match is not known. There is some contention that John Small might have scored a century prior to Minshull; in 1768 he was recorded to have scored 140 runs in a match between Hambledon Club and Kent, but it is unclear whether his score was from one innings, or the aggregate of his two innings.\nThe next recorded highest score was that of John Small; batting in July 1775 for Hambledon (playing as Hampshire) against Surrey, he scored either 136 or 138 runs. Some online scorecards, such as \"CricketArchive\" have recorded the score as 136, while others, along with a contemporary scorecard from the \"Reading Mercury\" list it as 138. Minshull was also taking part in this game, but only managed scores of seven and two. Hambledon scored heavily in their second innings; in addition to Small's century, Richard Nyren scored 97 runs and Thomas Brett scored 69. Hambledon won the match by 273 runs. This match is retrospectively considered to be of first-cricket standard, and is considered to be the first century scored in first-class cricket. Two years later, in a match in which both previous record holders were also playing, James Aylward scored 167 runs for Hambledon (again playing as Hampshire) against an \"All England\" side. Minshull made the next highest individual score in the match, remaining 60 not out in All England's first innings, but Aylward's score, along with six scores of between 20 and 50 from his teammates, helped Hambledon to victory by an innings and 168 runs.\nAylward's record appears to have stood for around 29 years, before being marginally beaten. Playing as a given man for Homerton against Montpelier in a one-day game, Lord Frederick Beauclerk scored 170 runs in Homerton's second innings. Homerton had suffered a first innings deficit of 54 runs; only one player had scored ten or more runs, while Beauclerk himself had only managed two. In their response, Beauclerk's large innings helped his side to a total of 265 runs, and a lead of 211 runs. Montpelier conceded defeat after scoring 74 runs for the loss of seven wickets in their second innings. Having moved from 107 runs to 170 runs in increments, the record then leapt to 278 runs in 1820. William Ward made the score while playing for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), alongside Beauclerk. Facing Norfolk, Ward scored his runs in the first innings to help the MCC to a total of 473 runs; Norfolk failed to score more than 100 in either of their batting efforts, and were beaten by 417 runs. The match is generally considered to be of first-class standard, and is the last time that the overall record was scored in first-class cricket. Ward's record was broken in 1837 in a match between two village teams. Playing in a single-innings one-day match, Alfred Adams opened the innings for Saffron Walden against Bishop's Stortford. Adams batted for most of the day to score 279 runs, beating Ward's record by just one run. Bishop's Stortford never got the chance to bat, as the Saffron Walden innings closed at seven in the evening, and the match was drawn."

The race was won by Sanne Cant of Belgium, winning her third consecutive title.\nRace report.\nDutch trio Denise Betsema, Marianne Vos and Annemarie Worst took the fastest start, leading after one lap with only defending champion Sanne Cant and her Belgian compatriot Ellen Van Loy able to follow. Lucinda Brand, who was tipped as big favorite prior to the race, was following in a second group some ten seconds behind, flanked by Jolanda Neff, Kaitlin Keough and Nikki Brammeier.\nTogether with Neff, Brand was able to close the gap to the leading group, where Van Loy had been dropped following a fall on one of the steeper slopes. Although slippery in some parts, overall the race was relatively straightforward, with long straight parts beside the windy coast of Denmark, causing the lead group to stay together for several laps. Betsema and Cant took turns leading the group, before Neff was the first to drop behind in lap four. Although this led to a situation of four Dutch riders against Belgian Sanne Cant, the Dutch never cooperated and all rode their individual race.\nDuring lap six, when leading the race and attempting a bike change, Brand fell as her left foot was still locked in the pedal while her bicycle was pulled out from under her by her mechanic (which later turned out to be her father). While she lost valuable seconds, Sanne Cant suddenly opened up a small gap between her and the four Dutch riders.\nGoing into the last lap, Cant lead with a six-second gap over Brand and Vos, with Betsema and Worst another seven seconds behind them. At that point, Keough and Neff were already over a minute back in sixth and seventh place. During the last lap, Brand soon opened a gap between her and Vos, but remained between four and ten seconds behind Cant, allowing Cant to win her third consecutive title. Brand was visibly disappointed in second place, Vos remained third."

It was first published in \"Asimov's Science Fiction\" in February 1985, then in June 1985 with a book edition. The title is from the poem of the same name by W. B. Yeats. The story, like the poem, deals with immortality, and includes quotations from the poem.\nStory summary.\nOn 50th-century Earth, people live in recreations of historical cities. Currently the cities are Chang-an, Asgard, New Chicago, Timbuctoo and Alexandria. They are periodically dismantled and replaced with a different city; there are never more than five. They are populated with \"temporaries\", who live as they would have done in the era of the city. \"Temporaries\" seem to have been created to provide the impression of realism.\nCharles Phillips and his partner Gioia are in ancient Alexandria. They visit the lighthouse and the library; he wonders if the buildings are reproductions or authentic. Phillips is from New York of the year 1984, and does not know how or why he is in the 50th century. Gioia's people never work: they see the sights during the day and go to parties in the evening. \nPhillips and Gioia soon move to Chang-an. They are guests of the Emperor, who, like most of those present at court, is a \"temporary\". He had the impression that Gioia's people do not age, and is surprised that she looks at some gray hairs she has, seeming to be worried about ageing. In the evening after the banquet he realizes he is with Belilala; Gioia has drifted away.\nMohenjo-daro has recently replaced one of the other cities. Belilala tells Phillips that Gioia is already there. She says Gioia is a \"short-timer\", one who ages, unlike most people; like all short-timers, Gioia is impatient to move on. They go to Mohenjo-daro, but he does not find her. There Phillips meets Francis Willoughby, from England of 1591, brought as a \"visitor\", like Phillips, to the 50th century.\nPhillips finds Gioia in New Chicago, a city of an era later than his. Not wishing him to see her looking older, she soon flees. He meets a \"visitor\", from Phillips's future, who tells him that visitors do not age, and explains that visitors are self-aware beings created by those who also created the cities and temporaries.\nAfter searching in other cities, Phillips finds Gioia again in Alexandria, looking still older. Both aware that she is aging and that Phillips is not, a solution is proposed. Phillips asks her to accompany him in search of those who supervise the world, creating the cities and visitors, so that Gioia's mind can be placed in an immortal visitor body. She agrees, and they set off in search of the supervisors. \nReception.\n\"Sailing to Byzantium\" won the Nebula Award for Best Novella in 1986. It was placed second in the Locus Award for Best Novella in that year, and it was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novella."

        "text": "William Bell, Jr. (July 30, 1930 – March 6, 2021) was a former pitcher who played in the Negro American League in all or part of four seasons spanning 1949–1954. Born in Des Moines, Iowa, he batted and threw left handed.\nCareer.\n'Bill Lefty', as he was nicknamed, was renowned for his ability to work the corners of the plate. He started his career with the Kansas City Monarchs in 1949, pitching with both the Monarchs and the Birmingham Black Barons in 1950 and continuing with the Monarchs until early 1951, when his career was interrupted for military service in the Korean War from 1951 to 1953.\nDuring service, Bell continued to pitching in games that were played between mixed teams of whites and blacks. Among others, he had teammates like Vernon Law and Syd Thrift, both Pittsburgh Pirates pitchers, as well as New York Giants outfielder Willie Mays. Following his discharge, Bell pitched briefly for the Monarchs in 1954.\nIn 2008, Major League Baseball staged a special draft of the surviving Negro league players, doing a tribute for the surviving Negro leaguers who were kept out of the Big Leagues because of their race. Hall of Fame Baseball player Dave Winfield hatched the idea to have this draft, which was held before the 2008 MLB Draft. MLB clubs each selected a former NLB player, and Bell was drafted as a pitcher by the Minnesota Twins.\nPersonal life.\nAfter his baseball days, Bell returned to his hometown of Des Moines, Iowa and worked in the U.S. Postal Service, serving in various supervisory and management positions during 34 years. In addition, he was the co-chairman of the Committee for Better Race Relations at Des Moines East High School between 1972 and 1974.\nBesides, Bell coached a local youth baseball team in the Babe Ruth League for three years, and guided the squad to one Iowa State tournament title.\nBell passed away on March 6, 2021. He was 90 years old."

        "text": "The 2021 NCAA Division I men's basketball championship game was the final game of the 2021 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament.\nThe Baylor Bears were crowned as the national champion for the 2020–21 season after beating the then-undefeated Gonzaga Bulldogs, 86–70. The game was played on April 5, 2021, at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, Indiana.\nGonzaga was the first team to enter the national championship game undefeated since Indiana State in 1979. Baylor became the second consecutive first-time NCAA champions following Virginia in 2019 (no tournament was held in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic).\nParticipants.\nThe championship game matched Baylor with Gonzaga. It was the sixth meeting between the two teams; Gonzaga entered the game leading the all-time series 5–0, with the last meeting resulting in an 83–71 win for Gonzaga in the second round of the 2019 NCAA tournament on March 23, 2019. This was the first championship game since 2005 to feature the top two overall seeds in the tournament.\nThis was the second consecutive championship game where both teams were playing for their programs' first NCAA title. It was also the first championship game to feature two private schools since Duke defeated Butler in 2010.\nBaylor Bears.\nBaylor, led by 18th-year head coach Scott Drew, finished the regular season with a record of 21–1, including wins over seven ranked teams. The Bears posted a 13–1 conference record, earning them the No. 1 seed in the Big 12 tournament, where they defeated No. 9 seed Kansas State in the quarterfinals before falling to No. 5 seed Oklahoma State in the semi-finals. They were awarded an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament and received the No. 1 seed in the South Regional. In the tournament, they defeated No. 16 seed Hartford and No. 9 seed Wisconsin to reach their fifth Sweet Sixteen. The Bears then defeated No. 5 seed Villanova and No. 3 seed Arkansas to win the South Regional and reach their third Final Four.\nIn the Final Four, Baylor soundly defeated No. 2 seed Houston, champions of the Midwest Regional, by a score of 78–59 to reach their second national title game; they entered seeking their first championship.\nGonzaga Bulldogs.\nGonzaga, led by 22nd-year head coach Mark Few, finished the regular season with a perfect record of 24–0, including wins over four ranked teams. The Bulldogs posted a 15–0 conference record, earning them the No. 1 seed in the West Coast tournament, where they defeated No. 4 seed Saint Mary's and No. 2 seed BYU to win their 19th conference tournament championship. They received the No. 1 overall seed in the NCAA tournament and were placed in the West Regional. In the tournament, they defeated No. 16 seed Norfolk State and No. 8 seed Oklahoma to advance to their 11th Sweet Sixteen. Gonzaga then faced and defeated No. 5 seed Creighton and No. 6 seed USC to move to the Final Four for the second time.\nIn the Final Four, Gonzaga was matched up with No. 11 seed UCLA, the champions of the East Regional. A 3-point buzzer beater in overtime by Jalen Suggs won the game for the Bulldogs and gave Gonzaga their second national championship berth in program history; they entered seeking their first national title and the first unbeaten season in NCAA Division I men's basketball since Indiana in 1976.\nGame summary.\nAfter winning the jump ball, Baylor controlled much of the first half. The Bears jumped out to an early 9–0 lead with multiple baskets each from Davion Mitchell and Jared Butler before Gonzaga's Andrew Nembhard scored a free throw. Gonzaga's first field goal came nearly five minutes into the game, with Corey Kispert's three-pointer that narrowed the lead back to nine, after a Mitchell jumper pushed the lead to double digits. A layup by Jonathan Tchamwa Tchatchoua and a three-pointer by Butler pushed the lead to 12 points; shortly thereafter, a Drew Timme layup and a pair of Adam Flagler free throws kept the margin where it was, though it was extended to 15 within the next minute. Over the following several minutes, Baylor was able to take advantage of excellent offensive rebounding and Gonzaga turnovers to push the lead to 19, its highest point in the half and the largest deficit Gonzaga had faced all season. During the second part of the opening half, the game was much more even; Gonzaga was able to gradually chip away at the lead, with a last-second layup at the end of the half cutting the deficit to 10 at the break.\nThe second half started similarly to the first, though both teams came out scoring this time. The Bears increased their lead to 15 within the first two minutes, and Gonzaga again narrowed it to single digits momentarily with 14:30 to play. The teams traded scores for the next minute and a half, getting the score to 62–51 in favor of the Bears, before Baylor went on an 11–1 run, pushing the score to a game-high 20 points. Both teams began to see foul trouble affect them, as Baylor's Flo Thamba fouled out with 8:40 to play and Gonzaga's Timme was temporarily benched after accumulating four fouls shortly before. Baylor controlled the ball well throughout the half, committing their first second-half turnover with only eight minutes to play. The Bears kept the lead between 15 and 20 as the teams alternated scores over the remainder of the game. With around a minute to play, both teams substituted out most of their starters, and Baylor was able to run the remainder of the clock out to win their first national championship.\nMedia coverage.\nThe championship game was televised in the United States by CBS. Jim Nantz provided play-by-play, while Bill Raftery and Grant Hill provided color commentary. Tracy Wolfson served as the sideline reporter.\nThe broadcast was the least-watched national championship ever shown on broadcast television, as it pulled in 16.92 million viewers on CBS for an average rating of 9.4. This marked a 14% viewership decline from the last men's national championship broadcast, in 2019 between Virginia and Texas Tech.\nAftermath.\nThe win gave Baylor their first national championship in school history, and denied Gonzaga their first title and the first NCAA Division I men's basketball perfect season since Indiana in 1976. The loss was Gonzaga's first and only of the season, as they ended the year with a 31–1 record, while Baylor improved to 28–2 with the victory. After the game, Baylor coach Scott Drew was presented with the national championship trophy, and Bears guard Jared Butler was named the Most Outstanding Player of the NCAA tournament. Baylor's win was widely considered an upset, with Gonzaga considered a \"massive favorite\" to win the title by ESPN and Yahoo!'s platforms. Gonzaga never led during the game, and their 70 points were the fewest they had scored all season; the Bulldogs entered the championship averaging 91.6 points per game, the best in the nation. In addition, this was also Baylor's first win over Gonzaga in program history; they were 0–5 in previous meetings. Baylor also became the first team from the state of Texas to win the national championship since Texas Western in 1966."

Until 1967, the tournament was known as South American Championship. It is the oldest continental championship in the world with its first edition held in 1916.\nBolivia participated for the first time in 1926, but it took 23 years (26 matches) until their first victory.\n1963 was a special year for Bolivia in tournament history. The country not only hosted the South American Championship for the first time. The two host cities, Cochabamba and La Paz, both lie in Andean valleys and are at a much higher altitude than large parts of the continent. With the thin air as a major home advantage, Bolivia won the tournament unbeaten and earned their first and only international title. Forward Ramiro Blacut is the only Bolivian to be awarded an individual trophy when he was honoured as best player of the tournament that same year.\nWith a notable exception in 1997, when Bolivia reached the final in their second-ever home tournament, the team has been hugely unsuccessful in the past decades. From 1999 to 2021, they only won a single match (3–2 vs Ecuador in 2015).\nOverall record.\nBolivia missed out on the first nine South American championships (1916–1925) because the FBF was only founded in 1926.\n1963 South American Championship.\nBolivia played their first match of the tournament against Ecuador. After they had given away an early 2–0 leading to a 2–4 deficit after 50 minutes, the match ended in a 4–4 draw. Subsequently, the Bolivian hosts won their matches against Colombia (2–1), Peru (3–2), Paraguay (2–0) and Argentina (3–2).\nThe table after five out of six match days looked as follows.\nStill to play:\n - ,\nBecause a victory gave two points at the time, only Paraguay was able to put pressure on Bolivia on the last day of the tournament. In case of equal points, a play-off would have been held. In order to secure the title, Bolivia would have to earn at least as many points in their match against Brazil as Paraguay would in their match against Argentina.\nThe Paraguay match in La Paz ended 1–1, which meant Bolivia also needed at least a draw.\nMatch details\nIn spite of Brazil equalizing a two-goal lead twice, Bolivia secured the victory and the tournament title, two points ahead of Paraguay.\nRecord by opponent.\nBolivia's highest victory at a Copa América is a 4–0 win against Colombia in 1949. A 1–10 defeat against Brazil in the same tournament, along with a 0–9 defeat against Uruguay at the 1927 edition, are Bolivia's highest defeats of all time.\nAwards and records.\nTeam Awards\nIndividual Awards\nTeam Records"

At each stop a qualifying was held on the first day of the competition, and the semi-final and final rounds were conducted on the second day of the competition.

At the end of the season an overall ranking was determined based upon points, which athletes were awarded for finishing in the top 30 of each individual event.\nJanja Garnbret won the women's seasonal title, winning all six competitions of the season in the process, an achievement which had never been accomplished before.

Janja Garnbret (3T4z 6 6) won in front of Akiyo Noguchi (3T4z 9 12) as the only two athletes to top the final boulder.

Tomoa Narasaki (3T4z 5 6) came in second and Anže Peharc (3T4z 10 10) finished in third place.\nWujiang, China (4–5 May).\nWomen.\n83 athletes attended the World Cup in Wujiang. 2018 overall Bouldering World Cup winner Miho Nonaka attended her first World Cup of the season, returning from a shoulder injury. Nonaka (2T4z 4 7) finished in fourth place. Janja Garnbret (4T4z 5 4) won her fourth straight World Cup while Akiyo Noguchi (3T4z 4 5) won Silver and 15-year old Ai Mori (3T4z 11 9) took the Bronze medal in her first World Cup final appearance.\nMen.\n97 athletes attended the World Cup in Wujiang. None of the previous World Cup winners of the season managed to advance to the final round. Chonqing runner-up Tomoa Narasaki (3T4z 7 8) won the competition in front of Kai Harada (3T4z 7 13). Jakob Schubert (1T4z 2 9) and Keita Dohi (1T4z 2 9) had identical final scores. Schubert was awarded the bronze medal by virtue of his better semi-final performance.\nMunich, Germany (18–19 May).\nWomen.\n89 athletes attended the World Cup in Munich. Most climbers from the Japanese team, including stars such as Miho Nonaka and Akiyo Noguchi, were absent, opting to train for the combined instead. With Noguchi absent it was clear even before the competition was held, that the seasonal title would go to Janja Garnbret. Nonetheless Garnbret dominated the competition, topping all four semi-final boulders where of the other athletes only Ievgeniia Kazbekova could find a single top on a boulder. In the final Garnbret (4T4z 5 5) and Fanny Gibert (4T4z 8 6) topped all four boulders, but Garnbret won by number of attempts. Garnbret thus won her third consecutive title in Munich and the fifth consecutive title of the season, which will have her finish the season on the maximum points attainable (500) regardless of her result in Vail. The bronze medal went to Mia Krampl (3T3z 9 9) who climbed through the final despite a knee injury.\nMen.\n119 athletes attended the World Cup in Munich. Most climbers from the Japanese team, including stars such as Tomoa Narasaki, Rei Sugimoto and Kai Harada, were absent, opting to train for the combined instead. In the final Adam Ondra flashed the first three boulders, leading the competition in front of Jakob Schubert on two tops and three zones. However, Ondra (3T3z 3 3) could not find a zone on the final boulder whereas Schubert (3T4z 7 8) had topped, thus winning the competition. German Jan Hojer won bronze, making his first podium since his win in Munich two years before.\nVail, United States (7–8 June).\nWomen.\n55 athletes attended the World Cup in Vail. Several strong athletes decided not to attend including Shauna Coxsey, Jessica Pilz, and all of the Slovenian team aside from Janja Garnbret. Garnbret had already secured the overall seasonal title, but could become the first climber ever to make a complete sweep of a bouldering season, winning all World Cups.\nJanja reached the final and completed boulders one and two. Going into the third boulder Garnbret, Akiyo Noguchi and Miho Nonaka had each topped number one and two while Fanny Gibert, Mao Nakamura, and Luce Douady had all failed to top the second boulder. Garnbret had fallen behind on number of attempts, however. As Nonaka and Noguchi could not find a top on the third boulder Garnbret seized the chance to take the lead, which put her in a position where she was guaranteed the victory if she could find a top on the final problem. When Noguchi completed the final problem it was clear that Garnbret would indeed have to match the top for the win. Ultimately Janja (4T4z 9 8) flashed the final boulder and secured her sixth straight win, completing the first sweep of a Bouldering World Cup season. Noguchi (3T4z 5 6) came in second and Gibert (2T4z 3 9) finished third.\nMen.\n57 athletes attended the World Cup in Vail. Adam Ondra went into the competition with a 21-point lead over Tomoa Narasaki in the World Cup standings, meaning that Ondra would win the seasonal title if he finished in first or second place regardless of Narasaki's finish.\nOndra and Narasaki both made it to the final of the Vail competition along with Yoshiyuki Ogata, Jongwon Chon, Jan Hojer, and Sean McColl. All athletes but McColl found tops on the first two boulders. Ondra did not make it to the zone on the third, though, whereas Narasaki and Ogata completed the problem. The final boulder was only topped by Yoshiyuki Ogata (4T4z 11 9) who won his first bouldering World Cup being the only athlete to top all final boulders. Tomoa Narasaki (3T4z 5 5) came in second while Adam Ondra (2T3z 3 4) finished fifth, which allowed Narasaki to overtake Ondra in the World Cup standings and claim the seasonal title. Jongwon Chon (3T4z 6 7) won the bronze medal, his first medal since his win in Navi Mumbai almost two years before."

        "text": "The 2019–20 Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball team represented the University of Arkansas during the 2019–20 season. The team was led by first-year head coach Eric Musselman, and played their home games at Bud Walton Arena in Fayetteville, Arkansas as a member of the Southeastern Conference. The Razorbacks finished with a record of 20–12 (7–11), with junior Mason Jones earning a share of the SEC Player of the Year award and being named a consensus First-Team All-SEC player.\nArkansas started the season strongly, going into conference play with an 11–1 record, including two road wins against Power Five teams, Georgia Tech and Indiana. The first quarter of conference play was promising for the Razorbacks, with the only setback coming on the road against LSU, 79–77. Heading into a highly anticipated home game with #10 Kentucky, the Hogs were 14–2, with a 3–1 conference record. Arkansas led with less than nine minutes left in the game when Kentucky head coach John Calipari was ejected, sparking a Kentucky run and victory. From there the season bottomed out, with the Hogs finishing the last fourteen games of the conference season with a record of 4–10 for a final regular season record of 19–12 (7–11), including a five-game losing streak without star guard Isaiah Joe that featured back-to-back overtime losses for the first time in school history, in addition to a one-point loss. Heading into the last quarter of the conference season, Arkansas avenged earlier losses to Missouri and Tennessee, placing the Hogs back on the bubble, but fell on the road to thirteenth-place Georgia, effectively knocking the Razorbacks out of tournament contention. After splitting the last two games of the season at home against LSU and on the road against Texas A&amp;M, the Hogs were on the outside looking in, most likely needing to win the SEC tournament to receive an NCAA tournament bid. \nAfter winning their first-round game against Vanderbilt on March 11, 2020, the Hogs were slated for a rematch against South Carolina in the second round, but the SEC announced on March 12, 2020, that the SEC Tournament was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with an announcement following from the NCAA later that day that the whole tournament was cancelled, along with all other winter and spring championships, ending the Razorbacks' season.\nThe Razorbacks received some votes for the AP Poll throughout the non-conference season, but never earned a ranking, and stopped receiving votes by the end of January. \nMason Jones was voted the SEC Player of the Year by the league media, sharing the honor with Reggie Perry, a Mississippi State player and former Arkansas commit, while the coaches' award went to Immanuel Quickley, of Kentucky. Jones was the third Razorback to win the award, along with Bobby Portis and Corliss Williamson. Jones had an outstanding season, being named SEC Player of the Week four times, one of three SEC players to ever do so and the first in over a decade. Jones led the SEC in scoring, becoming the first Razorback to claim the SEC scoring title, while also finishing ranked eighth in the country for points per game. Jones led the NCAA in both free throw attempts and makes, while also having nine thirty-point games, the most by an SEC player in two decades. Jones broke Sidney Moncrief's school record for free throws made in a season, in addition to being one of only three players in the previous thirty years to score forty points in a game multiple times in a season. Jones was named a consensus First-Team All-SEC player, the tenth time an Arkansas player has achieved that honor. Jones was also named an Honorable Mention All-American by the Associated Press (AP).\nPrevious season.\nOn March 26, 2019, Arkansas athletic director Hunter Yurachek fired former head coach Mike Anderson. Following a 12-day search, Yurachek announced Musselman's hiring on April 7.\nFormer guard Keyshawn Embery-Simpson had already announced following Anderson's firing that he would be leaving the school and transferring to Tulsa.\nOffseason.\nIncoming Transfers.\nJamario Bell would also join the team with one year of eligibility after his career with the Arkansas football team ended.\nPreseason.\nSEC media poll.\nThe SEC media poll was released on October 15, 2019.\nPreseason All-SEC teams.\nThe Razorbacks had one player selected to the preseason all-SEC teams.\nSecond Team\nIsaiah Joe\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=|Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=|Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=| SEC Tournament"

        "title": "Archery Contest of Diana and her Nymphs",
        "text": "The Archery Contest of Diana and Her Nymphs is a 1616 oil-on-canvas painting by the Italian artist Domenichino. The painting is also known as \"Diana and her Nymphs after the Hunt,\" \"Diana Hunting,\" and even \"The Hunt of Diana.\" It was commissioned by Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini, but was stolen from him by Cardinal Scipione Borghese. It is now in the Galleria Borghese in Rome, Italy.\nArtist.\nDomenichino was born Domenico Zampieri in Bologna, Italy in the year 1581. Domenichino was a student of Flemish art, and studied under the artist Denys Calvaert, until he moved to Rome where he worked in the teams employed by the Carracci, including the frescoes designed by Annibale for the Palazzo Farnese where he acquired the nickname Domenichino, meaning little Domenico. He then became a favored assistant to Annibale Carracci himself. Domenichino was later commissioned by both Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini and Cardinal Scipione Borghese.\nThis painting was completed after Domenichino had done a large series of frescoes between 1612 and 1615 on Saint Cecilia. At this point he was developing his own style, distinct from that of the Carracci. The classical style that is now associated with Domenichino had stemmed from this series.\nCommission.\nPietro Aldobrandini.\nThis painting was originally commissioned by Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini and was meant to complement the Titian paintings already owned by the Cardinal. However the Titian paintings were not originally owned or commissioned by Aldobrandini.\nPietro Aldobrandini was the nephew of Pope Clement VIII. However, once the Borghese family rose to power, Pope Clement VIII, along with his family, fell from favor. Aldobrandini used art as a way to escape from every day stresses of being a cardinal. He was an avid collector of both Titian and Annibale Carracci. This explains Pietro Aldobrandini's interest in Domenichino's works, as he was a student of Carracci. Aldobrandini's collection of Titian works came from confiscated goods after the d'Este family was annexed from Rome and featured \"The Worship of Venus\" and \"The Bacchanal of the Andrians\".\nScipione Borghese.\nAfter the death of Pope Clement VIII, Pope Paul V took over the church. His nephew, Scipione Caffarella, not content with only being the nephew of the pope, was eventually adopted by the pope, therefore becoming Scipione Borghese.\nThe animosity between Scipione Borghese and Pietro Aldobrandini stemmed from Borghese being the successor as Cardinal-nephew after Aldobrandini. The Borghese family also supported many artists throughout their time in power. Scipione possessed many mythological works, including works of the Muses by Giovanni Baglione to complement his collection. The majority of the Borghese collection was forcefully acquired from other artists and patrons after they had been either exiled or stripped of power and wealth.\nWhile this work had initially been commissioned by Pietro Aldobrandini, Scipione approached the painter, and urged him to complete the commission for him. Loyal to the Aldobrandini family, Domenichino refused. He was promptly imprisoned by Borghese.\nSubject matter.\nAs the title states, the subject matter is that of a mythological scene depicting Diana, the goddess of the hunt, the moon, virginity, and wild animals This painting shows Domenichino's capability with landscape painting as well as his knowledge and familiarity with antiquity art styles. The men within the painting serve as allegories, representing all manner of things; namely, spying, lust, risk, and ultimately, the danger that they are putting themselves in due to their own actions.\nRegarding the nymphs, there is one in the water that is looking directly at the viewer. This is Domenichino's way of bringing the audience into the painting, breaking down the barrier of viewer and subject. The nymph is smiling, as if she has caught the viewer in the bushes, watching this scene play out, therefore likening the viewer to the men in the painting.\nDiana is most easily identifiable in this painting due to the upside-down crescent moon tiara on her head. Normally, she can also be identified by her bow and quiver of arrows.\nSource material.\nThe painting depicts, as the title states, an archery contest with the goddess Diana and the nymphs that were her followers. As discussed in many classical sources such as Virgil's \"Aeneid,\" Hesiod's \"Theogony\" as well as Homer's epic poem \"The\" \"Iliad\", this scene is depicting the goddess and the others after a hunt. Diana was often depicted in texts and works as a child, rather than a grown woman. Similarly, her nymphs were often portrayed in the same way as the goddess's blessing kept them from aging.\nStyle.\nDomenichino's style is heavily based on nature, as he believed that to be the critical foundation for all artworks. Moreover, he heavily studied the forms of antique sculptures to influence his way of depicting the human figure. This also accounts to his attention to detail to illustrate these figures in the clothing of the time that the painting takes place, rather than the clothing that the artist would have seen in his days. Domenichino believed that depicting large scale events was the proper way to immerse the viewer into the work, rather than simply telling the bones of the story. The chaotic nature of the scene explains how the men were able to sneak up to spy on the goddess and her followers. There are now many themes at work in this painting; a historic scene, a landscape, and a lesson being taught. His works of art paired well with those of Titian.\nHistorical context.\nPapal nephews in Rome.\nEarly in a pope's reign, they would appoint their nephews, typically their closest male relative, to a high position of power. These papal nephews, or Cardinal-Nephews, were often given authority but not much to oversee. Therefore, they frequently became important patrons of the arts. At this time however, nepotism was a significant problem in the Church. As was seen with Scipione Borghese, the power often was not enough for those as nephews and they demanded more. Allowing the family of the pope and unelected or under-qualified officials into these positions of power more often led to superfluous spending of the church's money.\nRoman collecting of mythological works.\nDomenichino's studies of Flemish art shows a larger theme of the seventeenth century. At this time the most common themes of art were religious or mythological. Depicting mythology at this time was a way of showing how well educated one was, as this often required reading the myths in their original language. Mythological art was often held in private residences as it could be seen as going against the church with its pagan depictions. When a guest was waiting for the person of the house to arrive, or when guests were over for large celebrations, this strategically displayed art allowed others to see the knowledge, and more specifically, the power and authority that these patrons held."

        "title": "Gran Turismo World Series",
        "text": "The Gran Turismo World Series (also referred to as the GTWS) is a series of professional \"Gran Turismo\" world championship esports tournaments, managed directly by Japanese game development studio Polyphony Digital. The championship contains two series that are held concurrently throughout the year: the Nations Cup (entrants from their respective countries will represent them) and the Manufacturers Cup (entrants will race for and represent their chosen manufacturer). The series uses Polyphony Digital's latest racing video game \"Gran Turismo 7\".\nThrough 2018 to 2021, the Gran Turismo World Series was previously sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile. Polyphony Digital's partnership with the FIA is currently on hiatus.\nThe Nations Cup and Manufacturers Cup trophies are laser-scanned reproductions of Italian sculptor Umberto Boccioni's 1913 bronze futurist sculpture \"Unique Forms of Continuity in Space\", chosen by Polyphony Digital as it represents the “surprise and fascination of machines first discovered by mankind”, and also shares values held by the \"Gran Turismo\" series. Players are given a plaque for their participation in the series during live events and by the end of the year. Players who finish in the Top 3 in any series receive a gold plaque and a trophy. Players were also formerly given a TAG Heuer watch, but no longer became a prize after their partnership with Polyphony ended in 2020; a set of Sony Alpha photography equipment were given out that year, followed by a set of BBS wheels for 2021.\nToyota, Genesis, Mazda, Michelin, Brembo, Sony Alpha, BBS, and Fanatec serve as the series partners of the World Series. The series is provided with clothing by Puma and peripherals by Fanatec. All virtual races in the tournament take place in specified locations all around the globe. In addition to the live studio audiences at the specified locations, the tournaments are streamed live in YouTube through several languages. The series has since made an impact in real-world motorsport, serving as a basis for virtual players in terms of possibly starting a career in esports before jumping into real-world motorsport.\nHistory.\nPolyphony Digital announced its partnership with governing body Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile in June 2014 to provide a more realistic racing experience in virtual motorsport. It permitted the Japanese studio to feature content certified by the FIA and launch an online championship in \"Gran Turismo 6\" for the following year in 2015. It would be the earliest example of an official online championship managed by Polyphony Digital and sanctioned by the FIA. The following year in 2016, Polyphony and the FIA announced the formation of the FIA-Certified Gran Turismo Championships (FIA GTC).\nThe FIA GTC was established in \"Gran Turismo Sport\" shortly after the game's release. Many test seasons ran from 2017 to 2018, and the first official season commenced that year. The first World Tour was also held at Nürburgring, which saw Giorgio Mangano from Italy as the first Nations Cup event winner, and Philippe Nicolay, Matthew Thomas, and Anthony Duval, representing BMW as the first Manufacturer Series event winners. Former FIA Formula 3 Championship driver Igor Fraga became the inaugural Nations Cup champion in 2018, and Kanata Kawakami, Vincent Rigaud, and Tyrell Meadows also became the inaugural Manufacturer Series champions that year. As part of the FIA's involvement as a sanctioning body for the series, the champions were also honoured at the FIA Prize Giving Ceremony.\nThe format for the series changed in 2021 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. All previously planned live events were dropped, and the season would instead be held online.\nThe series transferred over to \"Gran Turismo 7\" for the 2022 season. Polyphony's partnership with the FIA was also put on hiatus that year, with FIA's Director of Innovative Sporting Projects, Frederic Bertrand, stating that they would resume the collaboration once \"Gran Turismo 7\" becomes a sufficiently stable platform. As a result, the FIA name was dropped, and the tournament was renamed to the Gran Turismo World Series (GTWS). Two live events were reintroduced as part of the 2022 season, with the series returning to Hangar-7 in Salzburg, Austria for the Showdown and Monte-Carlo Sporting in Monte Carlo, Monaco for the World Finals.\nThe tournament has also hosted exhibition races since 2019. One of these exhibition races is known as 'Pro-Am', where competitors of the series would pair with various personalities, spanning from content creators to professional racing drivers, including former Formula One driver Juan Pablo Montoya and seven-time Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton. Exhibition races have also been hosted by Sony's artificial intelligence department, Sony AI, where select series drivers race against their agent known as 'Gran Turismo Sophy', developed in collaboration by Sony AI, Sony Interactive Entertainment, and Polyphony Digital. This race is also used as a testing ground for Sony's AI team to evaluate Sophy's pace and behaviour on the race track.\nFormat.\n2018 season.\nBefore the \"Online Series\" is started, every season begins with a \"World Tour\" event, containing the top drivers from the season prior. The winner from the World Tour event gains direct access to the \"World Final\" event.\nA phase dubbed as the \"Online Series\", which is essentially a qualification phase to decide the participants that will race in the live events of the championship tournament, kicks off every season. The Online Series is divided into four stages, with each stage hosting ten rounds. By the end of each stage, another World Tour event is hosted, which includes the top players from that stage instead of the top drivers from the previous season. The top players who are selected after the series must sign an application form in order to be able to participate for the World Tour events, and they must also be over 18. The Online Series goes on for five to seven months.\nThe \"Live Events\" begin after the Online Series. The Nations Cup category includes the top 90 players (30 per region) with the highest points across all four stages. Three different live events occur, with each live event carrying a specific world region. The top 10 players from those regions enter the \"World Final\" event, a championship stage to decide the number one player. The Manufacturer Series category includes the top 48 players (three players per region) and 16 manufacturers with the highest points across all four stages. The top players and manufacturers participate in the \"World Final\" event, to decide the top three players and the number one manufacturer. The winners of their respective series at the \"World Final\" are crowned either Nations Cup champion or Manufacturer Series champion.\n2020 season.\nFormat changes during COVID-19 pandemic.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was announced that the 2020 World Finals would be held as an online-based event.\nFurther format changes were made for 2021, where the online season (named World Series) was divided into six online races (replacing the physical World Tours), four of them containing one race for Nations Cup and Manufacturer Series, plus the mid-season \"Showdown\" playoff races and the grand finals, which were aired as tape delayed streams. The first two World Series races featured top competitors from the previous season (16 Nations Cup drivers and 12 Manufacturer Series players that chose the same manufacturer as with the previous season, with limit of one player per brand), after which they would race together against top players from the first half of the online qualifiers (the in-game races accessible to the general public) in the Showdown to determine who would advance to the next two stages. Players that advanced to the third and fourth round would then face opponents that qualified in the second half of the online qualifiers through the same criteria in the grand finals.\n2023 season.\nThe Nations Cup format saw a switch from a single-driver series to a team-based event, a format previously used by Polyphony Digital in 2018 at the Hangar-7 World Tour.\nThe online season was divided into fourteen online races (seven rounds per series), in which top players would race against each other to determine who would qualify for both the Showdown event in August and for the World Tour grand finals in December. For the new team-based Nations Cup format, entries were decided based on the highest finishing players affiliated with their country in the points standings. The top three competitors of each country would form the lineup for their respective team.\nEvents with live audiences also returned in 2023 for the first time since the 2020 Sydney World Tour event, with the Showdown round in Theater Amsterdam at Amsterdam, the Netherlands.\nLeagues.\nPlayers can participate in the Online Series from within the Sport mode of \"Gran Turismo 7\". Players that register are separated in three leagues based on in-game driver rating; 'GT1 League' with a driver rating of A and higher, 'GT2 League' with a driver rating of B, and 'GT3 League' with a driver rating of C and lower. However, only those in the GT1 League are eligible for participation in the World Series and World Finals live events.\nIn other media.\nWorld Series drivers including previous champions Igor Fraga, Mikail Hizal, Takuma Miyazono, Tomoaki Yamanaka, Valerio Gallo, Coque López, and Daniel Solis appear in \"Gran Turismo 7\" as AI opponents and License Test coaches.\nMedia coverage.\nThe World Series races are usually streamed live from Dock10 studios on YouTube and Twitch under the official \"Gran Turismo\" and PlayStation channels, and are available to watch through several languages.\nSeries champions.\nThere have been five different Nations Cup champions and eleven different individual Manufacturers Series champions since the series' foundation, in addition to four different winners in the Toyota GR GT Cup.\nIgor Fraga from Brazil, along with Tomoaki Yamanaka and Takuma Miyazono from Japan, and Daniel Solis from the United States, hold the most individual Manufacturer Series titles with two each, Fraga and Yamanaka for Toyota, and Miyazono and Solis for Subaru. Fraga and Miyazono hold the most championship titles in total with four, each holding one Toyota GR GT Cup title, one Nations Cup title, and two individual Manufacturer Series titles. Miyazono scored a treble in 2020 by winning the Toyota GR GT Cup and both GT World Series championships. Coque López from Spain became the first repeat Nations Cup champion after scoring a second consecutive Nations Cup championship title in 2023 alongside his compatriots José Serrano and Pol Urra, the latter of whom also won that year's Toyota GR GT Cup championship.\nIgor Fraga, Mikail Hizal, Takuma Miyazono, and Coque López are the only World Series champions to have won both the Nations Cup and Manufacturer Series championships. Fraga is also the only participant to have won a championship in both the Gran Turismo World Series and real-world motorsport."

        "text": "The 2019–20 Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball team represented the University of Cincinnati in the 2019–20 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The Bearcats were led by first-year head-coach John Brannen. The team played their home games at Fifth Third Arena as members of the American Athletic Conference.\nPrevious season.\nThe Bearcats finished the 2018–19 season 28–7, 14–4 in AAC play, finishing in second place. They defeated SMU, Wichita State, and No. 1 seed Houston to win the AAC tournament for the second consecutive year, and received the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. As the No. 7 seed in the South region, they were upset by No. 10 seed Iowa in the first round. After the conclusion of the NCAA tournament, head coach Mick Cronin accepted the head-coaching position at UCLA. John Brannen, the head coach at nearby Northern Kentucky, would be hired to replace Cronin. In the transition, UC lost G/F Rashawn Fredericks and C Nysier Brooks - both of whom would've both been seniors. They also lost sophomore guard Logan Johnson and backup PF Eliel Nsoseme. Incoming freshman and Ohio's Mr. Basketball in 2019, Samari Curtis, also de-committed. Jarron Cumberland announced he would test the waters to enter the 2019 NBA draft on April 20, 2019. On May 27, Cumberland announced he would return for his senior season.\nDespite the deluge of transfers, Brannen was able to inspire a late-season recruiting renaissance, as he moved quickly to land Jeremiah Davenport, Chris Vogt, Mika Adams-Woods, Chris McNeal, Jaume Sorolla, and Jaevin Cumberland (in that order) - with the latter four commitments transpiring in under one week's time. It is worth noting that, at the time of the final scholarship being fulfilled, both Logan Johnson and Eliel Nsoseme were still in the transfer protocol and technically \"could\" return to UC; this series of signings effectively locked in their transfer from the program.\nAfter all the dust settled, UC would have a final transfer enter the portal in redshirt Freshman LaQuill Hardnett. His spot would be filled shortly thereafter by the highest rated recruit of the 2019 class, Zach Harvey. Entering this season, new scholarship players would now outnumber returning players 7-6.\nPreseason.\nAAC media poll.\nThe AAC media poll was released on October 14, 2019, with the Bearcats predicted to finish third in the AAC.\nPreseason Awards.\nAmerican Athletic Conference\nSporting News\nRoster.\nDepth chart.\nSource\nSchedule and results.\nThe Bearcats traveled to in-state rival Ohio State to open the season for the second part of a home-and-home series with the Buckeyes.

        "text": "One city initially submitted a bid to host the 1959 Pan American Games that was recognized by the Pan American Sports Organization (PASO), along with three cities that withdrew their bids. On March 11, 1955, at the IV Pan American Congress in Mexico City, PASO selected Cleveland unanimously to host the III Pan American Games.\nOn April 15, 1957, Cleveland asked PASO to be relieved of their assignment as the host city. Subsequently, both Guatemala City and Rio de Janeiro informed PASO that they would not be able to host the games either. Two cities came forward as candidates host the games, Chicago and São Paulo, and on August 3, 1957, Chicago was selected over São Paulo by a vote of 13 to 6.\nFirst host city selection.\nOn March 11, 1955, PASO decided by unanimous vote to hold the games in Cleveland city after Guatemala, Chile, and Brazil withdrew the proposal they had presented to be held in their respective countries. At the same time, the committee decided that the 1963 Pan American Games would be held in a city in Latin America.\nWithdrew bid.\nGuatemala City, Rio de Janeiro, and Santiago all withdrew their accepted bids prior to the final voting date.\nInterested cities.\nDetroit, Houston, and Los Angeles showed interest in holding the Games.\nCleveland is forced to withdraw.\nAs Cleveland was making all the necessary preparations to hold the 1959 Games, all of the various sporting venues were approved. It was estimated that the total cost for all the new facilities would be $11 million. In order to fund the games, the financing plan proposed that $2 million would be obtained from the City of Cleveland, $3 million from Cuyahoga County, $1 million from the State of Ohio, and $5 million from the United States Federal Government.\nBy early 1957, the city, county, and state all approved the proposed funding, but the Federal Government had yet to approve the funding. The United States was making a movement to reduce taxes by imposing a restriction on the national budget; because of this, it became abundantly clear that Cleveland would not receive the funding necessary to build the required facilities. On March 15, 1957, the PASO organized a special session of the Congress of the Pan American Sports Organization in Caracas, Venezuela. In this meeting, the organization set a deadline of May 1, 1957 for Cleveland to show that it would have all of its finances in order. It was also at this meeting that PASO approved Guatemala City to be the first alternate and Rio de Janeiro to be the second alternate, should Cleveland be forced to withdraw its hosting rights. On April 15, 1957, Cleveland was forced to ask PASO to be relieved of its assignment as host city.\nThe Pan American Sports Organization asked Guatemala City to be the new host city for the Games, but on May 15, 1957, Roberto Castaneda, an assistant to President of Guatemala Carlos Castillo Armas, informed PASO at a meeting in Caracas that, due to a national election that was scheduled to be held in Spring 1959 and the fact that the city would need a $5 million grant in order to host the games, they would not be able to be the host city, either.\nShortly thereafter, Rio de Janeiro also informed PASO that they would not be able to host the games.\nSecond host city selection.\nOn August 3, 1957, the II Special Congress of the Pan American Sports Organization was called in San Jose, Costa Rica to decide on whether Chicago or São Paulo would host the III Pan American Games. Nineteen of the twenty-five nations of PASO attended the Congress. Chicago won the games over São Paulo by a vote of thirteen to six.\nInterested cities.\nPhiladelphia and Montevideo showed interest in holding the Games after Cleveland redacted their hosting rights."

        "text": "The Cycling Podcast is an independent sports audio production created by Richard Moore, Lionel Birnie, and Daniel Friebe. Launched in 2013, weekly, hour-long episodes provide insight, analysis and often irreverent take on professional road cycling. Each episode features interviews with different professional cyclists, team staff and other actors from across the sport. Increased coverage is provided at the Grand Tours (the Giro d'Italia, Tour de France and Vuelta a España) where daily episodes are recorded at the end of each stage. Since launch, the podcast has launched several spin-offs and mini-series, most notably since 2016 The Cycling Podcast Féminin, a monthly edition of the podcast which focuses on professional women's cycling. From its launch until 2020, the podcast was also published by the UK broadsheet newspaper, \"The Telegraph\".\nHosts and Contributors.\nOriginally co-hosted by Friebe, Moore and Birnie, the podcast has added several contributors and co-presenters as it has grown, and particularly since Moore's death in 2022. Birnie also stepped back in 2024 to focus more on the business side of the podcast, such that as of 2024, the weekly episodes are now typically presented by Friebe with one or more other contributors. The daily Grand Tour podcasts are presented by a varied range of contributors. Episodes of the Cycling Podcast Féminin are typically presented by Rose Manley, with other regular contributors.\nAs of 2024, current and past regular contributors include François Thomazeau,\nCiro Scognamiglio, Fran Reyes, Brian Nygaard, Rob Hatch, Tom Whalley, Lizzy Banks, Ned Boulting, Ian Boswell, Orla Chennaoui, Denny Gray, Mitch Docker, Larry Warbasse, Richard Abrahams, Kate Wagner and Seb Piquet.\nHistory.\n\"The Cycling Podcast\" began as short audio dispatches from the 2013 Tour de France supported by sponsorship from Sharp. \nListener numbers hit 9,000 halfway into the race which helped secure funding from Jaguar for the following year. In 2015, audience numbers grew to 30,000 and partnerships were developed with The Telegraph and Eurosport. Support from sports nutrition brand Science in Sport saw The Cycling Podcast cover their first Giro d'Italia in 2016 and title sponsorship from cycling lifestyle brand Rapha, secured the future of the podcast for the following two years. Notably, The Cycling Podcast was referenced in the House of Commons Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee's report into Combatting doping in sport.\n\"The Cycling Podcast\" was the first podcast ever to be accredited to the Tour de France.\n\"The Cycling Podcast\" has been nominated for several awards since 2016. The podcast was given best podcast at the 2016 Cycling Media Awards. In 2018, The Cycling Podcast was a Bronze medalist in sports podcast category at the British Podcast Awards. It has been renominated in the Sports category in 2019. The Grand Tour Diaries, the second book by the team behind The Cycling Podcast was released in November 2019.\nBeginning in 2018, Daniel Friebe became a member of ITV's cycling coverage team for the Tour de France and Vuelta a España, and started appearing on the podcast less frequently during those races, and often contributing in the way of a guest pundit. As ITV didn't typically cover the Giro d'Italia, he remained a key part of the team during the Italian Grand Tour. The Cycling Podcast was recorded live with an audience at the 2019 World Championships.\nIn early 2022, lead presenter Richard Moore died suddenly. In his absence, Birnie and Friebe were the main presenters during the Giro d'Italia, and during the Tour de France, the podcast was hosted by Birnie, François Thomazeau and recently retired cyclist Mitchell Docker.\nCoverage.\nGiro d'Italia.\nIn 2016, \"The Cycling Podcast\" team covered the Giro d'Italia for the first time, thanks to new sponsorship funding from Science in Sport. Italian journalist Ciro Scognamiglio of La Gazzetta dello Sport is a regular contributor during the three-week stage race.\nTour de France.\n\"The Cycling Podcast\" began as daily dispatches from the Tour de France in 2013. Richard Moore, Lionel Birnie and Daniel Friebe, along with a cast of special guests, have provided analysis and insight from each of the 21 stages of the race every year since. Esteemed French journalist and author François Thomazeau (winner of the 2015 Prix Jacques Goddet) has joined them in their coverage since 2017.\nVuelta a España.\nFollowing the title sponsorship of cycling clothing brand Rapha, \"The Cycling Podcast\" added the third Grand Tour to their coverage in August 2016.

        "text": "In the sport of cricket, \"Mankading\" (named after Indian international Vinoo Mankad) is the informal name given to running out the non-striking batter whilst they are backing up, which is when they begin to leave the crease while the bowler is in their final delivery stride.\nThis kind of run-out is part of the \"Laws of Cricket\", but there is a long term unspoken rule regarding the spirit of the game. This unspoken rule suggests that the bowler or team should warn a player first before performing the run out attempt. This warning could be given verbally, or the bowler can perform the run out before withdrawing the appeal. Dismissals of this type can be controversial, particularly when no warning was given, and often involve the umpires having discussions between themselves and the captain of the bowling side in order to confirm if the captain wishes to continue with the appeal even though these dismissals are simple to adjudicate.\nThe first batter to be dismissed such a way in first class cricket was George Baigent of Sussex in 1835. The bowler was Thomas Barker.\nThe following are lists of Mankading incidents in major cricket matches. The batting team is listed first.\nRepresentation in popular culture.\nIn \"Bodyline\", the dramatisation of the notorious Bodyline tour of 1932–33, the controversial England captain Douglas Jardine is represented early in his career as encouraging a bowler to Mankad an opponent without giving a prior warning. Jardine's action is excused in the dramatisation by Lord Harris, who is represented as saying he had done the same in his playing career. While this represents Jardine's (and his supporters') perceived willingness to resort to sharp practice, there is in fact no evidence that Jardine or Harris initiated such an instance as captains, and no record of such an incident in first-class cricket. Instead, it might have been a reference to Harris’ act for Eton against Harrow at Lord’s in 1870. \nIn the Bollywood film \"Lagaan\", one of the English bowlers Mankads one of the Indian team's players after his runner backed up."

        "text": "In Major League Baseball, the winning pitcher is defined as the pitcher who last pitched prior to the half-inning when the winning team took the lead for the last time. There are two exceptions to this rule. The first is that a starting pitcher must complete five innings to earn a win (four innings for a game that lasts five innings on defense). If he fails to do so, he is ineligible to be the winning pitcher even if he last pitched prior to the half-inning when his team took the lead for the last time, and the official scorer awards the win to the relief pitcher who, in the official scorer's judgment, was the most effective. The second exception applies if the relief pitcher who last pitched prior to the half-inning when the winning team took the lead for the last time was \"ineffective in a brief appearance\" in the official scorer's judgment, in which case the win is awarded to the succeeding relief pitcher who, in the official scorer's judgment, was the most effective.\nCharles Radbourn holds the record for the most wins in a single-season, winning 59 games in 1884. John Clarkson (53 in 1885) and Guy Hecker (52 in 1884) are the only other pitchers to win more than 50 games in a single-season."

        "text": "Mount LaCrosse, is a mountain summit in the Olympic Mountains and is located in Jefferson County of Washington state. It is situated in Olympic National Park and the nearest higher peak is Mount Elk Lick, to the east. The Anderson massif lies to the north of Mount LaCrosse, and White Mountain lies to the southwest. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into tributaries of the Dosewallips River and Duckabush River.\nHistory.\nThe peak's toponym derives from the nearby lake with the same name, \"Lake LaCrosse\". Members of the 1890 O'Neil Expedition named the body of water \"Lake of the Holy Cross\" because of a large tree with branches and trunk in the shape of a cross guarded the lake. Over the subsequent years the name transformed to \"Lake of the Cross\" and eventually to its present-day name. It is officially spelled as \"Mount LaCrosse\".\nThe first ascent of the mountain was made in 1928 by Richard Paulson, William Ryer, Paul Wiseman, and Frank Woodworth.\nClimate.\nBased on the Köppen climate classification, Mount LaCrosse is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Weather fronts originating in the Pacific Ocean travel northeast toward the Olympic Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks (orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snow. As a result, the Olympics experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in avalanche danger. During winter months weather is usually cloudy, but due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. In terms of favorable weather, June to September are the best months for climbing the mountain.\nGeology.\nThe Olympic Mountains are composed of obducted clastic wedge material and oceanic crust, primarily Eocene sandstone, turbidite, and basaltic oceanic crust. The mountains were sculpted during the Pleistocene era by erosion and glaciers advancing and retreating multiple times."

Cali was chosen as the host city by the Executive Committee in San José, Costa Rica on March 27, 2019.\nCali, Colombia.\nColombia Olympic Committee President Baltazar Medina noted that the reason Cali applied to host the games was to open the possibility of Colombia hosting larger multi-sports events, such as the Bolivarian Games and the Central American and Caribbean Games. Cali would be the main city for the games, while Palmira, Buga, and Calima El Darién would act as sub-centers. Notably, 2021 will be the 50th anniversary of the 1971 Pan American Games, which is the last time that Cali hosted the Pan American Games.\nSanta Ana, El Salvador.\nOn January 29, 2019, Mayoress Milena Calderón Sol de Escalón confirmed that Santa Ana would apply to be the host of the inaugural games, stating, \"We are preparing all the presentations we have to do before the International Olympic Committee. It will be in Costa Rica where El Salvador, through Santa Ana, will be presented (to host the 2021 Junior Pan American Games).\"\nMonterrey, Mexico.\nPresident of the Mexican Olympic Committee Carlos Padilla Becerra expressed interest in Monterrey hosting the inaugural Junior Games, stating, \"Mexico hopes that the competition can take place in Monterrey in 2021; it is a city that has the adequate infrastructure to carry them out, and it a minimum expenditure would be necessary.\" However, there was a risk from lack of government support that caused the bid to be eliminated from the final vote.\nVenues.\nCali and six other locales (Buga, Yumbo, Jamundí, Calima El Darien, Palmira and Barranquilla) in Colombia will stage the competitions.\nThe Games.\nSports.\n321 events in 28 sports were contested.

Additionally, a number of other T20I/WT20I matches were also scheduled to be played in minor series involving associate nations. The season started with Australia leading the Test cricket rankings, England leading the ODI rankings and Australia leading the Twenty20 rankings.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact on international cricket fixtures. Bangladesh's matches against Ireland were postponed on 21 March 2020. On 24 March 2020, the International Cricket Council (ICC) confirmed that all ICC qualifying events scheduled to take place before 30 June 2020 had been postponed. On 9 April 2020, Australia's tour to Bangladesh was postponed. On 20 April 2020, South Africa's tour to Sri Lanka was also postponed.

Two days later, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) confirmed that no professional cricket would be played in England before 1 July 2020, with tours by the West Indies and India's women both being postponed. On 12 May 2020, the ICC confirmed that the 2020 Women's Cricket World Cup Qualifier, scheduled to take place in Sri Lanka, had also been postponed. The ICC announced that the qualifier had been moved back to 2021. Two days later, Cricket Scotland and Cricket Ireland confirmed the cancellation of summer fixtures, including New Zealand's tour against both sides and Pakistan's visit to Ireland.\nJune and July saw further disruption to international cricket due to the pandemic. The ICC confirmed that the Scotland Tri-Nation Series and the Uganda Cricket World Cup Challenge League B tournament had both been postponed. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) confirmed that it had called off their tours to Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka. Scotland's one-off T20I match against Australia was cancelled, New Zealand's tour to Bangladesh to play two Test matches was postponed, and Bangladesh's tour to Sri Lanka to play three Test matches were all postponed. The latter was later rescheduled to be played in October 2020. On 30 June, Cricket Australia confirmed that their planned home series against Zimbabwe had also been postponed due to the virus. On 8 August 2020, Afghanistan's planned tour to Zimbabwe for five T20I matches was called off. Also in August 2020, the Netherlands tour to Zimbabwe was postponed, and India's tour to South Africa was cancelled due to a clash with the rescheduled 2020 Indian Premier League. Finally, the last scheduled series to be cancelled was the South Africa women's tour to England, which was due to take place in September 2020.\nIn June 2020, the ICC made several interim changes to the Playing Conditions due to the pandemic. A substitute could be used for any player showing symptoms of COVID-19, but only in a Test match. Players were banned from using saliva to shine the ball, with five penalty runs being awarded to the opposition for repeated transgressions. The requirement to use neutral match officials was temporarily lifted, along with an increase to the number of DRS reviews a team can use, due to having less experienced umpires in a match.\nInternational men's cricket started with the first Test between England and the West Indies on 8 July 2020, with the West Indies winning by four wickets. New Zealand's tour of the West Indies, also scheduled to start on 8 July 2020, was postponed after it clashed with the rescheduling of the West Indies tour of England. South Africa's tour of the West Indies was also postponed due to the rescheduling of the England-West Indies series. Ireland's tour of England, originally scheduled in September, was brought forward to 30 July 2020, after the ECB gave the go ahead for the series. The fixture was also the first match in the 2020–2023 ICC Cricket World Cup Super League tournament, with England beating Ireland by six wickets. The ICC began the use of technology to monitor front-foot no-balls for all matches in the World Cup Super League. The ICC also started to trial the technology for the first time in a Test match, during Pakistan's Test series against England. Australia's tour to England, originally scheduled to take place in July, was moved back to September, following the rearranged series between England and Ireland. The only women's international cricket to take place was a five-match WT20I series between England and the West Indies.

        "text": "Adam Robert Johnson (June 22, 1994 – October 28, 2023) was an American professional ice hockey forward. He played 13 games in the National Hockey League with the Pittsburgh Penguins during the 2018–19 and 2019–20 seasons. He also played in Europe with the Malmö Redhawks, Augsburger Panther, and Nottingham Panthers. Johnson died after his neck was cut by an opposing player's skate blade in an on-ice collision, causing him to bleed out.\nEarly life and education.\nJohnson was born June 22, 1994, in Grand Rapids, Minnesota, to Susan and Davey Johnson. After graduating from Hibbing High School, he played junior ice hockey in the United States Hockey League (USHL) with the Indiana Ice and Sioux City Musketeers, and was named a USHL All-Star in 2015. Undrafted in the National Hockey League (NHL), he played two seasons of collegiate ice hockey with the University of Minnesota Duluth's Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs team in the National Collegiate Hockey Conference (NCHC). During his sophomore season, 2016–17, Johnson scored 18 goals and tallied 37 points in 42 games, finished second on the club in both goals and points. He helped Minnesota-Duluth advance to the 2017 Frozen Four with a power play goal to defeat Boston University 3–2 in overtime The Bulldogs eventually fell to the Denver 3–2 in the title game.\nPlaying career.\nIn July 2017, Johnson signed a two-year, entry level contract with the Pittsburgh Penguins after attending the team's prospect camp. Johnson was the second-leading scorer for Pittsburgh's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins during the 2017–18 season and made his NHL debut with Pittsburgh on March 21, 2019, in a 2–1 win over the Nashville Predators. He played a total of 13 NHL games, and scored one goal in a 7–4 win against the Minnesota Wild on October 12.\nWith the COVID-19 pandemic delaying the North American season, Johnson joined the Malmö Redhawks of the Swedish Hockey League (SHL) for the 2020–21 season on December 15, 2020. Appearing with the Redhawks in a top-six forward role, Johnson added seven goals and 12 points through 21 regular season games before ending his contract and return to North America on March 27, 2021.\nOn April 6, 2021, Johnson signed with the Ontario Reign of the AHL, the primary affiliate of the Los Angeles Kings, for the remainder of the 2020–21 season. Johnson posted 11 points in 14 games for the Reign. Remaining with the Reign into the 2021–22 season, Johnson registered one goal and six points through 28 regular season games before being traded on February 17, 2022, to the Lehigh Valley Phantoms in exchange for future considerations.\nJohnson returned to Europe in the 2022 off-season, signing a one-year deal with the Augsburger Panther of the German Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL), on September 12, 2022. In the 2022–23 season, Johnson posted seven goals and 22 points through 45 regular season games. The Panthers finished the season in relegation zone and Johnson left the club at the conclusion of his contract on March 17, 2023.\nIn August 2023, Johnson joined the Nottingham Panthers of the Elite Ice Hockey League (EIHL) for the 2023–24 season.\nDeath.\nOn October 28, 2023, before 8,000 spectators at Utilita Arena against the Sheffield Steelers, Johnson's throat was cut by the skate of Steelers' player Matt Petgrave during an on-ice collision at the 35th minute of the game. A video of the incident showed Petgrave's left skate kick up towards Johnson as he began to fall after colliding with another Panthers player. After the impact, Johnson attempted to skate to the team bench while bleeding out, before collapsing on the ice. As paramedics tended to his injury, other players locked arms to form a protective ring around him. Later, protective sheets were raised, players returned to the locker rooms, and spectators were asked to leave the arena. Johnson was transferred to Sheffield's Northern General Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. He was 29 years old. News of Johnson's death was withheld until the following morning while Johnson's relatives were alerted.\nIn response to Johnson's death, the EIHL suspended all games scheduled for October 29. Leagues and teams worldwide issued statements mourning Johnson's death and held pre-game ceremonies in his honor. A fan fundraising campaign to support Johnson's family surpassed its initial goal of £5,000 within a few hours and its adjusted goal of £10,000 the same day. Following Johnson's death, hundreds of fans assembled outside Nottingham Arena, home rink of the Panthers, alongside Panthers players and staff to lay flowers and other tributes in a makeshift memorial. Moments of silence were also held across the NHL.\nJohnson's teammate Westin Michaud speculated that Petgrave's actions \"were unintentional and anyone suggesting otherwise is mistaken\". In a statement on Twitter, the Nottingham Panthers speculated Johnson's death was the result of a \"freak accident\".\nThe South Yorkshire Police opened an investigation into the death. In England, an act which can reasonably be expected to cause grievous bodily harm to a person but results in their death can constitute murder; in such a case, a lesser constructive manslaughter charge is also available to prosecutors. An autopsy report confirmed that Johnson died from the wound to his neck. On November 14, 17 days after the incident, South Yorkshire Police announced the arrest of an unnamed man on suspicion of manslaughter in Johnson's death. He was later released on police bail.\nLegacy.\nJohnson's death prompted an examination of player safety in the game of hockey and led to several mandates on neck protection. The English Ice Hockey Association (EIHA), the governing body of the sport in England and Wales at all levels below the Elite League, introduced a neck guard mandate beginning in 2024. All Canadian Hockey League leagues (OHL, QMJHL, and WHL) also mandated neck guards effective November 4, 2023. However, the Elite Ice Hockey League, which Johnson had been playing for at the time of his death, announced that it had no plans to mandate neck guards. Though not required in the league, several NHL players began wearing neck guards in games and practices following Johnson's death, including Tyler Bertuzzi, T. J. Oshie, and Cole Koepke. USA Hockey approved a new policy, effective August 1, 2024, that requires all players 18 years of age and under to wear neck laceration protection in games and practices.\nPersonal life.\nAt the time of his death, according to family members, Johnson had purchased an engagement ring he planned to give to his girlfriend of three years, Ryan Wolfe.\nAwards and honors.\nThe Nottingham Panthers retired Johnson's number 47 jersey number at a ceremony on November 18, 2023.\nHibbing High School retired Adam's high school number 7 on December 5, 2023."

        "title": "Authors Cricket Club",
        "text": "The Authors Cricket Club is a wandering amateur English cricket club founded in 1892 and revived most recently in 2012. Prominent British writers including Arthur Conan Doyle, P.G. Wodehouse, A.A. Milne and J.M. Barrie have been featured as players on the club team, the Authors XI. \nOriginal team (1892–1912).\nThe original Authors Cricket Club was an offshoot of the Authors' Club, which had been founded in 1891 as a place for British authors to gather and talk. \"Sherlock Holmes\" author Arthur Conan Doyle, an excellent cricketer who would go on to play ten first-class matches for the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1903, was a frequent bowler for the team. The bat that Doyle used when he made 101 not out in a game of Authors vs. the Press in 1896 is still on display at the MCC Museum at Lord's Cricket Ground.\nDoyle was joined by other writers including \"Winnie the Pooh\" creator A. A. Milne, reputed to be the best fielder on the team, and \"Jeeves\" author P. G. Wodehouse, who was regarded as a decent player. \"Peter Pan\" author J. M. Barrie, however, was not, despite his great enthusiasm for the game. In 1887, Barrie had set up his own team, the Allahakbarries, for others with similarly limited playing abilities. The Authors and the Allahakbarries existed side-by-side for a number of years, with Milne and Wodehouse joining Barrie in playing for both teams.\nSome of the other writers who played for the team were E. W. Hornung, E. V. Lucas, John Snaith, H. V. Hesketh-Prichard, Albert Kinross, Shan Bullock, George Cecil Ives, and A. E. W. Mason (all pictured left, along with Doyle, Wodehouse, and Barrie). Other players included Gordon Guggisberg, Hugh de Sélincourt, E. Temple Thurston, and Cecil Headlam.\nThe original Authors XI played their last game in 1912. The team failed to reassemble after World War I ended in 1918, both due to the advancing ages of the players and because many of them found that their appetite for games had been diminished by the war.\n20th-century revivals.\nThe Authors Cricket Club has been revived at least three times since the original team disbanded. The first revival lasted from the 1940s into the '50s, and there was also a team for a brief period in the 1980s.\nPoet Edmund Blunden, a fanatical (although untalented) cricketer who celebrated his love of the sport in 1944's \"Cricket Country\", captained the first revival in the 1940s. Among those who joined him on the team were novelists Alec Waugh, John Moore and Thomas Armstrong, as well as Test cricket legends Len Hutton, Douglas Jardine and Denis Compton.\n2012–present team.\nIn 2012, 100 years after the original team last played, literary agent Charlie Campbell and novelist Nicholas Hogg announced they were starting the Authors XI anew. Campbell serves as captain and Hogg as vice-captain of the revived team.\nThe team adopted as its motto the phrase \"Praeter ingenium nihil\" (Latin meaning \"nothing except intelligence\"). This is a reference to a remark Australian cricketer Kim Hughes made dismissing England's Mike Brearley when they captained opposing Ashes teams in 1981: \"He had nothing going for him except that he was intelligent.\"\nPlayers.\nWriters who joined the revived team included novelists Sebastian Faulks, Richard Beard, Mirza Waheed, and Alex Preston, historical non-fiction writers Tom Holland, James Holland, Matthew Parker and Peter Frankopan, memoirist William Fiennes, young adult novelists Anthony McGowan and Joe Craig, journalists Amol Rajan and Chris Hemmings, sportswriters Jonathan Wilson and Jon Hotten, science writer Adam Rutherford, poet Tim Beard, biographer Ben Falk and editor Matt Thacker.\nComedian Andy Zaltzman and actor Dan Stevens, best known for his role on the television series \"Downton Abbey\", both played on the team during the 2012–2013 season, as did Ed Smith (a former professional cricketer who played for England). Novelist Kamila Shamsie, the only woman on the team, played during an Authors XI game against the Shepperton Ladies team in the same season.\nTom Holland and Matthew Parker are opening bowlers for the team, while Richard Beard, Anthony McGowan and Matt Thacker open the batting and William Fiennes plays in the position of wicket-keeper.\nFixtures and foreign tours.\nThe Authors XI play against village cricket clubs in England, as well as against clubs such as the Lords and Commons (made up of members of Parliament), the Actors XI (a team that includes Damian Lewis and Iain Glen), the Royal Household (composed of staff of the British royal family) and the Eton College team.\nIn 2013, they defeated the national team of Japan, which was then ranked in the top 40 in the world, in London. In September 2019, they won a celebrity match against a Lord's Taverners team that included Andrew Caddick, Matthew Hoggard and Gladstone Small, all former Test and One-Day International (ODI) players for England. Caddick was clean bowled by Tom Holland.\nIn addition to games in England, the Authors XI have traveled to several foreign countries to play cricket. In 2013 and 2015, they went to India, where they played against the Rajasthan Royals as part of the 2013 Jaipur Literature Festival. The team captains rode onto the cricket pitch atop camels and the next day, the Authors made the front page of the world's largest newspaper, \"The Times of India\".\nThey toured Sri Lanka in 2014 and again in 2016. They donated pitches and kit bags to local schools while there, as well as sponsoring a promising young player. In 2015, they played against the Vatican team in Rome and presented Pope Francis with his own Authors XI cricket cap, and in 2017, they traveled to Reykjavik and played against Iceland's national team in a three-game match, losing 2–1 (but redeemed themselves the following year, defeating Iceland by 20 runs when the latter team came to England).\nIn 2018 and 2019, they visited the island of Corfu, Greece to take part in the first and second Corfu Literary Festivals, where they participated in literary panel discussions and writing workshops and played cricket against local teams.\nBook.\nSome of the team members collectively wrote a book about their first season playing together, \"The Authors XI: A Season of English Cricket from Hackney to Hambledon\" (Bloomsbury, 2013). Sebastian Faulks wrote the foreword, in which he noted that \"Amateur cricketers tend to be vain, anecdotal, passionate, knowledgeable, neurotic and given to fantasy. So do writers. The game is made for the profession.\"\nEighteen of the Authors XI's 2012-13 players (including historian Thomas Penn and editor Sam Carter) contributed chapters about a particular aspect of the game. Among those with chapters: actor Dan Stevens wrote a chapter (\"Edwardian Cricket and \"Downton Abbey\"\") about filming a cricket game on that television series\",\" Tom Holland wrote in \"Youth and Age\" about learning to love the game as a boy after at first finding it both tedious and humiliating (as well as about hitting the first six of his life while playing in a 2012 Authors game, a feat he also recounted in a 2013 \"Financial Times\" article), and William Fiennes penned a piece on \"Cricket and Memory\" that ended with him drifting away in a haze as he was stretchered off the field after snapping his collarbone while diving to make a catch. In Anthony McGowan's chapter, titled \"Cricket and Class\", he noted that he, Nicholas Hogg and Jon Hotten were the only players on the 2012–13 team to have attended state schools: \"The Authors CC is crammed to the gills with the quite ludicrously posh… the team is packed with the full range of characters from a Fifties public school story – the hearty, sporty type; the etiolated intellectual; the endearingly modest earl; even an exiled Ruritanian princeling\"\nReviewing the book for \"The Guardian\", Peter Wilby called it \"a distinguished addition to the game's extensive and eclectic literature\". Sir Michael Parkinson wrote a blurb for the book which read \"I once said I never met a cricketer I didn't like and this book goes some way to explaining why. A wonderful celebration of the best of games.\" Journalist Simon Barnes wrote \"Most cricket writers are better at cricket than at writing. Reversing this principle is a revelation.\"\nSponsorship and charities.\nChristie's auction house sponsored the Authors XI starting with the 2012-13 season. In 2019, Rathbones investment firm announced that they would be sponsoring the team in connection with their annual Folio Prize literary award.\nThe team has raised \"tens of thousands of pounds\" for charities including Chance to Shine, which encourages competitive cricket in state schools and First Story, an organization co-founded by team member William Fiennes which fosters literacy through creative writing in low-income schools. They also raised money for the conservation group Alde and Ore Estuary Trust in 2014."

        "title": "1966–67 Cornell Big Red men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1966–67 Cornell Big Red men's ice hockey season was the 51st season of play for the program. The Big Red represented Cornell University in college ice hockey. In its 4th year under head coach Ned Harkness the team compiled a 27–1–1 record and reached the NCAA tournament for the first time in its history. The Big Red defeated Boston University 4–1 in the championship game at the Onondaga County War Memorial in Syracuse, New York. Cornell tied the record, held by several teams, for the fewest losses by an NCAA champion.\nSeason.\nEarly season.\nIn the first three seasons under Ned Harkness Cornell had steadily risen in the ECAC, finishing third in the conference and ending the season as the conference runner-up. With the Big Red seemingly just hitting their stride, the team suffered a blow before the season even began with senior netminder David Quarrie going down with an ankle injury. The team turned to sophomore Ken Dryden to hold the fort and hope that they could survive until Quarrie's return. Fortunately they began their season with a relatively easy matchup against McMaster at home and after scoring seven goals in the first period the Big Red skated to a 14–2 win. The game was notable in that the scoring was spread out across all three lines, showing signs that the depth issue that had plagued them the year before may have been addressed.\nCornell opened their ECAC schedule the following game against Rensselaer and while the team as a whole played inconsistently throughout the game, Dryden was particularly notable for how calm and collected he was in goal, holding the Engineers to two goals in Cornell's 7–2 victory. For their third game Cornell took on defending ECAC champion and national runner-up Clarkson. With the Walker Arena filled to capacity Cornell battled the Golden Knights in a very close game that was tied three separate times. Clarkson opened the scoring with a power play marker, putting Cornell down on the scoresheet for the first time all season. The Big Red failed to score on a two-man advantage but continued to put pressure on Clarkson's goal and eventually potted two quick goals in the later half of the first period. Clarkson knotted the score off of a deflection before the frame was over and the two teams went into the first intermission tied at two-all. Cornell's attack kept the puck in Clarkson's end for much of the next two periods but Clarkson's John Miller held the fort and sent the two teams into overtime. While the boisterous crowd continued to root on the Knights it was Cornell's Harry Orr who netted the game-winner at 4:31.\nThe Big Red returned home for their next two games, first hosting Guelph where sophomore Bob McGuinn scored a hat-trick in the team's 6–1 victory, then welcomed in a good St. Lawrence team only to trounce the Saints 8–0 with Peter Tufford scoring four times while Ken Dryden earned his first varsity shutout. While the win helped propel Cornell to the top of the ECAC the game was marred by penalties and included a stick-swinging incident from the Larrie's Dick Smith who opened a gash in the side of Mike Doran's face that required 14-15 stitches to close. Smith received a 5 minute major penalty for the infraction Doran was able to return later in the game.\nTheir next game saw Cornell's first Ivy League match of the year at Yale. The Bulldogs' first score was one of the only bad goals Ken Dryden allowed that year and though Cornell tied the game three minutes later, Yale quickly regained the lead. Bobby Ferguson was able to tie the game with a short-handed goal and as the first period was coming to a close Yale took two successive penalties and Dave Ferguson was able to score on both to give Cornell their first lead. The Big Red's defense had fairly poor game and allowed Yale to have many good scoring opportunities but the heroics from Ken Dryden kept the score in Cornell's favor. Bruce Pattison was cut in the third period after being checked into the wire mesh that surrounded the rink rather than plexiglass, leaving the Big Red with just three defenseman for the final 11 minutes but the team was able to rally and skate to a 5–3 win.\nHoliday tournaments.\nWith a perfect 6–0 record Cornell headed to Boston to play in the ECAC Holiday Tournament. The Big Red opened against Northeastern at the Boston Garden and, despite playing at what amounted to a home game for the Huskies, Cornell trounced their opponents 9–1 with Doug Ferguson's 4 goals leading the way. The next night Cornell took on defending national champion Michigan State for the tournament title and opened the scoring with a Bobby Ferguson goal. The Spartans played the same tough defense that garnered them the 1966 National Title and held Cornell back until late in the second when Dave Ferguson notched a power-play marker. MSU showed their mettle by scoring twice in the third period, first on the power play and then short-handed, to tie the game. Both teams had chances to end the game but Dryden and fellow netminder Gaye Cooley were both stellar and sent the game into overtime. It only took 59 seconds to decide the game when Mike Doran scored on a screened Cooley to win the tournament for Cornell and keep their perfect record.\nJust before the winter break Cornell took on Harvard, narrowly escaping with a 4–3 win on the strength of four consecutive goals. Before classes resumed, however, Cornell played in their second holiday championship, this time competing in the Boston Arena Christmas Tournament. Once more they opened against Northeastern and the team appeared to be rusty after their 8-day layoff. The Huskies went ahead twice by one goal before Bobby Ferguson's marker got Cornell their first least with just under nine minutes to play. Tufford got an empty-net goal to close out the game but the injury bug bit the Big Red again when Brian Cornell tore ligaments in his right knee and missed the rest of the season. After their lack-luster performance, Harkness shuffled his lines before the game against Harvard and got an immediate return when Doug Ferguson scored 28 seconds into the game. Cornell scored twice more before the period was out and with Dryden making 33 saves in the game The Big Red won 4–1 and set up a showdown against Boston University.\nIn 'The Game' Cornell and BU entered the contest with a combined 22–1 record with both vying for the top spot in the ECAC. Cornell opened the scoring with Harry Orr's goal on a two-man advantage early in the first but were answered by two BU power play goals before the period was over. Bobby Ferguson tied the game early in the second and was followed a minute later by Skip Stanowski to give the lead back to Cornell. The Big Red were unable to score another goal for the remainder of the game despite the pressure they put on BU's Wayne Ryan. Still holding the narrow lead late in the third, while on the power play Stanowski was beat out to a loose puck by Darrell Abbott who proceeded to flip the puck over Dryden's shoulder and tie the game. With the game heading into overtime, neither team showed the stamina required to prevail after their third game in as many days. After the first 10-minute period ended both coaches agreed to play one more extra frame but the additional time proved nothing and the two teams agreed to end with a tie. Fittingly Dryden shared the tournament MVP award with his counterpart Wayne Ryan while Doug Ferguson, Stanowski and Orr were named to the All-Tournament team along with their netminder.\nNew Year.\nWith BU and Cornell now tied atop the ECAC standing with no more games between the two neither could afford to slip much if they wanted to win the ECAC championship. The Big Red headed home for their next game against Yale and welcomed back David Quarrie in net for his first game since being injured. Though his ankle had not been badly hurt it was the otherworldly play of Dryden that kept Quarrie out of the net. In Quarrie's return to action he didn't play poorly but he wasn't able to overcome his team's defensive lapses, bad penalties and inability to score when they had their opportunities. Even worse was a second period goal that was waved off by the referee that could have given Cornell the game. It was, however, two power play goals by Yale in the third period put the Bulldogs ahead but with less than five minutes remaining Sophomore Ted Coviello tied the game at 3–3. Despite outshooting Yale 112 to 49 in the contest Cornell was unable to earn a fourth goal and it was Yale's Jack Morrison who scored the game winner at 6:09 of extra time.\nBecause BU had won their contest against Clarkson, Cornell was now in second-place in the ECAC and would have to hope that BU would slip up. In any event Dryden returned to the net for the next game and the Big Red punished Colgate on the road, winning 8–0 while Ken Dryden earned his second shutout with only light duty. At the same time the NCAA held a vote that ended the Ivy League's petition to eliminate the 1.6 rule from the athletic participation bylaws. The rule had been put into place the year before and stipulated that the all students must maintain a 1.6 grade point average on a 4.0 scale (equivalent to a D+ average) to be eligible for an athletic scholarship. The Ivy League fought the ruling on the grounds that its member schools did not give out scholarships solely for athletic ability and that the rule violated institutional autonomy. The Ivies received support from the greater ECAC as well as the Southwest and ACC conferences but the proposal was defeated 153 to 113. While the ruling went against their interests, the decision made it so that Cornell would be eligible for the 1967 tournament after having to decline the invitation to the previous year's championship.\nCornell regained their lead in the Ivy League race by defeating Brown 6–1 in a fast-paced game that saw very few shots on net despite the action. Though he was hardly fatigued from making 13 saves, Dryden was replaced in goal for the next game against Colgate by Quarrie. The visiting Red Raiders were mercilessly vanquished by the Big Red who scored the first nine goals of the game before surrendering two fairly meaningless markers in the third. The win was Quarrie's first of the season and it would also end up being the final minutes he would play in a Cornell uniform.\nDown the stretch.\nAfter taking the rest of January off, the team returned to the ice at Boston College on the first of February and fought to a close 3–2 road victory. The Big Red offence remained muted over the next to games against Western Ontario and Princeton, scoring only three times in each contest but Ken Dryden continued to show that he was the best goaltender in the college ranks by surrendering a single score in each game. When Cornell's offensive firepower returned against Dartmouth Dryden upped his game again by recording his third shutout of the season. In the final four games of their schedule Cornell dominated their Ivy League competition, outscoring their opponents by a combined score of 19–5 and finishing the season 18–1–1 in conference play. Unfortunately, Boston University had not lost a single conference game and finished just ahead of the Big Red, denying Cornell a conference championship despite a .925 winning percentage.\nECAC Tournament.\nThe Big Red opened the conference tournament at the Boston Garden as the #2 seed against Brown and took their frustrations out on the Bears. Cornell dispatched their fellow Ivy-Leaguers 11–2 and advanced to the second round where they met BC. While their earlier meeting had been a close affair the Big Red made no mistake in the rematch and posted 12 goals to silence a hostile crowd and send the Eagles packing, as they had done the year before. The championship game brought the meeting that everyone had been waiting for, a rematch between the two best teams in the nation when Cornell and BU faced off for the ECAC championship. The Terriers' defense was a far better match against Cornell's big guns than the previous two opponents and Cornell was limited to a single goal in the first two periods. The skating ability of the Big Red forwards wore down BU in the third, however, and Cornell was able to score three times in the final frame, the last coming from the stick of Mike Doran with under nine minutes to play that proved to be the game-winner and earned Cornell its first conference championship.\nNCAA tournament.\nCornell was given the automatic berth into the NCAA tournament as the ECAC tournament champion, the first appearance in the history of the program, but despite this, as well as possessing the best record in the nation (25–1–1) Cornell was pitted against the better of the two WCHA teams in the semifinal, North Dakota. This likely happened as a result of Cornell having already played Michigan State earlier in the year but regardless Cornell opened against a strong WCHA champion loaded with players already experienced with the NCAA tournament. Cornell didn't seem to take note at the start, however, and out dueled North Dakota 12 shots to 8. UND netminder Mike Curran fought off the Cornell attack for most of the first frame but a shot from Skip Stanowski finally found its way into the net at the end of the period. North Dakota picked up the pace in the second, equaling Cornell's thirteen shots but neither netminder gave an inch and the game remained in Cornell's favor by the slimmest of margins. After their attack came to naught, North Dakota flagged in the final period and though Curran would continue to hold the fort the Sioux attack could not solve Dryden and Cornell skated to victory. Dryden's fourth shoutout of the season was only the second shutout in any NCAA tournament and by far the lowest-scoring game in history. No game would have fewer goals in regulation until 2004 when a Regional semifinal went into overtime tied 0–0.\nThe championship game saw a third meeting between Cornell and BU, all of which coming in de facto tournament finals. The Terriers were looking for revenge after suffering a loss in the ECAC championship but, perhaps more importantly, this was the first time since 1949 that both finalists came from the eastern region which guaranteed that the east would have a national champion for the first time since 1954. Despite the game being played in Syracuse the crowd was decidedly in favor of BU and the team seemed to feed off of the energy early with an attack on the Cornell net in the first minute. Dryden held the Terriers back and allowed Bob Kinasewich to open the scoring before two minutes had elapsed. Boston University pulled back after the quick change of fortune and Cornell took advantage with their own offensive salvo. As the shots piled up for Cornell, however, Wayne Ryan was up to the task and held Cornell back until late in the first when the Big Red doubled their lead with a power play goal from the combined efforts of the Ferguson twins. Mid-way through the second Cornell connected on another power play to push their lead to three but just 12 seconds later BU finally was able to get a puck past Dryden to cut the lead back to 2. The goal reignited BU's offense and the Terriers began peppering the cage with shots but the nation's top goaltender turned everything back and as the seconds ticked past the chance for the Terriers became more and more remote. When Robert McGuinn scored halfway through the third it was the final nail in BU's coffin and Cornell won their first national championship 4–1.\nAwards and records.\nKen Dryden set an all-time record by allowing just one goal in two games for a goals against average of 0.50 to go along with his .986 save percentage, a record for both the Frozen Four and overall tournament (as of 2018). Despite his historical numbers Dryden was not named as Tournament Most Outstanding Player, that honor instead went to Skip Stanowski, the standout defenseman who finished the tournament with two goals and two assists (contributing on 80% of Cornell's offense) and scored both game-winning goals. Dryden would have to settle for being named to the All-Tournament first team along with Stanowski, Harry Orr and Mike Doran. Dave and Doug Ferguson were also named to the Second Team.\nDryden, Orr and Doug Ferguson were named to both the AHCA All-American East Team as well as the All-ECAC Hockey First Team while Doran made the ECAC Second Team. Doug Ferguson was also named as the ECAC Hockey Player of the Year while Harry Orr received the Outstanding Defenseman Award (The last player in history to win the award). Again, despite his setting new NCAA records with a 1.46 GAA and a .945 save percentage, Dryden did not receive the ECAC Rookie of the Year which instead went to BU's Herb Wakabayashi who finished second in scoring in the nation. Part of the trouble in earning recognition for his efforts was the performance of Quarrie and Errol McKibbon the previous year; both played at least ten games for the Big Red and each goaltender had surrendered less than two goals per game. While the voters for these awards may have believed that Cornell had insulated the sophomore, time would show the wiser.\nCornell's loss to Yale in January was the last home loss Cornell would suffer for over five years. The winning streak ended at 63 games, by far the longest such stretch in NCAA history.\nSchedule.\nThe team's schedule was as follows:\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \nRoster and scoring statistics.\nThe team roster and scoring statistics were as follows:"

        "title": "1961–62 Michigan Tech Huskies men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1961–62 Michigan Tech Huskies men's ice hockey team represented Michigan Tech University in college ice hockey. In its 6th year under head coach John MacInnes the team compiled a 29–3–0 record and reached the NCAA tournament for the third time in its history. The Pioneers defeated Clarkson 7–1 in the championship game at the Utica Memorial Auditorium in Utica, New York.\nSeason.\nAfter barely losing to Denver in the 1960 championship game, Michigan Tech took a step back in 1960–61, barely finishing above .500 and being embarrassed by the Pioneers in the WCHA tournament. The start of the 1961–62 campaign didn't fare much better as the Huskies dropped both games at Michigan, with each sophomore goaltender losing their first career start. The team then had to head home to welcome the defending national champions but, fortunately for MTU, Denver had lost many players to graduation over the summer and wasn’t nearly as strong. They were still good enough to put up 7 goals in the first game against Tech but the Huskies were able to post 8 of their own and get their first win of the season. That victory seemed to settle Michigan Tech because in the following game they were able to handle the Pioneers and win in a much more convincing fashion, 8–2.\nMichigan Tech would host Toronto before the winter break then head to Colorado for a tough series against Denver and Colorado College where they would play 4 games in 5 days. Tech opened with two wins at CC (who would finish the season without a single victory) and after a comfortable 8–4 win in the first game at Denver they scratched out a 5–4 win in overtime to build their record to 8–2. Tech had a short three-day break that allowed them to head home where they would host first-place Michigan. The Huskies handed UM their first loss of the season with 4–2 victory, and just when it looked like Tech could pull into the lead, the Wolverines returned the favor with their own 4–2 win in the second game. This not only dropped MTU to 7-3 in the conference, but, with no further games against the powerful Wolverines, MTU would need help to finish atop the WCHA.\nWith little time to lick their wounds, the Huskies hit the road and played series against Minnesota and North Dakota. After taking both games against the Golden Gophers they played a pair of nail-biters in Grand Forks, winning the first game 2–1 and escaping with a second win after a 3–2 finish in overtime. Tech started a long home stand by hosting a relatively poor Minnesota–Duluth squad before welcoming North Dakota, Michigan State and Minnesota in consecutive weeks. The Huskies miraculously swept all four weekends and with Michigan having lost twice to Denver in early February, MTU held onto first place and finished with a 17-3 record to earn their first conference championship.\nEven though they had won the WCHA Michigan Tech still had games to play on their schedule, and after spending a weekend in Duluth and winning two more games against the Bulldogs, Tech played host to the Finnish National Team and won a further two games to push their record to 25–3, setting a new program record for wins.\nAs a result of the NCAA having placed both WCHA teams in the same semifinal the year before (due to Denver and Minnesota not having played one another prior to the NCAA tournament) the WCHA changed their playoff format where they dispensed with the pair of two-game series to declare co-champions and went with a more traditional 4-team single-elimination format where a single champion would be crowned. Additionally, rather than play the games at the home cite of the higher-seeded school, all games would be played at a host venue with the Weinberg Coliseum chosen for the 1962 tournament. The Huskies opened against Michigan State and took the game against the Spartans 5–1 which sent them to a fifth meeting with Michigan, the only team that had been able to defeat MTU all season. Michigan opened the scoring just before the half-way point of the first and added a second goal just over two minutes later, both power play goals. As thing were beginning to look bleak for the Huskies their own power play finally scored with less than 30 seconds left in the period and team captain Jerry Sullivan tied the score with 1 second remaining. Tech could have used the timely goals to jump on the Wolverines in the second but Dave Butts held them off the scoresheet and allowed the WCHA leading scorer and player of the year Red Berenson to give Michigan its second lead of the night with UM's third power play marker. With little to lose Tech came out firing in the third and scored two goals in 17 seconds at the start of the period to take their first lead. Michigan tied the game at 4-all with under 9 minutes to play but Lou Angotti got the game-winner 72 seconds later and Garry Bauman held the fort to earn the Huskies the first solitary WCHA tournament championship. The six goals scored by Michigan Tech were the most allowed by Michigan all season.\nMichigan Tech received the top western seed due to their conference championship and opened against ECAC champion St. Lawrence who were making their fourth consecutive tournament appearance and 7th overall but had yet to win a single game against any western school. St. Lawrence opened the scoring with a power play goal in the 11th minute but from then-on it was all Michigan Tech. Don Hermanson scored a pair of goals on the man-advantage and was followed by four more from different teammates while the Huskies outshot the Larries 55–15 and easily marched to their third championship game.\nIt had thought that MTU could meet Michigan for a sixth time in the championship game but the Wolverines had been dispatched by Clarkson in the semifinal and the Golden Knights were all that stood in Tech way for the first national title. The game couldn't have started better for the Huskies when John Ivanitz scored 38 seconds in and added another five minutes later. Sullivan scored before 10 minutes had elapsed in the game and with an early 3-0 lead MTU was off and running. Unlike St. Lawrence, Clarkson didn't wilt under the bright lights and the Golden Knights continued firing the puck, finally scoring in the final minute of the first to cut the lead to 2. Both teams were held scoreless in the second as Bauman and his counterpart Wayne Gibbons held off separate barrages but Clarkson broke down in the third and allowed four more goals, with Ivanitz completing his hat-trick and Sullivan earning his fourth point of the night before Lou Angotti added a pair of insurance markers.\nAngotti was named as tournament MOP, becoming the first player to win the award twice and the only one to do so on both the winning and losing team in the national championship. Angotti, along with Ivanitz, Elov Seger and Henry Åkervall were named to the All-Tournament first team while, despite their stellar play, Bauman and Sullivan were named to the second team. John Ivanitz is one of only two players in history to record a hat trick, including the game-winner, and not be named as tournament MOP (as of 2018).\nAfter the season Åkervall, Angotti, Seger and Sullivan were named to the AHCA All-American West Team while Åkervall, Angotti, Bauman and Sullivan found themselves on the All-WCHA First Team. Seger and Gene Rebellato were also named to the WCHA second team while head coach John MacInnes earned his second WCHA Coach of the Year award.\nMichigan Tech ended the season on a 20-game winning streak. They would extend that to 22 game at the start of the following season, the longest such streak in program history.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "title": "2019 Overwatch League season",
        "text": "The 2019 Overwatch League season was the second season of the Overwatch League (OWL), an esport based on the video game \"Overwatch\". The league expanded from 12 teams from the inaugural season to 20 teams. Of the eight new teams, two were from the United States, two were from Canada, one was from France, and three were from China.\nThe season began on February 14, 2019, and ended on August 25. Postseason play began in late August. The San Francisco Shock won the Grand Finals over the Vancouver Titans to become the league champions.\nLeague changes.\nExpansion.\nThe Overwatch League initially launched with twelve teams in the 2018 season. During this season, Blizzard stated it planned to expand out the league to add six teams, ideally gaining more teams in European and Asian regions, and started meeting with potential owners in March 2018. By September 2018, Blizzard confirmed it had signed eight additional teams based in Atlanta, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Toronto, Paris, Washington D.C., Vancouver, and Chengdu, bringing the total team count to twenty. Whereas the franchising fee was estimated to be in the inaugural season, the fee was estimated by observers to have gone as high as for these new teams. The eight teams were distributed evenly between the two Divisions, with the North American East Coast and European teams joining the Atlantic Division, and the Chinese and North American West Coast teams added to the Pacific Division.\nSchedule.\nThe 2019 season's revised schedule format was announced on December 12, 2018. The season kept the four-stage format that was used in the 2018 season, though only the first three stages had playoffs, while the fourth stage's playoffs were replaced by a six-team play-in tournament to determine the final two postseason teams. The top six season playoff teams were determined by the same way they were in 2018; the top two teams from each division and the next four teams, regardless of division. The season playoffs were contested in a double-elimination tournament. Teams played 28 regular season games instead of 40, with the league citing players' mental health and additional chances to interact with their home cities as reasons for the change. Each stage still lasted five weeks, though the break between stages increased from one week to two weeks (except for the break between stages 2 and 3, which was four weeks due to the league's All-Star Weekend). Each week featured three to four games on Thursday and Friday and four games on Saturday and Sunday, totaling either fourteen or sixteen games per week, up from twelve in 2018. Teams played zero, one, or two matches per week. The stage playoffs doubled in size from 2018, expanding to eight teams, up from the four team system introduced in 2018's third stage. The top team from each division held the first and second seed, followed by the next six teams, regardless of division.\nThe Grand Finals were held at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on September 29, 2019.\nPrize pool.\nThe prize pool was increased from to $5,000,000. All eight teams who qualified for each Stage Playoffs earned at least $25,000. Each stage champion earned $200,000 (up from $100,000 in 2018), while the amount earned by the runners-up quadrupled from 2018 to $100,000. Third and fourth place teams earned $50,000 while fifth through eighth place teams earned $25,000. For the postseason earnings, the Grand Champion team will earn $1.1 million (up from $1 million), second place will earn $600,000, third place will earn $450,000, fourth place will earn $350,000, fifth and sixth place will earn $300,000, and seventh and eighth place will earn $200,000.\nPlayer contracts.\nThe season's free agency signing window opened to expansion teams on September 10, 2018, and closed on October 7, the day before the window for all teams opened. Each teams had to sign at least 12 players by December 1.\nThe 2019 season was also the first in which two-way contracts were in effect. Players signed to these contracts primarily played for their OWL team's academy team that played in Overwatch Contenders. They were unable to play in more than two OWL matches in a stage, nor could they play in an OWL match and a Contenders match in the same week. These players counted towards the OWL team's 12-player limit.\nVenues.\nThough most matches were still played at the 350-seat Blizzard Arena, the 2019 season introduced three \"Homestand Weeks,\" which took place in three Overwatch League cities. These were held as practice runs for the planned expansion of the Overwatch League into true home-and-away formats for the 2020 season, seeing teams travel across the globe to compete. The fourth week of Stage 2 was held at the Allen Event Center in Allen, Texas and was hosted by the Dallas Fuel. The fifth week of Stage 3 was held at the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre in Cumberland, Georgia and was hosted by the Atlanta Reign. The fifth week of Stage 4, dubbed \"Kit Kat Rivalry Weekend,\" was held at The Novo by Microsoft in Los Angeles, California and was hosted by the Los Angeles Valiant.\nBroadcasting.\nAll matches were broadcast on the Overwatch League's website and through Major League Gaming (owned by Blizzard), and by third-party broadcaster Twitch. On the first day of the 2018 season playoffs, Disney and Blizzard announced a multi-year partnership that would bring OWL and other organized \"Overwatch\" competitive events to ESPN, Disney XD, and ABC, starting with the playoffs and continuing through the 2019 season. On January 28, 2019, Blizzard announced that new dedicated esports channel Esports1, owned by German sports channel Sport1, would be broadcasting Overwatch League events in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria.\nRegular season.\nA team's standing was based on their overall match win–loss record, with ties broken by map differential, head-to-head map record, and head-to-head match record, in that order. If a tie that affects the qualification for Stage or Postseason playoffs still cannot be broken, the teams were to play a tiebreaker match.\nThe season playoff teams consisted of the two division winners, four wild card teams with the best regular season records regardless of division, and the top two teams from the play-in tournament.\nStage 1.\nStage 1 ran from February 14 to March 17, 2019, with stage playoffs taking place from March 21–24, 2019. The two division leaders, and the following top six teams, regardless of division, in the Stage 1 standings qualified for the Stage 1 Playoffs. The division winners were awarded the top two seeds, while the remaining teams received seeds three through eight based on their Stage 1 records. All matches emanated from the Blizzard Arena in Burbank, California.\nAt the conclusion of the first stage, both the Fusion and Defiant were tied for third place after considering all tie-breaking resolutions; similarly, the San Francisco Shock and the Seoul Dynasty were tied for sixth place. By league rules, both ties were to broken by an off-stream match. While the sixth-place tie was decided in this manner, the Defiant and Fusion mutually agreed to settle the third-place tie by a coin flip. Due to issues on reporting the coin flip, league commissioner Nate Nanzer stated that the league would not allow teams to decides such ties by one in the future.\nStage 2.\nStage 2 ran from April 4 to May 5, 2019, with stage playoffs taking place from May 9–12. The playoff format did not change from Stage 1. All matches emanated from the Blizzard Arena in Burbank, California, except for the fourth week of play, which took place at the Allen Event Center in Allen, Texas – the first of three \"Homestand Weeks\" of the season. This stage's Homestand Week was hosted by Dallas Fuel.\nThe second stage was the first in which assault map Paris was available for play. It was also the introduction of new support character Baptiste into professional play. Baptiste was designed by Blizzard as to disrupt a three-tank, three-support composition (frequently called GOATS in the game's player base in reference to the non-league team that popularized it) which had been dominating \"Overwatch\" metagame for several months prior to the 2019 season and had been frequently used by teams during Stage 1.\nDue to the tiebreaking issues in Stage 1, the League updated their tiebreaker rules to include head-to-head records across all stages, strength of schedule, and common opponents records.\nStage 3.\nStage 3 ran from June 6 to July 7, with the stage playoffs taking place from July 11 to 14. The stage marked the first time that assault map Havana was played in the Overwatch League. All matches in the fifth week of Stage 3 were played at the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre in Atlanta, Georgia. The event was the second of three \"Homestand Weeks\" of the season and was hosted by Atlanta Reign. Additionally, the Overwatch League hosted LGBTQ community Pride Day on June 7 at Blizzard Arena.\nStage 4.\nStage 4 ran from July 25 through August 25, with matches in the fifth week taking place at The Novo by Microsoft in Los Angeles as the final \"Homestand Week\".\nStage 4 introduced a forced 2-2-2 team composition – 2 damage heroes, 2 support heroes, and 2 tank heroes, as a means of eliminating a metagame composition that became dominant in the league made of three tanks and three supports, otherwise known as \"GOATS,\" named after the Overwatch Contenders team that popularized it. This GOATS composition was difficult to counter at this level of play and was deemed boring to watch. Blizzard had tried to introduce changes in the game to better counter GOATS, but these failed to materialize. In the forced 2-2-2 composition, players are role locked at a start of a map, though they are free to switch heroes within that role during the map. Between maps, along with normal player substitutions, players can then swap roles. This change also came to normal quickplay and competitive mode in \"Overwatch\" outside of the league at the end of September 2019.\nPostseason.\nPlay-in tournament.\nThe play-in tournament is a single-elimination tournament that took place August 30–31. Each match were first-to-four maps, with the higher seed selecting the first map and the loser of each subsequent map selecting the next. The winners of each quarterfinal match advanced to the semifinals, where they faced either the seventh- or eighth-seeded team, depending on their own seed. The winners of the semifinals qualified for the season playoffs and were seeded according to their regular season records.\nPlayoffs.\nEight teams competed in the OWL Playoffs – a double-elimination tournament – from September 5 to 29. The winner of each round of the Playoffs was determined by a single-match, where each match winner was determined by which team wins four maps. The final two teams remaining in the tournament advanced to the Grand Finals, which took place at Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on September 29.\nNotable events.\nShanghai Dragons win first match.\nIn the 2018 season, the Shanghai Dragons failed to win a match, going 0–40 throughout the regular season. The franchise released eight of their eleven players going into the 2019 season. The Dragons lost their first two matches of the 2019 regular season, bringing their loss streak to 42 matches — the longest loss streak in professional sports history at the time. On February 22, 2019, the Dragons defeated the Boston Uprising, giving the franchise their first win.\nSale of the Houston Outlaws.\nOn June 12, 2019, Immortals Gaming Club (IGC), the parent company of Immortals and Los Angeles Valiant, acquired Infinite Esports, the parent company of Houston Outlaws and OpTic Gaming, marking the first sale of any Overwatch League franchise. Both Riot Games and Activision Blizzard approved the sale. By OWL rules, one company may not own more than one OWL franchise, so IGC had to operate the Valiant and Outlaws as entirely separate entities, with oversight by OWL representatives, until IGC sold the Outlaws. In November 2019, IGC sold the Outlaws to the Beasley Media Group.\nAll-Star Game.\nThe 2019 Overwatch League All-Star Game was the Overwatch League's second edition of an all-star game that involved the All-Star players of the league. The game was played on May 16, 2019, and was the culmination of the league's All-Star Weekend, a two-day event that consisted of the Talent Takedown, a Widowmaker 1v1 tournament, and the All-Star Arcade. All of the events were played at Blizzard Arena in Burbank, California. The game was televised by ESPN2 and streamed live on Twitch.\nWinnings.\nTeams in the 2019 season competed for a total prize pool of across regular season play, stage finals, and playoffs. By League rules, at least 50% of these winnings are split among the team's members, the remaining going to the team's owner.\nStage 1 Playoffs\nStage 2 Playoffs\nStage 3 Playoffs\nSeason Playoffs"

        "title": "All Native Basketball Tournament",
        "text": "The All Native Basketball Tournament is the largest basketball tournament in British Columbia and the largest Indigenous cultural event in Canada. The tournament is hosted by Prince Rupert, BC, and attracts upwards of 4.000 people, including the athletes, coaches, and spectators.\nCompetitors for the tournament span from Vancouver Island to Alaska. Peter Haugan, who is the president of the tournament, estimated that $4 to $5 million dollars is generated in Prince Rupert from the annual tournament being held in the city. \nThe All Native Basketball Tournament was founded on Village Pride and it is what separates this event from other tournaments and events. \nHistorical overview.\nThe All Native Basketball Tournament was established in 1947 as the Northern British Columbia Coast Indian Championship Tournament (NBCCICT). The first tournament in 1947 was held in the Roosevelt Gymnasium where 400 people came out to support the event. The tournament was created in order to build the Native community through friendly competition. In 1953, the NBCCICT was cancelled due to lack of interest amongst the tribes. In 1959, the tournament was resurrected and began play on March 2, 1960, under the new name the All Native Basketball Tournament. \nTournament breakdown and past champions.\nThe All Native Basketball Tournament has four divisions with approximately 50 teams competing throughout all the divisions. When the tournament restarted back up in 1960, there were only two divisions, Senior and Intermediate. The 1960 tournament had 15 teams competing for their two respective titles. In 1993, the basketball tournament expanded to include two new divisions, Women’s and Masters. \nThe Senior division has had many teams dominate for long stretches of time, accumulating many championships. In 1997, Hydaburg got their first tournament win, and they currently hold the record for the most Senior championship victories with 13. Hydaburg (Alaska) has the most Masters championships in the tournament with seven. In the intermediate division, the wins have been more dispersed between many teams and Metlakatla (Alaska) currently has the most championship wins with eight. In the Women’s division, Metlakatla (British Columbia) has accumulated the most championships wins with eight. \nControversy.\nIn 2016, a problem occurred with a player’s eligibility in the tournament. Josiah Wilson, a status member of the Heiltsuk Nation, was not permitted to play in the 2016 edition of the All Native Basketball Tournament. The tournament organizers deemed that Wilson was ineligible to participate as he did not have sufficient Indigenous ancestry based on his blood quantum. Wilson is a native of Haiti; his adopted mother is white, and his adopted father is a part of the Heiltsuk Nation. Previous to this ruling by the organizers, Wilson participated at the tournament on two separate occasions for the Heiltsuk Nation, as he is a status member. \nWilson was set to take the case in front of the B.C. Human Rights Tribunal after his denial to play again in 2017, but the organizers of the tournament came to a settlement with Wilson instead. The organizers agreed that Wilson was eligible to participate in all future tournaments and that they would make a public apology. This Wilson case led to the eligibility rules for the All Native Basketball Tournament being amended; currently, a status card or other written information on an individual’s heritage is used instead of blood quantum to assess eligibility. The Wilson case was profiled in Yasmine Mathurin's 2021 documentary film \"One of Ours\".\nIn 2018, another player eligibility issue arose before the tournament. Perry Terrell was deemed to be ineligible to compete for his preferred team, which is the Prince Rupert Synergy Storm. Terrell competed for this team in previous years but was deemed ineligible by the tournament organizers as he was a resident of Kincolith Village with his father for part of the year instead of Prince Rupert.\nThe tournament organizers ruled that because Terrell was not a permanent resident of Prince Rupert, he could not participate for their organization in the tournament. The tournament organizers are allowing Terrell to play in the tournament, however, he must play for a team from Kincolith. Terrell’s coach filed a complaint with the B.C. Human Rights Tribunal to fight for Terrell’s right to play for Prince Rupert once again. \nIn 2017, teams were told by tournament organizers that they were banned from wearing politically sensitive gear. This subject came to light when the Skidegate Saints, a Senior division team, wore shirts that had NO LNG written on them, which was their way of protesting the development of liquefied natural gas plants in the area.\n2019 tournament.\nThe 2019 tournament took place from February 10 to February 16. The games were broadcast via live web broadcast and radio so that the games were more accessible. Tournament officials sought to expand the tournament and want it to be recognized by all people throughout Canada, not just Native individuals.\n2019 tournament winners"

        "text": "Night Swimming is the third studio album from the American rock band Dentist.\nContent.\nThe eleven-track album was released on 12-inch vinyl, compact disc and digital download with Cleopatra Records, on July 20, 2018. It was recorded at Simple Sounds Studios in Oceanport, New Jersey, produced by Andy Bova and Justin Bornemann, mixed by Andy Bova and mastered by Jürgen Engler. Lyrically, \"Night Swimming\" focuses on social anxiety, heartache and loss, and love and optimism. On the record's songwriting, Emily Bornemann says they were \"attracted to rawness and simplicity, but melodically we lean[ed] towards a pop aesthetic,\" and J. Bornemann notes the album was \"an attempt to capture all the different aspects of ourselves and create something that we would want to listen to.\" E. Bornemann says the title-track 'is one of the best examples of expressing [my] true feelings.\" The album draws comparison to the music of Fazerdaze, The Primitives, The Cardigans, and Soft Science.\nThe music video for the song \"The Latter\" was written, directed and edited by Dana Yurcisin, with additional production by Biff Swenson, cinematography by Greg Papalcure and art and light direction by Chris York. It was filmed in Allentown, Pennsylvania, East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, Centralia, Pennsylvania and Beachwood, New Jersey. Yurcisin explains that the music video is about \"blaming oneself for romantic failures. Instead of taking the often tread route of showing a relationship in decay, we thought it'd be interesting to play with the idea of an actual second self, a doppelgänger containing all of her flaws, self-destructive tendencies, [and] she's her own living nightmare.\"\nReception.\nA review by Alex McLevy in \"The A.V. Club\" says \"throughout the record the group takes its surf-rock stylings in unexpected directions, whether it's the hard-charging riffs of the title track, or the slow-build indie-groove churn of \"Owl Doom Pt. 2.\"\" Bob Makin in \"Institute for Nonprofit News\" notes that \"Night Swimming\" \"shed[s] an occasional sense of silliness for a lyrically stark and sonically focused collection that laughs at life's absurdities and cries at its hardships with stinging, ringing riffs, solid slabs of rhythm and mournful, hopeful poetics,\" adding that the \"signature fuzz tones and a poppy undertow remain intact among a cryptically detailed loss of innocence that makes [it their] best record to date.\" It is described as \"highly accessible[,] fresh, enjoyable and full of energy\" by the FM radio station WRAT.\n\"The Big Takeover\" writes the song \"Upset Words is a \"potent sonic sea spray [of] riding choppy guitar waves and propulsive drum rhythm. A deeper undercurrent of bass churns around Emily Bornemann's sweetly buoyant vocals that are tinged with sandy grit.\" \"Impose\" says the song \"The Latter\" is a \"perfect slice of everything that makes Dentist's surf-pop sound so enticing as Emily's vocals ride over Justin's furious fret work and Nicks['s] driving, locked in rhythms.\" It won the 2018 Asbury Park Music Awards' Song of the Year award."

        "title": "Super Bowl LVII halftime show",
        "text": "The Super Bowl LVII halftime show, officially known as the Apple Music Super Bowl LVII Halftime Show, was the halftime entertainment of Super Bowl LVII, which took place on February 12, 2023, at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. It featured Barbadian singer Rihanna as the headline performer. It was televised nationally in the U.S. by Fox, Fox Deportes, and the Fox Sports and NFL apps, and was the first Super Bowl halftime show to be sponsored by Apple Music. Reaching over 121 million concurrent viewers, it was the most-watched Super Bowl halftime show until the record would be broken the following year. Rihanna was pregnant during the performance.\nBackground and overview.\nIn October 2019, Bajan singer Rihanna revealed to \"Vogue\" that she had turned down an offer from the National Football League (NFL) to perform at the Super Bowl LIII halftime show in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick. In 2016, Kaepernick knelt during the national anthem at the start of NFL games in protest of police brutality and racial inequality in the United States. He later filed a grievance against the NFL and its owners in November 2017, accusing them of colluding to keep him out of the league. Kaepernick withdrew the grievance in February 2019, ahead of Super Bowl LIII, after reaching a confidential settlement with the NFL.\nOn September 22, 2022, the NFL announced that the new naming rights sponsor for the Super Bowl halftime show would be Apple Music starting with Super Bowl LVII, replacing sponsor Pepsi, which had sponsored the previous ten halftime shows. Some media reports alleged on social media that American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift would be the headlining performer, based on her associations with Apple and traditional Pepsi rival, Coca-Cola. Subsequently, various outlets reported that Swift had turned down the offer, claiming that she would not do the halftime show until her re-recording process was complete.\nOn September 25, 2022, the NFL announced that Rihanna would headline the halftime show. The performance would be Rihanna's first live performance in five years since appearing at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards in 2018. In an interview with Apple Music's Nadeska Alexis, several days before the halftime show, Rihanna said she was on the 39th version of the show's set list. In the days leading up to the halftime show, Rihanna teased in an interview with Nate Burleson that she might bring out a \"surprise\" guest. It was confirmed following the show that she was pregnant with her second child.\nReception.\nChris Richards of \"The Washington Post\" believed Rihanna \"made the biggest show of her life look easy\". Rating it 5 stars out of five, Mark Beaumont of \"The Independent\" called the gig \"a roaring success\". Jason Lamphier of \"Entertainment Weekly\" called it a \"low-stakes return\" for Rihanna, offering a \"slick, chic, serviceable survey of some of pop's best offerings of the past two decades.\"\n\"The Daily Beast\" Coleman Spilde argued \"Rihanna's performance may not have had the same level of spectacle as her peers, but it was distinctly Rihanna. She let the world move around her, showing off decades of power and influence like she was simply clocking into work.\" \"Rolling Stone\" Rob Sheffield praised Rihanna for \"being a boss and a half on her flying stage, reigning supreme\" without any guests or surprises. However, he wrote that \"two consecutive Kanye songs\", \"All of the Lights\" and \"Run This Town\" felt \"mighty strange\". Steven McIntosh of BBC News wrote \"The singer rattled through several recognisable hits, front-loading her set with some of her most danceable and up-tempo numbers including \"Only Girl (In The World)\" and the excellent \"Where Have You Been\". It was a half-time show not short on spectacle, even once she had been lowered to the ground.\nIn a review for \"The New York Times\", Adrian Horton argued \"Rihanna — one of the crucial pop hitmakers of the 21st century — needs the Super Bowl less than the Super Bowl needs her, and her performance was a master class in doing exactly enough.\" \"The San Diego Union-Tribune\" George Varga opined that the show was \"more a triumph of choreography\" than music, adding that \"Rihanna crammed so many songs — make that, parts of songs — into her set that few of them had a chance to breathe, let alone gain traction and take flight.\" At NJ.com, Bobby Olivier criticized some of the setlist choices and felt Rihanna lacked showmanship, opining that \"this halftime show will go down as one of the lamest offerings in recent memory.\"\nCommercial impact.\nRihanna's performance attained more than 121 million viewers across TV and digital platforms, overtaking the NBC airing of Katy Perry's Super Bowl XLIX halftime show (2015) to become the most-watched halftime show in U.S. television history and marking the first time since the latter to record consecutive years of Super Bowl halftime show and overall game viewership increase. In comparison, the Super Bowl telecast as a whole had an average viewership of 115.1 million, the largest average audience for any U.S. television broadcast.\nFollowing the performance, \"Billboard\" reported that Rihanna's song catalogue received a leap of 140% across all on-demand streaming services in the US. On February 12–13, her songs received 62.2 million on-demand official streams nationwide. Sales-wise, she sold 42,000 downloads in the US during those two days. \"Umbrella\" and \"Diamonds\" were Rihanna's most streamed songs following the performance, with 3.8 million and 3.2 million streams on February 12–13 respectively. In the week ending February 16, Luminate reported that Rihanna had earned 166.13 million on-demand streams in the US across her full song catalogue. In doing so, she has received her best streaming week in the country ever. As a result of that, several of her songs re-entered the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart, including \"Umbrella\" at number 37, \"Diamonds\" at number 44, and \"We Found Love\" charted at number 48. \nThe same week, Rihanna's studio albums sold a total of 142,000 album-equivalent units in the country. For the week dated February 25, five of Rihanna's albums charted within the top 50 of the US \"Billboard\" 200 chart. \"Anti\" (2016) charted at number eight and managed to earn 36,000 equivalent albums in the country, 166% up, according to Luminate. Furthermore, \"Good Girl Gone Bad\" (2007) charted at number 15, \"Unapologetic\" (2012) at number 18, \"Loud\" (2010) at number 26, and \"Talk That Talk\" (2011) at number 49. With this feat, Rihanna became only the seventh act to place at least five albums in the top 50 on the \"Billboard\" 200 in the last 50 years.\nIn the week following the performance, Rihanna's albums \"Good Girl Gone Bad\" and \"Anti\" re-entered the top 50 of the Australian Albums Chart at number 32 and 35, respectively. The same week, both of the albums also re-entered the UK Albums Chart; \"Anti\" at number 39 and \"Good Girl Gone Bad\" at number 42. Additionally, \"Loud\" charted at number 81. On the Norwegian Albums Chart four of Rihanna's albums charted within the top 40 that same week, including \"Anti\" at number 19, \"Unapologetic\" at number 27, \"\" (2008) at number 36 and \"Loud\" at number 40.\nSet list.\nSetlist adapted from \"Today\" and \"Bustle\"."

It featured Usher as the headline performer, with guest appearances by Alicia Keys, will.i.am, Lil Jon, Ludacris, H.E.R, and Sonic Boom of the South.\nBackground.\nArtists in contention to headline the halftime show.\nThroughout summer 2023, there were various names being reported to be performing at the halftime show, including former One Direction member and British singer Harry Styles to promote his recent album \"Harry's House\", which won the Album of the Year Award at the 2023 Grammy Awards. Taylor Swift was reportedly considered for the show; she later pulled out of the running due to having prior commitments such as her Eras Tour, which was reported by \"Cosmopolitan\" in August 2023. Still, Swift was in attendance, leading to speculation that her popularity helped cause the actual football game (and the halftime show as a carryover) to become to the most-viewed television broadcast in modern history. Miley Cyrus was another artist also being considered to headline the show. Other rumored artists included Bad Bunny, Jack Harlow, and NSYNC. Usher was informed of his selection on August 11, 2023.\nHeadliner announcement.\nOn September 27, 2023, it was announced that Usher would headline the show with this being his second appearance at a halftime show following the Super Bowl XLV halftime show which was headlined by American musical group the Black Eyed Peas where he was a guest alongside Slash, making Raymond the first act to perform during both a Super Bowl and an NBA Finals. He had been reported to be a potential headliner for a while after extending at the MGM Grand Garden Arena. His participation is the latest result of the National Football League (NFL)'s partnership with Jay Z's entertainment agency Roc Nation, which was signed in 2019 to boost the quality of the halftime shows. Coincidentally, Usher marked his thirtieth anniversary as a solo artist (1994-2024), and the lead-up to his headlining prominently made note of that fact. After his announcement as the headliner, he said: \"It's a honor of a lifetime to finally check a Super Bowl performance off my bucket list. I can't wait to bring the world a show unlike anything else they've seen from me before\". Speaking to Apple Music's Zane Lowe on potential guests, he said, \"Well, one thing I can say is that I have collaborated with a lot of incredible artists throughout the years,\" including fellow singers and rappers Alicia Keys, will.i.am, Lil Jon, Ludacris, and H.E.R. playing guitar.

Six teams competed in the OWL Playoffs.\nThe winner of each round of the Playoffs was determined by a best-of-three match series, with match determined by best-of-five maps. The Quarterfinals had the third-seeded team playing the sixth-seeded team, while the fourth-seeded team played the fifth-seeded team. In the Semifinals, the top-seed team played the lowest remaining seed, while the second-seeded team played the next-lowest. The winners advanced to the Grand Finals, which took place at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York on July 27–28.\nLondon Spitfire defeated Philadelphia Fusion in the Grand Finals to become the first Overwatch League Champions.\nMap pool and rotation.\nThe postseason map pool consisted of eight maps, with a ninth map as the tie-breaking map (if necessary), and was decided by a lottery system on June 19.\nParticipants.\nSix teams qualified for the Season Playoffs based on their season overall records. The two division leaders were awarded the top two seeds, and the following top four teams, regardless of division, were awarded seeds three through six.\nQuarterfinals.\n(3) Boston Uprising vs. (6) Philadelphia Fusion.\nThe Fusion pulled off a 2–1 victory in their first match against the Uprising, who had been high in the standings early in the regular season but had lost momentum in the latter half. Fusion used a tank-heavy roster, including Reinhardt played by Sado, which forced the Uprising to move away from their sniper-based strategy. Fusion's Eqo and Carpe also showed skill across several heroes to help with the victory.\n(4) Los Angeles Gladiators vs. (5) London Spitfire.\nThe Spitfire had been underdogs in their match against the Gladiators, having never won a regular season match against them. The Gladiators took the first match, 3–0, including a trick play that involved Surefour staying in the spawn room as a different hero until well into the match before changing to his regular Widowmaker hero and readily picking off the open Spitfire players. This was later known as \"THE GREAT BAMBOOZLE\". The Spitfire responded in the following matches with adaptive changes in their team composition that prevented the Gladiators from maintaining their defense lines. Notably, the Gladiators chose to bench their primary main tank player Fissure, who came second place for Season MVP, for the playoffs, opting instead to replace him with the team's other main tank player, . The official reason given for this decision was that \"the Gladiators believe that the most effective practice and preparation is necessary in order to perform well in playoffs.\"\nSemifinals.\nAfter each quarterfinal series, the sixth-seeded Fusion, being the lowest seed of the two quarterfinals winners, faced the top-seeded Excelsior, whereas the fifth-seeded Spitfire played against the second-seeded Los Angeles Valiant. The semi-final saw upsets in both brackets with the lower-seed Fusion and Spitfire winning over the top seeds Excelsior and Valiant.\n(1) New York Excelsior vs. (6) Philadelphia Fusion.\nFusion had taken the first series 3–0 over Excelsior. While the second set ran for all five maps, Fusion won the series and the spot in the Grand Finals.\n(2) Los Angeles Valiant vs. (5) London Spitfire.\nThe Spitfire had kept their traction from the victory over the Gladiators in the previous round, and took their spot in the finals after two matches, winning each 3–1 and 3–0.\nGrand Finals.\nThe London Spitfire defeated the Philadelphia Fusion in the Grand Finals series in 2 sets. The Spitfire's Jun-Young \"Profit\" Park was named the Grand Finals Most Valuable Player; Profit was observed to be a key offensive player in the series, in one match using Hanzo's ultimate ability to eliminate five of the six Fusion players.\nWinnings.\nTeams in the Season Playoffs competed for a total prize pool of , with the payout division detailed below.\nBroadcast and viewership.\nOn the first day of the season playoffs, Disney and Blizzard announced a multi-year partnership that would bring the league and other professional \"Overwatch\" competitive events to ESPN, Disney XD, and ABC, starting with the playoffs and throughout all of the following season. The partnership marked the time that a live esports competition had aired on ESPN in prime time and the first time that an esports competition had aired on ABC. Nielsen ratings for the Grand Finals include a 0.18 rating (approximately 218,000 households) for the Friday match airing on ESPN, while the recap of the series airing on ABC on the Sunday after the event had a 0.3 rating (approximately 359,000 households). Blizzard estimated that over a million people were watching the Grand Finals at any time, between broadcast and streaming formats, with a total viewership of over 10.8 million."

        "text": "One city submitted a bid to host the 1995 Pan American Games that was recognized by the Pan American Sports Organization (OPEPA). Honoring an agreement that was made after Mar del Plata withdrew their bid for the 1991 Pan American Games, OPEDA selected Mar del Plata as the host city for the 1995 games at the ODEPA Assembly in Havana, Cuba in October 1989.\nCandidate cities.\nMar del Plata, Argentina.\nIn 1986, at the ODEPA Assembly in Barbados, Mar del Plata was bidding against Havana, Cuba to host the 1991 Pan American Games. Mar del Plata argued that, due to PASO regulations, Havana was not eligible to host the games, since Central America's turn to host the games was in 1987. However, due to bid withdrawals, Indianapolis hosted the 1987. Cuba responded by threatening to boycott the 1987 Games if they were not awarded that 1991 games. This would have been an issue, as Cuba was the second-largest contender in the Pan Am Games.\nAs tensions grew between the committees, president of the Puerto Rico Olympic Committee, Germán Rieckehoff asked Mar del Plata if they would consider withdrawing their bid, noting that Argentina hosted the inaugural Pan American games, and Cuba had never held the games. To avoid discord in the Pan American unity, the Argentina Committee withdrew their bid in favor of Havana, understanding the reasoning of the Cuban community. Following the withdrawal, ODEPA promised to award Mar del Plata the 1995 Pan American Games; in October 1989 at the OPEDA Assembly in Havana, the agreement was honored, and Mar del Plata was awarded the 1995 Games in a unanimous vote.\nLegacy.\nArgentina's act to avoid a riff and preserve unity between the Pan American nations was cemented in history. On September 26, 2002, The Honorable Deliberative Council (HCD) unanimously approved sanction file DE 12024-4-2002, Ordanance No. 14910, establishing November 14 as \"Pan American Friendship Day,\" signed by the President of the HCD Gustavo Pulti and promulgated by Intendant Daniel Katz on October 9, 2002."

Members of the Big Sky Conference, the Wildcats were led by first-year head coach Neil McCarthy and played their home games on campus at Wildcat Gym in Ogden, Utah. They were overall in the regular season and in conference play.\nThis was McCarthy's first full season as head coach; he had been promoted in the middle of the previous season, following the sudden resignation of Gene Visscher in late January.\nThe Wildcats were regular season co-champions with Idaho State and Boise State, and the league champion hosted the new conference tournament. The seeding of the three co-champions for the four-team bracket was done by a random draw in late February, conducted via a Saturday night conference telephone call by commissioner John Roning from Moscow, Idaho.\nWeber was drawn as the top seed, which included the right to host at Wildcat Gym in Ogden. At this time, both Weber and Boise still played in small gymnasiums, while ISU's Minidome had more than double the seating capacity of the others.\nThe Wildcats defeated fourth-seeded Northern Arizona in the semifinal, but lost to Boise State in the final in double overtime.\nFor the third consecutive year, senior forward Jimmie Watts was named to the all-conference team, this time as a unanimous choice. Senior center Al DeWitt was on the second team, and senior forward Paul Marigney was honorable mention.\nPostseason results.\n!colspan=5 style=| Big Sky tournament"

There is a separate page, all about granite domes of Yosemite. At present, its references focus on rock climbing, but others are free, to add references about hiking. It is available under Granite Domes of Yosemite National Park, as the page is not specific to Tuolumne Meadows; the table of domes may be sorted, so you may look at a chosen area.\nHiking.\nMany backcountry hiking and backpacking trails start in or near Tuolumne Meadows. The John Muir Trail and the Pacific Crest Trails are long-distance backpacking trails that go through Lyell Canyon into Tuolumne Meadows. Tuolumne Meadows also feature a wide range of day trails. Day hike trails are popular, and get busy in the summer high season. These trails are serviced by the Tuolumne Meadows shuttle bus, typically from June to September, though dates vary due to weather.\nHiking destinations:\nRock climbing.\nIn Tuolumne, rock climbing is popular, and there are many granite domes, there and elsewhere in Yosemite.\nIn contrast to the big walls of Yosemite Valley, climbing at Tuolumne generally consists of short- to medium-length routes on eleven major domes and several minor ones; see Granite Domes of Yosemite National Park. As the area is all at a high elevation, climbing season is mainly limited to June through September.\nIn Tuolumne, granite tends to be knobby, moreso than Yosemite Valley.\nThe rock is porphyritic granite, a very strong form of granite, plus granodiorite; see Cathedral Peak Granodiorite and Kuna Crest Granodiorite. It has a tendency to exfoliation, which produces and preserves distinctive \"onion dome\" shapes. Resulting climbing includes both face and crack routes, face routes often runout due to limited numbers of bolts, and crack routes frequently following very thin cracks. Local ethic is to limit the placement of bolts on new routes and to forbid the addition of bolts to existing routes, resulting in distances of or more between bolts.\nMany domes are in Tuolumne area. Major (and minor) domes include:\nEcho Peaks have been hiked, but are usually rock-climbed, as Ragged Peak may be scrambled, but is also rock climbed. Mountain that are not usually walk-ups, but typically rock-climbs:\nMountain climbing.\nAround Tuolumne Meadows, mountain climbing is quite popular; for the highest mountains in the entire park, see the highest mountains of Yosemite National Park.\nA few mountains that can be climbed, out of Tuolumne Meadows:"

The Warriors were ranked either No. 1 or No. 2 from January 1971 through the end of the regular season and finished the regular season undefeated with a record of 28–0. The team advanced to the 1971 NCAA University Division basketball tournament where it defeated Miami and SEC champion Kentucky, but lost to Ohio State. The team finished with a 28–1 record.\nThe team was coached by Al McGuire who was selected by the Associated Press as the college coach of the year for the 1970-71 season. McGuire was later inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\nGuard Dean Meminger was the team's captain and leading scorer, averaging 21.2 points per game. Center Jim Chones was the leading rebounder with an average of 11.5 rebounds per game. After the season, Meminger was selected as a first-team player on the 1971 All-America team, and Chones received first-team honors on the 1972 All-America team. Meminger and Chones both went on to have successful careers in professional basketball.\nThe team's sole loss was by a 60-59 score against Ohio State in the NCAA Tournament. Pacific Eight Conference referee Mel Ross called a controversial fifth and final foul on Meminger, depriving Marquette of its most valuable player for the game's final five minutes. After the season, Marquette named referee Ross to its \"all-opponent team\".\nPrior to losing to Ohio State, Marquette had compiled a 39-game winning streak dating back to the previous season."

Murdoch missed out on playing in the 1949, 1950 and 1951 grand finals due to Churchill being in the team.\nIn 1952, Churchill suffered an injury during the season and Murdoch finally was given a chance to play more regularly in the team. Murdoch played at fullback in the 1952 NSWRL grand final against Western Suburbs. Souths would lose the grand final 22-12. The match was remembered due to its controversy with claims the referee George Bishop had put a big wager on Wests winning the game. Souths claimed that they were denied two fair tries and Wests had scored one try off a blatant knock on.\nMurdoch missed out on playing in the 1953 and 1954 premiership victories but was then recalled to the starting team in 1955 due to another injury sustained to Churchill. Souths would reach the 1955 NSWRL grand final after a 9-game winning streak including coming from behind in both finals games.\nMurdoch played at fullback in the club's premiership victory over Newtown by a score of 12-11 which was played at the Sydney Cricket Ground in front of 45,000 spectators.

        "text": "Lewis \"Lew\" Bradley (1889 – 20 June 1918) was an English rugby union and professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1900s and 1910s. He played club level rugby union for Cinderford R.F.C., Lydney RFC and Pontypool RFC, and club level rugby league for Wigan as a winger.\nBackground.\nLewis Bradley was born in 1889 in Ruardean, Gloucestershire, England. He was the youngest of four brothers and two sisters born to John George and Ann Bradley. He lived with his family at The Roebuck Inn (now closed and occupied by a residential development called Roebuck Meadows).\nRugby career.\nRugby union.\nBradley began playing rugby with his local club, Cinderford R.F.C., and represented Gloucestershire at county level for the first time in 1908. He went on to play for Lydney RFC before moving to Wales to play for Pontypool RFC. While playing rugby at Pontypool, Bradley also worked as a butcher.\nRugby league.\nBradley changed rugby football codes from rugby union to rugby league on 1 December 1911, signing a professional contract with Wigan. He made his début on the following day in a 17–15 victory over Wakefield Trinity at Central Park. Scoring a try on his début, he was described by the Wigan Observer and District Advertiser as being \"Quick off the mark he was often past his opposing threequarter before the latter realised Bradley had the ball. Shall we ever forget this speedy wing threequarter at Central Park? He was the idol of the crowd and it only seems like yesterday that he was dashing down the touchline, his long flowing hair blowing in the wind, those long raking strides, and that final natural swerve\". At the end of his first season with the club, he played and scored a try against Huddersfield in the Championship Final during at Thrum Hall, Halifax on Saturday 4 May 1912, but Wigan went on to lose the match 5–13.\nDuring the 1912–13 season, Bradley played and scored two tries in Wigan's 21–5 victory over Rochdale Hornets in the 1912–13 Lancashire Cup Final at Weaste, Salford, on Wednesday 11 December 1912, in front of a crowd of 6,000. On Saturday 3 May 1913, he played in the Championship Final for the second season in a row, this time held at Belle Vue, Wakefield, but the team once again lost to Huddersfield.\nBefore the suspension of all competitive fixtures due to World War I at the end of the 1914–15 season, Bradley had scored an average of over one try per match (118 tries in 105 appearances), helping the team win the Lancashire League for four consecutive seasons. He also finished as the club's top try scorer in 1912–13 and 1913–14, with a total of 37 and 40 tries respectively.\nFirst World War.\nBradley joined the Army in 1915, but continued to play rugby for Wigan while training, and also appeared for Leeds as a guest. He made his final appearance for Wigan in February 1918, finishing his career with a total of 136 tries in 123 games. During the war, Bradley served as a Driver in the Royal Field Artillery regiment 96th Brigade unit.\nOn 18 June 1918, he sustained multiple shrapnel wounds while in action on the Western Front in France. Bradley later died from his wounds on 20 June 1918. He is buried in the Vignacourt British Cemetery in France, and he his honoured at the Wigan Cenotaph."

The AMA made a controversial decision allowing only American citizens to compete for the motocross national championship. The decision would exclude the defending 500cc national champion Dutchman Pierre Karsmakers who, was credited with helping raise the level of American motocross by stressing the importance of physical fitness and machine preparation. \nAlthough he was excluded from the overall results, Karsmakers competed for Yamaha in the 250cc class and won three of the nine rounds. Despite not having won a race overall, Can-Am's Gary Jones rode consistently to secure his third consecutive 250cc national championship riding three different brands of motorcycles. Can-Am hired second-ranked Marty Tripes away from the Husqvarna team before the last race of the season. With Can-Am rider Jimmy Ellis finishing the season ranked third, Can-Am would sweep the top three positions in the 250cc national championship although, Tripes rode most of the season for Husqvarna.\nIn the 500cc national championship, privateer rider Tony DiStefano led the championship for most of the year on a ČZ before an injury relegated him to second place behind Kawasaki factory rider Jimmy Weinert. The Honda factory team dominated the inaugural 125cc championship with rider Marty Smith leading a Honda sweep of the top four positions."

The Jayhawks, members of the Big 12 Conference, played their home games at Allen Fieldhouse in Lawrence, Kansas. They were led by 17th year Hall of Fame head coach Bill Self.\nSeason notes.\nThe Jayhawks attempted to rebound from losing six players through the draft and outgoing transfers, including Silvio De Sousa, who had been battling the NCAA regarding his eligibility. De Sousa did state if he wins his appeal regarding the NCAA declaring him ineligible, he would return to Kansas. On May 24, 2019, he won his appeal. Kansas was ranked 3rd in the preseason AP Poll, their 7th consecutive season beginning the season ranked in the top five. Additionally, it was the 201st consecutive poll the Jayhawks have been ranked in, which is the longest active streak in the nation. As of the poll released March 9, 2020, the Jayhawks have extended the streak to 219 consecutive polls ranked. They have not played a game as an unranked team since January 31, 2009.

It was the first time since the 2009-10 season that KU finished the regular season ranked first in the nation. Additionally, the Jayhawks led the nation in quadrant one wins, went undefeated against unranked teams and only lost games to ranked teams, one each at neutral site, home, and away.

That afternoon, the NCAA cancelled the 2020 NCAA tournament prior to the Big 12 naming an automatic bid. It was the first time in the tournament's history it had been canceled. After the cancellation, the NCAA stated it did not intend to name a national champion. \nFrom a standpoint of a mythical national championship claim that the program has not made, the program finished first in both wire service polls, which in college football (which the NCAA has never held a tournament at the FBS level) is recognised as a \"consensus\" national championship.

The total prize money for the race was US$12 million, with the winner receiving $7.2 million. This was an increase of $2 million on the previous year, making it the world's richest horse race in 2019.\nThe race was won for the second year running by Thunder Snow, who became the first horse to win the Dubai World Cup twice.\nEntries.\nA total of 13 horses were entered for the race, including Godolphin's defending champion Thunder Snow, who was bidding to become the first horse to win the race for a second time. Al Maktoum Challenge winners North America (Rounds 1 and 2) and Capezzano (Round 3) headed a strong local challenge from the United Arab Emirates, which also included Axelrod, Gronkowski and New Trails. The United States was also well represented with Pegasus World Cup runner-up Seeking The Soul, Breeders' Cup Classic runner-up Gunnevera, along with Audible, Pavel and Yoshida.

As the horses settled, Gronkowski moved through to challenge North America for the lead, with the leaders closely followed by Thunder Snow, Capezzano and New Trails. The positions at the front of the race remained unchanged until the final bend, where Capezzano and New Trails quickly faded. Into the home straight, North America started to drop back as Thunder Snow challenged Gronkowski for the lead. The two horses, now clear of the rest of the field, battled all the way to the line, with Thunder Snow getting up to win by a nose in a photo finish, becoming the first horse to win two Dubai World Cups. Gunnevera ran on from the back to take third place, with Pavel staying on to finish fourth."

Bogdan Bogdanović and Lučić combined for 43 points to lead Serbia, while Harrison Barnes had 22 for the United States.\nFifth place match.\nThis was the first game between the Czech Republic and Serbia in the World Cup. Serbia won in its last competitive game against the Czech Republic, in the 2016 FIBA World Olympic Qualifying Tournament. \nBehind a stingy defense and terrific perimeter shooting, Czech Republic erected a 50–41 lead at the half, but the Serbians got their act together in the last two periods to register their sixth win. Bogdan Bogdanović had the hot hand for Serbia with 31 points, and he was assisted well by Nikola Milutinov, who had 14. The Czechs, meanwhile, drew 16 points from Patrik Auda. Staring at a nine-point half-time deficit was not in Serbia's plans, but they rose to the occasion and turned the tables on the Czech Republic in the third quarter. The Serbians outscored their foes, 28–12, in that span to retake the lead for good.\nStatistics.\nStatistical leaders.\nTeam game highs.\n\"Source\"\nAftermath.\nThe Serbia roster ended their 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup campaign with a 6–2 record, finishing fifth.

Much of the team's modest success came during the fourteen-year tenure of Danny Nee, Nebraska's all-time winningest head coach. Nee led the Cornhuskers to five of their seven NCAA Tournament appearances and six NIT bids, including the 1996 NIT championship, NU's only national postseason title. After Nee was fired in 2000, Barry Collier was hired and led the program for six years until leaving to become athletic director at Butler University. Doc Sadler led the Cornhuskers through the school's transition from the Big 12 to the Big Ten, but like Collier, Sadler failed to make an NCAA Tournament appearance. Tim Miles returned Nebraska to the tournament in his second season, but did not make it back and was fired in 2019, when Nebraska hired former Chicago Bulls head coach Fred Hoiberg."

In the Quarterfinals, teams played a two-game series where the first team to reach 3 points was declared a winner (2 points for winning a game, 1 point each for tying). If both teams ended up with 2 points after the first two games a 20-minute mini-game used to determine a winner. Mini-game scores are in \"italics\". Beginning with the semifinals all games became Single-game eliminations. The winning teams in the semifinals advanced to the National Championship Game with the losers playing in a Third Place game.

In 1991, he was elected to the Illinois State High School Football Hall of Fame, and in 1992, the Waukegan Sports Hall of Fame. Upon his retirement, the \"Chicago Tribune\" described him as \"legendary\" and \"king of the north suburbs\".\nEarly life.\nAdams was born in 1936, in Waukegan, Illinois. He attended and played football at Waukegan High School, and after graduating, attended University of Illinois, where he played football for the Fighting Illini as a tackle and roomed with future Green Bay Packers star Ray Nitschke. Upon graduating, he served in the United States Army until his discharge in 1961, having attained the rank of Second Lieutenant. He then briefly taught at Highland Park High School, before transferring to Deerfield, where he remained until his retirement.\nCoaching career.\nAdams was initially an assistant coach at Deerfield, under then head coach Doug Kay. He became head coach in 1967 after Kay left to become defensive coordinator at Indiana State University. During Adams' tenure, his teams suffered only one losing season, attained a lifetime record of 220-56, and were Illinois State Champions in 1975. DHS were State runners up in 1977, 1981, and 1984, and appeared in the Class 5A State playoffs a record 15 times. In 1976, he participated in the annual University of Michigan football clinic with then New York Jets coach Lou Holtz and Michigan coach Bo Schembechler. Adams and his assistants were noted for their inspiring speeches to their players, and their support for each other during times of crisis; when Adam's mother died in 1986, the entire team attended her funeral. In 1987, the \"Chicago Tribune\" listed DHS under Adams as the second most successful football team in the Chicago area over the prior ten years, with a record of 93-19. Over the years, he was frequently noted for his success, and later referred to as \"legendary\" by multiple publications."

There were 110 competitors from 14 nations, with each nation sending a team of up to 8 men. The event was won by Aleksanteri Saarvala of Finland, the nation's first victory in the event. Germany took silver and bronze, as Konrad Frey finished second and Alfred Schwarzmann finished third.\nBackground.\nThis was the sixth appearance of the event, which is one of the five apparatus events held every time there were apparatus events at the Summer Olympics (no apparatus events were held in 1900, 1908, 1912, or 1920). Seven of the 12 gymnasts from 1932 returned: silver medalist Heikki Savolainen, bronze medalist Einari Teräsvirta, and fourth-place finisher Ilmari Pakarinen of Finland, fourth-place finisher István Pelle and seventh-place finisher Miklós Péter of Hungary, tenth-place finisher Al Jochim of the United States, and eleventh-place finisher Savino Guglielmetti of Italy. Savolainen, Pelle, Péter, and Jochim had competed in 1928 as well. The 1928 gold medalist, Georges Miez of Switzerland, was also back in Berlin. Miez had finished second in the 1934 world championship to Ernst Winter of Germany, also competing in front of his home nation.\nAustria, Bulgaria, and Romania each made their debut in the men's horizontal bar. The United States made its fifth appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the inaugural 1896 Games.\nCompetition format.\nThe gymnastics format returned to the aggregation format used in 1928 but not in 1932. Each nation entered a team of eight gymnasts (Bulgaria had only 7). All entrants in the gymnastics competitions (Neri of Italy did not compete in the horizontal bar) performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise, with the scores summed to give a final total. The scores in the horizontal bar were added to the other apparatus scores to give individual all-around scores; the top six individual scores on each team were summed to give a team all-around score. No separate finals were contested.\nThe compulsory exercise was described in the Official Report:"

        "text": "In 2019 Kent County Cricket Club competed in Division One of the County Championship after gaining promotion in the 2018 season, the Royal London One-Day Cup and the 2019 t20 Blast.\nThe season was the third in charge for head coach, and former player, Matthew Walker. Sam Billings retained the club captaincy that he was first awarded in 2018. With Billings and vice-captain Joe Denly playing in the Indian Premier League, which ran until 5 May, Heino Kuhn was announced as interim captain for the early part of the season. Following an injury to Billings in April, Denly and Kuhn captained the side during the first half of the season, with Kuhn standing in as captain in June and July to allow Denly to focus on his batting following a period of poor form.\nSquad.\nDepartures.\nAt the end of the 2018 season, and after an 18-year career with Kent, former England off-spinner James Tredwell announced his retirement from cricket. Tredwell represented England in two Tests, 45 One Day Internationals and 17 T20 Internationals. Will Gidman and Matt Hunn also retired from professional cricket when their contracts expired.\nSpin bowler Adam Riley left the club by \"mutual consent\" in June, having played four matches during the season. Riley had joined the club in 2011 and made over 100 appearances for Kent. Veteran all-rounder Darren Stevens was loaned out to Derbyshire for the T20 Blast competition in July. Stevens, who had not played for Kent in the 2018 Blast, was not part of the county's plans for the competition but wanted to play T20 cricket during the season with an eye to maintaining his fitness if required by Kent.\nIn July, it was reported that 43 year-old all-rounder Darren Stevens would not be offered a new contract after the 2019 season. However, after a string of strong performances featuring a sequence of 445 runs and 34 wickets in five championship matches, including a ten-wicket match haul against Nottinghamshire and a career high score of 237 against Yorkshire, the club made a u-turn and Stevens signed an extension.\nIn September, the club announced that seamer Mitchell Claydon would be leaving after seven years at the end of the season to join Sussex.\nArrivals.\nIn September 2018, Kent announced the signing of 24 year-old seam bowler Matt Milnes from Nottinghamshire on a three-year deal beginning at the start of the 2019 season. Milnes had played only eight first-class matches, making his Nottinghamshire debut in June, and previously having played for Durham MCCU. On 1 October 2018, Kent announced another signing for the 2019 season with Dutch international left-arm fast bowler Fred Klaassen joining on a two-year contract. In October, Kent awarded a first professional contract to academy graduate wicketkeeper-batsman Jordan Cox.\nIn February, Kent announced the signing of English-born Australian international batsman Matt Renshaw as their overseas player for the early part of the season, making him available for the opening three County Championship matches and the entire Royal London One-Day Cup campaign. New Zealand fast bowler Adam Milne re-signed to play for the county in the T20 Blast later the same month and Afghanistan's veteran all-rounder Mohammad Nabi was also signed for the first 11 matches of the competition.\nIn May, Kent announced that Wiaan Mulder had signed with the county as the overseas player for seven County Championship matches. The South African all-rounder replaced Matt Renshaw after his stint ended in the middle of May, although he was only able to play in three matches before being recalled by South Africa to rest a foot injury ahead of their tour of India. On 5 June, Kent announced that South African fast bowler Hardus Viljoen was to rejoin the club for a second spell to play in the T20 Blast. Viljoen previously had a short spell with Kent at the end of the 2016 season and rejoins as a Kolpak signing. On 7 June, Middlesex off-spinner Ollie Rayner joined the county on loan for the last eight County Championship matches of the season and on 6 August Academy graduate Marcus O'Riordan signed his first professional contract, initially for the remainder of the season. On 25 August, Kent announced the signing of South Africa captain Faf du Plessis for their remaining two group matches of the T20 Blast, replacing the departed Mohammad Nabi. It was later announced that du Plessis would also play in the County Championship match against Yorkshire at Headingley, providing him with some first-class preparation prior to captaining South Africa in their Test series against India.\nAlso in August, Kent announced that they had signed Yorkshire all-rounder Jack Leaning on a three-year contract from October 2019. During their last game of the season, Kent announced the signing of teenage Afghan-born England Under-19 off-spinner Hamidullah Qadri on a three-year deal from the 2020 season. Shortly after the same match, Kent announced the signing of 35 year-old seamer Tim Groenewald from Somerset on a two-year deal from 2020.\nCounty Championship.\nThe season is Kent's first in Division One of the County Championship since 2010. They will play 14 matches, playing each of the seven other teams in the division twice, once at home and once away. Five of the county's home matches will be staged at the St Lawrence Ground, with one match at each of the Nevill Ground in Tunbridge Wells and County Cricket Ground, Beckenham.\nKent's first match of the season began on 5 April against Somerset at Taunton, although the whole of the first day was lost to rain and a wet outfield.\nOther first-class match.\nKent began the season with a three-day first-class match against Loughborough MCC University on 31 March as part of the 2019 Marylebone Cricket Club University Matches. With Joe Denly and Sam Billings away at the IPL and interim captain Heino Kuhn not in the side, Daniel Bell-Drummond stood in as captain for this match. Fred Klaassen and Matt Milnes made their Kent debuts in the match which was drawn after much of the final day was lost to rain. Sean Dickson scored Kent's first century of the season, with a score of 108 not out in the county's first innings.\nRoyal London One-Day Cup.\nKent played eight matches in the South Group in the 2019 Royal London One-Day Cup, winning only two matches in a competition that they had reached the final of in 2018. Four losses and an abandoned match at Cardiff to start the competition effectively knocked the county out of the knock-out stages before two wins against Surrey and Essex led to a seventh-place finish in the group.\nThe campaign saw maiden List A centuries for Matt Renshaw and Zak Crawley as well as a century for Daniel Bell-Drummond whilst bowler Matt Milnes took his first professional five wicket haul in Kent's first match of the competition, his List A debut. In April former England and Warwickshire batsman Jonathan Trott was announced as an additional coach for Kent's campaign.\nOther List A match.\nKent hosted a 50-over match against the touring Pakistan national side ahead of their One Day International series against England. Due to a number of injuries and other availability issues affecting a significant number of players, Kent were given permission by the ECB to include two guest players for this fixture. Middlesex seamer James Harris (who had previously had a loan spell with Kent during the 2017 season) and Essex's Dutch international seamer Shane Snater were both named in the team. Academy graduate Jordan Cox was also selected for his first senior appearance. Adam Rouse stood in as captain.\nStatistics.\nBatting.\nSource: Cricinfo\nBowling.\nSource: CricInfo"

After the announcement of the conclusion of the football program at Malone, Thomas became an assistant football coach for the Mount Union Purple Raiders in Alliance, Ohio beginning in the 2019 season. He had previously served as an assistant coach at Malone for the 2015 season.\nCoaching history.\nAssistant coaching and high school.\nThomas was the defensive coordinator at Walsh for 16 seasons and worked at Youngstown State from 1978-1986. He also was a high school head coach at Girard, Alliance, and GlenOak all in Ohio. He became an assistant coach at Malone for the 2015 season under Eric Hehman.\nMalone.\nWhen Coach Hehman resigned at Malone, it took the university just over 24 hours to offer the new head coach position to Thomas, something that Malone Athletic Director Charlie Grimes said was an easy move--a decision they said was based in confidence, excitement, respect, and heart. Thomas took over the program after its first winless year in school history and coached the team during its first season in the Great Midwest Athletic Conference. As the first season progressed, three teams including Malone had come together to start conference play in 2016 and Malone finished third among the three.\nAfter the conclusion of the 2018 season, Thomas heard the decision to discontinue the program fifteen minutes before having to tell his assistant coaches and players."

        "text": "The 2023 Netball World Cup (formerly known as the Vitality Netball World Cup 2023) was the sixteenth staging of the Netball World Cup, the premier competition in international netball, contested every four years. The tournament was held from 28 July to 6 August at the International Convention Centre in Cape Town, South Africa, its first time in Africa.\nThis marked the tournament's 60th anniversary, as it was founded in 1963.\nSixteen nations contested for the title and after two group stage rounds; England, Jamaica, Australia and New Zealand all made it to the semi-finals, with England qualifying for the final for the first time. Australia would take home their 12th title after defeating England 61–45. Jamaica finished in third place, after defeating New Zealand. Host nation South Africa finished sixth overall.\nOrganisation.\nThe host city and venue was announced by the International Netball Federation (INF) on 8 March 2019, only months prior to the staging of the 2019 edition in Liverpool, England. Cape Town's bid, supported by the South African Government and the Western Cape province, was selected by the INF ahead of a bid by Auckland, New Zealand. The INF stated the Cape Town bid would \"deliver a greater impact on the development of global netball\" and cited the pledges by the South African Government to invest heavily in preparation and development of the sport in the lead-up to the tournament.\nVenue.\nAll matches at the event were held at the Cape Town International Convention Centre.\nMascot.\nIn August 2022, the mascot was revealed for the tournament following a public competition. Designed by 11-year-old Violet Cassidy from Manchester, England; the mascot is an anthropomorphic meerkat named Letsasi, meaning \"sun.\"\nBroadcasters.\nThis is a list of the broadcasters for the tournament in competing countries and regions. For the first time in history, the event was recorded and produced by an all women crew from SuperSport (MultiChoice).\nAll other countries not listed below are able to subscribe to NetballPass to watch the tournament.\nTeams.\nSixteen teams contested the 2023 title. Six teams qualified automatically: the hosts, and the top five (other) teams in the World Netball Rankings. The remaining ten places were filled via five regional tournaments, with two teams qualifying from each.\nTeams which qualified automatically (in order of world ranking):\nSquads.\nThe sixteen competing nations selected 12-player squads for the tournament, with three additional reserve players named. Reserve players would be permanent replacements in the event of injury.\nFormat.\nThe format of the competition was the same as that introduced for the 2019 Netball World Cup. Teams competed in three stages; the Preliminaries Stage One (28–30 July), Preliminaries Stage Two (31 July–3 August) and the Play-offs and Placings matches (4–6 August).\nPreliminaries Stage One\nThere were four groups (A, B, C and D) of four teams in the first stage, with the top eight teams pre-assigned to their groups and one team from the 9th–12th seeds and one from the 13th–16th seeds drawn randomly into each group. No more than two teams from the one region can be drawn into the same group. The top three teams from each group progressed to the second preliminaries stage.\nPreliminaries Stage Two\nThe top three teams from Groups A and B formed Group F, and the top three teams from Groups C and D formed Group G. The bottom four finishers from Groups A-D competed against one another in Group E. Where teams in Groups F and G have already played each other in the Preliminaries Stage One (i.e. A1 has already played A2 and A3), these results will carry through to the Preliminaries Stage Two.\nPlay-offs and Placings\nThe teams finishing first and second in Groups F and G went through to the semi-finals, with the top placed team in each group facing the second placed team in the other group. The winners of each semi-final competed for gold in the final, with the losers playing for bronze.\nThe teams finishing third and fourth in Groups F and G competed for final positions fifth to eighth – third in one group plays fourth in the other – with the winners playing off for fifth place and the losers for seventh. The teams that finished fifth in Groups F and G played off for ninth and 10th places. The teams that finished last in Groups F and G played off for 11th and 12th places. The teams that finished first and second in Group E played off for 13th and 14th place and the teams that finish third and fourth in Group E played off for the 15th and 16th places.\nPreliminaries Stage Two.\nGroup E.\nGroup E contains the four bottom teams from Groups A-D and compete for final placings 13th to 16th.\nGroup F.\nThe top three teams from Groups A and B advance to Group F. All six teams previously played two matches against Group F teams – for example, each team in Group A played the two other Group A teams who advanced to Group F. At the start of Group F the table is initialised to include the results of these two Group A or Group B matches for each team. The former Group A teams play the former Group B teams in three rounds of three matches in Group F.\nTeams finishing first and second in Group F go through to the semi-finals – the top team in Group F plays the second team in Group G and the second team in Group F plays the top team in Group G. The four remaining teams in Group F compete for the final placings from 5th to 12th.\nGroup G.\nThe top three teams from Groups C and D advance to Group G. All six teams previously played two matches against Group G teams – for example, each team in Group C played the two other Group C teams who advanced to Group G. At the start of Group G the table is initialised to include the results of these two Group C or Group D matches for each team. The former Group C teams play the former Group D teams in three rounds of three matches in Group G.\nTeams finishing first and second in Group G go through to the semi-finals – the top team in Group G plays the second team in Group F and the second team in Group G plays the top team in Group F. The four remaining teams in Group G compete for the final placings from 5th to 12th.\nSemi-finals and medal matches.\nEngland finished top of Group F after the preliminary stages, defeating Australia 56–55 in their match, the first time that England had ever defeated Australia in the tournament. The Roses overcoming an eight-goal deficit in the third quarter to take a one goal win 56–55. Both teams had already qualified for the semi-final stage of the tournament.\nIn Group G, Jamaica pulled away from New Zealand to win 59–48, with both teams progressing through to semi-finals despite the loss for New Zealand.\nAs group winners, England faced five-time champions New Zealand, with Jamaica playing 11-time champions Australia.\nDefending champions New Zealand, looking to become the first Silver Ferns team to win consecutive tournaments, kept their semi final match against England tight in the first three quarters. The teams were tied at 32–all at three-quarter-time, but a dominant final quarter from England saw them take a 46–40 victory to progress to the final for the first time.\nIn the other semi final, Australia outlasted Jamaica in a see-sawing match. A dominant display from Diamonds vice-captain Steph Wood in the goal circle (scoring 29 goals from 32 attempts) helping Australia reach their ninth-straight final appearance. Australia's goal keeper Courtney Bruce earning player of the match honours for her ability to disrupt the efforts of the Sunshine Girls attacking duo of Jhaniele Fowler and Shanice Beckford.\nIn the bronze medal match, Jamaica took a three-goal lead into half time against New Zealand. Plagued by turnovers, Silver Ferns coach Noeline Taurua changed New Zealand's starting shooting circle combination of Maia Wilson and Ameliaranne Ekenasio for Te Paea Selby-Rickit and Tiana Metuarau after half time, but with Jamaica extending that lead in the third quarter to as much as eight goals, Wilson and Ekenasio returned again. Sunshine Girls shooter Jhaniele Fowler scored 43 goals from 44 attempts, while Jodi-Ann Ward was announced as the player of the match as Jamaica secured the bronze medal. \nFor New Zealand, it was the first time that they had finished the tournament without a medal placing finish.\nAustralia would enter the final as slight underdogs, after losing to England in the group phase. The Roses led by shooters Eleanor Cardwell and player of the tournament Helen Housby, would be met by ruthless defence in the gold medal match, with the Diamonds defenders pressuring their opponents into errors. Kiera Austin won the player of the final award, after entering the match in the second quarter. Austin and fellow shooter Sophie Garbin sparking a surge from Australia through the second and third quarters, with the Roses unable to go with the Diamonds.\nAustralia won the final 61–45 to claim their 12th Netball World Cup title, with the Diamonds adding to their 2022 Commonwealth Games gold medal victory."

Bangladesh's highest achievements in World Cup are reaching the Super Eight stage in the 2007 Cricket World Cup and the Quarter-Final of the 2015 Cricket World Cup.\nBangladesh at 1999 Cricket World Cup.\nBangladesh for the first time participated in Cricket World Cup in this edition as an associate member and were placed in the \"Group B\". Bangladesh played their first ever World cup match against New Zealand at County Ground in Chelmsford and they eventually lost the match by 6 wickets being bundled out for just mere 116 runs in first innings. They also lost their second group match against West Indies by 7 wickets. However Bangladesh tasted their first World Cup victory against another associate nation Scotland in their third group match courtesy of Minhajul Abedin's well made 68* where they defeated Scotland by 22 runs.\nHowever Bangladesh returned to their losing circle again in their next match against Australia where Australia beat them by 7 wickets. But in their very next match they stunned the cricket world by defeating Pakistan, the Champion of 1992 Cricket World Cup by 62 runs courtesy of good batting efforts of Akram Khan, Shahriar Hossain and a match winning bowling effort by Khaled Mahmud. This win also helped them acquiring Test status in the very next year.\nAfter the Group stage Bangladesh finished at fifth position with 2 wins and 3 losses.

In their third match West Indies managed 244 batting first, in the second inning Bangladesh could bat only 8 overs and match washed away due to heavy rain.\nIn none of their group matches Bangladesh could breach the line of 200-run marks while the match against Caribbeans washed away. Their highest team total in the tournament was against New Zealand where they posted 198 losing 7 wickets but the latter successfully chased that down with 7 wickets in hand. In their last group match they could not even chase 217 runs posted by Kenya and were folded in just 185 runs resulting in their 32-runs defeat and consequently Kenya progressed to the Super Six stage.\nSquads.\nCoach: Mohsin Kamal\nBangladesh at 2007 Cricket World Cup.\n16 teams (including 6 associates) participated in 2007 World Cup. For the first and only time the World Cup teams were divided into 4 groups, each group consisting 4 teams.

Above all, Bangladesh enjoyed a good tournament with two great wins against India and South Africa.\nSquads.\nCoach: Dav Whatmore\nBangladesh at 2011 Cricket World Cup.\nThis World Cup should have been so memorable to Bangladesh having the advantage of playing their all matches on home soil being the co-host along with India and Sri Lanka and having the much more balanced and experienced guys like Shakib Al Hasan, the skipper, Tamim Iqbal, Mushfiqur Rahim, Mahmudullah, Shahriar Nafees, Mohammad Ashraful and Abdur Razzak, but they failed to come up with the expectations. The opening ceremony was hosted at Bangabandhu National Stadium.\nThe World Cup opened with a match between co-hosts Bangladesh and India. While India batting first posted a huge total of 370 for 4 courtesy of Virender Sehwag's 175 and a century from Virat Kohli who in the process became first batsman to score a century on World Cup debut. In reply, Bangladesh started off rapidly in their chase, getting 51 runs in the first five overs; but soon, their top order got out but and the run-rate slowed after that and they were not in the hunt, and at the end they got to 283/9 without challenging the Indian total.\nIn their next match against Ireland, Bangladesh were all out scoring only 205 but in reply Ireland were folded out in 178 runs courtesy of Shafiul Islam's great bowling (4 wicket for 21 runs) who also recorded the best bowling figure by a Bangladeshi bowler.\nIn their third group match, Bangladesh were bowled out for 58 runs, which was their lowest ODI score, and the fourth lowest score in World Cup matches. In reply, the West Indies reached the target losing one wicket with 226 balls to spare.\nIn the next match England could only manage 225 runs before being bowled out, Bangladesh's score, in reply, was at one point 169/8 but Mahmudullah with the tail ender Shafiul Islam made unbeaten 58 run partnership for the 8th wicket that brought victory for the team. This win also accounted as \"One of their Greatest Victories of World Cup history\"\nIn the next match against Netherlands, Bangladesh reached the target of 161 runs so comfortably losing only 4 wickets with the courtesy of Imrul Kayes' fine half century and the tight bowling of Abdur Razzak in the first innings. Thus Bangladesh made record of winning all matches against the participating European teams (Ireland, England, Netherlands) in this World Cup.\nIn their last group match against South Africa, Bangladesh yet again suffered a drastic batting collapse being bowled out for just 78 runs and eventually lost the match by 206 runs and their hope for qualifying for Quarter-final was also ended. Though their points was same as West Indies (6) but their negative run-rates due to having drastic losses against South Africa, West Indies and India, fetched them the rude reality of being disqualified for Quarter-finals while England and West Indies qualified from Quarter finals with 1 point difference and only positive net run-rates respectively.\nSquads.\nCoach: Jamie Siddons\nBangladesh at 2015 Cricket World Cup.\nBangladesh team joined the World Cup campaign to Australasia with a balanced team of Experienced players like Mashrafe Mortaza, the skipper, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim, Mahmudullah, Tamim Iqbal, Rubel Hossain, Shafiul Islam and youngsters like Soumya Sarkar, Sabbir Rahman and Taskin Ahmed.

In this match Shakib also became \"first Bangladesh batsman to achieve 4000 ODI runs\". The clash between Australia and Bangladesh washed away for heavy rain and points were shared between two teams. In their third group match, Bangladeshi bowlers were clueless in front of Sri Lankan Batsman and Sri Lanka reached to the peak of runs (332/1 in 50 overs) with a blistering knock of 162* from Tillakaratne Dilshan and a well composed century from Kumar Sangakkara. In reply Bangladesh could only manage 240 runs in 47 overs before being all out with some handy contributions from middle order but no one could stand up with a big knock like their counterparts and consequently Sri Lanka won by 92 runs.\nIn their fourth group match, Bangladesh made history chasing 319 runs as it was their highest ODI run-chase and it was also the \"Second highest run-chase in Cricket World Cup history\"\nBatting first, Scotland posted 318 runs on board in terms of 8 wickets with the courtesy of Scotland's first World Cup century scored by Kyle Coetzer (156) and some handy knocks from middle order. In reply Tamim Iqbal and Mahmudullah gave a solid start after the quick fall of Soumya Sarkar and at one point Tamim brought the hope of finishing the century-less run of Bangladesh in World Cup but he fell 5 runs short. But Bangladesh did not make any mistake later and they reached the target with 11 balls to spare with the help of 50s from Mahmudullah, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim and a 42* from Sabbir Rahman.\nThis match was most important for both teams as the winner of this match could be qualified for the Quarter-finals. Bangladesh batting first, lost their both openers cheaply, then Soumya Sarkar gave some resistance with Mahmudullah, but soon they were in a part of bother with the quick fall of Sarkar and Shakib Al Hasan. Mushfiqur Rahim then joined Mahmudullah in the repairing job and both did well with the fifth wicket partnership of 141 which was the highest partnership for any wicket for Bangladesh in a World Cup match. In the process, Mahmudullah (103) became \"first Bangladeshi batsman to score a century at the World Cup\". Mushfiqur also joined the party with a quick-fire 89 and Bangladesh posted a total of 275 runs in 50 overs with the loss of 7 wickets. In reply, England started well but Moeen Ali got run out when team was on 43. From there wickets kept falling on regular intervals. Most of the players got good start while Ian Bell and Jos Buttler converted their scores into 50s. At one point they were 238/6, needing 37 runs in almost 4 overs and it was almost an easy task for them. Then Buttler and Chris Jordan got out making it 238/8, on the other hand Chris Woakes (42*) was carrying home to the cruise. When the team needed 15 runs in 12 balls Rubel Hossain came to bowl and bowled both Stuart Broad and James Anderson within a span of 3 balls and Bangladesh snatched a thrilling victory of 15 runs, securing their berths for Quarter-finals. This was also Bangladesh's second successive win against World Cup.\nBangladesh faced India in their first-ever Knockout stage appearance in World Cup history. India, batting first, posted 302 runs in 50 overs losing 6 wickets with the help of a fine century by Rohit Sharma (137) and a sixty-odds from Suresh Raina. In reply, all of the Bangladesh's top and middle order (except Imrul Kayes) batsman got good start but neither anyone could come up with a big knock nor they got a big partnership and wickets kept on falling on regular interval. Consequently, Bangladesh could only manage 193 runs losing all wickets in 45 overs, resulting in their 109 runs loss.\nThe umpires received widespread criticism after some controversial decision-making, calling a low full-toss delivery a no-ball, bowled by Rubel Hossain and Rohit Sharma who was on 90* then, was caught at deep mid-wicket. ICC President Mustafa Kamal said that Bangladesh would appeal against the decisions of the umpires in ICC's board meeting.\nSquads.\nCoach: Chandika Hathurusinghe\n1 On 23 February, Al-Amin Hossain was sent home from the tournament after breaking a team curfew.

All Quarterfinals matchups were held at home team venues, while all succeeding games were played in Stevens Point, Wisconsin.\nQualifying teams.\nThe following teams qualified for the tournament. There were no automatic bids, however, conference tournament champions were given preferential consideration. No formal seeding was used while quarter and semifinal matches were arranged so that the road teams would have the shortest possible travel distances. Because the semifinal series were played at home team venues the NCAA elected to select an equal amount of eastern and western teams.\nFormat.\nThe tournament featured three rounds of play. Starting in 1988, each round of the tournament consisted of a two-game series where the first team to reach 3 points was declared a winner (2 points for winning a game, 1 point each for tying). If both teams ended up with 2 points after the first two games a 20-minute mini-game used to determine a winner. Mini-game scores are in \"italics\". The teams were seeded according to geographic proximity in the quarterfinals so the visiting team would have the shortest feasible distance to travel.\nBracket.\n&lt;br&gt;"

The 2020 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament was scheduled to end in Atlanta on April 6, 2020, but was ultimately canceled. All other postseason tournaments were canceled as well. Practices officially began in late September.\nOn March 12, 2020, the NCAA announced that all remaining winter and spring championships for both men's and women's sports were canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was the first cancellation in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament history. The NCAA did not name an official national champion after the tournament was canceled.\nKansas finished first in both major polls but has yet to claim a national championship for the season.\nRule changes.\nOn June 5, 2019, the NCAA announced that its Playing Rules Oversight Panel had approved a suite of rules changes that its Men's Basketball Rules Committee had recommended the previous month. These changes took effect in 2019–20 for all NCAA divisions, with one exception.\nConference membership changes.\nTwo schools joined new conferences for the 2019–20 season. Both moved between Division I and Division II, with one joining Division I and the other leaving Division I.\nIn addition, two existing Division I teams assumed new athletic identities.\nAfter the 2018–19 school year, Long Island University (LIU) merged the athletic programs of its two main campuses—the Division I LIU Brooklyn Blackbirds and Division II LIU Post Pioneers—into a single program that now plays as the LIU Sharks. The Sharks inherited the Division I and Northeast Conference memberships of the Brooklyn campus, with some sports to be based in Brooklyn and others at the Post campus in Brookville, New York. Specific to basketball, LIU announced that the unified men's and women's teams in that sport would be based in Brooklyn.\nOn July 1, 2019, the University of Missouri–Kansas City (UMKC) announced that its athletic program, formerly known as the UMKC Kangaroos, would officially become the Kansas City Roos, with \"Roos\" having long been used as a short form of the former \"Kangaroos\" nickname.\nSeason outlook.\nPre-season polls.\nThe top 25 from the AP and USA Today Coaches Polls.\nRegular season.\nUpsets.\nAn upset is a victory by an underdog team. In the context of NCAA Division I Men's Basketball this generally constitutes an unranked team defeating a team currently ranked In the Top 25. This list will highlight those upsets of ranked teams by unranked teams as well as upsets of #1 teams. Rankings are from the AP poll.\nBold type indicates winning teams in \"true road games\"-i.e., those played on an opponent's home court (including secondary homes, such as Intrust Bank Arena for Wichita State).\nIn addition to the above listed upsets in which an unranked team defeated a ranked team, there were six non-Division I teams to defeat a Division I team this season. Bold type indicates winning teams in \"true road games\"—i.e., those played on an opponent's home court (including secondary homes).\nConference winners and tournaments.\nEach of the 32 Division I athletic conferences ends its regular season with a single-elimination tournament. The team with the best regular-season record in each conference is given the number one seed in each tournament, with tiebreakers used as needed in the case of ties for the top seeding. The winners of these tournaments receive automatic invitations to the 2020 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament.\nStatistical leaders.\nSource for additional stats categories\nPostseason.\nAll post-season tournaments were cancelled prior to completing the qualification process.\nAward winners.\n2020 Consensus All-America team.\n \nCoaching changes.\nA number of teams changed coaches during the season and after it ended."

North Sydney's loss in the grand final was attributed to the fact that Butler along with Harry Taylor and a couple of other players did not play in the game due to their service during war time.\nMilitary service.\nButler enlisted with the RAAF in 1940. He was a Flying Officer and flew with RAAF 460 Squadron in World War II. Butler was killed on 29 November 1944 when his plane was shot down over Germany."

        "title": "Eric Williams (basketball, born 1984)",
        "text": "Eric Bernard Williams, Jr. (born March 26, 1984) is an American-Bulgarian professional basketball player. One of the top prospects of the 2002 high school class, he played college basketball at Wake Forest where he was a 4-year starter. He went undrafted in the 2006 NBA draft and moved to Europe to play professional basketball, mainly in Italy with stints in France, Poland and Switzerland, and also had experiences in Kazakhstan, China and Uruguay.\nHigh school career.\nWilliams was born in Frankfurt, Germany to parents Eric and Debra (\"née\" Certain), who were both athletes at Livingstone College: his father was a football player, while his mother played basketball. Williams grew up in Chicago, Illinois, and started playing basketball at age 9; when his parents separated, Williams and his mother moved to Wake Forest, North Carolina when he was in eighth grade. Williams enrolled at Wake Forest-Rolesville High school, where he played in the varsity team for 4 years, coached by Chuck Hess. He chose to wear jersey number 31 for the number of rebounds his mother once recorded in a single game, and as a freshman he averaged 10 points, 7 rebounds, 2 assists and 2 steals. As a sophomore in high school he weighted 313 pounds and posted averages of 15 points, 9 rebounds, 4 assists and 2 steals per game.\nWilliams was already being recruited by NCAA Division I colleges in his junior year as a nationally ranked prospect; he averaged 22 points, 15 rebounds, 3 blocks, 5 assists and 3 steals, shooting 85% from the field, and during a game he broke a rim. Wake Forest-Rolesville lost in the sectional final game against Leesville Road High School, the team of 2001 North Carolina Mr. Basketball Anthony Richardson. Before his senior season Williams lost a significant amount of weight, reaching 280 pounds: he recorded averages of 28 points, 14 rebounds, 6 assists, 3 blocks and 3 steals while being named Conference Player of the Year and Wake County Player of the Year, and was an all-state selection. On December 4, 2001, against Northern Durham he shot 18 for 18 from the field, a North Carolina high school basketball record, tying Stuart Davis of Robbinsville who shot 15 for 15 in 1990. He was ranked the 11th center in the nation by ESPN and was in the top-40 of several national rankings. He also finished in 2nd place for the Mr. Basketball award, behind Shavlik Randolph and ahead of Curtis Withers and Chris Paul.\nHis successful senior year earned him a selection as a McDonald's All-American and in the \"Parade\" All-America Third Team. In the 2002 McDonald's game, which was played in New York City, he scored 9 points, shooting 4/10 from the field and 1/4 from the free throw line, recorded 2 assists, 1 steal and 1 block, and he was the top rebounder of the game with 13 rebounds in 14 minutes of play.\nCollege career.\nFreshman season.\nWilliams was recruited since his junior year in high school, and received interest from Wake Forest, Clemson, NC State and North Carolina. He signed for Wake Forest in July 2001, becoming the third recruit signed under newly appointed coach Skip Prosser. He chose a degree in sociology and jersey number 31, the same he wore in high school. His official debut was on November 27, 2002, against Yale, and he recorded 14 points and 4 steals. He scored a then career-high 20 points on March 21, 2003, against East Tennessee State in the NCAA tournament. He started all 31 games he played, the third best result for a freshman in Wake Forest history, but during the season he was often in foul trouble, leading the team in fouls. He also led the team in field goal percentage, and was the fifth best scorer with 8.7 points per game.\nSophomore season.\nFor his sophomore year, coach Prosser increased Williams' minutes, and the center improved his averages to 12.4 points, 5.6 rebounds, 0.6 assists and 0.7 blocks. He started 24 of his 31 games, recorded a career-high 25 points against Indiana on December 2, 2003, and was named the ACC Player of the Week after his 24-point performance against North Carolina on December 20, 2003, when Wake Forest won after a triple-overtime. He still had issues with excessive fouling, but ranked third in the team in scoring behind Justin Gray and Chris Paul, second in blocks, and again led the team in field goal percentage, shooting .546.\nJunior season.\nWilliams started his junior year with an improved physical condition, having lost weight, and reached 271 pounds, a significant drop from his freshman weight of 340. He was also invited by Kelvin Sampson to participate in a training camp with the Under-20 USA national team, but was ultimately unable to join the team due to illness. He started 32 out of 33 games and recorded a new career-high with 29 points against Cincinnati on January 22, 2005, and on February 2 against Duke he broke a Wake Forest record for offensive rebounds in a single game with 11. On January 31 he received another ACC Player of the Week award; he led the entire ACC conference in field goal percentage with .630, which was also good for third place in the entire Division I. The Demon Deacons reached the second round of the NCAA tournament, where they were eliminated by West Virginia despite a 23-points, 12-rebounds performance by Williams. He also managed to improve on fouling, recording less fouls compared to his previous 2 years, and fouled out only twice in the whole season. At the end of the season he was named in the All-ACC second team and was an honorable mention AP All-American.\nSenior season.\nWilliams initially entered his name in the 2005 NBA draft and participated in pre-draft workouts, but withdrew in April without having hired an agent, something that allowed him to come back to Wake Forest for his senior year. In his last season of college basketball Williams was again in the starting five (34 out of 34 games), averaging 32.6 minutes. He made his debut in the first game of the season on November 10, 2005, against Mississippi Valley State and posted 22 points and 9 rebounds. On January 11, 2006, he recorded 22 points and 20 rebounds (career high) against Clemson. His season averages were all career-highs: 16.3 points, 8.9 rebounds, 1 assists, 1.3 steals and 1.1 blocks; he also led the ACC in field goal percentage with .619, and was third in the conference for rebounding average. At the end of the year he was named in the All-ACC third team.\nWhen he ended his career at Wake Forest he ranked 13th for points scored with 1,738, 6th in total rebounds with 858, and his 121 career starts ranked second all-time in Wake Forest history behind only Tim Duncan.\nProfessional career.\nAfter his final year in college, Williams was automatically eligible for the 2006 NBA draft, and during the NBA Draft Combine he was measured at 6 ft 7.25 in without shoes, 6 ft 8.75 with shoes with a 7 ft 4.25 in wingspan and a weight of 285 lbs. He was not drafted by an NBA franchise, but he was drafted by the Yakima SunKings in the 6th round of the 2006 CBA Draft (61st overall). He joined the New Jersey Nets for the 2006 Orlando Summer League, playing in five games (2 starts) averaging 10.2 points and 5.6 rebounds in 17.3 minutes per game during the event. He did not make the Nets roster for the 2006–07 NBA season, and signed for Italian team Pallacanestro Cantù. In his first season in Serie A, he played 37 games, averaging 9.9 points and 5.7 rebounds in 18.9 minutes, shooting .633 from the field. In 2007 he took part in the Las Vegas Summer League with the Phoenix Suns, playing 4 games with averages of 1.8 points and 2.8 rebounds in 9 minutes. In July 2007 he signed for another Italian team, Avellino, where he averaged 12.8 points and 8.1 rebounds in his first season, and 8.0 points and 4.7 rebounds in his second season. In 2008 he won the Italian Basketball Cup, and the following season he participated in the 2008–09 Euroleague, playing all 10 games and posting averages of 9.9 points and 5.1 rebounds.\nIn 2009 he left Avellino for Libertas Pesaro, another team in the Italian top level, and he played one season there averaging a career-best 14.2 points and 8.1 rebounds in 26.7 minutes per game: with Pesaro he took part in the 2009–10 FIBA EuroChallenge, finishing in fourth place. He played 15 games in the competition, posting averages of 11.9 points and 5.7 rebounds. In the summer of 2010 Williams obtained a Bulgarian passport, and became a Bulgarian national in October, after coming back from a training camp with the Portland Trail Blazers. The Bulgarian passport made him an EU citizen, thus making easier for him to sign for European clubs. In 2010 he signed for another Italian team, JuveCaserta, where he played in Serie A and in the 2010–11 Eurocup Basketball. In 2011 he left Italy for Kazakhstan, and joined BC Astana, signing a 1-year contract. Williams had a successful season with Astana, where he won both the national cup and the league title, was named \"best center\" in both competitions, and won the Kazakhstan player of the year award. In 16 games in Kazakhstan he averaged 13.1 points and 6.1 rebounds.\nHe went back to Italy in June 2012, signing for Reyer Venezia but only stayed there for 6 months, being released in the last days of December 2012. He then joined Chinese team Guangzhou Liu Sui, which played in the National Basketball League, and averaged 14.8 points, 7.4 rebounds and 1.1 steals in 9 appearances. He came back to Europe signing for Limoges, a French team, and he played in the LNB Pro A until February 2014 averaging 2.6 points and 2.1 rebounds in limited playing time. He signed for Cantù again in July 2014, and played a total of 35 games with the team, averaging 7.9 points and 4.7 rebounds in 20.8 minutes per game. He also had the chance to compete again at continental level, taking part in the 2014–15 Eurocup.\nHe signed for Steaua București on August 22, 2015, but did not play any official game with the team, and was released on September 6. He then joined Polish team MKS Dąbrowa Górnicza and played the entire 2015–16 season there, posting averages of 10.5 points and 5.1 rebounds per game. In 2016 he moved to Switzerland, signing for the Lugano Tigers. In 2017 he transferred to Uruguayan club Hebraica Macabi to play in the 2017 Liga Sudamericana de Básquetbol. After the experience in South America he went back to Switzerland, this time to the Lions de Genève. In the summer of 2018 he joined Wake the Nation, a team of former Wake Forest University alumni that competes in The Basketball Tournament."

It concluded with RIT defeating Bemidji State 5-1. All Quarterfinals matchups were held at home team venues, while all succeeding games were played in Schenectady, New York.\nQualifying teams.\nBecause neither of the two western conferences held a conference tournament the NCAA had all western schools play collectively in the Western Intercollegiate Hockey Association. At the conclusion of the regular season the top 8 teams, regardless of their conference, were invited to play in the WIHA tournament. Though the tournament was arranged by the NCAA it is not considered as part of the NCAA tournament and is displayed here for reference. As a result of both the MIAC and NCHA beginning conference playoffs the following year the WIHA was dissolved.\nNCAA Qualifiers.\nThe following teams qualified for the tournament. There were no automatic bids, however, conference tournament champions were given preferential consideration. No formal seeding was used while quarterfinal matches were arranged so that the road teams would have the shortest possible travel distances.\nFormat.\nThe tournament featured three rounds of play. In the Quarterfinals, teams played two-game aggregate series to determine which school advanced to the semifinals. Beginning with the semifinals all games became Single-game eliminations. The winning teams in the semifinals advanced to the National Championship Game with the losers playing in a Third Place game. The teams were seeded according to geographic proximity in the quarterfinals so the visiting team would have the shortest feasible distance to travel."

This gives a total of 25 athletes for both the men's and women's competitions.\nJerseys.\nAll athletes wear the same yellow jersey with the leagues sponsorship on it, however there is also space for personal or national sponsors. Each jersey is adorned with the athletes national flag for men on the left shoulder and for women on the side panelling under both arms. Special coloured jerseys are awarded to athletes to distinguish them, and each colour has a specific meaning:\nA jersey of each colour is awarded to the relevant men and women before the start of the next round, except the white jersey which is awarded to all of the athletes under 21.\nThe women's jerseys are currently a more revealing design than that of the men. This continues to draw criticism from female triathlon participants across the sport with regards to objectification of female athletes and safety/health implications of a lack of breast tissue support and skin cancer risk, due to their open back design. Coloured jerseys, for discipline leaders, were discontinued in 2021, along with the introduction of teams, however discipline and team leader boards, along with the overall series title, are still contested.\nPoints.\nDuring every Round each race awards points towards an athlete's Round score then at the end of a Round athletes are ranked based on their total Round points and awarded League points based on placement, the athlete with the most League points at the end of the season is crowned the overall winner. Point distributions for Round and League points are the same using the following spread.\nAny athlete that gets pulled from a race due to a time cut will have Round points removed, if they are pulled in the first stage of a race they lose two points if they are pulled during the second stage they lose one point and if they are pulled in the third stage they are awarded 0 points for that race.\nChampionship Series Races.\nSuper league triathlon was created with the aim of testing athletes abilities in each discipline of a triathlon (swim, bike, run) but not in the usual way. To do this the league consists exclusively of races that do not follow this convention. Each race is designed to test different aspects of an athlete's ability and racing nous. All races are based on short loops; this leads to fast and aggressive styles of racing. This also means that the race can be based in a city, giving easy access for spectators and allowing spectators to repeatedly see athletes pass, while causing minimal inconvenience to the host.\nAt every location a short loop for each race element (swim, bike and run) is set around a central transition area, then each race will use those loops but in different variations depending on the race.\nThe current five race formats are:\nAlso if an athlete is at any point 90 seconds down from first place they are pulled from the event. This is to keep the focus of the race at the front and to avoid athletes getting lapped and interfering with the race due to the short loops used for the course.\nIn all instances the swim is open-water and the cycling will be draft-legal.\n2022 Championship Season.\nTeams.\nThe SLT Teams returned for the 2022 Season, with the new additions of Bahrain Victorious as a sponsor for Team Scorpions and the Fan Team Cheetahs. The Fan Team concept allows fans to pay a subscription and become a 'Fan Team Owner'. Fan Team owners then get the opportunity to vote on key strategic decisions within the Championship Series such as who will take any Short Chutes that the Cheetahs win, or where the Cheetahs will line up on the start pontoon. The Cheetahs are still coached by Annie Emmerson, as well as the Fan Team decisions.\nThe teams for the 2022 season are:\nFan Team Cheetahs, Coached by Annie Emmerson: Sophie Coldwell, Miriam Casillas Garcia, Rachel Klamer, Verena Steinhauser, Jonny Brownlee, Marten Van Riel, Max Stapley, Shachar Sagiv\nTeam SLT Rhinos, Coached by Ronnie Schildknecht: Taylor Spivey, Natalie Van Coevorden, Jeanne Lehair, Hanne De Vet, Vasco Vilaca, Sergio Baxter Cabrera, Joao Silva, Valentin Wernz\nTeam SLT Eagles, Coached by Tim Don: Non Stanford, Sian Rainsley, Sara Roel, Sophia Green, Matthew Hauser, Jamie Riddle, Emil Holm, Dan Dixon\nTeam SLT Sharks, Coached by Michelle Dillon: Beth Potter, Kate Waugh, Nicole Van Der Kaay, Jule Behrens, Hayden Wilde, Tayler Reid, Chase McQueen, Panagiotis Bitados\nBahrain Victorious Scorpions, Coached by Chris McCormack: Cassandre Beaugrand, Georgia Taylor Brown, Cathia Schar, Emma Jeffcoat, Vincent Luis, Tyler Mislawchuk, Kenji Nener, Christopher Perham\n2022 Wildcards and Replacements: Richard Murray (Cheetahs), Ryan Fisher (Scorpions), Alex Yee (Rhinos), Laura Lindermann (Cheetahs/ Rhinos), Cameron Wurf (Scorpions), Jessica Fullagar (Scorpions), Davis Bove (Sharks), Summer Rappaport (Cheetahs/ Eagles), Gina Sereno (Cheetahs) Maxamilion Sperl (Rhinos), Donian Coninx (Eagles), Nathan Lessmann (Scorpions)\nResults.\nMen's results.\nThe winner of each event takes home $20,000, while the Championship Series winners is awarded a further $50,000.

After the success of the test event, another event now also hosting a woman's competition was held on Jersey; this event refined many of the original ideas and allowed for further testing.\nAnnouncement.\nAlthough it had been a somewhat open secret in the triathlon media, on 10 February Super league triathlon was officially announced and its website launched. During the announcement one of the founders Chris McCormack declared it to be the future of triathlon with 25 of the best professional men competing in action-packed, innovative race formats competing for 200,000 US dollars. It was stated that although this was a test event there were already plans to include an equal woman's event as well as age group races and a total prize purse of 1.5 million US dollars. The series was to be broadcast on television locally by Australia's Fox Sports and in Europe by Eurosport the series also stated that the races would be available to stream live on their own website.\nArena Games Triathlon.\nArena Games Triathlon Race Format.\nArena Games Triathlon* is a form of Super League Triathlon that blends real life racing and virtual racing. The swim portions of the race take place in an Olympic standard pool, while the bike and run sections take place on the pool deck or pool's surrounding area, utilizing static bikes and self propelled treadmills. The bike and run sections of the race are then brought to life by use of in-your-face cameras, capturing the athlete's reactions and emotions as the race unfolds, and through utilizing the training platform Zwift. This includes athletes each having their own race avatar (so that spectators can see the athlete's positions, in relation to each other, on the route selected on Zwift) and real time displays of power output and heartrate data.\nAt the Arena Games Triathlon, each swim is 200 m, each bike is 4 km, and each run is 1 km. AGT events are competed over heats and a final. Heats see two stages of swim-bike-run, which determine which athletes proceed to the final. 10 athletes qualify for each event final. The final in competed of a over AGT race format. This means 3 back to back stages of swim, bike, run with minimal rest between each stage. A pursuit style start is adopted for the final stage, and the second stage takes the form reversed triathlon (run, bike, swim).\n\"*Arena Games Triathlon not included as part of the Championship Series. As of 2022 Arena Games Triathlon events will form the Arena Games Triathlon World Championship Series powered by Zwift. Points from the series will also contribute points to the World Triathlon rankings.\"\n2020 season.\nThe Super League Triathlon (SLT) Arena Games was developed as a way of blending virtual and real life racing to create the ultimate spectator experience. The Arena Games debuted in 2020, and provided a way for live professional triathlon to continue, behind closed doors, throughout the global COVID-19 pandemic. The inaugural Arena Games event was held in Rotterdam on 23 August 2020. The Men's event was won by Justus Nieschlag, while Jess Learmonth won the women's race.\n2021 season.\nIn 2021 the SLT Arena Games saw further expansion, with a second event in Rotterdam, held 18 April 2021, and an inaugural Arena Games London event, held 27 March 2021.

Any nation with three individual horse and rider pairs was entered as a team, with team score being the sum of the three individual scores. All three pairs had to finish the event for the team to receive a place, however; this eliminated 10 out of the 14 teams.\nCompetition format.\nThe team and individual eventing competitions used the same scores. Eventing consisted of a dressage test, a cross-country test, and a jumping test respectively.\nThe dressage test was a 12 section test. The maximum time allotted was 13 minutes including deduction points. The maximum score was 400 points, though the results typically listed the difference between the score and that maximum (that is, a score of 250 would be listed as a \"loss of points\" of 150).\nThe 36 km cross-country test had five phases: (1) a 7 km road stretch; (2) a 4 km, 12 obstacle steeplechase; (3) a 15 km road stretch; (4) an 8 km, 35 obstacle cross-country course; and (5) a 2 km road stretch. Points could be lost for refusals or falls at the obstacles in the second a fourth phases, with three refusals at the same obstacle resulting in elimination. Points could also be lost if maximum time limits for each phase were exceeded; however, points could be gained instead if the pair finished the obstacle phases under the allotted time.\nThe jumping test featured 12 obstacles and had a time limit of 155 seconds. Points were lost for faults (including elimination for the third refusal on the course) and for exceeding the time limit."

        "text": "Sion 2026 (; ) was a proposed bid for the 2026 Winter Olympics by the city of Sion and the Swiss Olympic Association. Sion has never previously hosted the Olympics but bid for the Olympics in 1976, 2002 and 2006. The 2026 bid was withdrawn after a local referendum in which 54% of voters rejected it.\nHistory.\nAt first, five Swiss bids were submitted to the Swiss Olympic Association: 'Sion 2026: Swiss Made Winter Games', 'Graubünden and partners 2026', 'Central Switzerland 2026', '2026 - Games for our future' and 'Switzerland 2026'.\nIn October 2017, the Swiss government announced its support for the Sion 2026 bid. The next month, a public vote was scheduled for the 10 June the next year. The bid's preliminary feasibility report predicted that bringing the Olympics to Sion would cost CHF1.86bn and produce direct revenue of CHF1.35bn. The canton of Valais pledged CHF60m and the Swiss government promised to give the bid CHF995m. The Games budget was later reported to actually be CHF2.4bn by radio station RTS.\nIn April 2018, the Swiss Olympic Association confirmed Sion as an 'interested party' in the 2026 Games.\nIn May 2018 it was announced that the Host City Contract would be signed jointly the canton of Valais and the city of Sion.\nPublic vote.\nThe plebiscite held on 10 June 2018 had 216,548 eligible voters and saw a turnout of 62.6%. 71,579 people (or 53.98% of the vote) rejected the bid and 61,019 (or 46.02% of the vote) accepted it. 1,049 ballots were left blank and 1,912 were invalidated.\nOverall, the cities voted more strongly against the bid while the mountain provinces were more accepting. All of the cities in the canton voted to reject the bid with a majority of 55% or more except Visp which had a smaller 'no' vote, at 51%.\nPhilippe Varone, the mayor of Sion said that there was \"no plan B\" after the rejection of the bid at the public vote. The Sion 2026 bid was formally ended during the Dialogue Stage of the IOC selection process, leaving six other bids still in the running: Milan, Italy; Graz, Austria; Stockholm, Sweden; Erzurum, Turkey; Sapporo, Japan and Calgary, Canada. Of these, three cancelled their bids in the Dialogue Stage and the Turkish bid was not invited to join the Candidature Stage, leaving the Italian and Swedish bids as the only willing hosts.\nPrevious bids.\nThe last time Switzerland held an Olympic Games was the 1948 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz. Sion has never previously hosted the Olympics but bid for the Olympics in 1976, 2002 and 2006."

It further describes the results for six non-nominative spots (3 MAG, 3WAG) earned through the FIG Artistic Gymnastics World Cup All-Around series by nations who have qualified a for the team events at those Games.\nRules.\nGymnasts attempting to earn a nominative spot at the 2020 Summer Olympics earn points at the various Artistic Gymnastics World Cups and their top three placements count towards their total. Whoever earns the highest total points at the end of the eight World Cups earns a guaranteed spot at the Olympics. Only one athlete per NOC can earn a spot and the athlete can not have helped their NOC qualify a team spot through the 2018 or 2019 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships.\nGymnasts attempting to earn their nation a non-nominative spot at the 2020 Summer Olympics earn points at the 4 Artistic Gymnastics World Cup All-Around series events. Points earned count towards a national total. The three nations earning the highest total points at the end of the four All-Around World Cups in men's and women's competition earn a fifth individual spot at the Olympics.\nBelow is the table showing how many points a gymnast earns at each competition, depending on their placement.\nNominative places\nNon-nominative places\nAll-Around World Cup series results.\nAs stated in the Olympic Qualification guidelines, a minimum of 3 and maximum of 4 All-Around World Cups must take place for the All-Around World Cup series to remain a valid path for qualification of an additional spot. However, due to the fact that the Stuttgart, Birmingham, and Tokyo World Cups were canceled, the backup qualification allocation was to be executed:\nHowever, in April 2020 the FIG announced that because the IOC has extended the qualification period until 29 June 2021, they will work with the organizing national federations to reschedule the canceled World Cups and proposed an amendment whereby the three best results out of four All-Around World Cups will be taken into consideration for Olympic qualification.\nIn February 2021, after both Stuttgart and Birmingham had once again canceled their respective World Cups, the FIG stated that because less than three World Cups took place, the unused places go to the highest-ranked countries in the team ranking results of the qualifications at the 2019 World Championships. For men's artistic gymnastics this was Russia, China, and Japan. For women's artistic gymnastics this was the US, China, and Russia. In March the Tokyo World Cup was once again canceled as well.\nMen's All-Around World Cup\nWomen's All-Around World Cup\nApparatus World Cup series results.\nOnly the top ten athletes per apparatus are listed below. The top 3 scores per athlete are bolded and the total column is the sum of the top 3 scores.\nEven though the 2020 Baku World Cup was canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic, qualifications were completed before the event was canceled and the FIG ruled that the qualifying results would be used for Olympic qualification point distribution."

        "title": "2017 UST Growling Tigers basketball team",
        "text": "The 2017 UST Growling Tigers men's basketball team represented University of Santo Tomas in the 80th season of the University Athletic Association of the Philippines. The men's basketball tournament for the school year 2017–18 began on September 9, 2017 and the host school for the season was Far Eastern University.\nThe Tigers finished eighth and last at the end of the double round-robin eliminations for the second straight year. The team went on a 17-game losing streak that dated back from Season 79, winning only their last assignment to save themselves from having a winless season.\nThey had a final record of 1 win against 13 losses, the worst for the team in the last 28 years. This is also a new team low in the Final Four era, beating the previous year's record of 3 wins and 11 losses.\nThey had an average losing margin of 13.9 points against a single 3 point win for the entire season.\nLike the previous year, UST suffered three blowout losses, against the FEU Tamaraws by 26 points in the second round, and twice against the De La Salle Green Archers by 29 and 35 points in both rounds of eliminations.\nCameroonian center Steve Akomo recorded the most rebounds made in a game twice when he hauled down 20 boards against the UP Fighting Maroons on October 11 and against the UE Red Warriors on November 12, both in the second round of eliminations. In the game against UE, the Tigers compiled a league-best total of 11 shot blocks, with six coming from Akomo.\nUST also came in first with team averages of 45.9 rebounds and with 4.4 shot blocks per game.\nRoster changes.\nThe Growling Tigers' three starting seniors, Louie Vigil, Jon Sheriff and Kent Lao have already graduated, while Mario Bonleon and Renzo Subido both dropped out of the roster to play in the PBA D-League.\nUST has eight new players in their roster, composed of four transferees and four rookies that includes former UST Tiger Cubs team captain Jorem Soriano, who last played in 2012. He was set to join the seniors team in 2013, but personal and family matters kept him away from basketball. He returned to the team last year and was included in the Tigers' Team B training pool.\nCoaching staff.\nBoy Sablan went into his second year as the head coach of the Growling Tigers after signing a one-year contract extension in June 2017.\nFormer PBA players Gerry Esplana and Bobby Jose replaced Patrick Fran and Rabbi Tomacruz as assistant coaches going into Season 80.\nEsplana, who was a former player of the FEU Tamaraws was the head coach of the Emilio Aguinaldo College Generals from 2011 until 2014, while the former Glowing Goldie Bobby Jose is an aspiring public servant in his hometown of Bocaue, Bulacan. Both of them have children who also play basketball for the varsity teams of their respective schools.\nIneligibility issues.\nSteve Akomo became the subject of an eligibility probe in September 2017. In the days leading to the opening of the Season 80 men's basketball tournament, the UAAP board had insisted that Akomo needed two years for his transfer residency. He had transferred from the University of the Visayas and did his residency last season. They had cited the case of Ben Mbala, the Cameroonian player of La Salle who underwent two years of residency when he transferred from the Southwestern University in 2013. Sablan countered that former Growling Tiger and fellow Cameroonian Karim Abdul only did one year of residency before he was allowed to play for the team in 2011.\nIn spite of the Republic Act 10676, or the Student-Athletes Protection Act of 2015, a law that put an end to the Jerie Pingoy Rule, or the 2013 UAAP rule which required two years of residency for all incoming collegiate athletes who wished to transfer from another UAAP member university, there appears to be another existing rule specifically made for foreign student-athletes. If the foreign student has attended high school in the Philippines for at least one school year, then he only has to do one year of residency. If he studied for two years, he could play already in college. Otherwise, the two-year residency requirement remains.\nWhile the league's Board of Managing Directors had recommended Akomo, together with UP Fighting Maroon Ibrahim Ouattara to be ruled ineligible for the season's upcoming tournament, the UAAP Board of Trustees, the official policy-making body made up of the presidents of all-member schools had a meeting at FEU on September 7, 2017 and arrived at a decision \"in the interest of justice and fairness,\" to allow both foreigners to play with finality.\nInjuries.\nSteve Akoma and Jordan Sta. Ana missed the game against FEU in the second round as Akomo was saddled with the flu, while Sta. Ana had a shoulder injury that he suffered in practice prior to the said match.\nClose calls.\nThe Growling Tigers on numerous occasions had chances to steal wins from their higher-ranked opponents, but either turnovers, poor free throws, or simply, bad breaks almost always did them in. Against the UP Fighting Maroons in the first round, UST lost by a single point, on a game-winning three point shot by Paul Desiderio during the last 5 seconds. This was when the iconic \"Atin 'to, papasok ito\" quote was first mentioned by the Fighting Maroons' captain. They lost again to UP in the second round, with a similar disappointing outcome. UST came to within 2 points with 9 seconds left, but team captain Marvin Lee missed a last-second heave, causing the team to lose for the eighth straight time.\nAgainst the Adamson Falcons in the second round, the Tigers came to within 2 with 14 seconds left in the game, but fouls got the better of them. Fil-American guard Jerrick Ahanmisi converted his free throws for the final score of 70–75.\nIn their only win of the season against UE on their last scheduled game, the Tigers had to rely on perfect free throw shooting by second-year point guard Oli de Guzman to bail them to the final score of 88–85.\nIn their first-round game against Adamson, UST committed 41 turnovers, the most by any team in a single game since 2003, when record-keeping of UAAP statistics first became official.\nLast man standing.\nHaving the reputation as being one of the most passionate sports fans in the country, the UST community's absence in the gallery became more noticeable as the crowd dwindled down to around fifty people that included the school's drummers and cheering squad. This absence was emphasized on October 25 after the Tigers lost their 11th straight game of the season, cameras were focused on a lone UST student at the stands singing their school hymn. This particular report awakened the community as students trooped back to the Araneta Coliseum in support of the team on the last playing game of the season on November 12. The iconic \"Go \"USTe!\"\" chant was once again heard for the first time after three months.\nSchedule and results.\nPreseason tournaments.\nThe Filoil Flying V Preseason games were not aired on television for the first time in the tournament's history after the organizers' partnership with ABS-CBN Sports had ended.\nUAAP games.\nElimination games were played in a double round-robin format and all of UST's games were televised on ABS-CBN Sports and Action and Balls.\nUAAP statistics.\nSource: HumbleBola\nAftermath.\nBoy Sablan tendered his resignation as the team's head coach on November 20, 2017. UST Rector Fr. Herminio Dagohoy announced that the entire coaching staff's tenure was to end on November 30, but they will continue receiving compensations until May of the following year due to existing live contracts. The Tigresses assistant coach Arsenio Dysangco Jr. was tasked to facilitate team practices as the school was finalizing the process for selecting the Growling Tigers' next coach.\nFormer head coach Pido Jarencio once again expressed interest in coming back to lead the team, but there was someone else who was being considered for the position. On January 5, 2018, Aldin Ayo, resigned coach of the De La Salle Green Archers, announced his transfer to UST where he will coach the men's basketball team for the next six years. Ayo's appointment was made formal by Institute of Physical Education and Athletics (IPEA) director Fr. Jannel Abogado on January 11.\nPlayers drafted into the PBA.\nJeepy Faundo was picked 15th overall in the second round of the 2018 PBA draft by the Chito Victolero-led Magnolia Hotshots team on December 16, 2018. Regie Boy Basibas, meanwhile applied for the record 124-strong 2023 PBA draft and ended up as the last pick of the night, with the Bonnie Tan-coached NorthPort Batang Pier team selecting him in the eleventh round for the draft's 79th pick on September 17, 2023."

        "title": "Michigan Baseball Foundation",
        "text": "The Michigan Baseball Foundation (MBF) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization in Midland, Michigan, that refers to itself as a social enterprise. MBF is the current owner and operator of the Dow Diamond – a baseball stadium located in downtown Midland. Profits from the operation of the Dow Diamond are donated to youth groups and to initiatives that seek to improve life in Midland and its surrounding areas.\nHistory.\nMBF began in 2005, when William S. Stavropoulos, then Chairman of the Dow Chemical Company, which is headquartered in Midland, came up with the idea that minor league baseball could help to vitalize the hometown of Dow Chemical. He had observed how the introduction of minor league baseball had rejuvenated several communities in the United States, and he felt it could similarly trigger a renaissance in Midland.\nWith the backing of Dow Chemical he turned to citizens of the town for their support. Ultimately, five additional Midland-based organizations (Dow Corning Corporation, the Charles J. Strosacker Foundation, the Rollin M. Gerstacker Foundation, the Herbert H. and Grace A. Dow Foundation, and the Bill and Linda Stavropoulos Foundation) joined Dow in backing the effort to bring a minor league baseball team to the community. MBF was formed and Stavropoulos was asked to serve as its CEO and Chairman.\nIn the beginning MBF’s founders expected the new organization to serve as the owner of both a future minor league team and a baseball stadium. They envisioned that MBF would function as a social enterprise – a tax free non-profit that invests its earnings in charitable activities.\nIn 2005 MBF hired Tom Dickson, owner of the Lansing Lugnuts minor league team, as a consultant, and through him in September 2005 MBF negotiated the purchase of the Southwest Michigan Devil Rays of nearby Battle Creek, Michigan. As MBF awaited approval of the sale by the Midwest League, it sought to register with the federal Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as a 501(c)(3) non-profit. The IRS was unwilling to grant a professional baseball team a tax-free status. As a result, MBF’s founders created the Michigan Baseball Operation (MBO) – a separate, independent taxable non-profit – and MBO became the owner of the Devil Rays in early 2006, when the purchase of the team was finalized.\nDuring the 2006 baseball season, the Devil Rays continued to play in Battle Creek, while a stadium was being built for them in Midland. At the end of the season the team’s name was changed to the Great Lakes Loons.\nMeanwhile rapid progress was made in constructing a ballpark in Midland. On April 11, 2006, MBF started construction of the stadium on land in downtown Midland that had been donated by Dow Chemical. Dow also paid for the naming rights to the new ballpark, which became known as the Dow Diamond. Construction ended in early 2007, in time so that the Great Lakes Loons could take the field for their first home game on April 13.\nConstruction of the Dow Diamond cost $34 million, more than the average for a minor league stadium. However, the Dow Diamond is fitted out with many attributes and amenities not generally associated with minor league baseball, e.g., a solar panel powered scoreboard, water bottle fill-up stations, a concourse that can be enclosed for events, and free WiFi available everywhere. In 2007 Ballpark Digest recognized the Dow Diamond as the best ballpark of the year. Stadium Journey has consistently given it high ratings.\nCurrent activities.\nToday MBF is earning revenues from the operation of the Dow Diamond as both a baseball stadium and as a venue for many different private events, such as wedding receptions, concerts, and meetings. MBF donates profits from the Dow Diamond to support such youth organizations as a girls softball league, the local 4-H association, and the Midland soccer club. In addition, it provides funding for economic development and community improvement. For example, it is a key supporter of Momentum Midland, a group of projects presently underway that aim to improve Midland’s downtown area. Within the framework of Momentum Midland public recreational facilities are being built along the Tittabawassee River; pedestrian and bike access is being created to downtown Midland, and business activity is being encouraged in the downtown area."

As well as Durrant, 17th seed Stephen Bunting and 25th seed Steve Beaton were also previous champions of the BDO World Darts Championship.\nThe top seeds below Van Gerwen and Cross were two-time Grand Slam of Darts winner Gerwyn Price, 2019 World Championship runner-up Michael Smith, Gary Anderson, 2018 Players Championship Finals winner Daryl Gurney and 2019 German Darts Masters champion Peter Wright. 2019 UK Open champion Nathan Aspinall was the 12th seed.\n2019 Czech Darts Open champion Jamie Hughes, in his first year as a full PDC tour card holder, was the highest-ranked non-seed on the 2019 PDC Pro Tour Order of Merit. As well as Hughes, five other qualifiers from the Pro Tour made their PDC World Championship debuts; Harry Ward, Ritchie Edhouse, Mark McGeeney, Luke Woodhouse and Ryan Meikle.\n2007 PDC world champion Raymond van Barneveld qualified via the Pro Tour in his final year before retirement. Both Van Barneveld and fellow Dutchman Jelle Klaasen were former champions of the BDO World Darts Championship who qualified via the Pro Tour. Other players to qualify through the Pro Tour included 2019 World Grand Prix semi-finalist Chris Dobey, 2019 PDC World Youth Champion Luke Humphries and the 2019 PDC World Cup of Darts finalists from Ireland, William O'Connor and Steve Lennon.\nThe final group of 32 qualifiers was determined by a series of international qualifiers and secondary tours. 2019 Brisbane Darts Masters champion Damon Heta, the first player to win a World Series of Darts event in their own country, topped the Dartplayers Australia rankings, while Keane Barry won the Tom Kirby Memorial Irish Matchplay to qualify, having already qualified to play in the Junior Darts Corporation World Championship final held during the tournament. Barry was the youngest player at the 2020 championships and the third youngest all-time.\nTwo qualifiers were held for female players. The UK &amp; Ireland qualifier was won by Fallon Sherrock, the 2015 BDO Women's World Championship runner-up, while the Rest of the World Qualifier was won by Mikuru Suzuki, the reigning women's champion from the 2019 BDO World Darts Championship. The final three places went to the three winners of a tournament between unqualified Tour Card holders, the winners being Benito van de Pas, Kevin Burness and Matthew Edgar.\nFifteen international qualifiers made their debuts; Danny Baggish, Keane Barry, Matt Campbell, Damon Heta, José Justicia, Robbie King, Nico Kurz, Benjamin Pratnemer, Madars Razma, Ben Robb, Callan Rydz, Fallon Sherrock, Mikuru Suzuki, Ciarán Teehan &amp; Yuki Yamada. Razma was the first Latvian ever to qualify for the PDC World Championship.\nSummary.\nThe top quarter of the draw saw number one seed &amp; reigning champion Michael van Gerwen easily reach the quarter-final, recovering from losing the first set to Jelle Klaasen in the second round to win, before consecutive 4–0 victories over Ricky Evans and former BDO World Champion Stephen Bunting. Lithuanian Darius Labanauskas reached the quarter-final stage for the first time, knocking out seeds including world number 9 Ian White and former BDO Champion Steve Beaton. In the quarter-final, Van Gerwen triumphed over Labanauskas, 5–2, to qualify for the semi-final for the seventh time in eight championships.\nIn the second quarter, fourth seed &amp; 2019 runner-up Michael Smith was eliminated in the second round following a 3–1 defeat to debutant Luke Woodhouse. Reigning UK Open champion Nathan Aspinall reached the quarter-final with wins over Krzysztof Ratajski and two-time World Champion Gary Anderson, while two-time World Youth Champion Dimitri Van den Bergh defeated Woodhouse and two-time World Champion Adrian Lewis to also reach the quarter-final. In that quarter-final, Aspinall won 5–3 to reach his second semi-final in two attempts at the World Championship.\nIn the third quarter, 2018 champion Rob Cross was an early exit, losing to Kim Huybrechts in the second round without winning a set. 2007 champion Raymond van Barneveld was another early faller, crashing out to American Darin Young 3–1 in the first round. Van Barneveld had planned to retire after this tournament, but after sitting out the 2020 season announced his intention to return for 2021. Reigning World Youth Champion Luke Humphries came through a sudden-death leg against Jermaine Wattimena in the second round before defeating Nico Kurz and Huybrechts to reach consecutive quarter-finals. 2014 runner-up Peter Wright survived a match dart at bullseye to win a sudden-death leg against Noel Malicdem in the second round, before beating Seigo Asada and Jeffrey de Zwaan to reach the quarter-finals, where he triumphed 5–3 over Humphries to reach the semi-final for the first time since the 2017 tournament.\nIn the fourth quarter, Fallon Sherrock defeated Ted Evetts in the first round, becoming the first female player to win a match at the World Championships, before following that win with a 3–1 victory over 11th seed Mensur Suljović in the second round. Sherrock's run, which PDC chairman Barry Hearn said could be the \"dawn of a new era\" for darts, was ended in the third round by Chris Dobey. Third seed Gerwyn Price beat John Henderson and Simon Whitlock to reach his first World Championship quarter-final, while three-time reigning BDO World Champion Glen Durrant joined him in the quarter-final on his PDC debut with wins over sixth seed Daryl Gurney and Dobey. In the quarter-final Price dominated Durrant, winning 5–1 to reach his first semi-final.\nThe first of the semi-finals, between Price and Wright, was a bad-tempered affair. Wright won the first set against the darts, tapping his opponent on the arm and making comments to him as they went off for the break. Price levelled the match after the second set and celebrated exuberantly. Each player won two of the next four sets before Wright won three sets in a row to win the match and reach the second world championship final of his career. There was no handshake between the two players after the match, and Price said on Twitter that he had thought Wright's actions after the first set were out of order; later apologizing for his remarks.\nIn the second semi-final, between Van Gerwen and Aspinall, the reigning champion took the first set against the darts, before Aspinall levelled in the second. Van Gerwen broke again in the third set only for Aspinall to win the fourth set in a decider. Aspinall missed a dart to win the fifth set and Van Gerwen took the lead again, before winning the sixth set 3–0 to take a two-set lead in the match. Aspinall won the seventh set, but Van Gerwen took the next two to secure his place in the final against Wright, a repeat of the 2014 PDC World Darts Championship final.\nIn the final, held on New Year's Day 2020, Wright held the first set with a 3–2 win after Van Gerwen missed bullseye for a set-winning 170 checkout. Wright then took a two-set lead with a 3–1 set win, before Van Gerwen broke back in the third set with a 3–0 win, and won the fourth by 3–2. Wright regained the lead in the fifth and then took a 3–0 win in the sixth set to go back to two legs clear. Again, Van Gerwen broke back with a 3–1 in the seventh; but Wright quickly regained the advantage, winning the eight set 3–2. Wright went one away from the win with a 3–2 win in the ninth set. In the tenth set, Wright won the first leg. Van Gerwen missed double-12 for a perfect nine-dart finish in the second leg, but took the leg regardless. Wright won the third leg to throw for the match; and took out double-10 to win the world championship for the first time.\nDraw.\nThe draw took place on 25 November 2019 on Sky Sports News.\nTop averages.\nThis table shows the highest averages achieved by players throughout the tournament.\nRepresentation.\nThis table shows the number of players by country in the 2020 PDC World Championship.

It was noted as the only Black-owned tennis club in New York City and for its role as a community hub, particularly for the Black and gay communities of its district. In the assessment of Patrick Sauer, \"What started out as a Brooklyn hot spot for matches on green Har-Tru clay would become, during its 16-year existence, a focal point for the surrounding, predominantly Black neighborhoods. It was a place where kids could take free lessons, members competed in tournaments, future hip-hop legends spit rhymes, folks marked important occasions, politicians held fund-raisers, and the area's gay community found an unlikely locus.\"\nHistory.\nFounded in 1981 by Richard Northern, the club was located on South Oxford Street between Atlantic Avenue and Fulton Street. Its main building was a 5,000-square-foot neo-Georgian edifice, constructed in 1927 and once home to a funeral parlor, the New York and Brooklyn Casket Company.\nIn addition to the main building, the club had four tennis courts. Richard Northern leased the space from the city on a month-to-month basis, but in 1997 the city closed the club; the club house was demolished in 2001. After a period lying derelict, the land was replaced with South Oxford Park, a park completed in 2006.\nWhile it was in operation, the South Oxford Tennis Club was the only Black-owned tennis club in New York City. The club hosted parties, fund-raisers, fashion shows, and free tennis clinics for children. Events that took place at the South Oxford Tennis Club included a \"Do the Right Thing\"-themed voter registration event featuring a performance by Spike Lee's father, jazz musician Bill Lee; a fundraiser concert for Mutulu Shakur featuring The Notorious B.I.G.; and dances."

A month earlier, the Vandals won decisively at Boise to snap two losing streaks; six to the Broncos and fifteen in conference play.\nThe long-awaited win over Idaho State allowed the Vandals to regain possession of the \"King Spud Trophy,\" an oversized metallic potato with a face and a crown, first played for in 1962. Bengal head coach Lynn Archibald thought it should go to the losing team: \"It's the ugliest thing I've ever seen. The only good thing that happened last week was losing it.\"\nNo Vandals were named to the all-conference team; junior guard Don Newman was on the second team, and junior forward Reed Jaussi was honorable mention."

        "title": "Basketball Africa League",
        "text": "The Basketball Africa League (BAL) is the premier men's basketball league in Africa. Founded in 2019, the organization was established by both the National Basketball Association (NBA) and International Basketball Federation (FIBA).\nEach season typically runs from March to May, and in the current format the league consists of twelve teams. Each of the teams qualify through their performance in their domestic competition, a meritocratic system similar to the format of the UEFA Champions League. Six teams qualify directly, while six others have to play in the Road to BAL. The season exists out of three conferences and uses playoffs to determine the champions. The BAL champions of each season automatically qualify for the FIBA Intercontinental Cup.\nThe first season was held in 2021 and thus far, three champions have won the competion.\nHistory.\nOn 16 February 2019 the National Basketball Association and FIBA announced plans to establish a continental professional basketball league. During a press conference at the 2019 NBA All-Star weekend, NBA commissioner Adam Silver elaborated on plans to establish the league. He stated that the league will feature 12 teams after qualification tournaments in late 2019. The countries that could possibly host a team include; Angola, Egypt, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, South Africa and Tunisia. Silver also hinted at the involvement of former U.S. president Barack Obama in an unspecified role. In May 2019, Amadou Gallo Fall was assigned by the NBA as the first president of the BAL. In September 2019, BAL announced the venues and cities for the inaugural season, which included a Final Four played in Kigali Arena in Kigali, Rwanda.\nOn 15 October 2019, the qualifying tournaments for the inaugural season began, with teams from 32 African countries participating. The start of the BAL was eventually postponed twice due to the disruptive COVID-19 pandemic. The first BAL game was played on 16 May 2021, in the Kigali Arena in Kigali, Rwanda, which hosted the entire tournament. The season was held in a bio-secure bubble with only limited attendance allowed. On 30 May, Zamalek from Egypt won the first-ever BAL championship after beating US Monastir in the inaugural final.\nThe following season, the league expanded it format with five-team conferences (the Sahara and Nile Conference), which were held in Dakar and Cairo. The playoffs were held in Kigali.\nFormat.\nEach BAL season consists of twelve teams. In the regular season, the twelve teams are divided into two conferences (Sahara Conference and Nile Conference), in which they play five games each. The four highest-placed teams of each conference advance to the playoffs, which is a single-elimination tournament which decides the BAL champion.\nQualification.\nLike Europe's Basketball Champions League and association football's CAF Champions League, the BAL has qualifying rounds to determine which teams play in each season. National federations from African countries are given the opportunity to send one representing club, usually the champions of the respective national league. In the Road to BAL, teams play each other in groups for six remaining spots in the BAL regular season. In the first round, all participating teams are divided over groups, with the top teams advancing to the Elite 16. There, another group stage follows before single-game eliminations are played in the semi-finals and finals.\nSix teams from six predetermined countries qualify directly for the regular season, without playing qualifiers, to make for a total of twelve teams.

The West Indies won the series 3–0.\nAhead of the series, Cricket Ireland awarded part-time professional contracts to six of its players.

It would have been the first time that the Zimbabwe women's team will tour Ireland. However, in June 2019, the tour was cancelled 48 hours before it was due to take place, due to a funding issue from Zimbabwe Cricket. Warren Deutrom, the CEO of Cricket Ireland, expressed his disappointment at the late cancellation, but made alternative arrangements for the Ireland women's team ahead of the 2019 ICC Women's World Twenty20 Qualifier tournament.\nThe tour was scheduled to consist of three 50-over matches and three Women's Twenty20 Internationals (WT20Is). The WT20Is would have taken place on the same days and venues as the corresponding men's fixtures. Prior to the cancellation by Zimbabwe, Cricket Ireland had also considered cancelling both of the tours, following poor ticket sales for international matches earlier in the season, but the International Cricket Council (ICC) provided a US $500,000 bailout.\nZimbabwe women were also scheduled to travel to the Netherlands following this series, to play four WT20I against the Netherlands women's cricket team, but that tour was also cancelled for the same reason. In July 2019, the International Cricket Council (ICC) suspended Zimbabwe Cricket, with the team barred from taking part in ICC events.\nSquads.\nAhead of the tour, Kim Garth was ruled out of Ireland's squad due to an injury and was replaced by Hannah Little."

        "title": "Royal Rumble (2021)",
        "text": "The 2021 Royal Rumble was the 34th annual Royal Rumble professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event produced by WWE. It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The event took place on January 31, 2021, from the WWE ThunderDome, hosted at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida. It was the first Royal Rumble event held since the death of Pat Patterson, who created the Royal Rumble match. This is the only Royal Rumble event to not have live fans in attendance due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTraditionally, the Royal Rumble match winner receives a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For the 2021 event, the winners of both the men's and women's matches received a choice of which championship to challenge for at WrestleMania 37. The men could choose to challenge for either Raw's WWE Championship, SmackDown's Universal Championship, or the NXT Championship, while the women had the choice between the Raw Women's Championship, the SmackDown Women's Championship, and the NXT Women's Championship. This was the last Royal Rumble in which three championships were an option for the Royal Rumble winner, as well as the last Royal Rumble in which the NXT Championship and NXT Women's Championship was an eligible option for that winner, as in September 2021, the NXT brand reverted to being WWE's developmental territory.\nSix matches were contested at the event, including one on the Kickoff pre-show. In the main event, WWE Hall of Famer Edge won the men's Royal Rumble match and was later said to be part of Raw, marking his second overall Royal Rumble win after last winning it in 2010, thus becoming the eighth two-time winner, the third wrestler to win it as the number one entrant, the fifth wrestler to win it as one of the two starting wrestlers, and the first wrestler to win it after his induction into the WWE Hall of Fame. The women's Royal Rumble match was won by SmackDown's Bianca Belair. In other prominent matches, Roman Reigns defeated Kevin Owens in a Last Man Standing match to retain SmackDown's Universal Championship and in the opening bout, Drew McIntyre defeated Goldberg to retain Raw's WWE Championship. The event featured returns from The Hurricane, Carlito, Kane, and Christian, who wrestled his final match in WWE before signing with rival promotion All Elite Wrestling (AEW).\nProduction.\nBackground.\nThe Royal Rumble is an annual professional wrestling event produced every January by WWE since 1988. It is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views (PPV), along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, dubbed the \"Big Four\". It is named after the Royal Rumble match, a modified battle royal in which the participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time. The 2021 event was the 34th Royal Rumble and was scheduled to be held on January 31, 2021. It featured wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown brand divisions with a select few NXT wrestlers and WWE veterans also appearing in both the men's and women's Royal Rumble matches. In addition to airing on tradition pay-per-view, the event was available to livestream on the WWE Network.\nThe Royal Rumble match generally features 30 wrestlers. Traditionally, the winner of the match earns a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For 2021, the men and women could choose which world championship to challenge for at WrestleMania 37; the men could choose Raw's WWE Championship, SmackDown's Universal Championship, or the NXT Championship, while the women could choose the Raw Women's Championship, SmackDown Women's Championship, or NXT Women's Championship.\nThe Royal Rumble match was created by WWE Hall of Famer Pat Patterson, and the match was originally tested at a house show in October 1987 before making its televised debut at the inaugural Royal Rumble event in 1988. Patterson died on December 2, 2020, at the age of 79, which made the 2021 event the first Royal Rumble held following his death.\nImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic that began affecting the industry in mid-March 2020, WWE had to present the majority of its programming from a behind closed doors set. Initially, Raw and SmackDown's television shows and PPVs were done at the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, Florida. A limited number of Performance Center trainees and friends and family members of the wrestlers were later utilized to serve as the live audience. In late August, these programs were moved to a bio-secure bubble called the WWE ThunderDome. The select live audience was no longer utilized as the bubble allowed fans to attend the events virtually for free and be seen on the nearly 1,000 LED boards within the arena. Additionally, the ThunderDome utilized various special effects to further enhance wrestlers' entrances, and arena audio was mixed with that of the chants from the virtual fans. After being hosted at Orlando's Amway Center, the ThunderDome was relocated to Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida in December. \nIn November 2020, it was reported that WWE were looking to host the 2021 Royal Rumble at a venue that could have live fans in attendance, as the promotion wanted fans for the event, even if it was just for this one show. However, the ongoing pandemic put a stop to those plans, and while dismantling the ThunderDome to have live fans in attendance at Tropicana Field was possible, WWE decided that the massive undertaking to do so was not worth doing for just one night.\nSeveral wrestlers were also pulled from the event due to COVID-19 concerns. Retribution's Reckoning was originally booked to appear in the Women's Royal Rumble match, however she tested positive for the virus and was replaced by Toni Storm. Keith Lee and Robert Roode were reportedly planned to be in the men's match, but were pulled, as was Jey Uso, who had been advertised for the match.\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised six matches, including one on the Kickoff pre-show, that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Monday Night Raw\" and \"Friday Night SmackDown\".\nOn the January 8 episode of \"SmackDown\", Universal Champion Roman Reigns took issue with the recent booking decisions made by WWE official Adam Pearce, including a gauntlet match that Pearce had scheduled for that night to determine Reigns' challenger for his title at the Royal Rumble. Reigns questioned if Pearce booked himself for the match, to which Pearce responded that would have been a conflict of interest. Later, Reigns' special counsel, Paul Heyman, confronted Pearce backstage and stated that he was able to pull some strings and that Pearce would also be competing in the gauntlet match along with Rey Mysterio, Sami Zayn, Shinsuke Nakamura, King Corbin, and Daniel Bryan. Nakamura survived the gauntlet to face final entrant Pearce; however, before the final round began, Reigns' cousin, Jey Uso, taunted Nakamura, which led to Reigns and Jey attacking both Nakamura and Pearce. Jey placed Pearce on top of Nakamura for the pinfall, thus Pearce won the match. The following week, Heyman confronted Pearce backstage and gave him the match contract to sign. The stipulation for their match was originally a no disqualification match; after Heyman gave the signed contract to Reigns, however Reigns wanted the stipulation changed to a Last Man Standing match. Later in the ring, Pearce and Reigns signed the amended contract, but as Pearce was leaving, he feigned a knee injury, citing that the contract allowed him to choose a replacement for himself in the event of an injury and chose Kevin Owens, who Reigns defeated at in a TLC match thanks to interference from Jey. Owens then made his entrance and signed the contract to become Reigns' opponent for the Universal Championship at the Royal Rumble.\nFollowing Drew McIntyre's successful WWE Championship defense during the special \"Legends Night\" episode of \"Raw\" on January 4, WWE Hall of Famer Goldberg, in his first appearance since WrestleMania 36 in 2020, appeared to confront McIntyre. After Goldberg praised McIntyre's work and abilities, he stated that McIntyre did not have respect, claiming that McIntyre viewed the legends as being \"washed up\" and that McIntyre felt he was better than any of them when they were in their prime. Goldberg then formally challenged McIntyre for the WWE Championship at the Royal Rumble. McIntyre responded that Goldberg was not the man he used to be and that facing him would be like facing his own dad. Goldberg then taunted and shoved McIntyre, who rose to his feet and stared down Goldberg. The following week, McIntyre refuted Goldberg's claim and said that he actually did have respect but that he was going to reject Goldberg's challenge until Goldberg pushed him, prompting him to accept the challenge and make the match official. McIntyre had accepted Goldberg's challenge via satellite as during that same episode, he announced that he had tested positive for COVID-19; following the standard 14-day quarantine procedure, McIntyre was cleared for the Royal Rumble, appearing live on \"Raw\" on the January 25 episode to have a final face-to-face meeting with Goldberg before their match.\nAt TLC, Sasha Banks retained the SmackDown Women's Championship against Carmella. Over the next couple of weeks, Carmella continuously taunted Banks, yearning for a rematch. On the January 15 episode of \"SmackDown\", Banks stated that she would give Carmella a rematch only if she faced Carmella's sommelier, Reginald, in a match first. The intergender match occurred the following week, in which Banks defeated Reginald. Banks kept her promise and a title rematch between Banks and Carmella was scheduled for the Royal Rumble.\nAt TLC, Charlotte Flair and Raw Women's Champion Asuka defeated Nia Jax and Shayna Baszler to win the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship. On January 25, a championship rematch between the two teams was scheduled for the Royal Rumble, and was later scheduled for the Kickoff pre-show.\nEvent.\nPre-show.\nDuring the Royal Rumble Kickoff pre-show, Raw Women's Champion Asuka and Charlotte Flair defended the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship against Nia Jax and Shayna Baszler. During the match, Ric Flair came out with Lacey Evans to distract his daughter—continuing a storyline from \"Raw\". As Charlotte applied the Figure Eight Leglock on Baszler, Evans broke it up. The climax saw Evans perform the Women's Right on Charlotte, after which Jax performed a leg drop on her to regain the titles, thus Jax and Baszler became record-tying two-time champions, both as a team and individually.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe actual pay-per-view opened with Drew McIntyre defending the WWE Championship against Goldberg. Before the match could officially begin, McIntyre performed a Glasgow Kiss and a Spear on Goldberg, taking him out of the ring. But at ringside, Goldberg responded with a throw into a steel steps and a Spear on McIntyre through the barricade. Goldberg returned to the ring and after McIntyre also managed to return to the ring, the match officially began. McIntyre performed a Claymore Kick on Goldberg for a nearfall. As McIntyre attempted a second Claymore Kick, Goldberg dodged it and performed two more Spears for a nearfall. Then, Goldberg performed a Jackhammer on McIntyre for a nearfall. As Goldberg attempted a fourth Spear, McIntyre dodged it and performed a second Claymore Kick for a pinfall, retaining the WWE Championship. Aftermath, Goldberg rose to his feet and endorsed McIntyre with a handshake, declaring that he passed the test. In a mutual respect response, McIntyre and Goldberg embraced.\nNext, Sasha Banks defended the SmackDown Women's Championship against Carmella (accompanied by her sommelier, Reginald). During the match, as Banks threw Carmella out of the ring, Reginald caught Carmella. Banks then performed a head scissors takeover and a Forearm on Reginald. The referee ejected Reginald from ringside. In the end, Banks applied the Bank Statement on Carmella, forcing her to tap, thus retaining the title, to end their feud.\nFollowing the match, Bad Bunny performed his song \"Booker T\" with two-time WWE Hall of Famer Booker T himself making an appearance.\nAfter that, the 30-woman Royal Rumble match was contested. Bayley and the returning Naomi entered the match as the first and second entrants, respectively. Bianca Belair entered third, and due to their ongoing rivalry from \"SmackDown\", Belair immediately attempted to eliminate Bayley, who avoided being eliminated. Instead of participating in the match, Billie Kay (#4) would join the ringside announcers for commentary. Kay attempted to team up with the next three entrants, Shotzi Blackheart (#5), Shayna Baszler (#6), and Toni Storm (#7), to take on the other participants in the match, however they all brushed her off. Kay eventually teamed up with guest entrant and former WWE wrestler Jillian Hall (#8) and Kay officially entered the match, however she eventually turned on Hall and eliminated her. Shortly thereafter, Kay was also eliminated. Midway through the match, Lacey Evans (#18) entered, accompanied by Ric Flair, while wearing his signature robe in an attempt to taunt Charlotte Flair (#15). Immediately after former WWE wrestler Alicia Fox (#21) entered, 24/7 Champion R-Truth ran to the ring. Several other male 24/7 Title challengers appeared and ran after Truth, who then ran into the ring. As Truth fended them off, Fox pinned Truth to win the 24/7 Championship. Mandy Rose (#22) then eliminated Fox, after which Truth pinned Fox outside the ring to regain the title. As Carmella (#24 – accompanied by Reginald) entered, Nikki Cross (#20) attempted to eliminate Carmella, however Reginald caught Carmella, thus saving her from elimination. As Tamina (#25) made her way to the ring, she attacked Reginald, accidentally dropping Carmella, thus causing her elimination inadvertently. Rhea Ripley (#14) then eliminated Alexa Bliss (#27) before Bliss could transform into her alter-ego Fiend-esque persona (due to her alignment with \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt). The final four were Flair, Ripley, Belair, and Natalya, who earned the #30 spot by defeating Tamina the previous day on \"WWE Backstage\". After Natalya was quickly eliminated, Belair and Ripley teamed together and eliminated Flair. In the end, after a back-and-forth battle, Belair eliminated Ripley to win the match and earn herself a women's championship match at WrestleMania 37. Belair also became the second wrestler to win the match as the third entrant, after Ric Flair in 1992. Following the match, an emotional Belair celebrated her win.\nIn the penultimate match, Roman Reigns (accompanied by Paul Heyman) defended the Universal Championship against Kevin Owens in a Last Man Standing match. At the start of the match, Reigns performed a Superman Punch on Owens only for Owens to rise to his feet. Owens countered a Spear from Reigns into a Pop-up Powerbomb, however Reigns rose to his feet at the 4 count. Midway, the two fought at ringside where Reigns viciously attacked Owens with the steel steps. Reigns then threw Owens through an announce table from the LED boards of the ThunderDome arena. Owens and Reigns fought backstage where Reigns drove a golf cart into Owens. Owens then performed a Senton Bomb on Reigns off a forklift through a table. In the end, Owens handcuffed Reigns to a lighting trellis. Unable to get to his feet and avoid losing, Reigns incapacitated the referee by shoving him into the trellis. Heyman then appeared and successfully freed Reigns from the cuffs (after the second referee stopped his count for no reason provided). Reigns then applied the guillotine choke on Owens, incapacitating him and preventing Owens from rising to his feet by the count of 10, thus Reigns retained the title.\nMain event.\nIn the main event, the 30-man Royal Rumble match was contested. Hall of Famer Edge, returning from a triceps tear, and Raw's Randy Orton started the match as the first and second entrants, respectively. The two fought at ringside before the match officially began. They eventually fought into the ring and the match began. Orton, along with SmackDown's Sami Zayn (#3) and Mustafa Ali (#4), began to triple team Edge, however he fought them off and performed a Spear on Orton, who rolled out of the ring under the bottom rope. Edge followed Orton soon after and the two continued to brawl at ringside.\nIn his first appearance since 2010, Carlito made a surprise return at #8, however he was eliminated by Elias (#13). NXT's Damian Priest (#14) then eliminated Elias. It was then shown that medical personnel tended to Orton backstage and Edge returned to the match soon after. Due to Bad Bunny rejecting The Miz's offer in a backstage segment earlier, Miz (#15) proceeded to destroy Bad Bunny's DJ equipment on the stage and then celebrated with his tag team partner, John Morrison (#11). An irate Bad Bunny then came out, distracting Miz and Morrison, who were eliminated by Priest. Bad Bunny then performed a cross body on Miz and Morrison outside the ring. Kane (#18) made a surprise return and after a brief Team Hell No reunion, he chokeslammed Daniel Bryan (#17) but was then eliminated by Priest. Later in the match, Christian (#24) made his surprise return to in-ring action, his first official match since 2014. After entering the ring and reuniting with Edge, the two embraced. Seth Rollins (#29) then made a surprise return from his two-month hiatus, followed by Braun Strowman (#30), who had made an appearance at the end of the previous episode of \"SmackDown\" following a two-month suspension.\nThe final five were Edge, Christian, Rollins, Strowman, and Orton (unbeknownst to the rest at this time as he had not returned from his injury earlier). Rollins convinced Strowman to work together and eliminate Edge and Christian, however Strowman turned on Rollins soon after. As Strowman tried to eliminate Edge, Christian tried to assist Edge to eliminate Strowman. Rollins would eliminate Christian, which helped give leverage to Edge to simultaneously eliminate Strowman. Edge then eliminated Rollins soon after. Immediately following Rollins' elimination, Orton returned to the match and performed an RKO on Edge. Orton then attempted to eliminate Edge, however he countered and eliminated Orton 11 years to the day of his first Rumble match victory, and earning himself a world championship match at WrestleMania 37. Edge became the eighth wrestler to win the Royal Rumble match twice, the third wrestler to win the match as the number one entrant (after Shawn Michaels in 1995 and Chris Benoit in 2004), and the first wrestler to win a Royal Rumble match after being inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. Additionally, this was only the third time that the first and second entrants lasted the entire match and finished as the final two (last occurring in 1995 and 1999).\nAftermath.\nRaw.\nThe following night on \"Raw\", WWE Champion Drew McIntyre opened the show and stated that Goldberg had earned his respect and he had also earned Goldberg's respect. McIntyre was then interrupted by men's Royal Rumble winner Edge. McIntyre complimented Edge, however Edge took issue as he thought that McIntyre would be more aggressive. After Edge teased that he would choose McIntyre as his opponent at WrestleMania 37, McIntyre's friend Sheamus came out, stating that he was not as nice as his friend. McIntyre then asked Edge about his decision and Edge stated he would reveal his choice in due time. After Edge left the ring, Sheamus performed a Brogue Kick on McIntyre, sending a direct message that he was no longer McIntyre's friend and wanted the WWE Championship. The following week, McIntyre was scheduled to defend the WWE Championship in an Elimination Chamber match at Elimination Chamber, also involving Sheamus and four other former WWE Champions, while Edge said he would wait until after that event to make his decision.\nUnsatisfied with Edge's victory in the Royal Rumble and his victory over Edge in \"The Greatest Wrestling Match Ever\" back at Backlash in 2020, Randy Orton challenged Edge to one final match on \"Raw\". In the main event, Edge defeated Orton thanks to a distraction from Alexa Bliss (continuing a storyline between Orton, Bliss, and \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt), putting an end to Edge and Orton's rivalry.\nAlso on the following night's episode of \"Raw\", former WWE Women's Tag Team Champions Asuka and Charlotte Flair participated in a triple threat tag team match to earn an opportunity at a rematch for the titles against new champions Nia Jax and Shayna Baszler, which also involved the teams of Naomi and Lana and Dana Brooke and Mandy Rose. Thanks to another distraction by Ric Flair and Lacey Evans, however, the match was won by Naomi and Lana. The following week, Evans defeated Charlotte by disqualification, again thanks to Ric, to earn a Raw Women's Championship match against Asuka at Elimination Chamber. Women's Royal Rumble winner Bianca Belair also appeared that episode and teased that she would choose the Raw Women's Championship if Asuka retained at Elimination Chamber.\nBad Bunny was a guest on \"Miz TV\". The Miz and John Morrison apologized for their actions at the Royal Rumble, which Bad Bunny accepted; however, Bad Bunny did not apologize for his own actions. Bad Bunny then stated that one of his dreams was to become a WWE wrestler, which Miz claimed he could help him with as a mentor (referencing when he was a mentor to Daniel Bryan in 2010), however Bad Bunny rejected the offer. Bad Bunny then stated the only reason he was there was because his \"friend\" wanted to be on Miz TV, prompting Damian Priest to come out, making his Raw debut. Priest then came out and attacked Miz. A match between Priest and Miz ensued where Priest emerged victorious. Over the next few weeks, Miz and Morrison continued to constantly taunt Bad Bunny. On the March 22 episode of \"Raw\", Miz challenged Bad Bunny to a match at WrestleMania 37. After Miz's match, Bad Bunny attacked Miz and accepted. However, after Miz and Morrison vandalized Bad Bunny's US$3 million Bugatti and attacked Bad Bunny on the April 5 episode, the stipulation of the match was changed as Priest and Bad Bunny challenged Miz and Morrison to a tag team match that Miz and Morrison accepted.\nNXT.\nThe following Wednesday on \"NXT\", men's Royal Rumble winner Edge made a special appearance. He talked about how seeing the passion, drive, and focus on wrestling in NXT helped motivate him to make his comeback. He told NXT Champion Finn Bálor and Bálor's opponent Pete Dunne that he would be watching their match, and regardless of who won, it could influence his decision on which world championship he would challenge for at WrestleMania 37, teasing the possibility that Edge may choose the NXT Championship.\nThe 2021 Royal Rumble was the last Royal Rumble in which three championships were an option for the Royal Rumble winner, as well as the last Royal Rumble in which the NXT Championship and NXT Women's Championship were an option for that winner, as in September 2021, the NXT brand was rebranded as \"NXT 2.0\" and reverted to being WWE's developmental territory.\nSmackDown.\nOn Friday's \"SmackDown\", Universal Champion Roman Reigns opened the show, accompanied by Paul Heyman and Jey Uso. He stated that he kept his word in that he would defeat Kevin Owens. He then turned his attention to men's Royal Rumble winner Edge, assuming that Edge would choose to challenge him at WrestleMania 37. Reigns called out Edge, who had not arrived at the arena yet. Reigns then demanded that Edge reveal his decision before the end of the night. Later that night, Edge came out and questioned himself on who he should challenge, either WWE Champion Drew McIntyre, NXT Champion Finn Bálor, or the Universal Champion, who then came out, accompanied by Heyman and Jey. Reigns then demanded that Edge choose him, however, before Edge could answer, Owens attacked Reigns with a Stunner from behind. At Elimination Chamber on February 21, Edge revealed his choice to challenge Reigns for the Universal Championship at WrestleMania.\nWomen's Royal Rumble match winner Bianca Belair spoke about her win and her championship choices. She was interrupted by Carmella's sommelier, Reginald, who claimed that Belair could not defeat SmackDown Women's Champion Sasha Banks, as she could not beat Carmella either, who then made her entrance and boasted about how she had defeated Banks in the past and that she could also defeat Belair if she chose to face Banks, who then came out and told Carmella that they were done. Banks then complimented Belair, but stated Belair was not the best as she did not have the SmackDown Women's Championship. Reginald interrupted and stated that Belair would be better off choosing to face Raw Women's Champion Asuka as she would lose to Banks, after which Belair attacked Reginald as Banks and Carmella watched on. After weeks of discussing her three options, Belair decided on the February 26 episode of \"SmackDown\" that she would challenge Banks for the SmackDown Women's Championship at WrestleMania."

        "text": "The 2023 Royal Rumble was the 36th annual Royal Rumble professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event produced by WWE. It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The event took place on Saturday, January 28, 2023, at the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas as part of the Alamodome's 30th-anniversary celebration. It was the fourth Royal Rumble event to be held in San Antonio after the 1997, 2007, and 2017 events and the third to take place at the Alamodome, following 1997 and 2017. It was also WWE's first event to be livestreamed on Binge in Australia following the merger of the WWE Network under Binge in the country.\nThe event is based around the Royal Rumble match and the winner traditionally receives a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For the 2023 event, only the women's match winner received a choice of which world championship to challenge for at WrestleMania 39. Due to Raw's WWE Championship and SmackDown's Universal Championship being held and defended together as the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship, the men's winner received a match for the tandem titles, while the women had their choice between the Raw or SmackDown Women's Championship. While the Royal Rumble match is typically the main event of the card, this was the seventh Royal Rumble event in which the match was not the main event, after 1988, 1996, 1997, 1998, 2006, and 2013. It was also the first Royal Rumble event where the eponymous match opened the show.\nFive matches were contested on the card. In the main event, Roman Reigns defeated Kevin Owens to retain the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship. For the Royal Rumble matches, Raw's Rhea Ripley won the women's match, becoming the first woman to win the match from the number one spot as well as setting the record for longest time spent in the women's Rumble at 1:01:08 (which was broken in 2024 by Bayley at 1:03:03), while Raw's Cody Rhodes won the men's in the opening match by last eliminating #1 entrant Gunther, who also set the record for longest time spent in a men's 30-man Rumble at 1:11:40 and the second man to draw #1 and emerge as runner-up. In another prominent match, Bray Wyatt, in his first televised match since WrestleMania 37 in April 2021, defeated LA Knight in a Pitch Black match in a cross-promotion with Mountain Dew. This would also be Wyatt's final televised match as he contracted COVID-19 the following month, which exacerbated a heart issue and he died of a heart attack in August. The event also saw the return of color commentator Pat McAfee, who joined Michael Cole and Corey Graves on commentary, Cody Rhodes, Edge, Beth Phoenix, Asuka, Chelsea Green and Nia Jax made returns, Logan Paul made his first Royal Rumble appearance. Former WWE wrestler Michelle McCool also made an appearance in the women's Royal Rumble match, while WWE Hall of Famer and \"NXT\" commentator Booker T appeared in the men's.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nThe Royal Rumble is an annual gimmick event produced every January by WWE since 1988. It is one of the promotion's five biggest events of the year, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, Survivor Series, and Money in the Bank, referred to as the \"Big Five\". It is named after the Royal Rumble match, a modified battle royal in which the participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time. Announced on September 7, 2022, the 36th Royal Rumble was scheduled to be held on Saturday, January 28, 2023, at the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas as part of the Alamodome's 30th-anniversary celebration. It featured wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. In addition to airing on pay-per-view worldwide, it was available to livestream on Peacock in the United States and the WWE Network in international markets. It was also WWE's first event to air on Binge in Australia after the Australian version of the WWE Network merged under Foxtel's channel Binge on January 23. Tickets went on sale on September 30 with premium hospitality packages also available. The official theme song of the event was \"Sold Out\" by country music singer Hardy, who performed the song live at the Royal Rumble.\nThe Royal Rumble match generally features 30 wrestlers and the winner traditionally earns a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For 2023, just the women's match winner received a choice of which world championship to challenge for at WrestleMania 39. Due to Raw's WWE Championship and SmackDown's Universal Championship being held and defended together as the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship, the men's winner received a match for the tandem titles, while the women had their choice between the Raw Women's Championship or SmackDown Women's Championship.\nStorylines.\nThe event included five matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Monday Night Raw\" and \"Friday Night SmackDown\".\nOn December 26, 2022, WWE's YouTube channel promoted a \"Pitch Black match\" to be held at the Royal Rumble in a cross-promotion with Mountain Dew for the return of the \"Pitch Black\" flavor. On the December 30 episode of \"SmackDown\", following a couple of months of alleged attacks by Bray Wyatt on LA Knight, with Wyatt claiming it was someone named Uncle Howdy, Knight challenged Wyatt to a match at the Royal Rumble, and Wyatt accepted. Howdy then appeared and attacked Wyatt. It was later confirmed that this would be the Pitch Black match. This would also notably be Wyatt's first televised match since WrestleMania 37 in April 2021. During an appearance on the \"WWE After The Bell\" podcast on January 4, 2023, Knight said the only thing he knew about the match was that it would essentially be a street fight \"kind of in the dark\". On the January 6 episode of \"SmackDown\", commentator Michael Cole further stated that the match would be \"anything goes\" and could only be won via pinfall or submission, but nothing else was known.\nAt , Kevin Owens, who had past issues with Roman Reigns, was one of the members of the opposing team in a WarGames match against Reigns' team, The Bloodline. The two previously feuded over the Universal Championship only for Owens to constantly lose due to interference from members of The Bloodline, including their manager Paul Heyman—Owens and Reigns' last title match was at the 2021 Royal Rumble. The Bloodline was victorious at Survivor Series thanks to Sami Zayn—Owens' former best friend—betraying Owens to show his loyalty to The Bloodline. Despite the loss, Owens continued to target The Bloodline over the next few weeks and Owens teamed with a returning John Cena to defeat Reigns and Zayn on the December 30, 2022, episode of \"SmackDown\", where Owens pinned Zayn. The following week, Owens challenged Reigns for the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship at the Royal Rumble, which was made official.\nOn the December 12, 2022, episode of \"Raw\", Alexa Bliss defeated Bayley to become the number one contender for the Raw Women's Championship. After the match, champion Bianca Belair congratulated Bliss and as the two hugged, Bray Wyatt's logo appeared on the TitanTron (due to Bliss' past association with Wyatt) and Bliss positioned Belair for a Sister Abigail but came back to her senses before performing the move. The following week, Belair and Bliss were interviewed backstage, where at the end of the segment, Wyatt's logo again appeared on the screen and Bliss hit Belair over the head with a vase of flowers. During her championship match against Belair on January 2, 2023, episode, Bliss was distracted by people wearing Uncle Howdy masks, and after Wyatt's logo appeared on the TitanTron, Bliss attacked the referee, forcing a disqualification and allowing Belair to retain. After the match, Bliss attacked Belair, performing two DDTs on the steel stairs. On the January 16 episode, Belair challenged Bliss to a championship rematch at the Royal Rumble, and Bliss accepted. The two then brawled with Bliss getting the upper hand after an appearance by Howdy.\nOn the January 16, 2023, episode of \"Raw\", after weeks of footage showing Cody Rhodes' journey to recovery from a torn pec he suffered before Hell in a Cell in June 2022, Rhodes announced that he would be returning from his injury as an entrant in the men's Royal Rumble match.\nEvent.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe pay-per-view opened with the men's Royal Rumble match for a men's world championship match at WrestleMania 39: notably, this was the first time the eponymous match began the event. Gunther and Sheamus began the match. The Miz entered at #3 and tried distracting Sheamus to allow Gunther to eliminate him, however, Sheamus fought off Gunther and Miz. Sheamus chased Miz around the ring, however, Gunther subdued Miz. With the assistance of Johnny Gargano (#5), Sheamus performed 10 Beats of the Bodhran on Miz. Gargano then performed a superkick on Miz, followed by Sheamus performing a Brogue Kick on Miz to eliminate him. Kofi Kingston (#4) and Xavier Woods (#6) double-teamed the other competitors in the match, after which, Woods teased taking on Kingston only to play to the crowd instead. Drew McIntyre (#9) dominated the other competitors and performed a Claymore Kick on Karrion Kross (#7) to eliminate him. After Gunther eliminated Woods, Gunther sent Kingston over the top ring rope and knocked him off onto a commentator chair at ringside, thus Kingston was eliminated. Brock Lesnar entered at #12 and performed German suplexes on McIntyre, Sheamus and Dawkins. Lesnar then eliminated Santos Escobar (#10), Angelo Dawkins (#11), and Chad Gable (#8). As Lesnar and Gunther stared each other down, Bobby Lashley entered at #13, performed a spear on Lesnar, McIntyre and Sheamus, and a powerslam on Gargano and Gunther. Lesnar attempted an F-5 on Lashley, only for Lashley to eliminate him. An enraged Lesnar threw the announce table cover into the ring and threw a tantrum at ringside, after which, he attacked #14 entrant Baron Corbin with an F-5 during Corbin's entrance. Lesnar then tossed a referee over the ring barricade before leaving the ring. As Corbin did not officially enter the match due to getting attacked by Lesnar earlier, #15 entrant Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins threw Corbin into the ring, performed a superkick on Corbin and eliminated him. #16 entrant Otis dominated everyone else. Rey Mysterio was supposed to enter at #17, however, he did not come out due to a presumed attack by his son, Dominik Mysterio, who entered at #18 while wearing Rey's mask. During Dominik's entrance, Sheamus eliminated Otis. Instead of entering the ring, Dominik showboated at ringside while Sheamus tried to taunt him. Dominik eventually entered the match and tried to eliminate Sheamus, however, Sheamus countered. Elias entered at 19th, wielding a guitar, and smashed it over Gunther's back. McIntyre and Sheamus performed a Claymore Kick and Brogue Kick simultaneously on Elias, after which, both eliminated Elias. Finn Bálor entered at #20 and teamed up with his fellow Judgment Day teammate, Dominik, to eliminate Gargano. \"NXT\" commentator and WWE Hall of Famer Booker T entered at #21 as a surprise entrant and attacked Bàlor and Dominik, after which, he performed the Spin-a-roonie to appease the crowd, however, he was quickly eliminated by Gunther. The last member of Judgement Day, Damian Priest, entered at #22, and the stable then proceeded to dominate the other competitors. Priest eliminated Montez Ford, who entered at #23. Edge, in his first appearance since losing to Bálor at the 2022 Extreme Rules, entered #24 and performed Spears on Bálor, Priest and Dominik. Edge eliminated Bálor and Priest. As Edge attempted to eliminate Dominik, Priest and Bálor eliminated Edge from the outside, after which, a brawl ensued between Edge and Bálor &amp; Priest at ringside. The brawl spilled to the entrance aisle, just as Austin Theory entered #25, until Rhea Ripley came out and attacked Edge. Edge's wife, Beth Phoenix, then appeared and performed a Spear on Ripley. Omos entered #26 and dominated the other competitors. Braun Strowman entered at #27 and a brawl ensued between Strowman and Omos, after which, Strowman eliminated Omos. Both McIntyre and Sheamus then performed the 10 Beats of the Bodhran on Strowman, however, Gunther then eliminated both McIntyre and Sheamus. Logan Paul, in his first appearance since Crown Jewel in November 2022, entered at #29, however, he was quickly outnumbered by the other competitors. The last entrant, Cody Rhodes, then entered the match. Rhodes countered Dominik's Three Amigos and performed Cross Rhodes on Dominik before eliminating him from the match. Gunther performed the Last Symphony on Strowman. Ricochet (#28) and Paul leapt off the top rope and collided with each other. Rhodes eliminated Strowman, after which, Ricochet fought Rhodes off, only to be eliminated by Theory. Shortly afterwards, Gunther broke Rey Mysterio's record for the longest time spent in a traditional Royal Rumble match. Rollins performed a Stomp on Theory followed by Rhodes eliminating Theory. The final four were Rhodes, Gunther, Rollins, and Paul. Rhodes and Rollins both performed Pedigrees on Gunther. After Paul eliminated Rollins, Rhodes performed Cross Rhodes on Paul and eliminated him. In the closing moments, after a long battle between Gunther and Rhodes, Rhodes performed Cross Rhodes on Gunther and performed a clothesline on Gunther out of the ring to win the match and earn himself an Undisputed WWE Universal Championship match at WrestleMania 39. After The Undertaker (2007), John Cena (2008), Triple H (2016) and Brock Lesnar (2022), Rhodes became the fifth person to win the match from the #30 position. Additionally, Gunther set a new record for longest time spent in a men's Royal Rumble match at 1:11:40 and the second #1 entrant after \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin in 1999 to emerge as runner-up.\nNext, LA Knight faced Bray Wyatt in the Mountain Dew Pitch Black match. This was an anything goes match done under blacklighting. The blacklighting illuminated body and face paint on Wyatt which presented Wyatt with a demon-like appearance, including red eyes. During the match, Knight leapt off the barricade and performed a splash on Wyatt through the announce table. Wyatt then threw a toolbox into the ring, however, Knight attacked Wyatt. In the end, Knight attacked Wyatt with a kendo stick from the top turnbuckle and then attempted to attack Wyatt again, however, Wyatt performed Sister Abigail on Knight to win the match. After the match, Wyatt put on a demon-esque mask and taunted Knight. Knight escaped and attacked Wyatt with a kendo stick who stalked Knight into the crowd. Wyatt performed the Mandible Claw on Knight atop a raised platform—reminiscent of Wyatt's former Fiend gimmick. Uncle Howdy then appeared and performed an elbow drop off a raised platform onto Knight, which set off a pyro explosion, and the Firefly Fun House characters were seen watching from the raised platform. This was Wyatt's last televised match, as he died on August 24 due to a heart attack, caused by a life-threatening illness.\nAfter that, Bianca Belair defended the Raw Women's Championship against Alexa Bliss. In the end, as Bliss attempted Sister Abigail on Belair, Belair countered and performed a Kiss of Death on Bliss to retain the title. After the match, a video package aired with old clips of Bliss from when she was associated with Bray Wyatt, and Uncle Howdy then asked Bliss if she was truly in control of herself.\nThe penultimate match was the women's Royal Rumble match for a women's championship match at WrestleMania 39. Rhea Ripley (#1) and Liv Morgan (#2) began the match. Emma, in her first Royal Rumble match, entered at #4 and began to target Ripley. Dana Brooke (#3), Emma, and Morgan tried to eliminate Ripley, however, Ripley fought them off. Bayley then entered the match as entrant #6, followed by Hit Row's B-Fab, who entered at #7. B-Fab would then be quickly eliminated by Ripley. NXT Women's Champion Roxanne Perez was a surprise entrant at #8 and dominated the other competitors. Bayley's Damage CTRL teammates, Dakota Kai (#9) and Iyo Sky (#10), entered the match and all three members of Damage CTRL teamed up to eliminate Brooke. Bayley eliminated Emma followed by Damage CTRL eliminating Perez. A returning Natalya entered at #11, and after a brief partnership with her former tag team partner, Shayna Baszler (#5), Natalya turned on Baszler and both started attacking each other. As Natalya and Baszler tried to eliminate each other, Bayley, Kai, and Sky eventually eliminated both. NXT's Zoey Stark entered at #13. Sky shoved Candice LeRae (#12) off a turnbuckle to eliminate her. Becky Lynch entered at #15 and began to target Damage CTRL, however, Bayley threw Lynch through the second rope and Kai and Sky brawled with Lynch at ringside, eventually sending her over the announce table. Tegan Nox entered at #16 and dominated Damage CTRL who reentered the ring as they were not eliminated after brawling with Lynch earlier. Asuka entered at #17 and began to target Bayley. Asuka then eliminated Nox. Tamina entered at #19 and had a stare down with Piper Niven (previously known as Doudrop, and reverting to the name she used in NXT UK), who entered at #18. After Tamina took out Niven, Bayley, Kai and Sky dominated Tamina, however, Lynch returned to the match and targeted Bayley, Kai and Sky. A returning Chelsea Green entered at #20 only for Ripley to eliminate her in five seconds, setting the record for shortest time spent in a women's Royal Rumble. After Lynch eliminated Kai and Sky, Bayley eliminated Lynch, however, Bayley was eliminated by Morgan. A second brawl ensued between Lynch and Damage CTRL, which spilled into the crowd. Zelina Vega entered at #21, donning cosplay in a cross-promotion with \"Street Fighter\" and fought with Xia Li (#14) on the ring apron, eventually eliminating Li. Raquel Rodriguez entered at #22 and dominated the other competitors. Lacey Evans entered at #24, followed by Michelle McCool entering at #25, who was seated in the front row.

Evans applied a Cobra Clutch on Vega before eliminating her. Shotzi, who recovered from a hand injury in December, entered at #28. As Hartwell attempted a springboard, Deville eliminated her. Nikki Cross entered at #29 and dominated the other competitors. Nia Jax, in her first WWE appearance since her release in November 2021, entered at #30. Ripley performed a Riptide on Jax, after which, all the other wrestlers ganged up on Jax and eliminated her. Rodriguez eliminated Evans and Asuka eliminated Deville. Ripley eliminated McCool, and Yim performed Eat Defeat on Shotzi to eliminate her, after which, Ripley threw Yim at Shotzi to eliminate her. After a battle between Rodriguez and Niven, Rodriguez eliminated Niven. As Rodriguez attempted a Texana Bomb on Ripley, Ripley pulled her over the top rope and eliminated her. The final four were Ripley, Morgan, Cross, and Asuka. Morgan quickly eliminated Cross, and in the closing moments, Asuka spat mist on Morgan, which gave Ripley the chance to eliminate Asuka. Morgan performed a Codebreaker on Ripley, who prevented elimination. Ripley then headscissored Morgan to the floor to win the match and earn herself a women's championship match at WrestleMania 39. This win made Ripley the first woman to win the women's Royal Rumble match from the number one position (and the fourth person overall to do so), and saw her spend the longest time in a women's Rumble match at 1:01:08, beating Bianca Belair's previous record of 57 minutes and 10 seconds, until 2024's event, where Bayley would break Rhea's record and last 1:03:03. Additionally, this was only the fourth time that the first and second entrants lasted the entire match and finished as the final two (last occurring in 1995, 1999, and 2021).\nFollowing this, country music singer Hardy performed his song \"Sold Out\".\nMain event.\nIn the main event, Roman Reigns (accompanied by Paul Heyman and Sami Zayn) defended the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship against Kevin Owens. During the match, Owens performed a Frog Splash on Reigns for a nearfall. Reigns performed a powerbomb on Owens for a nearfall. Reigns performed a Superman Punch on Owens for a nearfall. As Reigns attempted a spear on Owens, Owens sent Reigns into the ring post and Owens performed a Senton on Reigns for a nearfall. Reigns performed a Spear on Owens for a nearfall. As Reigns attempted another Spear, Owens countered with an attempted stunner, however, Reigns countered and shoved Owens into the referee, incapacitating him. Owens then performed a pop-up powerbomb on Reigns, however, the referee was unable to count the pin. Reigns then performed a low blow on Owens and then instructed Zayn to retrieve a chair. As Reigns was momentarily distracted by Zayn who hesitated in handing the chair to Reigns, Owens performed a Stunner on Reigns for a nearfall. As Owens went for another pop-up powerbomb, Reigns intercepted Owens with a Superman Punch and a second Spear for a nearfall. At ringside, Zayn distracted Owens imploring him to stay down. Reigns then took advantage and performed a Spear on Owens through the barricade. Reigns then slammed Owens' head against the steel steps twice. In the end, Owens slapped Reigns, who responded with a third Spear on Owens to retain the titles.\nAfter the match, the rest of The Bloodline (Jey Uso, Jimmy Uso, and Solo Sikoa) came out. As Jey attempted to adorn Zayn with the tribal garland, Reigns intervened and the Bloodline then delivered a beatdown to Owens, with The Usos and Sikoa doing the damage while Zayn was watching. Heyman handed two pairs of handcuffs to Reigns and The Usos handcuffed both arms of Owens to the ropes. After The Usos viciously attacked Owens with superkicks, Reigns attempted to strike a fallen Owens with a chair, however, Zayn intervened and told Reigns that Owens had enough, and such a savage attack was beneath someone of Reigns' status. Reigns then handed the chair to Zayn, instructing him to strike Owens to prove his loyalty to The Bloodline. Zayn hesitated, and Reigns then began berating Zayn, pointing out how much Reigns and The Bloodline had done for Zayn in elevating his career. A conflicted Zayn then attacked Reigns with the chair, which prompted the entire Bloodline (except Jey, who had taken a liking to Zayn and was emotionally conflicted by what he just witnessed) to beat down Zayn. Jey left the ring and Zayn was removed from the Bloodline, turning Zayn face for the first time since 2017. Reigns, Jimmy, Sikoa, and Heyman headed up the entrance aisle while Owens and Zayn were laid out in the ring as the event came to an end.\nReception.\nThe 2023 Royal Rumble was a financial success for WWE. The company reported that it was the biggest gate in Royal Rumble history, garnering more than US$7.7 million, more than 50% than the previous record set by the 2017 event. It also had a 52% increase in viewership over the previous record set by the 2022 event. Additionally, the 2023 event broke all-time venue merchandise and sponsorship records, with merchandise sales up 135% over the record set in 2022, and sponsorship revenue was up nearly 200% over 2022. Sponsorships included Mountain Dew for the Pitch Black match and Applebee's for the countdown clock. The final segment featuring The Bloodline, particularly between Roman Reigns and Sami Zayn, generated over 20 million views across all of WWE's social media platforms. Dave Meltzer reported the Mountain Dew sponsorship was for 1 million dollars.\nWWE reported an attendance of 51,338, though a report by \"Wrestlenomics\" said according to a public records request with the City of San Antonio (which operates the Alamodome), the company sold 44,569 tickets for the event, and that the number of tickets scanned and entered was 42,928.\nDave Meltzer gave star ratings for each match of the night. The lowest rated match was Bray Wyatt vs. LA Knight, which received 0.75 stars, the Raw Women's Championship match received 1.5 stars, the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship match and the women's Royal Rumble match both received 3.5 stars, and the men's Royal Rumble match received 4.25 stars, the highest rated match of the night.\nBrent Brookhouse of \"CBS Sports\" gave praise to the main event, giving it a grade of A+, stating that \"there was so much to dig into in that match\". He also stated that the best moment of the aftermath of the match was Jey Uso's walkout, which \"established the pecking order of The Bloodline\", and also called it \"a full circle moment dating back to the group's origins and Jey Uso's feud with Reigns in 2020\". Wade Keller of \"Pro Wrestling Torch\" gave the match 4 stars out of 5, and that the angle was \"phenomenal\" with a \"perfect crowd response\". Brandon LeClair, also from \"Pro Wrestling Torch\", praised Sami Zayn's betrayal of The Bloodline. He said that it was \"unbelievable\" while also stating that it \"certainly leads to that old cliche\". LeClair said that \"the crowd's reaction to Sami delivering the chair shot to Reigns provides any necessary proof that this has been wildly successful\", and \"the crowd was nearly as enthralled by an emotional Jey Uso walking out on his family, seemingly siding with Zayn\". Chris Mueller of \"Bleacher Report\" gave the match itself a grade of B, stating that the match \"was a bit too predictable\", but gave the post-match grade an A+, stating that this \"was what everybody actually came to see\".\nAftermath.\nDuring the 2023 WWE Draft, the Raw Women's Championship and the SmackDown Women's Championship changed brands. They were later renamed WWE Women's Championship and Women's World Championship, respectively.\nRaw.\nMen's Royal Rumble match winner Cody Rhodes opened the following episode of \"Raw\", setting his sights on Roman Reigns and the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship at WrestleMania 39. Afterwards, he was interrupted by The Judgment Day (Damian Priest, Dominik Mysterio, and Finn Bálor). After they mocked Rhodes' Rumble win, Edge appeared and attacked The Judgment Day. A match between Bálor and Rhodes was later scheduled for that episode's main event. During the match, The Judgment Day tried to help Bálor win, but Edge evened the odds, only to be attacked by Rhea Ripley. However, Beth Phoenix took care of Ripley, allowing Rhodes to win the match. The following week, Edge and Phoenix challenged Bálor and Ripley to a mixed tag team match at Elimination Chamber, which Bálor accepted.\nAlso, on \"Raw\", women's Royal Rumble match winner Rhea Ripley announced that she would challenge Charlotte Flair for the SmackDown Women's Championship at WrestleMania 39. This in turn left the Raw Women's Champion without a WrestleMania opponent. As such, WWE official Adam Pearce announced that at Elimination Chamber, there would be an Elimination Chamber match with three wrestlers from Raw and SmackDown each with the winner earning a Raw Women's Championship match at WrestleMania 39. The four Royal Rumble runner ups were automatically added to the match: Asuka and Nikki Cross from Raw and Raquel Rodriguez and Liv Morgan from SmackDown. Asuka won the match to become the number one contender for the title at WrestleMania 39.\nBayley talked about eliminating Becky Lynch in the women's Royal Rumble match, only for Lynch to interrupt. After the two talked about their history, Lynch challenged Bayley to a Steel Cage match for the following week, but Bayley rejected. However, when Lynch brought Dakota Kai, whose ankle was wrapped around a chair, to the stage and threatened to stomp on the chair, Bayley accepted the challenge. During the match, Bayley was about to win after interference from Damage CTRL (Kai and Iyo Sky), but a returning Lita took out Kai and Sky, and helped Lynch defeat Bayley. Two weeks later, Lita and Lynch challenged Kai and Sky for the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship and defeated them on the February 27 episode to win the titles thanks to a returning Trish Stratus taking out Bayley, who tried interfering. The following week, Stratus, who had retired at SummerSlam in 2019, said she was coming out of retirement so that she, Lynch, and Lita could challenge Damage CTRL to a six-woman tag team match at WrestleMania 39, and Damage CTRL accepted.\nOn the February 6 episode of \"Raw\", Brock Lesnar appeared with a match contract and challenged Bobby Lashley to another match at Elimination Chamber. Lashley came out and said he would give him an answer later on after reviewing the contract. Lesnar then attacked Lashley with two F-5s. An official contract signing for a match at Elimination Chamber took place the following week, and after Lashley laid out Lesnar, he signed the contract to make the match official.\nAfter the Royal Rumble, Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins began bad mouthing Logan Paul in interviews, stating that he did not want Paul to be in wrestling. At Elimination Chamber during the titular match, Paul snuck into the chamber and attacked Rollins, costing him the United States Championship. During the February 27 episode of \"Raw\", Rollins called out Paul to meet him face-to-face on the following episode, and Paul accepted. There, Rollins wanted to fight, but Paul said he would not fight for free and hinted that they could fight at WrestleMania 39. WrestleMania host The Miz said he could make the match official, and it was later confirmed.\nSmackDown.\nOn the following episode of \"SmackDown\", Undisputed WWE Universal Champion Roman Reigns (with Paul Heyman) talked about Sami Zayn's contributions to The Bloodline, but thought he saw greed in Zayn. Reigns then stated that Zayn used his island of relevancy. Afterwards, Zayn attacked Reigns from behind, and performed his own Spear on Reigns, only for Reigns to retreat. Zayn then challenged Reigns for the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship, but was attacked by Jimmy Uso and Solo Sikoa (Jey Uso was absent for the episode). Reigns prevented Sikoa from doing further damage to Zayn, and accepted Zayn's challenge, stating that since Zayn hurt his family, he would hurt Zayn in front of his own family in Montreal at Elimination Chamber. After Reigns retained against Zayn, Kevin Owens prevented The Bloodline (except Jey) from doing further damage to Zayn. After more weeks of feuding, including Jey turning on Zayn, Owens saved Zayn from an attack by The Usos on the March 17 episode of \"SmackDown\", and the two embraced. It was then confirmed that Owens and Zayn would face The Usos for the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship at WrestleMania 39.\nWith women's Royal Rumble match winner Rhea Ripley choosing to challenge for the SmackDown Women's Championship, The Judgment Day (Ripley, Damian Priest, Dominik Mysterio, and Finn Bálor) began appearing on \"SmackDown\", thus Dominik began tormenting his dad, Rey, again. After weeks of Rey refusing to attack Dominik, on the March 24 episode of \"SmackDown\", Dominik disrespected his mother and sister, forcing Rey to intervene and hit Dominik. It was then confirmed that Rey and Dominik would face each other at WrestleMania 39. During this time, Ripley and Liv Morgan had a match on the March 3 episode, where Ripley was victorious.\nAfter the Royal Rumble, Bray Wyatt was to begin a WrestleMania program with Bobby Lashley. However, these plans were dropped as he was taken off television in late February due to an undisclosed illness. On August 19, it was reported that the illness was life-threatening, but he was making positive progress towards a return. However, just five days later on August 24, Wyatt unexpectedly died of a heart attack. It was also revealed that the illness was COVID-19, which had exacerbated an existing heart issue. The 2023 Royal Rumble would in turn be his final televised match. His final overall match was at a WWE Live event on February 26, where he defeated LA Knight in a rematch."

        "text": "The 2024 Royal Rumble was a professional wrestling event produced by WWE. It was the 37th annual Royal Rumble event and took place on January 27, 2024, at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida. The event was broadcast via pay-per-view and livestreaming, and featured wrestlers from all three of WWE's brand divisions. It was the third Royal Rumble held in the Tampa Bay area (following the 1995 and 2021 events), and the second at Tropicana Field after 2021; however, as that event was held without an audience via the ThunderDome due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this was the first Royal Rumble at the stadium to have live fans.\nThe event is based around the Royal Rumble match, and the winner traditionally receives a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For the 2024 event, the men's and women's winners received a choice of which championship to challenge for at WrestleMania XL. The men's winner could choose to challenge for either Raw's World Heavyweight Championship or SmackDown's Undisputed WWE Universal Championship, while the women's winner had the choice between Raw's Women's World Championship and SmackDown's WWE Women's Championship. The women's match, which was the opening bout, was won by Bayley from SmackDown, who also broke the record for longest time spent in the women's match, lasting 1:03:03. The men's match, which was the main event of the card, was won by Raw's Cody Rhodes for a second consecutive year. This made Rhodes the first wrestler since \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin (1997 and 1998) to win back-to-back Royal Rumble matches, and fourth overall, after Austin, Shawn Michaels (1995 and 1996), and Hulk Hogan (1990 and 1991).\nIn addition to the two Royal Rumble matches, two other matches were contested on the card, which were for SmackDown championships. In the first, Roman Reigns retained the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship in a fatal four-way match against Randy Orton, LA Knight, and AJ Styles, while Logan Paul defeated Kevin Owens by disqualification to retain the WWE United States Championship.\nThe women's Royal Rumble match notably marked the WWE in-ring debut of Jade Cargill, who signed with the company in September 2023. TNA Knockouts World Champion Jordynne Grace from Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) also made a surprise appearance in the women's Rumble. The event also saw the returns of Naomi, Liv Morgan, Andrade, and Omos in the men's and women's Rumbles, while the men's match was also notable for CM Punk's first WWE televised match since the 2014 Royal Rumble.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nThe Royal Rumble is an annual professional wrestling event produced every January by WWE since 1988. It is one of the promotion's five biggest events of the year, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, Survivor Series, and Money in the Bank, referred to as the \"Big Five\". The concept of the event is based around the Royal Rumble match, a modified battle royal in which the participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time.\nAnnounced on September 13, 2023, the 37th Royal Rumble was scheduled to be held on Saturday, January 27, 2024, at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida and it featured wrestlers from the Raw, SmackDown, and NXT brand divisions. This was the second Royal Rumble to be held at Tropicana Field after the 2021 event, but the first with live fans in attendance as the 2021 event was produced without fans via the WWE ThunderDome due to the COVID-19 pandemic that year. This in turn marked the third Royal Rumble to be held in the Tampa Bay area, but the first with fans in attendance since the 1995 event. In addition to airing on pay-per-view worldwide, it was available to livestream on Peacock in the United States and the WWE Network in most international markets. Tickets went on sale on October 20, 2023, with premium hospitality packages also available.\nThe Royal Rumble match generally features 30 wrestlers and the winner traditionally earns a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For 2024, the men and women could choose which world championship to challenge for at WrestleMania XL; the men could choose Raw's World Heavyweight Championship or SmackDown's Undisputed WWE Universal Championship, while the women had the choice between Raw's Women's World Championship and SmackDown's WWE Women's Championship.\nStorylines.\nThe event included four matches that resulted from scripted storylines. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands, while storylines were played out on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Monday Night Raw\" and \"Friday Night SmackDown\".\nBefore he went on hiatus in May 2022 due to a back injury, Randy Orton had been feuding with The Bloodline (Roman Reigns, Jey Uso, and Jimmy Uso). The following year at Crown Jewel in November 2023, Reigns defeated LA Knight to retain the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship after interference from the Bloodline. On the following episode of \"SmackDown\", Knight stated that he was not done with the Bloodline until he defeated Reigns for the title. Orton then returned at later that same month, and on the December 1 episode of \"SmackDown\", he signed with the SmackDown brand after fending off an attack by the Bloodline (which had since added Solo Sikoa, while Jey had left the group and the SmackDown brand earlier that summer), vowing to get revenge. Two weeks later, the returning AJ Styles helped Knight and Orton fend off the Bloodline before attacking Knight. The following week, Styles explained that he attacked Knight for taking his spot in a tag team match at Fastlane in October 2023. After Orton interrupted and said that he also wanted a title match against Reigns, SmackDown General Manager Nick Aldis announced that Orton, Styles, and Knight would compete in a triple threat match at \"SmackDown\": New Year's Revolution on January 5, 2024, where the winner would face Reigns for the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship at the Royal Rumble. However, the match ended in a no contest after the Bloodline attacked all three competitors. As a result, Aldis announced that Reigns would instead defend his championship in a fatal four-way match against Orton, Knight, and Styles at the Royal Rumble.\nAt Crown Jewel on November 4, 2023, Logan Paul won his first WWE title, the United States Championship. Paul made his first appearance as champion on the December 1 episode of \"SmackDown\" where he announced that his first challenger would be determined by an eight-man tournament. The tournament was won by Kevin Owens at \"SmackDown\": New Year's Revolution on January 5, 2024, thus earning him a match against Paul for the title at the Royal Rumble.\nEvent.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe event opened with the Women's Royal Rumble match. The first two entrants were Natalya from Raw, who continued her streak of being in every Women's Rumble, and Naomi, who returned to WWE after walking out of the company in May 2022 and after performing in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) the preceding few months. She was followed by SmackDown's Bayley at number three. TNA Knockouts World Champion Jordynne Grace entered at number five as a surprise entrant, and briefly reignited her feud with Naomi, who she defeated in Naomi's final TNA match for the title. Past Women's Rumble winners Asuka (2018) and Bianca Belair (2021), both from SmackDown, later entered at numbers seven and 10, respectively. As the ring filled up, Raw's Nia Jax entered at number 19 and went on a run of eliminations. 2019 winner Becky Lynch from Raw entered at number 21. As Raw's Valhalla was making her entrance as the 24th entrant, R-Truth (who was assigned as the 24th entrant for the Men's match) also tried to enter the match, not realizing that this was the Women's Rumble. Jade Cargill was another surprise entrant at number 28, making her WWE in-ring debut, and eliminated Jax and Naomi (who lasted for over an hour). Raw's Liv Morgan was the final entrant, making her return after over six months due to injury, and also continuing her streak of being in every Women's Rumble. Bayley, Cargill, and Morgan were the final three, and after Morgan eliminated Cargill, Bayley then eliminated Morgan to win the Rumble, and in the process set the new Women's Rumble longevity record at 1:03:03. She was also the second woman to win the match from the #3 position after Belair in 2021 and third person overall. In addition to the win this made Bayley the first Mexican-American female wrestler to win the Royal Rumble and the second ethnicity wrestler after Rey Mysterio in 2006 to win the event.\nAfter that, Roman Reigns defended the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship against Randy Orton, AJ Styles, and LA Knight in a fatal four-way match. All three challengers started the match by triple teaming Reigns, then eventually paired off into their own battles. Orton hit his RKO finishing move on all of the other participants and attempted to pin Reigns, before Solo Sikoa attacked Orton on Reigns' behalf. Reigns eventually hit the spear on Styles to score the pinfall, winning the match and retaining his title.\nThe penultimate match saw Logan Paul defend the United States Championship against Kevin Owens. Paul spent much of the match attacking Owens' injured right hand. One of Paul's friends, Jeff Levin tried to give Paul a pair of brass knuckles, but he was ejected by the referee. Austin Theory and Grayson Waller–who had been feuding with Owens as well as forming an alliance with Paul–then came out during this moment with Theory instead giving Paul the brass knuckles. Owens, however, got a hold of them and knocked out Paul, but during the pin, the referee saw the knuckles on Owens' hand, resulting in Owens being disqualified and giving Paul the victory to retain. After the match, Owens powerbombed Paul through the announcers' table.\nMain event.\nThe main event was the Men's Royal Rumble match. It began with Raw's Jey Uso at number one and his brother Jimmy from SmackDown at number two. Andrade, who returned to WWE after leaving the company in March 2021 and then worked for All Elite Wrestling, entered as a surprise participant at number four, as did Carmelo Hayes from NXT, who made his Rumble debut at number five, followed by 2018 Rumble winner Shinsuke Nakamura from Raw at number six. SmackDown's Bobby Lashley (#11) eliminated seventh entrant Karrion Kross also from SmackDown, but Kross' Final Testament stablemates Authors of Pain (Akam and Rezar) stormed the ring, leading to Kross coming back in to eliminate Lashley, resulting in a ringside brawl between the Final Testament, Lashley, and his associates The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford). As the ring filled up, 2023 Rumble winner Cody Rhodes from Raw entered at number 15. NXT's Bron Breakker made his Rumble debut at number 20, and scored several rapid eliminations. Omos was next at number 21, followed by surprise entrant Pat McAfee (#22), who had earlier made a surprise return as a commentator for the event. After coming face to face with the over seven foot tall Omos, McAfee backed away and eliminated himself by climbing over the top rope and returned to commentary. Raw's CM Punk, who returned to WWE at in November 2023, entered at number 27, marking his first WWE televised match since the 2014 Royal Rumble match. 2020 Rumble winner Drew McIntyre entered at number 29 followed by Sami Zayn as the number 30 and final entrant, both from Raw.\nJey was eliminated after a stint of 50 minutes and 50 seconds. The final four were Rhodes, Raw's Gunther (#18), Punk, and McIntyre. After Punk and Rhodes eliminated McIntyre and Gunther, respectively, Punk and Rhodes engaged in a lengthy back and forth exchange of attempted eliminations, before Rhodes finally threw him over the top rope to win the match for a second consecutive year. As a result, Rhodes became the first wrestler since \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin (1997 and 1998) to win back-to-back Rumbles, and fourth overall after Austin, Shawn Michaels (1995 and 1996), and Hulk Hogan (1990 and 1991).\nAftermath.\nRaw.\nDuring the Royal Rumble post-event press conference, Cody Rhodes, who won the men's Royal Rumble as a Raw wrestler, seemingly made his decision of which world championship he would challenge for at WrestleMania XL. He stated that while he respected Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins and his run with the World Heavyweight Championship on Raw, Rhodes said that he needed to finish his story and defeat Roman Reigns for the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship, as he failed to do so at WrestleMania 39 the previous year. However, on the following episode of \"Raw\", Rollins explained why Rhodes should instead challenge him at WrestleMania, stating that the title Reigns held lost its luster due to Reigns defending it so infrequently, and the shady reputations of other past champions, while Rollins made his title representative of the blue collar, workhorse style that Cody's father Dusty Rhodes embodied. A conflicted Rhodes said he would think about it. Rhodes then appeared on \"SmackDown\" and confronted Reigns and said that he would eventually win Reigns' title, but not at WrestleMania. The Rock then came out and stared down Reigns in the ring as the episode went off the air, seemingly challenging for Reigns' title at WrestleMania, which has since drawn intense fan backlash. However, during the \"WrestleMania XL Kickoff\" event on February 8, Rhodes announced that he had in fact chosen Reigns, much to the dismay of Reigns and Rock.\nTwo days after the event, reports emerged that CM Punk had gotten injured during the men's Royal Rumble match. Punk, with his arm in a sling, opened that night's episode of \"Raw\" and confirmed that he tore his right triceps and would have to miss WrestleMania XL. He was interrupted by Drew McIntyre, who Punk had eliminated in the match. McIntyre said he had hoped Punk would get injured so he could instead go to WrestleMania and challenge for a world championship. Punk then said that whenever he comes back, McIntyre would be his first target.\nOn the same episode of \"Raw\", it was announced that Pat McAfee had returned to WWE full-time to be a commentator alongside Michael Cole for the brand, and on the heels of his return at the Royal Rumble, Andrade became a member of the Raw roster.\nSmackDown.\nOn \"WWE The Bump\" the day after the Royal Rumble, Bayley, who won the women's Royal Rumble as a SmackDown wrestler, seemingly confirmed that she would challenge Rhea Ripley for the Women's World Championship at WrestleMania XL due to her Damage CTRL stablemate Iyo Sky holding the WWE Women's Championship. Bayley subsequently appeared on the following episode of \"Raw\" to officially announce her decision, but after being interrupted by Ripley and then Ripley being attacked by Nia Jax, who warned Bayley that Ripley would not make it to WrestleMania, Bayley said she would make her announcement on \"SmackDown\". On that episode, Bayley eavesdropped on Sky and The Kabuki Warriors (Asuka and Kairi Sane) say something in Japanese with Sky saying they would end Bayley that night. Later in the ring, Bayley confronted Sky, Asuka, and Sane, revealing she understood what they were saying and wondered why they made fun of her. The three then attacked Bayley, who decided that she would challenge Sky for the WWE Women's Championship at WrestleMania, turning face.\nOn the same episode of \"SmackDown\", Naomi and Tiffany Stratton—both surprise entrants in the Women's Rumble—announced they had signed with SmackDown full time (Naomi coming in as a free agent after leaving TNA and Stratton from NXT). Two weeks later, Bron Breakker–a surprise Rumble entrant on the men's side–had signed with SmackDown, coming over from NXT."

        "text": "The 2020 SummerSlam was the 33rd annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event produced by WWE. It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The event took place on August 23, 2020, from the WWE ThunderDome, hosted at the Amway Center in Orlando, Florida, and was WWE's first pay-per-view to be broadcast from the ThunderDome bio-secure bubble. It was also the first SummerSlam since 2011 to not feature Brock Lesnar, who competed in the main event match for the past six years and in 2012. Additionally, it was the first SummerSlam since 2009 to feature MVP. \nThe event was originally scheduled to take place at the TD Garden in Boston, Massachusetts, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Boston mayor Marty Walsh announced the suspension of all large-scale gatherings and that no permit would be issued for an event that could draw a large crowd before September 7. Since mid-March, WWE had presented the majority of their shows from the WWE Performance Center in Orlando with no fans in attendance due to the pandemic. With the move to the Amway Center, SummerSlam was the first major WWE event held outside of the Performance Center since March, although still without fans physically in attendance; fans were instead able to attend and be seen virtually on LED boards in the venue through the ThunderDome arena staging.\nEight matches were contested at the event, including one on the Kickoff pre-show. In the main event, which was the main match for SmackDown, \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt defeated Braun Strowman in a Falls Count Anywhere match to win the Universal Championship for a second time. Following the match, Roman Reigns returned following a five-month hiatus and attacked both men, turning heel for the first time since 2014. In the penultimate match, which was the main match for Raw, Drew McIntyre defeated Randy Orton to retain the WWE Championship. In other prominent matches, Mandy Rose defeated Sonya Deville in a No Disqualification Loser Leaves WWE match, and Asuka defeated Sasha Banks to win the Raw Women's Championship for a second time after losing her match against Bayley for the SmackDown Women's Championship in the opening bout. The event was also notable for the in-ring debut of Rey Mysterio's son Dominik Mysterio, who fought Seth Rollins in a street fight in a losing effort.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSummerSlam is an annual professional wrestling event produced every August by WWE since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views (PPV), along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and Survivor Series, referred to as the \"Big Four\". Announced on August 8, 2019, the 2020 event was the 33rd SummerSlam and featured wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. In addition to airing on pay-per-view worldwide, the event was available to livestream on the WWE Network.\nImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, WWE had to present the majority of its programming for Raw and SmackDown from a behind closed doors set at the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, Florida beginning mid-March, although in late May, the promotion began using Performance Center trainees to serve as the live audience, which was further expanded to friends and family members of the wrestlers in mid-June. SummerSlam, as well as the preceding night's NXT TakeOver event, were originally scheduled to take place in Boston, Massachusetts at the TD Garden. On May 8, the ongoing pandemic forced Boston mayor Marty Walsh to suspend all large-scale gatherings until September 7, effectively canceling WWE's planned events in the city.\nWrestling journalist Dave Meltzer reported that the promotion was open to moving SummerSlam to September if it meant having fans in attendance. However, an advertisement that aired during The Horror Show at Extreme Rules confirmed that SummerSlam would still be taking place on August 23, but with no reference to a city or venue. Although \"Pro Wrestling Insider\" had reported that the event would be held at the WWE Performance Center, the promotion put out an official statement on July 23 that the announcement of a new location would be forthcoming. WWE also stated that refunds would be issued at original point of purchase. \"PWInsider\" then reported that WWE were looking into hosting SummerSlam on a cruise ship or on a beach.\nOn August 17, it was made official that SummerSlam would emanate from the Amway Center, a larger venue also located in Orlando. This made SummerSlam the first major WWE event to be held outside of the Performance Center since March. WWE also entered into an agreement with the Amway Center in which all future broadcasts of \"Raw\", \"SmackDown\", and PPVs would be held at the venue \"for the foreseeable future\". Along with the move, WWE partnered with the full-service fan experience company The Famous Group to provide a \"virtual fan experience\", a bio-secure bubble dubbed the WWE ThunderDome, which was first utilized for the August 21 episode of \"SmackDown\". Drones, lasers, pyro, smoke, and projections were utilized to make the wrestlers' entrances \"better than WrestleMania\". according to WWE Executive Vice President of Television Production Kevin Dunn, who further noted that \"We can now do things production-wise that we could never otherwise do\". They also installed nearly 1,000 LED boards in the Amway Center to allow for rows and rows of virtual fans, who could register for a free virtual seat. Arena audio was also mixed with that of the virtual fans so that chants from the fans could be heard.\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised eight matches, including one on the Kickoff pre-show, that resulted from scripted storylines. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Monday Night Raw\" and \"Friday Night SmackDown\".\nAt Money in the Bank, Braun Strowman retained the Universal Championship against Bray Wyatt, who wrestled as his Firefly Fun House character. After being absent for a few weeks, Wyatt returned on the June 19 episode of \"SmackDown\", but was interrupted by Strowman. Wyatt stated their rivalry was just getting started before appearing as his old cult leader persona of The Wyatt Family, which formerly included Strowman and from where Strowman had originally made his WWE debut. This led to a non-title match between the two called the Wyatt Swamp Fight at The Horror Show at Extreme Rules, where Wyatt, fighting as his old Eater of Worlds self, defeated Strowman, who disappeared somewhere in the swamp. As Wyatt tried to leave himself, he was pulled back into the water, only for his alter ego The Fiend to appear. On the following \"SmackDown\", Wyatt stated that his old Eater of Worlds self was done for now and that The Fiend had been unleashed. The following week, Wyatt said that The Fiend wanted the Universal Championship and that no one was safe until he got it, which was made evident later that night when The Fiend attacked Alexa Bliss, Strowman's old tag team partner from Season 1 of \"Mixed Match Challenge\". On the August 7 episode, The Fiend tried attacking Bliss again, who seemingly showed affection for The Fiend, causing him to back off. Strowman then appeared on the TitanTron, stating he did not care about Bliss and that he emerged a monster from the swamp. Strowman then accepted The Fiend's challenge for the Universal Championship at SummerSlam. The following week saw Strowman attacking Bliss to lure out The Fiend, who appeared in the ring to confront Strowman. On the August 22 episode of \"Talking Smack\", the stipulation was changed to a Falls Count Anywhere match.\nOn the July 27 episode of \"Raw\", Randy Orton cut a promo listing many of his accolades before declaring that he wanted the WWE Championship again. He then issued a challenge to champion Drew McIntyre for a title match at SummerSlam. Later that night, McIntyre accepted Orton's challenge and then defeated Dolph Ziggler in an Extreme Rules match in a rematch from The Horror Show at Extreme Rules, preventing Ziggler from earning the title opportunity. Following the match, Orton attacked McIntyre with an RKO.\nOn the July 20 episode of \"Raw\", Andrade and Angel Garza lost to Raw Tag Team Champions The Street Profits (Montez Ford and Angelo Dawkins). The following week, Andrade and Garza won a triple threat tag team match to earn a title match at SummerSlam.\nAfter United States Champion Apollo Crews repeatedly declined MVP's offer to join his faction, later dubbed The Hurt Business, the two faced each other in a non-title match on the June 29 episode of \"Raw\" that was won by MVP. After the match, Crews was brutally attacked by MVP's teammate Bobby Lashley. The following week, MVP unveiled a new United States Championship belt and stated that he would face Crews for the title at The Horror Show at Extreme Rules. At the event, however, Crews was unable to compete due to failing his pre-match physical thanks to Lashley's attack. MVP then declared himself winner by forfeit and unofficially claimed himself as the new United States Champion. Crews, sporting the older United States title belt, returned on the August 3 episode of \"Raw\" where he formally faced MVP in a title match where Crews retained. Celebrating his victory, Crews later stated in a backstage interview that he would give the old belt to his children while he kept the new belt MVP introduced. MVP then demanded a rematch for SummerSlam and Crews accepted. On the August 17 episode, Crews defeated The Hurt Business' Shelton Benjamin, thus banning Benjamin and Lashley from ringside during the title match at SummerSlam, which was set to occur on the Kickoff pre-show.\nFollowing several weeks of Seth Rollins tormenting and taunting Rey Mysterio, the two finally faced each other at The Horror Show at Extreme Rules in an Eye for an Eye match in which one opponent had to extract an eye of the other to win the match, which was won by Rollins. Mysterio's son Dominik appeared on the July 27 episode of \"Raw\" to confront Rollins and his disciple Murphy for Rollins' actions, as well as for Rollins gloating about it. Although Dominik attacked Rollins and Murphy, they eventually overpowered Dominik until Aleister Black came out to Dominik's aid. The brawl, however, resulted in Murphy injuring Black's eye using the corner of the steel steps. The following week, Dominik challenged Rollins to a match at SummerSlam. Later, after Rollins and Murphy taunted commentator Tom Phillips (which led to fellow commentator Samoa Joe defending Phillips), they were both attacked from behind by Dominik with a kendo stick. Rollins then accepted Dominik's challenge. During the contract signing the following week, in which Dominik also signed a contract to officially become a WWE wrestler, Rollins stated that Dominik could use any kind of weapon he wanted. After Rollins defeated Humberto Carrillo, Rollins and Murphy attacked Dominik with kendo sticks. Their SummerSlam match was later made a Street Fight.\nAt The Horror Show at Extreme Rules, the Raw Women's Championship match between Sasha Banks and defending champion Asuka ended in controversy when Asuka inadvertently spat green mist in the referee's face, which led to Bayley removing the referee's shirt and counting the pin for Banks to unofficially win the title. The following night on \"Raw\", WWE Chief Brand Officer Stephanie McMahon stated that neither Banks or Asuka won at Extreme Rules and announced a rematch between the two for the following week in a match where the title could be won by pinfall, submission, disqualification, or count out. During the ensuing match, Bayley attacked Asuka's tag team partner Kairi Sane backstage. Asuka then left the match to check on Sane, resulting in her losing by count-out, thus Banks won the title for a record fifth time. On the August 3 episode, Asuka demanded a rematch for the title, however, Banks stated that she had to defeat Bayley to earn the match at SummerSlam, which Asuka did the following week. On that Friday's \"SmackDown\", as Bayley did not have a challenger for her SmackDown Women's Championship at SummerSlam, Stephanie announced a triple brand battle royal for the following week, featuring wrestlers from Raw, SmackDown, and NXT, with the winner facing Bayley at the event. Surprise entrant Asuka won the battle royal, thus double booking Asuka to face the WWE Women's Tag Team Champions in singles matches for their respective singles titles. On the August 21 episode of \"SmackDown\", both Banks and Bayley faced Naomi in a Beat the Clock Challenge to determine the order of their respective title defenses against Asuka with the loser defending first; Banks subsequently won as she defeated Naomi, who in turn defeated Bayley.\nAt the onset of 2020, a romance began between Mandy Rose and Heavy Machinery's Otis. They were set to have a Valentine's Day date, however, Dolph Ziggler arrived first, stealing the date with Rose. Prior to WrestleMania 36, it was revealed that Rose's Fire and Desire tag team partner Sonya Deville had conspired with Ziggler to sabotage the date by sending a fake text to Otis that Rose was running late. Otis then defeated Ziggler at the event with the help of Rose, who also attacked Deville. Rose then entered into a months long feud with Deville, who claimed that Rose was all looks and no talent. This culminated on the July 31 episode of \"SmackDown\" where Deville attacked Rose backstage and cut some of her hair off. Rose, now sporting shorter hair, then challenged Deville to a Hair vs. Hair match at SummerSlam, which Deville accepted. The following week, Rose had a change of heart, thinking there was still some good in Deville, and asked to put their rivalry behind them. Deville instead raised the stakes and changed the stipulation of their match to a no disqualification match where the loser leaves WWE. This stipulation change was brought about due to a real life incident involving Deville; her home had been broken into by a stalker in Florida. Her lawyers cited it was not a good idea to have a shaved head while in court.\nEvent.\nPre-show.\nDuring the SummerSlam Kickoff pre-show, Apollo Crews defended the United States Championship against MVP with MVP's stablemates Bobby Lashley and Shelton Benjamin banned from ringside. In the end, Crews performed a \"Toss Powerbomb\" on MVP to retain the title. Following the match, Benjamin and Lashley came down to the ring to attack Crews, however, Crews escaped.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe actual pay-per-view opened with Bayley (accompanied by Sasha Banks) defending the SmackDown Women's Championship against Asuka. In the end, Asuka attempted to attack Bayley, who was teetering on the ring ropes, however, Bayley moved out of the way and Asuka inadvertently knocked off Banks, who had been standing on the ring apron to try and distract Asuka. Bayley then performed a roll-up on Asuka to retain the title. Following the match, Bayley and Banks attacked Asuka.\nNext, The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford) defended the Raw Tag Team Championship against Andrade and Angel Garza (accompanied by Zelina Vega). The climax saw Vega stand on the ring apron to distract the referee. Garza performed a \"Superkick\" on Dawkins, who bumped into Vega knocking her off the ring apron. Dawkins then performed a \"Powerbomb\" on Garza and Ford performed \"From the Heavens\" on Garza to retain the titles.\nAfter that, Mandy Rose faced Sonya Deville in a no disqualification match where the loser would leave WWE. During the first half of the match, Rose and Deville fought at ringside, where Rose performed a flying \"Lariat\" on Deville off the announce table. Deville attacked Rose with a chair and slammed her head on the announce table. Rose performed three \"Running Knees\", a \"Fairytale Ending\", and a fourth \"Running Knee\" on Deville to win the match. Following the match, Otis came out to celebrate with Rose where Rose performed her own rendition of \"The Caterpillar\", Otis's finisher.\nIn the next match, Seth Rollins (accompanied by Murphy) fought Dominik Mysterio (accompanied by his father, Rey Mysterio) in a Street Fight. This was Dominik's first match as a WWE wrestler. Dominik performed a \"Russian Legsweep\" on Rollins from the top turnbuckle onto table below. Later on, Rey Mysterio tried to interfere but Dominik told him not to do so. Later on, Rollins handcuffed Rey to the second rope. In the end, Rollins performed \"The Stomp\" on Dominik in front of Rey to win the match. \nNext, Sasha Banks (accompanied by Bayley) defended the Raw Women's Championship against Asuka. During the match, Banks performed a \"Powerbomb\" from the ring apron on Asuka. Asuka applied an \"Ankle Lock\" on Banks, who rolled through. Asuka countered a \"Superplex\" attempt into a \"DDT\" on Banks for a nearfall. Asuka performed a \"Missile Dropkick\" from the top rope on Banks for a nearfall. Banks attempted a \"Frog Splash\", but Asuka moved out of the way. Asuka then applied the \"Asuka Lock\" on Banks, who countered into a pinning combination for a nearfall, after which, Banks applied the \"Bank Statement\". As Banks brought Asuka to the middle of the ring, Asuka countered into the \"Asuka Lock\", but Banks escaped. The end saw a similar situation from the event's SmackDown Women's Championship match occur, with the roles of Banks and Bayley switched, however, Bayley moved out of the way. Asuka then attacked Bayley, but as Banks attempted the \"Bank Statement\", Asuka reversed into the \"Asuka Lock\" to force Banks to submit, thus winning the title for a second time.\nIn the penultimate match, Drew McIntyre defended the WWE Championship against Randy Orton. In the climax, after a back-and-forth contest, Orton attempted a \"Punt Kick\" on McIntyre, however, McIntyre countered with a powerbomb. As McIntyre attempted a \"Claymore Kick\" on Orton, Orton avoided it, however, McIntyre performed a backslide pin on Orton to retain the title.\nMain event.\nIn the main event, Braun Strowman defended the Universal Championship against \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt in a Falls Count Anywhere match. During the match, the two fought up the entrance ramp and inside the gorilla position. In the closing moments, Strowman used a box cutter to cut the top ring canvas to expose the wooden flooring. The Fiend countered an attack from Strowman and performed a \"Uranage\" and two consecutive \"Sister Abigails\" on Strowman onto the exposed wood to regain the title for a second time. After the match, a returning Roman Reigns (in his first appearance in five months) appeared and performed a \"Spear\" on The Fiend.

Later, McIntyre attacked Orton during Orton's match against the debuting Keith Lee and the brawl ended with Orton delivering a third \"Punt\" to McIntyre, taking him out for the next couple of weeks. On the August 31 episode, Orton earned himself another title opportunity against McIntyre for the WWE Championship at Clash of Champions.\nSasha Banks challenged Asuka to a rematch for the Raw Women's Championship, but as a lumberjack match. However, Banks was unsuccessful in regaining the title, thus ending their feud.

        "text": "The 2021 SummerSlam was the 34th annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event produced by WWE. It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The event took place on Saturday, August 21, 2021, at Allegiant Stadium in the Las Vegas suburb of Paradise, Nevada, and was the first SummerSlam to livestream on Peacock. It was not the first SummerSlam to take place on a Saturday, but it was the first to air live on a Saturday, as well as the first SummerSlam to take place in a stadium since the 1992 event. It was also WWE's first event to air in theaters in the United States in addition to the other broadcast outlets.\nDue to April's WrestleMania 37 having to be held at a reduced capacity because of the COVID-19 pandemic, SummerSlam was promoted as WWE's \"biggest event of 2021\". The event had an attendance of 51,326, marking the third-largest crowd in the event's history and the second highest-grossing SummerSlam event of all time. This would also be the final SummerSlam to have creative involvement of Vince McMahon, who created SummerSlam in 1988.\nEleven matches were contested at the event, including one on the Kickoff pre-show. In the main event, Roman Reigns defeated John Cena to retain SmackDown's Universal Championship. In other prominent matches, Bobby Lashley defeated Goldberg to retain Raw's WWE Championship, Edge defeated Seth Rollins, Charlotte Flair defeated defending champion Nikki A.S.H. and Rhea Ripley in a triple threat match to win her record sixth Raw Women's Championship, Damian Priest defeated Sheamus to win Raw's United States Championship, and in the opening bout, RK-Bro (Randy Orton and Riddle) defeated AJ Styles and Omos to win the Raw Tag Team Championship.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSummerSlam is an annual professional wrestling event produced every August by WWE since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views (PPV), along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, referred to as the \"Big Four\". It has since become considered WWE's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. The 2021 event was the 34th SummerSlam and featured wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. WWE planned for SummerSlam 2021 to be more grandiose than April's WrestleMania 37 event, mostly because the latter had to be held at a reduced venue capacity due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the company going as far as to promote SummerSlam as their \"biggest event of 2021\".\nOn May 28, 2021, WWE announced that SummerSlam would take place live on Saturday, August 21, marking the first SummerSlam to be held on a Saturday since the 1992 event (which was pre-taped on a Saturday and aired on tape delay on a Monday), as well as the first SummerSlam to not be held on a Sunday since the 1994 event, which took place on a Monday. During the 2021 Belmont Stakes' pre-race show on June 5, the Allegiant Stadium in the Las Vegas district of Paradise, Nevada was confirmed as the host venue for SummerSlam. While WWE typically hosts pay-per-views on a Sunday night, the \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\" reported that it was the Allegiant Stadium that wanted SummerSlam held on a Saturday. This marked the second SummerSlam to be held in a football stadium, with the foremost being the 1992 event at Wembley Stadium in Wembley, London, England, but the first to be held in a National Football League stadium in the United States. Travel packages became available on June 11 while individual tickets went on sale on June 18. In addition to airing on pay-per-view worldwide and the WWE Network in international markets, it was the first SummerSlam to livestream on Peacock in the United States after the American version of the WWE Network merged under Peacock in March. SummerSlam also aired in movie theaters across the United States, thus marking WWE's first pay-per-view event to air in theaters in the country.\nAs part of SummerSlam Week, WWE held a multi-day tryout in the Las Vegas area to sign new wrestlers to developmental contracts. Additionally, following John Cena's return to WWE at the previous PPV, Money in the Bank, the company began a tour titled the \"Summer of Cena.\" The tour had Cena appearing on \"Raw\", \"SmackDown\", and at WWE Live events in the weeks leading up to and including SummerSlam. WWE also partnered with TikTok to host a contest to select one guest ring announcer for SummerSlam. Music producer and disc jockey Valentino Khan opened the event with a musical performance. Following the event, actress, comedian, and author Tiffany Haddish hosted the official SummerSlam afterparty; additionally, WWE made a donation in support of her foster care charity, the She Ready Foundation.\nSummerSlam was held on the same night as the Manny Pacquiao vs. Yordenis Ugás boxing match, which took place at the nearby T-Mobile Arena. WWE planned for SummerSlam to end before the card's main event, so that those attending in-person would have enough time to travel from Allegiant Stadium to T-Mobile Arena in time for the fight, and to avoid counterprogramming for PPV watchers who ordered both shows. SummerSlam ended just as Pacquiao made his entrance.\nCOVID-19 mask mandate.\nWith COVID-19 cases declining due to vaccinations in the United States and most establishments lifting pandemic protocols, WWE resumed live touring in mid-July, running shows at full venue capacity. Shortly after, however, COVID-19 cases began rising again due to the emergence of the Delta variant of the virus. On July 27, Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak ordered an indoor mask mandate for counties in \"high\" or \"substantial\" transmission levels, as deemed by new mask guidance from the CDC, effective July 30. On August 4, Allegiant Stadium and Ticketmaster released official statements that masks would be required for all attendees (ages 2+), regardless of vaccination status, for the event.\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised eleven matches, including one on the Kickoff pre-show, that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Monday Night Raw\" and \"Friday Night SmackDown\".\nFollowing Roman Reigns' successful defense of the Universal Championship at Money in the Bank, he declared that everyone could now acknowledge him. John Cena then made a surprise return to WWE, marking his first appearance with the company since WrestleMania 36 in April 2020, where he had a brief stare down with Reigns before performing his signature \"You Can't See Me\" taunt at Reigns. Instead of waiting until \"SmackDown\", Cena appeared on \"Raw\" the next night to explain himself, declaring that he wanted to put Reigns in his place. He then officially challenged Reigns for the Universal Championship at SummerSlam. On \"SmackDown\", Cena appeared to confront Reigns, however, Reigns rejected the challenge and instead accepted a challenge from Finn Bálor, who himself had returned to SmackDown the previous week. During the contract signing the following week, Reigns signed the contract first, however, as Bálor attempted his signature, he was attacked by Baron Corbin, who instead tried to sign it. Cena then came out, attacked Corbin, and signed the contract himself, thus booking Reigns to defend the Universal Championship against Cena at SummerSlam. After getting into a heated promo on the \"SmackDown\" the night before SummerSlam, Reigns said he would leave WWE if he could not defeat Cena.\nAt Money in the Bank, Nikki A.S.H. won the women's Money in the Bank ladder match, earning a contract for a women's championship match of her choice at anytime of her choosing, while later that night, Charlotte Flair defeated Rhea Ripley to win the Raw Women's Championship. The following night on \"Raw\", Flair defended the title against Ripley in a rematch; however, Flair was disqualified after striking Ripley with the title belt, thus Ripley won the match but not the championship. Ripley and Flair then brawled and Ripley performed the Riptide on Flair at ringside. Nikki then ran out and cashed in her Money in the Bank contract on Flair to win the Raw Women's Championship. The following week, Flair and Ripley staked their claims to challenge Nikki for the title at SummerSlam. WWE officials Adam Pearce and Sonya Deville resolved the matter by scheduling Nikki to defend the championship against Flair and Ripley in a triple threat match at the event.\nOn the July 19 episode of \"Raw\", after Bobby Lashley's successful WWE Championship defense, Lashley and his manager MVP were confronted by WWE Hall of Famer Goldberg, appearing for the first time since the Royal Rumble in January. Goldberg proclaimed that he would be Lashley's next challenger for the title. The following week, however, Lashley rejected Goldberg's challenge. On the August 2 episode, Goldberg appeared and confronted the champion face-to-face, stating that he would defeat Lashley for the title. The match was subsequently confirmed for SummerSlam.\nAfter Edge was granted a Universal Championship match at Money in the Bank, Seth Rollins took issue with this decision, feeling that he deserved the opportunity. At the event, Rollins cost Edge the championship and following the match, the two brawled into the crowd. On the following episode of \"SmackDown\", Edge called out Rollins and stated that their issues dated back to December 2014 when Rollins had attempted to injure Edge's surgically repaired neck and definitively put an end to his career. Rollins then came out and claimed he despised older wrestlers like Edge and John Cena for coming back and taking opportunities from the current wrestlers who earned them. A brawl then ensued. The following week, Rollins attacked Edge during his entrance and declared that if he could not be Universal Champion, then neither could Edge. On the August 6 episode, Edge challenged Rollins to a match at SummerSlam, which Rollins accepted.\nOn the July 5 episode of \"Raw\", Drew McIntyre faced and defeated his old 3MB stablemate Jinder Mahal (accompanied by Shanky and Veer) after Mahal felt that McIntyre had cost him an opportunity to compete in the men's Money in the Bank ladder match. Following the match, Mahal, Shanky, and Veer attacked McIntyre and stole McIntyre's family sword that he uses for his entrance theatrics. The following week, Mahal, Shanky, and Veer dismantled the sword only for McIntyre to reveal that it was a replica. McIntyre then proceeded to dismantle Mahal's motorcycle. At Money in the Bank, Mahal, Shanky, and Veer cost McIntyre the men's Money in the Bank ladder match. On the following night's episode of \"Raw\", Mahal, Shanky, and Veer gloated about costing McIntyre the match only for McIntyre to attack all three with a steel chair. McIntyre would then defeat Shanky and Veer in matches over the next couple of weeks. On August 13, a match between McIntyre and Mahal was scheduled for SummerSlam. On the August 16 episode of \"Raw\", McIntyre defeated Shanky and Veer in a handicap match, thus banning the two from ringside at SummerSlam.\nOn Night 1 of WrestleMania 37, Bianca Belair defeated Sasha Banks to win the SmackDown Women's Championship. On the July 30 episode of \"SmackDown\", both Carmella and Zelina Vega staked their claims to challenge Belair for the title. The two then attacked Belair, who was saved by Banks, making her first appearance since the \"SmackDown\" after WrestleMania. Banks and Belair then teamed up and defeated Carmella and Vega in a tag team match. Following the match, however, Banks ambushed Belair from behind, thereby turning heel in the process. The subsequent week, Banks challenged Belair to a match for the title at SummerSlam, which Belair accepted.\nOn the Money in the Bank Kickoff pre-show, The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) defeated The Mysterios (Rey Mysterio and Dominik Mysterio) to win the SmackDown Tag Team Championship. On the following \"SmackDown\", Jimmy defeated Dominik with the same pinning combination that won The Usos the titles. The following week, Rey defeated Jimmy with the same pinning combination. On August 5, a championship rematch between the two teams was scheduled for SummerSlam.\nOn the April 19 episode of \"Raw\", Riddle interrupted an interview by Randy Orton backstage and suggested they form a team named RK-Bro. This led to a match between the two, which Riddle won. The following week, Orton and Riddle teamed up for the first time to win their match. In June, Orton would be out of action due to an injury, and Riddle would take his place in the triple threat match to qualify for Raw's final spot in the men's Money in the Bank match, also involving Raw Tag Team Champion AJ Styles, which Riddle lost after Styles' tag team partner, Omos, pulled Styles out of the ring. On the August 2 episode, Riddle would lose to Omos. The following week, Orton made his return, but was interrupted by Riddle, who suggested that they reform RK-Bro before both were interrupted by Styles and Omos. This led to a match between Orton and Styles for that episode's main event, which Orton won. Afterwards, Orton hugged Riddle before performing an RKO on him. On the August 16 episode, Riddle again suggested to reform RK-Bro before being interrupted by Styles and Omos. This led to a match between Styles and Riddle, which Styles won. Later that night, Orton defeated Omos via disqualification after interference from Styles. After the match, Riddle appeared and took out Styles and Omos, after which, Orton told Riddle that he had finally earned his respect, and Riddle announced that he and Orton had reunited as RK-Bro and would face Styles and Omos for the Raw Tag Team Championship at SummerSlam.\nOn the July 26 episode of \"Raw\", before Damian Priest defeated United States Champion Sheamus in a non-title match, Priest stated that he would be setting his sights on the title. The following week, after Priest won his match, Sheamus attacked Priest from behind before Ricochet made the save. This led to a tag team match where Priest won for his team. On the August 9 episode, after Sheamus retained against Ricochet in an open challenge, Sheamus avoided a sneak attack from Priest. After Priest won his match, Priest challenged Sheamus for the United States Championship at SummerSlam, which Sheamus accepted.\nOn the \"Raw\" after WrestleMania 37, Alexa Bliss unveiled a demonic looking doll named Lilly. Over the coming months, the doll helped Bliss' enemies lose their matches. In July, Eva Marie and Doudrop were intertwined in the feud. On the July 26 episode of \"Raw\", Marie and Doudrop lost their match after Bliss showed a \"Lillylution\" video. The following week, Marie and Doudrop attacked Bliss in the latter's playground before Lilly stood up on her own. On the August 9 episode, Bliss defeated Doudrop after Lilly winked at Doudrop. The following week, a match between Bliss and Marie was scheduled for SummerSlam.\nEvent.\nPre-show.\nDuring the SummerSlam Kickoff pre-show, a match between Big E and Baron Corbin was scheduled. In the end, as Corbin tried to leave the match with Big E's Money in the Bank briefcase, Big E tackled Corbin into the barricade. Big E performed the Big Ending on Corbin to win the match and regain possession of his Money in the Bank contract.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe actual pay-per-view opened with AJ Styles and Omos defending the Raw Tag Team Championship against RK-Bro (Randy Orton and Riddle). During the match, after Omos dominated Riddle, Styles performed an assisted Tornado DDT on Riddle for a nearfall. Later, Orton tagged in and dominated Styles and Omos. Orton performed a draping DDT on Styles and went for an RKO, but Omos pulled him out of the ring. Riddle then shoved Omos into the ring post, only for Styles to perform a reverse DDT on Riddle. In the end, Orton attempted an RKO, but Styles countered into a roll-up for a nearfall. Moments later, Orton performed an RKO on Styles to win the titles.\nNext, Alexa Bliss took on Eva Marie (accompanied by Doudrop). Before the match began, Bliss placed Lilly atop a turnbuckle. Marie taunted Bliss by taking the doll and slapping it which enraged Bliss. As Bliss attempted Twisted Bliss on Marie, Marie moved out of the way. In the end, Bliss performed a DDT on Marie to win the match. Following the match, Doudrop announced Marie as the loser of the match and proceeded to wear Marie's robe.\nAfter that, Sheamus defended the United States Championship against Damian Priest. In the closing moments of the match, as Sheamus applied a Leg Lock on Priest, Priest grabbed and removed Sheamus' protective face mask (as Sheamus had broken his nose a few weeks prior in a match against Humberto Carrillo). As Sheamus attempted a Brogue Kick, Priest performed a Spinning Kick and the Reckoning on Sheamus to win the title.\nIn the fourth match, The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) defended the SmackDown Tag Team Championship against The Mysterios (Rey Mysterio and Dominik Mysterio). In the end, after an evenly competitive match, The Usos performed a Double Superkick on Rey and Jimmy performed a Uso Splash on Rey to retain the titles.\nFollowing this, a brief segment then occurred with Rick Boogs playing the entrance theme of Intercontinental Champion King Nakamura to the ring. Nakamura eventually made his entrance alongside Boogs, where they danced alongside SmackDown commentator Pat McAfee.\nNext, Bianca Belair was scheduled to defend the SmackDown Women's Championship against Sasha Banks. However, it was announced that Banks was not cleared to compete and would be replaced by Carmella. Before the match began, Becky Lynch (in her first appearance since the \"Raw\" after Money in the Bank in May 2020) returned from her maternity leave and attacked Carmella. Lynch then challenged Belair for the title, which Belair accepted. As Lynch offered a handshake to which Belair accepted, Lynch struck Belair with a forearm and performed the Manhandle Slam to win the title in 26 seconds.\nFollowing this, a brief segment occurred where U.S. Olympic gold medalists (in wrestling), Tamyra Mensah-Stock and Gable Steveson, came out and the crowd cheered them while the two Olympians proudly displayed their respective medals.\nIn the sixth match, Drew McIntyre took on Jinder Mahal in which Mahal's teammates Shanky and Veer were banned from ringside. In the end, McIntyre performed the Future Shock DDT and the Claymore Kick on Mahal to win the match. Afterwards, Veer and Shanky came out to check on Mahal and McIntyre chased all three of them off with his sword.\nNext, Nikki A.S.H. defended the Raw Women's Championship against Rhea Ripley and Charlotte Flair in a triple threat match. At the start, Flair shoved Nikki. Both Nikki and Flair countered the Riptide from Ripley. Nikki performed a Crossbody off the top rope onto Ripley and Flair who were outside the ring. Flair countered a Double Suplex into a Double DDT on Ripley and Nikki. Flair then performed a Moonsault on Ripley and Nikki off the top rope. As Flair applied the Figure Eight on Ripley, Nikki performed a Splash to avoid the submission. In the end, after moving out of the way of a Splash from Nikki, Flair forced Nikki to submit to the Figure Eight to win her record sixth Raw Women's Championship, making her 14th overall singles title in WWE, and her 15th title overall, although WWE has promoted it as her 12th singles title, not counting her two NXT Women's Championship reigns.\nIn the eighth match, Edge took on Seth Rollins. Edge reenacted The Brood's entrance (a group Edge was once a member of earlier in his WWE career in 1998–1999) before coming to the ring to his regular entrance. Rollins began to target the surgically repaired neck of Edge by slamming it into the steel steps. Rollins performed a Frog Splash on Edge for a nearfall. Edge performed a Swinging Neckbreaker from the top rope on Rollins. As Edge went back to the top rope, Rollins performed a Superplex and a Falcon Arrow on Edge for a nearfall.

After a domination from Goldberg and Lashley respectively, the last was thrown by the first from the top of a corner into the ring, slamming his back. Goldberg attempted a Spear on Lashley, but when MVP took Lashley out of the ring, Goldberg performed the move on Lashley at ringside. Back in the ring, while Lashley was rolling for recovering, MVP attacked Goldberg with his cane on one knee. Then, Lashley attacked the injured knee with multiple chop blocks and rammed it into a ring post. Goldberg was unable to continue, resulting in the referee stopping the match and Lashley retaining the WWE Championship. After the match, Lashley attacked the injured knee again with a chair and also gave Goldberg a little cut on a shoulder. Finally, Goldberg's 15-year-old son, Gage, came to his father's aid, but Lashley applied a Hurt Lock on Gage.\nMain event.\nIn the main event, Roman Reigns (accompanied by Paul Heyman) defended the Universal Championship against John Cena with a stipulation that Reigns would leave WWE if he lost. Cena started with Roll-Up and Inside Cradle pin attempts. Reigns countered the Attitude Adjustment into a DDT for a nearfall. Reigns locked in a Guillotine Choke, however, Cena escaped. As Reigns attempted a Spear, Cena countered with a kick and a Five Knuckle Shuffle. Cena performed an Attitude Adjustment on Reigns for a nearfall. As Cena applied the STF, Reigns reached the rope to void the submission. Cena performed a second Attitude Adjustment on Reigns through the announce table, after which, Cena rolled Reigns back in the ring for a nearfall. As Cena attempted another Attitude Adjustment, Reigns performed a Superman Punch for a nearfall. Reigns attempted another Spear on Cena, however, Cena moved out of the way and Reigns rammed into the ring post. Cena performed a Super Attitude Adjustment off the top rope for a nearfall. In the end, as Cena taunted Reigns and attempted his own Spear, Reigns performed the Superman Punch twice and a Spear on Cena to retain the title and stay in WWE. Following the match, Brock Lesnar returned for the first time since WrestleMania 36 and confronted Reigns much to Heyman's surprise. After a stare down, Reigns left the ring as the crowd cheered Lesnar to end the event. After the event went off the air, Lesnar executed multiple German suplexes and an F-5 on Cena, reminiscent of their match from SummerSlam in 2014.\nReception.\nThe event had an attendance of 51,326. At the time, this marked the second-largest crowd in the event's history and the highest-grossing SummerSlam event of all time. However, a tweet by WrestleTix said that the capacity for the event was 46,482, and that the number of tickets distributed was 45,690. The 2023 event overtook the 2021 event for both the second largest crowd and highest-grossing SummerSlam of all time. The event itself received generally positive reviews with two matches (Cena vs. Reigns and Edge vs. Rollins) especially praised by multiple reviewers, while the rest of the undercard was not as well received with mixed reviews and criticisms.\nBrent Brookhouse of \"CBS Sports\" gave the Edge vs. Seth Rollins match a grade of A+, stating that the match \"was stunningly good stuff from start to finish with a clear story told in the ring with Rollins' ruthless focus on Edge's neck and Edge running through a history of classic moves before going to \"the dark place\" to get the finish\". He gave the Universal Championship match a grade of A−, stating that the match was \"solid stuff\", and that the match had \"a slow early build before flipping to the next level\". Brookhouse stated that Alexa Bliss vs. Eva Marie was \"a match without substance\", but was \"for the best when it comes to Eva Marie\", and \"as a bonus, there was very little involvement from the doll\". However, Brookhouse criticized the SmackDown Women's Championship match, giving it a D+ grade, stating that the \"elation\" of Becky Lynch's return \"was completely squandered when Lynch won the title so quickly\". He concluded that \"the moment of the return was great\", but \"the payoff was awful\". Brookhouse stated that the worst match of the event was the WWE Championship match, which he gave a grade of D. He said that \"the match wasn't going to be worth anything\", and that the ending of the match \"was terrible and really brought the crowd down even though the crowd did not want Goldberg to win\". Finally, he said that \"this appears to have set up a rematch, however, which is yet another thing no one is asking for\".\nErik Beaston of \"Bleacher Report\" gave the Edge vs. Seth Rollins match a grade of B+, stating that \"the psychology and storytelling within this one were phenomenal and led to the best match of the show, by far\". He said that \"the match reflected the story\", and that Rollins enraged Edge \"to the point that he had to reach deep down within himself to find a dark side\". Beaston concluded that \"Rollins will come back, probably more driven and disturbed than ever before, looking to avenge the loss that took him further out of universal title contention. If it means another match between the two, bring it on\". He also gave the Universal Championship match a grade of B+, stating that it was \"a dramatic main event executed to perfection by two masters of their craft\", the \"timing of the near-falls was flawless\", and that the crowd was \"genuinely convinced either man could leave with the gold, despite WWE shoehorning in a stipulation late Friday\". Beaston stated that \"Reigns winning was absolutely the right call\", stating that \"his run as heel champion is unprecedented in its excellence and there's still plenty of mileage left on it\". He also praised Brock Lesnar's return, stating that it would \"be a dramatic storyline given the failures The Head of the Table has experienced against Lesnar\". Beaston criticized the WWE Championship match, giving it a grade of D, stating that the match was \"bad and totally exposed Goldberg's weaknesses\", and that the ending was \"designed almost exclusively to set up a rematch no one is asking for in Saudi Arabia\". He also said that the fans being against Goldberg \"did not help matters\", and that a future match between Lashley and Goldberg \"is anything but appealing and should be reconsidered before WWE manages to strip whatever mystique is left in the Goldberg character away for good\". Beaston gave the Alexa Bliss vs. Eva Marie match a grade of F, stating that it was \"disjointed\" and \"ugly\", and that \"the stuff with Lilly really needs to go\", stating that \"the idea of a doll winking and terrifying grown men and women is so far out of the realm of believable that it has become comically bad\". Beaston also panned the SmackDown Women's Championship match, also giving it an F grade. He said that \"what the company did to Bianca Belair and her championship reign was straight disrespectful\", stating that \"Belair, the same woman who survived grueling matches with Bayley and Banks, overcame numbers advantages against Carmella and Zelina Vega, was beaten in 26 seconds by Lynch\", and that it \"made no sense, completely unraveled months of creative strategy and by proxy, put a damper on Lynch's return\".\nWade Keller of \"Pro Wrestling Torch\" gave the Universal Championship match 4.25 stars, stating that the beginning was \"slow\", but \"built logically and effectively to a really good closing 10 minutes\". He also praised Brock Lesnar's return, stating that he \"already seems like he's having fun as a babyface\". Keller gave the Edge vs. Seth Rollins match 4 stars, stating that the match was \"dramatic\", the near-falls were \"effective\", and that it had \"innovative and nostalgic moves deep in the match to elevate the match to another level the longer it went\". Keller criticized the WWE Championship match, giving it 1 star. He said that the match seemed \"more like setting up a rematch then generically protecting Goldberg\", while calling it \"ambitious considering Goldberg age and his lack of matches lately along with just a general limited set of ring skills\", and that the \"flat \"to be continued\" finish took it down an extra notch\". Keller gave the Drew McIntyre vs. Jinder Mahal match 0.75 stars, stating that Jinder, Shanky, and Veer had no point of being on the roster \"if they blow off a feud that ate up all that TV time in such an anti-clamactic, but understandably swift, manner\", and that McIntyre's sword \"doesn't seem over with the fans\". Keller stated that Becky Lynch's return was \"a big moment\" and \"a net positive\", but \"less than ideal\", stating that Belair's quick loss \"pulls the rug out from under her\". He also said that \"they'd have been better to agree to a match another time, with Becky saying Belair deserves to have time to prepare for her, and then have Zelina Vega and Carmella attack them\". Keller also said that this would not have happened \"if it weren't for Bayley's injury and the Sasha situation, so compromises were made to avoid a big letdown since they have no one else credible to substitute in for Sasha against Belair\".\nThe highest rated matches on the card, according to Dave Meltzer, were the Universal Championship match and Edge vs. Seth Rollins, both receiving 4.25 stars. The Raw Women's Championship match received 3.75 stars, the Raw and SmackDown Tag Team Championship matches both received 3.25 stars, the United States Championship match received 3 stars, the Kickoff pre-show match received 2.5 stars, the Drew McIntyre vs. Jinder Mahal match received 2 stars, and the WWE Championship match received 1.75 stars, while the only non-rated matches at the event were the Alexa Bliss vs. Eva Marie match and the SmackDown Women's Championship match.\nAftermath.\nThe 2021 SummerSlam would be the final SummerSlam PPV in which WWE owner Vince McMahon served as the company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), as he announced his retirement on July 22, 2022, just eight days before the following year's SummerSlam, the first and only time a SummerSlam event was held in that month. His daughter, Stephanie McMahon, and WWE President Nick Khan took over as co-CEOs, and the former also took over as Chairwoman of WWE. However, on January 10, 2023, Stephanie announced her resignation as co-CEO and Chairwoman, with Khan being the sole CEO and Vince returning as Executive Chairman.\nRaw.\nAfter SummerSlam, Goldberg was off television for the next month due to his (kayfabe) knee injury while Bobby Lashley lost the WWE Championship to Big E in the latter's Money in the Bank cash-in match. Goldberg returned on the October 4 episode of \"Raw\" and proclaimed that he would kill Lashley for what he did to his son. Lashley stated that his attack on Gage was a misunderstanding, which Goldberg refused to believe. Lashley then stated he would face Goldberg at Crown Jewel on the condition that the match was a No Holds Barred match, which Goldberg gladly accepted. The match was also stipulated as a Falls Count Anywhere match. At the event, Goldberg defeated Lashley to end the feud.\nOn the August 30 episode of \"Raw\", new United States Champion Damian Priest defended the title against Sheamus and Drew McIntyre in a triple threat match where Priest retained. On the following episode, Sheamus defeated McIntyre to earn a rematch against Priest at Extreme Rules. On the September 20 episode, Jeff Hardy defeated Sheamus to earn a spot in the title match at Extreme Rules, thus making it a triple threat match.\nOn September 4, following his appearance at SummerSlam, it was announced that U.S. Olympic Gold Medalist Gable Steveson had reportedly signed a contract with WWE. Five days later, WWE confirmed they had signed Steveson to a Next In Line (NIL) deal. As part of the 2021 WWE Draft in October, Steveson was drafted to the Raw brand.\nOn the following \"Raw\", Xavier Woods defeated The Miz due to an untimely assist by John Morrison. Afterwards, Miz turned on Morrison, ending their tag team.\nAlso on \"Raw\", Eva Marie attacked Doudrop, ending their alliance. The two were supposed to have a match the following week, but Doudrop attacked Marie before the match. Doudrop would then defeat Marie on the September 13 and September 20 episodes of \"Raw\". On the September 27 episode, in what would be Marie's last appearance before her release in November, Marie cost Doudrop the latter's Raw Women's Championship match.\nOn October 4, a championship rematch between new Raw Tag Team Champions RK-Bro (Randy Orton and Riddle) and AJ Styles and Omos was scheduled for Crown Jewel, where RK-Bro retained.\nSmackDown.\nOn the September 10 episode of \"SmackDown\", Brock Lesnar again appeared to confront Roman Reigns and claimed that his former advocate, Paul Heyman, who had been serving as Reigns' special counsel since August 2020, knew Lesnar would be at SummerSlam in an attempt to cause dissension between Reigns and Heyman. Lesnar then challenged Heyman to accept a match against Reigns for the Universal Championship. Later that night, Reigns accepted the challenge. On September 16, WWE announced that the match would occur at Crown Jewel. Before that, however, Finn Bálor received his promised championship match against Reigns at Extreme Rules where Reigns defeated Bálor, who had competed in his \"Demon\" persona, to retain the title. At Crown Jewel, Reigns retained after interference from The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso). Their next match would take place at Night 2 of WrestleMania 38 with Lesnar as WWE Champion after winning the title at Elimination Chamber. The match was a Winner Takes All Championship Unification match, which Reigns won to claim both titles and become recognized as the Undisputed WWE Universal Champion. They would have one further match at the following year's SummerSlam, this time as a Last Man Standing match, where Reigns retained.\nOn the first \"SmackDown\" after SummerSlam, Bianca Belair challenged Becky Lynch to a rematch for the SmackDown Women's Championship, however, Lynch refused. Belair then won a fatal four-way elimination match to become the number one contender. After Lynch refused to defend her title the next week, stating she would defend the title when she was ready, WWE officials Adam Pearce and Sonya Deville scheduled Lynch to defend the title against Belair at Extreme Rules. At that event, Sasha Banks made her return, and attacked both Belair and Lynch, thus the match was ruled a no contest. On October 1, a triple threat match between the three for the SmackDown Women's Championship was scheduled for Crown Jewel. Also, in the main event of that night's \"SmackDown\", Belair and Banks had their one-on-one match, where Banks was victorious after interference from Lynch. At Crown Jewel, Lynch retained, though Belair was not involved in the decision. After Lynch and Belair were drafted to Raw during the 2021 WWE Draft (with Lynch subsequently trading championships with the Raw Women's Champion), Belair earned a Raw Women's Championship match at WrestleMania 38 by winning an Elimination Chamber match at Elimination Chamber. At Night 1 of WrestleMania 38, Belair defeated Lynch to win the title. They also had a match at the following year's SummerSlam, where Belair again retained. Afterwards, Lynch embraced Belair, turning face for the first time since May 2020.\nUnsatisfied with his loss to Edge, Seth Rollins challenged Edge to a rematch that occurred on the September 10 episode of \"SmackDown\" that Rollins won. Rollins was still unsatisfied, however, as he continued to taunt Edge over the next few weeks and challenged him to return. After Rollins made it more personal by breaking into Edge's home, Edge challenged Rollins to a Hell in a Cell match, which was scheduled for Crown Jewel. At the event, Edge defeated Rollins, ending their feud in the process."

        "text": "The 2022 SummerSlam was the 35th annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event produced by WWE. It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The event took place on Saturday, July 30, 2022, at Nissan Stadium in Nashville, Tennessee, marking the first and only SummerSlam to not be held during the month of August. This was also the first WWE pay-per-view and livestreaming event following the retirement of WWE owner Vince McMahon, who had served as chairman and chief executive officer of the company since 1982. McMahon announced his retirement on July 22, eight days before SummerSlam. However, he returned as Executive Chairman on January 10, 2023.\nEight matches were contested at the event. In the main event, Roman Reigns defeated Brock Lesnar in a Last Man Standing match to retain the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship, which was billed as their final match against each other. In other prominent matches, Pat McAfee defeated Happy Corbin, Logan Paul defeated The Miz, The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) defeated The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford) to retain the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship, Liv Morgan defeated Ronda Rousey to retain her SmackDown Women's Championship in a conflicted ending, and in the opening bout, Bianca Belair defeated Becky Lynch to retain the Raw Women's Championship. The event also saw the returns of Bayley, Dakota Kai (who had been released from her WWE contract in April), Io Shirai, and Edge.\nThe event received positive reviews from critics, who, along with fans, lauded the main event, and welcomed the new creative direction the company was taking. Praise was also directed to Logan Paul's performance and the Raw Women's Championship match, but criticism was directed at the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship match, the SmackDown Women's Championship match, and the United States Championship match.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSummerSlam is an annual professional wrestling event that had previously been produced every August by WWE since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views (PPV), along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and Survivor Series, originally dubbed the \"Big Four\", and as of August 2021, it is considered one of the \"Big Five\", along with Money in the Bank. Out of the five, it is considered WWE's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. Announced on October 25, 2021, the 2022 event was the first to not be held during the month of August. Instead, the 35th SummerSlam was scheduled to take place on Saturday, July 30, 2022, at the Nissan Stadium in Nashville, Tennessee. It featured wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown brand divisions, and in addition to airing on traditional pay-per-view, it was available to livestream on Peacock in the United States and the WWE Network in international markets. Tickets went on sale on April 22, with premium hospitality packages also available. It was also the first SummerSlam since 2011 to incorporate a new logo and the first since 2008 to not feature the Star background of the logo. \nEight days before SummerSlam on July 22, WWE owner Vince McMahon announced his retirement from the company. He had served as chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) since 1982. The 2022 SummerSlam was in turn the first WWE pay-per-view and livestreaming event following his retirement. Stephanie McMahon and WWE President Nick Khan took over as co-CEOs, and the former also took over as Chairwoman of WWE. However, on January 10, 2023, Stephanie announced her resignation as co-CEO and Chairwoman, with Nick Khan being the sole CEO and Vince returning as Executive Chairman.\nStorylines.\nThe event included matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Monday Night Raw\" and \"Friday Night SmackDown\".\nAt WrestleMania 38 in April, SmackDown's Universal Champion Roman Reigns defeated Raw's WWE Champion Brock Lesnar in a Winner Takes All match to become recognized as the Undisputed WWE Universal Champion. After Reigns retained the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship on the June 17 episode of \"SmackDown\", he claimed there was no one left to face him. Lesnar then made a surprise return after a two-month hiatus and offered Reigns a handshake. As Reigns went to shake his hand, Lesnar attacked Reigns and then attacked The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso), who had come to Reigns' aid. It was subsequently announced that Reigns would defend the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship against Lesnar in a Last Man Standing match at SummerSlam, which WWE billed as their last match against each other.\nOn the June 17 episode of \"SmackDown\", after losing to Madcap Moss, Happy Corbin confronted commentator Pat McAfee—a former teammate when both played in the National Football League who consistently criticized Corbin on-air for his underhanded tactics. The following week, McAfee challenged Corbin to a match at SummerSlam. After Money in the Bank went off the air, Corbin attacked McAfee and subsequently accepted the challenge.\nAt Money in the Bank, Bobby Lashley defeated Theory to win the United States Championship. On the following episode of \"Raw\", Theory announced he was granted a rematch against Lashley for the title at SummerSlam.\nAt Money in the Bank, The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) defeated The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford) to retain the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship. Following the match, replayed footage of the pinfall showed that Ford's shoulder was off the mat, thus the pinfall should not have been counted. A championship rematch was then subsequently scheduled for SummerSlam. On the July 15 episode of \"SmackDown\", after Dawkins defeated Jimmy despite Jimmy's shoulder being off the mat, WWE official Adam Pearce announced that WWE Hall of Famer and Nashville area native Jeff Jarrett would be the special guest referee for the match.\nAt Money in the Bank, Liv Morgan won the women's Money in the Bank ladder match to earn a contract for a women's championship match of her choosing. After Ronda Rousey retained the SmackDown Women's Championship later that same night, Morgan ran out and used the contract to cash in on Rousey and win the title. On the following \"SmackDown\", it was announced that Morgan would defend the title in a rematch against Rousey at SummerSlam.\nAt WrestleMania 38, social media influencer Logan Paul teamed with The Miz in a tag team match in which they were victorious. However, unpleased that Paul scored the pinfall, Miz turned on and attacked Paul. In June, photos began surfacing of Paul training for an in-ring return and then on June 30, it was announced that Paul had officially signed with WWE. In a short video following the announcement, Paul said he was coming for The Miz. Paul then appeared on the July 18 episode of \"Raw\" to confront Miz and challenged him to a match at SummerSlam. Miz initially rejected, but after being goaded by Paul, Miz accepted.\nAt the previous year's SummerSlam, Becky Lynch made a return from maternity leave and faced Bianca Belair in an impromptu match where she defeated Belair in 26 seconds to win the SmackDown Women's Championship. The two would face each other again at WrestleMania 38, this time for Lynch's Raw Women's Championship, where Belair was victorious. Over the next few months, Lynch failed various attempts to regain the championship. On the July 11 episode of \"Raw\", during Belair's title defense, Lynch caused Belair to lose via countout, but Belair retained the title. The following week, Lynch stated that whoever was the champion by the end of the night would defend the title against her at SummerSlam. Lynch then attacked Belair, with the women's championship match occurring immediately afterwards. Belair again retained, keeping her as the defending champion heading into her match against Lynch at SummerSlam, with Belair vowing to rewrite what happened at SummerSlam the previous year.\nOn the June 27 episode of \"Raw\", The Mysterios (Rey Mysterio and Dominik Mysterio were confronted backstage by Judgment Day members Damian Priest and Finn Bálor, who wanted Dominik to join their faction. This led to a match between the two teams for the following week, where Priest and Bálor attacked The Mysterios before the match began, but The Mysterios were still able to defeat Priest and Bálor with an Eddie Guerrero chair trick. The following week, Bálor and Priest confronted Dominik backstage, suggesting that he join The Judgment Day. This led to a match between Bálor and Rey, where Bálor won. On the July 18 episode, after Judgment Day again suggested Dominik join their group, Priest defeated Rey. After the match, Priest and Bálor threatened Rey with a Con-chair-to, but Dominik made the save. On the final \"Raw\" before SummerSlam, in what was Rey's 20 year anniversary of his WWE debut, Rey and Dominik defeated Bálor and Priest. While they were celebrating backstage, however, Priest and Rhea Ripley, also from Judgment Day, attacked them, with Priest sending Rey through a table. Later that night, a No Disqualification tag team match pitting The Mysterios against Bálor and Priest was made official for SummerSlam.\nEvent.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe pay-per-view opened with Bianca Belair defending the Raw Women's Championship against Becky Lynch. Early in the match, Belair accidentally legitimately dislocated Lynch's shoulder. Outside the ring, Lynch countered a Kiss of Death from Belair and attacked Belair near the timekeeper's area. Lynch performed Diamond Dust on Belair for a nearfall. Later, Belair performed a Kiss Of Death on Lynch outside the ring. Belair intended for a countout victory, however, Lynch rolled back in the ring at nine. Lynch pulled Belair, who was atop a turnbuckle, into the ring by the latter's braid and performed a Manhandle Slam for a nearfall. In the closing moments, as Lynch attempted a second Manhandle Slam from the middle rope, Belair countered into a Spanish Fly and the Kiss of Death on Lynch to retain the title. Following the match, Belair and Lynch shook hands and embraced each other. Bayley then made her return for the first time since July 2021 to confront Belair. She was accompanied by a returning Dakota Kai (who had been released from her WWE contract in April) and Io Shirai (who was billed under the new ring name \"Iyo Sky\", stylized in all caps), both making their main roster debuts. Sky and Kai turned into heels by siding with Bayley, who attempted to taunt Belair. Lynch then sided with Belair, thus Lynch turned face for the first time since May 2020. Bayley, Sky, and Kai then retreated while Lynch and Belair continued to show mutual respect to each other.\nNext, Logan Paul faced The Miz (accompanied by Maryse and Ciampa). During the match, Paul applied the figure-four leglock on Miz, however, Miz reached the ropes to void the submission. Paul performed a Crossbody and standing moonsault on Miz for a nearfall. Ciampa attempted to attack Paul only for the referee to catch him. Although the referee sent Ciampa backstage, Ciampa refused to comply and obtained a steel chair to sit. AJ Styles then came out and attacked Ciampa from behind. Paul performed a Phenomenal Forearm on Miz for a nearfall. Paul then performed a Frog Splash on Miz through the announce table. In the end, as Paul attempted a pin on Miz, Maryse distracted the referee. As Miz attempted to attack Paul with a necklace, he almost struck Maryse, who stood on the ring apron, however, Paul took advantage and performed a Skull Crushing Finale on Miz in the ring to win the match.\nAfter that, Bobby Lashley defended the United States Championship against Theory. During Lashley's entrance, Theory attacked Lashley with the Money in the Bank briefcase. Midway through the match, Theory attempted to walk away from the match, however, Lashley intercepted him. Lashley performed a Running Powerslam on Theory. As Lashley attempted a spear on Theory, Theory leapt over Lashley. In the end, Lashley applied the Hurt Lock on Theory, who submitted, thus Lashley retained the title.\nThe next match saw The Mysterios (Rey Mysterio and Dominik Mysterio) face The Judgment Day (Finn Bálor and Damian Priest, accompanied by Rhea Ripley) in a No Disqualification tag team match. In the closing moments, former Judgment Day leader Edge made his return and performed a Spear on Priest and Bàlor. The Mysterios then performed a double 619 on Bàlor. Rey followed with a Frog Splash on Bálor to win the match.\nNext, Happy Corbin fought Pat McAfee. In the closing moments, as Corbin attempted End of Days on McAfee, McAfee performed a right hand on Corbin, who inadvertently incapacitated the referee. McAfee performed a low blow and a Powerbomb on Corbin to win the match.\nFollowing that, Drew McIntyre came out to cut a promo where he spoke about his upcoming Undisputed WWE Universal Championship match at Clash at the Castle. McIntyre stated that it did not matter who won the main event that night as he would defeat them at Clash at the Castle to become champion.\nNext, The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) defended the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship against The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford), with WWE Hall of Famer Jeff Jarrett as the special guest referee. In the end, The Usos performed the 1D on Dawkins to retain the titles.\nFollowing that, Matt Riddle came out and called out Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins; they were originally scheduled to face each other at SummerSlam, however, Riddle was injured by Rollins on the \"Raw\" before the event, thus Riddle was not medically cleared. Rollins came out, however, WWE officials came out to warn Rollins. Rollins and Riddle eventually fought which ended with Rollins performing a Stomp on Riddle. It was later revealed that this match was canceled due to Riddle failing a drug test.\nIn the penultimate match, Liv Morgan defended the SmackDown Women's Championship against Ronda Rousey. Early in the match, Morgan performed a Codebreaker on Rousey. As Morgan attempted an Ob-Livion on Rousey, Rousey countered and applied the armbar on Morgan only for Morgan to reach the ropes to void the submission. In the closing moments, as Rousey applied the armbar on Morgan once again, Rousey's shoulders were on the mat. The referee counted the pin, however, he did not notice Morgan tap out before the three count, thus Morgan retained the title. Following the match, an irate Rousey attacked Morgan and the referee, turning heel for the first time since 2019.\nMain event.\nIn the main event, Roman Reigns (accompanied by Paul Heyman) defended the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship against Brock Lesnar in a Last Man Standing match.

An irate Reigns attacked Lesnar with Theory's Money in the Bank briefcase, who still stood up at nine. Reigns then struck Lesnar with the WWE title belt, who stood up at nine. In the closing moments, Reigns attacked Lesnar, this time with the Universal title belt, and proceeded with The Usos to place pieces of the broken announce table, steel chairs and amplifier on a battered Lesnar and stood on the debris for the ten count.\nReception.\nThe event was met with positive reviews from critics, who welcomed the company's new creative direction and lauded the main event. WWE reported on the \"Raw\" after SummerSlam that it had surpassed 1.3 billion video views on social media for the event. Brent Brookhouse of \"CBS Sports\" praised the event and also gave his highest ratings of letter grade A to the Reigns vs. Lesnar main event match. Wrestling journalist Dave Meltzer of the \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\" rated the Raw Women's Championship bout and the Logan vs. Miz match 4 stars, the United States title match 1.5 stars, the No DQ tag team match and the Undisputed WWE Tag Team title match 3.5 stars, the McAfee-Corbin bout 3 stars, the SmackDown Women's Championship match 1 star (the lowest rated match on the card), and the main event 4.5 stars.\nAftermath.\nThe 2022 SummerSlam would be the only SummerSlam to take place in July, as the following year's event returned to August.\nRaw.\nAfter SummerSlam, the trio of Bayley, Dakota Kai, and Iyo Sky would dub themselves as Damage CTRL, and they continued to target Raw Women's Champion Bianca Belair. This led to a six-woman tag team match at Clash at the Castle, where Damage CTRL defeated Belair's team in which Bayley pinned Belair. Due to pinning the champion, Bayley challenged Belair to a ladder match for the title at Extreme Rules, and Belair accepted.\nOn the following \"Raw\", Damage CTRL (Bayley, Dakota Kai, and Iyo Sky) attacked Becky Lynch backstage. This was done to write Lynch off television due to her dislocated shoulder. Lynch made her return in November, and led her team in defeating Damage CTRL's team in a WarGames match at Survivor Series WarGames.

        "text": " \nThe 2023 SummerSlam, also promoted as SummerSlam: Detroit, was the 36th annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event produced by WWE. It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The event took place on Saturday, August 5, 2023, at Ford Field in Detroit, Michigan, returning the event to its traditional August slot after the previous year's event was held in July. This was the first SummerSlam livestreamed on Binge in Australia. It was the first WWE event held at Ford Field since WrestleMania 23 in April 2007. Michigan previously hosted SummerSlam in 1993.\nNine matches were contested at the event, with four promoted as main event matches. In the final match of the night, which was one of SmackDown's two main matches, Roman Reigns defeated Jey Uso in Tribal Combat to retain the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship and recognition of Tribal Chief of the Anoaʻi family. For SmackDown's other main match, Bianca Belair defeated defending champion Asuka and Charlotte Flair in a triple threat match to win the WWE Women's Championship, after which, Iyo Sky cashed in her Money in the Bank contract and defeated Belair to win the title. For Raw's two main matches, Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins defeated Finn Bálor to retain the World Heavyweight Championship and Cody Rhodes defeated Brock Lesnar. The event also featured Ronda Rousey's final WWE appearance; she lost to Shayna Baszler in an MMA Rules match at the event and then left WWE in October.\nAccording to WWE, this was the highest-grossing SummerSlam of all time, as well as the company's highest-grossing event outside of WrestleMania. WWE claimed an attendance of 59,194; however, this number has been disputed, with an actual paid attendance of 51,477. It was the second-largest crowd in SummerSlam history, after the 1992 event. This would subsequently be the final SummerSlam in which WWE was majority owned and controlled by the McMahon family before the company's deal with Endeavor was finalized on September 12, 2023, which saw WWE and Endeavor-owned Ultimate Fighting Championship subsequently merging to become divisions of a new jointly formed corporate entity called TKO Group Holdings.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSummerSlam is an annual professional wrestling event traditionally held in August by WWE since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's five biggest events of the year, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, Survivor Series, and Money in the Bank, referred to as the \"Big Five\". Out of the five, it is considered WWE's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania.\nAnnounced on February 7, 2023, the 36th SummerSlam was scheduled to be held on Saturday, August 5, 2023, at Ford Field in Detroit, Michigan, returning SummerSlam to its traditional August slot after the previous year was held in July. This also marked WWE's first event to be held at Ford Field since WrestleMania 23 in April 2007, and the first SummerSlam to be held in Michigan since the 1993 event. The event featured wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown brand divisions, and in addition to airing on pay-per-view worldwide and the livestreaming services Peacock in the United States and the WWE Network in most international markets, it was also the first SummerSlam to livestream on Binge in Australia after the Australian version of the WWE Network merged under Foxtel's channel Binge in January. Detroit area native, musician, and WWE Hall of Famer Kid Rock did the cold open for the event.\nTickets went on sale on April 14. Pre-sale opened the previous day, with a reported 25,000–30,000 tickets sold. By July 28, a reported 45,971 tickets had been sold.\nFrom January 2023, there had been speculation that WWE had been placed up for sale. Hours before WrestleMania 39 Night 2 began, CNBC reported via multiple sources that a deal between WWE and Endeavor, the parent company of Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) via Zuffa, was imminent. The deal involved a merger of WWE with the UFC into a new publicly traded company, with Endeavor holding a 51% stake. The sale was confirmed the next day on April 3 and was finalized on September 12, with WWE merging with the UFC to become divisions of TKO Group Holdings. The 2023 SummerSlam was in turn the final SummerSlam held in which WWE was still owned and controlled by the McMahon family.\nSummerSlam took place on the same night as the boxing match between Jake Paul and Nate Diaz in Dallas, Texas. To support his brother, Logan Paul requested, and was granted, the opening spot on the show's card so that he could make the two-hour flight in order to accompany his brother for his boxing match.\nStorylines.\nThe event included matches that resulted from scripted storylines. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Monday Night Raw\" and \"Friday Night SmackDown\".\nOn the \"Raw\" after WrestleMania 39, for unknown reasons, Brock Lesnar viciously attacked Cody Rhodes before both were set to participate in a tag team match. This resulted in a match at Backlash that Rhodes won. A rematch occurred at Night of Champions, which Lesnar won via submission due to Rhodes passing out to the Kimura Lock submission. Due to Rhodes and Lesnar having 1 win each, and the fact that Rhodes passed out and did not give up, Rhodes issued an open challenge to Lesnar for anytime, anywhere on the following episode of \"Raw\". Lesnar returned on the July 3 episode, where he brawled with Rhodes. The following week, Rhodes challenged Lesnar to a third match at SummerSlam. After viciously attacking Rhodes on the next episode, Lesnar accepted the challenge.\nAt Money in the Bank, Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins successfully defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Finn Bálor after Judgment Day stablemate, Damian Priest, who had won the men's Money in the Bank ladder match earlier that night, accidentally distracted Bálor. On the following episode of \"Raw\", in a match between Rollins and Judgment Day's \"Dirty\" Dominik Mysterio, Priest attacked Rollins, thus Rollins won by disqualification. As Priest attempted to cash in his Money in the Bank contract, Bálor appeared and attacked Rollins, costing Priest his opportunity, which caused some disagreement between Bálor and Priest. The following week, arguments between Bálor and Priest intensified, however, both Bálor and Priest agreed that Bálor should receive a title match first. Later, The Judgment Day defeated Rollins' team in a six-man tag team match. On the July 17 episode, Bálor challenged Rollins to a rematch for the title, however, Rollins declined and stated that they could settle their differences that night without the title as both had issues with each other. As Bálor seemingly left, he viciously attacked Rollins. A match between the two for the World Heavyweight Championship was then scheduled for SummerSlam.\nAt Night of Champions, Asuka defeated Bianca Belair to win the Raw Women's Championship. As a result of the 2023 WWE Draft, the title was drafted to \"SmackDown\" and on the June 9 episode of \"SmackDown\", Asuka was presented with a new championship belt to resolve the issue, and the title reverted to its original name of WWE Women's Championship. Prior to the presentation, WWE official Adam Pearce requested Belair not to interrupt, who stated that she wanted a rematch for the title. However, Charlotte Flair, in her first appearance since Night 1 of WrestleMania 39, interrupted and challenged Asuka for the title. Asuka accepted, much to the dismay of Belair. The title match was scheduled for the June 30 episode. Belair watched as a fan from ringside where Flair accidentally struck Belair. This infuriated Belair, who attacked Asuka, ending the match in a disqualification win for Asuka. Following the match, Belair attacked Asuka and Flair. On the next episode, a brawl between the three occurred, which also involved Damage CTRL (Bayley and women's Money in the Bank winner Iyo Sky), with an unsuccessful cash-in attempt from Sky. A title match between Asuka and Belair was scheduled for the July 14 episode. Before the match, Belair and Flair agreed that if Belair won, she would defend the title against Flair at SummerSlam. During the match, however, Flair accidentally struck Belair once again after Damage CTRL once again tried to interfere. As a result of Flair's actions, Belair won the match by disqualification but not the title. On July 21, a triple threat match between Asuka, Belair, and Flair for the WWE Women's Championship was scheduled for SummerSlam.\nAt Night of Champions during The Bloodline's (Roman Reigns and Solo Sikoa) match for the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship, The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) interfered and unintentionally struck Sikoa. After an irate Reigns shoved both Usos around, Jimmy attacked Reigns out of pent up anger after weeks of disrespect from Reigns, thus leaving The Bloodline, and Reigns and Sikoa would ultimately lose the match. Jey would also leave The Bloodline on the June 16 episode of \"SmackDown\", where he attacked Reigns and Sikoa, choosing to stand by his brother Jimmy's side. This led to a \"Bloodline Civil War\" tag team match at Money in the Bank, where The Usos defeated Reigns and Sikoa with Jey pinning Reigns, which was the first time Reigns was pinned since in December 2019. On the following \"SmackDown\", a trial for Reigns was held where Reigns feigned that he did not want to be the Tribal Chief any longer and attacked Jey with a low blow. Sikoa and Reigns brutally attacked Jimmy, who was taken to a hospital. Later that night, Jey viciously attacked Reigns and Sikoa with a steel chair before challenging Reigns for the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship. The following week, Jey spoke about his family's relationship with one another before he was interrupted by Sikoa and Reigns' special counsel Paul Heyman, who stated that Reigns would meet Jey the following week to discuss the \"rules of engagement\". The following week, during the \"rules of engagement\", it was agreed that Reigns would defend the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship against Jey in an anything goes match called Tribal Combat, where in addition to the title, the winner would be recognized as the Tribal Chief of the Anoaʻi family. This goes back to the early days of Reigns' Universal Championship reign, where he defeated Jey in a Hell in a Cell \"I Quit\" match in October 2020, and forced Jey to acknowledge him as the \"Head of the Table\".\nAt the Royal Rumble in January, Logan Paul and Ricochet were participants in the men's Royal Rumble match. During the match, both were involved in a high spot in which they performed simultaneous springboard clotheslines at each other from opposite sides of the ring and collided in midair, which went viral across social media. In June 2023, issues resurfaced between Ricochet and Paul and resumed after Paul was added to the men's Money in the Bank ladder match without qualifying like the other participants, including Ricochet. During the match, the two brawled with each other, where Ricochet performed a springboard Spanish fly on Paul through two tables outside the ring, taking both out for the remainder of the match. Later in a backstage segment, Paul attacked Ricochet for costing him a title opportunity. Ricochet then invited Paul to meet him face-to-face on the July 10 episode of \"Raw\" where he challenged Paul to a match only for Paul to decline. Paul once again accepted Ricochet's invitation to meet him on the July 24 episode where Paul attacked Ricochet from behind and then accepted his challenge to a match at SummerSlam.\nOn Night 2 of WrestleMania 39, Gunther successfully defended the Intercontinental Championship in a triple threat match, which also involved Drew McIntyre, who Gunther pinned to retain the title. Following this, McIntyre went on hiatus for the next three months. After Gunther successfully defended his championship at Money in the Bank, McIntyre made a surprise return and brawled with Gunther. McIntyre then taunted Gunther with the title. McIntyre then started a rivalry with Imperium (Gunther, Ludwig Kaiser, and Giovanni Vinci) over the next few weeks, including defeating Kaiser and Vinci in a tag team match on the July 10 episode of \"Raw\". The following week, after Gunther's match, Gunther called out McIntyre and challenged him with a face-to-face segment scheduled for the next episode. On the next episode, McIntyre challenged Gunther to a match for his championship that night, however, Gunther declined, stating that he would defend it against McIntyre at SummerSlam, which was made official.\nAt Money in the Bank, Ronda Rousey and Shayna Baszler lost the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship after Baszler turned on Rousey. On the following episode of \"Raw\", Rousey called out Baszler, who claimed that she was responsible for bringing Rousey into WWE, and while she had to work her way through the WWE system, beginning in NXT, Rousey skipped the process and competed in her debut match at WrestleMania 34. Baszler then claimed that she was the one who could finally shut Rousey up, after which, Rousey and Baszler brawled with each other. and once again brawled the following week. On the July 17 episode, Baszler challenged Rousey to come to the ring, however, Rousey declined, and stated that she would fight Baszler at SummerSlam. The following week, both agreed to a match at SummerSlam, which was later confirmed. On the final \"Raw\" before SummerSlam, it was announced that the match would be a Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) Rules match.\nOn the July 28 episode of \"SmackDown\", it was announced that in a cross-promotion with Slim Jim, a SummerSlam Battle Royal would take place at the event and would feature male wrestlers from both Raw and SmackDown.

Lesnar then threw Rhodes out of the ring for a countout victory, however, Rhodes broke the count twice, which enraged Lesnar.

During the SummerSlam post-event press conference, WWE executive Triple H revealed that the 2023 event was the highest-grossing SummerSlam event of all time, as well as the highest-grossing event outside of WrestleMania. WWE also reported an attendance of 59,194. This number has been disputed, with a reported actual attendance of 51,477. Despite the dispute, this gives it the second-largest crowd in SummerSlam history, after the 1992 event, which had a reported attendance of 80,355 (although its actual attendance was 78,927, but still the largest).\nWrestling journalist Dave Meltzer of the \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\" rated the Logan-Ricochet match 4.25 stars, the Cody-Brock match and the World Heavyweight Championship match 4.5 stars (the highest rated matches on the card), the Slim Jim Battle Royal 2.75 stars, the MMA Rules bout 1.5 stars (the lowest rated match on the card), the Intercontinental Championship match 4 stars, the Women's Championship match 3.5 stars and the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship match 2.75 stars.\nAftermath.\nRaw.\nCody Rhodes opened the following episode of \"Raw\" and stated that he respected Lesnar after his gesture following their match at SummerSlam. Rhodes spoke about finishing his story and that he could beat anyone. This prompted World Heavyweight Champion Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins to come out and challenge Rhodes. The Judgment Day then came out and confronted the two. Bálor attacked Rollins, which led to one-half of the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Champions, Sami Zayn, coming out for the save. Rhodes, Rollins, and Zayn then challenged Judgment Day to a six-man tag team match. Later on, however, Zayn was attacked by JD McDonagh and was deemed unable to compete. Shinsuke Nakamura then offered to join Rhodes and Rollins in their match and he, Rollins, and Rhodes defeated Judgment Day. Following the match, Nakamura attacked Rollins, turning heel for the first time since 2021. This eventually led to a title match between Nakamura and Rollins for Payback.\nThe Miz, one of the wrestlers LA Knight eliminated from the Slim Jim Battle Royal, and Knight would continue their feud, including Miz costing Knight a shot at the United States Championship, eventually leading to a match at Payback.\nSmackDown.\n\"SmackDown\" opened with a one-on-one match between Charlotte Flair and former WWE Women's Champion Asuka, following their loss against Bianca Belair in the Triple Threat match for the title at SummerSlam. During the match, Damage CTRL appeared and the new WWE Women's Champion, Iyo Sky (who had cashed in her Money in the Bank contract on Belair), proceeded to attack Flair and Asuka, thus ending the match in a disqualification. Sky and Bayley continued to attack Flair and Asuka while Dakota Kai reminded the crowd who their new WWE Women's Champion was. The following week, Damage CTRL sidelined Belair with a knee injury.\nAs \"SmackDown\" was reaching its conclusion, Roman Reigns wanted to thank Jimmy Uso for helping him retain the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship and his Tribal Chief status against Jey Uso by betraying his twin brother. To show appreciation to Jimmy, he offered him anything he would want. However, Jimmy rejected the offer and explained that his actions at SummerSlam had nothing to do with Reigns. Jey Uso came out and demanded an explanation on why Jimmy betrayed him. Jimmy explained that he was afraid that he would lose Jey if he won the title, highlighting how the title would corrupt him just as it had corrupted Reigns. Jey turned his back on Jimmy, prompting the latter to leave the ring. Reigns proceeded to mock Jey for being emotional, which led to him attacking Reigns and Solo Sikoa in retaliation. Just as it seemed he was about to forgive Jimmy, Jey also attacked him with a Superkick for his betrayal. He then declared that he was quitting WWE following the mess within the Bloodline. However, Jimmy would rejoin The Bloodline, while Jey would move to Raw at Payback a few weeks later. This long rivalry would culminate at Night 1 of WrestleMania XL, which saw Jey defeat Jimmy."

Conference play started in January and concluded March 22, 2019. This season was the 38th season of MAAC basketball.\nThe MAAC season saw four teams spend considerable time being in first place; Rider, Monmouth, Canisius and Iona. Rider started MAAC play off strong, winning seven of their first eight MAAC games, and looking like they would prove the preseason #1 pick correct. But then a five-game losing streak left them at 7–6, and two games out of first place. Monmouth started the regular season 0–12 at one point, but rebounded when MAAC play started, posting a 9–4 conference mark by February 9. Then a four-game losing streak struck down the Hawks, knocking them out of first place. Canisius had a solid season, keeping up with Monmouth the whole way. Consecutive losses to Iona and Niagara late in the season struck down their first place hopes. Iona, which had won the MAAC Tournament three consecutive times coming into the season, started off 5–2, but like the others, a four-game losing streak left them at 5–6 in MAAC play. Sitting in sixth place, Iona found their new starting five combination, and reeled off seven straight wins to end the MAAC season, and take the regular season crown in 2019. It was the 11th MAAC regular season championship for the Gaels.\nThe 2019 MAAC tournament was held from March 7 through March 11 at the Times Union Center in Albany, New York. This marked the 20th time Albany has hosted the event. No. 1 seed Iona defeated No. 6 seed Monmouth in the championship game 81–60 to win the conference's automatic bid to the 2019 NCAA tournament. With the win, Iona became the first MAAC team to win four consecutive MAAC Tournament championships.\nQuinnipiac was the first MAAC team of the season to see postseason action, as they accepted an invitation to participate in the 2019 CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament, losing to NJIT 81–92 in the first round. Iona received a No. 16 seed in the NCAA Tournament Midwest Region, and faced No. 1 seed North Carolina in the first round on March 22, 2019. Iona led 38–33 at halftime, but despite Iona making 10 of 21 3-point tries in the first half, North Carolina started the second half on a 32–11 run to take control of the game, winning 88–73.\nHead coaches.\nCoaching changes.\nOn March 5, 2018, Marist head coach Mike Maker was fired. He finished at Marist with a four-year record of 28–97. Marist hired Saint Peter's coach John Dunne as Maker's successor on April 3.\nOn April 10, 2018, Seton Hall assistant coach Shaheen Holloway was hired as the new head coach at Saint Peter's.\nOn April 13, 2018, Siena head coach Jimmy Patsos resigned amid an investigation regarding abusive conduct and financial improprieties within the program.

The Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul, Turkey, was originally appointed to host the 2020 UEFA Champions League Final, but it was moved due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe to the Estádio da Luz in Lisbon. Istanbul was again appointed to host the final of the 2021 edition, but was eventually moved to Estádio do Dragão after Turkey was placed on the United Kingdom's red list for tourists and hosting it in England was ruled out.\nBayern Munich were the defending champions, but they were eliminated in the quarter-finals by Paris Saint-Germain, whom they had beaten in the previous year's final. As the winners of the 2020–21 UEFA Champions League, Chelsea played against Villarreal, the winners of the 2020–21 UEFA Europa League, in the 2021 UEFA Super Cup. They were also the European entry for the 2021 FIFA Club World Cup. Since they had already qualified to the 2021–22 UEFA Champions League group stage through their league performance, the berth originally reserved for the Champions League title holders has been transferred to the Champions of the 2020–21 Süper Lig, Beşiktaş, the 11th ranked association according to the next season access-list.\nThe 2020–21 season was the last season of UEFA European club competitions to feature the away goals rule.\nAssociation team allocation.\nA total of 79 teams from 54 of the 55 UEFA member associations participate in the 2020–21 UEFA Champions League (the exception being Liechtenstein, which does not organise a domestic league). The association ranking based on the UEFA country coefficients is used to determine the number of participating teams for each association:\nAssociation ranking.\nFor the 2020–21 UEFA Champions League, the associations are allocated places according to their 2019 UEFA country coefficients, which takes into account their performance in European competitions from 2014–15 to 2018–19.\nApart from the allocation based on the country coefficients, associations may have additional teams participating in the Champions League, as noted below:\nDistribution.\nThe following is the access list for this season.\nChanges were made to the default access list since the Champions League title holders, Bayern Munich, and the Europa League title holders, Sevilla, which were guaranteed berths in the Champions League group stage, already qualified for the Champions League group stage via their domestic leagues. However, as a result of schedule delays to both the 2019–20 and 2020–21 European seasons due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020–21 European season started before the conclusion of the 2019–20 European season. Therefore, the changes to the access list that should be made based on the Champions League and Europa League title holders could not be certain until matches of the earlier qualifying rounds had been played and/or their draws had been made. UEFA used \"adaptive re-balancing\" to change the access list once the berths for the Champions League and Europa League title holders were determined, and rounds which had already been drawn or played by the time the title holders were determined would not be impacted (Regulations Article 3.04). The following changes were made:\nTeams.\nIn early April 2020, UEFA announced that due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, the deadline for entering the tournament had been postponed until further notice. UEFA also sent a letter to all member associations that domestic leagues must be completed in full without ending prematurely in order to qualify for European competitions. After meeting with the 55 UEFA associations on 21 April 2020, UEFA strongly recommended them to finish domestic top league and cup competitions, although in some special cases where it is not possible, UEFA would develop guidelines concerning participation in its club competitions in case of a cancelled league or cup. After the UEFA Executive Committee meeting on 23 April 2020, UEFA announced that if a domestic competition is prematurely terminated for legitimate reasons in accordance with conditions related to public health or economic problems, the national associations concerned are required to select their participating teams for the 2020–21 UEFA club competitions based on sporting merit in the 2019–20 domestic competitions, and UEFA reserves the right to refuse their admission if UEFA deems the termination of the competitions not legitimate, or the selection procedure not objective, transparent and non-discriminatory, or the team is perceived by the public as qualifying unfairly. A suspended domestic competition may also be restarted with a different format from the original one in a manner which would still facilitate qualification on sporting merit. All leagues should communicate to UEFA by 25 May 2020 whether they intend to restart their competitions, but this deadline was later extended. On 17 June 2020, UEFA announced that associations must enter their teams by 3 August 2020.\nThe labels in the parentheses show how each team qualified for the place of its starting round:\nThe second qualifying round, third qualifying round and play-off round are divided into Champions Path (CH) and League Path (LP).\nNotes\nSchedule.\nThe schedule of the competition was as follows (all draws were held at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland unless otherwise stated). The tournament would originally have started in June 2020, but had been delayed to August due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. The new schedule was announced by the UEFA Executive Committee on 17 June 2020. All qualifying matches, excluding the play-off round, were played as single leg matches, hosted by one of the teams decided by draw (except the preliminary round which was played at neutral venue).\nThe group stage draw was originally to be held at the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center in Athens, Greece, but UEFA announced on 9 September 2020 that it would be relocated to Nyon, but it was eventually held at nearby Geneva.\nThe original schedule of the competition, as planned before the pandemic, was as follows (all draws were to be held at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland, unless stated otherwise).\nMajor revision to schedule.\nThe major revision to schedule of the competition, as planned before relocation the final from Istanbul, was as follows (all draws were to be held at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland, unless stated otherwise).\nEffects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, the following special rules were applicable to the competition:\nOn 24 September 2020, UEFA announced that five substitutions would be permitted from the group stage onward, with a sixth allowed in extra time. However, each team was only given three opportunities to make substitutions during matches, with a fourth opportunity in extra time, excluding substitutions made at half-time, before the start of extra time and at half-time in extra time.
