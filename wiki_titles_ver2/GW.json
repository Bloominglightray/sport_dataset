        "text": "The Washington Freedom is an American professional Twenty20 cricket team that competes in Major League Cricket (MLC). The team plans to be based in Washington, D.C. and was announced in 2023 as one of six inaugural franchises to play in Major League Cricket. The Freedom is owned by Indian American entrepreneur Sanjay Govil. The team is coached by Ricky Ponting and is captained by Moises Henriques.\nFranchise history.\nBackground.\nIn May 2022, Major League Cricket announced that it had secured $120 million from various investors across the United States. One of these investors was Sanjay Govil, who was later announced to be the lead investor and owner of the Washington DC-based franchise team. Alongside MLC, Govil partnered up with George Mason University to launch a feasibility study into a 12,000-seat hybrid cricket/baseball stadium later that year in December. The proposed stadium would host both cricket and baseball games and support up to 12,000 spectators upon its completion in summer 2025. George Mason University announced in March 2024 that it would not proceed with the stadium.\nIn February 2023, Major League Cricket announced that Govil had entered a partnership with Cricket New South Wales to help accelerate the growth of the DC-based franchise. The agreement included initiatives to further player development opportunities, as well as cricket content, within the U.S., an exchange program of coaches and support staff, and opportunities for NSW-based players to play in MLC. Cricket NSW chief executive Lee Germon stated that \"... he [Govil] was very keen to not have an IPL partner... [and wanted to] partner with someone outside who could really bring what we wanted to the table.\"\nIn March 2023, the team's name, the Washington Freedom, and logo were officially revealed to the public. Upon the unveiling of the team name and logo, Govil said that, \"the team's mark and colors are a perfect for a team from the nation's capital to compete on the global stage.\"\nSeason History.\n2023 season.\nThe Freedom had the second overall pick of the MLC's inaugural domestic draft and selected Thunderbolts vice-captain Andries Gous as their first draft pick. Dane Piedt, Mukhtar Ahmed, and Saad Ali were also all picked up by the team, with Sri Lanka international Wanindu Hasaranga (who later pulled out of the competition) and South African quick Anrich Nortje both being announced as direct signings during the draft. Marco Jansen, Glenn Phillips, and Adam Milne were all also announced as direct signings in May. The team then later announced it would be led by Sixers captain Moises Henriques. Shortly after, they announced that they had appointed Greg Shipperd as their head coach and Dale Steyn as their bowling coach. Later the following month, they announced Josh Philippe, Ben Dwarshuis, and Akeal Hosein all as additional direct signings. Tanveer Sangha was signed in the days leading up to the tournament as a replacement for Hasaranga, while Matthew Short was added to the squad as an injury replacement for Josh Philippe.\nFreedom's season started with a narrow defeat against Seattle Orcas, before they bounced back in the second fixture against Texas Super Kings, winning by six runs thanks to a fantastic all-round bowling display that backed up 80 off 50 balls from Matt Short.\nTwo more wins would follow against LA Knight Riders and San Francisco Unicorns, before a defeat at the hands of MI New York would see Freedom forced to settle for a place in the third v fourth Eliminator fixture in Finals week. The highlight of Freedom's group stage campaign came against the Unicorns, where Saurabh Netravalkar starred with an outstanding bowling performance, claiming 6-9 as Freedom successfully defended 133.\nSeasons.\nSeason summary.\nNote:"

        "text": "These collegiate women's bowling teams compete as members of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). As of the most recent 2022–23 season, 101 NCAA member schools sponsored the sport. The largest number of competing schools is found in Division II with 39; Division I has 37 and Division III has 25. The 2022–23 season was the last for two bowling-sponsoring schools. Division I St. Francis Brooklyn shut down its athletic program, and Division III Medaille closed entirely. The Medaille bowling team was effectively taken over by a nearby D-I school, Niagara, which added bowling for 2023–24, hired Medaille's former head coach, and took in many of that school's returning bowlers. Three other schools added bowling for 2023–24: D-I Bethune–Cookman (which reinstated the sport after a three-year absence) and Jacksonville State, plus D-II Oklahoma Christian. Unlike in most sports for which the NCAA holds championships, one bowling championship is held, open to members of all three divisions.\nCurrent teams.\nAs of the current 2023–24 NCAA bowling season, these schools sponsor a bowling team that is recognized by the NCAA. All institutions on this list are located within the United States. Conference affiliations reflect those for bowling, and do not necessarily match the schools' primary conferences."

International tennis bodies and many players opposed the ban, including the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) which decided not to award ranking points for Wimbledon results that year.\nBackground and the ban.\nRussia, with support from its ally Belarus, invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022. It quickly faced widespread international condemnation, including sanctions in the world of sport. On 1 March, the ATP and the WTA condemned the invasion and cancelled a joint tournament planned to be held in Moscow. The same day, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) cancelled all of its events planned to be held in Russia and suspended Russian and Belarusian players from participating in international competitions such as the Billie Jean King Cup, the Davis Cup, and the Olympic Games. However, Russians and Belarusians continued to be allowed to compete on tour and at Grand Slams as individual athletes without a national flag.\nOn 15 March, UK Sports Minister Nigel Huddleston stated in a parliamentary committee that \"nobody flying the flag for Russia should be allowed\" to play at Wimbledon (to be held 27 June to 10 July) and that any Russians seeking to participate should be required to declare their non-support for Putin. WTA CEO Steve Simon said there was no precedent to threaten to ban tennis players \"as the result of political positions their leadership may take\". Over the next month, the AELTC and the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) consulted with the Boris Johnson government over Russian participation in UK tennis events.\nOn 20 April, citing \"guidance set out by the UK Government\", the AELTC announced that Russian and Belarusian players would not be permitted to play at the upcoming Wimbledon Championships. AELTC chair Ian Hewitt said the decision was due to \"the high profile environment of The Championships, the importance of not allowing sport to be used to promote the Russian regime and our broader concerns for public and player (including family) safety\". The same day, the LTA announced that Russian and Belarusian players would be banned from all of its events, including the Eastbourne International and the Queen's Club Championships.\nReactions, stripping of ranking points.\nOpinion polling showed that the ban was \"broadly popular\" in the UK. Many Ukrainian players supported the ban, such as Alexandr Dolgopolov, Marta Kostyuk, Sergiy Stakhovsky, and Elina Svitolina. It was also supported by Nordic countries including Sweden, Iceland, Finland, and Norway.\nMany others in the tennis world criticized the AELTC for breaking with the consensus formed by the ITF, the ATP, the WTA, and the other three Grand Slam tournaments to allow Russians and Belarusians to compete as neutral athletes. The ATP and the WTA issued statements on 20 April 2022 opposing the ban as discriminatory, while continuing to condemn the invasion. Many current and former players spoke out against the ban, such as Novak Djokovic, Billie Jean King, John Millman, Andy Murray, Rafael Nadal, Martina Navratilova, and Alexander Zverev. Andrey Rublev, who was subject to the ban, called it \"complete discrimination\" and said he had hoped to find a workaround by offering to donate his prize money.\nOn 20 May 2022, in an \"unprecedented\" move, the ITF, the ATP, and the WTA announced that they would not award ITF Junior, ITF Wheelchair, ATP, nor WTA ranking points for results at Wimbledon because of the ban. However, ATP and WTA points were not excluded from Eastbourne and Queen's because, unlike during Wimbledon, there would remain opportunities for Russian and Belarusian players to compete the same week in non-UK events. The AELTC said it was disappointed by the decision to strip Wimbledon of ranking points, and some players considered the decision unfair, such as Andy Murray and Casper Ruud.\nOn 4 July 2022, the WTA applied fines of $750,000 to the AELTC and $250,000 to the LTA over the ban. Both appealed the fines. On 7 December 2022, the ATP fined the LTA $1 million over the ban.\nAftermath.\nThe ban applied to sixteen ATP or WTA singles players ranked within the top 100. Among the most prominent unable to compete were Russians Daria Kasatkina, Veronika Kudermetova, Daniil Medvedev, Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, and Rublev, and Belarusians Victoria Azarenka and Aryna Sabalenka. \nDespite the ban, the women's singles title was won by a player born in Russia: Elena Rybakina (who switched her nationality to Kazakhstan in 2018 due to a lack of Russian Tennis Federation support). Russian state media celebrated Rybakina's win as a national victory despite her longstanding decision not to represent the country of her birth. Additionally, the top 100 doubles player Natela Dzalamidze switched her nationality in June 2022 from Russia to Georgia to be able to play at Wimbledon and the Olympics; she reached the second round of Wimbledon women's doubles.\nThe absence of ranking points from Wimbledon was felt throughout the year. In the WTA rankings, Rybakina would have cracked the top 10 with her win, but instead stayed just outside the top 20; she said it was \"not the greatest\" that, despite being a major champion, she was not receiving a top 10 player's treatment with regard to court placement and match scheduling; and she lagged in the race for the WTA Finals, finishing as the year-end No. 22 instead of possibly No. 7 or higher. In the ATP rankings, men's singles champion Djokovic fell from No. 3 to No. 7 despite defending his title, and he faced a large gap in chasing eventual year-end No. 1 Carlos Alcaraz; with credit for Wimbledon, Djokovic would have ended up as the year-end No. 2, just 200 points from the top, instead of year-end No. 5. \nOther players in the list are Nick Kyrgios, the men's singles finalist, would have re-entered the ATP top 20 after the tournament, but instead ranked No. 40. Tatjana Maria, the women's singles semifinalist, would have entered the WTA top 40 for the first time in her career after the tournament, but remained steady at the top 100; and Jule Niemeier, the women's singles quarterfinalist, would have also entered the WTA top 60 for the first time, but she fell down slightly outside of top 100.\nIn December 2022, the AELTC was reported to be reconsidering the ban ahead of the 2023 Championships. On 31 March 2023, the AELTC rescinded the ban, announcing that Russians and Belarusians would be allowed to play if they refrain from expressing support for the invasion and sign statements attesting to their neutrality. The AELTC said on 25 April that players had begun signing the personal statements."

Despite cricket in Cambodia being relatively unknown, the sport was included in the games following lobbying from the Cricket Federation of Cambodia and the Asian Cricket Council.\nFour different formats of cricket were contested: 50 overs, 20 overs, 10 overs, and six-a-side. National teams were eligible to compete in up to three of the four formats (except for hosts Cambodia who entered all formats). Matches played in the T20 tournaments had full men's Twenty20 International or women's Twenty20 International status with ranking points on offer.\nDuring the games, the Malaysia Cricket Association complained about the organisation of the events, particularly the unseeded group stages and the lack of semi-finals, and questioned the eligibility of 13 members of Cambodia's men's squad.\nParticipants.\nThe Vietnam national cricket team withdrew after failing to secure government funding for its participation."

For his basketball playing career, McLaughlin reached the first round of the 1989 NAIA men's basketball tournament while at Holy Family College. From 1989 to 1992, he continued to play basketball with the Washington Generals. After becoming the women's basketball coach for Holy Family in 1995, McLaughlin's team were in the Elite Eight of the NAIA Division II Women's Basketball Championship four times from 1998 to 2002.\nAfter the NAIA school moved to the NCAA in 2003, McLaughlin and Holy Family reached the final of the Northeast Regional during the 2008 NCAA Division II women's basketball tournament.

        "text": "An All-American team is an honorary sports team composed of the best amateur players of a specific season for each team position—which in turn are given the honorific \"All-America\" and typically referred to as \"All-American athletes\", or simply \"All-Americans\". Although the honorees generally do not compete as a unit, the term is used in U.S. team sports to refer to players who national media members select. Walter Camp selected the first All-America team in the early days of American football in 1889. The 2023 NCAA Women's Basketball All-Americans are honorary lists that include All-American selections from the Associated Press (AP), the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA), and the Women's Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA) for the 2022–23 NCAA Division I women's basketball season. Both AP and USBWA choose three teams, while WBCA lists ten honorees.\nA consensus All-America team in women's basketball has never been organized. This differs from the practice in men's basketball, in which the NCAA uses a combination of selections by AP, USBWA, the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC), and \"Sporting News\" to determine a consensus All-America team. The selection of a consensus All-America men's basketball team is possible because all four organizations select at least a first and second team, with only the USBWA not selecting a third team.\nBefore the 2017–18 season, a consensus women's All-America team couldn't be determined because the AP had been the only body that divided its women's selections into separate teams. The USBWA first named different teams in 2017–18. The women's counterpart to the NABC, the Women's Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA), continues the USBWA's former practice of selecting a single 10-member (plus ties) team. \"Sporting News\" does not select an All-America team in women's basketball.\nBy selector.\nAssociated Press (AP).\nAnnounced on March 15, 2023. The teams are selected by the same 28-member media panel that votes on the AP poll during the season. Of note:\nAP Honorable Mention.\nHonorable mention selections are those who did not make one of the first three teams, but received at least one vote from the media panel.\nUnited States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA).\nThe USBWA announced its 15-member team, divided into first, second, and third teams, plus honorable mention selections, on March 15, 2023. Vote totals were not released.\nWomen's Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA).\nAnnounced on March 30, 2023.\nAcademic All-Americans.\nCollege Sports Communicators (known before the 2022–23 season as the College Sports Information Directors of America) announced its 2022 Academic All-America team on March 16, 2022, divided into first, second, and third teams, with Caitlin Clark of Iowa chosen as women's college basketball Academic All-American of the Year. Due to a tie for the fifth spot on the second team, the overall team had 16 members instead of the usual 15."

        "title": "Avantdale Bowling Club (album)",
        "text": "Avantdale Bowling Club is the debut album by Avantdale Bowling Club, a project fronted by New Zealand rapper Tom Scott. The album won the Taite Music Prize in 2019, and was recognised as Album of the Year at the 2019 New Zealand Music Awards. Commercially, it debuted at number one on the New Zealand albums chart.\nBackground.\nTom Scott began work on \"Avantdale Bowling Club\" while living in Melbourne, where he had moved after the dissolution of his previous band At Peace. The earliest track he wrote for the album, \"Pocket Lint\", was completed in 2014. The album builds on Scott's longtime interest in jazz, which stems from his jazz bassist father and his childhood exposure to jazz, funk, and soul music. While working on the album, Scott also listened to the work of Alice Coltrane and Pharoah Sanders.\nThe title \"Avantdale Bowling Club\" is a portmanteau, combining the term \"avant-garde\" with Scott's hometown of Avondale, Auckland.\nMusic.\n\"Avantdale Bowling Club\" is a jazz rap album on which Scott collaborates with a large group of musicians. Major contributors to the album include drummer Julien Dyne, pianist Guy Harrison, and producer Ben Lawson. Scott developed the album's tracks by putting together the basic melodies himself, before bringing the album's cast of musicians into the studio to fill out the arrangements. When writing the lyrics for the album, Scott eschewed the traditional hip hop format of sixteen-bar verses, instead writing lengthy verses to complement the album's jazz instrumentation. Addiction and parenthood have been identified as some of the most prevalent recurring themes on the record.\n\"Years Gone By\", the album's opening track and lead single, is an autobiographical song where Scott discusses the progression of his life from year to year. Scott has described the track \"F(r)iends\" as an \"ode\" to people he knows who struggle with drug addiction, including his parents and friends; the track also discusses the 2006 suicide of one of Scott's close friends. \"Home\" samples Chico Hamilton and has been characterised as \"the slow-burning... centrepiece of the album\", discussing Scott's experiences leaving and returning to New Zealand. \"Quincy's March\", named in honour of Scott's son, addresses Scott's thoughts and anxieties about parenthood. The final track, \"Tea Break\", is an instrumental song inspired by Scott's aunt and her battle with early onset dementia.\nScott has characterised \"Avantdale Bowling Club\" as a \"grown-up version\" of his work with the band Home Brew, and described the album's subject matter as follows: \nCritical reception.\n\"Avantdale Bowling Club\" received a positive reaction from critics. Karl Puschmann of \"The New Zealand Herald\" described it as a \"remarkable achievement\", and a 2019 profile of Scott stated that \"many regard [\"Avantdale Bowling Club\"] as his best album yet\". Critics particularly praised the album for being more mature and reflective than Scott's previous work, and spoke favorably about its ambitious scope.\nThe instrumentation on the album has been described as \"groove-orientated\" jazz with \"moody, street vibes\". It has also been praised as \"lush and beautiful\"."

        "text": "The 2023 NCAA Division I women's basketball championship game was the final game of the 2023 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament. It determined the national champion for the 2022–23 NCAA Division I women's basketball season and was contested by the Iowa Hawkeyes from the Big Ten Conference and the Louisiana State (LSU) Tigers from the Southeastern Conference. The game was played on April 2, 2023, at the American Airlines Center in Dallas, Texas. In the game, LSU defeated Iowa 102–85 to win their first national championship, setting a record for most points scored by a team in an NCAA women's basketball championship game. LSU's Angel Reese recorded a double-double and was voted the Most Outstanding Player (MOP) of the Final Four.\nLSU's victory gave them their first women's basketball national championship and the fourth in the head coaching career of Kim Mulkey. Much media attention was directed to Angel Reese for a taunting gesture made to Iowa's Caitlin Clark near the end of the game. LSU held a championship parade in Baton Rouge and were invited to the White House.\nThe championship game was televised on ABC and the broadcast broke numerous records, including the highest viewership for a women's college basketball game at 9.9 million; the semifinal game between Iowa and top-ranked South Carolina was itself the third-highest-viewed women's college basketball game in ESPN's history. It was also the most-viewed college sporting event ever shown on the ESPN+ streaming service, and the year-over-year viewership from the 2022 championship game more than doubled.\nParticipants.\nLSU Tigers.\nThe Tigers, representing Louisiana State University (LSU) in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, were led by second-year head coach Kim Mulkey for the 2022–23 season. LSU finished the regular season with a record of 27–1, and a conference record of 15–1. Their only loss during the regular season was an away game against South Carolina, ranked No. 1 by the AP Poll. They were seeded second in the SEC tournament, where they defeated Georgia before losing to Tennessee in the semifinals.\nLSU received an at-large invitation to the NCAA tournament and were placed in the Greenville Regional 2 as the No. 3 seed. As a top-four seed, LSU hosted first- and second-round games at their home arena, Pete Maravich Assembly Center. LSU faced No. 14 seed Hawaii in their first-round game, and won 73–50; the other game played in Baton Rouge saw No. 6 seed Michigan defeat No. 11 seed UNLV, setting up a second-round matchup between LSU and Michigan. Two days later, on March 19, LSU defeated Michigan 66–42 to advance to the regional semifinals. They traveled to Bon Secours Wellness Arena in Greenville, South Carolina, for their next game against No. 2 seed Utah, where they won by three points. This placed them into the regional final round, where they defeated No. 9 seed Miami to advance to their fifth Final Four and their first since 2008. There, they were matched up against Virginia Tech, the No. 1 seed from the Seattle Regional 3. The Tigers were favored to win the game by two points and ended up winning by seven to advance to the national championship game.\nIowa Hawkeyes.\nThe Hawkeyes, representing the University of Iowa in Iowa City, Iowa, were led by head coach Lisa Bluder in her 23rd season at the school. Ranked No. 4 in the AP preseason poll, they won their first three games of the season before suffering a loss to Kansas State. They participated in the Phil Knight Invitational tournament, where they defeated Oregon State but lost to No. 3 UConn and No. 12 NC State. They faced numerous other ranked teams throughout the season, with wins over No. 2 Ohio State, No. 8 Maryland, and No. 2 Indiana, and losses to No. 2 Indiana and No. 7 Maryland. They finished the regular season with a record of 23–6 and a conference record of 15–3. Caitlin Clark earned consensus national player of the year honors. The Hawkeyes received the No. 2 seed in the Big Ten tournament, where they defeated Purdue, Maryland, and Ohio State on consecutive days to win the conference championship.\nIowa received the Big Ten's automatic invitation to the NCAA tournament by virtue of their conference tournament championship and were selected as the No. 2 seed in the Seattle Regional 4. Like LSU, the Hawkeyes hosted first- and second- round games at their home arena, Carver–Hawkeye Arena in Iowa City, and they defeated No. 15 seed Southeastern Louisiana in their first-round game. The other first-round game played in Iowa City saw No. 10 seed Georgia defeat No. 7 seed Florida State, and Iowa defeated Georgia by eight points in the second round to advance to the regional semifinal. There, they faced and defeated No. 6 seed Colorado at Climate Pledge Arena in Seattle, and took down No. 5 seed Louisville in a game whose viewership bested any \"NBA on ESPN\" broadcast during the 2022–23 season to reach the Final Four of the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1993. They won 77–73 over defending national champion South Carolina, who were undefeated at 36–0, to reach the final; the game was widely viewed as an upset since South Carolina were \"heavy favorites\" not only to defeat Iowa but also to repeat as national champions. Further, the ESPN broadcast of the game drew 5.5 million viewers and set records as the most-watched NCAA semifinal and third-most-viewed women's college basketball game in ESPN's history.\nGame summary.\nLSU won the opening tip, but Iowa scored the game's first point with a two-point field goal from Monika Czinano. LSU's Flau'jae Johnson gave the Tigers their first lead seconds later with a three-point field goal, though Iowa took it back with shots made by Kate Martin and Caitlin Clark. The teams traded baskets and tied at 9–9 and 12–12 before a three-pointer by Kateri Poole and a free throw by Angel Reese put LSU in front by four points. The game was tied again shortly thereafter with back-to-back three pointers from Clark and a two-point jumper from Alexis Morris; a pair of free throws for each team tied it again at 20 points apiece with under three minutes remaining. With under a minute remaining, LSU took their largest lead of the quarter—five points—after Jasmine Carson made a three-point jumper, and the quarter ended with LSU maintaining this lead; the score was 27–22 in favor of the Tigers.\nIowa regained the lead two minutes into the second quarter; three-pointers from Gabbie Marshall and Martin brought the deficit within one point and a layup by Hannah Stuelke put Iowa in front. LSU retook the lead within a minute and expanded it to seven points with three-pointers made by Carson and Last-Tear Poa. Free throws and layups allowed Iowa to make up some of the deficit, but back-to-back three-point shots by Carson pushed LSU's lead to as many as thirteen points with four minutes until halftime. After a layup by Marshall, the score remained 49–38 for nearly a minute until Iowa's McKenna Warnock made a free throw. Poa's three-pointer immediately afterwards bumped the Tigers' lead back to thirteen, and the teams traded jumpers until the final thirty seconds of the half, when Johnson scored a layup and a turnover by Martin led to a three-pointer by Carson with one second remaining. LSU led at halftime by a score of 59–42.\nLSU built on to their lead by scoring the first four points of the second half through LaDazhia Williams and Reese. A three-pointer by Clark with 7:56 remaining started a run for Iowa that saw the Hawkeyes score twelve consecutive points, which cut LSU's lead from 21 points down to nine. The lead narrowed further after Clark made another three-pointer with 5:22 to play, and back-to-back layups by the Tigers were followed by a Clark three-pointer that kept the deficit at nine points. Both teams traded field goals for the next two minutes; a pair of free throws by Morris with 1:03 on the clock ended up being the final points scored before the end of the third quarter. Iowa outscored LSU by six points in the third quarter, and trailed 75–64 entering the fourth.\nIowa scored the first five points of the fourth quarter, cutting LSU's lead to eight points, before two jumpers by Morris and a layup by Williams pushed it to 14. Two free throws by Czinano and a layup by Warnock for Iowa were countered by a layup by Reese and a jumper by Morris for LSU, leaving the Tigers' lead at 14. Clark's three-pointer with 5:21 remaining shrunk LSU's lead to 13 points, though a jump shot by Morris just under a minute later bumped their lead to 16 points. Clark and Williams traded layups, and a jumper by Morris with under two minutes left made the score 95–82. After a pair of fouls on Iowa, Poole made a three-pointer to extend the lead to sixteen points. Carson then made one of her two free throws with 53 seconds remaining to make the score 99–82. Martin scored Iowa's final points with a three-pointer assisted by Molly Davis, and the game's final points were scored on a three-pointer by Morris with 27 seconds remaining to push the score to 102–85. Marshall attempted a three-pointer for the Hawkeyes with 15 seconds left, but she missed and a rebound by Williams allowed LSU to run out the clock and secure the 17-point victory for their first national championship in program history.\nReese was named the Most Outstanding Player (MOP) of the Final Four; she finished the championship game with a double-double, scoring 15 points and securing 10 rebounds, and tallied a season-high five assists. She was named to the all-tournament team alongside teammates Morris and Carson, Iowa's Clark, and Zia Cooke of South Carolina. Clark, the consensus National Player of the Year, led all scorers with 30 points and set a record with 191 total points over the course of the tournament. The game set several offensive and scoring records: LSU's 102 total points were the fourth-most they had scored in a game during the season and the most that had ever been scored in an NCAA Division I women's championship game; Iowa's 85 points also marked the most points ever scored by the losing team in a women's championship game. Additionally, LSU's 59 points in the first half marked a new NCAA women's championship game record.\nLSU head coach Kim Mulkey became the first coach to win a Division I women's basketball national championship as the head coach at two different schools with the victory; she won three during her tenure as the head coach at Baylor from 2000 to 2021.\nThe next night, Reese's cousin Jordan Hawkins helped the University of Connecticut win its fifth men's title in school history.\nMedia coverage.\nThe championship game was televised in the United States by ABC, with Ryan Ruocco on play-by-play commentary, Rebecca Lobo as the analyst, and Holly Rowe and Andraya Carter as sideline reporters. The broadcast broke several records including the largest-ever viewership for a women's college basketball game, with 9.9 million viewers and a peak viewership of 12.6 million. This marked an increase in viewership of 103% from the championship game the year prior (which was televised exclusively by ESPN in primetime), and was also the most-viewed college sporting event ever shown on the ESPN+ streaming service.\nThe records broken by this game were consistent with a larger trend in women's basketball and women's sports more broadly: the WNBA saw a 16% increase in viewership during its 2022 season—its most-watched in 14 years—compared to the season before.\nAftermath.\nIn the immediate aftermath of the game, much attention was directed to a gesture made by Angel Reese towards Caitlin Clark. Near the end of the fourth quarter, Reese was seen making a gesture that involved moving her hand in front of her face, a taunt popularized by John Cena, before pointing to her ring finger in an allusion to a championship ring. These taunts drew criticism from some journalists and analysts, but Reese later defended the gesture and remarked on a similar gesture made by Clark to an opponent during Iowa's regional final game against Louisville.\nThe backlash Reese (who is Black) received on social media—the term \"classless\" trended on Twitter shortly after the end of the game—prompted some to point out a potential double standard as Clark (who is white) received no similar backlash for her similar actions, instead receiving praise from Cena himself for the move and her performance in that game. Reese said that the criticism was tied to her identity and that she was considered \"too hood\" and \"too ghetto\" to \"fit the narrative.\"\nLSU held a championship parade in Baton Rouge on April 5; the parade route ended at their home arena, Pete Maravich Assembly Center. A celebration inside the arena took place afterwards. Following the game, First Lady Jill Biden commended Iowa for their sportsmanship and praised both teams on their play. She remarked that she wanted Iowa to be invited to the White House along with LSU, as an addition to the custom of the president and first lady hosting the national champions. This comment drew ire from several people, including Reese, Alexis Morris, ESPN host Stephen A. Smith, and Representative Troy Carter, and the matter was clarified the following day by Biden's press secretary, Vanessa Valdivia, who said that LSU would be the only team invited to the White House celebration. Reese remarked that she would decline the invitation, and said that she would rather visit the Obama family instead of the Bidens, though she ultimately attended the White House visit alongside the rest of the team on May 26, 2023."

        "title": "Beast Boxing 3D",
        "text": "Beast Boxing 3D was a 2010 indie boxing video game developed by Goodhustle Studios and released for iOS mobile devices. The player takes the role of Char, a human female boxer who seeks to become the champion of the Beast Boxing Leagues. A remake titled Beast Boxing Turbo was released for macOS, Ouya, and Windows. \"Beast Boxing Turbo\" was delisted from Steam in 2019 following the closure of Goodhustle Studios.\nPlot.\nChar, a human female boxer from the slums, seeks to become the champion of the Beast Boxing Leagues; boxing leagues for monsters. Humans are looked down upon by monsters and aren't allowed into the leagues, thus she begins her boxing career by entering the leagues in a monster costume. Char is coached by Piglas, a pig monster aware that she's a human. Char defeats the champions of the Bush League, Pro League, and Ultra League. After Char defeats Darbech, the reigning champion of the Ultra League, he is revealed to also be a human in disguise.\nGameplay.\nIn \"Beast Boxing\", the player takes the role of Char, a human female boxer who aspires to become the champion of the Beast Boxing Leagues. To win a match, the player must win by knockout two out of three rounds with their opponent. The player must defeat the champions of the Bush League, Pro League, and Ultra League, ultimately becoming the reigning champion of the Ultra League. \"Beast Boxing 3D\" has nine opponents with two additional ones added in later updates, while \"Beast Boxing Turbo\" has twelve. The player can deliver hooks by moving left or right while punching; \"Beast Boxing 3D\" uses swipe controls to perform different types of punches, and moving around the ring is controlled by tilting the device through accelerometer-based motion controls. Jabs are quick, while hooks and uppercuts deal more damage but take longer to swing. The guard meter shows how likely an opponent is to block against attacks, represented by a boxing glove icon below their portrait being up or down. Opponents block moves more often if the player uses them repetitively, requiring the player to use different strategies. Piglas gives the player advice throughout each fight.\nBoth attacking and blocking use power, which can also be depleted by being hit. Running out of power causes fatigue, causing the player to lose their streak progress and temporarily move more slowly. The player's streak meter increases with each hit delivered to the opponent, but is lost if the player is hit or their power is depleted. Upon reaching maximum streak, the player temporarily gains unlimited power and deals more damage with each hit. By attacking and not being hit, the player can build up a combo. Health regenerates slowly over time, except for damage marked in red, which is restored in the following round.\nCoins are awarded after each match, and previously beaten opponents can be refought in exhibition matches. Coins may be used to buy permanent stat upgrades and armor. Temporary power-ups, such as the ability to slow down time and health boosts, can be purchased and used in fights; this is absent in \"Beast Boxing Turbo\". In \"Beast Boxing Turbo\", New Game+ is unlocked after completing story mode, causing enemies to be stronger while retaining the player's gear and stat upgrades. In Endless mode, the player attempts to defeat as many opponents as possible without losing a fight, with scores going on an online leaderboard.\nDevelopment.\nThe prototype of \"Beast Boxing 3D\" was initially titled \"Monster Boxing\". \"Beast Boxing 3D\" was announced in February 2010, and was released on October 28, 2010, for iOS. \"Beast Boxing 3D\" was originally released with nine different opponents, and additional holiday-themed opponents were added in later updates. The game's Endless gamemode was also added in an update.\n\"Beast Boxing Turbo\" was greenlit on Steam Greenlight, and was released on Steam in October 2013. \"Beast Boxing Turbo\" was delisted from Steam on March 29, 2019, due to the closure of Goodhustle Studios.\nGordon Luk, the designer of \"Beast Boxing\", described \"Beast Boxing Turbo\" as \"a complete redesign\" of \"Beast Boxing 3D\" rather than a port, stating that he used \"two years of player feedback to eliminate things that weren't fun and replace them with improved game design and feel\". \"Turbo\" adds an additional three holiday-themed opponents between the Pro League and Ultra League (including two previously added in updates to \"Beast Boxing 3D\"), as well as a New Game+ mode, new artwork, mechanics, and story. In \"Beast Boxing 3D\", Char is revealed to be a woman at the end of the game, rather than from the beginning as with \"Turbo\"; Luk stated that this change \"made the story better, and it was easier to identify with the protagonist if the audience was in on her secret from the beginning\".\n\"Beast Boxing\" was inspired by \"Punch-Out!!\", \"Zeno Clash\", and \"Hajime No Ippo\".\nReception.\nMany reviewers favorably compared \"Beast Boxing\" to \"Punch-Out!!\". Reviews praised \"Beast Boxing's\" visuals, with several reviews noting the game's animations as 'smooth'. \"AppSpy\" praised \"Beast Boxing 3D's\" \"intuitive\" gameplay, as well as its \"gorgeous\" visuals, calling its animations \"smooth\" and describing the level of detail as \"simply stunning\". \"148Apps\" praised the game's AI and controls, and described the game's opponents as being \"extremely detailed with smooth animations\". \"Gizmodo\" stated that the game \"oozes style\".\n\"Pocket Gamer\" described \"Beast Boxing 3D's\"' gameplay as \"intuitive and addictive\", and praised its \"incredibly detailed\" graphics and \"beautifully fluid animation[s]\" \"Gamezebo\" was more critical, stating that \"despite giving the impression of depth, there really isn't much to the fighting action at all, besides hammering two buttons over and over\", criticizing its gameplay as brief and shallow but praised its \"great visuals\". \"Slide To Play\" summarized the game as having \"excellent controls, [a] fun upgrade system, and eye-catching graphics\", further calling it \"an impressive game on many levels\", but criticized the game's brevity. \"TouchArcade\" called it \"an absolutely gorgeous game\", praising the game's need for combos and strategy due to the game's AI, expressing that the AI adapting to the player's moves gives the game a \"natural feel that increases the replay value\".\n\"Macworld\" praised \"Beast Boxing 3D's\" gameplay, calling it \"wonderfully executed\" and stating that it has \"great use of touch controls\".\n\"The Mary Sue\" noted Char as a good example of positive female representation in games, and praised the game's focus on combos and strategy, stating that \"The reason \"Beast Boxing Turbo\" will appeal to women who already like boxing games is because \"it's a good boxing game\"\"."

While the Chiefs weren't expected to win many games, the stronger competition could allow the team to build itself into a respectable outfit by season's end. From the start, however, it was clear that Devens had some work to do. The team lost its opening game 1–10 but saw a swift turnaround when the fell to MIT by just a single goal. The Chiefs continued their ascent in the third game and held the lead over Boston College after the first period. While the couldn't hold the lead, the team had at least proved they could put up a fight.\nFort Devens was able to post its first win of the season just before the winter break and then notched their second victory once they returned. With the team suddenly in the midst of a playoff hunt, Devens' offense flagged in January and the team went through an extended losing skid. The lowest game for the club came against Harvard where the Chiefs were thoroughly dominated 2–17. The game was also notable for being very physical with many penalties handed out while several players were taken off the ice due to injury. The team managed to get one more win before ending the season by being shutout by BC.\nDespite the lackluster play in as the year went on, Fort Devens had found a diamond in the rough as Hal Downes was credited with stellar play throughout the season.

He later served as the first president and executive director of the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\nJournalism.\nMcCann was born and raised in Washington, D.C. He studied at a seminary in Beacon, New York before deciding to go into journalism. He began his newspaper career in 1927 in his hometown. He was a court and police reporter as well as a sports columnist for \"The Washington Herald\", \"The Washington Star\", and the \"Washington Daily News\". \nIn 1934, McCann married Mary Runyon, the daughter of writer Damon Runyon. She gave birth to their son later that year. Mary Runyon McCann was declared incompetent in 1947 and placed under the care of a court-appointed guardian. She spent much of her life in institutionalized care.\nIn 1937, McCann joined the Newspaper Enterprise Association in Cleveland. The following year he went to work for King Features Syndicate in New York City. Here, McCann also worked in public relations, including for the committee for the celebration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's birthday and for boxing manager Mike Jacobs. While in New York, McCann also wrote for the \"Daily News\". He served in the United States Navy during World War II. He returned to D.C. in 1945, taking over Vincent X. Flaherty's sports column in the \"Washington Times-Herald\".\nWashington Redskins.\nOn September 14, 1946, McCann became the publicity director for the Washington Redskins. He was promoted to general manager on April 30, 1947. The Redskins complied a 64–111 record in McCann's 15 seasons as general manager. They had only three winning seasons and made no playoff appearances during that time. The Redskins also fought against racial integration, not signing their first black player until 1962 and only then under pressure from the federal government, which threatened to block the use of D.C. Stadium, which they owned.\nPro Football Hall of Fame.\nOn April 3, 1962, McCann was selected over two other finalists, Bud Erickson and Bill Edwards, to become the Pro Football Hall of Fame's first director. He supervised construction of the Hall, the collection of football memorabilia, and the election of the first seventeen charter members. On September 7, 1963, the Pro Football Hall of Fame opened to the public. He led the Hall of Fame until his death on November 5, 1967. He was survived by his second wife, Alva, and his son Richard.\nIn 1969, the Professional Football Writers of America created the Dick McCann Memorial Award to honor a reporter for their outstanding contribution to pro football. In 2021, it was renamed the Bill Nunn Award due to McCann's association with the Redskins' segregationist policies."

        "title": "The Freshies (basketball)",
        "text": "The Freshies were the 2019 recruiting class of the South Carolina Gamecocks women's basketball program. They were the number one recruiting class of the 2019–20 NCAA Division I season and played together until 2023. Developed under head coach Dawn Staley, they helped South Carolina win the 2022 national championship and reach the Final Four in all three NCAA tournaments they competed in. The class also won four Southeastern Conference (SEC) regular season titles and three SEC tournament titles, finishing with a 129–9 record over four years.\nThe Freshies were led by forward Aliyah Boston, who was named national player of the year and NCAA tournament Most Outstanding Player as a junior in 2021–22. Boston, with guards Zia Cooke and Brea Beal, started for South Carolina since their freshman season in 2019–20. Forward Laeticia Amihere was a key bench player and guard Olivia Thompson was a former walk-on who received limited playing time.\nConsidered one of the most accomplished recruiting classes in women's college basketball history, the Freshies helped transform South Carolina into the most dominant team in the nation. After four years, none of its members opted to return for a fifth season of eligibility. In the 2023 WNBA draft, Boston was the first overall pick, and Cooke, Beal and Amihere were selected later in the draft.\nBackground.\nAfter the departure of star player A'ja Wilson in the previous season, South Carolina entered a rebuilding stage under head coach Dawn Staley in the 2018–19 season. The team finished the season with a 23–10 record and lost in the Sweet 16 of the 2019 NCAA tournament, and its team culture came under scrutiny. Entering the 2019–20 season, they lost several key players from the 2018–19 team, including top scorer Te'a Cooper. In August 2018, guard Olivia Thompson became the first member of the 2019 South Carolina recruiting class after accepting a walk-on offer. In November, the Gamecocks received commitments from four top recruits in the 2019 class: guards Zia Cooke and Brea Beal, and forwards Laeticia Amihere and Aliyah Boston. All four were ranked top-11 in their class by ESPN at the end of their high school careers. They were the number one recruiting class in the nation and one of the best in history. Boston, Cooke and Beal were named McDonald's All-Americans, and only Stanford had as many players receive the honor. After all members of the class signed with South Carolina, they created a group chat named \"The Freshies\" due to their freshman status. They kept the nickname after their freshman year.\nCareer.\nAs freshmen in 2019–20, Boston, Cooke and Beal immediately entered the starting lineup for South Carolina. Boston assumed a leading role, standing out as a rebounder and defender. Cooke was one of the team's primary scorers, while Beal served as a defensive specialist, often guarding the opponents' best player. Amihere came off the bench and was recovering from knee injuries from high school in her first season. Thompson had a limited role but remained a fan favorite, as a Lexington, South Carolina native who had grown up supporting the Gamecocks, and earned a scholarship before her sophomore year. They achieved a 32–1 record and finished as the AP No. 1 team for the first time in program history, while winning SEC regular season and tournament titles and going undefeated in conference play. The 2020 NCAA tournament was canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic, declared \"de facto\" named mythical national champions through the football-style polls which the team was given a championship banner at Colonial Life Arena for the equivalent of a newspaper decision. In the 2020–21 season, South Carolina won the SEC tournament. They reached the Final Four of the 2021 NCAA tournament and finished with a 26–5 record.\nThe Freshies helped acclimate South Carolina's top-ranked 2021 recruiting class, nicknamed \"The Birdies\", which included Raven Johnson, Sania Feagin and Bree Hall. The 2021–22 team won the SEC regular season title and were ranked No. 1 in the AP Poll for the entire season, with a 34–2 record. They won the program's second national championship, and Boston was named national player of the year and NCAA tournament Most Outstanding Player. In the 2022–23 season, the Freshies led South Carolina to its first undefeated regular season, as well as SEC regular season and tournament titles and its third consecutive Final Four. They were the wire-to-wire AP No. 1 team for a second straight season and achieved a 36–1 record.\nAftermath.\nThe Freshies led South Carolina to a 129–9 record, including 60–1 at home, over four years. Jeremiah Holloway of \"The State\" described the Freshies as one of the most accomplished recruiting classes in women's college basketball history, crediting them with South Carolina's dominance from 2019 to 2023. Head coach Dawn Staley credits them with improving the culture of the program.\nFollowing their senior season, all members of the Freshies opted to end their college careers, despite having a fifth season of eligibility granted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the 2023 WNBA draft, Boston was selected first overall by the Indiana Fever, Amihere was the eighth pick to the Atlanta Dream and Cooke was the 10th pick to the Los Angeles Sparks. It was the first time that three seniors from the same team were selected in the first round since Notre Dame in 2019. Beal was chosen by the Minnesota Lynx with the 24th pick."

His brother, Ben, played college football at Bemidji State. Johnson attended Spring Lake Park High School and was a three-year varsity letter winner in football, while additionally playing hockey. In football, he played at offensive tackle, defensive tackle and placekicker, earning as a senior Associated Press third-team all-state honors, as well as \"Star Tribune\" second-team all-metro.

He appeared in a total of eight games on the season.\nJohnson became a full-time starter at right tackle as a sophomore in 2017, a position he held for the rest of his college career. He started all 15 games and helped NDSU set a school record in rushing yards, being named honorable mention all-conference as they went on to win the national championship. In 2018, he again started every game, allowing only two sacks as North Dakota State won another national championship. Johnson was named an FCS All-American and a first-team All-Missouri Valley Football Conference (MVFC) selection for his performance.\nAs a senior in 2019, Johnson moved to right guard and started all 16 games, only allowing one sack while helping NDSU win their third-straight national championship.

Egypt is not a member of the IIHF and does not have a national ice hockey governing body, but has competed internationally including at the 2023 Arab Cup. Currently, as there is no official National Egyptian Ice Hockey team the unofficial group of players from youth to adult generally compete under the private moniker entitled Egypt Ice Hockey. \nHistory.\nIce hockey in Egypt was first played recreationally in 2002 at the Maadi Family Land Ice Rink in Cairo. Beginning in 2016, an unofficial club team representing Egypt, the Pharaohs, has played against other club teams in the region, including at the 2018 and 2020 Arab Club Championship. The Pharaohs also competed in and won Division II of the 2022 Amerigol LATAM Cup, a tournament for teams mostly from Latin America and the Caribbean. The team is often registered as the Egypt Ice Hockey Club. A preliminary membership group consisting of managing members aiming to increase ice hockey exposure in Egypt was appointed officially by the Egyptian Olympic Committee which is an extension of the cabinet level Egyptian government. No official federation has been registered and no full sized IIHF approved rink exists in Egypt today. \nEgypt's first game as an official national team was at the 2023 Arab Cup in Kuwait, where they lost to Oman 9–4. The second game against the eventual Arab Cup champion, Lebanon, was their biggest international loss (7–0). Egypt's third game was supposed to be against Saudi Arabia, but their opposition was unofficially represented at the tournament by Jeddah Eagles. Jeddah Eagles still played their scheduled game against Egypt on 10 May 2023, resulting the club lose 7–0. However, the Egyptian national team's win against club or \"B\" team did not count towards Egypt's official international record.\nCurrent roster.\nRoster for the 2023 Arab Cup of Ice Hockey.\nHead coach: Yasser Ahmed"

The Giro began in Fossacesia on 6 May, and Stage 11 occurred on 17 May with a stage to Tortona. The race finished in Rome on 28 May.\nRest day 1.\nShortly after the Stage 9 time trial, stage winner and overall general classification leader Remco Evenepoel tested positive for COVID-19 and was forced to withdraw from the race. While by tradition, when a leader pulls out through injury after the completion of the stage, the new 'leader' does not take on the jersey until the end of the following stage, the rest day in grand tours is treated as a stage for those purposes. As such, at the completion of the rest day, Geraint Thomas would become the new maglia rosa, and will wear pink when the race resumes at the beginning of Tuesday morning.\nThe new general classifications standings would become as follows:\nStage 10.\nNine riders, including Evenepoel, Domenico Pozzovivo, Stefan Kung and Rigoberto Uran did not start the race after the rest day, Evenepoel announcing such on Sunday evening, releasing the maglia rosa for Geraint Thomas to wear. Top-10 rider and GC contender Aleksandr Vlasov abandoned the race midway through the stage, while fellow top-10 rider Jay Vine crashed and lost over ten minutes to the maglia rosa group.\nStage 11.\nThe stage was marked by further abandonments. Four members of the Soudal Quickstep team tested positive for Covid-19, three days after team leader Remco Evenepoel left the race after a positive test. A crash on a wet descent late in the stage took out many of the leaders, with Thomas, Roglic, Sivikov and Geoghegen Hart all brought down. while maglia rosa Thomas and his closest rival Roglic remounted and rejoined the peloton, third place Geoghegen Hart was forced to abandon and go to hospital where he was diagnosed with a broken hip, while top ten teammate Pavel Sivakov managed to remount, but lost 13 minutes, effectively ending any perceived challenge. \nExternal links.\nOfficial site: https://www.giroditalia.it/en/"

        "title": "2023 Fairleigh Dickinson vs. Purdue men's basketball game",
        "text": "On March 17, 2023, during the first round of the 2023 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, the Purdue University Boilermakers played a college basketball game against the Fairleigh Dickinson University (Fairleigh Dickinson, also FDU) Knights at the Nationwide Arena in Columbus, Ohio. The Boilermakers, who were seeded first in the East regional bracket and fourth overall in the NCAA tournament, faced the Knights, who were seeded 16th in the East regional bracket and 68th, or last, overall.\nThe Knights defeated the Boilermakers 63–58, becoming the first No. 16 seed out of the First Four to defeat a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, and the second 16-seed overall after UMBC's win over Virginia in 2018. It is also just the third time a 16-seed has beaten a 1-seed in college basketball overall, after No. 16 seeded Harvard defeated overall No. 1 Stanford in the women's tournament twenty-five years earlier. As a result, the Knights made it to the round of 32 for the first time in school history and became the first Northeast Conference team to win in the round of 64. With Purdue set as a -point favorite heading into the game, Fairleigh Dickinson's victory was the biggest upset in terms of point spread in NCAA tournament history. Purdue ended their season at 29–6, while Fairleigh Dickinson improved to 21–15.\nBackground.\nAt the start of this game, NCAA tournament No. 16 seeds were 1–150 all-time against No. 1 seeds since the tournament field expanded to 64 teams in 1985. Five years prior to this game, the UMBC Retrievers became the first No. 16 seed to defeat a No. 1 seed, 74–54, over the Virginia Cavaliers.\nFairleigh Dickinson.\nFairleigh Dickinson entered its 2022–23 season under first-year head coach Tobin Anderson. A preseason Northeast Conference (NEC) coaches' poll picked the Knights to finish tied for sixth in their league. The Knights' roster was especially notable for its small physical size—averaging barely over , with two starting guards being under , it was the smallest in NCAA Division I men's basketball that season. In the years since the analytics website \"kenpom.com\" began tracking average heights of D-I men's rosters in the 2006–07 season, only one other roster had a shorter average height (Grambling State in 2009–10). The team completed the regular season with a 19–15 record and a second-place finish in the NEC.\nAs the No. 2 seed in the NEC Tournament, they defeated St. Francis Brooklyn and Saint Francis (PA) to advance to the championship game against Merrimack. Because Merrimack was in the last season of a four-year transition period from Division II to Division I, the Knights received the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament, despite losing the conference championship game to Merrimack 66–67.\nIn the First Four, Fairleigh Dickinson defeated Texas Southern 84–61 to advance to the first round. After the game, Anderson said to the team in the locker room, \"The more I watch Purdue, the more I think we can beat them.\"\nPurdue.\nPurdue entered its 2022–23 season under 18th-year head coach Matt Painter. Purdue had entered the season unranked but proceeded to win the Big Ten Conference regular season championship outright by three games. Junior center Zach Edey was named the conference's Player of the Year, \"Sporting News\" Player of the Year, and a consensus first-team All-American. In the Big Ten Tournament, they defeated Rutgers, Ohio State, and Penn State, winning the tournament and finishing with a regular season record of 29–5. Purdue entered the tournament seeded fourth overall. As a result, Purdue would face the winner of the First Four match between Fairleigh Dickinson and Texas Southern. Fairleigh Dickinson won the game, 84–61, and would move on to face Purdue. Purdue entered the game the heavy favorite to win, favored by 23.5 points.\nVenue.\nThe game was played at the Nationwide Arena in Columbus, Ohio. The attendance for the game was 19,564.\nBroadcast.\nThe game was televised nationally on TNT and announced by Andrew Catalon, Steve Lappas, and Jamie Erdahl. The game was played before the start of the Florida Atlantic–Memphis game, which took place in the same venue. The game drew 4.37 million viewers.\nGame summary.\nFairleigh Dickinson started the game off with a 5–2 lead, after a Sean Moore three-pointer. Purdue would then go on a 5–0 run to take a 7–5 lead at the first media timeout. The two teams would continue to trade the lead, as the Knights would end up being within one score or having the lead for the first 15 minutes, and a Demetre Roberts three-pointer gave Fairleigh Dickinson a six-point lead, their largest of the half. However, an 11–0 Purdue run gave the Boilermakers a five-point lead with five minutes left in the half. Fairleigh Dickinson forced eight turnovers in the first half, including one off a full-court press near the end of the half leading to a Heru Bligen layup that gave the Knights a 32–29 lead, but Purdue’s Braden Smith hit two free throws at the end of the half to make it 32–31.\nAfter halftime, Fairleigh Dickinson would outscore Purdue 7–5, before the first media timeout of the half, taking a three-point lead. The Knights would extend the lead to five, before an 11–0 Purdue run gave them their largest lead of the game. Fairleigh Dickinson, down by six points, went on their own 8–0 run to reclaim the lead, before a Zach Edey tip shot tied the game at 49–49. At the eight-minute mark, an Edey free throw would give Purdue a 50–49 lead, their last of the game. After a Fletcher Loyer three-pointer with 7:09 left, the game would remain deadlocked with FDU leading 54–53 until a pair of Moore free throws with 2:50 left. After a Purdue timeout, Edey mishandled the inbounds catch, leading to a Moore layup for a Fairleigh Dickinson five-point lead with 1:26 to play. The Boilermakers would respond with a Loyer three-pointer, only for Moore to hit his own three for a 61–56 Knights lead. On the next possession, Purdue would draw a foul, and Loyer made both free throws to make it a one score game. After a missed opportunity, Purdue had a chance to tie the game, but instead Smith opted to try for a layup that was blocked by Moore. However, Purdue would get another offensive opportunity to tie the game, but Loyer's three-point try was an airball and the Boilermakers were forced to foul with seven seconds left. After two made free throws by Roberts, Fairleigh Dickinson would take a five-point lead and would go on to win 63–58.\nMoore, a Columbus native, scored a team-high 19 points in the Knights' upset, while Edey scored 21 points and grabbed 15 rebounds in a losing effort for the Boilermakers.\nBox score.\nSource:\nAftermath and Near Redemption.\nIn its immediate aftermath, the game was considered possibly the biggest upset in tournament history, mainly owing to Fairleigh Dickinson's significant underdog status; besides being the largest upset of all time by point spread, Fairleigh Dickinson had entered the tournament as the 68th and last-ranked team overall, and it had received the Northeast Conference's automatic bid despite losing the conference championship game (champion Merrimack was ineligible due to its transition from Division II). FDU's 2022–23 strength of schedule ranked 363rd and last in Division I according to \"KenPom.com\"; also, as noted previously, FDU's roster per \"KenPom.com\" was the shortest overall in Division I, and defeated a team with all-American center Zach Edey, who was one of the tallest players in college basketball at 7 feet 4 inches.\nPurdue became the first team in tournament history to lose in consecutive years to 15-seeds or worse, having previously been eliminated by 15-seed Saint Peter's in the Sweet 16 of the 2022 tournament; additionally, the Boilermakers had been eliminated in the first round of the 2021 tournament by 13-seed North Texas.\nFairleigh Dickinson advanced to the Round of 32, in which it faced the 9-seed Florida Atlantic Owls on March 19, 2023. It was competitive throughout the majority of the game, and the Knights led throughout the first ten minutes of the second half. However, the Owls won the game 78–70, thus ending FDU's two-game Cinderella run. Florida Atlantic then went on a Cinderella run of their own, defeating No. 4 seed Tennessee 62–55 in the Sweet 16 and No. 3 seed Kansas State 79–76 in the Elite Eight to become the second 9-seed to advance to the Final Four since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985. The Owls' season ended with a 72–71 loss to San Diego State after the Aztecs' Lamont Butler hit a jump shot at the buzzer.\nTwo days after the Knights' loss to Florida Atlantic, head coach Tobin Anderson announced his departure from FDU after just one year to accept the head coaching position at Iona, which had its head coaching spot recently vacated by Rick Pitino, who departed after three seasons to coach at St. John's.\nThe first-round loss by East No. 1 seed Purdue, second-round loss by West No. 1 seed Kansas, and Sweet Sixteen losses by South No. 1 seed Alabama and Midwest No. 1 seed Houston, led to the 2023 tournament becoming the first ever to not advance any of its top seeds to the Elite Eight. \nBefore the game, CBSSports.com reported there were 22 perfect brackets left in their March Madness tournament. After Purdue's loss however, it was reported that there were no longer any perfect brackets remaining, only two days after the tournament started.\nIn 2024, the Boilermakers again entered the NCAA Tournament as a #1 seed, showcasing a strong resurgence from the prior year's setback. Similar to Virginia, the previous #1 seed to lose to a #16 seed in an NCAA Tournament, Purdue was able to make a run that culminated in a highly anticipated National Championship game appearance. Despite their best efforts at redemption similar to that of Virginia, however, Purdue would ultimately lose in that year's championship game to the defending champions, the UConn Huskies, with a final score of 75–60. Coincidentally, this became the second time a #1 seed that was upset by a #16 seed would subsequently make it all the way to the final round of an NCAA Tournament the following year afterward."

Vanuatu won the series 2–0.\nVanuatu progressed to the global qualifier by remaining unbeaten throughout the tournament. Vanuatu all-rounder Rachel Andrew was named player of the tournament and batter of the tournament, while her teammate 16-year-old Vanessa Vira was named bowler of the tournament."

The top two teams from each pool automatically qualify for the top eight knockout stage, beginning with the quarterfinals at the Tokyo Dome in Tokyo, Japan, and LoanDepot Park in Miami, Florida. The semifinals and final took place in Miami.\nFormat.\nThe top two teams from each pool advanced to the single elimination bracket. These games contested from March 15–21. Tokyo hosted two of the quarterfinals at the Tokyo Dome, while the other two quarterfinals, the semifinals, and the championship game took place at LoanDepot Park in Miami, Florida.\nDuring the quarterfinal round, the four first-round pool winners were the designated home teams against the four runners-up. For the semifinals and championship game, the team with the better overall record was the designated home team; if two opposing teams have the same record, home team designation was determined by coin flip.\nBracket.\n&lt;section begin=Bracket /&gt;&lt;section end=Bracket /&gt;\nQuarterfinals.\n&lt;section begin=QF /&gt;\nAustralia vs Cuba.\nThe knockout stage opener in Tokyo marked Australia's first ever quarterfinal game. Previously, the team had never advanced past pool play. The Australians scored first in the top of the second inning when Rixon Wingrove singled in Darryl George. Cuba tied the game in the third on a Luis Robert Jr. groundout. Cuba broke the tie in the bottom of the fifth, scoring three runs: one off an Alfredo Despaigne sac fly, and two off a Yoelkis Guibert single. Australia cut the lead to one when Wingrove hit a two-run home run, which proved to be the final runs of the game. Raidel Martínez earned the save for Cuba, sending the team to the semifinals for the first time since 2006.\nItaly vs Japan.\nShohei Ohtani started for Japan, while Ryan Castellani started for Italy. In the bottom of the third, Kensuke Kondo and Ohtani hit back-to-back singles. The next batter, Masataka Yoshida, grounded out to score Kondo. After a Munetaka Murakami walk, Kazuma Okamoto homered to give Japan a 4–0 lead. Ohtani was removed from the game in the top of the fifth after giving up a two-run single to Dominic Fletcher. Ohtani was replaced by Hiromi Itoh, who completed the inning. In the bottom of the inning, Murakami hit a two-run double for Japan, and Okamoto followed up with another double, scoring Murakami. In the seventh, Yoshida homered off Joey Marciano to extend Japan's lead to 8–2. Sōsuke Genda added on another run with a single. Fletcher hit a solo homer in the eighth off Yu Darvish. Mitchell Stumpo struck out the side in the eighth for Italy, and Taisei Ota earned the save for Japan. Ohtani earned the pitching win, having thrown four scoreless innings. With the win, Japan continued their streak of being the only team to reach the semifinals in every WBC to date.\nAccording to the Nikkan Sports, 48% of all households in Japan watched the game, making it the most watched Samurai Japan game in history. This beat the previous record of 44.4% set by the pool game against Korea just six days earlier.\nPuerto Rico vs Mexico.\nThis has been the second time Puerto Rico has faced off against Mexico in the WBC, with their first match being in pool play in 2017. Puerto Rico won the game 9–4.\nMarcus Stroman started for Puerto Rico, while Julio Urías started for Mexico. Urías got off to a shaky start, as Puerto Rico scored all of their four runs in the first inning. After an Kike Hernández walk and a Nelson Velásquez single, Emmanuel Rivera hit a sac fly to score Hernández for the first run of the game. Javier Báez and Eddie Rosario hit back-to-back homers to put Puerto Rico up 4–0. In the bottom of the second, Isaac Paredes homered for Mexico's first run of the game. Mexico began a rally in the fifth when Alek Thomas and Austin Barnes hit back-to-back singles off Stroman. Stroman then walked Randy Arozarena to load the bases. Alex Verdugo singled in Thomas for a run, which chased Stroman from the game. His replacement, Yacksel Ríos, was able to complete the inning without letting in any additional runs.\nIn the seventh, Puerto Rico's Alexis Díaz, brother of closer Edwin Díaz (who was injured while celebrating the team's win against the Dominican Republic two days earlier) entered the game to his brother's walkout song \"Narco\". Díaz promptly gave up a leadoff double to Barnes. He then walked Arozarena and Verdugo to load the bases, and was removed from the game and replaced with Jorge López. López got the next two batters out, bringing up Paredes. Paredes singled to left field, scoring Barnes and Arozarena and tying the game at four. Luis Urías then singled to bring home Verdugo, giving Mexico the lead for the first time. in the eighth, Puerto Rico nearly tied the game when Rivera hit a long ball to center field with a runner on first. However, Arozarena made a leaping catch against the wall to get Rivera out and rob Puerto Rico of the run. The bottom of the eighth was also scoreless. Puerto Rico put two runners on base in the ninth, but Mexico closer Giovanny Gallegos was able to get out of the jam by striking out Hernández. The comeback win sent Mexico to the semifinals for the first time in WBC history.\nUnited States vs Venezuela.\nThe United States and Venezuela previously met in the second round of the 2017 WBC. Team USA won the game, 4–2.\nTeam USA jumped on top early when Mookie Betts scored on a Mike Trout single that was misthrown by Ronald Acuña Jr. Cardinals teammates Paul Goldschmidt and Nolan Arenado also singled, with Goldschmidt's hit scoring Trout. Kyle Tucker then hit a single to center field, scoring Goldschmidt. Tucker was initially called safe at second after a close tag play with José Altuve, but the call was overturned for the first out of the inning. Martín Pérez was replaced with José Ruiz, who retired Tim Anderson and Kyle Schwarber to end the inning. Venezuela immediately struck back in the bottom of the inning with a two-run shot from Luis Arráez. In the fourth, Schwarber scored on a Mookie Betts sac fly to extend Team USA's lead by one. Tucker hit a solo homer in the top of the fifth to make it 5–2 for the United States. Venezuela loaded the bases in the bottom of the inning by way of two walks and an Andrés Giménez single. United States pitcher Daniel Bard threw a wild pitch to allow Gleyber Torres to score. Bard was then removed after walking Anthony Santander. His replacement, Jason Adam, got Arraez to force out, but another run scored. The next batter, Salvador Pérez, doubled to right field, scoring pinch runner Luis Rengifo and tying the game at five. Acuña then hit a sac fly, scoring another run and giving Venezuela the lead. Adam retired David Peralta to end the inning.\nIn the seventh, Team USA put two runners on base but failed to score. In the bottom of the inning, Arraez hit a solo home run off the foul pole – his second homer of the night. Team USA started off the eighth inning down by two runs as José Quijada walked Anderson with no outs. Pete Alonso then singled, and J. T. Realmuto was hit by a pitch to load the bases. Quijada was removed from the game and was replaced with Silvino Bracho. The first batter Bracho faced was Trea Turner. On an 0–2 count, Turner hit a grand slam to left field, giving the United States a two-run lead. In the bottom of the eighth, Devin Williams was able to work around a leadoff Acuña double by retiring the next three batters. Closer Ryan Pressly retired all three batters he faced in the bottom of the ninth to propel Team USA to the semifinals.\nSemifinals.\n&lt;section begin=SF /&gt;\nCuba vs United States.\nThis marked the Cuban national team's first appearance in Miami since early in Fidel Castro's reign, dating back an estimated 60 years. The appearance of the team in Miami, which has the highest concentration of Cuban-Americans in the United States, caused a protest to occur outside the stadium. Protestors viewed the team as in favor of the Cuban government's policies. Anti-government sentiment also occurred inside the stadium, as Yoán Moncada and Luis Robert Jr., the first active MLB players to ever play for the Cuban national team, were booed. Harassment against families of Cuban players and even fights with a player occurred during the game. While Moncada batted in the fifth inning, a fan with a sign demanding justice for demonstrators imprisoned during the 2021 Cuban protests ran onto the field. Chants of \"Libertad\" and \"Patria y Vida\" were also heard.\nRoenis Elías started for Cuba and Adam Wainwright started for the United States. In the first inning, Cuban players hit three straight infield singles to load the bases. Wainwright then walked Alfredo Despaigne to give Cuba a 1–0 lead with no outs. However, Wainwright was able to retire the next three batters to limit the damage. In the bottom of the inning, Paul Goldschmidt hit a two-run homer after a Mookie Betts double to give the US the lead. Trea Turner followed up on his heroic performance in the quarterfinal game by hitting a solo home run in the second inning. Team USA scored two more in the bottom of the fourth on a Pete Alonso single and a Tim Anderson sacrifice fly. In the fourth, Nolan Arenado tripled in his Cardinals teammate Goldschmidt to give the US a 6–1 lead. Arenado then scored on a wild pitch from Cuba's Carlos Viera. Cuba scored their second run of the game on an Andy Ibáñez single in the top of the fifth. Goldschmidt singled in two more runs off Elian Leyva in the bottom of the inning. Turner hit his second home run of the game in the sixth – a three-run shot off Leyva to give the US a commanding ten-run lead. Trout doubled in Betts in the same inning. In the eighth, Cedric Mullins hit a solo homer to complete the 14–2 blowout victory for the United States. The win sent Team USA to the finals for the second time in a row.\nMexico vs Japan.\nPatrick Sandoval started for Mexico, while Rōki Sasaki started for Japan. Sandoval and Sasaki kept the game scoreless for the first three innings. In the top of the fourth, Rowdy Tellez and Isaac Paredes hit back-to-back singles for Mexico. The next batter, Luis Urias, hit a three-run home run to give Mexico an early lead. Japan threatened in the bottom of the inning when Kensuke Kondo and Masataka Yoshida singled, but failed to capitalize. Although left fielder Randy Arozarena helped Sandoval by robbing Kazuma Okamoto of a home run, Sandoval was removed from the game after walking Sōsuke Genda after a Tetsuto Yamada single in the fifth. His replacement, José Urquidy, walked Lars Nootbaar to load the bases, but Japan failed to score. Urquidy loaded the bases again in the sixth, but, once again, Japan did not score. In the seventh, Urquidy was taken out after giving up a single to Kondoh with two outs. JoJo Romero, Urquidy's replacement, walked Shohei Ohtani. The next batter, Masataka Yoshida, hit a home run off the foul pole to tie the game at three.\nMexico answered in the top of the eighth with a double from Arozarena off Yoshinobu Yamamoto. Alex Verdugo hit a double of his own on the first pitch, sending Arozarena home to retake the lead. Joey Meneses then singled to put runners at first and third with one out. Yamamoto was replaced with Atsuki Yuasa, who struck out Tellez for the second out. Paredes then singled to bring home pinch runner Jarren Duran. Meneses slid home for another run, but was beaten to the plate by the throw from Yoshida for the final out. Mexico now led 5–3. In the bottom of the eighth, Mexico's Jesús Cruz hit Kazuma Okamoto with a pitch and then gave up a single to Yamada. Genda sacrifice bunted to advance the runners to second and third. The next batter was Hotaka Yamakawa, who hit a sac fly to left field to score pinch runner Takumu Nakano. This cut Mexico's lead to one. Cruz was replaced by Gerardo Reyes, who walked Nootbaar before striking out Kondoh for the third out. Japan closer Taisei Ota had a fairly smooth ninth inning, facing only four batters. Mexico led 5–4 going into the bottom of the ninth, where closer Giovanny Gallegos was sent in to record the final three outs. Gallegos gave up a first-pitch double to Ohtani, putting him in scoring position with no outs. After a mound visit, Gallegos walked Yoshida (Ukyo Shuto pinch ran), bringing Munetaka Murakami to the plate. On a 1–1 pitch, Murakami doubled to center field to score both runners, winning the game for Japan."

The spotlight showed up very few weaknesses in his case.\nThat performance propelled Hutton into the final trial match on 10 January 1931 where he played for the Scotland Probables side against the Scotland Possibles.\nInternational career.\nHe played for Scotland 2 times from 1930 to 1931.\nBanking career.\nHutton was employed in the Hong Kong and Shanghai bank and played rugby union for their company side; and also captained the United Banks XV."

        "text": "The 1947–48 St. Cloud State Huskies men's ice hockey season was the 14th season of play for the program but 1st under NCAA oversight. The Huskies represented St. Cloud State Teachers College and were coached by Roland Vandell in his 2nd season.\nSeason.\nSt. Cloud produced one of the best seasons the program had ever seen in 1948. Led by star forward Sergio Gambucci, the Huskies got off to a tremendous start, winning their first five games of the year. Though they got a fight from St. John's, the Huskies largely controlled both ends of the ice which was highlighted by a 14–2 demolition of Bemidji State.\nThe Huskies ran into a rough patch in the middle of the season. After losing to a semi-pro outfit (Eagle River), St. Cloud met Michigan Tech on their home ice and swamped by the powerful engineers. The Huskies recovered afterwards and put up two more victories to keep their record spotless against Minnesota outfits.\nAfter the second game against Duluth, one of the cars that was transporting players to the Eveleth game crashed into a bus. In the accident, Mel Janski banged up his knee while Cobby Saatzer was felled by a leg injury that would keep him out for the rest of the year. The hamstrung Huskies did what they could to win the match that night but they ended up losing 3–5 without two of their starting players.\nThe following week the team attended the Minnesota Winter Carnival and were still reeling from the injuries. Janski gutted through the pain and saw some ice time but it was up to the alternates to fill in for their afflicted comrades. While the reserves did their best, it was lineup regulars Gambucci, Strand and Braga who turned in stellar performances. After shutting out St. Thomas in the opening game, St. Cloud was able to just edge out St. John's for the third time that season and make the championship match. In the final game, St. Cloud peppered the St. Olaf cage with shots but the opposing netminder turned in a stirling performance to keep his team in the match. The Oles tied the game in the third and then stubbornly refused to let up in overtime. Two 5-minute periods elapsed without a goal, leading to a sudden-death session. In the third overtime, Jerry Adamic collected the game-winner on a pass from George Sachen to capture the championship.\nAfter winning the title, St. Cloud had a bit of a letdown in their next game and barely escaped from Bemidji State with a 1–0 win. The team ended its season with a return match against Eveleth Junior College and avenged their earlier loss. The win left the team with a stellar record and a claim as the best college team in Minnesota other than the Golden Gophers.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Minnesota State Tournament\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "title": "The Law Firm (basketball)",
        "text": "The Law Firm of Clark and Czinano, also known as The Law Firm, were a duo of college basketball players consisting of Caitlin Clark and Monika Czinano, who both played for the Iowa Hawkeyes from 2020 to 2023. Developed under head coach Lisa Bluder, they were one of the top duos in NCAA Division I, leading Iowa to the 2023 national championship game, two Big Ten tournament titles and one Big Ten regular season title.\nBackground.\nLightly recruited out of high school, Czinano was a reserve for Megan Gustafson in her freshman season at Iowa in 2018–19, before becoming the team's top post player as a sophomore in 2019–20. Clark was one of the top recruits in her class and joined the Hawkeyes in Czinano's junior season in 2020–21 as a starting guard. The duo was nicknamed \"The Law Firm of Clark and Czinano,\" or simply \"The Law Firm,\" by Big Ten Network analyst Christy Winters-Scott, and the nickname subsequently gained popularity among Iowa fans. They benefited from Clark's gravity as a three-point shooter, which spread out defenses and opened passing lanes between Clark and Czinano, as well as Czinano's improved shooting touch.\nCareer.\nIn the 2020–21 season, Clark and Czinano were named first-team All-Big Ten. They led Iowa to a runner-up finish at the Big Ten tournament, where each member of the duo made the all-tournament team while setting tournament records: Czinano in points and field goals, and Clark in assists. At the end of the season, Clark and Czinano ranked first and second, respectively, among Division I players in field goals. Czinano led the nation in field goal percentage (66.8), and Clark, who earned All-American honors, was the Division I leader in points per game (26.6) and total assists (214).\nEntering the 2021–22 season, Iowa head coach Lisa Bluder described Clark and Czinano as one of the best point guard and center duos in the nation. They helped Iowa win Big Ten regular season and tournament titles in the same season for the first time in program history, with Clark being named tournament most outstanding player (MOP) and the duo earning all-tournament team honors. They were both first-team All-Big Ten selections, and Clark was named Big Ten Player of the Year. Clark was a unanimous first-team All-American, and Czinano received All-American honorable mention from the Associated Press (AP). Clark led Division I in points per game (27.0) and assists per game (8.0), and Czinano led the nation in field goal percentage (67.9). They became the first pair of men's or women's Division I teammates to lead the nation in those categories.\nThe duo played for a third season in 2022–23 after Czinano opted to use her fifth season of eligibility granted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Clark and Czinano became the fourth and fifth Iowa players to reach 2,000 career points, respectively, and were the first teammates in Big Ten history to achieve the feat in the same season. They were both named first-team All-Big Ten, and Clark earned her second straight Big Ten Player of the Year award. Iowa won the 2023 Big Ten tournament, with Clark winning MOP and being joined by Czinano on the all-tournament team. Czinano set the tournament record for field goal percentage (91.7). At the 2023 NCAA tournament, they led the Hawkeyes to their first title game, losing to LSU. Clark was the consensus national player of the year, leading the nation in assists per game (8.6), and Czinano repeated as AP All-American honorable mention.\nAftermath.\nIn the 2023 WNBA draft, Czinano was selected by the Los Angeles Sparks in the third round. Clark was not eligible for the draft until 2024; under the collective bargaining agreement between the WNBA and its players' union, players born in the U.S., or who have played U.S. college basketball, cannot enter the draft until the calendar year of their 22nd birthday, they have received their bachelor's degree, or are set to earn said degree within three months of the draft (whichever comes first). Unlike Czinano, Clark chose not to take advantage of the COVID waiver, announcing near the end of her senior season that she would declare for the 2024 draft."

They defeated twentieth-ranked Arkansas to finish in third place in the tournament. They then upset tenth-ranked Tennessee in the ACC–SEC Challenge and won their ACC opener over Florida State. They were defeated by eventual national champion, then fifth-ranked UConn in the Jimmy V Classic and lost a rivalry match to fourteenth-ranked Kentucky. They defeated seventh-ranked Oklahoma in the Jumpman Invitational to move up to ninth in the rankings. The defeat of Oklahoma started a string of ten straight wins for the team, including rivalry wins over NC State and Wake Forest and a ten-point defeat of sixteenth-ranked Clemson. At the end of the streak, the team reached its highest ranking during the season, third. The Tar Heels had a rough stretch after that, winning only two of their next five games. However, one of those two wins was against bitter rival, and seventh-ranked Duke. The team won its last six games including rivaly re-matches with NC State and ninth-ranked Duke.\nThe Tar Heels finished the season 29–8 and 17–3 in ACC play to finish as regular season champions. As the first seed in the ACC tournament, they earned a bye to the Quarterfinals where defeated ninth seed Florida State. They defated Pittsburgh in the Semifinals, but could not overcome NC State for a third time in the season in the Final. They lost 76–84 to finish as runner-up. They earned an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament and were placed as a first seed in the West region. They defeated sixteenth-seed Wagner in the First Round, and ninth-seed Michigan State in the Second Round before falling to fourth-seed Alabama in the Sweet Sixteen to end their season.\nPrevious season.\nAfter starters Caleb Love, R. J. Davis, Armando Bacot, and Leaky Black, who had been key pieces in the 2021–22 team's National Runner-Up finish, decided to return for the 2022–23 season, the Tar Heels earned the No. 1 ranking in the preseason AP Poll. Despite the lofty expectations and desires to win the championship that had narrowly eluded them the season prior, the 2022–23 Tar Heels struggled mightily, finishing the season 20–13 (11–9 in conference play) and missing the NCAA tournament altogether. The 2022–23 team became the first preseason No. 1 to miss the NCAA tournament since the field expanded to 64 teams in 1985. After missing the \"big dance,\" the Tar Heels issued a statement declining a bid for the NIT.\nBacot, despite battling ankle and shoulder injuries that caused him to miss some time, proved to be one of the lone bright spots on the season, as neither Love, Davis, nor Black returned to their form from the 2022 tournament run. Bacot set all-time program records for career double-doubles by passing Billy Cunningham's school record of 61, and he also became the all-time leading rebounder in program history by passing Tyler Hansbrough's record as well.\nOffseason.\nAfter declining a bid to the NIT, the offseason began sooner than many in Chapel Hill had expected. On March 13, 2023, the Transfer Portal officially opened, and like many other programs, the Tar Heels immediately lost players, with first-year reserve forward Tyler Nickel and senior Justin McKoy both entering the portal. Nickel transferred to Virginia Tech, and McKoy chose to spend his final season of eligibility at Hawaii.\nFollowing Nickel and McKoy, sophomore guard/forward Dontrez Styles announced his intentions to leave the Tar Heels and enter the transfer portal. He committed to Georgetown in April.\nPuff Johnson also entered his name into the transfer portal, on March 22, 2023. He later committed to Penn State.\nLeaky Black and Pete Nance, who had both used their extra year of eligibility provided by the COVID-19 pandemic for the 2022–23 season also left the team, as both had their eligibility expire after using their fifth-year options.\nLater that week, both R.J. Davis and Armando Bacot announced their decisions to return for another season in Chapel Hill.\nReserve forward Will Shaver announced his intentions to enter the transfer portal on March 25, 2023. After originally committing to Belmont, Shaver announced in a tweet that he had reopened his transfer recruitment. He later committed to UAB, deciding to return to his hometown of Birmingham.\nAfter much speculation as to what his future would hold, Caleb Love decided to enter the transfer portal and play his senior season elsewhere. Love originally committed to Michigan, but decommitted after reported issues with transfer credits. He later announced his commitment to Arizona, reuniting with former Tar Heel assistant Steve Robinson, who is currently an assistant at Arizona.\nThe Tar Heels sought to fill these departures by utilizing the transfer portal to bring in new players. They received their first commitment when former Brown guard Paxson Wojcik committed to the Tar Heels for his final season of eligibility. He is the son of Doug Wojcik, who was an assistant coach for the Tar Heels from 2000–2003 under Matt Doherty.\nThe team received its second transfer portal commitment in April, as former Louisville forward, and Charlotte native, Jae'Lyn Withers announced his decision to return to his home state and transfer to Carolina.\nLater in the month, former Notre Dame guard Cormac Ryan committed to the Tar Heels following an official visit to Chapel Hill.\nCoach Davis' Tar Heels received another portal commitment on April 22, when former Stanford wing Harrison Ingram, the 2022 Pac-12 Freshman of the Year, committed to the Tar Heels.\nOn May 11, sophomore guard D'Marco Dunn entered the transfer portal.\nAlso in May, guard Elliot Cadeau, who had been committed to the Tar Heels as part of their 2024 recruiting class, announced his intentions to reclassify and head to Chapel Hill for the 2023-24 season.\nAfter a few months of relative quiet, the Tar Heels received another transfer portal commitment in July, when former West Virginia reserve big man James Okonkwo committed to the team.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=| Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=|ACC Tournament\n!colspan=12 style=| NCAA tournament"

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Bobcats represent Texas State University in the NCAA's Sun Belt Conference.\nTexas State began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1920. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Texas State's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2021–22 season."

It was a form of bowling as a test of skill, with the highest scorer(s) winning the prize. The traditional prize was a live pig to take home. The game traditionally used nine wooden pins at the end of an alley, and a solid wooden ball. It was common through the 19th and 20th centuries. Some fêtes retain the name for their bowling sideshow, but no longer offer a live pig as a prize.\nPrize.\nThe traditional prize was a piglet for the winner to take home and raise. The pig was seen as a very valuable prize, given the importance of fresh meat in contemporary diets, and pork being the only meat that most families would ever eat.\nThe practice of winning a live pig led to the phrase \"bringing home the bacon\", relating to winning bacon, and latterly to gaining things of value.\nSome fairs used other animals, such as bowling for a lamb. As fewer people kept livestock, some fairs started to offer joints of pork as the prize instead of a live animal, and some fairs continue the name today but have substituted other prizes."

        "text": "The 1947–48 Tufts Jumbos men's ice hockey season was the 10th season of play for the program but 1st under NCAA oversight. The Jumbos represented Tufts College and were coached by Harry Briggs for the first three games before Frank Anderson took over for the final match.\nSeason.\nPrior to the start of the season, the university's athletic association announced that there would not be an ice hockey team in 1948. Despite the news, Harry Briggs and the players from last year's squad organized on their own and arranged a limited schedule. The club arranged a date with MIT in early December and, despite having limited ice time and no access to the school's equipment, the team performed well in a loss with Joe Saunders being under siege all game. The refusal of the team to quietly disperse had attracted a contingent of some 350 students for the game and many more in the aftermath. The club petitioned the school for formal recognition and pressured the administration to allow them to wear the school colors.\nIn early January, the college president (Leonard Carmichael) and vice president (Richard Kelley) met with three representatives from the team; Charles Kerrigan, Roger Peck and Robert Harris. The players asked for the school to give formal recognition for the team and were told that, while the administration wasn't against the idea in principle, the issue at hand was where the team could play. Acting A.D. William S. Yeager had cancelled the team because, in his opinion, all teams representing the college should play their home games on campus. While this wasn't an issue with most programs, the fact that Tufts College did not have an on-campus ice rink meant that the team was forces to go elsewhere to play their games. Yeager believed that if the players were good enough to play ice hockey then they should attend a different school that featured the game. I the end, however, Yeager relented and dropped his opposition to the team. The school agreed to formally recognize the outfit but would not financially support the program.\nIn the meantime, the club had won two matches and were gearing up for a rematch with the Engineers. In the final game of the year, the team, now wearing official school sweaters, found themselves in trouble. After allowing two goals in the first, they allowed another pair in the first five minutes of the middle frame and were down 1–4. While everything appeared to being going in favor of MIT, the Jumbos were able to turn the momentum in their favor with a power play goal before the midway point of the game. Just a few minutes later, Scooter Haines got the team's third goal and Tufts was suddenly down by just one goal. The Engineers hunkered down and kept the Jumbos back for several minutes but Dave Merrow managed to tie the score with just 25 seconds left in the period. Tufts kept MIT hemmed in their own end for most of the third and Peck was able to net the final goal of the game, giving the Jumbos a winning season and a perfect end to a tumultuous season.\nFrank Anderson served as head coach for the final game, taking over from Harry Briggs after the winter break. Russell Brewer served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "Rugby league in Sydney is the city's most popular sport, with over 200 clubs in the city across levels of competition ranging from the fully professional National Rugby League to grassroots open age and junior leagues.\nHistory.\nBy the 1890s Rugby football had taken hold in Sydney, thwarting attempts by Victorian rules and soccer to gain the ascendancy. The game continued to grow becoming the most popular code of football in NSW, until the issue of professionalism led to a schism in 1908 and the formation of the New South Wales Rugby Football League. The NSWRU lost many players including the great Dally Messenger to the new sport of rugby league, which became the most popular sport in Sydney by attendance and public interest by World War I.\nThe NSWRFL premiership was continued on the successful basis of the first competition in 1908. In 1929 Jersey Flegg was appointed to the position of president of the NSWRFL and in 1941 he became chairman of the Australian Rugby League Board of Control. At the time of his death in 1960, aged 82, he was still serving in these roles.\nWhen NSWRFL president Flegg died in 1960, Bill Buckley replaced him and also became boss of the Australian Rugby League, a position he remained in from 1960 until his death in 1973. In 1973 Kevin Humphreys was appointed President of New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL) and Chairman of Australian Rugby League (ARL).\nIn 1983 Humphreys was succeeded in these positions by Ken Arthurson. Under Arthurson the clubs in the NSWRL expanded outside the borders of the state and even the country until in 1994, after administering its 87th consecutive premiership season, the NSWRL was replaced by the Australian Rugby League as club football's peak administrative body.\nNotwithstanding the hand over of control of the game at the elite level across Australia to the commission, the NSWRL did retain responsibility for both the administration of the New South Wales rugby league team in State of Origin series, as well as day-to-day management of the state-based New South Wales Cup second-tier premiership, as well as junior representative competitions.\nIn modern times, the NSWRL has 82,397 (450,000 including variants) participants, the vast majority of which are located in Sydney as the state's main population centre.\nRon Massey Cup.\nThe Ron Massey Cup (formerly known as the Bundaberg Red Cup and Jim Beam Cup) is a semi-professional development level rugby league competition in New South Wales currently comprising 9 teams drawn from the Sydney metropolitan area. \nNSWRL Conference competitions.\nThe NSWRL Conference Competitions are a set of competitions for clubs in the Sydney rugby league districts of Balmain, Canterbury-Bankstown, Cronulla-Sutherland, Manly-Warringah/North Sydney, Parramatta and St. George.\nMetro Open Age Gold.\nThe competition is holding one top grade division in 2023, similar to the now defunct Sydney Combined Competition.\nCentral Northern Open Age.\nThe Central Northern Open Age competitions are for clubs in the Sydney rugby league districts of Balmain and Manly-Warringah/North Sydney.

        "text": "The 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup final was the concluding basketball game which determined the winner of the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup. The game was played on 10 September 2023, at the Mall of Asia Arena, in Pasay, Metro Manila, Philippines, between Germany and Serbia. It was the first all-European final since 2006 in Japan, when Spain won its first title against Greece.\nAt halftime, a turnover ceremony was held to officially hand over the hosting rights of the FIBA Basketball World Cup from the Philippines, Japan, and Indonesia to Qatar, host of the 2027 FIBA Basketball World Cup, the first in tournament history to be held in the Middle East and North Africa region. The Naismith Trophy was awarded to the winning team for the second time since the adoption of its new version in 2017, with Germany winning its first World Cup title.\nBackground.\nThe 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup was the 19th edition of the tournament, held in multiple countries for the first time in its history in the Philippines, Japan, and Indonesia, between 25 August and 10 September 2023. Japan and the Philippines automatically qualified as hosts but Indonesia weren't able to qualify after failing to reach the quarterfinals of the 2022 FIBA Asia Cup, which was the condition set by FIBA for the country to qualify for the tournament. 80 teams competed for the remaining 30 spots through qualification windows organized by FIBA's four confederations (Africa, Americas, Asia-Oceania, Europe) and were held from November 2021 to February 2023. In the final draw, the 32 qualified teams were then divided into eight groups of four teams, with each team playing each other once in a round-robin format. The top two teams in each group qualified for the second round made up of the teams that advanced from the first round, with groups being formed by joining pairs of first-round groups together (A and B to I, C and D to J, E and F to K, and G and H to L). The top two teams from each group advanced to a knock-out phase.\nThe defending champions from the 2019 World Cup were Spain. They managed to top their first round group but were eliminated in the second round, finishing at third behind Canada and Latvia. Both Germany and Serbia have not won the FIBA Basketball World Cup once, but the latter cliched two consecutive titles in 1998 and 2002, respectively, as the former Yugoslavia. Germany won its last matchup against Serbia at the World Cup in 2010 in double-overtime, 82–81.\nSerbia reached the 2014 final and the 2016 Olympic final, but lost to the United States on both occasions. They were also eliminated by Argentina in the quarter-finals of the 2019 tournament. Under head coach Svetislav Pešić, Serbia won all of its five games in the group phase and finished 9th at the EuroBasket 2022. The 2023 final would be the first for Germany in their seventh World Cup appearance and sixth as Germany, as they were formerly known as West Germany in their tournament debut in 1986. Their previous best performance was at the 2002 World Cup, where they won the bronze medal after winning against New Zealand in the third-place game. Under head coach Gordon Herbert, Germany also won the bronze at the EuroBasket 2022, the country's first podium finish in the tournament since 2005.\nVenue.\nThe final was played at the Mall of Asia Arena in Pasay, a city within Metro Manila, Philippines. The arena was one of the five proposed venues of the joint Philippine–Japanese–Indonesian World Cup bid, and was named the Final Phase venue on 28 April 2023. It hosted twelve group stage games, four second-round games, four 17–32 classification games, and all final phase games.\nThe Mall of Asia Arena, owned by SM Lifestyle Entertainment, which is under SM Prime Holdings, was built as part of the master plan for the SM Mall of Asia complex. The arena was designed by architecture firm Arquitectonica, and has a seating capacity of 15,000 but can host as much as 20,000 people in a full-house capacity. Construction began in 2010, and had its topping-off ceremony in September 2011. It hosted its first basketball event, a 2012 PBA Governors Cup semifinals game between the B-Meg Llamados and the Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters, on 7 July 2012.\nThe arena is one of the playing venues of the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA) and the country's major collegiate leagues (NCAA, UAAP). It has also hosted the 2013 FIBA Asia Championship, one of the 2016 FIBA World Olympic Qualifying Tournaments for Men, the basketball tournament of the 2019 Southeast Asian Games, and several 2019 and 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup Asian Qualifiers games of the Philippines.\nVenue change.\nThe joint bid initially called for the 55,000-seater Philippine Arena in Bocaue, Bulacan to host the World Cup's Final Phase, from the quarter-finals to the World Cup Final. The arena previously hosted the 2018 FIBA 3x3 World Cup, three FIBA Basketball World Cup Asian Qualifiers games of the Philippines for 2019 and 2023, and the opening ceremony of the 2019 Southeast Asian Games.\nOn 28 April 2023, FIBA announced during its Central Board meeting that the venue would be changed to the Mall of Asia Arena in Pasay, citing logistical and transport issues, which were experienced in various events at the arena, including various concerts and the sixth and final window of the 2023 World Cup Asian Qualifiers. Instead, the Philippine Arena hosted the first two games of Group A on 25 August 2023: Angola vs. Italy and Dominican Republic vs. Philippines.\nRoute to the final.\n\"Note: In all results below, the score of the finalist is given first.\"\nGame.\nThe game between Germany and Serbia was widely seen as a surprising final, as both teams were not favoured in their semi-final match-ups. In FIBA's media survey, none of the participants tipped Germany or Serbia as title winners, instead favouring record holders United States. The game was tightly contested in the first quarter, which finished with a 23–26 score. Serbia went on a run in the second quarter, and following a Bogdan Bogdanović step-back three-pointer the Serbs led by four points, 38–42. Germany managed to come back and the two teams went into halftime with the score tied at 47–47. It was only the second time a World Cup final had been tied at halftime. In the third quarter, Germany opened up a lead after going on a 15–4 run and began the final quarter with a 12-point lead. Serbia fought back, behind 13 points in the quarter from Aleksa Avramović. With 1:21 remaining and just a three-point lead, Germany's Isaac Bonga turned over the ball to Marko Gudurić, who missed a lay-up as he was fouled in the process. Following more free throws by Germany and Serbia, the game was 79–77, Germany, in the final minute. With just 21 seconds on the clock, it was Dennis Schröder driving lay-up that gave the Germans an 81–77 lead. In the following possession, Gudurić turned the ball over and Schröder converted two free-throws to seal Germany's first-ever World Cup title. Schröder had a game-high 28 points and hit nine of his seventeen attempted field goals. Franz Wagner contributed 19 points and 7 rebounds, while Avramović led Serbia in scoring with 21 points. Bogdanović finished with 17 points and 5 assists. Schröder was named the tournament's most valuable player after the game, and was also named to the All-Star Five along with Bogdanović.\nSources:"

It was the 10th edition of the Chess World Cup. The winner, runner-up and third-place finisher of the tournament (Magnus Carlsen, R Praggnanandhaa and Fabiano Caruana) earned the right to the play in the 2024 Candidates Tournament. In January 2024, Carlsen withdrew from the Candidates tournament, with the fourth-place finisher from the World Cup (Nijat Abasov) qualifying in his place. The tournament was held in parallel with the Women's Chess World Cup 2023.\nJan-Krzysztof Duda was the defending champion. He lost in the fifth round (last 16) to Fabiano Caruana.\nFormat.\nThe tournament was an eight-round knockout event, with the top 50 seeds having been given a bye directly into the second round. The losers of the two semi-finals played a match for third place.\nThe players who finished first, second, and third qualified for the Candidates Tournament 2024, a tournament to decide the challenger for the upcoming World Championship.\nEach round consisted of classical time limit games on the first two days, plus tie-breaks on the third day if they were required.

        "title": "Women's rugby league in the British Isles",
        "text": "Rugby league is an increasingly popular sport for women in Great Britain.\nEarly instances of women playing rugby league were recorded in the 1930s and 1950s but it was not until the 1980s that the Women's Rugby League Association was formed and the first league was organised. Since then expansion has been gradual with a multi-level competition being established in 2014 by the Rugby Football League (RFL), mirroring the structure in the men's game. In 2023 the first steps towards the game turning professional were taken as Super League clubs York Valkyrie and Leeds Rhinos introducing payments for players.\nEach of the four nations, England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland has their own governing body and run their own national teams. It is the RFL, the national governing body of the sport in England, that organises most women's competitions including these which have teams from the other nations participating.\nBetween 1996 and 2003 a Great Britain national team existed but since then each nation has had its own national team.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nInstances of women playing rugby league as opposed to being involved in the running of the game are sparse in the first 80 years of the sport. Games are recorded as being played during the lockout of miners in 1921, and during the 1926 General Strike. Three games were played in Workington in 1953 during celebrations for the Coronation of Elizabeth II.\nWomen's Amateur Rugby League Association.\nIn 1978, 13-year-old Elisabeth Beale was, at first, banned and then given permission to play for amateur club, Normanton. Increasing interest for playing lead to the formation of teams and in December 1981 a seven-a-side tournament was organised by the Underbank club in Huddersfield, which attracted eight teams.\nThe Women's Amateur Rugby League Association was formed in 1985 and the following year the first league competition was played with six teams participating. By 1993 the league had expanded to two divisions with 16 teams competing. Over the next two decades the game stagnated due to organisational disputes and sexism within the sport.\nRFL control.\nAt the end of 2013 the RFL established the Women's Rugby League Championship and Division 1 which was played for by 13 teams, five in the Championship and 11 in Division 1.\nAfter three seasons, the RFL re-organised the league into a structure mirroring the men's game with three divisions, Super League, Championship and League 1. The change in structure also saw a change towards a majority of teams in the leagues becoming associated with the professional men's clubs rather than amateur clubs.\nThe growing importance of the women's game was recognised when Betfred agreed to sponsor the Super League and subsequently the Challenge Cup alongside the company's sponsorship of the men's game.\nBy 2023 the women's game has 43 clubs in five divisions, Super League, Super League South, Championship, League 1 and League 2. For 2024 a major restructure is planned which will see Super League comprise eight teams with four regional leagues forming the next tier. Below the regional leagues will be local leagues.\n2023 saw the first steps towards the women's game in Britain becoming professional as York and Leeds announced they would match matchday payments.\nThe sport has become more popular with the number of women and girls playing increasing by 53% between 2017 and 2021.\nUnder the reforms to be made to the men's game, which re-introduce licensing, having a women's team will become a requirement for a men's club to obtain the top grade licence.\nNational team.\nA Great Britain national team first appeared in 1989 when two games of and pass rugby were played against France.\nThe first major tour for the Great Britain team came in 1996 when a tour to Australia was undertaken. Between 1996 and 2002 the team played against southern hemisphere teams in tours and World Cup competitions. From 2007 the Great Britain team was put into abeyance and each nation developed its own team. England played their first game in 2007 against France. Wales played their first match in 2021. Ireland also played their first match in 2021. As of May 2023 Scotland are still to form a team.\nDomestic competitions.\nLeague structure.\nThe RFL has run the Women's Super League, Championship, League 1 and League 2 for teams across England, Scotland, and Wales since 2017. However all teams currently competing are from northern England due to the geographic variance in the sports popularity. In 2021 the Super League South was launched for clubs in southern England and Wales. Women's Super League Midlands and North regional competitions were launched in 2023.\nFrom 2024 the Championship, League 1 and League 2 will be replaced by four regional leagues; North (Scotland, north and west Cumbria, North East England), Roses (North West England and Yorkshire), Midlands (Midlands and North Wales), and South (South Wales, Southern England). These regional leagues will have opportunity for promotion to the Super League.\nWales.\nIn 2019, Wales Rugby League launch a domestic league outside the RFL with all teams based in South Wales. The leading club in Wales, , however plays in the RFL Women's Super League South. They won the league in both 2021 and 2022.\nChallenge Cup.\nA Challenge Cup competition was started in 2012. In 2023 the final of the competition will be played at Wembley Stadium for the first time as part of a finals day with the final of the men's Cup, the final of the 1895 Cup and the year 7 schools final."

The 17th and final ranking event of the 2023–24 snooker season, it is organised by the World Snooker Tour and sponsored by car retailer Cazoo. The event is being broadcast domestically in the United Kingdom by the BBC, Eurosport, and Discovery+, as well as by other broadcasters worldwide. The winner will receive £500,000 from a total prize fund of £2,395,000.\nLuca Brecel was the defending champion, having defeated Mark Selby in the 2023 final. Brecel lost 910 in the first round to David Gilbert. As a first time champion, he was unable to overcome the Crucible curse and he was the 19th first time champion who was unable to defend his title at the venue. In the third round of qualifying, Noppon Saengkham made a maximum break.\nBackground.\nThe final of the first World Snooker Championship took place in 1927 at Camkin's Hall in Birmingham, England, and was won by Joe Davis. Staged annually until 1940, the tournament was not held from 194145 due to World War II and went into decline in the post-war era; the 1952 event was contested by only two players and was replaced by the World Professional Match-play Championship, which was also discontinued in 1957. Joe Davis won the first 15 World Championships, held from 1927 to 1946, and is the only undefeated player in the tournament's history. \nRevived on a challenge basis in 1964, the World Championship reverted to an annual knockout tournament in 1969, which marked the beginning of the championship's \"modern era\". The 1977 tournament was the first staged at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England, where it has remained since. Stephen Hendry and Ronnie O'Sullivan are the most successful players in the World Championship's modern era, each having won the title seven times. Hendry is the tournament's youngest winner, having captured his first title in 1990, aged . O'Sullivan is the oldest winner, having secured his seventh title in 2022, aged .\nThe 2024 event (officially the 2024 Cazoo World Snooker Championship) is organised by the World Snooker Tour and sponsored for the second time by car retailer Cazoo. It marks the 48th consecutive year that the tournament has been held at the Crucible, and the 56th successive year that the World Championship has been contested through the modern knockout format. Luca Brecel was the defending champion, having defeated Mark Selby 1815 in the 2023 final to win his first world title. The first winner from mainland Europe, Brecel is the fourth World Champion in the modern era from outside the United Kingdom, following Cliff Thorburn in 1980, Ken Doherty in 1997, and Neil Robertson in 2010. At the 2024 event, he attempted to overcome the Crucible curse, which refers to the failure of any first-time winner to retain the title since the tournament moved to the Crucible in 1977, but he was knocked out in the first round after losing to David Gilbert 109.\nFormat.\nQualifying took place from 8 to 17 April 2024 at the English Institute of Sport in Sheffield, England.

The breakdown of prize money is shown below:\nA bonus of £40,000 is on offer for a maximum break made at the Crucible, and £10,000 for a maximum made in the qualifying rounds. These bonuses are in addition to the £15,000 highest prize and will be shared in the case of multiple maximums. An additional bonus of £147,000 is on offer for players who make two maximum breaks during the season's Triple Crown events. The latter bonus can be won up to three times, including multiple times by the same player (e.g. if one player made six maximums in Triple Crown events, they would win £441,000). Prior to the 2024 World Championship, three players had already made maximums that counted toward this bonus—Xu Si made a maximum in the 2023 UK Championship qualifying rounds, and Ding Junhui and Mark Allen each made one at the 2024 Masters.

        "text": "The New Hampshire Wildcats men's basketball statistical leaders are individual statistical leaders of the New Hampshire Wildcats men's basketball program in various categories, including points, assists, blocks, rebounds, and steals. Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Wildcats represent the University of New Hampshire in the NCAA's America East Conference.\nNew Hampshire began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1902. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but New Hampshire's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2021–22 season."

This was the inaugural varsity season, led by head coach John Ross. \nThey played their home games at Stebbins High School in Riverside, Ohio.\nBackground.\nWright State University was launched in the mid-1960s along with Cleveland State University to add additional public education opportunities in Ohio. Under the leadership of Dr. Brage Golding, It became an independent school in 1967, and by 1968 the school decided to launch an athletic department. Dr. Golding asked Don Mohr to lead this effort. Don Mohr later served as athletic director and baseball coach.\nAfter launching one of the first varsity soccer teams in the area, Don Mohr turned his attention to basketball with the belief that varsity basketball would do the most to increase awareness of the new university. He hired John Ross as head basketball coach, who was a successful local high school basketball coach as well as a college scout. In 1969-70 Wright State competed as a junior varsity team, then in the following year Coach Ross led the team on its inaugural campaign. For this 70-71 campaign Coach Ross brought on long-time Wright State coach Jim Brown as his assistant.\nThese early teams, much like the young university, had a do-it-yourself blue-collar ethos. Without a history or tradition to live up to, the teams took great pride in setting a foundation and creating the standard for all who would follow. Laundry was do-it-yourself, meals were typically cold sandwiches after practices that were late at night when gym time was available. Scholarships were limited and travel was often by van. It was the beginning.\nRoster.\nSources\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=|Regular season\nSources"

        "text": "The 2023 Rugby World Cup final was a rugby union match played on 28 October 2023 at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, France. It marked the culmination of the 2023 Rugby World Cup and was played between New Zealand and South Africa, with the latter winning by a single point to claim their fourth Webb Ellis Cup, becoming the first nation to do so. South Africa became the first team to ever win back to back Rugby World Cup tournaments away from home, with Siya Kolisi the first ever captain to accomplish the away double. \nNew Zealand and South Africa last played in a Rugby World Cup final in 1995, which South Africa won 15–12. The two sides had met in five previous World Cup encounters with New Zealand winning three and South Africa winning two. This was the first time that both finalists had already lost a game during the World Cup. For New Zealand this was a record fifth appearance in a final, while South Africa made a fourth appearance and also entered having never lost in a final.\nThe final saw South Africa win a record fourth World Cup title, with both sides having already won the World Cup on three occasions.\nRoute to the final.\nNew Zealand.\nNew Zealand began their World Cup campaign with a defeat to hosts France in the opening match of the tournament. They would put that result behind them as they went on to win by a considerable margin in all of their remaining pool matches to qualify for the knockout stage, with a 71–3 victory over Namibia, 96–17 against Italy, and 73–0 against Uruguay. In the quarter-finals, New Zealand faced Pool B winners and number 1 ranked in the world Ireland, where they came out winners in a tight affair with a scoreline of 28–24. In the semi-final at the Stade de France, New Zealand played Argentina, where The All Blacks defeated Los Pumas 44–6 to reach their fifth Rugby World Cup final, a record as they went ahead of Australia and England who had both reached four finals. The All Blacks were also looking for their record fourth Rugby World Cup title, having won in 1987 followed by victories in 2011 and 2015.\nSouth Africa.\nDefending champions South Africa had reached what was their fourth Rugby World Cup final following a spell of tight margins in the lead up. The Springboks had managed to breeze through Pool B, where despite falling at the Ireland hurdle in a 13–8 defeat, they secured victories over Scotland, Romania, and Tonga to finish second in the pool and advance to the knockout stage. In the quarter-finals, they faced the hosts France, who had topped Pool A ahead of New Zealand. In a World Cup thriller at the Stade de France, South Africa overcame their French counterparts with a 29–28 victory. In the semi-final, South Africa played England, in a repeat of the 2007 and 2019 final. In another tight affair in Saint-Denis, South Africa completed a comeback through a late Handré Pollard penalty to win 16–15 and advance to their fourth Rugby World Cup final where they would attempt to defend their trophy.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nFirst half.\nIn the 2nd minute, New Zealand's Shannon Frizell received a yellow card for falling on top of the leg of Bongi Mbonambi. Mbonambi was forced off for the remainder of the match with a knee injury.\nSouth Africa went on to take a 6–0 lead with two penalties converted by Handré Pollard before Richie Mo'unga scored for New Zealand with a penalty after 17 minutes. Pollard scored another penalty two minutes later to make it 9–3. \nIn the 28th minute, New Zealand's captain Sam Cane was given a yellow card for a high shoulder tackle to the head of South Africa's Jesse Kriel which was later upgraded to a red card after a bunker review. Pollard scored another penalty in the 34th minute before Mo'unga replied with his second penalty to leave the score 12–6 at half-time.\nSecond half.\nIn the 45th minute, South African captain Siya Kolisi received a yellow card for a head high tackle on Ardie Savea which was also reviewed for a potential red card. On review, it remained a yellow card. In the 54th minute, New Zealand thought that they had scored a try. Aaron Smith went over the try line in the left corner. However, the TMO review showed that the ball had been knocked on by Ardie Savea before it was released from the initial lineout.\nThey did get a try in the 58th minute. Beauden Barrett went over the try line on the left after an offload from Mark Telea, Richie Mo'unga missed the conversion from the left that would have put New Zealand in front. With 7 minutes to go, Cheslin Kolbe received a yellow card for a deliberate knock on and New Zealand missed the critical penalty to seal their victory. South Africa held on to win 12–11 and claim their fourth World Cup title.\nDetails.\nNotes:"

The tour was a one-off match between Australia and New Zealand at the Sydney Cricket Ground, Sydney. Considered the better side, and with the odds in their favour (6–4), New Zealand had only won five of their last ten fixtures against the Wallabies (50%). Australia were 9–10 outsiders, however, Wallabies coach Bob Dwyer commented: “The All Black aura of domination of five or six years ago is over... They were once supermen who couldn't be beaten but that All Black bogey doesn't exist any more.” New Zealand won the test 8–18. New Zealand coach Bryce Rope said that Australia and New Zealand were the two best rugby union teams in the world before the match. Wallaby coach, Bob Dwyer, insisted that Australia was the only team in the world (at the time) that could beat New Zealand, saying several days before the match, \"I honestly reckon we're about the only side in the world who can beat them.\" The match was also David Campese's fourth match against the All Blacks."

        "text": "The 2023 IBA Women's World Boxing Championships were the 13th edition of the championships, held in New Delhi, India from 15 to 26 March 2023.\nIndia topped the medal tally for the first time after 2006.\nMedal winners were awarded prize money; gold medallists earn $100,000, silver medallists $50,000, and bronze medallists $25,000. The overall prize fund was $2.4 million.\nThis event was boycotted by multiple nations due to participation of athletes from Russia and Belarus in light of Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nQualification System for Paris 2024.\nIn June 2022, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) barred the International Boxing Association's (IBA) rights to run and organize the tournament due to \"continuing irregularity issues in the areas of finance, governance, ethics, refereeing, and judging\". Hence, the IOC executive board established and ratified a new qualification system for Paris 2024 that would witness the boxers obtain the quota spots through the continental multisport events, reducing the complexity of the process. The qualification period commences at five regional multisport events in the middle of the 2023 season (2023 African Games in Accra, Ghana; 2022 Asian Games in Hangzhou, China; 2023 European Games in Poland; 2023 Pacific Games in Honiara, Solomon Islands; and the 2023 Pan American Games in Santiago, Chile), set to be served as continental qualifying meets, where a total of 139 spots will be assigned to a specific number of highest-ranked boxers in each weight category. For these reasons, this tournament does not give a quota for the Olympic Games.\nSchedule.\n\"All times are local (UTC+5:30)\".\nParticipating nations.\nThe following nations participate with total participation entries of 324:\nControversies.\nBoycott due to participation of athletes from Russia and Belarus.\nIgnoring Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and subsequent recommendations of the International Olympic Committee to bar Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing under their national flags and for the anthems to be played, the International Boxing Association under the leadership of Russian Umar Kremlev allowed them to compete with no restrictions. In the aftermath, 17 countries (19 national federations) decided to boycott the championship over IBA's decision.\nThe nations that boycotted the tournament were:\nAlleged discrimination of Kosovo boxer.\nKosovo withdrew its competitors from the championship as a result of alleged discrimination by the Indian authorities. Despite the Kosovo Boxing Federation being a full member of the IBA, local organisers decided to ban the use of the flag and national anthem of Kosovo at the championship, including in medal ceremonies and on team uniforms for political reasons. Kosovo's sole entrant, 2022 bronze medalist Donjeta Sadiku, also encountered problems in obtaining a visa to enter India for the competition. Sadiku was previously denied entry to India in 2017 for the Youth Women's World Championships and 2018 for the Women's World Championships. Kosovo's president Vjosa Osmani described the treatment of athletes from her country as a \"blatant violation of int'l sporting standards\" and urged the organisers to reconsider their decision. The IBA's media communications team termed the incident as \"unfortunate and the Indian government was also very cooperative, and the team was granted visas for the competitions. It was unfortunate to learn that the athletes of Kosovo declined the opportunity to come to New Delhi.\"\nNepali Boxer Anjani Teli.\nA question has been raised about Indian-born Nepali Boxer Anjani Teli. IBA had an investigation into allegations made against her. However, she was given a clean chit as she had never acquired an Indian passport. She was born in Delhi to migrated Nepali parents. And she received a Nepali passport at the age of 8 years as her parents were from Nepal. IBA has allowed her to continue participating in the tournament."

He is known as \"The Father of College Golf\" due to how he revolutionized the sport in the United States. As head coach of the Houston Cougars men's golf program, he won 16 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) team national championships and coached eight individual national champions.\nLife.\nWilliams was born in Randolph, Texas. Before becoming head coach at Houston, he was a professor in the engineering department at the university, having earned degrees from East Texas State Teachers College and the United States Naval Academy. After he began to beat then-UH athletic director Harry Fouke at golf on a regular basis, Fouke made him the head golf coach. He served in that position from 1952 to 1987.\nIn addition to winning 16 team national championships and eight individual ones, Williams' teams won 14 conference championships and 340 tournaments overall. Several of his players would go on to have professional golf careers, including Fred Couples, Steve Elkington, Nick Faldo, Butch Harmon, Bruce Lietzke, John Mahaffey, Dave Marr, Phil Rodgers, Bill Rogers and Fuzzy Zoeller. Future broadcaster Jim Nantz also played under him.\nWilliams' contributions to the sport live on to this day, as the scoring system he devised is used at the high school level all the way up to Division I. He was also the first coach to start outfitting his teams in the same uniforms featuring the school colors.\nWilliams died in Wharton, Texas in 1998. The Dave Williams Golf Academy at the Golf Club of Houston is named after him."

        "title": "2022 NCAA Beach Volleyball Championship",
        "text": "The 2022 NCAA Beach Volleyball Championship (officially the 2022 National Collegiate Beach Volleyball Championship) was an intercollegiate tournament to determine the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) women's beach volleyball national champion for the 202122 season. The sixth edition of the tournament was held from May 4 to 8, 2022, at Gulf Place Public Beach in Gulf Shores, Alabama. The 2022 championship featured a 16-team field for the first time, doubled from previous years, as well as the addition of an opening knockout round before the traditional eight-team double-elimination bracket. Eight of the participating schools automatically qualified by winning their respective conference tournaments, while the other eight were given either a regional or an at-large bid by the NCAA Women's Beach Volleyball Committee. The tournament was broadcast on ESPN2, ESPN3 and ESPNU.\nDefending champion USC Trojans were the pre-tournament favorites and entered as the top seed. They had a lineup that included the likes of 2020 Olympian Tina Graudina and then-reigning U19 world champions Megan Kraft and Delaynie Maple. The Trojans had a dominant run in the championship, dropping just one individual pairs match en route to the final. The biggest tournament upsets came from the tenth-seeded Georgia State Panthers, who beat the seventh-seeded Grand Canyon Antelopes and the second-seeded TCU Horned Frogs before being knocked out of the elimination bracket by the Loyola Marymount Lions. Meanwhile, scheduling changes due to inclement weather meant that the Florida State Seminoles ended up playing three duals on the third day of competition; the Seminoles suffered a loss to USC in the winners bracket before overcoming the LSU Tigers, Loyola Marymount Lions and UCLA Bruins in the elimination bracket to set up a rematch against the Trojans. In the championship dual, USC defeated Florida State 31 to win their fourth NCAA title. The final three days of the NCAA championship were attended by a live audience of 10,151, setting a new tournament record.\nBackground.\nThe National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) began sponsoring women's beach volleyball as a championship sport in 2016, and the sport has since experienced rapid growth at the collegiate level, with a 500 percent increase in women's collegiate beach volleyball programs in the United States from 2011 to 2020. The NCAA Beach Volleyball Championship is the tournament held at the end of every regular season to determine the women's national collegiate champion across all NCAA divisions. It has been held annually since the inaugural 2016 event, and 2022 marked its sixth edition. The 2022 tournament was held in Gulf Shores, Alabama, the same venue that hosted all five previous NCAA championships, and was co-hosted by Gulf Shores Orange Beach Sports &amp; Events, the city of Gulf Shores and the University of Alabama at Birmingham.\nPopularized on the beaches of California in the 1920s, beach volleyball is a sport played by two teams on a sand court. At the professional level, teams consist of a pair of players who compete in best-of-three-set matches, where the first two sets are played to 21 points and the third set, if necessary, is played to 15 points; each set must be won by a minimum two-point lead. Conversely, NCAA beach volleyball is played using a flighted team-dual format such that in an NCAA dual, each team fields five individual pairs who are ranked from 1 to No. 5 by skill level, and each pair plays a best-of-three-set match against their corresponding pair on the other team. The first team to win three of the five pairs' matches wins the dual.\nThe NCAA Beach Volleyball Championship had historically been an eight-team double-elimination tournament, in which all participating teams were selected by the NCAA Women's Beach Volleyball Committee. However, with the growing popularity of the collegiate sport, the NCAA doubled the field for the 2022 championship, adding a 16-team single-elimination opening round that led into the established eight-team double-elimination bracket. Along with the expanded field, the qualification process introduced eight automatic bids that teams earned by winning their respective conference tournaments.\nFormat and venue.\nThe 2022 NCAA Beach Volleyball Championship was a 16-team tournament held from May 4 to 8, 2022. The tournament began on Wednesday, May 4, with eight single-elimination duals. The winning teams then advanced to a double-elimination bracket that began play on Friday, May 6, until a national champion was determined on Sunday, May 8.\nThe tournament took place on one site at the Gulf Place Public Beach in Gulf Shores, which had been set up with five playing courts and five practice courts. Over the years, the playing conditions at the Gulf Shores venue have been characterized by several factors; namely the compact sand that makes it easier for players to move and jump, the strong winds, and the possibility of rain during that time of the year.\nParticipating teams.\nOf the 86 eligible NCAA teams, a total of 16 qualified for the tournament and were seeded from No. 1 to No. 16. Eight of the teams earned automatic bids by winning their respective conference tournaments. The remaining eight bids were allocated by the NCAA Women's Beach Volleyball Committee, with two teams from the eastern region of the country and two teams from the western region chosen as regional qualifiers, and the final four teams selected at large. The qualifying teams and seeding order were announced by the committee on April 30, 2022.\nAutomatic bids.\nThe following eight teams earned automatic bids by winning their conference tournament.\nRegional and at-large bids.\nThe following eight teams were allocated either a regional or an at-large bid by the NCAA selection committee.\nPreview.\nFrom its inception in 2016 to 2021, only two teams had won the NCAA Beach Volleyball Championship: the USC Trojans (three titles and defending champion: 2016, 2017, 2021) and the UCLA Bruins (two titles: 2018 and 2019). Both teams were in the running for the title once again in 2022. Led by Dain Blanton for the third year, USC had a much-heralded 202122 roster that was compared to the Marvel Comics' Avengers by \"Volleyball Magazine\" Travis Mewhirter. It included the likes of 2020 Olympian Tina Graudina of Latvia and then-reigning U19 world champions Megan Kraft and Delaynie Maple. Seeded No. 1 and topping the American Volleyball Coaches Association's (AVCA) rankings, the Trojans entered the NCAA tournament as the favorites to win. They were on a 31-dual winning streak, with their only dual loss coming at the start of the season to UCLA, whom they later beat in the Pac-12 final. Meanwhile, the Bruins were ranked third in the nation and received the No. 3 seed. A finalist at the 2021 NCAA championship, UCLA's roster featured six returning starters from last year's lineup, including AVCA first-team All-Americans Lexy Denaburg and Abby Van Winkle. Head coach Stein Metzger was in his tenth year with the program.\nIn the Coastal Collegiate Sports Association (CCSA), the fourth-ranked Florida State Seminoles had upset the second-ranked TCU Horned Frogs in the final to win their sixth consecutive conference title. Both teams headed to the NCAA tournament as the No. 5 and No. 2 seeds, respectively. The national runners-up in 2016 and 2018, Florida State's head coach Brooke Niles said it had been a rocky year for her team, which posted a 98 winloss record against the top-ten teams, including six losses to the top three. Meanwhile, TCU had started off the season with one of the most anticipated rosters thanks to several key transfers and freshmen recruited by head coach Hector Gutierrez, such as former European junior championship silver medalist Ana Vergara of Spain.\nRounding out the top six seeds were the Loyola Marymount Lions (No. 4) and LSU Tigers (No. 6). Loyola Marymount were coming off their third consecutive West Coast tournament win, and head coach John Mayer believed this was his program's \"most talent[ed]\" lineup yet. On LSU's side, there had been a lot of uncertainty over the team in the preseason. After a highly successful 202021 season, the Tigers experienced a huge turnover that resulted in the loss of eight of their ten previous starters. Led by head coach Russell Brock, LSU recorded just one win against one of the top five seeds over the regular season. Lee Feinswog, writing for \"Volleyball Magazine\", observed in his tournament preview that the top six seeds had dominated the 202122 season, having only suffered a combined total of 37 losses, mostly to each other.\nBracket.\nThe tournament bracket was as follows:\nDual summaries.\nWednesday.\nDay one of the competition saw all 16 teams competing on a five-court setup in the opening knockout round. Of the eight duals played, seven ended with the higher-seeded team winning. The only upset came when tenth-seeded Georgia State beat seventh-seeded Grand Canyon 32, marking the Panthers' first-ever dual win at the NCAA tournament. Grand Canyon took an early lead with a straight-set victory at the top pairs flight before Georgia State evened the dual with a three-set victory at the fourth flight. The deadlock continued as they split three-set victories at the No. 3 and No. 5 pairs. The deciding match came down to the second flight, where Georgia State's Eden Hawes and Maddy Delmonte came back from being one set down to win 13–21, 21–17, 16–14.\nLSU, Florida State and UCLA were all pushed to a deciding three-set match in their 32 dual victories. LSU were tied at two dual points apiece against California before their No. 5 pairing of Sierra Caffo and Ashlyn Rasnick-Pope defeated California's Natalie Martin and Alex Young-Gomez in three sets to give them the victory. Meanwhile, Florida State was tied 22 in their dual against Cal Poly when their No. 3 pairing of Anna Long and Kate Privett found themselves down 10–12 in the third-set tiebreaker of the deciding match. Long and Privett eventually turned the set around, winning 25–23, 21–16, 15–13 to clinch the dual for the Seminoles. Similarly, the UCLAStetson dual came down to the second pairs' court, where UCLA's Jaden Whitmarsh and Devon Newberry fell behind in the third set before rallying to beat their Stetson opponents 19–21, 21–16, 15–13. Stetson coach Kristina Hernandez said about the loss: \"We can't be disappointed with the effort. I thought we could pull it off again (like in 2019). But they're all freshmen and sophomores, so we'll be back.\"\nFlorida Atlantic, Loyola Marymount, USC and TCU all swept their lower-seeded opponents 30. In Florida Atlantic's case, it was the program's first-ever dual win at the championship. They defeated Stanford with a two-set victory on court No. 4 and three-set victories on courts No. 2 and No. 5. The Owls' head coach Capri Grotowski was cancer-stricken at the time and did not attend the dual, with her husband and assistant coach Steve Grotowski taking over her duties. TCU also saw their first NCAA tournament victory, knocking out A&amp;M-Corpus Christi without dropping a set. Meanwhile, USC extended their dual win streak to 32 with a dominant performance that left UT Martin unable to score more than 13 points a set.\nFriday.\nThe start of the eight-team double-elimination bracket on Friday was marked by rain delays and strong winds. The first matchup of the day saw USC's win streak continuenow at 33 consecutive dualsas they swept past Florida Atlantic 30. A rainstorm rolled in after this dual, delaying the subsequent matches and causing the last two winners bracket duals scheduled for the day to be moved to the next morning instead.\nWhen play resumed, three more winners bracket duals were completed. The first saw Florida State take on Loyola Marymount. The teams were level after Florida State's Alaina Chacon and Madison Fitzpatrick won the second pairs flight and Loyola Marymount's Isabelle Reffel and Jacinda Ramirez won the fifth. However, this was followed by two straight-set victories by Florida State's No. 1 and No. 3 pairs to give them the 31 dual win. After that, UCLA were untroubled by LSU, winning two-set matches at the first, third and fifth pairs flights to win the dual 30.\nThe final winners bracket dual of the day featured Georgia State pulling off another upset, this time relegating second-seeded TCU to the elimination bracket. TCU gained the early advantage, winning on the first and fifth courts, while also being up a set on the other three. However, the Georgia State pairs rallied to push the remaining matches to three sets. Angel and Bella Ferary scored the first dual point for Georgia State with a 1614 third set win on court No. 4. At the second pairs flight, Hawes and Delmonte tied the dual with a 1513 third set win. The deciding match came down to the No. 3 pairings, where Georgia State's Yasmin Kuck and Kayla Whetstone edged out their TCU opponents 1621, 2321, 1513. Georgia State's victory was the biggest upset in the tournament's history at the time. Post-match, their head coach Beth Van Fleet said: \"We just keep focusing on going 10. We're not trying to win a national championship. We're here to go 10 every time we play.\"\nIn the elimination bracket, Loyola Marymount and LSU won their duals to progress to the final six. The former had a swift 30 victory over Florida Atlantic, while the latter had a tougher battle against TCU. LSU fell behind early on and were down a set at the No. 1, 2, 4 and 5 pairs. They eventually lost at the first and fourth pairs flights, but rallied to win at the second and third, tying the score with TCU. The remaining match on court No. 5 finished soon after, with LSU's Caffo and Rasnick-Pope edging out their opponents 1816 in the third set. Having lost twice to TCU earlier in the season, LSU coach Brock said afterwards: \"I'd rather lose four times and come here and beat them and be extremely gratified and proud of these kids for battling that way.\"\nSaturday.\nThe third day of competition saw the field withered down to the final three. The day kicked off with the rescheduled winners bracket duals from the previous day. In the first dual, USC defeated Florida State 31. USC dropped their first match of the tournament at the second pairs flight when Kraft and Sammy Slater lost in two sets to Florida State's A. Chacon and Fitzpatrick; it was Kraft and Slater's first loss of the season. However, the defending champions won at the No. 1 (Graudina and Hailey Harward), No. 3 (Maple and Julia Scoles) and No. 4 (Audrey and Nicole Nourse) pairs to move on to the final round of the winners bracket. Next, UCLA sent Georgia State to the elimination bracket with a 30 victory. At the No. 3 pairs flight, UCLA's Lea Monkhouse and Jessie Smith scored the first dual point, continuing their undefeated run in the tournament with a 2117, 2113 win over Georgia State's Kuck and Whetstone. Their teammates at the first pairs (Denaburg and Van Winkle) and second pairs (Whitmarsh and Newberry) flights soon followed with their own straight set victories to end the dual.\nThe teams then had a five-hour break before it was time for the elimination bracket duals. Both Loyola Marymount vs. Georgia State and Florida State vs. LSU ended 31 in favor of the higher seeds. In the first dual, the Ferary sisters scored the first point for Georgia State on the fourth court. However, the Loyola Marymount pairings won the next three matches on courts No. 3, No. 2 and No. 5. The next team to advance was Florida State, who went 20 up over LSU with commanding wins from their No. 4 pairing of Morgan Chacon and Jordan Polo and their No. 1 pairing of Maddie Anderson and Brook Bauer. However, LSU's Holly Carlton and Reilly Allred came back from one set down to win their match on court three. With only the second and fifth flights remaining, Florida State had match points on both courts, and their No. 2 pairing of A. Chacon and Fitzpatrick ultimately won their match first to close out the dual.\nWith four teams left in the tournament, duals from here on out were played in staggered flights: the No. 2 and No. 4 pairs played their matches to completion first, followed by the No. 1, No. 3 and No. 5 pairs playing theirs to decision. In the final winners bracket round, USC and UCLA faced off for a guaranteed spot in the championship final. The Pac-12 rivals had already played each other five times this season, with the Bruins winning the first meeting and the Trojans the subsequent four. This time around, USC swept UCLA 30 to extend their dual win streak to 35. Their second (Kraft and Slater) and fourth (the Nourses) pairs both won their matches in straight sets, with Audrey Nourse saying afterwards: \"The mindset was to set the tone for our team. ... And we just wanted to go in super aggressive from the very beginning and play our game.\" The next round of staggered matches began and USC only needed one more pairs win, which they got on the first court when Graudina and Harward beat Denaburg and Van Winkle 2116, 2113. UCLA coach Metzger said after the dual: \"SC put together a really great match. They handled us.\"\nThe last matchup of the day was Florida State vs. Loyola Marymount. It was Florida State's third dual of the day due to the scheduling changes. Florida State's No. 2 (A. Chacon and Fitzpatrick) and No. 4 (M. Chacon and Polo) pairs gave them the lead after the first round of staggered matches, both winning in straight sets. The next three matches saw closer battles on courts one and three, but Florida State's fifth pairs flight of Caitlin Moon and Raelyn White defeated Loyola Marymount's Reffel and Ramirez 2119, 2114 to win the dual for the Seminoles.\nSunday.\nThe final round of the elimination bracket was between UCLA and Florida State to determine who would face USC for the NCAA title. The two teams had met twice earlier in the season, with UCLA winning 32 both times. This time, however, it was Florida State who came out on top after a \"marathon\" dual that was a toss-up until the very end. The first staggered flights featuring the No. 2 and No. 4 pairings were tightly contested, with the Bruins claiming the first set in both matches before the Seminoles fought back and forced third sets in both, eventually tying the dual score at 11. In the next round, the teams split straight-set victories at the No. 3 and No. 5 pairs to continue the stalemate. The match between the No. 1 pairings of UCLA's Denaburg and Van Winkle and Florida State's Anderson and Bauer would thus decide the dual. Anderson and Bauer won the first set 2116, but Denaburg and Van Winkle rebounded and won the second 2321. In the final set, Anderson and Bauer flipped an early one-point deficit and held on to their slim lead to win with a score of 1513. Post-dual, UCLA coach Metzger said: \"It felt like a week-long match. It was not a good start by us, but I have to credit them with righting the ship after a while and really settling into the game by making some incredible plays.\"\nChampionship dual.\nThe championship dual was a rematch between USC and Florida State. It was the former's fifth championship final and the latter's third. Once again, the second and fourth pairs flights played their matches first, with the Nourses getting the first win on court No. 4 for the Trojans. At the second pairs flight, USC's Kraft and Slater won the first set, but Florida State's A. Chacon and Fitzpatrick fought back to take the match 1421, 2422, 1715. Both teams were thus tied at one point apiece as the next three matches began. Graudina and Harward won their match on the No. 1 court in two sets next to give USC the lead. The defending champions were up a set on both of the remaining courts, and their No. 3 pairing of Maple and Scoles wrapped up the dual with a straight set win over Florida State's Long and Privett. The victory gave the Trojans their second consecutive NCAA title, and their fourth overall. They were undefeated the whole tournament and extended their streak to 36 dual wins in a row.\n\"Volleyball Magazine\"s Feinswog felt that USC's path to the national title did not come as easily as the results would suggest. He credited Florida State for putting up a fight till the end, noting that they had a particularly grueling final two days in the tournament due to the scheduling changes. Coach Niles agreed that her Florida State team \"fought for everything\", adding: \"I told my team, we're not hanging our heads low. We should be proud of that second-place trophy.\" After the victory, USC's Graudina said she was \"emotionally charged\" and ready for the next stage of her career. Her fellow graduating teammates Harward and Scoles also expressed their intention to pursue professional beach volleyball.\nPost-tournament honors and records.\nAll-Tournament Team.\nThe following pairs were named to the NCAA All-Tournament Team:\nIndividual match records.\nThe following individual match records were set.\nOther records.\nThe following pairs set the all-time record for most tournaments wins by a pair with four wins each:\nFlorida State also set the all-time record for total team pair wins with 18 wins.\nBroadcast and attendance.\nThe opening single-elimination round on May 4, 2022, and the double-elimination rounds on May 6 were broadcast live on ESPNU. The May 7 and 8 rounds, including the championship dual, were broadcast live on ESPN2. Additionally, all individual matches were livestreamed on ESPN3. Of the Sunday, May 8, broadcasts, the USCFlorida State championship dual was watched by 123,000 viewers, while the UCLAFlorida State dual was watched by 117,000 viewers.\nOver the May 68 three-day weekend, the NCAA championship was also attended by a live audience of 10,151, a tournament record and a nearly seven-percent increase from 2019. According to the Gulf Shores tourism board, this translated to an economic impact of $1.51 million for the host city."

        "title": "1931–32 Villanova Wildcats men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1931–32 Villanova Wildcats men's ice hockey season was the 3rd season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nIn just its third season, the Wildcats' ice hockey team was already on its third coach. Rev. Edward J. Carney O. S. A., a professor of religion at the college, agreed to helm the team after Ed Hunsinger declined to return due to a lack of available time. The team, however, was led by 3rd-year player and former team captain, Bill Orcutt along with Artie Shortall, the current captain. While the team knew coming into the season that it would have to contend with the loss of their top offensive player, 'Eskimo' Kennedy, they were hit by an even bigger impediment early in the season; a lack of cold weather. The warm winter meant that the team had precious little time to practice and get used to both the game and one another. Unfortunately, the temperatures continued to stay high and ended up causing the cancellation of their first scheduled game against the Atlantic City Sea Gulls.\nIt wasn't until late January, when ice time became available at the Philadelphia Ice Palace, that the team managed to get one the ice. Even then the Wildcats still had 12 games on their slate and would try to cram in as many contests as they could before season's end, though most of those would eventually be cancelled. Despite their efforts, Villanova didn't open their season until February, though they were able to win the opening match 4–0. The team travelled to Hershey, Pennsylvania for the next game versus the Athletic Club from Swarthmore. The Wildcats were down after the first half of the game but they were still within striking distance at 0–2. Midway through the second, Shortall was struck in the head by the puck and knocked out of the game. The Wildcats dragooned defenseman Jerry Searight into goaltending duty despite never having played the position before. While they didn't have any better options, the team was unable to make the situation work and surrendered a further 11 goals before the end of the match. The rematch a week later was a little better for Nova but the Wildcats still fell by a wide margin.\nAt the end of February, the team was back to full strength and faced the most common foe, the Penn Athletic Club. The two teams fought a tight battle for the entire game but Villanova had a lead in the waning minutes of the game. Looking for their first win in 6 matches, the Wildcats were unable to hold their lead and surrendered the tying goal late. The momentum stayed with the Pennacs in overtime and Villanova couldn't stop their opponents from netting the winning marker. Villanova ended its season on a high note with a win over Boonton A. C., however, that did little to save the program.\nWhile the weather had been a problem all season, that was not the program's biggest problem. The team was forced to share its home ice with a litany of other teams both amateur and professional. The result, other than a distinct lack of ice time, was that many of the team games over the past two years were played away from Philadelphia and did not help the team financially. Additionally, because the team was on the road so often, they were unable to generate much in the way of support from the student body. While their losing records didn't help, wins in remote location were akin to a tree falling in a forest and, for an expensive sport in the middle of the great depression that was a huge impediment. To make matters worse, there were virtually no local colleges playing ice hockey, leaving Villanova with no contemporaries to play. With all of those issues, the team suspended operations after the year and Villanova didn't play another varsity game for over 50 years.\nCharlie Hurlburt, a player from last year's team, was injured during the football season and unable to play this year. However, he did stay with the program, working as the team manager.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but George Washington's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons.

        "title": "Larry Rivers (basketball)",
        "text": "Larry Darnell Rivers (May 6, 1949 – April 29, 2023), also known as Gator Rivers, was an American basketball player, coach, business owner, and civil servant. He performed as a dribbler for the Harlem Globetrotters from 1973 to 1986, eventually taking over the main dribbler role from Curly Neal. As player-coach during his last year with the Globetrotters, he led the team's nationwide search for their first female player. \nAfter stints with two other exhibition basketball teams, Rivers moved back to St. Joseph, Missouri, where he went to college, and started the Gatorball Academy, teaching basketball skills to children. In 2008, he moved to his native Savannah, Georgia, where he had led the Beach High School basketball team to three state titles. In 2020, he was elected to the Chatham County Commission in Chatham County, Georgia and served in the District 2 seat from 2021 until his death.\nEarly life.\nRivers grew up in Savannah, Georgia with his mother, who was 13 years old when he was born. He first saw \"The Harlem Globetrotters\" film at the age of seven and was inspired by the dribbling technique of Marques Haynes. The nickname \"Gator\" originated while playing pool tag as a child because he was unable to swim as well as his friends.\nAt the age of 14, Rivers quit school to manage a pool hall, but was persuaded by basketball coach Russell Ellington to re-enroll at Alfred E. Beach High School and lived with him for the rest of his high school career.\nEducation and early basketball career.\nIn 1967, during his sophomore year at Beach High School, Rivers was part of the first all-black team to win a Georgia High School Association championship in any sport; it was the GHSA's first season of desegregation. Playing under Ellington, Rivers went on to lead the Beach High School basketball team to three state titles. In his senior year, he averaged 17 points and 9 assists per game. He also developed a reputation for his dribbling skills, leading to fans calling for \"Gator Rivers show time\" late in their games once Beach High School had established a sizable lead against their opponents. He graduated in 1969, having gained recognition as an all-city, all-region, and all-state athlete. \nRivers became a small college all-American at Moberly Junior College and went on to play as a guard at Missouri Western State University, then known as Missouri Western State College. During the 1971–1972 season, he averaged 14.6 points per game. In his final season, he averaged 16.4 points per game, and set records for the most points (429) and most assists (181) in a single season. He was selected as an all-conference guard, and received an all-American honorable mention.\nIn 1973, the \"St. Joseph Gazette\" called Rivers \"the most talented ballhandler to ever wear a Missouri Western uniform\". Rivers later said that he chose the school, despite the snow and ice, in part because the Midwest promoter for the Harlem Globetrotters lived in St. Joseph, Missouri.\nExhibition basketball career.\nHarlem Globetrotters.\nIn March 1973, Rivers impressed the Harlem Globetrotters during a tryout in Topeka, Kansas. Both Clown Prince Meadowlark Lemon and Curly Neal praised his natural talent, while Tex Harrison later recalled that Rivers \"was doing things it takes other players four or five years to be accomplished at.\" Rivers frequently told the story of how Marcus Haynes had tested his dribbling skills in a folding-chair closet, and how he had dribbled around chairs and under tables to demonstrate his ability to control the ball around obstacles. At 6 ft (1.83 m) in height, Rivers was the shortest member of the Globetrotters when he joined. He toured with Globetrotters from 1973 to 1977 and took a two-year hiatus to assist with coaching and recruiting at Missouri Western, rejoining the Globetrotters in 1979.\nFor many years, Rivers shared routines with Curly Neal, until Neal was sidelined due to injury and Rivers took over in the main dribbler role in 1982 at the age of 32. That year, the Harlem Globetrotters became the first athletic team to be honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Rivers partnered with a Burger King franchise to create the \"Burger King / Gator Rivers Basketball Scholarship\". In 1984, he appeared with four other Globetrotters in an episode of \"The Love Boat.\" \nIn 1985, Rivers started his first year as a player-coach with the Globetrotters, and worked with his former coach Russell Ellington. Rivers led tryouts during the Globetrotters' nationwide search for one or two female players to perform alongside the men for the first time in their 60-year history. However, in 1986, Rivers left the Globetrotters, citing his disillusionment with their direction under new management. One of his frustrations was that while he had been searching for a highly skilled female player who could play with the male players and be respected, Globetrotter management instead went with a player they had in mind from the start, who had publicly stated that she would not have been able to \"make it\" in the NBA.\nShooting Stars.\nIn February 1986, Rivers joined the Shooting Stars, a new exhibition basketball team formed by Meadowlark Lemon. The team also featured other former Globetrotters such as Curly Neal and Jerry \"Lovebug\" Venable and former NBA star Pete Maravich. Rivers and the team were invited to the White House, where they announced the start of their 1986 Commitment With a Purpose Tour and their support of First Lady Nancy Reagan's campaign encouraging children to \"Just Say No\" to drugs.\nBasketball Magic.\nBy January 1987, Rivers had signed with a new team called Basketball Magic, along with six other former Harlem Globetrotters, including Louis \"Sweet Lou\" Dunbar, Jimmy Blacklock, Ovie Dotson, Osborne Lockhart, Billy Ray Hobbley, and Robert \"Baby Face\" Page. The team had formed after several players from the 1985–1986 starting lineup were unable to agree on a new contract with Harlem Globetrotter management.\nCoaching and other ventures.\nGatorball Academy.\nAfter retiring from touring, Rivers eventually returned to St. Joseph, Missouri, and lived for a few years in King City. In 1990, he founded Gatorball Academy, where he taught basketball skills and rules to children between the ages of 9 and 14. He also volunteered as a youth basketball coach, and was a popular speaker at local elementary schools. He would often invite children to try to steal the ball from him while he was dribbling, but maintained that they never succeeded.\nHigh school coaching.\nIn the early 1990s, Rivers coached basketball at Bishop LeBlond High School with a 110–25 record over five seasons, and led the team to the Missouri Class 2A final four in the 1993–1994 season. In 1995, he became head coach at Troy High School across the river in Kansas where his stepdaughter played basketball.\nThe Paris Club.\nIn March 1996, Rivers became owner and manager of the Paris Club, a nightclub on Felix Street in downtown St. Joseph featuring both DJ and live music, which he ran with his then-wife Rita. He told the \"St. Joseph News-Press\" that year that he envisioned developing an atmosphere similar to The Apollo In Harlem. By 1999, the club had moved from its original location and changed its name.\nCommunity involvement and political career.\nIn 1999, Rivers was inducted into the Greater Savannah Athletic Hall of Fame, and moved back to Savannah, Georgia, permanently in 2008. He continued to run Gatorball Academy training sessions to teach basketball skills to young players and led a campaign to rebuild and improve outdoor basketball courts in neighborhoods across Savannah, such as the one at Crawford Court. He also volunteered with the Frank Callen Boys and Girls Club.\nIn 2020, Rivers ran as a Republican for Chatham County Commission District 2 in Georgia and was declared the technical winner after Democratic candidate Tony Riley was disqualified due to a past felony conviction. During campaigning, Rivers claimed that he was running as a Republican to avoid having to run in the Democratic primary. He expressed interest in bringing a professional basketball team, as well as soccer and hockey teams, to Savannah to help boost the local economy. According to Chatham County Commission chairman Chester A. Ellis, \"As a Commissioner, his passion was ensuring that residents have food security and improving quality of life.\" \nPersonal life and death.\nRivers died of cancer on April 29, 2023, at the age of 73. On May 12, the Chatham County Commission appointed his wife Jean Brown Rivers to fill his seat until a special election could be held on September 19."

        "text": "The Minden team was a minor league baseball team based in Minden, Nebraska. In 1903, the \"Minden\" team played as charter members of the five-team independent Central Nebraska League in the league's only season of play. Minden was without a formal nickname, common in the era and placed fifth in the Central Nebraska League final standings. \nMinden hosted 1903 minor league home games at the Minden Grounds.\nHistory.\nIn the 1903 season, Minden, became charter members of the short–lived five-team Central Nebraska League, which played as an Independent level league. The Central Nebraska League played as a five–team league during their one season of minor league play.\nThe five members of the 1903 Central Nebraska League included Minden, who were joined by the Nebraska-based teams of Giltner, Holdrege Silver Aces, McCook and the Red Cloud Indians in league play. The 1903 \"Minden\" team was without a formal nickname, as was common in the era.\nMinden started the 1903 season with a 0–4 record in standings published on June 17, 1903. Beginning the season, the league called itself the Southwestern Nebraska Baseball League in the published standings.\nOn June 15, 1903, Minden lost a home game to McCook by a score of 5–0. Sam Leatherby pitched for Minden in the loss. White was the Minden catcher. The game was played in 1:15.\nMcCook again defeated Minden on June 16, 1903, in a game at Minden. Ollie Ahlin pitched for Minden in a 6–4 loss, with 8 strikeouts. White was the Minden catcher.\nMinden improved to an overall record of 3–4 in the league standings published on June 26, 1903.\nOn July 1, 1903, Giltner defeated Minden 6–0. On July 2, 1903, Giltner again defeated Minden by a score of 7–3.\nIn Central Nebraska League standings published on July 3, 1903, Minden had a 3–7 record and were in fourth place in the five–team league. Minden had a 3–11 record in the July 10, 1903 standings, remaining in fourth place.\nOn the 4th of July 1903, Holdrege and Minden played a doubleheader at Minden, with Minden winning both games. It was noted the games were the most attended at Minden. Minden won the first game by a score of 3–0 and the second game 10–4. In previous games in the series, Holdrege defeated Minden by scores of 6–3 and 11–10.\nMinden defeated Giltner by a score of 9–6 on Friday July 17, 1903.\nOn Monday, July 20, 1903, at a home game, Minden was defeated by McCook 9–3. Bates pitched for Minden with 5 strikeouts and 6 walks, pitching to White at catcher. Minden had three runs on nine hits in the loss, in a game with one umpire.\nMcCook defeated Minden again on July 21. Playing at home, Minden was defeated 7–0. Sam Letheby pitched for Minden and had 7 strikeouts, with White at catcher in the loss.\nOn July 22, 1903, Minden played an Arapahoe, Nebraska team, losing the non-league game by the score of 6–0.\nThe last Central Nebraska League standings were published on July 24, 1903, shortly before Minden disbanded, along with Giltner. The last published standings showed Minden in fifth place with a 7–15 record, 12.0 games behind first place Holdredge and McCook, who both had 19–7 records on that date. Red Cloud and McCook disbanded shortly after Minden and Giltner, leaving only Holdrege, who became a traveling team to finish the season.\nThe 1903 Central Nebraska League folded on August 4, 1903, after a game between Holden and McCook. Holdredge was scheduled to continue play teams in Iowa after the folding of the league. Holdrege added Ollie Ahlin and Bobby Gaines, two \"well known\" players from the Minden team to its roster after Minden folded with the Central Nebraska League.\nThe Central Nebraska League permanently folded after the 1903 season, Minden included. Minden, Nebraska has not hosted another minor league team.\nThe ballpark.\nThe Minden home ballpark was referred to as the \"Minden Grounds.\" With the Chautauqua Park as the only known park in Minden in the era, the ballpark was likely located within. Numerous Chautauqua parks were reported to have been built in the region in 1902, with the Kearney County Chautauqua Association owning the parcel in Minden. Chautauqua Park is the oldest public park in Minden. The park is still in use today with a historic bandshell, located at 7th Street and Minden Avenue, Minden, Nebraska.\nNotable alumni.\nNo alumni of the 1903 Minden team advanced to the major leagues."

The 28 other teams were placed in Pots 2 to 8, also according to their world ranking. The draw sequence began with Pot 1 and ended with Pot 8, with Pots 1,4,5, and 8 feeding Groups A, C, E, and G, while Pots 2,3,6, and 7 filled up Groups B, D, F, and H. A competition number was drawn for each team, which determined its position in the group and the order of games in each group.\nPersonnel involved.\nThe 32 participating teams were drawn into eight groups of four. As agreed by the Local Organizing Committee, hosts China was drawn in Group A while the defending champions United States was allocated to Group E.\nFIBA Basketball World Cup 2019 Global Ambassador Kobe Bryant and Chinese idol singer Yang Chaoyue led the draw ceremony.\nSeeding.\nTeams were seeded using the February 2019 FIBA World Rankings (shown in parentheses), which were published on 26 February 2019, after the sixth window of the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup qualification process.\nCanada was moved from Pot 5 to Pot 6, switching places with Iran (the best-ranked team from that pot) to avoid having two teams from the Americas in the same group. The highest-ranked team not to qualify for the World Cup was seventh-ranked Slovenia, who participated at the last World Cup in 2014 and were the EuroBasket 2017 champions at the time of the draw. Slovenia would eventually qualify for the 2023 edition.\nFinal draw.\nThe eight groups were formed randomly, selecting one team from each of the eight pots, and allocating them to an assigned group depending on which pot the team is located. Two teams from the same confederation cannot be placed into the same group, with the exception of teams from Europe, where a minimum of one team but no more than two teams could be in the same group.

        "text": "The 2024 NCAA Division I men's basketball championship game was the final game of the 2024 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. It determined the national champion for the 2023–24 NCAA Division I men's basketball season and was contested by the Purdue Boilermakers from the Big Ten Conference and the UConn Huskies from the Big East Conference. The game was played on April 8, 2024, at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.\nThe game began with each team holding the lead for short periods of time. After the score was tied at eleven points apiece, UConn took the lead on a shot by Tristen Newton, though later shots by Zach Edey and Braden Smith gave Purdue the lead with eight minutes left in the first half. Field goals afterwards by Newton, Donovan Clingan, and Stephon Castle resulted in a six-point UConn lead at halftime. The lead grew to nine points a short time into the second half and soon expanded to thirteen, though two shots by Edey brought it back to nine for a short time. UConn pulled away after shots by Alex Karaban and Hassan Diarra and the Huskies ultimately led by seventeen with under eight minutes to play. Later in the half, Purdue went on a run of six unanswered points which was ended with two free throws by Newton. Despite three field goals by Edey in the final minutes of the game, UConn's Clingan and Castle scored the final points of the game to make the final score 75–60 in favor of the Huskies.\nUConn's victory marked their second consecutive national championship, making them the first team to do so since Florida did so in 2006 and 2007.\nParticipants.\nPurdue Boilermakers.\nThe Boilermakers, representing Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, received a No. 3 ranking in the preseason AP Poll, after having been upset in the previous tournament by the #16 seeded Fairleigh Dickinson University, becoming the second #1 seed to lose in the first round. They won the Maui Invitational championship after victories over No. 11 Gonzaga, No. 7 Tennessee, and No. 4 Marquette. They defeated No. 1 Arizona before entering conference play. The Boilermakers finished Big Ten Conference play with a 17–3 record against conference opponents and were seeded first in the conference tournament, where they were eliminated by Wisconsin in the semifinals.\nPurdue was seeded No. 1 in the Midwest Region of the NCAA tournament, where they defeated No. 16 Grambling State in the first round. They beat No. 8 Utah State to make the Sweet Sixteen and there defeated No. 5 Gonzaga. The Boilermakers beat No. 2 Tennessee in the regional final, qualifying them for the Final Four for the first time since 1980. In the national semifinal, they defeated the tournament's Cinderella team, No. 11 NC State, to reach the national championship for the first time since 1969.\nConnecticut Huskies.\nThe Huskies, representing the University of Connecticut in Storrs, Connecticut, entered the season as defending national champions and ranked No. 6 in the preseason AP Poll. They won the Empire Classic championship over No. 15 Texas but suffered their first loss several weeks later against No. 5 Kansas. The Huskies lost their Big East Conference opener against Seton Hall but won all but one of their remaining games to finish with an 18–2 conference mark. In the Big East tournament, they were seeded No. 1 and won all three games en route to a championship.\nUConn received the No. 1 overall seed in the NCAA tournament and defeated No. 16 Stetson and No. 8 Northwestern in the first and second rounds, respectively. The Sweet Sixteen saw UConn defeat No. 5 San Diego State in a rematch of the 2023 national championship. A win over No. 3 Illinois sent them to the Final Four, where they defeated No. 4 Alabama to reach the national championship.\nGame summary.\nPurdue controlled the opening tip-off and scored the first points of the game on a jump shot by Trey Kaufman-Renn one minute later. The teams traded baskets for several minutes before UConn tied the game at five with a pair of free throws by Tristen Newton; a jumper by Cam Spencer shortly afterwards gave the Huskies their first lead. Field goals by Zach Edey, Donovan Clingan, and Spencer over the next few possessions led to another tie at 11–11 before a three-point shot by Newton put the Huskies ahead by three points. Edey and Hassan Diarra traded baskets, each making two from the floor, leading to a two-point UConn lead with twelve minutes remaining in the half. After a Braden Smith jumper, Diarra scored another three-pointer to return UConn to a three-point lead, though several shots by Edey and Smith put Purdue ahead 23–21 nearing eight minutes to play. UConn answered with five unanswered points from Newton and Clingan. The UConn lead jumped to five points on a layup by Newton and a jumper by Stephon Castle increased it to seven with three and a half minutes remaining. UConn maintained this lead for the remainder of the first half; another field goal by Castle with forty-nine seconds left was the last made shot before halftime. At the break, UConn led 36–30.\nUConn began the second half with possession and began the scoring through Newton; after shots by Kaufman-Renn and Castle, UConn's lead held at nine points. At the first TV timeout of the half, the Huskies led 43–34 and they expanded the lead to thirteen points shortly after on two dunks by Samson Johnson. Edey scored the game's next four points, followed by shots made by Spencer and Newton to restore the thirteen-point advantage. A Diarra foul with ten minutes to play gave Smith two free throws, which he made, but Alex Karaban's three-pointer and Diarra's jumper on UConn's next two possessions pushed their lead to sixteen points. At the media timeout with under eight minutes remaining in the game, UConn led by seventeen. Out of the timeout, each team went on a run of four straight points: first Purdue, then UConn, leaving the score 63–46. They traded shots over the next two minutes and UConn pushed the lead to eighteen points with under four minutes to play. Six straight points scored by the Boilermakers narrowed their deficit to thirteen points but two free throws by Newton ended the streak. Edey scored three dunks over the next minute but was unable to cut into the UConn lead due to scores by Clingan and Castle, the last of which made the score 75–60 in favor of the Huskies. This lead held for the final forty-five seconds of the game, allowing UConn to claim their second straight national championship.\nFinal Four all-tournament team.\nSource:\nMedia coverage.\nThe championship game was televised in the United States by TBS. Ian Eagle provided play-by-play, while Bill Raftery and Grant Hill both provided color commentary. Tracy Wolfson served as the sideline reporter. This was the first national championship game since 1990 in which Jim Nantz was not performing play-by-play duties. Former college basketball referee Gene Steratore provided rules analysis throughout the game.\nAftermath.\nUConn's victory marked their sixth overall and second consecutive national championship, making them the first team to repeat as champions since Florida did so in 2006 and 2007. They were the first overall No. 1 seed to win the tournament since Louisville in 2013 (which was vacated). The title was the second for UConn head coach Dan Hurley; he joined John Wooden, Mike Krzyzewski, and Billy Donovan as the only coaches to have won back-to-back national championships."

These athletes are listed below, with the number of times they competed in each sport. Sometimes they competed in two disciplines at the same Games; such instances are noted.\nThe most common combinations of disciplines are biathlon/cross-country skiing (96 athletes), cross-country skiing/Nordic combined (82 athletes), Nordic combined/ski jumping (57 athletes) and cross-country skiing/Nordic combined/ski jumping (31 athletes).\n19 of these (12 males and 7 females) have won medals in 2 different sports but only 5 athletes (3 males: Johan Grøttumsbråten, Heikki Hasu and Thorleif Haug; 2 females: Ester Ledecká and Anfisa Reztsova) won gold medals in 2 different sports.\nOf these 5 athletes, only 3 (Johan Grøttumsbråten, Thorleif Haug and Ester Ledecká) were able to win gold medals in different sport at the same Olympic Games.\nList of athletes.\nN.B.: Alfred Aufdenblatten, Antenore Cuel, Otto Furrer, Alfons Julen, Herbert Leupold, Maurice Mandrillon, Ville Mattila, Reidar Ødegaard, Daniele Pellissier, Szczepan Witkowski and Robert Zurbriggen have participated at the military patrol at the Winter Olympics but it was just a demonstrative sport, so it's not clear if their Olympic appearance in military patrol is official or not (if it wouldn't be official they have to be eliminated from this list). Even Josef Bím, Niculae-Cornel Crăciun, Bronisław Czech, Esko Järvinen, Bohumil Kosour, Otakar Německý, Ole Stenen and Adrien Vandelle have participated at the military patrol and so be considered in this list but they wouldn't be eliminated from this table because they have participated at 3 or more \ndifferent Winter sports.\nBy nation.\nIn the next list there are the athletes of the table divided by nation. The total of this table is 386 because 19 athletes have competed for more than one nation: 16 athletes for 2 nations (Helmut Böck, Mihaela Cârstoi, Niculae-Cornel Crăciun,Ophélie David, Dumitru Frățilă, Aleksander Grajf, Simone Greiner-Petter-Memm, Katrin Gutensohn, Heinz Hauser, Stanley Hayer, Ileana Ianoșiu-Hangan, Nastassia Kinnunen, Oļegs Maļuhins, Aleksandra Rodionova, Adina Țuțulan-Șotropa and Ruslan Zakharov); 3 athletes for 3 nations (Evgeni Klimov, Anfisa Reztsova and Sergei Tchepikov).\nUncertain athletes.\nThe next 47 athletes have an uncertain status: they haven't participated at one (or more) of 2 or more sports but their appearance in the Olympic official website is considered official. Some of them have an appearance in an unofficial Olympic sport or in a demonstrative sport. Some of them have been already included in the list above. There are also some contrasts between Olympedia and the Olympics official website regarding the number of appearances.\nSports in \"italics\" are those sports that are considered as official in the Olympics website or Olympedia but the athletes haven't participated at them (or 1 out of more times)."

        "title": "David Webber (basketball)",
        "text": "David Ranier Webber (born April 5, 1980) is an American former basketball player. He played college basketball for Central Michigan of the Mid-American Conference (MAC) from 1998 to 2002. Webber played the point guard position and was the 2001 Mid-American Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year. He was a first team All-MAC player in 2001 and an honorable mention All-MAC player in 2000 and 2002. Webber holds Central Michigan's all-time records for single-game free throws and home arena single-game points.\nIn high school, Webber won three Michigan High School Athletic Association (MHSAA) championships for Detroit Country Day School. He had a brief two-year professional career in the United States Basketball League and Continental Basketball Association. He is the youngest brother of Hall of Famer Chris Webber.\nEarly life.\nWebber is the son of Mayce Webber, Jr. and Doris Webber. Doris, a teacher, and Mayce, a General Motors employee, had provided for and forced their children to attend the private academy Detroit Country Day School rather than Southwestern High School like other kids in the neighborhood. At Detroit Country Day, Webber was teammates with his brother Jason as a 1994–95 freshman while his brother was a senior. He performed the role of sixth man as a freshman before becoming a three-year starter. His 1996–97 junior season teammates included Shane Battier, who was a class ahead of him and classmates Javin Hunter and Mike Manciel. That team was the two-time MHSAA Class B defending champion and had climbed into the top 10 in the \"USA Today\" national poll prior to an injury to Battier and two subsequent losses. The team lost a third game without Battier and another starter to the Sergio McClain-led Illinois High School Association state champion Manual High School. The team healed up and repeated as Class B state champion, finishing the season with a 25–3 record. He described the pressure of being Chris' younger brother as having a severe impact on his mental state: “I can remember being in my house after another bad game during my junior year in high school, when I told God not to wake me up in the morning,” David said. “I was praying all night, for hours, saying, ‘God, please don’t wake me up.’ “I felt a lot of pressure and I didn’t feel like I could take it anymore.”\nWebber was only the third leading returning scorer (10.1 points per game) for the team that the \"USA Today\" described as \"Favorite for fourth consecutive Class B title\" when ranking them 15th in the preseason. However, he often played a leading role during his senior season. In fact, he averaged 20 points over the first six games before focusing more on his role as the floor general because he felt the team had more success with him scoring less. He averaged 14 points over the course of the season and led the team in assists and blocked shots. Following the season, he earned Class B Second Team All-State recognition from \"The Detroit News\" and an All-USA Basketball Honorable Mention by \"USA Today\". As of March 26, 1998, Webber was being recruited by Central Michigan, Eastern Michigan, Boston College, Virginia and Maryland. On April 15, the \"Detroit News\" reported that he signed his National Letter of Intent with Central Michigan, who had already signed the team's leading scorer, Manciel.\nCollege career.\nWebber joined the 1998–99 CMU team the same season his brother, Jason, transferred there from Michigan State. Jason had redshirted for the 1995–96 Michigan State Spartans and played for the 1996–97 team. At Central Michigan, Webber and his brother Jason were coached by Jay Smith, who had been on the coaching staff for the Michigan Wolverines men's basketball teams that their oldest brother, Chris, played on. Manciel, who had played with him at Detroit Country Day, matriculated to CMU with David.\nWebber holds the Central Michigan record for McGuirk Arena single-game points (51 vs. Ball State February 24, 2000), breaking the previous arena record set on December 5, 1977 by Larry Bird (45 points), which remained the visiting player record as of the March 2020 update of the Central Michigan Record Book. Webber's 51-point performance was the sixth-highest single-game point total in MAC history at the time. It was also the second-highest point total (highest in regulation) of the 1999–2000 NCAA Division I men's basketball season, trailing only 61 by Eddie House in double-overtime for against .\nOn February 11, 2001, he became one of 15 finalists (along with Battier) for the Oscar Robertson Trophy, presented by the U.S. Basketball Writers Association. At the time, Central Michigan was on a 10-game winning streak (17–4); Webber was averaging 20.2 points per game, and the team had clinched its first winning season since Dan Majerle's 1987–88 senior season. He led the MAC in scoring (18.4 ppg) for the 2000–01 season and was the 2001 Mid-American Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year. That season, he led Central Michigan in scoring, rebounding (5.2), assists (2.8) and steals (1.5). His Associated Press 2001 All-American honorable mention made him the second CMU player to receive any type of NCAA All-American recognition (Majerle) and third overall All-American (NAIA). He was a first team All-MAC player in 2001 and an honorable mention All-MAC player in the 1999–2000 and 2001–02 MAC seasons. He led Central Michigan in scoring all three of those seasons (19.2, 18.4, 17.7).\nPrior to 2001, no MAC team had ever gone from last to first in a single season turnaround, but the 1999–2000 Chippewas (6–23, 2–16) put the subsequent team in position to do so. With support from a bench that included Chris Kaman, he led (20–8, 14–4) to a first-place finish that marked the first time in MAC history a team had gone from worst-to-first. The 14.5 game turnaround was second in the nation to Boston College's 15 game turnaround.\nThe March 2020 update of the Central Michigan Record Book also shows that he holds the Central Michigan record for single-game free throws made (19, vs. 2OT January 5, 2002). During his college career, he started 108 of the 109 games that he played in, and he posted double figures 84 times. He was voted team MVP 3 times. In 2012, Webber was inducted into the CMU Athletics Hall of Fame.\nProfessional career.\nThe Detroit Pistons held workouts in May 2002 for point guards that Webber participated in. Webber went undrafted in the June 26, 2002 NBA draft. He subsequently participated in the Indiana Pacers minicamp in July 2002. Webber attended the October 2002 Sacramento Kings training camp when his brother, Chris, played for the team and survived the first cut. However, in late October, he was released along with Jason Sasser and Corsley Edwards when the Kings reduced their roster to 14 players.\nIn 2003, Webber played five games for the Oklahoma Storm of the United States Basketball League. Webber was selected by the Asheville Altitude in the 10th round of the 2003 NBA Development League draft. At the team's 16-man training camp he was vying for the point guard position against Andre Smith, Kareem Reid, and Jaquay Walls. On November 13, 2003, Webber was cut when the roster was reduced from 16 players to 12 along with other lower (7th and 9th) draft picks. On January 15, 2004, Webber signed with the Great Lakes Storm of the Continental Basketball Association. In 21 games with them, he averaged 6.7 points, 2.0 rebounds and 3.3 assists per game.\nPersonal life.\nWebber has 3 older brothers (Chris, Jeffrey and Jason) and a younger sister (Rachel). He was a teammate of his brother Jason at Central Michigan and Detroit Country Day. Jason played college basketball at Michigan State (1996–97) and Central Michigan (1998–2000). Chris and David were close, and David is credited with Chris' mid-career free throw shooting improvement."

Made up exclusively of Haitians living in Canada, the Haitian team is an unofficial national team outside the IIHF and has so far played in only one international game.\nHistory.\nHaiti played a friendly match against Lebanon on 23 April 2017 in Saint-Laurent, a borough of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, with both teams making their international debut. The Haitian team was defeated by the Lebanese team, 7–4. Former NHL player Georges Laraque, whose parents were born in Haiti, played for the Haitian team, among others. The Haitian team was coached by a Canadian former minor-league player Robert Haddock. While Haiti maintains a ball hockey national team that has played at the Ball Hockey World Championship, there is currently no governing body for ice hockey in the country.\nHaitian-born players overseas.\nMost notable players of Haitian-origin have played in Canada. Claude Vilgrain played in 89 games for five seasons in the NHL with the Vancouver Canucks, New Jersey Devils and Philadelphia Flyers, Maxime Boisclair played in 176 games for eight seasons in the Quebec-based minor league, Ligue Nord-Américaine de Hockey, and Zack Stringer currently plays for the Regina Pats in the Canadian major junior league, Western Hockey League. Vilgrain additionally represented Canada at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary. André Mattsson, also of Haitian-origin, played for 13 seasons in several Swedish leagues (Elitserien, HockeyAllsvenskan and Division 2). Vilgrain, Boisclair, Stringer and Mattsson were all born in Port-au-Prince."

It set the stage for the round-robin group stage in the Philippines, Japan, and Indonesia, where the World Cup will be played. \nThe 32 teams were seeded into eight pots of four for the draw. As hosts of the final phase, the Philippines were placed in Pot 1, alongside the FIBA World Rankings' three highest-ranked teams. The 28 other teams, including co-host Japan, were placed in Pots 2 to 8, also according to their world ranking. The draw sequence began with Pot 1 and ended with Pot 8. Teams from Pots 1, 3, 5, and 7 were drawn into Groups A, C, E and G, while teams from Pots 2, 4, 6 and 8 were drawn into Groups B, D, F and H. A competition number was drawn from each team to determine its position in the group and the order of games in each group.\nDespite being one of the three hosts, Indonesia was not able to qualify for the tournament as they neither advanced to the second round of the Asian Qualifiers nor met FIBA's condition of finishing as quarterfinalists at the 2022 FIBA Asia Cup, which they hosted, marking this the first World Cup where a host nation has not qualified.\nPersonnel involved.\nThe 32 nations participating in the 2023 World Cup were drawn into eight groups of four. The two qualified host teams, the Philippines and Japan, alongside the three preferred teams each host country selected to host, the United States chosen by the Philippines, Slovenia chosen by Japan, and Canada chosen by Indonesia, were drawn to their respective groups first before drawing the other teams. As such, the Philippines was allocated to Group A, while Japan was allocated to Group E. The United States, Slovenia, and Canada were assigned Group C, Group F, and Group H, respectively.\nThe draw was led by FIBA Basketball World Cup 2023 Global Ambassador Luis Scola (Argentina) and 2011 NBA champion Dirk Nowitzki (Germany), along with Local Ambassadors from the three host nations: 2014 Philippine World Cup team member LA Tenorio and Miss Universe 2018 Catriona Gray (Philippines), former national team member and current president of Levanga Hokkaido Takehiko Orimo (Japan), and actor Raffi Ahmad (Indonesia).\nSeedings.\nTeams were seeded using the February 2023 FIBA World Rankings (shown in parentheses), which were published on 27 February 2023, after the sixth window of the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup qualification process.\nThe highest-ranked team not to qualify for the World Cup, and also the only team from the top 10 in the rankings not to qualify, was fourth-ranked Argentina, who won the silver medal at the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup in China.\nFinal draw.\nThe eight groups were formed randomly, selecting one team from each of the eight pots, and allocating them to an assigned group depending on which pot the team is located. Two teams from the same confederation cannot be placed into the same group, with the exception of teams from Europe, where a minimum of one team but no more than two teams could be in the same group. Groups A-D will play in the Philippines, with Groups A and B playing at the Araneta Coliseum in Quezon City, while Groups C and D will play at the Mall of Asia Arena in Pasay. Groups E and F will be staged at the Okinawa Arena in Okinawa City, and the Indonesia Arena in Jakarta will host Groups G and H."

Meanwhile, the rest of the world had free live coverage of the games on Facebook.\nSquads.\nOn 13 April 2023, Muhammad Umar was ruled out of Pakistan A's squad due to a knee injury and was replaced by Mohammad Ali. On 27 April 2023, Sahibzada Farhan was ruled out of the tour due to a right thumb injury and was replaced by Saim Ayub.\nList A series.\n1st Unofficial ODI.\nIn preparation for the 2023 Cricket World Cup Qualifier, the Zimbabwe Select deployed almost everyone from their full roster. However, a strong start by the Shaheens' bowlers led to the dismissal of half the top order, leaving Zimbabwe Select at 64-5. Aamer Jamal emerged as a standout performer in the bowling attack, making a significant impact by capturing three crucial wickets, effectively disrupting the hosts' innings. Ryan Burl, and Clive Madande then stepped in at number 6 and 7, forming a resilient partnership that added 90 runs to the scoreboard. As a result, the Zimbabwe Select team managed to set a more defendable target of 234 runs.\nDespite the Shaheens' stronger position going into the second innings, their top order encountered a similar fate and succumbed to the bowling of Tendai Chatara during the powerplay. This restricted the Shaheens' score to 105-5. Haseebullah Khan and Mubasir Khan displayed stability as they batted at positions 6 and 7, bringing the Shaheens closer to victory. However, neither batsman was able to achieve a half-century milestone. Chatara, continuing his exceptional bowling spell, claimed two more wickets from the lower order, ultimately ending the Shaheens' innings at 210. His outstanding performance earned him a five-wicket haul and the well-deserved title of Player of the Match.\n2nd Unofficial ODI.\nBoth teams maintained the same roster as the first game, with one change for the Zimbabwe Select team, substituting Brad Evans with Victor Nyauchi. The Zimbabwe side batted first once again, and they encountered a similar start to their previous game as the top order crumbled within the first 13 overs, leaving the team at 57-5. Ryan Burl and Clive Madande once again formed a resilient partnership, contributing 47 and 43 runs respectively, elevating the team's total to 145. Notably, the highest-scoring batsman for the Zimbabwe Select team was Blessing Muzarabani, who remarkably achieved his first List-A half-century in just 24 deliveries while batting at number 11. The Zimbabwe innings concluded when Tendai Chatara was caught out, but the bowling duo managed to surpass their previous game's total by 2 runs. In a repeat of his stellar performance, Aamer Jamal once again shone for the Shaheens, claiming a five-wicket haul and solidifying his status as the star performer of the match.\nAlthough the Shaheens had a stronger start, they too experienced a setback by losing five wickets consecutively, resulting in the team's score at 5-71. However, opening batsman and captain Imran Butt showcased resilience against the Zimbabwe Select bowling attack, contributing 45 runs before being dismissed through an lbw decision. Following the captain's departure, the Shaheens' lower order struggled, eventually being bowled out for 156. Undoubtedly, Blessing Muzarabani's outstanding performance, featuring a half-century with the bat and a four-wicket haul with the ball, played a pivotal role in guiding the team to victory. His exceptional contributions earned him the well-deserved title of Player of the Match.\n3rd Unofficial ODI.\nBoth teams made changes to their squads for the match. Zimbabwe Select brought in Joylord Gumbie, Faraz Akram, and Chivanga Tanaka to replace Innocent Kaia, Blessing Muzarabani, and Victor Nyauchi. On the other hand, the Shaheens had Mir Hamza and Imran Butt sit out, while Omair Yousuf and Qasim Akram replaced them. Additionally, Hussain Talat assumed the captaincy from Imran Butt. Although Joylord Gumbie of Zimbabwe Select fell early, the top order performed well, particularly Sean Williams, who scored 78 runs off 59 balls, helping the team reach a total of 278. This was the highest score achieved by Zimbabwe Select in the series.\nThe Shaheens displayed consistent performance throughout the game, even as they lost wickets at regular intervals. Despite this, they managed to maintain the required run rate. Charata continued to impress with his bowling, and at 169-6, the Shaheens showed resilience. Qasim Akram, batting at number eight, provided much-needed stability and turned the tables on Zimbabwe's bowlers. He played a crucial role in leading the team to victory and also achieved the first half-century for their side. While the Shaheens seemed poised for a comfortable win within the required overs, the game was cut short due to bad light. The par score was 258, and the Shaheens were declared the winners based on the DLS (Duckworth-Lewis-Stern) method.\n4th Unofficial ODI.\nThe Zimbabwe Select team continued their squad experimentation, ensuring that everyone got a chance to play. Notably, Milton Shumba substituted for Sean Williams, who potentially injured his finger in the previous game. On the Shaheens side, the only change from the last game was Abdul Bangalzai replacing Saim Ayub. During the toss, the Zimbabwe Select won and elected to bat second for the first time in the series. The Shaheens' batting lineup encountered difficulties, but Omair Yousuf's remarkable 159 and Kamran Ghulam's 55 helped them achieve their highest total so far, reaching 295. Despite missing Chatara in the bowling department, the Zimbabwe Select struggled to make progress due to several misfields and dropped catches by the fielding side. Despite this they bowling attack took 9 wickets and Brad Evans, who had been rested for the last two games, managed to claim a five-wicket haul.\nThe Shaheens began the match on a high note, quickly dismissing Tadiwanashe Marumani in the early overs. However, after the first wicket fell, they struggled to maintain their momentum. Joylord Gumbie and Craig Ervine, though starting slowly, managed to steady the innings and eventually surpassed the century mark. Their partnership was broken when the Zimbabwe side had reached 285 runs, but by then, the damage had been done. Craig Ervine's exceptional knock of 161 off 144 deliveries earned him the well-deserved player of the match award.\n5th Unofficial ODI.\nThe Zimbabwe select side opted to rest several key players ahead of the game, while Sikander Raza made a return to the squad following a successful stint in the IPL. Sean Williams, who had recovered from a finger injury, assumed the captaincy of the new team. On the Shaheens side, Imran Butt returned to open the innings, while Hussein Talat retained his role as captain.In the match, the Select won the toss and elected to field first. The Shaheens top order displayed resilience and kept the scoreboard ticking. Imran Butt, Haseebullah Khan, and the in-form Pakistani batsman Omair Yousuf all contributed with scores surpassing 50 runs, propelling the team to a total of 314 runs at the end of their 50 overs.\nOn the other hand, the Zimbabwe batting lineup encountered difficulties right from the beginning. Apart from Clive Madande, all the other batsmen struggled to surpass 20 runs, resulting in their team being dismissed for a mere 137 runs in just 32 overs. Shahnawaz Dahani continued his impressive form and claimed early wickets, providing the Shaheens with a breakthrough in the opposition's batting order. With this victory, the Pakistan Shaheens triumphed over the Zimbabwe Select side in the fifth one-day match, keeping their hopes alive in the series.\n6th Unofficial ODI.\nIn the final game of the series, Kamran Ghulam led the Shaheens and won the toss, electing to send the Zimbabwe Select team to bat first. The Shaheens got an early breakthrough when Joylord Gumbie, who had scored a century in the previous game, was dismissed for a duck. However, Innocent Kaia and Craig Ervine formed a strong partnership, accumulating 187 runs in just 27 overs. Craig Ervine showcased his brilliance with a score of 195, while Innocent Kaia contributed 92 runs off 79 deliveries, allowing the lower batting order some leeway. In the last over, Craig Ervine fell short of a double century as he was run out by a direct hit from Haseebullah Khan while attempting to regain strike. The innings ended with the Select side scoring 385, the highest total in series. During the innings, there was a controversy on the field as the Pakistan Shaheens were penalized for ball tampering by umpire Iknow Chaabi. As a result of the infraction, the Select side was awarded 5 runs.\nDespite losing some early wickets from the top order, the Shaheens persisted in maintaining a steady run rate while chasing a massive target. Impressive performances by Rohail Nazir, who scored 87 off 91 deliveries, Kamran Ghulam with 56 off 47, and Mubasir Khan's blistering 115 off 77 propelled the Shaheens to a total of 256. However, as the game progressed, the Shaheens found themselves running out of time, and the mounting pressure of an increasing run rate led to errors and poor shot selections. Eventually, the team was bowled out for 353. The Select side emerged victorious by 32 runs, sealing the series with a 4-2 win."

        "title": "2023–24 Premiership Rugby",
        "text": "The 2023–24 Premiership Rugby is the 37th season of the top flight of English domestic rugby union competition and the sixth to be sponsored by Gallagher. The competition is being broadcast by TNT Sports for the eleventh and final year of their current broadcast deal, with six league season games and the final also simulcast free-to-air by ITV. Highlights of each weekend's games are to be shown on ITV, with extended highlights on TNT Sports.\nThe reigning champions entering the season are Saracens, who claimed their 6th league title after winning the 2023 final. No team was promoted from the 2022–23 RFU Championship, as the champions were not able to satisfy the eligibility criteria required to enter the league.\nRule changes.\nThe 2023–24 season is set to be the final year under the current Premiership competition structure, before a planned 're-launch' taking place ahead of the 2024–25 season. As a result, the moratorium on relegation to the RFU Championship will cease and be replaced by a play-off between the team placed last in the Premiership and the team placed first in the Championship. Promotion from the Championship is therefore also set to be reinstated, subject to the winning club successfully fulfilling the RFU minimum standards criteria.\nThis season is also the last year of the league's temporary salary cap reduction, implemented to keep the participating clubs financially solvent following the COVID-19 pandemic, with further regulatory changes set to be made for the 2024–25 season.\nTeams.\nThe competition will feature 10 of the 13 teams which began the 2022–23 season. Two of the other three – Wasps and Worcester Warriors – were previously confirmed to be excluded from competing in the 2023–24 season, after both clubs were expelled from the league, upon entering into administration in 2022. The final team – London Irish – had originally been due to compete, but the club was also expelled in summer 2023, prior to the start of the season, because of insufficient funds to continue operating. As a result, the 2023–24 season is the first time the top flight of English rugby has featured just 10 teams since the 1995–96 season.\nFor the second consecutive year, the top team in the Championship was ineligible for promotion to the Premiership, after 2022–23 Championship winners Jersey Reds failed to meet the minimum standards criteria to join the competition.\nLondon Irish administration.\nOn 15 May 2023, London Irish were warned by the RFU that they faced suspension from the Premiership ahead of the beginning of the 2023–24 season, unless they met a deadline of 30 May to complete a takeover by new ownership, due to concerns about the club's finances. On 31 May, the RFU granted the club a one-week extension, on the condition that evidence of funding for the 2023–24 season, from either the existing benefactor or the prospective new owners, was provided by 6 June. On 2 June, HMRC issued a winding-up petition against the club, in response to unpaid tax. On 6 June, after failing to provide proof of funds for the upcoming season, London Irish were officially suspended from the Premiership. The following day, the club filed for administration, resulting in automatic relegation under RFU regulations.\nStadiums and locations.\nNotes\nTable.\nRound-by-round progression.\nThe grid below shows each team's progression throughout the season, indicating their points total (and league table position) at the end of every round:\nRegular season.\nThe regular season fixtures were announced on 18 July 2023. They are due to play out over the course of 18 rounds, with each round consisting of five matches.\nThe league began on 13 October 2023, with the full season schedule staggered to start and finish one month later than the 2022–23 season, in order to reduce fixture overlap with the 2023 Rugby World Cup, which reaches the knockout stages on the same weekend as the Premiership's opening round. A revamped version of the Premiership Rugby Cup, involving teams from the RFU Championship, was also announced to take place before the beginning of the Premiership season. The Premiership season will pause for eight weeks between the ends of January 2023 and March 2023, to avoid any fixture clashes with the 2024 Six Nations Championship.\nHighlights of the season include:\nAll fixtures are subject to change. Referees appointed to officiate Premiership matches are employed by the RFU, unless indicated otherwise.\nPlay-offs.\nAs in previous seasons, the top four teams in the Premiership table, following the conclusion of the regular season, will contest the play-off semi-finals in a 1st vs 4th and 2nd vs 3rd format, with the higher ranking team having home advantage. The two winners of the semi-finals then meet in the Premiership Final at Twickenham on 8 June 2024.\nPromotion/relegation play-off.\nSubject to meeting the eligible criteria for promotion, the team which places 1st in the 2023–24 RFU Championship will contest a play-off against the team which finishes bottom of the Premiership table, with the winner competing in the following year's Premiership season. If the Championship winner is ineligible for promotion, no play-off will take place.\nOn 29 June 2023, it was announced that the promotion/relegation play-off would take place across two legs, with each team playing one of the matches at their home ground, during the weekends of 31 May–2 June and 7–9 June 2024.\nOn 20 March 2024, it was confirmed that only Doncaster Knights would be eligible for promotion, should they top the Championship table. They are therefore also the only Championship team that will compete in the play-off, if appropriate.\nLeading scorers.\nNote: Flags to the left of player names indicate national team as has been defined under World Rugby eligibility rules, or primary nationality for players who have not yet earned international senior caps.

It was played between host nation India and Australia. It was the first time that Ahmedabad hosted a Cricket World Cup final. It was the second time that India and Australia played a World Cup final against each other, after the 2003 final.\nIn the final, Australia defeated India to win a record-extending sixth World Cup title.\nBackground.\nThe 2023 Cricket World Cup was hosted by India. Originally, the competition was to be played from 9 February to 26 March 2023 but due to getting longer qualification time it was moved to October to November.

India continued to add runs slowly, but Rahul was dismissed for 66 to leave India 203/6, and the remaining batsmen were not able to score quickly, the innings ending when Kuldeep Yadav was dismissed from the last ball of the 50th over with the score on 240.\nAustralia innings.\nAustralia made a poor start to their innings, losing three batsmen for 47 runs inside the first seven overs. However, Travis Head and Marnus Labuschagne then built a partnership, adding 192 runs in 36 overs; Australia were within two runs of victory when Head was dismissed by Mohammed Siraj for 137.

After this, Australia's Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BCCI Secretary Jay Shah presented the World Cup trophy to Australia's captain Pat Cummins.\nAftermath.\nIn the aftermath of the match, many supporters of the Indian team took to social media to troll and harass Australian players and their families. Some fans even sent death and rape threats directed at players and their families, resulting in many Australian players filing complaints with Cricket Australia.\nHarbhajan Singh, a former player on the Indian team, condemned the trolls, saying \"Reports of trolling of family members of Australian cricket players is completely in bad taste. We played well but lost the final to better cricket by the Aussies. That's it. Why troll the players and their families? Requesting all cricket fans to stop such behaviour. Sanity and dignity are more important\"."

Players are challenged to solve golf-themed puzzles.\nGameplay.\n\"Golf Peaks\" is an isometric, golf-themed puzzle game. Each map consists of a series of platforms, and players draw cards that determine how they traverse the platforms. The game implements various hazards, which provide new challenges in optimally traversing the platforms, but these hazards do not model physics; they are purely logical puzzles.\nDevelopment.\nAfterburn said \"Golf Peaks\" recouped its development costs a week and a half after its release, which they attributed to Poland's low cost of living, being featured in the App Store, and having a short development time. Development took about five months. It was released for iOS on November 12, 2018; Windows and macOS on November 13, 2018; the Nintendo Switch on March 14, 2019; and Xbox One on September 21, 2021. 7Levels helped port it to the Switch.\nReception.\nThe Switch version of \"Golf Peaks\" received positive reviews on Metacritic. \"Nintendo Life\" called it \"fun and engaging\" but said it is a bit short. \"The Verge\" wrote, \"The puzzles are well-crafted, and the game is so relaxing to play that I don't want to stop.\" \"Pocket Gamer\" praised its balanced levels and called it \"a pretty magnificent experience\" held back only by its lack of further content. \"Digitally Downloaded\" recommended it for times when one only has periods of time to play games, but they said it has \"somewhat limited\" gameplay during longer sessions. Although he was disappointed in the lack of in-game hints for the most challenging puzzles, \"NintendoWorldReport\"s reviewer said that it is \"a nice, serene, and challenging way to wind down\".\nIt was nominated for best mobile game at the 2019 Central &amp; Eastern European Game Awards."

        "text": "The 2023 season was Glamorgan County Cricket Club's 136th year in existence and their 102nd as a first-class cricket county. They competed in the Second Division of the County Championship, as well as Group B of the One-Day Cup and the South Group of the T20 Blast. Just two of their fourteen County Championship matches produced results (one win and one loss), meaning they finished in fifth place in the eight-team division; meanwhile, they failed to capitalise on a good start in the T20 Blast, winning four of their first five matches before losing eight of their next nine to finish eighth out of the nine teams in the South Group. In the One-Day Cup, they failed to put together any consistent form; they won four of their eight matches, finishing in fourth place, three points behind Gloucestershire and Worcestershire in quarter-final places. Glamorgan played two 50-over matches at The Gnoll in Neath for the second year in a row, while also not returning to Penrhyn Avenue in Rhos-on-Sea for the fourth year in a row.\nIt was the team's fourth season with Matthew Maynard as their red-ball head coach and their second with David Lloyd as captain; both left at the end of the season, with Maynard stepping down and Lloyd moving to Derbyshire. Former Gloucestershire and England all-rounder Mark Alleyne joined the club as white-ball head coach, but his appointment as an assistant coach for the Welsh Fire in The Hundred meant Glamorgan turned to David Harrison to coach the side in the One-Day Cup. The team's overseas players were Australians Marnus Labuschagne and Michael Neser, and South African Colin Ingram; Australian Peter Hatzoglou and New Zealander Cam Fletcher also joined for the T20 Blast, while Australian Mitchell Swepson was brought in while Neser was on international duty with Australia for the 2023 Ashes series.\nPre-season and friendlies.\nGlamorgan's pre-season campaign took place in Zimbabwe, where they played a three-day match and a one-day match against Northerns, and three one-day matches against Southerns. On returning, they played a three-day game against Somerset at Taunton, before hosting Cardiff MCCU in another three-day match. They also played a one-day match against Herefordshire before the start of the One-Day Cup season, but it was rained off midway through the first innings.\nCounty Championship.\nMatches.\n20–23 April: Glamorgan v Durham.\nAfter a week off, Glamorgan returned to action at home to Durham buoyed by the return of their overseas players, Australians Michael Neser and Marnus Labuschagne.\nT20 Blast.\nStandings.\n Advanced to the Quarter-finals"

        "text": "This article relates the participation of Tunisia during the 2022 FIFA World Cup organized in Qatar from 20 November to 18 December 2022. This is the country's sixth participation in the competition after 1978, 1998, 2002, 2006 and 2018. Tunisia meets France, Denmark and Australia in Group D.\nFor the sixth time, Tunisia failed to qualify for the second round of the World Cup, as Tunisia finished the tournament ranked 21st after a 0–0 draw with Denmark, a 0–1 defeat against Australia and a 1–0 victory over France.\nQualification.\nSummary.\nTunisia, which only has to intervene in the second round, meets Mauritania, Equatorial Guinea and Zambia. With four wins, a draw and a defeat, the third round is reached, but this is not effective until the day of the last match. The third round is played over two legs and Tunisia take on Mali, the only third-round contender who has never qualified for a World Cup. In the first leg, they took the lead over Mali in the 36th minute thanks to an own goal from Moussa Sissako, who received a red card four minutes later. The Tunisians finished 1–0, so a goalless draw in the second leg was enough for them to qualify.\nA total of 29 players are used; twenty of them are also in the squad for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, during which Tunisia are eliminated in the quarter-finals. Only Aïssa Laïdouni and Ali Maâloul have played all eight matches. Mohamed Ali Ben Romdhane plays seven games, but is not used in the first game. Farouk Ben Mustapha is the goalkeeper in all second round matches, but Bechir Ben Saïd, who is making his Africa Cup debut, plays in the third round. Sebastian Tounekti (one game) makes his first international appearance in qualifying. The top scorer is captain Wahbi Khazri with three goals, all scored in the second round. He received a second yellow card in the last match of the second round and was replaced by Youssef Msakni in the third round. In total, eight players have scored at least one goal, plus an own goal by a Malian player, which allows Tunisia to qualify for the World Cup.\nSecond Round.\nThe draw for the ten groups will be held on 21 January 2020 in Cairo. The teams are divided into four pots according to their FIFA ranking. The second round was supposed to start in March 2020, but is postponed several times due to the COVID-19 pandemic and does not start until September 2021.\nOn 3 September 2021, the national team begins its matches in the 2022 World Cup qualifiers. Tunisia wins the first three matches without conceding a goal, against Equatorial Guinea in Radès 3–0, against Zambia in Ndola 2–0 and against Mauritania 3–0, followed by a draw against the latter in Nouakchott 0–0 and a defeat against Equatorial Guinea in Malabo 0–1, which postpones the qualification for the next round on the last day. Coach Mondher Kebaier faces heavy criticism from fans. This time the team's opponent is Equatorial Guinea. If the two countries are level on points before the last match, Equatorial Guinea draw 1–1 against Mauritania while Tunisia secures first place in its group with a victory 3–1 over Zambia, qualification for the third round being achieved on 16 November, Tunisia concluding the pool matches with four wins, one draw and one loss. During the three matches which take place at the Hammadi Agrebi Stadium, all are played behind closed doors due to the health protocol of the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular the match of the last day against Zambia, which the public had to attend before the refusal of the Confederation of African Football.\nThird Round.\nThe matches are knockout round robin matches. The five winners of the confrontations are qualified for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. The draw for the third round, initially scheduled for 18 December takes place on 22 January 2022 in Douala, during the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations. Mondher Kebaier is sacked following the elimination of Tunisia in the quarter of final at the African Cup of Nations and replaced by Jalel Kadri. In the first leg at the Stade du 26 Mars in Bamako, Tunisia won 1–0 thanks to an own goal by Moussa Sissako on pressure from Msakni. As for the return match at the Hammadi Agrebi Stadium, in front of 50,000 spectators, it ended in a draw 0–0, so that the team qualified for the World Cup for the sixth time in its history.\nPreparation.\nDraw.\nThe draw for the final phase of the 2022 World Cup takes place on 1 April 2022 at the Doha Exhibition Centre. Tunisia are assigned to Pot 3 and could be drawn against defending champions Brazil, France, Germany or hosts Qatar. Tunisia meet France, Denmark and Australia in Group D.\nThe Tunisians haven't scored against any of these teams in their previous World Cup appearances. There have been four friendlies against France, two draws and two losses, and the Tunisians have faced the France B team twice at the Mediterranean Games, winning and losing once. They lost to Denmark at the 1960 Summer Olympics and in preparation for the 2002 World Cup; they also lost to Australia in a friendly match and won the 2005 Confederations Cup.\nPreparation matches.\nreparations start early, as the team plays two matches for the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualification, the first against Equatorial Guinea in Radès 4–0 victory and the second against Botswana in Francistown draw 0–0. Subsequently, the team is set to play the 2022 Kirin Cup Soccer in Japan from 10 to 14 June 2022, with the participation of three other teams: Japan, Chile and Ghana. In the semi-finals, Tunisia beat Chile 2–0 and then Japan 3–0 and thus won the title for the first time.\nFerjani Sassi was named the tournament's best player, while his compatriot Issam Jebali finished top scorer with two goals. After that, the team played two friendlies: the first against Comoros, which ended in victory 1–0, and the second which ended in a heavy loss against Brazil 5–1. The Carthage Eagles end their preparations with a victory against Iran with a score of 2–0 a few days before the world cup, the match not being broadcast and taking place behind closed doors at the request of the Iranian federation.\nTeam.\nSquad.\nTunisia announced their final squad on 14 November 2022.\nKit.\nItalian company Kappa unveils the national team uniform on 29 September 2022. The front decorations of the shirt form the shield of Carthaginian general Hannibal Barca.\nGroup stage.\nGroup D.\nIn the first match in Group D, Mohamed Dräger threatens the opponent's goal, then Issam Jebali dominates Kasper Schmeichel, but the situation is prevented by an offside. In the 43rd minute, Jebali comes face to face with Schmeichel after hitting the goal and tries to beat the goalkeeper with a through shot, but he uses his thumbs and fends off the finish. Christian Eriksen then makes an attempt beyond the goal line, but Aymen Dahmen is illustrated with a save. From the corner that follows, Andreas Cornelius wastes an opportunity by finding himself alone at the far post, but his header only seals the structure of the goals. Due to the subsequent dominance over the ball, despite their best efforts, the Danes could not find a solution against the Tunisia defence, and the match ended in a goalless draw. Thanks to his performance in this match, Aïssa Laïdouni receives the man of the match award.\nIn the second match, the team are led to a 1–0 loss against Australia, with the technical framework and the players receiving criticism due to the weakness of the midfield and the attack, which reduces the chances of Tunisia to qualify for the round of 16. In the final game against world champions France, Wahbi Khazri put Tunisia ahead in the 58th minute with a low shot to the bottom right corner. At this stage, Tunisia is in a position to qualify in the group. However, two minutes later, Australia took the lead against Denmark in the other match, which sent Tunisia out of the knockout stage. Captain Khazri wins the Man of the Match award. This is Tunisia's first victory against a European team in the World Cup, and the team have collected the most points (four points) in the group stage since their first appearance in 1978 FIFA World Cup (three points). In this context, Wahbi Khazri is retiring from international retirement, after 74 games in which he scored 25 goals.\nStandings.\nIn the round of 16:\nDenmark vs Tunisia.\nThe two teams had faced each other twice, most recently in 2002, a 2–1 win for Denmark in a friendly game.\nDenmark were not able to capitalize in their opening game; although Tunisia failed to score a single goal themselves, they still managed to secure their match without problems, with Aïssa Laïdouni earning the Man of the Match.\n&lt;section begin=D1 /&gt;&lt;section end=D1 /&gt;\nTunisia vs Australia.\nThe two teams had faced each other twice, most recently in Tunisia's 2–0 win at the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup.\nAustralia beat Tunisia 1–0 as a result of a Mitchell Duke header in the 23rd minute to secure their first win in a World Cup match since they defeated Serbia 2–1 in 2010. This was also Australia's first clean sheet since they drew 0–0 with Chile in 1974.\n&lt;section begin=D3 /&gt;&lt;section end=D3 /&gt;\nTunisia vs France.\nThe two teams had faced each other four times, most recently in 2010 friendly, a 1–1 draw.\nWahbi Khazri put Tunisia into the lead in the 58th minute with a low shot to the bottom right corner. At that stage, Tunisia was in a position to qualify from the group. However, two minutes later Australia went in front against Denmark in the other match taking place at the same time, which put Tunisia outside of the qualifying positions. In added time, Antoine Griezmann scored to seemingly make it 1–1 with a volley but the goal was ruled out by VAR for offside. Australia went on to beat Denmark, which meant that Tunisia finished third in the group and failed to get into the knockout stage for the sixth consecutive World Cup.\n&lt;section begin=D6 /&gt;&lt;section end=D6 /&gt;\nControversies.\nThreatening to be excluded.\nAt the end of October 2022, an internal dispute concerning the Minister of Youth and Sports, Kamel Deguiche, and the president of the federation, Wadie Jary, threatens Tunisia's participation in the World Cup. Indeed, the two men are known to hate each other and the first wishes to dissolve the federation to separate from the second. FIFA systematically penalizes cases of interference in the world of football, it therefore warns the Tunisian federation: by means of a letter, it warns that it reserves the right to exclude Tunisia from the competition in case of taking power over the federation by Deguiche.\nAllegations of interference in the squad.\nDozens of news websites in Tunisia reported that coach Jalel Kadri was subjected to pressure during the formation of the Tunisian team's squad for the 2022 World Cup, according to the player Saad Bguir, who was excluded from the final list and who was on the initial list. He also announced his international retirement through a phone call on the TV program Stade Plus on Carthage Plus, until the president of the Tunisian Football Federation, Wadie Jary, left his position.

On 14 November 2022, hundreds of fans greeted the team bus in Doha upon their arrival, but the president of the Federation was insulted in the worst terms.\nAlso, the selection of four goalkeepers was under pressure from the Tunisian Football Federation to meet the wishes of certain teams on the financial level, FIFA, since the 2010 FIFA World Cup, paying a subsidy to each. team, of which at least one player has been called up in each edition of the competition. On 28 November 2022, former national team player Issam Jemâa said on Radio IFM, that TFF officials had sacrificed one of the players to call four goalkeepers into the final list, as the choice was on Bilel Ifa, who returned to the team after the anger of the fans, Taha Yassine Khenissi, who was medically examined for two hours, so they could find him injured or Seifeddine Jaziri, who was called up due of financial transactions between him and the brother of the president of the TFF, Wajih Jary.

        "title": "Blue bloods in college basketball",
        "text": "In American college basketball, the term \"blue bloods\" is used in reference to National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I basketball programs considered to be among the most elite, either contemporaneously or historically. Outside of sports, \"blue blood\" is used as an alternative term for nobility.\nBasketball media writers often debate which men's programs are considered blue bloods. The men's programs of Duke, Kansas, Kentucky, UCLA, UConn, UNC, and Indiana are often included when listing blue bloods. UConn's women's team is also considered a blue blood, as is Tennessee.\nOrigins and definition of the phrase.\nThe term \"blue blood\" or being \"blue-blooded\" is rooted in nobility, with royals being dubbed as such. The modern-day usage referring to an exclusive list of elite college basketball programs has an unclear history. Writing for NCAA.com, Andy Wittry cited a January 3, 1927, sub-headline in the \"Brooklyn Times-Union\" as the \"oldest example\" he could find of the phrase being used. However, the \"Times-Union\"s sub-headline of \"Centrals Made Up of Basketball Blue Bloods\" referred to players rather than teams. The phrase was also featured in \"The Indianapolis News\" on March 9, 1942. The oldest usage of the phrase in specific reference to college basketball was used by Dick Dunkel of \"The Charlotte News\", who used \"blue bloods\" in his men's basketball rating system. During the 1950s, the Associated Press (AP) and \"Cincinnati Enquirer\" used the phrase in a casual sense, describing teams ranked near the top of the AP poll.\nWhen writing about its modern-day usage, Dana O'Neil of \"The Athletic\" wrote that \"the term blue blood is, in fact, nebulous and left to the eye of the beholder, the standards of neither admission nor eviction not exactly clear. Tradition and success seem to matter but how deep that success has to go is also subject to interpretation.\" It has also been noted that the teams with most widespread consideration as blue bloods all wear shades of blue.\nSchools considered blue bloods.\nMen's basketball.\nThere is debate among which teams should be considered blue bloods. Duke, Kansas, Kentucky, North Carolina (UNC), UCLA, and Indiana have historically been the schools most often written about by sports media when discussing blue bloods. Sports media writers generally consider these schools among the best due to being among the winningest teams in the regular season, as well as having won a considerable amount of championships.\nVillanova's Final Four and championship game appearances in the 2010s and 2020s has also garnered them consideration for blue blood status. When Duke, Kansas, UNC, and Villanova all made the Final Four in the 2022 NCAA tournament, numerous basketball media writers discussed the occasion as the first time all Final Four teams were blue bloods.\nUConn were sometimes thought of as a blue blood prior to their championship wins in the 2020s. The program gained much consideration as a bona fide blue blood among many media writers and fans alike following their 2023 championship, and when securing a back-to-back title in the following tournament, media writers were in even more agreement about the program's blue blood status. O'Neil wrote that \"Maybe UConn's delayed entry [into blue blood membership] is due to the fact that the Huskies don't quite fit the mold. The Huskies are more feisty than refined,\" adding that \"they also read more blue-collar than blue-blooded.\" Following UConn's 2024 tournament victory, Matt Norlander of CBS Sports wrote that \"Last year was about UConn cementing its case as a blue blood. It was so convincing, you never heard it brought up this season or this tournament. It was accepted as fact. Because it is.\"\nUCLA and Indiana are sometimes excluded from lists of blue bloods, or have had their status as a blue blood program called into question. This is due to the majority of their success and championships coming under one coach or occurring during one particular stretch. Writing for \"Sports Illustrated\" \"FanNation\" in 2021, Davis Wallace described the two programs, as well as Michigan State and UConn, as \"True Bloods\", stating that these schools \"aren't consistent enough to be considered a top-tier Blue Blood, but they still have a history that's respected.\" Wallace also listed Virginia, Gonzaga, Villanova, and Michigan as \"New Bloods\" due to their more recent success. In 2022, Will Backus of 247Sports noted that Indiana's inclusion on listings of blue bloods has become more \"tenuous\" in recent years. The blue blood status for Duke, Kansas, Kentucky, and UNC have a wider consensus.\nWomen's basketball.\nThe term has less usage in regards to college women's basketball. However, UConn's women's team is considered a blue blood, having won 11 NCAA championships. Tennessee has also been noted by sports media writers to be a blue blood in women's basketball. South Carolina has been considered a blue blood in women's basketball."

In Dressage, normally 18 riders qualify for the Finals but some riders troubled with making the trip to the US. Initially, Charlotte Phillips of Australia won the Pacific League qualifier and qualified for the Finals, but due the mandatory vaccinations against Equine Influenza, she was not able to travel because her horse CP Dresden was not vaccinated. Neither the second placed rider Kerry Mack was able to travel because her horse was also not vaccinated and claimed the Australian federation did not notify them about the mandatory vaccination. Instead, European-based Simone Pearce stepped in as Australian representative. Moldovan Alisa Glinka could also not travel to Omaha because of Visa issues and had to withdraw last minute. Glinka has both the Moldovan and Russian nationally and had to go to the U.S. Embassy in Chisinau, but because of the bureaucratic process, she could not get her Visa on time. In total this reduced the number of entries to 16 instead of 18.\nDuring the competition, Dutch Dinja van Liere had to withdraw right before the start of the Grand Prix after passing the Vet-Check the day before. Hermes was not fit to compete. Also, both German Ingrid Klimke and Dutch Marieke van der Putten had to withdraw before the start of the Grand Prix Freestyle after completing the Grand Prix.

He played for the Penrith Panthers in the NRL competition.\nPlaying career.\nJohnson was a Brisbane junior. In 1997, Johnson joined the Penrith Panthers after spending three seasons with the Brisbane Broncos in the reserve grade side. He was voted the Broncos' Most Consistent Reserve Grade Player for 1996 and he came to the Panthers looking for an opportunity to play first grade after not getting the chance at the Broncos. Johnson made his first grade debut at in his side's 30–20 victory over the Perth Reds at Penrith Stadium in the opening round of 1997 Super League season.\nDespite being big, strong, and mobile, and known for being a strong defender with a good ‘football brain’, Johnson found it difficult to become a regular first grade player with the Panthers after suffering a career-threatening injury during the 1997 season. Doctors discovered that Johnson had kidney damage and there were fears he would never play again. With the emergence of new players such as; Ned Catic, Jody Gall, Lee Hopkins, Duncan MacGillivray, and Tony Puletua, Johnson found it very difficult to hold down a spot in first grade. Johnson played his final first grade game in his side's 27–16 loss to the Parramatta Eels at Penrith Stadium in round 1 of the 1998 season. Johnson would spend part of the 1998 NRL season on the injury list for Penrith.\nHe was released from the Panthers at the end of the 1998 season and subsequently never played first grade rugby league again."

        "text": "Disguised (abbreviated DSG) is an esports organization founded in 2023 by Canadian streamer Jeremy \"Disguised Toast\" Wang. The organization currently fields active teams in \"Valorant\", \"League Of Legends\", and \"Apex Legends\", with plans to compete in \"Teamfight Tactics\" and an unspecified fighting game in 2024.\nHistory.\nOn January 8, 2023, Internet personality Jeremy \"Disguised Toast\" Wang, announced a \"Valorant\" team under the name \"Disguised\". The team included members of the former Knights team, with the addition of two players: Steel, formerly a player for 100 Thieves and T1, and Clear, a rookie player. Disguised entered the \"Valorant\" Game Changers scene in March 2023.\nDisguised branched into \"League of Legends\" in June 2023, competing in the North American Challengers League (NACL), and expanded to \"Apex Legends\" in August 2023. Disguised's \"League of Legends\" team won the organization its first trophy, securing first place in the summer split of the NACL. Disguised also entered \"Teamfight Tactics\" in October 2023 in advance of the TFT Vegas Open.\nWang won the Esports Personality of the Year in 2023 primarily for his work with Disguised.\nDivisions.\n\"Valorant\".\nInitially having expressed interest in signing a \"Valorant\" team in a tweet on October 30, 2022, Wang officially announced his roster and the DSG branding on January 8, 2023. He signed three players from the former Knights core (XXiF, Exalt, and Genghsta) and their coach OCEAN. They were joined by Steel, former T1 and 100 Thieves in-game leader, and rookie player Clear. On January 13, 2023, Disguised qualified for the \"Valorant\" Challengers League: North America (VCL: NA) through the Open Qualifier event. However, after four matches of the first split of VCL: NA, Disguised released Exalt and chose to play with their substitute Riku for the remainder of the split.\nOn March 8, 2023, it was reported that the organization would be forming another \"Valorant\" team for the Game Changers Open Qualifier, \"Valorant\"'s league for women and marginalized genders. Disguised's Game Changers roster was officially announced on March 27, consisting of content creators Jodi \"QuarterJade\" Lee, Kyedae Shymko, Sydney \"Sydeon\" Parker, and Tenzin \"tenzin\" Dolkar, along with former Immortals player Lydia \"tupperware\" Wilson as in-game leader and Corey \"Ruin\" Hartog as coach. After failing to qualify for the main event, Wang jokingly \"dropped\" the team—in reality, the members never had a monetary contract with Disguised and the announcement was a parody of other esports teams' unceremonious firing of their players after failure to qualify.\nAfter having failed to win a match in the Mid-Season Face-Off, Disguised signed Jaccob \"yay\" Whiteaker to their main roster for split two of VCL: NA. With multiple top international finishes and winner of The Game Awards Best Esports Athlete in 2022, yay's addition was seen as a promising sign for Disguised. Regardless, Disguised's performance failed to improve, going on an 11-game losing streak and ultimately being relegated from VCL: North America. The roster was released shortly after.\nOn July 10, 2023, Disguised signed a new Game Changers roster consisting of Katarina, Hannah \"hannah\" Reyes, Nathan \"lazylion\" Hoang, misu, and unstable. They ultimately placed 6th/7th in the North American Game Changers playoffs, with Disguised later announcing their departure from the Game Changers space citing their loss to a team later disqualified for cheating as an example of the need for Riot Games to improve the Game Changers system.\nDisguised rejoined the \"Valorant\" scene in 2024 in collaboration with Bleed Esports, where former player yay plays, as Bleed's affiliate team. The new roster consists of Azrie \"Riza\" Adly, Tyler \"Juicy\" Aeria, Wong \"JayH\" Jia Heng, Bryce \"bryce\" Lee, and Wayne \"watbe\" Chang and will compete in VCL Malaysia/Singapore.\n\"League Of Legends\".\nOn June 1, 2023, Disguised announced the creation of a \"League of Legends\" team to compete in the North America Challengers League (NACL). The roster consisted of three players from reigning NACL champions, Cloud9 Challengers: FakeGod, Tomio, and Zeyzal, along with Young from Golden Guardians, Meech from NRG Challengers, and coach GoldenGlue. The team won the summer 2023 season of the North American Challenger League, but were released after securing the organization's first trophy to provide players with an opportunity to play in the franchised LCS league.\nDisguised chose to remain in the NACL for 2024, signing a roster of Milan \"Tenacity\" Oleksij, Perry \"Perry\" Norman, Daniel \"Minui\" Mingshui, and Philippe \"Poome\" Lavoie-Giguere, along with the return of Youngho \"Young\" Choi from the previous year's roster.\n\"Apex Legends\".\nOn August 22, 2023, Disguised announced the signing of an \"Apex Legends\" team consisting of Ira \"dooplex\" Shepherd, Trenton \"lou\" Clements, and Adam \"senoxe\" Lau. They had formerly played together as an unsigned roster by the name \"Dudes Night Out\" and qualified for the \"Apex Legends\" Global Series (ALGS) Championship in Birmingham. After competing in the ALGS Championship and placing 33rd, the roster was released.\nFor 2024, ALGS announced the expansion of their partnership program, with Disguised being one of the twelve teams added. On January 17, 2024, Disguised announced the signing of \"The Dojo\", fourth place finishers at the ALGS Championship. This new roster consists of Timothy \"iiTzTimmy\" An who remains signed to 100 Thieves as a content creator, Tyler \"Dezignful\" Gardner, and Alexander \"Enemy\" Rodriguez, along with head coach Deston \"Bronzey\" Nguyen.\n\"Teamfight Tactics\".\nPrior to the \"Teamfight Tactics\" Vegas Open, Disguised signed ten players, including Wang himself. During the event, Disguised added two players: Kevin \"Prestivent\" Zou and Joven \"Broccóli\" Thandi, with Broccóli placing third overall."

He played for them in early 1910 before his first emigration to Canada, and returned to play for them after the First World War ended.\nThe \"Edinburgh Evening News\" of Thursday 1 September 1927 noted:\nHe was one of the most useful scrummagers in the country during that [1919-1920] season, being heavy, with a good turn of speed, though never displaying much 'showiness' in his play.\nThe \"Dundee Courier\" of Thursday 30 September 1920 called his emigration from Kirkcaldy to Canada 'a national loss', though Kirkcaldy was not expected to be a weaker club in the 1920–21 season.\nAlthough still in Canada, he was elected a patron of the club in 1923.\nHe played for the RAFRU in a number of games. He was injured in a match for the RAF against the Royal Navy Depot on Wednesday 18 February 1919. He was playing alongside William Wakefield in that match.

This article covers both amateurs and professional levels.\nHistory.\nFrom the 2000s to the early 2010s, video game tournaments in the Philippines have been largely amateur often held in internet cafés in Metro Manila. Video gaming was widely seen as just for leisure or past-time and not seen as a credible means for a professional career. Among popular video game titles featured in tournaments around this period are \"Dota 2\" and \"Counter-Strike\".\nThe Philippine Esports Organization (PeSO), which would govern esports in the country would be established in 2011. Filipinos would eventually become esports athletes and professional esports teams would be organized to compete in international competitions.\nIn 2017, the state agency Games and Amusements Board recognized esports as a legitimate sport.\nThe Philippines would introduce esports as a medal event in the 2019 Southeast Asian Games which it hosted. This would be the first time esports would feature in an event that also featured traditional sports. PESO would also formally organize a national esports team for the occasion which was given the moniker \"Sibol\". Esports would be subsequently featured in succeeding editions of the regional games.\nThe rise of the availability of smartphones and mobile internet would cause the increased popularity of mobile game titles for esports by the early 2020s such as \"\" and \"PUBG Mobile\".\nSports body and regulation.\nThe Philippine Esports Organization (PeSO) is an esports body that represents the country officially to the International eSports Federation (IeSF), which is one of the largest esports associations in the world. The organization is a member of the Philippine Olympic Committee since 2020.\nProfessional esports athletes in the Philippines are also required to secure a license from the Games and Amusements Board.\nCompetitions.\nThe following are professional esports tournaments and leagues that are organized in the Philippines."

        "text": "John Hunter (10 November 1920 – 31 March 2006) was a Scotland international rugby union player.\nRugby Union career.\nAmateur career.\nHe gained a foundation scholarship to Fettes, after being in Kirkcaldy High School for one year. He became head of the school at Fettes, and played rugby for the school XV.\nHe played for Kirkcaldy, although he was more usually found in their 2nd XV.\nThe \"Fife Free Press &amp; Kirkcaldy Guardian\" of Saturday 10 December 1949 explained:\nThen, since the last war. there was the classic instance of J. M. Hunter, son of the former minister of Abbotshall Church, who was capped in season 1946-47. His clubs that season, were jocularly referred to locally as being Kirkcaldy 2nd XV and Cambridge and Scotland. However, the truth of the matter was that while a member of the Kirkcaldy club he was unable to turn out regularly owing to his studies. Nevertheless, when he was available he sportingly insisted that no regular player from the 1st XV should be relegated his behalf, hence his irregular appearances with the 2nd XV. As rugby enthusiasts will agree, a most sporting gesture.\nDunfermline looked for his services but Hunter instead moved south to study at Cambridge University.\nHunter then played for Cambridge University.\nAfter university, he then played for London Scottish.\nProvincial career.\nHe played for Whites Trial in the 20 December 1946 match. He so impressed that at half time he was to replace Frank Coutts in the Blues Trial side at half-time.\nHe was left out of the final January trial match.\n\"The Scotsman\" newspaper of Thursday 09 January 1947 noting:\nJ . M . Hunter, the Fettesian who has just gone down from Cambridge and now plays for London Scottish, has been left out — an omission for which there may be a reason other than his form but which at least represents a surprise after his receiving a cap against the French.\nInternational career.\nHunter was capped by Scotland just the once. The cap came in 1947 against France.\nThe \"Fifeshire Advertiser\" of 4 January 1947 noted:\nKIRKCALDY'S RUGBY RECORD. J. M. HUNTER IS FOURTH 'CAP.' Kirkcaldy can be proud of its part international rugby. J. M. Hunter, who played for Scotland against France on Wednesday is the fourth Kirkcaldy Rugby Club player represent his country. First was D. D. Howie, who played against England, Ireland, Wales, and South Africa in 1912, and against Wales and France in 1913. G. Thom was capped in 1920 against England, Ireland, Wales and France. R. A. Howie represented Scotland in 1924 against England Ireland, Wales, and France, and in 1925 against England, Ireland, and Wales. J. M. Hunter, who is the son of the Rev. J. M. Hunter, B.D., Abbotshall Church, played several games for Kirkcaldy last season, after he was demobbed. He is at present at Cambridge University.\nMilitary career.\nHe joined the army in 1941 in the Second World War and was rapidly promoted. He became a Lieutenant and then Acting Captain in the Rifle Brigade; and was awarded the Military Cross in 1943 for his service in North Africa.\nThe \"Fife Free Press &amp; Kirkcaldy Guardian\" of Saturday 04 January 1947 noted:\nRUGBY STAR'S SUCCESS. J. M Hunter, formerly of Kirkcaldy Rugby Club, who gained his college blue this season for Cambridge, was representative in the Scottish team which was defeated by France on Wednesday. For the first time the Scottish Rugby Union has recognised this game a full international and all the players who took part will be awarded caps. Last season Hunter played regularly for Kirkcaldy Ist XV, and was undoubtedly one of the leading forwards in the county. This season Dunfermline were keen procure his services, but Hunter went down South to resume his studies and since then has been a regular player in the Cambridge Varsity team. While several occasions Kirkcaldy have had representatives the Midlands trials they have not had an internationalist since Bob Howie was chosen represent Scotland and Britain twenty years ago. The new internationalist is a son of Rev. J M Hunter B.D. of Abbotshall Church, Kirkcaldy. He served with the Rifle Brigade for five years, and was awarded the Military Cross for his services in the North African campaign. He was wounded three times and was some months in hospital. He returned to Cambridge the beginning of 1946 where he has been engaged in research work. He already holds his classics degree.\nFamily.\nHis father was the Rev. John Mercer Hunter (1880-1968) and his mother Frances Margaret Martin (1888-1953).\nHe married Margaret Mary Phyllis Cursiter (1927-1997) in Edinburgh in 1948 at Murrayfield Parish Church. She was the daughter of Stanley Cursiter, director of the National Galleries of Scotland."

Assistant coach Dan Soper took temporary charge before Richie Murphy became available for the rest of the season.\nEvents.\nSponsorship.\nUlster renewed their sponsorship deal with Kingspan in July 2023 for the coming season, despite criticism of the firm emerging from the Grenfell Tower Inquiry. Their stadium naming deal would continue until the end of the season. In January 2024 it was announced that Kingspan would remain as Ulster's principal sponsor until the end of the 2024-25 season, to give the team time to find a new sponsor.\nPersonnel changes.\nSignings announced for next season include South African prop Steven Kitshoff, from the Stormers, flanker Dave Ewers, from Exeter Chiefs, and former Munster prop James French. Five academy players joined the senior squad on development contracts: lock Harry Sheridan, scrum-half Conor McKee, hooker James McCormick, back row forward Reuben Crothers and centre Ben Carson. After a successful trial in pre-season, Clontarf tighthead prop Ben Griffin was signed on a development contract in August. Former Leinster, Connacht and Jersey Reds prop Greg McGrath joined as injury cover in October.\nFlanker Jordi Murphy and out-half Ian Madigan retired. Lock Frank Bradshaw Ryan left for Montauban. Wings Rob Lyttle and Craig Gilroy announced they would leave at the end of the season. Hooker Declan Moore and scrum-half Michael McDonald moved to Connacht on a season-long loan. Also departing were Sam Carter, Duane Vermeulen, Gareth Milasinovich, Jeffery Toomaga-Allen and Rory Sutherland.\nEleven players joined the academy: props Cameron Doak, Jack Boal and Jacob Boyd; hookers Zac Solomon and Henry Walker; lock Charlie Irvine; back rowers Josh Stevens and Tom Brigg; and outside backs Ethan Graham, Lukas Kenny and Ben McFarlane.\nIain Henderson's central contract with the IRFU was due to expire after the 2023 Rugby World Cup, and there was speculation that he might move abroad.

        "text": "Raymond Dennis Law (born April 4, 1955) is a former American football wide receiver and kick returner who played for the Cincinnati Bengals of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at East Tennessee State University.\nEarly career.\nLaw attended Jefferson High School in Jefferson, Georgia. He competed in football as a wide receiver and in track and field. As a senior in 1972, he was ranked in the top 10 of all Class A wide receivers in the region, and was voted to the Georgia All-State Class A team.\nLaw enrolled at East Tennessee State University as an accounting major, receiving an athletic scholarship in 1973 to join the football team as a freshman. In 1974, Law had redshirted to extend his stay at East Tennessee. For his first two years with East Tennessee, he was a reserve for the wide receiver position but gained the starting role in 1975, where he caught 18 passes in 11 games for 428 yards and a touchdown. Law improved his performance in 1976 with 22 catches in 10 games for 460 yards and a touchdown. Coming into the 1977 season, Law took over the punt and kick-off return position when team injuries caused him to fill in in a game against Murray State. Law became the team's best wide receiver, with 33 catches in 11 games for 488 yards and four touchdowns. Law made 18 returns for 510 yards and two touchdowns, landing him a spot on the All-Ohio Valley team with East Tennessee.\nProfessional career.\nLaw was selected by the Cincinnati Bengals in the fourth round with the 99th pick overall in the 1978 NFL Draft.\nLaw made his NFL debut on September 3, 1978, against the Kansas City Chiefs. Law received 1 pass for 18 yards and returned 4 punts for 29 yards. Law was primarily used as a kick and punt returner for the 1978 season, returning 25 kicks and 2 punts for 136 yards, and receiving 5 passes for 81 yards as a wide receiver. Law is most known for a mistake he made against the Buffalo Bills on October 22, 1978, by breaking an \"unwritten commandment\" of running into the end zone to receive a punt rather than staying on the 10-yard line, where he was tackled by Lou Piccone for a safety, making the game's score 5–0 Bills.\nLaw was traded on August 24, 1979, to the Washington Redskins for an undisclosed draft pick, but was put on the retired list two days later, declaring the trade void. Law was waived off the Bengals and then signed by the Redskins on November 6, 1979, as a replacement for Buddy Hardeman who had suffered a broken jaw. Law was later waived the following week on the 13th to make room for the signing of Bobby Hammond.\nOn April 18, 1980, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers signed Law along with wide receivers Warren Anderson and Randy Simmrin. On August 6, 1980, the Buccaneers waived Law along with tight end Steve Stephens and defensive back Larry Flowers."

Hence, the IOC executive board established and ratified a new qualification system for Paris 2024 that would witness the boxers obtain the quota spots through the continental multisport events, reducing the complexity of the process. The qualification period commences at five regional multisport events in the middle of the 2023 season (2023 African Games in Accra, Ghana; 2022 Asian Games in Hangzhou, China; 2023 European Games in Poland; 2023 Pacific Games in Honiara, Solomon Islands; and the 2023 Pan American Games in Santiago, Chile), set to be served as continental qualifying meets, where a total of 139 spots will be assigned to a specific number of highest-ranked boxers in each weight category. For these reasons, this tournament does not give a quota for the Olympic Games.\nSchedule.\n\"All times are local (UTC+5)\".\nParticipating nations.\n538 athletes from 107 countries participated in the championships.\nControversies.\nBoycott due to participation of athletes from Russia and Belarus.\nIgnoring Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and subsequent recommendations of the International Olympic Committee to bar Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing under their national flags and for the anthems to be played, the International Boxing Association under the leadership of Russian Umar Kremlev allowed them to compete with no restrictions. In the aftermath, 19 countries (21 national federations) decided to boycott the championship over IBA's decision.\nThe nations that boycotted the tournament were:\nKosovo's non-participation.\nKosovo did not attend in protest at the Uzbekistani authorities' request to issue a visa to enter the country and to ban the use of the flag and national anthem.\nHost country attitude.\n\"Uzbekistan is a country that adheres to international sports norms and supports the principle of sports being free from politics.\"\nShohid Tillaboev Secretary General of Uzbekistan Boxing Federation."

        "text": "The 2023–24 North Carolina Tar Heels women's basketball team represented the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the 2023–24 NCAA Division I women's basketball season. The Tar Heels were led by head coach Courtney Banghart, in her fifth season in Chapel Hill. She was assisted by Joanne Aluka-White, Adrian Walters, and Itoro Coleman. The Tar Heels played their home games at Carmichael Arena, as members of the Atlantic Coast Conference.\nThe Tar Heels started the season ranked sixteenth in the nation and won their first five straight games. However, they then lost four of their next five games, including two at their early season tournament, the Gulf Coast Showcase, and their ACC–SEC Challenge matchup. Three of these four losses were to ranked teams, including number 16 Kansas State, number 1 South Carolina and number 17 Connecticut. They finished the non-conference season with two straight wins and a 8–4 record. The Tar Heels won their first three ACC regular season games, including wins over number 25 Syracuse and at number 16 Notre Dame. They dropped a game to number 21 Florida State before winning their next four straight games. Their four game winning streak included a win over number 13 Louisville. The Tar Heels lost their next four straight games and fell out of the national rankings. They lost two of their final six games of the season, including to number 8 Virginia Tech. A highlight of the wins was a rivalry win over number 6 NC State.\nThe Tar Heels finished the season 20–13 overall and 11–7 in ACC play to finish in a tie for seventh place. As the eighth seed in the ACC tournament,lost to ninth seed Miami in the Second Round. They received an at-large invitation to the NCAA Tournament, marking the fourth straight time the Tar Heels qualified for the tournament. As the eighth seed in the Albany 1 region, they defeated ninth seed Michigan State in the First Round before losing at first seed South Carolina in the Second Round to end their season.\nPrevious Season.\nRanked No. 12 in the preseason AP Poll, Banghart's Tar Heels got off to another hot start. They won six straight to start the season, culminating in a come-from-behind victory to defeat No. 5 Iowa State in the championship game of the women's PKI, climbing as high as No. 6 in the nation during their win streak. ACC play proved more challenging for the Tar Heels, as the team would lose its first three conference games in a row before upsetting then-No. 4 Notre Dame at home in Carmichael to earn their first ACC win of the season.\nThe Tar Heels would finish ACC play with an 11–7 conference record, tying Miami for sixth in the regular season standings, but lost the tiebreaker to the Hurricanes and were awarded the 7 seed in the ACC Tournament. They would face and defeat 10th seed Clemson in the second round, giving Coach Banghart her first victory in the ACC tournament as Tar Heel coach.\nAfter being in contention most of the season for a top-four seed in the NCAA Tournament, which would have given them the privilege of hosting first and second round games, the Tar Heels ultimately earned the 6 seed in the Seattle 3 Regional. They would defeat 11 seed St. John's in the first round before losing to 3 seed Ohio State in the second round, ending their season just shy of a second-straight sweet sixteen appearance and with a 22–11 overall record.\nOffseason.\nShortly following the conclusion of the 2022–23 season, guard/forward Destiny Adams announced her intentions to enter the transfer portal via social media. Adams later committed to Rutgers, returning to her home state of New Jersey.\nA day after Adams, multi-year starter Kennedy Todd-Williams also entered the transfer portal, to the surprise of many in Chapel Hill. She committed to Ole Miss shortly thereafter.\nGuards Eva Hodgson and Ariel Young also departed the team at the end of the season. Young was forced to medically retire due to a knee injury sustained in 2021, and Hodgson completed her fifth and final year of college eligibility.\nIn addition to a highly touted incoming recruiting class, Banghart and the Tar Heels have been active in the transfer portal to mitigate the departures, as on April 3, former Boston College F/C Maria Gakdeng committed to the Tar Heels for the 2023–24 season.\nThe Tar Heels added another player from the transfer portal on April 24, when former Iowa State guard and 2022 Big XII Defensive Player of the Year Lexi Donarski committed to the team. She has two years of eligibility remaining.\nThe roster received another boost when 2022 NC Gatorade POY and McDonald's All-American Indya Nivar committed to the team on April 30, in a post on social media. She had spent her first year of college basketball at Stanford.\nAdditions.\nRecruiting Class.\n\"Sources:\"\n† Denotes Walk-On\nSchedule.\nSource\n!colspan=6 style=| Non-Conference Regular Season\n!colspan=6 style=| ACC Regular Season\n!colspan=6 style=| ACC Tournament\n!colspan=6 style=| NCAA Tournament"

Ward was drafted in the fourth round of the 2023 NFL draft by the Minnesota Vikings. He played college football at LSU.\nEarly years.\nWard was born in Moultrie, Georgia. He had two brothers who also played football up to the collegiate level. He attended Colquitt County High School and was one of the school's all-time best defensive backs, recording a career total of 11 interceptions. As a senior, Ward helped the team compile a regular season record of 14–0 before losing in the state championship. He also competed in track and field, winning a regional championship. A three-star prospect, he had initially committed to play college football for the Kentucky Wildcats, but then switched to the LSU Tigers.\nCollege career.\nWard saw immediate playing time as a true freshman in 2019, appearing in 13 games during the team's national championship season, mainly on special teams. After being part of a defense that allowed a record-breaking 623 passing yards in the 2020 season-opening upset loss to Mississippi State Bulldogs and seeing limited action in the subsequent games, Ward rebounded by blocking what would have been a game-tying field goal at the end of regulation by Arkansas in Week 6; he then forced a fumble against Alabama, posted an interception against Florida, and made two against Ole Miss to conclude the season. He finished the year with nine games played, 29 tackles and one touchdown (off an interception against Ole Miss).\nWard moved from cornerback to safety in 2021 and started all 11 games, posting 71 tackles, six pass deflections, two interceptions and one forced fumble. In 2022, he saw action at safety, nickel cornerback and outside cornerback. He appeared in a total of 13 games that year, starting nine, and posted 60 tackles, in addition to one interception and a fumble return for a touchdown. After the season, Ward declared for the NFL Draft.\nProfessional career.\nWard was drafted by the Minnesota Vikings in the fourth round, 134th overall, of the 2023 NFL draft."

He played professionally in Spain, Italy, France and the United Kingdom and played college basketball for the Pacific Tigers.\nA Santa Ana, California native, Cornelius starred at Valley High School where, in his senior season, he averaged 22 points per game, 15 rebounds per game and shot 63% from the field. At the close of the season, he was named the Orange County prep player of the year. Following his high school career, he committed to coach Stan Morrison at the University of the Pacific of the Pacific Coast Athletic Association (PCAA, now known as the Big West Conference), selecting the Tigers over schools such as Louisville, USC and Cal State Fullerton.\nDespite weighing only 183 pounds (at 6 feet, 8 inches tall) upon enrollment, Cornelius proved to be an immediate impact player for the Tigers. He became a starter from his first game and finished the season averaging 12.3 points and 8.1 rebounds per game. In his second season, Cornelius raised his averages to 15.3 points and 9.4 rebounds per game, leading the Tigers to both the PCAA regular season and tournament championships. At the close of his sophomore season, Cornelius was named the PCAA Player of the Year and first-team all-conference. In the 1979 PCAA tournament, Cornelius recorded 21 points and 10 rebounds in the tournament final win over Utah State. He was named tournament most outstanding player, and secured the Tigers' first NCAA tournament berth since 1971.\nFollowing his sophomore season, coach Morrison left Pacific to take the head coaching job at USC and was replaced by Dick Fichtner. The Tigers' team performance slipped, but Cornelius continued to be highly productive, ultimately finishing with career averages of 18.1 points and 8.5 rebounds per game. Cornelius finished his career as the leading scorer in school and conference history (2,065 points), as well as the PCAA all-time leader in rebounds with 973 (conference records since eclipsed).\nAfter the close of his college career, Cornelius was drafted by the Los Angeles Lakers in the third round (65th pick overall) of the 1981 NBA draft. After not making the team, he spent the rest of his career playing in various leagues in Europe for about ten years. He then moved into the business world as an IT consultant and coached high school basketball on the side."

However, this is also the first time the mixed team event has been contested.\nUsually, badminton has seven gold medals in contention, with two medals from the men's and women's team events, and five from the individual events.\nBambang Roedyanto, a technical official for the games, claimed that “Cambodia [wanted] the opportunity to win medals from [badminton], so [the mixed team event] was held with countries [with developing badminton teams]”.\nCambodian badminton player Chourng Meng was revealed to be Chinese badminton player Zhou Meng, the runner-up of the girls' singles event at the 2019 BWF World Junior Championship: in a video that has gone viral, Chourng was suddenly pulled off the field by a man presumed to be a Cambodian official while celebrating her victory in the final.

The next four places went to the top four players on the one-year ranking list who had not already qualified for the tour. Seven players from international championships, two players from the Q Tour, three players from the CBSA China Tour, and two players from the World Women's Snooker Tour also received tour cards.

        "text": "Falcons are a women's franchise cricket team that compete in the FairBreak Invitational T20. The team has no geographical base. The team was founded in 2022. They are currently being captained by Suzie Bates and coached by Joanne Broadbent. The rights and sponsorship of the franchise is currently acquired by K-Man Ventures.\nHistory.\nFalcons were formed in April 2022 to compete in the inaugural edition of the FairBreak Invitational T20, a multi-national women's Twenty20 cricket tournament, with Saba Nasim as the team manager. This was the first time that the team participated in any cricket competition at professional level. In May 2022, the all the tournament matches including the matches played by Falcons were sanctioned by the ICC. The team is made up of some of the best women players as well as emerging players from different countries of the world.\nFalcons were captained by New Zealand cricketer Suzie Bates, and coached by Joanne Broadbent in the 2022 edition. They played their first ever WT20 match on 4 May 2022 against Warriors. They had a good start to their campaign by winning the opening match by 8 wickets, with Chamari Athapaththu hitting a century. They finished fourth in the league stage, winning two out of five matches. Although they lost all of their last three matches, they gained enough points to qualify for the knockout stage. They became the first team to qualify for the final by defeating Spirit by 25 runs. However, they finished as the runners-up of the tournament, losing the final match against Tornadoes by 8 wickets. Chamari Athapaththu was the leading run-scorer in the tournament with 313 runs.\nIn March 2023, K-Man Ventures bought the rights to the franchise and became the sponsor of the team ahead of the 2023 season. Falcons took part in the 2023 season again under the leadership of Suzie Bates, with Joanne Broadbent remaining as the coach. They won three out of their five league matches, and advanced to the knockout stage by beating Falcons by 9 wickets in the last league match. Falcons won the semi-final match against Barmy Army by 6 wickets and thus qualified for the final of the tournament. However, they again became the runners-up by losing the final by 94 runs in reply to Warriors' target of 204 runs. \nCoaching staff.\nThe following coaching panel was formed ahead of the 2023 season."

        "text": "The ICC Men's T20 World Cup is the international championship of Twenty20 (T20) cricket. A Twenty20 International (T20I) is an international cricket match between two teams, each having T20I status, as determined by the International Cricket Council (ICC), the sport's world governing body. In a T20I, each team plays a single innings, which is restricted to a maximum of 20 overs. In cricket, a five-wicket haul (also known as a \"five–for\" or \"fifer\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded by the critics as a notable achievement. As of the 2022 ICC Men's T20 World Cup, the most recent to take place, there have been ten five-wicket hauls taken by ten cricketers.\nThe first five-wicket haul in an ICC Men's T20 World Cup match, as well as in any T20I match, was taken by Umar Gul of Pakistan, with bowling figures of five wickets for 6 runs. He achieved the feat on 13 June 2009 while playing against New Zealand at The Oval during the 2009 ICC World Twenty20. The second bowler to take a five-for was Sri Lanka's Ajantha Mendis, who picked up six wickets for 8 runs, recording the best bowling figures in the T20 World Cup to date. He set the record while playing against Zimbabwe, on 18 September 2012 during the 2012 ICC World Twenty20. On 27 March 2014, Ahsan Malik of the Netherlands took five wickets conceding 19 runs against South Africa during the 2014 ICC World Twenty20. With this, he became the first player from an associate nation to claim a five-wicket haul in a T20 World Cup match. Rangana Herath's five-for against New Zealand on 31 March 2014 is the most economical five-wicket haul in the T20 World Cup. He picked up five wickets conceding just 3 runs, at an economy rate of 0.85. He averaged 0.60 in that match, which is also the best average for a five-for in the T20 World Cup. On 26 March 2016, at the age of 20, Mustafizur Rahman picked up five wickets for 22 runs against New Zealand during the 2016 edition, becoming the youngest player to claim a five-wicket haul in the championship. Mujeeb Ur Rahman of Afghanistan was the first player to claim a five-wicket haul on his T20 World Cup debut, which he achieved while playing against Scotland on 25 October 2021, during the 2021 edition. \nThe 2007 and 2010 editions were the only tournaments where no five-wicket hauls were taken. Every other season except 2009 and 2022 saw two five-wicket hauls. There have been three instances when players from Sri Lanka have taken a five-for in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup, the most for any team in the competition."

The 18-hole golf course was designed by Alister MacKenzie.\nSand Moor is regarded as one of the best courses in Yorkshire, and has hosted many important professional and elite amateur tournaments, including the Yorkshire Evening News Tournament (9 times between 1931 and 1963) and the Leeds Cup (1946).\nHistory.\nIn 1921, Henry Barran began construction of a golf course designed by Alister MacKenzie either side of Alwoodley Lane; it was opened to the public in July 1922. In 1925, Sand Moor Golf Club was formed and, with the club agreeing to lease the course from Barran, the intention to make the course private was announced. The club officially opened in March 1926; the event was commemorated with an exhibition match involving George Duncan, George Gadd, Arthur Havers and Abe Mitchell.\nIn the 1960s, Sand Moor purchased additional land and the club relocated entirely to the North of Alwoodley Lane, with the course being altered under the guidance of Henry Cotton. Further land was leased in 1971, and four new holes were constructed."

        "text": "The 2023 Kentucky Derby (officially the 2023 Kentucky Derby presented by Woodford Reserve) was the 149th running of the Kentucky Derby. It took place on May 6, 2023, the first Saturday in May, in Louisville, Kentucky. The race was open to 20 horses, who qualified for the race by earning points on the 2023 Road to the Kentucky Derby. The Kentucky Derby is a Grade I stakes race at a distance of and has been run at Churchill Downs racetrack since its inception in 1875. The purse for 2023 was million. The race was won by Mage.\nThe race was broadcast by NBC, with coverage of undercard races beginning at 10:30 am EDT on USA Network and main network coverage of pre-race activities starting at 12:30 pm EDT. It was also livestreamed on NBCSports.com. According to \"The Blood-Horse\", NBC's broadcast \"averaged a Total Audience Delivery (TAD) of 14.8 million viewers—making it the most-watched sporting event and second most watched show (behind only the Academy Awards) since Super Bowl LVII in February.\"\nDuring the week of the 2023 Derby, seven horses died at Churchill Downs, including two who were euthanized prior to the signature race on Saturday.\nQualification.\nThe field is limited to twenty horses who qualify based on points earned in the 2023 Road to the Kentucky Derby, a series of designated races that was first introduced in 2013. This point system replaced the previous graded stakes race earnings system. The Main Road consists mostly of races in North America and one in Dubai, the Japan Road consists of four races in Japan, and the European Road consists of seven races in Great Britain, Ireland and France.\nEntries.\nThe draw for the event was held at Churchill Downs at 2:00 p.m. on May 1, 2023. Forte was installed as the 3-to-1 favorite and drew post number 15. \nThree horses were withdrawn from the Derby two days before the race. On May 4, trainer Tim Yakteen withdrew Practical Move after the horse developed a fever, which allowed the Dale Romans-trained Cyclone Mischief to qualify from the also-eligible list. Later that day, Wood Memorial winner Lord Miles was withdrawn by order of the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission, which announced that all horses trained by Saffie Joseph Jr. could not race until further notice after two of them collapsed and died following races run at Churchill on April 29 and May 2. The withdrawal of Lord Miles allowed Japanese horse Mandarin Hero to take part in the race. The third and final also-eligible, the Ron Moquett-trained King Russell, qualified for the Derby on the evening of May 4 after another Japanese contender, Continuar, was withdrawn by trainer Yoshito Yahagi. On the day before the Derby, John Shirreffs withdrew Skinner after that horse developed a temperature. On May 6, just hours before the Derby was scheduled to start, Forte was withdrawn from the race. Mike Repole, the co-owner of Forte, cited the cause as a bruised right foot.\nHorse deaths.\nSeven horses died at Churchill Downs during the week of the Kentucky Derby, including two horses that died in undercard races on the day of the Derby. Wild on Ice, a Derby contender, was hurt while training on April 27 and was euthanized. On April 29, Code of Kings died after flipping and breaking his neck. Take Charge Briana was injured in a race on May 2 and was euthanized. On May 4, trainer Saffie Joseph Jr. was suspended indefinitely by Churchill Downs after two of his horses, Parents Pride and Chasing Artie, died. Parents Pride suddenly died on April 29 and Chasing Artie collapsed and died following a race on May 2. As of May 6, investigators had not determined the cause of death for Joseph's horses.\nChloe's Dream and Freezing Point were euthanized on May 6 after being injured in undercard races. Chloe's Dream injured his right front knee in the second race and went into an equine ambulance; he was euthanized after. In the eighth race, Freezing Point was injured after being bumped in the backstretch and went into an equine ambulance. His injured left front ankle was reportedly put in a splint, but he was eventually euthanized.\nResult.\nMage won by a length with a time of 2:01.57. Initially, he broke slowly and was near the back of the pack. Verifying, Kingsbarns and Reincarnate set a fast pace with fractions of :22.35, :45.73 and 1:10.11. Mage was in sixth place by the mile marker. He charged to the outside of Two Phil's, overtook Two Phil's down the stretch and held off Two Phil's and Angel of Empire for the win.\nMage had only one win before the Kentucky Derby.

        "title": "Bill Stewart (rugby union)",
        "text": "Bill Stewart (23 October 1889 – 29 April 1958) was a Scotland international rugby union player.\nRugby Union career.\nAmateur career.\nHe played rugby union in Tasmania, before travelling to Great Britain.\nHe played for London Scottish but could only get a match in their 2nd XV.\nHe then moved and played rugby union for London Hospital.\nProvincial career.\nHe played for Whites Trial on 21 December 1912.\nHe played for Scotland Probables on 18 January 1913.\nHe played for Anglo-Scots against Provinces District on 27 December 1913.\nInternational career.\nThe Scottish Referee of 26 June 1911 notes that Stewart is 'of Scottish parentage and a native of Inverness'.\nHe was capped 4 times for the Scotland international rugby union team between 1913 and 1914. He scored 8 tries in the 4 matches.\nHis 4 tries in a match against Ireland, is second only to George Campbell Lindsay scoring 5 tries in a match against Wales in 1887, although the 4 tries in a match has been equalled a few times, most recently by Kyle Steyn against Tonga in 2021.\nStewart was noted as the first 'Flying Scotsman', the others being Eric Liddell and then Ian Smith. However it was noted that Smith was the best of the three, as Stewart and Liddell were essentially converted sprinters to rugby union; whilst Smith was an extremely fast rugby union player. The \"Dundee Courier\" of 17 January 1929 recording the difference:\nScotland has been lucky in being able to place at least one \"Flying Scotsman\" on a three-quarter wing for a good number of seasons. Her good fortune started in 1913, when the selectors discovered W. A. Stewart, of London Hospital, who played four times for his country in 1913 and 1914. Then, when things seemed so hopeless after the war, Caledonia produced Eric Liddell, the champion runner. Liddell started his 6 international career in 1922. Stewart had proved to be merely a runner, and it cannot be said that Liddell was much more than a sprinter either, as he did not play a \" heady\" game. It was left to Ian Smith, his successor, show that speed and brains could be combined at Rugby football.\nAthletics career.\nThe Dundee Courier of 28 December 1912 noted that:\nStewart is new to international [rugby union] football. He is Tasmanian with good Scottish credentials, and is the holder of the 100 and 220 Scottish amateur athletic championships.\nStewart was a Scottish champion sprinter. From \"The Scottish Referee\" newspaper of Monday 20 January 1913:\nThere seems good reason to fancy that the Rugby Union Selectors have unearthed in W. A. Stewart, the Scottish champion sprinter, a gem of the first water, and anticipating their selection, we should say that he will be included in every International match of the season. At the beginning of this season he was reckoned a player only value for his place in the second team of the London Scottish, but a man possessed of such outstanding merit was bound to come to the front, and, like a name: of his he has jumped right from the junior Scottish side to Internationalist, and, let us say, one of the best of modern times. Stewart is one of the grandest players we have had in Scotland for a long time, and there seems every reason to hope that he will be able to assist his country, both in the Rugby and athletic fields for many a year.\nAnd from the same newspaper of Monday 17 March 1913:\nW. A STEWART, London Hospital F.C, Although Scotland has had a few lean seasons recently, events point to the Thistle occupying a much more important position in the Rugby world in the near future. It is now six seasons since Scotland won the International Championship, and at one time there mere hopes that this season she would occupy that proud position, but those hopes were rudely shattered, not through the inability of the men to play the game, but through accidents, which deprived us of the services of many fine players. The trials disclosed many men capable of great things, and one of them was W. A. Stewart., who has now had the honour of representing Scotland in a dual capacity. When it is considered that Stewart was only playing second-rate football a year ago, his advance has been phenomenal, and although yet he is not a football artist, there are indications that he will be one of the greatest finds Scotland has had in recent years. Against Wales he did not get a chance —none of the backs did ; but against Ireland it was his resolute - running that won the day. Unfortunately for Scotland, he was unable to turn out against England, when a runner a yard or two faster than Sutherland might have rounded Coates. In his other capacity he has proved of yeoman service. In 1911 he won the 100 yards S.A.A. championship, and the following year enhanced his reputation by carrying off both the 100 and 220 yards, depriving R. C. Duncan of both honours. He has accomplished a number of splendid performances representing the United Hospitals, and in the South is regarded as one of the best of British amateur sprinters. Stewart is certain to represent Scotland in many more representative games.\nMedical career.\nHe was a medical student attached to London Hospital.\nMilitary career.\nIn the First World War he joined the Royal Army Medical Corps. The \"Edinburgh Evening News\" of 16 June 1915 noted that he returned from the front, injured after being shot in the ankle:\nLieutenant W. A. Stewart, of the R.A.M.C., the Scottish sprint champion and Rugby international, who was wounded in the ankle in Festubert, is home from the front.\nFamily.\nHis father was William Robert Stewart (1852-1939), and his mother was Alexandra Louise Button (1863-1954). Both were born in Tasmania, which somewhat belies the Scottish Referee assertion of Scottish parentage. However, there were Scottish familial roots. William Robert Stewart's father [and hence Bill Stewart's grandfather], Dr. William Robert Stewart (died 1874), was Scottish and was a member of the Scottish Kirk in Evandale, Tasmania.\nBill Stewart was the only son of William and Alexandra's 4 children."

The trophy commemorated the tragic events of 1953, when 151 people on the train from Wellington to Auckland on Christmas eve - including Nerissa Love, the fiancé of New Zealand fast bowler Bob Blair - lost their lives in the rail disaster. The disaster coincided with the second Test between New Zealand and South Africa, where Bob Blair was playing the match.\nGoing into the series, South Africa had never lost a Test series against New Zealand, in 17 meetings. \nNew Zealand won the first Test by 281 runs. New Zealand also won the second Test by 7 wickets, and went on to win the series 2–0. It was the first time New Zealand won a Test series against South Africa.\nSquads.\nIn December 2023, Cricket South Africa (CSA) announced an understrength Test team for the tour, composed of players with little or no Test cricket experience, in order to allow their best players to remain in South Africa to compete in the SA20 (a domestic Twenty20 franchise tournament). The decision was widely criticised. Former Australian captain Steve Waugh was particularly critical, stating his opinion that Test cricket was in danger of no longer being the highest format of the game as the best players were incentivised to play Twenty20 because of better pay.\nOn 16 January 2024, Edward Moore was added to South Africa's squad.\nNew Zealand's William O'Rourke was only selected for the second Test.\nOn 8 February 2024, New Zealand's Daryl Mitchell was ruled out of the second Test due to an injury."

        "text": "The 2023 UEFA Nations League final was a football match that determined the winners of the final tournament of the 2022–23 UEFA Nations League. It was the third final of the international football competition involving the men's national teams of the member associations of UEFA. The match was held on 18 June 2023 at De Kuip in Rotterdam, Netherlands, and was contested by Croatia and Spain.\nSpain won the match 5–4 on penalties following a 0–0 draw after extra time for their first UEFA Nations League title.\nVenue.\nDe Kuip was chosen by the Royal Dutch Football Association as one of the two venues for the Nations League Finals, along with De Grolsch Veste. Amsterdam's Johan Cruyff Arena, which is the largest stadium in the Netherlands, was unavailable because of a concert. Consequently, De Kuip, the second-largest stadium in the country, was selected to host the first semi-final, featuring the Dutch team, as well as the final.\nDe Kuip (Dutch for \"the Tub\"), officially known as the Stadion Feijenoord, is situated in the Feijenoord district of Rotterdam. The stadium, characterised by its distinctive bowl-shaped design, has a seating capacity of 51,117 and is the home of Eredivisie club Feyenoord. Construction began on the stadium in 1935, and it opened in March 1937. The stadium underwent extensive renovations in 1994, becoming an all-seater, with an extended roof to cover all seats. The venue hosts selected matches of the Netherlands national team, and has also been the site of the KNVB Cup final since 1989. De Kuip has hosted numerous UEFA club finals, including two in the European Cup (1972 and 1982), six in the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup (1963, 1968, 1974, 1985, 1991 and 1997) and two in the UEFA Cup (the 1974 second leg and 2002). In addition, it was one of the venues for UEFA Euro 2000, hosting five matches, including the final between France and Italy. The stadium has also been used as a concert venue since 1978.\nRoute to the final.\n\"Note: In all results below, the score of the finalist is given first (H: home; A: away).\"\nMatch.\nSummary.\nIn the 84th minute Spain's Ansu Fati had a shot cleared off the line by Ivan Perišić. After a goalless match the game went to extra-time and finally to penalties. The first six penalties were all scored before Spanish goalkeeper Unai Simón saved with his foot from Lovro Majer.\nBoth teams scored another penalty before Aymeric Laporte had the chance to win the game but hit his shot off the bar. Simón then saved down to his right from Bruno Petković with Dani Carvajal going on to win it for Spain by chipping into the net for a 5–4 win.\nDetails.\n&lt;section begin=Final /&gt;&lt;section end=Final /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=Lineups /&gt;\n&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;section end=Lineups /&gt;\nMatch rules"

MLB has discussed preparations for another round of expansion. Several investment groups are vying for an MLB franchise.\nBackground.\nFor a 50-year period from 1903 to 1952, MLB's 16-team structure (split into the American and National Leagues) remained intact. No franchises were relocated during this period, and five markets—Boston, Chicago, New York City, Philadelphia, and St. Louis—had two or more teams. According to authors Andy McCue and Eric Thompson, \"The less financially successful clubs in two-team cities were finding it increasingly difficult to compete\" by the early 1950s. In addition, population changes in the United States were leading to many citizens moving away from the Northeast, where many MLB teams were based, to southern and western locations.\nFrom 1953 to 1955, three franchises were relocated, all of which had been in markets with two or more teams. Prior to the 1958 season, the two New York City teams in the NL, the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants, moved westward; the Dodgers relocated to Los Angeles, while San Francisco became the new home of the Giants. \nMLB's perceived threat of proposed Continental League.\nDue to the relocation of the Dodgers and Giants, a third major league for baseball, the Continental League, was proposed by lawyer William Shea in November 1958. Shortly after in December, MLB had created an Expansion Committee. On July 27, 1959, the new league was formally announced, with teams in Denver, Houston, Minneapolis–St. Paul, New York City, and Toronto, with three other cities later picked by January 1960, Atlanta, Dallas–Fort Worth, and Buffalo, set to start on April 18, 1961. In addition to the pressures of the proposed Continental League, MLB was facing pressure from the U.S. Congress, which indicated that efforts to prevent future expansion would arouse interest in weakening the sport's exemption from antitrust laws. Congress voted on a bill aimed at repealing the exemption, but it failed. \nHowever, MLB moved to expand after a rival league became a possibility. MLB formed an expansion committee, which voted in favor of adding four new teams, two in each league, by 1961–62. MLB sought cities that had received interest from the Continental League as a means to stop its formal start. Among them, were Houston, Los Angeles, New York City, and Washington, D.C, which were all granted franchises by late 1960. As a concession by William A. Shea, part of his negotiations with Major League Baseball to expand to incorporate at least eight new teams, the Continental League formally disbanded on August 2, 1960.\n1961 AL expansion: Los Angeles Angels and second Washington Senators.\nLos Angeles Angels.\nActor Gene Autry led a group that paid $2.1 million for the right to place an MLB team in Los Angeles. Autry, who owned radio stations, had been seeking to acquire a contract to broadcast baseball games when he traveled to MLB's Winter Meetings. After the Meetings, on December 6, 1960, his group received franchise rights. The Los Angeles team was initially scheduled to begin play in 1962, but a relocation plan elsewhere in the AL resulted in the start date being moved up to 1961. The club was named the Los Angeles Angels, after a Pacific Coast League team that had previously played in the city. To secure the name rights, Autry paid a $350,000 fee to Dodgers owner Walter O'Malley, who had purchased the minor league Angels before relocating the Dodgers to Los Angeles.\nWashington Senators.\nWhile initially, leading figures in Minneapolis–St. Paul, Minnesota, had sought an expansion franchise, in October 1960, the AL permitted the Washington Senators to move in time for next year's season, and gave Washington, D.C., an expansion team. The former Senators changed their name to the Minnesota Twins, and the new expansion team took the Senators name. The decision was partially in response to pressure from Congress, which had wanted a replacement for the former Senators. As with the Angels' ownership group, the new Senators' owners paid a $2.1 million fee for the right to an MLB franchise. This new Washington Senators group plays today in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex following relocation in 1972 as the Texas Rangers.\n1962 NL expansion: Houston Colt .45s and New York Mets.\nThe NL announced an expansion as the 1960 World Series was in progress, with new teams in Houston and New York City. William Shea had been a supporter of the Continental League concept, and had attracted several investors. A potential Houston team also had numerous partners, many of whom had oil interests. The AL initially showed interest in adding a Houston team, but the investors wanted an NL franchise. MLB granted the two cities franchises on October 17, 1960.\nHouston Colt .45s.\nThe Houston Sports Association was formed in 1957 and bought a minor league baseball team four years later. The group was given a controlling interest in Houston's expansion team, which was named the Houston Colt .45s. It played at Colt Stadium. It would only be a few years later in that the team would become the Houston Astros. In , the Astros transferred into the American League.\nNew York Mets.\nFollowing the announcement of the Dodgers and Giants leaving New York City, the city formed the Mayor's Committee, headed by lawyer William Shea. Though New York City sought a replacement NL franchise (strongly supported by city Mayor Robert Wagner), MLB displayed little intention of adding a New York team, despite the formation of the Expansion Committee. With Shea's Continental League project and pressure from Congress, MLB eventually gave in and rewarded New York with a National League franchise, effectively killing the Continental League project. On May 8, 1961, the club announced the name of the team would be the New York Mets, named after a shortened version of the 1880s team, the New York Metropolitans.\nThe city was unable to secure funding for a proposed Flushing Meadows stadium in time for play in 1962, so the Mets played at the Polo Grounds, the previous home of the New York Giants. George Weiss was the president of the team, and seven-time World Series championship-winning manager Casey Stengel was hired to lead the Mets on the field. Thanks to Shea's efforts to bring National League baseball back to New York, Shea Stadium the stadium the Mets would play in from 1964 to 2008, was named in his honor.\n1969 expansion: Kansas City Royals, Seattle Pilots, Montreal Expos, and San Diego Padres.\nAL expansion.\nKansas City Royals.\nFollowing the departure of the Kansas City Athletics to Oakland following the end of the , US Senator Stuart Symington threatened to challenge Major League Baseball's antitrust exemption with federal legislation, and to also challenge the reserve clause. Kansas City mayor Ilus Davis threatened a lawsuit to block the move. Tom Yawkey arranged a meeting of the owners during a convention, during which the league agreed to accelerate the expansion process and assured that Kansas City would be granted a new franchise to begin play no later than the . This would require another franchise to be established at the same time to ensure the league had an even number of teams for a balanced schedule. Ewing Kauffman won rights to the franchise and paid a $5.5 million expansion fee for the Kansas City Royals, which played games at Municipal Stadium until the end of the 1972 season, after which the team moved to Royals Stadium, now known as Kauffman Stadium.\nSeattle Pilots.\nBecause of failed attempts to attract existing teams, Seattle instead tried to lobby for an expansion franchise at the 1967 owners' meetings in Chicago. The delegation also had support from two US Senators, Henry M. Jackson and Warren Magnuson, the latter of whom was the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, a committee which has \"jurisdiction over the major league's business activities\". Coupled with Symington's threats related to the move of the Kansas City Athletics, the political influence swayed the American League owners. However, they were reluctant to expand in 1969 without a Seattle stadium bond issue. The Seattle delegation assured the owners that Sick's Stadium could be renovated in five months to fulfill the minimum requirements until a new stadium was built; with this, the owners agreed to a 1969 expansion, and approved teams in Kansas City and Seattle. \nIn December 1967 at the Winter Meetings in Mexico City, the franchise was officially awarded to Pacific Northwest Sports, led by Dewey Soriano, which received $5.5 million in funding from William R. Daley, who thus had 47% ownership of the venture. Other owners included Max and Dewey Soriano. The award was contingent on renovation of Sick's Stadium to increase its seating capacity from 11,000 to 30,000 by the start of the 1969 season. The Sorianos persuaded notable athletes to advocate for the $40 million King County stadium bond issue, including baseball players Mickey Mantle, Carl Yastrzemski, and Joe DiMaggio, and football player Y. A. Tittle; the bond issue was approved by 62.3% of the electorate. The Seattle Pilots would eventually be declared bankrupt in 1970 and the team was sold to Bud Selig, who moved the team to Milwaukee after only one season in Seattle and renamed it as the present-day Milwaukee Brewers. The team would eventually be transferred to the National League in as a result of expansion that season.\nNL expansion.\nMontreal Expos.\nMontreal City Councilor Gerry Snyder spoke to Ford Frick sometime after the 1962 Major League Baseball expansion, during which he was told Montreal would not receive an expansion franchise unless it had a stadium in which to contest matches. At the Winter Meetings in Mexico City on December 2, 1967, Snyder presented a proposal to Major League Baseball owners to establish a franchise in the city. Several influential owners pledged their support for a Montreal franchise in that meeting, including Walter O'Malley, Roy Hofheinz, and John Galbreath. Certain that Hofheinz would object to a Dallas–Fort Worth bid and that the San Diego bid was near certain to be successful, Snyder deemed a bid from Buffalo to be the strongest bid against which to compete.\nOn 27 May 1968, the National League officially awarded a franchise to Montreal to commence play in the 1969 season. National League president Warren Giles had encouraged the owners during the meeting, stating \"If we're going to expand, let's really spread it out\". The Montreal Expos became the first franchise to be awarded to a city outside the United States. When the news reached the U.S. Congress, members collectively condemned the decision.\nBecause of the slow pace of progress in meeting commitments, Jean-Louis Lévesque withdrew his financial support in the franchise on July 31, 1968. Snyder quickly found another investor, Charles Bronfman, and the team met the deadline of 15 August for the initial $1.1 million installment, before which Jarry Park was selected as the team's stadium for the short term. Renovations to the park were made by adding uncovered bleacher seats along the right and left field lines, and an electronic scoreboard installed beyond right field. The team had some issues committing to a new stadium, as required by the franchise award, and it was said that the team had agreed to build a dome at the Autostade and use it as their stadium if a new stadium was not built by 1970. It had originally intended to lease the stadium and expand its seating capacity from 26,000 to 37,000, but then chose Jarry Park instead.\nThe ownership group paid $12.5 million for the team. John McHale was hired as the team's first president, and Jim Fanning its first general manager. Many names had been considered for the team, including \"Royals\" which had a strong association with the city, but the name had already been adopted by the new Kansas City franchise. After rejecting various options, including \"Voyageurs\" and \"Nationals\", the name \"Expos\" was chosen in honour of Expo 67 and because it was the same in both of the city's official languages. McHale stated that the name would \"help Montreal be identified properly as the city that gave the world Expo 67\".\nThe Montreal Expos would eventually relocate to Washington, D.C. for the as the Washington Nationals.\nSan Diego Padres.\nIn 1967, C. Arnholt Smith, owner of the PCL San Diego Padres (PCL), won a bid for an expansion team in the National League for the . On May 27, 1968, the National League officially awarded a franchise to San Diego to commence play in the 1969 season for a fee of $12.5 million for the team. After the 1968 PCL season, Smith surrendered the franchise, which moved to Eugene, Oregon, and transferred the Padre name to his new NL team, the San Diego Padres. Eddie Leishman was named general manager of the MLB Padres, with club president and minority investor Buzzie Bavasi, formerly GM of the Los Angeles Dodgers (having resigned to take the new role), playing a dominant role in its baseball operations as president of the team.\n1977 AL expansion: Seattle Mariners and Toronto Blue Jays.\nSeattle Mariners.\nFollowing the bankruptcy and departure of the Seattle Pilots on April 1, 1970, the city of Seattle, King County and the state of Washington sued the American League for breach of contract. The $32.5 million lawsuit proceeded until 1976, when at trial the American League offered the city a franchise in exchange for the city, county, and state to drop the suit. On November 2, 1972, King County had broken ground on the Kingdome, which would come to be used by the Seattle Mariners for baseball and by the Seahawks for football.\nOn January 15, 1976, the expansion franchise was approved, becoming the 13th franchise in the American League. It was owned by Lester Smith and Danny Kaye, who paid an expansion fee of million. Owing to the history surrounding the franchise, sportswriter Emmett Watson of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer joked that the team should be named the \"Seattle Litigants\".\nToronto Blue Jays.\nToronto had previously been involved with the failed Continental League. In 1974, the Toronto City Council approved a further for renovations to Exhibition Stadium, retrofitting the stadium for baseball and would be ready in time for the 1977 season. There had been strong interest from several groups and individuals to own a Major League Baseball team in the city. The most prominent was Labatt Brewing Company, who wanted to use ownership of a sports team as a means to establish a visible presence in the Toronto market. Labatt Brewing Company would go on to fail at acquiring and relocating the Baltimore Orioles and the Cleveland Indians to Toronto. Soon after in February 1976, the Labatt Brewing Company would again fail to acquire and relocate a third team, this time the San Francisco Giants. Following this failure, Toronto City Council alderman Paul Godfrey received a phone call from Kansas City Royals owner Ewing Kauffman informing him that he supported a Toronto franchise for the American League.\nDuring an owners meeting held on March 20, 1976, the American League franchises voted 11-1 to expand the league with a Toronto franchise, to which National League owners resolved to consider a Toronto franchise to begin play in the 1977 season. Bowie Kuhn, at the time the Commissioner of Baseball, planned for the National League to expand with new franchises in Toronto and Washington, D.C., and for the American League to add a new franchise in New Orleans in addition to the already-awarded Seattle franchise. On March 29, National League owners met and voted in favour of the expansion plans, but they were rejected because the vote was not unanimous, with dissenting votes from the owners of the Cincinnati Reds and Philadelphia Phillies. A subsequent vote on April 26 ended this plan with a 7–5 result in favour of the proposal, again failing to achieve unanimity.\nTwo groups bid for the rights to franchise ownership in the city, which presented bids during an American League owner's meeting on March 26, 1976. Ultimately, an ownership group named Metro Baseball Ltd. consisting of Labatt Brewing Company, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, and Imperial Trust won the bid for a franchise fee of . The other bid was made by Atlantic Packaging. The winning bid was represented by legal counsel Herb Solway and Gord Kirke. Kirke prepared the original documents which led to the foundation of the team in 1976, named the Toronto Blue Jays.\n1993 NL expansion: Colorado Rockies and Florida Marlins.\nIn June 1991, the MLB expansion committee accepted the bids of the Miami and Denver groups to debut in 1993. Expansion was approved unanimously by all teams in July 1991.\nColorado Rockies.\nDenver, Colorado had previously been involved with the failed Continental League. After previous failed attempts to bring Major League Baseball to the state of Colorado (most notably the Pittsburgh Pirates nearly relocating to Denver following the Pittsburgh drug trials in 1985), by the late 1980s a team seemed to be a possibility in Denver. Eugene Orza, associate general counsel of the Major League Baseball Players Association, stated that he expected Denver would receive one of the expansion franchises. \nThe Colorado Baseball Commission, led by banking executive Larry Varnell, was successful in getting Denver voters to approve a 0.1% sales tax to help finance a new baseball stadium. Also, an advisory committee was formed in 1990 by then-Governor of Colorado Roy Romer to recruit an ownership group. The group selected was led by John Antonucci, an Ohio beverage distributor, and Michael I. Monus, the head of the Phar-Mor drugstore chain. Local and regional companies—such as Erie Lake, Hensel Phelps Construction, KOA Radio, and the \"Rocky Mountain News\"—rounded out the group. The Denver group chose to call their franchise the Colorado Rockies, the same name used as the National Hockey League franchise that played in Denver from 1976 to 1982.\nFlorida Marlins.\nU.S. Senator Connie Mack III from Florida, the grandson of baseball great Connie Mack and a member of the Senate Task Force on Major League Baseball, pushed Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent to expand to Florida. \nOn June 10, 1990, Wayne Huizenga, CEO of Blockbuster Entertainment Corporation, was awarded an expansion franchise in the National League (NL) for a $95 million expansion fee and the team began operations in 1993 as the Florida Marlins, beating out bids in Orlando and Tampa Bay. Orlando fielded a very spirited campaign bolstered by its family-oriented tourism industry. Tampa Bay already had a baseball park — the Florida Suncoast Dome in St. Petersburg, completed in 1990. The Miami group chose to call themselves the \"Florida\" Marlins to broaden their fanbase to the entire state, while reviving the nickname \"Marlins\" from previous minor league teams, the Miami Marlins of the International League from 1956 to 1960, and the Miami Marlins (1962–1970) and Miami Marlins (1982–1988) teams that played in the Florida State League.\nWith the enfranchisement of a team in the Tampa Bay area and a new stadium in Miami proper, the Florida Marlins would rename as the Miami Marlins in 2012.\n1998 expansion: Arizona Diamondbacks and Tampa Bay Devil Rays.\nArizona Diamondbacks.\nIn the fall of 1993, Jerry Colangelo, majority owner of the Phoenix Suns, the area's NBA franchise, announced he was assembling an ownership group, \"Arizona Baseball, Inc.\", to apply for a Major League Baseball expansion team. This was a local group formed to preserve Cactus League spring training in Arizona and eventually secure a Major League franchise for the state.\nColangelo's group was so certain that they would be awarded a franchise that they held a name-the-team contest for it, with the final choice being \"Diamondbacks\", after the Western diamondback, a rattlesnake native to the region known for injecting a large amount of venom when it strikes.\nColangelo's bid received strong support from one of his friends, Chicago White Sox and Chicago Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf, and media reports say that then-acting Commissioner of Baseball and Milwaukee Brewers founder Bud Selig was also a strong supporter of Colangelo's bid. Plans were also made for a new retractable-roof ballpark, to be built in an industrial/warehouse district on the southeast edge of downtown Phoenix, one block from the Suns' America West Arena (now Footprint Center). On March 9, 1995, Colangelo's group was awarded a franchise to begin play for the . A $130 million franchise fee was paid to Major League Baseball in four payments, over the course of three years. In addition, the Diamondbacks gave away their rights to $5 million from baseball's central fund for each of the five years following expansion (1998–2002).\nArizona had originally been intended to join Tampa Bay in the American League. However, five American League teams had threatened to block the league assignments because of concerns that they would have additional games out of their time zone, causing early starts that would decrease revenue and TV ratings. Thus, on January 16, 1997, the Arizona Diamondbacks were officially voted into the National League while their expansion counterparts in Tampa Bay were voted into the American League.\nTampa Bay Devil Rays.\nAfter failing to land an expansion team for the 1993 season, the Tampa Bay Baseball Group, the group leading the Tampa Bay area for an expansion team, sued MLB for allegedly reneging on an agreement to grant an expansion team to Tampa. \nLike Phoenix, Arizona, on March 9, 1995, Tampa Bay Baseball Group was awarded a franchise to begin play for the 1998 season, and paid an identical $130 million franchise fee that was paid to Major League Baseball in four payments, over the course of three years. Similarly, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays gave away their rights to $5 million from baseball's central fund for each of the five years following expansion (1998–2002).\nThe suit that was launched in response to the failed 1993 expansion was settled in 2003, five years after the Devil Rays began play in the American League. In 2008, the team would rebrand to their current name, the Tampa Bay Rays.\nExpansion drafts.\nThere have been six expansion drafts in MLB history.\nPotential future expansion sites.\nAfter the 2017 season, Tracy Ringolsby of \"Baseball America\" wrote that there was \"a building consensus\" that MLB would expand to 32 teams. He said that the proposed expansion would allow for divisional realignment to address concerns with travel and off-days in the schedule. Ringolsby also reported that a team would likely go to Portland, Oregon, with Manfred citing a need for another team in the western United States. \nAfter Sportico estimated the average value of an MLB franchise to be $2.2 billion in April 2021, Manfred called it a \"lodestar\" for negotiations for an expansion fee for the team's new owners. Tony Clark, the president of the MLB Players Association, voiced his support for expanding MLB to 32 teams the following year. \nIn April 2023, the Athletics entered into an agreement to relocate to Las Vegas. Las Vegas had been seeking an MLB franchise, either through expansion or relocation of an existing team. On September 19, 2023, the Rays announced plans to build a new ballpark in St. Petersburg adjacent to Tropicana Field, as part of the redevelopment of the Gas Plant District, which is planned to open for the 2028 season. It is expected to be a 30,000 seat fixed-roof stadium which will cost $1.3 billion.\nIn April 2024, the Athletics announced they had entered into an agreement with Sacramento River Cats owner Vivek Ranadive to play the 2025–2027 seasons at their home stadium, Sutter Health Park in West Sacramento, CA.\nCharlotte.\nThe Charlotte Bats is an organization devoted to bringing a major-league baseball team to Charlotte, North Carolina. In March 2023, the deputy mayor of Charlotte said that no plans for a stadium have been submitted to the Charlotte City Council for consideration.\nMontreal.\nThe Montreal Expos, a 1969 expansion team, played for 36 seasons in the NL East before relocating to Washington, D.C., in 2004, becoming the Washington Nationals. \nIn 2019, the Rays received permission to explore splitting their seasons between Tampa Bay and Montreal. MLB rejected the Rays' plan in January 2022.\nIn 2015, Denis Coderre, the mayor of Montreal, and Stephen Bronfman, the son of Expos owner Charles Bronfman, wrote a letter to all 30 MLB teams extolling Montreal as an expansion city. Bronfman is leading a group of investors who are looking to obtain an MLB franchise. He announced an agreement to develop land that would house a new stadium on a plot of land off of Bonaventure Expressway in Peel Basin. His partners include Pierre Boivin, Alain Bouchard, and Mitch Garber. According to \"The Canadian Press\", the ownership group has met MLB's conditions for returning to Montreal.\nNashville.\nMusic City Baseball was founded in 2019 by John Loar and Alberto Gonzales. They brought on Dave Stewart to lead them publicly. The organization is devoted to the founding of a major league team in Nashville, named the \"Nashville Stars\", after the Negro league team of that name. The group initially sought land for a stadium by the Cumberland River, but as of June 2022 was focused on North Nashville near Tennessee State University. The group hopes to privately fund the stadium.\nOrlando.\nOrlando, Florida, has expressed interest in a team, despite the state of Florida already being home to two MLB franchises, in Miami and the Tampa Bay area. In November 2019, Pat Williams, a co-founder of the Orlando Magic of the National Basketball Association (NBA), unveiled the \"Orlando Dreamers\", a concept for an MLB expansion team in Orlando. Thousands of people indicated interest in buying season tickets on the Orlando Dreamers website in the 24 hours after the announcement. The group has proposed building a 45,000-capacity domed stadium on a lot near the Orange County Convention Center along with 1,000 hotel rooms, estimating a cost of $1.7 billion. As of May 2023, the group was seeking $975 million in public funds.\nPortland.\nThe Oregon Legislative Assembly passed Senate Bill 5 in 2003, which could provide $150 million in public funds towards building a stadium.\nIn 2017, the Portland Diamond Project (PDP) was formed by Craig Cheek, a retired vice president for Nike, Inc., and Mike Barrett, a former broadcaster for the Portland Trail Blazers of the NBA. Russell Wilson and Ciara invested in the group in 2018.\nIn 2018, PDP announced an agreement with the Port of Portland to build a 32,000-seat stadium along the Willamette River on a tract of land at Terminal 2 in Northwest Portland. Architecture firm Populous would build the stadium if the proposal is approved. By 2023, PDP had shifted focus and was considering sites at the Lloyd Center shopping mall in downtown Portland or the Redtail Golf Course in neighboring Beaverton. In January 2024, they announced they were in negotiations to purchase the Redtail site.\nRaleigh.\nTom Dundon, the owner of the Carolina Hurricanes of the National Hockey League, has stated his intent to lead a group to submit a bid to bring MLB to Raleigh, North Carolina, during the next phase of expansion. The Hurricanes have committed long-term to the city, until at least 2044, along with the approved $1.1 billion in upgrades for PNC Arena and development of a sports and entertainment district around the arena, which could include a baseball stadium. Dundon has stated that securing the capital necessary is a non-issue.\nSacramento.\nIn April 2024, the Oakland Athletics entered into an agreement to play three or more seasons at the Sacramento River Cats home field, Sutter Health Park in West Sacramento, California. After the press conference announcing the move, Vivek Ranadivé, owner of the River Cats and the Sacramento Kings, stated that, in conversations with MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred, he was told that MLB was seeking to add a west coast expansion franchise. Ranadivé added that he felt Sacramento would move into \"pole position\" for a new team, with the A's sojourn being a \"good showcase\" for the Sacramento market. Ranadivé mentioned the Sacramento Railyards, originally intended as the site for a MLS expansion stadium, as the potential site of a new ball park. Later in the day, Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg also made mention of Sacramento's intention to seek an MLB expansion franchise during a press conference from city hall, referring to the A's stint in Sacramento as an \"audition\" for MLB.\nSalt Lake City.\nIn April 2023, Gail Miller, the widow of Utah Jazz owner Larry H. Miller and co-founder of the Larry H. Miller Company, announced the formation of Big League Utah, a group of investors looking to obtain an expansion MLB franchise for Salt Lake City. They also announced their partnership with Rocky Mountain Power to develop a lot on the city's west side for a stadium. On February 15, 2024, the Larry H. Miller company announced that they plan to invest at least $3.5 billion to towards the lot, bringing mixed-use development to the area, including a baseball stadium.\nTeams.\nThe MLB originated in 1903 with 16 teams, from the signing of the National Agreement between the National League (founded 1876) and the American League (founded 1901). Through a sequence of team expansions, contractions, and relocations, MLB currently consists of 30 teams. The United States is home to 29 teams and one is located in Canada.\nThe following table shows current MLB teams that are participating in the 2024 MLB season, in which city they are located, when the club was founded, joined the MLB, number of times relocated and times the franchise name has changed.\nCurrent.\nNotes:\n†\"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Toronto Blue Jays played the and seasons across several locations. The team played the 2020 season in Buffalo, New York. In April–May 2021, the team played at their spring training location in Dunedin, Florida, in June–July 2021, the team returned to Buffalo, and returned to Toronto on July 30.\""

The final was contested by Leinster and La Rochelle, and a repeat of the 2022 Final which La Rochelle won 24–21.\nThe Aviva Stadium was the host venue of the final, just the second time it has hosted the game having also been the venue in 2013.\nThe match referee was Jaco Peyper, the first South African to referee the European showpiece final.\nLa Rochelle retained the trophy with a 27-26 win over Leinster.\nBackground.\nFor the first time both finalists from a Champions Cup final returned to the following year's final. La Rochelle became the third team after Toulouse (2003-05) and Toulon (2013-15) to appear in three successive finals, while Leinster, for the second year, attempted to match Toulouse's outright record of five European Champions Cups. This was also the first final since 2011 that matched the top two seeds after the pool stage in the showpiece final.\nBoth Leinster and La Rochelle entered the final in similar form, with both teams having won every game in their European campaign. They both topped their respective pool, with Leinster gaining a maximum of 20 points and La Rochelle gaining 18. They both received home advantage through the knock-out stage, before gaining home country advantage in the semi-final to see them through to the final.\nThis was their third meeting in the Champions Cup, with La Rochelle winning both the previous encounters.\nTheir domestic form saw Leinster enter having lost their United Rugby Championship semi-final the week prior, whilst La Rochelle entered having secured a top two seed in the Top 14 with one round left of the regular season.\nBoth teams announced their match-day 23 the day before the game and Leinster had two changes to the starting XV that played in the 2022 Final, whilst La Rochelle had seven changes to the team that played in that final.\nRoute to the final.\n\"Note: In all results below, the score of the finalist is given first (H: home; A: away).\""

The team is organised by the Nevis Cricket Association (NCA) which is a member of the Leeward Islands Cricket Association (LICA), in turn an affiliate of Cricket West Indies.\nPlayers from Nevis represent the Leeward Islands cricket team in West Indian domestic cricket and the West Indies cricket team in international cricket. Nevis is the smaller island in the Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis – both islands field separate teams.\nHistory.\nNevis was admitted to the Leeward Islands Cricket Association in 1949 and competed in the Leeward Islands Cricket Tournament for the first time in that year. Its first match was played against Montserrat.

This was Zimbabwe's first tour to Thailand for a bilateral series. Originally the tour was to consist of just three T20Is, before being expanded to a series of 3 ODIs and 4 T20Is. However, after the completion of the first match of the T20I series, it was announced that the series would be reduced to three matches due to scheduling conflicts with the Southeast Asian Games cricket tournament.\nThailand won all three matches of the ODI series. It was the first ever instance of an associate nation clean-sweeping an ODI series against a full member. Thailand also won the T20I series 2–1."

        "text": "Roderick Taylor (born October 26, 1994) is an American football offensive lineman who is a free agent. He played college football at Ole Miss and was selected in the seventh round (252nd overall) of the 2018 NFL Draft by the Cincinnati Bengals. He has also been a member of the XFL's Team 9, the DC Defenders, and the Vegas Vipers.\nEarly years.\nRoderick Taylor was born on October 26, 1994. He grew up in Jackson, Mississippi and attended Callaway High School, at which he played football, basketball, and ran track. He was a very highly regarded offensive lineman for the school, being ranked as high as the top guard recruit nationally by one source. As a junior he was named \"The Clarion-Ledger\" All-Metro and second-team Class 5A All-State, and as a senior Taylor received numerous honors after posting over 100 pancake blocks with no sacks allowed. He was an Under Armour All-American, first-team All-State, MaxPreps All-American, Medium School All-American and All-Metro selection, and helped Callaway win a school-record 14 games while also earning selection to \"The Clarion-Ledger\"'s Dandy Dozen and Targeted 22 lists, the latter of which he placed first on.\nTaylor was the consensus top-ranked player in the state, a five-star prsopect, and the 25th-best ranked player nationally according to 247Sports. Although for a while it was believed that he would commit to play college football for the Alabama Crimson Tide, he ended up changing to Ole Miss after coach Jeff Stoutland left. As a freshman in 2014, he appeared in all 13 games. He posted his first career start on November 8 against Presbyterian, appearing as their right guard after an injury to Laremy Tunsil. Taylor started one further game on the season, while earning his first varsity letter.\nTaylor was expected to become a full-time starter as a sophomore in 2015, but was hampered by an injury suffered in a non-football activity shortly before the season. Despite this, he was still able to appear in 10 games, two of which he started. In 2016, Taylor earned a starting role at left tackle. He was limited by injuries, however, and only started seven out of 13 games, while appearing in a further two.\nAfter going through several injuries in the prior seasons, Taylor remained healthy as a senior in 2017 and started all 12 games at right tackle. He finished his college career with 44 games played, 23 of which he started. Taylor was named an honorable mention on \"The Clarion-Ledger\"'s Ole Miss 2010s All-Decade team.\nProfessional career.\nCincinnati Bengals.\nTaylor was one of four Ole Miss players to be invited to the 2018 NFL Scouting Combine. He was not a highly ranked prospect with scouts citing doubts relating to his maturity, body control, lack of length and motivation, although he improved his draft stock with an impressive combine performance, including a 5.24 second 40-yard dash. The majority of sources projected him to be a 7th-round draft pick or an undrafted free agent. He ended up being selected by the Cincinnati Bengals, in the 7th round, with the 252nd pick of the 2018 NFL Draft.\nHowever, Taylor suffered a torn ACL in training camp and ended up missing the entirety of his rookie season. He was waived during the following season's training camp, on June 10, 2019. While a free agent in September, he was suspended for four games by the NFL, believed to be for violating the rules on performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs). On October 19, after the suspension ended, he received another, this time for ten games. At the end of December, Taylor received an indefinite ban from the league.\nXFL.\nIn 2020, Taylor was a member of Team 9, which functioned as the practice squad of the XFL. He had his contract terminated when the league suspended operations on April 10.\nAfter then spending two years out of professional football, Taylor was signed by the DC Defenders of the XFL on January 19, 2023. He made the team's final roster. He was ejected from their game against the St. Louis BattleHawks after being involved in a fight, and was fined by the league for it. After having appeared in three games for the Defenders, one as a starter, he was released; however, Taylor was claimed off waivers by the Vegas Vipers on March 13. He was released on April 14."

        "title": "Race Across the World series 3",
        "text": "The third series of \"Race Across the World\" began airing on 22 March 2023. Unlike the transcontinental races in previous series, the race took place entirely in Canada between Vancouver, British Columbia and St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador. Each two-person team was required to cross the country on a route without using air travel, and was given a budget equal to the cost of the air fare. Contestants were provided a map, GPS tracker, travel guide, and bear spray.\nOn 28 September 2022, the BBC announced that the programme was due to enter production later that year, and would move from BBC Two to BBC One. In early 2023, the BBC revealed the five pairs of competitors as Cathie and Tricia, Claudia and Kevin, Ladi and Monique, Marc and Michael, and Mobeen and Zainib.\nOverview.\nThe third series of \"Race Across the World\" was a race between Vancouver and Newfoundland, with air travel prohibited. The race had seven checkpoints with enforced rest periods, with contestants only finding the next destination on arrival at the checkpoints and the first team to arrive at the final checkpoint at Cape Spear would win £20,000.\nTeams were given a budget of £2,498.13 per person – the equivalent air fare for travelling the race route. Contestants were not permitted to subsidise their budgets, but short-term opportunities allowed them to work for money or accommodation. Contestants were not given access to telephones or internet.\nResults summary.\nColour key:\nRoute.\nThe checkpoints in the third series were:\nRace summary.\nLeg 1: Vancouver → Tlell, Haida Gwaii.\nThe race started at 2 pm from Prospect Point in Stanley Park, Vancouver with the first leg finishing north at Haida House at Tllaal, just outside the village of Tlell on the east coast of Graham Island in the Haida Gwaii archipelago.\nThree teams opted to cross the Strait of Georgia, from Horseshoe Bay to Nanaimo on Vancouver Island pursuing a strategy that would involve multiple sea crossings to eventually reach Graham Island. The remaining two teams chose to remain on the mainland, favouring an overland route with an eye to crossing the Hecate Strait by catching a ferry to Graham Island departing from Prince Rupert.\nTricia and Cathie spent several hours trying to get out of Stanley Park and into the city. With daylight fading, they spent their first night at a hostel in Vancouver, only a few miles from the starting point. On Day 2 they chopped logs on a farm in Merritt in exchange for bed and board.\nHaving hitched a lift into Vancouver, Zainib and Mobeen opted to take a coach to Whistler. Discovering that there was no longer any public transport from the resort onward to Prince Rupert, they considered backtracking to Vancouver. Whilst in the resort, they worked in a shop and took a skiing lesson.\nClaudia and Kevin missed their coach by 45 minutes and became stuck in Campbell River on Vancouver Island. They decided to take a very expensive long-distance taxi to Port Hardy, and made back some money by cleaning a boat on Day 3. With another day before the sailing, they chose to experience the wilderness looking for bears before they caught the ferry to Prince Rupert. They took another long-distance taxi ride once they arrived on Graham Island, reducing their starting funds by almost a quarter.\nMarc and Michael headed south after their first night in a motel on Vancouver Island. They worked the land on a farm for a couple of days before securing a ride northwards. In the meantime, Monique and Ladi spent some downtime whilst in Telegraph Cove observing aquatic wildlife.\nAll five teams boarded the same ferry crossing the Hecate Strait from the Port of Prince Rupert to Skidegate, Graham Island on Day 6. The leg culminated in a race to the first checkpoint, with all teams arriving at Haida House within a few minutes of each other.\nLeg 2: Tlell, Haida Gwaii → Dawson City.\nThe race continued from Tlell to former gold rush town of Dawson City almost to the north, in the Yukon.\nAt the start of the second leg, all five teams had to backtrack to Prince Rupert on the mainland using almost the same means of transport as they had used to reach Tlell. With only a matter of minutes separating their restart, they all arrived on the mainland on the same ferry at the same time on Day 10.\nTricia and Cathie took a bus to Terrace and hired a car onward to Whitehorse. They stopped en route in Jade City to work dismantling an old shack for free bed and board. Marc and Michael also rented a car from Terrace, but detoured to go rafting at Haines Junction on the Dezadeash River before continuing to Whitehorse.\nThe other three teams hitched lifts with vehicles travelling north. Monique and Ladi secured rides all the way to Whitehorse but stopped en route at Bear Glacier Provincial Park.\nZainib and Mobeen were the first into the Yukon, but detoured to Burwash Landing to work cleaning a light aircraft in exchange for a flight in it over Kluane National Park. Claudia and Kevin also decided to take a job, cleaning at some kennels for free bed, board and sauna. Both teams found themselves at the same fuel stop on the outskirts of Whitehorse attempting to hitch a lift northwards on the Klondike Highway.\nLeg 3: Dawson City → Banff.\nThe race restarted on Day 15 from Dawson City to the Rocky Mountain resort of Banff in the province of Alberta, some distant, with the team finishing last facing elimination.\nAll teams found that they must head back south along the Klondike Highway. Leaders Tricia and Cathie were first to depart, doing so before the final two teams had even arrived in Dawson City. Their lead allowed them time to earn money working at the Grande Prairie Stompede, but they found themselves stranded there for a further 22 hours.\nWhilst in Dawson City, Monique suffered an injury requiring stitches. Struggling to walk properly, this delayed her and Ladi's restart by three-and-a-half hours. Despite the setback, they headed to the same RV hire company in Whitehorse as Zainib and Mobeen, where both teams managed to secure RVs that needed repositioning to Edmonton at no cost. En route, Monique and Ladi took casual cleaning work at Grande Prairie, and Zainib and Mobeen worked preparing dough for Green Onion Cakes in Edmonton.\nClaudia and Kevin had a free one-way self drive towards Edmonton courtesy of a family with whom they had hitched a ride from Dawson City to Whitehorse. They camped at Muncho Lake before heading towards Fort St. John to work at a craft brewery.\nLeg 4: Banff → Churchill.\nNow reduced to four teams, the race continued from Banff to Churchill on Hudson Bay in the far north; an isolated location without any road connections to the rest of Canada. Despite the seven-hour time differential between first and last place, all four teams left within an hour of each other at dawn on Day 23 because of the danger of bears during the hours of darkness. They soon learnt that the only way to reach Churchill was on the twice-weekly Winnipeg–Churchill train traversing the Hudson Bay Railway, with the next departure from Winnipeg in three days' time.\nThree teams selected a route along the Trans-Canada Highway via the large cities of Calgary and Edmonton. Tricia and Cathie headed on to Saskatoon to work on a farm, while Monique and Ladi opted to work in a bait shop in Prince Albert National Park with the aim of kayaking later on nearby Waskesiu Lake. In the meantime, Zainib and Mobeen opted for a route across the prairies of Saskatchewan to work at a rodeo ranch near Moose Jaw. They eventually intercepted the train at Canora, where they met two other teams – Claudia and Kevin, having arrived in Canora earlier that day, had spent their down-time gardening to earn money. Further along the route at The Pas, all four teams were reunited when Monique and Ladi board the same train.\nAs with Leg 1, all teams arrived at the destination at precisely the same time and the leaderboard was determined by a race to the checkpoint.\nLeg 5: Churchill → Manitoulin Island.\nWith traversed so far, the destination for the fifth leg was Manitoulin island, the largest freshwater Island on Earth. Located approximately to the south, this was the longest leg of the race. With the twice-weekly train the only route out of Churchill, the teams retraced their steps along the Hudson Bay Railway on Day 30.\nAll four teams alighted the train at Thompson, the first stop where the Canadian road network recommences. Claudia and Kevin, and Tricia and Cathie undertook cleaning jobs there before catching an overnight minibus to Winnipeg. The other two teams also took an overnight service to Winnipeg, albeit with a different operator.\nClaudia and Kevin chose to press on to Kenora to work renovating a lakeside property in exchange for cash, bed and board whilst the other three teams remained in Winnipeg, with two of the teams finding work as bakers to help replenish their budgets. Zainib and Mobeen, however, spent time with a Cree family in the nearby city of Selkirk to rest and recuperate after two days of difficult travel.\nThe three teams then caught the bus together the next day out of Winnipeg along the Trans-Canada Highway. Zainib and Mobeen exited the bus at Kenora to earn some money at a working farm just as Claudia and Kevin joined the same bus en route to Thunder Bay. Monique and Ladi, and Tricia and Cathie cleaned boats and an ice hockey arena respectively in Thunder Bay. Claudia and Kevin maintained their lead by continuing further east overnight to Espanola where they hitched a ride to the Little Current Swing Bridge. The remaining three teams caught the Espanola bus a day later, and on arrival they all opted for taxis to Little Current. They were instructed to cross the swing bridge by foot, before learning that the checkpoint was a further south with no public transport links.\nLeg 6: Manitoulin Island → Quebec City.\nThe race continued from Mindemoya on Manitoulin Island, Ontario to the French speaking province of Quebec and its capital, Quebec City on day 36. In this leg, the teams travelled through the densely populated cities of Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal. Claudia and Kevin and Monique and Ladi took the ferry (MS Chi-Cheemaun) from Manitoulin Island and headed towards Toronto whilst Cathie and Tricia and Zainib and Mobeen backtracked to Espanola to take a more direct route to Ottawa with the latter team stopping in Sudbury to work in a cheese factory for bed and board and an unexpected free onward bus ticket to Ottawa.\nIn Toronto, Claudia and Kevin chose to take a sightseeing trip to Niagara Falls as Monique and Ladi fell behind due to missing the ferry off Manitoulin Island. Cathie and Tricia stopped in Ottawa to work handing out flyers for the Ottawa Fringe Festival but were forced to reschedule their shift in order to catch the evening bus to Montreal. As they and Claudia and Kevin reached Montreal, both teams discovered the 2022 Canadian Grand Prix was in town and were forced to a pay a premium for accommodation.\nWith race budgets dwindling rapidly in the cities, three teams were forced to work to earn back cash to make it to Quebec City; Kevin and Claudia worked as delivery couriers, Cathie and Tricia worked in a poutinerie in Montreal, and Monique and Ladi worked in a hairdresser's salon in Toronto. With a healthier budget and a direct train to Quebec City from Ottawa, Zainib and Mobeen overtook the other teams to secure first place. The remaining teams eventually caught the same bus from Montreal to Quebec City, culminating in a footrace through the city streets to the checkpoint.\nLeg 7: Quebec City → Liverpool, Nova Scotia.\nThe penultimate leg saw the teams journey from French-speaking Quebec City through the Maritimes provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia to the Atlantic coast and the town of Liverpool on Nova Scotia's South Shore approximately away.\nOn day 43, Zainib and Mobeen took the first bus of the day out of Quebec City to Rimouski aiming to continue onward to New Brunswick. The other teams attempted to take a later bus to Rimouski; however, Tricia and Cathie bought the last two tickets which left Monique and Ladi and Claudia and Kevin stranded in Quebec City. With few transport options out of Quebec City for the rest of the day, Monique and Ladi decided to take a taxi to Rivière-du-Loup and seek a ride from there into New Brunswick.\nDown to their last couple of hundred dollars and determined to reach the Atlantic Coast, Claudia and Kevin were greeted by a cannabis shop owner in Edmunston who provided them with breakfast, drove them down to Fredericton and paid for their hotel stay for the night. All four teams worked in New Brunswick to top up their budgets in preparation for the final leg. In Miramichi, Zainib and Mobeen worked in a motel and secured a lift for the following day so that they could raft on the Bay of Fundy tidal bore. Tricia and Cathie built a teepee in Miramichi and worked in a lobster restaurant in Shediac, whilst Monique and Ladi worked in a pizza restaurant in Saint John.\nAs three teams made it to Liverpool, Claudia and Kevin (who had increased their budget by working at a local brewery) attempted to hitchhike to Prince Edward Island to find more work. After failing to secure a ride and having spent over six hours in pouring rain, they decided to abandon the race.\nLeg 8: Liverpool, Nova Scotia → St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador.\nThe competition's final leg began on day 47 with a race from Liverpool to the last checkpoint near St. John's on the eastern tip of Newfoundland's Avalon Peninsula.\nZainib and Mobeen forfeited their lead with a decision to work in Lunenberg at a seafood restaurant whilst Tricia and Cathie and Monique and Ladi raced ahead to Halifax by taxi; the latter two teams found themselves potentially stranded for a day due to lack of onward buses. Monique and Ladi decided to stay overnight in a hostel where Zainib and Mobeen were also trying to get a room, but the hostel was fully booked. Monique and Ladi were offered their first free homestay of the race, but Zainib and Mobeen had to find a hotel. Tricia and Cathie decided not to wait and travelled to Truro in a taxi with the goal of reaching Antigonish to work in a gin distillery. Also with dwindling funds, Zainib and Mobeen decided to work in Port Hawkesbury at an off-road tours company for free bed and board, before heading on to North Sydney. Meanwhile, Monique and Ladi found time to visit the site of Africville whilst en route to Baddeck.\nAll three teams were ultimately faced with the same dilemma: whether to take the costlier ferry to Argentia or the shorter, cheaper one across the Cabot Strait to the more remote town of Port aux Basques. Tricia and Cathie, who arrived at the port on the evening of Day 49 opted for the night ferry to Port aux Basques, as it offered free overnight shelter and kept them moving ever closer towards the finish. Monique and Ladi who arrived the next morning, declined the morning Port aux Basques ferry and chose to wait for the afternoon Argentia ferry to minimise the onward journey to St. Johns; meanwhile Zainib and Mobeen also arrived at the port in time for the same Argentia ferry.\nIn St. John's, the teams received instruction that the final checkpoint was at Cape Spear, the most easterly point of the North American continent, a further away. Tricia and Cathie arrived first, on day 51 with a lead of two hours.\nCritical reception.\nOpinions on the third series were favourable overall, with Jack Seale of \"The Guardian\" awarding it the maximum of 5 stars. Lauding the choice of contestants, he stated, \"The secrets and tensions within relationships, magnified and then inevitably resolved on the journey – a process these people have chosen to undergo in a foreign country, on national television – are what make \"Race Across the World\" a top-tier reality show, and this year's cast could be the best ever.\"\nEmily Baker of the \"i\" newspaper awarded the opening episode 4 stars out of 5, initially sceptical surrounding the choice of a largely English speaking country as the setting for the entire series, she went on to admit that the lack of a language barrier in no way made the race less challenging, judging it to be \"Painstakingly slow, fiendishly strategic and with real dangers along the way (bears, mostly), this is \"Race Across the World\" in a way we've never seen it before.\"\nAnita Singh of \"The Telegraph\" also gave the show 4 stars out of 5, commenting: \"TV executives always want programmes to be about 'the journey' but in this show, the actual journey provides the real fun.\" Carol Midgley, writing in \"The Times\", gave the lowest score of any reviewer, awarding the opening episode 3 stars out of 5.\nThe Telegraph again awarded the series finale 4 stars out of 5, commenting that although the series was far from perfect, \"This BBC adventure series is still the most wholesome thing on TV.\" and commending the hospitality of Canadians. Emily Baker of the \"i\" awarded the series finale 5 stars out of 5. In a separate column she bemoaned the fact that the series was \"almost ruined\" by the use of taxis, but stated it would be a mistake to ban them from the competition."

        "title": "2009 Wales rugby union tour of North America",
        "text": "In 2009, the Wales national rugby union team toured North America to play tests against Canada and the United States. They won both matches, beating Canada 32–23 in Toronto on 30 May, before a 48–15 win over the United States in Chicago on 6 June. Wales travelled with an inexperienced touring party due to several senior players being included in the British &amp; Irish Lions' squad for their tour to South Africa. Five players earned their first Wales caps on the tour, including future captain Sam Warburton and centre Jonathan Davies.\nSquads.\nWales.\nWith head coach Warren Gatland and attack coach Rob Howley on the 2009 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to South Africa, forwards coach Robin McBryde was named as coach for Wales' tour of North America. Captain Ryan Jones was a surprise omission from the Lions squad, so he was able to continue as captain for Wales' tour. He was named to lead a 32-man squad that included 11 uncapped players, given opportunities by the selection of 13 Wales players in the Lions squad. After James Hook was called up to the Lions tour, Sonny Parker was added to the Wales touring party. Prop Eifion Lewis-Roberts dropped out of the tour due to a knee ligament injury and was replaced by Paul James, while full-back Dan Evans was called up to replace Gareth Owen, who suffered an Achilles injury. The squad was finally reduced to 26 with the dropping of Scarlets flanker Rob McCusker and Blues wing Richard Mustoe, in addition to the unavailability of Dragons players Luke Charteris, Lewis Evans, Dan Lydiate and Jason Tovey due to their involvement in a Heineken Cup play-off. Charteris rejoined the squad for the second match against the United States after Bradley Davies suffered an injury.\nCanada.\nCanada head coach Kieran Crowley named a 31-man squad for their games against Wales and Ireland, and for the Churchill Cup. The squad included uncapped forwards Chauncey O'Toole and Andrew Tiedemann, while centre Dave Spicer and former Wales under-21 lock Luke Tait.\nMatches.\nCanada v Wales.\nMcBryde named an inexperienced team for Wales' opening match against Canada; aside from scrum-half Gareth Cooper, the backs had just 10 caps between them, with debuts for Scarlets centre Jonathan Davies and full-back Dan Evans. Three more uncapped players were named on the bench in prop Craig Mitchell, flanker Sam Warburton and centre Jonathan Spratt. Early penalties from James Pritchard gave Canada a 6–0 lead inside the opening quarter of an hour, but a try from Chris Czekaj, making his first Wales appearance for almost two years, was converted by Dan Biggar to put Wales in front at the midway point of the half. After Canada lock Luke Tait was sent to the sin bin for killing the ball, Biggar then kicked three penalties before the end of the half, sandwiching another from Pritchard, to give Wales a 16–9 lead at the break. Cooper was injured in an unsuccessful try-scoring attempt just before half-time and replaced by Dwayne Peel for the second half. A try from Sean Duke, converted by Pritchard, levelled the scores early in the second half, only for Tom James to put Wales back in front with another converted try, before Biggar stretched Wales' lead with another two penalties shortly afterwards. A try by Ed Fairhurst, converted by Pritchard, narrowed the deficit to 29–23 just before the hour mark, but a penalty from Biggar put Wales nine points ahead with eight minutes to play. In the final quarter, Wales brought on Mitchell and Spratt for their first appearances, but Warburton was made to wait.\nUnited States v Wales.\nThe match against the United States was Wales' 600th test match. Despite scoring a try in the previous match, Wales wing Chris Czekaj was dropped to make room for Mark Jones, who had missed the Canada game due to injury. McBryde also replaced both half-backs, with Peel and Nicky Robinson coming in for Cooper and Biggar; in the forwards, hooker Gareth Williams replaced Richard Hibbard, while Ian Gough started in place of the injured Bradley Davies in the second row; Dragons lock Luke Charteris came onto the bench after joining the tour late, leaving Scarlets flanker Josh Turnbull and Ospreys centre Sonny Parker as the only touring players not to make an appearance in either match. For the United States, coach Eddie O'Sullivan dropped former Scarlets and Dragons fly-half Mike Hercus, and replaced him with Ata Malifa.\nNicky Robinson opened the scoring for Wales with a pair of penalties either side of the 10 minute mark, his first points for Wales in almost three years, but United States wing Gavin DeBartolo responded with one of his own a couple of minutes later. Those were to be the United States' only points of the first half, though, and Wales opened up a 27–3 half-time lead. Captain Ryan Jones went off midway through the half, having failed to recover from a head injury suffered in the opening seconds of the match, replaced by debutant Sam Warburton, but tries from Scarlets Mark Jones and Jonathan Davies (his first in international rugby) put Wales 20–3 up with 22 minutes gone. Another Wales back-rower Robin Sowden-Taylor had to be substituted before half an hour had been played, forcing Hibbard into filling in in an unfamiliar position. United States flanker Louis Stanfill was sent to the sin bin for pulling down a maul shortly afterwards, and Wales took advantage of their numerical superiority, forcing the Americans into conceding a penalty try. The United States reduced the deficit to 17 points with the first score of the second half, a try from Alipate Tuilevuka that was converted by DeBartolo, but Tom James restored Wales' lead with a try just past the midway point of the half. James suffered an injury with just over 10 minutes left to play; Cooper came on in his place and scored almost immediately before Davies scored his second try of the game, making JJ Gagiano's late try mere consolation. James and Ryan Jones were sent for scans on their injuries on their return from the tour.\nBroadcasting.\nBroadcast rights for the matches were held in Wales by the BBC and S4C. The match against Canada was shown live on BBC Two Wales with highlights on S4C, while the game against the United States was shown live on S4C with highlights on BBC Two Wales. Radio commentaries were provided by BBC Radio Wales for both matches and BBC Radio Cymru for the United States game."

        "title": "The Gang Goes Bowling",
        "text": "\"The Gang Goes Bowling\" is the seventh episode of the sixteenth season of the American sitcom television series \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\". It is the 169th overall episode of the series and was written by series creators and main actors Rob McElhenney, Charlie Day and Glenn Howerton, and directed by executive producer Megan Ganz. It originally aired on FXX on July 12, 2023.\nThe series follows \"The Gang\", a group of five misfit friends: twins Dennis and Deandra \"(Sweet) Dee\" Reynolds, their friends Charlie Kelly and Ronald \"Mac\" McDonald, and Frank Reynolds, Dennis' and Dee's legal father. The Gang runs the fictional Paddy's Pub, an unsuccessful Irish bar in South Philadelphia. In the episode, Dee joins The Waitress, Artemis and Gail the Snail in their bowling team, only to be challenged by Dennis, Charlie, Mac and Frank in a game.\nAccording to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was seen by an estimated 0.262 million household viewers and gained a 0.13 ratings share among adults aged 18–49. The episode received extremely positive reviews from critics, who praised the humor, return of characters and references.\nPlot.\nDee (Kaitlin Olson) asks Dennis (Glenn Howerton) for money, despite not working through the day. When the Gang questions her about her motives, she finally reveals that she is going out bowling with some friends of hers. After she leaves, the rest of the Gang declares they would not waste their time going bowling.\nAt the bowling alley, Dee meets with her team, which consists of The Waitress (Mary Elizabeth Ellis), Artemis (Artemis Pebdani), and Gail the Snail (Mary Lynn Rajskub). They did not want Dee on their team, but their fourth required member dropped out. Suddenly, Charlie (Charlie Day), Dennis, Mac (Rob McElhenney), and Frank (Danny DeVito) arrive, intending to fend off the girls in a girls vs boys league. They visit the alley owners, which are revealed to be Liam and Ryan McPoyle (Jimmi Simpson and Nate Mooney), who bought the place after a financial turmoil. After paying a fee, they allow them to play in the league.\nThe first round starts with the boys all achieving strikes, while the girls struggle in competing. After Dennis mocks the girls, Dee decides to employ a new strategy, which will involve manipulating the boys for their stupidity. This gets them to almost match their score in the following rounds. When Dennis mocks Dee again, The Waitress challenges him to an arcade game to prove his test of strength by punching a ball. The Waitress delivers a kick that gives her points, but Dennis' punch hits the limit of the score, earning him the win. However, the punch was strong enough to break his bones and cannot bowl on the final game against Dee. He convinces Liam to bowl for him, while Dee gets Ryan to bowl for her team. During his turn, Liam cannot see the pins due to his blurred vision and accidentally hits Ryan's hand with a ball, causing both to drop out and Dennis and Dee having to play. Dee finally overcomes her mockery and manages to strike one pin, winning. However, she notes that everyone left and The Waitress admits she is not interested in their win as she doesn't care about women's sports.\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nIn June 2023, FXX reported that the seventh episode of the sixteenth season would be titled \"The Gang Goes Bowling\", and was to be directed by executive producer Megan Ganz, and written by series creators and main actors Rob McElhenney, Charlie Day and Glenn Howerton. This was Ganz's fourth directing credit, McElhenney's 58th writing credit, Day's 64th writing credit, and Howerton's 46th writing credit.\nCasting.\nThe episode featured the return of many characters, including Liam and Ryan McPoyle, last seen in the ninth season episode \"The Gang Squashes Their Beefs\". Artemis and The Waitress previously appeared in the fifteenth season, while Gail the Snail in the thirteenth season episode \"The Gang Beats Boggs: Ladies Reboot\".\nFilming.\nThe episode started filming in February 2023, with confirmation of the guest stars in the episode. Due to its bowling setting, the episode contained many references to the film \"The Big Lebowski\".\nReception.\nViewers.\nIn its original American broadcast, \"The Gang Goes Bowling\" was seen by an estimated 0.262 million household viewers and gained a 0.13 ratings share among adults aged 18–49, according to Nielsen Media Research. This means that 0.13 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode. This was a 12% increase in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 0.232 million viewers with a 0.09 in the 18-49 demographics.\nCritical reviews.\n\"The Gang Goes Bowling\" received extremely positive reviews from critics. Ray Flook of \"Bleeding Cool\" gave the episode a 9 out of 10 rating and wrote, \"Not many shows would be looking to further embrace their canon after five seasons, let alone 16 seasons. But \"Always Sunny\" is showing the confidence that comes from being the best sitcom running to give some amazing folks some additional screen time. And that made for an episode that pull punches when it came to the humor, yet still left us feeling like… well, like we were home. A very fucked-up, dysfunctional, probably-could-use-therapy home... but a home nonetheless.\"\nJerrica Tisdale of \"Telltale TV\" gave the episode a 4 star rating out of 5 rating and wrote, \"'The Gang Goes Bowling' is a good \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\" episode that showcases Dennis and Dee in a protagonist and antagonist way that is fun and brings back some familiar faces that we haven’t seen in a while. It could become a future \"Sunny\" classic.\" Danielle Ryan of \"/Film\" wrote, \"The episode is a battle of the sexes, pitting the girls' bowling team against the boys', and it gives all of the wacky side characters a chance to go wild. With so many of the best of \"Always Sunny\" appearing in the episode, it doesn't really matter who wins the bowling match because we all win.\""

        "text": "The Water Polo Federation of Ukraine ( (FVPU), \"Ukrainian Water Polo Federation of Ukraine\") is an all-Ukrainian public organization whose goal is to develop water polo in Ukraine. The Federation organizes official water polo competitions and is an affiliated member of FINA and LEN – the International Swimming Federation and the European Swimming Federation. It cooperates with the National Olympic Committee, as well as other Ukrainian and international sports organizations. The activities of the Federation is guided by the Charter, the new version of which was approved on March 13, 2020. \nThe Water Polo Federation of Ukraine was officially registered by the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine on July 8, 2005.\nSince June 17, 2021, the president of the Federation has been Oleksandr Yuriyovych Svishchov, president of the water polo club Dynamo (Lviv). Oleksandr Kucherenko, who headed the Federation since 2000, was elected honorary president of the organization.\nHistory.\nWater polo, as an independent sport, has been developing in Ukraine for more than 100 years. It is believed that Kharkov was the first center for the development of water polo in Ukraine - it is said that already in 1908, Kharkov athletes took part in all-Russian competitions, but there is no documentary evidence of this. \nOn July 26, 1914, in Lviv, on Pelchinsky Ponds, water polo competitions were held with the participation of athletes from the Lviv sports club \"Погонь\" - an article about this match was published in the newspaper \"Курьер Львовский\" on July 27, 1914. However, the further development of water polo in Lviv was delayed due to the outbreak of the First World War.\nDuring the period between World War I and World War II, in the Ukrainian SSR, the development of water polo resumed in Kharkov. One proponent of the sport was the teacher Ivan Viktorovich Vrzhesnevsky, who became the rector of this institute after the end of the war. In the last pre-war championship of the Soviet Union, Kharkov water polo players won in the 2nd group. At the same time, 34 water polo teams participated in the championship of Kiev. After 1938, the Kiev club \"Vodnik\" participated in the championships of the USSR.\nIn the post-war years, the main centers for the development of water polo in Ukraine were Kiev, Kharkov, Lvov, Sevastopol and Uzhhorod. In particular, teams were restored in Kiev (Nauka, Vodnik, Dynamo, Spartak, Bolshevik, SKIF), in Lvov (Dynamo, Spartak), and in Kharkov (Dynamo). Since 1945, teams from Kyiv and Lvov have taken part in the USSR championships. In the 1970s, Kiev's \"Dynamo\" team won the silver and bronze medals of the championship of the USSR several times. In 1974 and 1975, Ukrainian teams won bronze medals of the USSR Championship - silver in 1976 and bronze in 1977. The greatest success during this period was the victory of Dynamo Kyiv in the USSR Cup in 1980. Dynamo Lviv in 1989 and 1991 won bronze medals in the USSR championship, and was also twice a finalist in the USSR Cup.\nIn 1991, Ukrainian clubs interrupted their performances in the last USSR championship, held in Kyiv. In the spring of 1992, a short transitional championship of Ukraine took place with the participation of seven teams: Kyiv and Lviv Dynamo, Lokomotiv Kharkiv, Azov-Mariupol, Polygraphist Lvov, the team of the Black Sea Fleet of Sevastopol. In the autumn of 1992, the II Championship of Ukraine began, which was held according to the autumn-spring system. Also in 1992, the championships of Ukraine among women, youths of all ages and cup competitions started. At the same time, the Water Polo Federation of Ukraine was created, which until 2005 operated without legal registration.\nOn November 28, 2021, the Ukrainian national team became the winner of the League of Nations international tournament held in the Czech Republic for the first time in the team's history."

He played college basketball for the Central Connecticut Blue Devils and was the Northeast Conference Player of the Year in 2004. Robinson played professionally in Europe.\nEarly life.\nRobinson was raised in the Bronx, New York. His parents were both murdered in separate shooting incidents in the Bronx: his father, Ron Sr., when Robinson was aged eight and his mother, Desiree Randall, when he was aged ten. Robinson moved in with his grandmother, Emma Harris, who lived in Brooklyn but she lost her apartment and they resorted to living in homeless shelters throughout New York City. Harris died less than three years later and Robinson returned to Bronx to live with his aunt. Robinson spent three years with his aunt before she died of a chronic lung condition and he was taken in by a friend.\nRobinson attended seven elementary schools and four high schools. After struggling at Truman High School, he transferred to Bronx Regional High School where he became an all-city player.

He developed a jump shot and offensive moves throughout his first three seasons. Robinson was selected to the Northeast Conference all-rookie team in 2001. The Blue Devils made the 2002 NCAA Division I basketball tournament with a leadership group of Robinson, Damian Battles, Ricardo Scott and Corsley Edwards.\nRobinson was announced as the Blue Devils' captain before the 2002–03 season.

The Skating Dutchmen represented Union College and were coached by Art Lawrence in his 4th season.\nSeason.\nUnion took longer than most teams to return to the ice after World War II and reappeared just in time for the introduction of the NCAA tournament. The green team wasn't expected to win many of their games as they had to contend with a lack of consistent ice as the local rink was a temporary facility that was entirely at the mercy of local weather conditions. However, even with the inexperience and poor ice the team could hardly produce a worse season. Union was shutout in 6 of their games and lost by double digits on as many occasions.\nThere were some bright spots, particularly in the defensive play of Phil Brady, but that wasn't enough to help the team compete in many games. The situation with the rink got so bat at one point that the third period of the match with Champlain had to be divided into two 10-minute sessions so that both team had the ability to push the puck down a hill. While A.D. J. H. Wittner assured the team that the field upon which the rink was erected had been levelled off the previous spring, there was a definite tilt to the surface. The Dutchmen did show improve as the year went on and their final game was perhaps their best on the year. Despite losing to Champlain once more, the defense was stout all night long while the offense consistently attacked the opposing cage.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Silver Anniversary Hamilton Tournament\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

The Ephs represented Williams College and were coached by A. Barr Snively in his 14th season.\nSeason.\nWilliams came into the season sporting a roster full of underclassmen. Much of the team was made up of sophomores and, which they did have some experience, many were still untested in the starting role. The weather got cold enough for the rink to form in mid-December and the team began training with gusto. Coach Snively tried to cram as much practice time in as possible before the winter break as the team would be travelling to Buffalo to take on three of the nation's top teams. Unfortunately, the Ephs weren't able to pull off an upset and were defeated in all three games. There were some outstanding performances in those losses as goaltender Dave Pynchon did well against a withering attack while the physical play from Don Radcliffe elicited cheers from the several-thousand-strong crowds. While the start to their season was inauspicious, Williams was able to turn the adversity to their advantage and use the experience to post stellar results for the rest of the season.\nThe team had a 10-day layoff before their next game and were able to iron out the deficiencies in their game. Entering the game against Hamilton, their opponents were coming off dominating performances and were expected to swamp the still winless Ephs. Instead, Williams swept the Continentals off of their home rink with six different players scoring. The strong play continued with an overpowering performance against Massachusetts. Goals continued to come from all quarters and even bit players were able to get their name on the scoresheet.\nUnfortunately, the Ephs couldn't sustain that level of play and, after a tie with Middlebury, the team lost 4 games in a row. Williams recovered at the end of the season, first by deadlocking a strong Army squad but then by taking down Princeton on the road.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

The Cadets represented Norwich University and were coached by Gerard Derosier in his 1st season.\nSeason.\nNorwich entered the season with an ambitious 12-game schedule and a new head coach to lead the team. Boston University grad, Gerard Derosier took over the club and was looking to provide a bit of permanence for a program that had been playing off and on for the past 40 years. The biggest trouble early on was getting ice time as the Cadets still were relying on an outdoor rink. Fortunately, the weather consented to allowing the surface on Sabine Field to freeze in time for the opening match with Vermont. However, A lack of practice time led to the Cadets getting shutout despite inspired play from team captain Sterling Melendy.\nThe team was able to get in a significant amount of practice time over the next three weeks as they played just 2 more games in January. While Norwich lost both matched, the team was trending upwards and were finally able to get into the win column in the rematch with Vermont. The team took control of the game early and stayed ahead, eventually building a 7–2 lead. Vermont had a furious attempt to tie the game late but the Cadets were able to hold off their opponents for the victory.\nAfter a second win, the team travelled south for a swing through Boston. The trip could have hardly started worse with a 6–18 defeat to Northeastern. While the two subsequent games were much closer, Norwich lost both matches and had no chance of making the conference postseason. Despite the futility of their situation, the team rallied once they got back home and reeled off four straight wins to bright themselves up to an even record. Though they were still well out of the NEIHL playoffs, the Cadets had a chance at a winning record if they could take down Colgate. The Red Raiders were one of the top teams that season but that didn't deter Norwich. The Cadets found themselves down 5–2 early in the third period before attempting to stage a comeback. Norwich scored three goals in the third, unfortunately the Red Raiders were able to slip one more past Switzer to escape with a win.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;"

A total of 32 teams competed in the group stage to decide the 16 places in the knockout phase of the 2023–24 UEFA Champions League.\nUnion Berlin and Antwerp made their debut appearance in the group stage. This was the Belgian club's first appearance in the European Cup since their first round exit in the 1957–58 season, and the first ever for the German side. A total of 15 national associations were represented in the group stage.\nThis was the final season with the group stage format, which was replaced by the league stage format starting from the next season.\nDraw.\nThe draw for the group stage was held on 31 August 2023, 18:00 CEST, in Monaco. The 32 teams were drawn into eight groups of four. For the draw, the teams were seeded into four pots, each of eight teams, based on the following principles:\nTeams from the same association could not be drawn into the same group. Prior to the draw, UEFA formed pairings of teams from the same association (one pairing for associations with two or three teams, two pairings for associations with four or five teams) based on television audiences, where one team would be drawn into Groups A–D and another team would be drawn into Groups E–H, so that the two teams would play on different days. The following pairings were announced by UEFA after the group stage teams were confirmed:\nOn each matchday, one set of four groups played their matches on Tuesday, while the other set of four groups played their matches on Wednesday, with the two sets of groups alternating between each matchday. The fixtures were decided after the draw, using a computer draw not shown to public. Each team did not play more than two home matches or two away matches in a row, and played one home match and one away match on the first and last matchdays (Regulations Article 16.02).\nTeams.\nBelow were the participating teams (with their 2023 UEFA club coefficients), grouped by their seeding pot. They included:\nNotes\nFormat.\nIn each group, teams played against each other home-and-away in a round-robin format. The top two teams of each group advanced to the round of 16. The third-placed teams were transferred to the Europa League knockout round play-offs, while the fourth-placed teams were eliminated from European competitions for the season.\nTiebreakers.\nTeams were ranked according to points (3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, 0 points for a loss). If two or more teams were tied on points, the following tiebreaking criteria were applied, in the order given, to determine the rankings (see Article 17 Equality of points – group stage, Regulations of the UEFA Champions League):\nGroups.\nThe fixtures were announced on 2 September 2023, two days after the draw. The matches were played on 19–20 September, 3–4 October, 24–25 October, 7–8 November, 28–29 November and 12–13 December 2023. The scheduled kick-off times were 18:45 (two matches on each day) and 21:00 (remaining six matches) CET or CEST.\nTimes are CET or CEST, as listed by UEFA (local times, if different, are in parentheses).\nGroup A.\n \nGroup B.\n "

        "text": "The Bangladesh cricket team toured England in May 2023 to play three One Day International (ODI) matches against the Ireland cricket team. The ODI matches formed part of the inaugural 2020–2023 ICC Cricket World Cup Super League.\nIn March 2023, Cricket Ireland (CI) confirmed that all three ODIs would be played at Chelmsford in England. This was due to better weather in England than in Ireland, leading to a better chance of full matches being played to a result.\nGoing into the series, Ireland needed to win all three matches to claim the eighth and final automatic place in the 2023 Cricket World Cup at the expense of South Africa. South Africa's qualification for the World Cup was confirmed when the first ODI ended with no result due to rain. The result meant that Ireland had to go through the 2023 Cricket World Cup Qualifier to qualify for the 2023 Cricket World Cup. \nThe first ODI ended in a no result due to rain. Bangladesh won the series 2–0.\nBackground.\nThe Bangladesh team were scheduled to tour Ireland and England in May 2020 to play three ODIs and four Twenty20 International (T20I) matches, with the T20I matches scheduled to take place in England. It would have been the first time that Ireland hosted a series at a neutral venue.\nOriginally, the tour was scheduled to include a one-off Test match and three T20I matches. However, the Test match was cancelled, with another T20I match added to the tour itinerary. Cricket Ireland made the decision based on the lack of context for the one-off match, and the costs associated of hosting it. A planned home T20I series against Afghanistan was also cancelled by Cricket Ireland. Cricket Ireland confirmed the fixtures for ODI series in December 2019. In December 2019, Cricket Ireland looked at the possibility of hosting the T20I matches in England. In February 2020, the T20Is were confirmed to be taking place in England, along with the dates for the four matches. The venues in England were confirmed the following month. However, on 21 March 2020, the matches were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn November 2021, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) announced that they would play the three ODI matches in Ireland in May 2022, with the aim to play the T20I matches at some point during 2023. In March 2022, as a result of the impact from the pandemic, the International Cricket Council (ICC) agreed to extend the cut-off date for the Cricket World Cup Super League from March 2023 to May 2023, allowing this series to take place.\nTour match.\nAhead of the series, Bangladesh were scheduled to play a 50-over warm up match against the Ireland Wolves side, with the match being played behind closed doors. However, the match was abandoned due to rain. "

        "text": "The Pakistan cricket team toured the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in March 2023 to play three Twenty20 International (T20I) matches against the Afghanistan cricket team. This was the first bilateral series in any format of international cricket between the two teams.\nIn November 2022, the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) signed a five-year agreement with the Emirates Cricket Board (ECB) to play their home matches in the UAE. On 7 March 2023, the ACB confirmed the dates for the tour, with the matches scheduled to be played on 25, 27 and 29 March 2023. However, two days later, changes were made to the schedule due to the availability of the Hawk-Eye technology.\nAfghanistan won the first T20I by 6 wickets. It was Afghanistan's first win in international cricket against Pakistan. They also went on to win the second T20I by 7 wickets and took an unassailable lead in the series. It was Afghanistan's first bilateral series win over Pakistan, and their first bilateral T20I series victory against any of the top six teams. Pakistan won the third T20I by 66 runs.\nBackground.\nOriginally, Afghanistan were scheduled to play three ODI matches each against Australia and Pakistan, with the series being part of 2020–2023 ICC Cricket World Cup Super League. On 12 January 2023, Cricket Australia (CA) withdrew from ODI series against Afghanistan on the grounds of restrictions on women and girls' education and employment in Afghanistan. Australia forfeited the series and the 30 competition points were awarded to Afghanistan.\nThis series was originally scheduled to take place in 2021 but was postponed following the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan. On 23 January 2023, Both ACB and Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) agreed to play three T20Is instead of ODIs as both were already qualified for the 2023 Cricket World Cup.\nSquads.\nFor the series, Pakistan decided to rest their regular captain Babar Azam, Shaheen Afridi, Haris Rauf, Mohammad Rizwan, and Fakhar Zaman, with Shadab Khan being named as captain.\nFollowing an erroneous announcement appointing Pakistan's batting coach Mohammad Yousuf as their new interim head coach, Yousuf opted out of the tour citing personal reasons."

Although the NCAA selection committee does not use the PWR as presented by USCHO, the PWR has been accurate in predicting which teams will make the tournament field.\nFor Division III men, all teams are included in comparisons starting in the 2013–14 season (formerly, only teams with a Ratings Percentage Index of .500 or above, or teams under consideration, were included). The PWR method compares each team with every other such team, with the winner of each “comparison” earning one PWR point. After all comparisons are made, the points are totaled up and rankings listed accordingly.\nWith 84 Division III men's teams, the greatest number of PWR points any team could earn is 83, winning the comparison with every other team. Meanwhile, a team that lost all of its comparisons would have no PWR points.\nTeams are then ranked by PWR point total, with ties broken by the teams’ RPI ratings, which starting in 2013–14 is weighted for home and road games and includes a quality wins bonus (QWB) for beating teams in the top 20 of the RPI (it also is weighted for home and road).\nWhen it comes to comparing teams, the PWR uses three criteria which are combined to make a comparison: RPI, record against common opponents and head-to-head competition. Starting in 2013–14, the comparison of record against teams under consideration was dropped because all teams are now under comparison."

        "text": "Hiawatha Golf Course is a golf course adjacent to Lake Hiawatha in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The golf course was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2023 for its association with the African American community. The Minneapolis Park Board developed five golf courses in the first three decades of the 20th century, since golf was a relatively new sport at the time and interest was peaking. Black residents in Minneapolis were concentrated in a few neighborhoods, including Southside, so Hiawatha Golf Course became an important social and recreational center for that neighborhood.\nHistory.\nLake Hiawatha was once known as Rice Lake. In 1922, the Minneapolis Park Board purchased of land that had been a dairy farm. The park board had previously developed courses at Theodore Wirth Park (known as Glenwood Park at the time) in 1916, Columbia Park in 1919, and Gross Golf Course in 1925, all in the northern part of the city. Land on the south side of the city was getting hard to come by, so the park board bought in Hopkins in 1925 and built Southwest Golf Course, later renamed Meadowbrook. The Rice Lake marsh was dredged to a depth of 33 feet, and the dredged soil was placed on the west side, to form the rolling landscape where the golf course was built. The golf clubhouse, designed by the firm of Stravs, Door, Bersbeck, and Chapin was constructed in 1932, and the golf course, designed by William B. Clark, was opened in July, 1934 (first 9 holes only, the full 18-hole course opened the next summer). It was quickly heavily used by Minneapolis residents. The dredged soil tended to compact and sink, requiring repairs to the early course, and a 1939 work relief project added shore retaining walls to prevent erosion, since the dredged shoreline was especially susceptible to erosion from waves.\nThe course was frequently used by metro-area African-American golfers, including several famous local figures like Solomon Hughes Sr. and Jimmy Slemmons. During the 1930s, many African-American residents lived in an area between 34th Street on the north, 46th Street on the south, Nicollet Avenue on the west, and Chicago Avenue on the east. Because of restrictive covenants and redlining, the Southside was one of the few places where African-Americans could live, along with the Northside in North Minneapolis and the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood. Hiawatha Golf Course was popular with Black members of the community because of its proximity to the Southside. As in the other courses in Minneapolis, a private club was organized as an affiliate of the public course. The Hiawatha Golf Club opened in 1936, and prospective members were accepted only by a unanimous vote of the board with no provision for an appeal, so the club only had white members for decades. Black golfers founded their own association, the Twin City Golf Club, and met at Black community centers such as the Hallie Q. Brown Community Center and the Sterling Club.\nPresent state.\nFollowing a 2014 flood that caused extensive damage to the course, and the subsequent discovery of unpermitted groundwater pumping, the park board embarked on the development of a new master plan for the site. The planning process resulted in a recommendation to reduce the course from 18 holes to 9 holes, enhance the learning facilities for golf, use a greatly expanded wetland space to manage flooding and treat pollution, and introduce several new park amenities like boat rentals and concessions. The plan was met with resistance by golfers who wished to retain 18 holes. After several failed votes and years of debate, the plan passed on a 6–3 vote in September 2022."

        "title": "Gravity (basketball)",
        "text": "In basketball, the term gravity is used when describing situations in which players without the ball draw defenders to them, simply as a result of their shooting ability being a known threat. This in turn helps their teammates access more open shot opportunities themselves. As the offensive player is deemed a threat by the defending team, the defense collapses in on the player, hence the player is described as having \"gravity\" on offense.\nUse and history of term.\nPopularized in the mid-2010s, the term is commonly used when describing a player's off-ball shooting ability. The term gained popularity as Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors began to develop into an MVP-caliber player, helping establish the Warriors as an NBA dynasty. Curry has since become a commonly cited example of a player who exhibits a great amount of on-court gravity. Fellow NBA player CJ McCollum suggested that Curry cannot be guarded with just one person, stating \"He's a galaxy, he's a planet, he's a solar system. Everything revolves around him.\"\nContext and determinants.\nWhile on offense, each player has gravity at varying levels. In addition, the ball itself has gravity as there is \"the need to pressure the ball-handler and keep him from getting a wide-open shot.\" Similarly, the basket also has gravity, \"since the highest-percentage shots tend to be taken from close range.\" \nA player with high shooting ability has a high amount of gravity when off the ball. Gravity is contextual to a player's role within their team's offensive gameplan, as well as their on-court location. ESPN writer Kevin Pelton elaborated on this, writing \"A put-back specialist with limited range has almost no gravity when he plays on the perimeter, but high gravity inside the paint because of the threat he poses on the offensive glass.\""

        "text": "The 1947–48 St. Lawrence Saints men's ice hockey season was the 11th season of play for the program but 1st under NCAA oversight. The Saints represented St. Lawrence University and were coached by Paul Patten in his 1st season.\nSeason.\nWhile the program made its return following World War II the year before, the school took the club seriously by bringing in Paul Patten to take over as coach from team captain Jack Klemens. This was necessary not only to help the club to move forward but also because Klemens was absent early in the year. The defensive stalwart was attending the training camp of the United States men's national ice hockey team in the hope of appearing at the upcoming Winter Olympics. While Klemens was away, another defensive player came to the fore when Gene DelVeccio, the team goaltender made a name for himself in the exhibition season.\nAfter returning from the winter break, with Klemens back in a Saints uniform, the Larries opened against Westchester of the Amateur Hockey League and posted a solid victory. The next game was a prestige match against Princeton and the relatively inexperienced Saints managed to overcome one of the top teams in the nation. As if to demonstrate that the outcome wasn't a fluke, St. Lawrence then trounced Paul Smith's College 15–0, though it was only the second year of existence for the opposing college.\nSt. Lawrence fell from the ranks of the unbeaten in the next game but the team had put itself in a hole early by getting down 0–3 to Colgate early. They followed a similar pattern versus Clarkson and lost by an identical score. Needing to arrest their slide, the Saints got the jump on Williams at the end of the month shot into the lead. They never relinquished their advantage and managed to build a 5–1 edge in the third before two late goals made the score closer than the game was. The Larries followed that game with a tight defensive battle against Army with Klemens spotting the team a lead early in the first. Unfortunately, the Saints were unable to add to their lead and, despite DelVeccio's efforts, could not keep the Cadets from tying the game late. An interference call in overtime gave Army a penalty shot and they were able to capitalize and send St. Lawrence packing.\nThe ire at how that game ended boiled over into the next match which saw SLU hammer Union 17–0. Tom Gerard paced the team with 5 goals and 4 assists, tying two programs records that still stand as of 2023. The Larries continued their high-scoring pace in a tie with Cornwall and then avenged their earlier loss to Clarkson, hanging a 7–5 win over the Knights after being down 2–5 with just 15 minutes left in the match. Unfortunately, there was a bit of melancholy amidst the wins. Because Jack Klemens graduated after the fall session, he was no longer on the team and the Saints would have to soldier on without their top defender.\nDoing his best to take over the leadership role, Gerard had another outstanding game against the Clinton Hockey Club. In what was a wild affair, both he and Ed Garbers scored 4 goals apiece while Gerard added 3 assists. The team's hot streak ended with a loss to Cornwall when they surrendered 4 goals in the final frame. After a rematch with Colgate was cancelled on an account of warm weather, S. Lawrence finished out their season with a win over Hamilton as the team got contributions from up and down the lineup.\nThe team was able to post the first winning season in program history despite not having a home rink. The Saints were forced to play on the road for most of the year and, aside from the temporary skating rink used during the Winter Carnival, they had to play any 'home' games at the Clarkson Arena.\nHal Schulley served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "text": "The 1947–48 Princeton Tigers men's ice hockey season was the 46th season of play for the program but first under the oversight of the NCAA. The Tigers represented Princeton University and were coached by Richard Vaughan in his 11th season.\nSeason.\nAfter a terrible end to the previous season, the Tigers were looking to get a good jump on the year. The first game against Brown, who were returning to the ice after a 9-year layoff, was a relatively soft landing for the Tigers who won the game as much on their depth as anything else. After inserting Robert O'Conner into the starting role for team captain Charlie Callanan, coach Vaughan got the Tigers to perform much better in their second game.\nOver the winter break, Princeton travelled up to Buffalo to participate in a 4-team winter carnival. With Callanan back in goal, the Tigers won the first two games with solid performances on both sides of the puck. This left them with an impeccable 5–0 record as they entered the showdown with the defending eastern champions, Dartmouth. With a potential NCAA tournament berth up for grabs, the Tigers wanted to at least give the Indians a fight, however, the Greens demonstrated why they were one of the best teams in the country by taking complete control of the game. While Princeton didn't look out of place on the same ice as Dartmouth, the Hanoverians were obviously the better of the two.\nOn their way back to campus, the team made a pitstop in Canton to take on St. Lawrence. Unfortunately, the team got into penalty trouble in the first and surrendered 2 power play goals which the Larries rode to a 3–6 win. The Tigers hoped that they could flip the script a week later when they met Dartmouth for a rematch but the second edition was eerily similar to the first. Despite a strong defensive performance by O'Conner and Schmon, the Indians potted 6 goals in Princeton's first league game since 1942. The team collected itself and ended their losing streak with an overtime win over Clarkson thanks to a goal from Walt Elsaesser.\nAfter righting the ship, Princeton played just one game over the next two and a half weeks. They met the US Olympic Team in that aggregation's first game together. The Tigers took advantage of the lack of familiarity by scoring 5 goals in the first and riding that to an easy 6–2 victory.\nPrinceton didn't play another game until the end of the month and, when they did, had lost both Bob Schmon and Paul Van Dyke to academic ineligibility. The team looked completely out of sorts in the match against Boston University and produced their worst performance all season, losing 1–8. Without those two lynchpins in the lineup, the Tigers lost the other two games before the start of the Spring semester, dropping their record to 7–6.\nRefusing to bow to the difficulties, the Tigers fought back in the next game and upset tournament-hopeful Boston College. Princeton continued its inspired play and won matches against both Harvard and Yale. With Bill Clarkson taking over from Van Dyke as the team's #1 center, both he and Freddie Roberts recorded hat-tricks to give the Tigers a pair of conference wins.\nThe three wins gave Princeton an outside chance at the NCAA tournament but they would have to continue the strong play over the remaining five game. Unfortunately, the entire offense fell apart down the stretch. In the final 5 contests, Princeton scored just 9 goals and lost every game. The Tigers had been 2nd in the Pentagonal League at the time but ended up tied for last with Yale and had yet another disappointing finish to their season.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The 2023 NCAA Division I men's basketball championship game was the final game of the 2023 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. It determined the national champion for the 2022–23 NCAA Division I men's basketball season and was contested by the San Diego State Aztecs from the Mountain West Conference and the Connecticut (UConn) Huskies from the Big East Conference. The game was played on April 3, 2023, at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas. In the game, UConn defeated San Diego State 76–59 to win their fifth national championship in five appearances. Adama Sanogo of UConn was named Most Outstanding Player (MOP) of the Final Four. Despite losing, San Diego State became the first team from the Mountain West conference to reach the semifinals or the final.\nParticipants.\nThe game was the second all-time meeting between UConn and San Diego State; the first game was on March 24, 2011 at the Honda Center in Anaheim, California, which UConn won by seven points.\nSan Diego State Aztecs.\nThe Aztecs, representing San Diego State University in San Diego, California, were coached by Brian Dutcher in his sixth season. They were ranked No. 19 in the preseason AP Poll, and won their first three games of the season before heading to Hawaii for the Maui Invitational Tournament. There, they defeated Ohio State before losing to No. 14 Arizona and No. 9 Arkansas. They lost only one further non-conference game, a neutral-site contest against Saint Mary's, and entered conference play with nine wins and three losses (9–3). Games against New Mexico, Nevada, and Boise State were their only losses in conference play; the Aztecs finished the Mountain West Conference slate with a 24–6 overall record and a 15–3 conference record, good for the regular season conference championship and the No. 1 seed in the Mountain West tournament. In the conference tournament, they defeated Colorado State, San Jose State, and Utah State to claim the conference tournament championship, their third in six seasons under Dutcher.\nSan Diego State received the Mountain West's automatic invitation to the NCAA tournament by virtue of their conference tournament title and were seeded fifth in the South Regional. Their first and second round games were played at the Amway Center in Orlando, Florida; they faced No. 12 seed Charleston in their first game, resulting in an eight-point Aztec win. The other first round game played in Orlando saw No. 13 seed Furman upset No. 4 seed Virginia, setting up a second-round Saturday matchup between San Diego State and Furman. This win sent them to the regional semifinal round for the third time; they faced No. 1 overall seed Alabama. The Aztecs upset Alabama after coming back from a 9-point deficit in the second half, and advanced to the Elite Eight for the first time; in doing so, they also became the first Mountain West Conference team to reach that round of the tournament. They advanced to the Final Four with a one-point win over No. 6 seed Creighton, and defeated No. 9 seed Florida Atlantic by one point on a last-second buzzer beater to advance to the national championship game. The Aztecs attempted to become the first mid-major program to win an NCAA Division I men’s basketball championship since UNLV in 1990.\nConnecticut Huskies.\nThe Huskies, representing the University of Connecticut in Storrs, Connecticut, were coached by Dan Hurley in his fifth season. They were unranked to begin the season but entered the AP Poll at No. 25 after winning their first two games. At the Phil Knight Invitational in Portland, they defeated Oregon, No. 18 Alabama, and Iowa State. They finished their non-conference schedule with an 11–0 record and won their first three Big East Conference games before suffering their first loss at No. 22 Xavier. This started a skid for the Huskies in which they lost four of their next five games—their only ranked opponent during this streak was No. 25 Marquette—their lone win in this stretch was against Creighton. They defeated No. 10 Marquette later in the conference season, though dropped their next game at No. 23 Creighton. Ultimately, the Huskies finished the conference schedule with an overall record of 24–7, and conference record of 13–7, earning them the No. 4 seed in the Big East tournament. They defeated Providence, but bowed out of the tournament with a semifinal loss to Marquette the following day.\nUConn received an at-large invitation to the NCAA tournament, and were placed in the West Regional as the No. 4 seed. Their first and second round games were played at MVP Arena in Albany, New York, shortly after making it to the semifinal round of the Big East conference tournament, traditionally held at New York City's Madison Square Garden, meaning that the Huskies stayed within New York State in the earlier part of March; their opening game was against No. 13 seed Iona, whom they defeated by 24 points. No. 5 seed Saint Mary's defeated No. 12 VCU in the other first round game held in Albany, and the Huskies defeated Saint Mary's by 15 points in the second round, to advance to the regional semifinal. UConn defeated No. 8 seed Arkansas by 23 points in their third NCAA tournament game, and in the regional final, they defeated No. 3 seed Gonzaga by 28 points. They faced No. 5 seed Miami in the Final Four, and \"cruised\" to a 13-point win over the Hurricanes, to qualify for the national title game. This was the fifth NCAA championship game appearance for the Huskies, who had won all four prior games (1999, 2004, 2011, and 2014).\nGame summary.\nUConn won the game's opening tip and scored the game's first points with a field goal by Jordan Hawkins. San Diego State took their first lead on a three-point field goal by Lamont Butler; Darrion Trammell followed with a three-point shot of his own, putting the Aztecs ahead by four points. The teams traded jump shots for the next two minutes, and San Diego State led 10–8 at the first media timeout with 15:47 remaining in the first half. Adama Sanogo tied the game at ten points apiece with a jumper just over a minute later, and he made a layup after several possessions to return the lead to UConn. Following the latter basket, the game went two and a half minutes without any scoring; a dunk by Donovan Clingan with 11:28 was the next made shot and increased UConn's lead to four points. Three straight made field goals by Naheim Alleyne and Hawkins extended the Huskies' lead to ten points, and a three-pointer by Hawkins two minutes later made the score 26–14. After a Trammell jump shot brought San Diego State within nine points, but three straight field goals by Tristen Newton (the last of which was a three-pointer) pushed UConn's lead to sixteen points. Butler scored a three-point shot of his own immediately afterwards to push the Aztecs over the 20-point margin, and UConn led 36–20 at the time of the media timeout with 2:55 until halftime. The 16-point margin was two more than San Diego State's deficit in their last game against Florida Atlantic. The game went without scoring for nearly two minutes after resuming; Keshad Johnson ended this drought with a jump shot for San Diego State. Trammell's two-point shot with 36 seconds remaining were the final points of the first half, after UConn's final possession resulted in missed shots by Newton and Sanogo and a rebound by Mensah with no time remaining.\nUConn began the second half with possession of the ball, though they did not score on their opening possession; Matt Bradley's jump shot marked the second half's opening score, though Sanogo's layup immediately afterwards ended San Diego State's run of six consecutive points. A pair of free throws by Trammell brought UConn's lead back down to ten points; Alex Karaban's three-point shot twenty seconds later made the score 41–28. Both teams traded a pair of free throws near sixteen minutes to play, and Adam Seiko made a three-pointer to once again return UConn's lead to ten points. The Aztecs went for nearly three minutes after that without scoring; in that period, Sanogo and Newton each made two free throws for the Huskies. Jaedon LeDee scored on either side of a media timeout with 11:56 remaining to narrow their deficit to 13 points, and a layup by Clingan was countered by a Butler three-point shot under thirty seconds later. The Huskies were able to extend their lead further after Joey Calcaterra made a three-point shot, though San Diego State responded with nine consecutive points from LeDee, Johnson, and Trammell. UConn put a stop to the run after Sanogo made a tip shot, bringing the score to 58–50 with 7:15 remaining in the contest. Both teams made several free throws over the next few minutes, and the Aztecs narrowed the deficit to 60–55. However, a three-pointer by Hawkins with five minutes remaining bumped UConn's lead to eight, and started a 9–0 Huskies run. UConn led 63–55 at the media timeout with 3:52 left. After the timeout, UConn scored six consecutive points—a run ended by a jump shot by Trammell—before Hawkins scored another layup and put his team back in the lead by 14 points. The teams traded free throws with under 90 seconds to play, and several further San Diego State fouls gave UConn more free throws; Hawkins made two and Jackson Jr. made one. After a missed jumper by San Diego State, UConn rebounded and was able to run out the clock and secure a 76–59 national championship victory.\nUConn won its fifth championship in 25 years and remained unbeaten (5–0) in national title games. Sanogo was named Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four, and he capped his tournament performance with a 17 point, 10 rebound game in the championship, good for a double-double. Newton also finished with a double-double for the Huskies, scoring 19 points and securing 10 rebounds. Hawkins also scored 16. San Diego State was led by Johnson's 14 points. They shot just 32.2% from the field, and missed 14 consecutive shots in the first half, going 11 minutes without making a shot. The Aztecs were -point underdogs, the largest in a national championship game in the 2000s. The Huskies won all six of their tournament games by double-figures, achieved by only four other teams since the tournament's current format began in 1985. \nHawkins and Angel Reese became the first cousins to win championships on consecutive days, as Reese had led LSU to its first-ever women's basketball championship one day before.\nMedia coverage.\nThe championship game was televised in the United States by CBS. Jim Nantz provided play-by-play, while Bill Raftery and Grant Hill both provided color commentary. Tracy Wolfson served as the sideline reporter. Former college basketball referee Gene Steratore provided rules analysis throughout the game. This was the final national championship game that Nantz would call for CBS Sports, as he retired from calling live games in the NCAA Tournament following this game; coincidentally, this game took place close to the campus of the University of Houston, where Nantz originally got started in broadcasting. Ian Eagle replaced Nantz the following season."

The top four finishers participate in the single elimination tournament, which is held at the home field of the top seed. The winner of the tournament receives an automatic berth to the NCAA Division I Women's Lacrosse Championship. \nThe tournament began in 2022, the season after the conference added women's lacrosse as a sponsored sport. Through the 2023 tournament, Central Michigan has won both tournament titles.\nHistory.\nThe Mid-American Conference announced in late 2019 that women's lacrosse would be added as a sponsored sport for the 2021 season. At that time of the announcement, only two full members of the conference had women's lacrosse teams, with Central Michigan starting play in 2016 and Kent State in 2019. Akron had started scrimmaging in September 2019 and began formal competition the following February, while Eastern Michigan had announced plans in November 2019 to have a team by 2022. As part of the MAC's announcement, two affiliate members were also introduced: Detroit Mercy and Youngstown State, both full members of the Horizon League. Later, in June 2020, the conference announced that Robert Morris, who was also in the process of becoming a full member of the Horizon League, would join as an affiliate for the inaugural 2021 season, for a total of six teams. Eastern Michigan began formal competition in 2023 to bring the total to seven.\nInitial plans called for the tournament to begin in 2021, but in May 2020, the conference announced that the women's lacrosse tournament, along with seven other conference tournaments, would be eliminated for at least four years as a result of the financial implications of the COVID-19 pandemic. The following May, however, the conference reversed the decision, restoring the tournaments for all eight sports effective for the 2021–22 season. Robert Morris won the inaugural regular-season title, but no tournament was held, so the Colonials won the automatic bid to the 2021 NCAA Division I Women's Lacrosse Championship. The first tournament was held in 2022, with Central Michigan, Robert Morris, Kent State, and Youngstown State qualifying. The tournament was hosted and won by regular-season champion Central Michigan.\nChampions.\nBy year.\nThe following is a list of tournament champions, runners up, and sites listed by year.\nBy school.\nThe following is a list of tournament champions listed by school, the years each team was eligible to play in the tournament, and their overall record in tournament play."

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Jaspers represent Manhattan College in the NCAA's Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference.\nManhattan began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1904. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Manhattan's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2021–22 season."

        "title": "Kentucky Derby Festival Basketball Classic",
        "text": "The Kentucky Derby Festival Basketball Classic was an annual American all-star game featuring high school basketball players. Started in 1973, it was part of the Kentucky Derby Festival in Louisville, Kentucky, leading up to the Kentucky Derby horse race. The Classic was sponsored by the local McDonald's restaurants of Kentuckiana for over 20 years from its inception until 1996. It was played at Freedom Hall, except for one year at the KFC Yum! Center in 2011. The Classic was canceled in 2018 due to declining attendance and financial losses. It had been the country's longest-running high school all-star basketball game. Star players who participated included Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Penny Hardaway, Moses Malone, Jamal Mashburn, Donovan Mitchell, Victor Oladipo, Isiah Thomas, and Dominique Wilkins.\nHistory.\nThe Derby Classic began in 1973 after Max Rein, who worked in the local radio industry, presented the idea to Jack Guthrie, who was the CEO of Kentucky Derby Festival Inc. Primarily focused on horse racing at the time, the festival added many new events that year and billed itself as a \"people festival\", offering something for everyone. Basketball was popular in the region. \"The two most important things to these people are their church and their high school basketball team,\" said Rein. The Classic showcased players who had signed with the local college programs of the Kentucky Wildcats, Louisville Cardinals, and Indiana Hoosiers. The game was preceded by a skills event, the Night of Future Stars, which began in 1988.\nThe Classic began with one squad of five top players each from the states of Indiana and Kentucky against 10 of the best from the rest of the country. In 1981, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) restricted incoming high school players to all-star games whose participants were from a two-state area around the game site. However, as games had already been planned, waivers were granted to the Derby Classic and the three other national all-star games—the Capital Classic, McDonald's All-American Game and Roundball Classic. The NCAA also limited players to playing in two all-star games. That year, the Derby Classic had only one player from Indiana, as most of the state's top players opted to attend a two-game Indiana–Kentucky series held in June.\nThe following year in 1982, the NCAA voted to again permit national all-star games. However, all of Indiana's top players and most of Kentucky's passed over the Derby Classic that year to attend the Indiana–Kentucky series. About 6,000 fans turned up for the Classic, compared to its then-high of 17,528 from 1976. After having won the first two games in 1973 and 1974, the Kentucky-Indiana squad lost its 10th straight game to the U.S. All-Stars. The Classic was canceled in 1983 before returning the following year. It was aided by an NCAA rule change allowing players to participate in two all-star games in their senior year and two after graduating, removing contention between the Derby Classic and the Indiana–Kentucky series. The Classic also changed its format to two national teams divided between the North and South. The game's highest attendance was 19,041 in 1987 at Freedom Hall; that contest featured Kentucky signee LeRon Ellis, ranked among the top 20 prospects in the nation. In the 1990s, the Classic stopped getting Indiana's signees, who opted instead to play in all-star games organized by Tim Knight, the son of Indiana's then-coach, Bobby Knight.\nAfter its sponsorship with McDonald's ended, the Classic partnered with Nike, which was a successful relationship until Nike made its Jordan Brand games its priority, first with the Jordan Brand Capital Classic and later the Jordan Brand Classic. The Derby Classic was then sponsored by Adidas. The game was canceled in 2018 due to falling attendance, fighting to reach 5,000 fans, and growing financial losses. Competing all-star games were drawing the top talent, including the McDonald's All-American Game, Jordan Brand Classic, and Nike Hoop Summit. Another contributing factor that year was a college basketball investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation that drained Louisville's recruiting class."

        "title": "2001 UST Growling Tigers basketball team",
        "text": "The 2001 UST Growling Tigers men's basketball team represented University of Santo Tomas in the 64th season of the University Athletic Association of the Philippines. The men's basketball tournament for the school year 2001–02 began on July 14, 2001, and the host school for the season was Far Eastern University.\nThe Growling Tigers failed to make it to the semifinals for the first time since the Final Four format was implemented in 1994. They ended the double round-robin eliminations at sixth place with a 6–8 record.\nThe team suffered their worst start since the 1989 season, when they went 1–4 in their first five games. They went through a three-game losing streak after recovering from an opening day loss against the FEU Tamaraws.\nThey had an average winning margin of 7.5 points and an average losing margin of 6.5 points.\nRoster changes.\nThe Growling Tigers lost their big men in Marvin Ortiguerra, Gilbert Lao, and Kenneth Co Yu Kang, as well as the high-leaping Cyrus Baguio. Ortiguerra applied for the PBA draft and was selected by the Sta. Lucia Realtors in January 2001, while Co Yu Kang was left off the roster due to academic deficiencies. The rest were excluded by their veteran head coach Aric del Rosario from the team due to their continuous absences from team practices. The players' commitments to their Philippine Basketball League clubs prevented them from participating in the Tigers' preseason games.\nSchedule and results.\nUAAP games.\nBeginning in 2001, games were played with four 10-minute quarters and a 24-second shot clock. In the past, games were played with two 20-minute halves and a 30-second shot clock.\nElimination games were played in a double round-robin format and all of UST's games were televised on Studio 23.\nSummary.\nThe Tigers were tabbed as underdogs this season after the departures of key players led by Marvin Ortiguerra and Cyrus Baguio. With the 6-foot-5-inch Alwyn Espiritu as the only remaining veteran big man in the roster, the team was expected to struggle at the post. Missing from this year's lineup, aside from Ortiguerra were centers Gilbert Lao and Kenneth Co Yu Kang, and forward Mel Latoreno.\nHead coach Aric del Rosario had planned to break in tall rookies Warren de Guzman and Marc Nanninga, who were playing the forward and center positions, respectively, to aid Espiritu in rebounds and to make the job of their wing players easier. Picking up the void left by Baguio were three-point specialist Derick Hubalde, the high-leaping Niño Gelig, as well as Jake Agleron and team captain Emmerson Oreta.\nFirst round.\nThe Tigers sent the Adamson Falcons to their 22nd straight loss after withstanding a gallant stand by the Falcons with a 66–54 win. Hubalde, Oreta, Gelig, and Agleron all finished in double figures with 18, 15, 13, and 11 points, respectively.\nShooting a low 39 percent two-point field goal conversion, UST compensated on their outside sniping, with 33 of their total 66 points coming from beyond the arc. They made 11 out of 26 three-point shots for a 42 field goal percentage.\nUST suffered a 14-point 73–87 defeat at the hands of the De La Salle Green Archers. After a close-scoring first quarter, the Tigers fell behind by more than twenty points as they could not contain the Archers' Renren Ritualo and rookie Mark Cardona's scoring. They were able to pull within nine at 66–75 in the last 3:28, but Ritualo regained his shooting form by converting two of his total five three-pointers to tow his team to victory.\nThe Tigers have not won against the Archers since their Game 1 victory in their 1999 Finals series.\nThe Tigers' outside shooting was well-scouted when the UE Red Warriors applied a zone defense on them, resulting to chief gunner Derick Hubalde's 0 for 6 shooting. Team captain Emmerson Oreta likewise was heavily defended as he finished the game with a 3 out of 11 field goal output, and none from the three-point area. The two were tallying a near 30-point combined average in their previous games. The whole team has held the highest three-point field goal average at 42 percent, but could only manage 5 out of 22 attempts against the Warriors.\nBackup big man Iago Raterta took the scoring cudgels as he finished with a double-double of 14 points and 12 rebounds. Point guard Dondon Villamin added 10 points, while rookie Warren de Guzman bagged a career-high of 16 rebounds.\nThe Tigers who trailed the Warriors throughout the game, came closest at 4:36 in the fourth quarter when they cut down the lead by four at 55–59. In the end, UE prevailed in beating UST, 67–57.\nThe Growling Tigers ended up in an upset loss against the NU Bulldogs when they went scoreless in the last four minutes of the game. UST was leading at 79–73 when the Bulldogs tightened their defense and limited the Tigers to a single free throw and caused them to commit five turnovers. The game ended with NU winning, 83–80. Gelig topscored for UST with 22 points, as Hubalde and Raterta added in 12 and 11 points, respectively.\nUST ended their three-game losing streak when they defeated the UP Fighting Maroons, 71–65. Oreta made back-to-back three-pointers to pull his team to five at 66–61 after trailing 60–61 in the last 1:20.\nSecond round.\nOreta once again made back-to-back baskets in the game's final seconds as the Growling Tigers ended Ateneo's seven-game winning streak with their second-round 62–55 win. UST's record improved to 4–5, reviving their chances for a Final Four qualification.\nThe NU Bulldogs repeated their conquest of the Tigers with a 72–69 win as the Bulldogs came back from a 16-point deficit midway in the third quarter. Behind steady baskets from Oreta and Agleron, UST erected their biggest lead over the Bulldogs at 52–36, after Dondon Villamin's basket at 4:18 of the third period. It was then that NU began a 16–2 run to bring down the Tigers' lead to three at 55–52. The Bulldogs finally got the lead at 71–69 after Chico Manabat drove for a layup. A costly error by UST's Alwyn Espiritu in the last 43 seconds sent NU's Jeff Napa to the foul line. Napa split his charities to seal the win for the Bulldogs.\nThe Growling Tigers rallied from an 11-point deficit in the third quarter to escape with a two-point 58–56 win over the UP Fighting Maroons in their second-round matchup. UST went on a 19–2 run at 6:36 in the third period behind Hubalde's three successive baskets to take the lead at 50–44 going into the final ten minutes of the game. Both teams went dry in offense in the next seven minutes, with the Tigers managing to score only six points, and the Maroons with a seven-point output as UST still held on to a 56–51 lead. UP came within two points at 56–58 after Mike Bravo's layup with 10.9 seconds remaining, but teammate Mark Jomalesa missed his half-court heave as time ran out. Hubalde led the Tigers with 15 points, while Oreta and Christian Luanzon added 12 and 11 points respectively.\nDerick Hubalde failed to tow his team to an extra period against the De La Salle Green Archers when his last-second shot attempt rimmed out of the basket. The Tigers tried to surmount a 14-point La Salle lead at the start of the fourth period, bringing the score to 59–all in the last 2:14 as Luanzon made one of his two free throws off a foul by Mike Cortez. The final minutes of the game were decided by a foul throw contest between the two squads, as UST trailed by two to three points on each stoppage. Oreta was able to pull his team to within one at 62–63 after a putback from Hubalde's miss in the last 7.3 seconds, but a split freethrow by La Salle's Cortez, and a missed jump shot by Hubalde off Luanzon's pass in the final 3.8 seconds sealed the 64–62 win for the Archers. Gelig and Oreta led the Tigers in scoring with 17 and 12 points.\nThe Tigers failed to advance to the semifinals for the first time since the Final Four format took effect in 1994. UST, who lost, 63–67 in overtime to the FEU Tamaraws fell behind the NU Bulldogs and the UE Red Warriors in the standings and ended up tied with the UP Fighting Maroons at sixth place.\nUST was leading by five at 53–48 midway in the fourth quarter, but a 10–3 run behind the Tamaraws' Cesar Catli and Miko Roldan at 2:26 saw their lead vanish before Alwyn Espiritu scored to equalize at 58–all with 1:24 left in regulation. The quarter ended at 61–all, but the Tigers could not keep up with the Tamaraws in scoring as they could only convert two points in the extra period. FEU, on the other hand, made the most out of their free throws as UST kept fouling in the final two minutes to delay the game clock. Espiritu topscored for the Tigers with 17 points, while Gelig and Luanzon added 12 and 10 points.\nThe Growling Tigers prevented UE from an outright entry to the semifinals when they won 76–72. UST had been eliminated from the Final Four for the first time since its implementation, while UE ended up tied at fourth place and would still need to win a knockout game for the #4 Final Four seeding.\nThe Tigers controlled the tempo throughout the game, with the Warriors managing to tie the score only twice, the last at the 8:34 mark in the final period when UE's Paolo Hubalde took an awkward shot for a 58–all score. Hubalde's brother Derick topscored for UST with 14 points, as three other Tigers scored in double figures. They also outrebounded their opponents 44–27.\nPlayers drafted into the PBA.\nEmmerson Oreta applied for the 2005 PBA draft, but was not picked by any team. The Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters signed him as a free agent in 2009 after suiting up for the Smart-Pampanga Buddies in the 2009 Smart Liga Pilipinas Conference during the PBA's off-season."

        "text": "Matthew Brown (born August 9, 1999) is an American collegiate ice hockey left winger at Boston University. He was an All-American for BU in 2023.\nPlaying career.\nBorn in Wood-Ridge, New Jersey, Brown played junior hockey in and around his home town of Tenafly, graduating from Tenafly High School in 2017. Afterwards, he travelled west and joined the Dubuque Fighting Saints but lased just 6 scoreless games before changing leagues and finishing out the year with the Odessa Jackalopes. For his final season of juniors, Brown gave the USHL one more try and saw much greater success with the Des Moines Buccaneers. He led the club in scoring and was a point per game player, helping the team reach the second round of the playoffs.\nThe following fall, Brown began attending the University of Massachusetts Lowell and led the team in scoring as a freshman. While his overall total was unremarkable, Brown helped to put the club in position for a potential NCAA tournament berth. Lowell finished the 3rd in the Hockey East standings that season and were preparing for their postseason run, however, before any games could be played the remainder of the campaign was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. Brown returned for the abbreviated Covid season in 2021 but neither he nor the River Hawks were quite up to the standards set before the pandemic.\nThat summer, Brown decided to use the new NCAA transfer rules and switched to Boston University. Hopes were high for Brown but he got off to a slow start and then sat out for over a month and didn't return until after Thanksgiving. His scoring increased afterwards and he appeared to be rounding into form, however, his life changed on January 30 when his mother, Debbie, died at the age of 51. Brown was able to collect himself long enough to score the deciding goal in the Beanpot semifinal against Harvard.\nAfter a summer to come to term with the new reality, Brown was also had to contend with a 3rd head coach in 4 years as BU brought in Jay Pandolfo as the new bench boss. The new system, as well as the arrival of freshman phenom Lane Hutson, helped Brown raise his profile and post career numbers across the board. He nearly doubled his totals in all three categories and finished in the top-10 in the nation. While also helping BU win both the regular season and conference tournament titles, Brown was named to the All-American second team and assisted on the overtime winner in the Hockey East championship. Brown helped BU reach the Frozen Four for the first time in 8 years but could not stop the team from losing to the #1 overall seed."

Exeter Chiefs are the reigning champions.\nCompetition format.\nThe original plan for the competition involved dividing the 24 teams from the top two tiers of English rugby into four pools of six. The number of teams dropped to 22 following the suspension of Wasps and London Irish.\nThe 22 teams were split into four pools, two of 6 teams (Pool A &amp; Pool B) and two of 5 teams (Pool C &amp; Pool D). The teams were seeded based on league standings at the end of the 2022–23 season. Teams in Pools C and D also played one cross-pool fixture along with their own pool games.\nPools.\nTeams played every other team in their pool once, either home or away. Teams in pools C and D also played one cross-pool fixture along with their own pool games.\nKnockout stage.\nThe semi-finals were confirmed on 17 October after points from the two cancelled Jersey Reds fixtures were allocated.\nBroadcasting.\nOne game from each round will be broadcast on TNT Sports as well as both the semifinals and the final."

The 2023 NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans are honorary lists that include All-American selections from the Associated Press (AP), the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA), \"Sporting News\" (SN), and the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) for the 2022–23 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. All selectors choose three teams, while AP and USBWA also list honorable mention selections.\nThe Consensus 2023 College Basketball All-American team was determined by aggregating the results of the four major All-American teams as determined by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Since United Press International was replaced by SN in 1997, the four major selectors have been the aforementioned ones. AP has been a selector since 1948, NABC since 1957 and USBWA since 1960. To earn \"consensus\" status, a player must win honors based on a point system computed from the four different all-America teams. The point system consists of three points for first team, two points for second team and one point for third team. No honorable mention or fourth team or lower are used in the computation. The top five totals plus ties are first team and the next five plus ties are second team.\nIndividual All-America teams.\nBy team.\nAP Honorable Mention:\nUSBWA Honorable Mention:\nAcademic All-Americans.\nCollege Sports Communicators (known before the 2022–23 school year as the College Sports Information Directors of America) announced its 15-member 2023 Academic All-America team on March 14, 2023, divided into first, second and third teams, with Ben Vander Plas of Virginia repeating as men's college basketball Academic All-American of the Year."

Hobart defeated defending champion Adrian 3–2 in overtime to win the program's first national championship.\nQualifying teams.\nBefore the season, the NCAA amended its bylaws, lowering the requirement for conferences to receive automatic qualifiers from seven conference members to six. This meant that the WIAC champion would now be guaranteed a spot in the tournament field.\nTwelve teams qualified for the tournament in the following ways: (Pool A) nine teams received bids as a result of being conference tournament champions from conferences that possessed an automatic bid, (Pool C) three additional teams received at-large bids based upon their records.\nFormat.\nThe tournament featured four rounds of play. All rounds were single-game elimination.\nThe top four rated teams received byes into the quarterfinal round and were arranged so that if they were to advance to the semifinals, the first seed would play the fourth seed and the second seed would play the third seed. Because there were three western teams and only one received a bye into the quarterfinals, all three were placed into the same bracket. Of the nine eastern teams, the six that did not receive byes were arranged so that the fourth eastern seed played the ninth eastern seed with the winner advancing to play the third eastern seed; the fifth eastern seed played the eighth eastern seed with the winner advancing to play the second eastern seed; and the sixth eastern seed played the seventh eastern seed with the winner advancing to play the first eastern seed. The higher-seeded team played host in all first round and quarterfinal matches."

He was an All-American at the University of Denver and helped their ice hockey program win a national championship in 2022.\nPlaying career.\nThe Burnaby native was a standout player in juniors, averaging at or near two points per game for his U-18 clubs before joining the Penticton Vees in 2017. While his production was lower, the competition was also much tougher. Despite dealing with multiple injuries in his second year, his scoring exploits made him attractive enough as a prospect for the Carolina Hurricanes to select Rizzo near the end of the 2019 NHL Entry Draft. The following year, Rizzo was a member of the Coquitlam Express and helped the club finish atop the league standings. Once they got into the postseason, Rizzo led the team in scoring by the end of the first round series, however, the COVID-19 pandemic forced the cancellation of the remainder of the playoffs. Rizzo sat out the entire season and prepared himself for the start of his collegiate career.\nRizzo debuted for the University of Denver in 2021 and joined a team that had narrowly missed the NCAA tournament the year before. He combined with several other freshmen to provide an instant boost for the Pioneers and propelled the team to a first-place finish in the National Collegiate Hockey Conference (NCHC). Denver stumbled a bit in the conference tournament but went on a run in the NCAA bracket. Rizzo scored the team's third goal in the title game and helped Denver win their ninth championship in program history. The following year, Rizzo led the team in scoring, helping them once again win a league crown. While he was named as an All-American, he could not get the team to repeat as champions and the Pioneers were knocked out in the first round.\nOn August 9, 2023 Rizzo's rights were traded along with a 2025 fifth-round pick to the Philadelphia Flyers from the Carolina Hurricanes in exchange for the rights to David Kase. On April 17, 2024, Rizzo was signed to a two-year, entry-level contract by the Flyers."

        "title": "2023 NCAA Beach Volleyball Championship",
        "text": "The 2023 NCAA Beach Volleyball Championship (officially the 2023 National Collegiate Beach Volleyball Championship) was an intercollegiate tournament to determine the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) women's beach volleyball national champion for the 202223 season. The seventh edition of the tournament was held from May 3 to 7, 2023, at Gulf Place Public Beach in Gulf Shores, Alabama. The 2023 championship featured a single-elimination-only bracket for the first time, along with an expanded 17-team field. Nine of the participating schools automatically qualified by winning their respective conference tournaments, while the other eight were given at-large bids by the NCAA Women's Beach Volleyball Committee. The tournament was broadcast on ESPN, ESPN2, and ESPNU.\nBackground.\nThe National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) began sponsoring women's beach volleyball as a championship sport in 2016, and the sport has since experienced rapid growth at the collegiate level, with a 500 percent increase in women's collegiate beach volleyball programs in the United States from 2011 to 2020. The NCAA Beach Volleyball Championship is the tournament held at the end of every regular season to determine the women's national collegiate champion across all NCAA divisions. It has been held annually since the inaugural 2016 event, and 2023 marked its seventh edition. The 2023 tournament was held in Gulf Shores, Alabama, the same venue that hosted all six previous championships, and was co-hosted by Gulf Shores Orange Beach Sports &amp; Events, the city of Gulf Shores and the University of Alabama at Birmingham.\nPopularized on the beaches of California in the 1920s, beach volleyball is a sport played by two teams on a sand court. At the professional level, teams consist of a pair of players who compete in best-of-three-set matches, where the first two sets are played to 21 points and the third set, if necessary, is played to 15 points; each set must be won by a minimum two-point lead. Conversely, NCAA beach volleyball is played using a flighted team-dual format. In an NCAA dual, each team fields five individual pairs who are ranked from 1 to No. 5 by skill level, and each pair plays a flighted best-of-three-set match against their corresponding pair on the other team. The first team to win three of the five pairs' matches wins the dual.\nThe NCAA Beach Volleyball Championship had historically been an eight-team double-elimination tournament, in which all participating teams were selected by the NCAA Women's Beach Volleyball Committee. However, with the growing popularity of the collegiate sport, the NCAA agreed to double the field for the 2022 championship, adding a 16-team opening knockout round that led into the established eight-team double-elimination bracket. Along with the expanded field, the qualification process introduced eight automatic bids that teams earned by winning their respective conference tournaments. Further changes were adopted for 2023, with the tournament becoming a single-elimination-only event, and the field expanded to 17 teams to allow for nine automatic qualifiers.\nFormat and venue.\nThe 2023 NCAA Beach Volleyball Championship was a 17-team tournament that was held from May 3 to 7, 2023. The tournament began on Wednesday, May 3, with a play-in dual between the two lowest seeded teams. The 16-team single-elimination main bracket began on Friday, May 5, with the winning teams advancing to the quarterfinals and semifinals on Saturday, May 6, until a national champion was determined on Sunday, May 7.\nThe tournament took place on one site at the Gulf Place Public Beach in Gulf Shores, which had been set up with five playing courts and five practice courts. Over the years, the playing conditions at the Gulf Shores venue have been characterized by several factors; namely the compact sand that makes it easier for players to move and jump, the strong winds, and the possibility of rain during that time of the year.\nParticipating teams.\nOf the 93 eligible NCAA teams, a total of 17 qualified for the tournament and were seeded from No. 1 to No. 17. Nine of the teams earned automatic bids by winning their respective conference tournaments. The remaining eight bids were allocated at large by the NCAA Women's Beach Volleyball Committee. The qualifying teams and seeding order were announced by the committee on April 30, 2023.\nAutomatic bids.\nThe following nine teams earned automatic bids by winning their conference tournaments.\nAt-large bids.\nThe following eight teams were allocated at-large bids by the NCAA selection committee.\nPreview.\nFrom its inception in 2016 to 2022, only two teams had won the NCAA Beach Volleyball Championship: the USC Trojans (four titles and two-time defending champion: 2016, 2017, 2021 and 2022) and the UCLA Bruins (two titles: 2018 and 2019). Both teams were in the running for the title once again in 2023. UCLA entered the NCAA tournament seeded No. 1 and topping the American Volleyball Coaches Association's (AVCA) rankings. \"Volleyball Magazine\" Travis Mewhirter regarded the Bruins as the preseason favorites, writing that they had \"the most loaded lineup in the country, top to bottom\". Headed by Stein Metzger for the eleventh year, their senior-heavy roster featured nine returning starters from the team that took third-place at the previous NCAA championship, including 2022 AVCA first-team All-Americans Lexy Denaburg and Abby Van Winkle. The Bruins recorded 23 dual sweep victories in the regular season, and were coming off their third Pac-12 title despite being upset by Stanford earlier in the double-elimination tournament. In contrast to UCLA, Mewhirter considered USC somewhat of a preseason \"underdog\" due to the fact that they had lost all but four of last year's championship-winning lineup, and thus had a less experienced squad that relied on new graduate transfer players and freshmen. Among their returning players were the former U19 world champions Megan Kraft and Delaynie Maple. Led by Dain Blanton for the fourth year, the Trojans were ranked third in the country and received the No. 3 seed. They headed to the championship having failed to make it to the Pac-12 final for the first time in program history after losses to California and UCLA.\nSeeded No. 2 and No. 4 respectively, the TCU Horned Frogs and Florida State Seminoles were looking to end the USCUCLA dominance. Under coach Hector Gutierrez, TCU entered the NCAA tournament ranked second in the country, but had also been ranked as high as first for six weeks earlier in the season. Their roster featured new players such as Kate Privett, a proven transfer from Florida State, and Anhelina Khmil, the 2021 U21 world champion from Ukraine. \"Volleyball Magazine\" Larry Hamel observed that while the Horned Frogs' lineup had a lot of depth, they were especially strong at the top flight with their returning AVCA first-team All-American Spanish pair of Daniela Alvarez and Tania Moreno, who had finished fourth at the 2022 European Championships. The 202223 season saw TCU defeat six-time defending conference champion Florida State en route to their first-ever Coastal Collegiate Sports Association (CCSA) title. Meanwhile, the fourth-ranked Seminoles had been the national runners-up in 2016, 2018 and 2022. Coach Brooke Niles' program featured seven returning starters from the previous year, including 2022 AVCA first-team All-American Maddie Anderson who had medalled on the Beach Pro Tour during the offseason. Despite losing five of their last ten duals, \"Volleyball Magazine\" still regarded Florida State as a strong contender for the NCAA title.\nJulie Cribbs, chairperson of the NCAA Women's Beach Volleyball Committee, believed that moving the tournament from a double-elimination to single-elimination format could help disrupt the dominance of the sport's perennial powerhouses. With the top-four ranked teams all heading into the championship having suffered recent upsets, \"Volleyball Magazine\" Lee Feinswog noted the new format \"gave the top teams reason to pause and the next group reason to hope\".\nBracket.\nThe tournament bracket is as follows:\nDual summaries.\nPlay-in.\nThe competition began with the play-in dual between the No. 16 seed UT Martin and the No. 17 seed A&amp;M–Corpus Christi, in what was the first-ever matchup between the two teams. The dual was played in staggered flights, with the No. 2 and No. 4 pairs playing their matches first, followed by the No. 1, No. 3, and No. 5 pairs playing theirs to decision. A&amp;M–Corpus Christi won the first two pairs matches in straight sets, giving them a 20 dual lead. In the next round of matches, they were up a set on all three courts before their No. 3 pairing of Jade Bennett and Tori Johnson clinched the dual with a dominant 219, 2110 match win, giving the program its first-ever dual victory at the championship.\nBroadcast and attendance.\nThe first round duals on May 5, 2023, were broadcast live on ESPNU; the quarterfinal and semifinal duals, as well as the rescheduled HawaiiLoyola Marymount first round dual, on May 6 were broadcast live on ESPN2; the championship dual on May 7 was broadcast live on ESPN. Additionally, all individual matches were livestreamed on ESPN+.\nThe ESPN broadcast of the UCLAUSC championship dual was watched by 380,000 viewers, while the ESPN2 broadcasts of the Florida StateUCLA and TCUUSC semifinals were watched by 107,000 and 117,000 viewers respectively. Of the ESPN2 quarterfinal broadcasts, the most-watched duals were StanfordTCU (145,000 viewers) and Florida StateLSU (131,000 viewers). According to ESPN, viewership of the tournament as a whole increased 100% from the previous year. The tournament was also attended by a live audience of 11,667."

        "text": "The 1930–31 Villanova Wildcats men's ice hockey season was the 2nd season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nAfter a winless though not embarrassing inaugural season, Villanova came into the year with an ambitious schedule. Despite scheduling just a few games at the Philadelphia Ice Palace, the Wildcats would attempt to play upwards of a dozen games during their second year. Several players from the previous season were returning, including leading scorer \"Eskimo\" Kennedy, and the team was helmed by the football team's assistant coach, Ed Hunsinger. To support the young program, 15 full uniforms were available for the players who made the squad from an initial group of 36 candidates.\nThe Wildcats started the year with a bang, defeating the Williamsport Amateur Club for the program's first win. In the next game, Villanova faced a tough challenge with a professional outfit, Atlantic City Sea Gulls. Nova held firm in the first period, holding the pros to a single goal while Faughnan netted one for the blue and white. After that strong start, however, the defense collapsed and allowed 14 goals in the final 2 periods. There were 2,000 fans in attendance but most were locals cheering for the birds. Villanova had a long layoff before the next match when they resumed their rivalry with the Penn Athletic Club. Unfortunately, the Pennacs continued their winning streak and edged out the Wildcats by a single goal.\nThe week afterward was supposed to be an especially busy one for the program as they had scheduled 4 games over 7 days, however, due to weather two of those matches were cancelled while a third was rescheduled to a later date. Instead, the team was only able to ply the junior varsity team from Yale and, despite playing the B team, was still unable to get a victory. They kept even with the J.V. squad through two periods but faltered in the last 20 minutes. With their plans disrupted by the weather, Villanova agreed to participate in the opening game at the Hershey Ice Palace on February 18. They held their old rival Penn A. C. to an even score in regulation and necessitated overtime Nova got the first goal, however, because sudden-death rules did not apply to the first two overtime periods, the Pennacs were able to tie the game in the second 5-minute period and require a third overtime. A goal by their arch-nemesis ended the Wildcats' hoped of finally getting over the hump.\nA couple of weeks later, Villanova was getting ready to wind down its season with a match against Princeton's J. V. squad. The Wildcats had their best game of the season with Kennedy leading the way. The winger scored 5 goals in the game, setting a program record. Unfortunately, the team could not keep the momentum and were swamped by Swarthmore in the following match. The next contest was the postponed rematch with the Sea Gulls, however, because of scheduling conflicts, the game had to be played in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The pros were just as impressive the second time around and easily downed the Wildcats. While the gave at Atlantic City was supposed to be the season finale, the team managed to shoehorn in one final game against the Lancaster Athletic Club and get their third win of the season.\nBob Rothert and Charlie Lynch served as team managers.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The 2027 FIFA Women's World Cup bidding process is the process used by FIFA to select the host for the 2027 FIFA Women's World Cup. There are currently two live bids.\nHost selection.\nOn 23 March 2023 FIFA launched the bidding process for the 2027 FIFA Women's World Cup.\nThe key dates include:\nActive Bids.\nFIFA received three bids to host the tournament upon their 8 December 2023 submission deadline: a joint bid from the German, Royal Belgian, and Royal Dutch Football Associations, a sole bid from the Brazilian Football Confederation, and a joint bid from the Mexican and United States Soccer Federations. The Mexico–United States bid was withdrawn prior to the appointment of host(s) on 17 May 2024.\nBelgium–Germany–Netherlands.\nOn 19 October 2020, the football associations of Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands announced their intention to jointly bid for the 2027 FIFA Women's World Cup. The intention is for the three countries to make further agreements about the organization before the end of this year and to record this in a covenant. Belgium and the Netherlands jointly hosted the UEFA European Championship in 2000, with Belgium having previously hosted in 1972. Germany hosted the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2011 and the UEFA European Women's Championship in 2001. Germany also hosted the FIFA Men's World Cup in 1974 and 2006, the men's Euro in 1988, and will do so again in 2024. Germany and the Netherlands co-hosted several matches in the multi-national UEFA Euro 2020. The Netherlands hosted the Women's Euro in 2017. The host cities of Germany are Dortmund, Gelsenkirchen, Düsseldorf and Cologne, all in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The Dutch host cities are Amsterdam, Eindhoven, Enschede, Heerenveen and Rotterdam. The Belgian host cities are Genk, Anderlecht, Gent and Charleroi.\nBrazil.\nThe Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF), along with Rio de Janeiro city, have expressed interest in participating in the election for the 2027 World Cup. The country was already one of the finalists for the 2023 edition, but had to withdraw its candidacy due to the lack of support from the federal government, in addition to the financial crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The project is part of a study carried out by the Rio Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau (RCV), which also makes possible other events with Olympic sports and FIFA tournaments in Rio de Janeiro until 2033, including the 2031 Pan American Games, using the city again as host (since it hosted the competition in 2007), reusing the structures used in the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics. The country has twice hosted the men's version of the World Cup, in 1950 and 2014, in addition to the 2013 Confederations Cup.\nOn 1 March 2023, the city of São Paulo expressed interest in participating in the election with Rio de Janeiro, offering the Arena Corinthians and Allianz Parque to receive the matches. The next day, CBF President Ednaldo Rodrigues sent a letter to FIFA, confirming the country's intention to compete in the 2027 World Cup. Other Brazilian cities can also participate in the project, as the event involves the entire country. On 7 March the Brazilian Minister of Sports, Ana Moser, confirmed the country's bid to host the tournament. Then, the cities of Salvador, Brasília, Cuiabá, Belém, Manaus and Fortaleza also offered to host the World Cup in an event on SAFs and the football capital market, organized by the Getúlio Vargas Foundation (FGV) on 11 March. Among the capitals that offered, only Belém did not host the last men's World Cup in the country in 2014, losing its place to Manaus. \nOn 28 September 2023, the CBF confirmed the cities of Belo Horizonte, Brasília, Cuiabá, Fortaleza, Manaus, Porto Alegre, Recife, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Salvador as the capitals that will make up the official Brazilian candidacy document, with Belém leaving the project and the inclusion of the capital of Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul, increasing the number of candidates for the World Cup to ten. The locations are similar to those of the 2014 men's edition, but without the inclusion of Curitiba and Natal in future matches. The plan also foresees the opening match at the Estádio Nacional Mané Garrincha and the closing match at Maracanã, while in the cities of Belo Horizonte, Porto Alegre and São Paulo, there was an uncertainty between two stadiums. In the capital of Minas Gerais, the dispute would be between Mineirão and Arena MRV, while in the capital of Rio Grande do Sul the dispute is between Estádio Beira-Rio and Arena do Grêmio and in the Brazilian megalopolis the dispute is between Neo Química Arena and Allianz Parque , with Mineirão, Beira Rio and Neo Química Arena being the favorite stadiums for having hosted the men's version games in 2014. A successful bid would be South America's first time hosting the Women's World Cup.\nWithdrawn Bids.\nMexico–United States.\nU.S. Soccer presidents Carlos Cordeiro and Cindy Parlow Cone made hosting the FIFA Women's World Cup a priority during their respective administrations, focusing on potential bids for the 2027 and 2031 editions. Concurrently, the Mexican Football Federation (FMF) expressed an interest in hosting the 2027 edition. The two federations allied, announcing in April 2023 their intention to submit a join bid to host the 2027 edition. \nTaking place after the men's World Cup in Canada, Mexico, and the United States in 2026, they planned to host the tournament across sixteen venues: ten of the United States' eleven 2026 stadiums sans SoFi Stadium, which was replaced by the Rose Bowl, and all three of Mexico's 2026 stadiums in addition to the Estadio Corregidora and Estadio León. While the FMF and U.S. Soccer were one of three parties to submit a bid for the tournament, projecting revenues exceeding US$3 billion, they withdrew in April 2024, just weeks before the host selection, refocusing their efforts on a bid to host the 2031 edition instead.\nOther interest in bidding.\nChile.\nAfter the successful participation at the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup in France, then-sports minister Pauline Kantor, announced the intention to propose a bid for 2027 edition. To enhance the bid, Chile officially made its women's domestic league fully professional after 2022–23 season, with the first professional season played in 2023. Chile have hosted numerous FIFA tournaments, including: 1962 FIFA World Cup, 1987 FIFA World Youth Championship, 2008 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup and the 2015 FIFA U-17 World Cup.\nItaly.\nOn 17 February 2021, President of the Italian Football Federation, Gabriele Gravina, hinted that Italy might seek to host the 2027 Women's World Cup, and has underlined a prolonged plan to improve the status of women's football in Italy, including the professionalisation of the Serie A from autumn 2022 and finally making Italian female footballers full time professionals.\nNordic bid.\nThe Nordic countries (Denmark, Faroe Islands, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden) once expressed interest in a combined bid to host the World Cup on 22 February 2019. Sweden is the only Nordic nation to host the senior World Cup, with the 1958 FIFA World Cup and the 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup being in Sweden, becoming the first country to host both men's and women's World Cups. In June 2019, the Nordic Council declared its support.\nSouth Africa.\nMotivated by the success of the country's recent participation in FIFA women's tournaments, the South African Football Association (SAFA) previously submitted a bid for the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup, but withdrew its bid in December 2019. SAFA CEO Hay Mokoena stated that South Africa would consider bidding for 2027 after the women's league and national team become more competitive. South Africa has hosted the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2010 FIFA World Cup and could use the infrastructure that was built for the tournament. In September 2022, South Africa announced its bid to host the 2027 women's edition. A successful bid would be Africa's first time hosting the Women's World Cup. They sought to host the tournament in eight of the ten venues used for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, with the Ellis Park and Loftus Versfeld Stadium, being replaced by the Orlando Stadium and Griqua Park.\nAfter violence and gunshots during the 2022–23 SAFA Second Division playoffs, SAFA expressed concern about the impact of the violence on the bid.\nOn 24 November 2023, SAFA decided to withdraw its bid to host the tournament and instead focus on submitting a bid for the 2031 tournament."

        "text": "The 2023 Auckland Rugby League season is the 115th season since the founding of the Auckland Rugby League in 1909. The Fox Memorial Shield was won for the 7th time by the Point Chevalier Pirates after they defeated the Richmond Rovers 24–16 in the final on August 19 at Mt Smart Stadium 2. Richmond won the Rukutai Shield for the first time since 2001 which was also the last time they had appeared in the Fox Memorial final. Ollie Tuimavave was awarded the Doug Price Medal for player of the match. The women's competition was won for the first time by the Howick Hornets who beat the Mt Albert Lionesses 36–6 in the final also on August 19. They were awarded the newly made Steele-Shanks Cup. Zayde Sarah-Baldwin won the player of the match award. Mt Albert won the men's Plate competition with a 22–16 win over Te Atatū Roosters with both teams finishing the regular season in 7th and 8th positions in the Fox Premiership. The Sharman Cup was won by the Otara Scorpions who beat Northcote Tigers 30–20 on August 12. It was the second time they had won it with the first being in 2014. Papatoetoe Panthers won the Sharman Cup plate final with a 23–20 win over the Pakuranga Jaguars. Ōtāhuhu Leopards took out the Fox reserve grade competition with a 26–22 win over the reigning champions, the Pt Chevalier Pirates, with Manurewa Marlins winning the Sharman Cup reserve grade competition when they beat Papatoetoe 32–16. The Auckland Rugby League revived the Open Age Restricted competition (90 kg) but only 3 teams fielded sides in the regular season. It is hoped to grow the competition further in 2024. Te Atatū qualified for the final after beating Mt Albert in the semi final, but were defeated comfortably 26–0 by Manurewa in the grand final. Several of the matches were screened live on Sky Sports and a Glenora team then competed in two post season matches against Mt Albert and Te Atatū which were televised on consecutive Wednesday nights. They beat Mt Albert before losing to Te Atatū.\n \n \nNews.\nPremier competitions.\nThe Fox Memorial Shield competition began after a 3-week grading competition. Due to covid disrupted seasons the Auckland Rugby League decided that “2023 will work as a bridge between the 2022 shortened season and by 2025 will see a return to a more exclusive Fox Memorial Premiership competition”. The 3-year plan is for the top 4 teams in the 2023 Sharman Cup to qualify for the qualifying competition in 2024 with 4 pools once more, with the 2025 season seeing only 8 teams in the Fox Memorial premiership, down from the 12 teams that there will be in 2023 and 2024. The women's competition features just the one grade with seven teams in it, down from two grades in 2022 with 13 total teams. The Pt Chevalier and Ponsonby clubs have fielded a combined side named \"City\" and they will play matches at Victoria Park. The Mt Albert club is fielding a team for the first time in a few seasons, named the \"Lionesses\". The women's competition saw a new grand final trophy named after Cherie Steele-Shanks \"whose pioneering efforts began nearly five decades ago when, in 1976, she became a pivotal member of the Glenfield Rugby League club committee\". She served as chair, secretary and treasurer and \"left an unforgettable mark\" on the game after \"creating the New Zealand Women's Rugby League committee in 1996\" with the first national women's tournament following. Both the men's and women's competitions will feature a match each Wednesday night at North Harbour Stadium which will be screened live on Sky TV.\nPlayers of the year awards.\nOn Tuesday, August 15 Auckland Rugby League celebrated their 2023 season award night in the Mad Butcher Lounge at Mt Smart Stadium. Sione Feao (Ōtāhuhu) won the George Rainey Men's Player of the Year award, while Lavinia Tauhalaliku (City) won the Cathy Friends Women's Player of the Year award. The Sharman Cup Player of the Year award went to Tony Siligi (New Lynn).\nClub Players of the Year.\nFox Memorial Premiership\nWomen's Premiership\nSharman Cup\nIndividual Awards.\nMen's Top Goal Kicker\nWomen's Top Goal Kicker\nMen's Top Try-Scorer\nWomen's Top Try-Scorer\nThe StreamShop Men's Best Try\nThe StreamShop Women's Best Try\nMen's Coach of the Year\nWomen's Coach of the Year\nMen's Manager of the Year\nWomen's Manager of the Year\nTeams of the Year.\nGeorge Rainey Fox Memorial Team of the Year\nCathy Friend Women's Team of the Year\nSharman Cup Team of the Year\nFox Memorial Competition.\nThe men's premiership competition started on April 15 with a 3-round grading competition. There were 16 teams competing divided into 4 pools based on their seeding from their finishing positions at the end of the 2021 regular season (with the playoffs cancelled due to covid lockdowns). The Fox Memorial premiership competition began on May 3 with a Wednesday night game between Pt Chevalier and Glenora.\nFox Memorial Qualifying.\nThe 4 pools for qualifying were as follows with seedings in brackets based on the 2021 finishing positions:\nRound 2.\nFreedom Vahaakolo scored his first points for Pt Chevalier in their 24–12 win over Manukau at Moyle Park. The match saw an even first half with the teams level at the break 6–6 before Pt Chevalier opened up an 18–6 lead and held on. The Māngere East - Pakuranga match was the live streamed match of the round and saw the home team, Māngere, winning 30–10. It was a tight first half with just 2 tries scored before it opened up in the second with Māngere scoring 5 tries and Pakuranga 2, including 1 to Counties-Manukau U20 representative Stanley Hingano.\nRound 3.\nPt Chevalier trounced Māngere East 90–4 at Walker Park, though both teams had already progressed to the Fox Memorial competition. At Ti Rakau Park, Manukau won easily 50–16 with Omni Mesake scoring 4 tries for the winners. \nPool B Standings.\nRound 1.\nThe match between Bay Roskill and Richmond at Blockhouse Bay Reserve was filmed by Petes Filming. The home side, Bay Roskill won 30-28 holding off a late Richmond comeback.\nRound 2.\nBay Roskill continued their good early season form, beating Mt Albert 32–16 with former Warrior Ben Henry, who had now been playing for Bay Roskill for several seasons scoring one of their 6 tries. Josh Tanielu kicked 4 goals to add to his 2 tries. Richmond beat Hibiscus Coast 24–18 in a tight match at Grey Lynn Park with Connor Hohepa converting all 4 of their tries. For Hibiscus Coast former St Helens player, Nathan Ashe scored one of their 3 tries.\nRound 3.\nRichmond thrashed Mt Albert at Fowlds Park 46–0 to comfortably secure their place in the Fox competition after jumping out to a 26–0 lead in as many minutes. If Hibiscus Coast had been able to defeat Bay Roskill then Mt Albert would have found themselves competing for the Sharman Cup but Bay Roskill overturned a 6–10 halftime deficit to win 32–16 to record their third straight win and confine Hibiscus Coast to the Sharman Cup competition for 2023.\nPool C Standings.\nRound 2.\nIn Glenora's 34–12 win over Northcote at the Birkenhead War Memorial, Kadiyae Ioka scored a double and kicked 3 goals, while for Northcote Kevin Locke converted Northcote's 2 tries. In Marist's 2 point win over Papakura, Emmanuel Cerei crucially had his kicking boots on, converting all 4 of Marist's tries.\nRound 3.\nMarist went out to a 24–6 halftime lead over Glenora before the match evened up in the second half, while Northcote took an early 4–0 lead but were ultimately over powered by Papakura who went ahead 28–16 before Albert Talakai scored a consolation try for the visitors.\nPool D Standings.\nRound 1.\nŌtāhuhu were fielding a similar team to the previous season and beat Ōtara relatively comfortably 34–16 with William Stowers converting 5 of their 6 tries. Former Widnes Vikings player and son of James Leuluai, Macgraff Leuluai was playing for Ōtara once more. Howick led from the start against Te Atatū who hung around, playing into a strong easterly wind to only trail 20–10 at halftime before the teams traded tries through the second half. Former Parramatta Eels, New Zealand Warriors, and London Broncos player Api Pewhairangi was playing for Te Atatū for the 3rd consecutive season and he scored a try and kicked 3 goals. Brooklyn Harris was on debut for Howick and looked sharp throughout, scoring a try in a man of the match performance.\nRound 2.\nTe Atatū jumped out to a 16–4 lead against Ōtāhuhu before letting in 3 tries before halftime with repeat sets and disputed refereeing calls. The teams traded tries in the second half with Te Atatū having chances to level when the score was 32–28 after crafty young hooker Khalan Clyde crossed twice from dummy half. An Ōtāhuhu break from their own half led to a 76th minute try to seal their 38–28 win. At Ngati Ōtara Park the home side started strongly, scoring 3 tries and taking a 16–6 lead into halftime before rolling on to a 28–10 win. Ben Plummer reporting in the Times Online reported \"fifteen minutes in, and with momentum now very much in the home side's favour, the Scorps didn't waste their opportunity to post first points, going up 6-0. Otara's ... remained disciplined in defence, ran hard and maintained a high completion rate for such wet conditions. This saw them get a roll on, stacking on two further tries before the Hornets would eventually cross late in the half through reserve Nukurua Ngere. With the score at 16-6, Howick gave away a penalty on the hooter, which in turn resulted in a sin bin... The penalty goal was subsequently kicked by Otara, leading into the sheds at half time with an 18-6 scoreline... Once again though, Otara weathered the storm with their united defensive line and swung the momentum back in their favor just as Howick were returned to the full complement of 13 players. The Scorps didn't look back from here and they would go on to extend their lead, scoring two further converted tries, taking the score to 28-6\".\nRound 3.\nWith Ōtāhuhu the only team certain to have already secured qualification going into round 3 for the Fox, both games had a lot riding on them. Te Atatū needed a 10-point win over Ōtara to guarantee a place but after securing a 26–4 halftime lead they were able to control their fate going on to win 48–4. Fine Vakautakakala was outstanding for Te Atatū, scoring 2 tries and carrying strongly throughout the game, while Paterika Vaivai made his season debut for Te Atatū after previously being unavailable due to his playing for the New Zealand Warriors New South Wales Cup side in previous weekends. The Ōtara outside backs looked threatening on attack but struggled to secure much ball. The match was live streamed with Petes Filming. Despite losing at home, Howick were able to move through due to Ōtara's heavy loss.\nGrading round top point scorers.\nThere were several matches with no named scorer of particular tries and goals, and the Mt Albert v Hibiscus Coast match had no scorers submitted whatsoever so this table is indicative only, though these particular scorers records are near complete.\nFox Memorial Shield (Men's Premiership).\nRound 1.\nPt Chevalier and Glenora played in the first televised Wednesday night match on 3 May at North Harbour Stadium. Pt Chevalier won in wet conditions by 26 points to 12 to take home the Stormont Shield (competed for by the finalists from the previous year).

Marist shared the try scoring around with 7 different try scorers, with Emmanuel Cerei converting 6 of them. Māngere East had opened the scoring in the third minute but were dominated after that and could only manage a late first half try and consolation try near the end of the match. Papakura at Prince Edward Park pushed Pt Chevalier, who have won 36 consecutive first grade matches all the way, and in fact took the lead midway through the second half before a Presley Seumanu try levelled the scores at 20–20. Francis Leger's conversion gave the Pirates a lead they would not relinquish. At Jack Colvin Park a Roosters side with several injuries and lineup changes, scored a gutsy 12–6 win over Manukau. Roosters winger Paorostarr Manning scored first after some slick handling enabled him to dive over in the scoreboard corner, before Dawson Mele replied for the visitors after some nice hole running to make it 4–4 at the break. A 58th-minute penalty to Karekake Holamotu put the Magpies up 6–4, but Manning scored his second try in the corner after some nice build up play to put Te Atatū back in front. Then with 8 minutes to go hooker Khalan Clyde dived over from dummy half to all but secure the win. Bay Roskill scored a very rare victory over Glenora, holding on to win 32–30 with Justus Leaoseve scoring a hat trick for the winners. The Vikings led from the 6th minute and were up 32–18 with ten minute to go before Glenora scored two late tries. Kevin Locke kicked 5 from 5 for the Bears.\nRound 3.\nIn the televised Wednesday night match Bay Roskill opened the scoring in the 4th minute and had much of the ball and territory but Mt Albert replied with three converted tries between the 14th and 26th minutes to take an 18–4 lead. Bay Roskill scored on the stroke of halftime and twice more early in the second half to Ariki Honetana-Paea. Mackenzie Kata was then sent off for Bay Roskill after headbutting Trent Schaumkel midway through the second half with winger Josh Colavanua scoring twice soon after for Mt Albert to push the game beyond doubt. The Saturday matches were marked by atrocious weather with 50 knot Westerly winds and driving rain throughout Auckland. At Walter Massey Park the home side, Māngere East struggled early and despite playing with the wind found themselves down 16–0 in as many minutes after Fine Vakautakakala, Delaney Chaney-Puata, and Jacob Rutherford scored for the Roosters and Api Pewhairangi converted two of them in his return. Māngere then began tackling and running with more gusto and scored twice, the second a brilliant try to Christian Sifakula who charged down a kick and ran 30 metres to slide over, with Samuel Lulia converting from out wide to make it 16–12 at the break. Te Atatū used the conditions to play the game in Māngere's half and gradually wore them down, scoring 4 tries including a brilliant effort from Chaney-Puata who chased an angled grubber kick and collected it as he dived full length into the in goal, and on full time live wire hooker Khalan Clyde cut through from halfway and put Robin Herbert in under the posts. At Ōtāhuhu it was not a day for the home team's goal kicker, with 7 unconverted tries including doubles to Tonga Mikaele and Fiohiva Fainga'a. It didn't matter however with Marist only managing 2 converted tries. Richmond ground out a 12–6 win at Grey Lynn Park with Siave Togoiu's 59th minute try proving the difference. At Walker Park, Pt Chevalier held on to the Roope Rooster trophy and extended their unbeaten stretch in first grade games. Lorenzo Filimaua scored a simple try in the 18th minute after Ollie Tuimavave spun out of a tackle and threw a basketball style pass to him. Howick scored in the 27th minute to returning NZ Warriors NSW Cup player Tahi Baggaley. Pt Chevalier then scored 2 unconverted tries before Howick pulled it back to 16–12 in the 62nd minute but the Pirates iced the game 8 minutes later with a try to Brody Tamarua. At Moyle Park, Glenora won in the dying stages with a 77th-minute try to Kadiyae Ioka after the score had been locked at 10–10 from the 50-minute mark.\nRound 4.\nOn Wednesday night Manukau and Māngere East fought out a scrappy match with Manukau ultimately showing their class by winning 32–8 with a 6 try to 2 performance. In the match of the round Pt Chevalier took on Ōtāhuhu at Bert Henham Park and were able to continue their remarkable winning streak with a 14–6 victory. Dylan Tavita and Matthew Whyte scored for the winners, while Makaia Tafua scored Ōtāhuhu's only try late in the match.

Nestley Daniels scored twice for Marist in their home win over Bay Roskill by 24 to 12. Bay Roskill crossed for 3 unconverted tries, 2 to Josh Tanielu. In a tight battle at Harold Moody Park, it took 22 minutes for the first try to be registered with Heemi Davis crossing in the right corner. Glenora had come close to scoring on several other occasions but the try sparked the Papakura attack to life and they scored twice before halftime to take a 10–4 lead into the break. A converted try to Edwin Amituanai early in the second half leveled things up at 10–10 before the ever lively Joseph Price pounced on an error by Kevin Locke in the in goal after Reece Joyce had placed a perfectly weighted kick into the in goal to put the Sea Eagles back up by six following William Pompey's conversion. Papakura had a player sin-binned for a play the ball tangle and Glenora scored in the following set with a try by Israel Levi in the 62nd minute. The conversion from out-wide missed and the game moved up and down the field several times over the final quarter but Papakura hung on for the 2 point win. At Paparoa Park the local side overcame Te Atatū 25 points to 12. The Roosters led 12–6 at the break with 2 converted tries to 1 before the Hornets came home strong.\nRound 5.\n In the Wednesday night match Papakura scored an upset with a well deserved 25–16 win over Howick.

Te Atatū Roosters had another gutsy win over the much larger Ōtāhuhu Leopards at Jack Colvin Park. Paterika Vaivai was making his second appearance for Te Atatū for the season, making a comeback from injury for the New Zealand Warriors NSW Cup side who he had played 7 matches for thus far. Geronimo Doyle who had also been playing for the NSW Cup side was at fullback for Ōtāhuhu. For Te Atatū, Hikoirangi Paki scored a double including a spectacular leap to take a Kahil Johnson bomb early in the match. Robin Herbert scored an unusual try with the Roosters hooking a tight head on a halfway scrum with Herbert able to scoot away and score untouched. The Roosters sealed the match late with prop Fine Taukautakala bursting through a hole on halfway and he used a combination of pace, footwork and strength to make it to the try line. Fiohiva Fainga'a scored a double for the visitors, including a spectacular burst down the right hand sideline leaving would be tacklers in his wake. It was more impressive given he had gone down with an ankle injury minutes earlier. The Leopards will lament a couple of blown tries late, especially Sione Feao who went over the dead ball line in an effort to score closer to the posts. At Murray Halberg Park the Marist Saints scored 5 tries as did the Glenora Bears but the difference was the boot of Emmanuel Cerei who converted all 5 of Marist's tries. Doux Kauhiva crossed twice for the Saints. Glenora had opened the scoring early with a try to the experienced Phillip Kingi. In a battle for the Carol Redman Cup, Richmond continued on their winning ways, avenging a grading round loss to the same opponents, with a 40–26 win. Jeremiah Poutu scored in each half and Beau Cordtz converted 6 of their 7 tries. For Bay Roskill the game was over midway through the second half when Richmond blew the score out to 34–12 but they came home strongly with tries to Nixon Leaso, Joel Leaoseve, and then Zion Tanielu close to full time. Pt Chevalier trailed early to Manukau but then blew them off the field with 9 tries to 9 different players. They were missing the services of regular kicker Fancis Ledger and only converted 4 of their 9 tries. With the win Pt Chevalier joined Richmond as the two only unbeaten sides with 5 from 5 and a clear 4 point lead over their nearest rivals.\nRound 6.\nIn the televised match on Wednesday night from North Harbour Stadium the Richmond (5–0) and Manukau (2–3) sides played out a tight 22–20 match. The Magpies started strongly and led 12–0 after 20 minutes with a try to Riccardo Taunga Arama in the 9th minute and then ten minutes later Samuel Nati scored a clever individual try, grubbering through the line for himself. Richmond struck back just before halftime with a try in the left corner to Jeremiah Poutu after a flick offload from Carlos Henry. Early in the second half Nicholas Halalilo, who was returning from the New Zealand Warriors NSW Cup team, where he had played 9 matches, scored to put the Bulldogs ahead. Immediately after Ropati Tupa'i scored a clever try from a last tackle chip. Manukau replied with two tries on the right edge to regain the lead with Samuel Nati orchestrating their attack. Crucially he was unable to convert either of the tries. In the 75th minute Richmond converted a sustained attack into a try to Isaiah Sofa and Beau Cordtz's calm conversion gave them the win. The match between Te Atatū and Glenora for the Dennis Williams Cup saw the visiting Glenora side retain the trophy with a close 16–12 win.

The second half saw Te Atatū score immediately after the break from a spilled bomb, with Semisini Lopeti getting over. The Roosters spent a huge amount of time in the Bears half but were unable to score with last tackle plays falling flat several times. Then against the run of play the Bears scored in the 69th minute after securing the ball from a contested bomb on the Te Atatū 20 metre line, and from the ensuing movement Siuatonga Likiliki slid over in the right corner. In the 76th minute Robin Herbert broke through on halfway and kicked ahead, and keeping the ball on the toe scored a brilliant individual try to the right of the posts to give the Roosters a chance but they were unable to create anything with the full time whistle going shortly after. Ōtāhuhu crashed to their third straight defeat, going down at home to Howick who got their noses in front in the second half after the Leopards led 6–4 at halftime. Jacob Paulo received his blazer for making his 50th first grade appearance for the Leopards. Papakura controlled the match at Prince Edward Park and raced out to a 28–4 lead after 27 minutes before the Vikings worked their way back into the game but never really threatened to win. For Papakura, Stedman Lefau scored a double and William (Tuhi) Pompey kicked 5 goals. At Fowlds Park in Mt Albert the visiting Marist Saints dominated the first half and took a 26–6 lead into halftime. Takaia Williams scored twice for the Saints, with Emmanuel Cerei kicking 4 goals to move to 97 points for the season. At Walker Park the Pt Chevalier Pirates made short work of Māngere East, winning 80–6 to move top of the table on point percentage.\nRound 7.\nThe Wednesday night match saw Marist win a seesawing battle with Te Atatū. The Roosters scored early to Tuteauru Maipi but the kicking of Emmanuel Cerei and Doux Kauhiva from both kickoffs and general play terrorised the Te Atatū side throughout the match with 2 kickoff turnovers, and multiple spilled bombs and grubber kicks. The Saints also scored 3 tries directly from last tackle kicks to Emmanuel Cerei, Doux Kauhiva, and Cyruss Payne. Te Atatū showed some nice attacking play and scored tries to Robin Herbert and Semisini Lopeti in the first half. The second half saw the Roosters retake the lead with a crafty try through the middle to Api Pewhairangi before a cacophony of handling errors saw the West Auckland side collapse and Marist stretched their lead with a brilliant ad lib play on the last tackle with Cyruss Payne scoring a try in the right corner from a kick by Emmanuel Cerei in the 71st minute. Te Atatū had a couple of chances to potentially tie the match but errors again ruined their chances and they finished with a 57% completion rate versus Marist's 84%. Marist solidified a top 4 spot with the win. At Blockhouse Bay Reserve the visiting Pt Chevalier Pirates scored in the 9th minute to Harry Durbin and never looked back with 3 more first half tries giving them a 22–4 lead at the break. Bay Roskill were competitive for periods of time but couldn't contain the large Pirates side. Francis Leger scored after a penalty tap from near halfway to extend their lead to 28–4 soon after halftime before Xavier Tutaki crashed over under the posts for the Vikings in the 68th minute. The Pirates put the icing on the cake with two more late tries including a 70-metre run from forward, Levi Helleur-Atiga who scored by the posts. Point Chevalier's consecutive win streak stretching out to 42 games.\nRound 8.\nThe Wednesday night match was moved to Te Atatū South Park after North Harbour Stadium became unavailable due to Auckland's extremely long spell of wet weather and Mt Smart # 2 ground not being ready after surface maintenance. Bay Roskill were wrecked by injury but held Ōtāhuhu out until Geronimo Doyle jinked his way through a hole and went 40 metres to score. On halftime Fiohiva Fainga'a scored on the stroke of halftime to make it 10–0. The second half was one way traffic with Ōtāhuhu scoring 7 tries from the 48th minute to the 75th minute before Bay Roskill scored a try on full time to Sefanaia Cowley-Lupo to earn their first points. The match was live streamed on the Sky TV and the Auckland Rugby League YouTube channel. At Walker Park, Point Chevalier defended the Roope Rooster trophy with a hard-fought 28–20 win over Te Atatū. The Roosters played with the benefit of a strong westerly wind and went out to a 12–0 lead after tries to Api Pewhairangi and Tuteauru Maipi. The Pirates after some near misses saw Francis Leger use footwork to get over and when Lorenzo Filimaua went over the scores were locked. Kahil Johnson gave Te Atatū a lead with a conversion near halftime. It took the Pirates until the 64th minute to take the lead with Harry Durbin running a nice line to go over. Levi Helleur-Atiga scored two classy tries to extent their lead before Maipi grabbed his second try late in the match for Te Atatū. Richmond made short work of Marist at Grey Lynn Park with a 36–8 win to take the Eddie Poching Memorial Cup. They burst out to a 24–4 halftime lead and never looked threatened.

The game was locked at 4–4 at halftime following tries to Josiah Fatialofa (Howick) and Anthony Goulton (Glenora). Fatialofa's was an effort in strength when in a 3-man tackle on the try line he somehow ripped his arms free to plant the ball. Goulton's came in a typical full speed sprint to the corner on the stroke of halftime. Howick showed their strength immediately after the break with some power running seeing them crash over for tries to Manu Fatialofa and Nukurua Ngere, before the third member of the Fatialofa family, Kaylise-Jesse Fatialofa, crossed for a try following a clever snap shot grubber into the in goal by Phrankyln Mano-Le-Mamea. Despite both teams coming close on a few occasions the last 28 minutes were scoreless. Glenora players Tulsan Caird and Jordan Tuarae played in their 100th first grade games for the Bears and had many supporters in attendance. The match between Papakura and Mt Albert was a testimonial to raise money for Papakura player, Roman Tuhimata, who had been diagnosed with DRSCT Sarcoma in November 2022. Mt Albert jumped out to a 10–0 lead before the home team took over with winger Kristopher Smithson running in 5 tries.

His personal haul totalled 28 points. Richmond went close to ending Pt Chevaliers unbeaten streak when they jumped out to a 14–6 lead following an early try to Jeremiah Poutu in the left corner. Dylan Tavita, the leading try scorer in the competition jumped out of dummy half to equalise for the Pirates following Francis Leger's conversion. Hawaiiki Annandale scored from dummy half for Richmond to re-establish their lead and then Puotu slipped over from 15 metres out to make it 14–6. But tries to Matthew Whyte who crashed over on the left edge and Ollie Tuimavave who scootered over in the same area in the second half saw the Pirates draw 14–14 and retain the Roope Rooster trophy. While they maintained their unbeaten streak into the 40s they did lose their winning streak. The match was streamed on Petes Filming. Manukau tipped over Marist at Murray Halberg Park 22–14. The Saints lead 14–6 before the visitors surged home with 3 tries in 14 minutes to take the much needed win. At Jack Colvin the visiting Vikings scored 2 early tries, to Nixon Leaso who chased a bomb which was spilled into his arms, and then Josh Tanielu after a 90-metre effort sparked by a touchline run from Nixon Leaoseve. Te Atatū gradually asserted themselves and wore down the Vikings with solid defense and attack in the centre of the field. Khalan Clyde made several line breaks from dummy half while Ihaka Taka-Brown carried strongly and scored the go ahead try in the 44th minute before Api Pewhairangi, Ryhs Wikitera, and Paora Starr Manning rounded things off.

The second half saw plenty of tries but many unforced errors from both sides. Levi Helleur-Atiga capped off the night with a scything effort in the 76th minute to score by the posts to give the Pirates a 38–18 win.

Following a try from a bomb to John Laufiso they extended their lead to 14–4 before a broken play length of the field try to Robin Herbert for Te Atatū.

The previous record set in the 1990s was 17 by the City-Pt Chev side. Mt Albert deserved the win with a 6 try to 4 performance with and late try and Eiden Ackland field goal securing the win. The win meant Richmond, with their 32–12 win over Glenora won the Rukutai Shield for the first time since 2001. On the televised Wednesday night match the larger Papakura side were too strong for the inconsistent Te Atatū team. Api Pewhairangi was shut down by a rush defence and they struggled to execute any last tackle plays or kicks. Tangata Tukinga impressed with 2 tries for the Sea Eagles. For Te Atatū, Fine Vakautakakala carried an enormous workload as one of their only ball carriers who could make any headway into the staunch Papakura defence. In place of Tuhi Pompey, Peter Oliveti kicked 3 conversions from 4. Ōtāhuhu continued their impressive form destroying Manukau 62–6 at Moyle Park. Geronimo Doyle and Mavae Manuika both scored 3 tries for the winners.

Nine minutes from time however Howick crossed to take the lead and then secured the win with another try in the dying stages. The win meant they progressed to the semi finals to play Pt Chevalier. At Prince Edward Park the Papakura Sea Eagles were taking on fellow South Auckland team, the in form Ōtāhuhu Leopards. The Leopards had several early sets near the Papakura try line but were unable to cross in the face of sturdy defence. Somewhat against the run of play the Sea Eagles scored from one of their first real attacking sets in the 20th minute with Jamie Henry literally walking across untouched in the left hand corner after a mid field offload caught the Leopards defence short. William (Tuhi) Pompey kicked a beautiful touchline conversion to give the home team a 6–0 lead. Then from a kick reception error Viliami Tahitua who was having a storming game gathered in the ball and wrong footed the last defender to cross over. Pompey again kicked a nice goal from wide out on the right for a 12–0 halftime lead. Ōtāhuhu came out focussed after the break and scored almost immediately with Mavae Manuika diving over in the right corner. The conversion from Geronimo Doyle wide out crucially missed. Despite getting on attack several times the Leopards were unable to breach the defence until eventually William Stowers was put in and ran around under the posts. Doyle's quick conversion narrowed the score to 10–12 but from the kickoff hard working prop, Connor Tairua-Purcell spilled the ball in the first tackle and with the Sea Eagles launching a counterattack a penalty was awarded for an early tackle. Pompey kicked the penalty from a handy position and the Sea Eagles hung on for the final few minutes finishing on attack when the final hooter went. They progressed to play Richmond at Grey Lynn Park in the other semi final. \nSemi Finals.\n Pt Chevalier thrashed Howick 58–10 at Walker Park under still conditions and rare blue winter skies in 2023. Howick had several attacking chances in the first 15 minutes but while attacking in the Pirates half very early in the match the ball was spilled into the lap of Freedom Vahaakolo who ran 60 metres to outpace the chasers to score behind the posts. A short time later they crossed again with Presley Seumanu taking an offload near the line by Levi Helleur-Atiga who constantly looked dangerous with the ball. Howick got on the board after a left edge attack to make it 12–4. From this point on it was a Pt Chevalier avalanche with Ollie Tuimavave cruising in wide on the left before Jacob Auloa crashed over by the posts. Then from the next set Levi Helleur-Atiga latched on to a Francis Leger kick before gliding past Phranklyn Mano-Le-Mamea to score. Another try followed on halftime to Siapo Pasene to blow the score out to 30–4 making the contest all but done by the break. The Pirates didn't let off in the second half, scoring another 6 tries to complete the rout and book their spot in the Fox final. In the other semi final between Richmond and Papakura at Grey Lynn Park a huge crowd of over 600 was in attendance. Richmond captain Casey Tomain was celebrating his 50th match for the side. In contrast to the other semi final just two tries were scored in a huge defensive battle with the sides eventually only separated by Beau Cordtz's 65th-minute penalty. The Sea Eagles went in first in the 9th minute with an unconverted try to Lewis Soosemea. Tuhi Pompey missed the conversion but kicked a penalty in the 17th minute from in front 30 metres out. The Bulldogs leveled things up with a try to Navajo Doyle who also converted it in the 30th minute. The second half was a seesaw battle, though the Bulldogs had the better of the field position and attacked the Sea Eagles line several times to no avail. Both sides threw their bodies into contact repeatedly with some huge collisions as things grew more desperate with Jeremiah Poutu in particular carrying the ball back strongly from kicks on several occasions. James Gavet was forced from the field with less than ten minutes remaining with a shoulder injury after a hit up into a Papakura wall of defenders. Cordtz had a chance to kick a penalty for Richmond midway through the second half but from a handy position it slid outside the left upright. He had another chance 5 minutes later from right in front 14 metres out which he was successful with this time. The Sea Eagles attacked the Bulldogs line multiple times over the remaining 15 minutes but their barge over efforts from dummy half were resisted while when they went wide the plays were stifled by a desperate Bulldogs defence. The Sea Eagles last chance came with a chip bomb which came down on the Bulldogs try line but was spilled over the dead ball line with multiple players competing for the ball. The home side then worked the ball to halfway from the 20m restart when the full time hooter went meaning Richmond had made their first Fox final since 2001.\nFox Memorial Grand Final.\n Point Chevalier won the grand final 24–16 in a tense encounter before a 2,000 strong crowd. Around 1,500 Richmond supporters packed in to see their side play in first grand final since 2001, and seeking to win for the first time since 1980. The match was streamed on YouTube and broadcast live on Sky Sports. Siapo Pasene nearly scored at the end of Pt Chevalier's first set but had received the ball from a forward pass before diving over in the left corner. Top try scorer in Auckland senior league this year, Dylan Tavita eventually opened the scoring after powering his way over from dummy half in the 10th minute. Beau Cordtz replied for Richmond in the 18th minute doing a disappearing act near the line and slipping through a hole after bumping off Amaramo Solomona and evading Ollie Tuimavave. Tavita scored his second try in the 33rd minute after spilling out of James Gavet's tackle and planting the ball over the line under the crossbar as referee Parkinson ruled that he was not held. Richmond responded once more after Jeremiah Poutu fielded a kick on his 20m line and raced 65 metres to put the Bulldogs in great attacking position. They went wide to the right two tackles later and Mose Newton crossed in the right corner with 3 minutes until halftime. Beau Cordtz's conversion missed leaving Pt Chevalier with a 12–10 lead at the break with the stats showing both teams had 50% possession with the Bulldogs completing at 94% to the Pirates 75%. It took until the 20th minute of the second half for the next points after substitute Navajo Doyle went from dummy half near the try line and shoved his way over in a three-man tackle. Beau Cordtz who was having a big game converted to give them a 4-point lead. From this point on the Pirates experience came through and they began to dominate field position and possession. In the 62nd minute Levi Helleur-Atiga and James Gavet were both sin-binned after a scuffle which saw Gavet slap Helleur-Atiga who retaliated with a punch. A short time later the Pirates pressure on the try line saw Freedom Vahaakolo go through two would be tacklers to level the scores 16–16 in the 65th minute. Leger's conversion from wide out went over to put the Pirates back in front. Pt Chevalier all but sealed it with a bizarre try to Zensei Inu in the 67th minute after Patrick Sipley played the ball on the try line and the defence paused while Inu simply picked it up and placed it over the line virtually uncontested. Sipley had a huge game carrying the ball 17 times while propping partners Harry Durbin (13 carries), and Herman Retzlaff (15 carries) also powered the team forward throughout the match. The Pirates controlled the last 5 minutes pinning the Bulldogs in their half and having two failed drop goal attempts by Tavita before the siren sounded to hand them another title. Ollie Tuimavave was awarded the Doug Price Man of the Match.\nFox Plate playoffs.\nThe Fox Plate was played for between teams which finished 7th to 12th in the Fox Memorial competition. \nWeek 1.\nMt Albert and Te Atatū had byes for finishing 7th and 8th respectively. Glenora demolished Māngere East 90–8 at Harold Moody Park with Johnny Fine scoring 4 tries for the home team, while Kadiyae Ioka scored twice and kicked 11 goals for 30 points. The Hawks finished a season to forget with yet another trouncing meaning they had won just once in 15 games. Meanwhile, in Māngere itself, the Manukau Magpies comfortably beat the Bay Roskill Vikings 44–18. Carlos Seuseu opened the scoring for the visitors at Moyle Park but it was then one way traffic with Manukau scoring 8 tries, including 4 to Kahn Munokoa before the break to take a 40–6 lead before Bay Roskill tightened up in the second half and Manukau eased off. Koronato John scored his second close to full time to cap the win. Manukau progressed to play away at Mt Albert, while Glenora would travel across West Auckland to Te Atatū to take on the Roosters in the other plate semi final.\nSemi finals.\nTe Atatū were close to full strength for the first time in many weeks and dispatched Glenora easily by 32 points to 6. It was their first win over their West Auckland rivals for well over a decade. Paterika Vaivai made his first appearance since the match with Marist in round 7 and he opened the scoring with a 7th minute try. Api Pewhairangi also scored a first half try for the Roosters and kicked 3 conversions. Glenora's only points came from a try on the left edge to Zion Ioka in the 51st minute, converted by Kevin Locke. Elusive fullback, Robin Herbert, scored a double to bring up 7 tries for the season while Bostyn Hakaraia scored a second half try and kicked a goal. In the other semi final Mt Albert struggled to overcome Manukau at Fowlds Park with the scores locked at 0–0 at halftime and 4–4 with 20 minutes to go before the home side eased away with tries to Corey Seator and Trent Schaumkel.\nFull season top try scorers and point scorers.\nThe lists are calculated from the 3 qualifying games and the Fox Memorial premiership matches which followed, also including all playoff matches in the Fox premiership and plate competitions. Several teams did not submit their scorers names on occasion with unsubmitted named points in brackets: Howick (110), Papakura (70), Mt Albert (54), Manukau (52), Māngere East (32), Ōtāhuhu (36), Bay Roskill (20), and Marist (1). As such the following lists are possibly incomplete, although the records for players from Richmond, Pt Chevalier, Te Atatū, Glenora, and Marist (for the most part) are complete. The official awards for try scoring and goal kicking were calculated only on the main regular season competitions and differ from the below tables. For example, Emmanuel Cerei and Fiohiva Fainga'a tied for the ARL goal kicking title as Francis Leger kicked 26 of his goals in the grading round and 8 more in the semi final and final wins which did not count towards the award. While Dylan Tavita scored 8 of his 18 tries in grading and playoff matches with Geronimo Doyle scoring all 11 of his tries in the Fox regular season games.\nWomen's Premiership.\nThe women's competition has reduced significantly in numbers from 2022 where 13 teams competed.

In the words of Times Online writer, Ben Plummer, \"the women have well and truly taken chanrge of their competition after their first two games, winning both in convincing fashion\".\nRound 4.\nIn the Wednesday night televised match it was a seesawing battle between City and Manurewa Kowhai. Both teams initially struggled to crack their opponents defence with it moving from end to end but with no points until Mary Jane Finau crashed over under the posts in the 31st minute for City. Manurewa replied soon after to Nancy Sikei, before City regained the lead on the break with a try to Mikayla Eli. City started the second half strongly scoring twice to lead 18–10. Manurewa replied with two tries of their own including a brilliant effort from a regathered kick, with Crystal Stowers crashing over in a tackle. The conversion by Eli gave Manurewa a 20–18 lead. It only lasted three minutes before Tauhalaliku scored after some nice lead up play with the try proving to be the difference, the match ending 22–20.

At Fowld's Park, Mt Albert held a 24–10 lead before City stormed home, scoring tries to Marewa Samson, Alayna Kamuhemu, and Paris Pickering to steal the win, with Paulina Morris-Ponga converting 2 of them. \nRound 7.\n In the Wednesday night game the Howick side had to win it with a late try to Cilia-Marie Po'e-Tofaeono after Manurewa had levelled the scores with a try to Ngatokotoru Arakua in the 68th minute. Ōtara had a narrow win over the Lionesses at Fowlds Park to continue their unbeaten run. Both sides crossed for 3 tries with the only conversion of the match by Jhana Magele proving the difference.

Lavinia Tauhalaliku scored 3 tries for City, while Ilaisaane Taufa scored a double for Mt Albert in a 6 try effort. Both teams struggled with their goal kicking with just 2 of the 11 tries converted. On Friday night at Bert Henham Park the Leopards beat Taniwharau 20–10 with Onjeurlina Leiataua scoring on halftime to bring up her 8th try of the season. Taniwharau threatened an upset when they scored a converted try early in the second half to Waimea Nikau-Rangimake to make it 6–8 to Ōtāhuhu, before the home team crossed twice with tries to Roena Matautia and Sade Schaumkel to hold them off. In a hard-fought match at Ngati Ōtara Park, the home side outlasted the Hornets 28–20. The Hornets took a 20–18 lead in the top of the table clash in the 56th minute after Jess Mani crossed. But Ōtara regained the lead shortly after with Marina Hagain scoring her second try, and then Jhana Magele iced the game in the 69th minute with a try.\nRound 10.\nTaniwharau registered their first win of the 2023 season with an 18–8 win over Manurewa Kowhai. They scored early to Leah-Rhys Toka after Honor Wilson sliced through before Manurewa replied with a try to Kataraina-Tuhakaraina Karaka-Whittaker crashing over in the right corner. Taniwharau then re-established their position further with tries to Waimea Nikau-Rangi after great set up play from Toki before halftime and Nga Mako Totorewa early in the second half. Manurewa threatened a comeback when Laila Foki crossed but Toki shut any thoughts of that down with her second try in the 71st minute try to seal the win. The match between City and Ōtara was not able to be played as no referees arrived at the ground.\nRound 11.\nOn Wednesday night at Harold Moody Park in Glen Eden, Ōtāhuhu threatened a huge upset when they took a 10–8 lead in the 61st minute with a try to Jayme Latu. They had looked threatening with the ball throughout much of the second half however Ōtara proved how good they are by responding with a try to Ajah Roebeck Lesoa in the 70th minute which ultimately proved the difference in their 12–10 win. The second half had a running time of 56 minutes after three injury breaks including a serious knee injury to Roena Matautia who was taken off by St Johns after being bent back in a tackle. Taniwharau pushed the 3rd placed Mt Albert Lionesses all the way before going down 22–16 with Ilaisaane Taufa scoring a try and kicking 3 goals to add to her points tally for the season while Mafi Faukafa scored a double for the Lionesses. Taniwharau will rue their kicking with 4 unconverted tries. At Mountfort Park, the home side struggled against a well rested City team and went down 30–4. Lavinia Tauhalaliku scored a hat trick, with former Cook Islands women's national football team player, Pauline Morris-Ponga scoring 10 points through a try and 3 conversions.\nRound 12.\nOne of the title contenders, City easily beat Ōtāhuhu at Mount Smart Stadium 2 on Wednesday night. Lavinia Tauhalaliku scored her third consecutive hat trick to move further ahead in the try scoring standings with 13 in total. Her third came with a solo run from 40 metres out where she sprinted through the middle of the defense and scored untouched. Paulina Morris-Ponga piloted over 3 conversions with her front on style to bring up 52 points for the season. Onjeurlina Leiataua crossed for Ōtāhuhu to score her 9th try of the season. Ōtāhuhu outscored City in the second half, like they had done so in their loss the previous week to Ōtara but it was their poor first half which cost them a chance of the win.\nRound 13.\nIn the 6th minute Mt Albert crossed when Shaniece Monshau hit a hole and went in, however Leio Fotu-Moala equalised shortly after for Howick. Earlier a head injury to Lisa Po'e-Tofaeono saw her leave the field and go to hospital. Summer Van Gelder then scored a spectacular solo try taking a bomb 8 metres from her line and then beat multiple defenders to score under the posts. Taylor Curtis beat Van Gelger in a 45-metre run on the right edge to equalise the scores at 10–10 in the 28th minute. Mt Albert retook the lead through a try to Danika Manase to take a 16–10 lead into the break.

She later scored her third with another strong run using pace to reach the line in the 68th minute. Platinum Marsters kicked her third conversion to give Howick a 22–16 lead which they held on to.\nRound 14.\nIn the Wednesday night match 15 tries were scored. Taniwharau showed their much improved form by scoring 7 of them but most were wide out so Calista Ruruku was unable to convert any. In the second half Laraine Fox of Taniwharau was sent off for throwing punches in a melee. Tia Toka scored a double for Taniwharau, while Lavinia Tauhalaliku did likewise for City to take her season tally to 15.

Summer Van Gelder scored shortly afterwards when she eluded the grasping defence on a short swerving run. In the 32nd minute Lor-El Loto dived over from dummy-half for what turned out to be the home team's only points. Referee Andrew Harris was replaced at halftime by Rebecca Ellison after he injured his leg. Immediately after the break Moana Cook broke through on the left edge and went 60 metres to score, with Ilaisaane Taufa's conversion putting them out to a 16–4 lead.

Zayde Sarah-Baldwin responded for the Hornets diving over from dummy half in the 16th minute. Jonsel Tautari went herself with a dummy, step, and powered through by the posts to put the Hornets 12–6 in front following Platinum Marsters conversion. Sarah-Baldwin then jinked her way over after 32 minutes and when Taylor Curtis crossed in the right corner just before halftime the game was slipping away for the Lionesses who now trailed 22–6. They had completed just 6 of their 10 sets while the Hornets had completed 9 of their 12. The Hornets opened the scoring in the second half with an almost identical try in the right corner again to Curtis.

The bid was announced on April 19, 2023.\nBackground.\nBefore his resignation in 2017, former U.S. Soccer president Carlos Cordeiro expressed an interest in having the U.S. host the tournament, stating \"I believe we can and should host the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2027.\" However, it was not known where current president Cindy Parlow Cone could have stood on a possible bid. If successful, the U.S. would host the Women's World Cup one year after co-hosting the 2026 FIFA World Cup and one year before Los Angeles hosts the Summer Olympics again. The United States has previously hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup and this tournament twice in a row in 1999 and 2003. It was reported on August 6, 2021, that U.S. Soccer was considering a bid for the 2031 Women's World Cup as an alternative before reinstating its plan for 2027 on June 17, 2022.\nOn June 21, 2022, the president of the Mexican Football Federation, Yon de Luisa, announced interests in hosting the 2027 edition and would seek to make a bid for it. Mexico has never hosted a FIFA Women's World Cup, but has hosted the men's World Cup twice, in 1970 and 1986, and will do so again as joint host for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. A joint bid between the United States and Mexico was announced on April 19, 2023, prior to a friendly match between the men's teams.\nFIFA football tournament hosting experiences.\nTogether, Mexico, and the United States have hosted 8 FIFA events and are scheduled to host the 2026 World Cup, which is the most of any duo of geographically connected nations.\nIn addition, both countries have hosted at least one Olympic football tournament. Mexico in Mexico City 1968, and the United States hosted twice – in Los Angeles 1984 and Atlanta 1996. The Atlanta Games were the first to include a women's tournament.\nProposed venues.\nThe United States and Mexico have jointly announced their preparedness to host a World Cup, intending to utilize the same venues, infrastructure, and protocols as employed for the Men's World Cup the previous year. 16 cities (5 in Mexico and 11 in the United States) were confirmed by the bid book."

        "text": "The 1929–30 Villanova Wildcats men's ice hockey season was the inaugural season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nDespite problems from the great depression, Villanova was able to join several other local schools and clubs in the area and found an official ice hockey team in late 1929. Rudy Fried, the owner of the Philadelphia Ice Palace, was of particular help to the program by allowing the team to use the locker rooms and rink. Mr. Meyer, the manager of the Philadelphia Arrows, was also a big help by lending the Arrows' equipment in lieu of their own. One of the Arrows' players, Herb Gardiner agreed to coach the team, however, as he was also engaged by Penn, he was eventually replaced by Levine.\nThe Wildcats played an exhibition game in early January against the Philadelphia Monarchs. They were able to win the game 3–0 and provide hope that the team's first season could be better than expected. After electing Phil Hillen as team captain by a coin toss, Villanova's first official game was against the Penn Athletic Club on February 16. Eskimo Kennedy recorded two goals while line mate Joe Delaney nabbed the other in the team's surprising 3–3 tie. After the match, Penn A.C. requested a return game to settle the draw and the Wildcats agreed. Before that could take place, however, Villanova faced Penn on the 22nd. Since Penn A. C. had already defeated the Quakers twice that year, the Wildcats believed they had a chance for a victory. Unfortunately, a massive 7-goal second period from the Quakers ended any chance for Villanova that they fell 3–7.\nAfter the humbling loss, the team had a couple weeks for practice before the rematch with Penn A. C. They looked more like they had in their first few games but, due to a hat-trick from former Harvard star William Saltonstall, they dropped their second game of the season. The two teams then agreed to play one final time, with the third match happening in Atlantic City. Coming into the game, the team was set on stopping Saltonstall, which they accomplished. Unfortunately, Roger Buntin was able to take up the mantle and score three goals for the Pennacs. Despite the loss, the team had thrilled the crowd of 3,500 with 5 goals of their own. Kennedy was the team's high-scorer, netting a hat-trick himself to finish the year as the Wildcats' leading scorer.\nJulius Becza served as team manager.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The Rutgers–Seton Hall men's basketball rivalry, also known as the Garden State Hardwood Classic, is an intercollegiate basketball intrastate rivalry between the Rutgers Scarlet Knights of Rutgers University in Piscataway, NJ and Seton Hall Pirates of Seton Hall University in Newark, NJ. The series dates to 1916 and the teams have met continuously since 1996, with the exception of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Former conference opponents in the Big East, Rutgers left for the American Athletic Conference in 2013 and then the Big Ten in 2014, while Seton Hall continued in the restructured Big East as part of the 2010–2014 NCAA conference realignment. Since changing conferences, the schools have continued to meet annually in the non-conference slate.\nThe rivalry is a trophy game, with the Garden State Hardwood Classic trophy at stake. The 33-pound wooden memento, made from reclaimed Asbury Park boardwalk planks, is fashioned in the shape of New Jersey with the teams' logos imprinted on it.\nSeries History.\nWhile the teams met intermittently before, the series began to be played more regularly in the 1970s on a near-annual basis. Rutgers joined the Pirates in the Big East Conference in 1995, ensuring an annual matchup, including several years with a regular season home-and-home. In the early 2000s, a revival in Scarlet Knight fortunes led to several high-profile and heated games between the rivals. The teams continued to meet annually in the non-conference slate after diverging paths in conference realignment.\nAfter the 2020 game was not scheduled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the teams squabbled about whether to continue the rivalry. Rutgers had hammered Seton Hall in their previous 2019 meeting in Piscataway but Seton Hall did not schedule the Scarlet Knights for 2020, using the rationale that they could not have fans in the arena due to COVID-19 restrictions. Rutgers fans accused the Hall of ducking what turned out to be its first NCAA Tournament team in 30 years in order to avoid a second-straight loss. Rutgers’ stance was that it was willing to play at Seton Hall last season and that they should resume the series in Piscataway per the terms of the contract. Seton Hall continued to insist the game be played in Newark or not at all. Ultimately, the Scarlet Knights conceded that the 2021 game would be played in Newark.\nOnce played, the No. 23-ranked Pirates won 77–63. With the win, Seton Hall coach Kevin Willard moved past P.J. Carlesimo into second place (213 wins) on the program's all-time coaching wins list, behind only Naismith Hall of Famer Honey Russell (294 wins). Seton Hall also took strides to limit the number of Rutgers fans at the Prudential Center by boxing them out from getting tickets through the normal channels and only 1,500 Scarlet-clad faithful attended. Nonetheless, Seton Hall's efforts reduced the number from the 2016 and 2018 sellouts, in which there were roughly 3,000 Rutgers supporters. The following year, Seton Hall won its second consecutive game in the series in a low-scoring 45–43 contest and the first time victory in Piscataway since 2015.\nRival Accomplishments.\nThe following summarizes the accomplishments of the two programs."

WBSC accepted the suggestion after an executive meeting, giving the \"World Champion\" title to the WBC winner on the condition that the Classic should have direct qualifications and follow international anti-doping rules.\nThe tournament is the first of its kind to have the national teams of IBAF's member federations feature professional players from the major leagues around the world, including Major League Baseball. In addition to providing a format for the best baseball players in the world to compete against one another while representing their home countries, the World Baseball Classic was created in order to further promote the game around the globe.\nAfter a three-year gap between the first two installments of the tournament, plans were made for the World Baseball Classic to be repeated every four years following the 2009 event. The third installment of the Classic was held in 2013, and the fourth was held in 2017.\nThe fifth and most recent Classic was scheduled for 2021, but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. After the pandemic-induced delay, the 2023 World Baseball Classic was held between March 8–21, with Japan defeating the United States 3–2 in the championship game.\nThe sixth and next Classic is scheduled for 2026, with the scheduling frequency of future Classic editions being subject to the terms and conditions agreed at the next collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between MLB, MLBPA."

The club was a member of the ECAC West, a Division III conference that was home to several other New York schools. After decent results in their first season, an NCAA-required transition year, the club fell on hard times, going winless over the following two seasons. The team was finally able to win again during their fourth season but the Bearcats remained near the bottom of the conference standings. After 5 years and little to show for their efforts, the program was shuttered for financial reasons.\nIn April 2023, Binghamton AD Gene Marshall announced that the school was planning to add both Division I men's ice hockey and women's field hockey for the 2024-25 athletic season. If the plan comes to fruition, the Bearcats would be the 65th D-I program at the time of their first game.\nSeason-by-season results.\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties\""

They began on 25 April 2023 and were played through 10 May 2023. The top eight finishers in the regular season qualified for the playoffs, which consist of four series of two teams each, to be played in a best-of-five format.

Should the tie persist among some, but not all, of the teams, the ranking of the teams still tied will be determined by again taking into account the victories in the games played only among them, and repeating this same procedure until the tie is entirely resolved.\nIf a tie persists, the ranking will be determined by the goal difference in favour and against in the games played only among the teams still tied.\nSeries.\nThe first playoff series was determined on 13 April 2023, in the last round of the regular season. Maccabi Playtika Tel Aviv won against Real Madrid, which ensured them the 5th place and a matchup against AS Monaco, who were already guaranteed to finish 4th. The remaining three series were determined a day later. Žalgiris, who started the round outside the playoffs, won against Bayern Munich to clinch 7th place and a matchup against Barcelona, who in the meantime defeated Valencia Basket to overtake Real Madrid for the 2nd place. By beating Panathinaikos at home in a dramatic fashion, Partizan Mozzart Bet finished 6th, with Real Madrid emerging as their opponent. Thus, Fenerbahçe Beko, who started the round at 5th place, dropped to 8th due to worse head-to-head record with Žalgiris, ensuring a matchup against regular season winners Olympiacos.\nThe schedule for the first four games of the series, with dates and times, was announced on 14 April 2023. Salle Gaston Médecin in Fontvieille hosted the playoffs' opening game, when AS Monaco played Maccabi Playtika Tel Aviv on 25 April 2023 at 20:15 CEST, and two games were played on each match day.

        "text": "Jan Jensen is an American basketball coach and former basketball player. Jensen currently serves as the assistant head coach for the Iowa Hawkeyes women's team. She spent her playing career at Drake, where she led NCAA Division I women's in scoring in 1990–91.\nEarly life.\nJensen was born in the small rural town of Kimballton, Iowa. Basketball played a large part in Jensen's family background. Her grandmother, Dorcas Andersen, was part of a team that won the Iowa state basketball tournament in 1921. The team played a brand of 6-on-6 basketball that saw popularity in rural Iowa – a popularity uncommon for women's sports during this time period. The local newspaper dubbed Andersen \"Lottie\" in reference to her scoring \"a lot of points.\"\nJensen played high school basketball at Elk Horn–Kimballton High School. As a senior, she led the country with 66 points per game (ppg) in 1987. For her high school career, she was inducted into the Iowa Girls High School Basketball Hall of Fame in 1993. She also ran track and played volleyball and softball in high school.\nCollege career.\nJensen accepted a scholarship to play basketball for the Drake Bulldogs. In Jensen's senior season, Lisa Bluder became the head coach for Drake. Jensen was initially skeptical of Bluder's hiring, stating \"It's kind of, are you kidding me, right? New coach. I'm a senior. And then it ended up being really the best thing. She was just tremendous. She was really just a player's coach and intense but knew how to make it fun. Obviously, it benefited me.\" Jensen led Division I women's basketball in scoring that season, finishing with 29.6 ppg. For the season, she was also named a Kodak Honorable Mention All-American, a member of the All-Gateway team, and the GTE Academic All-American Player of the Year.\nIn 2007, the Missouri Valley Conference (MVC) named Jensen as one of the 35 greatest players in conference history, listing her on the MVC women's basketball All-Centennial Team as part of the conference's 100th anniversary.\nProfessional career.\nFollowing her Drake career, Jensen played professional basketball in Europe. Playing for BTV-Wuppertal in Germany from 1992 to 1993, she helped the club win the German Club Championship.\nCoaching career.\nDrake.\nAfter her season in Germany, Jensen returned to Drake as a graduate assistant. Jensen joined Bluder's coaching staff following her playing career. Under Bluder and Jensen, Drake reached the Missouri Valley Conference tournament eight times and had five seasons with 20 or more wins. Jensen served as Bluder's first assistant coach and recruiting coordinator at Drake. Bluder and Jensen also worked with Jenni Fitzgerald, who has served as special assistant to the head coach.\nIowa.\nWhen Bluder was offered the head coaching position for Iowa's women's basketball program in 2000, she asked Jensen and Fitzgerald to accompany her at Iowa. Although hesitant because Drake offered her the open head coaching position, Jensen ultimately decided to join Bluder's coaching staff at Iowa.\nIn 2004, she began serving as Iowa's associate head coach. In this role, Jensen serves as Iowa's recruiting coordinator and additionally works with the team's post players. Jensen played a key role in recruiting Megan Gustafson and Caitlin Clark to Iowa. Both players were named All-Americans and would impact the Hawkeyes greatly. Under her tutelage at Iowa, nine post players have been named All-Big Ten players, including Gustafson and Monika Czinano, who also was named an All-American.\nThe Hawkeyes won the Big Ten Tournament in 2022. In March 2023, Jensen received the Women's Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA) Assistant Coach of the Year award for Division I coaches. The Hawkeyes advanced to the national championship game in the 2023 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament, but lost to LSU.\nPersonal life.\nJensen graduated from Drake in 1991 with a degree in public relations and earned a master's degree in higher education in 1996.\nJensen is openly gay, though at one point she considered leaving the Drake program in the 1990s out of fear that coming out would hurt the program. Since coming out, Jensen has stated \"I've just never felt different here or hampered here [at Iowa]\". She is married to Julie Fitzpatrick who is a physical therapist and also a maternal aunt to former University of Iowa basketball player, Kate Martin In 2020, she received the LGBTQ Legacy Leader Award from \"dsm\" Magazine and the One Iowa Leadership Institute.\nIn her local community, Jensen is a leader of the United Way of Johnson County and is also involved with Shelter House, an organization that helps people move past homelessness. For her community volunteering efforts, Drake awarded her the \"Double D\" award, presented to Drake letterwinners for achievements following their graduation from Drake.\nJensen's mother and father died during Iowa's national tournament runs in 2015 and 2023, respectively. Her brother died of a heart attack in February 2020."

        "text": "Lawrence \"Ray\" Hall (sometimes known as Sugar Ray Hall; born June 23, 1962) is an American former college basketball player. He is currently the all-time leader in scoring, free throws made, field goals made and steals for the Canisius Golden Griffins men's basketball. He formerly held various records, including career points, for the ECAC-North Conference (now America East Conference). He led Canisius in scoring and steals all four years. In high school, he was the 1981 co-Western New York player of the year and held the Buffalo Public Schools and Western New York career scoring record. Hall is the most recent NBA draft selection from Canisius. Following his college career, he played professionally, including several years in the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) and World Basketball League (WBL).\nHigh school.\nRay Hall is described as being from a good family in Buffalo's inner city, who acquired the nickname Sugar Ray as a teenager. In 1974, Jo Jo White made two free throws for the Boston Celtics after the clock expired in the game that eliminated the Buffalo Braves from the 1974 NBA playoffs. Hall attempted to pelt White with an apple, but White ducked. White would become Hall's sports agent in 1985. In 1981, Hall established the Buffalo Public Schools career scoring record of 1,794, which was eclipsed by Curtis Aiken on February 8, 1983. Hall's 1981 total was also a Western New York record. That year he was named Western New York boys' basketball co-player of the year (with Lester Rowe) by \"The Buffalo News\". On February 21, 1981, Hall committed to Canisius over Vanderbilt, Michigan, Pittsburgh and Rutgers.\nIn the 1981 Empire State Games open division finals, Hall had a game-high 26 points in the 98–97 gold medal game loss to a New York City team that included Chris Mullin, Tony Bruin, and Sidney Green.\nIn 2009 as \"The Buffalo News\" celebrated 50 years of All-Western New York (WNY) basketball selections, Hall, who was twice an All-WNY first team selection, was a fourth team selection for the All-time All-WNY team.\nCollege.\nHall is the all-time Canisius leader in career points (2,226), field goals made (812), free throws made (602), and steals (219). He also holds the school's freshman season records for points (455) and steals (53). Hall held other Canisius records including single-season steals (65), career games started (115) and single-season minutes per game (36.7, 37.0). He led the team in scoring and steals for all four years. Hall led the team in rebounding as a sophomore. He was selected to the All-ECAC-North Conference (now America East Conference) first team as a junior (1984) and senior (1985) and was the conference Rookie of the Year in 1982. Hall is the most recent Canisius NBA draftee having been selected with the 12 pick of the 5th round by the Utah Jazz a few hours after 4-year teammate Mike Smrek (2nd round, 1st pick) in the 1985 NBA draft. He served as co-captain with Smrek as a senior. Although he no longer holds America East Conference scoring records, Hall formerly held scoring records such as career points — but was surpassed Al McClain's 1980–84 1861 total and Reggie Lewis's 1983–87 2709 total — and free throws made. He was a five-time conference Player of the Week. As a senior, hall led Canisius to its only regular season ECAC-North Conference championship (that it shared with Northeastern). He played both small forward and shooting guard with significant coverage of him going back and forth. Hall was a 1985 NCAA Men's Basketball All-American honorable mention selection by the Associated Press.\nHall played in the 1982 National Sports Festival (later called the U.S. Olympic Festival) for the East team with Andre Williams, Ed Pinckney, Harold Pressley and Rafael Addison. He scored 13 points, including the go-ahead basket, in the July 27 game against the North.\nProfessional.\nAt the Jazz 1985 training camp, Hall was waived in the cut that reduced the roster from 17 to 14. He played for the Wyoming Wildcatters of the CBA for the 1985–86 season, where he was a roommate with 2-time NBA All-Star John Drew after Drew was forced out of the NBA for drug abuse. In August 1986, he was invited back to the October 1986 training camp, and he signed with the team that month. He worked out a lot with Darrell Griffith who had missed the prior season nursing a foot fracture. He only posted a 32 percent field goal percentage in 6 1986 pre-season games, and he was released from the team later that month. \nIn September 1987, Hall was announced as part of a 13-member all-star team of the International Basketball League that did an exhibition tour (including the 1987 PBA/IBA World Challenge Cup) of the Far East from September 12 to 27, that visited Seoul, South Korea and Manila, Philippines. Hall wound up being MVP of the World Challenge Cup. He was a 1988 CBA All-Star, having played as a member of the Charleston Gunners that year. On April 15, he signed with the Youngstown Pride of the World Basketball League (WBL), where he was teammates with his former Co-Player of the Year Rowe. He was among 22 players invited to a May 23–26, 1988, tryout camp for the inaugural Charlotte Hornets roster. That summer he played for Youngstown. Although Hall was invited back, the June 23, 1988 NBA expansion draft, in which the Hornets loaded up on guards, and the related Kelly Tripucka trade, made it less likely that Hall would make the roster. In early August 1988, the Hornets training camp started with 30 players, which was cut to 21 three days later. Hall performed well. Later that August, he played for the Hornets in the 6-game rookie summer league, scoring 17 points in the summer league opener and 27 points in the summer league finale. However, by mid-November he was playing abroad in the 1988 PBA Reinforced Conference and expected to return to the Quad City Thunder of the CBA in December, which he did. In November 1989, he tried out with the Columbus Horizon of the CBA. In February 1990, Hall signed with the Cedar Rapids Silver Bullets of the CBA. In May 1990, he signed with the Erie Wave of the WBL.\nIn November 1992, Hall joined the staff at Niagara County Community College as an assistant coach. Hall resigned in September 1993, but not before participating in his first Gus Macker 3-on-3 Basketball Tournament in Buffalo where he reached the final game that June. In October 1993, he tried out with the Hartford Hellcats of the CBA.\nHall was a selection along with Rickey Williams and Keith Robinson, the inaugural Mr. New York Basketball (1986), among others to the 2009 50th anniversary All-Western New York boys fourth team by \"The Buffalo News\" for his high school career. In 1997, he was inducted into the Canisius Sports Hall of Fame. In 2008, he was inducted into the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame.\n, he had spent over 17 years working for Ingram Micro in Amherst, New York, and had become an avid bowler."

        "text": "In basketball, a rebound is the act of gaining possession of the ball after a missed field goal or free throw. This can happen on offense, when a player recovers the ball after their own or a teammate's missed shot attempt, or on defense when a player recovers the ball after an opponent's missed shot attempt.\nBeginning with the 1981–82 season, the NCAA began officially sponsoring women's basketball. That season, Anne Donovan became the first player to lead NCAA Division I women's basketball in rebounds per game (rpg).\nOnly four players have led NCAA Division I women's basketball in rebounds per game on multiple occasions; Patricia Hoskins (1986–87 and 1988–89) became the first player to accomplish such a feat. She was later joined by Courtney Paris (2005–06 and 2007–08). Judie Lomax (2008–09 and 2009–10), then became the first player to lead Division I in consecutive seasons, and she was immediately followed by Courtney Hurt who replicated the feat in 2010–11 and 2011–12. The most recent player with consecutive rebounding titles is Lauren Gustin in 2022–23 and 2023–24.\nSeason rebounding leaders (per game).\nAll schools are listed with their current athletic brand names, which do not always match those used by a school in the relevant season."

However, for the third place match, if it is played directly before the final, no extra time shall be played and the winner shall be determined by a penalty shoot-out.\nBracket.\nThe specific match-ups involving the third-placed teams depend on which four third-placed teams qualified for the round of 16:\nMarketing.\nThe official emblem was unveiled on 8 April 2024. The vibrant design is inspired by the stunning nature and colour of host nation Colombia as well as the tournament's fundamental role in forging the Future Stars of Football.\nUsing the South American country's unique and iconic Caño Cristales river, nicknamed 'Liquid Rainbow', as the central theme of the design, the tournament emblem also features the yellow, blue and red of the Colombian flag to make it the perfect blended reflection of the tournament hosts and the competition itself."

        "title": "Removal of Indonesia as 2023 FIFA U-20 World Cup hosts",
        "text": " \nThe removal of Indonesia as 2023 FIFA U-20 World Cup hosts was a political controversy that occurred in March 2023, when FIFA, the world governing body of association football, decided to strip Indonesia of its hosting rights for the 2023 FIFA U-20 World Cup, a youth football tournament that was scheduled to take place in May 2023. The decision was made due to the \"current circumstances\" that arose from Indonesia's opposition to Israel's participation in the tournament, citing Indonesia's pro-Palestine stance and lack of diplomatic ties with Israel. FIFA also imposed a financial sanction on the Football Association of Indonesia (PSSI) for breaching its obligations as a host country. The decision was met with disappointment and anger by many Indonesian football fans and players, who had hoped to showcase their country's passion and potential for the sport. Indonesia returned to hosting for the 2023 FIFA U-17 World Cup after Peru pulled out of hosting the event. \nBackground.\nIndonesia was awarded the hosting rights for the 2023 FIFA U-20 World Cup in October 2019, beating bids from Brazil, Peru, and a joint bid from Myanmar and Thailand. It was the first time that Indonesia would host a FIFA tournament, and the second time that Southeast Asia would host the U-20 World Cup, after Malaysia in 1997. The tournament was originally scheduled to take place from 20 May to 12 June 2021, but was postponed to May 2023 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIndonesia planned to use six venues across six provinces for the tournament, namely: Kapten I Wayan Dipta Stadium in Gianyar Regency; Gelora Bung Karno Stadium in Jakarta; Jalak Harupat Stadium in Bandung; Gelora Bung Tomo Stadium in Surabaya; Gelora Sriwijaya Stadium in Palembang; Manahan Stadium in Surakarta. The stadiums were originally scheduled to be completed by December 2020, but were delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nControversy.\nThe controversy over Israel’s participation in the tournament emerged when Israel qualified as one of the five representatives of UEFA, the European football confederation, after finishing second in their group at the 2022 UEFA European Under-19 Championship. Indonesia, which has the largest Muslim population in the world and does not have formal diplomatic relations with Israel, has been a vocal supporter of Palestinian independence and has often criticized Israel’s policies and actions in the region. The issue sparked protests and statements from various local officials and groups in Indonesia, who called for the banning of Israel from the tournament or the withdrawal of Indonesia as the host. Some of them cited the preamble to the Indonesia’s constitution, which states that “the independence is a genuine right of all nations and any form of alien occupation should thus be erased from the earth as not in conformity with humanity and justice”.\nFIFA sanctions.\nAfter Indonesia lost its hosting rights for the U-20 World Cup, FIFA also imposed a provisional restriction on the use of FIFA Forward development funds for PSSI. FIFA Forward is a program that provides financial and technical support for soccer development projects in each member association and confederation. FIFA said it would review the sanction after evaluating Indonesia’s plan to improve its football.\nPSSI chief Erick Thohir said the sanction would affect PSSI's operational needs and reiterated President Joko Widodo’s instruction to transform the sport, including renovating over 20 stadiums. He also said Indonesia could avoid a more severe penalty of being banned from world soccer and that this was more like a yellow card than a red card.\nThe cancellation of the Under-20 World Cup caused anger and disappointment among fans and players in Indonesia. FIFA made the decision after PSSI canceled the draw because the governor of Bali refused to host Israel’s team. In March, protesters marched in Jakarta waving Indonesian and Palestinian flags, stating that Israel should not be allowed to participate.\nOpposition to Israel’s participation.\nSeveral groups and individuals in Indonesia expressed their opposition to Israel’s participation in the FIFA U-20 World Cup, which was originally scheduled to be held in Indonesia from May 20 to June 11, 2023. Indonesia, a Muslim-majority nation of more than 270 million people, does not have formal diplomatic relations with Israel and supports the cause of the Palestinians.\nBali governor’s request.\nOne of the main sources of opposition came from I Wayan Koster, the governor of Bali, one of the six host provinces for the tournament. Koster sent a letter to Indonesia’s sports ministry in early March 2023, requesting that Israel be banned from competing in Bali. He cited the \"humanitarian tragedy\" in Palestine and the \"violation of human rights\" by Israel as reasons for his objection. Koster also stated that the provincial government of Bali refused to allow the Israeli team to play in Bali. His letter sparked a crisis for the Indonesian government, as FIFA postponed the official draw for the tournament, which was supposed to take place in Bali on March 29. After the tournament was moved out of Indonesia, Koster alternated between angrily stating that the Israel-boycott movement was directed by more powerful (unnamed) leaders than himself, and whining that FIFA should have banned Israel from its competitions and resolved things that way.\nPublic protests.\nKoster’s request was supported by some conservative Muslim groups and activists, who staged protests in Indonesia’s capital Jakarta on March 20 and March 29. They carried signs and chanted slogans demanding that the government prevent Israel from participating in the tournament. They also accused FIFA of being biased and unfair in allowing Israel to qualify for the first time. Some protesters also burned Israeli flags and effigies of former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett.\nGovernment response.\nPresident Joko Widodo addressed the nation on March 28, reiterating Indonesia’s support for the Palestinians but also stressing the country’s obligation to follow FIFA regulations. He said that Indonesia had gone through a long bidding process to host the tournament and that it was an honor for the Indonesian people. He also urged Indonesians to respect the spirit of sportsmanship and not mix politics with sports. However, his appeal failed to convince FIFA, which announced on March 29 that it had removed Indonesia as the host of the tournament due to the current circumstances. FIFA also said that sanctions against PSSI were possible.\nGovernors who opposed Israel's participation in the tournament:\nIndonesian politician and member of the People's Representative Council, Fadli Zon accused FIFA for applying double standards that favour Israel, despite the ongoing Israeli–Palestinian conflict that affects Palestinian football. He also referred that double standards with the prohibition of Russia participating in all FIFA competitions due to the occurring Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nAftermath.\nAs the result of the boycott, FIFA imposed sanctions on Indonesia after the chaos in canceling holding the 2023 U-20 World Cup. Indonesia received sanctions in the form of freezing FIFA Forward funds. The tournament itself is moved to Argentina after FIFA revoked Indonesia's host status. The host switch was welcomed by the Israeli U-20 team coach Ofir Haim, who states that \"we will attend to represent Israel with honor\". Three months after the cancellation of FIFA U-20 World Cup, Indonesia also withdrew from hosting the World Beach Games, citing budget reasons. However many suspect that it was again related to Israel's presence in the games as I Wayan Koster reportedly rejected Israeli presence.\nMeanwhile in Indonesia, public anger has mounted on Ganjar Pranowo and I Wayan Koster over the cancellation of the games. One of the national team players, Diego Michiels posted pictures of both governors in his personal Instagram account with the caption of \"Thanks boss, you both rock! Don't forget to take responsibility when we're banned again!\". Another player, Stefano Lilipaly also criticize both governors satirically by writing in his Instagram account with the caption \"gone\" and \"even funnier\". \nGanjar's decision to boycott the games was criticized by Gerindra, as party treasurer Budi Djiwandono expressed the party's disappointment of the cancellation and party spokesman Andre Rosiade states that \"despite our support for Palestine, the U-20 World cup is an indicator of success for our nation\". Hashim Djojohadikusumo called Ganjar a hater of the national team. Echoing his father's views and breaking partisan lines, Mayor of Solo Gibran Rakabuming Raka openly expressed his disappointment to Ganjar Pranowo on Ganjar's decision to boycott the games, citing that everyone had worked hard to prepare for the games from pre-event to post-event, only to be shut down by the boycott. The cancellation hurts Ganjar Pranowo's and PDI-P's electoral chances for the 2024 Indonesian general election as their chances to win had dived down with the indication that Jokowi will switch his support for another candidate. It became more evident on the shift as relationship between Jokowi and Megawati has become more tense after the cancellation of the games. Political analysts believed that the cancellation will bring benefit towards Prabowo Subianto's electability instead. \nEconomically, the cancellation has caused an economic loss of Rp. 3,7 trillion in the form of loss of potential tourism and tax gains according to Minister of Tourism and Creative Economy Sandiaga Uno.\nIn the end with Erick Thohir's lobbying to President of FIFA Gianni Infantino, Indonesia will eventually host the 2023 FIFA U-17 World Cup, taking over from Peru after Peru withdrew from hosting the competition. To prevent from any sort of boycotts happening again, Ganjar Pranowo's social media accounts were flooded by comments asking him to not make any weird comments about the competition and focus solely on his presidential campaign."

        "text": "Blake Pietila (born January 17, 2000) is an American professional ice hockey goaltender for the Cleveland Monsters of the American Hockey League (AHL). He was named to the All-American team during his collegiate career with Michigan Tech in 2023.\nPlaying career.\nAfter beginning his junior career with local Michigan teams, Pietila committed to Michigan Tech along with his twin brother, Logan. Because he wouldn't begin his tenure until the fall of 2019, Pietila continued his junior career in the interim. He joined the Cedar Rapids RoughRiders in 2017, first sharing the net with Jiri Patera. After a mediocre first season, Pietila took control of the cage in his second year and led the RoughRiders to an excellent regular season though they flamed out in the second round.\nOnce he arrived in Houghton, Pietila found himself relegated to spot duty as he acclimated to the college game. He appeared in 6 games as a freshman while Matt Jurusik served as the team's starter. With COVID-19 causing a severe disruption in the country, it was unknown as to whether Pietila would get a chance to win the job as a sophomore. After a delay, the college hockey season began in 2020 and with last season backup, Robbie Beydoun, having transferred to Wisconsin, Pietila was the incumbent in goal but had to battle senior transfer Mark Sinclair for the job. Despite the ongoing Covid problems, Pietila ended up playing the majority of the minutes and posted outstanding numbers for the Huskies. At the end of the season Tech had a chance to earn an NCAA tournament appearance, however, the team ended up losing the last 4 games and were left out of the tournament.\nFor his junior season, Pietila played all but one game and, though his numbers declined slightly, Tech had an even better season. Pietila set a program record with 7 shutouts during the season but his exploits couldn't help the Huskies overcome Minnesota Duluth in the tournament as his team was unable to score. In 2022–23, Michigan Tech had trouble scoring all season. As a result, the team relied even more heavily on Pietila but he up to the challenge. While breaking his program with 10 shutouts during the season, Pietila was named as the CCHA Player of the Year and a first team All-American. He led his team back to the tournament, however, the Huskies were completely dominated by Penn State and set a record for futility by losing 0–8, the largest shutout defeat in NCAA tournament history. Pietila returned for a fifth season and was named as an alternate captain, an exceeding rare honor for a goaltender. While his numbers weren't quite as good as they had been previously, he got stronger as the year went on and led the team back to the NCAA tournament for the third consecutive year. He finished his college career as the all-time leader in wins (76) and shutouts (24) for Michigan Tech.\nAt the conclusion of his collegiate career, Pietila embarked on his professional career to end the 2023–24 season, by signing as an undrafted free agent to an amateur tryout contract with the Cleveland Monsters of the AHL on April 5, 2024."

        "text": "Fredrick White also more commonly and popularly known as Freddie White (1930 – 13 August 2022) was a Ceylonese field hockey player and footballer who also served as the former captain of the Sri Lanka men's national field hockey team. He was known for his exploits in the sport of field hockey. He was regarded as Asia's best field hockey goalkeeper at one time despite the fact that India and Pakistan had ruled world hockey at that time coinciding with his playing career. He was also easily the best player during arguably Sri Lanka's best ever field hockey team and he is also considered as the greatest ever field hockey player to have donned the national jersey of Ceylon. He cemented the reputation as Ceylon's best ever goalkeeper for nearly two decades. His elder brother Duncan White was an Olympic silver medalist in athletics. He permanently resided in Australia after his retirement from field hockey.\nCareer.\nHe made his field hockey debut at the tender age of 18 as a schoolboy against an Indian Olympic hockey team in 1948 and coincidentally his elder brother Duncan White secured Ceylon's first ever Olympic medal in the same year at the London Olympics in men's 400m hurdles. He began playing for the Burgher Recreation Club from 1948 up until 1950. He represented Defence Services in the first National Hockey Championships way back in 1957. He was appointed as the vice-captain of the Ceylon team during their tour of Madras in 1957. He also captained the Colombo HA team at the 1959 National Championships. He later switched to Havelock SC and won Andriesz Shield as well as Pioneer Cup with the club.\nDuring his playing career, he received spotlight from the Indian field hockey fraternity for his notable work as a goalkeeper. He impressed as a goalkeeper during Ceylon's two match home test series against defending Olympic field hockey champions India in 1960 whereas the Indian national field hockey team manager BL Gupta and Indian national captain Leslie Claudius applauded White for his exceptional glovework. Both Gupta and Claudius heaped praise on White and both indicated their firm desire to have Freddie White in their national team as India's first-choice goalkeeper for the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome had White originally been an Indian national.\nSri Lanka's best years in field hockey coincided with the playing career of White which was even highlighted by former Indian veteran hockey player Dhyan Chand who insisted that Ceylon was the world's sixth best team in global field hockey as he made such a critical statement during Ceylon's 1959/60 tour to the Northern part of India. He also joined the Sri Lanka Army in the inter club tournaments in the Annual Hockey Nationals.\nHe also captained Sri Lankan hockey team during the 1966 Asian Games. Sri Lanka endured a tough run at the 1966 Asian Games as they secured a fifth-place finish out of eight teams in the men's field hockey competition where they defeated South Korea 1–0 in the consolation play-off. He retired from the sport in 1967 with last of his assignments as captain of the national side was a two test series against a strong Indian side. During the first test of the two test series, Sri Lanka lost by a margin of 1-0 which is still regarded as the best ever performance by Ceylonese hockey side against India.\nPersonal life.\nHe pursued his primary and secondary education at the Kingswood College, Kandy and at the school he played field hockey, cricket, football and athletics. He emigrated to Australia with his spouse Lavender in 1972 after bidding adieu to sporting career. His close cousin Penny White was the daughter-in-law of former Sri Lankan President J. R. Jayewardene. He died on 13 August 2022 in Perth, Australia due to illness."

        "text": "The Korea Super Rugby league (formally he Korea Rugby League and Korea Spring League) is a semi professional rugby union league based in South Korea. It is run by the Korean Rugby Union. KEPCO Rugby is the reigning champion of the 2022 season. \n2023 season.\nFormat.\nThe season was split into two stages, the first stage will have the four corporate teams face of and the four university league teams face off against each other separately. It will run from March 25th to 8th April. \nThe second stage will be composed of three levels; the Top 4 (level one) and will have Hyundai Glovis, KEPCO Rugby, POSCO Rugby and KAFAC or OK Financial Group Okman. Division 2 (level two) which will be composed of the top two university teams as well as the OK Financial Group Okman or KAFAC. Division 3 (level three) which will be composed of the bottom two university teams and the champion of the Spring Rugby League 2023. The second stage will run from May 6th to May 20th. \nHistory.\nIn 2003 with Japan, South Koreas creates rival, having a much larger player pool and the possible liquidation on Koreas largest club (KEPCO) the South Korean rugby federation decides to merge the corporation and university championships to form a single league: The Korea Rugby League. The announcement was made on the 29th of April 2003 with the championship launching in May that year. With 7 teams with a single round robin format Samsung SDI became inaugural champions of the Korea Rugby League. \nIn 2008 the Korea Rugby League merged with the National Spring League, to for the Korea Spring League. Unfortunately in 2010 Daesim rugby (joined in 2007) filed for bankruptcy causing them to leave the league, POSCO Rugby (formally Pohang Steel) replaced them as the 4th team in the 2010 season.\nIn January 2015, Samsung SDI decided to dissolve its rugby team after record losses from the parent company. Samsung SDI was the backbone of South Korea's national team and was composed of many professional players.\nThe club thus had an annual budget of 1.5 million euros. Its loss caused great difficulty for South Korean rugby, which was then on the verge of disappearance. In December 2015 there was the launch of the Hyundai Glovis. The latter will primarily recruit many players from the missing Samsung SDI rugby team. However it was not enough and the league was suspended for 2 years. \nThe championship returned three years later in 2017 with three teams: KEPCO, POSCO and Hyundai Glovis. KEPCO won its 4th title, the 3rd consecutive. From 2018, the championship renamed back to the Korea Rugby League. \nFrom 2020, South Korean rugby is hit like all of Asia by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Korea Rugby League will be reduced to two games, a semi final and a final since POSCO was forced to forfeit. Hyundai Glovis won its 3rd title.\nIn 2021 Korean Rugby Union President Choi Yoon decides to create a new league: The Korea Super Rugby League.\nThe season takes place over six days, with each club playing six games (regular round trip phase). The numbers of the teams increase to at least 30 players (with the reinforcement of university players) to ensure the smooth running of the championship.\nThe new league will also be able to rely on the mass return from Japan of South Korean internationals such as Na Kwan Young and Chang Yong Heung who signed for KEPCO. \nPresident Choi Yoon announced that the Korea Rugby Union, now with a large budget thanks to nearly 30 major sponsors of major national companies, will issue the package financially in 2023. \nSeason overview.\n2003, 2004 - 7 teams: Samsung SDI, Pohang Steel, KAFAC, Korea University, Yonsei University, Kyung Hee University and Dankook University.\n2005 - 8 teams: Samsung SDI, Pohang Steel, KAFAC, Korea University, Yonsei University, Kyung Hee University and Dankook University, KEPCO.\n2006 - Season not played, to allow the national team to focus on 2007 RWC qualification.\n2007 - 6 teams: Pool A (Daesim, Korea University and Yonsei University) and Pool B (KAFAC, Dankook University and Kyung Hee University).\n2008 - 5 teams: KAFAC, Samsung SDI, KEPCO, Pohang Steel and Daesim.

However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Eastern Kentucky's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons.

The Brisbane Broncos won both encounters.\nIn 2023, the new Dolphins franchise re-ignited the series, with the teams striking a new Battle Medal as the player of the match award, as decided by prominent rugby league commentators.\nResults.\nBroncos vs Crushers.\nThe Brisbane Broncos would meet the South Queensland Crushers just twice in the then ARL-controlled competition. The first meeting at Brisbane's ANZ Stadium came on the night the Super League war broke out in 1995. The long-awaited clash between Brisbane's two teams ended up a bit of a non-event, with the Broncos having a glut of possession to race out to an early 12–0 lead, extending it further in the second half. The Crushers lack of penetration in attack was their ultimate downfall, as they were held scoreless in just their fourth competition fixture.\nThe second match between the teams came over a year later in the 1996 ARL season, with the Broncos again winners, in front of a then competition record crowd of 34,263 at Suncorp Stadium. The Crushers would take an 8–6 lead into halftime, before the Broncos overwhelmed the Crushers in the final ten minutes with three tries.\nDue to the split caused by the Super League war, the two teams would not meet again before the Crushers' ultimate demise in December 1997."

        "text": "In 2017, the Wales national rugby union team's summer tour saw them play test matches against Tonga on 16 June and Samoa on 23 June. The match against Tonga was played in Auckland, New Zealand, due to concerns over the state of Teufaiva Sport Stadium in Nukuʻalofa. Wales won the match 24–6, before beating Samoa 19–17 in Apia. A veteran of the 2009 and 2013 Lions tours but unselected for their 2017 tour to New Zealand, centre Jamie Roberts captained Wales on this tour, which also saw lock Adam Beard make his international debut; Beard went on to play for the Lions on their 2021 tour to South Africa.\nSquad.\nWith head coach Warren Gatland leading the British &amp; Irish Lions on their tour to New Zealand, assisted by Wales attack coach Rob Howley, forwards coach Robin McBryde was named as coach for the tour to Tonga and Samoa, just as he had been in previous Lions years in 2009 and 2013. In December 2016, the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) were reported to have approached Ospreys and Cardiff Blues head coaches Steve Tandy and Danny Wilson, and Scarlets backs coach Stephen Jones about supplementing McBryde's coaching staff. Wilson and Jones were appointed, along with Blues attack coach Matt Sherratt, but Wilson and Jones withdrew before the tour due to club commitments.\nThe Lions squad included 12 senior Wales players, resulting in 12 uncapped players being named in the 32-man squad for the tour, which was captained by centre Jamie Roberts. Ospreys lock Bradley Davies missed the tour due to the impending birth of his second child, while 38-cap veteran hooker Richard Hibbard was also omitted, and prop Gethin Jenkins missed the tour after undergoing knee surgery. Wing Steff Evans' place on the tour was put into doubt when he was sent off in the Scarlets' win over Munster in the Pro12 semi-finals; however, the red card was rescinded and he was cleared to play. Full-back Rhun Williams suffered an ankle injury in the Cardiff Blues' European Champions Cup qualifying match against Stade Français; he was subsequently replaced in the squad by Exeter Chiefs full-back Phil Dollman, only for Dollman to injure his knee in Exeter's win over Wasps in the English Premiership final on 27 May. The Scarlets' Rhys Patchell was called up to the training squad while Dollman's injury was assessed, before Dollman eventually pulled out on 5 June. Forward James King was injured in the Ospreys' loss to Munster in the Pro12 play-off semi-finals and replaced in the squad by Scarlets flanker Aaron Shingler. Shingler's teammates, props Samson Lee (knee) and Rob Evans (hand), and lock Jake Ball (shoulder), also pulled out due to injury; Ball missed the Pro12 final against Munster due to his injury, while Lee and Evans were injured during the match. Evans was replaced in the squad by Ospreys prop Gareth Thomas, while fellow Osprey Rhodri Jones joined the training squad as Lee's injury was assessed, before finally replacing Lee on 5 June. Four of the Wales squad – Tomas Francis, Kristian Dacey, Cory Hill and Gareth Davies – were called up to play for the Lions midway through the tour.\nMatches.\nWales scheduled a two-test tour for summer 2017, in which they would play against Tonga and Samoa. The second match was scheduled for the Samoan capital, Apia, but the facilities in Tonga led World Rugby to name Auckland, New Zealand, as a contingency venue. Renovations of the Teufaiva Sport Stadium in Nukuʻalofa were expected to be completed in June 2017, but not in time for the Wales game. An assessment of the facilities in Tonga took place in December 2016, but with the pitch not yet in place, the WRU met with World Rugby to further discuss the contingency of moving the fixture to New Zealand. In February 2017, the uncertainty over the readiness of the new stadium meant it was confirmed that the game would not be played in Tonga, and in May 2017, the game was officially moved to Auckland, to be played on 16 June, a day earlier than originally scheduled.\nRGC 1404 v Wales.\nAs part of a six-day training camp in North Wales ahead of the tour, Wales played an uncapped friendly against 2016–17 WRU National Cup winners RGC 1404 at Eirias Stadium in Colwyn Bay. Five uncapped players were named in the starting XV: Adam Beard, Seb Davies, Ollie Griffiths, Aled Davies and Keelan Giles. Wales scored 14 tries, including hat-tricks from Cory Allen and Tyler Morgan, braces from Ellis Jenkins, Alex Cuthbert and Thomas Young, and one each from Jamie Roberts and Gareth Anscombe, to claim an 88–19 win.\nTonga v Wales.\nWales' first match on tour was against Tonga, played at Eden Park in Auckland, New Zealand, due to the facilities in Nukuʻalofa not being ready in time for the match. Coach Robin McBryde named three uncapped players in his starting XV – lock Seb Davies, flanker Thomas Young and wing Steff Evans – while a further six were named on the bench. Fly-half Sam Davies opened the scoring with a penalty, before Alex Cuthbert scored the first try of the game midway through the first half, though Davies missed the conversion. Sonatane Takulua responded with a penalty for Tonga, but despite Davies hitting the post with two more kicks, Wales took an 8–3 lead into half-time. Another Takulua penalty three minutes into the second half cut the Tonga deficit to two points, but three more penalties from Sam Davies pushed Wales out to a 17–6 lead before a last-minute penalty try gave them a 24–6 win.\nSamoa v Wales.\nWales' second and final match on tour saw them face Samoa in Apia. The home side had lost 78–0 to New Zealand the previous week, in the second match of a double-header at Eden Park, following Wales' win over Tonga. With Tomas Francis, Kristian Dacey, Cory Hill and Gareth Davies called up to the British &amp; Irish Lions' squad, and Alex Cuthbert injured in the win over Tonga, coach Robin McBryde was forced into making seven changes from that side. Dillon Lewis, Ryan Elias, Rory Thornton and Aled Davies replaced the Lions call-ups, while Cory Allen replaced Cuthbert; Tyler Morgan came in for centre Scott Williams, while Ellis Jenkins took over from openside flanker Thomas Young in the two unforced changes. Meanwhile, Samoa made six changes from the team that lost to New Zealand.\nTen of the Wales team fell ill before the match, and they went behind early thanks to a try from Alapati Leiua, converted by Tusi Pisi, who also kicked a penalty; in response, Sam Davies kicked three penalties for Wales to ensure they went into half-time only a point down. Steff Evans' try just after the break put Wales into the lead for the first time in the match, but Manu Leiataua's try meant the lead lasted just 10 minutes; however, Evans scored another try – his second in as many international appearances – eight minutes from the end to give Wales a 19–17 win, their first in Samoa for 31 years."

        "text": "The 1989 NCAA Division II baseball tournament was the postseason tournament hosted by the NCAA to determine the national champion of baseball among its Division II colleges and universities at the end of the 1989 NCAA Division II baseball season.\nThe final, eight-team double-elimination tournament was played at Paterson Field in Montgomery, Alabama.\nInitially, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo defeated New Haven, 9–5, in the final, claiming the Mustangs' first Division II national title. In 1995, it was found that head coach Steve McFarland funneled money to several players to pay for tuition and housing in the time that he was coach of the team. Cal Poly imposed penalties on itself that meant they would forfeit the 1989 title alongside their status as runner-up in 1993 and third place in 1992, which the NCAA approved. As of 2024, this is the only NCAA Division II championship played without a recognized winner."
