        "text": "Paul Charles Carey (born September 24, 1988) is an American coach and former professional ice hockey center who played in the National Hockey League (NHL). After being drafted by the Colorado Avalanche in the 2007 NHL Entry Draft, Carey also played for the Washington Capitals, New York Rangers, Ottawa Senators, Boston Bruins, and Djurgårdens IF.\nPlaying career.\nCarey was drafted by the Colorado Avalanche in the 5th round, 135th overall, in the 2007 NHL Entry Draft. Carey played two years at the Salisbury School in Connecticut before moving on to compete in the United States Hockey League with the Indiana Ice in the 2007–08 season and was a Rookie of the year finalist, before committing to play for the Boston College Eagles of the Hockey East in his freshman year in the 2008–09 season.\nAfter capturing his first national title with the Eagles in his sophomore year, Carey repeated the feat in his senior year in 2012, scoring the championship winning goal against Ferris State University and earning selection to the Frozen Four All-Tournament team. Carey was subsequently signed by the Avalanche to a two-year entry level contract on April 11, 2012. He was immediately assigned on an amateur try-out to begin his professional career and finish the duration of the season with AHL affiliate, the Lake Erie Monsters. He made his professional debut in a 5–3 victory over the Hamilton Bulldogs on April 13, 2012.\nIn his first full professional season in 2012–13, Carey was an offensive contributor for the Monsters. After scoring his first professional goal and point against the Oklahoma City Barons, on October 13, 2012, Carey played in 72 games to finish fourth amongst Lake Erie players with 19 goals and 41 points. During the season, Carey accounted for the team's longest individual point scoring streak at 8 games.\nDuring the following 2013–14 season, despite a dip in his offensive numbers, Carey received his first NHL recall by the injury depleted Avalanche on March 11, 2014. He made his NHL debut with the Avalanche in a 3–2 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks on March 12.\nCarey was assigned to the Lake Erie Monsters to begin the 2014–15 season. Amongst the top offensive producers on the Monsters, Carey was recalled by the Avalanche on multiple occasions and on February 15, 2015, in his 17th career game he recorded his first NHL point, an assist, in a 5–2 victory over the Arizona Coyotes. On March 2, 2015, Carey was traded by the Avalanche along with Maxime Talbot to his hometown team, the Boston Bruins, in exchange for Jordan Caron and a 6th-round draft pick in 2016.\nOn July 8, 2015, Carey signed as a free agent to a one-year, two-way contract with the Washington Capitals. He scored his first NHL goal on February 6, 2016, against Cory Schneider of the New Jersey Devils while playing in his third game for the Capitals. He was called up a day earlier for the second time of the season by the Capitals from the American Hockey League, where he was playing for the Hershey Bears.\nAfter two seasons within the Capitals organization, Carey left as a free agent to sign a one-year, two-way contract with the New York Rangers on July 1, 2017. After enjoying a solid training camp and pre-season with the Rangers, and with Jesper Fast injured, Carey was named on the opening night roster to begin the 2017–18 season for the first time in his career. Carey was initially a healthy scratch before drawing into the lineup in a depth role. In contributing defensively and showing a two-way game, Carey set career markers of 7 goals and 14 points in 60 games for the Rangers in completing his first full season in the NHL.\nAs a free agent in the following off-season, Carey left the Rangers to sign a one-year, two-way contract with the Ottawa Senators on July 1, 2018. After participating in the Senators 2018 training camp and pre-season, Carey remained on the opening roster for the 2018–19 season. He made his debut in helping the Senators claim their first win of the campaign in a 5–3 decision over the Toronto Maple Leafs on October 6, 2018. Carey was scoreless in 5 games for Ottawa before he was placed on waivers and sent to AHL affiliate, the Belleville Senators, on October 24. After 29 games in Belleville, Carey was traded by Ottawa and acquired for a second time by the Boston Bruins in exchange for Cody Goloubef on January 11, 2019. He was assigned to continue in the AHL with the Providence Bruins. On March 26, Carey signed a two-year, two-way contract extension with the Bruins.\nOn June 14, 2021, Carey signed as a free agent to a one-year contract with Swedish team Djurgårdens IF of the Swedish Hockey League (SHL). In his last professional season in 2021-22, Carey was unable to find his offensive touch in collecting just 4 goals and 12 points through 41 regular season games. He was unable to help prevent Djurgårdens IF from relegation to the HockeyAllsvenskan, going scoreless in 4 playout games.\nCoaching career.\nIn ending his 10 year professional playing career, Carey returned to Boston College, and was added to the coaching staff as an assistant coach during the 2022–23 season on December 2, 2022.

        "title": "List of 1952 Winter Olympics medal winners",
        "text": "The 1952 Winter Olympics, officially known by the International Olympic Committee as the \"VI Olympic Winter Games\", were a multi-sport event held in Oslo, Norway, from February 14–25, 1952. A total of 694 athletes representing 30 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated at the Games in 22 events across 8 disciplines. Of the 30 participating NOCs, Portugal and New Zealand made their Winter Olympic Games debuts in Oslo—neither delegation secured a medal.\nThe Olympic programme changed only slightly from that of the 1948 St. Moritz Olympics, with the addition of women's cross-country skiing, and changes to the alpine skiing line-up where the combined was replaced by the giant slalom. Bandy was held as the sole demonstration event at the Games. Both men and women participated at these Games; aside from cross-country skiing, women also took part in alpine skiing and figure skating. The Games were officially opened by a woman for the first time; Princess Ragnhild of Norway did the honours in the absence of both her father Crown Prince Olav and grandfather King Haakon VII, away in London for the funeral of George VI of the United Kingdom who had died just days before the Games opened.\nA total of 115 athletes won at least one medal at the Games. On home soil, athletes from Norway won sixteen medals, including seven golds, the most of any country at the Games. The United States (eleven medals, four golds) and Finland (nine medals, three golds) finished second and third in the medal table respectively. Athletes from 13 of the 30 participating NOCs won at least one medal; athletes from eight countries won at least one gold. Of the 13 NOCs which won medals, 10 won more than one. Germany made their return to the Olympics after being barred from both the 1948 Winter and Summer Games for their involvement in World War II. As a result of the war, Germany had been divided into two nations, the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG), and the German Democratic Republic. Only the FRG competed at these Games, where they won both the two-man and four-man bobsleigh events by taking advantage of a not-yet implemented rule by the Fédération Internationale de Bobsleigh et de Tobogganing that imposed a weight limit on bobsleigh teams.\nDick Button of the United States successfully defended the Olympic title he won in St. Moritz for men's singles figure skating, in the process becoming the first skater to be unanimously ranked first by judges in every round of an Olympic competition. Finland's Lydia Wideman won the first gold medal awarded in women's cross-country skiing, with Mirja Hietamies and Siiri Rantanen completing an all-Finnish podium in the event. Finland won three of the four golds and eight of the twelve medals on offer in the sport. Hjalmar Andersen was the most successful athlete at the Games, winning three gold medals in speed skating. In two of the three events he won, the 5000 m and 10000 m, he set new Olympic records and won by the largest margins in those events' Olympic history: 11 seconds in the 5000 m and nearly 25 seconds in the 10000 m. Mirl Buchner of Germany also won three medals at the Games, with one silver and two bronzes won in alpine skiing. A total of 18 athletes won more than one medal at the Games. However, only four of them won more than one gold medal: Andersen; Andrea Mead Lawrence of the United States; and Lorenz Nieberl and Andreas Ostler of Germany.\nMultiple medallists.\nAthletes who won multiple medals at these Games are listed below by the number of medals won."

Home games are played at the Gerald Ratner Athletics Center, located on the University of Chicago's campus in Chicago.\nThe team's head coach is currently Mike McGrath.\nTeam history.\nThe Maroons history in basketball dates to the 1893-94 season in which an organized team representing the university played a schedule of games primarily against YMCA opponents. They continued this type of schedule into the following season, both without a head coach. However, during the 1895-96 season the team added a head coach by the name of Horace Butterworth. Butterworth led the Maroons through two winning seasons and finish his tenure with 10 wins and only 4 losses before leaving Chicago to take on the role of athletic director and head baseball coach at Northwestern. The most notable event during the 1895-96 season for the Maroons was being a part of the first five-on-five college basketball game played in United States history. The game was played at Iowa City with the Maroons finishing victorious by a score of 15–12.\nAfter the 1896–97 season, based on a lack of material and disinterest by participants, the university suspended its men's basketball program and promoted the women's program instead. Finally, in 1903 the program was reinstated and, with the Western Conference backing a conference champion, a varsity schedule was developed by athletic director Stagg. Wilfred Childs became the head coach of the Maroons for this newly developed team that finished the season with seven wins and zero losses, beating teams by an average score of 45–11. Childs would coach the Maroons through the 1905–06 season, turning the position over to Joseph Raycroft who would guide the team to four Big Ten Conference championships (then known as the Western Conference), and the 1907, 1908, and 1909 teams were all retroactively named national champions by the Helms Athletic Foundation; his 1909 team was also retroactively named the national champion by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll.\nChampionships.\nBig Ten regular season championships.\n§ – Conference Co-champions\nIndividual honors.\nNaismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\nThe following 4 Maroons have been inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame:"

Queens were beaten 3–2 in 2008 Scottish Cup final by Rangers. County were beaten 3–0 by Dundee United two years later in the 2010 Scottish Cup final.\nPostponement.\nThe game was originally scheduled to be played on 28 November 2010. However the game was postponed at noon the day before the game after consultation with police voicing concerns over weather conditions particularly on the A9. Due to the Scottish football referee strike, the original fixture was scheduled to be officiated by foreign officials. The revised final date was 10 April 2011.\nTV coverage.\nThe match was televised live on BBC Alba.\nMatch summary.\nThe game was played in unseasonally warm conditions with bright sunshine and a good natured atmosphere generated by both sets of fans. An early goal gave County a dream start but it was a nightmare for Queens and in particular goalkeeper David Hutton. Asked to deal with a routine passback by Queens captain David Lilley, a combination or poor decision making and poor ball control on Hutton's part allowed Andrew Barrowman to exert pressure and dispossess him. Barrowman easily rolled the ball into the empty net from one yard in the eighth minute to make the score 1–0 against his former club.\nQueens only exerted pressure in the five-minute period leading up to County's second goal when they forced goalmouth scrambles. However, a swift County counterattack led to a ball from the right wing, with Iain Vigurs scoring from close range in 39 minutes to make it 2–0.\nCounty were deserved winners without having to exert themselves against a Queens side who were easily second best in all departments and short of ideas other than aiming long balls at Derek Holmes."

The match results did not count in the County Championship until 1895, when Hampshire was also admitted. Derbyshire played eleven first-class games including one against MCC.

        "title": "Shea Rowing Center",
        "text": "The C. Bernard Shea Rowing Center is the boathouse for the Princeton University rowing programs. Located on Lake Carnegie in Princeton, New Jersey, the center consists of the Class of 1887 Boathouse and the Richard Ottesen Prentke ‘67 Training Center. The Shea Center was dedicated on October 7, 2000.\nHistory.\nRowing began at Princeton in 1870 with a half-dozen undergraduates and two boats, which the students taught themselves to row on the Delaware and Raritan Canal. By 1874, the Princeton Boating Club had been formed and had obtained a wood-framed boathouse on the canal. But by 1884, the canal had become so busy with steam-powered boat traffic that rowing was forced to cease. Early in the 20th century, former coxswain Howard Russell Butler convinced Andrew Carnegie to create a lake at Princeton. When some lakeside property owners demanded to sell their entire farms, Carnegie balked at providing full financing, Butler and a group of eleven other alumni generously stepped in and purchased over a hundred acres of land, 89 of which were then given to the University. Other alumni gave hundreds of acres of land to the University at the same time. The lake was finally completed in 1906.\nWith a fine body of water on which to compete, rowing began again in 1911. In 1913, the Class of 1887 Boathouse was donated to the University on the occasion of the 25th reunion of the Class; they had been the last class to row on the Canal. The structure initially accommodated only 3 full eights of heavyweight oarsmen.\nAs Princeton added new rowing programs, the building housed heavyweight, lightweight, women’s and lightweight women’s crew programs. There were a number of piecemeal modifications over the years to accommodate the additional athletes, leaving a building that was maze-like and confusing. By 1997, the boathouse was serving more than 160 athletes on a daily basis, and was packed beyond overflowing. Additionally, the building was falling into disrepair. Indeed, a 1996 meeting of the Princeton University Rowing Association (PURA) was punctuated by a window falling out. Subsequent to this meeting, PURA president Dick Prentke ‘67 initiated the effort to work with University to pursue a full-scale renovation and addition.\nPURA turned to architect and former lightweight rower Jeff Peterson ’84 to explore initial concepts for the project. Peterson's firm at that time, Architectural Resources Cambridge, was eventually hired to design the project. After the project, Peterson started Peterson Architects, a firm that focuses primarily on boathouses.\nPURA raised more than $8 million from over 1200 donors for the project, including a $4 million gift by Irene C. Shea in memory of her husband C. Bernard Shea ‘1916. Mr. Shea had been a student when the 1887 Boathouse opened and was a fan of rowing and Princeton.\nConstruction commenced in June 1999. Crews were able to partially occupy the 1887 Boathouse for boat storage in the spring of 2000. The project was completed in time for full occupancy in the fall of 2000.\nAn unusually heavy rainfall in April 2007 caused the water level in Lake Carnegie to rise several feet, flooding Shea Rowing Center and suspending activities for several days. After the flood, the University engaged Peterson Architects to repair the facility and to mitigate potential damage from future floods.\nDesign.\nThe C. Bernard Shea Rowing Center serves as a gateway to the Princeton Campus, the first visible buildings when approaching from the east. The center consists of the original Class of 1887 Boathouse (22,000 s.f.) and the Richard Ottesen Prentke Training Center (13,500 s.f.). To achieve architectural consistency, the newer Prentke Center reiterates the bay spacing, hipped roofs, and tripartite window configurations of the original building. \nThe tower of the 1887 Boathouse is the center's entry and focal point. On its second floor, it features a double-height sky-lit space with mahogany flooring, benches and wainscoting. A gallery extending to the west features historical photographs, overlooks the lake and provides access to shower and locker facilities. The gallery arrives at a grand open-timbered club room with lounge seating, trophy cases, and video facilities. \nThe Prentke Center includes two bays for small boats, and a moving-water rowing tank. In the tank, the broadly arched window evokes the arches of the Washington Street Bridge. The upper level contains three large workout spaces framed with heavy timber trusses. These rooms are finished with mahogany wainscot and athletic rubber flooring.\nAwards.\nThe Shea Rowing Center has won a number of architectural design awards, including a 2005 Boston Society of Architects Honor Award for Design and a 2001 Facility of Merit Award from Athletic Business Magazine. It was also recognized by Boathouse Finder as a building of outstanding “Architectural Achievement.”"

The school's team currently competes in the Big West Conference.\nHistory.\nIn 1978, the Fullerton men's basketball team, coached by Bobby Dye, made it to the Elite 8 in the 1978 NCAA Division I basketball tournament. They were considered the year's Cinderella story as a #7 seed (out of 8). The team defeated University of New Mexico at Tempe, AZ, and then defeated the University of San Francisco before losing to the University of Arkansas in regionals at Albuquerque, New Mexico. Fullerton was led by Greg Bunch, a CSUF Hall of Famer.\nBob Burton was head coach of the Titans men's team starting with the 2003–04 season. In 2008, the team finished the season 24-9, defeated UC Irvine 81-66 in the Big West Conference Championship. They qualified for their second NCAA tournament (first in 30 years), where they faced the (#3) Wisconsin Badgers as a #14 seed in the first round of the NCAA tournament, losing the game 71–58. After the 2013–14 season, Burton resigned on June 22, 2012 after nine seasons. His final record at Fullerton was 155–122.\nDuring the 2012–13 season, interim head coach Andy Newman replaced Burton and guided the Titans to a 14–18 record overall and 6–12 record in the Big West Conference.\nFor the start of the 2013–14 season, Fullerton hired Dedrique Taylor as the team's head coach. Previously, Taylor had been an assistant under coach Herb Sendek at Arizona State University since 2006.

He played for the 1921 Philadelphia Athletics of Major League Baseball (MLB). Listed at and , he batted and threw right-handed.\nBiography.\nFreeman played college baseball and college football at Western State Normal School, now Western Michigan University, and was signed by Connie Mack of the Philadelphia Athletics in 1921. During 1921, his only major league season, Freeman pitched in 18 games (four starts) with the Athletics. He compiled a 1–4 win–loss record with a 7.69 earned run average (ERA) and five strikeouts in 48 innings pitched. His one win was a complete game victory on August 9, as the Athletics defeated the Cleveland Indians, 4–3. Freeman had a .083 batting average (1-for-12), while defensively he made no errors in 19 total chances for a 1.000 fielding percentage.\nIn May 1922, the Athletics sent Freeman to the minor league Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League as part of a multi-player trade. Baseball records show that Freeman played for three different minor league teams during 1922, did not play in 1923, returned in 1924 with the Syracuse Stars of the International League, then finished his professional baseball career with two teams during 1925. He pitched in 80 minor league games, accruing a 20–35 record.\nFreeman went on to coach multiple sports at St. Augustine High School in Kalamazoo, Michigan, from 1925 to 1954, where his basketball teams won five state championship. He then worked in the lumber business. Freeman was inducted to the hall of fame of the Michigan High School Coaches Association in 1965. He was married, with two daughters and a son, and died in January 1970 in Kalamazoo."

        "title": "Slab climbing",
        "text": "Slab climbing is a type of rock climbing where the rock face is at an angle less steep than vertical. It is characterized by balance- and friction-dependent moves on very small holds. It is often not leadable, or climbable from the ground up, unless it has pre-drilled bolts to protect the climb, making most slab climbs either top rope climbing or sport climbing. Special techniques such as smearing are necessary to climb slab. It is a type of face climbing and is distinctly different from crack climbing. Slab climbing is a relatively new area of climbing, having become more popular in the last 30 years, and some of the highest graded routes are currently being realized.\nTechniques.\nSlab climbing is one of the most technically demanding styles of climbing. Unlike overhanging or vertical routes, where strong muscles are very important, slab climbing demands intense concentration and precise foot placement.\nSmearing.\nA central technique used on slab walls is smearing: placing a foot directly on smooth rock where no feature exists. Pressure is applied and the friction between the shoe and the rock allows the climber to move on the wall. Smearing performance depends on a climber's shoe and the type of rock. Sticky rubber shoes increase friction. Smooth rock, such as quartzite, is difficult to smear on, while sandstone or granite is much easier. The angle of the slab also plays a large part in the difficulty of the move. A 60 degree slab is easier to smear on than an 80 degree slab. A good smear also puts as much shoe in contact with the rock as possible. The foot should be kept flat, instead of using just the points of the toes to smear.\nBody placement.\nClimbers must keep their center of gravity directly above their feet in slab climbing. A climber that keeps their weight too close to the wall risks pushing their feet off the wall. This means a climber will often have their hips away from the rock, which is the opposite of traditional climbing technique. A climber’s hands are often used to assist in this positioning by pushing out against the wall.\nMovement.\nSlab climbing requires smooth movement over the rock, instead of long, jerky moves. Short steps should be taken to maintain balance, and the arms should be kept in contact with the rock. Slab climbing almost never has dynamic moves.\nFalls.\nFalling is usually dangerous on slab because of poor protection and the nature of the rock. The climber will often slide or tumble down the rock, instead of dropping through the air. This can cause serious skin injuries. When falling, climbers try to stay upright and slide instead of tumbling.\nTypes of rock.\nRough rock is excellent for slab climbing. Sandstone and granite are both excellent for slab climbing, because the rock provides much friction, making smearing easier. Limestone slab climbs are more difficult, due to the smoothness of the rock, and quartzite slab climbs are even rarer due to the polished nature of the rock."

It came just two years after Wembley hosted the final in 2011, making it the seventh occasion Wembley Stadium (current and old) had hosted the Champions League final. Bayern Munich, who had been runners-up in 2011–12, won by defeating Bundesliga rivals Borussia Dortmund 2–1 via an 89th-minute goal from Arjen Robben. This was Bayern's 10th final, their first European Cup title in 12 years and their fifth overall. This was the first all-German final and the fourth final to feature two teams from the same association, after the finals of 2000, 2003 and 2008.\nThe defending champions, Chelsea, were eliminated in the group stage, becoming the first title holders to leave the competition at this stage. They went on to win the 2013 UEFA Europa League final, and became the first team to win the Europa League while holding the Champions League crown.\nAssociation team allocation.\nA total of 76 teams from 52 of the 53 UEFA member associations participate in the 2012–13 UEFA Champions League (the exception being Liechtenstein, which do not organise a domestic league). The association ranking based on the UEFA country coefficients is used to determine the number of participating teams for each association:\nBecause the winners of the 2011–12 UEFA Champions League, Chelsea, failed to qualify for the 2012–13 UEFA Champions League through their domestic league (finishing sixth in the Premier League), and because of the restriction that no association can have more than four teams playing in the Champions League, Chelsea's entry in the 2012–13 UEFA Champions League as title holders came at the expense of Tottenham Hotspur, the fourth-placed team of the 2011–12 Premier League (who entered the Europa League instead).\nAssociation ranking.\nFor the 2012–13 UEFA Champions League, the associations are allocated places according to their 2011 UEFA country coefficients, which takes into account their performance in European competitions from 2006–07 to 2010–11.\nDistribution.\nTottenham Hotspur were due to enter the Champions League play-off round for non-champions, but instead entered the Europa League because Chelsea won the Champions League the previous season. As this spot in the play-off round was vacated, the following change to the default allocation system was made to compensate:\nTeams.\nLeague positions of the previous season qualified via league position shown in parentheses.

The 32 teams were allocated into four pots based on their 2012 UEFA club coefficients, with the title holders, Chelsea, being placed in Pot 1 automatically. They were drawn into eight groups of four, with the restriction that teams from the same association could not be drawn against each other.\nIn each group, teams played against each other home-and-away in a round-robin format. The matchdays were 18–19 September, 2–3 October, 23–24 October, 6–7 November, 20–21 November and 4–5 December 2012.

For reaching the group stage, UEFA awarded a base fee of €8.6 million. A win in the group was awarded €1 million and a draw was worth €500,000. In addition, UEFA paid teams reaching the first knockout round €3.5 million, each quarter-finalist €3.9 million, €4.9 million for each semi-finalist, €6.5 million for the runners-up and €10.5 million for the winners.\nA large part of the distributed revenue from the UEFA Champions League is linked to the \"market pool\", the distribution of which is determined by the value of the television market in each country. For the 2012–13 season, Juventus, who were eliminated on quarter-finals, earned nearly €65.3 million in total of which €20.5 million was prize money, compared with the €55.0 million earned by Bayern Munich, who won the tournament and was awarded with €35.9 million of prize money."

        "text": "Bewl Valley Sailing Club was a sailing dinghy and windsurfing club that had approximately 920 full members (1,400 capacity), but entered into insolvency administration in 2015 and closed. Its former premises at Bewl Water are now occupied by the site's current tenant, the Markerstudy Group.\nDescription.\nIt was affiliated to the Royal Yachting Association and was a registered RYA Training Centre. The club formerly organised safety boat cover for sailing and windsurfing every Saturday and Sunday throughout the year. The purpose-built water sports club house was leased by Bewl Valley Sailing Club and its facilities are shared with Bewl Bridge Rowing Club and Bewl Canoe Club. In July 2010, the club was awarded £10,000 by Sport England that was to be spent towards purchasing new training dinghies.\nInsolvency.\nOn 16 July 2015 the club went into administration. Previously, on 20 June 2015 the club had issued a notice of intention to appoint an administrator.\nLocation.\nThe former clubhouse is situated at Bewl Water on the north side of the reservoir near Lamberhurst, Kent. Bewl Water has up to 700 acres of sailing area if all of the estuaries and inlets are included. Most members sailed in the 200-250 acre area south of the club house and launch slipways. The surrounding Kent High Weald countryside is part of a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Bewl Water reservoir is the largest stretch of open water in the South East and when full can hold more than 31,000 million litres of water. The reservoir offers one of the few large recreational open spaces in south east England located in a tranquil setting where there is virtually no background traffic noise. It can be accessed from the A21 Its former premises at Bewl Water are now occupied by the site's current tenant, the Markerstudy Group.\nHistory.\nBewl Valley Sailing Club was founded in 1967 but no sailing took place until 1977 due to Bewl Water reservoir being under construction, lined with clay and then filled from the River Medway and local bore holes. In 2008, the Mariners of Bewl (MOB), an integrated sailing club for the physically disabled and able bodied elected to combine with Bewl Valley Sailing Club.\nClub racing and open events.\nThere was organised fleet racing on Sundays for Lasers, Solos and Flying Fifteens in addition to Slow and Fast Handicap fleets. Other classes of boats regularly sailed at the club included the RS400, Topper, Optimist and Enterprise dinghies.\nBewl Valley Sailing Club hosted a number of inland open meetings each year including events for Solos, Phantoms, Comets, Laser 2000s, Laser Vagos, Wanderers, Flying Fifteens and the London Windsurf Association. \nGeneral sailing.\nIn addition to general sailing on Saturdays and Sundays, the club was open on Wednesday evenings from May to August and on each of the four summer Bank Holiday Mondays. During the month of August, the club house was open every day and safety boat cover was provided, except during Youth Week during which there was no club sailing for ordinary members. Members also organised Away Cruises on tidal waters such as to Bradwell in Essex. The Midweekers, an informal group of members met each Wednesday to sail or take part in another outdoor activity. \nSocial events.\nFamily week ran for more than 20 years. The event was organised voluntarily by club members and offers a full programme of water and land based activities including evening entertainment in the club house. Each summer some 250 family members camped onsite during the first week of the school holidays at the end of July (22–28 July 2012). The club held two camping weekends during 2012 (4–7 May &amp; 25–27 May). In addition the club held its annual Family open day on Saturday 21 July 2012, when there were to be opportunities to \"have a go\" at Windsurfing &amp; Sailing. "

        "title": "Venues of the 1992 Winter Olympics",
        "text": "For the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France, a total of thirteen sports venues were used. Val-d'Isère has been part of the Alpine Skiing World Cup since the late 1960s while Tignes served as host of the first Freestyle World Ski Championships in 1986. Most of the venues used were constructed between 1987 and mid 1990 with the test events taking place in late 1990 and early 1991. It was the last Winter Olympics with an outdoor speed skating rink which led to weather issues for three of the ten events. Three cross-country skiing events were run in snowstorms while the men's 20 km biathlon was found to be too short. The downhill events in alpine skiing were criticized for being too steep. Freestyle skiing made its official debut at these games with the men's winner being stormed after his win while the women's winner won her event in a snow storm. La Plagne hosted the skeleton World Championships in 1993 while Val-d'Isère hosted the Alpine World Ski Championships in 2009.Some of the venues will be used again during the 2030 Winter Olympics,when the main host city will be Nice.\nBefore the Olympics.\nAlbertville is part of the Rhône-Alpes region in France that had hosted the Winter Olympics twice with Chamonix in 1924 and Grenoble in 1968. Jean-Claude Killy, the triple gold medalist in the men's alpine skiing event at the 1968 Grenoble Games, had become a successful businessman when he suggested the idea of the 1992 Winter Olympics in December 1981 to Michel Barnier, a politician in the Savoie department. A proposal was sent to the Albertville town council six months later, followed regional studies done during 1983-5. Presentation and media operations for the bid took place from 1983 to its awarding in 1986 by the International Olympic Committee. After five rounds of voting, Albertville was selected 51-25-9 over Sofia, Bulgaria &amp; Falun, Sweden.\nVal-d'Isère had its first alpine skiing World Cup events run in December 1968. The Olympic test held there in December 1990 was won by 1980 Winter Olympics men's downhill gold medalist Leonhard Stock of Austria.\nTignes hosted of the first FIS Freestyle World Ski Championships in February 1986.\nConstruction on most of the venues took place between 1987 and mid 1990 in time for the late 1990 and early 1991 test events.\nDuring the Olympics.\nThis was the last Winter Olympics in which speed skating was held outdoors. As a result, weather played a factor in three of the ten events run. In the women's 500 m on 10 February, the start of the event was delayed one hour the let the outdoor oval ice harden. Warm weather delayed the women's 1,500 m event for an hour on the 12th. The following day, the men's 5,000 m event was held in a steady rain. Norway's Geir Karlstad, the gold medalist in the men's 5000 m, commented in the post race press conference that \"I didn't like soft ice up to now, but now I do\". This led to the International Skating Union passing a rule after the 1992 Winter Games stating that all Olympic speed skating competitions should be held indoors which it has been since the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer.\nFor the alpine skiing downhill courses, complaints were given that the courses were too steep. On the men's side, the complaints from downhill skiers that it was more like a super giant slalom course rather than a classical downhill course. The women's course was long and had the steepest vertical drop ever at . Further making the women's downhill a challenge was an impending snowstorm that forced race officials to move up the start time and send the skiers out at shorter-than-usual intervals. An intermittent fog also set in during the women's downhill.\nCross-country skiing had snowstorm in the men's 10 km, men's 10 km + 15 km combined pursuit, and women's 5 km events. Meanwhile, the course of the biathlon men's 20 km individual event was found to be too short.\nThe men's freestyle skiing event had France's Edgar Grospiron as its winner. Grospiron's fan broke through the security fence that lined the course to embrace the champion and hoist Grospiron on their shoulders. Meanwhile, the women's event was won by Donna Weinbrecht of the United States while skiing to an accompaniment of The Ramones' \"Rock 'n' Roll High School\" in a snowstorm.\nAfter the Olympics.\nLa Plagne hosted the skeleton part of the FIBT World Championships in 1993. The venue was part of Annecy's unsuccessful bid for the 2018 Winter Olympics in July 2011. If selected, La Plagne would have hosted the bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton events.\nVal-d'Isère hosted the FIS Alpine World Ski Championships in 2009. The venue continues to host be a host of the annual FIS Alpine Ski World Cup.\nThe speed skating venue was converted into an athletics and football venue after the Olympics. Olympic Hall is in use for ice hockey and figure skating as of 2010. The ceremonial stadium was removed following the 1992 Winter Olympics though the monument that was at the ceremony remains as of 2010.\nSome venues will be used again during the 2030 Winter Olympics which Nice will be the main host city."

        "text": "Henry 'Hank' C. McDonald (August 31, 1890 – June 12, 1976) was a professional American football player for the Rochester Jeffersons from 1911 until 1917. He was one of the best known, and possibly the first, black American pro players during the era prior to the formation of the National Football League in 1920. \nEarly life.\nHenry McDonald was born in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, however his biological parents agreed to allow him to be adopted by his father's employer, an American coconut and banana importer. McDonald later recalled that his natural parents realized how great an opportunity it was for him to grow up in the United States. He later saw his mother 55 years later, when he took his family back to Haiti for visit. Henry spent his early childhood in Canandaigua, New York before his family later moved to Rochester. There he became the first black American to graduate from Rochester's East High School.\nPro football.\nMcDonald began playing professional football career in 1911 playing for the Oxford Pros. In his first professional game, McDonald played halfback for the Pros against the Rochester Jeffersons. The Jeffersons' owner and coach Leo Lyons promptly enticed him to play for the Jeffs, after being impressed with McDonald's speed. His ability to run fast earned him the nickname, \"Motorcycle McDonald\". According to McDonald, he could run a 100 yards in 10.2 seconds. The world record at the time for running 100 yards was 10 seconds flat.\nIn 1911, McDonald began his professional football career with the Rochester Jeffersons, who played in the New York Pro Football League. Throughout his professional career, McDonald had a difficult time making ends meet by playing football. He recalled that in all the years he played, that he never once took home more than $15 for one day of football. McDonald added that he had to play two games to get that much. As a result, McDonald often played a morning game in Rochester for the Jeffersons, then took a trolley to Canandaigua and played for the town team in the afternoon. While he did play baseball in the summer to complement his money made playing football, McDonald enjoyed playing halfback, since running backs were the star players and received the most money at the time. During the early 20th century the ball was soft and shaped like a watermelon. Teams would throw a couple of passes every game, but usually as a last resort.\nIncident with Greasy Neale.\nMcDonald recalled only one negative racial incident during his 7 seasons of playing professional football. In 1917, McDonald and the Jeffersons (playing under the guise of the \"Syracuse 47th Infantry\") traveled to Ohio to play the Canton Bulldogs, led by Jim Thorpe. The trouble began when Canton's Greasy Neale threw McDonald out of bounds and snapped, \"Black is black and white is white where I come from and the two don't mix.\" However McDonald, who was also a boxer, stood ready to fight Neale. However Jim Thorpe unexpectedly intervened. Thorpe then stated to Neale \"We're here to play football\". McDonald then recalled that he never had any trouble with Neale or any other Canton player afterwards.\nBaseball.\nHenry also played seven years in baseball's Negro leagues for the Cuban Giants and the Pittsburgh Colored Stars.\nLegacy.\nIn 1990 McDonald was inducted in the inaugural class of the Geneva (New York) Sports Hall of Fame. He was also a charter member of the Black Athlete's Hall of Fame, along with Willie Mays, Jackie Robinson and Jim Brown. In 1937 he was named the head football coach at DeSales High School, making him the first black American to serve as a head high school football coach in New York State. McDonald served as coach at DeSales until 1943. He was also one of the first umpires, when Little League was organized. Geneva's Little League Park is named in his honor."

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball franchise postseason streaks",
        "text": "This is a list of Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise postseason and World Series streaks. The list includes only the modern World Series between the American League (AL) and the National League (NL), not the various 19th-century championship series.\nThe most successful postseason team in MLB history is the New York Yankees, who have achieved three of the four instances of a franchise winning more than two World Series championships in a row (one streak each of durations 3, 4, and 5 seasons) and five of the six instances of a franchise winning the league pennant (i.e., an appearance in the World Series) more than three times in a row (three streaks of 4 seasons and two streaks of 5 seasons). The only other franchises to achieve these milestones are the Oakland Athletics, who won three consecutive championships from 1972 to 1974, and the New York Giants, who won four consecutive pennants from 1921 to 1924. The Yankees also achieved a remarkable run of appearing in 15 of the 18 World Series from 1947 to 1964.\nBeginning in 1969, MLB split into four divisions, and the winners of each competed in the League Championship Series, with the winners advancing to the World Series. When a multi-tier playoff system was implemented in 1995, the LCS remained the series that determined the pennant-winner. The longest streak of consecutive LCS appearances belongs to the Atlanta Braves with 8 in a row from 1991 to 1999 (not counting 1994, when there were no playoffs), while the second-longest belongs to the Houston Astros who have the longest active streak with 7 in a row from 2017 to 2023.\nFurther expansion of the postseason began in 1995, with eight teams entering the playoffs each year (further expanded to ten teams in 2012). In this era, the Braves entered the postseason 14 consecutive years from 1991 to 2005 (again not counting 1994), while the Yankees had a streak of 13 appearances from 1995 to 2007. However, all other postseason appearance streaks of 6 years or more predate the expanded-postseason era and are mentioned above, except for an ongoing 11-year run by the Los Angeles Dodgers (2013–2023).\nWorld Series championship streaks.\nThe Yankees have achieved one streak each of three, four, and five championships in a row, and the Athletics have achieved a streak of three in a row. Back-to-back championships have been achieved an additional ten times. \nNear streaks: Runs during which a franchise won World Series championships at least 70% of the time, with gaps of no more than one year:\nWorld Series appearance (pennant) streaks.\nThe Yankees have achieved five separate streaks of four or five pennants in a row, and the Giants achieved one streak of four in a row. Three pennants in a row have been achieved an additional twelve times, and back-to-back pennants an additional twenty-one times.\nBold indicates a current streak.\nNear streaks: Runs during which a franchise won its league pennant at least 70% of the time, with gaps of no more than one year:\nLeague Championship Series appearance streaks.\nThe Braves appeared in every LCS held from 1991 to 1999, which is eight in a row, winning five league pennants and one World Series championship during that time. The American League record is held by the Houston Astros, who have appeared in the ALCS in seven straight seasons from 2017 to 2023 that has resulted in four pennants and two world titles. They are the only team to appear in an LCS in seven straight completed seasons, as the 90s Braves did not compete in the 1994 NLCS due to the season not being completed. Incidentally, the LCS was the only round preceding the World Series until 1995, when the Division Series was created; the Wild Card Series has acted as the first round for most of the playoff teams on a regular basis since 2022.\nThe Oakland Athletics in their \"Swingin' A's\" era previously held the AL record with five appearances in a row, which saw them win three world titles. The Yankees and Cardinals have each achieved an LCS appearance streak of four in a row. Three LCS appearances in a row have been achieved an additional thirteen times, and back-to-back LCS appearances an additional twenty-two times.\nThree teams (the Orioles, Pirates, and Yankees) achieved multiple LCS appearance streaks in and around the 1970s, each adding up to five appearances in six years.\nThe LCS began in 1969. Before that, the two regular season champions were awarded the pennants and went directly to the World Series.\nBold indicates a current streak.\nNear streaks: Runs during which a franchise appeared in its league championship series at least 70% of the time, with gaps of no more than one year:\nPostseason appearance streaks.\nThe Braves and the Yankees have achieved respective streaks of 14 and 13 consecutive appearances in the postseason, centered on the 1990s and 2000s. The Dodgers have an ongoing streak of 11 consecutive appearances. Five postseason appearances in a row have been achieved an additional seven times, four in a row an additional nine times, three in a row an additional twenty-nine times, and back-to-back postseason appearances an additional fifty-two times.\nRegarding near-streaks, the Yankees appeared in 17 of 18 postseasons from 1995 to 2012, 15 of 18 postseasons from 1947 to 1964 (see pennant near-streaks above), and 7 of 8 postseasons twice, from 1936 to 1943 (see pennant near-streaks above) and 2015 to 2022. The Astros have currently appeared in 8 of 9 postseasons, from 2015 to 2023. In addition, five teams have appeared in postseason near-streaks of 6 (having appeared in 6 of 7 or 8 consecutive postseasons). The Indians (1995 to 2001), St. Louis Cardinals (twice, 2000 to 2006 and 2009 to 2015), and Red Sox (2003 to 2009) appeared in 6 of 7 postseasons, while the Phillies (1976 to 1983) and Angels (2002 to 2009) appeared in 6 of 8 postseasons.\nPostseason appearance streaks have become more common in recent years, as the postseason has been progressively restructured to include more teams (originally two, four since 1969, eight since 1995, ten since 2012, sixteen in 2020, ten in 2021, twelve since 2022). The Astros, who have reached the postseason seven straight times from 2017 to 2023, are the only team to ever win a postseason series in seven straight seasons.\nBold indicates a current streak.\nNear streaks: Runs during which a franchise appeared in the postseason at least 70% of the time, with gaps of no more than one year:\nPostseason series win streaks.\nThe Houston Astros have achieved the longest series win streak of 7 consecutive postseasons, from 2017–present. The Atlanta Braves was the closest team in consecutive seasons with at least one playoff series win, with 5 from 1995–1999. Four consecutive seasons with at least one postseason series win have been achieved twice, three seasons in a row an additional five times, and back-to-back postseason appearances with a series win an additional sixteen times.\nPostseason series wins have become more common in recent years, as the postseason has been progressively restructured to include more teams (originally two, four since 1969, eight since 1995, ten from 2012–2019 and 2021, sixteen in 2020, twelve since 2022). The Astros, who have reached the postseason seven straight times since 2017, is the only team to ever win a postseason series in seven straight seasons.\nBold indicates a current streak since 1995.\nNear streaks: Runs during which a franchise appeared in the postseason and won at least one playoff series at least 70% of the time, with gaps of no more than one year:"

        "text": "Justin Timothy Braun (born February 10, 1987) is an American professional ice hockey player currently under contract with the Straubing Tigers of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL). Braun was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota, and grew up nearby in White Bear Lake, Minnesota. He previously played for the San Jose Sharks, New York Rangers, and the Philadelphia Flyers of the National Hockey League (NHL).\nPlaying career.\nAmateur.\nBraun was born in Vadnais Heights, Minnesota, and began playing ice hockey at the urging of his older brother, Eric. He attended White Bear Lake Area High School in White Bear Lake, Minnesota, making the varsity ice hockey team in his sophomore year. Braun helped lead White Bear to two state tournament appearances, including in 2005, when he served as team captain. After high school, he spent two seasons with the Green Bay Gamblers of the United States Hockey League (USHL), where he scored 13 points (two goals and 11 assists) across 69 games.\nOn May 24, 2006, the University of Massachusetts Amherst announced that Braun and five other players would join the UMass Minutemen ice hockey that fall. He scored his first college point on October 13, 2006, assisting Kevin Jarman in a 3–2 victory over the Sacred Heart Pioneers. His first collegiate goal came on January 27, against Boston University. At the end of the season, Braun was chosen as the Minutemen's Rookie of the Year, with four goals and seven assists, and was named to the Hockey East All-Rookie Team. Braun was selected in the seventh round, 201st overall, of the 2007 NHL Entry Draft by the San Jose Sharks of the National Hockey League (NHL).\nProfessional.\nIn the 2010–11 season, Braun made his NHL debut November 26, 2010 against the Vancouver Canucks. His first point came the next night in a game against the Edmonton Oilers. His first NHL goal was in his fourth game, on December 2, 2010 against Pascal Leclaire of the Ottawa Senators. On October 4, 2013 against the Canucks, Braun scored his first goal since February 21, 2012, an 85-game stretch without a goal.\nAfter completing his ninth season with San Jose in the 2018–19 season, on June 18, 2019, Braun was traded by the Sharks to the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for a 2019 second round draft pick and 2020 third-round selection.\nOn October 5, 2020, Braun opted to forgo free-agency and signed a two-year, $3.6 million contract extension with the Flyers.\nDuring the 2021–22 season, with the Flyers out of playoff contention, Braun was traded to the New York Rangers in exchange for a 2023 third-round selection on March 21, 2022. Adding a dependable veteran presence to the blueline, Braun was a mainstay throughout the playoffs, registering 1 assist in 19 games to help the Rangers reach the Conference Finals.\nAs a free agent from the Rangers, Braun opted to return to former club in the Philadelphia Flyers, signing a one-year, $1 million contract on July 13, 2022. Braun initially announced his retirement from professional ice hockey on April 24, 2023. He appeared in 961 NHL games, recording 199 regular-season and 16 postseason points in the process.\nAfter reconsidering his retirement, Braun opted to extend his playing career in approaching and signing a one-year contract with German club, Straubing Tigers of the DEL on June 27, 2023. \nPersonal life.\nBraun is married to Jessica Lysiak, a private chef, who is the daughter of former NHL All-star Tom Lysiak.

        "text": "Kevin Lawrence Skinner (24 November 1927 – 21 July 2014) was a rugby union player from New Zealand who won 20 full caps for the All Blacks, two of them as captain. He was also a heavyweight boxer, winning the New Zealand championship in 1947.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Dunedin, Skinner was educated at Christian Brothers School, Dunedin and St. Kevin's College, Oamaru where he played in the first XV in 1943 and 1944. He captained the side in the latter year. In 1945 he played senior rugby for the Dunedin Pirates as lock. As a boxer, Skinner won the Otago heavyweight championship in 1946 and won the New Zealand heavyweight title in 1947.\nFirst-class career.\nIn 1947, Skinner played nine matches for the Otago representative rugby union team, including the team's successful Ranfurly Shield challenge against Southland. He also played in the South Island team and represented Otago again in 1948.\nSkinner played for Otago again from 1950 to 1954, and represented Counties in 1956 (from the Waiuku Club). He was in the South Island team each year from 1950 to 1953. He participated in the New Zealand trials in 1948, 1950, 1951 and 1953. He played for a combined Bay of Plenty-Thames Valley-Counties side against the Springboks in 1956.\nAll Blacks.\nSkinner was selected for the 1949 All Black tour of South Africa. He continued playing for the All Blacks and was captain in the 1952 series against Australia. However Bob Stuart (also an old boy of St. Kevin's College, Oamaru) was captain of the 1953/4 All Blacks in their tour of Great Britain and France. Skinner also went on that tour and played in 27 games including all five tests. He was one of the key players.\nSkinner retired at the end of the 1954 season after equaling Maurice Brownlie's record of 61 All Black appearances but he played again for the All Blacks for the final two tests against South Africa in 1956, extending the record to 63. Both those tests were won by New Zealand.\nSkinner has been described as \"a skilled lineout No.2, expert rush stopper, strong scrummager and extremely mobile\" and \"one of the very best props New Zealand has produced.\" He was inducted into the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame in 1996.\nDeath.\nSkinner died in Auckland on 21 July 2014. Among those sending their condolences was another rugby-boxer, Sonny Bill Williams."

        "title": "Venues of the 1968 Winter Olympics",
        "text": "For the 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble, France, a total of ten sports venues were used. Most venues were constructed between the 1964 Winter Games in Innsbruck and the 1968 Games. Thawing was an issue for the four-man bobsleigh run. They were limited to only two runs. Thawing also affected the men's 500 m speed skating event. Electronic timing in alpine skiing affected the results of the women's giant slalom event. It gave Canada's Nancy Greene a headache for two days despite her gold medal in the event.\nBefore the Olympics.\nIn 1960, a local paper informed the public in Grenoble that it was making a bid for the 1968 Winter Olympics. They were awarded those games on 28 January 1964 in Innsbruck, the day before the start of the 1964 Winter Olympics. La Patinoire Municipale was constructed in 1963 for the Brûleurs de Loups hockey team. It hosted the European Figure Skating Championships the following year.\nIn 1965, an aggressive construction scheduled was established using Program Evaluation and Review Technique that was used for both venue construction and all of the support systems, including transportation, communications, and public works to ensure all venues were completed in a timely manner. Le Stade de Glace was the last venue completed, having been done so in November 1967.\nAlpe d'Huez hosted the Bobsleigh World Championships in 1967 though the four-man event was cancelled due to warm temperatures causing the ice to melt. This was fixed by adding more refrigeration to the exposed area of the track to reduce melting.\nDuring the Olympics.\nThawing ice affected several events at these games. In the men's 500 m speed skating event, American Terry McDermott drew the last of the 24 pairs on ice that had badly melted despite artificial refrigeration. McDermott tied for silver with Norwegian Magne Thomassen in the event. Thawing also limited the bobsleigh four-man event to two runs.\nBad weather limited the men's single luge event to three runs instead of four. It also affected the women's single luge event, but the three East Germans were disqualified for heating their luge runners illegally. Another event affected by bad weather was the alpine skiing men's slalom event where Austrian Karl Schranz was disqualified for missing two gates during his initial run in fog before he stopped at the 21st gate and demanded a rerun.\nElectronic timekeeping had debuted in alpine skiing at the previous Winter Olympics. Omega and Longines were the official timekeepers of the 1968 Games. The reliability of the timing had athletes on their toes when they completed their performances. The most notable incident of the 1968 Winter Olympics which involved electronic timing took place with the women's alpine skiing giant slalom event. Canada's Nancy Greene had skied a perfect race, but when she turned around to look at the stop clock, the numbers were still moving. It took two or three seconds to correct the stop clock malfunction. Greene thought originally that the officials missed her time, causing her blood pressure to rise to the point that she had a headache for two days. Her margin of victory was 3.24 seconds over France's Annie Famose.\nAfter the Olympics.\nAutrans remains a popular skiing venue, having started in 1896 and continuing to do so as of 2010. Chamrousse is a popular skiing venue. La Patinoire Municipale was renamed \"Halle Clemenceau\" in 2001, the last year the Grenoble Hockey Club played before moving into a new sports arena.\nLe Stade de Glace continues to host sporting events and musical concerts as of 2010. Alpe d'Huez's bobsleigh track is no longer in use, having last run in 1972. Since 1976, the city is a popular mountain stage in the Tour de France. Villard-de-Lans's luge track is no longer in use, but the city remains a tourist attraction."

        "title": "2022 FIFA World Cup qualification",
        "text": "The 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification was the qualifying process which decided the 31 teams that would join hosts Qatar, who received an automatic spot, at the 2022 FIFA World Cup.\nParallel tournaments were organised by FIFA's six confederations. Qualification began on 6 June 2019 with several matches of the AFC zone, the first being between Mongolia and Brunei, and ended on 14 June 2022 with an inter-confederation play-off between Costa Rica and New Zealand. Mongolian player Norjmoogiin Tsedenbal netted the first goal, while the last one was scored by Joel Campbell of Costa Rica. In contrast to previous editions, there was no general preliminary draw, with confederations carrying out separate draws due to their differing timelines. The qualification process suffered numerous postponements from March 2020 onwards due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nQualification process.\nAll FIFA member associations, of which there were 211, were eligible to enter qualification. Qatar, as hosts, qualified automatically for the tournament. However, Qatar was obliged by the AFC to participate in the Asian qualifying stage as the first two rounds also acted as qualification for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup. As Qatar won their group, the fifth-best group runners-up, Lebanon, advanced to the AFC third round instead. For the first time after the initial two tournaments of 1930 and 1934, the World Cup would be hosted by a country whose national team had never played a finals match before. The reigning World Cup champions France also participated in qualifying as normal.\nThe allocation of slots for each confederation was discussed by the FIFA Executive Committee on 30 May 2015 in Zürich after the FIFA Congress. The committee decided that the same allocation used in 2006, 2010, and 2014 would be kept for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments:\nWithdrew or suspended.\nNorth Korea withdrew from the AFC second qualifying round for safety concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOther smaller island states likewise retracted their participation during the World Cup qualification: Saint Lucia, American Samoa, Samoa, Vanuatu and Cook Islands, while Tonga withdrew after the 2022 Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai eruption and tsunami.\nOn 9 December 2019, the World Anti-Doping Agency initially handed Russia a four-year ban from all major international sporting events, after RUSADA was found non-compliant for handing over manipulated lab data to investigators. However, the Russia national team could still enter qualification, as the ban only applied to the World Cup proper as a world championship. The WADA ruling allowed athletes who were not involved in doping or the coverup to compete, but prohibited the use of the Russian flag and anthem at major international sporting events. An appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport was filed, but WADA's decision was upheld though reduced to a two-year ban. The CAS ruling also allowed the name \"Russia\" to be displayed on uniforms if the words \"Neutral Athlete\" or \"Neutral Team\" had equal prominence. If Russia had qualified for the tournament, its players would not have been able to use their country's name alone, flag or anthem at the World Cup, as a result of the nation's two-year ban from world championships and Olympic Games in all sports. On 27 February 2022, after the threat of boycotts by the Czech Republic, Poland and Sweden (the three teams alongside Russia in the UEFA second qualifying round play-off bracket) amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine, FIFA prohibited the Russia national team from playing home matches in Russia; the team would have to play matches behind closed doors at neutral sites. In addition, the team would have been prohibited from competing under the name, flag, or national anthem of Russia, and had to compete under the name \"Football Union of Russia\" (RFU). On 28 February, however, in accordance with a recommendation by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), FIFA suspended the participation of Russia. Poland were subsequently given a walkover for their play-off semi-final match scheduled against Russia. The Russian Football Union announced they would appeal the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Their request for a temporary lift of the ban was rejected on 18 March.\nFormat.\nThe formats of the qualifying competitions depended on each confederation \"(see below)\". Each round was played in either of the following formats:\nTiebreakers.\nIn league format, the ranking of teams in each group was based on the following criteria (regulations Articles 20.4 and 20.6):\nIn cases when teams finishing in the same position across different groups were compared to determine which teams advanced to the next stage, the criteria depended on the competition format and required the approval of FIFA (regulations Article 20.8).\nIn knockout format, the team that had the higher aggregate score over the two legs progressed to the next round. If aggregate scores finish level, then the away goals rule was applied. The away goals rule was again applied after extra time. If no goals were scored during extra time, the tie was decided by penalty shoot-out (regulations Article 20.10).\nConfederation qualification.\nAFC.\nThe opening two rounds of qualifying also served as qualification for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup. Therefore, Qatar, the 2022 FIFA World Cup host, only participated in the first two rounds of qualifying.\nThe qualification structure was as follows:\nCAF.\nCAF announced on 10 July 2019 a reversion to the format used for its 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification competition.\nCONCACAF.\nCONCACAF initially announced on 10 July 2019 a restructured format for the qualifiers of the 2022 FIFA World Cup. However, on 25 June 2020, following FIFA's decision to postpone the September international window because of the pandemic, CONCACAF noted that \"the challenges presented by postponements to the football calendar, and the incomplete FIFA rankings cycle in our confederation, means our current World Cup qualifying process has been compromised and will be changed.\" On 27 July, CONCACAF announced a new qualifying format for the World Cup.\nCONMEBOL.\nThe CONMEBOL Council decided on 24 January 2019 to maintain the same qualification structure used for the previous six tournaments. From October 2020 to March 2022 (previously scheduled for March 2020 to November 2021, but later postponed by the pandemic), all ten CONMEBOL teams played in a league of home-and-away round-robin matches. The top four teams qualified for the World Cup and the fifth-placed team advanced to the inter-confederation play-offs.\nOFC.\nQualifying was expected to begin in September 2020, but the FIFA international window in that month for the OFC was postponed by the pandemic.\nEarlier in July that year, the OFC submitted a proposal to FIFA for the qualifiers in response to the pandemic, intending to organise a group stage in March and June 2021 followed by semi-finals and a final in September and October of that year. After continued delays, by September 2021 the OFC felt it was \"not possible at this time to organise a qualifying competition within the Oceania region\" and it was instead staged in Qatar in March 2022.\nThe qualifying stage was to be a single match on 13 March 2022 between the two lowest-ranked participating OFC nations in the FIFA World Rankings, with the winner advancing to the group stage. Then eight remaining teams were drawn into two groups of four, playing single leg round-robin. The top two teams from each group advanced to a single leg knockout stage. The final winner advanced to the inter-confederation play-offs.\nUEFA.\nThe draw for the first round (group stage) was held in Zürich, Switzerland, on 7 December 2020, 18:00 CET (). However, because of the pandemic, the draw was held as a virtual event without any representatives of member associations present. It was originally planned to be held on 29 November. Earlier on 18 June, the UEFA Executive Committee approved the draw regulations for the qualifying group stage. The 55 teams were seeded into six pots based on the FIFA Men's World Rankings of November 2020, after the league phase of the 2020–21 UEFA Nations League.\nThe qualification format was confirmed by the UEFA Executive Committee during their meeting in Nyon, Switzerland on 4 December 2019. The qualification depended, in part, on results from the 2020–21 UEFA Nations League, although to a lesser degree than UEFA Euro 2020. The structure maintained UEFA's usual 'group stage/playoff stage' structure, with only the specific format of the play-offs amended.\nInter-confederation play-offs.\nThere were two inter-confederation play-offs to determine the final two qualification spots for the finals. They were played in Qatar on 13–14 June 2022.\nTop goalscorers.\nBelow are goalscorer lists for all confederations and the inter-confederation play-offs:"

        "title": "Lomond Roads Cycling Club",
        "text": "Lomond Roads Cycling Club is a cycling club based in Clydebank, Scotland. The club was founded in 1933. Their current clubroom is in the Double L Centre, Jowitt Avenue, Clydebank.\nTeam colours.\nFrom its foundation, the club colours were a yellow and brown combination. They were changed however, in 2003, to yellow and blue. These colours remain to the present day. Before the change of team colours, the last yellow/brown combination consisted of a mainly yellow jersey, with a 1 inch brown band on each sleeve. The shorts were black, with large straight yellow panels on the sides. Later versions of this kit often had the club name printed in large bold lettering on the back of the jerseys and sides of the shorts. The stylised club logo, consisting of a winged wheel was also dropped from the new yellow/blue design, replaced by 4 joined squares, containing the club initials - LRCC.\nActivities.\nSocial rides.\nThe club's main activity is road cycling, but they also organise and participate in some mountain biking events. They invite anyone to their organised weekly social road rides, starting from Kilbowie Roundabout at the junction of Kilbowie Road, and the A82. The club location in Clydebank allows a large variety of runs varying in distance and terrain. From the short runs such as Balloch to the north, and Gourock to the south west, they can range up to the long and demanding runs such as Crianlarich, Ardrossan or Tighnabruaich.\nUntil 2008, some members had complained that the club social ride had been too long and/or intense. This was largely due to the fact most of the club members were enthusiastic racers, and used the club runs as their main training facility. This was discouraging new members from joining the club. However, until then, they did not have a sufficient number of beginner riders to justify organising separate runs.\nBut with a recent increase in popularity of cycling, and increase in new riders, it became possible to introduce a novice run from 2009. This run is normally a lot shorter than the main group's run, with a general rule of this run is that it will be taken at the pace of the least fit rider, so that no-one will be dropped. As the previous novice riders have become fitter, and more novices have joined, they have now introduced an Intermediate run from 2010, for those who feel fitter than novices.\nRacing.\nThe club currently organises the following events for its own members.\nWest Ferry: From the West Ferry railway bridge, along the A8 to Port Glasgow, then back again.\nLuss: From the lay-by on the A82 above Luss, to the Arden roundabout, then back again.\nAs well as internal club events, members have represented the club at a national level, competing in events ranging from local 10 mile time trials to the Bealach Mor cyclosportive and the Fred Whitton Challenge.\nThey don't currently organise open events, but have previously organised the Westwind 10 mile time trial, using the West Ferry course described above. They also organised a road race around the Coulport peninsula, which started and finished just outside Garelochhead, on top of the Whistlefield hill. From 2005, it was named the \"Hugh Dornan Memorial Road Race\" in honour of the popular club member. This was part of Scottish Cycling's Grand Prix Series, then Division 1 Road Race Series, before Scottish Cycling launched the Super-6 series. The last time it was run was on 18 March 2007.\nNational results.\nBealach Mor 2009 \nFred Whitton Challenge 2009 \nIcebreaker Team Time Trial 2010 \nBealach Mor 2010 \nNotable members.\nThe trade unionist Stewart Crawford was an enthusiastic cyclist, and a member of Lomond Roads for a period, before retiring from the sport following a couple of bad accidents."

        "text": "The 1910 Kentucky Derby was the 36th running of the Kentucky Derby. The race took place on May 10, 1910, held at Churchill Downs racecourse in Louisville, Kentucky and was the first year in which the race times were counted in fifths of a second instead of quarters of a second in hopes of having a more accurate race duration time of the horses. The winning horse's name is Donau who was jockeyed by Frederick Herbert. Donau was awarded $4,850, second place horse (Joe Morris) received $700, and third place horse (Fighting Bob) received $300.\nDonau history.\nDonau, the 1910 Kentucky Derby winner, was jockeyed by Frederick Herbert, bred by Col. Milton Young, owned by William Gerst Sr. and trained by George Ham. Donau was breeder, Col. Milton Young's, second Derby winning horse following the 1887 winning horse named Montrose. Donau was purchased at one year old for $350 and sent off to Gerst's Vinehill stables for race preparations. In his second year of racing, Donau placed in the top three thirty five out of forty one races. Once he matured enough for Derby eligibility, he was entered at 3 years old in 1910, ultimately winning the 1910 Kentucky Derby.\n1910 Derby day.\nThe track is about 1.25 miles in length and usually averages about 2 minutes in length, hence the nickname \"the greatest two minutes in sports\". The order in which the horses arrived to the starting gate were as follows: Joe Morris, Donau, Boola Boola, Gallant Pirate, Fighting Bob, John Furlong, and Topland. After the race had begun and the horses were nearing the end of one quarter of a mile, Donau was already in the lead closely followed by Joe Morris and Topland. By the three-quarter of a mile mark, Donau continued to lead the race whilst Joe Morris and Topland were now separated by nearly four feet. Towards the one mile mark, Donau was still ahead, but not by much, with Joe Morris and Fighting Bob on his tail. Over the last quarter of a mile and into the home stretch, Donau was able to hold onto his lead followed by Joe Morris and Fighting Bob who took second and third place respectively."

        "title": "Jake Allen (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Jake Allen (born August 7, 1990) is a Canadian professional ice hockey goaltender for the New Jersey Devils of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was selected in the second round, 34th overall, by the St. Louis Blues in the 2008 NHL Entry Draft and won the Stanley Cup with the Blues in 2019. Allen has also previously played for the Montreal Canadiens.\nEarly life.\nAllen was born in Fredericton, New Brunswick, the son of Kurt and Susan Allen.\nPlaying career.\nAmateur.\nAllen played for the Midget \"AAA\" Canadiens under Kevin Pottle, before being drafted in the third round of the QMJHL draft to the St. John's Fog Devils. After one season with the Fog Devils, Allen was picked to play for the Under-18 World Hockey Championship in Kazan, Russia where he won gold and was named tournament MVP and top goalie. In 2008, the Fog Devils were sold and moved to Montreal, becoming the Montreal Junior Hockey Club. In 2009, Allen represented Canada at the World Junior Ice Hockey Championship in Saskatoon, winning silver after posting 4 wins and 1 subsequent loss in the final to the Americans. Allen was traded to Drummondville after the World Juniors tournament, and posted a record of 18 wins and 3 losses with a save percentage of .933% and 1.75 GAA. He was named the recipient of the Jacques Plante Memorial Trophy as goalie of the year in the QMJHL in 2009–10.\nProfessional.\nSt. Louis Blues.\nOn October 22, 2008, Allen was signed by the St. Louis Blues to an entry-level contract. He made his NHL debut during the playoffs on April 30, 2012, coming in to briefly relieve Brian Elliott late in the Blues' second game against the Los Angeles Kings in the Western Conference semi-finals. During the shortened 2012–13 season, Allen was recalled to the Blues and recorded his first career NHL start and win in a 4–3 overtime victory over the Detroit Red Wings on February 13, 2013. He has scored one goal.\nOn April 17, 2014, Allen was named the Aldege \"Baz\" Bastien Memorial Award winner as the American Hockey League's (AHL) \"Outstanding Goaltender\" for the 2013–14 season.\nOn March 26, 2016, Allen shut out the Washington Capitals to help the Blues break their record for longest stretch without allowing a goal. In the 2015–16 season, he had a 2.35 GAA with a .920 save percentage.\nDuring the 2016–17 season, Allen was pulled four times in six starts during a rough stretch of play, including a poor showing on January 19, where he allowed four goals on 10 shots against the Washington Capitals. Allen did not travel with the team to Winnipeg for the January 21 game against the Winnipeg Jets, and stayed home to be with his newborn daughter. He was scheduled to rejoin the team on January 23, for the remaining two games of the road trip. His play soon rebounded however, and he was named Second Star of the Week on February 13. Allen went 3–0–0 with a 1.00 goals-against average, a .967 save percentage along with his 13th career shutout against the Ottawa Senators (February 7). His two other wins were against the Toronto Maple Leafs (2–1 OT, 31 saves, February 9), and Montreal Canadiens (February 11).\nAllen won the Stanley Cup in 2019 as the backup to rookie Jordan Binnington in the 2019 Stanley Cup playoffs. He had begun the season as the starting goaltender, but after the team dove to last place in the league half way through the season the young rookie was given a shot. While Binnington shone in goal, Allen finished the second half of the season with a pedestrian 5–4–4 record.\nMontreal Canadiens.\nOn September 2, 2020, Allen was traded to the Montreal Canadiens with a 2022 seventh-round pick in exchange for 2020 third-round and seventh-round picks. On October 14, Allen signed a two-year, $5.75 million contract extension with the Canadiens taking him through the 2022–23 season.\nAllen immediately distinguished himself as a backup goaltender to Carey Price, especially during a stretch of the 2020–21 season where Price was unable to play due to a concussion. Allen's performance in net was widely credited with allowing the Canadiens to make the 2021 Stanley Cup playoffs, though Allen did not play during the playoffs themselves following Price's return. It was widely assumed that Allen would be taken by the Seattle Kraken in the 2021 NHL Expansion Draft, as the rules allowed for teams to protect only one goaltender, and Price had a contractual guarantee of such protection. However, Price and Canadiens general manager Marc Bergevin opted to waive Price's contractual guarantee and expose him, allowing them to protect Allen while calculating that Price's age and salary would deter the Kraken from taking him.\nFollowing Price's entering the NHL's Player Assistance Program at the start of the 2021–22 season, Allen was again the Canadiens' starting goaltender. He was generally judged to be performing strongly even as the team struggled to score, notably posting a 45-save shutout in an October 28 game against the San Jose Sharks that represented the Canadiens' first victory in San Jose since November 23, 1999. On January 12, 2022, Allen sustained a groin injury in a game against the Boston Bruins, and it was announced that he would miss eight weeks of the season. He returned to the team for a March 17 game against the Dallas Stars, making several noteworthy saves in a 4–3 overtime loss. Allen made ten more appearances in net with the Canadiens, but was forced to exit an April 9 game against the Toronto Maple Leafs after suffering a lower body injury while attempting to stop a shot by Leafs star forward Auston Matthews. Shortly afterward he called it a \"season from hell.\" As a result of this new groin injury he missed the remainder of the season.\nIn the off-season of 2022, it became clear that Price would at a minimum be unable to play in the 2022–23 season. As a result, Allen, entering the final year of his contract with the Canadiens, became its new starting goaltender. On September 28, general manager Kent Hughes confirmed that he was hoping to negotiate a contract extension with Allen. On October 1, Allen signed a two-year, $7.7 million extension with the Canadiens locking him up until the end of the 2024–25 season. The ensuing season was marked by the ascending profile of Allen's former backup goaltender, Sam Montembeault, who enjoyed success early on in a supporting role before taking over for a stretch of games in January when Allen was injured. Upon Allen's return to the lineup, he and Montembeault largely alternated starts on an equal basis. Allen finished third in Molson Cup voting as the team's most valuable player at the end of the year, behind captain Nick Suzuki and Montembeault.\nThe Canadiens began the 2023–24 season with three goaltenders on the roster, as in addition to Allen and Montembeault, prospect goaltender Cayden Primeau was no longer exempt from waivers and thus could not be sent down to the AHL's Laval Rocket without possibly being lost to another team. This precipitated discussions about one of the three being traded. Allen appeared in 21 games with the Canadiens that season, with a 6–12–3 record and .892 save percentage.\nNew Jersey Devils.\nOn March 8, 2024, Allen was traded to the New Jersey Devils in exchange for a conditional 2025 third-round pick. Allen made his Devils debut on March 14, making 35 saves in a 6–2 victory over the Dallas Stars.\nPersonal life.\nAllen and his wife Shannon have three children.\nAwards and honours.\n "

        "text": "The 2010–11 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University in the 2010–2011 NCAA Division I basketball season. In November, the team played in and won the Charleston Classic tournament. During the February 23 game against the Cincinnati Bearcats, senior Chris Wright injured his hand, and later had surgery that kept him out of the final conference games. Without him, the Hoyas lost in their first game in the 2011 Big East men's basketball tournament. The team ultimately received an at-large invitation as a 6 seed in the 2011 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, where they lost in the second round to VCU. They finished the season 21–11, 10–8 in Big East play.\nPrevious season.\nIn their previous season, the team finished the season 23–11, and 10–8 in Big East play, and advanced to the championship game of the 2010 Big East men's basketball tournament. Sophomore Greg Monroe declined to return, and entered the NBA draft where he was selected by the Detroit Pistons.\nSeason recap.\nAlthough star center Greg Monroe had opted to forego his senior year of college and enter the 2010 National Basketball Association draft after the end of the previous season and reserve guard Stephan Stepka had transferred to James Madison, the Hoyas returned the rest of the core and reserve players of their 2009–10 team. Senior Julian Vaughn and sophomore Hollis Thompson at forward and seniors Austin Freeman and Chris Wright and sophomore Jason Clark at guard all returned as starters or major contributors off the bench. Sophomore Vee Sanford also returned as a reserve guard, sophomore Jerrelle Benimon as a reserve forward, and junior Henry Sims as a reserve center. Freshmen joining the Hoyas for the season included guard Markel Starks, who later would emerge as their point guard, forwards Nate Lubick and Aaron Bowen, and center Moses Ayegba. Freshman guard John Caprio also made the team as a walk-on. Ranked No. 20 in the Associated Press Poll to start the season, Georgetown hoped for another successful campaign in 2010–2011, and to return to the NCAA tournament for the fifth time in six seasons. The Hoyas also hoped for a deeper run in the tournament, which they had exited in the first weekend of play in their last two appearances in 2008 and 2010.\nNon-conference schedule.\nGeorgetown began the season with six straight wins over unranked opponents. In their season opener, at Old Dominion, they broke the Monarchs′ 23-game home winning streak – the fourth-longest active streak in the United States, dating back to January 2009 – behind 19 points by Chris Wright, 18 by Jason Clark, and 17 by Austin Freeman. Following a win in their home opener over Tulane in which Freeman scored 23 points, Jason Clark had a double-double with 17 points and 11 rebounds, and Vee Sanford contributed 10 points off the bench, the Hoyas traveled to Charleston, South Carolina, to take part in the Charleston Classic as its only ranked team. As NASCAR driver and former Hoya player Brendan Gaughan looked on from the stands, they won the opener against Coastal Carolina, with Clark scoring 22 points, Freeman scoring 20, and Chris Wright getting a double-double with 12 points and 12 rebounds. They followed this with a semifinal win over Wofford in which Julian Vaughn had a double-double with 12 points and 10 rebounds, Chris Wright had a game-high 18 points, and Austin Freeman scored 14, and a victory in the final game over North Carolina State to win the tournament. In the championship game, the Hoya starters had a balanced attack against the Wolfpack, with Hollis Thompson scoring a game-high 18 points, Wright 17, Freeman 15, and Clark 14. Ranked No. 16 in the AP Poll, the Hoyas then returned to the Verizon Center, where Freeman tied a school record shared by Mark Tillmon and Darrel Owens by hitting seven three-pointers, going 7-for-9 (77.7%) from three-point range, and scored 32 points in a win over UNC Asheville. Julian Vaughn scored 16 points against the Bulldogs, and Jason Clark had a double-double with 11 points and 10 rebounds.\nWith a record of 6–0, Georgetown next faced its first ranked opponent of the season, unbeaten No. 9 Missouri, in a game at the Sprint Center in Kansas City, Missouri. The Hoyas started strong, hitting seven of their first eight shots to take a 14–9 lead with 16:24 left in the first half. They then went on a 14–4 run to pull out to a 23–13 lead with 11:33 left in the half, and followed with a 9–0 run to stretch their lead to 35–17 with 8:53 left. Missouri followed with an 8–2 run of its own, but at the end of it Georgetown still led 38–25, having shot 15-for-19 (79.0%) from the field. At the half, Georgetown had shot 20-for-28 (71.4%) from the field and still led 54–47, but the Tigers were in the midst of a comeback that continued into the second half and, with 8:25 to left to play in regulation, took their first lead of the game, 77–75, on a three-pointer by junior guard Marcus Denmon. Vee Sanford responded with a three-pointer of his own that put the Hoyas back in front, 78–77, with 7:49 left. Sophomore point guard Michael Dixon scored on a layup to take the lead back for Missouri, and the Tigers moved out to an 85–80 advantage with 4:21 to play. After a Georgetown timeout, Austin Freeman scored five consecutive points on a free throw and two layups to tie the game at 85–85 with 3:35 to go. The teams continued to trade baskets until Dixon sank two free throws with 26 seconds left to give Missouri a 93–89 lead. After Chris Wright also sank two free throws to close to 93–91, Dixon hit the first of two free throws to give Missouri a 94–91 lead with 14.1 seconds remaining in regulation, but missed the second, and Wright responded with a three-pointer with one second left that tied the game at 94–94 and forced overtime. In overtime, the score stood at 98–98 when Georgetown went on a 9–2 run thanks to Jason Clark – who until then had gone 1-for-6 from beyond the three-point line – hitting three straight three-pointers, giving the Hoyas a 107–100 lead with 1:22 remaining, and Georgetown hung on to secure a 111–102 upset overtime win and a 7–0 start for the second consecutive season. Austin Freeman scored 31 points, his second straight game with more than 30 points, while Jason Clark had 26, Chris Wright had a double-double with 21 points and 10 assists, and Henry Sims came off the bench to score 10 points. The Hoyas shot 18-for-18 from the free throw line and hit 15 three-pointers, and their 111 points were the most Missouri had allowed since a 111–56 defeat at the hands of Kansas State on January 3, 1998.\nThe Hoyas returned to the Verizon Center for a win over Utah State in which Chris Wright finished with a game-high 21 points and four steals, and Georgetown improved to 8–0 for the second straight season. By the time they visited Temple five days later, the Hoyas had risen to No. 9 in the AP Poll, but behind a 30-point performance by junior guard Ramone Moore Temple upset Georgetown to give Owls head coach Fran Dunphy his 400th career victory and end the Hoyas′ winning streak despite 15 points by Jason Clark, 14 each by Austin Freeman and Julian Vaughn, and 10 by Chris Wright. Back at the Verizon Center, Georgetown had two easy wins, defeating first Appalachian State and then Loyola of Maryland. Jason Clark finished with 15 points and Austin Freeman with 14 against Appalachian States, while Nate Lubick and Hollis Thompson each scored 11 points and Chris Wright had 12 assists in the game. As two Georgetown students wearing biblical clothing and long false beards held up a \"Free Moses\" sign, freshman center Moses Ayegba – ruled ineligible for Georgetown's first nine games because he had received an airline ticket to the United States from his native Nigeria from a non-family member – made his collegiate debut in the Appalachian State game, scoring two points. Against Loyola six days later, Austin Freeman and Hollis Thompson each scored 14 points, Henry Sims contributed 12, and Chris Wright added 11.\nFalling to No. 15 in the AP Poll by the time of the Loyola game, Georgetown rose again to No. 10 by the time it rounded out its non-conference schedule with a visit to No. 16 Memphis, its second ranked opponent of the season. From the field, the Hoyas shot 52 percent in the first half, 63 percent in the second half, and 57 percent for the game, committing only six turnovers, and emerged as the second-best shooting team in the United States in field goal percentage for the season at 52.5 percent. Georgetown held an early lead, but the game remained close, and Memphis took the lead at 15–14 with 13:30 remaining in the first half. The Tigers extended this to their largest lead of the game, 22–18, with 10:00 until halftime, but the Hoyas regained the advantage at 24–22 with 8:41 to play in the half and never trailed again. Leading 40–36 at halftime, the Hoyas pulled away in the second half, leading 76–59 with 3:37 left in the game and winning 89–69. Austin Freeman led the team with a game-high 24 points, while Chris Wright added 19 and Julian Vaughn had a double-double with 15 points and 10 rebounds.\nConference schedule.\nThe 11–1 Hoyas were back to No. 9 in the AP Poll when they began their Big East season on December 29 with their second straight road game against a ranked opponent, facing No. 15 Notre Dame at South Bend, Indiana. The Hoyas entered the game as the fourth-best three-point-shooting team in the United States, but a strong defensive effort by the underdog Fighting Irish held Georgetown to only 4-for-22 (18.2%) from three-point range and also limited the offensive output of Chris Wright (3 points) and Jason Clark (8 points); Austin Freeman had a 21-point game, but as a team Georgetown shot only 42.6 percent from the field. The Fighting Irish also enjoyed a big advantage from the free-throw line, going 22-for-27 to the Hoyas′ 5-for-9. The game was close for about the first 10 minutes, but then the Fighting Irish went on an 8–0 run that gave them the lead for good at 23–15 with 7:35 left until halftime. In the second half, a 14–2 Fighting Irish run gave Notre Dame a 48–32 lead with 11:55 left in the game. The Hoyas responded with a 9–0 run of their own that closed the gap to 48–41 with 8:16 left, but two Fighting Irish three-pointers followed that pushed their lead to 56–43. A layup and two free throws by Freeman got the Hoyas′ deficit to single digits at 56–47 with 3:53 to play, but Notre Dame then extended its lead again and upset the Hoyas, winning 69–55. It was the first time that Georgetown had lost its Big East opener during John Thompson III's tenure, breaking a 7–0 Georgetown winning streak in conference openers since Thompson's first season with the team 2004–05.\nReturning to Washington to play their first New Year's Day game since 1943, the Hoyas defeated the Big East's weakest team, DePaul, in DePaul's first New Year's Day game since at least 1945 and dealt the Blue Demons their 10th consecutive loss to Georgetown, 15th consecutive loss to a Big East opponent, and 25th consecutive road loss, with Austin Freeman and Jason Clark each scoring 21 points, Chris Wright emerging in the second half from a shooting slump to contribute 17, and Julian Vaughn pulling down 10 rebounds and adding nine points. The season then took its first real downturn. Falling to No. 13 in the AP Poll after the win over DePaul, the Hoyas lost first at Madison Square Garden to St. John's in the last few seconds of a close game in which Hollis Thompson scored 16 points but Clark, Freeman, and Wright combined for only 20, and then at the Verizon Center to West Virginia, with Clark scoring 16 and Freeman 11 but the Mountaineers making up for poor shooting by dominating in offensive rebounds (15–4) and free throw attempts (24–11) and forcing the Hoyas into 18 turnovers.\nDropping to No. 22 in the AP Poll and, at 1–3 in conference play, off to its worst start in the Big East since the 2003–04 season – Craig Esherick′s last as head coach – Georgetown next hosted No. 5 Pittsburgh, the winners of five straight games. The Hoyas never led in the game, and their slumping backcourt of Clark, Freeman, and Wright could not compete with the perimeter shooters of the Panthers. The Hoyas also slumped at the free-throw line, making only 4 of 14 foul shots (28.6%) in the first half – to the boos of the crowd – and 14 of 25 (56.0%) in the game. Freeman and Wright got in early foul trouble, and Pittsburgh jumped out to a 19–9 advantage with 10:54 remaining in the first half and led by double digits for the rest of the game. Wright and Freeman finally began to score in the second half, and Wright led the Hoyas with 14 points, while Julian Vaughn had 13 and Freeman scored 12. Georgetown never went on a run greater than 4–0 until late in the second half, when they scored seven unanswered points to cut Pittsburgh's lead from 18 to 11 points with 5:32 to play, but the Panthers pulled away again and cruised to a 72–57 victory. Although the Hoyas ended the game leading the Big East in field-goal percentage at 50.9%, the loss was Georgetown's third in a row, and left them with a 1–4 Big East record, their worst start in the conference since 1998–99, the season in which John Thompson Jr. had resigned as head coach.\nAfter the Pittsburgh game, the Hoya backcourt pulled out of its slump, and a new winning streak began with victories at Rutgers – the Scarlet Knights' ninth loss in their previous 10 games against Georgetown – and Seton Hall and in a rematch with St. John's at the Verizon Center, dealing each opponent its fifth loss in six games and, in the case of St. John's, extending the Red Storm's string of consecutive road losses against ranked teams to 32, dating back to 2002. Austin Freeman had 25 points and a career-high nine rebounds against Rutgers, 28 points at Seton Hall, and 14 points in the one-sided win over St. John's, while Chris Wright finished with 15 points at Rutgers and 17 at Seton Hall. Jason Clark scored 13 points at Rutgers and 16 against St. John's, while Hollis Thompson contributed 14 points at Seton Hall and 15 against St. John's. Julian Vaughn scored 11 at Seton Hall, and Nate Lubick made his first collegiate start in the St. John's game, committing four turnovers but scoring six points. Georgetown entered the Seton Hall game with the third-highest team field-goal percentage in the United States, at 50.7 percent. The Hoyas dropped to No. 23 in the AP Poll before the Seton Hall game, but climbed to No. 21 in time for the game against St. John's, and the three wins evened their Big East record at 4–4.\nSecond in the United States in team field-goal percentage at 50.8 percent, the Hoyas next traveled to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to face No. 8 Villanova at the Wells Fargo Center. Georgetown fell behind the Wildcats early, trailing 10–5 with 16:24 to play in the first half, but then came back to post a 32–26 lead at halftime. The Hoyas more or less held that lead until the Wildcats began a surge with 2:53 to play and closed to only a 61–60 deficit with 2:08 left. The Hoyas then got the ball to Austin Freeman repeatedly; he made a two-point layup to increase Georgetown's lead to 63–60 with 1:39 left, then, after Villanova sophomore guard Maalik Wayns made two free throws, hit a two-point jumper to extend Georgetown's lead to 65–62. After two more Wayns free throws, a dunk by Nate Lubick, and a layup by Wayns made the score Georgetown 67 Villanova 66, Freeman sank two free throws to secure a 69–66 upset victory for the Hoyas. Freeman went 8-for-8 in free throws and scored 10 of Georgetown's last 12 points on the way to a 30-point game, while Jason Clark scored 10 points, and Julian Vaughn went 7-for-7 from the free-throw line in a 9-point performance.\nWith a winning conference record (5–4) for the first time in the season, Georgetown rose to No. 13 in the AP Poll and returned home to face No. 15 Louisville, the Hoyas′ second ranked conference opponent in two days. Both teams had a lackluster first half; the Hoyas shot 31 percent from the field, the Cardinals shot 26 percent, the teams had a combined 12 turnovers before they scored a combined 12 points (on the way to having 16 turnovers each before the game was over) and at the half the score was Georgetown 22 Louisville 18. In the second half, however, the Georgetown offense came alive; the Hoyas went on a 10–2 run to take a 34–25 lead with 16:31 left to play, but the Cardinals went on a 15–4 run of their own to tie the game at 47–47 with 7:56 remaining. After that, the game remained tight, but the Hoyas shot 13-for-17 (76%) from the field in the second half and hung on to win 72–69, extending their winning streak to five games. Chris Wright, who had not scored a single point in the Villanova game, went 8-for-8 from in free throws and scored a game-high 24 against Louisville, including two free throws with five seconds left to help clinch the victory. Austin Freeman saw his streak of 23 consecutive free throws end but nonetheless had 13 points, and Julian Vaughn added 10. Five days later, the Hoyas stretched their winning streak to six, holding off Providence despite a 43-point game – fifth-highest ever in a Big East game at the time – by Providence senior guard-forward Marshon Brooks. Freeman scored 23 points against the Friars, while Jason Clark contributed 18, Chris Wright added 16, and Julian Vaughn had a double-double with 14 points and a career-high 11 rebounds.\nGeorgetown was No. 11 in the AP Poll and ranked second in the United States in team field goal percentage at 50.5 percent when it went on the road for a game at No. 12 Syracuse, its third ranked conference opponent in four games. The Hoyas got out to a 16–10 lead halfway through the first half, but Syracuse responded with a 13–2 run, and at halftime the Orange led 31–29. Syracuse extended the lead to 37–31, but the Hoyas rallied to pull ahead 39–38. Then a key Syracuse player, senior forward Rick Jackson, went to the bench with four fouls with 14:40 left to play, and the Orange had to play with three freshmen on the court. Georgetown extended its lead to 44–40, but Syracuse overcame Jackson's absence to battle its way back into the lead, and the Orange were ahead 51–47 with 9:00 left in the game. Syracuse clung to its lead until 3:50 was left, when Hollis Thompson sank a three-pointer to tie the game at 55–55 and begin what turned out to be a decisive 9–0 Georgetown run that put the Hoyas ahead 61–55 with 2:08 remaining. Georgetown went on to win 64–56, having held the Orange to 39.6 shooting from the field and 4-for-16 (25%) in three-pointers. It was John Thompson III's first win at the Carrier Dome in six tries, and the Orange's third straight home less, only the third time that had happened in Jim Boeheim′s 35-year tenure as Syracuse's head coach. Four days later, Georgetown extended its winning streak to eight – the Hoyas's longest conference winning streak since the 2006–07 season – and won its 20th game of the season, coming from behind to defeat Marquette at the Verizon Center in a match-up of the two top-shooting teams in the Big East. Austin Freeman injured his ankle with 1:13 left in the first half of the game against the Golden Eagles, but returned in the second half and played through pain to finish with 17 points. Chris Wright had 20 points, and Hollis Thompson pulled down a career-high 13 rebounds.\nIn third place in the Big East and rising to No. 9 in the AP Poll, the Hoyas went on the road to play another ranked team, No. 12 Connecticut, three days later. The Hoyas led 37–36 at the half and 70–69 with 4:01 left in the game, but did not score again as Connecticut finished the game with nine unanswered points, and the Huskies upset the Hoyas 78–70. Chris Wright led the Hoyas with 19 points, while Jason Clark had 13 and Austin Freeman 12, and Hollis Thompson came off the bench to score 10. With their eight-game winning streak broken, the Hoyas visited South Florida and beat the Bulls behind Chris Wright's season-high 26 points, including 8-for-8 from the free-throw line and six free throws in the final 29.7 seconds of play, and 10 points by Jason Clark. It turned out to be Georgetown's last victory of the season.\nGeorgetown had fallen to No. 11 in the AP Poll when its season-ending losing streak began at the Verizon Center with an upset loss to Cincinnati, breaking the Bearcats′ 20-game losing streak on the road to ranked teams that dated back to January 14, 2004. Although Austin Freeman scored 19 points, the Hoyas shot 25 percent from the field as a team, their worst shooting performance since at least the 1996–97 season. Bigger than the loss of the game was the loss of Chris Wright, who left the game with a broken hand with 15:53 left to play. Wright was unable to play – breaking his 93-game collegiate starting streak – when Georgetown hosted No. 17 Syracuse in a rematch with former President Bill Clinton, former Georgetown and National Basketball Association star Alonzo Mourning, and Washington Capitals and Washington Wizards owner Ted Leonsis looking on. Syracuse was ahead for almost the entire first half, finishing with a 9–2 run that gave the Orange a 33–23 lead at halftime. Georgetown battled back in the second half to take a 45–43 lead with 10:00 left to play, but from there Syracuse outscored the Hoyas 15–6 for a 58–51 upset win. Austin Freeman had 16 points and Jason Clark scored 11. With Wright – who had undergone surgery on his hand – still out and the Hoyas falling to No. 17 in the AP Poll, the season ended with a loss at Cincinnati, in which Freeman alone provided most of Georgetown's offense, playing 37 minutes and scoring 21 points. Both teams were shooting only 33 percent from the floor with 10 minutes left to play, and Georgetown, although leading the Big East with a team field goal percentage of 48.5, shot only 32 percent from the field against Cincinnati. Hollis Thompson had 12 points.\nBig East tournament.\nGeorgetown finished the regular season in eighth place in the Big East with a 10–8 conference record. As the number eight seed in the 2011 Big East tournament, the Hoyas earned a bye in the first round. In the second round – now ranked No. 22 in the AP Poll after their season-ending losing streak – they faced the ninth seed, No. 21 Connecticut. Like Georgetown, the Huskies had struggled late in the regular season, losing four of their final five games, but they had defeated 16th-seed DePaul the previous day in the first round of the tournament to advance to face the Hoyas. Chris Wright's injured hand forced him to sit out again. The game was tied at 15–15 halfway through the first half, but with Georgetown in early foul trouble, Connecticut embarked on a 22–7 run to take a 37–22 advantage with 3:36 left in the first half, and the Huskies led 42–30 at halftime. With the Georgetown backcourt shooting a combined 2-for-13 (15.4%), Julian Vaugh held scoreless, and Connecticut junior guard Kemba Walker scoring 28 points, the Huskies cruised through the second half to knock Georgetown out of the tournament with a 79–62 win. Jason Clark led the Hoyas with 23 points, Austin Freeman had 20, and Hollis Thompson scored 10.\nNCAA tournament.\nLosers of four straight, No. 22 Georgetown nonetheless had a 21–10 record that was good enough to earn the Hoyas a bid in the 2011 NCAA tournament, their second consecutive appearance in the tournament and fifth in six seasons. Seeded sixth in the Southwest Region, in the Round of 64 – termed the \"Second Round\" of the tournament that year – they met 11th-seeded VCU, which had lost five of its last eight games prior to the tournament but had defeated USC in the \"First Four\" round to advance to play the Hoyas. Chris Wright finally returned to play, raising hopes that the Hoyas could pull out of their slump and make a run in the tournament, but Wright shot 3-for-13 and finished with only six points. The Hoyas led 19–18 with 7:48 left in the first half, but the Rams then went on a 9–0 run to take a lead they never relinquished. VCU led 35–24 at halftime, and in the second half continued to extend their lead, beginning with a 14–4 run that put them ahead 49–28 with about 15 minutes left to play. Georgetown closed to 49–34 with 13:51 remaining, but never threatened the Rams′ lead. The Hoyas committed 17 turnovers against only six for the Rams, and shot only 5-for-26 (19.2%) from three-point range — with Freeman, Wright, and Clark combining for 0-for-16 in three-point attempts – while VCU made 12 of 25 attempted three-pointers (48.0%). Despite 26 points off the bench by Hollis Thompson and 10 points by Austin Freeman, VCU went on to win 74–56 in a shocking upset, dealing the Hoyas their most lopsided NCAA tournament defeat since an 86–62 loss to Massachusetts in 1996. It was the first time VCU had ever won more than one game in an NCAA tournament, and the Rams went all the way to the Final Four before they were eliminated. For the Hoyas, it was their third straight NCAA tournament elimination in the tournament's first weekend, and the second consecutive year that they had been knocked out in their first game.\nWrap-up.\nStarting all 32 games, Austin Freeman finished the season with a team-leading 17.6 points per game, having shot 47.6 percent from the field and a team-best 87.0 percent from the free-throw line. Chris Wright, who missed three late games because of his hand injury, started in all 29 of his appearances and scored 12.9 points per game – second best on the team – on 41.4 percent shooting from the field and 78.3 percent in free throws. Jason Clark, starting every game, finished with a field-goal percentage of 48.3, a free-throw percentage of 77.0, and 12.0 points per game. Shooting 51.9 percent from three-point range – best on the team – Hollis Thompson appeared in all 32 games, starting 22 of them, and also had a team-best 51.9 percent average in field goals overall and averaged 8.6 points per game. Julian Vaughn, who missed one game but started the other 31, was second-best for the season in field goal percentage at 49.4 and averaged 7.8 points, and he led the Hyas with 6.1 rebounds per game. Other players seeing significant playing time were Jerrelle Benimon, Nate Lubick, and Henry Sims, all of whom played in every game, and Markel Starks, who saw action in 30 games. Lubick started in 13 of his appearances, while Sims started one game.\nAfter the season, a major turnover occurred on Georgetown's roster. Mainstays Austin Freeman, Julian Vaughn, and Chris Wright all graduated in 2011, as did reserve guard Ryan Dougherty. Freeman left after a 129-game collegiate career in which he had started 117 times, shot 49.8 percent from the field, and averaged 13.7 points per game. In his 110 games, 94 of them starts, Wright had averaged 12.4 points per game on 45.9 percent shooting from the field, while Vaughn completed his career after a freshman year at Florida State and three years at Georgetown with a combined 126 games played (95 at Georgetown), 72 starts (65 at Georgetown), and 5.1 points per game with a 52.5 percent field-goal percentage, although during his three years at Georgetown he averaged 5.8 points per game on 52.7 percent shooting. Freeman, Vaughn, and Wright all went undrafted in the 2011 NBA draft; all three played professional basketball overseas and, during a three-day stint with the Dallas Mavericks in March 2013, Wright became the first person to play in the National Basketball Association after being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.\nOn May 19, 2011, sophomore guard Vee Sanford announced that he was transferring to Dayton, where, after fulfilling a requirement to sit out the 2011–12 season, he could begin play with the Flyers in 2012–13 with two years of college eligibility remaining. Sanford became the eleventh Hoya player in six seasons to leave Georgetown prior to the expiration of his college eligibility. Hollis Thompson initially declared for the 2011 NBA draft, indicating that he planned to forego his final two years of college eligibility, but he never hired an agent and instead returned to school to play for Georgetown the following season.\nAlthough among the top-shooting teams in the United States during the season, the Hoyas had finished the year with a five-game losing streak. They clearly missed the injured Chris Wright during that stretch, but their backcourt also slumped in the final games of the year, especially from three-point range, and that had torpedoed their hopes of advancing in both the Big East tournament and the NCAA tournament. The season also ended in a sloppy, off-target performance against VCU, a loss which left Georgetown with no NCAA tournament victories since the first game of the 2008 tournament despite three appearances in four years over that stretch. It continued a troubling pattern established since their Final Four appearance in 2007 of early upsets in the NCAA tournament at the hands of decided underdogs. That pattern would continue the following season.\nThe 2010–11 Hoyas finished with a record of 21–11. In the Top 25 of the AP Poll all season, they finished the year ranked No. 22 – their lowest rank of the year – in a final poll taken on March 7, before their losses in the Big East and NCAA tournaments. Although they had also been in the Coaches Poll Top 25 for almost the entire season, they finished the year unranked in that poll's postseason voting on March 29, which followed the two tournament losses.\nSchedule.\nSource\n!colspan=9 style=| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=| Big East tournament\n!colspan=9 style=| NCAA tournament"

        "text": "The Florida Gators women's golf team represents the University of Florida in the sport of golf. The Lady Gators compete in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Southeastern Conference (SEC). They play their home matches on the Mark Bostick Golf Course on the university's Gainesville, Florida campus, and will be led by third-year coach Emily Glaser in 2014–15. In the forty-five-year history of the Gators women's golf program, the Lady Gators have won nine SEC championships and two NCAA national tournament championships.\nTeam history.\nThe Florida Gators women's golf program originated as an intercollegiate club team under coach Mimi Ryan in 1969. Ryan's Lady Gators were elevated to varsity status in 1972 with the expansion of the Gators women's sports program under former University of Florida athletic director Ray Graves and associate athletic director Ruth Alexander. The University of Florida embraced the challenge of creating a nationally recognized women's sports program, including women's golf, in order to comply with Title IX's federally mandated equal opportunities for women in college sports.\nAs one of the first Florida Gators women's sports teams, the Lady Gators golfers enjoyed almost immediate success in Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) competition. In the Lady Gators' first year as a varsity sports team, Ryan's Gators finished seventh at the AIAW national championship tournament, beginning a streak of nineteen consecutive top-ten finishes in the AIAW and NCAA national championship tournaments. Ryan's golfers finished second in the AIAW national championship tournament in 1978 and 1978.\nThe 1981–1982 school year was the transition year for sponsorship of national championship tournaments for women's college sports in the United States. During 1981–1982, both the AIAW and the NCAA sponsored championships; since 1982, only the NCAA has sponsored championships in women's college sports. The Lady Gators finished third in the last AIAW championship tournament, and fourth in the first NCAA championship tournament in 1982.\nUnder Ryan, the Lady Gators golf program peaked in the mid-1980s, when the women's golf team won two back-to-back NCAA tournament championships in 1985 and 1986. Led by senior Deb Richard in 1985, a Gators team that included Karen Davies, Lisa Stanley, Page Dunlap and Tammy Towles dominated the NCAA tournament field to win the program's first national championship by fifteen shots, and Richard missed winning the NCAA individual championship by a single shot.\nLeading the team of Karen Davies, Lisa Nedoba, Cheryl Morley and Lisa Stanley to its second NCAA national tournament championship eight shots ahead of the runner-up team, junior Page Dunlap won the NCAA individual championship by a single stroke in 1986. For the first time in the history of college women's golf, all five starting members of the 1986 team received All-American honors.\nThe Southeastern Conference sanctioned women's golf as a conference sport in 1980, and the Lady Gators enjoyed immediate success against their SEC competition, winning eight SEC team championships (1981, 1982, 1984, 1986, 1987, 1991, 1995, 2008). Six individual members of the Gators women's golf team have also won eight SEC individual titles, including Lynn Connelly (1981), Deb Richard (1982, 1983, 1984), Karen Davies (1986), Cheryl Morley (1988), Dina Taylor (1995) and Aimee Cho (2003).\nIn 2011, coach Jan Dowling's Lady Gators tied for tenth place at the NCAA national championship tournament. The Gators finished twelfth at the 2012 NCAA national championship tournament.\nIndividual honors.\nAll-American.\nEleven Lady Gators golfers have earned seventeen first-team All-American honors, including Beverley Davis (1976, 1979), Lori Garbacz (1978), Denise Hermida (1979), Laurie Rinker (1980, 1982), Deb Richard (1984, 1985), Laurie Burns (1984), Karen Davies (1986, 1987, 1988), Page Dunlap (1986), Cheryl Morley (1988, 1989), Riko Higashio (1998), and Sandra Gal (2007).\nAll-Southeastern Conference.\nFifteen Florida women's golf team members have received twenty-eight first-team All-SEC honors, including Laurie Rinker (1982), Laurie Burns (1984), Karen Davies (1984, 1985, 1986, 1987), Page Dunlap (1986), Cheryl Morley (1987, 1988, 1989), Lisa Nedoba (1987), Lisa Hackney (1990), Laura Brown (1991), Dina Taylor (1993, 1994, 1995), Sarah Jones (1994), Kimberly Little (1994, 1995), Jeanne-Marie Busuttil (1995, 1996), Riko Higashio (1996, 1997, 1998), Sara Beautell (1997), Aimee \nCho (2003, 2004), and Sandra Gal (2007).\nPlayers Hall of Fame.\nThe National Golf Coaches Association (NGCA) Players Hall of Fame recognizes the greatest women's college golfers; five Lady Gators have been inducted, including Donna Horton White (1987), Suzanne Jackson (1993), Cheryl Morley (2000), Deb Richard (2002) and Page Dunlap (2003).\nLPGA Tour professionals.\nNineteen University of Florida alumnae have qualified as members of the LPGA Tour, including former Lady Gators Sandra Gal, Lori Garbacz, Lisa Hackney Hall, Donna Horton White, Deb Richard and Laurie Rinker.\nCoaching staff.\nEmily Glaser succeeded Dowling as the Lady Gators' head coach position following the 2012 season. The 2014–15 season will be her third. She is supported by assistant coach Janice Olivencia.\nMark Bostick Golf Course.\nThe Gators women's golf team hosts its home matches at the Mark Bostick Golf Course, located on of the university's campus in Gainesville, Florida. The university course was originally designed by noted Scottish golfer and golf course architect Donald Ross in 1921. It was partially redesigned and rebuilt by noted golf architect Bobby Weed as part of a $4 million renovation project in 2001. The renovated course is a 6,701-yard par 70, and the facilities include the Guy Bostick club house and dedicated practice areas for the Gators women's golf team.\nThe course hosts the annual Lady Gator Invitational tournament, and has also served as the site for the NCAA Regional women's tournament."

He previously played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Chicago Blackhawks, San Jose Sharks, Toronto Maple Leafs and the Colorado Avalanche.\nSmith was a member of the Blackhawks 2013 Stanley Cup winning team.\nPlaying career.\nAs a youth, Smith played in the 2001 and 2002 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournaments with the New York Rangers minor ice hockey team.\nSmith graduated from Westminster School in 2006 and played four seasons at Boston College, helping the Eagles win two national championships. While playing for BC, Smith was drafted by the Chicago Blackhawks 169th overall in the sixth round of the 2008 NHL Entry Draft.\nOn October 29, 2010 the Blackhawks recalled Smith from the AHL's Rockford IceHogs to make his NHL debut in a home game against the Edmonton Oilers. He scored his first NHL goal on April 8, 2011 against Jimmy Howard of the Detroit Red Wings. On April 15, 2011, Smith scored 2 goals against the Vancouver Canucks in a 4–3 loss in only his second NHL playoff game.\nOn Sunday, April 24, 2011, during Game 6 of the Western Conference quarterfinals, Smith scored the overtime goal on a rebound against the Vancouver Canucks' goaltender, Roberto Luongo, to force a Game 7 in Vancouver after the Canucks had previously been leading the series 3–0. The Blackhawks ended up losing Game 7 in overtime.\nOn June 17, 2013, Smith was called up to play his first Stanley Cup Finals game, a 2–0 loss to the Boston Bruins, to fill in over the injured Marián Hossa. The Blackhawks won the Cup on June 24, 2013, when they defeated the Bruins in Game 6. On June 27, 2014, the Blackhawks signed him to a two-year contract extension. In the following season, Smith scored four goals in 19 playoff games to help the Blackhawks advance to the Western Conference finals.\nOn March 2, 2015, Smith was traded by the Blackhawks to the San Jose Sharks in exchange for Andrew Desjardins. He scored his first goal with the Sharks the same day in their shutout game against the Montreal Canadiens, but remained for most of the season with the Sharks' AHL affiliate San Jose Barracuda.\nOn February 27, 2016, Smith, Alex Stalock and a conditional 4th round pick in 2018 were traded by the Sharks to the Toronto Maple Leafs in exchange for James Reimer and Jeremy Morin.\nDespite putting up acceptable numbers with the Maple Leafs, Smith was placed on waivers by the team on March 30, 2016. Smith cleared the following day and was assigned to the Toronto Marlies of the AHL. Despite being considered to be favourites to win the Calder Cup, the Marlies were eliminated in the third round of the playoffs, with Smith contributing nine points in their fifteen-game run.\nOn August 16, 2016, he signed a one-year, two-way deal with the Colorado Avalanche, worth $675,000 at the NHL level and $150,000 at the AHL level. Having made the Avalanche opening night roster, Smith made his debut with Colorado to start the 2016–17 season in a 6–5 victory over the Dallas Stars on October 15, 2016. Smith would play in four scoreless games for the Avalanche before being placed on waivers and being claimed by the Toronto Maple Leafs on October 24, 2016. Smith was claimed due to the depth he provided the team on the penalty kill, a position coach Mike Babcock praised him for during his stint the previous season in Toronto.\nIn the 2017–18 season, he won the Calder Cup with the Toronto Marlies, serving as team captain. On June 15, 2018, he signed with Adler Mannheim of the German DEL.\nAfter a second stint with Adler Mannheim, Smith remained in the DEL, agreeing to a one-year contract with EHC München on May 10, 2021.\nPersonal life.\nSmith was born in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and raised in Avon, Connecticut. Smith is the first player born in the state of North Carolina to have his name engraved on the Stanley Cup.\nSmith's younger brother played Division I soccer for William &amp; Mary. His uncle is Canadian conductor Peter Oundjian.\nAwards and honors.\nOn May 2, 2017, Smith agreed to a one-year extension to remain with the Maple Leafs."

It was their sixth season in the County Championship and they won three matches to finish thirteenth in the Championship table.\n1900 season.\nDerbyshire played eighteen games in the County Championship in 1900, two matches against London County and one match against MCC. They also played a match against the touring West Indies.\nThey only won two matches in the County Championship but a higher number of draws brought them up to 13 in the table. The captain for the year was Samuel Hill Wood in his second season as captain.\nWilliam Storer was top scorer, passing Bagshaw's Championship lead by a century against MCC. John Hulme took most wickets overall although Bestwick had more in the Championship. One high-scoring match was against Essex when Levi Wright and William Storer reached 170 and two Essex players scored centuries. Play did not start until three o'clock on the third day. Derbyshire had to play a second innings but declared when Young was out second ball. There was still insufficient time to avoid a draw.\nDerbyshire played a non-status match against the touring West Indies which ended in a draw. The West Indies opening batsman Charles Ollivierre decided to stay in England and joined Derbyshire in a later season once the residence requirements were met.\nThe most significant addition to the Derbyshire squad in the season was Samuel Cadman a valuable all-rounder and eventually coach. Albert Lawton also made his debut and went on to play for the club for many seasons. Other players who made their debut but played only in 1900 were John O'Connor one of the top bowlers for the season, William Foulke better known as an outsize footballer, Hubert Pink and Walter Stubbings. Frank Barrs also played one match in the following season."

        "text": "The 1958 Asian Games, officially known as the Third Asian Games (), was a multi-sport event held in Tokyo, Japan, from 24 May to 1 June 1958. A record total of 1,820 athletes representing 20 Asian National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated in 13 sports divided into 97 events. The tradition of the torch relay was introduced for the first time in the Asian Games, and the Games cauldron was ignited by the first Japanese Olympic gold medallist and the first Asian Olympic champion in an individual event, Mikio Oda.\nAthletes from 16 nations earned medals at the Games, and athletes from 11 of these nations won at least one gold medal. Indian national record holder in 200– and 400 metres, Milkha Singh, won gold medals in both the events and set a new Asian Games record in 400 metres. 1956 Melbourne Olympics silver medallist in 400– and 1500 metres freestyle events, Tsuyoshi Yamanaka, won gold medals in these two events. The Japanese 4×100 metres medley relay team of Keiji Hase (backstroke), Masaru Furukawa (breaststroke), Manabu Koga (freestyle) and Takashi Ishimoto (butterfly) won the gold medal with a time of 4:17.2 and broke the world record.\nA total of 350 medals (112 gold, 112 silver and 126 bronze) were awarded. Only the Republic of China managed to improve its position in the medal table compared to the 1954 Asian Games. The host nation, Japan, topped the medal table for the third consecutive time in the history of the Games, having collected almost 60% of the total gold medals; it also secured the most silver and bronze medals. Competitors from the host of the 1954 Games, the Philippines, won 48 medals (including eight gold) and helped their nation to be seated at the second place on overall medal tally. South Korean athletes improved their total medal count by eight from 1954, earning third spot on the table.\nMedal table.\nThe ranking in this table is consistent with International Olympic Committee convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won (in this context, a nation is an entity represented by a NOC). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next, followed by the number of bronze medals. If nations are still tied, equal ranking is given; they are listed alphabetically by IOC country code.\nThe total number of bronze medals is greater than the total number of gold or silver medals because two bronze medals were awarded per event in three sports: boxing, table tennis and tennis.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

        "text": "The 2010–11 Connecticut Huskies men's basketball team represented the University of Connecticut in the 2010–2011 NCAA Division I basketball season. The Huskies were coached by Jim Calhoun and played their home games at the XL Center in Hartford, Connecticut, and on campus at the Harry A. Gampel Pavilion in Storrs, Connecticut. The Huskies were a member of the Big East Conference. \nThe Huskies entered the year unranked and picked to finish tenth in the Big East. In November, they won the Maui Invitational Tournament for the second time. They finished the Big East regular season in a tie for ninth place at 9–9. Led by Kemba Walker who scored a tournament record 130 points, they became the first school to win five conference tournament games in as many days in claiming their seventh Big East tournament title. By winning the tournament, they were awarded an automatic berth into the 2011 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. They advanced to their fourth Final Four with a 65–63 victory over Arizona and advanced to their third national championship game with a 56–55 victory over Kentucky and beat Butler 53–41 for their first championship since 2004 and third since 1999.\nBefore the season.\nThe Huskies were coming off of a tumultuous 2009–10 season in which they failed to earn a berth in the NCAA tournament for the second time in four years, and amidst an NCAA investigation into alleged recruiting violations involving Nate Miles. As a result of the investigation, assistant coaches Patrick Sellers and Beau Archibald resigned from their positions. Later that summer, Kevin Ollie was hired to take Sellers' role as assistant coach, and Glen Miller was brought on as Director of Basketball Operations, replacing Archibald. Both men have previous links with Jim Calhoun. Ollie played for the Huskies under Calhoun from 1991–95, while Miller was an assistant coach under Calhoun from 1986 until 1992.\nIn addition to the coaching changes, the Huskies also needed to replace three graduating starters: Jerome Dyson, Stanley Robinson and Gavin Edwards. Reserve forward Ater Majok also left the school before the season began.\nPrior to the start of the season, the Huskies were picked by both the Big East coaches and writers to finish tenth in the conference. The team was not ranked in the top 25 in any major national poll, although they did receive votes in the Preseason AP Poll.\nWith regards to individual honors, Kemba Walker was selected to the Preseason All Big East first team, and was named to both the Wooden and Naismith award preseason watchlists.\nRegular season.\nAfter a pair of exhibition games, the Huskies began the regular season with non-conference wins over America East teams, Stony Brook and Vermont. In the win against Vermont, Kemba Walker tied a UConn XL Center record by scoring 42 points.\nThe team next travelled to Hawaii to play in the 2010 Maui Invitational Tournament. They last participated in the tournament in 2005, when they won the championship. To open the current tournament, they played Wichita State. Walker scored 29 of his 31 points in the second in the 83–79 win. The victory meant they would match up with Michigan State, who was ranked No. 2 in the AP poll at the time. Walker scored 30 points, the third straight game that he eclipsed the 30 point mark, as the Huskies won 70–67. In the championship game, the Huskies outscored Kentucky 21–2 at the end of the first half, and defeated the Wildcats, 84–67. Walker, who scored 29 points in the final, was named the tournament's Most Valuable Player. His 90 points was just three points short of the Maui Invitational record. Alex Oriakhi was also named to the all-tournament team.\nPostseason.\nThe Huskies entered the Big East tournament as the No. 9 seed, just missing the cut to earn a First round bye. UConn went on to win five games in five consecutive days to earn the Tournament Championship, and an automatic bid into the NCAA tournament. In the Big East tournament, UConn defeated four teams ranked in the Associated Press Top 25.\nUConn received a No. 3 seed in the NCAA Tournament's West Region. They continued their winning streak all the way to the National Championship, finishing the season with eleven consecutive wins. As a result of having to play 5 games to win their conference tournament, they became the first team in Division I history to play 41 games in a season.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=8 style=| Exhibition\n!colspan=8 style=| Regular Season\n!colspan=9 style=| 2011 Big East tournament\n!colspan=10 style=| 2011 NCAA Tournament"

        "text": "One Day International (ODI) cricket is played between international cricket teams who are Full Members of the International Cricket Council (ICC) as well as the top eight Associate members. Unlike Test matches, ODIs consist of one inning per team, having a limit in the number of overs, currently 50 overs per innings – although in the past this has been 55 or 60 overs. ODI cricket is List-A cricket, so statistics and records set in ODI matches also count in List-A cricket records. The earliest match recognised as an ODI was played between England and Australia in January 1971; since when there have been over 4,000 ODIs played by 28 teams. \nThis is a list of Indian Cricket team's One Day International records. It is based on the List of One Day International cricket records, but concentrates solely on records dealing with the Indian cricket team. India played its first ever ODI in 1974.\nKey.\nSachin used to get practice from Dhoni. Dhoni is the great player and sachin know it by himself. Even Sachin don't know how to hit six. Sachin is famous for dot balls.\nTeam records.\nOverall Record.\nNote: Tied matches considered as half win.\nW/L ratio and win % excluded the matches which ended in No result.\nWinning every match in a series.\nIn a bilateral series winning all matches is referred to as whitewash. First such event occurred when West Indies toured England in 1976. India have recorded 12 such series victories.\nLosing every match in a series.\nIndia have also suffered such whitewash five times.\nTeam scoring records.\nMost runs in an innings.\nThe highest innings total scored in ODIs came in the match between England and Netherlands in June 2022. Playing in the first ODI at Amstelveen in Netherlands, England posted a total of 498/4.

Zimbabwe were dismissed for 35 by Sri Lanka during the third ODI in Sri Lanka's tour of Zimbabwe in April 2004 and USA were dismissed for same score by Nepal in the sixth ODI of the 2020 ICC Cricket World League 2 in Nepal in February 2020. The lowest score in ODI history for India is 50 scored in their final of the 2023 Asia Cup against Sri Lanka, which is the tenth lowest of all time.\nMost runs conceded an innings.\nThe fifth ODI of the 2015 series against the South Africa saw India concede their highest innings total of 438/4.\nFewest runs conceded in an innings.\nThe lowest score conceded by India for a full inning is 50 scored by Sri Lanka in the final of the 2023 Asia Cup.\nMost runs aggregate in a match.\nThe highest match aggregate scored in ODIs came in the match between South Africa and Australia in the fifth ODI of March 2006 series at Wanderers Stadium, Johannesburg when South Africa scored 438/9 in response to Australia's 434/4.

The lowest match aggregate in ODI history for India is 101 scored in the final of the 2023 Asia Cup against India, which is the 8th lowest of all time.\nResult records.\nAn ODI match is won when one side has scored more runs than the total runs scored by the opposing side during their innings. If both sides have completed both their allocated innings and the side that fielded last has the higher aggregate of runs, it is known as a win by runs. This indicates the number of runs that they had scored more than the opposing side. If the side batting last wins the match, it is known as a win by wickets, indicating the number of wickets that were still to fall.\nGreatest win margins (by runs).\nThe greatest winning margin by runs in ODIs is India's victory over Sri Lanks by 317 runs in the third and last ODI of the 2023 ODI series between the two teams.\nGreatest win margins (by balls remaining).\nThe greatest winning margin by balls remaining in ODIs was England's victory over Canada by 8 wickets with 277 balls remaining in the 1979 Cricket World Cup. The largest victory recorded by India, during the 2023 Asia Cup Final against Sri Lanka when they won by 10 wickets with 263 balls remaining, which is the 6th lowest of all time.\nGreatest win margins (by 10 wickets).\nA total of 55 matches have ended with the chasing team winning by 10 wickets with West Indies winning by such margins a record 10 times.

He made 27 dismissals during the 1998-99 Carlton &amp; United Series. Indian record is held by MS Dhoni when he made 21 dismissals during the 2007–08 Commonwealth Bank Series.\nFielding records.\nMost career catches.\nCaught is one of the nine methods a batsman can be dismissed in cricket. The majority of catches are caught in the slips, located behind the batsman, next to the wicket-keeper, on the off side of the field. Most slip fielders are top order batsmen.\nSri Lanka's Mahela Jayawardene holds the record for the most catches in ODIs by a non-wicket-keeper with 218, followed by Ricky Ponting of Australia on 160 and Indian Mohammad Azharuddin with 156.\nMost catches in an innings.\nSouth Africa's Jonty Rhodes is the only fielder to have taken five catches in an innings.\nThe feat of taking 4 catches in an innings has been achieved by 42 fielders on 44 occasions including 7 Indians.\nMost catches in a series.\nThe 2019 Cricket World Cup, which was won by England for the first time, saw the record set for the most catches taken by a non-wicket-keeper in an ODI series.

He broke Richie Richardson's long standing record of 132 matches.\nMost matches as captain.\nRicky Ponting, who led the Australian cricket team from 2002 to 2012, holds the record for the most matches played as captain in ODIs with 230 (including 1 as captain of ICC World XI team).Mahendra Singh Dhoni who led the side for nine years from 2008 to 2017 is third on the list with 200 matches.\nYoungest players on Debut.\nThe youngest player to play in an ODI match is claimed to be Hasan Raza at the age of 14 years and 233 days. Making his debut for Pakistan against Zimbabwe on 30 October 1996, there is some doubt as to the validity of Raza's age at the time. The youngest Indian to play ODIs was Sachin Tendulkar who at the age of 16 years and 238 days debuted in the second ODI of the series against Pakistan in December 1989.\nOldest players on Debut.\nThe Netherlands batsmen Nolan Clarke is the oldest player to appear in an ODI match. Playing in the 1996 Cricket World Cup against New Zealand in 1996 at Reliance Stadium in Vadodara, India he was aged 47 years and 240 days.

Playing in the 1996 Cricket World Cup against South Africa in 1996 at Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium in Rawalpindi, Pakistan he was aged 47 years and 257 days.\nPartnership records.\nIn cricket, two batsmen are always present at the crease batting together in a partnership. This partnership will continue until one of them is dismissed, retires or the innings comes to a close.\nHighest partnerships by wicket.\nA wicket partnership describes the number of runs scored before each wicket falls. The first wicket partnership is between the opening batsmen and continues until the first wicket falls. The second wicket partnership then commences between the not out batsman and the number three batsman. This partnership continues until the second wicket falls. The third wicket partnership then commences between the not out batsman and the new batsman. This continues down to the tenth wicket partnership. When the tenth wicket has fallen, there is no batsman left to partner so the innings is closed.\nHighest partnerships by runs.\nThe highest ODI partnership by runs for any wicket is held by the West Indian pairing of Chris Gayle and Marlon Samuels who put together a second wicket partnership of 372 runs during the 2015 Cricket World Cup against Zimbabwe in February 2015. This broke the record of 331 runs set by Indian pair of Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid against New Zealand in 1999\nUmpiring records.\nMost matches umpired.\nAn umpire in cricket is a person who officiates the match according to the \"Laws of Cricket\". Two umpires adjudicate the match on the field, whilst a third umpire has access to video replays, and a fourth umpire looks after the match balls and other duties. The records below are only for on-field umpires.\nAleem Dar of Pakistan holds the record for the most ODI matches umpired with 211, followed by New Zealand's Billy Bowden who officiated in 200 matches. The most experienced Indian is Srinivas Venkataraghavan who stood in 52 ODI matches."

        "title": "Wimbledon–West Croydon line",
        "text": "The Wimbledon–West Croydon line was a railway line in south London. It was opened in 1855 by the Wimbledon and Croydon Railway (W&amp;CR) over part of the trackbed of the Surrey Iron Railway. It closed in May 1997 and now forms part of the Tramlink network.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe valley of the River Wandle was heavily industrialised in the eighteenth century—the most industrialised in the south of England—and to convey minerals and agricultural products the Surrey Iron Railway was built, opening in 1803; it was a horse-drawn plateway in which the rails were L-shaped in cross-section, guiding ordinary wagon wheels. The Surrey Iron Railway was not successful, however, and after a long period of dormancy it closed in 1846.\nWimbledon became connected by railway to London when the London and Southampton Railway opened in 1838. The following year Croydon was connected to London Bridge when the London and Croydon Railway opened to a station at the site of the present-day West Croydon station. In the following years the London and Southampton Railway was renamed the London and South Western Railway (LSWR), and the London and Croydon Railway merged with other companies to form the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&amp;SCR).\nThere was pressure for a railway linking the towns and serving the industry in the area, and on 8 July 1853 the \"Wimbledon and Croydon Railway\" obtained an Act of Parliament to build an 11-mile line from Wimbledon to Epsom, joining the LSWR and the LB&amp;SCR at the ends. The scheme was modified to form a 5¾ mile line from Wimbledon to (West) Croydon. The line opened on 22 October 1855.\nOperation.\nInitially, it was operated under contract by its engineer George Parker Bidder, but in 1856 it was leased to the LB&amp;SCR, which purchased it outright in 1866. After construction of the line from Merton Park to Tooting in 1868 the section from Wimbledon to Merton Park became joint LSWR/LB&amp;SCR.\nAt first the passenger train service was six weekday and two Sunday trains each way. This gradually increased over the years, with some trains extended from Croydon to Crystal Palace Low Level in the steam era.\nOn 1 October 1868 the LB&amp;SCR opened its new line from Peckham Rye to Sutton, which intersected the Wimbledon and Croydon line, joining it and leaving it again by two sharp curves either side of the new Mitcham Junction station.\nPush and pull working of passenger trains started in 1919, and the line was electrified on the third rail system on 6 July 1930.\nOn 1 January 1923, under the 1921 grouping, it became part of the Southern Railway. In the latter half of the twentieth century, the industrial use declined, and passenger numbers suffered also.\nUpon the privatisation of British Rail, during the last year of the line being part of the Railtrack network passenger services were operated by Connex South Central. The last public train ran on 31 May 1997 and the line closed on 2 June 1997 for most of it to be converted into the Croydon Tramlink network. A railtour consisting of two sets of 4VEPs was the last train to run on the line after the regular services, as well as on the Addiscombe Line later that evening.\nTramlink.\nTo become part of the Tramlink network the section of the line from just south of Waddon Marsh to West Croydon was removed. Instead a flyover across the line to Sutton was constructed down to street level . The line reopened on 30 May 2000.\nStations.\nWimbledon.\nAt Wimbledon, the LSWR had a through station with four platforms, and the Wimbledon and Croydon had a separate platform. When the LBSCR/LSWR joint line via Tooting was opened in 1868, this was expanded to two platforms for the Brighton company: 5 (Up Tooting) and 6 (Down Merton). The station had its own approach road from the Broadway, and was managed independently, with a goods yard at the north-eastern end.\nThe line left in a south-westerly direction and immediately curved south-east on a 14-chain curve. The line to Lower Merton (Merton Park) was doubled as part of the Tooting &amp; Merton railway construction.\nMerton Park.\nAt first there was no station here, but the line from Tooting opened on 1 October 1868 forming a junction here, and a station was opened on the Tooting line only; it was named Lower Merton. The Tooting to Wimbledon line was double track, but the Croydon line remained single; a platform was added on 1 November 1870. Kingston Road, at the north-west end of the station was a very busy main road at the time, and had a level crossing.\nThe Tooting line ceased to operate passenger trains from 3 March 1929.\nMorden Road.\nOpened as Morden and then Morden Halt, the station was later called Morden Road (from 2 July 1951).\nMitcham.\nMitcham had a small goods yard south-west of the line, north-west of the passenger station.\nThe passenger station is now (1996) listed and converted to offices. Mitchell and Smith say that \"A claim has been made for Mitcham as being the oldest continuously working station site in the world, the Surrey Iron Railway having been in use here from 1803.\" However the word \"continuously\" seems to be negated by the closure of the Surrey Iron Railway after a long period of dormancy in 1846, nine years before the opening of the Wimbledon and Croydon Railway.\nMitcham Junction.\nThe station opened with the new Peckham Rye to Sutton line on 1 October 1868. The line from Streatham curved in from the north-east at the Wimbledon end of the station, and the line to Sutton curved away to the south-west at the Croydon end. There was a passenger bay that could be used for Croydon trains.\nA little west of the station, a thoroughfare called \"Tramway Path\" turns southwards; this marks the alignment of the Surrey Iron Railway's Hackbridge branch.\nBeddington Lane.\nIn the later decades of the twentieth century the signalman issued tickets from the signalbox.\nWaddon Marsh.\nThe station opened as \"Waddon Marsh Halt\" at the date of the electrification, 6 July 1930. A timber island platform was provided. Either side of the station area were considerable industrial plants and sidings serving them; they included gasworks and electricity generating plant. In later years of the twentieth century tickets were issued by the signalman from the signalbox.\nWest Croydon.\nWest Croydon station had been built on the site of the terminal basin of the Croydon Canal. It opened as a terminus for the London and Croydon Railway in 1839, becoming a through station for the LB&amp;SCR extension to Epsom in 1847. The Wimbledon and Croydon Railway was given a bay platform at the station."

        "text": "The 2011 Ironman World Championship was held on October 8, 2011, in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii and won by Craig Alexander of Australia and Chrissie Wellington of England. It was the 35th such Ironman Triathlon World Championships, which has been held annually in Hawaii since 1978, with an additional race in 1982. The championship is organised by the World Triathlon Corporation (WTC).\nChampionship results.\nMen.\nAlexander's overall time broke the previous course record by 12 seconds, which was set by Luc Van Lierde in 1996.\nWomen.\nBoth Carfrae and Wellington broke the championship course record for the marathon, set last year by Carfrae.\nQualification.\nTo enter for the 2011 World Championship race, age-group athletes are required to qualify through a performance at an Ironman or selected Ironman 70.3 race. Entry into the race can also be obtained through a random allocation lottery or through the Ironman's charitable eBay auction.\nFor professional triathletes, the 2011 Championship season marks the first year of a point system that determines which professional triathletes will qualify for the championship race. To qualify, points are earned by competing in WTC sanctioned Ironman and selected Ironman 70.3 events throughout the qualifying year. For the 2011 race that period was September 12, 2010 to August 31, 2011. The top 50 male and top 30 female pros in points at the end of each qualifying year qualify to race in Kona. Prior champions receive an automatic entry for the Championship race for a period of five years after their last championship performance provided that they compete in at least one full-distance Ironman race during the qualifying year.\nThe Ironman 2011 Series consisted of 22 Ironman races plus the Ironman World Championship 2010 which was itself a qualifier for the 2011 Ironman World Championship. The series started with Ironman Wisconsin 2010 held on September 12, 2010.\nQualifying Ironmans.\nChina cancellation.\nOn May 12, 2011, the WTC announced that the 2011 Ironman China and Ironman 70.3 China races, scheduled for May 29 in Jixian, Tianjin Province, China, were canceled. The Tianjin Sports Bureau (TSB) was unable to obtain the required sanctions from the China Triathlon Sports Association (CTSA) to conduct the event. Murphy Reinschreiber, managing director of the Asia Pacific region for WTC stated that \"TSB simply failed to provide all of the documentation necessary for CTSA to process the sanction.\" WTC is offering a full refund of entry fees to all athletes who were scheduled to compete at Ironman China and Ironman 70.3 China. Additionally, all athletes were offered a complimentary race entry into any of the 2011 Ironman and Ironman 70.3 races. WTC is allocating the age group qualifying slots from Ironman China and Ironman 70.3 China to other races in the region to ensure that athletes from the Asia-Pacific region are represented at the 2011 World Championship events."

        "text": "The Mountaineers is one of five cricket Zimbabwean cricket franchises. They are a first-class cricket team, based in the Manicaland and Mashonaland East area. They play their home matches at Mutare Sports Club in Mutare.\nFranchise history.\nFollowing the decline of the standards of cricket in Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe Cricket decided to use a new set of teams for all the first-class, List A and Twenty20 formats of the domestic game. A total of 5 franchises were named, and the Mountaineers team was based in Manicaland.\n2009-10 Logan Cup.\nOn their debut in this tournament, Mountaineers finished in third place in the group, with three wins from twelve games. Their debut first-class match against Mashonaland Eagles was a draw, thanks mainly to captain Hamilton Masakadza's century. Their first first-class win was against Southern Rocks, whom they crushed by eight wickets. For their third-place finish, Mountaineers could not contest the final.\n2009-10 Faithwear Metbank One-Day Competition.\nThe Mountaineers had a brilliant tournament, winning the championship by defeating Mid West Rhinos in the final by three wickets. They underlined their dominance in the tournament, by finishing top of the pool with 6 wins from 8 games. In the semi-final, they thrashed the Southern Rocks by seven wickets to enter the final. Players who starred for Mountaineers in that match included Hamilton Masakadza (44*), Tino Mawoyo (40), Stuart Matsikenyeri (36), and Shingirai Masakadza (3-20). In the final against the Rhinos, Mountaineers restricted the opposition to a lowly first-innings score of 144, with captain Prosper Utseya taking 3-24. In return, Mountaineers themselves slipped down to 66-7, before a brilliant fightback by Shingirai Masakadza (41*) and Prosper Utseya (30*) in an unbeaten partnership and the winning runs were scored in style by Masakadza with a lofted six off Malcolm Waller. Rhinos captain Vusi Sibanda had tried nine bowlers, but nothing could break the partnership.\n2009-10 Stanbic Bank 20 Series.\nDespite the fact, that the Mountaineers emerged victorious in this tournament, they were pretty shaky in the group stage. They had 3 wins from 5 games, while counterparts Mashonaland Eagles (the group-toppers), had a better record than them, with 4 wins from 5 games. The Eagles were more dominant, as was proved by the 82-run downing given to them by Eagles bowler Ray Price who took figures of 5 for 12 off just 17 deliveries and took his 5th wicket as Natsai Mushangwe was stumped and the match ended. Mountaineers got better in the final, and put the aforementioned disaster behind them to score a massive nine-wicket win and upset, with the victory mostly possible due to Hamilton Masakadza (64*) and Tatenda Taibu (37*).\nPlayers.\nWhen the country was debuting in the 2009-10 Logan Cup, the team consisted of Zimbabwean international and domestic players. Key players at that time included Hamilton Masakadza (Captain), Timycen Maruma, Johnson Marumisa, Shingirai Masakadza, Stuart Matsikenyeri, Tino Mawoyo, Natsai Mushangwe, Njabulo Ncube (who later went on to join his home province Matabeleland Tuskers), Tatenda Taibu (who later on joined Southern Rocks), and Prosper Utseya.\nThe Mountaineers made their first major overseas signing when they signed up South African all-rounder Greg Smith.\nThe following season, there were many improvements in the squads. Former South African great fast bowler Allan Donald was named as the franchise's head coach, while players like South Africa's Jonathan Beukes, Sean Ervine, and more prominently, former South African great all-rounder Lance Klusener, who playing in 171 ODIs, had an average of 41.10 at an impressive strike-rate of 89.91, Other signings include Liam Dawson, who scored, aged 21, scored 908 runs for Hampshire County Cricket Club, in the County Championship, and is supposed to have a long time contract with Mountaineers.\nFor the 2011-12 season, Mountaineers signed overseas players such as Australian star fast bowler, Dirk Nannes, former Black Caps all-rounder Chris Harris, English wicket-keeper Phil Mustard, and Ned Eckersley. Apart from that, former Zimbabwean seamer Gary Brent replaced Donald as coach.\nCurrent squad.\nPlayers with international caps are listed in bold.\nSource: ESPNCricinfo\nHonours.\nChampion "

Athletes with a disability competed, and the Championships was a qualifying event for the London 2012 Paralympic Games.\nOver 1000 athletes competed, including Oscar Pistorius, the \"Blade Runner\", who competed in class T44 at the 100m, 4 × 100 m relay, 200m, and 400m events.\nA warm-up meet, with free entry for the audience, was held on Friday January 14.\nEstimates placed the total visitor spend in the city at around $12 million.\nVenue.\nThe championship was staged in the 20,000-seat Queen Elizabeth II Park stadium that was built in 1973 for the 1974 British Commonwealth Games. Three weeks after the championship closed, the venue was damaged beyond repair in the 22 February 2011 Christchurch earthquake and has since been demolished.\nCoverage.\nAt least 120 journalists from 13 countries reported on the Championships. The countries included Brazil, Egypt, Finland, Switzerland, Algeria, Australia, Colombia and the United Kingdom.\nThe internet-TV channel ParalympicSport.TV, owned by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC), in conjunction with Sky Television and Kordia, broadcast daily live coverage of the Championships. ParalympicSport.TV also added clips to their YouTube channel.\nEvents.\nOpening ceremony.\nThe opening ceremony was held at Cathedral Square on Friday January 21 as a free event. Over 1000 athletes paraded through the streets of Christchurch. At Cathedral Square, the athletes were greeted by a Pōwhiri, a Māori welcoming ceremony.

        "text": "The 2009–10 Zimbabwean cricket season consists of international matches played by the Zimbabwe national cricket team as well as Zimbabwean domestic cricket matches under the auspices of Zimbabwe Cricket.\nHaving been suspended from Test cricket since 2005, Zimbabwe entered the 2009–10 ICC Intercontinental Cup, a first-class cricket competition competed for by the leading non-Test nations. They drew their first match of the competition against Afghanistan, before beating Kenya in their second. In One Day International cricket, Zimbabwe competed in four series, beating Kenya at home, but losing all three series away from home, against Bangladesh, South Africa and the West Indies.\nDomestically, a new five-team franchise system was introduced upon the recommendation of the International Cricket Council (ICC). The Logan Cup was won by the Mashonaland Eagles, while both one-day competitions were won by the Mountaineers.\nInternational cricket.\n2009–10 ICC Intercontinental Cup.\nDue to their suspension from Test cricket, in place since 2005, Zimbabwe approached the International Cricket Council (ICC) with a proposal to enter a team into the 2009–10 ICC Intercontinental Cup. The competition brings together the leading non-Test cricketing nations, playing each other in four-day first-class fixtures. The two leading teams then contest a final to determine the competition winner. A number of difficulties were admitted by both Zimbabwe Cricket and the ICC. Prominent among these was the fact that a number of the countries already scheduled to take part in the competition \"still have serious political reservations over travelling to, and hosting, Zimbabwe.\" Other issues included whether the competition format would need to be altered to accommodate Zimbabwe, and that it meant in essence that Zimbabwe were admitting they were at a lower level than their Full Member status of the ICC indicated.\nThe idea was given support from the governing bodies of cricket in Ireland, Scotland and Canada, with the chief executive of Cricket Scotland, Roddy Smith, summing up the mood, \"it will give the Associates a chance to play a Full Member whilst giving Zimbabwe competitive cricket.\" A re-formatting of the Intercontinental Cup took place, and Zimbabwe joined the top division of the competition, into which they elected to enter an 'A' team, Ozias Bvute, Zimbabwe Cricket's chief executive explaining that \"it was a chance to give up-and-coming and fringe players exposure to four-day cricket which they would otherwise not get.\"\nOne Day Internationals.\nHosting Kenya.\nAfter the conclusion of the Intercontinental Cup tie between Zimbabwe XI and Kenya, the touring Kenyans remained in Zimbabwe to contest five One Day Internationals (ODIs) against the host nation. The series came on the back of comments from within Zimbabwean cricket that the country could make a return to Test cricket in the following years, former national captain Alistair Campbell specifying \"two or three years\" when speaking to BBC World Service earlier in 2009. In their preview of the series, Cricinfo was less positive, describing the series as \"a battle between two sides firmly entrenched in the lower levels of one-day international cricket.\"\nZimbabwe won the five match series 4–1, winning heavily in three of their four victories. The hosts batted first in the opening match, reaching 313 largely due to a career-best score of 156 from Hamilton Masakadza. In reply, Kenya did not form any significant partnerships due to the Zimbabweans bowlers taking regular wickets. Steve Tikolo performed best for the tourists, reaching 49, but they were all out for 222, 91 runs short of Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe batted first again in the second ODI, reaching 263 off their 50 overs, due to an unbeaten 71 from Stuart Matsikenyeri, and 66 from Masakadza. Kenya started well in their reply, with David Obuya scoring rapidly, but he dismissed for 49 by Graeme Cremer, who took his best figures in an ODI, finishing with six wickets. Kenya lost all ten wickets for 177, granting Zimbabwe an 86 run victory.\nKenya won the third match, avoiding a series whitewash with a 20 run victory. Batting first for the first time in the series, they reached 266, with David Obuya and Alex Obanda both passing 50. Ray Price bowled economically for the hosts, conceding 22 runs in his nine overs, but Zimbabwe's reply was shaken early on when Mark Vermeulen and Charles Coventry were both dismissed cheaply. A middle-order partnership between Brendan Taylor and Matsikenyeri looked likely to give Zimbabwe victory, but the pair were out within two overs of each other, Taylor reaching 92. Kenya batted first again in the fourth ODI, and surpassed their total from the previous match, setting Zimbabwe 271 to win. In contrast to the previous match, Zimbabwe \"chased down [the] challenging target with ease.\" Forster Mutizwa top-scored during the reply, making 79, while Vermeulen and Taylor also scored half-centuries. Zimbabwe reached the total with six wickets remaining, securing the series with a match to go. The final match, a dead rubber, gave Zimbabwe their largest win of the series. Batting first, they scored 329, during which Masakadza passed his career-best score from the first ODI to record what was at the time the 11th highest score in ODIs, 178 not out. In reply, Kenya failed to recover after losing early wickets, and were all out for 187.\nTouring.\nThe series against Kenya was the only series that Zimbabwe hosted in the 2009–10, the remaining international contests were all tours by Zimbabwe. They played a five match ODI series against Bangladesh, losing the series 4–1, lost both of their two ODIs against South Africa, and then succumbed 4–1 to the West Indies."

        "text": "Matthew Ford (born October 9, 1984) is an American former professional ice hockey forward who played most notably in the American Hockey League (AHL).\nPlaying career.\nAmateur.\nFord started his amateur career playing for the Sioux Falls Stampede of the United States Hockey League in the 2003–04 season. In 60 games, Ford posted an impressive 37 goals and 68 points to lead the Stampede and was consequently drafted in the eighth round, 256th overall, in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft by the Chicago Blackhawks. Ford then opted to continue his amateur career by enrolling to play collegiate hockey with the University of Wisconsin of the Western Collegiate Hockey Association the following season. Used as a role player within the Badgers, Ford never totaled more than 13 points in each of his four seasons, but helped Wisconsin win the National Championship as a sophomore in 2006.\nProfessional.\nUpon completion of his college career, and unsigned from the Blackhawks, Ford made his professional debut in the 2008–09 season with the Charlotte Checkers of the ECHL. He was signed to a professional try-out with AHL affiliate, the Hartford Wolf Pack, on November 6, 2008, before he was returned to the Checkers on December 8, 2008. Ford was selected to the American Conference team for the ECHL's All-Star game and following a three-goal, four point performance was named the All-Stars MVP on January 21. Enduring a second stint with the Wolf Pack in late January he compiled a combined 25 games, scoring one goal and two assists. On March 11, immediately after his second spell with Hartford was ended, Ford was signed to a P.T.O contract with fellow AHL team, the Lake Erie Monsters, going scoreless in five games. Ford returned to the Checkers to complete his season with 38 points in 28 regular season games and 5 points in 6 games during the playoffs.\nIn the 2009–10 season, Ford re-signed with the Charlotte Checkers, but played only 3 games before he was loaned back to Lake Erie on October 30, 2009. Remaining with the Monsters for the duration of the season, Ford posted 13 goals and 27 points in 45 games while also leading with a team-high Plus/Minus of +14.\nRe-signed by Lake Erie prior to the 2010–11 campaign, he was invited on a try-out to participate in the Monsters NHL affiliate, the Colorado Avalanche, training camp on September 15, 2010 before returning to Cleveland to begin the season.\nOn July 1, 2011, Ford was signed to his first NHL contract, agreeing to a two-way one-year deal with the Washington Capitals. Assigned to the Capitals affiliate, the Hershey Bears, Ford scored 28 points in 39 games before he was traded by the Capitals to the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for Kevin Marshall on February 2, 2012.\nFord was re-signed to a one-year extension with the Flyers on April 4, 2012. Assigned directly to affiliate, the Adirondack Phantoms, in the following 2012–13 season, he suffered from injury and a lack of production to post only 4 goals in 35 games with the Phantoms. On March 12, 2013, Ford was traded by the Flyers to the Columbus Blue Jackets for future considerations. He remained in the AHL to be immediately assigned to affiliate, the Springfield Falcons.\nReleased as a free agent by the Blue Jackets, Ford remained in the AHL signing a one-year contract with the Oklahoma City Barons on July 13, 2013. On July 2, 2015, Ford followed the Edmonton Oilers AHL affiliation, in signing a one-year AHL contract with the Bakersfield Condors for the 2015–16 season. Ford led the Condors with 27 goals and 51 points in 64 games.\nGrand Rapids Griffins.\nAfter three seasons within the Oilers AHL affiliates, Ford left as a free agent to add a veteran presence on a two-year AHL deal with the Grand Rapids Griffins, an affiliate to the Detroit Red Wings on July 12, 2016. During the 2017–18 season, Ford served as captain for the Griffins, where he recorded 22 goals and 16 assists in 72 games, ranking fourth on the team in goals and sixth in points. On June 26, 2018, the Grand Rapids Griffins signed Ford to a two-year contract extension.\nOn November 5, 2021, Ford officially announced his retirement after a twelve-year professional career having playing in 716 regular season AHL games."

        "title": "Black players in ice hockey",
        "text": "The history of black players in North American ice hockey has roots dating back to the late 19th century. The first black ice hockey star was Herb Carnegie during the Great Depression. Willie O'Ree broke the NHL's black color barrier with the Boston Bruins in 1958.\nColoured Hockey League.\nThe Coloured Hockey League of the Maritimes began in 1895, as an initiative of black Baptist churches in Nova Scotia. The aim was to increase and retain male membership. The league consisted of teams from Halifax, Africville, Hammond's Plains, Dartmouth, Truro, Amherst, and Charlottetown, P.E.I. All games were on an invitational basis with the trophy still residing in a private home in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Historically, they were the first league to allow the goaltender to drop to the ice to stop the puck.\nOntario.\nOntario is geographically large, and it was impossible in the early 20th century to organize an all-black league like in Nova Scotia. Some of the early black players in Ontario hockey history included Hipple Galloway and Fred Kelly. Galloway played as a member of the Woodstock team in the Central Ontario Hockey Association in 1899. In 1916, Fred (Bud) Kelly of London played for the 118 Battalion team of the Ontario Hockey League. Kelly was scouted by the Toronto St. Pats but was never officially contacted. One of the first all-black teams in Ontario was the Orioles. The team was from St. Catharines and played in the Niagara District Hockey League during the 1930s.\nHerb Carnegie's hockey career began in 1938 with the Toronto Young Rangers and continued in the early 1940s with the Buffalo Ankerites, a team in a mines league that played in mining towns in northern Ontario and Quebec. While with the Ankerites, Carnegie was part of the Black Aces line. The other line members consisted of his brother, Ossie Carnegie, and Manny McIntyre, originally from Fredericton, New Brunswick. They were recognized as much for their talent and skill as their skin color (Herb was at center, Ossie was right wing, McIntyre was the left wing). In the semi-professional Quebec Provincial League, Herb was named most valuable player in 1946, 1947, and 1948.\nIn 1948, Carnegie was given a tryout with the New York Rangers and offered a contract to play in the Rangers' minor league system. However, he was offered less money than he was earning in the Quebec league and turned down all three offers made by the Rangers organization during his tryout.\nNHL.\nThe NHL does not keep statistics on the percentages of ethnicities in the league. However, outside sources have collected statistics on the number of black players in the NHL as well as the percentage of white players in the NHL. According to an article by USA Today, 97% of the NHL is white, while the other 3% is made of different ethnicities. Of the 3% of the remaining ethnicities, twenty-six are black. Twenty of the twenty-six black hockey players are from Canada while six are American. In all, the NHL is made up of 47.4% Canadians, 25.4% Americans, 9.0% Swedes, and the rest is made up by Russia, Finland, and a few other nations. Notable players of African American descent include Dustin Byfuglien, who is of Norwegian, African, and Swedish descent; Kyle Okposo, who is of Nigerian descent; and Joel Ward, whose ancestors are from Barbados.\nA \"Sports Illustrated\" article in 1999 attributed the increase in black NHL players, in part, to significant demographic changes in Canada, the country which supplies the largest share of the league's players: \"In 1971 there were only 34,445 blacks in Canada ... 25 years later, after heavy immigration from British Commonwealth nations in the Caribbean, Canada had 573,860 blacks (2% of the population) ...\"\nIn 2019, the NHL designed a Black History Month mobile museum. The mobile museum is a part of the \"Hockey is For Everyone\" campaign and is aimed to celebrate Black History Month. The mobile museum is also a commemoration of the black players who have played in the NHL. The museum completed an eight-city tour in February, with its final stop being outside the Canadian embassy in Washington, D.C.\nPlayers.\nWillie O'Ree is referred to as the \"Jackie Robinson of ice hockey\" (and twice met Robinson personally, in O'Ree's own younger years) as the first black player in the National Hockey League (NHL). He was called up to the Boston Bruins of the NHL to replace an injured player. He made his NHL debut with the Bruins on January 18 of the 1957–58 NHL season, against the Montreal Canadiens, becoming the first black player in league history. O'Ree is still heavily involved with the NHL, in promoting the league's Diversity Program all over North America with amateur youth and adult hockey players.\nManagement.\nIn July 2022, the San Jose Sharks hired Mike Grier as general manager, making him the first black American to serve as general manager.\nOfficiating.\nOn April 3, 2001, Jay Sharrers made NHL history as the first black referee to officiate an NHL game. He worked his first game as an NHL ref when the Philadelphia Flyers faced the visiting Florida Panthers.\nRacial incidents in the NHL.\nDuring the 1958 season, Canadian-born Willie O'Ree became the first player of African descent to join the National Hockey League. Playing a short career of only 45 games, O'Ree faced racism after being recalled from the Canadian minor leagues. While in the minor leagues, O'Ree recalls the racism he faced as predominantly muted. However, as soon as O'Ree entered into the NHL, racist remarks and actions by hostile fans and players appeared. While playing in America, O'Ree recalled one racial incident where Chicago Blackhawks forward Eric Nesterenko yelled racial slurs at O'Ree and butt-ended O'Ree with his stick. The event caused fights to break out between all players of each team and a police escort was required for O'Ree to leave the building safely. O'Ree has stated that racism had not affected him in his playing career. In addition, any racial slurs, according to him, \"would go in one ear, and out the other.\" O'Ree cites his brother as his main inspiration to become the first black hockey player. He found that if the fans were against him playing because of his skin color, he may as well ignore it and focus on what he does best. This motivation led Willie O'Ree to be named the \"Jackie Robinson\" of hockey by the NHL community.\nWhen O'Ree first entered the league as the first ice hockey player of African descent, he received no recognition from the league or the media. The media did not publish any articles that the color line in hockey had been broken. Some newspapers who reported about the first game O'Ree played confused O'Ree's first name Willie, as Billy. O'Ree himself noted, \"It didn't really dawn on me then,\" that he had broken the color barrier in professional hockey. When Val James first entered the league in 1981, the NHL did not make any recognition of him being the first African American in the NHL.\nNowadays, O'Ree serves as the NHL Diversity Ambassador and aims to raise participation in hockey by all races through hosting programs at local ice arenas. These programs include learn-to-skate clinics as well as youth hockey development clinics for children of multi-ethnic backgrounds. The main goal of the clinics is to increase the diversity of hockey and allow children who are unfamiliar with the sport to have a chance at trying it out. The clinics also address the issue of race within the hockey community. O'Ree's personal goals are to communicate that, \"Your race can't keep you from succeeding,\" to the younger children and to share how he overcame the racism he faced during his career.\nThe first American-born player of African descent in the NHL was Val James. James's short career was spent with the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Buffalo Sabres. James recalls fans taunting him with racial slurs as well as players committing penalties and fights against him because of his skin color. In an interview with James, he states that he could not watch another hockey game for ten years due to the events of his NHL career haunting him. Val James found the most intensive racism to be in the United States. During his career with the Buffalo Sabres, Val James recalls beer bottles being thrown at him when entering the arena as well as fans shouting racial slurs at him.\nModern-day racial incidents in the NHL come in many different forms; however, the most prominent are player and spectator interactions. According to an interview with Washington Capitals forward Devante Smith-Pelly, \"As a Black hockey player, he [Smith-Pelly] knew exactly what they meant by, 'Basketball, basketball, basketball! In this case, the spectators are taunting Smith-Pelly that he is better suited to play basketball, since the majority of the NBA is African American. Smith-Pelly states that this incident was \"just ignorant people being ignorant.\"\nMany other racist incidents during hockey games have also occurred. During a preseason game, while playing for the Philadelphia Flyers, Wayne Simmonds had a banana thrown at him by a fan. Simmonds' response to this event was very similar to Smith-Pelly's. He believes that a strong example should be set by including a zero-tolerance policy in the NHL. With this policy enacted, any racist remarks or gestures would cause an immediate ejection from the arena and a subsequent ban from attending that organization's games.\nNHL commissioner Gary Bettman has supported his players' wishes by including the zero-tolerance policy for racism. According to Gary Bettman, \"Even if it's only one incident it is one too many.\" The NHL has taken increasing action in the past few years against racist events, even banning four fans from the United Center and all future Chicago Blackhawks events. Commissioner Gary Bettman has also raised awareness of racist incidents around the league by dedicating the month of February to \"Hockey is for Everyone Month\". The event starts on February 1, the same date as Black History Month, and has the goal of raising awareness of equality throughout the league. Players tape their sticks with pride tape that represents awareness of equality, respect, and inclusion. In addition, many different programs take place across the nation to include players with disabilities. The event is also promoted through social media with the hashtag HockeyIsForEveryone.\nAlthough the NHL has taken strong actions against racism in the league, players still believe there is a large issue at hand. Most players, including Smith-Pelly and Evander Kane of the Edmonton Oilers, believe that the NHL has still a long way to go. In their words, race as an issue in the NHL will continue to exist, due to similar incidents occurring in the NHL both sixty years ago and today. O'Ree has a hopeful outlook for the future of hockey's diversity. He has stated, \"There's more kids of colour playing hockey today than ever before, and more girls.\" Furthermore, many players are optimistic that the NHL community has gathered around to protect its players from racist incidents.\nWomen's hockey.\nAngela James played in the Central Ontario Women's Hockey League, precursor to the National Women's Hockey League and Canadian Women's Hockey League. She represented Team Canada internationally. She scored 34 points (22g, 12a) in 20 games over four women's world championships, including 11 goals in five games in the inaugural IIHF World Women's Championships, held in Ottawa in 1990. In 2008, she, along with Cammi Granato (USA) and Geraldine Heaney (CAN), became the first women to be inducted into the International Ice Hockey Federation Hockey Hall of Fame. James is the daughter of a black father and white mother; she is the only Black Canadian to captain a national hockey team.\nCareer stats.\nFranchise career.\nThese are the top-ten point, goal, and assist scorers in any franchise history.

        "text": "Handball SA (formerly Team Handball Association of South Australia, or THASA) is the administrative body for European handball in South Australia and is based in Adelaide.\nHandball SA's primary purpose is to promote and develop team handball in South Australia, run junior and educational programs and administer team handball and beach handball competitions in the state. Handball SA is operated by a committee of volunteers whose current president is Tammie Hamilton.\nTHASA, as Handball SA was then known, was founded in 1987 and its first president was Dieter Schultz. The fortunes of the organization have been mixed since its inception. In the period 1992-2000 THASA oversaw a competition of 5 men's teams and 2 women's teams. Following this period, THASA was inactive for five years before it restarted in 2005 and is still in the process of rebuilding the handball competition in South Australia to the level of the previous decade. In 2010, THASA was officially renamed Handball SA.\nHandball SA has sent both men's and women's teams to represent South Australia in the annual Australian Handball Federation National Championships on a sporadic basis since 1989. In the 2010 Championships the women's and men's teams placed 3rd and 6th respectively. Birte Biehler from South Australia was awarded joint Most Valuable Player in the women's division.\nIn 2011 the teams placed 4th and 6th respectively, and the women's team was presented with the Fair Play award. Lucas Turecek from the men's team was also declared the highest scorer of the Championships.\nHandball SA hosted the 2012 Australian Handball Championships in Adelaide at Netball SA Stadium from 4 to 7 October 2012. It was the first time in two decades that the national championships have been held in Adelaide. Both SA men's and women's teams placed fourth, after 3 wins in the preliminary round for the former, and one win for the latter. Clemence Schmitt, pivot from South Australia, was awarded Most Valuable Player in the women's division.\nIn 2013 Handball SA again held the Australian Handball Championships, from 10 to 13 October at Netball SA Stadium - the second time in two years. The SA women's team returned to the medals, winning a silver medal against VIC in the final. The men finished with fourth, after going into extra time in the bronze medal match against QLD.\n2016 was a very important year for the South Australian men's team. The team collected a silver medal at the Australian Open Club Championships in Geelong, and then earned its first-ever gold medal at the Australian Handball Championships.\nHandball SA currently oversees an indoor handball competition. Over the past few years this has been contested by the two major South Australian clubs, Southern Handball Club and West Adelaide Handball Club. The season runs from approximately April to September.\nABC Adelaide featured handball in 2012 ('European handball gets a grip on sports fans in Adelaide'), while Behind The News ran a feature on handball in 2011 ('Handball').\nSince 2008, Handball SA has also run a beach handball competition during the summer months on various beaches in Adelaide. The beach handball season runs from approximately October to March.\nHandball SA hosted the Australian Beach Handball Championships in 2010, 2015, 2017 and 2018 at Glenelg, South Australia. It will do so again in 2019.\nThe men's team was able to gain a silver medal at the Australian Beach Handball Championships in 2016, and the women have won a bronze medal on more than one occasion.\nABC Radio's Grandstand picked up on the growing popularity of beach handball in Adelaide in 2012 ('Grandstand Sporting Adventures')."

        "title": "2006–07 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 2006–07 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team was an NCAA Division I college basketball team competing in the Big East Conference representing Georgetown University. The Hoyas finished first place in the conference, won the conference tournament, and advanced to the semifinals in the NCAA tournament. The 2006–07 season marked the centennial of Hoya hoops, which was celebrated by honoring some of the team's most famous alumni at the Georgetown-Marquette game on February 10, 2007. The team was led by juniors, forward Jeff Green, center Roy Hibbert, and point guard Jonathan Wallace. The team's freshmen were DaJuan Summers, Vernon Macklin, and Jeremiah Rivers. Other regular players are Tyler Crawford, Jessie Sapp, and Patrick Ewing Jr.\nOn March 3, 2007, the Hoyas won their first regular-season Big East Championship since 1989. On March 10, 2007, the Hoyas defeated the Pittsburgh Panthers (65–42) to win the 2007 Big East tournament championship, also for the first time since 1989. Jeff Green was named the Big East Player of the year and the tournament's Most Outstanding Player.\nThe Hoyas advanced to the 2007 Final Four before losing to an Ohio State team led by Greg Oden. In the NCAA tournament's first weekend, the Hoyas defeated Belmont and Boston College. The Hoyas' games in the second weekend were some of the closest and most-watched contests of the tournament. The Hoyas defeated Vanderbilt on a last-second bank shot by Jeff Green, then beat North Carolina in the Regional Final when their defense caused North Carolina to suffer an improbable collapse in which the Tar Heels missed 21 of their final 23 field goal attempts.\nSeason recap.\nRegular season.\nNon-conference schedule.\nReturning three starters – forward Jeff Green, center Roy Hibbert, and point guard Jonathan Wallace – from the previous season, coming off an 2006 NCAA tournament appearance, and boasting their highest preseason poll ranking (No. 8) since 1995, the Hoyas opened the 2006-07 season with high expectations.\nGeorgetown began the season with consecutive wins over Hartford and at Vanderbilt, in the latter game handing Vanderbilt its first opening-game loss on its home court since November 14, 1990; the Commodores had been 62-4 against non-conference opponents there. Against Hartford, Green scored 17 points, Hibbert had 16, and Wallace contributed 13, and in the Vanderbilt game, Hibbert had a double-double (18 points and 10 rebounds), while Green scored 19 points, despite playing only seven minutes in the first half due to foul trouble, and Wallace and sophomore guard Jessie Sapp contributed 13 and 11 points, respectively. But the Hoyas stumbled in their third game despite a 17-point, eight-rebound performance by Hibbert, when Old Dominion rallied from an eight-point deficit in the second half to beat Georgetown, snapping a 23-game Hoya winning streak at McDonough Gymnasium that dated back to February 1982. In the next game, freshman forward DaJuan Summers scored in double digits for the first time in his college career with 17 points and Sapp contributed 14 in a win at Fairfield.\nA game followed against Ball State, coached by former Georgetown player and assistant coach Ronny Thompson, the younger brother of John Thompson III, in the first meeting of the brothers as opposing head coaches. Their father, former Georgetown head coach John Thompson Jr., called the meeting a \"stupid\" idea, and he attended the game wearing a neutral black ballcap with a \"T\" embroidered on its front, barely expressing emotion as Georgetown defeated Ball State 69-54 in a one-sided contest in which Jeff Green scored 14 points, DaJuan Summers scored 12, and freshman forward Vernon Macklin contributed 10 points. After the game, John Thompson III discussed a rematch scheduled for the following season, saying \"We may cancel that...This is hard. I knew it would be difficult, and it was much more difficult, to tell you the truth, than I ever thought it would be. That's my brother. I want them to have some success. I want to watch their tapes in a manner in which to help them rather than figure out to beat them.\" But the rematch between the brothers was not to be, because by the time the teams met again a year later, Billy Taylor had replaced Ronny Thompson as Ball State's head coach.\nAfter the Old Dominion loss, Georgetown had fallen from No. 8 to No. 14 in the AP Poll, and the Hoyas fell farther to No. 18 by the time they played Oregon to close out November. Although Jonathan Wallace scored 17 points, the Ducks overcame their own poor shooting to defeat Georgetown in Oregon's first win in eight tries over a Top 25 team in a game played on the United States East Coast. Next up was a game at No. 10 Duke on December 2, Georgetown's first ranked opponent during the season. The underdog Hoyas shot 57.7 percent in the first half and led 34-27 at halftime, but the game was very different in the second half, during which Georgetown shot only 26.1 percent (6-for-23) and committed 11 turnovers. With 11:28 to go in the game, Georgetown still led 43-39, but scored only two more field goals. Meanwhile, Duke sophomore guard Greg Paulus and freshman guard Jon Scheyer scored all 13 and all nine of their points, respectively, in the second half, combining for 16 straight points at one point. Hibbert had 11 points and six rebounds, Jeff Green had eight points, 10 rebounds, and five assists, Jessie Sapp had 13 points, and Georgetown led 49-47 on a Hibbert drive with 6:27 left in the game, but Duke took the lead for good at 4:55 and won 61-52. The Blue Devils lengthened their home winning streak against nonconference opponents to 46 games, the second-longest such active streak in the United States, and gave head coach Mike Krzyzewski his 760th career win.\nAfter the back-to-back losses to Oregon and Duke, Georgetown's record stood at 4-3, and the Hoyas fell out of the Top 25, not to return for two months. However, the Hoyas promptly embarked on the first of two lengthy winning streaks. It began with a win over James Madison on December 5 in which Jeff Green – who had scored in double digits only once in the previous five games – had 17 points and five assists, Jessie Sapp scored 15 points, Jonathan Wallace contributed 14 points, and Georgetown – which had gone a collective 3-for-23 (11.5 percent) from three-point range against Oregon and Duke – tied the school record for three-pointers when junior forward Patrick Ewing Jr., a newcomer to the team, hit the Hoyas′ 16th three-pointer of the game with 3:56 left to play, tying the 16 scored at Davidson in November 2004. As the winning streak continued, Green scored 15 points against Oral Roberts and 12 against Towson and had 20 points and nine rebounds against Navy; Hibbert had his second double-double (23 points, 11 rebounds) of the season in the Oral Roberts game, 10 points against Winston-Salem State, 15 points and seven rebounds against Navy; and 14 points against Michigan; Jonathan Wallace scored 12 points against Oral Roberts, 14 points against Towson, and 12 against Michigan; DaJuan Summers scored 14 points against Winston-Salem State and 18 against Towson; junior guard/forward and team co-captain Tyler Crawford, who had missed several games due to a bout with strep throat that resulted in a hospital stay, had 12 points vs. Wilson-Salem State; and sophomore Marc Egerson had 11 points each against Oral Roberts and Michigan. Other highlights of the streak included a 70-percent Georgetown team shooting performance from the floor during the second half of the Winston-Salem State game and the defeat of Michigan to close out December, which dealt the Wolverines their first loss in their last 14 nonconference games at Crisler Arena; Georgetown shot 23-for-44 (52.3%), becoming only the second team at the time to shoot better than 50 percent against Michigan.\nConference schedule.\nMarc Egerson left the team for \"personal reasons\" (he later transferred to Delaware) before Georgetown, with a 10-3 record and a six-game winning streak, opened its Big East season with a game against No. 17 Notre Dame on January 6 and thoroughly dominated the Fighting Irish on offense and defense. Notre Dame shot 1-for-10 and committed six turnovers during the game's first 8½ minutes, and Georgetown jumped out to an 18-2 lead and then extended it to 29-9. Notre Dame closed to an 11-point deficit by halftime, but the Hoyas went on a 14-0 run early in the second half that pushed their lead to 29 points. Hibbert scored a game-high 18 points on 8-for-9 (.889) shooting. The Hoyas held Notre Dame, which averaged 88 points per game and was shooting 41 percent from three-point range entering the contest, to 4-for-22 (18 percent) in three-pointers, and the Fighting Irish finished with fewer than 50 points for the first time since joining the Big East in 1995. Georgetown won in a 66-48 upset, ending a 12-game Notre Dame winning streak and extending Georgetown's to seven.\nGeorgetown stumbled in its next game, losing to Villanova – despite DaJuan Summers′ 16 points, with the team′ leading scorer, Hibbert, getting only two points – before facing No. 7 Pittsburgh. Jeff Green and Jessie Sapp each had 15 points against Pittsburgh – Green reaching 1,000 points for his college career – and Patrick Ewing Jr., contributed 12 points, while Hibbert had 11 points and two rebounds. With the teams shooting a combined 60 percent from the floor and Pittsburgh outrebounding Georgetown, the Hoyas led 18-17 halfway through the first half, but Pittsburgh then went on a 20-8 run to take the lead for good and won the game 74-69. The loss left Georgetown with a 1-2 conference record, but the Hoyas were destined to lose only two more games during the entire remaining season and postseason combined.\nAs the Big East season continued, the Hoyas began a second – and even longer – winning streak. During the early part of the string of victories, Jeff Green scored 19 points in a win against DePaul, 17 points against Cincinnati, a then-career-high 24 points at St. John's, and 14 points against Louisville. Roy Hibbert had a 16-point game at Rutgers 10 points at Seton Hall, 12 points against DePaul a career-high 26 points as part of another double double with 11 rebounds and two blocked shots against Cincinnati, and still another double double (22 points and 11 rebounds) against Louisville. DaJuan Summers scored 16 points at Rutgers, had a double double (17 points and 10 rebounds) at Seton Hall, and contributed 12 points in the victory over DePaul and 13 against Louisville, while Jonathan Wallace had a career-high 21 points at Seton Hall and 13 points at St. John's and Jessie Sapp scored 11 against Louisville.\nBy the time of the Louisville game on February 7, the Hoyas, ranked No. 22, had returned to the Top 25 for the first time in two months. Georgetown was still No. 22, riding a six-game winning streak, and celebrating the 100th anniversary of its basketball program – including a halftime ceremony in which it honored its \"all-century team,\" which included Patrick Ewing, Eric \"Sleepy\" Floyd, Michael Jackson, Dikembe Mutombo, Alonzo Mourning, and Allen Iverson – on February 10 when the Hoyas faced No. 11 Marquette, winners of eight straight, at the Verizon Center. The Golden Eagles made only three of their first 14 shots from the floor, but went on a 9-0 run to close to within one point, and Georgetown led by only 28-26 at the half. With Georgetown leading 53-52 with 7:29 left in the game, Green and Hibbert combined to score the next 17 points. With Marquette making only one field goal and four free throws the rest of the game, Georgetown closed the game out with a 23-5 run that gave the Hoyas a 76-58 upset victory. Green had a then-career-high-tying 24 points, Hibbert had another double-double (23 points plus 11 rebounds), and Wallace and Summers each contributed 10 points.\nTwo days after beating Marquette, Georgetown, by now ranked No. 14, faced another ranked opponent, No. 23 West Virginia, in a contest between the two best defenses in the Big East Conference. Georgetown's Princeton offense outdueled West Virginia's trap defense, and the Hoya defense crimped West Virginia's three-point shooting – among the best in the United States – holding the Mountaineers to 9-for-26 (38 percent) shooting from three-point range. The Hoyas shot 58 percent from the floor and outrebounded West Virginia 35-19, outscoring the Mountaineers 17-0 during one stretch in the first half to jump out to a double-digit lead they never relinquished. Shooting 79 percent from the floor in the first half, Georgetown led 37-20 at halftime and opened the second half with a 7-0 run to take a 44-20 lead. Roy Hibbert went 12-for-13 (92.3 percent) from the free-throw line and had 20 points, Jeff Green had 15 points, and Jonathan Wallace scored 14.\nIn the next game, Jeff Green had 19 points and DaJuan Summers had 11 in a tight victory over Villanova that required Georgetown to come from a 37-29 deficit to eke out a 58-55 win. Jessie Sapp had 16 points and made a three-point shot from half-court as the buzzer sounded to end the first half. The win gave Georgetown its first nine-game winning streak since 2003-04. The Hoyas extended their winning streak to 10 – their first 10-game streak since they opened the 2003-04 season 10-0 – with a win at Cincinnati that saw Jeff Green score 21 points and Jonathan Wallace contribute 17.\nThree days after beating Cincinnati, No. 12 Georgetown again faced a ranked opponent, No. 10 Pittsburgh, at the Verizon Center, with a chance to climb into first place in the Big East. In a ragged game in which both sides had poor outside shooting and committed more than their share of turnovers, the score stood at 49-49 when Georgetown went on an 8-2 run that ultimately clinched a 61-53 upset win and sole possession of first place for Georgetown. Jonathan Wallace scored 17 points, Jeff Green had 14, and Roy Hibbert added 12.\nThe win over Pittsburgh gave Georgetown 11 straight wins, its longest winning streak since an 11-victory run in 1995, but the streak came to end at Syracuse two days later, as the Orange used a 17-0 run in the second half to upset the No. 9 Hoyas, 72-58. DaJuan Summers and Patrick Ewing Jr., each scored 10 points, the only Hoyas to reach double digits. In the final game of the season, Georgetown bounced back, beating Connecticut to win the Big East regular-season championship for the first time since 1989. Against Connecticut, Roy Hibbert had another double-double (18 points and 12 rebounds), Jeff Green scored 14 points, and Patrick Ewing Jr., added 12.\nGeorgetown ended the regular season ranked No. 9, with a 13-3 record in the Big East Conference – their best Big East record since 1989 – and 23-6 overall.\nBig East tournament.\nWith a No. 1 seed in the Big East tournament for the first time since 1989, Georgetown had a bye in the first round. In the quarterfinals, the Hoyas faced Villanova, winners of four straight. The Hoyas outscored the Wildcats 14-0 to start the game, Villanova's first points not coming until 7:20 had elapsed in the first half. A 12-0 Georgetown run followed, creating a 26-2 lead over Villanova with 9:28 left in the first half. Georgetown outshot Villanova 57 percent to 27 percent in the first half, led by 25 points three times, and had a 37-18 advantage at halftime. Villanova attempted a comeback, finishing a 14-2 run with 5:29 elapsed in the second half to close to a ten-point deficit, but then the Hoyas increased their lead to 17. Georgetown still led 56-45 with 1:43 left in the game, but the Wildcats closed to a six-point deficit with 49 seconds left and then to 59-54 with 27.9 seconds remaining. Georgetown held on to win 62-57. Roy Hibbert had 14 points in the game, Jeff Green had 12 points and nine rebounds, and Jonathan Wallace and DaJuan Summers each contributed 10 points.\nThe Hoyas advanced to play No. 20 Notre Dame, winners of six straight, in a semifinal game the following day. The Fighting Irish jumped out to a 37-21 lead with 7:37 left in the first half, but Georgetown went on a 10-2 run and reduced Notre Dame's advantage to 46-44 at halftime. Patrick Ewing Jr., scored six points in the first 1:48 of the second half to give Georgetown its first lead at 50-49, and Jeff Green contributed seven points during a 9-0 run that gave the Hoyas a 76-69 lead with five minutes left in the game, but Notre Dame replied with a nine unanswered points of its own to take a 78-76 lead with 2:54 left. Wallace and Hibbert then scored on consecutive jump shots to put the Hoyas back in front, 80-78, and Summers stretched the lead to 82-79 by sinking two free throws. Notre Dame tied the game at 82-82 with 40.5 seconds left, but then Jeff Green sank the winning basket with 13 seconds remaining. Notre Dame guard Russell Carter′s three-pointer missed with six seconds left, and Jonathan Wallace grabbed the rebound and heaved the ball down the court to preserve the Hoyas′ 84-82 win, their fourth consecutive victory over the Fighting Irish. Green had a double-double, scoring a new career high of 30 points and grabbing 12 rebounds, while Summers contributed 18 points. Ewing had his best game since transferring from Indiana, shooting 7-for-11 from the field and scoring a career-high 18 points, and Jonathan Wallace scored 10.\nWinners of 14 of their previous 15 games, the Hoyas reached the Big East tournament final for the first time since 1996, facing No. 13 Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh led 2-0 at the beginning of the game, but shot 26.2 percent from the field and never led again. Georgetown had a 13-11 lead with 9:04 left in the first half and then went on a 15-2 run to take a 28-13 lead with 2:58 remaining. At halftime, the Hoyas led 32-17, and in the second half the Panthers never got closer than 13 points as Georgetown cruised to a 65-42 victory, winning the Big East tournament for the first time since 1989 and seventh time overall – and, as it turned out, for the last time in the original Big East Conference. Jeff Green scored a game-high 21 points and was selected as the tournament's Most Valuable Player, while Hibbert had a double-double (14 points and 11 rebounds).\nNCAA tournament.\nWinning the Big East tournament gave Georgetown an automatic 2007 NCAA tournament bid and its first NCAA tournament appearances in consecutive years since 1996 and 1997. With a 26-6 record, the Hoyas were seeded second in the East Regional, their highest seed since 1996. Meeting 15th-seed Belmont in the first game, the Hoyas got off to s slow start, with the Bruins taking an 11-4 lead to start the game, but then Georgetown scored 11 straight points during a 20-4 run, kept Belmont from scoring a field goal for eight minutes, and took the lead for good, 13-11, with 11:23 left in the first half. Jessie Sapp, who had been shooting 28 percent from three-point range for the season and in his past six games had failed to score in double figures, shot 12-for-42 (28.6 percent) from the floor, had a career-high four three-pointers and a career-high 20 points in the game. Jeff Green scored 15 points, Roy Hibbert had a double-double (10 points and 13 rebounds), and Georgetown got an easy 80-55 victory, the 17th time they had won their first-round game in their past 18 NCAA tournament appearances.\nIn the second round, Georgetown faced seventh-seed Boston College, a former Big East rival, in a very physical game. The Hoyas, entering the game second in the United States in field goal percentage at 51 percent, shot only 38 percent during the game, and the Eagles led 30-26 at halftime and stretched their led to 39-31 early in the second half. Then the Hoyas went on a 10-0 run to take the lead, 41-39, with 11:44 left in the game. Georgetown took the lead for good at 46-44 with 8:03 remaining, but the game stayed close, with the Eagles trailing by no more than four points and by as few as one. During the final minute and a half, the Hoyas drew fouls and made critical free throws to come away with a 62-55 win. Hibbert, who had a double-double (17 points and 12 rebounds), scored 15 of his points in the second half. Jeff Green also had a double-double (11 points and 12 rebounds), while Jonathan Wallace contributed 15 points.\nIn the East Regional semifinals – their second consecutive appearance in the \"Sweet Sixteen\" – the Hoyas faced sixth-seeded Vanderbilt, a team Georgetown had defeated early in the season. The Commodores staked themselves to a 32-24 lead at halftime, but the Hoyas battled back in the second half, with DaJuan Summers making three clutch three-pointers, and neither team ever led by more than four points during the final 17 minutes of play, a stretch in which the game saw eight lead changes and four ties. Hibbert fouled out with 3:28 left to play, a major blow to the Hoyas in a tight game, but the Commodores were unable to take much advantage of his absence, and a Jonathan Wallace jump shot put the Hoyas ahead 64-61 with 1:03 left in the game. With 48.8 seconds to go, Vanderbilt's Derrick Byars sank two free throws to make it 64-63, followed by two free throws by Dan Cage with 19.6 seconds remaining to put the Commodores ahead 65-64. But Jeff Green spoiled Vanderbilt's upset bid when he took five steps and then banked in an off-balance shot with 2.5 seconds left to give Georgetown a 66-65 victory. A very obvious traveling call was missed. Hibbert had a double-double (12 points and 10 rebounds), while Summers scored 15 points and had seven rebounds in the game, and Green also contributed 15 points.\nThe win over Vanderbilt put the Hoyas in the East Regional final – their first appearance in the \"Elite Eight\" since 1996 – where they met the region's top seed, North Carolina. It was the first postseason game between the teams since the 1981-82 Tar Heels win over the 1981-82 Hoyas 25 years earlier in the 1982 NCAA Championship Game. Georgetown jumped out to a 22-17 lead with 13:43 left in the first half, but the Tar Heels had reduced the deficit to 22-20 when a technical foul on John Thompson III for walking out of the coaching box allowed North Carolina to tie the game at 22-22 with two free throws. The momentum then shifted in North Carolina's favor, with the Tar Heels leading by as many as 10 points and having a 50-44 advantage at halftime. In the second half, North Carolina stretched its lead to 69-58 with 12:23 left to play. Georgetown had closed to six points behind when North Carolina's Deon Thompson tipped in a two-pointer to give the Tar Heels a 73-65 lead with 9:53 left in the second half. But then the Tar Heels′ offense collapsed, making only one more field goal – a two-point layup by Tyler Hansbrough with 1:41 left in the second half – during the next 15 minutes of play in the second half and overtime combined. The Hoyas meanwhile chipped away at the lead until Jonathan Wallace tied the game at 81-81 with a three-point jumper with 32 seconds left in the half. In overtime, the Hoyas scored 14 straight points to take a 95-81 lead while North Carolina's field goal drought continued until Ty Lawson scored North Carolina's only overtime points with a three-point jumper to make the score 95-84 with eight seconds left. The Tar Heels had missed 21 of their final 23 field goal attempts and Georgetown won 96-84, with all five Hoya starters scoring in double digits: Jeff Green had 22 points and nine rebounds, DaJuan Summers had 20 points and six rebounds, Jonathan Wallace scored 19, Jessie Sapp contributed 15, and Roy Hibbert had a double-double with 13 points and 11 rebounds.\nThe Hoyas, winners of 19 of their last 20 games, advanced to the Final Four for the first time since 1985 to meet No. 1 Ohio State, winner of 21 straight. The game featured a much-anticipated match-up of elite college centers – Ohio State's Greg Oden and Georgetown's Roy Hibbert – and during the game Oden had 13 points and nine rebounds, while Hibbert scored 19 points and pulled down six rebounds. But both centers got into early foul trouble and spent a great deal of time on the bench, with Oden playing for only three minutes in the first half and for only 20 in the game, while Hibbert played for only 24 minutes. Ohio State took better advantage of Hibbert's absences than Georgetown did of Oden's. Jonathan Wallace scored 19 points, Jessie Sapp contributed 10 points, and Jeff Green grabbed 12 rebounds, but Green – who entered the game averaging 15.8 points per game during the tournament – scored only nine points, going almost 17 minutes in the first half and 14 minutes in the second half without taking a shot. DaJuan Summers, who had scored 25 points in the previous two games, managed only three against the Buckeyes, and the Georgetown bench did not score a single point. Ohio State outrebounded the Hoyas 37-30 and scored 22 points off 14 Hoya turnovers. When Oden went to the bench with two fouls only three minutes into the game, not to return until the second half, Georgetown was leading 5-3, but the Buckeyes then went on an 11-2 run over the next six minutes to take a 14-7 lead. Thanks to Hibbert's work inside, Georgetown closed to a 15-14 deficit, but then Hibbert had to sit with two fouls, and Ohio State extended its lead to 25-17 with 3:32 left in the first half. Leading 27-23 at halftime, Ohio State trailed only once more, at 34-33 with 15:56 left in the game. The score was tied 44-44 with 9:44 left in the game, but Hibbert had to sit with four fouls only 20 seconds later, and Oden then helped the Buckeyes jump out to a 51-44 lead with 6:37 left from which the Hoyas never recovered. Ohio State won 67-60, advancing to the national championship game for the first time since 1962 and bringing Georgetown's season to an end.\nFor the season, Roy Hibbert shot 67.1 percent from the field and finished with 12.9 points per game, while Jonathan Wallace shot 50.7 percent from the field overall and 49.0 percent from three-point range, averaging 11.4 points per game. DaJuan Summers averaged 9.2 and Jessie Sapp 9.1 points per game. Jeff Green, sometimes criticized for being too unselfish with the ball and not shooting enough, nonetheless finished the season shooting 51.3 percent from the field and 37.5 percent from three-point range, averaging a team-leading 14.2 points per game. Selected as the 2007 Big East Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year, Jeff Green opted to forego his senior year of college and entered the National Basketball Association draft; he was drafted by the Boston Celtics, who traded him to the Seattle SuperSonics.\nAfter the season, Assistant Coach Sydney Johnson left the team to become the head coach at Princeton University. Assistant Coach Kevin Broadus also left to become the head coach at SUNY-Binghamton. Sophomore forward Octavius Spann announced in May that he would leave Georgetown and transfer to Marshall.\nGeorgetown finished the season ranked No. 8 in the Associated Press Poll and No.4 in the Coaches Poll, the team's highest finish in the AP Poll since 1996 and highest in the Coaches Poll since 1989. It was the best season of John Thompson III's 13-year tenure as Georgetown's head coach. In his remaining nine seasons at the helm, the Hoyas would appear in the NCAA tournament six more times, but would win only three NCAA tournament games, and never would advance beyond the tournament's first weekend.\nRoster.\nAfter sitting out a season following his transfer to Georgetown from Indiana, junior forward Patrick Ewing Jr., the son of Patrick Ewing, joined the team this season. He became only the second son of a former player to play for Georgetown, and the first to do so since Ed Hargaden Jr. – the son of Ed Hargaden, Georgetown's first All-American and star of the 1932-33, 1933-34, and 1934-35 teams – played during the 1957-58, 1958-59, and 1959-60 seasons.\nRankings.\nSource\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Big East tournament\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| NCAA tournament"

The 2011 Atlantic 10 men's basketball tournament was held for the fifth straight year at Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City, New Jersey.\nPreseason.\nIn the 2010 preseason, two new head coaches filled vacant Atlantic 10 positions. Fordham fired Dereck Whittenburg on December 3, 2009, and interim coach Jared Grasso was hired in Whittenburg's absence. The Rams finished the year 2–26, and Grasso was not retained. On March 25, 2010, Tom Pecora was hired from Hofstra, where he coached seven years to a 155–126 record. The Charlotte 49ers fired coach Bobby Lutz on March 15, despite being the team's all-time wins leader with a record of 218–158. In his final season, he led the team to a 19–12 mark but suffered a late season collapse and did not make the NCAA tournament or NIT. He was replaced by Alan Major, an assistant coach at Ohio State for six years, on April 9.\nAtlantic 10 media day was held on October 21, 2010. Temple was picked to win their fourth straight A-10 championship by coaches and the media. They received 19 first-place votes, and Xavier and Richmond received three first-place votes each, while Dayton was picked first on one ballot. Richmond's Kevin Anderson was the reigning player of the year, having won the honor in the 2009–10 Atlantic 10 Conference men's basketball season.\nPreseason watchlists.\nOn October 4, 2010, the Wooden Award preseason watch list was released, including three Atlantic 10 players. The watchlist was composed of 50 players who were not transfers, freshmen or medical redshirts. The list will be reduced to a 30-player mid-season watchlist in December and a final national ballot of about 20 players in March. The Naismith College Player of the Year watchlist of 50 players was announced on November 16, 2010. In late February, a shorter list of the top 30 players was compiled to prepare for a March vote to narrow the list to four finalists.\nConference awards &amp; honors.\nWeekly honors.\nThroughout the conference regular season, the Atlantic 10 offices name a player of the week and rookie of the week each Monday.\nNABC.\nThe National Association of Basketball Coaches announced their Division I AllDistrict teams on March 9 to recognize the best men's collegiate basketball student-athletes in the United States. Selected and voted on by member coaches of the NABC, 245 student-athletes were chosen from 24 districts. The selections on this list were then eligible for the State Farm Coaches' Division I All-America teams. The following list represented the Atlantic 10 players chosen to the list. Since District 4 comprised only Atlantic 10 Conference schools, this is equivalent to being named All-Atlantic 10 by the NABC.\nFirst Team\nSecond Team\nUSBWA.\nOn March 10, the U.S. Basketball Writers Association released its 2010–11 Men's All-District Teams, based on voting from its national membership. There were nine regions from coast to coast, and a player and coach of the year were selected in each. The following lists all the Atlantic 10 representatives selected within their respective regions.\nDistrict I (ME, VT, NH, RI, MA, CT)\nDistrict II (NY, NJ, DE, DC, PA, WV)\nDistrict III (VA, NC, SC, MD)\nNone Selected\nDistrict V (OH, IN, IL, MI, MN, WI)\nDistrict VI (IA, MO, KS, OK, NE, ND, SD)\nNone Selected\n2011 NBA draft.\nTwo Atlantic 10 players were selected in the 2011 NBA draft on June 23, both in the second round: Justin Harper and Lavoy Allen. Harper was selected with the 32nd pick by the Cleveland Cavaliers and subsequently traded to the Orlando Magic. With the 50th pick of the draft, the Philadelphia 76ers took Lavoy Allen. Tu Holloway declared for early entry in the draft but did not hire an agent and withdrew his name prior to the May 8 deadline."

        "text": "John Paul Fox (May 21, 1885 – June 28, 1963) was a professional baseball player whose career spanned 11 seasons, including one in Major League Baseball. During that one season in 1908, Fox played with the Philadelphia Athletics. Fox compiled a major league batting average of .200 with two runs, six hits and two stolen bases in nine games played. Fox also played in the minor leagues with the Class-C Poughkeepsie Colts (1906), the Class-B Albany Senators (1906–07), the Class-A Jersey City Skeeters (1908), the Class-A Memphis Egyptians (1908), the Class-B Wilkes-Barre Barons (1909), the Class-B Troy Trojans, the Class-A Lincoln Railsplitters (1910–11), the Class-B Harrisburg Senators (1912–14), the Class-D Bradford Drillers (1914) and the Class-B Scranton Miners (1915–16). He started his minor league career as an outfielder, but later converted into a pitcher. Fox compiled a career minor league batting average of .251 with 670 hits in 694 games played. As a pitcher, he compiled a win–loss record of 90–63 in 185 career minor league games pitched. Fox batted and threw right-handed.\nProfessional career.\nFox began his professional baseball career in 1906 with the Poughkeepsie Colts, who were members of the Class-C Hudson River League. With the Colts, he batted .179 with 60 hits in 337 at-bats. Fox committed four errors, 12 assists and 120 putouts in 136 total chances as an outfielder. Fox then joined the Class-B Albany Senators, who were members of the New York State League. In 135 games played with the Senators, Fox batted .268 with 136 hits. On defense, Fox played in the outfield and committed nine errors, 12 assists and 217 putouts in 238 total chances. Between the two clubs that season, he batted a combined .232 with 196 hits in 845 at-bats, and compiled a .965 fielding percentage as an outfielder. In 1907, Fox spent the entire season with Albany. He batted .276 with 106 hits in 114 games played that season.\nBefore the 1908 season, Fox was drafted by the Class-A Memphis Egyptians of the Southern Association. With the Egyptians, Fox batted .243 with 17 hits in 18 games played. Connie Mack, manager of the Philadelphia Athletics, acquired Fox from the Memphis club during early June. Fox's addition to the Athletics roster was due to a depleted outfield. On June 2, 1908, Fox made his major league debut. \"Sporting Life\" described it as an \"unimpressive\" debut. After suffering a hand injury in mid-June, Fox was unable to accompany the Athletics on a road trip. During his final game in the majors on June 20, Fox made a base running error that ended the Athletics comeback against the Cleveland Naps in the eighth inning. With the Athletics that season, Fox batted .200 with two runs, six hits and two stolen bases in nine games played. On defense, he played eight games in the outfield, committing one errors in 13 total chances. Fox finished the 1908 season with the Class-A Jersey City Skeeters of the Eastern League. In 57 games with the Skeeters, Fox batted .268 with 59 hits, nine doubles, four triples and two home runs.\nAfter the 1908 season, the National Commission ruled that Fox's contract was held by the Memphis Egyptians, the team which the Philadelphia Athletics acquired him from. The Egyptians promptly sold him to the Class-B Wilkes-Barre Barons of the New York State League. During the 1909 season, \"Sporting Life\" described the Wilkes-Barre trio of Fox, Delos Drake and Rube DeGroff as the best in the \"best outfielders in the league\". In late-July, the Barons traded Fox to the Class-A Troy Trojans. Fox batted a combined .271 with 131 hits in 129 games played between the two clubs. On defense, he played all of his 129 games as an outfielder. His hits total ranked 12 amongst New York State League batters that season.\nPersonal.\nFox was born on May 21, 1885, in Reading, Pennsylvania. He died in Reading on June 28, 1963, and was buried at Aulenbach's Cemetery in Mount Penn, Pennsylvania."

        "text": "Timothy Smith (born July 2, 1982) is an American former professional basketball player who played the point guard position. Smith played collegiately at East Tennessee State University (ETSU) from 2002–03 to 2005–06 before becoming a professional.\nBasketball career.\nCollege.\nWhen Tim Smith entered college in 2002, ETSU was still a member of the Southern Conference. As a freshman in 2002–03 he recorded 475 points, 114 assists and 73 steals. He was named the Southern Conference Freshman of the Year while guiding ETSU as runners-up in the conference's North Division. The Buccaneers also won the 2003 Southern Conference Tournament and earned an automatic berth into the NCAA Tournament, but lost to Wake Forest, 76 to 73, in the first round.\nAs a sophomore in 2003–04, Smith once again led ETSU to a successful season. He reached the career 1,000-point mark after finishing the year with 565 points, and he also recorded 145 assists and 82 steals. ETSU were Southern Conference regular season and tournament champions, but once again lost in the NCAA Tournament's first round by three points. Cincinnati defeated the Buccaneers, 80 to 77. For the second consecutive season, however, Smith was named to the Southern Conference All-Tournament First Team. He also led the team in scoring at 17.7 points per game and was named a First Team All-Conference honoree.\nIn 2004–05, Smith's junior year, he repeated as a Southern Conference First Team selection after recording 645 points, 123 assists and 62 steals. The Buccaneers struggled despite his 22.2 points per game average and only finished with a 10–19 overall record.\nEast Tennessee State University moved to the Atlantic Sun Conference between his junior and senior seasons. As a senior in 2005–06, Smith solidified his name in both the ETSU and NCAA record books. In 28 games he recorded 95 steals, good for a 3.39 steals per game average that led NCAA Division I. His 22.0 points per game average led ETSU for a third straight season, and his 615 points scored that season brought his career total to exactly 2,300, the most in school history.

However, he never appeared in a game for this club. The following year (2007–08) Smith signed with Gothia Basket in the Swedish Basketball League. In 11 games played, all of which he started, he averaged 17.9 points, 3.3 assists and 1.9 steals per game.\nHis best season across his professional career, occurred in 2008–09 as a member of Ciudad de Vigo Básquet in Spain's Liga Española de Baloncesto.

        "text": "Matthew Cody Moore (born June 18, 1989) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Los Angeles Angels of Major League Baseball (MLB). He has previously played in MLB for the Tampa Bay Rays, San Francisco Giants, Texas Rangers, Detroit Tigers, Philadelphia Phillies, Cleveland Guardians, and Miami Marlins and in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) for the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks.\nBorn in Fort Walton Beach, Florida, Moore's family moved to Okinawa when he was seven and Edgewood, New Mexico in 2000. Although he had committed to play college baseball with the University of New Mexico, Moore chose to sign a professional contract with the Rays after they selected him in the 2007 MLB draft. He set multiple strikeout records for the Rays' farm system before making his major league debut in 2011. Moore spent two full seasons with the Rays before Tommy John surgery caused him to miss the 2014 season. He returned in 2015, and was traded to the Giants the following year.\nMoore struggled with run control in his second season with the Giants, leading the National League in earned runs allowed, and was traded to the Rangers in the 2018 offseason. His earned run average (ERA) stayed high with the Rangers, and he was sent to the bullpen to focus on his technique. In 2019, the Tigers signed Moore to a one-year contract, hoping for a rebound season, but he played only two games before suffering a season-ending knee injury. Moore spent one year with the Japan Series-winning Hawks before returning to the US in 2021 to play with the Phillies.\nEarly life.\nMoore was born on June 18, 1989, in Fort Walton Beach, Florida. When he was seven years old, his family moved to Kadena Air Base in Okinawa, Japan, where his father was working on helicopters for the Air Force Special Operations Command. In 2000, Moore and his family moved to Edgewood, New Mexico, where his older brother Bobby was set to begin high school. Both brothers attended Moriarty High School and would practice pitching at home, on a mound in their backyard.\nMoore experienced a growth spurt between his sophomore and junior year of high school, which caught the attention of college recruiters and professional scouts. During his senior season, he helped take the Moriarty Pintos to a state runner-up title and was named Gatorade Player of the Year. Moore had committed to play college baseball at the University of New Mexico, his brother's alma mater, before he was taken by the Tampa Bay Rays of Major League Baseball (MLB) in the eighth round of the 2007 MLB Draft.\nProfessional career.\nMinor leagues.\nAfter being drafted 245th overall, Moore signed a $115,000 contract with the Rays in 2007. He debuted that year with the Rookie Princeton Rays at the age of 18. In his first minor league season, he had a 0–0 win–loss record, a 2.66 earned run average (ERA), and 29 strikeouts in 8 games and innings with the Rays. In 2008, he posted a 2–2 record, 1.66 ERA, and 77 strikeouts in innings. At the end of his first full season in 2008, Moore was named a \"Baseball America\" Rookie All-Star.\nIn 2009, Moore was assigned to the Class A Bowling Green Hot Rods for their inaugural season. He was selected to start the first game in Hot Rods history. On June 8, 2009, Moore was named the South Atlantic League Pitcher of the Week after throwing seven shutout innings in a 10–2 win over the Asheville Tourists. He went 8–5 for the season with a 3.15 ERA in 26 starts, and led the league with 176 strikeouts in 123 innings. The following year, Moore had a standout season with the Class A-Advanced Charlotte Stone Crabs. His 208 strikeouts in innings were the most in the Florida State League since Michael Cosgrove in 1971. Issues with pitch control, however, led to a 3.36 ERA and a 1.18 walks plus hits per inning pitched (WHIP). Mitch Lukevics, the Rays' director of minor-league operations, told FoxSports.com that, in both 2009 and 2010, Moore was \"off to a bad start, and the technique [was] not where it need[ed] to be\", but he found his stride over the course of the season.\nMoore started the 2011 season with the Double-A Montgomery Biscuits. On June 16, he pitched his first career no-hitter, and the first franchise no-hitter for the Biscuits, in an 8–0 victory against the Mobile BayBears. That July, he pitched an inning at the XM Futures Game, retiring all three batters he faced in 11 pitches that reached up to . Shortly afterwards, on July 22, he was promoted to the Triple-A Durham Bulls. He went 12–3 for the season, with a 1.92 ERA in 155 innings across 27 starts. Moore's 210 strikeouts were the most of any minor league player in Rays history, breaking his own record from the previous season, and made him the first minor league pitcher to record 200 or more strikeouts in back-to-back seasons.\nTampa Bay Rays.\nMoore was called up to the Rays on September 11, 2011, and made his MLB debut three days later, giving up a two-run home run to Matt Wieters in the eighth inning of a 6–2 loss against the Baltimore Orioles. His performance recovered in time for his first major league start on September 22, becoming the first pitcher in MLB history to pitch 11 strikeouts in five innings or fewer against the New York Yankees. The Rays went on to win 15–8. Moore was given the start in Game 1 of the 2011 American League Division Series (ALDS) against the Texas Rangers, pitching seven shutout innings in a 9–0 victory for the Rays. Moore finished his first major league season with a 1–0 record and a 2.89 ERA in innings.\nOn December 9, 2011, the Rays signed Moore to a guaranteed five-year, $14 million contract. His signing was part of a trend within the Rays organization of offering long-term contracts to young pitchers, but his contract was the largest ever in both guaranteed dollars and potential earnings for any pitcher with less than two years of service time.\nMoore began with the Rays in 2012 as part of a five-player starting rotation that also included James Shields, David Price, Jeremy Hellickson, and Jeff Niemann. On June 15, Moore combined with relievers Burke Badenhop and Brandon Gomes to pitch a one-hit shutout against the Miami Marlins, winning 11–0 and breaking a three-game losing streak. The Rays gave away a bobblehead figure of Moore on their July 22 game against the Seattle Mariners after the pitcher went 5–1 with a 3.94 ERA in eight starts in June and July. Moore finished the season with an 11–11 record, a 3.81 ERA, and 175 strikeouts in 31 appearances and innings.\nReturning to the Rays in 2013, Moore became the first left-handed American League (AL) pitcher to begin a season with an 8–0 record at age 23 or younger since Babe Ruth in 1917. After a strong beginning to the season, Moore began to falter, going 0–3 with a 13.86 ERA in his next three starts. He recovered in time to be named to his first ever MLB All-Star Game as a replacement for Yu Darvish, who suffered a strained trapezius. At the time, Moore was tied with Max Scherzer for the most wins in the AL with 13. He pitched for the AL in the fifth inning of the All-Star Game, retiring Carlos González, Yadier Molina, and Troy Tulowitzki in only nine pitches. Moore left a July 28 game against the New York Yankees in the fifth inning with a sore left elbow, and was placed on the 15-day disabled list on July 31. He posted a 17–4 record and a 3.29 ERA that season in 27 appearances and innings.\nElbow troubles followed Moore into 2014. He exited the mound in the middle of an April 7 game against the Kansas City Royals, and realized after an afternoon throwing session that he could no longer pitch. Moore underwent Tommy John surgery on April 22, 2014 to replace a partially torn ulnar collateral ligament, and was sidelined for the remainder of the season. In the 10 innings that he did pitch that season, Moore was 0–2 and allowed three runs.\nMoore began the 2015 season on the 60-day disabled list while recovering from surgery. He began pitching in June, making a series of minor-league rehab assignments for Durham. On June 28, 2015, rookie Matt Andriese was optioned to Durham, presumably to make room in the rotation for Moore. He returned to the Rays on July 2, 2015, giving up six hits and four runs in innings against the Cleveland Indians. He struggled in his first six starts, posting an 8.78 ERA and never pitching past the fifth inning, and was optioned to Durham to focus on improvement. There, Moore recorded a 3.57 ERA in innings. On August 23, he struck out 16 Columbus Clippers batters, setting a franchise single-game record. He was called back up to the Rays on September 2, and finished the season with a 3–4 record and a 5.43 ERA in 12 starts and 63 innings.\nGoing into the 2016 MLB season, Moore was given the start for the Rays' exhibition game against the Cuban national team. The Rays won 4–1 in the first visit by an MLB team to Cuba since 1999, and Barack Obama, who was in attendance, was given one of Moore's gloves. He seemed to return to pre-surgery form in the early part of the season, striking out 27.1 percent of the batters he faced in April. His curveball, in particular, resulted in only five hits in 105 pitches. In 21 starts and 130 innings with the Rays in 2016, Moore was 7–7 with a 4.08 ERA.\nSan Francisco Giants.\nOn August 1, 2016, the Rays traded Moore to the San Francisco Giants in exchange for third baseman Matt Duffy and prospects Lucius Fox and Michael Santos. After reports emerged that Moore would be wearing 55 with the Giants, the number he had worn with the Rays &amp; a number that had previously belonged to pitcher Tim Lincecum, Moore and the team had to quiet upset fans by saying that he would be No. 45 instead.\nMoore debuted with the club on August 4, giving up two runs and six walks in six innings. The Giants won 3–2 against the Philadelphia Phillies in the 10th inning. That same month, on August 26, Moore came within one out of a no-hitter against the Los Angeles Dodgers, throwing seven strikeouts in innings. Dodgers shortstop Corey Seager hit a single in the bottom of the ninth inning, and reliever Santiago Casilla came in to pitch the final out of the Giants' 4–0 win. It would have been the fifth season in a row that a member of the Giants' pitching rotation threw a no-hitter. In the postseason, Moore pitched eight innings in Game 4 of the 2016 National League Division Series (NLDS). Giants manager Bruce Bochy pulled Moore before the final inning, and the Chicago Cubs overcame a 5–2 deficit to win the game and the series. Moore finished 2016 with a cumulative 13–12 record, 4.08 ERA, and 178 strikeouts in innings.\nThe 2017 season proved to be the worst of Moore's career. He went 6–15 with a career high 5.52 ERA in innings and 31 starts, gave up 27 home runs, and led the National League in earned runs allowed with 107. In addition to having the worst ERA among MLB pitchers with at least 162 innings, left-handed batters hit a .373 batting average against him, the highest in the league, and his allowance of 80 extra-base hits was the second-highest in the NL. Moore attributed some of his troubles to an over-reliance on his cut fastball, which he threw more that season than his other pitches.\nTexas Rangers.\nOn December 15, 2017, the Giants traded Moore to the Texas Rangers in exchange for pitching prospects Sam Wolff and Israel Cruz. After feeling discomfort in his knee during spring training, Moore was placed on the 10-day disabled list on May 19, 2018. At the time, he was 1–5 with a 7.99 ERA in 10 games with the Rangers. He continued to struggle upon his return, carrying a 7.88 ERA by mid-June, and was moved to the bullpen to focus on improving his pitching technique. Prospect Yohander Mendez took Moore's place in the Rangers' starting rotation. He finished the season with a 3–8 record, a 6.79 ERA, and 86 strikeouts in 39 games and 102 innings with the Rangers. Moore's contract lapsed at the end of the 2018 season, leaving him a free agent.\nDetroit Tigers.\nOn December 4, 2018, the Detroit Tigers signed Moore to a one-year, $2.5 million contract in anticipation that he would follow Mike Fiers as a low-risk pitcher heading into a rebound season. On April 6, 2019, however, in only his second start of the season, Moore exited the mound three innings into a game against the Kansas City Royals, having sprained his right knee while attempting to field a bunt from Royals batter Billy Hamilton. He underwent meniscus surgery on April 14, and three days later, Tigers manager Ron Gardenhire announced that Moore would miss the rest of the MLB season. Prior to his injury, Moore pitched ten shutout innings for the Tigers.\nFukuoka SoftBank Hawks.\nOn December 26, 2019, Moore signed a one-year, () contract with the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB), who were looking to rebuild their pitching rotation after losing Ariel Miranda and Robert Suárez. He was part of a six-man rotation for the Hawks, who won the Pacific League by 14 games. Moore pitched seven shutout innings, including five strikeouts, in Game 3 of the 2020 Japan Series, and the Hawks came within one out of a combined no-hitter in their 4–0 victory over the Yomiuri Giants. He finished the season with a 2.65 ERA in 15 starts with the Hawks. Because professional baseball returned to play in Japan earlier than in the US, Moore was able to pitch 85 innings in 2020, one more than MLB season leader Lance Lynn.\nPhiladelphia Phillies.\nOn February 3, 2021, Moore signed a one-year, $3 million contract with the Phillies. He was the first left-handed starting pitcher to begin a season with the Phillies since Cole Hamels in 2015. In his first three starts with the Phillies, Moore pitched to a 9.82 ERA, with nine walks in only 11 innings. His poor performance, coupled with time spent on the COVID-19 protocol list, led to his removal from the starting rotation and replacement with veteran Phillies pitcher Vince Velasquez. Back spasms caused Moore to miss over a month of pitching, from May 20 to June 25, at which point he was reactivated to start the second game of a doubleheader against the Mets. On July 16, in the first game of a doubleheader against the Miami Marlins, Moore struck out nine batters in innings; it was the first time that he had fanned that many since 2017, in a game against the Washington Nationals. Despite struggles in recent starts, Phillies manager Joe Girardi gave Moore a start against the Cincinnati Reds on August 11. Moore no-hit the Reds through 6 innings, throwing only 76 pitches while walking 2, but was removed in the 7th. The combined no-hit bid ended in the 8th when Archie Bradley gave up a solo homerun to Tyler Stephenson. Moore would however earn the win as the Phillies won the game 6–1. Moore finished the 2021 season with a 2–4 record and a 6.29 ERA.\nTexas Rangers (second stint).\nOn March 14, 2022, Moore signed a minor league contract with the Rangers. He opened the 2022 season with the Round Rock Express, and Texas selected his contract to the active roster on April 16. Moore spent the 2022 season as a reliever and excelled in the new role, posting a 5–2 record with a 1.95 ERA and 83 strikeouts over 74 innings in 63 appearances.\nLos Angeles Angels.\nOn February 16, 2023, Moore signed a 1-year deal with the Los Angeles Angels worth $7.55 million. In 41 appearances for the Angels, he logged a 2.66 ERA with 49 strikeouts in 44.0 innings of work. He was placed on waivers by the team on August 29.\nCleveland Guardians.\nOn August 31, 2023, the Cleveland Guardians claimed Moore off waivers. In 5 games for the Guardians, Moore registered a 3.86 ERA with 8 strikeouts in innings of work.\nMiami Marlins.\nOn September 19, 2023, Moore was claimed off waivers by the Miami Marlins. He made three scoreless appearances for Miami before he was designated for assignment on October 1. On October 5, Moore elected free agency.\nLos Angeles Angels (second stint).\nOn January 27, 2024, Moore signed a one-year, $9 million contract to return to the Angels.\nPitcher profile.\nEarly in his career, sports journalists predicted that Moore would become the Rays' ace because of his strong pitch repertoire and velocity. \"Baseball America\" and Keith Law of ESPN both ranked Moore second among all 2012 prospects, behind Bryce Harper, while MLB.com placed him in the third slot, behind Harper and Mike Trout. After returning from Tommy John surgery, however, Moore struggled with his pitch velocity and control, giving up large numbers of earned runs as he threw balls at hittable speeds and strike zone locations. His time in the NPB showed an improved performance, and Phillies manager Joe Girardi was keen to sign Moore in the hopes that he would add depth to the back end of the Phillies' starting rotation, serving as a player who has \"pitched in tough situations\" and could contend with aces Aaron Nola and Zack Wheeler.\nMoore utilizes a four-pitch repertoire consisting of a four-seam fastball, an changeup, an curveball, and an cut fastball. He and reliever Dellin Betances are known for having a unique grip on their four-seam fastball, in which they tuck their thumb under the ball, which some sports journalists and fellow pitchers believe negatively impacts their pitch control. Moore's most consistent flaw has been his walk total; in 2013, his best season statistically, he walked 76 batters in 150 innings.\nPersonal life.\nIn the offseason, Moore lives with his wife Anna, a labor and delivery nurse, and their son in Scottsdale, Arizona. Their son was born in February 2019 in Tampa.\nMoore is Catholic. He has a tattoo on his left shoulder of Saint Michael, his sponsor saint at his Confirmation."

        "text": "James C. Kennedy (April 1862 – April 20, 1904) was a 19th-century manager in professional baseball. He managed the Brooklyn Gladiators of the American Association, considered a major league, during the season.\nBiography.\nKennedy was born in New York City in April 1862; as a young man he worked for \"The New York Times\", becoming a baseball reporter; by 1884, he was also an official scorer. He served as the secretary of the Central League, a minor league that only played one season, . Outside of baseball, Kennedy helped organize some racewalking events.\nOne effect of the formation of the short-lived Players' League in was that the American Association needed an eighth team—Kennedy was able to secure a franchise, for which he served as the team's manager. The Brooklyn Gladiators, despite the name, actually played home games at ballparks in Queens and northern Manhattan. The team, using mainly older players or players released from other teams, had a record of 26–73, a .263 winning percentage. The Gladiators did not finish the season, as they disbanded in late August and were replaced by the Baltimore Orioles.\nAfter his brief time with the Gladiators, Kennedy became involved in staging bicycle races and boxing matches. He died in April 1904 from a heart attack, likely related to his obesity, while en route from his home in Brooklyn to Manhattan via train."

        "title": "Relocation of Wimbledon F.C. to Milton Keynes",
        "text": "Wimbledon Football Club relocated to Milton Keynes in September 2003, 16 months after receiving permission to do so from the Football Association on the basis of a two-to-one decision in favour by an FA-appointed independent commission. The move took the team from south London, where it had been based since its foundation in 1889, to Milton Keynes, a new town in Buckinghamshire, about to the northwest of the club's traditional home district Wimbledon. Hugely controversial, the move's authorisation prompted disaffected Wimbledon supporters to form AFC Wimbledon, a new club, on 30 May 2002. The relocated team played home matches in Milton Keynes under the Wimbledon name from September 2003 until June 2004, when following the end of the 2003–04 season it renamed itself Milton Keynes Dons F.C. (MK Dons).\nWimbledon F.C. spent most of its history in non-League football before being elected to the Football League in 1977. A series of club owners believed that its long-term potential was limited by its home ground at Plough Lane, which never changed significantly from the team's non-League days. Meanwhile, the Milton Keynes Development Corporation envisaged a stadium in the town hosting top-flight football and was keen on the idea of an established League team relocating there. The Wimbledon chairman Ron Noades briefly explored moving Wimbledon to Milton Keynes in 1979, but decided it would not lead to larger crowds. Charlton Athletic briefly mooted a relocation in 1973, and in the 1980s the Milton Keynes Development Corporation offered a new ground to Luton Town, who almost became \"MK Hatters\".\nWimbledon rose through the professional divisions unusually rapidly in what has been called a \"fairytale\". By 1986, they had reached the First Division, the top-flight of English football. In 1991, after the Taylor Report ordered the redevelopment of English football grounds, the team entered a groundshare at Crystal Palace's Selhurst Park stadium, about east of Plough Lane. This was supposed to be a temporary arrangement while the Wimbledon chairman Sam Hammam sought a new stadium site in south-west London, but this search proved frustratingly long, both for Hammam and the club's fans. Much to the anger of most Wimbledon supporters, Hammam proposed new locations for the team outside London, including the Irish capital Dublin. He sold the club to two Norwegian businessmen, Kjell Inge Røkke and Bjørn Rune Gjelsten, in 1997 and the following year sold Plough Lane for a supermarket redevelopment.\nStarting in 1997 a consortium led by Pete Winkelman proposed a large retail development in Milton Keynes including a Football League-standard stadium, and offered this site to Luton, Wimbledon, Barnet, Crystal Palace and Queens Park Rangers. Røkke and Gjelsten appointed a new chairman, Charles Koppel, who announced on 2 August 2001 that Wimbledon intended to relocate to Milton Keynes. Koppel said the club would otherwise go out of business. After the League refused permission, Koppel launched an appeal, leading to an FA arbitration hearing and subsequently the appointment of a three-man independent commission by the FA in May 2002 to make a final and binding verdict. The League and FA stated opposition but the commissioners ruled in favour, two to one. The vast majority of the team's fans switched allegiance to AFC Wimbledon in protest. Wimbledon F.C.'s relocation was delayed for over a year by the lack of an interim ground in Milton Keynes meeting Football League standards. In June 2003 the club went into administration; Winkelman's consortium injected funds to keep it operating and paid for the renovation of the National Hockey Stadium in Milton Keynes, where the team played its first match in September 2003. Winkelman's Inter MK Group bought the relocated club in 2004 and concurrently changed its name, badge and colours. The team's new ground, Stadium MK, opened three years later. MK Dons initially claimed Wimbledon F.C.'s heritage and history, but officially renounced this in 2007. AFC Wimbledon received planning permission for a new ground on Plough Lane in 2015, which they eventually moved into ahead of the 2020–21 season.\nBackground.\nMilton Keynes.\nMilton Keynes, in northern Buckinghamshire, was established by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government as a new town on 23 January 1967. Named after the village of Milton Keynes already present on the site, it was formed primarily as a London overspill settlement following the recommendations of governmental studies in 1964 and 1965 to build \"a new city\" in Buckinghamshire incorporating existing towns such as Bletchley, Stony Stratford and Wolverton. This site was chosen as it was equidistant from London and Birmingham, close to main roads and railways, and near Luton Airport. About 40,000 people lived on the Milton Keynes site before 1967; the government set a target population of 250,000.\nWhen Milton Keynes was founded, no football club within its boundaries was professional and none played in the Football League. The teams most advanced in the English football league system or \"pyramid\" were the United Counties League sides Bletchley Town and Wolverton Town &amp; B.R., and Stony Stratford Town of the South Midlands League; New Bradwell St Peter and Newport Pagnell Wanderers (Newport Pagnell Town from 1972) would join the South Midlands League in 1970 and 1972 respectively. Nevertheless, the Milton Keynes Development Corporation, created by the government to oversee the town's planning and construction, envisaged a stadium in Milton Keynes capable of accommodating a top-flight football team.\nAccession to the Football League; club relocation in English football.\nIn English football, the relocation of teams away from their traditional districts is unusual because of the nature of the relationship between clubs and their fans: the local football club is regarded by most English football supporters as part of the local identity and social fabric rather than as a business that can be transplanted by its owners at will. As a result, any relocation plan would be strongly opposed by fans in the club's original area, and unlikely to succeed in most new locations due to the existence of established teams in most towns and cities that would already have secured the loyalty of local football fans. John Bale, summarising a study published in 1974, writes that, in the view of most fans, \"Chelsea would simply not be Chelsea\" were that club to move a few miles within the same borough to Wormwood Scrubs.\nThe geographic redistribution of the 92 Football League teams was considered a possible eventuality by some around that time, including Sir Norman Chester, who headed an investigation into the condition of English football in 1968. Before the 1986–87 season, clubs could not be relegated out of the League's Fourth Division. The bottom four clubs had to apply for re-election by the other member clubs at the end of each season, alongside any non-League teams who wished to take their place, but the replacement of an established League side in this way was quite rare. From the inaugural post-war season (1946–47) through to 1985–86, clubs already in the League were supplanted on only six occasions. \"New communities have developed ... which lack clubs in League membership,\" Chester reported, in 1968. \"Amalgamations of old clubs would provide vacancies for new clubs to enter the League\". Merging football clubs in England has been described as \"anathema\" to the fans. Moore concluded \"Merged clubs lose fans as well as gain them. If formed way back, “Bristol United\" would probably have fared better than either [Bristolian clubs] City or Rovers have done independently, but there is too much history and animosity to merge now.\". \"Alternatively\", Chester also added, \"the movement of established clubs to new communities could provide a way both of saving old clubs and at the same time bringing League football to new and growing areas.\" Closely fitting this description, Milton Keynes provided a clear staging ground for such an experiment.\nAt the end of the 1978–79 season, 20 leading non-League clubs left the Southern League and the Northern Premier League to form the Alliance Premier League. This national non-League division started in the 1979–80 season; it was called the Football Conference from 1986 to 2015, when it became the National League. Since the 1986–87 season, the champions of this league have received promotion to the Football League, with the League's bottom club being relegated in exchange. This was expanded to the Conference champions and the winners of a promotion play-off before the 2002–03 season, with the worst two Football League clubs being relegated. The situation of the Football League \"closed shop\", which for nearly a century effectively barred most non-League clubs from accession, therefore no longer exists. Any club in the English football pyramid (which also includes some clubs from Wales) can potentially win enough promotions to reach the Football League or the Premier League, the separate top division formed in 1992.\nPrecursors in Scottish and English football.\nAccording to the Football League's statement to the independent commission on Wimbledon F.C. in May 2002, the English League \"had allowed temporary relocations for good reasons outside 'conurbations' in respect of certain clubs where it was intended the club would return, but there has been no previous occasion on which the Football League had granted permission to a club to relocate permanently to a ground outside its 'conurbation'.\" Clubs in the English professional ranks that have relocated to other locales within their traditional conurbations include Manchester United and Woolwich Arsenal, who moved and respectively in 1910 and 1913. South Shields of the Third Division North relocated west to Gateshead in 1930 and renamed themselves Gateshead A.F.C. The commission reported that there was no Football League precedent for a move between conurbations, but stressed that there was direct precedent for such a move in Scotland.\nPromotion and relegation in and out of the Scottish Professional Football League was not introduced until the league system's reorganisation in 2014; until then it was nearly impossible for sides outside the League to join. Scottish League membership therefore remained largely restricted to well-established cities as opposed to new towns. Two Scottish League teams left their metropolitan districts for new towns during the 1990s. Third-flight club Clyde moved from Shawfield Stadium (close to Rutherglen in the south-east of Glasgow) to the new town of Cumbernauld, about to the north-east, in 1994, and a year later Meadowbank Thistle, a struggling Edinburgh club in the fourth tier, relocated amid fans' protests about west to another new town, Livingston. Clyde kept their original name, while Meadowbank renamed themselves Livingston Football Club.\nIn English non-League football, events surrounding Enfield F.C. have been latterly described as mirroring what was to occur at Wimbledon. Enfield's owner Tony Lazarou sold the club's ground at Southbury Road in 1999 and arranged several short-term groundshares before resettling Enfield west in Borehamwood—temporarily, he said, while he looked for a new stadium in Enfield. Two years later, after no site had been identified and a dispute had developed regarding an escrow account, the Enfield Supporters' Trust resolved in June 2001 that Lazarou lacked sufficient will to bring the club back to Enfield and so founded a new team, Enfield Town, which based itself locally and won the support of much of the original Enfield fanbase. In a similar case in 2012, the supporters' trust affiliated to Northwich Victoria broke away to form 1874 Northwich. In each of these cases, Stephen Mumford comments in his 2013 work \"Watching Sport: Aesthetics, Ethics and Emotion\", \"supporters have agonised over where their allegiance properly lies\".\nEarly Milton Keynes relocation proposals.\nCharlton Athletic (1973).\nThe south-east London club Charlton Athletic were linked with a move to \"a progressive Midlands borough\" in 1973, a year after Charlton's relegation to the third tier. The Gliksten family, which owned Charlton from 1932 to 1982 and had a history of proposing elaborate schemes for the club, revealed plans to build a community sports complex at The Valley, and to hold a public market at the ground on weekdays. Greenwich Council refused to license the market and insisted that the complex be built on public space at a local park. The club reacted by announcing the proposed move to the Midlands. Fans inundated the local media and club offices with strong opinion against a move, prompting Charlton to print a statement in 14 April 1973 matchday programme telling fans that the proposed move was because of the council's attitude regarding the market and complex plans, which the team said threatened its future. \"You, the supporters, can make sure the club continues in Charlton by protesting as loud as you can to Greenwich Council over their refusal to grant us permission for our plans,\" the message explained. No permanent relocation occurred, but the capacity of the Valley was slashed repeatedly in the following years: to 20,000 in 1975 and to 13,000 in 1981.\nCharlton were made homeless in September 1985 when they began groundsharing with Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park. Maguire claims that Greenwich Council and some factions of the club wished to see Charlton move miles away from the Valley to the Blackwall Peninsula, though this was unpopular as that area is \"closer to Millwall territory\" while also concluding \"this would arguably have hampered the club's future growth\". After supporters fielded candidates in the 1990 local elections as the Valley Party, getting a 10.9% share (14,838 votes) a return was approved on 2 April 1991. In August 1991 they moved in with West Ham United at the Boleyn Ground, better known by its eponym district Upton Park. Finally, on 5 December 1992, Charlton had their first match back at the Valley, a 1–0 win over Portsmouth.\nWimbledon (1979).\nThe south-west London club Wimbledon, traditionally a semi-professional non-League side, won three successive Southern League championships between 1975 and 1977 and were thereupon elected into the Football League. Nicknamed \"the Dons\", they proceeded to perform strongly in fully professional football, winning promotion to the then-top flight First Division for the 1986–87 season. The club's swift \"fairytale\" rise from obscurity through the English football pyramid caused it to reach a level of prominence far above that suggested by its modest home stadium at Plough Lane, which remained largely unchanged from the club's non-League days. Wimbledon's record attendance at Plough Lane—18,000, set \"in the 1930s against a team of sailors from HMS \"Victory\"\"—was never broken during 14 League seasons at the ground, including five in the top flight.\nRon Noades, who purchased the club for £2,782 in 1976, came to see Plough Lane as a potential limitation by 1979. He surmised that it could only attract a relatively small number of fans because of its location, close to large areas of sparsely populated parkland. Noades's interest was piqued by the site the Milton Keynes Development Corporation had earmarked for a stadium next to the town's still-under-construction Central railway station. \"They were very keen to get a Football League club, effectively a franchise if you like, into Milton Keynes to take up that site,\" Noades said in a 2001 interview. Planning to move Wimbledon there by amalgamating with an established Milton Keynes club, Noades purchased debt-ridden Southern League club Milton Keynes City (MK City; formerly Bletchley Town) for £1. He and three other Wimbledon directors—Jimmy Rose, Bernie Coleman and Sam Hammam—were promptly voted onto MK City's board \"in an advisory capacity\". This was a separate personal investment by the four directors, Noades said at the time, and not relevant to a move, though he also spoke at length about what he saw as the superior long-term promise of the Milton Keynes location.\nDespite his early optimism, Noades soon came to the conclusion that a League club in Milton Keynes would not draw crowds much higher than those Wimbledon already attracted in south London. \"I couldn't really see us getting any bigger gates than what Northampton Town were currently getting at that time, and, in fact, are still getting,\" he recalled in 2001. \"I really couldn't see any future in it. I can't actually see that there is a means of drawing large attendances to Milton Keynes.\" Abandoning his interest in MK City, Noades sold Wimbledon to Hammam in 1981 for £40,000. Later that year Noades bought nearby Crystal Palace and briefly explored merging that club with Wimbledon.\nLuton Town—\"MK Hatters\" (1980s).\nLuton Town, based from Milton Keynes in Luton and nicknamed \"the Hatters\", were also seeking a new site at this time. As early as 1960, then-First Division Luton's attendances had been deemed far too low for the top flight by \"Charles Buchan's Football Monthly\", which also considered their ground at Kenilworth Road, in the middle of town, to be hard to get to. At this time the club was already planning a 50,000-capacity ground near Dunstable, to the north-west of Luton, but no new ground materialised. Luton were relegated in 1960 and, apart from the 1974–75 season, remained outside of the top division until 1982–83.\nWith the team still based at the \"cramped and inadequate\" Kenilworth Road in 1983, the construction of a new road next to the ground escalated the need for a replacement. The Milton Keynes Development Corporation approached Luton proposing a new all-seater stadium in central Milton Keynes, housing either 18,000 or 20,000 spectators, as part of a leisure and retail development. Luton's owners were receptive to the idea; according to \"The Luton News\", the relocated \"MK Hatters\" would play home matches in a \"super-stadium\". This ground would reportedly have an artificial pitch and a roof; Milton Keynes Council would invest heavily in its construction. The Luton chairman Denis Mortimer surmised if the team moved it would not only garner new fans from the Milton Keynes area but also retain the existing Luton fanbase. He said that the club was financially unsustainable at Kenilworth Road and would go bankrupt if it did not move.\nThe Milton Keynes idea was very poorly received by Luton fans and viewed, in Bale's words, as \"tearing the club from its most loyal supporters\". Luton fans held protest marches and rallies throughout the 1983–84 season, and chartered a plane to fly over Kenilworth Road during one match pulling a banner reading \"Keep Luton Town F.C. in Luton\". Some 18,000 Luton residents signed a petition against the club leaving. A consortium of local businessmen attempted to persuade Vauxhall Motors, General Motors' Luton-based British marque, to invest in the club and help with a new stadium in Luton. In Milton Keynes, some residents expressed fears that Luton's arrival in central Milton Keynes might bring with it football hooliganism and threaten local amenities. Some Luton supporters boycotted the club's first home match of the 1984–85 season in protest against the Milton Keynes plans. The wide unpopularity of the proposed move and the consistently vehement opposition from Luton's local support combined to prevent it from occurring. \"The directors want our support and our money,\" said Tom Hunt, a member of a Luton fans' action group against the move, \"but they ignore the views of a community that wants to keep its football club. Why should fans pay at the turnstiles to help the club in business so that it can be taken away from us?\"\nWimbledon leave Plough Lane.\nTaylor Report.\nWimbledon's success as a club in the top flight of English football was founded on unorthodox financial management and judicious dealings in the transfer market, with many players being sold for fees ranging from six figures to £2 million or more between 1987 and 1992. Rumours of a move or a merger with another London side persisted, leading the club's chief executive Colin Hutchinson to resign in 1987 amid talk of an amalgamation with Ron Noades's new club Crystal Palace or a groundshare at Queens Park Rangers' Loftus Road ground in Shepherd's Bush. It later emerged that Charlton Athletic, who had been Palace's tenants from 1985 until 1991, were woven into the bargain too, to potentially create a \"South London super club\". Wimbledon were granted planning permission to build a 20,000-seater ground in their home borough of Merton in 1988, soon after they won the FA Cup, but the site was instead made into a car park by a newly elected Labour council in 1990. Wimbledon's desire to move was made a necessity in January 1990, when the Taylor Report, which ordered the extensive redevelopment of football grounds, was released - Plough Lane was deemed unsuitable for redevelopment as a sustainable top flight all-seater stadium.\nWhen Hammam purchased the club from Noades in 1981, Wimbledon also owned the ground at Plough Lane; a pre-emption clause existed, however, which reserved the site for \"sports, leisure or recreational purposes\" only. If Wimbledon Football Club were ever wound up, Plough Lane's owners were legally bound to sell the stadium to Merton Council for £8,000, irrespective of inflation. This clause reduced the possibility of the club losing its home stadium, but it was unpopular with a succession of Wimbledon owners as it made the site practically worthless as real estate. Hammam complained that this limited his ability to borrow money needed to redevelop the ground. Seeking to increase Plough Lane's commercial value, Hammam entered into negotiations with the council to remove the clause in 1990; the eventual agreed price for the revoking of the clause was a sum between £300,000 and £800,000. At least one Wimbledon club director resigned his position in protest.\nEven with this clause removed, the team could not afford to redevelop Plough Lane when required to do so the following year. Wimbledon moved about across south London before the start of the 1991–92 season to share Crystal Palace's Selhurst Park ground. This was supposed to be a temporary arrangement while Wimbledon arranged the construction of their own new ground in a more local area, but the move was still unpopular among fans - and the arrangement would ultimately last for over a decade, and would ultimately have a very different outcome to the one which was widely expected in 1991. Critics alleged that it was at least partly motivated by financial considerations, particularly the profit that might be gained from selling the old ground. The respective Wimbledon and Crystal Palace reserve teams groundshared at Plough Lane after the Wimbledon first team left.\nWimbledon at Selhurst Park; Dublin and Belfast proposals.\nMerton Council had been recommending that Wimbledon move to a site in nearby Beddington, but this proposal fell through soon after the move to Selhurst Park. With the inflation in costs brought on by the foundation of the FA Premier League in 1992, the club soon began to lose money heavily. Rumours that the groundshare would eventually result in the Dons and the Eagles merging led Hammam to say \"I’d rather die and have vultures eat my insides than merge with Crystal Palace\". In 1992 the Greyhound Racing Association offered to redevelop Wimbledon Stadium (less than a mile from Plough Lane) into a 15,000-seater dog racing and football ground. Hammam was outraged two years later when the council, attempting to retain the Plough Lane site for public use, refused to sanction its sale for a supermarket redevelopment that Hammam said would finance a new ground at the dog racing site. Hammam angrily declared he would look elsewhere, and threatened to change the club's name and remove the double-headed eagle device, a symbol of Wimbledon Borough, from the team's badge. \"We have been betrayed,\" he told the press. \"The council say they want us back, but when it comes to taking action they don't want to know.\" In 2023 it was revealed in a note dated 1997 that the former British Prime Minister Tony Blair endorsed the idea of Wimbledon FC relocating to the city of Belfast in Northern Ireland and being rebranded as Belfast United.\nHammam later claimed to have looked at every possible stadium site in Merton. He initially sought to relocate within south London, examining \"seven boroughs\" including Tolworth and Brixton. He also began to consider selling the club. In 1994, Wimbledon's Irish manager Joe Kinnear contacted the football pundit and former player Eamon Dunphy to inform him of this and to put to him the idea of moving the club to Dublin. Dunphy was enthusiastic about the idea and became its main proponent in Ireland over the next three years. It was suggested that Wimbledon fans from London could be given free flights to Dublin for home matches, and that British Sky Broadcasting might pay to fly the opposing teams there during the first season.\nOpinion polls in the Republic showed consistently high support for the idea of Wimbledon hosting Premier League matches in Dublin, but the League of Ireland argued that this would endanger its existence, and in September 1996 about 300 fans rallied in Dublin under the slogan \"Resist the Dublin Dons\". Twenty Irish clubs \"reaffirmed their opposition\" to Wimbledon playing in Dublin the following month; a week later Reuters called the proposal \"dead and buried\". When Hammam requested talks with the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) top brass in April 1997, they refused to meet him. Vocal opposition from Wimbledon fans emerged—after a friendly match in August 1997 fans holding \"Dublin = Death\" and \"Dons Belong in Merton\" placards refused to leave the stadium for two hours. Soon afterwards, Hammam met six leading protesters, who told him that in the event of a move they would start a new non-League club locally.\nPlaying away from Merton at a supposedly temporary home, Wimbledon set a record for the lowest-ever English top-flight attendance on 22 August 1992 with 3,759 watching the clash with Coventry City, before breaking it twice more: 12 December 1992 against Oldham Athletic with 3,386, and finally on 26 January 1993, drawing only 3,039 fans to a Tuesday-night match against Everton, with reportedly 1,500 travelling from Liverpool. All ten of the Premier League's lowest attendances were Wimbledon home matches in the 1992–93 and 1993–94 seasons. However the general trend was one of a sharp rise—the club's average home attendance more than doubled at Selhurst Park from around 8,000 during the last years at Plough Lane to a peak of over 18,000 during the 1998–99 Premier League season. Wimbledon's fans were a blend between locals who had supported the club since its non-League days and supporters who had defected from other London teams. According to statistics compiled in 2000, 56% of Wimbledon season-ticket holders were locally born (the second lowest in the Premier League), and only 12% had fathers who were Wimbledon fans. Many attended Wimbledon matches as it was cheaper and perceived as safer than other clubs in the capital—Wimbledon had more women and children at their games than any other top-flight club. In 2000, 23% of Wimbledon season-ticket holders earned over £50,000 a year, the second-highest in the division after Chelsea (33%).\nHammam sold Wimbledon to two Norwegian businessmen, Kjell Inge Røkke and Bjørn Rune Gjelsten, for a reported £26 million in June 1997, while remaining at the club in an advisory role. In December that year, Wimbledon were reported to be considering the football and greyhounds option again. Ownership of Plough Lane was transferred from the club to Rudgwick Limited—a company founded in 1993 with Hammam serving as director. With political control of Merton Council having changed, Hammam secured the £8 million sale of Plough Lane to Safeway supermarkets in 1998. He unsuccessfully attempted to gain permission to redevelop a former gas works in Merton during the same year, and soon after entered abortive negotiations over a site in Beddington.\nFrustrated by the lack of progress, Hammam shifted his focus to Dublin and other locations outside London—Basingstoke, \"Gatwick\", Belfast, Cardiff, Manchester, Wigan, Bristol, and Scotland. He later claimed that during this time seven clubs from outside London approached Wimbledon with groundshare offers. Similar opposition to that emanating from the Irish football hierarchy followed after Kinnear spoke of the Cardiff proposal: the Football Association of Wales stated they \"will oppose the plan even if it means Premiership football coming to Cardiff\". By February 1998, Clydebank of the Scottish third tier were also pursuing a move to the Irish capital. Swayed by Hammam's offer of £500,000 to each League of Ireland club, the same amount to the FAI and \"schools of excellence all over the country\" in return for support, five Irish teams now backed Wimbledon's Dublin proposal. Later that year, after the Premier League had approved the idea, the lengthy, heated debate in Ireland ended with an FAI veto. With Dublin now not an option, and Scotland similarly barred, Hammam attempted to buy Selhurst Park from Noades, who had sold Crystal Palace in 1998, but still owned the ground. This led nowhere. Hammam finally sold his shares in Wimbledon in February 2000, and seven months later became the owner of Cardiff City. Wimbledon were relegated from the Premier League at the end of the 1999–2000 season. The average attendance at Wimbledon home matches dropped by more than half over the next year, from 17,157 during the 1999–2000 season to 7,897 during 2000–01.\nMilton Keynes Stadium Consortium.\nThe Milton Keynes Stadium Consortium or \"Stadium MK\", led by Pete Winkelman and his company Inter MK Group, was formed in 2000. It proposed a large development in the southern Milton Keynes district of Denbigh North, including a 30,000-capacity football stadium, a Asda hypermarket, an IKEA store, a hotel, a conference centre, and a retail park. The plan to build a ground of this size was complicated by the fact that there was no professional football club in Milton Keynes and that the highest-ranked team in the town, (another) Milton Keynes City—based in Wolverton in northern Milton Keynes, and formerly known as Mercedes-Benz F.C.—played in the then eighth-tier Spartan South Midlands League, four divisions below the Football League. The developers could not justify building such a stadium for a club of this small stature. Rather than wait for MK City or another local team to progress through the pyramid, Winkelman resolved to \"import\" an established League club to use the ground.\nWinkelman, an ex-CBS Records executive and music promoter, had moved to the Milton Keynes area from London in 1993. He attested to a vast untapped fanbase for football in Milton Keynes—a \"football frenzy waiting to happen\", he said. Critics of this claim pointed to the apparent lack of public interest in Milton Keynes City and the other local non-League clubs, and argued that Milton Keynes residents interested specifically in League football already had ample access with Luton, Northampton and Rushden &amp; Diamonds all within . Winkelman was the only person in Milton Keynes publicly associated with the project; his financial supporters, later revealed to be Asda (a subsidiary of Walmart) and IKEA, were kept strictly anonymous. According to an investigative report by Ian Pollock, published in \"When Saturday Comes\" in July 2002, neither the Milton Keynes Council press office, the editor of the \"Milton Keynes Citizen\" newspaper nor the head of Invest in MK, the council agency encouraging businesses to move to the area, could tell him who was backing the plans. Winkelman told Pollock his supporters were \"major business people in MK and some developers. A number of major international partners who've done this sort of thing before.\"\nOpponents of such a move surmised that the stadium was a \"Trojan Horse\" included in the blueprint to bypass planning rules, and that although the consortium described the larger development as enabling the construction of the stadium, the reverse was the case—Winkelman's consortium, they claimed, had to have a professional team in place right away to justify the ground so the development could get planning permission. David Conn of \"The Guardian\" corroborated this assessment. \"The whole project was indeed dependent on Asda and IKEA,\" Conn summarised in a 2012 article, after interviewing Winkelman. \"Having seen the opportunity to build a stadium Milton Keynes lacked, and realised Asda did not have a store in the town, Winkelman acquired options to buy the land from its three owners, including the council. Asda would not have been granted planning permission for a huge out-of-town superstore unless it gave the council the benefit of building the stadium. [A League club] would move up, permission would be granted, then [Winkelman] would exercise the option to buy all the land, sell it to Asda and IKEA for very much more, and the difference would be used to build the stadium.\" Conn retrospectively described this as a \"deal of a lifetime\".\nTalks with Luton, Wimbledon, Barnet, Crystal Palace and QPR.\nThe first club approached was Luton Town, still based at Kenilworth Road, in 2000. As in the 1980s, Luton's owners liked the Milton Keynes idea but the fans strongly opposed it. The Football League stated that no member club could leave its own area and blocked the move. Nevertheless, Winkelman attempted to negotiate a move with two League clubs from London over the following months; he approached Crystal Palace and Barnet, but neither was interested. Winkelman then offered the ground to Wimbledon. He registered several internet domain names with variants of \"Milton Keynes Dons\" and \"MK Dons\" in June 2000. Wimbledon initially rejected the Milton Keynes idea.\nRøkke and Gjelsten appointed a new club chairman, Charles Koppel, in January 2001. According to Stephen Morrow in \"The People's Game?: Football, Finance and Society\" (2003), Koppel had never been to a football match before becoming involved with Wimbledon and \"gave the impression of being completely unaware of the relationship that exists between a football club and its supporters.\" He was interested in an \"enabling development\" whereby a stadium could be created and funded as part of a business or leisure opportunity—exactly the kind of proposition put forward by Winkelman.\nTowards the end of the 2000–01 season Wimbledon and Queens Park Rangers, who were in financial administration, entered discussions over a merger; the new team would play at Loftus Road. The Football League announced on 2 May 2001 that it would give \"favourable consideration\" to a takeover of QPR by Wimbledon, but that the process would have to be very quick for the merged team to take part in the 2001–02 season. Noades—by now the owner of Brentford, who were themselves interested in a move out of Griffin Park, either to groundshare at Loftus Road or to a move to Woking,—said that Wimbledon would have to give him 12 months' notice to leave Selhurst Park. The majority of Wimbledon and QPR fans quickly made their opposition to a merger known. Following Wimbledon's draw with Norwich City at Selhurst Park on 6 May, Koppel came onto the pitch and told the mostly jeering home fans that \"there never was a merger proposal with QPR\"; the Loftus Road club had instigated the talks, he said. QPR abandoned the amalgamation plan two days later, citing potential fan alienation, while also announcing that there would be no further talks with Brentford, who would seek and eventually obtain an option to move into Kingstonian's ground Kingsmeadow, before Noades sold his shares in Brentford to Bees United in January 2006, with the club still at Griffin Park.\nA month later, Winkelman offered his Milton Keynes stadium site to QPR, promising that the club's name and blue-and-white hooped strip would be kept in Buckinghamshire and that the fans would be represented on the board of directors. \"We have real resources to put behind the club,\" said Winkelman. \"They are fast running out of solutions and we are the answer to their problems.\" QPR dismissed the offer, leading the developers to once again contact Wimbledon later that month. With Koppel in charge, Wimbledon were more receptive this time around—Koppel said that Wimbledon's owners were subsidising the club to the tune of £6 million per year and that such action was necessary to prevent its liquidation. As talks progressed, Winkelman approached the owner of Milton Keynes City, attempting to buy the club name. It soon became clear that the bulk of Wimbledon's support strongly opposed a move of this kind.\nAuthorisation process.\nAnnouncement and rejection; appeal.\nKoppel announced Wimbledon Football Club's intent to move to Milton Keynes on 2 August 2001 with a letter to the Football League chief executive David Burns requesting approval. The letter stated that Wimbledon had already signed an agreement to relocate and \"subject to the necessary planning and regulatory consents being obtained\" intended to be playing home games at a newly built stadium in Milton Keynes by the start of the 2003–04 season. The proposed move was opposed in most quarters: along with most of Wimbledon's fans and many football supporters generally, the League, the Football Association (the FA), Merton Council, most football writers in the national press and a 150-member Parliamentary All-Party Committee voiced disapproval. Two similar club relocations had occurred in the Scottish professional ranks during the 1990s, but the permanent relocation of an English League club to another conurbation was unprecedented. A group of Wimbledon fans decided to boycott club merchandise in protest against the plans, and launched an \"alternative matchday programme for both home and away fans\", \"Yellow and Blue\", to compete against the official publication. The League board unanimously rejected Wimbledon's proposed move on 16 August 2001, stating that any Milton Keynes club would have to earn membership by progressing through the pyramid and that \"franchised football\" would be \"disastrous\".\nKoppel appealed against this decision, calling it and the process by which it was reached \"deficient and unlawful\"; he insisted that re-basing in Milton Keynes was the only way Wimbledon could survive. Burns expressed strong personal opposition in response, declaring that allowing such a move would \"destroy what football is about\". To consider whether Wimbledon had the right to contest the League's decision, the Football Association formed an \"ad hoc\" arbitration panel made up of FA vice-chairman and Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein, York City chairman Douglas Craig, and Charles Hollander QC. Craig was a controversial choice for some because of his actions as York chief; he had sold his club's stadium Bootham Crescent to a holding company he also owned for £165,000 in July 1999, then in December 2001 announced his intention to evict the team and sell the ground for £4.5 million. Winkelman told reporters that even if the appeal were unsuccessful \"our door will be open to any club in trouble\".\nAfter considering extensive written evidence from Wimbledon F.C., the Football League, the FA, the Premier League, the Football Conference, the Scottish Football League, Milton Keynes City F.C., Merton Council, the Football Supporters' Association and the Wimbledon Independent Supporters Association (WISA), and oral submissions from Koppel, Burns and Andrew Judge of Merton Council, the arbitration panel unanimously ruled on 29 January 2002 that the League's decision had \"not been properly taken in the legal sense, and that the procedures had not been fair\"—the League, the panel reported, had rejected Wimbledon's application \"not on its merits, but on the basis of an inflexible view or policy\". The question of Wimbledon's proposed move was remitted to the Football League board, which reconvened on 17 April 2002 and concluded that the matter should be considered by an independent commission appointed by the Football Association.\nThe FA agreed and in the first week of May appointed Raj Parker of the Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer law firm to chair the commission, with Steve Stride, Aston Villa's operations director, and Alan Turvey, member of the FA Council and chairman of the Isthmian League, as commissioners. Under FA Rule 'F', the Football League and Wimbledon were informed of these appointments; neither objected. Acknowledging Koppel's request that the matter be resolved by the end of the month because of Wimbledon's financial problems, the FA set a deadline of 31 May 2002 for the commission's \"final and binding\" verdict, and released a press statement on 10 May inviting anyone interested to send written submissions care of the FA. By this time, the fans' matchday publication \"Yellow and Blue\" was outselling the official Wimbledon F.C. programme by three to one.\nIndependent commission; approval.\nParker, Stride and Turvey sat at Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer's Fleet Street offices on 14, 15, 16 and 22 May 2002. Legal counsel instructed by Olswang appeared for Wimbledon; the League, which had engaged external lawyers for the arbitration hearing, this time did not, deciding that its objections were adequately set out in the written material. The League and FA contributions were summarised in the commission report as concerns that a relocated club would, in effect, \"drive a coach and horses through the pyramid structure\", \"herald, or risk heralding, a franchise system for football whereby the investors in football could relocate clubs at will\" and \"dramatically change the defining characteristics of the English domestic game where clubs are identified with the locality or community built up over time\". \"English football is not organised on the basis of a franchise system in which different communities may bid for clubs competing in competitions,\" the FA statement concluded. \"If a move effectively involved a break of the links with the community with which the club is traditionally associated, and a move to an entirely new community, with an intent to put down new roots and reinvent the club with a new identity and a new set of allegiances, and yet the club did not want to relinquish its place in the pyramid, go down to a lower level and work its way back up, the FA believes that allowing such a move would have a fundamental impact on the organisational framework of the game.\"\nWimbledon's statement centred on the club's precarious financial situation and a claim that its case was unique. It stressed that Wimbledon (referred to in the statement as \"WFC\") had lacked its own home stadium for 11 years and asserted that the club did not have \"firm and extensive roots within the conurbation from which it takes its name\". According to the club statement, \"the vast majority\" of Wimbledon fans were not from Merton and \"less than 20% of the 3,400 season ticket holders\" lived there. Milton Keynes was, the statement said, Wimbledon's \"last chance of financial survival\"; the move's opponents did not properly appreciate the club's fiscal troubles and \"wrongly assume[d] that there is a viable alternative in south London.\" The new ground in Milton Keynes was feasible despite the club's financial problems as it would be almost entirely funded by the consortium's enabling development. Wimbledon's identity—\"traditions, history, colours, name, strip, stadium design and the like\"—would be preserved in Milton Keynes and supporters from London would be offered subsidised travel and tickets. The statement concluded that \"infinitely more harm would be caused to football if WFC went out of business\" and that a \"proportionate exercise of discretion ... would allow the\nrelocation in WFC's exceptional circumstances.\"\nThe commissioners heard oral statements from Winkelman, Koppel, Louise Carton-Kelly of the Dons Trust fundraising group, Kris Stewart of the WISA, Nicholas Coward of the FA and Steve Clark, Merton Council's head of planning. Winkelman was described in the report as \"a passionate and frank witness, who is genuinely concerned to promote the interests of Milton Keynes and WFC.\" He expressed a wish to retain Wimbledon's \"name, strip, branding and the like\", and spoke of renaming local roads and calling the stadium site \"Wimbledon Park\". Winkelman predicted that an overwhelming majority of Wimbledon fans would continue to follow the club in Milton Keynes. The commission summarised the fans' submitted views as almost universally negative and reported that most perceived a continuation of the club in Milton Keynes as no better than liquidation. Stewart, when asked if he would prefer life for the club in Milton Keynes or death in Merton, said he regarded both as death and that in either case he would attempt to \"resurrect the club and start at the bottom of the pyramid\".\nThe commission report described redeveloping Plough Lane, which Merton Council insisted remained viable \"if there is a will for the club to pursue this option\", as the only recourse for Wimbledon other than Milton Keynes. A feasibility study carried out by Drivers Jonas, commissioned and funded jointly by Wimbledon F.C. and Merton Council, described a 20,000-capacity stadium at Plough Lane as physically possible but \"extremely ambitious\", risky and financially unsustainable given the club's money problems. The commission ruled that it was unreasonable to expect Wimbledon's owners to pursue a move back to Plough Lane under these circumstances. Parker and Stride concluded that on the evidence presented Milton Keynes was the only option that would give the club a chance of financial survival, and therefore ruled in favour of the move, two to one—Turvey dissented—on 28 May 2002.\nRelocation.\n2002–03.\nThe FA stated that although the decision was final and binding, it still strongly opposed the relocation. It emphasised that its recommendation to the commissioners had been against the move. \"The Football Association sees it as vital for the game to stop these circumstances ever happening again,\" the statement concluded. The chief executive of the FA, Adam Crozier, said that he believed the commission to have made an \"appalling decision\". Koppel said the decision had saved Wimbledon Football Club. A spokesman for Milton Keynes Council said the people of Milton Keynes were looking forward to the team's arrival, stating: \"It will be of great benefit to the city. Milton Keynes is becoming a city of sport.\" In the eyes of the WISA, the Dons Trust and most of the Wimbledon F.C. fanbase, the move's sanctioning marked the \"death of their club\". \"If it moves it will mean nothing to us,\" said Marc Jones, a WISA spokesman. Wimbledon F.C. became widely reviled by football supporters across the country and pejoratively nicknamed by some as \"Franchise F.C.\".\nA group of disaffected Wimbledon F.C. fans led by Stewart, Jones, Ivor Heller and Trevor Williams resolved to found their own team, in their view a spiritual continuation or \"phoenix\" version of the original. Within weeks, they had done so; the new side, AFC Wimbledon, entered a groundshare arrangement with Kingstonian at the latter club's home ground at Kingsmeadow, in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames, adjacent to Merton and about from Plough Lane. The fans' club was accepted into the Combined Counties League, seven levels below Wimbledon F.C.'s place in the second tier, and began play at the start of the 2002–03 season. The WISA, the Dons Trust and the vast majority of Wimbledon F.C.'s fanbase switched allegiance to the new club. The assertion in the commission report that \"resurrecting the club from its ashes as, say, 'Wimbledon Town'\" would be \"not in the wider interests of football\" particularly infuriated AFC Wimbledon's founders and became an integral part of club lore.\nWimbledon F.C. hoped to move to Milton Keynes immediately, but as the new ground was yet to be built an interim home in the town would have to be found first. The first proposal, to start the 2002–03 season at the National Hockey Stadium in central Milton Keynes, was abandoned because it did not meet Football League stadium criteria. While alternative temporary options were examined—Winkelman suggested converting the National Bowl music venue—Wimbledon F.C. started the season at Selhurst Park and set a target of playing in MK by Christmas. Central Milton Keynes Shopping Centre became the team's new sponsor; \"GO–MK\" was emblazoned across the players' shirts. Before Wimbledon F.C.'s first game of the season, against Gillingham on 10 August 2002, AFC Wimbledon supporters picketed outside Selhurst Park, tried to dissuade home fans from entering and shouted \"scab\" and \"scum\" at those who did. The attendance was officially announced as 2,476, including 1,808 from Gillingham. The breakaway club claimed an average crowd of over 3,700 during its first months, while Wimbledon F.C. attracted less than 3,000, most of whom were followers of visiting teams. The loss of income from gate receipts would contribute to Wimbledon F.C. subsequently entering administration.\nSafeway demolished Plough Lane and sold the site to a property developer in November 2002. Milton Keynes Council meanwhile granted planning permission to convert the National Bowl into a temporary football stadium, but the Football League delayed a decision on these plans in October 2002. At Selhurst Park, Wimbledon F.C. reported a divisional record low attendance of only 849—including over 200 away fans, around the same number of complimentary tickets, and Wimbledon F.C. youth players and members of the press—for the Tuesday-night game against Rotherham United on 29 October 2002, setting a post-Second World War record for the top two tiers. A temporary stadium in Milton Keynes proved difficult to arrange and Wimbledon F.C. remained in south London at the end of the season. On the field, the side finished the second-tier campaign in 10th place. Koppel re-adopted the National Hockey Stadium as his preferred interim destination, announcing a plan to convert the stadium for football and play there from the start of the 2003–04 season.\n2003–04.\nThe College of Arms had informed Wimbledon F.C. in August 2002 that its continued use of the Wimbledon double-headed eagle device for its logo was illegal, so the club adopted a new badge before the 2003–04 season. It featured a stylised eagle's head drawn in navy blue and yellow outline, the yellow forming the letters \"MK\". The club was concurrently compelled to stop using a Womble for its mascot after the owners of the Wombles brand refused to renew the relevant licence agreement in protest against the move to Milton Keynes. Tottenham Hotspur, Charlton Athletic and Luton Town scheduled pre-season friendly matches against Wimbledon F.C., but then cancelled them in quick succession after each set of supporters protested. Koppel accused the WISA of orchestrating a campaign against the club, and said the Tottenham and Charlton friendlies had been cancelled in part because of concerns that the National Hockey Stadium might not be ready on time (Luton would have been an away match). It was widely speculated that Wimbledon F.C. would be \"renamed, 'rebranded' even\" after moving, with \"MK Dons\" reported in the press as a possible new name, but Koppel denied this. \"It remains Wimbledon Football Club. That is our history and the tradition of the club,\" he said.\nOn 5 June 2003 Gjelsten told Koppel he could not go on subsidising Wimbledon F.C., and withheld the scheduled monthly injection of £800,000. Koppel declared Wimbledon F.C. insolvent the next day and put it into administration with reported debts of £3.5 million. John Gurney, who had just become the chairman of Luton Town following a takeover by a consortium from Hong Kong and the United States, briefly floated the idea of buying Wimbledon F.C. and merging it with Luton, in his words \"effectively buying a back door to Division One\" (Luton were in the division below), but was soon ousted by Luton supporters. In late June, after Wimbledon F.C. missed a deadline to invest in renovations to the Hockey Stadium, the National Hockey Foundation pulled out of discussions over the ground's use, creating confusion as to where the club would now be located. The administrators said on 27 June that as things stood the move to Milton Keynes was off. A week later, after Watford refused to let Wimbledon F.C. share their ground at Vicarage Road, the administrators announced a return to Selhurst Park.\nWinkelman had not intended to own Wimbledon F.C. himself; his plan had been to work alongside it while the stadium was built in Denbigh and then give the ground to the club in exchange for shares and a place on the board. He had not expected it to go into administration. With the move threatened and the club facing liquidation, he made \"the life-defining decision\", to quote Conn, \"of taking it on himself\". He secured funds from his consortium for the administrators to pay the players' wages, keep the club operating, and pay for the necessary renovations for the National Hockey Stadium to host League football. He made clear that his group's interest was conditional on the club moving to Milton Keynes. In late July Winkelman and the club's administrators concluded a deal with the Hockey Stadium's owners to carry out conversion work and play there from October—Wimbledon F.C. would return to Selhurst Park in the meantime. Meanwhile, Milton Keynes City F.C. went out of business before the start of the season following an unsuccessful drive for new directors and investors.\nAfter hosting the first few home matches of the campaign at Selhurst Park—1,054 saw them lose 4–2 to Wigan Athletic in their last home game in London—Wimbledon F.C. received Football League clearance to host matches at the National Hockey Stadium on 19 September 2003, and eight days later played their first match in Milton Keynes, against Burnley. The game drew a crowd of 5,639, including 893 away fans. Wimbledon F.C. went two goals down before coming back to draw 2–2; Dean Holdsworth scored the club's first goal in Milton Keynes. The team struggled on and off the pitch for the rest of the season, losing important players regularly as the administrators sold them to keep the club afloat, and eventually finished bottom of the second-tier First Division. Attendances at the National Hockey Stadium were higher than those at Selhurst Park during the 2002–03 season, but lower than those of the 2001–02 season. The 2–1 defeat to Sunderland on 7 April 2004 that confirmed Wimbledon F.C.'s relegation was attended by 4,800, of whom 2,380 were away fans.\nAfter Gjelsten agreed to write off the £24 million he and Røkke had lent to the club since 1997, a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) was put together on 18 March 2004 under which Winkelman's consortium would take Wimbledon F.C. out of administration, reportedly using a holding company called MK Dons. This was accepted by most of Wimbledon F.C.'s creditors, but delayed while the Inland Revenue decided whether or not to pursue the club's £525,000 debt to the UK taxpayer before the Law Lords. The Football League threatened to expel the club if the takeover were not completed by 31 July. In May \"Property Week\" reported that the new stadium in Denbigh would be cancelled if Wimbledon F.C. were wound up. Richard Foreman, a director of the consortium's development consultant, denied this, saying that the project would continue with \"the total support of the council\"; the consortium would invite another League team to move, he said, and would have 18 months to do so. This did not prove necessary. After the Inland Revenue announced on 27 May that it would not pursue the club's debt, Winkelman's Inter MK Group brought Wimbledon F.C. out of administration in late June 2004, paying £850,000 for the club, and concurrently announced changes to its name, badge and colours.\nMK Dons and AFC Wimbledon.\nThe new name of the relocated club was Milton Keynes Dons F.C. (commonly shortened to MK Dons). Inter MK explained that this name was intended to \"represent the past, present and future and place the club at the heart of its new community\" as well as to retain a connection with the club's former identity. The Football League gave final approval to the CVA on 1 July 2004, and the same day confirmed the transfer of the Wimbledon F.C. League share to Milton Keynes Dons Ltd.\nThe blue and yellow home colours that Wimbledon F.C. players had worn were replaced by white shirts, shorts and socks, with black, red and gold as accent colours. The first MK Dons away outfit comprised red shirts, shorts and socks. Both white and red had been used by Wimbledon F.C. as away colours over the previous two decades. The club badge became a rendering of the letters \"MK\", with the \"K\" positioned below the \"M\", rotated 90° anti-clockwise and defaced with the year \"MMIV\" (2004).\nIn line with its self-perception as the spiritual continuation of Wimbledon F.C., AFC Wimbledon attempts to emulate the original team's appearance in almost every way. The fans' club plays in the same blue and yellow home colours and uses the Wimbledon double-headed eagle for its badge. AFC Wimbledon continue to use the \"Dons\" nickname, despite its synchronous use in Milton Keynes. They also retain the \"Wombles\" label formerly applied to Wimbledon Football Club.\nStadium MK.\nMilton Keynes Dons continued to play at the National Hockey Stadium while the development including the new ground was constructed in Denbigh. Asda paid Inter MK £35 million for its section of the site, Ikea £24 million. Ground was broken on the stadium in February 2005. In December 2005 MK Dons set a target of playing at the new ground by January 2007; in February 2007 they revised their proposal to a 22,000-seater stadium ready in July of that year, with provision for expansion to 32,000 (it had originally been intended to seat 30,000). The new ground, named Stadium MK, hosted its first match in July 2007.\nMK Dons' last match at the National Hockey Stadium was on 18 May: the home leg of the semi-final of the League Two play-offs in 2007, a 2–1 loss to Shrewsbury Town. The supersession of the Hockey Stadium by field hockey facilities in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park–firstly the Riverbank Arena, and latterly the Lee Valley Hockey and Tennis Centre–rendered it redundant so after the Dons' departure for Denbigh, it was demolished in 2010, having not been notably used for its eponym since 2003. Network Rail's new national centre, , opened on the site in June 2012.\nPlough Lane.\nIn December 2015 Merton Borough Council granted AFC Wimbledon planning permission to build a new 11,000-seater stadium on Plough Lane, with provision for expansion to 20,000, on the site of the greyhound stadium less than a mile from where the former Wimbledon F.C. ground stood. The plans also include 602 homes. Jim White suggested in the \"Daily Telegraph\" that a move to this site on Plough Lane would \"represent the most romantic of homecoming stories\" for AFC Wimbledon, but the proposal met with caustic opposition from the dog racing community as it would leave their sport without a track in London.\nThe plans were put on hold in March 2016 when London Mayor Boris Johnson decided to review Merton Council's decision following objections from neighbouring Wandsworth, but his successor Sadiq Khan reversed this stance in August 2016. A month later the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Sajid Javid announced that the government would allow Merton Council's decision to stand. AFC Wimbledon's chief executive Erik Samuelson said in response: \"Now, at long last, we can start planning with confidence to give AFC Wimbledon a secure future at the heart of the community the club represents. After so many years in exile, the Dons are coming home.\" The \"Daily Telegraph\" predicted in October 2016 that the first AFC Wimbledon match at the new ground would be in 2019.\nThe plan itself was not without controversy due to concerns that it made Kingstonian F.C.'s future uncertain, with them unable to play in a ground that was seen as too big and expensive for a non-League side and one over which they no longer had any decision. Wimbledon eventually sold Kingsmeadow to Chelsea to provide part of the financing for their new stadium.\nThe new Plough Lane as built was a scaled-back version of the original plan, with a single permanent stand and three semi-permanent ones designed to be easily replaced at a later date, with a total capacity of just over 9,000. The club's first game at Plough Lane was in November 2020 against Doncaster Rovers.\nLegacy of Wimbledon F.C..\nThe location of the history and legacy of Wimbledon F.C., as well as the honours won by the club, was disputed for four years after the independent commission's approval of the move on 28 May 2002. In the view of AFC Wimbledon and that club's supporters, the \"identity of a football club is implicitly bound up in its community\". The club regards itself as Wimbledon F.C.'s spiritual continuation to this day, holding that the community maintaining and backing AFC Wimbledon is the same one which originally formed Wimbledon Old Centrals (later Wimbledon F.C.) in 1889, \"and kept Wimbledon Football Club alive until May 2002\".\nMK Dons initially maintained that any debate was pointless as their club was simply a renamed Wimbledon F.C. Winkelman was unequivocal when answering readers' questions in \"FourFourTwo\" magazine in November 2004: \"MK Dons and AFC Wimbledon share the same heritage, but we're the real child of Wimbledon\", he wrote. One reader asked: \"Now that you have renamed the team, and changed the badge and colours, do you agree that AFC Wimbledon now carry the true spirit of Wimbledon?\"; Winkelman replied that AFC Wimbledon's founders had betrayed their club and \"left their team before their team left them\". In another answer, he poured scorn on suggestions that he might give Wimbledon F.C.'s trophy replicas to AFC Wimbledon, writing that the fans had \"abdicated their right to it when they all walked away.\" \"The fans who have continued to support us from London—they're the ones who've had to put up with this shit for so long,\" he concluded.\nThe Wimbledon Independent Supporters Association founded the Wimbledon Old Players Association (WOPA) in September 2005 as part of its drive to \"reclaim the history of Wimbledon Football Club for AFC Wimbledon and/or the community of Wimbledon\". Membership was opened to any former Wimbledon F.C. or AFC Wimbledon player or manager. There were 60 founder members. A \"Wimbledon\" team, organised by WOPA and backed by AFC Wimbledon, played in the London Masters indoor football tournament in July 2006. Plough Lane was replaced by a residential development comprising six blocks of flats. Representatives of AFC Wimbledon, the WISA, Merton Council, Barratt Homes and the Dons Trust attended a ceremony in November 2008 at which the development's gate and each of the buildings was named after a figure from Wimbledon F.C.'s past.\nDespite Winkelman's strong words in 2004, his club later agreed to hold talks with the Football Supporters' Federation (FSF), the MK Dons Supporters Association and the WISA. The FSF was refusing to admit MK Dons supporters, discouraging friendly matches against MK Dons, and urging football fans generally to boycott MK Dons home games. The parties reached an agreement in October 2006. The FSF would end its calls for a boycott and admit MK supporters as members, and in return MK Dons would \"recognise and genuinely regret the hurt which was caused to supporters of the former Wimbledon F.C. by the move to Milton Keynes\", renounce any claim to Wimbledon F.C.'s history up to 2004 and transfer the Wimbledon F.C. trophy replicas, copyrights, web domain names and other patrimony to Merton Borough. All of this was done in August 2007. The Wimbledon F.C. trophies were put on display at Morden Library in Merton in April 2008.\nSections of MK Dons' fans continue to relate to their club's former identity as Wimbledon. When AFC Wimbledon and MK Dons met on the playing field for the first time in 2012, some MK supporters wore scarves bearing the Wimbledon name, and Wimbledon F.C. shirts. Others have attempted to reclaim the \"Franchise F.C.\" label for their own use, chanting \"you're getting beat by a franchise\" during matches. Elsewhere in the Milton Keynes fanbase, attempts to create a club culture separate to Wimbledon are visible, largely driven by the \"Concrete Cows\". MK supporters have christened Stadium MK \"the Moo Camp\", while as early as the first match in Buckinghamshire, mooing was heard in the crowd. The South Stand is known as the Cowshed, a tradition maintained from their National Hockey Stadium days.\nIn January 2012 the \"Wimbledon Guardian\" newspaper launched a campaign called \"Drop the Dons\", with the aim of persuading MK Dons' owners to remove \"Dons\" from their club's name. The WISA joined the campaign almost immediately, saying that it believed the use of \"Dons\" by MK Dons was counter-productive for all parties. The campaign was publicly backed by several former Wimbledon F.C. and AFC Wimbledon figures, both Merton Members of Parliament and all 60 of the borough's councillors.\nMost MK Dons supporters reacted to the campaign with anger. One MK season-ticket holder interviewed by the \"Milton Keynes Citizen\", a former Wimbledon F.C. fan based in London, suggested that \"AFC Wimbledon should drop Wimbledon from their name as they don't play in Wimbledon.\" The leaders of Merton and Milton Keynes Councils met in Milton Keynes in April 2012 to discuss the campaign, and agreed to differ on the matter of a name change. Later that year, shortly before the first AFC Wimbledon–MK Dons match, Winkelman told reporters that \"Dons\" would not be dropped from his club's name unless it was the will of MK supporters. \"I have learned to do what the supporters want,\" he said. At that match, MK Dons' supporters unfurled a banner reading \"we're keeping the Dons... just get over it!\"\nIn a December 2012 interview, Winkelman expressed some regret about what had happened. \"I'm not proud of the way this club came to exist, and I am totally prepared to be the villain of the piece, but I can't put the genie back in the bottle,\" he said. \"Do I think it was right? No. Do I think it was a great thing that happened to Wimbledon? No ... I don’t feel in the right over the way this club was born. But I don’t think I could live with myself if I hadn't gone out and bought the club when it was hours away from liquidation. It was about to be completely finito ... What happened was my fault, and I have to take responsibility for it. But I don’t see why my players, staff and our young supporter base should be forced to carry the can and live with the nastiness, it's nothing to do with them.\"\nSince the relocation, football magazine \"When Saturday Comes\"—which annually publishes a pre-season questionnaire of fans from every League club in England and the top two Scottish divisions—has never invited an MK Dons fan to contribute. The magazine has each year left MK's space empty but for the words \"No questions asked\".\nFixtures between AFC Wimbledon and MK Dons.\nThe two sides met for the first time on 2 December 2012, in the second round of the 2012–13 FA Cup. MK Dons won 2–1; with an injury time winner scored by Jon Otsemobor with his heel; MK fans dubbed the goal the \"Heel of God\" (a spoof on the 1986 Argentina–England \"Hand of God\"). Kyle McFadzean's opening goal for MK Dons in the second match between the two clubs, a 3–1 MK win in the first round of the League Cup in August 2014 was also scored with his heel, and was consequently labelled \"Heel of God II\".\nTwo months later, in the Football League Trophy Southern section second round, AFC Wimbledon defeated MK Dons 3–2 with a winning goal by Adebayo Akinfenwa.\nThe two clubs played each other in the same league for the first time during the 2016–17 season, after the 2015–16 campaign ended with MK Dons' relegation to League One and AFC Wimbledon's promotion via the play-offs to the same division. Whenever MK Dons have visited, AFC Wimbledon has not acknowledged the \"Dons\" part of its opponent's name in match programmes or on the scoreboards, instead referring to the opposition simply as \"MK\". As a result, the English Football League charged AFC Wimbledon for breaching its regulations."

        "title": "Tom Wilhelmsen (baseball)",
        "text": "Thomas Mark Wilhelmsen (born December 16, 1983) is an American former professional baseball relief pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Seattle Mariners, Texas Rangers, and Arizona Diamondbacks.\nCareer.\nWilhelmsen graduated from Tucson High School, whence he was selected by the Milwaukee Brewers in the seventh round (199th overall) of the 2002 MLB Draft. Later that summer, upon signing with the Brewers on August 19, he received a US$250,000 bonus. He began his professional career the next season.\nWilhelmsen played for the AZL Brewers and Beloit Snappers in 2003, going a combined 5–6 with a 2.84 ERA in 17 starts. Following that season, he twice tested positive for marijuana and was suspended for the 2004 campaign. He decided to quit professional baseball during extended spring training after his suspension ended in 2005.\nDuring his five-year hiatus from 2005 to 2009, he worked as a bartender at The Hut, a tiki bar in his hometown. This occupation would later be the inspiration for his nickname.\nSeattle Mariners.\nPrior to the 2010 season, Wilhelmsen attempted a comeback and signed a minor league contract with the Mariners. He played for the AZL Mariners, Everett AquaSox and Clinton LumberKings that season, going a combined 7–1 with a 2.19 ERA in 15 games (12 starts).\nOn May 17, 2011, after being signed by the Mariners he was optioned to Class AA in order to clear room for Franklin Gutierrez to be activated. After a series of trades created an opening on the Mariners' 25-man roster, Wilhelmsen was recalled from the minor leagues on August 2, 2011. He won his first major league game on August 15, pitching a perfect 8th inning against the Toronto Blue Jays.\nOn June 8, 2012, Wilhelmsen recorded the save in a six-pitcher combined no-hitter which was started by Kevin Millwood who left the game after the 6th inning due to a groin injury. The six pitchers used by the Mariners tied the record of most pitchers used in a no-hitter with the 2003 Houston Astros. The Mariners beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 1–0. Wilhelmsen said after the game that while he was pitching, he had forgotten it was a no-hitter, and only remembered after catcher Jesús Montero reminded him.\nWilhelmsen was optioned to Tacoma on August 6, 2013, and recalled in September. In 2014 Wilhelmsen was back in the Mariner bullpen, appearing in 57 games and finishing the season with a 2.27 ERA and a WHIP of 1.05. It was also in 2014 that Wilhelmsen reached a wider audience in baseball after his formidable dancing ability was captured on video.\nDuring the 2015 season, Wilhelmsen had a brief stint on the disabled list after a bullpen accident; Wilhelmsen was swinging his arms when teammate Danny Farquhar ran into Wilhelmsen's right arm, resulting in a hyperextended elbow.\nTexas Rangers.\nOn November 16, 2015, the Mariners traded Wilhelmsen, James Jones, and a player to be named later (Patrick Kivlehan) to the Texas Rangers for Leonys Martín and Anthony Bass. On January 13, 2016, the Rangers and Wilhelmsen agreed to a one-year, $3.1 million contract to avoid arbitration. Wilhelmsen had a rough start with the Rangers with an ERA of 10.55. With this, the Rangers optioned Wilhelmsen to Triple A, but he refused, making him a free agent.\nSecond stint with Seattle.\nOn June 22, 2016, Wilhelmsen signed a one-year contract with the Seattle Mariners. He was designated for assignment by the Mariners on November 18, and released on November 22.\nArizona Diamondbacks.\nWilhelmsen signed a minor league contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks with an invitation to spring training in February 2017. He made the Diamondbacks' Opening Day roster. He was released on June 16, 2017, after struggling with his command, allowing 12 walks in 26 innings and posting a 4.44 ERA for the Diamondbacks.\nMilwaukee Brewers.\nOn June 20, 2017, Wilhelmsen signed a minor league contract with the Milwaukee Brewers. He was released on August 9, 2017.\nSan Diego Padres.\nOn February 6, 2018, Wilhelmsen signed a minor league contract with the San Diego Padres. He was released on March 19.\nSt. Paul Saints.\nOn May 2, 2018, Wilhelmsen signed with the St. Paul Saints of the independent American Association.\nToros de Tijuana.\nOn July 3, 2018, Wilhelmsen signed with the Toros de Tijuana of the Mexican League. He was released on August 14, 2018.\nWilhelmsen announced his retirement on December 10, 2018.\nPitch mechanics.\nWilhelmsen mainly throws two pitches — a four-seam fastball, which is usually 95-98 mph, and a 12-6 curveball, which will be in the upper 70s with a big, 12-6 break. He has experimented with a slider and circle changeup, but he uses these pitches sparingly. However, the changeup was seen more frequently during Spring Training in 2013."

        "text": "Andrew Wheeler (born 18 January 1988) is a New Zealand basketball player for the Southland Sharks of the National Basketball League (NBL).\nEarly life.\nWheeler was born in Invercargill and attended James Hargest College. He grew up as a basketball addict, but also played rugby and cricket. He studied at the University of Otago and trained with the Otago Nuggets' academy while based in Dunedin.\nNBL career.\nWheeler was a member of the inaugural Southland Sharks team in 2010, making his NBL debut in the Sharks' opening game before making two other appearances off the bench. Following an incident in Dunedin on 27 March 2010, he was suspended from playing or practising with the Sharks for the rest of the NBL season.\nIn September 2010, Wheeler was sentenced in the Dunedin District Court to seven months' home detention after admitting a charge of reckless disregard for safety when he struck a man in the face with a beer bottle at a Dunedin flat-warming party in March. For 28 weeks, Wheeler was electronically monitored by an ankle bracelet and confined to his parents' house – only being able to leave for work and the odd recreational allowance. He was welcomed back into the Sharks squad in April 2011. He played sparingly for the Sharks in 2011, 2012 and 2013, but was a member of the championship-winning team in July 2013.\nAfter sitting out the 2014 season due to injury, Wheeler returned to the Sharks in 2015 and won his second NBL championship.\nThe 2016 season saw new coach Judd Flavell hand Wheeler a larger role on the team, and he subsequently played a career-high 15 games.\nEntering the 2017 season, Wheeler became the franchise's longest-serving player. The Sharks made their third NBL final in 2017, but lost 108–75 to the Wellington Saints.\nWheeler's dedication to the Sharks under coach Flavell saw him return once again in 2018. The Sharks went on to reach the NBL final for the fourth time in six years, where they won their third championship with a 98–96 win over the Saints. As a result, Wheeler became the only Sharks player to be part of all three of the franchise's championships.\nIn 2019, Wheeler returned to the Sharks for a ninth season. He was set to return for his tenth season in 2020 before the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic saw the Sharks withdraw from the season. He played for the Sharks again in 2021 and 2022. On 2 June 2022, Wheeler served as the Sharks' stand-in coach against the Nelson Giants after the team's head coach and assistant coach were ruled out due to Covid. He returned to the Sharks in 2023 in a dual player-assistant coach role. He continued in a dual player-assistant coach role in 2024.\nPersonal life.\nOff the court, Wheeler is a lawyer in Invercargill."

        "text": "Bogdan Bogdanović (; born 18 August 1992) is a Serbian professional basketball player for the Atlanta Hawks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He also represents the Serbian national team.\nHe was selected by the Phoenix Suns with the 27th overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft, with his draft rights being traded to the Sacramento Kings during the 2016 NBA draft. Bogdanović earned an All-EuroLeague First Team, a FIBA All-EuroBasket Team and was selected two times to the All-FIBA World Cup Team.\nEarly career.\nBogdanović began playing organized basketball with ŠKK Zvezdara, a club in Belgrade. In April 2008, he moved on to Žitko Basket (then known as Alimenti Basket), also from Belgrade. Playing with Žitko Basket under coach Dragan Jakovljević, Bogdanović was part of the team that in April 2010 earned third place in the 2009–10 Junior Serbian League at the final eight tournament in Vršac, after beating Partizan juniors in the quarterfinal, losing 89–86 to Hemofarm juniors in the semifinal and beating FMP junior team 82–76 in the third place game.\nA few weeks later in May 2010, together with another Žitko player Luka Pajković, Bogdanović got attached to FMP's junior team featuring Nenad Miljenović, Stefan Popovski-Turanjanin, Nemanja Bezbradica, Nikola Janković, and Nikola Silađi for the Nike International Junior Tournament (NIJT) in Paris where the FMP juniors were defending their club's double title from previous two years. They were drawn in one of two round-robin groups at the tournament, alongside KK Split, Treviso, and Málaga. After beating Treviso and Split, FMP required a win over Málaga juniors to win their group and make the final; with precisely Bogdanović making the difference with an off-balance buzzer-beater for a 79–78 final score, two of his 21 points on the day alongside 6 rebounds. In the final game FMP took on INSEP and lost 73–83 with Bogdanović having an outing to forget due to the mid-game injury that forced him to leave the contest.\nProfessional career.\nPartizan (2010–2014).\nIn September 2010, 18-year-old Bogdanović signed his first professional contract with Partizan. Initially, in his first two seasons with the \"crno-beli\", under head coach Vlada Jovanović, Bogdanović didn't play much.\nWith the summer 2012 return of head coach Duško Vujošević to Partizan, 20-year-old Bogdanović began to see increased minutes. After Danilo Anđušić's departure in December 2012, Bogdanović's role in the team stabilized even more. The 2012–13 season saw him make his EuroLeague debut with the team, averaging 5 points per game and 1.8 rebounds per game over 6 appearances.\nAfter being invited to play for the Serbian national team in the summer of 2013, he earned greater trust from coach Vujošević, which was reflected in his increased playing time in the 2013–14 season, and bigger role in the team.\nIn the EuroLeague victory over CSKA Moscow in Belgrade, Bogdanović scored a career-high 27 points, shooting 10 for 16 from the field. Shortly after the game, he was praised by Serbian national team selector Aleksandar Đorđević, as being one of the most promising young European players.\nIn a February ABA League away game versus Cibona, Bogdanović scored a career-high 32 points, also adding 4 rebounds and 5 assists. Over 23 games in the EuroLeague, he averaged 14.8 points, 3.7 rebounds and 3.7 assists per game, all career-highs. In April 2014, along with his teammate Joffrey Lauvergne, he was selected to the Ideal Team of the ABA League.\nIn May 2014, he was voted the EuroLeague Rising Star of the season, by the head coaches of 24 EuroLeague teams.\nPartizan finished the season by winning its 13th consecutive Serbian League title, after once again defeating their archrivals, Red Star Belgrade, 3–1 in the league's finals series. Bogdanović exploded in the finals series, averaging 30.8 points, 4.8 rebounds, and 4.2 assists per game. For such a performance, he was named the league's Finals MVP.\nFollowing Bogdanović's summer 2014 transfer from Partizan to Fenerbahce, the player's decision to leave the club was publicly criticized by Partizan's head coach Vujošević who claimed that by leaving in 2014 Bogdanović broke their verbal agreement the coach had struck with the player (along with Bogdanović's agent Aleksandar Rašković and his parents) two years earlier in 2012. Their 2012 agreement, according to the coach, saw then 20-year-old Bogdanović be placed immediately into Partizan's first team rotation in return for the player's promise he would stay with the team three more seasons from that point on. Bogdanović left the club in summer 2014, two years after the supposed agreement, following Partizan's failure to qualify for the next season's EuroLeague.\nFenerbahçe (2014–2017).\nOn 11 July 2014, Bogdanović officially signed a four-year contract, containing opt-out clauses after the second and third seasons, with the Turkish team Fenerbahçe. Over four years, Bogdanović is slated to make €3.5 million euros net income, while Partizan also received a €1.3 million buyout from Fenerbahçe, as the player was still under contract with the Belgrade club.\n2014–15 season.\nEven though Bogdanović was a newcomer in the team, head coach Željko Obradović gave him a significant number of minutes and a starter role. With the beginning of the 2014–15 season, he struggled in shooting and consistency. On 15 November, in a 93–86 win over FC Bayern Munich, he scored 18 points and added 7 assists, his best game since coming to the new team. Over 10 games in the first phase of the EuroLeague, he averaged 10.4 points and 3.4 assists per game. On 20 March, Bogdanović set a season-high of 25 points, and added 4 assists, in a 98–77 win over Emporio Armani Milano. For such a performance, he was named the EuroLeague MVP of the Round, with a Performance Index Rating of 32. On 26 March, in a game against Unicaja Málaga, he scored a 20-meter distance buzzer beater at the end of the second quarter. After good showings in the Top 16, he struggled in shooting in the quarter-final playoff series against Maccabi Tel Aviv, averaging 8 points on 25% shooting from the field. Eventually, Fenerbahçe won the EuroLeague playoff series, and advanced to the 2015 Euroleague Final Four, the first in the club's history.\nOn 7 May, he was voted the EuroLeague Rising Star for the second season in a row, becoming only the second player, after Nikola Mirotić, to win the award twice. On 15 May 2015, however, his team lost in the EuroLeague semifinal game to Real Madrid, by a score of 87–96. Eventually, Fenerbahçe finished in 4th place in the EuroLeague, after losing in the third-place game to CSKA Moscow, by a score of 80–86. Over the season, in 29 EuroLeague games, Bogdanović averaged 10.6 points, 2.9 rebounds, and 2.8 assists per game. Also, in 36 games of the Turkish League, he averaged 11.5 points, 3.1 rebounds, and 2.4 assists.\n2015–16 season.\nThroughout his second season with the team, Bogdanović continued with his good performances, becoming one of the team's leaders. Occasionally, in the late phases of the games, he also had the ball in his hands. Fenerbahçe won the Turkish Cup, with a 67–65 win over Darüşşafaka, with Bogdanović being named the Cup MVP. Fenerbahçe also reached the final game of the 2016 Euroleague Final Four, but fell short of winning the EuroLeague championship, after an overtime 96–101 loss to CSKA Moscow. Over 28 EuroLeague games, he averaged 11.7 points, 3.3 rebounds, and 3 assists per game. At the end of the season, Fenerbahçe won the Turkish League championship.\n2016–17 season.\nOn 26 October 2016, in a EuroLeague game against Žalgiris Kaunas, Bogdanović sprained his right ankle; at first it was estimated that he will need two to three weeks of recovery time, but recovery didn't seem to go as expected as he didn't return until January 2017. On 6 January 2017, he returned on the court, in a game against Milano. Bogdanović proved to be a major contributor for Fenerbahçe in the EuroLeague playoffs, as he would be the team's leading scorer in their first two games against Panathinaikos, before his club ultimately swept them, to earn another EuroLeague Final Four appearance. As a result of his contributions, he was not only named the EuroLeague's Player of the Round during those first two playoff games, but he was also named the EuroLeague's Player of the Month, for his overall work that month. He later helped Fenerbahçe repeat their place in the Finals of the EuroLeague, after helping them defeat Real Madrid, in the EuroLeague Final Four semifinals, by a score of 84–75. He had 14 points and 6 rebounds against Real Madrid. Two days later, Bogdanović would help the club win their first ever EuroLeague championship, as they beat out Olympiacos, by a score of 80–64, in the championship game. Afterwards, Bogdanović would lead Fenerbahçe to its second straight Turkish Super League Finals victory, by sweeping Beşiktaş Sompo Japan, and winning the Turkish Super League Finals MVP award in the process.\nIn 2020, he was named to the EuroLeague 2010–20 All-Decade Team.\nSacramento Kings (2017–2020).\nOn 26 June 2014, while playing for Partizan Belgrade, Bogdanović was selected by the Phoenix Suns with the 27th overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft. On 23 June 2016, on the night of the 2016 NBA draft, the Suns traded his rights to the Sacramento Kings along with Georgios Papagiannis, Skal Labissière and a future second-round pick, in exchange for the draft rights of Marquese Chriss.\nOn 13 July 2017, Bogdanović signed with the Sacramento Kings. He made his NBA debut on 23 October 2017, against the team that originally drafted him, the Phoenix Suns. Bogdanović recorded 12 points, 3 rebounds, and 2 assists in 25 minutes of play off the bench as the Kings lost 117–115.\nBogdanović was selected as a member of the Team World for the 2018 Rising Stars Challenge. He led Team World to a 155–124 win over Team USA with 26 points, 6 assists and 4 rebounds, while shooting 7 of 13 from the three-point line and was named the MVP of the game. The Sacramento Kings finished the season with 27–55 record, thus failing to qualify to the NBA playoffs for the twelfth season in a row. Bogdanović in his first NBA season had the averages of 11.8 points, 3.3 assists and 2.9 rebounds over 78 games.\nAfter the end of the season, he had an MRI procedure that revealed a slight tear of the medial meniscus in his left knee. On 24 April 2018, he underwent a meniscus debridement surgery in order to fully recover his left knee. On 22 May 2018, he was named to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team.\nBogdanović was selected as a member of the Team World for the 2019 Rising Stars Challenge. After missing first ten games due to an injury rehab, in his sophomore season with the club Bogdanović mainly played the role of sixth man and second unit leader. Over 70 games, he averaged career-highs of 14.1 points, 3.8 assists and 3.5 rebounds.\nIn his contract year with the club, Bogdanović averaged 15.1 points, 3.4 assists and 3.4 rebounds over 61 games. The 2019–20 NBA season was suspended in March as a result of COVID-19 pandemic and Sacramento Kings were invited for 22-team 2020 NBA Bubble. Eventually, they did not manage to qualify for the playoffs and finished the season with 31–41 record.\nAtlanta Hawks (2020–present).\nIn November 2020, the Kings attempted to sign-and-trade Bogdanović to the Milwaukee Bucks along with Justin James for Donte DiVincenzo, D. J. Wilson, and Ersan İlyasova. The trade unraveled when it was announced that the NBA was investigating the Bucks for having contact with Bogdanović and/or his agent before it was allowed under free agency rules. The Bucks reportedly felt double-crossed by the situation, decided not to pursue the trade further, and were stripped of their 2022 second-round draft pick at the conclusion of the investigation in December. According to Bogdanović, he was not aware of the trade and felt betrayed by the Kings. \nOn 24 November 2020, Bogdanović signed a four-year, $72 million contract with the Atlanta Hawks. Bogdanović would only play in 44 games during the 2020–21 regular season due to injuries, but set new career highs, averaging 16.4 points per game and shot 90.9% on free throws. Coincidentally, the Hawks faced the Bucks in the 2021 Eastern Conference Finals, which the Bucks won in six games before winning the NBA championship.\nAfter the 2021–22 season ended, Bogdanović underwent right knee surgery and was ruled out for at least three months. On 16 March 2023, he signed a four-year, $68 million contract extension with the Hawks.\nOn December 11, 2023, Bogdanović put up a career-high 40 points on 10 three-pointers made in a 129–122 loss to the Denver Nuggets. He also became the first player in Hawks history to put up at least 40 points and 10 three-pointers made in a game.\nNational team career.\nJunior national team.\nBogdanović's play with Žitko got him a training camp invite ahead of the 2009 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship in France, however he was quickly cut by head coach Vlada Jovanović since he was about to turn 17 at that time.\nIn the summer of 2010, Bogdanović was selected to represent Serbia by head coach Jovanović for the European under-18 Championship wherein they finished fourth in the tournament.\nThe following year, Bogdanović, while still with Partizan at the club level, was selected to play for Serbia's Under-19 national team under head coach Dejan Mijatović at the 2011 FIBA Under-19 World Championship in Latvia. Playing alongside Aleksandar Cvetković, Đorđe Drenovac, Luka Mitrović, Nemanja Dangubić, and Nemanja Bešović, they finished as a runner-up against a Jonas Valančiūnas-led Lithuanian team. Bogdanović averaged 8.9 points and 5 rebounds per game for the tournament.\nSenior national team.\nIn the EuroBasket 2013 in Slovenia, Bogdanović represented the senior Serbian national team, averaging 9.4 points, 4.3 rebounds, and 2 assists per game. Bogdanović was a member of the Serbian national basketball team that won the silver medal at the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup, under head coach Aleksandar Đorđević. He emerged in the knockout phase against Greece, Brazil, and France, and ended the tournament with averages of 12 points, 2.4 rebounds, and 2.8 assists per game, on 47% shooting.\nIn the last few pre-tournament friendly games for the EuroBasket 2015, Serbian team head coach Đorđević put Bogdanović on the bench due to the twenty-three-year-old player's persistent back injury problems. Despite that, he was named to the 12-man roster that represented Serbia at the EuroBasket. Throughout the first phase of the tournament, playing with pain injections, he saw limited minutes, and his production slightly decreased from the previous summer. Despite that, Serbia dominated in the tournament's toughest group, Group B, with a 5–0 record, and then eliminated Finland and Czech Republic in the round of 16 and quarterfinal games, respectively. However, they were stopped in the semifinal game by Lithuania, with a score of 67–64, and eventually lost to the tournament's host team, France, in the bronze-medal game, with a score of 81–68. Over 9 tournament games, Bogdanović averaged 8.9 points, 3.2 rebounds, and 3.2 assists per game, on 39.7% shooting from the field, and 27.1% shooting from the three-point line.\nBogdanović also represented Serbia at the 2016 Summer Olympics where they won the silver medal, after losing to the United States in the final game with 96–66.\nBogdanović also represented Serbia at the EuroBasket 2017 where they won the silver medal, after losing in the final game to Slovenia. With the absence of long-time team captain and leader Miloš Teodosić due to injury, Bogdanović stepped in as the team's leader. Over 9 tournament games, he averaged 20.4 points, 3.4 rebounds and 5 assists per game, on 47.4% overall field goal shooting. He was named All-Tournament Team.\nAt the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup, the national team of Serbia was dubbed as favorite to win the trophy, but was eventually upset in the quarterfinals by Argentina. With wins over the United States and Czech Republic, it finished in fifth place. Bogdanović was once again the best player in the team, averaging 22.9 points, 4.1 rebounds and 4.4 assists over 8 games, while shooting 55.6% from the field and 53% from the three-point line. For his performances, he was selected to the FIBA Basketball World Cup All-Tournament Team. With 183 points scored throughout the tournament, he was the FIBA Basketball World Cup Top Scorer by total points scored.\nBogdanović missed the EuroBasket 2022 due to a right knee surgery.\nBogdanović won silver medal at the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup with the Serbia national team. He averaged 19.1 points, 4.6 rebounds, 3.3 assists, and 2.1 steals per game. In recognition of his individual play, Bogdanović was named second time in a row to the World Cup All-Tournament Team.\nPersonal life.\nBogdanović is related to the late noted Serbian architect Bogdan Bogdanović, sharing the same name. In addition to basketball, he is also a fan of the \"World of Warcraft\" series of video games. On 10 April 2016, fans of Fenerbahçe named a star after Bogdan Bogdanović."

        "text": "Vasas SC is a Hungarian women's handball team. It is part of the Budapest-based multi-sports club Vasas SC. One of the most successful teams in the country, they have won the Hungarian championship a record 15 times and in 1982 they were also crowned as the European Champions Cup winners.\nBrief history.\n\"Hazena\", the early form of the modern handball, had been played across Europe for years, when, in 1926, based on the players who were fired by MTE for political reasons, \"Vas- és Fémmunkások Sport Clubja\" was founded. Until 1928 there was not an organized national championship and the hazena team participated only in several invitational tournaments. Due to financial reasons the club suspended its operations in 1931.\nAfter a financial consolidation the handball department of Vasas was reborn and entered the championship in 1938. The brightest year of this era was 1945, when Vasas won the second division title and gained promotion to the top level championship. However, just after a few years, due growing troubles the club decided to withdraw from the competitive handball once again.\nOn 7 March 1956 the Sport School of Angyalföld (\"Angyalföldi Sportiskola\") was founded. Under head coach József Ferenczy the Sport School performed brilliantly, having won several youth and junior titles. They also wanted to enter the adult competition, but the permit was not granted. Instead of that, they got the chance from Hungarian Handball Federation to join either \"Csavargyár\" or \"Vasas\". They have chosen Vasas and the team has risen from its ashes in 1960. With the ASI-girls on the board, under the new, team handball rules, Vasas entered the Budapest II championship and won it in their inaugural year and gained promotion. In 1962 they celebrated another promotion, this time from the Budapest I division to the NB II. In 1964 Vasas climbed to the NB I, the top-level league in Hungary. Although they suffered a surprise relegation in 1965, they spent only one season in the NB II. With the comeback in 1967 the brightest period in the club's life began.\nIn 1969 the Vasas lifted the Hungarian Cup trophy, followed by another Cup title in 1971. From 1972 they have won the Hungarian Championship an exceptional eleven times in a row – in 1977 and 1981 they did not even drop a single point throughout the season. Adding to this, they also won the Hungarian Cup eight times in this period. Their most successful year came in 1982, when Vasas did the treble: beside the Hungarian Championship and Hungarian Cup they took the European Champions Cup title as well.\nFrom the second part of the eighties the key players of the golden era either retired or moved abroad and the Hungarian Championship got more balanced as well, which led to Vasas slowly lost their dominant role.\nIn the nineties, after the transition, private companies took over the club and became their main sponsor. In short term Vasas benefited from it, they managed to put together a strong squad and the team was shining in the old glory. However, after these financials grown narrow, a disintegration process started. To save from cessation, in 2004 Vasas Sport Club took the team under control. In 2009, Vasas said goodbye to NB I.\nAfter eight years, the team was able to start the 2017/18 season again in the top division after winning the NB I / B Championship. However, the cutting-edge outing lasted only a year. The team was promoted again in 2021, but was eliminated at the end of the season.\nCrest, colours, supporters.\nKit manufacturers and Shirt sponsor.\nThe following table shows in detail Vasas SC kit manufacturers and shirt sponsors by year: \nTeam.\nCurrent squad.\nRW\nLW\nLB\nCB\nRB\nHonours.\nDomestic competitions.\nNemzeti Bajnokság I (\"National Championship of Hungary\")\nMagyar Kupa (\"National Cup of Hungary\")"

The tournament has run bi-annually since 2001, occasionally with more than one division. The tournament serves as a qualification tournament for the Under-19 World Cup. Canada are by far the most successful team overall, winning seven titles, to the three won by the United States and the single title won by Bermuda.\nHistory.\nPrior to the introduction of the Americas Under-19 Championship in 2001 there was no qualification route for associate and affiliate teams to the U-19 World Cup. As a result, the only Americas team represented in the 1998 competition was the full member, the West Indies. For the 2000 tournament, a combined Americas team was also given the chance to take part, representing the four longstanding associate members from the region: Canada, USA, Bermuda and Argentina.\nWith the new championship came the possibility for an individual team to qualify for the U-19 World Cup. The winner of each championship would automatically go through to play in the finals the following year.\nIn 2009, Under-19 World Cup qualification was changed dramatically and a World Cup Qualifier event was introduced in which the top two teams from each of the ICC regions would compete for the final six places in the U-19 World Cup. In addition to this, the Championship was expanded to two divisions due to the increase in the number of regional teams. The first Division Two tournament took place in 2010.\nRecords.\n\"Scorecards for some matches from the 2001 tournament are unavailable.\""

        "title": "Roll (gymnastics)",
        "text": "A roll is the most basic and fundamental skill in gymnastics class. There are many variations in the skill. Rolls are similar to flips in the fact that they are a complete rotation of the body, but the rotation of the roll is usually made on the ground while a flip is made in the air with the hips passing over the head and without any hands touching the ground. Rolls also help recover from a fall safely.\nForward roll.\nThe forward roll (colloquially called a roly poly) is one of the most basic elements in gymnastics and one of the first learnt. The forward roll is started from a standing position and then the gymnast crouches down, places their hands shoulder wide apart and hands facing forward. They tuck their chin to their chest and place the back of their head onto the floor. They then push off of the floor with their legs and rotate over their head onto their back. The gymnast then presses their feet onto the floor and whips the arms forward to stand up.\nBackward roll.\nThe backward roll is similar to the forward roll, but in reverse. The gymnast starts in a standing position and bends to a squat/sitting position with their arms in front. They then lower and lean back slightly until their bottom reaches the floor. They then continue this momentum and roll over their back onto their shoulders. They should then place their hands next to their shoulders and tuck their head into their chin. The hands then push the floor strongly and straighten their arms and continue to rotate their body over their head. The feet are then placed on the floor and the gymnast stands.\nVariations:\nSideways roll.\nA sideways roll is also known as a log roll, barrel roll, pencil roll, or sausage roll. This can be started by lying down on the back or front with the body outstretched. The gymnast then rolls onto their side and does a complete rotation of the body, remaining parallel to the performing surface. The log roll is a sideways roll with the hands next to the waist and the pencil roll is with the hands stretched above the head. A sideways roll can also be performed when a gymnast over-rotates or loses their balance in a vertical, forward or sideways direction.\nTucked sideways roll.\nA Tucked Sideways roll begins with the gymnast starting in a kneeling position, with the gymnast sitting back onto their heels with their head and arms in an outstretched position like the child pose in yoga. From here, the gymnast rolls onto their side with their legs maintaining the tucked position and onto their knees again.\nTin soldier roll/Teddy bear roll.\nThis roll starts by sitting on the floor in a straddle position. The legs are held below the knees and the body leans over towards the shoulder on one side. The gymnast then folds more tightly until they roll over their back and return to a sitting straddle position.\nDive roll.\nA dive roll is an acrobatic stunt that begins with a horizontal forward diving motion and results in a forward roll. It is considered an advanced forward roll, demonstrating flight and a smooth landing. It is also used in other sports such as wrestling and parkour to reinforce the motion of landing correctly. "

        "title": "National Basketball Ass'n v. Motorola, Inc.",
        "text": "National Basketball Association v. Motorola, 105 F.3d 841 (2d Cir. 1997) is a United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit case in which the National Basketball Association (NBA) purported that Motorola and STATS infringed the NBA's copyright on the broadcast of games and misappropriated the data presented on the SportsTrax pager.\nBackground.\nMotorola manufactured and marketed the SportsTrax paging device which uses game information supplied by Sports Team Analysis and Tracking Systems (\"STATS\"). It offers four modes of operation: \"current,\" \"statistics,\" \"final scores,\" and \"demonstration.\" STATS compiled its scores and statistics by employing people to listen or watch the games, then enter the scores on the computer which transmits the scores to STATS' on-line service, to be sent out to anyone using a SportsTrax pager.\nIn 1996, the National Basketball Association won in a federal Manhattan court the exclusive rights to transmit scores. The NBA claimed that Motorola infringed on the NBA through information misappropriation of the basketball (and baseball) games by arguing that the factual data about the game represents the overall value of the game. \nThe second circuit court of appeals addressed whether the 1976 copyright act preempted the state-law misappropriation claim.\nThe NBA asserted 6 claims: \nNew York state law misappropriation claim.\nDue to the case involving the International News Service (INS) and the Associated Press (AP) in 1918, New York created a misappropriation law. \"International News Service v. Associated Press\" was one of the early cases addressing the issue raised by technological advances, where the International News Service directly lifted factual stories from AP bulletins and wired them to newspapers.\nOpinion of the Court.\nThe district court dismissed all of the NBA's claims except the first - misappropriation under New York Law. The court also dismissed the counterclaim by Motorola that the NBA unlawfully interfered with Motorola's contractual sponsorship by four individual NBA teams.\nThe Second Circuit appellate court struck down the NBA's assertion that the games are copyrighted. \"Sports events are not 'authored' in any common sense of the word\"(21), arguing that if copyright was open to sporting events, \"the inventor of the T-formation in football\" would be able to control all uses of the T-formation and could cause problems with the prosperity of the sport.\nPreemption under the Copyright Act.\nThe district court's injunction was based on its conclusions that the defendants had unlawfully misappropriated the NBA's property rights in its games, under New York law. However, the Second Circuit found that \"the district court concluded that the NBA's misappropriation claim was not preempted because... the subject matter requirement was not met\"(39). The Second Circuit court argued that the copyright act should not be used to distinguish between copyright infringement and state-law misappropriation.\nInfringement of a copyright in the broadcasts of NBA games.\nThe Court noted that the broadcasts of the NBA games, not the games themselves, are entitled to copyright protection. The Copyright Act of 1909 was amended in 1976 specifically to protect the broadcast and meet the requirement that the original work of authorship be \"fixed in any tangible medium of expression\" (a).\nThe district court held that Motorola and STATS did not infringe NBA's copyright because only facts from the broadcasts, not the broadcasts themselves were transmitted. The Second Circuit Court agreed with the district court's argument that the \"[d]efendants provide purely factual information which any patron of an NBA game could acquire from the arena without any involvement from the director, cameramen, or others who contribute to the originality of the broadcast\" [939 F. Supp. at 1094].\nState law misappropriation claim.\nThe New York hot news misappropriation developed out of \"International News Service v. Associated Press\", a 1918 U.S. Supreme Court case. Great Britain prohibited INS reporters because INS's owner, William Randolph Hearst, was an outspoken critic of the allies and an open supporter of the Germans. In order to keep INS newspapers up to date with the latest information from the war, the INS would obtain the factual data from east coast AP news articles, then would send it out to subscribers on the west coast, occasionally beating the AP news stories. In order to deal with this, the Supreme court \"crafted a new variant of the common law tort of misappropriation\" called the \"hot news\" doctrine.\nNew York sought to apply ethical standards to the INS case and created its own body of misappropriation law. However, the Second Circuit Court found that the New York misappropriation law \"goes well beyond the 'hot news' claims and is preempted\". The court claimed that to survive a \"hot news\" \"INS\"-like claim, several elements were required: the plaintiff generates the information at a cost; the information is time-sensitive; the defendant is free riding off the plaintiff's efforts; and the defendant is in direct competition with a product or service offered by the plaintiffs, and in doing so, enables others to free ride off the efforts of the plaintiffs.\nReaction.\nThe Second Circuit Court dismissed the misappropriation claim and affirmed the district court's dismissal of NBA's claim of false advertising under the Lanham Act."

        "title": "Varsity (rowing regatta)",
        "text": "The Varsity is a rowing regatta on the Amsterdam–Rhine Canal in Houten, Netherlands each Spring. The Varsity is the oldest and most prestigious student rowing regatta in the Netherlands.\nThe Varsity is one of the few rowing races that is exclusive to students and a fever-pitch rivalry exists between participants. Traditional elements are combined with contemporary rowing races. For instance, while rowing crews defend the honour of the club on the water, spectators on the dike are traditionally brawling with equal fanaticism. The main event is the Oude Vier (Varsity Four, literally 'Old Four') which is rowed in a 4+ over a distance of 3 km. All other events row the standard 2 km distance in common race rowing classes such as the 4+, 4-, 2- and single scull. Some races are in traditional clinker-built boats.\nThe Varsity has influenced many of the traditions in student rowing in the Netherlands.\nVictories.\nTwo races in 1915 and 1916 are not counted towards the total score because of World War I in the Netherlands. During the COVID-19 pandemic the race couldn't be rowed.\nHistory.\nPrelude.\nThe history of the Varsity began with the establishment of the first student rowing club in the Netherlands. On 5 June 1874 J.W.T. Cohen Stuart founded K.S.R.V. \"Njord\" in Leiden with the patronage of Prince Henry of the Netherlands.This inspired other students to form their own rowing clubs. In 1876, D.S.R.V. Laga was founded in Delft. In 1878 G.S.R. Aegir was founded in Groningen. All these student rowing clubs of this period started as subdivisions of bigger and older student corporations like Vindicat atque Polit.\nIn England, rowing was a more developed sport at the time and already had a tradition of university races. The Boat Race between Oxford and University inspired a similar Dutch race. In 1878 Njord challenged Laga. Laga accepted the challenge and raced against Njord on 2 July 1878 on the 'Galgewater' (Gallows water) in Leiden. The race contained two turning-buoys and was 3200 meters long. Laga won by 12 seconds. The rematch was two years later, and has been held almost every year since then.\nMembers of Aegir dispute the official history and claim that both clubs decided to race in celebration of the founding of Aegir in February 1878.\nThe early days.\nA third competitor joined in 1882, from Utrecht. This was a key point in the history of the Varsity and student rowing in the Netherlands. The three clubs decided to form the Koninklijke Nederlandsche Studenten Roeibond or KNSRB (Dutch Student Rowing Association). This body would be responsible for the development of student rowing and the organisation of the Varsity.\nThe first official Varsity was held on 30 June 1883. In this race, the turning-buoy was a decisive factor, as Laga and Triton collided at the turn did not finish the race.\nIn the following years, the race grew in size. There were more boat classes, more competitors and more spectators. The race moved to Haarlem in 1885 after residents complained about the disturbance of the Sunday rest. In Haarlem was it possible to race without buoys. Rowing crews started to train daily for the race. This was unusual at the time and resulted in some crews dominating for years. The race moved again in 1902 to the Zweth, a brook between Delft and Rotterdam. Because of the narrow waterway, only two crews could race at a time. Qualifications for the final were necessary until another move in 1914 to the North Sea Canal.\nAegir joined the KNSRB and participated for in the Varsity for the first time in1918, 40 years after its founding. The long distance from Groningen to the other clubs had prevented them for joining earlier. They won their first varsity with a six-boat-length lead. but it would take another 38 years for their second victory.\n1930–1940.\nIn 1930, some drunken Varsity spectators infiltrated the Royal Palace of Amsterdam, which led to questions in parliament. The race was relocated to the Bosbaan in Amstelveen in 1937 to avoid further trouble near the palace. This sparked a huge controversy in the rowing world, as the Bosbaan was only 2000 meters long instead of the traditional 3000 meters. Furthermore, the course was too narrow to fit the five boats of the competition. Honorary members of the KNSRB resigned over the dispute, and the 1937 winners refused their prize in protest of the new location. At the same time it was debated to mark the coxless four as the main event instead of the coxed four. Laga proposed that the race be moved to a new location, and Triton suggested Jutphaas as a new venue for the races. Triton swore an oath to organise the Varsity on behalf of the KNSRB, as long as the race was rowed in Utrecht. They have kept this oath to this day.\nSecond World War.\nThe Varsity was banned under German occupation. However, Triton was allowed to organise the Varsity in 1941 as part of their lustrum. Later that year, after the German occupiers banned Jewish students from eductation, all student rowing clubs closed their gates. A mock Varsity was held in a Japanese internment camp. Representatives of the student rowing clubs created a game where dice determined the outcome. They used cardboard to make a 5-meter track, boats, finish tower and even painted the boats in the correct colours. Members and supporters of the student rowing clubs created the traditional outfit and practised the anthem of the club. Representatives of each pre-war KNSRB club (Njord, Laga, Triton, Nereus, Aegir) competed for the main event, while Argo, a non-KNSRB club, only could participate in the skiff, double four and in the eight. Triton won the race after a thrilling race against Laga.\n1946–1959.\nAlthough Nereus, Aegir and Argo lost their boathouses during the war, all KNSRB-clubs (Including Argo for the first time) competed in the 1946 Varsity. Triton won the race, but this Varsity is mostly remembered because the KNSRB received the honorary title 'Koninklijke' (Royal). Since then it's the KNSRB. After the war the Varsity gained more prestige and the NOS started televise the race.\n1960–present.\nIn the 1960s the role of the parent societies, the student corporations, changed. Independent rowing clubs were founded, without a student corporation as a parent. These rowing clubs were not allowed to join the KNSRB, but needed representation. Therefore, at the initiative of the KNSRB, all student rowing clubs formed the NSRF ( (Dutch Student Row Federation). KNSRB clubs became members of both organisations.\nIn 1973, the KNSRB clubs decided that all NSRF clubs should be able to participate in the Varsity. This led to major changes in the race. For the first time since 1914, qualifications were necessary. The big culture difference between the new and the old clubs proved to be a difficult challenge for both sides. New clubs did not like the distance and distinctive race rules. They also objected to the traditional fighting and brawling between KNSRB club members. KNSRB members showed their disappointment by wearing black belts during the first 'joined' Varsity. Since then the relationship normalised, although many KNSRB members misbehaved when a non-KNSRB club, Orca, won the varsity in 1980.\nIn the 1970s, club members of Laga, Aegir, Skadi and Njord began to brawl earlier in the rowing season for the expected victory in the Varsity. The would compete for a (frozen) chicken that hung from the ceiling in Njord's boathouse. This tradition, called 'kipvechten' (chicken fighting) was supposed to predict the Varsity winner. In the mid-2000s Njord decided to stop hosting this event due to many injuries and damages to their boathouse.\nThe Varsity moved to their current location on the Amsterdam-Rhine Canal in 1971. Since then the race has stayed in Houten except for a one-year return to the Bosbaan.\nDuring the 134st Varsity in 2017 the organisation introduced a second main event: the women's coxless four. This first race was won by Nereus."

        "title": "2002 Asian Games medal table",
        "text": "The 2002 Asian Games (officially known as the 14th Asian Games) was a multi-sport event held in Busan, South Korea from September 29 to October 14, 2002. Busan was the second South Korean city to host the Games, after Seoul in 1986. A total of 6,572 athletes—4,605 men and 1,967 women—from 44 Asian National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated in 38 sports divided into 419 events. The number of competing athletes was higher than the 1998 Asian Games, in which 6,544 athletes from 41 NOCs participated. It was the first time in the history of the Asian Games that all 44 member nations of the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) participated in the Games. Afghanistan returned after the fall of the Taliban government in the midst of ongoing war; East Timor, newest member of the OCA made its debut; and North Korea competed for the first time in an international sporting event hosted by South Korea. Both nations marched together at the opening ceremony with a Korean Unification Flag depicting the Korean Peninsula as United Korea.\nAthletes from 39 nations won at least one medal, and athletes from 27 of these nations secured at least one gold. Eight NOCs—Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, India, Singapore, Vietnam, Qatar, Philippines and Kyrgyzstan—improved their position in the general medal table compared to the 1998 Asian Games. China topped the medal table for the sixth consecutive time in the Asian Games, with 150 gold medals. Athletes from China won the most silver medals (84) and the most medals overall (308). China became the first nation in the history of Asian Games to cross the 300 medal-mark in one edition. Competitors from the South Korea led the bronze medal count with 84. South Korea also won 96 gold medals, 80 silver medals and a total of 260 medals, finishing second on the medal table. Japanese athletes claimed 189 medals in total (including 44 gold), earning third spot on the table.\nMedal table.\nThe ranking in this table is consistent with International Olympic Committee convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won (in this context, a nation is an entity represented by a NOC). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next, followed by the number of bronze medals. If nations are still tied, equal ranking is given; they are listed alphabetically by IOC country code.\nA total of 1,350 medals (427 gold, 421 silver and 502 bronze) were awarded. The total number of bronze medals is greater than the total number of gold or silver medals, because two bronze medals were awarded per event in 10 sports: badminton, boxing, judo, karate, sepak takraw, squash, table tennis, taekwondo, tennis, and wushu (sanshou event only). \nThis discrepancy is also caused by ties. In men's artistic gymnastics, a three-way tie for the gold medal in the horizontal bar meant that no silver and bronze medals were awarded; in the pommel horse, rings and parallel bars ties for first positions resulted in two golds per event, and thus no silvers were awarded; and a tie for silver in the individual all-around resulted in no bronze being awarded. In women's artistic gymnastics, ties for the gold medal in the uneven bars and floor meant that no silvers were awarded for those events. In athletics, a three-way tie in the men's high jump, and ties in the men's 3,000 m steeplechase and the women's high jump for second place meant that no bronzes were awarded for those events. In men's bowling, a tie for second place in the singles and trios resulted in two silver medals per event, and thus no bronzes were awarded; a tie for the bronze-medal position in the doubles and the team of five meant that two bronzes were awarded for each event. In softball, due to rainy weather at the final competition the ranking was decided by the results of the preliminary round and semifinals. Japan was awarded the gold medal based on its unbeaten record in the preliminary games; China and Chinese Taipei shared the silver. Those two were to have played to decide who would meet Japan in the gold-medal game. In swimming, a tie for first position in the men's 50 m freestyle resulted in two gold medals and no silver was awarded; a tie for second position in the women's 100 m freestyle meant that no bronze medal was awarded.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nChanges in medal standings.\nOn October 7, 2002, the Olympic Council of Asia announced that the bodybuilding bronze medalist in the +90 kg weight category Youssef El-Zein of Lebanon was relieved of his medal for not submitting to a drugs test. After El-Zein was disqualified, the bronze medal in the +90 kg category went to Choi Jae-Duck of South Korea (who had finished fourth).\nSix days later, Japanese news agency Kyodo News reported that Indian middle distance runner Sunita Rani had tested positive for a banned substance, which was later confirmed by Lee Choon-Sup, Deputy Secretary General of the Busan Asian Games Organizing Committee; an unofficial report stated that the substance was the anabolic steroid nandrolone. Sunita had won two medals in athletics: a gold in the 1,500 m (setting an Asian Games record) and a bronze in the 5,000 m, (in which Sunita jointly bettered the Games record set by Indonesian Suprianti Sutono in Bangkok during the 1998 Asian Games with six other athletes). The Indian Chef de Mission at the Games backed Sunita—who denied using any banned drug—and asked for a \"B\" sample test from Bangkok, but tests were run only at the Asian Games’ Doping Control Center (AGDCC) in Seoul (the laboratory accredited by the IOC). On October 16, the AGDCC confirmed the steroid nandrolone in Sunita's urine sample; as a consequence, the OCA stripped her of both medals and dismissed her Asian Games record for the 1,500 m. \nThe Indian Olympic Association (IOA) requested the intervention of the International Association of Athletics Federations and the IOC; the samples were jointly reexamined by the World Anti-Doping Agency and the IOC Sub-Commission on Doping and Biochemistry of Sport. In January 2003, the OCA announced that the IOC Medical Director had cleared Sunita of the doping charge and that appropriate action would be taken against the AGDCC. Both of Sunita's medals were reinstated on February 4, 2003, in a ceremony attended by the Secretary General of OCA Randhir Singh and the president of the IOA Suresh Kalmadi."

Hawkins has been involved with youth rugby and as a coach of many different levels of rugby for many years. Hawkins is dedicated to developing talent at the youth rugby level and Collegiate level in America. Hawkins has been quoted as saying that his ultimate goal is to help the USA Men's and Women's Sevens Team reach gold at the Olympic Games.\nHawkins started coaching the Belmont Sevens team with James Walker in 2009 after sustaining a major injury that put him out of playing for many months. That year he coached Belmont to claim their first National Sevens Title. In 2010 Hawkins again stepped in to coach the Belmont Sevens team and he played. That year Belmont qualified both their A and B side to the National Sevens Championships. That year Belmont fell at the last hurdle, finishing second. In 2011 Hawkins returned again to just coach the Belmont Shore Sevens team and they went on to win the National Championships for a second time in three years.\nHawkins has been involved with youth rugby in the States, namely the Coastal Dragons Youth Rugby Team which calls Encinitas its home base. The Coastal Dragons are a youth rugby program that has 150 registered members and is constantly growing and is spreading the game of Rugby. Hawkins also contracted at two high school rugby teams, Torrey Pines High School in San Diego, CA and La Costa Canyon High School in San Diego, CA. Although these two schools are big rivals, he helped out at both ends.\nOn 1 August 2013, USA Rugby announced that Hawkins would take over as head coach of the Men's Sevens National Team, after Alexander Magleby's decision to step down. The US fared poorly under Hawkins, however, finishing a disappointing 13th on the World Series, and Hawkins was removed at the end of the 2013–14 season."

In 1991 they returned with sponsor De Schiestreek, followed by the Rotterdam firm Idetrading in 1995. After a sponsorless year, Gunco then again returned as title sponsor in 1999.

In 2002, the team took the name Rotterdam Basketbal, without sponsorname. In 2007 the team was renamed to Rotterdam Challengers, but in 2010 they again took the name Rotterdam Basketbal. Starting with the 2011–2012 season, the name became Rotterdam Basketbal College, to underline the importance of the youth in the team. During the 2013–14 season, the club got a new main sponsor in Challenge Sports and the team's name was changed to Challenge Sports Rotterdam.\nIn May 2018, Rotterdam reached the DBL semi-finals for the first time in 12 years, after upsetting Den Bosch in the quarter-finals, 1–2.

Hoffman began surfing off San Onofre, California. In 1953, he was one of the first surfers to brave the outer reefs of the Oahu's North Shore where he was a big wave surfing pioneer. Hoffman also worked as an abalone fisherman while he was not surfing.\nHoffman California Fabrics.\nIn the late 1950s, Hoffman helped run his family's textile business, Hoffman California Fabrics, along with his brother Walter. The company was started in 1924 by their father Rube Hoffman, originally selling woolen flannel fabrics. Hoffman oversaw the company's business that sold directly to retail stores. He was also involved in researching the production processes and creating new designs Hoffman Fabrics was integral in creating and manufacturing surf apparel from the late 1950s onward. In the 1980s, the aloha shirt worn by Tom Selleck in the TV series \"Magnum, P.I. \"was made from Hoffman fabric.

Kruk is absent in the Wii version.\nCover athlete.\nRoy Halladay of the Philadelphia Phillies is the cover athlete of the game replacing Gold Glove Award winner Evan Longoria from \"MLB 2K10\".\nNew features.\nPC, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3.\nThe \"main\" version of \"MLB 2K11\" retains the features of \"Major League Baseball 2K10\" but adds new content. Some of the new features include the Dynamic Player Rating System (DPRS), which updates a players ability with the last four weeks of a real player's activity, which will include slumps and hot streaks. The DPRS will only affect hitting and pitching; it will not affect a player's fielding ability. There will be no option to play without the DRPS turned on, however, the DPRS does not affect trades, due to the DPRS being a short term value. Franchise modes will reflect player values based on franchise stats, not real life. The My Player career mode has similarly been improved and tweaked.\nThe umpires will now have a more random strike zone, while pitch ratings affect ability to locate pitches. The game will feature more AI gameplay sliders than any MLB 2K game before, and for the first time, tweaking sliders will not affect achievements. Poor fielders will be \"locked out\" of good animations, and the fielding rating will affect how close to the ball the fielder must be to reach it. Base stealing has been revamped, and will take into account many variables such as the speed of the runner, type of pitch, lead, and the catcher's arm.\nWii.\nThe Wii version has its own unique features, including the Mini-Diamond, a new multiplayer mode set in fantasy venues, such as a low gravity Space ballpark to a Circus environment, while the Total Control Pitching and Hitting feature utilizes the Wii Remote and Nunchuk. The Wii version also retains the Franchise, Tournament and Home Run Derby modes of the main version. There is no \"My Player\" or \"MLB Today\" career mode for the Wii.\nPlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable.\nThe PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable versions are less feature-rich than the main version as they are reskins of Major League Baseball 2K6, but they still feature Franchise and Season play, the Home Run Derby and a unique Manager Showdown feature in which a player sets up a lineup and a starting pitcher and plays the game strictly from the manager's role as strategist. The PSP version adds The Farm, which allows the player to engage in Minor League Baseball games.\nNintendo DS.\nThe Nintendo DS version features both a Season Mode and a Postseason Mode, as well as utilizing the touch screen for the Total Control Pitching and Hitting Feature. The game also features 250 collectible virtual trading cards.\nPromotion.\nIn January, game publisher 2K Sports announced that they would continue a contest from the previous year. Players had a chance to win $1,000,000 for pitching a perfect game on the Xbox 360 or PS3 versions of the game. The contest began on April 1, 2011. This caused controversy as former WWE wrestler, Stevie Richards had done this before and tried to claim the Million dollars for the Perfect Game he had pitched but had done it before the contest officially began. Brian Kingrey, a music teacher from Hammond, Louisiana, claimed the prize by throwing a perfect game with Roy Halladay within two hours of the start of the contest.\nReception.\nReception for the game has been mixed. IGN rated both the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions with a 7.0 while the readers favored the 360 version of the game over the PS3 ranging from a 7.3 out of 10 for the 360 to a 6.5 out of 10 for the PS3. The 360 version of the game ran at a smoother frame rate according to most reviews. \"GameZone\" gave the game a 7/10, stating \"Overall, it is still a unique baseball experience, but unfortunately, after playing it for a little while, you will want an improved product. Let's hope for something even better in 2012.\" GameSpot gave the game a 7.5/10, praising its online mode improvements, but criticizing its lack of significant changes from last year's version of the game. There were also complaints of several bugs, such as the player fatigue in Franchise mode (player energy would decrease if a game was simulated, but not if the game was actually played) and injury recovery (pitchers who were on \"rehab assignments\" after injuries would not appear in management screens for setting pitching rotations, yet a player would have to clear a roster spot for him and could only access him from the bullpen; players affected by this bug also could not be demoted or promoted to different levels of the organization). One of the more frustrating aspects of the game is the extraordinarily poor managerial decisions made by computer-controlled teams. Intentional walks are often issued with only one out and under other conditions where such decisions would be unlikely in a real baseball game. Pitchers are removed from games too early, sometimes when pitching shutouts and showing no obvious signs of fatigue. The computer-controlled team will often attempt steals under unfavorable conditions, particularly attempts to steal third base when the computer-controlled team is down by multiple runs and the base runner is already in scoring position with strong batters coming to the plate. The computer-controlled team also tends to bring in a left-handed relief pitcher to face right-handed batters (and vice versa) when the bullpen has good right-handed relief pitchers available and the right-handed batter is more likely to make an out under such a match-up. Finally, the relief pitcher is often allowed to bat, even though they are going to be replaced in the next inning and the bench is full of potential batters. \nSoundtrack.\nThere is a different menu screen for the Wii versions \"2K BEATS\" screen."

The tournament acts as a qualifier for the Under-19 World Cup.\nThe tournament was first held in 2001, and has been held regularly since 2007. Prior to 2001, EAP teams could attempt to qualify for the World Cup via the Youth Asia Cup, an Asian Cricket Council (ACC) event. In 2003 and 2005, a joint event was organised with the African Cricket Association.\nPapua New Guinea have won the most editions of the tournament, with six titles, and also won the 2003 joint Africa/EAP tournament. Fiji (2015), Japan (2019) and New Zealand (2023) have also won the tournament.\nHistory.\nSince its inception, the EAP U-19 Cricket Trophy has provided a chance for EAP teams to qualify for the U-19 World Cup. Prior to the initial 2001 competition, however, EAP teams qualified via the Youth Asia Cup. In the 1997 event, Papua New Guinea qualified alongside then associate side Bangladesh to qualify for the 1998 U-19 World Cup. No EAP sides qualified from the 1999 competition.\nIn the first EAP U-19 Trophy, only the two most long standing EAP members participated, Papua New Guinea and Fiji alongside ACC side Hong Kong. Papua New Guinea won the three team event and so qualified for their second U-19 World Cup in 2002.\nDuring the interim years when an EAP competition was not organised, a joint qualification event with the African Cricket Association took place. Once again, only Fiji and Papua New Guinea participated from the EAP region and World Cup qualification was only achieved by Papua New Guinea for the 2004 U-19 World Cup.\nWith an increase of teams from the EAP region able to participate, a standalone EAP Trophy once again took place in 2007 with Papua New Guinea and Fiji joined by Vanuatu and Japan. By 2009 there were five teams with the inclusion of Indonesia. In 2007 only one team qualified but in 2009 two teams went through to a further stage of qualification, the Under-19 World Cup Qualifier.\nIn the 2020 Under-19 Cricket World Cup qualification, Papua New Guinea and Japan were undefeated going into the final game against each other. However, Papua New Guinea forfeited the match after Cricket PNG suspended eleven members of the squad due to breaching the team's code of conduct. Japan thus qualified for its first ever Under-19 World Cup.\nRecords.\n\"This section includes performances by EAP teams and players at the 2003 and 2005 combined Africa/EAP tournaments.\""

The last champion was John Higgins.\nHistory.\nThe tournament was originally called the Charity Challenge. The event was unique by having the players compete for charity, with the prize money being donated to their respective causes. The event started in the 1994/1995 season and was contested by a 16-man field, but was reduced to an 8-man field by the 1996/1997 season. The event is most notable for Stephen Hendry compiling a maximum break in the deciding frame of the 1997 final against Ronnie O'Sullivan. It is the only time that a maximum break has been made in the deciding frame of a final in professional competition.&lt;ref name=\"http://www.cajt.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nAfter five seasons the charity aspect was dropped and replaced with a new format. The event was re-branded the Champions Cup and was contested by the players, who won major tournaments in the previous season. In its inaugural year it adopted a “winner takes all” format with a £175,000 prize going to the winner, with the other contestants receiving nothing. The winner's prize was the second highest after the World Championship. In subsequent years the event had a more conventional prize money schedule.\nThe tournament was sponsored by Liverpool Victoria for all but the last two events. In 2000 the event was sponsored by TVN and there was no sponsor in 2001. The event was broadcast on ITV, but was dropped from the calendar after the 2001 event due to ITV discontinuing its snooker coverage."

He played all or part of eight seasons in Major League Baseball between 1923 and 1934 with the Detroit Tigers, Chicago White Sox, and the Washington Senators in the American League, primarily as a second baseman.\nEarly career.\nKerr made his professional baseball debut in 1923. He split that season and 1924 between the Tigers and the minor leagues, then went out west to the Pacific Coast League in 1925. After playing one season with the Salt Lake City Bees and three more with the Hollywood Stars, he was drafted by the White Sox in the 1928 rule 5 draft.\nWhite Sox.\nKerr became the White Sox starting second baseman in 1929, replacing Bill Hunnefield, who would be traded to the Toledo Mud Hens in midseason. He batted .258 in his first full major league season, hitting his first major league home run on August 21 off New York Yankees pitcher Ed Wells.\nKerr missed parts of the 1930 season with various injuries, winding up as the backup middle infielder behind Bill Cissell and Greg Mulleavy. However, he returned to starting in 1931, batting .268 with a career-high 50 runs batted in. After the season, he was traded to the Senators with outfielder Carl Reynolds in exchange for pitchers Bump Hadley and Sad Sam Jones, as well as infielder Jackie Hayes, who would replace him as the starting second baseman.\nLater career.\nKerr spent the next three seasons on the Senators' bench behind second baseman Buddy Myer and future Hall of Fame shortstop Joe Cronin. During his tenure in Washington, he never played more than 51 games. He was on the Senators roster in 1933 when they lost in the World Series to the New York Giants. Kerr's sole appearance came in the finale (Game 5) when he pinch ran for centerfielder Fred Schulte with 2 out in the bottom of the 10th inning. In 1935, he served as a coach for the Senators, but in 1936 he became a player-manager in the Boston Red Sox organization. \nIn 471 games over eight major league seasons, Kerr posted a .266 batting average (388-for-1457) with 172 runs, 6 home runs, 145 RBI and 115 bases on balls. He finished his career with a .966 fielding percentage playing at second and third base and shortstop.\nHe spent the next five seasons playing and managing in the minor leagues. He managed in the Class B Western International League from 1937 to 1940. The first 3 seasons were with the Vancouver Maple Leafs, he was then hired to manage the Wenatchee Chiefs, a New York Yankees affiliate. His final season in baseball was 1941 when he managed and played second base for the Cheyenne Indians of the Class D Western League."

        "text": "The 2010–11 Pittsburgh Panthers women's basketball team represented the University of Pittsburgh in the 2010–11 NCAA Division I women's basketball season. The Panthers, coached by Agnus Berenato, suffered their first losing season since 2004-05. The Panthers are a member of the Big East Conference and play their home games at the Petersen Events Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\nPrevious season.\nThe 2010-11 Pitt women's basketball went 16-15, a disappointing finish considering that in December, the team had climbed as high as 15th in the nation in both the AP and Coaches' national polls. Finishing with the 12th seed in the Big East tournament, the Panthers lost in the first round of the tournament to Louisville, but still earned its fifth straight post-season national tournament appearance in the 2010 Women's National Invitation Tournament. However, Pitt lost its opening game in the WNIT at Toledo.\nOffseason.\nThe Panthers return four starters, losing only starting forward sophomore Pepper Wilson. The offseason was characterized with an unusual turnover in both players and coaching staff. Center/forward Pepper Wilson, sophomore forward Kate Popovec, and sophomore guard Sarah Ogoke transferred, while assistant coaches Jeff Williams, Caroline McCombs, and Yolette McPhee-McCuin all left to pursue additional opportunities. Incoming players include forward Kyra Dunn as well as guards Marquel Davis, Yasmin Fuller, and Asia Logan. This leaves the Panthers with an unusual distribution of players by academic class, with five seniors and six freshman, but with no juniors or sophomores. New coaches include the former head coach of the WNBA's New York Liberty, Patty Coyle, along with Khadija Head, and former Pitt point guard Mallorie Winn.\nThe women's basketball team enters the season with modest external expectation having been picked to finish 13th in the Big East Conference in a preseason poll of conference coaches. The Panthers started the season receiving two votes in the preseason national top 25 AP Poll.\nSchedule.\nPitt's 2010-11 schedule.\n!colspan=9| Exhibition\n!colspan=9| Regular Season\n!colspan=9| Postseason†&lt;br&gt;Big East Women's Basketball Championship"

        "text": "Andrew Campbell (born February 4, 1988) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey defenseman. He played for the Los Angeles Kings, Arizona Coyotes, and Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League (NHL). Campbell was drafted by the Kings in the third round, 74th overall of the 2008 NHL Entry Draft. He was born and raised in Caledonia, Ontario.\nPlaying career.\nCampbell played three seasons of major junior hockey with the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL). The Caledonia, Ontario native was drafted by the Los Angeles Kings in the third round, 74th overall of the 2008 NHL Entry Draft. He is nicknamed 'Soupy'. \nCampbell began his professional career playing for the Manchester Monarchs of the American Hockey League (AHL) during the 2008–09 AHL season. After playing 298 games with the Monarchs, scoring 8 goals and 50 points he was signed by the Los Angeles Kings on July 3, 2012 to a two-year entry-level contract. On April 5, 2014, after playing 444 games in the AHL, Campbell finally made his NHL debut for the Kings in a 2–1 loss against the Vancouver Canucks. He replaced an injured Drew Doughty. Campbell played two more games for the Kings that year but finished the season with the Monarchs scoring 3 goals and 16 points in 69 games.\nAfter spending the first six years of his professional career entirely within the Kings organization, Campbell left as a free agent to sign a one-year contract with the Arizona Coyotes on July 1, 2014. In the 2014–15 season, Campbell was originally assigned to AHL affiliate, the Portland Pirates. Campbell would later be recalled and remained in the NHL for the duration of the season with the Coyotes, appearing in 33 games from the blueline registering one point. He played alongside Connor Murphy on the third pairing. Despite experiencing a break through season in the NHL, Campbell was unable to attract an NHL offer as a free agent and on July 3, 2015, was signed to a one-year AHL contract with the Toronto Marlies. Later that year, on September 29, Campbell signed a two-year, two-way contract with the Marlies' parent club, the Toronto Maple Leafs. He was reassigned to continue with the Marlies, and was later named team captain. Campbell appeared in 6 games with the Maple Leafs and 6 goals and 22 points in 75 games with the Marlies. \nOn July 1, 2017, having left the Maple Leafs as a free agent, Campbell agreed to a return with the Arizona Coyotes in signing a two-year, two-way contract. He played the season with the Tucson Roadrunners, the AHL affiliate of the Coyotes, registering 2 goals and 6 points in 60 games while serving as the team's captain. On July 12, 2018, Campbell was part of a multi-player deal between the Coyotes and the Chicago Blackhawks, being sent along with Marcus Krüger, Jordan Maletta, prospect MacKenzie Entwistle, and a fifth-round pick in 2019 in exchange for the contract of Marián Hossa, Vinnie Hinostroza, Jordan Oesterle, and a third-round pick in 2019. He was sent down to the Blackhawks' AHL affiliate, the Rockford IceHogs, and was named captain of the Western Conference All-Star Team that year. Campbell went unsigned at the end of the season and became an unrestricted free agent.\nCoaching career.\nCampbell joined the Hamilton Bulldogs as an assistant coach for the 2019–20 OHL season working under head coach Vince Laise. After Laise was fired in March 2020, Campbell was retained by general manager Steve Staios who took over, and then by new incoming coach, Jay McKee."

        "text": "The 2001 NBDL Supplemental Draft was a supplemental draft for the newly formed National Basketball Association Development League (abbreviated NBDL from 2001 through 2004, then NBADL since 2005). It was held on November 3, 2001, before the league's inaugural 2001–02 season, and took place two days after the 2001 NBDL Draft. The supplemental draft was a one-time occurrence designed to fill out the league's rosters and to ensure competitive play. In this draft, all eight of the league's charter teams took turns selecting available recent college graduates, semi-professional and/or professional players. The draft consisted of four rounds of eight selections each, but there were five instances of a team passing on their draft selection. In all, 27 players were drafted out of 32 possible selections; the Huntsville Flight and Fayetteville Patriots passed on two players apiece, while the Columbus Riverdragons passed on one.\nLorenzo Coleman, a center who graduated from Tennessee Tech in 1998, was the first overall selection. Nearly half (11) of the 27 players selected in the supplemental draft were also chosen in an NBA draft. Among them, Kaniel Dickens later became an NBA Development League All-Star after the annual contest began in 2007. No other players in the NBDL Supplemental Draft were ever selected as D-League All-Stars. The oldest player taken in the 2001 NBDL Supplemental Draft was Dwayne Schintzius, who had graduated from Florida in 1990 and was 33 years old on draft day. Schintzius had spent the 1990s playing in the NBA for six different teams before ending up in the D-League. The D-League's first-season MVP was Ansu Sesay, who had been selected 14th overall in the Supplemental Draft by the Greenville Groove.\nThere were two schools that had two different players drafted. Florida's Schintzius and Brent Wright were selected 18th and 22nd overall, respectively, while Charlotte had Kelvin Price and Galen Young go 7th and 19th overall, respectively."

It was the 125th edition of the Wimbledon Championships and were held from 20 June to 3 July 2011. It was the third Grand Slam tennis event of the year and was part of the ATP World Tour, the WTA Tour, the ITF Junior Tour, the NEC Tour and the London Prepares series of test events for the following year's London Olympics. The championships were organised by the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club and the International Tennis Federation.\nIn the professional tournaments there were two new singles champions for the first time since 2002: Novak Djokovic and Petra Kvitová. By reaching the final Djokovic also claimed the World No. 1 in the ATP rankings from Rafael Nadal, while Kvitová became the first Grand Slam event winner born in the 1990s. In the doubles the Bryan brothers claimed the men's title for a second time, and equalled the overall Grand Slam tournament record of 11 set by the Woodies, Mark Woodforde and Todd Woodbridge. In the women's doubles Katarina Srebotnik won her first ladies major title after making four previous major finals. Srebotnik won alongside Květa Peschke; this was Peschke's first major title. In the mixed doubles Jürgen Melzer won his second major title, and first in the mixed doubles as he partnered Iveta Benešová to her first major title.

The girls doubles title was claimed by Canadian Eugenie Bouchard and American Grace Min.\nIn the wheelchair events Esther Vergeer and Sharon Walraven retained their doubles title. This was Vergeer's third successive win at the championships and meant that she was still unbeaten at Wimbledon. In the men's event Maikel Scheffers and Ronald Vink completed a team career Grand Slam, as they won the only title they had previously failed to win as a team.\nThe legends events titles were won by the teams of: Lindsay Davenport and Martina Hingis, the Dutch pair of Jacco Eltingh and Paul Haarhuis, and the Australian pair of Pat Cash and Mark Woodforde.\nTournament.\nThe 125th edition of the tournament saw two new courts opened.

A total of 19 courts were used for competition play and a further 22 for practice. The capacity of the grounds was thus increased by 1,000 to 38,500.\nOn a commercial front, Sony became a sponsor of the championships for the first time, while Jacob's Creek and Lavazza replaced Blossom Hill and Nescafe as official wine and coffee of the tournament.

To mark the occasion a number of special events and activities occurred. \"Blue Peter\" broadcast a special programme looking at the championships, past, present and future, which was screened on the second Monday of the tournament. Four 30-minute documentaries charting the history of the championships were commissioned. A new exhibition known as the queue was held in the All England Club's Museum celebrating the people who queue each year for tickets to the championship. In addition, a range of licensed merchandise featuring the \"125\" logo was released; the ball boy and ball girl uniforms had this logo. The shoes provided by Fila had the words \"125 years\" and the logo printed on them. The balls provided by Slazenger also had \"125 years\" stamped onto them, and a special can design was used. Lanson champagne, which is served on the grounds, had \"125 years\" stamped on the bottle. Finally, to celebrate the anniversary there was a community art project in which participants were asked to \"interpret\" an unstrung wooden tennis racket \"in a medium of their choosing\".\nHSBC held a series of polls on the Wimbledon website to find the 10 greatest things about the championships. The polls consisted of anything from greatest character to best final. In addition the bank also teamed up with the Sports Technology Institute at Loughborough University; to predict how tennis would develop over the next 25 years up to 2036; the 150th Wimbledon and 100 years since Fred Perry, the last British male winner of the championships, won.\nPoint and prize money distribution.\nPoint distribution.\nBelow are the tables with the point distribution for each discipline of the tournament.\nPrize money.\nThe total prize money for 2011 championships was £14,600,000.

The network issued a statement saying it had been outbid for the rights to future broadcasts. Cable sports channel ESPN, which had already been sharing Wimbledon coverage with NBC, became the exclusive American broadcaster of the tournament for a 12-year period, beginning in 2012.

After the third round on Saturday morning, Stewart Gardner led at 249, with Anderson a stroke behind and Smith one back in third at 251. Garder had an 85 in the afternoon and fell to fourth. Both Anderson and Smith posted total scores of 331, the highest winning score in U.S. Open history, with Smith narrowly missing a putt at the 18th to win the championship in regulation.\nThe playoff, the first in U.S. Open history, was pushed back to Monday because Sunday was reserved for member play. Smith jumped out to a three-stroke lead at the turn and led by five shots with fives holes to play. He went 5-7-5-4 over the next four holes, while Anderson recorded all fours to even up the match. At the 18th, Anderson found the green in two while Smith's approach landed in the rough. Anderson two-putted for his four, while Smith chipped to with a chance to tie, but his putt went astray and failed to find the cup. Anderson finished with an 85, a stroke better than Smith.\nSmith's brother Willie, the 1899 champion, finished in third place, two shots out of the playoff. Myopia club pro John Jones was twelfth, then caddied for Anderson during the playoff.

Willie Anderson won the second of his four U.S. Open titles in a playoff over David Brown. The championship was played on the original course at Baltusrol, now known as the Old Course, which no longer exists.\nAnderson led after each of the first three rounds, with a six-shot lead after 54 holes, but carded 82 in the final round on Saturday afternoon. Brown's 76 equaled them at 307 total, eight strokes clear of the field. The playoff was moved to Monday because Sunday was reserved for member play, and was played in a heavy rainstorm. Anderson took a two-stroke lead at the turn, but Brown managed to tie after 14. At the next hole, Brown made a seven after his tee shot went out of bounds, but Anderson only gained a single stroke after three-putting for a six. At 16, Brown made a six to Anderson's five, and both made fours on the last two holes; Anderson ended at 82, two shots ahead.\nAnderson had won in 1901 and was the first to win the U.S. Open twice; it was the first of three consecutive titles, a feat yet to be repeated. His four U.S. Open wins set a record which has been equaled by three others: Bobby Jones, Ben Hogan, and Jack Nicklaus.\nDonald Ross, who would become known as one of the greatest golf course architects, designing several courses that hosted future U.S. Opens, had his best U.S. Open finish with a 5th place showing. Baseball Hall of Famer John Montgomery Ward played in his first of two U.S. Opens here, finishing in 56th place.\nThe Old Course at Baltusrol hosted the U.S. Open again a dozen years later in 1915, then was plowed under three years later in 1918 by course architect A. W. Tillinghast to create the Upper and Lower Courses.\nRound summaries.\nFirst round.\n\"Friday, June 26, 1903 (morning)\"\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, June 26, 1903 (afternoon)\"\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, June 27, 1903 (morning)\"\nFinal round.\n\"Saturday, June 27, 1903 (afternoon)\"\nAmateurs: Douglas (322), Reinhart (325), Travis (326), Brokaw (333),&lt;br&gt;Croker (348), Carnegie (353), Kellogg (356), Gillespie (357),&lt;br&gt;Tappin (359), Watson (360), Ward (363), McDonald (372).\nPlayoff.\n\"Monday, June 29, 1903\""

Taylor was also in America on business and decided to enter, creating a highly anticipated matchup between the two great British rivals. Together they formed two-thirds of the Great Triumvirate that dominated British golf at the turn of the century (the third, James Braid, never played in the U.S. Open).\nOn Thursday morning, Taylor opened with 76 for a two-shot lead, but an 82 in the afternoon put him one back of Vardon after 36 holes. On Friday morning, Vardon's 76 opened up a four-stroke lead over Taylor, who was seven clear of the field. Despite an 80 in the afternoon for 313, Vardon prevailed by two, as Taylor shot 78 for 315. Local Chicago pro David Bell was a distant third at 322.\nNeither Vardon nor Taylor won another major outside The Open Championship, which they won a combined eleven times. Vardon did not play in the U.S. Open again until 1913, when he and Ted Ray lost a playoff to amateur Francis Ouimet. He was also runner-up in his third and final Open appearance, in 1920.

Amateur Francis Ouimet, age 20, won his only U.S. Open title in an 18-hole playoff, five strokes ahead of Britons Harry Vardon and Ted Ray.\nThe four rounds were played over two days, Thursday and Friday. After 36 holes, Vardon and Wilfrid Reid co-led at 147 (+1), and after the third round on Friday morning, Ouimet, Vardon, and Ray were tied for the lead at 225 (+6).

The Gaels have also been to 7 NITs, in 1982, 1983, 1996, 1997, 2014, 2015 and 2022. In 2011, the Gaels made it to the final game of the CIT post-season tournament, losing at home to Santa Clara. Since the 1978-79 season, the Gaels have won 20 games or more in 23 seasons.\nPostseason.\nNCAA Tournament Results.\nThe Gaels have appeared in 16 NCAA Tournaments. Their combined record is 1–16. Iona's only NCAA Tournament victory to date, which took place in 1980, was vacated by the NCAA due to their star Center, Jeff Ruland, having signed a contract with an agent for professional representation a few months prior. Thus, NCAA record books attribute to them an 0–16 record in NCAA tournament games. The Gaels first five losses in NCAA tournament play were by a combined 11 points, including a heartbreaking buzzer-beater by Syracuse University in 1998.\n+ Indicates Final Four participant.&lt;br&gt;\n!

        "text": "The Georgia State Panthers men's basketball team represents Georgia State University and competes in the Sun Belt Conference of NCAA Division I. The Panthers play at the Georgia State Convocation Center in Atlanta, Georgia, United States.\nFacilities.\nGSU Convocation Center.\nIn 2018, GSU announced that the 8,000-seat Georgia State Convocation Center, hosting the men's and women's basketball teams, was being developed near the recently acquired Turner Field property. Ground was broken the same year, and the facility was completed in time for the 2022–23 season. The facility was officially opened on September 13, 2022 and seats 7,300 for basketball games, 7,500 for commencement ceremonies, and 8,000 for concerts.\nGSU Sports Arena.\nThe Panthers previously played their home games at the GSU Sports Arena, located at 125 Decatur Street in the heart of the Georgia State campus. The facility was originally built in 1972 as a student gym and classroom space for physical education classes. The arena has a capacity of 3,854. The basketball court was named the Charles \"Lefty\" Driesell Court in honor of the former Panthers men's basketball coach. After the 2014–15 season, the center-hanging scoreboard was replaced with a four-sided hanging video scoreboard.\nPlans were released in 2012 to renovate the arena to turn the court 90 degrees, allowing for the court to be completely surrounded by seating with a new capacity of 5,000. These plans have since been abandoned in favor of a brand-new arena adjacent to Georgia State Stadium, which was previously known as Turner Field.\nPractice Facility.\nIn March 2014, work was started on a practice facility for the team as part of an incentive package at the request of head coach Ron Hunter.\nIn April 2016, the facility was completed, slightly under its initial $1 million budget. The facility was built using an unused aquatics facility, with the court being built over the swimming pool after being filled in with concrete and padding. The court is named for Patty Ferrer and Cathy Henson, whose families were the main contributors to the project. The facility is shared between the men's and women's basketball teams, as well as the indoor volleyball team.\nCoaches.\nPrior to hiring Rob Lanier as head coach, the Georgia State Panthers men's basketball team was led by interim coach, Travis Williams. Most recently, Williams served as an assistant coach under Ron Hunter. Before that, Williams led a successful playing career for the Panthers—totaling over 1,000 career points before graduating in 1995. He also formerly led GSU as an assistant coach under Charles \"Lefty\" Driesell.\nBob Reinhart.\nCoach Bob Reinhart led the Georgia State Panthers men's basketball team from 1985 until 1994. His overall record at Georgia State was 107–148. He has the second-most wins in Georgia State history (107), and is first all-time in tenure (9 seasons); his winning percentage (.420) places him fourth all-time.\nWhen Reinhart took the head coaching job at Georgia State, the Panthers had just gone 2–26 the season prior. In his first season, the team finished with 10 wins. In the 1990–91 season, Reinhart's team finished the regular season 13–14 before achieving a series of \"firsts\" for Georgia State in the conference tournament. GSU had never before won a game in the conference tournament, had never beaten Little Rock, and had been swept in the regular season by all three teams they would end up facing. The fifth-seed Panthers went on to beat Stetson, USTA and Little Rock to win their first Trans America Athletic Conference tournament title and earn the school's first NCAA tournament bid.\nReinhart was twice named Coach of the Year by the Atlanta Tip-Off Club. The first award came after the 1990–91 TAAC tournament championship season. He was inducted into the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame in 2017.\nReinhart was fired after the 1993–94 season and was replaced by Carter Wilson, his assistant at GSU and former player and assistant at Decatur High School.\nLefty Driesell.\nCharles \"Lefty\" Driesell became the Panthers' head coach for the 1997–98 season and remained in that position for six years. He won 103 games and lost 59, giving a .636 win percentage. During his time coaching the Panthers, he won the 2000, 2001, and 2002 regular season conference title, the 2001 conference tournament, and advanced to the second round of the 2001 NCAA tournament.\nAfter the 2017–18 season, Driesell was inducted to the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame.\nRod Barnes.\nCoach Rod Barnes, former Southeastern Conference Coach of the Year (2001), coached the Georgia State Panthers men's basketball team from 2007 until 2011. In that time, he managed 44 wins for 79 losses. At the end of the 2010–11 season, athletics director Cheryl Levick fired him with a year remaining on his contract.\nRon Hunter.\nOn March 21, 2011, president Mark P. Becker and director of athletics Cheryl L. Levick announced Ron Hunter as the new head men's basketball coach at Georgia State University. Previously, Hunter spent 17 years as head coach at IUPUI. Known for his affiliation with Samaritan's Feet, a charity that donates shoes to children, Hunter brought with him a tradition of playing one game per season barefoot in an effort to raise awareness to his cause.\nHunter inherited a team mostly put together by his predecessor, a lineup that had only managed 12 wins the previous season. With this team, he finished with a 22–12 record—which was just the ninth winning season the program had achieved since its inception in 1984.\nHis son, R. J. Hunter, remained in Indianapolis to finish his high school career with his mother while Hunter coached in Atlanta. R. J. was actively recruited the elder Hunter to play at Georgia State, where he committed over Virginia Tech, Wake Forest and Iowa. R. J. would eventually go on to become the school's all-time leading scorer while breaking many other offensive records.\nCoach Hunter became the third Georgia State coach to take the Panthers to the NCAA tournament during the 2015 iteration of the event. After beating Georgia Southern in the SBC tournament, Coach Hunter tore his achilles tendon while running to his son R. J. Hunter in celebration, garnering attention from the media before their trip to the NCAA's. Due to his injury, Hunter was forced to coach in the NCAA tournament from a rolling stool. After a dramatic comeback over the third seeded Baylor Bears capped by a deep three-pointer shot by his son, R. J., Coach Hunter fell off his stool in celebration. This resulted in a media firestorm resulting in multiple interviews, features, and a spot in \"One Shining Moment\" at the conclusion of the tournament. The Panthers would be eliminated from the tournament in the next round by Xavier.\nAfter the 2018–2019 season, Ron Hunter had the most wins in Georgia State history (171) and guided GSU to six post-season berths in his eight seasons at the helm. Under Ron Hunter, GSU also won Sun Belt Conference titles in 4 of his last 6 seasons, which included regular season championships in 2014, 2015 and 2019 and tournament championships in 2015, 2018 and 2019. During Hunter's tenure, the program produced the Sun Belt Conference Player of the Year three times: R. J. Hunter (2014, 2015) and D'Marcus Simonds (2018). Some of the most notable victories in Hunter's tenure included VCU, Baylor, Georgia Tech, Georgia and Alabama.\nRob Lanier.\nRob Lanier, former associate head coach of the Tennessee Volunteers, was hired as head coach of the Panthers on April 5, 2019. His previous head coaching experience was with the Siena Saints, where he led the team to one NCAA Tournament appearance in four years, progressing through the First Four in the 2002 edition.\nLanier's first season finished with a 19–13 record, but the Panthers fell to rival Georgia Southern in the quarterfinals of the Sun Belt Conference tournament. The following season, Lanier led the Panthers to a victory over crosstown foe Georgia Tech, 123–120 in quadruple overtime. The game was GSU's first win over an ACC opponent, and saw several program records set, including most points scored in a game. The 2020–21 squad were ultimately crowned Sun Belt regular season champions, and reached the Sun Belt Conference tournament final, where they lost the championship game 80–73 to Appalachian State.\nBringing back a senior-laden veteran roster, Lanier's third team at GSU was the preseason favorite in the Sun Belt Conference. While the regular season league crown went to Texas State, GSU clinched the conference tournament title with a win over Louisiana in the tournament title game, securing an NCAA Tournament automatic bid—the Panthers' fourth in eight years. Drawing a 16 seed in the NCAA Tournament, GSU were running number one overall seed Gonzaga close, trailing 62–58 with 10½ minutes remaining, before eventually falling to a 93–72 defeat. Lanier left to take up the head coaching role at Southern Methodist University after GSU's elimination.\nJonas Hayes.\nOn April 11, 2022, Jonas Hayes was officially introduced as Georgia State's men's basketball head coach. Hayes spent the previous four seasons as an assistant coach at Xavier. On March 16, 2022, Hayes was named interim head coach for Xavier, where he led the program to its first NIT championship in 64 years. Xavier's unexpected run in the NIT included wins over Florida, Vanderbilt, St. Bonaventure and Texas A&amp;M.\nHayes is well known in the Atlanta area, as he and his twin brother Jarvis were standout players at the University of Georgia from 2001 to 2004. Hayes helped lead the Bulldogs to appearances in the 2002 NCAA Tournament and the 2004 NIT.\nPostseason.\nConference tournament championship results.\nThroughout its years in the TAAC/Atlantic Sun, Colonial Athletic Association, and Sun Belt Conference, Georgia State has made it to the conference championship 10 times. Their combined record is 6–4.\nNCAA tournament results.\nGeorgia State has been to the NCAA tournament six times. Their combined record is 2–6.\nNIT results.\nGeorgia State has been to the National Invitation Tournament twice. Their combined record is 0–2.\nCIT results.\nGeorgia State has appeared in two CollegeInsider.com Tournaments. Their combined record is 1–2.\nRivalries.\nGeorgia State vs. Georgia Southern.\nGeorgia State and Georgia Southern have met off and on since 1972 with the only significant break in the series coming between 1996 and 2009. While Georgia Southern leads the all-time series, Georgia State has won more games in the last 10 years. Home court advantage typically plays a major factor in this rivalry as the home team won every game from 1996 until 2019 (did not play between 1996 and 2009). That streak was broken on March 9, 2019 when Georgia State defeated Georgia Southern in Statesboro in a de facto regular season conference championship game by a score of 90–85. Georgia Southern defeated Georgia State 79–70 on February 28, 2020 in Atlanta. This game snapped the home winning streak for Georgia State going back to 1992.\nGeorgia Southern holds a 38–26 series lead over the Panthers, but GSU has won 7 of the past 9 matchups, including three straight. GSU is 2–0 against Georgia Southern in the Sunbelt Conference tournament.\nGeorgia State vs. Louisiana.\nThe Panthers and the Ragin' Cajuns have only met 19 times in the history of their programs, but the game quickly evolved into a heated rivalry shortly after Georgia State re-joined the Sun Belt Conference in 2013. Since 2013, the Panthers and Cajuns have combined for three regular season SBC championships and three SBC tournament championships. Also since that time, GSU and ULL have led the conference in wins, respectively. Ron Hunter was 11–5 against Louisiana Coach, Bob Marlin, during his tenure with the Georgia State program.\nAt the conclusion of the 2021–2022 season, Georgia State holds a 17–7 lead over the Ragin' Cajuns.\nGeorgia State vs. Troy.\nGeorgia State and Troy have met off and on since 1952. They began to play each other regularly while both teams were members of the Atlantic Sun Conference until 2005 when both members left. The two became conference mates again in 2013 when Georgia State joined the Sun Belt Conference.\nUnder Coach Ron Hunter, the rivalry remained a competitive match-up as the Panthers were just 7–8 against the Trojans during that time period. In fact, since Georgia State rejoined the Sun Belt, Troy has proven to be the Achilles' heel for the Panthers as they are the only conference foe they have failed to secure a winning record against.\nOne of the most memorable games of the series came when the Trojans famously upset the Panthers 85–81 on February 15, 2014 in a nationally televised game. This game was notable because it not only ended Georgia State's 14 game winning streak (the longest in school history), but would be the only game to tarnish the Panthers' otherwise perfect conference record during the 2013–14 regular season in which they finished 17–1.\nAnother memorable moment in the rivalry came during the 2017 Sun Belt Conference tournament. At #2, the Panthers were the highest seeded team remaining in the tournament. With #1 seed UT-Arlington taking an early exit, the only teams standing between Georgia State and another berth in the NCAA tournament were #6 seed Troy and #4 Texas State. The Panthers had effectively secured the easiest path to the Championship and would be favored the rest of the way. At half-time, the Panthers held a 37–28 lead and appeared to be on their way to the conference finals. However, Troy ultimately seized the moment from the Panthers as they went on to win 74–63 in yet another shocking upset in the series.\nAt the conclusion of the 2021–22 season, Troy holds a 22–20 edge over the Panthers."

        "text": "The 2001 NBDL Draft was the inaugural draft of the National Basketball Development League (NBDL), which was later renamed the NBA Development League (NBADL). The draft was held on November 1, 2001 before the 2001–02 season. In this draft, the league's eight charter teams took turns selecting players who had all competed at the college level in the United States at some point.\nChris Andersen of Blinn Community College (Brenham, Texas) was the first overall selection and was taken by Fayetteville Patriots. Consequently, this makes him the first-ever selection in the history of the NBADL. The first non-American selected was Gabe Muoneke, a Nigerian who was the fourth overall pick by the Columbus Riverdragons. Eight nations in all were represented in the 2001 NBDL Draft, with the most being the United States (87) followed by Senegal (3). No players selected in this draft have ever been named an NBA D-League All-Star, largely because the annual contest did not come into existence until the 2006–07 season. Two league award winners were taken in this draft, however: Fred House of the North Charleston Lowgators (46th overall) was named the 2001–02 NBDL Rookie of the Year, while Jeff Myers of the Greenville Groove (67th overall) was tabbed the Defensive Player of the Year. Four players were also NBA draft selections: DeeAndre Hulett, Mark Karcher and Jaquay Walls were all picked in the 2000 NBA draft, while Kris Bruton was picked in 1994.\nAlthough some of the players chosen in the 2001 NBDL Draft had played semi-professional and/or professional basketball after college graduation, only the United States colleges they attended are listed.\nDraft.\nAll information summarised in this table comes from the NBA draft announcement except the nationalities."

The head coach for the Cougars was James Dickey, who was serving in his 1st year in that position. The team played its home games at Hofheinz Pavilion on-campus in Houston and are members of Conference USA.\nWith a win over #19 UCF during mid-season play, Houston defeated a nationally ranked opponent at home for the first time since the 2005 season.\nRoster.\nTrumaine Johnson played ten games with Houston during the season, but left the team due to \"personal reasons\" on January 14, 2011.\nIncoming recruits.\nThis season, Houston had five incoming recruits. Freshman Joe Young, who is the son of Phi Slama Jama-era Houston player and former NBA player Michael Young, had originally committed and signed a National Letter of Intent (NLI) to play at Providence, but chose to play for Houston instead. Although Young requested a release from his NLI, Providence head coach Keno Davis denied it. Young then appealed to the National Letter of Intent advisory committee, but the denial was upheld. Due to the rules of the NCAA, Young is being treated as a transfer student, and is required to sit-out for all games this season. However, he will be eligible to play during the 2011–12 season.\nTrumaine Johnson transferred to Houston from San Diego where he played as a guard. Johnson cited racial discrimination against the University of San Diego, and is currently suing the school. Johnson played ten games with Houston until he sustained an ankle injury. Following the injury, he remained with the team for the next four games, but did not play. On January 14, 2011, it was announced that Johnson had left the team for personal reasons.\nHouston had several other recruits, but granted releases to them prior to the beginning of the season. Marial Dhal, a 7' 3\" center from Uganda, originally committed to Houston on May 1, 2010 and signed an NLI, but was granted a release after head coach Tom Penders stepped down from his position. He then committed, and began play for Canisius. In a similar fashion, Devon Lamb, who had verbally committed to Houston on February 15, 2010, chose to play for Lamar also due to a change of staff.\nFabyon Harris of Chicago originally committed on May 10, 2010, and eventually signed an NLI to Houston, but was granted a release for \"personal and family\" reasons on August 16, 2010. He then committed to playing for Howard College in the NJCAA, but was dismissed from the team before the season began following an arrest in which Harris had shoplifted a television from a Wal-Mart retail store in Big Spring, Texas with two other teammates.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=7 style=|Exhibition\n!colspan=7 style=|Regular season\n!colspan=7 style=| Conference USA Tournament"

        "text": "The 1983 Stanley Cup playoffs, the playoff tournament of the National Hockey League (NHL) began on April 5, after the conclusion of the 1982–83 NHL season. The playoffs concluded on May 17 with the champion New York Islanders defeating the Edmonton Oilers 4–0 to win the final series four games to none and win the Stanley Cup for the fourth consecutive season. \nThe 1983 playoffs marked the first time that seven NHL teams based in Canada (Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver, Edmonton, Quebec, Winnipeg, and Calgary) all qualified for the playoffs in the same season. Since the 1967–68 expansion, all the Canadian teams have qualified for the playoffs on five other occasions – 1969 (Montreal and Toronto), 1975, 1976 and 1979 (Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver), and 1986 (the same seven as in 1983), the last time to date (as of 2023) that all active Canadian teams qualified.\nIn the Wales Conference, the Patrick Division champion Philadelphia Flyers were upset by the New York Rangers in the first round. The defending champion Islanders had qualified second in the Patrick Division, and defeated the Washington Capitals in the first round, and defeated the Rangers to qualify for the Conference Final. In the Adams Division, the first-place Boston Bruins defeated the Quebec Nordiques and the Buffalo Sabres (who swept the Canadiens in their opening round series) to advance to the Conference Final. In the Conference Final, the Islanders defeated Boston in six games to qualify for their fourth consecutive Cup Finals appearance.\nIn the Campbell Conference, the Smythe Division first seed Edmonton Oilers swept the Winnipeg Jets in the opening round, and defeated the Calgary Flames (who defeated the Vancouver Canucks three games to one in the opening round) in the Smythe Final. The Norris champion Chicago Black Hawks defeated the St. Louis Blues three games to one and the Minnesota North Stars (who defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs three games to one in the opening round) in the Norris Final four games to one. Edmonton defeated the Norris Division champion Chicago Black Hawks in a four-game sweep in the Conference Final to advance to the Cup Finals.\nPlayoff seeds.\nThe 1983 playoffs followed the format introduced in the previous season. The four teams with the best regular-season records from each of the four divisions would secure playoff berths. The division semi-finals would see the first-place club against the fourth-place team, while the second- and third-place teams faced off. The winning clubs would then meet in the division final. Home-ice advantage for these first two rounds of the playoffs would be granted to the team with the better regular-season record. Division winners would then face one another in the conference finals.\nHome-ice advantage for the conference finals had been determined by coin flips prior to the start of the previous season. That event determined that home-ice advantage were granted to champions of the Adams and Smythe divisions this season. Similarly, a puck flip determined that home-ice advantage for the Stanley Cup finals would be granted to Campbell Conference champion this season.\nThe following teams qualified for the playoffs:\nDivision semifinals.\nPrince of Wales Conference.\n(A1) Boston Bruins vs. (A4) Quebec Nordiques.\nThis was the second playoff series meeting between these two teams. This was a rematch of the previous year's Adams Division Finals, in which Quebec won in seven games.\n(A2) Montreal Canadiens vs. (A3) Buffalo Sabres.\nThis was the third playoff series meeting between these two teams. The teams split their previous two meetings. They last met in the 1975 Stanley Cup Semifinals, in which Buffalo won in six games.\n(P1) Philadelphia Flyers vs. (P4) New York Rangers.\nThis was the fifth playoff series meeting between these two teams. The teams had split their previous four meetings. This was a rematch of last year's Patrick Division Semifinals, in which New York won 3–1.\n(P2) New York Islanders vs. (P3) Washington Capitals.\nThis was the first playoff series meeting between these two teams.\nClarence Campbell Conference.\n(N1) Chicago Black Hawks vs. (N4) St. Louis Blues.\nThis was the fourth playoff series meeting between these two teams. Chicago won all three previous meetings. This was a rematch of last year's Norris Division Finals, in which Chicago won in six games.\n(N2) Minnesota North Stars vs. (N3) Toronto Maple Leafs.\nThis was the second playoff series meeting between these two teams. Minnesota won the only previous meeting in the 1980 preliminary round in a three-game sweep.\n(S1) Edmonton Oilers vs. (S4) Winnipeg Jets.\nThis was the first playoff series meeting between these two teams.\n(S2) Calgary Flames vs. (S3) Vancouver Canucks.\nThis was the second playoff series meeting between these two teams.

        "title": "List of first-class cricket centuries by W. G. Grace",
        "text": "William Gilbert Grace, commonly known as W. G. Grace, is generally considered one of the greatest cricketers of all time. His first-class cricket career spanned 44 seasons, from 1865 until 1908, during which time he claimed over 2,800 wickets and over 800 catches. Despite this, he is best known for his batting ability: possessing a \"high backlift and willingness to play off both front and back foot\", he stood apart from other batsmen of the time. He scored over 50,000 first-class runs, a feat achieved by only six other cricketers, and was the first cricketer to score 100 or more centuries.\nDisputes regarding the first-class status of a number of matches in which W. G. Grace played have resulted in him having varying career statistics published. Of his centuries, 124 were scored in matches universally accepted as being first-class, these are the figures which are published on both Cricinfo and CricketArchive. A number of further matches are considered to be first-class by some sources; in these matches he scored two centuries: for the \"Gentlemen to Canada Touring Team\" against the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1873, and for Gloucestershire against Somerset in 1879. Grace, in his 1899 reminiscences, records both of these centuries among his tally of first-class centuries. In \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\"s first-class records section, he is listed as having scored 126 centuries, the eleventh most hundreds scored during a career. He retains this position with the lower total of 124, also appearing eleventh on Cricinfo's list.\nGrace made his first-class debut in June 1865 appearing for the Gentlemen of the South against the Players of the South at The Oval, but did not score his first century until his tenth match, making an unbeaten 224 for England against Surrey County Cricket Club at the same ground. In 1871, he reached 100 on 10 different occasions, the most during any season of his career. In doing so, he became the first batsman to pass 2,000 first-class runs in a season, tallying 2,739 in total. He scored the first triple century in first-class cricket in 1876, amassing 344 for the Gentlemen of Marylebone Cricket Club against Kent after the Gentlemen had been forced to follow on. Less than two weeks later, Grace passed 300 once more, scoring 318 not out for Gloucestershire against Yorkshire. He scored 177 in his only innings between the two triple-centuries, and scored 839 runs in eight days.\nHe scored his 100th century in 1895; at the time this was reckoned to be made in the county match between Gloucestershire and Somerset. Somerset's captain, Sammy Woods recollects the moment in his reminiscences:\nDuring May we had a weird game at Bristol \"v\". Gloucester. We scored 200 for 1 wicket. W. G. then went on and took 5 wickets, and we were all out for 300. He then proceeded to go in first and help himself to 288, and to get his hundredth century. I had the satisfaction of giving him a full pitch to get to his hundred, not that he wanted any help.\nGrace comments in his memoirs that he was glad to make his hundredth century at Gloucestershire's ground. Excluding the two centuries not considered first-class by some modern statisticians, Grace's hundredth century came later in the same month when he scored 169 for Gloucestershire against Middlesex at Lord's. He scored his final first-class century in July 1904 for London County, reaching 166 against the Marylebone Cricket Club. He played first-class cricket for another four seasons, and scored 15 and 25 for the Gentlemen of England in his final outing, an innings defeat against Surrey."

        "text": "Murray Henderson (born 13 August 1959 in Wellington) is a rugby union coach and former player from New Zealand.\nHe played club rugby at the provincial level and represented his country though not at Test level.\nAfter his retirement as player he became a professional coach; he trained club, university and national sides.\nEarly career.\nHenderson joined the New Zealand Army cadets in 1976. A series of promotions led to his appointment as Head Cadet and Regimental Sergeant Major. Following the completion of the two-year programme, he joined the Regular Forces Engineer Corps and completed a carpentry apprenticeship. His career in the Army spanned 20 years during which time he worked on commercial construction projects, field engineering including demolitions and civilian aid projects in the South Pacific. His ability to teach was recognised, with forays into physical education as an Assistant Physical Training Instructor and into teaching, as an instructor at the School of Military Engineering. His people skills and range of experiences within the army led him into Army Recruiting, ultimately being based at the National Office overseeing regional recruiting. During his time in the Army, Henderson played both NZ Army and NZ Combined Services Rugby.\nHenderson retired from the Army following 20 years' service and qualified as a Les Mills Personal Trainer prior to setting up a sports consulting company. The key focus for this company was personal training, rugby team fitness and team building for both NZ and overseas teams. The focus broadened to include corporate team building/development. Henderson moved into professional rugby coaching in 2002.\nPlaying career.\nHenderson played for three New Zealand Provincial Rugby unions, captaining two of the teams.\nIn 1984, he debuted for Manawatu at flanker (No.7) and the following year became the side's outstanding player. Injuries hampered his 1986 season but the following year he was made captain until he was surprisingly dropped from both the leadership and the team late in the season. He played 37 games for Manawatu before transferring with the Army to Christchurch.\nHe played 16 games for Canterbury (1988/89) at flanker playing alongside Robbie Deans, Andy Earl and Wayne Smith.\nA third transfer in 1992 took him to Nelson where he captained 3rd division Nelson Bays. In his first year with the side, Henderson led the team through a record unbeaten season to win the 3rd Division National Provincial Championship (NPC) and promotion to the second division. It also earned him the Supporters' Club Player of the Season award.\nHenderson also captained both the New Zealand Army rugby team and the NZ Combined Services team, touring the UK twice with the NZ Combined Services and returning home undefeated.\nIn 1986, Brian Lachore's panel selected Henderson for an All Black trial but a knee injury robbed him of the opportunity and he underwent surgery a month before the trial.\nAs a rugby sevens players, Henderson represented Manawatu (1983–87) and Canterbury (1988–89) with Canterbury coming second in the National Finals under Wayne Smith.\nCoaching career.\nHenderson, as Head Coach, was involved in Canterbury age grade rugby in a coaching partnership with backs coach and former Canterbury fly half Greg Coffey. In 1999, in partnership with former All Black Craig Green, Henderson coached the Canterbury Crusaders U21 side to victory in the inaugural Super 12 U21 competition. He reconnected with Greg Coffey in 2000 to draw the competition and to finish second the following year.\nHenderson left New Zealand in 2001 to commence his professional coaching career with Sanyo Rugby in Japan and was instrumental in founding a feeder relationship between Sanyo and top rugby University Kanto Gakuin (KGU), as well as facilitating a commercial alliance between Sanyo and the Canterbury Rugby Union. Henderson was with Sanyo as Head Coach for 3 years, moving to KGU and Kurita for a further year before returning to New Zealand at the end of 2005.\nIn 2006, Henderson was Head Coach for Tasman Makos B team while at the same time operating as Technical Coach and video analyst for the Tasman A team.\nHowever, the northern hemisphere called and he headed to Coventry Rugby Club in January 2007, helping them to avoid relegation, before contracting as Head Coach the following season.\nIn 2008, Henderson accepted the role of Specialist Forward coach for the Portugal National Rugby Federation. At the completion of that 2-year contract he left Portugal to take up the Head Coach position with the Oxford University Blues in September 2010 and also consults for the RFU to deliver specialist coaching seminars to coaches and teams within the UK. Henderson's last stint overseas was in Japan again, where he coached Honda Rugby Football club for three seasons.\nNotable family members.\nMurray Henderson comes from a competitive sporting family. His uncle Wally Coe was a New Zealand Welterweight boxer who won a gold medal at the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games.\nGreat uncle Dick Dunn was also a keen sportsman who played 52 consecutive seasons of senior cricket and rose to coach the New Zealand women's cricket team. Boxing was also a passion and Dunn established boxing gyms training children off the street as well as notable champions such as Commonwealth gold medallists Wally Coe and Frank Creagh.\nDaughter Cassie Henderson placed fifth in the first series of The X Factor New Zealand."

He is best known for coaching the East St. Louis Flyers to six Illinois and two national championships.\nEarly life.\nRobert Lavern Shannon was born 1945 in Port Gibson, Mississippi.\nCareer.\nShannon achieved a record of 192-34 in 20 seasons at East St. Louis. In 1985 he was selected as the USA Today High School Football Coach of the Year along with taking the High School Football National Championship. Shannon accused the school district of condoning corruption. He claimed the athletic director stole from the district. He left in 1995 after the school board backed the athletic director, who later pleaded guilty to stealing $90,000 from athletic accounts. Janet Reno awarded Shannon the United States Attorney General Award, an award rarely given outside of law enforcement, for his efforts to fight corruption. He coached Alton and Christian Brothers College High School before retiring from coaching in 2007 at the age of 63.\nShannon and the East St. Louis Flyers were the subject of the book \"The Right Kind of Heroes\", by newspaper reporter Kevin Horrigan, who is now a columnist with the \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\". The book chronicles the Flyers' 1990 and 1991 seasons, during which they lost the state championship and then won it back. Shannon coached pro football players Dana Howard and Bryan Cox and baseball player Homer Bush, then a high school football star during his tenure at East St. Louis. Two years after retiring, Shannon was inducted into the St. Louis Metro Football Coaches Association hall of fame.\nGeorge H. W. Bush recognized Shannon as \"a beacon of hope in a sea of despair.\" Bill Clinton named Shannon one of his 53 faces of hope during his 1992 presidential campaign. Shannon was selected for overcoming difficulties and leading his team to success. He was invited to lunch prior to the inauguration with Clinton and attended the inauguration."

        "text": "The Fitzroy Baseball Club, known as the Fitzroy Lions, is a baseball club founded in 1889 to represent the inner Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy, Victoria. The club was a founding member of the Victorian Baseball League, Victoria's first organised baseball competition. Fitzroy has won 16 Division 1 championships and currently has seven senior men's teams, one women's team and a masters team competing in the Baseball Victoria Summer League, as well as junior sides representing the club at every age level.\nEarly history.\nThe Fitzroy Baseball Club was founded by the Fitzroy Cricket Club in 1889, the cricket club also founded the Fitzroy Football Club, Tennis Club and Bowls Club. The first intimation to form a baseball club was received by the committee from Mr E. Glass on 20 May 1889, and it was resolved at the next committee meeting to form a team in connection with the club.\nFitzroy was a foundation member of the Victorian Baseball League which was formed under the guidance of Harry Simpson in March 1889. The other foundation teams were; Victoria, MCC, Fitzroy, Richmond, Richmond Cricket Club, Ferguson, Mitchell, The Age, St Kilda, Malvern, Carlton, South Melbourne, East Melbourne, Metropolitans, Essendon and Blackburn.\nSeveral notable cricketers played for Fitzroy early in the club's history including cricketer Bill Ponsford who played for Fitzroy from 1913 to 1934 and the Harvey brothers (Neil Harvey, Merv Harvey, Mick Harvey, Ray Harvey, Harold Harvey and Brian Harvey) who played from the 1930s to the 1960s.\nRecent history.\n2009/10: Division 2 club champions.\nFitzroy Baseball Club had a fantastic season winning the Baseball Victoria's Division 2 Club Championship Award and gaining promotion to division 1. The club championship reflected the club's depth throughout all grades, after the home and away season the 1sts finished second, the 2nds finished on top of the ladder, the 3rds went undefeated throughout the season, the 4ths finished second and the 5ths finished fifth; resulting in three premierships. The award was a fitting tribute to the 120 year anniversary of the club.\n2015/16: Division 2 runners up and promotion to division 1.\nFitzroy were runners up in the division 2 grand final to Moorabbin Baseball Club earning promotion to division 1 for the 2016/17 season. Taylor Eichhorst won the Division 2 home run championship and John Peterson was honoured as the Baseball Victoria Coach of the Year for his work coaching the lions back into division 1.\n2016/17: Division 1 club champions.\nIn the club's first year back in division 1 it won the club championship and made the first division 1 finals appearance for the firsts since 1961. Following the Christmas break Fitzroy's firsts strung together ten consecutive victories to surge into playoff contention, bowing out in the conference playoff against Essendon. Josh Tols starred on the mound with a 0.20 ERA winning the league's best pitcher award and new club coach Tom Dicker was a standout with the bat, finishing with a 0.421 batting average (the 3rd best in the league ) and a 0.513 OBA. Four Fitzroy players were also recognised in the league allstar team Alex Turlea, Josh Tols, Tom Dicker and Zach Rhodes \nIn a great year for the club the 1sts, 2nds, 4ths and 5ths all made it into the playoffs helping to secure the club championship, with the 2nds winning the grand final 6-4 against Waverley making it back to back premierships for the team.\nNotable players.\nBill Ponsford.\nWilliam Harold \"Bill\" Ponsford MBE (19 October 1900 – 6 April 1991) started his baseball career at Alfred Crescent School (now Fitzroy North Primary School), where his coach was the former Victorian player Charles Landsdown. As a junior Ponsford played shortstop, later as a senior for the Fitzroy Baseball Club he converted to catching. Ponsford was a key member of the all conquering 1920's Fitzroy Maroons, captaining the club to its historic 1925 premiership, the Club's fifth consecutive Division 1 premiership.\nPonsford improved rapidly and by 1913 he was included in the Victorian schoolboys side for a tournament in Adelaide. He was again selected in the following year—now as a catcher—representing his state at the first national schoolboys championship in Sydney. The tournament coincided with a visit to Australia by two professional major league teams from the United States—the Chicago White Sox and the New York Giants. The manager of the Giants, John \"Mugsy\" McGraw, watched part of the tournament; the Ponsford family claim that McGraw was so impressed with Ponsford's skills that he later spoke to Ponsford's parents about the possibility of Bill playing in the United States.\nIn 1919, Ponsford was selected for Victoria's baseball team, alongside future Test cricket teammate Jack Ryder. In 1923, \"The Sporting Globe\" claimed that Ponsford was \"... the best batter of the season. ... Indeed, as an all-round man, it is doubtful if he has a superior in the state.\" In 1925, Ponsford captained the Victorian team and was selected as centre fielder in an Australian representative team that played three matches against an outfit from the United States Pacific Fleet, which had docked in Melbourne. Over the three matches, won by the Australians, Ponsford had five safe hits and his batting average was .357. Ponsford's next match against American opposition was against a team from Stanford University that visited Australia in 1927. Ponsford's Victorian team defeated Stanford 5–3; it was the visitors' only loss on the tour.\nPonsford simultaneously retired from baseball and cricket in 1934. In his newspaper column, he said that he liked both sports equally. He felt that baseball gave a player more opportunities to perform: \"In cricket you may have the bad luck to get out early; which often means a blank afternoon. It is not so with baseball; you are in the game all the time.\" Joe Clark, the author of \"History of Australian Baseball\", said \"Ponsford is considered by many to be the best baseballer of his time in Australia.\" The official program for the 1952 Claxton Shield—held in Perth—made a similar claim.\nGraeme Deany.\nGraeme started playing cricket at Fitzroy Cricket Club as a 13-year-old in 1949.  At the cricket club Ray Harvey noticed his athletic ability, throwing and fielding and invited Graeme to join the Fitzroy Baseball Club where he started as a 16-year-old in the seconds in 1953 (there were no junior teams at the time). Graeme started playing baseball at left field and for 2 seasons at Fitzroy played alongside Neil Harvey at center field and his younger brother Ian Deany at right field. After those first two seasons he moved into the infield playing shortstop and 3rd base for the rest of his career at the top level of baseball.\nGraeme played baseball for Fitzroy from 1953 to 1962 and then 1964 to 1965. After one season of baseball he was selected on the bench for the club's 1954 A-grade Grand final victory against St Kilda 6-4 at the Junction Oval. In 1963 he moved to Footscray as captain / coach and then returned to Fitzroy to captain / coach in 1964 and 1965. Finally in 1966 he moved to Ivanhoe and coached them to a C grade premiership.\nGraeme was a member of the Victorian Claxton Shield Team for 11 consecutive years (from 1956 to 1966), winning the Claxton Shield 4 times playing at SS and 3rd Base and playing in 72 of 74 possible games. He was selected in the Australian team 9 times and 7 years in a row from 1957 to 1963, an Australian record at the time. He won the Helms award in 1965 for the best player of the Australian championships, the first Victorian to win the Helms award.\nHelms Award winners.\nThe 'Helms' award is arguably Australian baseball's most prestigious individual award. Since 1962 the 'Helms' award has been awarded each year to the most outstanding player of the Claxton Shield competition (Australian baseball's annual national tournament). The following Fitzroy Baseball club players have won the award:\nInternational / national representatives.\nMelbourne Aces.\nFitzroy has had several clubmen represent the Melbourne Aces playing professional baseball in the Australian Baseball League, including:\nLegends &amp; life members.\nLife members.\nSource:\nHome ground at Merri Park.\nIn 1883, Charles McCarthy, an Irish-born doctor, opened a Melbourne Retreat for the Cure of Inebriates on 32 acres on St. Georges Rd that is now largely occupied by Northcote High School and Merri Park.\nIn the early 1900s the growing Fitzroy Cricket Club (the original parent club of the Fitzroy Baseball Club) was in need of an additional field for its teams to play on. To develop a solution the club arranged a meeting on 17 August 1909 between the Mayor of Northcote, the Mayor of Fitzroy, Councillors from both cities, the committee of the Fitzroy Cricket Club and the Minister for Lands Mr McKenzie. The Cricket Club urged that the 10 acres of the Crown land known as the Inebriates' Retreat, at Northcote, be sold to the Club for recreation purposes at a nominal price. The Minister promised to take the matter to the Cabinet and the outcome was the following letter :\nThe ground was used by the Club as an adjunct ground from 1910 with the club undertaking a number of improvements together with the Northcote Council. In 1912 with the help of the Fitzroy Council the cricket club filled in the unused watercourse that crossed the park with 4,000 square yards of filling.\nIn 1914 considerable improvements were made by the Cricket Club with the pavilion re-erected and caretakers quarters added as well as a 4 ft 3in picket fence being erected along the length of the western and southern boundaries of the field to prevent cricket balls going into the Merri Creek so often. The improvements made by the club up to 1914 totalled £750, including the filling of the storm water channel.\nIn 1915 the club continued to make improvements in order to fulfil the terms of the land grant, the pavilion was re-painted, the water supply was laid to the park and the showers connected proving a great convenience to players.\nIn 1927 Merri Park was made into a permanent reserve after the Minister of Lands allowed the Education Department to use part of the reserve for Northcote High School.\nDuring the 2011–12 summer season Merri Park was resurfaced and underwent a warm weather turf conversion to protect it from the drought conditions which had seen it become a dust bowl in previous years. Fitzroy relocated for the majority of the season to Elder St Reserve, Greensborough Baseball Club's winter ground.\nClub song.\nTo the tune of \"La Marseillaise\""

        "text": "Apollo Projects Stadium is a sports stadium in Christchurch, New Zealand. It was formerly called Orangetheory Stadium, AMI Stadium, and before that, the Addington Showgrounds.\nHistory.\nThe park is part of a complex with Wolfbrook Arena and Addington Raceway and has hosted international rugby league matches since the 1950s, including World Cup matches in 1975, 1977, 1988, 1990 and 1991.\nThe ground was bought by Canterbury Rugby League from the Christchurch City Council in the 1990s.\nIt was at this ground that the Kiwis won the 1988 Great Britain Lions tour's sole test in New Zealand to qualify for the 1985–1988 Rugby League World Cup final.\nApollo Projects Stadium.\nRugby League Park sustained significant damage during the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake and was closed until 24 March 2012. After the earthquake the stands had to be demolished.\nThe 2011 earthquake damaged AMI Stadium at Lancaster Park, the main sporting ground in Christchurch, beyond repair. As a temporary replacement for the city, Rugby League Park was upgraded and renamed AMI Stadium to seat 18,000 by March 2012 with a possible expansion to 26,000 for major games. As a result, the Crusaders are based there indefinitely, and the stadium has also hosted All Blacks test matches as well as a Wellington Phoenix pre-season match in September 2012.\nOn 9 November 2013 it held a round 5 A-League match between Wellington Phoenix and Perth Glory in which the teams drew 1-1. On 14 May 2016, the ground played host to an NRL match between the Penrith Panthers and the New Zealand Warriors with the former being the home team. Another NRL game took place on 9 June 2018 with the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles replacing Penrith as the home team against the Warriors. The Sea Eagles played another game at the stadium in 2019 but decided to not play in Christchurch in the 2020 season.\nOn 6 July 2018, the stadium was officially renamed to the Wyatt Crockett Stadium, becoming de-branded from AMI Stadium. This was to commemorate the Crusaders player Wyatt Crockett reaching the milestone of playing 200 Super Rugby matches.\nOn 6 April 2019, it was announced that the stadium would soon be known as Orangetheory Stadium. The new name went into effect in June 2019.\nIn June 2023 it was announced that in August 2023 the stadium would be renamed to Apollo Projects Stadium, sponsored by Apollo Projects, a design and construction company.\nIn 2023, the New Zealand Warriors announced a three year deal to play one home game a year in Christchurch from the 2024 NRL season onwards with Rugby League Park hosting the matches in 2024 and 2025 before Te Kaha opens its doors in 2026. The Warriors defeated the Canberra Raiders 18-10 in the first of the fixtures on 22 March 2024.\nInternational rugby league matches.\nA list of rugby league test matches played at the Addington Showgrounds / Rugby League Park."

        "title": "Turn (dance and gymnastics)",
        "text": "In dance and gymnastics, a turn is a rotation of the body about the vertical axis. It is usually a complete rotation of the body, although quarter (90°) and half (180°) turns are possible for some types of turns. Multiple, consecutive turns are typically named according to the number of 360° rotations (e.g., \"double\" or \"triple\" turn).\nThere are many types of turns, which are differentiated by a number of factors. The performer may be supported by one or both legs or be airborne during a turn. When supported by one leg, that leg is known as the \"supporting\" leg and the other as the \"free\", \"raised\", or \"working\" leg. During airborne turns, the first leg to leave the floor is the \"leading\" leg. Trunk, arm and head positions can vary, and in turns with one supporting leg, the free leg may be straight or bent. Turns can begin in various ways as well. For example, ballet turns may begin by rising to \"relevé\" (supported on the ball of the foot) or by stepping directly onto relevé.\nSome turns can be executed in either of two directions. In ballet, a turn in the direction of the raised leg is said to be \"en dehors\" whereas a turn in the opposite direction is \"en dedans\". In ballroom dancing, a \"natural turn\" is a clockwise revolution of dance partners around each other, and its mirrored counterpart is the counter-clockwise \"reverse turn\".\nIn some dance genres and dance notation systems (e.g., Labanotation), a turn in which the performer rotates without traveling is known as a pivot. Pivots may be performed on one or on both feet; the latter is sometimes called a \"twist turn\".\nTechnique.\nSpotting is a technique that is often used when executing turns, in which a performer executes a periodic, rapid rotation of the head that serves to fix the performer's gaze on a single spot, thus giving the impression that the head is always facing forward. Spotting prevents dizziness by allowing the head to remain stable during most of the turn. This helps the performer maintain balance and, when executing traveling turns such as tours chaînés and piques, it helps the performer control the direction of travel.\nTypes of turns.\nAttitude.\nAn attitude turn is performed with the working leg held in attitude position. In ballet, the performer may be assisted by a partner so that the turn can be performed slowly.\nAxel.\nAn axel is a turn in which the performer leaps into the air and, while airborne, tucks both legs underneath and rotates. It is usually executed while traveling across the floor. It is commonly performed in jazz dance and is often immediately preceded by a chaînés in a deep plié (bend of the knees).\nBarrel roll.\nA barrel roll turn, or simply \"barrel roll\", is a turn that involves casting the arms up and leaping into the air and rotating 360 degrees while airborne. While airborne, the performer's back may be arched and the head may be cast back. It starts and ends with the performer facing forward. Barrel roll turns are commonly used in tap, jazz, and contemporary dance. \nChaînés.\nChaînés (French, meaning \"chain\") is a type of two-step turn that is executed repeatedly while the performer travels along a line or curved (often circular or elliptical) path. It is performed quickly on alternating feet and results in a complete rotation for every two steps taken. It is commonly used in ballet, modern, and ballroom dancing.\nIn the first half-turn, one foot is stepped out to the dancer's side in the direction of travel and placed in releve or en pointe; the dancer then rotates 180° on the placed foot while lifting the other foot so that it crosses over the placed foot. As this happens, the arms are brought together away from the chest and spotting technique is employed so that the dancer's head faces the direction of travel as much as possible. The second half-turn is executed with the feet together. Upon completion of the second half-turn, the first foot is stepped out again to begin another turn.\nIn ballet, chaînés turns are usually performed at a very fast tempo, with each turn lasting one half or one quarter of a music beat. They can be performed outwards (en dehors), or inwards (en dedans).\nFouetté.\nA fouetté turn (or \"fouetté en tournant\") begins with the performer standing on one flat foot in plié (with knee bent). The working leg is extended and whipped around (\"fouetté\" is French for \"whipped\") to the side and then, once extended to maximum turnout, bent and pulled in to a passe or retiré position. The foot beats behind the knee and then to the front of the knee of the supporting leg before extending back out to the front. At the same time, the supporting foot transitions to relevé (heel raised), in ballet often rising to en pointe (on toe tips). These movements create the angular momentum needed for one turn, which is executed by rotating in place on the supporting foot.\nIn classical ballet, particular significance is attached to the successful completion of 32 consecutive fouettés, a feat first performed publicly by Italian ballerina Pierina Legnani in 1893 and since incorporated into the grand pas of \"Swan Lake\" and other 20th-century ballets. Jeanne Devereaux, an American prima ballerina in the first half of the 20th century, held the world record of 16 triple fouettés (48 total).\nIllusion.\nAn illusion turn (or simply \"illusion\") is performed by keeping the working leg aligned with the torso while, simultaneously, a 360 degree spin is executed while the torso pivots down and then back up at the hip. An illusion can be performed by turning toward or away from the working leg; the latter is known as a \"reverse illusion\". Illusions are commonly performed in jazz dance and rhythmic gymnastics.\nPiqué.\nA piqué turn is begun by stepping directly onto the ball of a relevé (or en pointe) foot, followed by a complete rotation while supported by the relevé (or en pointe) foot before returning to plié position. The working leg is often held in retiré position, but may be held in a variety of other positions, either with or without turnout.\nPirouette.\nA pirouette (literally \"whirl\" or \"spin\") is a type of dance turn on one foot. It is performed with turnout (legs rotated outward at hips) in ballet, and typically without turnout in gymnastics and many other genres of dance, such as jazz and modern. It is often executed by starting with one or both legs in plié (knees bent) and then rising onto demi pointe (heels raised) as the turn commences, or in the case of ballet dancers, en pointe (on toe tips). Pirouettes may be executed singly or in multiple rotations; the latter is commonly performed in the adagio part of a grand pas de deux.\nThere are many variations of pirouettes. A pirouette can be executed beginning from fifth or fourth position in ballet, whereas artistic gymnasts usually start from fourth position. In ballet, the working leg can be held in retiré position or in attitude, arabesque, or second position. The performer may return to the starting position, finish in arabesque or attitude, or proceed otherwise. A pirouette is most often performed en dehors but can also be performed en dedans."

A total of 669 athletes representing 28 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated at the Games in twenty two events across eight disciplines.\nThe Olympic programme was adjusted from that of the 1936 Winter Olympics with the addition of skeleton for men. The sport had first appeared at the 1928 Winter Olympics, which had also taken place in St. Moritz, but would not make another appearance until 2002 in Salt Lake City. Two demonstration sports were held in St. Moritz, winter pentathlon and military patrol. This was the fourth time military patrol had been held as a demonstration event, the closely related sport of biathlon was added to the programme beginning with the 1960 Squaw Valley Olympics. Both men and women competed in the 1948 Games, with women taking part in alpine skiing and figure skating.\nA total of 123 athletes won medals at the 1948 Games. Norway, Sweden and Switzerland tied for the most number of medals, with ten each. The United States placed fourth in the medal count, with nine, and Austria placed fifth, with eight. Of the 28 competing NOCs, 13 won at least one medal, with 10 of these winning at least one gold. Notable absences from these Games were defeated Axis Powers members Germany and Japan, who were not invited to St. Moritz or the London Summer Olympics later in the year in light of the recently concluded World War II. The Soviet Union, who did not form an NOC until 1951, declined to take part.\nSweden repeated its success in cross-country skiing, winning all three medals in the Men's 18 km event and all three gold medals available in the sport. Canadian teenager Barbara-Ann Scott became the first from her nation to win an Olympic gold medal in figure skating, and Dick Button from the United States did the same. Alpine skier Henri Oreiller from France won the most medals with a total of three, with two gold medals from the downhill and combined events, and a bronze in the slalom event.\nMultiple medallists.\nAthletes who won more than one medal are listed below."

They hosted the Alpine World Ski Championships both in 1933 and 1936. In 1933, Innsbruck served as host to the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships.\nInnsbruck hosted its first Bobsleigh World Championships in 1935 in the two-man event, then hosted again in 1963 when the bobsleigh part of the track was used as a test event for the 1964 Games. Luge was also completed at the same time though Kazimierz Kay-Skrzypeski of Great Britain was killed in a practice run on the luge part of the track two weeks before the start of the 1964 Games. Igls also served as host of the European Luge Championships in 1951 though the track used was not constructed until 1963.\nSince 1952-3 ski jumping season, Bergiselschanze has been part of the Four Hills Tournament.\nSeefeld hosted the Biathlon World Championships in 1963 which also served as a test event for the 1964 Games.\nDuring the Olympics.\nThe ski jumping events were the only one in Winter Olympic history to use the best two out of three jumps for medals. This saved Finland's Veikko Kankkonen in the normal hill event after he followed a disastrous first jump with the longest second and the second-longest third jumps.\nAfter the Olympics.\nBergiselschanze continued to play host as one of the hills for the Four Hills Tournament.\nInnsbruck would host the Winter Olympics twelve years later following the withdrawal of Denver, Colorado in the United States for those games in late 1972. All eight venues from the 1964 Games were used for the 1976 Games with some improvements. The bobsleigh and luge tracks were demolished and converted into an artificially refrigerated combination track, the first of its kind in the world. Ski jumps at Bergsiel and Seefeld both had improving judging stations. Two new artificial ice rinks were built, one for figure skating and the other for ice hockey. Eischnellaufen had new refrigeration done on its 400 m lap circuit."

        "title": "Czech handball",
        "text": "Czech handball (Czech: \"česká házená\", also known as \"národní házená\" – \"national handball\") is an outdoor ball game which was created in 1905 in Prague and is still played today. This sport is very similar to team handball.\nHistory.\nCzech handball is first mentioned by Václav Karas, a teacher a Prague, in a sports journal in Brno in 1905. The rules were soon further developed by other teachers, notably Klenka and Kristof. Thanks to Kristof, the first Czech handball association was established (in Prague) and the rules were made public in 1908.\nStudents from Russia and Yugoslavia, who had become acquainted with Czech handball in Prague, brought this sport back to their own countries. In Yugoslavia, the sport expanded fast and became very popular, particularly among women, who were the first to introduce the game into the country. Czech teachers taught Czech handball in Russian middle schools and there was a competition with 14 teams in Charkov in 1915, but efforts to expand the sport ended after the October Revolution.\nIn 1921, the \"Czechoslovakian Association of Handball and Women's Sports\" became a member of the \"International Women's Sports Federation\". In this federation, the rules of Czech handball were made official (in those times, there was also one similar sport, Field handball in Germany. Some international federations preferred Czech handball, others preferred Field handball). The first international matches were played.\nThe first women's Czech handball world cup was organised in 1930. Czechoslovaks won this competition, Yugoslavia came in second, and Poland was third.\nThe second World Cup was held in London in 1934, but only two teams participated: Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia. Yugoslavians won the match 6-4 and became the champions. This was the first time that Czech handball was played in England. After this event, the IWSF was abolished.\nIn 1935, there was a training camp for English teachers in Scarborough. 50 female and 20 male players practised the “game of hazena”, the first ever English players. Further training was planned in London. \"The netball and other ball sports' association\" organised the printing and publishing of the rules of Czech handball. The Civil Service Club in London was the first Czech handball club in Britain.\nCzech handball became very popular during the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in World War II. The sport was originally Czech, so most people understood its play as a show of patriotism. In early 1940s, there were 25,884 players in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia.\nIn 1947, the International Handball Federation promoted the expansion of the related sport of team handball, but no further foreign countries would adopt Czech handball.\nIn 1954, there were 26,125 registered players in 447 clubs, the largest number of registered player to date.\nSince 1941, a men's and women's 1st league have been competing. There is also the men's 2nd league and regional championships.\nRules.\nThe rules are quite similar to those of team handball, but there are also some major differences:"

        "title": "Washington Open (tennis)",
        "text": "The Washington Open (branded as the Mubadala Citi DC Open for sponsorship reasons and sometimes called the DC Open) is an annual professional outdoor hardcourt tennis tournament played at the William H.G. FitzGerald Tennis Center in Rock Creek Park in Washington, D.C. The event is categorized as an ATP 500 event on the ATP Tour and a WTA 500 event on the WTA Tour. The tournament is owned and managed by Mark Ein in partnership with IMG.\nOrganized annually in the summer schedule of events on North American hardcourts leading up to the US Open, known as the US Open Series, the Washington Open was first held in 1969 as the Washington Star International. It was held on clay courts until 1986, when the surface was changed to hardcourts. In 2011, the event expanded to include its first women's tournament, a WTA International (now WTA 250) competition held in a separate venue in College Park, Maryland. The following year, the men's and women's events were consolidated at the Washington venue. \nIn 2023, the WTA 500-level Silicon Valley Classic was discontinued and merged into the Washington Open, forming the first and only joint-500-level event on the ATP and WTA tours.\nHistory.\nThe tournament was first held on the men's tour in 1969, known as the Washington Star International from 1969 to 1981, the Sovran Bank Classic from 1982 to 1992, the Newsweek Tennis Classic in 1993, the Legg Mason Tennis Classic from 1994 to 2011, and the Citi Open from 2012 to 2022. Competition was held on outdoor clay courts until 1986 when it switched to the current hard courts. A co-founder was Donald Dell, founder of ProServ International, who has since remained closely involved. The location of the event in Washington, D.C., was chosen at the urging of Arthur Ashe, an early supporter.\nThe women's event was first held in 2011 in College Park, Maryland, as the Citi Open, and for the 2012 season, the ATP and WTA decided to merge their Maryland and Washington spots into a joint tournament, with the women's event moving to the William H.G. FitzGerald Tennis Center, and Citi replacing Legg Mason as title sponsor of the joint event.\nIn 2015, the Washington Open dropped out of the US Open Series because of disagreements with ESPN, which that year took over broadcast rights to the US Open and US Open Series events. ESPN would not commit to air more than four hours of the tournament on its ESPN2 network; the remainer would be relegated to ESPN3 online streaming. (In 2014, coverage was split between ESPN and Tennis Channel.) Donald Dell criticized ESPN for using ESPN3 to acquire sports rights without any intent to broadcast them on television: \"If you're running a tournament, and it's $2 million, and sponsorship money in the $6 million-to-$8 million range, you've got sponsors that don't want to be having only four or six hours on television.\" Citi Open organizers withdrew from the US Open Series so it could establish a new broadcast rights agreement with Tennis Channel. The four-year, $2.1 million deal included funding for additional amenities and 171 hours of television coverage.\nIn 2019, the Washington Open was acquired by venture capitalist and USTA board member Mark Ein. It returned to the US Open Series, and also signed a five-year extension of its media rights with Tennis Channel. The 2020 tournament was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The men's event returned for 2021, but the women's event remained cancelled; the WTA did not reinstate its sanctioning of the tournament due to conflicts with the 2020 Summer Olympics. The tournament instead organized a women's invitational, featuring Coco Gauff, Jessica Pegula, and Jennifer Brady.\nIn June 2023, Ein and IMG announced that the Washington Open would merge with the Silicon Valley Classic to form a single tournament in Washington, D.C.; this therefore promoted the Washington Open from a WTA 250 event to a WTA 500 event. Players had usually been divided between the two tournaments, as the Silicon Valley Classic was more prestigious, but the Washington Open was located closer to the rest of the US Open Series events. As a result of the merger, the Silicon Valley Classic's title sponsor Mubadala Investment Company became a co-title sponsor of the event, and the tournament was renamed the Mubadala Citi DC Open. The tournament is the first-ever joint 500-level event on the ATP and WTA tours.\nPast finals.\nIn the men's singles, Andre Agassi (1990–91, 1995, 1998–99) holds the records for most titles (five) and most finals overall (six, runner-up in 2000). He also shares with Michael Chang (1996–97), Juan Martín del Potro (2008–09) and Alexander Zverev (2017–18) the record for most consecutive titles, with two. In the women's singles, Magdaléna Rybáriková (2012–13) holds the record for most titles (two) and co-holds the record for most finals (two) with Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova (runner-up in 2012, 2015). In the men's doubles, Marty Riessen (1971–72, 1974, 1979) and the Bryan brothers (2005–07, 2015) hold the record for most titles (four), with the Bryans also holding the record for most consecutive titles (three). The Bryans co-hold the record for most finals (six, runners-up in 2001–02) with Raúl Ramírez (winner in 1976, 1981–82, runner-up in 1975, 1978–79). In the women's doubles, Shuko Aoyama (2012–14) holds alone the record for most titles, most consecutive titles and most finals (three).\nExternal links.\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "title": "Venues of the 1972 Winter Olympics",
        "text": "For the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo, Japan, a total of twelve sports venues were used. A thirteenth venue which was a reserved luge course was constructed, but never used in actual competition. Construction on all of the venues used took place between 1968 and early 1971 in time for the test events. The Tsuskisamu Indoor Skating Rink was not completed until late 1971 or early 1972 because the number of teams scheduled to compete at the 1972 Games was not known. At the actual luge venue used, a malfunctioning starting gate during the first run led to the results being cancelled and rerun being ordered. The results of this event led to the only tie in Olympic luge history. The ski jumps at Miyanomori and Okurayama served as host venues for the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships thirty-five years later.\nVenues.\nCity.\nA reserve luge course was constructed south of Sapporo's Olympic village at the Fujino ski area, but was never used. Constructed between June 1968 and November 1971, the track cost ¥106 million to build. It was long for men's singles and long for women's singles and men's doubles, had 14 turns for all three luge disciplines, and had a 10% average gradient for the track. No turn names were given.\nBefore the Olympics.\nAt the 1936 Winter Olympics in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the decision to award the 1940 Winter Olympics was suspended. This was because of an issue with amateurism between the IOC and the International Ski Federation. Three years earlier, at an IOC meeting in Oslo, Japan had expressed an interest in hosting the Winter Olympics, with Sapporo and Nikkō as possible locations, though four other sites were also considered. Because Tokyo had been awarded host of the 1940 Summer Olympics, the IOC awarded Japan the 1940 Winter Games. This was confirmed by the IOC at the 1937 meeting in Cairo on the condition that the 1940 Games would be given to Norway if Japan could not organize the preparations by the fall of 1938. One of the venues of the 1940 Winter Games that would be included in the 1972 Winter Olympics was the Mount Okura ski jump. In July 1937, Japan's second invasion of China began, and despite being awarded the 1940 Winter Olympics, Sapporo was forced to withdraw from hosting the 1940 Winter Olympics as was Tokyo with the 1940 Summer Olympics.\nOkurayama was constructed using private funds in 1931.\nAt the 1959 IOC Meeting in Munich, Tokyo was selected to host the 1964 Summer Olympics. This inspired Sapporo to try to host the 1968 Winter Olympics. Sapporo submitted its bid in 1963 to the IOC. On 29 January 1964 at the IOC Meeting in Innsbruck, Sapporo finished a distant fourth to winner Grenoble for the 1968 Winter Games. Following observations of the 1964 Summer Games in Tokyo, an aggressive public relations campaign began with Sapporo and the IOC to bring the 1972 Winter Games to Sapporo. This campaign proved fruitful when Sapporo was awarded the 1972 Winter Games at the April 1966 IOC meeting in Rome.\nVenue construction began in 1968 and all but the Tsukisamu Indoor rink was completed in time for the test events at Sapporo in February 1971. Tsukisamu was not completed until late 1971 or early 1972 due to not knowing how many teams would compete at the 1972 Olympic ice hockey tournament.\nDuring the Olympics.\nDuring the men's 5000 m speed skating event, Ard Schenk of the Netherlands won the event despite a snowstorm. It was the first of Schenk's three gold medals at the games.\nThe only noted venue issue was at the Mt. Teine Luge Course was in the men's doubles event when a malfunctioning starting gate cancelled the results of the first run. Italy, whose doubles team of Paul Hildgartner and Walter Plaikner won the first run, protested to event officials the results should stand since all contestants had suffered equally, but to no avail. After the protest was denied, a rerun was ordered. Hildgartner and Plaikner won the first run of the rerunned event while the East German team of Horst Hörnlein and Reinhard Bredow had the fastest second run. The combined times were equal for the only time in Winter Olympic luge history. The International Luge Federation consulted with IOC President Avery Brundage on this matter, and gold medals were awarded to both teams as a result. By the time of the 1976 Winter Olympics, artificial track luge would be timed in thousandths of a second (0.001) rather than hundredths of a second (0.01) in an effort to avoid ties. That would prove effective until the FIL European Luge Championships 2008 at Cesana, when another tie occurred. This tie was again in the men's doubles event and it again involved Italy and Germany (East and West Germany reunified in 1990) only this time it was for a bronze medal rather than gold.\nAfter the Olympics.\nThe biathlon and cross-country skiing venues at Makomanai were temporary venues and torn down after the Olympics. The bobsleigh and luge tracks were used for recreational purposes, but no other competitions after the Olympics were held there. When Nagano was awarded the 1998 Winter Olympics in June 1991, the tracks were dismantled.\nOkurayama and Miyanomori would serve as the ski jumping venues for the ski jumping and the ski jumping portion of the Nordic combined events when Sapporo hosted the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships in 2007. It has been on the Ski Jumping World Cup circuit on an almost annual basis since 1980.\nMount Teine remains a popular alpine skiing site that has been in use since the 1972 Games."

The week of games were played at the Gimnasio Nacional José Adolfo Pineda in the city of San Salvador.\nThe hosts took a 68–66 victory over Jamaica, a game in which a loss would have meant elimination. A three-pointer by José Araujo, with 49 seconds remaining sealed the win for El Salvador.\nCenter Ronnie Aguilar was crucial in defense, as he blocked Kevin Foster at the end of the game and avoided the tie on the scoreboard. Jamaica came close to 67–66. Aguilar was sent to the free throw line and only hit the second shot with two seconds left on the clock. Jamaica was left without any timeouts and ran out of time to take a shot.\nThe celebration was immediate between players and fans. Roberto Martínez was the offensive leader from El Salvador with 19 points. Aguilar and Araujo added 11 each. Jamaica was led by Omari Johnson with 18 points and Marcel Robinson with 12 points.\nCurrent roster.\nAt the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup qualification (Americas):\nPast rosters.\nAt 2014 Centrobasket:"

        "text": "Willie Jackson (born June 22, 1962) is an American former college basketball stand-out and current high school head coach.\nPlaying career.\nHigh school.\nJackson grew up in Webster Parish, Louisiana and attended Sibley High School from 1976–77 to 1979–80. During his junior and senior years, Sibley won 100 straight games, including a perfect 58–0 season in 1979–80 which ended with a state championship.\nCollege.\nWillie Jackson decided to stay in Louisiana and signed to play at Centenary College of Louisiana, an NCAA Division I institution. He played basketball all four seasons and graduated as the most prolific scorer in both school and Trans America Athletic Conference (now the ASUN Conference) history. Between 1980–81 and 1983–84, Jackson played in 114 games and recorded 2,535 points, 1,013 rebounds, 112 blocks and 205 steals. Through the 2009–10 season, these rank him first, second, first and third in Centenary history, respectively. Only Hall of Famer Robert Parish grabbed more rebounds (1,820). He scored 30 or more points in a game 21 times and had a career high of 41. When Jackson's career ended, he was one of only seven players in Division I history to have scored 2,500+ points and grabbed 1,000+ rebounds. He remained the only TAAC/ASUN player to be honored as the Conference Player of the Year three times (1982 through 1984) before that feat was matched in 2023 by Liberty's Darius McGhee. At Jackson's graduation, he was only the fourth Division I player ever to earn three conference player of the year awards. His ASUN scoring record lasted until February 22, 2023, when it was surpassed by McGhee, who had the benefit of a fifth season of eligibility due to a blanket NCAA eligibility waiver for all basketball players active in the COVID-disrupted 2020–21 season.\nJackson was drafted in the fourth round (74th overall) in the 1984 NBA draft by the Houston Rockets, although he never played in the league. He played the 1984–85 season in the Continental Basketball Association (CBA), for the Wisconsin Flyers and Sarasota Stingers. He averaged 8.3 points and 3.4 rebounds over 35 games.\nCoaching career.\nJackson was the head boys' basketball coach Loyola College Prep in Shreveport, Louisiana. His previous coaching experience also included a stint as an assistant coach for Centenary.\nThrough the 2008–09 boys' basketball season, Jackson has become the winningest coach in school history, leading the Flyers to three playoff berths, a school-record 27 wins in 2007–08, three 20-win seasons (the most of any coach in school history), and his 118 wins was 40 more than the next closest head coach at Loyola Prep. He was also named the Coach of the Year on \"The (Shreveport) Times\" All-City team in 2004–05. He was terminated as head coach at the end of the 2012 season.\nAs of 2012–13 Willie Jackson is the head coach at Central High School in Grand Cane, Louisiana."

After a short stint in Finland and Germany with Tappara and the Hannover Indians, Hughes returned to the EBEL with Slovenian club, HDD Olimpija Ljubljana. In his first full season with Olimpija in the 2010–11 season, the skilled forward posted an impressive 64 points in 53 games, leading the league with 48 points to be selected as the EBEL rookie of the year.\nHughes bettered his initial success in the following 2011–12 season, to lead the EBEL in points scoring with 68 points in 50 games to be named the EBEL MVP with the Ron Kennedy Trophy. Hughes then signed a lucrative two-year contract with Austrian club, EC VSV, on May 2, 2012.\nAfter leading the league for a second time with 85 points in 54 games in the last year of his contract with VSV in the 2013–14 season, Hughes opted to return to his first professional club, EC Red Bull Salzburg, with the lure of the Champions Hockey League on July 1, 2014."

The Cougars, in their final season in the Mountain West Conference, played their home games at the Marriott Center. The Cougars ended regular season play as co-champions with San Diego State, and were the only team to defeat the Aztecs in regular-season play. Led by combo guard Jimmer Fredette, the nation's leading scorer and consensus national player of the year, the Cougars advanced to the Sweet Sixteen of the NCAA tournament, where they lost in overtime to Florida.\nThis was the Cougars' final season as a member of the Mountain West as their basketball team became a member of the West Coast Conference in July 2011.\nSchedule and results.\nSource\n!colspan=9 style=|Exhibition\n!colspan=9 style=| Regular Season\n!colspan=10 style= | Mountain West tournament\n!colspan=10 style= | NCAA Tournament\nRankings.\nThe team has consistently been ranked higher in computer rankings such as Jeff Sagarin's than in the AP and Coaches Polls. On November 13, 2010 they were ranked 2 in Sagarin's rankings, while they were ranked as high as 1 in Ratings Percentage Index (RPI) on January 9 and 24, 2011, as well as on February 15 and 28, 2011.\nDavies controversy.\nSophomore starting forward Brandon Davies was dismissed from the team on March 1, 2011 for the remainder of the season for a violation of the school's honor code. \"The Salt Lake Tribune\" published that the transgression involved the provision that prohibits premarital sex. This led to a media frenzy in which the Honor Code was spotlighted and debated, particularly because Davies had not committed a criminal act, or even an NCAA violation, but instead a violation of Mormon and school ethics. Davies had started 26 of 29 games for the Cougars, averaging 11.1 points and a team-leading 6.2 rebounds. At the time, BYU had a 27-2 record and ranked No. 3 nationally, while analyst Joe Lunardi of ESPN.com had projected the Cougars as the No. 1 seed in the West region for the 2011 NCAA tournament. After Davies' suspension, Lunardi maintained his stance that BYU should be a No. 1 seed as long as they continued to perform. The Cougars lost their next game 82–64 to New Mexico (19–11), who beat BYU for the second time in the season, but quickly recovered in a 102-78 victory over Wyoming."

Peter Sagan won the men's road race and Lizzie Armitstead won the women's road race.\nBidding and selection of Richmond.\nBy UCI's deadline expired on February 20, 2011, three nations had announced their intention to bid for this event:\nOn September 21, 2011, Richmond was selected as the host for the championships.\nPlanners anticipated over 500,000 visitors over the 10-day event According to the organizers the championships are believed to generate a significant economic impact in the Greater Richmond region. Staging the event can generate a $21.3 million cumulative economic impact in the region from 2012 to 2015. Visitor spending can bring a $129.2 million economic impact to the region in 2015. The Richmond 2015 visitor spending is estimated to result in $3.8 million in tax revenue for local governments in the Greater Richmond region in 2015. For Virginia, the economic impact of Richmond 2015 is estimated to be $158.1 million, from both event staging and visitor spending. Richmond 2015 is estimated to also generate $5.0 million in state tax revenue.\nQualification.\nMain qualification was based on performances on the UCI events during 2015. Results from January to the middle of August counted towards the qualification criteria, with the rankings being determined upon the release of the numerous tour rankings on August 15, 2015.\nOlympic Qualification.\nThe men's time trial and women's time trial were part of the qualification system for these cycling disciplines at the 2016 Summer Olympics.\nParticipating nations.\n791 national representatives from 76 national federations and 40 trade teams (including other riders) registered for the championships. The two riders from the Dominican Republic who would compete in the men's time trial did not start. Also riders from Syria and Uganda registered for the championships but did not start. The number of cyclists per nation that competed, excluding riders in the team time trials, is shown in parentheses.\nSchedule.\nAll events start and finish in Richmond, Virginia. All times are in Eastern Daylight Time (UTC−4).\nCourses.\nThe process for designing the courses began in the summer of 2011. Three main factors were considered when designing the courses: competitive and technical aspects; showcasing the best of the Richmond region; and the overall impact on local residents and businesses. An UCI official inspected the courses in December 2013. The courses were officially announced in February 2014. The course was used in competition during the national collegiate championships over May 2–4, 2014. All the races will finish in downtown Richmond on Broad Street, where the last few hundred meters are relatively flat. The lead-up in the final kilometers will be a bit uphill. Each lap of the 10-mile road circuit will contain a number of short, challenging climbs. Each lap of the circuit contains about of climbing and includes cobbles.\nTeam time trial.\nThe course for the team time trial is , and has a total elevation of . The team time trial starts in Henrico County at Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden, originally the Lakeside Wheel Club, founded in 1895 as a gathering spot for turn-of-the-century cyclists. The first kilometers go through Richmond's historic Northside neighborhoods leading into downtown. The course continues east of Richmond down rural Route 5, which parallels the 50-mile Virginia Capital Trail. The first few kilometers are scenic, flat, open roads that eventually narrow and wind through Richmond National Battlefield Park, a historic Civil War site. The race re-enters the city through Shockoe Bottom, eventually making a hard right turn on Governor Street to ascend . At the top, the teams have to take a sharp left turn onto the false-flat finishing straight, to the finish.\nTime trial (elite men).\nThe length of the course is and has a total elevation of . The course begins north of Richmond at Kings Dominion, Virginia's premier amusement park in Hanover County. It will go to Meadow Event Park, home to the State Fair of Virginia and birthplace of thoroughbred racing legend Secretariat. Racers will head south on long, open straights past the Hanover County Courthouse, the third oldest courthouse still in use in the U.S. and dating back to about 1740. Long hills on Brook and Wilkinson roads bring the racers back into the city through Virginia Union University before turning into downtown. Nearly half the turns of the entire route fall within the closing kilometers, the second to last of which is to ascend on Governor Street. At the top, the teams have to take a sharp left turn onto the false-flat finishing straight, to the finish.\nTime trial (elite women, under-23 and juniors).\nAll individual time trials apart from the elite men time trial are on a circuit. Elite women, under-23 and junior men will ride two laps of the circuit and junior women will complete one lap. The length of 1 lap is and has a total elevation of .\nThe circuit is a technical course that winds through the city of Richmond. The start will head west from downtown to Monument Avenue, a paver-lined, historic boulevard that's been named one of the \"10 Great Streets in America.\" From there, the course makes a 180-degree turn at N. Davis Avenue and continues in the opposite direction. The race then cuts through the Uptown district before coming back through Virginia Commonwealth University and then crossing the James River. After a technical turnaround, the race comes back across the James and works its way through downtown Richmond, eventually heading up to ascend on Governor Street. At the top, the teams have to take a sharp left turn onto the false-flat finishing straight, to the finish.\nRoad race circuit.\nThe length of the circuit is and has a total elevation of . All road races took place on a challenging, technical and inner-city road circuit. The circuit heads west from Downtown Richmond, working their way onto Monument Avenue, a paver-lined, historic boulevard that's been named one of the \"10 Great Streets in America\". Cyclists will take a 180-degree turn at the Jefferson Davis monument and then maneuver through the Uptown district and Virginia Commonwealth University. Halfway through the circuit, the race heads down into Shockoe Bottom before following the canal and passing Great Shiplock Park, the start of the Virginia Capital Trail. A sharp, off-camber turn at Rocketts Landing brings the riders to the narrow, twisty, cobbled climb up to Libby Hill Park in the historic Church Hill neighborhood. A quick descent, followed by three hard turns leads to a climb up 23rd Street. Once atop this steep cobbled hill, riders descend into Shockoe Bottom. This leads them to the final climb on Governor Street. At the top, the teams have to take a sharp left turn onto the false-flat finishing straight, to the finish.\nRanking by nations.\nFor the ranking by nations the men's and women's team time trial are excluded."

        "title": "2015 FIFA Women's World Cup",
        "text": "The 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup was the seventh FIFA Women's World Cup, the quadrennial international soccer championship contested by the women's national teams of the member associations of FIFA. The tournament was hosted by Canada for the first time and by a North American country for the third time. Matches were played in six cities across Canada in five time zones. The tournament began on 6 June 2015, and finished with the final on 5 July 2015 with a United States victory over Japan.\nThe 2015 tournament saw the World Cup expanded to 24 teams from 16 in 2011. Canada's team received direct entry as host and a qualification tournament of 134 teams was held for the remaining 23 places. With the expanded tournament, eight teams made their Women's World Cup debut. All previous Women's World Cup finalists qualified for the tournament, with defending champions Japan and returning champions Germany (2003, 2007) and the United States (1991, 1999) among the seeded teams.\nThe 2015 tournament used goal-line technology for the first time with the Hawk-Eye system. It was also the first World Cup for either men or women to be played on artificial turf, with all matches played on such surfaces, even though there were some initial concerns over a possible increased risk of injuries.\nHost selection.\nThe bidding for each FIFA Women's World Cup typically includes hosting rights for the previous year's FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup (similar to the men's version, in which the host nation stages the Confederations Cup the year before). Bids for the tournament were required to be submitted by December 2010. Only two bids were submitted:\nZimbabwe withdrew its bid on 1 March 2011. The country was seen as a long shot as its women's team was ranked 103rd in the world at the time of the bid and has never qualified for a Women's World Cup. There was also ongoing political and economic instability in the country.\nThe selected host, Canada, had previously hosted FIFA tournaments including the 1987 FIFA U-16 World Championship, 2002 FIFA U-19 Women's World Championship, the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup, which set an attendance record for that tournament, and most recently the 2014 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup.\nQualification.\nFor 2015, the number of qualifying teams grew from 16 to 24 and scheduled matches increased from 32 to 52. On 11 June 2012, FIFA announced a change to the allocation of the qualifying berths for its continental confederations. The FIFA Executive Committee approved the following slot allocation and the distribution of eight new slots:\nAfter North Korea had several players test positive for performance-enhancing drugs during the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup, FIFA banned the North Korean team from participating in the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup in Canada. This was the first time a team had been banned from a Women's World Cup, and it was the first time since 1995 that North Korea did not participate in a Women's World Cup.\nQualified teams.\nThe latest published FIFA Rankings prior to the tournament (March 2015) are shown in parentheses.\nA then-record eight nations made their Women's World Cup debut, as listed above: Cameroon, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Ivory Coast, Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, and Thailand. As of 2023, this is the last time Ecuador, Ivory Coast, and Mexico have qualified.\nVenues.\nThe cities of Vancouver, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Ottawa, Montreal and Moncton were selected to host tournament matches. Halifax was also considered, but removed itself from contention in March 2012. Toronto decided not to bid, due to potential conflicts with the 2015 Pan American Games. Due to FIFA's policy against commercial sponsorship of stadium names, Investors Group Field in Winnipeg and TD Place Stadium in Ottawa were respectively known as Winnipeg Stadium and Lansdowne Stadium during the tournament. Seating capacities shown in table below are as configured for these FIFA games.\nInnovations.\nThe tournament introduced goal-line technology with the Hawk-Eye system by which it is possible to show on the stadium screen if the ball was in or not. It was also the first World Cup for either men or women to be played on artificial turf, with all matches played on such surfaces. There were some initial concerns (please see below) over a possible increased risk of injuries from playing on artificial turf, but a legal challenge suggesting matches should be played on grass as in similar men's tournaments was dropped in January 2015.\nSquads.\nEach team's squad for the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup consisted of 23 players (three of whom must be goalkeepers), two more than the 2011 tournament, and the same number as men's World Cup squads. Each participating national association was required to confirm its final 23-player squad no later than 10 working days before the start of the tournament. Replacement of seriously injured players was permitted until 24 hours before the team in question's first World Cup game.\nThe squads were officially announced by FIFA on 28 May 2015. Formiga of Brazil and Homare Sawa of Japan were included in World Cup squads for the sixth time, a record for any men or women players.\nMatch officials.\nA total of 29 referees/support referees and 44 assistant referees were selected for the tournament.\nDraw.\nThe draw was held on 6 December 2014 at 12:00 Eastern Standard Time at the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The seeding pots were announced the day before. Because UEFA qualified eight teams into the final tournament, which had only six groups, two groups by necessity had to contain two European teams. Otherwise, no group could have more than one team from any confederation. Despite having a lower FIFA ranking than Sweden and England, Brazil was seeded ahead of both for \"geographical reasons\". Before the draw, the Organizing Committee placed the seeded teams in the following groups: Germany in Group B, Japan in Group C, United States in Group D, Brazil in Group E, and France in Group F; Canada were already in Group A as the tournament host. Not drawing the groups for the seeded teams has drawn some criticism. A FIFA spokesperson later confirmed that teams were allocated to certain groups for promotional reasons.\nThe group of death for this FIFA World Cup was Group D with three top 10-ranked teams, USA (2), Sweden (5) and Australia (10).\nGroup stage.\nThe 24 teams of the tournament were arranged into 6 groups labelled A to F. The provisional match schedule for the tournament was released on 21 March 2013, with the hosts, Canada, placed in position A1. The final schedule with match times was released on the same day right after the draw was made.\nThe first round, or group stage, saw the twenty four teams divided into six groups of four teams. Each group was played in a round-robin-format of six games, where each team played one match against each of the other teams in the same group. Teams were awarded three points for a win, one point for a draw and none for a defeat. The winners and runners-up from each group, as well as the best four third-placed teams, qualified for the first round of the knockout stage.\nRanking of third-placed teams.\nThe four best third-placed teams from the six groups advanced to the knockout stage along with the six group winners and six runners-up.\nKnockout stage.\nThe knockout stage comprised the 16 teams that advanced from the group stage of the tournament. There were four rounds of matches, with each round eliminating half of the teams entering that round. The successive rounds were the round of 16, quarter-finals, semi-finals, and the final. There was also a match to decide third and fourth place. For each game in the knockout stage, any draw at 90 minutes was followed by 30 minutes of extra time; if scores were still level, there was a penalty shootout to determine who progressed to the next round. Single yellow cards accrued were cancelled after the quarter-finals, therefore ensuring that no players miss the Final because of receiving a caution in the semi-finals.\nThree spots in the 2016 Summer Olympics women's football tournament were filled by the UEFA teams that progressed the furthest in the tournament, other than England. Two spots went to France and Germany which both reached the quarter-finals. The third spot was a tie between four teams eliminated in the round of 16: Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. A play-off tournament in March 2016 determined UEFA's third Olympic qualifier to be Sweden.\nAwards.\nThe following awards were given at the conclusion of the tournament. The Golden Ball (best overall player), Golden Boot (top scorer) and Golden Glove (best goalkeeper) awards were sponsored by Adidas, while the Best Young Player and Goal of the Tournament awards were sponsored by Hyundai Motor Company. FIFA.com shortlisted twelve goals for users to vote on as the tournaments' best, with the poll closing on 13 July 2015.\nOn 2 July 2015, following the semi-finals, FIFA announced the shortlists for three of the tournament awards. The following candidates were ultimately not selected:\nAll-Star Squad.\nThe All-Star Squad elected by FIFA's Technical Study Group consists of the following players:\nDream Team.\nThe Dream Team elected by users of fifa.com consists of the following players and manager:\nPrize money.\nThe total prize money offered by FIFA for the tournament was US$15 million. The winning team, United States, received $2 million. \nControversies.\nAll of the tournament's venues had fields composed of artificial turf, which some players believe results in a higher risk of injuries to players. More than 50 players protested the use of the surface instead of grass on the basis of gender discrimination. They filed a lawsuit challenging FIFA's decision to play on artificial turf, claiming FIFA would never allow the men's World Cup to be played on \"unsafe\" artificial turf and thus the organizers had violated the Canadian Human Rights Act. 2012 Women's World Player of the Year Abby Wambach noted \"The men would strike playing on artificial turf.\" The controversial issue of gender equality and an equal playing field for all sparked debate in many countries around the world. An application filed on 1 October 2014 with the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal by a group of women's international soccer players against FIFA and the Canadian Soccer Association noted that, in 1994, FIFA spent $2 million to plant natural grass over artificial turf in New Jersey and Detroit. Some celebrities and prominent players showed their support for the women soccer players in defence of their lawsuit, including United States men's team keeper Tim Howard. Even with the possibility of boycotts, FIFA's head of women's competitions, Tatjana Haenni, made it clear \"We play on artificial turf and there's no Plan B.\" In January 2015, the lawsuit was withdrawn by the players.\nFox commentator Julie Stewart-Binks measured the turf temperature at several games. On 21 June at the Canada vs Switzerland round of 16 game in Vancouver, she reported that her thermometer was \"officially broken\". Her thermometer appears to max out at .\nDuring the tournament, Australian striker Michelle Heyman slammed the playing conditions, saying the turf is like \"walking on hot coals\" and the players feet \"just turn white, your skin is all ripped off\".\nPrior to the start of the Australia vs Japan quarterfinal in Edmonton on 27 June, Fox commentator Kyndra de St. Aubin measured the air temperature at and the turf temperature at . Despite such dangerous conditions, officials decided against taking cooling breaks during the match because the air temperature was under . As the game wore on, players appeared noticeably exhausted due to the playing conditions.\nAttendance was largely inflated by FIFA as single tickets were sold for double-headers during the group stages. \"This allows FIFA to report the combined attendance for both matches as the attendance for each match when in reality the true attendance for one or both matches is likely to be much different.\"\nBroadcasting.\nThe 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup was one of the first FIFA tournaments under new rights deals in two North American markets. In its host country of Canada, Bell Media acquired the broadcast rights; the competition was televised by CTV and TSN in English, as well as Réseau des sports (RDS) in French. In the United States, English-language television rights were held by Fox Sports with coverage carried on the main Fox broadcast network, along with the Fox Sports 1 and Fox Sports 2 pay TV channels. Spanish-language rights were held by Telemundo and sister cable network NBC Universo. Fox constructed a temporary studio for the Women's World Cup at Jack Poole Plaza in Vancouver, located outside the Vancouver Convention Centre.\nIn December 2014, the European Broadcasting Union extended its rights to FIFA tournaments for its members in 37 countries, including the 2015 Women's World Cup. In the United Kingdom, all matches from the tournament were shown by the BBC via BBC One, BBC Two, BBC Three and BBC Red Button on TV and Radio 5 Live on radio. In Australia, SBS aired all 52 matches live online, and televised 41 matches live, with the only matches not televised live being those which aired concurrently.\nMarketing.\nMascot.\nOn 17 June 2014, the mascot of the tournament, Shuéme, a female great white owl, was unveiled at the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa.\nSponsorships.\nIn the final week of the tournament, the Canadian government added Gazprom to a list of organizations sanctioned for supporting the Russian annexation of Crimea. Media suggested the addition was delayed to reduce embarrassment to FIFA."

The six-lane center, open to the campus community, serves as the practice facility for the MSU bowling teams.\nDuring the 2006-2007 academic year, the center was completely remodeled. The lanes are now equipped with Brunswick A-2 pin spotters and were resurfaced with the state-of-the-art Kegel Edge synthetic lane surface. The Larry Wilson University Lanes are one of two bowling facilities in the United States to use this surface. The settee and counter areas were refurbished with new flooring, lighting, and furniture. New masking units were added as well.\nThe lanes are maintained using the Kegel Phoenix-S. This machine is capable of having oil patterns uploaded, allowing the teams to prepare on patterns more similar to tournament conditions.\nAdjacent to the Larry Wilson University Lanes is a team room to be used for storage of equipment by bowling team members as well as pro shop equipment.\nIn 2009 the facility acquired a fully functional pro-shop to aid the MSU bowling team in getting all of their equipment drilled without having to travel to any surrounding bowling center. The center is also USBC Sanctioned.\nAlso over the summer, the old pins were replaced with the new synthetic Twister Pins.\nNational Championships and Other Accomplishments.\nWomen.\nThe MSU women have won national championships in 1989, 1998, 2000 and 2002, were runners-up in 1993, and finished in third place in 2006 and 2008.\nSince 2002, the Morehead State women's bowling team has finished in the top 10 six times, from the 2002-2003 season up to the 2007-2008 season.\nMen.\nSince 2002, the Morehead State men's bowling team has finished in the top 10 in 2002–2003 and 2004–2005 seasons. The men's squad was runner-up in its 2003 tournament and took third place in 2005. The Morehead State men's team also made a trip to nationals in 2016 in Wichita, Kansas.\nNotable alumni.\nCurrent and former Eagle bowlers represent the best that the sport has to offer.\nFour MSU bowlers have represented the United States of America in international competition as members of Team USA: Joy Esterson (2004), Liz Johnson (1994–96, 2008–present), Kelly Kulick (1998–2001, 2008–present), and David O'Sullivan (2007). Members of Junior Team USA have also included three Eagles: Lindsey Coulles (2003–04), Joy Esterson (2003), and David O'Sullivan (2004). Former Lady Eagle Robin (Crawford) Orlikowski represents her native country as a member of Team Canada (2000–present)."

Prior to joining Coastal Carolina, he was the offensive coordinator at North Carolina State University, a position he had held since 2020.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nBeck was born in Youngstown, Ohio on March 14, 1966, and graduated from Cardinal Mooney High School. Fellow football coaches Bo Pelini, Carl Pelini, Bob Stoops, Mark Stoops, and Mike Stoops also graduated from Cardinal Mooney.\nPlaying career.\nBeck played one year of football at UCF (1985) and graduated from there in 1988 with a degree in liberal studies.\nCoaching career.\nBeck began his football coaching career as an assistant coach in 1988 at Miramar High School in Miramar, Florida. After two seasons, Beck advanced to the college coaching ranks by taking a position as outside linebackers coach and punters coach for the Illinois State Redbirds. Just one year later, Beck moved to his first position at a Big 12 Conference school when he was brought into the Kansas State program as a graduate assistant by Wildcats head coach Bill Snyder.\nFollowing his two years at Kansas State, Beck assumed his first head coaching position in a return to the high school ranks, when he was appointed to lead the Sabercats of Saguaro High School in Scottsdale, Arizona. The Sabercats had struggled for some time prior to his arrival, its record only 5–43 in the previous five years. In his third year at Saguaro, Beck led the Sabercats football team to the 1995 Arizona divisional state championship title, the first ever in the school's entire 30-year history, while assembling a 20–15 record during his tenure.\nWith his first head coaching title realized, Beck returned to the college coaching ranks in 1996 by accepting an assistant coaching position at Missouri State, and was promoted to offensive coordinator for the 1998 season. In his one year as MSU's offensive coordinator, the Bears amassed 4,542 all-purpose offensive yards, the fourth-highest mark in the university's 91-year history.\nBeck was called back to the high school ranks in 1999 when he was hired to lead the R. L. Turner High School Lions in Carrollton, Texas, where he led the school to its first consecutive winning seasons and playoff appearances in 25 years, being named the district's coach of the year in 2000. Beck was then appointed to the top position at Mansfield Summit High School in Mansfield, Texas in 2002, where he was named their district coach of the year in his second season. Improving on the 2003 recognition, Beck led the Jaguars to the 2004 Texas state playoff quarterfinals and a 9–4 record, finishing the season with the highest-rated defense in the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area.\nKansas.\nIn 2005, Beck returned to the college football coaching arena, accepting the position of wide receivers coach at the University of Kansas. The Jayhawks had been struggling for consistency, posting no conference wins in 2002, losing the bowl game in their 6–7 campaign of 2003, and missing bowl eligibility in the 4–7 season of 2004. Beck's receivers helped the 2005 Kansas team to a 7–5 record and their first bowl win since 1995. In 2006, four different Jayhawks receivers caught 24 or more passes, though the 6–6 team was not extended a bowl invitation. In 2007 Beck was also appointed as the Passing Game Coordinator at Kansas, and the season proved to be a breakthrough year for the Jayhawks. Kansas finished 12–1 with the second-best scoring offense nationally, shared the Big 12 Conference North division title with Missouri, and secured a final #7 ranking in both the AP and Coaches polls with their 24–21 win over #5 Virginia Tech in the 2008 Orange Bowl.\nNebraska.\nWhen Bo Pelini was named as Nebraska's 32nd head football coach for the program's turnaround 2008 season, Beck accepted the position of running backs coach for the Cornhuskers. In his first season, the Cornhuskers averaged 169.8 running yards per game, with three of the team's running backs amassing over 450 yards on the year and placing Nebraska as the leading ground yardage team of the conference's north division. 2009 saw the average fall slightly to 147.1 running yards per game, but thanks in part to Nebraska's effective defensive game this was still enough to outgain all but three of the season's opponents on the ground. Running back Roy Helu, Jr. recorded 1,147 yards on the year, while two Cornhusker true freshman backs secured a pair of touchdowns each for the first time since 1993.\nNebraska's 2010 ground offense was revitalized further by the emergence of redshirt freshman quarterback Taylor Martinez, who almost became just the third freshman quarterback in NCAA history to record over 1,000 yards on the ground, rushing for 965 yards. The 451 yards accumulated against Kansas State was Nebraska's highest total in 109 games.\nFollowing Nebraska's offensive performance issues in 2010, Pelini replaced offensive coordinator Shawn Watson by promoting Beck to the top offensive spot. Beck also assumed responsibility for coaching the quarterbacks.\nOhio State.\nBeck became co-offensive coordinator for the Ohio State Buckeyes following the 2015 College Football Playoff National Championship, when Tom Herman left to become the head football coach at University of Houston.\nTexas.\nOn January 3, 2017, it was announced that Beck would be leaving Ohio State to take over as the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach for Texas and new head coach Tom Herman.\nOn December 1, 2019, after a disappointing 7–5 regular season, Herman announced that Beck would be demoted from offensive coordinator, but would remain with the team as the quarterbacks coach for their bowl game.\nNC State.\nOn January 1, 2020, it was announced that Beck would become the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach for North Carolina State.\nCoastal Carolina.\nOn December 4, 2022, it was announced that Beck would become the new head coach at Coastal Carolina University."

        "title": "2018 FIFA World Cup qualification",
        "text": "The 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification process was a series of tournaments organised by the six FIFA confederations to decide 31 of the 32 teams which would play in the 2018 FIFA World Cup, with Russia qualifying automatically as hosts. All 210 remaining FIFA member associations were eligible to enter the qualifying process, and for the first time in World Cup history, all eligible national teams registered for the preliminary competition, but Zimbabwe and Indonesia were disqualified before playing their first matches. Bhutan, South Sudan, Gibraltar and Kosovo made their FIFA World Cup qualification debuts, while Myanmar participated after successfully appealing against a ban from the competition, although the team was obliged to play its home matches outside the country.\nWhile the main qualifying draw took place at the Konstantinovsky Palace in Strelna, Saint Petersburg, on 25 July 2015, qualification matches were played before that. The first, between Timor-Leste and Mongolia, began in Dili on 12 March 2015 as part of the AFC's qualification, with East Timorese player Chiquito do Carmo scoring the first goal in qualification. Matches were also played in CONCACAF prior to the main draw.\nQualification process.\nThe number of teams participating in the final tournament was 32. Even though the qualification process began in March 2015, the allocation of slots for each confederation was discussed by the FIFA Executive Committee on 30 May 2015 in Zürich after the FIFA Congress. It was decided that the same allocation as 2014 would be kept for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments.\nProposal for expansion.\nIn October 2013, UEFA President Michel Platini proposed that the World Cup finals should be expanded from 32 to 40 teams starting from 2018. The format would have been the same, but in groups of five instead of four. This was in response to FIFA President Sepp Blatter's comments that Africa and Asia deserved more spots in the World Cup finals at the expense of European and South American teams. However, FIFA general secretary Jérôme Valcke said that expansion in 2018 would be \"unlikely\", while Russian sports minister Vitaly Mutko said that the country was \"preparing on the basis that 32 teams will be taking part.\" Expansion was ultimately delayed until 10 January 2017, when the FIFA Council voted unanimously to expand to 48 teams starting in the 2026 FIFA World Cup.\nSummary of qualification.\nWhile all FIFA members entered the tournament, not all competed. Zimbabwe were expelled from the competition on 12 March 2015 for their failure to pay former coach José Claudinei a severance fee and Indonesia were excluded from the qualifying competition following the suspension of their football association by FIFA on 30 May 2015. Kuwait had a number of their qualifiers cancelled for a similar suspension that began while their campaign was underway, which eventually resulted in their elimination. Brazil were the first team to achieve qualification for the tournament following their 3–0 victory over Paraguay and Uruguay's loss to Peru on 28 March 2017. Peru became the 32nd and final team to qualify when, 233 days after Brazil secured their place, they beat New Zealand 2–0 on aggregate in the OFC-CONMEBOL play-off.\n\"Note: One team each from AFC, CONCACAF, CONMEBOL, and OFC played in the inter-confederation play-offs, between 10–15 November 2017 (CONCACAF v AFC and OFC v CONMEBOL).\"\n\"Note: UEFA total includes \"+1\" for Russia as hosts.\"\nFormat.\nThe formats of the qualifying competitions depended on each confederation \"(see below)\". Each round might be played in either of the following formats:\nTiebreakers.\nIn league format, the ranking of teams in each group is based on the following criteria (regulations Articles 20.6 and 20.7):\nIn cases where teams finishing in the same position across different groups are compared for determining which teams advance to the next stage, the criteria are decided by the confederation and require the approval of FIFA (regulations Article 20.8).\nIn knockout format, the team that has the higher aggregate score over the two legs progresses to the next round. In the event that aggregate scores finish level, the away goals rule is applied, i.e. the team that scored more goals away from home over the two legs progresses. If away goals are also equal, then thirty minutes of extra time are played, divided into two fifteen-minutes halves. The away goals rule is again applied after extra time, i.e. if there are goals scored during extra time and the aggregate score is still level, the visiting team qualifies by virtue of more away goals scored. If no goals are scored during extra time, the tie is decided by penalty shoot-out (regulations Article 20.9).\nConfederation qualification.\nAFC.\nThe AFC Executive Committee meeting on 16 April 2014 approved the proposal to merge the preliminary qualification rounds of the FIFA World Cup and the AFC Asian Cup, which was expanded to 24 teams starting in 2019:\nFinal positions (third round).\nThe draw for the third round was held on 12 April 2016 at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\nFourth round.\nThe third-placed teams from each group in the third round played against each other home-and-away over two legs to determine which team advanced to the inter-confederation play-offs.\nCAF.\nThe CAF Executive Committee approved the format for the qualifiers of the 2018 FIFA World Cup on 14 January 2015. However, on 9 July 2015 FIFA officially announced that only three rounds would be played instead of four.\nZimbabwe, even though they entered the competition, were expelled on 12 March 2015 for their failure to pay former coach José Claudinei a severance fee. Therefore, only 53 African teams were involved in the draw.\nFinal positions (third round).\nThe draw for the third round was held on 24 June 2016 at the CAF headquarters in Cairo, Egypt.\nCONCACAF.\nAn amendment to the qualification process for this tournament had been suggested, which would see the first three rounds played as knockout rounds, with both the fourth round and the final round (referred to as 'The Hex') played as group stages. The first round would be played during the FIFA international dates of 23–31 March 2015. CONCACAF announced the full details on 12 January 2015:\nFinal positions (fifth round).\nThe draw for the fifth round (to decide the fixtures) was held on 8 July 2016 at the CONCACAF headquarters in Miami Beach, United States.\nCONMEBOL.\nThe qualification structure was the same as the previous five editions. The ten teams played in a league of home-and-away round-robin matches. The top four teams qualified for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, and the fifth-placed team advanced to the inter-confederation play-offs.\nUnlike previous qualifying tournaments where the fixtures were pre-determined, the fixtures were decided by a draw held on 25 July 2015, at the Konstantinovsky Palace in Strelna, Saint Petersburg, Russia.\nOFC.\nThe qualification structure was as follows:\nThe OFC had considered different proposals of the qualifying tournament. A previous proposal adopted by the OFC in October 2014 would have the eight teams divided into two groups of four teams to play home-and-away round-robin matches in the second round, followed by the top two teams of each group advancing to the third round to play in a single group of home-and-away round-robin matches to decide the winners of the 2016 OFC Nations Cup which would qualify to the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and advance to the inter-confederation play-offs. However, it was later reported in April 2015 that the OFC had reversed its decision, and the 2016 OFC Nations Cup was played as a one-off tournament similar to the 2012 OFC Nations Cup.\nFinal positions (third round).\nThe draw for the third round was held on 8 July 2016 at the OFC headquarters in Auckland, New Zealand.\nFinal\nThe draw for the final (which decided the order of legs) was held on 15 June 2017 at the OFC headquarters in Auckland, New Zealand. The winners of the final advanced to inter-confederation play-offs.\nUEFA.\nRussia qualified automatically as hosts. The qualifying format for the remaining FIFA-affiliated UEFA teams was confirmed by the UEFA Executive Committee meeting on 22–23 March 2015 in Vienna.\nFinal positions (first round).\nThe draw for the first round was held on 25 July 2015, at the Konstantinovsky Palace in Strelna, Saint Petersburg, Russia.\nSecond round.\nThe draw for the second round (play-offs) was held on 17 October 2017 at the FIFA headquarters in Zürich, Switzerland. The winners of each tie qualified for the World Cup.\nInter-confederation play-offs.\nThere were two inter-confederation playoffs to determine the final two qualification spots for the finals. The first legs were played on 10 and 11 November 2017, and the second legs were played on 15 November 2017.\nThe matchups were decided at the preliminary draw which was held on 25 July 2015, at the Konstantinovsky Palace in Strelna, Saint Petersburg, Russia.\nTop goalscorers.\nBelow are goalscorer lists for all confederations and the inter-confederation play-offs:"

        "text": "Tarlair Swimming Pool is a disused lido at the base of a sea cliff just outside Macduff in Aberdeenshire in Scotland. This outdoor swimming complex was built in an Art Deco style with a main building backing onto the cliffs and changing rooms to its left hand side. It is considered by Historic Environment Scotland to be the best example of only three surviving outdoor seaside pools in Scotland, the others being at Stonehaven and Gourock.\nThe design of the pool was a clever use of pumped sea water to fill the pools, and flooding of the main pool at high tide to flush out the old water. The main pool had a diving board at the deep end and a child's chute at the shallow end, though both are now missing. The second-largest pool was a boating pool with the two remaining pools being paddling pools.\nThe complex is now in some disrepair with a mixture of weathering, rock falls and vandalism being the main causes.\nChannel 4 television made \"Tarlair Outdoor Pool\" the subject of the third episode of a series of six documentary films on \"Britain's Abandoned Playgrounds\". The site also features in the Stuart MacBride novel, \"The Missing and the Dead\", when a child's body is found in the pool.\nHistory.\nThe pool was commissioned by Macduff Burgh Council in 1929, with the architect being John C Miller, the Burgh Surveyor of MacDuff. The contractor for the project was Robert Morrison &amp; Son of Macduff. The pool operated from 1931 until the mid-1990s.\nBetween 1985 and 1994 Tarlair Swimming Pool was used as an open air concert arena where bands like Jethro Tull, Runrig and Wet Wet Wet played.\nSince 2007 it has been protected as a category A listed building.\nIn 2010, a proposal was put forward for redevelopment of the complex as a lobster hatchery. The plans were never realised.\nA \"Friends of Tarlair\" group was formed in 2012. There were proposals from Aberdeenshire Council to fill some or all of the pool, but this was thrown out in January 2013. Later that year, councillors agreed to contribute £300,000 towards refurbishing the pool. In 2020 the Friends of Tarlair organisation had a formal application to Aberdeenshire Council to have ownership of Tarlair Swimming Pool transferred over to the group accepted."

Two years later he accepted a job at the Des Moines Oak Leafs, where he worked again as a head coach, reaching the team twice in a row to qualify for the playoffs. In season 1972/73 he was appointed to the newly formed World Hockey Association and became a coach with the Los Angeles Sharks. In his first season with the team he made the move into the playoffs and failed in the first round against the Houston Aeros.

        "text": "The 2012 Major League Baseball season began on April 5 because during the MLB Spring Training it was the first of a two-game series between the Seattle Mariners and the Oakland Athletics at the Tokyo Dome in Japan. On November 22, 2011, a new contract between Major League Baseball and its players union was ratified, and as a result, an expanded playoff format adding two clubs would be adopted no later than 2013 according to the new Collective Bargaining Agreement. The new format of the 2012 postseason to used the 1 game series of the Wild Card round of the format for the 2012 postseason only. The restriction against divisional rivals playing against each other in the Division Series round that had existed in previous years was eliminated, as the Baltimore Orioles and New York Yankees squared off in one of the best-of-five LDS in the American League. On April 4, 2012, it was the last day of the MLB Spring Training and ended with the new Marlins Park, as the newly renamed Miami Marlins hosted the defending World Series champion St. Louis Cardinals. The regular season ended on Wednesday, October 3. The entire master schedule was released on September 14, 2011.\nThe Major League Baseball postseason was expanded to include a second wild card team in each league beginning in the 2012 season. The season marked the last for the Houston Astros as a member of the National League. Following the sale to new owner Jim Crane, the Astros agreed to move to the American League effective in the 2013 season, and would be assigned to the American League West, joining their in-state rivals, the Texas Rangers.\nThe Major League Baseball All-Star Game's 83rd edition was held on July 10 at Kauffman Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, with the National League winning the All-Star Game for the third consecutive year in an 8–0 shutout of the American League. With the win, the National League champion earned home field advantage for the World Series, which began on October 24 and ended on October 28 when the San Francisco Giants swept the Detroit Tigers. The Civil Rights Game was held on August 18 at Turner Field, as the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the host Atlanta Braves, 6–2.\nManagerial changes.\nField managers.\nOff-season.\nThe following managers were hired for the 2012 season after the former manager retired from baseball.\nAt the end of the 2011 season, the following teams made replacements to their managers.\nUniforms.\nNew uniforms.\nWholesale changes.\nFive teams have made wholesale changes to their uniforms in 2012, while a sixth has new road uniforms. Two other teams added alternate uniforms to their existing set.\nThe San Diego Padres were the first team to announce changes to their logos and uniform set on November 9. The new primary features the \"SD\" cap logo inside a navy circle with the words \"San Diego Padres Baseball Club\" encircling it. The \"swinging friar\" logo was also revived, albeit in the current colors. Another secondary logo features the Padres script from last season below the depiction of Petco Park in sand and above the year of establishment; a blue and white version is used on the away and alternate uniforms. The front of the home uniform remains the same, except that the sand trim in \"Padres\" is now in trim instead of a drop shadow and the addition of navy piping. Originally they'll use the sand Petco patch on the left sleeve, but upon unveiling the uniforms, the \"swinging friar\" patch was placed instead. The road uniforms now feature \"San Diego\" in an arched position with navy piping. The alternate blue uniforms feature the \"SD\" cap logo on the left chest with white piping. All three uniforms now feature the block numerals on the reverse side. The digital camouflage uniforms were retained, save for the change to block numerals. The caps with the sand \"SD\" were retired.\nThe Marlins unveiled their changes on November 11, 2011, as the team was rebranded as the Miami Marlins, complete with a new logo featuring a stylized Marlin jumping over an art deco colored \"M\" in coral, yellow and blue. \"MIAMI\" will grace the primary white uniform, and there will be an orange home alternate which feature the team name, while the black alt had been reduced to road alternate jersey. The black cap is used for the regular home, away and black alternates, while the orange cap is paired with the orange alternates. The Marlins become the second team to use the city (or state) name on the home uniforms, after the Texas Rangers.\nNovember 15 saw the Baltimore Orioles redesign their road and home uniform sets and returned to a version of the cartoon logo used from the mid-1960s to 1988. The home caps are white in front and black on the back with an orange bill, while the away caps will be all black with an orange bill, both featuring the cartoon bird. They also unveiled a modernized version of the orange alternate uniforms last worn in 1992, and were worn on select home games, but retained the black alternate uniforms paired with the black and orange cap with the \"O's\" script.\nAs part of their golden anniversary season, the New York Mets modified their home and road uniforms to resemble the style worn in 1962, having their unveiling November 16. The black drop-shadow trim was removed from the team/city script logos, player numerals and name lettering on the off-white pinstriped home uniforms (now the primary home uniform), the white alternate home uniforms, and the grey road uniforms, all of which were worn only with the team's traditional blue cap with orange \"NY\" crest and blue undersleeves, belts and socks. In addition, the black alternate jersey (which will be worn occasionally on the road in 2012) is being phased out, to be replaced by a blue alternate starting in 2013. The solid black cap with the blue/white/orange crest will also be retained for one more season, to be worn only with the black alternate jersey. The black cap with blue bill and blue/orange crest has been eliminated. In addition, the Mets have removed the color black from their batting-practice jerseys and caps; both will be blue with orange lettering/logos outlined in white.\nThe Toronto Blue Jays unveiled new uniforms on November 18, returning to a variation of their vintage logo used from 1977 through 1996. The new logo is similar to the original used from 1977–96, with a few exceptions: a more prominent maple leaf, a sleeker-looking blue jay, serifed modern lettering on the team name, and a split-line blue circle enclosing the logo. The new uniforms are similarly based on the set used from 1989–96; a white home uniform with \"Blue Jays\", a grey road uniform with \"Toronto\", and a blue alternate uniform with \"Blue Jays\". The team/city name is arched above the secondary logo of the blue jay with the maple leaf, sans the baseball, situated on the left side. The secondary logo is also placed in the blue cap. The uniforms use the breathable double-knit polyester fabric, claiming the previously lighter Climate Base fabric became too heavy, once players began to sweat.\nThe Colorado Rockies replaced their purple road pinstripes with a more traditional solid gray uniform which was unveiled at RockiesFest in Denver in January 2012.\nThe San Francisco Giants and Atlanta Braves added alternate uniforms to their set. The Giants wear a Sunday road game grey alternate based on the road uniforms they wore during their 1989 World Series run, with the interlocking 'SF' logo on the left chest and black neck-hoop piping. The black piping was also incorporated into the team's normal road gray uniforms. The Braves unveiled a cream (heritage white) home alternates based on the uniforms worn in their first season in Atlanta. The uniform has the 'Braves' wordmark without the tomahawk with the uniform number below on the left chest and navy piping. The sleeves have a logo commemorating the Braves franchise's first season in 1876.\nDodgers logo.\nA new, slightly altered Los Angeles Dodgers logo made its way to the Dodgers dugout wall at Dodger Stadium and for their \"Social September\" promotion in September 2011. The baseball and flight lines have been thickened, while the \"o\" in the script \"Dodgers\" no longer has a line on the bottom left. The home uniform script continues to use the previous script, though.\nCaps and jerseys.\nAfter reviving the popular Northwest Green jerseys at home, the Seattle Mariners are bringing back their navy with teal bill caps, last worn in 2002, for Monday and Friday home contests. Also, their navy road alternate will now have \"SEATTLE\" on the jersey front.\nThe Royals unveiled minor tweaks to their light blue home alternate jersey, with all numbers and lettering now white with royal trim, and a revamped away uniform (changed to a darker blue-gray color and a revamped \"Kansas City\" script). In addition, the team has dropped their light blue caps.\nThe Cleveland Indians made minor tweaks to the home and alternate uniforms. The white home uniform features navy collar piping and the 'Indians' script in red and navy trim, removing the white inner trim as well as the navy piping on the button lines.

This patch will be placed on all uniforms.\nThrowbacks.\nAs part of their 40th anniversary in Arlington, the Texas Rangers will wear replicas of the four different uniforms they've worn throughout the team's history, the most notable of which are the two uniforms worn during the ownership of then-future President of the United States George W. Bush.\nAs part of their 50th anniversary, the Astros will wear throwbacks throughout the season, including a game with uniforms.\nThe Red Sox and the Yankees wore 1912 throwbacks on April 20 to mark the 100th anniversary of Fenway Park.

Due to the fact the Rays did not exist as a franchise in 1979, their uniform design was inspired from popular uniform styles such as pullovers and two-tone caps.\nThe San Diego Padres and New York Mets wore 1989 throwback uniforms on August 3.\nThe St. Louis Cardinals and Milwaukee Brewers celebrated the 30th anniversary of the 1982 World Series by wearing throwback uniforms on August 4. The Cardinals also added a 30th anniversary patch commemorating their World Series victory, exclusive to their throwback uniforms. The next night, the Cardinals wore their road blue uniforms against the Brewers.\nThe Cincinnati Reds and Philadelphia Phillies wore throwback uniforms from the 1991 season on August 22. Ironically, on June 16, 1991, the Reds and Phillies had worn 1957 uniforms at Veterans Stadium. The Reds won both games.\nOther uniforms.\nThe Cardinals wore special uniforms to commemorate their 2011 World Series win on April 13–14. The 'STL' on the caps was gold with navy trim, while the word 'Cardinals' and the block numbers on the uniforms were gold with navy trim. The Cardinals wore them during the unfurling of their championship flag on April 13, and the presentation of the Commissioner's Trophy and World Series rings on April 14.\nMLB players wore No. 42 on April 15, the 65th anniversary of Jackie Robinson's MLB debut. The Dodgers wore a Brooklyn-era cap and batting helmet that day, as well.\nThe Pirates and Orioles donned camouflage uniforms during Memorial Day weekend.\nThe Brewers wore an Italian-language batting practice uniform with the word \"Birrai\" on July 1; their opponents Arizona Diamondbacks ('I D-Backs') also wore Italian-language uniforms.

The team officially adopted its new name of Miami Marlins on November 11, 2011.\nAnniversaries.\nThe 2012 season marked the 100th anniversary of the opening of Boston's Fenway Park. In addition, Dodger Stadium—home of the Los Angeles Dodgers—celebrated its 50th anniversary, and the Baltimore Orioles home, Oriole Park at Camden Yards, also celebrated its 20th anniversary.\nMets, Astros golden anniversaries.\nThe 2012 season also marked the 50th anniversary for the New York Mets and the Houston Astros, but the 51st season for both teams.\nThe Mets began play four years after the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants moved west in 1958, leaving New York City with only one MLB team in the Yankees. In 1959, New York City attorney William Shea, with support from baseball figures including former Dodgers executive Branch Rickey, proposed a third major league called the Continental League. Houston and New York City were both among the announced CL cities. MLB responded to the threat by placing new franchises in several of these cities, and offered a National League franchise to the owners of the proposed New York CL team, who accepted. With Shea's goal of bringing a second major-league team to New York successful, he abandoned the new league, which officially folded in 1960 without ever playing a game. The Mets began play in 1962 at the Giants' former home of the Polo Grounds in Manhattan, moved in 1964 to Shea Stadium (named after the aforementioned William Shea) in Queens, and opened their current home of Citi Field, adjacent to the former Shea Stadium site, in 2009.\nThe Astros were also enfranchised as a direct response to the plans to launch the CL. They began play in 1962 as the Houston Colt .45s; following a dispute with Colt Firearms over revenues from souvenir sales and licensing fees, the team moved to the Astrodome in 1965 and renamed itself the Astros. In 2000, they opened their current home, now known as Minute Maid Park. In honor of the Astros' 50th anniversary, they donned different throwback uniforms at home on Friday night themed to each decade.\nTelevision.\nNational.\nMajor League Baseball enters the 6th year of seven-year contracts it signed with its broadcast partners prior to the 2007 season. This year, Fox will televise the Saturday Game of the Week (which will be shown in prime time each week from May 19 to July 7), the All-Star Game, the National League Championship Series, and the World Series. TBS will show a Sunday Game of the Week, the All-Star Selection Show, all but two Division Series games, the American League Championship Series, and the new wild card elimination games. ESPN will show games on Sunday, Monday, and Wednesday nights (with Monday and Wednesday Night Baseball airing on ESPN2 during April, May and early June due to ESPN's priority to the NBA regular season and playoff coverage, and then Monday Night Baseball moving to form either a Wednesday night doubleheader or a simultaneous airing of a Monday Night game on ESPN and a Wednesday Night game on ESPN2 when the NFL season starts, to accommodate Monday Night Football), and the All-Star Home Run Derby. They will also air 10 spring training games, as well as five nationally televised games on Opening Week from April 4–6. The MLB Network will air a national Game of the Week broadcast every Thursday and the two Division Series games not shown on TBS. Major League Baseball International will air in syndication the All-Star Game, the ALCS, and the World Series to global markets.\nLocal.\nThe Padres have switched from Cox Cable-owned 4SD to a new channel called Fox Sports San Diego, which the Padres also have a minority stake in.\nThis is the last season of Houston Astros games on Fox Sports Houston and KTXH. Starting next season, all games will be on Comcast SportsNet Houston, a new channel the Astros will co-own with the Houston Rockets.\nThe Mid-Atlantic Sports Network (MASN), which broadcasts Orioles and Nationals games, became the latest network to adjust its score box to the aspect ratio for high-definition television broadcasts. The adjustment, which began with Fox Sports' MLB coverage in 2010, was later adopted to other networks, notably ESPN, TBS, Fox Sports Net (except Fox Sports South and some terrestrial television broadcasts produced by Fox Sports), and Root Sports during the 2011 season. As of this season, only the YES Network, New England Sports Network, Comcast SportsNet, SportsNet New York and SportsTime Ohio have yet to move to the newly adjusted high definition broadcast."

        "text": "For the 1960 Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley, California, in the United States, a total of five sports venues were used. Except for the Palisades Tahoe, all of the venues had to be constructed. For the first time in Winter Olympic history, a temporary venue was constructed at McKinney Creek for biathlon, cross-country skiing, and Nordic combined. A bobsleigh track was not constructed over the guarantees from the FIBT not being able to field the minimum twelve teams needed to compete, making it the only time bobsleigh has not been included in the Winter Olympics.\nBefore the Olympics.\nBobsleigh was not included at this Winter Olympics at a 1957 International Olympic Committee meeting in Sofia, Bulgaria because of a lack of assurance from the International Bobsleigh Federation (FIBT) on having a minimum twelve teams. This was why a track was not constructed for the 1960 Games. As a result, an extraordinary event would take place at the 1956 Winter Olympic venue used for bobsleigh.\nThe ski jump was designed in 1957 with construction beginning the following year. It was completed the following year with trial events taking place in February 1959. The jumps had calculation (K) points of , , and , the first time in Olympic history that there were three ski jumps.\nMcKinney Creek Stadium was constructed in August 1959 and completed in time for the 1960 Games.\nDuring the Olympics.\nThe speed skating venue used a Zamboni-type machine that could completely resurface the oval in 45 minutes. This led to four world records being set at the oval.\nThe cross-country men's 4 x 10 km relay event at McKinney Stadium produced an exciting finish in which Finland edged out Norway by 0.8 seconds, the closest event finish in Olympic history until Norway lost out again 34 years later by 0.4 seconds, only this time to Italy.\nAfter the Olympics.\nBlyth Arena continued as an indoor venue until a heavy snowstorm in 1983 collapsed the roof. By 1991, the arena was demolished as replaced by an outdoor arena that was part of a revitalization plan in Squaw Valley. The speed skating venue was also dismantled by 1991.\nThe jump was used for the US National Championships in 1976 following renovations. Afterwards, the jump became known for speed skiing and snowboarding events and now serve as alpine skiing events.\nAfter the Olympics, McKinney Creek Stadium was dismantled since it was a temporary venue. The trails where the cross-country skiing and biathlon events took place are popular off-road trails.\nPalisades Tahoe hosted an Alpine Skiing World Cup in early 1969, the only alpine event of significance held there since 1960. FIS Races that are not of World Cup level have taken place in 1998, 2001, 2005, and 2010. The ski resort continues to be a popular alpine skiing and snowboarding attraction and is the only venue of the 1960 Games still in use as of 2010.\nAs of 2016, three buildings from the 1960 Winter Olympics remain in Palisades Tahoe. An expansion of the resort's village, currently in the planning stages, would see two of these buildings demolished."

        "text": "For the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, a total of nine sports venues were used. Calgary tried twice to host the Winter Olympics in the 1960s without success before finally winning the 1988 Winter Games in 1981. Stampede Corral was built in 1950 while McMahon Stadium was built in 1960. When the National Hockey League (NHL) Flames franchise was relocated from Atlanta, Georgia in the United States during the summer of 1980, a new arena was needed. The Saddledome construction was underway in late 1981 when Calgary was awarded the 1988 Games. Completed in 1983, the Olympic (Scotiabank since October 2010) Saddledome has played host to the Flames ever since, including three Stanley Cup Finals (championship in 1989) and the NHL All-Star Game in 1985. An innovation for the games was the first indoor long-track speed skating venue which has served as a model for future Olympics. The bobsleigh and luge track was the first combination track in North America and was noted for the Jamaican bobsleigh team crash during the four-man event. Both the Oval and the bobsleigh/luge (now bobsleigh/luge/skeleton) track continue to host the World Championships in their respective sports since the 1988 Winter Olympics.\nBefore the Olympics.\nStampede Corral was constructed in 1950, hosting the Calgary Stampeders ice hockey team from 1950 until they went out of business in 1972, then played again in 1978–79 under five different minor hockey leagues. Following the 1979–80 National Hockey League (NHL) season, the Flames franchise moved from their original founding at Atlanta in the United States to Calgary. The first place the Flames relocated to in Calgary as a venue was Stampede Corral which they used from the 1980–81 to the 1982–83 NHL seasons. After that, the Flames moved to the Olympic Saddledome (Scotiabank Saddledome since October 2010) for the 1983–84 NHL season where they remain as of 2019. The Corral hosted the World Figure Skating Championships in 1972 and continues to be of use for the annual Calgary Stampede rodeo events.\nThe Canadian Football League (CFL) Calgary Stampeders moved into McMahon Stadium in 1960. In 1975, McMahon Stadium hosted the Grey Cup where the Edmonton Eskimos defeated the Montreal Alouettes 9–8.\nCalgary first bid for the Winter Olympics was in 1959 for the 1964 Games, losing to Innsbruck. Their second Winter Olympic bid attempt was for the 1968 Winter Olympics, losing to Grenoble by three votes in 1964. The third time was the charm for Calgary in 1981 when they were awarded the 1988 Winter Olympics over Falun, Sweden and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy.\nIt was Bill Pratt, the former contractor who took over as Calgary Organizing Committee president in 1983, and who supervised the enormous construction project. Says Donald Jacques, general manager of the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede: “Because of him, everything was built on time and on budget.” But Pratt rubbed many colleagues the wrong way. As a former co-worker predicted in 1983: “He will get everything built. There may not be many left around to enjoy it, but he’ll get it done.” \nThe Saddledome was under construction in 1981 when Calgary was awarded the 1988 Games. At its 1983 completion, the first sporting event held was on 15 October against the Edmonton Oilers. The 1985 NHL All-Star Game took place at the Saddledome. The Flames lost the 1986 Stanley Cup Finals to the Montreal Canadiens in five games of which three were played at the Saddledome while two were played at the Montreal Forum, a 1976 Summer Olympic venue.\nCanmore's construction ran from 1983 to 1986. Canada Olympic Park was constructed between 1984 and 1986. The Olympic Oval's construction was modeled on the Olympic Oval used for the 1932 and 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York in the United States. There would be one exception with this being domed, a first for speed skating provided Olympic organizers received approval from the International Skating Union (ISU). The ISU approved this and construction of the first indoor long-track speed skating venue ran from 1985 to 1987. Father David Bauer Arena was constructed between 1985 and 1987. Naskiska was constructed between 1983 and 1987. Max Bell Arena had its facilities renovated for the 1988 Winter Olympics though no stated timeframe was given in the official Olympic report.\nPrior to being selected by the Canadian Olympic Committee as Canada's official bid, CODA sought to put the bobsled track in Spray Valley Provincial Park, however when consulted former Canadian gold medalist Vic Emery noted the spot was too steep. The conversation took place during a September 1979 site investigation by COC while at the mountain, and Frank King CODA's chairman quickly selected a gentler hill next to the original location.\nDuring the Olympics.\nAt the Oval, every speed skating event had an Olympic Record and all but three of those events had World Records set during those games. At the bobsleigh and luge track, East German bobsledder Wolfgang Hoppe complained about the track's condition during the two-man event, stating that it was like \"running on sandpaper\", especially during the event's second run. The bobsleigh four-man event was highlighted during the third run when the Jamaican bobsleigh team crashed after exiting the Kriesel turn, sliding all the way down the rest of the track. Jamaica did not compete in the fourth run as a result. In women's singles luge, the final two runs were delayed a day to heavy winds.\nWeather delays forced the individual Nordic combined event to be held on a single day on the last day of the Winter Olympics. East German biathlete Jürgen Wirth had test fired in windy conditions before the start of the 4 × 7.5 km relay. At the time of the relay, leadoff skier Wirth had not adjusted his rifle sight to the winds having died down. He missed three of his first five shots, dropping the East German team to 12th place with a deficit of almost two minutes after the first exchange. East Germany would win the silver medal in the event, finishing 1:07.4 behind the Soviet Union.\nAfter the Olympics.\nThe Saddledome continue to play host the Flames, and witnessed two more Stanley Cup Finals with a win over Montreal in 1989 and a loss to the Tampa Bay Lightning fifteen years later. In 1995, the Saddledome underwent renovations in time to reopen for the 1995–96 NHL season. Reba McEntire gave the first concert held at the Saddledome later that year following the renovations.\nThe Oval has played host for the World Speed Skating Championships on eleven occasions since the Games. This included the Allround in 1990 (women), 1992 (men), 2006,\n2011, and 2015; the Sprint in 1994, 1999, 2003, 2012, and 2017; and the Single Distance in 1998.\nThe bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton track (Skeleton was added in the early 1990s) have hosted the FIBT World Championships in 1992 (skeleton), 1996 (skeleton), 2001 (women's bobsleigh, men's and women's skeleton), and 2005. It hosted the FIL World Luge Championships in 1990, 1993, and 2001.\nSki jumping has taken place at Canada Olympic Park though the last recorded competition was in 2003. Freestyle skiing took place in 1989 and 1990, but was restarted in 2009 and 2010. Nordic combined's last event in the Calgary area took place in 2002 and it was a mass start event. Canmore Nordic Centre has hosted cross-country skiing events since 1995, including the last cross-country events before the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver the weekend before those Games began. The last biathlon events that took place at Canmore was in February 2016.\nMcMahon Stadium hosted the Grey Cup in 1993, 2000, 2009, and 2019"

        "text": "Sheffield United Cricket Club is the first sports club or association in England to bear the word, ’United’ in its name, common amongst association football clubs in England today. Sheffield United Cricket Club was formed in 1854, by several local cricket clubs in Sheffield uniting, thus the name. The inclusion of ‘United’ in the name also distinguished it from the existing and longer-established Sheffield Cricket Club (circa 1751).\nIn 1854, M. J. Ellison, agent for the Duke of Norfolk, sought to establish a cricket ground in Sheffield. A piece of land was leased from the Duke of Norfolk. Local clubs were brought together as ‘Sheffield United Cricket Club’ to manage and play on the ground to be built on the land, with Ellison as President. The ground that was built on the land was completed in 1855, and called Bramall Lane. Sheffield United Cricket Club was a management committee, but did not have a team playing in that name until 1895.\nThe cricket clubs shared Bramall Lane with Sheffield FC, the world's oldest association football club, between 1862 and 1875, and with The Wednesday from 1880 to 1887. In 1889, the management committee decided to form a football club to replace Sheffield Wednesday, who had departed Bramall Lane in a dispute over gate receipts. Bearing the same name, Sheffield United FC was formed, not only to keep the cricket players together during the winter close season, but to generate the lost revenue following Wednesday's exit.\nSheffield United Cricket Club won its first trophy in 1896, the Sheffield Challenge Cup against Kilnhurst. In 1900, the club was a founder member of the Yorkshire League.\nThe cricket club left Bramall Lane in 1973. \nSheffield United Cricket Club currently has 3 teams in the South Yorkshire Cricket League, one Sunday XI in the Barnsley Cricket League and Junior Teams at U9, U11, U13, U15 and U18 age groups that play in the Ben Jessop Sheffield and District Junior League. Sheffield United Cricket club play on their own ground leased from Sheffield Hallam University and based within Sheffield Hallam University Sports Park, Bawtry Road, Tinsley, Sheffield."

Football in American Samoa is generally played by the same rules as in the United States. As of 2010, the island has produced twenty-eight players who have played in the NFL; this number that has increased each year.\nHistory.\nEvery year the number of high school graduates from American Samoa who go to play college football increases. In the recent past, the University of Hawaii was one of the only colleges that recruited players from American Samoa, with few exceptions. Today, schools such as BYU, Arizona, Wisconsin, USC, Stanford, Western Kentucky, UCLA, Cal, Texas Tech, Nevada, Tennessee-Chattanooga, and Washington send assistants to clinics that are held annually on the island. There are several obstacles that discourage coaches from recruiting in American Samoa, primarily the remote location and expenses incurred. Another is that the majority of the American Samoan athletes struggle to meet the NCAA academic standards, due to localization issues such as language barriers, access to mainland education, and means of affordability."

        "text": "John Guy Giberne Birkett (27 December 1884 – 16 October 1967) was an English international rugby union player who played for England between 1906 and 1912, and also captained the side on more than one occasion. He also has the distinction of scoring the first ever try at Twickenham Stadium, echoing the feat of his father who in 1871, in the first ever international rugby match scored England's first ever try.\nEarly life.\nJohn Guy Giberne Birkett was born in Richmond, Surrey on 27 December 1884. He was the son of Lizette Crunden and Reg Birkett. His father had played for England as an association footballer as well as playing in England's first international rugby match in 1871. He had an older brother, Gerald (born 1883), and his uncle was another rugby international, Louis Birkett. John attended Haileybury and Imperial Service College.\nRugby career.\nBirkett initially regarded himself as a half-back. After attending the trials for Harlequins in 1905 on Wandsworth Common he was selected for the team. At the time, the Harlequins talisman, Adrian Stoop, was beginning to implement a change in the way in which back play was structured and which itself would become the template for how rugby union backlines are organised today. Stoop wanted to see the ball moved quickly across the three-quarters and out to the wings, for a quicker style of play. The ball would leave the forwards via a position Stoop termed the scrum-half and then outward to the wings. Stoop saw in Birkett the ideal build and skills needed for a centre in this new format, and this became Birkett's position for the rest of his career. Birkett came into the England side in 1906 after England had suffered a seven match losing run. Playing Scotland at Inverleith, Birkett took up his position at centre and with Stoop also in the side as half-back the first glimmers of the new back play were seen at international level. In this match England overcame Scotland, putting an end to their losing streak and seeing tries scored on both wings. Five days later in Paris, Birkett was involved in the first England-France match, again a win for England. Birkett became a regular in the England side and in 1908 captained the side to a defeat against Wales in Bristol. He lost the captaincy but kept his place and in the 1910 and 1911 Five Nations Championships he was captain on four consecutive occasions. The 1910 championship was also one in which England became the first Five Nations champions, and Birkett scored twice in the match against Scotland. During his international career he played 21 times for England, and at the time of his final match in Paris this was England's record cap holder. He was also the record try scorer with ten. Ironically, he never captained his club-side. However, he never lost his place in the Harlequins side and was part of the generation that witnessed the move to the new Twickenham Stadium. He played in the inaugural match on 2 October 1909, at what is now the home of English rugby. In this match he had the distinction of scoring the first try at the new stadium, echoing his father's distinction of having scored England's first ever try in 1871.\nCareer and later life.\nIn World War One he was a captain in the Royal Field Artillery and was mentioned in dispatches 18 times. He was also decorated with the Order of the Crown of Italy, 5th Class (Knight). In 1915 he married Elsie Allen in Chertsey. They had a son, John Brian who was born on 2 October 1916 and who would later become a brigadier and serve in the Second World War. John Birkett died on 16 October 1967, which was registered in Cuckfield."

Joe Kinnear's men maintained their reputation as one of the hardest Premiership sides to beat, and finished above many big-spending, well-supported clubs including Arsenal, Chelsea, Sheffield Wednesday and Everton.\nWimbledon's need to sell their biggest assets was highlighted in the close season when they sold full-back Warren Barton to Newcastle United for £4 million - the most expensive defender signed by any British club. However, many of their other key assets - Dean Holdsworth, Robbie Earle and Hans Segers included - were retained for the new season to give Dons fans hope of another season giving the big boys a run for their money.\nEarly in the season, long-serving striker John Fashanu departed to Aston Villa for £1.35 million, only to retire at the end of the campaign. In Fashanu's place, Wimbledon bought Efan Ekoku from Norwich City; he was the club's leading goalscorer with nine league goals.\nKit.\nWimbledon signed no kit manufacturing deal for the season's kit, instead producing them under their own brand. Birmingham-based electronics company Elonex became the kit sponsors.\nResults.\n\"Wimbledon's score comes first\""

The school with the most all-time honorees is North Carolina A&amp;T, now a member of the Big South Conference, which has had nine winners, but its last award before its 2021 departure was in 1988. Among current members, Coppin State and Norfolk State have the most recipients with eight each. The only current member of the MEAC without a winner is Maryland Eastern Shore.\nWinners by school.\nIn this table, \"year joined\" reflects the calendar year in which each school joined the conference, and years of departure for former members indicated in footnotes reflect the calendar year of departure.

Consequently, the International Olympic Committee revoked the Indonesia's membership and barred it from participating in the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. The Games and related infrastructure development projects in Jakarta were heavily funded by the Soviet Union and were given \"top priority\" by the then-President of Indonesia, Sukarno.\nMedal table.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

Elwood, the winning horse, was owned by Lasca Durnell which marked the first time a female owner won the Derby. The winner was bred by Emma Holt Prather of Faustiana Stock Farm in Nodaway County, Missouri and was the first time a Derby winner was bred by a woman. In addition, Elwood was the first winner bred in the state of Missouri and through 2020 no other winner has been bred in that state."

        "text": "George Leo Connor (January 21, 1925 – March 31, 2003) was an American football player for the Chicago Bears of the National Football League (NFL) from 1948 to 1955. He played offensive tackle on offense, and on defense was recognized as one of the sport's first linebackers. He is a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame and of the College Football Hall of Fame. He attended both the College of the Holy Cross and the University of Notre Dame. He won the first Outland Trophy as the best college lineman in 1946. Sportswriter Grantland Rice once observed Connor was \"the closest thing to a Greek God since Apollo\".\nEarly life and college.\nConnor was born in Chicago, and was not expected to survive infancy, weighing only three pounds at his premature birth. He played two years of college football at Holy Cross and was a second-team All-America selection by the Associated Press in 1943. He then served in the United States Navy during World War II. After the war, Connor was drafted in the first round, fifth overall by the New York Giants in 1946, but instead transferred to the University of Notre Dame to be closer to his ill father. He was twice a consensus All-American as a tackle for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team, in 1946 and 1947. He won the first Outland Trophy as the nation's best college interior lineman in 1946. Connor was a key component of Notre Dame's 1946 and 1947 national championship teams, and was the captain of the unbeaten 1947 team.\nProfessional career.\nAfter graduating, Connor received an offer from the Cleveland Browns of the All-America Football Conference, but chose to sign with his hometown Chicago Bears in 1948 for $13,000 a year guaranteed for three years, a high salary at the time for a lineman. He played for the Bears from 1948 through 1955. In eight seasons, he was named a first-team All-Pro five times, and was an invitee to the first four Pro Bowls. At first exclusively a tackle on defense, in a game in 1949 Bears head coach George Halas ordered Connor to stand upright outside the end in an attempt to thwart the running of Philadelphia Eagles halfback Steve Van Buren. The plan worked, as Connor held Van Buren in check and the Bears handed the Eagles their only loss of the season. \"We always set high standards for George Connor and he exceeded them,\" said Halas. He became one of the first big, mobile linebackers in the NFL. Connor retired during training camp in 1956, still bothered by a knee injury sustained in 1954.\nHonors and later life.\nIn 1963, Connor was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. He was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame with the class of 1975. He is a member of the National Football League 1940s All-Decade Team, selected by the Pro Football Hall of Fame committee in 1969 to honor the best players of the 1940s.\nFor several years Connor was a color commentator on CBS telecasts of NFL games, often working with lead announcer Jack Drees.\nConnor worked as a manufacturers' representative in Chicago after his retirement from the NFL. He died in Evanston, Illinois on March 31, 2003, aged 78 after a long illness."

England began badly, falling to 38/2, before Mike Brearley (53 from 115 balls, 3 fours) and Graham Gooch (71 from 84 balls, 1 four, 3 sixes) resurrected the innings. Derek Randall (42 from 50 balls, 1 four, 1 six) played well in the second half of the innings, as England recovered from 98/4 to post 221 (8 wickets, 60 overs). In the response, John Wright (69 from 137 balls) attacked well in the beginning. However, the loss of wickets bogged New Zealand down, and despite several late flourishes in the batting order, New Zealand started to drop behind. When New Zealand could not achieve the remaining 14 runs from the last over of the match, England went into the final.\nWest Indies vs Pakistan.\nGordon Greenidge (73 from 107 balls, 5 fours, 1 six) and Desmond Haynes (65 from 115 balls, 4 fours) set a first wicket partnership of 132 runs in a match dominated by batting. Vivian Richards and Clive Lloyd also contributed solidly, as West Indies ran up 293 (6 wickets, 60 overs) against Pakistan. Majid Khan (81 from 124 balls, 7 fours) and Zaheer Abbas (93 from 122 balls) shared a second-wicket partnership of 166 runs in 36 overs in the response. However, none of the other Pakistani batsmen flourished, with Javed Miandad being bowled for a duck first ball, and Pakistan lost 9/74, beginning with the dismissal of Abbas. Pakistan was bowled all out for 250 (all out, 56.2 overs) in the high-scoring semifinal, sending the West Indies to the final.\nFinal.\nEngland won the toss and chose to field first. The West Indies got off to a bad start, falling to 99/4 with the loss of Greenidge, Haynes, Kallicharan, and captain Clive Lloyd. However, Vivian Richards (138 from 157 balls, 11 fours, 3 sixes) and Collis King (86 from 66 balls, 10 fours, 3 sixes) consolidated the innings. King especially ripped through the English bowling, with a strike rate of 130.3. The West Indies were already at 5/238 when the 139 run partnership ended with the loss of Collis King. Vivian Richards and the tail then took the West Indies to a very imposing total of 286 (9 wickets, 60 overs).\nThe English batsmen got off to a good start. But the openers, Mike Brearley (64 from 130 balls, 7 fours) and Geoff Boycott (57 from 105 balls, 3 fours) scored very slowly. They put together a very methodical opening partnership of 129 runs in 38 overs, playing as if the match were a five-day Test. By the time both batsmen were out, the run rate had risen too high. Graham Gooch played some hefty strokes in scoring his 32, taking England to 183/2. However, the loss of Gooch triggered the most devastating collapse in World Cup history, as England lost 8/11. They were eventually all out for 194 in 51 overs.\nVivian Richards was declared Man of the Match."

        "text": "For the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia (now Bosnia and Herzegovina), a total of nine sports venues were used. The idea for the Games came around from a 1968 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development study on promoting winter tourism in Yugoslavia. After Sarajevo was awarded the 1984 Games in 1978, venue construction and renovation took place between 1979 and 1983. Weather postponed the men's downhill alpine skiing event three times before it was finally run. The men's cross-country skiing 30 km event was run during a blizzard. After the games, all but one of the venues were damaged during the Bosnian War and the siege of Sarajevo. After the war, Zetra Ice Hall was rebuilt and is in use as of 2010.\nBefore the Olympics.\nDuring the reign of the Ottoman Empire, Sarajevo was a popular venue for the forerunner of luge. When the Austro-Hungarian Empire controlled Sarajevo, modern luge, skating, and skiing was introduced. Between the first and second World Wars, ski jumps and a mountain lodge were constructed along with the first Yugoslav ski rally at Jahorina in 1937. After World War II, Jahorina in Sarajevo hosted the International Students Winter Week in 1955, a forerunner to the Winter Universiade that would start five years later in Chamonix, France. A 1968 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development study on developing winter tourism in Yugoslavia would serve as a catalyst for a bid for the Winter Olympics. Sarajevo made their bid for the 1984 Winter Games in late 1976 and were awarded the 1984 Games in May 1978. Koševo Stadium which was used for the opening ceremonies was constructed in 1952, renovated in 1966, and renovated again in 1983 in time for the 1984 Winter Olympics. Skenderija II was constructed in 1969. Design and construction for new and existing facilities took place between 1979 and 1983 though a majority of the venues were built completely by 1981.\nYugoslavia hosted the World Ice Hockey Championships in 1966 though those championships took place in Ljubljana (now in Slovenia). Sarajevo had its first FIS Alpine Skiing World Cup event in 1975 with a women's giant slalom event.\nDuring the Olympics.\nAt the Zetra Ice Rink during practice for the ice dance event the morning before the free dance final, Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean of Great Britain arrived early to prepare. At the end of their routine, they were met with applause from the 20 to 30 venue workers who were cleaning the seats and had stopped working to watch Torvill and Dean practice.\nWeather postponed the men's downhill three times before it was run finally. Bill Johnson of the United States won the event. Nikolay Zimyatov of the Soviet Union won the 30 km cross-country skiing event that took place in a blizzard.\nAfter the Olympics.\nSarajevo hosted an Alpine Skiing World Cup in March 1987 won by Luxembourg's Marc Girardelli for the men's giant slalom and a tie between Swiss skiers Maria Walliser and Vreni Schneider for the women's giant slalom. The Zetra Ice Hall played host to the European Figure Skating Championships in 1987. Before the Yugoslav Wars of 1991, the last major winter sports event before the breakup of Yugoslavia was the European Speed Skating Championships that year.\nFrom 1991 to 1995, the Yugoslav Wars took place that involved independent movements in Bosnia, Croatia, and Slovenia, occurring in 1992–95, 1991–95, and 1991 respectively. The Bosnian War that lasted from 1992 to 1995 that included the siege of Sarajevo which itself lasted from 1992 to 1996. At the early part of the war and the siege, the bobsleigh and luge track was transformed into a field artillery position for Bosnian Serb guerillas, the men's alpine skiing venue was a Bosnian Serb military installation, and the Zetra Ice Hall was reduced to rubble. During the closing ceremonies of the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch remarked about Sarajevo's situation and the concern for global athletes to assist in the conflict.\nAfter the Bosnian War and the siege of Sarajevo, Zetra Ice Hall (now known as Olympic Hall Juan Antonio Samaranch) was rebuilt in 1997 and reopened in 1999. The Jahorina ski resort area where women's alpine skiing took place was the only venue unaffected by the war. There was hope that Sarajevo would bid for the 2010 Winter Olympics in a sign they had recovered, but the city did not make the finalist list for those Games."

        "title": "Cherry picking (basketball)",
        "text": "Cherry picking, in basketball and certain other sports, refers to play where one player (the cherry picker) does not play defense with the rest of the team, but rather remains near half court or closer to their own team's goal.\nIf the opponents do not designate a player to stay near the cherry picker, they will have a 5-on-4 advantage as they try to score, but if the defense steals the ball, it could make a long pass to the cherry picker for an uncontested basket. Acquiring the ball by a violation or foul, or after a made basket, the cherry picker is less relevant, as the opponents have more time to put their own defense in place.\nDisapproval of cherry picking stems from the fact that the cherry picker is not playing the \"complete\" game and accumulates statistics for points scored that exaggerate the player's prowess.\nLegality.\nCherry picking is uncommon but legal in organized basketball. In some amateur leagues, cherry picking—defined as a defender remaining in the opponents' backcourt after the opponents have advanced the ball to their forecourt—is a violation, penalized by loss of possession and of any resulting points.\nMethods.\nThe cherry picker may \"camp out\", remaining on the player's offensive end to wait for a teammate to obtain the ball and pass it to the cherry picker for a shot before the defense can get back (as is also the case in the fast break).\nAnother method is \"bolting\" or \"breaking\" toward the other goal the moment the opponents launch a shot, without waiting to see the outcome of the shot. If the shot fails and the defense gets the rebound, the cherry picker can be positioned to receive a long pass and take an unguarded shot. Even after a made shot, the team that was on defense may signal for one or more players to run toward the other basket so as to enable one or more passes toward the goal before the opponents can set up their defense.\nOther uses.\nCherry picking is also a strategy in videogames that simulate basketball.\nAnalogs to cherry picking exist in other sports:\nThe term also refers to \"picking\" a rebound above the rim, a practice that may be a goaltending violation."

        "text": "The 2011–12 Butler Bulldogs men's basketball team represented Butler University in the 2011–12 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. Their head coach was Brad Stevens, serving his 5th year. The Bulldogs played their home games at Hinkle Fieldhouse, which has a capacity of approximately 10,000 and a playing floor that was renovated during the summer of 2011. This was Butler's last season competing in the Horizon League.\nIn each of the previous two seasons, the Bulldogs reached the NCAA championship game after winning the Horizon League regular season, and Butler was the favorite to win the Horizon League for a sixth consecutive season in spite of losing senior and four-year starter Matt Howard to graduation and junior Shelvin Mack to the NBA draft. Analyst Jeff Borzello of CBS Sports explained \"Butler loses a lot of talent from last season, but it's still tough to choose against the Bulldogs.\" The Bulldogs add Roosevelt Jones, a three-star recruit ranked in the 2011 Rivals 150 and the 33rd best freshman small forward in the nation, and also add Australian guard Jackson Aldridge, who \"drew rave reviews playing in the U-19 world championships.\" Further, the Bulldogs add Kameron Woods, a two-star recruit and the 62nd best power forward in the nation according to ESPN.com. The final member of the recruit class is Andy Smeathers, a \"local kid who knows how to make shots.\"\nRoster.\nSource: 2011–12 Butler Men's Basketball Roster\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#13294B; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#13294B; color:#FFFFFF;\" | Non-Conference Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#13294B; color:#FFFFFF;\" | Horizon League Play\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#13294B; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Horizon League tournament\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#13294B; color:#FFFFFF;\"|College Basketball Invitational\nSource: 2011–12 Butler Bulldogs men's basketball schedule\nPreseason.\nPreseason game capsules.\n11/2 – Butler vs Northern State&lt;br&gt;\nButler Falls On Buzzer-Beater&lt;br&gt;\nSenior guard Alex Thomas nailed a three-point field goal at the buzzer to cap a 12–0 closing run and lift visiting Northern State to a 53–50 victory over Butler in an exhibition game at Hinkle Fieldhouse on Wednesday, Nov. 2. The game was Butler's first test against outside competition. The Wolves battled back from a 50–41 deficit in the final four minutes. A steal and layup by Seth Bachand and a conventional three-point play by Trent Zomer cut the margin to 50–46 with 2:56 left. Forward Collin Pryor followed with back-to-back baskets to tie the game at 50–50 with 0:52 left. Butler's Andrew Smith, who led all scorers with 19 points missed the front end of a one-and-one free throw situation with 0:38 left, setting up the final play. Following a timeout, Northern State held the ball for a final shot and Thomas delivered from the top of the key as the final buzzer sounded.\n11/4 – Butler vs Franklin&lt;br&gt;\nButler Rolls Past Franklin In Exhibition Tilt&lt;br&gt;\nJunior Andrew Smith led four players in double-figures with 19 points in 17 minutes and Butler pulled away to a 91–53 victory over visiting Franklin in an exhibition game at Hinkle Fieldhouse on Saturday, Nov. 5. The game was Butler's final preseason test. Smith, who also led Butler with 19 points in a 53–50 loss to Northern State three days earlier, hit seven of nine shots in his brief stint, including one of two from beyond the three-point arc. The 6–11 center was perfect on four free throw attempts, and he added three assists. There was plenty of support for the Butler scoring leader. Junior Chase Stigall (below left) hit four of six shots from three-point range and finished with 14 points, while freshman Andrew Smeathers came off the bench and hit three of five three-pointers and finished with 11 points. Freshman guard Jackson Aldridge had 10 points in a reserve stint.\nRegular season.\n11/12 – Butler at Evansville&lt;br&gt;\nButler Falls In Overtime At Evansville&lt;br&gt;\nJunior Colt Ryan tied the game with a free throw in regulation and then scored his team's final six points in overtime to lift host Evansville to an 80–77 overtime victory over Butler in the season-opener for both teams at the new Ford Center on Saturday, Nov. 12. Between Ryan's clutch points, the game took a bizarre twist. Butler led 69–68 with Evansville in possession and 0:15 remaining. The Aces' Ned Cox missed a jump shot with 0:07 remaining and there was a loose ball scramble for the rebound. Butler's Jackson Aldridge was whistled for a foul with 0:00.9 left, sending Ryan to the line. The Evansville scoring leader missed the first free throw, but made the second to tie the game. Butler's Emerson Kampen then threw a full-court pass to center Andrew Smith, who caught the ball and laid it in at the buzzer for an apparent game-winning shot. The game officials huddled, and claimed a foul was called before the shot, sending Smith to the free throw line with 0:00.2 left. Smith missed both shots, forcing the overtime period.\n11/15 – Butler vs Chattanooga&lt;br&gt;\nBulldogs Win Home-Opener&lt;br&gt;\nJunior Andrew Smith recorded his second career double-double and Butler used a staunch defensive effort to dispatch visiting Chattanooga, 57–46, in the Bulldogs' 2011–12 home-opener at Hinkle Fieldhouse on Tuesday, Nov. 15. The game was Butler's first in the five-team Hoosier Invitational. Smith (below), a 6–11 center, led both teams with 16 points, hitting five of eight shots from the field and five of seven from the free throw line. He also led both teams with 10 rebounds, one off his career-high. His performance followed a 21-point effort in Butler's tough season-opening double-overtime loss at Evansville. But it was Butler's defensive effort that claimed the spotlight. The Bulldogs limited Chattanooga (0–2), a team favored in the Southern Conference, to just 19 points in the second half. The Mocs scored just six points in the final 13 minutes of the contest.\n11/19 – Butler vs #8/7 Louisville&lt;br&gt;\nSecond Half Lifts No. 7 Louisville Past Butler&lt;br&gt;\nSeniors Kyle Kuric and Chris Smith combined for 32 points and sparked a late second half run that lifted No. 7 Louisville to a 69–53 victory over Butler at Hinkle Fieldhouse on Saturday, Nov. 19. The win boosted the Cardinals to 3–0 on the season, while Butler fell to 1–2. Butler held a 41–40 advantage with 12 minutes remaining, when Kuric and Smith ignited a decisive 16–4 run. Kuric scored 10 points in the six-minute run, while Smith added the other six to give the Cardinals a 56–45 advantage. Butler never got closer than nine points in the final six minutes."

        "title": "Mark Hylton (darts player)",
        "text": "Mark Hylton (born 30 May 1966 from Rugeley) is a former English professional darts player. He played in Professional Darts Corporation events.\nCareer.\nHylton has played darts for over 30 years. He has played super league for many years and earned over 80 caps for Staffordshire.\nIn 1997, he reached the last 16 of the inaugural British Classic (losing to Phil Taylor). In 2005, he was the Staffordshire qualifier for the World Championship play-offs as well as the Winmau World Masters and the English national singles, where he reached the last 16 again.\nHylton's first televised appearance came as an amateur qualifier at the 2007 UK Open. He defeated Ray Carver on the stage in the preliminary round before losing to Mark Robinson in the first round.\nHe joined the PDC circuit full-time in 2010. Despite failing to qualify for that year's UK Open, he reached the final of a PDC Pro Tour event in Australia, losing to Dennis Priestley, and has regularly featured in the last 16 places. Alongside his PDC efforts, Hylton has won 13 open competitions in 2010, including the Border Classic.\nHylton qualified for the 2010 Grand Slam of Darts, winning through a strong field of over 250 darters, as one of four ITV Wildcard qualifiers. He lost all three of his group games to Gary Anderson, Mark Webster, and Wayne Jones.\nHylton also qualified for his first PDC World Championship in 2011 as one of the top 16 non-seeded players from the Players Championship Order of Merit. In the first round, Hylton defeated Steve Beaton by 3 sets to 2. In the second round, he knocked out number 9 seed Colin Lloyd by 4 sets to 2. He was eliminated by Mark Webster in the third round. These strong TV performances along with Hylton's strong second half of the season also earned him the 2010 PDC Best Newcomer award.\n2011 has seen a strong start with Hylton taking several open titles including The Double16.com Cotgrave &amp; Newark Opens during the 2nd of which he produced a perfect 9 dart leg, only 6 days later he produced another 9 dart finish during an Open event at The Red Lion in Erdington. A first professional appearance in The UK Open in June will be a 3rd TV Major in 8 months. He is climbing the Orders of Merit strongly looking to be well placed for the 2011/12 season.\nDuring May &amp; June 2011 Hylton produced another fine spell of form, he reached Pro tour Quarter and Semi finals on consecutive days in Austria and a run of five wins (over Brian Woods, Geoff Whitworth, Andy Jenkins, Andrew Gilding &amp; Peter Wright) at The UK Open saw 'Mile High' reach his first televised Quarter final at a major event, eventually losing out in a tough match again Denis Ovens.\nThis form continued with a semi-final Pro Tour place in Barnsley, defeating Beaton, Ovens, Baxter, Van Gerwen &amp; Duo before losing out to lakeside runner up Dave Chisnal. This ensured his place in the 2011 World Matchplay where he faced Phil Taylor in the first round, narrowly losing by 10 legs to 8.\nHis rapid rise through the ranking continued with qualification for The 2011 World Grand Prix where despite suffering from the flu he again reached the Qtr final. A two sets to one win over Mark Walsh in round one followed by a second round 3–1 win over world number 5 Simon Whitlock, set up a clash with the resurgent Richie Burnett. Hylton bowed out 1–4 with Burnett going on to a 5–2 defeat to Phil Taylor.\nIn a break from previous pattern Hylton took his form straight back to PDC Pro Tour events where he reached semi and quarter-finals over the next two events. His wins over Wayne Jones and a 6-0 whitewash of Paul Nicholson offer signs of a new confidence.\nHe was defeated in the first round of the 2012 World Championships by Vincent van der Voort 2–3. Hylton lost 7–9 in the last 32 of the 2012 UK Open to Jamie Caven. On the 2012 Pro Tour, his best results were quarter-final defeats in the UK Open Qualifier 8 (4–6 to Joe Cullen) and the 10th Players Championship (4–6 to Andy Hamilton). His results were not enough to see him qualify for the 2013 World Championship through the Pro Tour Order of Merit so he played in the Qualifier and lost in the last 16 to Stuart Kellett. After the World Championship Hylton was ranked world number 37.\nHylton failed to qualify for the 2013 UK Open as he finished 115th on the Order of Merit, outside of the top 96 who claimed their places. He played the full schedule of PDC events but only reached the last 32 of one tournament where he lost 6–3 to Kim Huybrechts. Hylton finished a lowly 114th on the ProTour Order of Merit having earned £2,400 in prize money during the whole year. He dropped 48 places on the main Order of Merit during the year to start 2014 as world number 85, outside the top 64 who retain their professional status. Hylton entered Q School in an attempt to win his place back and came closest to doing so on the first day when he was beaten 5–4 by Joey ten Berge in the last 16. However, after all four days had been completed he had not won enough games to qualify through the Order of Merit and just had PDPA Associate Member status for 2014 which enabled him to play in all UK Open and European Tour qualifiers as well as the Challenge Tour. Hylton qualified for the UK Open but lost 5–1 to Dennis Smith in the first round. He played in 10 of the 16 Challenge Tour tournaments, reaching the semi-finals of the 11th event where he was defeated 5–4 by Mark Frost.\nHylton was knocked out in the quarter-finals of two Challenge Tour events in 2015 and got to the semi-finals of the fifth event in 2016 and lost 5–2 to Nick Fullwell.\nHylton Quit on the PDC in 2017.\nPersonal life.\nHylton worked as an airline cabin manager for 14 years before taking redundancy and becoming a professional darts player in 2010. He graduated from Wrexham University in 1987 as a BA in English Literature.\nHylton‘s son is professional comedian Alex Hylton, who won ‘Best Show’ at Leicester Comedy Festival in 2020.\nHylton supports Sky Bet Championship football club Stoke City. He also played cricket at an amateur level as a teenager."

        "text": "The United Baseball League, also known simply as the United League (UL), was a planned third major league that was formed in 1994, but folded in 1996 without playing a game.\nFormation.\nFirst announced on November 1, 1994, the UL founders were Bob Mrazek, a former five-term Congressman from Long Island; John Bryant, a Congressman from Dallas; Richard Moss, a player agent, and Andrew Zimbalist, an economist at Smith College. The UL originally planned to have ten teams, eight in the U.S. and one each in Canada and Mexico.\nBy August 1995, the league introduced former Texas Rangers president Mike Stone as its CEO, and former star Curt Flood as its commissioner. \"We need an alternative league,\" Flood said. \"America deserves an alternative league. I wish there was one when I played. Baseball's owners have shut me out for 25 years.\" Eight franchises were announced, seven in the U.S. and one in Canada.\nFurther developments.\nThe league also announced a twenty-year TV contract with Liberty Sports and a 154-game schedule to begin March 28, 1996. Co-founder Richard Moss said the plan was for the UL to expand to 16 teams, including Japan and Korea, within three years.\nMike Casey, identified as the owner of the New Orleans franchise, announced former big-leaguer Paul Blair would be the club's assistant general manager. Casey's son-in-law, former Boston Red Sox pitching prospect Ed Riley, became the first signing for the proposed club; later, reports indicated the team had offered the disgraced Pete Rose $500,000 a year to serve as its manager.\nBy December 1995, Dick Moss announced that the league had been put off until 1997. (By January 1996, Casey's franchise was apparently located not in New Orleans but in Worcester, Massachusetts; Riley turned up in the \"transactions\" column of sports pages nationwide as being acquired by the Albany-Colonie Diamond Dogs of the Northeast League \"from Worcester of the United Baseball League\".) In late January 1996, Casey identified the UL's eight teams as Washington, Orlando, Bridgeport, Connecticut and his Worcester club in the Northern Division, with Los Angeles, San Juan, New Orleans and Austin, Texas in the Southern Division. Finally, on April 12, 1996, the league ceased operations, citing stadium problems. Also, Liberty Sports had merged with the Fox Television Network, who promptly announced a deal with Major League Baseball starting in 1997."

The top 24 men's and women's teams from the 2010 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships were allowed to send a full team of gymnasts. The top 8 men's and women's teams directly qualified for the team events at the 2012 Olympics. Teams placed 9th to 16th got a second chance to qualify a full team at the Olympic Test Event on January 10–18, 2012, from which four men's and women's teams qualified.\nIndividuals.\nThe winners of gold, silver and bronze medals in each apparatus qualified for the Olympics, either as individuals or as members of their national team.

The top 8 teams qualified to the final.\nIn the final round, held on October 11, only 3 gymnasts performed on each apparatus, and all the scores counted. The United States team won the gold medal with solid performances by all gymnasts on all apparatus, while the Russian team made several mistakes and finished a distant second. China narrowly beat Romania to win the bronze medal, followed by Great Britain in fifth place. This was the highest ranking finish Great Britain had ever had for a team at a World Championship.\nOldest and youngest competitors\nDuring the presentation of medals, the National Anthem of the United States was abruptly ended, causing some frustration amongst both the coaches and the gymnasts themselves.\nIt has since been reported that right before the team competition began, McKayla Maroney from the United States, who was a member of the team who won the gold medal in the team competition and later won the individual vault title, was sexually assaulted by the former national team and Olympic team doctor Larry Nassar. Maroney has since described this incident as \"the scariest night of my life\" Nassar, later convicted pedophile, was on the floor next to the gymnasts for most of the world championships.\nIndividual all-around.\nThe final was held on October 13. None of the medalists from the previous year were able to compete to defend their title as the gold and bronze medalists—Aliya Mustafina and Rebecca Bross, respectively—were both unable to compete at worlds due to knee injuries, and silver medalist Jiang Yuyuan did not qualify high enough over her teammates. A number of gymnasts ranked high enough to make the all-around final, but did not qualify due to the two-per-country rule. All the gymnasts from the US that competed in the preliminary round ranked in the top 24. The gymnasts affected were Gabby Douglas (5th), Sabrina Vega (9th), and McKayla Maroney (12th) of the United States. Also affected were Tan Sixin (15th) and Jiang Yuyuan (20th) of China, Yuko Shintake (21st) and Yu Minobe (23rd) of Japan, and Anna Dementyeva (31st) of Russia. The last gymnast to qualify was Carlotta Ferlito, who ranked 32nd in the preliminary competition.\nOldest and youngest competitors\nVault.\nPhan's bronze medal was the first medal for Vietnam at a World Championships. Maroney's performance secured the third consecutive World gold medal for the USA on women's vault following Kayla Williams in 2009 and teammate Alicia Sacramone in 2010. Chusovitina's silver was her 11th world medal (her 9th vault world medal). As her first world championships was in Indianapolis in 1991, she has been competing at an international level since before her fellow vault finalists were born.\nOldest and youngest competitors\nUneven bars.\nOldest and youngest competitors\nBalance beam.\nOldest and youngest competitors\nFloor.\nOldest and youngest competitors\nOn the day before the competition, it was announced that Diana Bulimar injured her foot, and first reserve Lauren Mitchell would take her place in the final. Shortly after the women's beam competition, it was announced that Russia decided to pull Viktoria Komova from the competition to give her teammate (and second reserve) Ksenia Afanasyeva a chance to compete in the final instead. During warm up Vanessa Ferrari injured herself; so, third reserve Diana Chelaru was quickly added to replace her. \nMen's results.\nTeam all-around.\nIn the qualifying round, 5 gymnasts performed on each apparatus, and the top 4 scores counted towards the team's total. The top 8 teams qualified for the final.\nIn the final round, held on October 12, only 3 gymnasts performed on each apparatus, and all the scores were counted. The Chinese team won the title for the fifth successive time, benefiting from crucial mistakes by the last 2 Japanese gymnasts. Japan was still able to win the silver medal, with a margin of only 0.010 point from the United States in bronze medal position.\nOldest and youngest competitors\nIndividual all-around.\nThe all-around final was held on October 14. Three gymnasts had ranked high enough to qualify, but were not allowed to compete due to the two-per-country rule. The affected gymnasts were Jonathan Horton (5th), Fabian Hambüchen (19th) and Steven Legendre (24th). On the day of the final, Marian Drăgulescu pulled out of the competition and Nathan Gafuik took his place. Kōhei Uchimura's gold-medal-winning-margin was 3.101 points over runner-up Philipp Boy, who defended his silver medal from 2010 as well.\nOldest and youngest competitors\nFloor.\nThe final for Men's Floor Exercise took place on October 15. Marian Drăgulescu had qualified in 2nd, but pulled out of the competition on the morning of the final. As the first reserve, Jake Dalton (USA) took his place. There was also an inquiry made by the Japanese coaches into the scoring when Kōhei Uchimura's difficulty score was only awarded a 6.500 because they had mistaken a triple twisting move for a double twisting move. The inquiry was accepted by the judges, and the score adjusted accordingly, which gave Uchimura the gold medal.\nOldest and youngest competitors\nPommel horse.\nOldest and youngest competitors\nRings.\nOldest and youngest competitors\nVault.\nOriginally, Marian Drăgulescu was to compete in this final, but had to pull out of competition due to an injury.

        "text": "ICC U19 Cricket World Cup Africa Qualifier (formerly ICC Africa Under-19 Championships) are a series of regular cricket tournaments organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC) for under-19 teams from its African member nations. It is the regional qualifier for the ICC Under-19 World Cup.\nThe initial tournament was staged in 2001 but did not return until 2007. During the interim years a joint competition with the East Asia-Pacific Cricket Council was held. A second division was added in 2009 providing affiliate nations with a chance to participate. After this first edition, two teams were promoted, but since then only one team has moved between divisions. The two divisions are played at different times and in different locations.\nThe current champions are Namibia, who won the 2023 tournament in Tanzania to qualify for the 2024 Under-19 Cricket World Cup in Sri Lanka Namibia have won seven titles, the most of any team, while Uganda have won twice and Kenya and Nigeria once each.\nUnder-19 World Cup Qualification History.\nOne of the key aspects of the African Under-19 Championships is its role in Under-19 World Cup Qualification. Before the introduction of the championship only Kenya and Namibia took part in the World Cup. However, aided by the development of international cricket during the late 90s and 2000s the possibility of holding the first African regional qualifier arose in 2001. Of the five associate nations at that time, Kenya already had automatic qualification for the 2002 U-19 World Cup due to their ODI status. As a result, the highest finisher in the inaugural competition besides Kenya would also qualify. Namibia finished in first place and so earned themselves the final World Cup space.\nFor the following two U-19 World Cups, the African Cricket Association and the East Asia-Pacific Cricket Council organised joint qualification competitions from which two teams would progress. In the 2003 competition, Uganda qualified alongside EAP side Papua New Guinea for the 2004 U-19 World Cup but in 2005 two African nations, Namibia and Uganda made it through to the 2006 finals.\nIn 2007, the two councils once again organised separate competitions, meaning only one team would qualify from the African Championships. Namibia beat Kenya in the final to go through as the representative of African associate nations.\nThe entire qualification system for the U-19 World Cup was revamped in 2009. Whilst regionally, a second division of African affiliate nations was organised, including the chance of promotion, a new international qualification tournament was introduced by the ICC. This competition saw ten teams, two from each of the five cricketing regions, fighting for the six remaining places in the World Cup finals. The winners and runners-up of the 2009 Africa U-19 Championships, Uganda and Sierra Leone, made it through to the U-19 World Qualifiers, but neither finished high enough to progress to final. The Sierra Leone team hit the headlines when they were denied visas and so had no chance to compete.\nThe same system continued for the 2012 U-19 World Cup qualification, though the regional divisions were played a year earlier than usual, in 2010. Namibia and Kenya finished first and second in Division One earning them places in the U-19 World Cup Qualifier, held the next year.\nRecords.\n\"This section includes performances by African teams and players at the 2003 and 2005 combined Africa/EAP tournaments.\""

        "title": "2010 Asian Games medal table",
        "text": "The 2010 Asian Games, also known as the XVI Asiad, was a multi-sport event held in Guangzhou, China from 12 to 27 November 2010. The event saw 9,704 athletes from 45 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) competing in 476 events in 42 sports. This medal table ranks the participating NOCs by the number of gold medals won by their athletes.\nAthletes from 35 NOCs (Kuwait participated under the Olympic flag due to the suspension of its NOC) won medals, leaving 9 NOCs without a medal, and 29 of them won at least one gold medal. China led the medal table for the eighth consecutive time in the Asian Games. They led all the medal categories, winning the most gold medals (199), the most silver medals (119), the most bronze medals (98) and the most medals overall (416, 26% of all medals awarded). China became the first nation in the history of Asian Games to cross the 400 medal-mark in one edition. Macau and Bangladesh won their first Asian Games gold medals, from wushu and cricket, respectively.\nMedal table.\nThe ranking in this table is consistent with International Olympic Committee convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won (in this context, a \"nation\" is an entity represented by an NOC). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If nations are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by IOC country code.\nA total of 1,577 medals (477 gold, 479 silver and 621 bronze) were awarded. The total number of bronze medals is greater than the total number of gold or silver medals because two bronze medals were awarded per event in 15 sports: badminton, boxing, cue sports, fencing, judo, kabaddi, karate, sepaktakraw, soft tennis, squash, table tennis, taekwondo, tennis, wrestling, and wushu (except for taolu events).\nThis discrepancy is also caused by ties. In men's floor events in artistic gymnastics, there was a tie for the gold medal and no silver was awarded. There were also ties for the silver medal in men's 200 metres breaststroke in swimming, men's pole vault in athletics, and men's doubles in bowling. Thus, no bronzes were awarded in these events. Lastly, ties for third in both canoeing's men's K1 1000 metres and athletics' women's high jump, as well as a three-way tie for third in athletics' men's high jump, meant that multiple bronze medals were awarded for these events.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nChanges in medal standings.\nOn 19 November 2010, the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) announced that Uzbek judoka Shokir Muminov had been stripped of his silver medal in the 81 kg bout after he tested positive for methylhexanamine. The two bronze medalists, Japan's Masahiro Takamatsu and Kazakhstan's Islam Bozbayev, were promoted as silver medalists.\nOn 24 January 2011, the OCA stripped Qatari Ahmed Dheeb of his silver medal in discus throw after he tested positive for exogenous testosterone metabolites. The bronze medalist, Iran's Mohammad Samimi was promoted as silver medalist and India's Vikas Gowda was promoted as bronze medalist."

        "title": "Venues of the 1980 Winter Olympics",
        "text": "For the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York, United States, a total of seven sports venues were used. All five of the venues used for the 1932 Winter Olympics were also used at the 1980 Winter Games with adjustments. These adjustments included electronic scoreboards, increased refrigeration, and the addition of a separate luge track. This was the last Winter Olympics where there were separate bobsleigh and luge tracks. The closest finish in Olympic history in cross-country skiing led skiing officials to time future events in hundredths of a second rather than tenths of a second. This would also apply to biathlon events. Eric Heiden won five gold medals at the speed skating oval while the \"Miracle on Ice\" took place between Americans and Soviets at the Olympic Center. In the late 1990s, the luge track was demolished and a new combination track was constructed in time for the only Winter Goodwill Games held. The sliding venue was named to the American National Register of Historical Places in February 2010.\nBefore the Olympics.\nLake Placid hosted the Winter Olympics in 1932 with all five venues used for those games being used for the 1980 Winter Olympics. The city made four unsuccessful bids for the Winter Olympics in 1960, 1968, 1972, and 1976 before being awarded the 1980 Winter Olympics by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1974. Between the 1932 Winter Games and the 1980 Winter Games, Lake Placid played host to Winter Sports Championships, the first time many of them were held outside of Europe.\nAfter the 1932 Games, the speedskating oval hosted the World Allround Speed Skating Championships for Men. The bob run hosted the FIBT World Championships in 1949, 1961, 1969, 1973, and 1978. In 1950, the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships took place at the ski jump used for the 1932 Games for the ski jumping and the ski jumping part of the Nordic combined event. Biathlon held their first World Championships outside of Europe at Lake Placid in 1973.\nWhen Lake Placid was awarded the 1980 Winter Games in 1974, venue adjustments were needed. For the alpine skiing events, snow making equipment was used. This was used to make of man-made snow to cover all of the trails used for the events. Six new ski lifts and electronic timing/ scoring systems were also constructed. For the Nordic skiing events (cross-country skiing, Nordic combined, ski jumping), a total of 26 event officials were sent as observers to the 1978 world championships in Lahti, Finland to understand the venue needs for the 1980 Games. For the 50 km race, a total of was purchased and a trail system was created that involved tree-clearing. Man-made snow was also applied for the cross-country skiing trail. Races over 10 km in length were modified to meet the snow requirements as defined by the International Ski Federation. An electronic scoreboard was installed for the cross-country skiing events. This information was passed onto organizers for the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo. Two new ski jumps were constructed. The jump was constructed between May 1977 and December 1978. Construction for the jump also started in May 1977, but was not done until the February 1979 test event to construction delays caused by the bankruptcy of the steel contractor. Biathlon used trails similar to cross-country skiing though a separate finish area was used. A protective shooting area of was built for the competition of for 36 shooting stations was built. To cover of biathlon trails, twelve snow-making guns were used.\nSpeed skating had increased refrigeration access, improved locker room, improved lighting, electronic timing/ scoring systems, and an electronic scoreboard. The World Sprint Speed Skating Championships were held at the Oval in 1978 and proved beneficial on how to run the event. A separate facility was constructed near the Olympic Center for figure skating with renovation taking place at the Center itself between spring 1977 and November 1979. The biggest change was at the bob and luge track with the construction of a refrigeration system for the bob run following the 1978 World Championships in Lake Placid that also served as the test event for the 1980 Games. A new luge track was built between fall 1977 and February 1979. The original plan for the luge track was to include bobsleigh two-man on the track, but that was abandoned to excessive costs. It was the first luge track in North America. This was also the last Winter Olympics that would have separate bobsleigh and luge tracks.\nDuring the Olympics.\nCross-country skiing was first timed to the nearest full second from the first Winter Olympics in 1924 until 1956. By the time of the 1960 Winter Olympics, both biathlon and cross-country skiing began timing their events to the tenth of the second. Twelve years later, biathlon and cross-country skiing timing was measured in the hundredths of a second. In the men' 15 km cross-country skiing event, Sweden's Thomas Wassberg beat out Finland's Juha Mieto by 0.01 seconds, the closest finish in Olympic history. This would lead International Ski Federation officials to measure all cross-country skiing time to the tenth of a second. Biathlon followed suit with cross-country skiing and by the time of the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo, both sports had their times measured in tenths of a second.\nAfter the Olympics.\nThe luge track hosted the FIL World Luge Championships in 1983, the first time the championships were held outside of Europe. Meanwhile, the bobsleigh track would host the FIBT World Championships in 1997 in men's skeleton. In the late 1990s, the luge track was demolished and replaced with a combination bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton track was built that would be completed in time for the 2000 Winter Goodwill Games. The combination venue hosted the men's bobsleigh World Championships in 2003. In 2009, the combination track became the first track to host the bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton world championships the same year in a non-Winter Olympic year. On 4 February 2010, the entire venue was added to the National Register of Historic Places in the United States.\nLake Placid host the men's version of the Biathlon World Championships in 1987. The city also hosted the first FIS Freestyle World Ski Championships held outside of Europe in 1991.\nIn 1994, the ski jumps were upgraded to meet the International Ski Federation requirements of K90 and K120.\nThe Olympic Center Arena continues to be used and was renamed the Herb Brooks Arena in 2005 after the coach of 1980 US ice hockey team.\nThe Olympic Village facilities were repurposed for Federal Correctional Institution, Ray Brook."

        "text": "The 2010–11 Temple Owls men's basketball team (the Owls) represented Temple University in the 2010–11 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The team played their home games at the Liacouras Center, which has a capacity of 10,206. The Owls were in their 29th season as a member of the Atlantic 10 Conference. In the previous season, Temple Owls gained a record of 29–6 and reached the NCAA tournament. The team returned three starters from the previous season, but leading scorer Ryan Brooks and point guard Luis Guzman left, having graduated. They were replaced by new players Aaron Brown, Anthony Lee, and Jimmy McDonnell and graduate student transfer Dutch Gaitley. In the off-season, other Atlantic 10 coaches predicted that Temple Owls would win the league.\nTemple Owls finished the season with a 26–8 record. Among the highlights of the year was an upset of #10 Georgetown on December 9, in coach Fran Dunphy's 400th victory. In addition, Lavoy Allen became Temple Owls' all-time leading rebounder in a 66–52 rout of Saint Joseph's. Allen snatched 12 boards to pass Temple Owls' radio analyst Johnny Baum's 1,042 career rebounds. The Owls' 14–2 mark in Atlantic 10 play earned them a two seed in the 2011 Atlantic 10 men's basketball tournament, where they lost in the semifinals to Richmond.\nThe team earned an at-large bid to the 2011 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament as a seven seed, and defeated Penn State in the round of 64 on a last-second shot by guard Juan Fernandez. The win ended Dunphy's 11-game losing streak in the NCAA Tournament, the longest on record. Temple Owls' season ended with a double overtime loss to San Diego State in the round of 32. After the season, Allen was selected for the All-Atlantic 10 First Team, Ramone Moore was selected for the All-Atlantic 10 Second Team, Fernandez was an All-Atlantic 10 Third Team selection, and Scootie Randall was recognized as an All-Atlantic 10 Honorable Mention. Allen was drafted by the Philadelphia 76ers in the second round of the 2011 NBA draft.\nPreseason.\nIn 2010–11, the Temple Owls men's basketball team were in their 29th season as a member of the Atlantic 10 Conference. Since 1997, the team has played their home games at the Liacouras Center, which has a capacity of 10,206. In their previous season, an Atlantic 10 Preseason Poll predicted that Temple Owls would finish fifth in the conference, tied with Duquesne. Despite the low expectations, the Owls were tied with Xavier atop the Atlantic 10 standings with a 14–2 conference record, and won their third straight Atlantic 10 tournament title. The team drew a five seed in the 2010 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, where they lost to 12 seed Cornell in the first round, 78–65, and finished with a record of 29–6. Head coach Fran Dunphy was rewarded with a contract extension on May 5, 2010 and will stay with Temple Owls until the 2017–18 season.\nBefore the 2010–11 season, Temple Owls men's basketball team lost two starters from the previous year to graduation: Ryan Brooks and Luis Guzman. Brooks was the team's highest scorer, with an average of 14.3 points per game, and averages of 4.2 rebounds and 2.3 assists per game. In his final season, he was selected for the all-conference second team and finished his career with 1,225 points, the 31st highest in Temple Owls' history. Guzman was the Owls' starting point guard, leading the team in assist-to-turnover ratio at 2.07 and averaged 4.9 points, 4.2 rebounds, and 3.2 assists per game. He was the team's captain and earned a degree in Bachelor of Business Administration in three and a half years. Walk-on forward Rafael DeLeon also graduated.\nTwo players left Temple Owls voluntarily: sophomores Chris Clarke and Carmel Bouchman. Clarke redshirted in 2009–10 after transferring from Pensacola Junior College, transferred again to Division II Morehouse College. Bouchman appeared in nine games and tallied a total of 12 minutes and two points before returning to Tel Aviv, Israel. Lavoy Allen, a first team all-conference selection and the team's leading rebounder at 10.7 rebounds per game. Allen briefly played with the 2010 NBA draft, but returned to Temple Owls for his senior season. Forward Craig Williams had foot surgery and did not play that season.\nOn October 21, 2010, the Owls were voted by other Atlantic 10 coaches as the preseason favorite to win the league, receiving 19 first place votes. Allen was selected for the All-Conference First Team and Defensive Team, while Juan Fernandez was selected for the second team. Allen was listed on the preseason Wooden and Naismith Award 50-man watchlist. Jay Bilas of ESPN named Temple Owls the third best team in the Atlantic 10, behind Xavier and Dayton. He cited Allen's summer experience on the USA select team and the development of Michael Eric as factors for a successful season.\nRecruiting.\nIncoming signees.\nAnthony Lee, a center from Eustis, Florida, joined Temple Owls on September 26, 2009, becoming the first member of the Owls' recruiting class. The Maryland native transferred from Eustis High School to West Oaks Academy after his junior year. As a senior, he averaged 23.0 points, 14.0 rebounds, and 3.0 blocks per game while winning MVP honors from the Sunshine Independent Athletic Association. ESPN ranked him the #38 center in his class. Lee picked Temple Owls over scholarship offers from Southern California, Georgia, and Seton Hall. After undergoing surgery for a herniated disc, Lee redshirted the season.\nOn November 2, small forward Aaron Brown of Newark, New Jersey signed with the Owls. He posted per-game averages of 17.6 points, 4.0 rebounds, 4.5 assists, and 3.0 steals in his senior campaign at St. Benedict's Prep. Brown was a New Jersey All-Prep First Team selection in 2010 and participated in the Jordan Brand Classic Regional. He chose Temple Owls over Harvard, Miami (Fl.), Penn, Boston College, and Florida State.\nSmall forward Jimmy McDonnell, from Jackson, New Jersey, joined the team on August 11, 2010. In his senior season at Jackson Memorial High School, McDonnell averaged 13.9 points, 6.5 rebounds, and 4.0 blocks per game as Jackson Memorial compiled a 16–8 record. McDonnell was selected for the first team all-Division in the A-Shore Conference, and was the most valuable player at the WOBM Holiday Classic. McDonnell was originally headed to Division II UMass Lowell, but after a strong performance at the West Virginia HoopGroup JamFest, he drew the attention of Owls coach Fran Dunphy. McDonnell redshirted the season to add bulk to his frame.\nDutch Gaitley was granted a one-time transfer exception by the NCAA and was eligible immediately, instead of sitting out the customary season. The forward graduated in three years from Monmouth University, earning his Bachelor of Arts degree in 2009. At Temple, Gaitley pursued a master's degree in sports administration. A native of Haverford, Pennsylvania, he was a 2006 graduate of Archbishop Carroll High School. In 88 games at Monmouth, he averaged 2.3 points and 4.1 rebounds per game.\n2011–12 team recruits.\nThe sole member of the Owls' 2011 recruiting class was Will Cummings, a point guard from Jacksonville, Florida who committed on September 4, 2010. He averaged 18.1 points, 8.1 assists, 4.0 steals per game as a senior at Providence School, in addition to carrying a 4.0 grade point average. The Jacksonville Times-Union named him the high school boys basketball player of the year. Cummings drew attention from Stanford, Miami (Fl.), and Boston College, but chose Temple because of their winning tradition.\nSchedule.\n! colspan=\"2\" | 2010–11 team schedule\nSeason.\nPreconference season.\nTemple Owls started their season with a 62–56 home win against Seton Hall Pirates on November 12. Seton Hall last led with 8:15 in the first half, off a Herb Pope jump shot to make the score 20–17. The Owls went on a 17–0 run to close the half. They led by up to 16 with 4 minutes and 16seconds left in the game, but Seton Hall scored the next 12 points to cut their deficit to four. Despite retaining most of their players from the 2009-2010 season, when they were the eighth-highest scoring team in Division I at 80.1 points per game, Seton Hall was held to 30 percent shooting by Temple Owls' defense. Juan Fernandez led Temple Owls with 12 points, and Rahlir Jefferson recorded his first double-double at 10 points and 10 rebounds. Owls player Lavoy Allen sat out much of the game with foul trouble. The Owls won their next game against Toledo 82–49. All five starters scored above nine, and Micheal Eric was the highest scorer, with 14 points.\nOver Thanksgiving weekend, the Owls traveled to Lake Buena Vista, Florida to participate in the Old Spice Classic. Temple Owls suffered their first loss of the season on November 25, falling to California 57–50. The Golden Bears went on a 16–1 run late in the second half to seal a victory. The next day, Temple Owls recovered to beat Georgia 65–58. Scootie Randall had a career-high 18 points for the Owls, including 15 in the first half. Rahlir Jefferson's converted a three-point play with 41.4 seconds left, securing a win for Temple Owls. In the Old Spice Classic consolation game, Temple Owls lost to Texas A&amp;M 54–51. Texas A&amp;M took a 51–50 lead when B.J. Holmes scored with 18.5 seconds left. Juan Fernandez then missed an open jumper that would have given Temple Owls the lead. \"We've got to shoot the ball better. Our defense is pretty solid. We've got a chance to be a good basketball team,\" said Temple Owls' coach Fran Dunphy after the game.\nThe team's next challenge was the Central Michigan Chippewas, which Temple Owls handled 65–53. The Owls were losing 31–41 with 16:35 left in the game, but then scored the next eight points. Temple Owls permanently took the lead off a Lavoy Allen layup with 9:30 remaining. Juan Fernandez notched 18 points led the Owls, and Allen had a double-double of 13 points and 10 rebounds. In the teams' first meeting since 2006, Temple Owls knocked off Maryland 63–61. Despite trailing by 15 at halftime, Maryland staged a comeback led by Terrell Stoglin, who had 12 of his 16 points in the second half. James Padgett dunked with 1:49 left to tie the game at 56. Afterwards, Lavoy Allen completed a three-point play, and Khalif Wyatt stole a Dino Gregory pass to put Temple Owls in the lead permanently. The Owls outrebounded the Terrapins 42–32, and Ramone Moore scored 16 points, leading the team.\nOn December 9, Temple Owls matched up against Georgetown. Fran Dunphy earned his 400th career victory, as his Owls upset the tenth-ranked Hoyas 68–65. At their first home game in almost a month, Temple Owls took an early 6–0 lead and did not trail the entire game. They led by 11 in the first half, and a backdoor cut to Ramone Moore put the Owls up 39–32 at the break. The Hoyas manage to tie the game at 56 when Chris Wright sunk a pair of free throws. A three-pointer from Moore and a putback shot from Rahlir Jefferson enabled Temple Owls to take a 61–56 lead. A hook shot by Georgetown's Julian Vaughn cut the Hoya deficit to one with less than a minute remaining, but Hollis Thompson missed a layup that would have given the Hoyas the lead. Jefferson grabbed the rebound and then netted two foul shots, and a last-second halfcourt shot by Austin Freeman went over the backboard. Temple Owls' fans rushed the court after the buzzer, as Georgetown suffered their first loss of the year. Moore shot 12-for-18 from the floor for a career-high 30 points. Dunphy congratulated his team's defensive effort, holding the Hoyas to 44 percent shooting, and said, \"it's all about these guys. They're all great players and great people.\"\nThe Owls then defeated three Mid-American Conference teams: Akron, Northern Illinois, and Ohio. On December 12, behind Micheal Eric's 16 points, Temple Owls routed Akron 82–47. At halftime, the Owls led 40–15 after shooting 63 percent in the first half. Temple Owls shot 53.4 percent from the field in an 84–74 win over Northern Illinois. Lavoy Allen had 22 points and Ramone Moore had 21 in the contest. Rahlir Jefferson's career-high 18 points led Temple Owls past Ohio 76–65 for the Owls' sixth consecutive victory.\nWhen Temple Owls squared off against #7 Villanova on December 30, it marked the first time since 1988 that two Philadelphia Big Five teams ranked in the Associated Press poll met. The Owls held star guard Corey Fisher to five points, but his backcourt mates Corey Stokes and Maalik Wayns tallied 24 and 21 points, respectively, to give Villanova a 78–74 victory. The game was back-and-forth all night, and Temple Owls held a 40–39 lead at the break. Villanova built a 10-point lead in the second half, but the Owls went on a 13–0 run to take a three-point lead. With 2.3 seconds left, Lavoy Allen hit a three to cut the Wildcats' lead to 76–74, but Wayns sealed the win with a pair of free throws. Allen scored 22 for Temple Owls, and Juan Fernandez had 20 points.\nConference season.\nTo begin the conference season, the Owls won against Fordham 70–51 at the IZOD Center. Fordham last won a conference game on January 28, 2009, but Temple Owls had a 27–22 deficit in the first half. However, a balanced offensive attack, led by Juan Fernandez and Ramone Moore's 15 points each, helped Temple Owls to take the lead.

I would be lying if I said I didn't. But I'm so thrilled for these kids and so thrilled to be in the tournament. We've had a nice run – this particular group, four straight years of going to the NCAA tournament is pretty special.\"\nScootie Randall returned to the Owls and earned the start, although he only played for six minutes and did not score.

Ramone Moore had 17 points, and Allen had 12 points and 11 rebounds in his final game as a Temple Owl.\nStatistics.\nThe team posted the following statistics:\nNBA draft.\nIn the 2011 NBA draft, the Philadelphia 76ers drafted Lavoy Allen in the second round with the 50th pick on June 23. Allen became the 32nd Temple player to be drafted and the first since the New York Knicks selected Mardy Collins with the 29th pick in 2006. \"I am very happy for him,\" said coach Fran Dunphy. \"He accomplished so much as a college basketball player. It is a great reward to be drafted, and to go to the Sixers is icing on the cake.\""

The racewalking and marathon events were held on the temporary Guadalajara Circuit and Route and the Pan American Marathon circuit respectively. The sport of athletics is split into distinct sets of events: track and field events, road running events, and racewalking events.\nMirroring the Olympic athletics programme, both men and women had very similar schedules of events. Men competed in 24 events and women in 23, as their schedule lacks the 50 km race walk. In addition, both the men's 110 m hurdles and decathlon are reflected in the women's schedule by the 100 m hurdles and heptathlon, respectively.\nAs they had done in the 2007 edition, Cuba topped the athletics medal table, taking 18 gold medals and 33 medals in total. The Brazilian team were a clear second with ten golds and 23 medals overall. The hosts Mexico and the United States both won four events each, while Colombia had the third greatest medal haul with seventeen altogether.\nOver the seven-day competition, fourteen Pan American Games records were equalled or bettered. Furthermore, two South American records were set: Brazil's Lucimara da Silva broke the heptathlon record and the Brazilian women's 4 × 100 metres relay quartet also improved a continental mark.\nParticipation.\nA total of 668 athletes from 39 countries were entered in the athletics competition. A maximum of two participants were allowed per country for each individual event. Nations were able to enter one competitor who had not achieved the minimum standard performance. To register a second competitor, both athletes needed to have achieved the minimum standard performance."

It was the seventh edition of the tournament, took place from 5–24 August 2014 in Canada, which was named the host nation for the tournament in conjunction with its successful bid for the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup. Canada was the first country to stage this tournament twice, after hosting the inaugural edition in 2002.\nGermany beat Nigeria 1–0 after extra time in the final. Germany won its third title while Nigeria lost their second final.\nHost selection.\nAs in 2010, the rights to host the 2014 U-20 Women's World Cup were automatically awarded to the host of the following year's Women's World Cup. Two countries, Canada and Zimbabwe, initially bid to stage the events. However, on 1 March 2011, two days before the official voting was to take place, Zimbabwe withdrew, leaving Canada as the only bidder. FIFA officially awarded the tournaments to Canada on 3 March 2011.\nQualified teams.\nThe slot allocation was approved by the FIFA Executive Committee in May 2012.\nIn July, all Nigeria teams became subject of a FIFA ban due to government interference with the national football association. The team faced exclusion from the tournament until the ban was lifted nine days later.\nVenues.\nOn 2 June 2013, FIFA announced that Edmonton, Moncton, Montreal and Toronto would be the host cities for the tournament. The first three cities had been previously announced as host cities for the 2015 Women's World Cup, along with Vancouver, Winnipeg, and Ottawa. Toronto did not apply to host the 2015 tournament due to conflicts with the 2015 Pan American Games, but does not face any such conflicts in 2014. Meanwhile, Ottawa indicated in late 2012 that it would not be able to participate in hosting the U-20 tournament due to construction delays on the Lansdowne Park redevelopment.\nAs was the case during the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup, BMO Field in Toronto was known as the National Soccer Stadium during the tournament, due to FIFA policies regarding corporate sponsorship of stadiums.\nMatch officials.\nA total of 13 referees, 5 reserve referees, and 26 assistant referees were appointed by FIFA for the tournament.\nSquads.\nEach team named a squad of 21 players (three of whom must be goalkeepers) by the FIFA deadline. The squads were announced by FIFA on 25 July 2014.\nFinal draw.\nThe final draw was held on 1 March 2014 in Montreal. Confederation champions France, South Korea and United States were put in Pot 1 alongside the hosts Canada, who were automatically assigned to Position A1. The draw then made sure no teams of the same confederation could meet in the group stage.\nGroup stage.\nThe schedule of the tournament was announced on 6 August 2013.\nThe winners and runners-up of each group advance to the quarter-finals. The rankings of teams in each group are determined as follows:\nIf two or more teams are equal on the basis of the above three criteria, their rankings are determined as follows:\nAll times are local:\nGroup A.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup B.\nThe 5–5 draw by Germany and China tied the tournament record for most goals in a match and set a new record for highest scoring draw.\nGroup C.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup D.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nKnockout stage.\nIn the knockout stages, if a match is level at the end of normal playing time, extra time is played (two periods of 15 minutes each) and followed, if necessary, by a penalty shoot-out to determine the winner, except for the third place match where no extra time is played as the match is played directly before the final.\nFinal.\nThe pairing Nigeria vs Germany is a repeat of the 2010 final which Germany won 2–0.

It ran from 21 June to 13 July 2013. At the FIFA Executive Meeting in Zürich on 3 March 2011, Turkey beat other bids to host the series games, from host competition by the United Arab Emirates and Uzbekistan. In its bid, Turkey suggested the use of thirteen stadiums in ten of its cities, before deciding in February 2012, that seven cities would play host to games.\nThis tournament marked the first time in its history that neither Argentina nor Brazil (the most successful teams in the competition) qualified. It was also only the second time that Brazil had not taken part (the first time was the 1979 edition).\nFrance won the tournament and their first U-20 World Cup, and thus became the first nation to win all five FIFA 11-a-side men's titles (FIFA World Cup, FIFA Confederations Cup, FIFA U-20 World Cup, FIFA U-17 World Cup, and the Olympic football tournament).\nBids.\nAt the deadline date of 17 January 2011, three member associations confirmed they would be bidding for the event.

The 24 teams were divided into four differing pots:\nTurkey was assigned to position C1, and Spain was assigned to Group A. As a basic principle, teams from the same confederation could not be drawn against each other at the group stage, except in Group A where there were two teams from UEFA.\nAs the CAF U-20 Championship was not completed at the time of the draw, a separate draw took place at the tournament's conclusion on 30 March in Oran, Algeria to determine the groups where the second, third and fourth-placed CAF teams would play in. As the OFC U-20 Championship was realize after at time of the draw, New Zealand appeared in Pot 1 as OFC Champion.\nMatch officials.\nThe 23 referee trios were announced by FIFA on 13 May 2013.\nSquads.\nTeams had to name a 21-man squad (three of whom had to be goalkeepers) by the FIFA deadline.

        "title": "CIS national ice hockey team",
        "text": "The CIS national ice hockey team was an ephemeral national ice hockey team that represented the Commonwealth of Independent States. Essentially the former Soviet team under a different name, the CIS team existed in the few months between the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the formation of new ice hockey federations for the former Soviet states, now independent countries. Most notably, the team competed at the 1992 Winter Olympics as part of the Unified Team, winning the gold medal. However, the International Ice Hockey Federation would later attribute this gold medal to Russia as the successor state. The International Olympic Committee does not attribute that medal to Russia. After the Olympics, the CIS team ceased to exist and was replaced by the Russian team. In the 13 games the CIS played, they won 11 and lost 2.\nHistory.\nThe Soviet Union was dissolved in December 1991, only weeks before the start of the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France. As a result, there was no time to send a replacement for the Soviet national team, who was expected to compete at the Olympics. In effect, the Soviet team participated, under the name \"Unified Team\" and with the \"CCCP\" on their uniforms removed, leaving a blank spot. Rather than the Soviet national anthem, the Olympic Hymn was played, and the Olympic flag was used instead of the Soviet flag.\nMany of the best Soviet players had since left the former Soviet Union for the National Hockey League (NHL), which did not stop play for the Olympics. Thus, the team used players from the Russian and Swiss leagues instead, and head coach Viktor Tikhonov, known for his authoritarian style of coaching, was forced to modify his strategy, as he had no leverage over the players. Despite the absence of superstars, the CIS team had no problems with talent, boasting experienced veterans Vyacheslav Bykov, Andrei Khomutov and Alexei Zhamnov. The team was composed almost entirely of Russians, with Lithuanian-born Darius Kasparaitis and Ukrainian-born Alexei Zhitnik the only non-Russians. Kasparaitis would later represent Russia in international competition. In 2017, he switched to join the Lithuanian national team. Zhitnik would represent Russia throughout his career.\nThey played in three friendlies against Austria, Canada, and Italy in January 1992. They defeated the Austrians and Canadians 7-2 each, and the Italians by a score of 4–2.\nThe national team next took part in the Nissan Cup, hosted by Switzerland. They defeated Finland in the semifinals 6–2, but were surprised by the Swiss hosts in the final, losing by a score of 3–0.\nAt the 1992 Winter Olympics held in Albertville, France, the national team finished with a 7–1 record, and won the gold medal by defeating Canada 3–1 in the final.\nAfter the Olympics, the team was dissolved and replaced by the Russian national team and other national teams for the independent post-Soviet states.\nRoster.\nA total of 20 skaters and 2 goalies players played for the Unified Team at the 1992 Winter Olympics. Nikolai Borschevsky and Andrei Khomutov tied for the lead in goals, with 7 each, while Khomutov and Vyacheslav Bykov had the most assists, 7. Khomutov had the most points on the team, with 14. While named to the team, Nikolai Khabibulin did not play in any games."

At both events they finished eleventh.\nIn 2006 the team's coach was the Japanese coach Sadatoshi Sugawara who was assisted by Paul Bitok. They contested the FIVB World Championships in Japan although the team was said to lack professional players as the chosen team were students or players who were based in Japan.\nIn 2007 their coach Sammy Kirongo led them to a seventh Women's African Volleyball Championship victory. That year's championships was in Nairobi and the final was against Algeria. The Kenyan team included Brackcides Agala, Janet Wanja, Dorcas Ndasaba and Catherine Wanjiru. Mildred Odwako was said to be the \"best digger\" and Janet Wanja was the \"best setter\". Dorcas Ndasaba was judged \"best player\" after she gained the final point to deliver victory in straight sets.\nIn 2008 they failed to qualify for the 2008 Summer Olympics after they were beaten by Algeria and four years later Algeria again denied them qualification for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.\nIn 2015 Brackcides Agala was the captain of the team and Janet Wanja assisted her. The team announced that they refused to play for the 2015 FIVB World Grand Prix in Canberra after several victories. The players were annoyed that they had not been paid money that had been promised by the Kenya Volleyball Federation. The boycott was successful and the team played and won against Peru. However, the KVF were not pleased and when the team's were announced for the 2016 Summer Olympics neither Khadambi or her assistant Janet Wanja were asked to the qualifying matches and the team failed to qualify.\nIn 2020, under the new head coach of Paul Bitok, Kenya's women's volleyball team won the gold medal at the African Games and they qualified for the postponed 2020 Summer Olympics which was the first time in sixteen years.\n2020 Olympics.\nKenya women's volleyball team qualified for the postponed 2020 Summer Olympics by winning the pool round with three match points and securing an outright berth at the African Olympic Qualification Tournament in Yaoundé, Cameroon, marking the nation's return to the Olympics for the first time since Athens 2004.\nThe chosen players names were revealed on 26 June 2021. The Olympic team included the veteran Mercy Moim as captain and Jane Wacu also made the team, but former players Violet Makuto and Elizabeth Wanyama were not included. Kenya's \"Most Valued Player\" Brackcides Agala was included in the beach volleyball team. The team received additional coaching from six Brazilian coaches who visited Kenya and the team was then sent to Nairobi where they received additional coaching from the Brazilian coach . The other teams in their group in Tokyo are the home team Japan, Serbia, Brazil, Korea and the Dominican Republic.\nThe team set off from Kenya for the Olympics in Tokyo in three batches to try and minimise the chances of being affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The team's captain Mercy Moim was chosen to be one of Kenya's flagbearers at the Olympics opening ceremony (Moim was the second woman to be given this honour following archer Shazad Anwar in 2016).\nTheir opening match was on 25 July in Tokyo against Japan. Surprisingly Paul Bitok was not on the match's touchline, but Brazilian coach was announced as the head coach. He spoke to the press via the team manager. The team lost their first match against Japan in straight sets.\nCurrent squad.\nThe following is Kenya's roster for the 2022 FIVB Volleyball Women's World Championship\nHead Coach: Luizomar de Moura\n2021 Beach volleyball Olympic team.\nKenya also has a women's national beach volleyball team. The team that gained Kenya qualification for the postponed 2020 Summer Olympics was Yvonne Wavinya, Brackcides Agala, Phosca Kasisi and Gaudencia Makokha. They qualified when they won at the African Continental Cup Finals in Morocco in 2021. They gained victory in a final against the Nigeria women's national volleyball team. Wavinga and Kasisi beat Tochukwu Nnoruga and Albertina Francis 2-0 while Agala and Makokha beat the other Nigerian pair of Francisca Ikhiede and Amara Uchechukwu 2–1.\nKenya's beach volleyballers were in the four Continental Cup winners with Argentina, Cuba and China. Kenya has never had a beach volleyball team at the Olympics and they are only the fourth African country to send a team.\nThe four players who qualified will make up Kenya's Olympic beach volleyball team chosen by the coach Sammy Mulinge. They will compete initially with the teams from Brazil, the US and Latvia in pool D at the postponed 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. The volleyballers stayed in Mombasa for training before flying to Tokyo. They were the African champions, but the pandemic meant that many of their future opponents had been able to play more matches.\n2021 Sitting Volleyball Paralympic team.\nKenya's sitting volleyball team failed to qualify in the round robin contests in Kigali in September 2019. Rwanda won the place putting Egypt into second place in the final."

        "title": "Venues of the 1976 Winter Olympics",
        "text": "For the 1976 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria, a total of eight sports venues were used. The games were originally awarded to Denver, Colorado in the United States in 1970, but they withdrew in the wake of Colorado residents voting against it for environmental and cost reasons in November 1972. This led to the International Olympic Committee opening up the bids for the games again, eventually awarding them to Innsbruck in February 1973. The Austrian city, having hosted the Winter Olympics in 1964, was in the process of having the venues used for those Games before Denver's with clear cutting of the alpine skiing venues, lessening of the amount of cross-country skiing routes, upgrading the ski jumps, adding lighting in the indoor sports arena to accommodate color television, and the construction of a combination bobsleigh and luge track. After the 1976 Games, the venues have remained in use, hosting events in Nordic skiing and the sliding sports. They hosted some of the events for the Winter Universiade in 2005 and seven of the eight venues served as host for the first Winter Youth Olympic Games in 2012.\nBefore the Olympics.\nInnsbruck hosted the Winter Olympics in 1964. Bergiselschanze, one of the venues used for those games, has been part of ski jumping's Four Hills Tournament since the 1952–3 season.\nAt the International Olympic Committee (IOC) session at Amsterdam in May 1970, Denver, Colorado was selected over Sion, Tampere, and Whistler, British Columbia to host the 1976 Winter Games. Local pressure from residents in Colorado forced a referendum vote two years later in which state residents, led by future governor Richard Lamm on environmental and cost concerns. A vote of 3 to 2 against on 7 November 1972 confirmed this, resulting in the United States Olympic Committee wanting to move the 1976 Winter Games to Salt Lake City, Utah. Denver withdrew their bid in November 1972, resulting in the IOC reopening up the bid for the 1976 Games. Besides Innsbruck, other cities who bid were Salt Lake City, Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Chamonix, and Lake Placid, New York. Innsbruck was awarded the 1976 Games by the IOC on 4 February 1973.\nBefore Innsbruck was awarded the 1976 Winter Games, the venues used were in the process of being expanded. Patscherkofel's downhill run was widened in 1971. Axamer Lixum's course proposed originally for the 1964 Winter Games was used for both men's and women's event had to be clear cut in order to remove the trees located there along with its slope being reduced from 66 to 71% to 28-31%. A total of was moved along with the canalization of a deep ditch long. Seefeld used lesser loops for the cross-country courses compared to the 1964 Games. New lighting was installed in Olympiahalle to accommodate color television along with a new loudspeaker system. A plastic pipe under the ice had to be replaced when American figure skater Terry Kubicka broke through the ice, piercing the pipe, and creating a coolant leak. Two new compressors of ammonia refrigeration were added to Eisschnellaufbahn to maintain the ice at . The biggest change was at the bobsleigh and luge track where a single track was used for combined events, the first of its kind in the world. Construction of the track began in 1973 under the auspices of the International Bobsleigh and Tobogganing Federation and International Luge Federation and was completed the following year. During the 1975 Olympic Test Competition on the track, East Germany set up cameras and timers all along the run to determine the fastest lines through each of the straights and curves.\nDuring the Olympics.\nIn the alpine skiing men's downhill, Austria' Franz Klammer came from behind to beat Switzerland's Bernhard Russi in where television coverage was given for the entire run.\nThe work that East Germany did at analyzing the Igls track in 1975 paid off with gold medals in all three luge and both bobsleigh events.\nDuring the cross-country skiing men's 4 x 10 km relay event, East Germany was in second place after the first leg of the event. Axel Lesser, the second leg of the East German team, ran into a spectator, injured his knee, and had to abandon the race.\nAfter the Olympics.\nBergiselschanze remains a part of the Four Hills Tournament. Seefeld would play host to the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships in 1985 and 2019.\nIgls has served as host of the IBSF World Championships (previous FIBT) in 1991 (men's skeleton), 1993 (bobsleigh), 2000 (skeleton), and 2016. The track hosted the FIL European Luge Championships in 1990 and hosted the FIL World Luge Championships five times in 1977, 1987, 1997, 2007, and 2017.\nSeefeld and Innsbruck combined to host the Winter Universiade in 2005. In 2012, Innsbruck hosted the first Winter Youth Olympic Games. All venues used for the 1976 Winter Olympics except for Axamer Lizum were in use as venues for the 2012 Winter Youth Games."

It was their third season in the County Championship and they came fourteenth after failing to win a match, though they were exceptionally unlucky in losing by a single wicket to power clubs Lancashire and Yorkshire and being robbed by time of victory over Leicestershire late in the season.\n1897 season.\nDerbyshire played sixteen games in the County Championship and one against MCC. They did not win a match in the season, losing ten. They were missing two key bowlers: John Hulme, who had taken most wickets in 1896, did not play at all during the season; and George Porter, who underwent surgery in 1896 and retired from the game.\nSydney Evershed was in his seventh season as captain. Levi Wright was top scorer, overtaking Bagshaw's lead in the Championship with a good performance against MCC. George Davidson took most wickets but, apart from three matches on sticky wickets against Lancashire, Warwickshire and Yorkshire, was never difficult, and of the others only wicket-keeper Storer ever took five wickets in one innings.\nOf those who made their debuts in the season, Arnold Warren went on to play for the club for 23 years and represented England in 1905, and Maynard Ashcroft, a doctor, went on to become club captain. Most of the remaining newcomers were from mining families. Frank Davidson, Joseph Hancock and William Wilmot each played over several more seasons but more or less occasionally. James Cross, Herbert Bostock, Dick Steeples and Edward Houseman all appeared only in the 1897 season, Cross playing nine matches, Bostock four, Steeples three and Houseman one. Cross and Steeples filled in for the lack of bowling, while Bostock achieved a high average in his three games.\nMatches.\n(a) Figures adjusted for non Championship match"

The school's team competed in the Western Athletic Conference through the 2023–24 season, and will move to the Southland Conference after that season. They play their home games at the UTRGV Fieldhouse. The Vaqueros are one of 45 Division I programs to have never appeared in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament.\nThe team's current identity was established after the University of Texas at Brownsville and the University of Texas–Pan American (UTPA) were merged in 2015. The merged university inherited the athletic legacy of UTPA, including its WAC membership. Before the merger, UTPA's teams were known as the “Broncs.”\nHistory.\nBeginnings (1952–1958).\nThe Broncs first began play in 1952 under their then-current institutional identity of Pan American College, as a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics. In their first ever season (coached by L.A. Youngman), the Broncs finished 11–10. They joined the Big State Conference before the next season, but the Broncs finished 6–11 overall with an 0–6 conference record. Harry Meng took over the team the next two seasons, but he did not fare any better, going 2–20 and 4–20 in his two seasons. John Donnelly took over as coach, serving from 1956 to 1958, with his tenure marked by 4–16 and 5–14 records, respectively.\nSam Williams era (1959–1973).\nSam Williams took over the program in 1958. During that season, he led them to a 12–11 record, the first season with a winning record since 1952. The next year, he led them to a 17–9 record, and a 7–3 conference record, their first ever season with a winning conference record. Despite finishing with a 15–16 record, the Broncs made their first ever postseason appearance in 1961, playing in the NAIA District Playoffs. They were beaten in two games by Texas State, 83–64 and 73–72. In 1962, the Broncs finished with a 26–4 record. This time, the Broncs finally made their first NAIA Men's Basketball Tournament appearance after beating Texas State twice in a row, 71–68 and 67–61.

They appeared in the 1980 TAAC men's basketball tournament, beating Hardin–Simmons in the Quarterfinals, but losing to eventual conference champion Centenary in the semifinals. They were rewarded for their season with an appearance in the National Invitation Tournament. They lost to Tulsa 81–71.

However, they improved to 16–12 (along with a 9–9 conference record) the following year. After a 14–14 season in 1994, they dropped to 9–19 the next year, but dropped even further in 1996, falling to 3–25, with only one conference win. In March 1996, the university acknowledged violations by the men's basketball program, specifically the conduct of illegal off-campus camps for basketball, free medical treatment for players and disregarding instructions by both the school and the NCAA on procedures of investigation.

A 7–24 record in his second season proved to be his last season with the Broncs.\nTom Schuberth years (2006–2009).\nTom Schuberth led the team to a 15–15 record in his first season, their first .500 team in three years. They improved to 18–13 the following year, the most victories since 2001. However, they finished 10–17 in 2008, and Schuberth's contract was not renewed after the season. Subsequently, it was found out that during his tenure, over 44 impermissible calls were made to 13 student-athletes from 2006 to 2008, along with paying inducements to one student-athlete, who also supervised workouts with an UTPA coach. It was found that the university had started their investigation in September 2008, which led to giving themselves a two-year probation sanction (starting in 2010), with the NCAA accepting UTPA's self-imposed penalties and choosing not to impose additional sanctions.\nRyan Marks era (2009–2013).\nWith the advent of a new coach came an acceptance into the Great West Conference, the first time the Broncs had been affiliated with a conference since 1997. Marks' two first seasons ended with 6 victories each before a slight improvement to 11–21 in 2011. Despite the team rising to a 16–16 overall record (and 5 victories in 8 conference games) the following year, his contract was not renewed.\nDan Hipsher era (2013–2016).\nAlabama assistant coach Dan Hipsher, who previously served as head coach at Akron, Stetson, and Division III Wittenburg, was hired in 2013.
